Such models are often generated using protein-protein docking algorithms, where one of the main challenges is selecting which of several thousand potential predictions represents the most near-native complex. We have developed a novel technique that involves the use of steered molecular dynamics (sMD) and umbrella sampling to identify near-native complexes among protein-protein docking predictions. Using this technique, we have found a strong correlation between our predictions and the interface RMSD (iRMSD) in ten diverse test systems. On two of the systems, we investigated if the prediction results could be further improved using potential of mean force calculations. We demonstrated that a near-native (<2.0 \u00c5 iRMSD) structure could be identified in the top-1 ranked position for both systems.",

Steered MD produced the best results of any scoring scheme tested producing at least one good pose for 7/10 systems tested and an acceptable pose for 10/10 systems within the top-10 predictions. The irad and stats scoring functions performed similarly to sMD, both produced good predictions in 6/10 cases and acceptable poses were predicted from 10/10 and 8/10 poses respectively. In terms of enrichment, steered MD and stats perform the best. This is especially apparent in 1DJF, 1EZU, and 1UDI, where steered MD and stats significantly outperform the other scoring functions. Furthermore, both perform perfectly or nearly perfectly in 4/10 systems (1PPE, 1DJF, 1EAW, and 1UDI) as shown in Figure 2A In general, most scoring functions that were tested produced a good or acceptable pose within the top-10 predictions, but oftentimes the top-10 predictions also included several poor poses. The inclusion of poor poses is less detrimental if they are ranked below good or acceptable poses, but this was not always the case. For instance, in 2HRK, only a single good pose (iRMSD: 1.98 \u00c5) was identified in the top-10 predictions by steered MD and this pose was ranked 10 th overall. Furthermore the three acceptable poses (iRMSDs: 2.49 \u00c5, 2.13 \u00c5, and 2.86 \u00c5) were also ranked poorly (7 th , 8 th and 9 th , respectively).

Repeating this analysis for 1VFB revealed that the same number of contact-mediating waters were identified in low iRMSD and x-ray structure supporting the observation that the PMF of the crystal structure and good poses were approximately equal.

Importantly, the time required for calculation of PMF profiles could present a significant limitation. In practice, we suggest that a more rapid scoring function might be used as a pre-filter, prior to implementing the more computationally demanding umbrella sampling (both the stats and the irad scoring functions performed exceptionally well in our hands). In addition to the time required to calculate the PMF profiles, the calculations are sensitive to the reproducibility of the interactions in the interface. In an ideal case, protein partners would not change conformation upon binding and interface interactions would be strictly between partners (i.e. not mediated by water or other co-factors). Caution should be exercised in cases where drastic conformational changes are thought to occur or in cases where protein interactions are extensively mediated by other molecules. Methods such as principal component analysis (PCA), may be employed to determine the best vector for sMD simulations in cases of intricate interfaces or where significant conformational change is anticipated In summary, the use of steered MD and umbrella sampling in ranking protein-protein docking conformations represents a novel approach in this field and has been found to be successful in the test cases presented here and elsewhere 18 . While there are some limitations to this approach, notably the computational cost, we believe that this approach may prove useful in a range of systems and be a complimentary approach to the currently used scoring functions for protein-protein docking.",
