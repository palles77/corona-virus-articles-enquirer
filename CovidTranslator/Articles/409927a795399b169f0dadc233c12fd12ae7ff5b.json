The technique was first described in 1941 (9, 10), using plant viruses and their antibodies, and has been employed in many biologic systems. Since that time, a series of procedures for IEM have appeared. Several excellent reviews have been published on: a) the morphology of antibody and virus-antibody interaction (7, 25) ; b) electron and immunoelectron microscopic procedures for diagnosis of viral infections (18) ; c) practical aspects of the IEM of intracellular structures (34, 45) ; d) the role of EM in diagnostic virology (16) ; e) IEM as a method for the detection, identification and characterization of agents not cultivable in an in-vitro system (31) . This article will review the various methods of IEM and illustrate their usefulness in diagnostic virology.",

            "text": "Direct IEM methodology has been used to study basic morphology of several viruses that present a problem with ordinary conventional EM. Antibody attachment to rubella virus .allows its separation from contaminating debris of equal size and density and a morphological definition of the periphery of the virus particles (13) . Similarly, IEM has enabled basic observations on the morphology of rhinoviruses (30) and polyoma and wart viruses (4) . IEM has also contributed to our knowledge of diseases caused by viruses that have been difficult or impossible to cultivate in vitro. During an outbreak of nonbacterial gastroenteritis (NBG) in Norwalk, Ohio in 1971, Kapikian and coworkers reacted stool filtrate with convalescent serum from a diseased volunteer and observed 27-nm particles in aggregates surrounded by clumped antibodies (28) . Subsequently, it was found that certain individuals with NBG develop serologic evidence of infection detectable by IEM. IEM methods were also used to demonstrate experimental infection (46), and further outbreaks of human disease were identified by related agents from Hawaii and Maryland (47). Several other agents resembling the Norwalk virus in morphology have been identified, and their relationship to the Norwalk group has been studied by IEM. Brandt and coworkers (14) have recently compared direct EM, IEM, and enzyme immunoassay for the detection of viruses in feces and rectal swabs. Used with commercial gamma globulin, IEM had a distinct advantage with all viruses detected in rectal swabs and small 27-nm particles in feces, but added little to increase the number of rotaviruses or adenoviruses viewed in stool. The relationship between hepatitis A virus (27-nm particles) and infectious, non-B viral hepatitis was uncovered using similar IEM techniques (31) . Coproantibodies A and M to hepatitis A virus, a~ well as the virus itself, have been detected in the feces of a small percentage of patients within 10 days of clinical hepatitis (36) . The morphologies of hepatitis B virus and its markers (5) and rotavirus (22) have been studied using similar methods. Coronaviruses (29) have been rescued from cell or organ cultures and viewed under the EM by forming immune complexes with serum from patients convalescing from respiratory disease. The direct IEM technique has also been used for serotyping within major virus groups, including the papovaviruses (23, 42), picornaviruses (8, 15, 27, 43) and adenoviruses (50, 51).",

Dilutions of single or pooled reference sera were added to a cool molten solution of 1070 agar in microtiter plate wells. Formvar-carbon-coated grids were placed on the surface of the agar, and the viral specimens (1 or 2 microdrops) were added and allowed to dry. Homologous antibodies rapidly diffuse from the agar to the specimen, and immune complexes are easily seen in the EM after negative staining. These authors have reported the SIA-IEM method to be as sensitive as the direct method and have used it to type other viral groups.",

Rotaviruses, adenoviruses, astroviruses, picornaviruses, parvoviruses, and coronaviruses were detected. In this study the specimen was dropped onto the agar surface and then picked up on an inverted grid similar to the AGD method. Using these techniques, Trepanier et al. made a comparison of direct EM with direct gamma globulin SIA and indirect ferritin IEM techniques on feces samples submitted to a diagnostic laboratory (48). These two approaches enumerated 25 and 103 more rotaviruses per grid square, respectively, as compared to the direct EM technique. Similarly, Lamontagne and coworkers (35) found specific IEM 100 times more sensitive for detecting rotaviruses and adenoviruses and up to 10 times more sensitive for bovine herpes virus.",

            "text": "Solid phase immunoelectron microscopy (SPIEM) was first described in 1973 by Derrick, who coated grids with capture antibody (CA) to plant viruses (17) . Milne and Luisoni (37) shortened and simplified the technique and incorporated a decorator antibody (DA) into the method. Shukla and Gough (44) enhanced the adsorption of plant virus antibodies 1o the grid by using staphylococcal protein A (SPA) as a binding agent. This method, with the addition of a DA, increased the sensitivity of detecting viruses in plant extracts from 7 to 68-fold. This technique without DA has been reported for the detection of rotavirus; it was 3.5 times more sensitive than direct EM of 25\u00b070 feces suspensions (40) . The following procedure was used by Giratdo et al. (24) for the rapid detection of papovaviruses: with the use of locking EM forceps, a drop of optimally diluted CA was placed on the grid for 5 min and then washed with phosphate-buffered saline. A drop of the virus suspension was added and washed after a 15-min incubation. DA was incubated on the grid for an additional 15 min. The final washed preparation was stained with 1070 uranyl acetate for 2 min before draining and drying. With this method, a 28-fold increase of virus particles over noncoated grids was observed, and virus preparations at concentrations of 102-103 PFU/ml could be detected. DA facilitated easier viewing, and SPA allowed the use of lower-titered CA.",
