            "text": "Bacterial pneumonia is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in elderly. We hypothesize that dysbiosis between regular residents of the upper respiratory tract (URT) microbiome, that is balance between commensals and potential pathogens, is involved in pathogen overgrowth and consequently disease. We compared oropharyngeal microbiota of elderly pneumonia patients (n = 100) with healthy elderly (n = 91) by 16S-rRNA-based sequencing and verified our findings in young adult pneumonia patients (n = 27) and young healthy adults (n = 187). Microbiota profiles differed significantly between elderly pneumonia patients and healthy elderly (PERMANOVA, Po0.0005). Highly similar differences were observed between microbiota profiles of young adult pneumonia patients and their healthy controls. Clustering resulted in 11 (sub)clusters including 95% (386/405) of samples. We observed three microbiota profiles strongly associated with pneumonia (Po0.05) and either dominated by lactobacilli (n = 11), Rothia (n = 51) or Streptococcus (pseudo)pneumoniae (n = 42). In contrast, three other microbiota clusters (in total n = 183) were correlated with health (Po0.05) and were all characterized by more diverse profiles containing higher abundances of especially Prevotella melaninogenica, Veillonella and Leptotrichia. For the remaining clusters (n = 99), the association with health or disease was less clear. A decision tree model based on the relative abundance of five bacterial community members in URT microbiota showed high specificity of 95% and sensitivity of 84% (89% and 73%, respectively, after cross-validation) for differentiating pneumonia patients from healthy individuals. These results suggest that pneumonia in elderly and young adults is associated with dysbiosis of the URT microbiome with bacterial overgrowth of single species and absence of distinct anaerobic bacteria. Whether the observed microbiome changes are a cause or a consequence of the development of pneumonia or merely coincide with disease status remains a question for future research.",

Immunosenescence, defined as age-related deterioration of both innate and adaptive immunity, seems to impair elderly individuals to elicit effective immune responses against invading pathogens, at least partly explaining their vulnerability to LRTI .",

Typically, this pathogen populates the upper respiratory tract (URT) asymptomatically in coherence with a vast and diverse community of other potential pathogenic and commensal bacteria, fungi and viruses. In general, during health, the so-called microbiome is presumed to be at an equilibrium, providing beneficial functions to the host, such as pathogen resistance (Cho and Blaser, 2012) . However, acquisition of new bacterial or viral pathogens, environmental factors or immunological perturbations can potentially disrupt the equilibrium, leading to dysbiosis, pathogen overgrowth and dissemination, resulting in symptomatic infections like pneumonia (Bogaert et al., 2011; Dethlefsen et al., 2007) .",

Also, different microbial niches are studied (Sakwinska et al., 2014) and research is focused on specific risk groups like HIV (human immunodeficiency virus)-infected patients (Iwai et al., 2012) or patients infected with the pandemic H1N1 influenza virus (Chaban et al., 2013; Leung et al., 2013) . Nevertheless, microbiota studies in chronic respiratory diseases like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma suggests an important role for bacterial communities, both commensals and potential pathogens, in the pathogenesis of respiratory diseases (Hansel et al., 2013; Molyneaux et al., 2013) .",

Therefore, we investigated the oropharyngeal microbiome in a large group of elderly with pneumonia (n = 100) using 16S-based sequencing and compared this with healthy community-dwelling controls (n = 91). To validate our findings and to explore the effect of age, we sought to replicate our results in a cohort of young adult pneumonia patients (n = 27) and healthy controls (n = 187).",

Figure 4 Weighted Unifrac (phylogenetic) average linkage hierarchical clustering analysis in elderly and adult healthy controls and pneumonia patients. The weighted Unifrac distance matrix was used to construct a circle dendrogram including all 405 individuals; healthy elderly (blue branches), elderly pneumonia patients (yellow), healthy adults (green) and adult pneumonia patients (red). Adjacent to the dendrogram branch ends, viral data and information on disease severity are visualized and stacked bar charts show the relative abundance of the 15 highest ranked OTUs. Color coding: presence of influenza virus and non-influenza virus is shown in purple and orange respectively; dark purple/orange, virus present in moderate-high amount (C T -value o35 cycles); moderate light purple/orange, virus present in low amount (C T -value 35-45 cycles); light purple/orange, viral qPCR performed and tested negative (C T -value 445 cycles); white, no viral qPCR performed. Clusters (defined as more than four samples; bright) are designated by dotted gray lines originating from the center of the dendrogram. Groups of samples comprising less than four samples are shown opaque. Three clusters were significantly associated with health; these clusters showed predominance of Prevotella melaninogenica (IIIa and IIIb) and Leptotrichia (IIIb) or showed a balanced microbial community (VIII). Clusters that were correlated with disease showed high relative abundance of either lactobacilli (IV), Rothia (Va) or Streptococcus (pseudo)pneumoniae (VII). Cluster IV was most strongly associated with the presence of influenza virus (50%). Five clusters showed no association with either health or disease, these clusters showed high relative abundance of Neisseria (Ia and Ib), Actinomyces (II), Gemellales (VI) or Rothia (Vb). Per cluster, the mean relative abundance of the 15 highest ranked oropharyngeal OTUs and the residual bacteria separated by phylum is given in circle graphs that were size-scaled according to the number of individuals within each cluster. PSI, pneumonia severity score. pneumonia patients and with increasing age might be the consequence rather than the cause of infection. This could, for example, be explained by inflammation-induced acidification of the local environment of the oropharyngeal niche (Lardner, 2001) , which has been related to a reduction of members of the Bacteroidetes phylum and outgrowth of acidophilic species like lactobacilli (Duncan et al., 2009) . Therefore, new, preferably longitudinal studies should be executed to elucidate a possible role of the observed species in relation to increased or decreased risk of developing respiratory infections.",

Also our data did not seem to be skewed owing to antibiotic usage before admission, probably as a consequence of the restrictive antimicrobial prescription policy in the Netherlands. Finally, we were able to execute age-dependent analyses within the subgroups allowing for studies in both the general population as well as a major risk group for pneumonia: elderly age. Figure 5 Decision tree model to distinguish healthy individuals from pneumonia patients based on URT microbiota composition. On the basis of random forest analysis, seven variables (Prevotella melaninogenica OTU rank 5, Leptotrichia, Streptococcus OTU rank 8, Gemellales, Parascardovia, Prevotella OTU rank 20 and Veillonella dispar) were found to be most important in the discrimination between healthy controls and pneumonia patients. Measures of impurity (Gini-and information indices) were used to identify the most discriminative OTUs based on the random forest analysis. Subsequently, these OTUs were used to construct a decision tree model, which was based on the relative abundance of Prevotella melaninogenica, Leptotrichia, Streptococcus, Gemellales and Parascardovia. From the root of the tree, each branch represents a division of the initial group based on the relative abundance (shown in small font) of an OTU. The numbers (regular font size) neighboring the branches depict the number of individuals before each split. Adjacent to the branch ends are circle graphs illustrating the number of individuals (represented by the surface of the circles, colored by the study group they originate from) that are stratified by the prior split. Light green, healthy adults; dark green, healthy elderly; light red, adult pneumonia and dark red, elderly pneumonia. The numbers below the graphs represent the exact proportions. The combined presence and abundance of Prevotella and Leptotrichia appears to be the strongest determinant for respiratory health.",

Our healthy adult cohort consisted solely of parents of young children, potentially limiting generalizability to the general population. Nevertheless, oropharyngeal microbiota profiles in our young adult cohort largely resembled those observed in the Human Metagenome Project . Owing to the 24/7 setting, sampling was performed by multiple different caregivers in different hospitals and homebased settings, which could have introduced a sampling bias; however, we tried to prevent this type of bias by confirming our observations using within-group analyses.

We showed that pneumonia in elderly patients is not only associated with increased abundance of well-known pathogens such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, but also with Rothia and Lactobacillus. Furthermore, we observed an even more profound association between the absence of anaerobic commensals and pneumonia in both young and elderly adults. In addition, we observed an increased bacterial density in oropharyngeal samples of pneumonia patients in general, and decreased bacterial richness in elderly pneumonia patients, suggesting a dysbiotic ecological niche with lack of pathogen containment. Whether the lack of 'protective' bacteria predisposes to the observed imbalance and whether the resulting dysbiosis is part of the causative mechanism as posed by Dickson et al. (2014) , a consequence of disease, or an epiphenomenon, has yet to be determined.",
