            "text": "Background: Surveillance of winter respiratory viral illness has been carried out for nearly 30 years using a clinical diagnosis by general practitioners as part of the Scottish Sentinel General Practice (SSGP) network. Contemparaneous laboratory diagnosis has not been available previously. Objectives: To assess the proportion of influenza-like illness (ILI) attributable to influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and picornavirus infection during the winter season. To compare the influenza PCR data with serology of paired blood samples. Study design: Combined nose and throat swabs, from patients with ILI attending 15 general practices across Scotland, were submitted to the laboratory in virus PCR sample solution (VPSS). The extracted nucleic acid was tested using a multiplex reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay. Serological analysis was performed on paired serum samples using complement fixation assays. The rate of influenza virus positivity was compared with reports of ILI obtained from the SSGP network. Results: Of 240 samples received at the laboratory, 132 (55%) were PCR positive for influenza A virus. There were nine (3.8%) picornavirus and three (1.2%) RSV PCR positives, two (0.8%) were dual influenza A/picornavirus infections. Ninety four (39.2%) were negative for all viruses tested. Results on paired sera from 89 patients showed a rising titre to influenza A in 48 of the 57 PCR positive samples (84.2%). One PCR negative patient displayed a significant rising titre to influenza A. Virological data paralleled the SSGP data but was available at least a week earlier. Conclusions: Influenza A infection was detected in the majority of patients with ILI; picornavirus infection was also shown to be an important cause of illness. PCR is a rapid and sensitive method for respiratory virus surveillance. Serology is slow, insensitive and difficult to interpret at low titres.",

Rapid diagnosis of influenza will be required to enable early treatment. Reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is a more sensitive and specific method for the detection of influenza infection than virus isolation or direct immunofluorescence and can be used for rapid diagnosis (Magnard et al., 1999; Pregliasco et al., 1998; Stockton et al., 1998; Wallace et al., 1999) . Our data (unpublished) demonstrate that RT-PCR can detect up to twice as many influenza positive samples than virus culture and direct immunofluorescence combined. Multiplex PCR has been used to monitor the influenza outbreak in England and Wales (Ellis et al., 1997) . As respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was shown to be a significant cause of influenza-like illness (ILI), in a wide age range of patients, during the winter respiratory season (Zambon et al., 2001) , it is therefore essential to make a virological diagnosis to effect appropriate treatment.",

RNA was eluted in a volume of 50 l. cDNA was synthesised by reverse-transcription as previously described (Wallace et al., 1999) . Nested PCR was performed using primers which amplified regions within the genes for: (i) the influenza A matrix protein (Zhang and Evans, 1991) ; (ii) the influenza B haemagglutinin (Stockton et al., 1998) ; (iii) the N and P regions of the RSV genome (Stockton et al., 1998) and the FI subunit of fusion F glycoprotein (Henkel et al., 1997) ; (iv) the picornavirus 5 NCR (Andeweg et al., 1999) . TaqStart TM antibody (Clontech, Palo Alto, USA) was used to increase sensitivity and product specificity in both rounds of PCR (Wallace et al., 1999) . cDNA (20 l) was amplified in a reaction volume of 100 l containing each of the four primer pairs at 5 pmol/l and 3.5 mM MgCl 2 . PCR was performed in thin walled 0.2 ml tubes on a PE9700 thermal cycler (PE Applied Biosystems, Warrington, Cheshire, UK). After an initial denaturation step at 95 \u2022 C, 35 cycles of 94 \u2022 C for 30 s, 50 \u2022 C for 30 s and 72 \u2022 C for 45 s were followed by a final extension of 2 min at 72 \u2022 C. The second round of amplification was performed using an increased annealing temperature of 60 \u2022 C with nested primers (at 25 pmol/l) in a final volume of 50 l containing 2 l of first round product. PCR products were analysed on 2% (3:1 Nusieve \u00ae agarose, FMC Bioproducts, USA) gels containing 0.2 g/ml ethidium bromide. Product sizes of 767, 401, 334, 290 and 183 bp were expected for influenza B, influenza A, RSV A, picornavirus and RSV B, respectively.",
