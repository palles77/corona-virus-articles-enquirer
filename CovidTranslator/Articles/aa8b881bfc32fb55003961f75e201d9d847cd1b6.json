            "text": "The pandemic caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has resulted in several thousand deaths worldwide in just a few months. Patients who died from Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) often had comorbidities, such as hypertension, diabetes, and chronic obstructive lung disease. The angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) was identified as a crucial factor that facilitates SARS-CoV2 to bind and enter host cells. To date, no study has assessed the ACE2 expression in the lungs of patients with these diseases. Here, we analyzed over 700 lung transcriptome samples of patients with comorbidities associated with severe COVID-19 and found that ACE2 was highly expressed in these patients, compared to control individuals. This finding suggests that patients with such comorbidities may have higher chances of developing severe COVID-19. We also found other genes, such as RAB1A, that can be important for SARS-CoV-2 infection in the lung. Correlation and network analyses revealed many potential regulators of ACE2 in the human lung, including genes related to histone modifications, such as HAT1, HDAC2, and KDM5B. In fact, epigenetic marks found in ACE2 locus were compatible to with those promoted by KDM5B. Our systems biology approach offers a possible explanation for increase of COVID-19 severity in patients with certain comorbidities.",

ACE2 is a membrane protein required for SARS-CoV2 to bind and enter cells [6] [7] [8] . After binding, viral entry is facilitated by the activation of the viral spike glycoprotein and cleavage of the C-terminal segment of ACE2 by proteases like TMPRSS2 and FURIN that are readily expressed in lung tissue [9] [10] [11] . ACE2 is only moderately expressed in healthy lung tissue compared to the heart, kidneys, and testes [12] , but staining of lung tissue sections from adults with pulmonary hypertension has revealed increased ACE2 protein in the endothelium of pulmonary arteries, compared to healthy controls [13] . ACE2 upregulation has also been observed in animal models of liver fibrosis [14] . However, the reason for this upregulation remains unclear, and a link to other COVID-19 comorbidities has not been determined.",

For each study, we performed differential expression analysis between patients and control individuals (Table S1 ). By combining the p-values obtained in all the seven comparisons, we were able to identify 1,740 and 938 genes that were, respectively, up-and down-regulated in the disease (Figure 2a ). Enrichment analysis using these differentially expressed genes revealed several pathways associated with inflammatory processes, metabolism, and ER stress. Among the pathways enriched with down-regulated genes, there were \"vasculogenesis\" and \"regulation of Notch signaling pathway\" (figure 2b). The \"viral life cycle\" pathway, which describes the processes utilized by viruses to ensure survival and to attach and enter the host cells was enriched with up-regulated genes (Figure 2b ). ACE2 was included in this pathway, as well as 25 other genes (Figure 2c ). One of these genes is RAB1A. Rab GTPases are involved in the replication of many viruses infecting humans [25] , but have not been associated with SARS-CoV-2 life cycle yet.

ACE2 was expressed in 59% of cancer samples and only in 25% of adjacent lung normal samples (Figure 3b ). Among the samples expressing ACE2, the level of the gene was higher in cancer, compared to the adjacent normal lung tissue ( Figure 3b ). In another lung RNA-seq dataset, we compared ACE2 expression between patients with COPD and subjects with normal spirometry [28] . Again, the expression of ACE2 was significantly up-regulated in the disease compared to controls (Figure 3c ). In fact, ACE2 was significantly up-regulated in 6 out of 7 lung transcriptome studies ( Figure   3d -e), suggesting that patients who have COPD or PAH, and even people who smoke, may have higher chances of developing severe COVID-19.",

As we did not find lung transcriptome samples from patients with type 2 diabetes, we could not directly test whether ACE2 expression was increased in patients with diabetes, compared to healthy controls. However, our text-mining approach revealed that IL-6 and INS genes were associated with all the diseases we searched. The INS gene encodes the insulin hormone, and insulin is associated with the NAD-dependent histone deacetylase Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) [35] . We found that SIRT1 was up-regulated in the lung of patients with severe COVID-19 comorbidities in 4 out 7 studies (data not shown). Clarke et al [36] have demonstrated that, under conditions of cell energy stress, SIRT1 can epigenetically regulate ACE2. Others too have shown that non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may inhibit the SIRT1 deacetylase activity [37] , which in turn could impact ACE2 expression.",
