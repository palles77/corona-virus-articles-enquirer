This investigation employed the SST k \u2212 \u03c9 model to simulate gasper-induced jet flow with the use of detailed gasper geometry, and validated the simulation results using experimental data. The validated CFD results not only revealed the mixing mechanism of a gasper-induced jet with ambient air, but also enabled the development of two mathematical models for characterizing the jet development along the gasper axis and radial velocity profiles in the downstream region. Furthermore, these models enabled the prediction of the entrainment ratio at different locations along a gasper-induced jet, and this ratio was used to evaluate the impact of the jet on air quality in a passenger's breathing zone. The performance of the CFD model and mathematical models was evaluated, and the models were compared on the basis of prediction accuracy and computing time.",

It was reported that the number of passengers carried by air transport reached 2.98 billion in 2012 [17] . The International Civil Aviation Organization has estimated that this number will reach 6 billion by 2030 [18] . As air travel becomes more frequent, the issue of airborne infectious disease transmission in aircraft cabins has been addressed collectively by researchers from various disciplines. In particular, the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [24] and H1N1 influenza [5] in airplane cabins has suggested that the transmission of airborne infectious diseases could be associated with the airflow patterns in these spaces [20] . Therefore, it is necessary to investigate the airflow distribution in aircraft cabins in order to improve the design of cabin ventilation systems and reduce the risk of infection.",

Such a ventilation system creates large re-circulation patterns in the cabins, so that the air temperature and contaminant concentration distributions are uniform However, it was found that mixing ventilation could easily lead to the transmission of airborne infectious diseases among passengers [39] . In addition to mixing ventilation, researchers have investigated the airflow distribution in an aircraft cabin with other ventilation modes. For example, Gao and Niu [10] studied the distribution of air from a personalized ventilation nozzle and concluded that the personalized system could reduce a passenger's exposure to air pollutants by up to 60%. Zhang and Chen [39] also found that personalized ventilation could provide better cabin air quality than mixing or displacement ventilation without the risk of draft. Other studies [21, 40] also reported an increased comfort level when personalized air supplies were incorporated in the seat headrest and seat back. Hence, personalized ventilation has the potential to reduce the risk of airborne infectious disease transmission in aircraft cabins, while at the same time improving passengers' thermal comfort.",

            "text": "To investigate gasper-induced jet flow, both experimental and numerical methods have been used. On the experimental side, for example, Anderson [2] used carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) as a tracer gas to study the effect of a personal gasper on airborne contaminant transport in an aircraft cabin. They found that the gasper played an important role in overall contaminant transmission. Guo et al. [13] used an anemometer to obtain high-resolution measurements of turbulence parameters in a jet airflow field induced by a gasper. These measurements provided reliable airflow data, but the method was time-consuming. On the other hand, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) has made it possible to predict the airflow distribution of gasper-induced jet flow. For instance, Baker et al. [4] and Gupta et al. [14] used a circular outlet to model gasper outlet flow in an aircraft cabin. By simplifying the gasper geometry as a round nozzle, they significantly reduced computational effort required for their simulations. However, such a simplification may cause errors, since the features of round jets are different from those of annular jets, particularly in jet developing region [33] . Moore et al. [23] and Garc\u00eda-Villalba et al. [11] have used annular nozzles, but the geometry of the nozzles was not the same as the gasper geometry in aircraft cabins. You et al. [38] used detailed gasper geometry in simulating airflow in a mockup of a partial aircraft cabin with gasper on, but their study was more focused on the major flow in cabin. Therefore, it is needed to develop a CFD model that incorporates realistic gasper geometry, to study the flow characteristics of gasper-induced jets, especially in the initial development region of the jet flow.",

[8] , this study placed the gasper model (nozzle diameter D = 12.6 mm) into a cylindrical calculation domain with a diameter of 500 mm (40D) and a length of 600 mm (48D), as shown in Fig. 3 . According to Fan et al. [9] , this dimension is large enough for simulating a free jet. Since the geometry in this case was symmetric, one quarter of the geometry was used to construct the computation domain, as shown in Fig. 3 (a). The plane z = 0 was defined on the edge of the gasper's rotatable switch (Figs. 2b and 3a). The velocity inlet boundary was set at the gasper outlet (the red area in Fig. 2b ). The side and bottom boundaries of the calculation domain were defined as the pressure outlet, and standard atmospheric pressure was prescribed. A symmetry (zero-shear, no normal velocities) boundary was used for the two symmetric faces. All other boundaries were defined as no-slip wall boundaries. Independence tests were conducted to determine the size of the calculation domain. It was found that enlarging the domain to a cylinder with a length of 900 mm and diameter of 750 mm did not lead to a noticeable difference in simulation results. Hence, this further verified that the originally proposed size of the calculation domain was sufficient to provide accurate results for the gasper-induced jet flow. Fig. 4 shows the grid structure used in this study, where the grid sizes were non-uniform. The smallest meshes were used around the gasper nozzle (0.12 mm), and the mesh size gradually increased with distance from the gasper. A grid independence test was conducted by comparing the velocity profile along the jet direction with three different grid numbers (444,565, 1,445,920, and 2,914,101). As shown in Fig. 5 , the resolution of 1,445,920 was sufficient for obtaining a grid-independent result for the velocity profile.",

We then describe the use of the validated CFD model to study the jet flow characteristics. Fig. 6 shows the simulated velocity profile at different downstream locations. The velocity profile starts with double peaks, which were caused by the annular gasper outlet. The two peaks gradually merge to one peak. Fig. 7 (a) compares the calculated centerline velocity U c along the jet axis (z direction) with the experimental data, where U c has been normalized by its maximum value U max and z by the location of U max and D. Because of the Coanda effect [36] , the air from the annular inlet immediately attached to the solid cone. At a certain distance from the inlet, the airflow around the cone merged to a single stream. This explains why U max did not occur at the inlet (z = 0). The comparison shows that the modeling results agreed well with the experimental data, especially after the merging point (z = 3.2D) where the flow was more developed. The mixing mechanism of this flow is illustrated in detail in Section 3.2. This investigation also performed a self-similarity test on the peak velocity profiles in the region downstream from the jet. Pope [28] has discussed self-similar characteristics in turbulent round jets in detail. Fig. 7(b) shows U z /U c \u2212 x/x 1,2 profiles, where x 1/2 is the x location at which the z-velocity is half of U c . After normalization, the three profiles at the three different downstream locations collapse into almost a single profile, which strongly indicates self-similarity. The similarity profiles also matched well with the experimental data. Since the numerical model used in this study is able to predict the gasper-induced airflow with reasonably good accuracy, the model is considered to be validated.",

In particular, x 0.1 , x 0.5 , and x 0.9 were the radial locations where u 2 z 1/2 reached 0.1, 0.5, and 0.9, respectively, of the corresponding local maximums. The comparison shows that in the developing region, where a bellshaped jet dominated and had not merged towards the center, there was a \"dent\" at the flow center. In the fully developed region, the turbulence intensity profile was similar to that for a fully developed round jet [31] : the \"dent\" still existed, but it became significantly shallower. Overall, the CFD prediction of turbulence intensity agreed well with the experimental data, which further validated the CFD model for simulating the gasper-induced jet flow on the second-order flow characteristics level. The discrepancies between the CFD results and experimental data can be attributed to the assumption in the SST k \u2212 \u03c9 model that kinetic eddy viscosity is isotropic [15] , which is not strictly true.",

Fig. 9(a) illustrates the streamlines in the initial developing region of the jet. It can be seen that before the merging point, the flow was still developing and vortices were generated. These vortices indicate a complicated flow pattern. Thus, this region was more difficult to model accurately in Section 3.1. The formation of these vortices can be explained by static pressure distribution, as illustrated in Fig. 9 (b): before the peak pressure point, a positive axial pressure gradient maintained the reverse flow, which formed vortices, and the local minimum pressure location coincided with the centers of the vortices. In this investigation, the z-stagnation point was defined as the location at which U z = 0. In particular, the two z-stagnation points on the jet centerline were defined as z s1 and z s2 . The distance between them, z s2 \u2212 z s1 , characterized the size of the vortices that were formed; in this case, the size was 0.3D. The second z-stagnation point marked the end of vortices, and also approximately coincided with the peak pressure point, which was in good agreement with what the observations of Rehab et al. [30] and Chigier and Beer [6] . After the second z-stagnation point, the static pressure dropped so dramatically that ambient fluid was quickly entrained towards the jet center. This explains the increase in centerline velocity after the second z-stagnation point in Fig. 9(b) , and the expansion of the z-stagnation lines in Fig. 9(a) .",

            "text": "To characterize the degree of mixing at different axial locations in the gasper-induced jet, the CFD model was also used to explore mixing layer thickness development in the flow. As recommended by Pope [28] , the present study defined the mixing layer thickness as = x 0.1 \u2212 x 0.9 , where x 0.1 and x 0.9 are the radial locations at which the z-velocities are 0.1 and 0.9, respectively, of the maximum velocity at a particular z location. As shown in Fig. 10 , the normalized mixing layer thickness /D was plotted against z/D for cases 1 through 5 (for which the details are listed in Table 2 ), in order to determine the influence of gasper inlet velocity and opening size. Good self-similarity can be seen in the mixing layer thickness for different inlet velocities (U 0 ) and opening sizes (\u0131). The mixing layer thickness increased continuously along the jet axis, which can be explained by the spread of coherent structures in the flow [28] : when the gasper-induced jet was discharged into the quiescent surroundings, disturbances triggered and amplified the vortical structures, which merged into coherent structures; these coherent structures grew in size as they were transported downstream, which greatly enhanced the mixing process. The growth in the mixing layer thickness, however, was divided into three zones as the slope changed: zones 1 and 3 had the same slope, while zone 2 had a slightly lesser slope. The difference among zones can be explained by the transition from the developing region to the fully developed region in the jet flow. i Centerline velocity As discussed in Section 3.2, various cases were designed using the validated CFD model to explore the influence of inlet velocity and opening size on mixing layer thickness. The same set of cases was used to investigate the impact of inlet velocity and opening size on centerline velocity distribution. Fig. 11 (a) compares the centerline velocity profiles of the gasperinduced jet flow with three different inlet velocities. The general trends of the profiles are very similar. The results also show that, with the same gasper geometry, the peak locations under various initial velocities are very close to each other, which agrees with the experiments in Dai et al. [8] . Furthermore, a plot of normalized centerline velocity U c /U max versus normalized axial location (z \u2212 z peak )/D (Fig. 11(b) ) shows that these velocity profiles are closely matched with one another, especially as the velocity decayed along the centerline. This indicates that the flow characteristics after the peak location, where jet flow was more developed, tended to follow a more uniform pattern than in the region where flow was still developing. Fig. 12 compares the centerline velocity distributions and normalized profiles in Cases 1, 4, and 5, where the gasper was adjusted to different opening sizes. As with the uniform pattern in Fig. 11(b) , the normalized velocity profiles, U c /U max versus z \u2212 z peak /D, also collapsed into a single curve. The z peak values, however, were found to increase as the opening size increased according to Fig. 12(a) . This trend agrees with the results illustrated in Dai et al. [8] , and the rea- son might be that under the same initial velocity, a larger opening size led to greater fluid momentum from the gasper inlet, which pushed the merging point forward. Meanwhile, due to greater momentum at larger opening, maximum axial velocity was also found to be larger as opening increased.",

Thus, this study developed an empirical equation for the centerline velocity. As mentioned in Section 2.4, the flow developments before and after the merging point are completely different, and thus the centerline velocity before and after the peak velocity location can be modeled separately as a piecewise function. Before the peak velocity location, a cubic function was used to describe the velocity profile, which increases dramatically at first, and then gradually becomes slower as the location becomes closer to the peak location. Experimental data [8] was used for curve fitting, which yielded the normalized velocity profile Uc Umax = g(z) = 1.49z 3 + 2.31z 2 + 1.19z + 1.18, wherez = z \u2212 z peak /D. The centerline velocity starts to decay after the flow has reached its peak centerline velocity. Previous studies [16, 25] described the relationship between normalized centerline velocity and normalized centerline location in a round isothermal jet using a rational function whose denominator was one degree higher than the numerator. Similarly, the present study has proposed a rational function to describe the velocity profile whenz > 0. Fitting the proposed rational function with experimental data yields g(z) = 0.42z+1 0.12z 2 +0.37z+1 when.z > 0 In summary, the new gasper centerline velocity formula (GCVF) is",

The results indicate a strong linear relationship between U 0 /U c and z/D after z = 7D, and the straight lines share a common z-intercept: 0.2D. The relationship is independent of initial velocity, but the slope of the straight line decreases as gasper opening size increases.

Overall, the CFD method yielded the most accurate results, and it was able to predict additional flow features such as pressure and turbulence intensity.

The empirical equations also provided good predictions of velocity, as well as predicting the entrainment ratio in the developed region, although this method was not able to predict other flow features. The virtual origin model was the simplest and thus the least time-consuming method, and it was capable of predicting velocity and entrainment ratio in most parts of the gasper-induced jet region.
