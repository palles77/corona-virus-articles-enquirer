We performed complete genome sequencing on two EV71 (SZ/HK08-5 and SZ/HK08-6) and two CA16 (SZ/HK08-3 and SZ/HK08-7) strains from patients in Shenzhen, China. Phylogenetic, similarity plot and bootscan analyses revealed recombination between EV71 genotypes B and C at the 2A-2B junction, and between EV71 genotype B and CA16 strain G-10 in the 3C region for EV71 strains. A similar phenomenon was also found upon further gene sequencing with other EV71 strains. Recombination between CA16 strain G-10 and EV71 genotype A at the 2A-2B junction was also observed for CA16 strains. The present ''double-recombinant'' EV71 strains circulating in China and other EV71 subgenotype ''C4'' strains represent an additional genotype, D. CA16 strains should also be classified into two genotypes. This represents the first evidence for a combination of intratypic and intertypic recombination in EV71 strains.",

In recent years, rapid and sensitive molecular diagnostic tests such as reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) have been increasingly used for enterovirus identification and classification [3, 4, 14, 25] . In addition, a molecular approach involving VP1 gene analysis has been developed for typing of human enteroviruses [5] , which was in line with a previous study showing a high correlation between molecular typing and serotyping for enteroviruses [27] . EV71 is further classified into three genotypes, A, B and C, based on VP1 gene sequence analysis [3] . The prototype strain, BrCr, is the only member of genotype A. Most EV71 strains belong to genotype B (containing subgenotypes B1-B5) or C (containing subgenotypes C1-C5) [4, 13] . Other regions, including the 5 0 non-coding region (5 0 NCR) [1, 33] and VP4 [4, 8] of the EV71 genome have also been used for phylogenetic analysis.",

            "text": "Mutation and recombination are well-known phenomena for enterovirus evolution. The infidelity of the 3D polymerase of enteroviruses makes their mutation rates as high as one mutation per newly synthesized genome [9] . Several studies have shown that recombination occurs between vaccine and wild-type poliovirus strains as a result of template switching during negative strand synthesis, which is thought to be mediated by a ''copy-choice'' mechanism [15, 17] . Recombination among circulating HEV-B strains has also been demonstrated [23] . A molecular epidemiology study of coxsackievirus A9 suggested that recombination among circulating strains may have occurred in the non-structural region of the genome [29] . Recently, intratypic recombination between EV71 genotypes B and C was shown to occur in one EV71 isolate (N3340-TW-02) from Taiwan [12] . In addition to recombination among enteroviruses of the same type, intertypic recombination between EV71 subgenotype C2 and CA16 strain G-10 has also occurred in two EV71 isolates (SHZH98 and SHZH03) from China, and between CA16 strain G-10 and EV71 genotype A in one CA16 isolate (Tainan/5079/98) from Taiwan [35] . In China, 83,344 cases were reported in HFMD outbreaks in 2007, while 488,955 cases with 126 deaths were confirmed in HFMD outbreaks in 2008 [26] . Since EV71 and CA16 are major etiological agents of HFMD, the dramatic increase in HFMD cases in China in 2008 suggested that these viruses might have undergone mutation or recombination. To test this hypothesis, the complete genomes of two EV71 strains (SZ/HK08-5 and SZ/HK08-6) and two CA16 strains (SZ/HK08-3 and SZ/HK08-7) from four different patients from Shenzhen were amplified and sequenced.",

The RNA was converted to cDNA by a combined random-priming and oligo (dT) priming strategy. The cDNA was amplified using degenerate primers designed by multiple alignment of EV71 and CA16 genomes available in GenBank and additional primers designed from the results of the first and subsequent rounds of sequencing. These primer sequences are available on request. The terminal sequences were confirmed by rapid amplification of cDNA ends using a 5 0 /3 0 rapid amplification of cDNA ends kit (Roche, Mannheim, Germany). The nucleotide and the deduced amino acid sequences of the single open reading frame (ORF) in each genome were compared to those of EV71 and CA16 strains with available sequences in GenBank.",

The clinical characteristics of these nine patients are summarized in Table 1 . All patients presented with HFMD, manifested by fever and vesicular lesions in the oral cavity, palms and in some cases, buttocks and knees. One case was complicated by acute encephalitis (patient 2) and two by acute bronchiolitis (patients 4 and 6). Leukocytosis with neutrophilia was observed in two patients (patients 1 and Enterovirus 71 recombination 1415 8). In addition to the two patients with bronchiolitis, chest radiographs showed mild diffuse interstitial infiltrates in four other patients, suggesting that lung involvement may be common.

            "text": "The present study demonstrates for the first time a combination of intratypic and intertypic recombination events occurring in EV71 strains associated with HFMD in children from Shenzhen in 2008. Both phylogenetic and recombination analysis of the complete genome sequences of two strains (SZ/HK08-5 and SZ/HK08-6) showed that their nucleotide sequences were most closely related to those of EV71 genotype C strains in the 5 0 NCR and P1 regions (Fig. 3a, b ) and the region upstream of nucleotide position 3600 (Fig. 5a) . However, a notable change was observed in the topology of the phylogenetic tree for the P2 region (Fig. 3c ) and the region between nucleotide positions 3600 and 5430 (Fig. 5b) , where their nucleotide sequences were most closely related to those of EV71 genotype B strains. This is supported by high bootstrap support for EV71 genotype B from 2B to 3C upon bootscan analysis, suggesting that intratypic recombination had occurred between EV71 genotypes B and C in the two EV71 strains, and the recombination site was possibly located at the 2A-2B junction. Results from multiple alignments of nucleotide sequences of the 2A-2B region of EV71 strain SZ/HK08-5 and EV71 genotypes B and C (Fig. S1a ) also demonstrated a recombination site located in the 2A-2B region, further supporting the findings of the phylogenetic and recombination analyses. Similar intratypic recombination between EV71 genotypes B and C has previously been shown to occur in one EV71 isolate, N3340-TW-02, from Taiwan in 2002 [12] . One of the recombination sites was located at the 3 0 terminus of the 2A region, similar to our two EV71 strains. In a previous Fig. 4 continued study on recombination in enteroviruses, the 2A region was also found to be a hot spot for such events [23] . In addition to this intratypic recombination, intertypic recombination was also found in our two EV71 strains by complete genome analysis. The apparent close relationships between the P3 regions of the two strains and those of EV71 subgenotype B3 strains (Fig. 3d) implied that the two strains were actually closely related to those of CA16 strain G-10, as EV71 subgenotype B3 strains were previously shown to be recombinants of an EV71 genotype B strain and the CA16 strain G-10 [6] . This finding is in line with the result shown in Fig. 5c , indicating that intertypic recombination has occurred between EV71 genotype B and CA16 strain G-10 at the 3C region. Results from multiple alignments of nucleotide sequences of the 3A-3C regions of EV71 strain SZ/HK08-5, EV71 genotype B and CA16 strain G-10 ( Fig.  S1b ) also revealed a recombination site located in the 3C region, further supporting the findings of phylogenetic and recombination analyses (Figs. 3, 4a, 5) . A similar phenomenon has also been observed in a previous study, in which intertypic recombination between EV71 genotype C and CA16 strain G-10 was identified at the 3C region in two EV71 isolates from Shenzhen in 1998 and 2003 (SHZH98 and SHZH03) [35] . However, none of the previous strains were reported to be the result of both intratypic and intertypic recombination events. In fact, when we performed similar phylogenetic and recombination analyses on previously reported strains with complete genome sequence available, strains N3340-TW-02, SHZH98 and SHZH03 were found to possess ''double recombination'' similar to that of our present strains. We speculated that the recent epidemic of EV71 infection in China may be due to the emergence of this ''double recombinant'' strain resulting from recombination between EV71 genotypes B and C, and CA16 strain G-10, which were present as early as 1998 in Shenzhen and spread to Taiwan no later than 2002. Partial 2B and 3D gene analysis of the other two EV71 strains in the present study supported our speculation. Further studies on complete genome sequence analysis of more EV71 strains from China are required to determine the prevalence of this ''double recombinant'' strain.",

            "text": "The present recombinant EV71 strains should be considered a novel genotype, genotype D, which requires sequence analysis of multiple gene regions for accurate genotyping. In the present study, we demonstrated recombination events between different CA16 and EV71 strains or between different genotypes of EV71 in our enterovirus strains, resulting in incongruent phylogenetic positions in different regions of their genomes. The sequences of the P1, P2 and P3 regions of our EV71 strains were most closely related to those of EV71 genotype C, EV71 genotype B and CA16 strain G-10, respectively. Hence, amplification and sequencing of only one gene region may lead to false conclusion about the true genotype identity. This is similar to the phenomenon reported for coronaviruses, which are also positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses, in which we have previously identified recombination between different genotypes of human coronavirus HKU1 in the generation of a new genotype [34] . Sequencing of at least three gene regions (e.g. VP4, 2B and 3D) is required to determine the actual genotype of these recombinant EV71 strains. In previous studies, EV71 isolates SHZH98 and SHZH03 were classified as subgenotype C4 based on phylogenetic analysis using the VP1 gene sequence only [21] . [36] . Sequencing of different gene regions or complete genome sequencing will reveal if these strains also belong to the novel EV71 genotype D. In fact, the reclassification of subgenotype C4 as a new genotype was also supported in a recent study by phylogenetic analysis using EV71 complete genome sequences [7] . In addition to the recombinant EV71 strains, intertypic recombination was also detected in two CA16 strains (SZ/HK08-3 and SZ/HK08-7) from Shenzhen in 2008. Both phylogenetic and recombination analysis showed that the nucleotide sequences of the two CA16 strains were most closely related to those of CA16 strain G-10 in the 5 0 NCR and P1 regions, but to those of EV71 genotype A strain BrCr in the P2 and P3 regions, suggesting that intertypic recombination had occurred between CA16 strain G-10 and EV71 genotype A. This is in line with a previous report of a similar recombination event between CA16 strain G-10 and EV71 genotype A in one CA16 isolate (Tainan/5079/98), where the site of crossover was located within a 166-bp region between nucleotide positions 3616 and 3781 in the 2A-2B region [35] . Based on the present phylogenetic analysis, CA16 strains should be divided into two genotypes, A and B. For the 5 0 NCR and P1 region, our two CA16 recombinant strains, together with shzh00-1, shzh05-1, GZ08 and Tainan/5079/98, were most closely related to the CA16 strains G-10 and FY18. However, for the P2 and P3 regions, the former CA16 strains were more closely related to EV71 genotype A strain BrCr than CA16 strains G-10 and FY18. Therefore, we propose that CA16 strains G-10 and FY18 should be classified as genotype A, and the remaining CA16 strains should be classified as genotype B. Sequencing of at least two gene regions (5 0 NCR or P1 and P2 or P3) is needed to differentiate between the two genotypes of CA16.",

Our present findings are in line with a previous study demonstrating that several recombination breakpoints were located within the P2 and P3 regions of enteroviruses of same species, while no breakpoint was found within the P1 region by genomic analysis [30] . Other studies have also shown recombination sites located within non-structural regions, such as 2A in EV11/EV19 [24] , 2B in coxsackievirus B4 [22] , and 2C in echovirus 9/18 [2] . One possible reason for frequent detection of recombination sites within non-structural regions of the enterovirus genome is that non-structural regions are more homologous than capsid regions among enteroviruses of the same species. Instead, mutation rather than recombination frequently occurred in the capsid region of enteroviruses, particularly in VP1, which bears most of the motifs essential for interaction with antibodies and the host-cell receptor, and these result from evasion of host immune attack. The combination of mutations in the P1 region and recombination in the P2 and P3 regions of the enterovirus genome is probably important for the generation of the high diversity of enteroviruses circulating in the human population. This unique mechanism for generation of novel enterovirus genotypes may allow for the emergence of new strains and new epidemics.",

In addition, the amino acid residues 'RAGLVGEIDLPLEGTTNP', which have been predicted to comprise the immunogenic BC loop in the VP1 sequences of EV71 strains [28, 31] , were also present in our two EV71 strains.
