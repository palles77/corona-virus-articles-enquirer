The population is generally susceptible to this newly identified coronavirus 2 , initially termed 2019-nCoV and subsequently SARS-CoV-2. Early efforts have focused on describing the clinical characteristics and outcomes of Covid-19 in the general population 1, 3, 4 . However, the disease appears to be particularly impactful in special populations that include those older than sixty-five years of age 5 . Pregnant women are also considered to be a special population group because of the unique 'immune suppression' caused by pregnancy 6 . The immunologic and physiologic changes might make pregnant women at higher risk of severe illness or mortality with Covid-19, compared with the general public. However, there is little information on Covid-19 during pregnancy. This study aimed to determine the clinical features and the maternal and neonatal outcomes of pregnant women with Covid-19.",

These preventive measures should have decreased the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission through the respiratory system of the mother, medical staff, and hospital environment. Second, previous studies have shown that ACE2 is expressed by the human endometrium and placenta 19, 20 . A recent study revealed that ACE2 is highly expressed in maternal-fetal interface cells, including stromal cells and perivascular cells of decidua, and cytotrophoblast and syncytiotrophoblast in placenta 21 . Thus, SARS-CoV-2 may also be attracted to the human endometrium and placenta though ACE2, causing vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Also, the SARS-CoV-2 has been detected in urine and stool 22 , suggesting a possibility of ascending infection of the uterus, placenta, and fetus. Third, it has been reported that the ACE2-expressing cell ratio is variable between individuals, which may explain why some people are more vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 14 . This characteristic of ACE2 may explain why SARS-CoV-2 infected only one out of 26 newborns.",

This limited information suggests that the newborns may generally be resistant to infection with SAR-Cov-2 and, if infected, likely not suffer from significant consequences.

Our experience showed that SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy might not be associated with as adverse neonatal outcomes as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infection during pregnancy. The clinical features of Covid-19 in pregnant women has not yet been reported. In this study, we report some clinical features of pregnant women with Covid-19: First, four (12.1%) pregnant women had no apparent symptoms during hospitalization. However, they were positive for SARS-CoV-2 by the real-time RT-PCR assay. This finding suggests that there are some asymptomatic carriers of SARS-CoV-2 during pregnancy. Because asymptomatic carriers of SARS-CoV-2 may transmit virus 23 , we recommend that all pregnant women should be tested for SARS-CoV-2 during the Covid-19 outbreak. Second, in our study, five women delivered babies by vaginal birth, and their newborns were negative for SARS-CoV-2. This finding implies that vaginal delivery may not increase the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission to newborns. Therefore, Covid-19 should not be the sole indication for the cesarean section.The timing and mode of delivery should depend on the gestational age, the maternal and fetal condition.",
