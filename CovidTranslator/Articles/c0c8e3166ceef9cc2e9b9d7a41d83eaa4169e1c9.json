            "text": "Abstraet--A battery of in vitro and in vivo tests were conducted on HCFC-141b as a vapour. Bacterial gene mutation assays with Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium were negative in all tester strains. In vitro chromosomal aberration assays were positive on CHO cells but negative on human lymphocytes. Moreover, HCFC-141b was negative in vivo in a mouse micronucleus inhalation assay. On the basis of these data and previously reported genotoxicity testing, HCFC-141b is considered non-genotoxic. Groups of 80 male and 80 female Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed, by inhalation (6 hr/day, 5 days/wk) to vapours of HCFC-141b for 104 wk at target concentrations of 0 (control), 1500, 5000 and 20,000 ppm (increased from 15,000ppm after 17wk of exposure). No exposure-related effects of toxicological significance were noted with respect to survival, clinical signs, ophthalmoscopy, haematology, clinical chemistry, urinalysis or organ weight analysis. Reduced food intake and body weight gain were noted in both sexes of the 15,000 ppm group during the first 16 wk; thereafter, body weight gains in all groups were similar although the intergroup differences in body weight remained evident. Reduced food intake persisted in both sexes through wk 52 and in females during the second year of exposure. Treatmentrelated effects on macroscopic pathology were confined to increased incidences of testicular masses and altered appearance. Microscopic pathology examinations confirmed the testes as the target organ with findings of increased incidences of benign interstitial cell tumours and hyperplasia at 5000 and 20,000 ppm. The no-observable-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) was 1500 ppm. The testicular changes at high exposure levels were considered to be due to a change of the senile hormonal imbalance in geriatric rats and of little significance for the assessment of human health effects.",

            "text": "l,l-Dichloro i-fluoro-ethane (CAS No. 1717-00-6, HCFC-141b) is a colourless, volatile liquid (boiling point 32\u00b0C, vapour pressure 525mmHg at 2VC) with a faint ethereal odour. It has been developed primarily as a replacement for CFC 11 in producing rigid polyurethane, polyisocyanurate or phenolic insulating foams. Major uses of these foams include insulation of roofs of commercial buildings (either as foam boards or sprayed directly onto the roof), insulation foam boards for residences, residential cavity insulation or foam-in-place foam fill of surrounding walk-in or domestic refrigerators. A smaller potential application is as a solvent replacement for CFC 113 to remove soldering flux from printed circuit boards, precision cleaning of intricate parts and, when combined with a surfactant, for removing trace water from intricate parts. The Program for Alternative Fluorocarbon Toxicity Testing (PAFT) is a worldwide multi-national consortium of chemical manufacturers which undertook an extensive program of toxicity testing for HCFC-141b together with program for other potential CFC replacement materials. Because of the potential exposure during manufacture and use, the testing program included assessment of toxicity and ecotoxicity, as well as oncogenicity, genotoxicity and developmental/reproductive toxicity endpoints. The results presented here are confined to the genotoxicity and oncogenicity testing studies; other aspects of the program will be reported separately. The European Chemical Industry Ecology and Toxicology Centre (ECETOC, 1990) has reviewed much of the available information on HCFC-141b.",

Subchronic inhalation toxicity studies in rats (exposure for 6 hr/day, 5 days/wk) for up to 13 wk indicated a no-observable-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) of 8000 ppm. A minor reduction in body weight gain in this study at 8000ppm was related to slightly higher exposure chamber temperatures compared with the control chamber, owing to the use of heated volatilization generators (ECETOC, 1990) . This NOAEL was reinforced by a similar NOAEL in a subsequent 4-wk study (Hino et al., 1992) . Metabolism studies indicated that absorption does occur, but there was no indication of in rico metabolism (ECETOC, 1990) . Harris and Anders (1991) confirmed that HCFC-141b is poorly metabolized in the rat; the major metabolite was 2,2-dichloro-2-fluoroethanol, which was eliminated in the urine as a glucuronide conjugate.",

Exposures continued during wk 105 and 106 until all surviving rats had been randomly killed.

Inlet air and the HCFC-141b vapourcontaining air stream entered the top pyramidal section of the chamber through a dispersion device. The HCFC-141b vapour was produced by metering the liquid to an all-glass concentric jet atomizer surrounded by an integral water-jacket. The heating jacket was continuously supplied with hot water (80\u00b0C) by a thermostirrer pump. The vapour produced by evaporation of the liquid was swept into the chamber with clean, dried, compressed air. At the high exposure level this air supply was heated by passage through a copper coil immersed in the 80\u00b0C water-bath. The constant flow of liquid to the atomizers was achieved by the use of nitrogen top pressure to the three reservoirs at 20, 50 and 70 psig* for the 1500, 5000 and 15,000 (20,000)ppm levels.

It is not known whether the HCFC-141b samples used for these ECETOC-reported studies met the analytical criteria established for the majority of the testing program. The potential for abnormal impurities or high levels of expected contaminants may explain the isolated positive results noted in some of the earlier test results. ECETOC (1990) and IPCS (1992) also reported results of a hypoxanthine phosphoribosyitransferase (HPRT) assay with V79 Chinese Hamster cells exposed to HCFC-141b vapours up to 35%. There was no increase in the mutation frequency at the HPRT gene locus in the presence or in the absence of S-9. Furthermore, negative results were also reported in a DNA repair assay with E. coli (WP2, WP67 and WB71) exposed to HCFC-141b liquid phase up to 10mg/ml with and without S-9.

ECETOC (1990) and IPCS (1992) reported two additional chromosome aberration assays using CHO cells: one study gave positive results with and without S-9 with HCFC-141b vapours, whereas the other was, at most, equivocal after liquid HCFC-141b was incorporated directly in the culture medium. A second in vivo mouse micronucleus test was also reported to be negative (ECETOC, 1990) . The micronucleus test reported by ECETOC as well as the above-reported micronucleus test were conducted at sublethal concentrations high enough to induce overt toxicity signs in the mice, including nervous system depressant effects. There was no indication of toxicity to bone marrow as evidenced by alteration of the PCE:PCN ratios. However, HCFC-141b is likely to be freely distributed in blood and tissues, including the bone marrow, because it is a small two-carbon molecule that can easily diffuse from the blood to tissue compartments, as demonstrated by the rapid-onset anaesthetic properties that indicate that HCFC-141b crosses the blood-brain barrier.",
