The majority (79%) of patients initiated PT <9 weeks postsurgery; predominately lower-functioning women started at $9 weeks. For patients initiating treatment at <9 weeks, the curvilinear slopes of recovery were similar between sexes, although the predicted levels of functional status were lower for females than for males (P \u00bc .041).",

Modeling change in clinical practice using outcomes measures acquired through usual practice can feasibly and adequately serve to guide decisions in the management of THA rehabilitation.",

            "text": "Total hip arthroplasty (THA) is a successful and cost-effective elective surgical procedure frequently used to alleviate pain and dysfunction due to osteoarthritis. 1 The prevalence of THA has rapidly increased in the US 2 and the demand is expected to continue in the future. 3 Changes in the perioperative management of THA have resulted in decreased length of hospital stay, shifting the emphasis to postoperative care following hospital discharge. 3 After being discharged from the hospital, patients will often receive postoperative rehabilitation services in inpatient rehabilitation centers, or from home health agencies or outpatient physical therapy clinics. 4 An increasing number of THA procedures will likely lead to an increased use of outpatient physical therapy care. The economic impact resulting from the increased THA procedures will make it even more important to maximize the available rehabilitation resources and to show the effectiveness of rehabilitation options such as outpatient physical therapy.",

            "text": "Examining the pattern of recovery following THA and the factors associated with recovery is necessary to understand prognosis and to benchmark outcomes after THA. Benchmarking provides a means to compare groups and individual patients to the expected outcome. 5 The identification of characteristics that may influence outcome is also important to understanding and predicting the pattern of recovery. Controlled studies have found a link between sex and rates of THA recovery. [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] Compared with females, males have been shown to have better function immediately after surgery. This trend is maintained through the recovery period as the rate of recovery between males and females is similar. [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] Sex differences may be attributable to the patient deciding when surgery is necessary; women appear to be more disabled than men at the time of THA, thereby having lower physical function at the time of surgery. [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] Understanding the pattern of recovery after THA surgery can help answer questions patients often ask clinicians related to the recovery process, providing a timeline and reasonable expectations for patients. Establishing the pattern of early recovery after THA has been identified as an important marker to provide best practice services in the management of THA rehabilitation. [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] Little research has been completed evaluating the pattern of recovery following THA, 11, 13 and existing studies have been completed mainly in controlled research environments rather than in routine care settings, and they may provide estimates not generalizable to usual outpatient physical therapy care. Examining recovery from THA in usual outpatient physical therapy care has been difficult due to a lack of outcomes data collection in physical therapy settings 16, 36 and the lack of appropriate methods to allow the contribution of each patient's unique visit (time point) to be taken into account. At present there is no published evidence examining recovery after THA for patients seeking and attending physical therapy in a usual outpatient physical therapy care setting. The purpose of this study is to examine the pattern of change seen in patients attending physical therapy after THA in a usual outpatient physical therapy care setting and to explore the effect of sex and time from surgery to the first physical therapy visit as potential prognostic factors influencing postoperative THA recovery.",

The database contains basic demographic information about each patient (age, sex, onset/surgical date, and reason for referral). Clinical outcomes, including a pain rating and region-specific disability score, are collected at the beginning of each visit and entered into the electronic database. The Lower Extremity Functional Scale (LEFS) 17 is used as the region-specific disability questionnaire for all patients with disorders related to the hip at Intermountain Physical Therapy. The LEFS is a 20-item selfreport measure designed to assess functional status for patients with a variety of conditions affecting the lower extremity. Each item of the LEFS is scored from 0-4, with the final score expressed as a sum out of 80 possible e120",

If more than 30 days elapsed between visits, the episode of care was judged to be completed. Indicative of usual outpatient physical therapy practice, the patient's initial visit in physical therapy occurred at varying times from the date of surgery. Recovery curves constructed from the LEFS scores of patients after THA in a controlled research study 13 suggest that at 9 weeks postsurgery, the patient's rate of recovery slows and the patients appear to function moderately well, such that they would have no difficulty with light activity, but would still have a little difficulty with stairs, walking far distances, and with heavy activities. Therefore, physical therapists may expect patients who begin physical therapy within 9 weeks after surgery to have diminished physical function due to the natural recovery progression postsurgery; whereas those patients initiating physical therapy 9 weeks or more following surgery may be seeking treatment because their recovery is not progressing as anticipated. We therefore defined an episode of care with the initial visit occurring within 9 weeks (ie, <63 days) of the date of surgery as an \"early start\" in physical therapy.

The secondary reason was to investigate the relationship between sex and physical therapy start time. First, descriptive statistics (mean, SD, percentage) were calculated for the entire study sample, and for sub-groups of patients based on sex and physical therapy start time. The primary outcome measure was the LEFS score. We examined the LEFS score as a continuous variable. Further analyses exploring sex differences were completed using chi-squared (Fishers' exact for late start) and independent t tests for categorical or continuous variables, respectively. Variables meeting statistical significance (P <.05) were incorporated into the multilevel model. To evaluate the pattern of recovery from THA, growth curves and individual variations in the pattern of LEFS scores across the episode of care were characterized using a randomeffects multilevel modeld hierarchical linear modeling, which allows both the patient's rate of change and initial functional status to vary randomly. The use of a multilevel model allows repeated measures to be gathered over the treatment time by accommodating different time points between scores, allowing different numbers of scores between subjects, and accounting for the correlation that occurs with repeated scores. 35 An unconditional covariance structure was used in the basic model, with LEFS scores as the repeated variable (independent variable) and weeks after surgery as the dependent variable. To explain the variation in intercepts and slopes across individual predictors of recovery such as sex, age, and episode of care, early/late start time and number of physical therapy visits were evaluated. Following the basic model, a conditional analysis examined predictors of recovery, which were added as level 2 fixed-effect terms into the model. A growth curve will depict the predicted LEFS scores over time using the final conditional model. Statistical analyses were performed using Stata Statistical Software: Release 11 (StataCorp LP, College Station, TX). Physical Therapy after Total Hip Arthroplasty",

The results of this study suggest that in the clinics examined, the majority of patients attend physical therapy within the first 9 weeks after THA surgery, but there was a segment of patients who initiated physical therapy more than 9 weeks after THA surgery. The patients initiating physical therapy later (>9 weeks after THA surgery) had initial pain and function scores similar to the early-start patients, perhaps indicating that recovery was not progressing as anticipated. In addition, those initiating physical therapy later were significantly older than early starters, and the proportion of women that were late starters was 3 times that for men. Further research is warranted to explore the determinants characterizing why patients, particularly women, may be initiating physical therapy late in the recovery process and why these patients are well below the predicted level of functional recovery. In addition, investigating whether this trend can be established across different usual outpatient physical therapy practice care settings (ie, national level) would be an important next step for physical therapists.",

In our early start patient sample, there was an increased rate of recovery in functional ability, with similar levels of functional ability at 15 weeks, similar to the findings of Kennedy et al. 13 However, our study found that the recovery plateau occurred 16 weeks after surgery, compared with the plateau at 6-9 weeks reported by Kennedy et al. 13 Differences between our study and the previous report by Kennedy et al 13 may be attributed to multiple factors. First, using outcomes obtained from a usual clinical setting may have removed the selection bias that occurs when patients are part of a controlled study that includes an inclusion criteria and patient's informed consent, factors that may not translate to conditions seen in clinical practice. Second, during the study by Kennedy et al, 13 a near pandemic of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome restricted patients' activity due to quarantine procedures and led to loss of follow-up in some cases. Although the use of clinically gathered data in our study provides a generalizable sample of patients for those who attend physical therapy, it excludes those who are unable to pay for and attend physical therapy. Therefore, those with low socioeconomic status may not be represented in our sample.

Barriers in the availability and usability of outcome measures seen in research that examine postoperative THA recovery, such as the WOMAC 24 and Short-Form health survey, 25 are not in the public domain and readily available to clinicians. Advances in the recent literature 10 the present study have shown that clinically available and relevant outcome measures are available and feasible for clinical use. With the advent of EMRs and electronic databases into clinical practice, barriers that limit the routine collection of outcome measures may be alleviated, as these tools present the capability of aggregating data to facilitate the routine use of outcome measures in clinical practice. 30 In addition, there are advanced statistical techniques available that can be used to analyze the clinical data.

S T U D Y D E S I G N : Adults with THA were retrospectively identified in an electronic medical record PT database (October 1, 2004-April 30, 2010).

The intercept and slope have a negative correlation of \u00c00.4 across patients, so patients with higher functional scores show smaller average gains. Although men had a higher LEFS score at initiation, the pattern of recovery was similar by sex, with a steady linear increase over the first 15 weeks followed by a plateau in physical function occurring between weeks 15 and 20, as shown inFigure 2.",
