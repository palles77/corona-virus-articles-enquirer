            "text": "Anti-viral T cells are thought to regulate whether hepatitis C virus (HCV) and HIV infections result in viral control, asymptomatic persistence, or severe disease, though the reasons for these different outcomes remain unclear. Recent genetic evidence, however, has indicated a correlation between certain natural killer (NK) cell receptors and progression of both HIV and HCV infection 1-3 , implying that NK cells are playing a role in these T cell-associated diseases. While direct NK cell-mediated lysis of virus-infected cells may contribute to anti-viral defense during some virus infections, especially murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) infections in mice and perhaps HIV in humans 4-5 , NK cells have also been suspected as having immunoregulatory functions. For instance, NK cells may indirectly regulate T cell responses by lysing MCMVinfected antigen-presenting cells 6-7 . In contrast to MCMV, lymphocytic choromeningitis virus (LCMV) infection in mice seems resistant to any direct anti-viral effects of NK cells 5, 8 . Here the roles of NK cells in regulating T cell-dependent viral persistence and immunopathology were examined in mice infected with LCMV, an established model for HIV and HCV infections in humans. We describe a three-way interaction, whereby activated NK cells cytolytically eliminate activated CD4 T cells that affect CD8 T-cell function and exhaustion. At high virus dose NK cells prevented fatal pathology while enabling T-cell exhaustion and viral persistence, but at a medium dose NK cells paradoxically facilitated lethal T cell-mediated pathology. Thus, NK cells can act as rheostats, regulating CD4 T cell-mediated support for the anti-viral CD8 T cells that control viral pathogenesis and persistence.",

Of note is that we did not observe the expression of ligands for activating NK cell receptors including NKG2D, NKp46, DNAM-1, and TRAIL on these early activated CD4 T cells, and NK cell-mediated elimination of activated donor CD4 T cells also occurred in antibody-deficient (\u00b5MT \u2212/\u2212 ) mice (data not shown), precluding a role for antibody-dependent mechanisms. Activated CD4 T cells did, however, express much higher levels of adhesion molecules than na\u00efve cells, and these molecules have previously been shown to trigger NK cell cytotoxicity via LFA-1 [19] [20] . Somewhat surprising was the observation that the activated CD4 T cells were far more susceptible than activated CD8 T cells to direct killing by the NK cells, even though both expressed high levels of adhesion molecules. We previously had shown that the presence of the negatively signaling receptor CD244 (2B4) on NK cells prevented NK cell-mediated lysis of activated CD8 T cells 21 . We found here that while expression of the CD244 ligand, CD48, was up-regulated on T cells after medium dose LCMV infection, expression levels of CD48 were much higher on activated CD8 than on activated CD4 cells (MFI of CD48: activated CD4, 3,423\u00b1147; activated CD8, 6,180\u00b1166; n=9, p<0.0001) (Supplemental Fig. 7) .",

The effect of activated NK cells on CD8 T cells and virus clearance appeared to be indirect, and depended on the presence of CD4 T cells, which are known to produce factors that preserve CD8 T-cell viability and functionality [12] [13] [23] [24] [25] .

Moreover, we found no NK cell-dependent changes in the number and antigen-presenting function of splenic DCs during LCMV infection (Supplemental Fig. 9 ), consistent with our finding that NK cells directly regulated the T cells. A possible concern was that in vivo cellular depletion with antibodies against NK1.1 and CD4 have the potential to affect frequencies of NKT, \u03b3\u03b4 T, and regulatory T cells, but the frequencies of these lymphocytes in the spleen of LCMV-infected mice were not altered after 3 to 4 days of infection by the low concentration of anti-NK1.1 used in these studies (Supplemental Figs. 1  & 10) . Moreover, depletion of NK cells in \u03b3\u03b4 T cell-deficient (TCR\u03b4 \u2212/\u2212 ) and NK T celldeficient (CD1d \u2212/\u2212 ) mice during medium dose infection enhanced LCMV-specific T cell responses and reduced viral loads (Supplemental Fig. 9 ), similar to that in WT mice. Therefore, these lymphocyte lineages appear dispensable for NK cell immunoregulatory function during LCMV infection.",

We show here that at a high dose of LCMV NK cells act beneficially by suppressing T cell responses, thereby preventing severe pathology and mortality while enabling the development of a persistent infection from which mice eventually recover and clear virus 27 . At the medium dose inoculum, NK cell suppression of T cells is detrimental to the host, as virus clearance is impaired due to the limited number and functionality of T cells. However, a medium dose of virus is not sufficient for complete clonal exhaustion of T cells, ultimately resulting in severe T celldependent immunopathology that can lead to death of the host.",

Cells were stimulated for 5 hours at 37\u00b0C with either 1 \u00b5M viral peptide or 2.5 \u00b5g/mL anti-CD3 mAb in the presence of brefeldin A and 0.2 U/mL rhIL-2. Stimulated cells were then pre-incubated with a 1:200 dilution of Fc Block (2.4G2) in FACS buffer (HBBS, 2% FCS, 0.1% NaN 3 ) and stained for 20 min at 4\u00b0C with various combinations of fluorescently tagged mAbs. After washing, cells were permeabilized using BD Cytofix/Cytoperm solution and then stained in BD Permwash using mAbs specific for various cytokines. AnnexinV staining was performed in azide-free FACS buffer directly ex vivo according to manufacture's instructions (BD Biosciences).",
