            "text": "We have previously shown that immunotherapy directed against the protein Nogo-A leads to recovery on a skilled forelimb reaching task in rats after sensorimotor cortex stroke, which correlated with axonal and dendritic plasticity. Here we investigated anti-Nogo-A immunotherapy as an intervention to improve performance on a spatial memory task in aged rats after stroke, and whether cognitive recovery was correlated with structural plasticity. Aged rats underwent a unilateral distal permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion and one week later were treated with an anti-Nogo-A or control antibody. Nine weeks post-stroke, treated rats and normal aged rats were tested on the Morris water maze task. Following testing rats were sacrificed and brains processed for the Golgi-Cox method. Hippocampal CA3 and CA1 pyramidal and dentate gyrus granule cells were examined for dendritic length and number of branch segments, and CA3 and CA1 pyramidal cells were examined for spine density and morphology. Anti-Nogo-A immunotherapy given one week following stroke in aged rats improved performance on the reference memory portion of the Morris water maze task. However, this improved performance was not correlated with structural changes in the hippocampal neurons examined. Our finding of improved performance on the Morris water maze in aged rats after stroke and treatment with anti-Nogo-A immunotherapy demonstrates the promising therapeutic potential for anti-Nogo-A immunotherapy to treat cognitive deficits after stroke. The identification of sites of axonal and dendritic plasticity in the aged brain after stroke and treatment with anti-Nogo-A immunotherapy is still under investigation.",

Such brain damage often results in long-term neurological deficits in various functions including cognition. The risk of stroke increases with age [27] , and in the elderly population more advanced age is associated with greater disability after ischemic stroke [21] . This is thought to be due at least in part to the differential response of the aged brain to ischemia, including increased neuronal degeneration and apoptosis [36] , faster onset of inflammation and scar formation [3] , and increased DNA damage and oxidative stress [25, for review see 37] . Therefore, in order to best investigate the therapeutic potential of emerging therapies for stroke recovery, using the appropriate age group in animal models of stroke is important and recommended by the Stroke Therapy Academic Industry Roundtable (STAIR) [1] and the Stroke Progress Review Group [19] .",

The potent myelin inhibitor Nogo-A was first identified as a neurite growth inhibitory protein in vitro [8] [9] [10] 18, 38] and then as an inhibitor of axonal regeneration and compensatory growth and recovery of function in models of spinal cord injury [17] . Subsequently we have shown that anti-Nogo-A immunotherapy after focal ischemic stroke leads to functional recovery in a skilled sensorimotor test in adult and aged rats [30, 33, 40, 41] . The functional recovery in adult rats was correlated with axonal compensatory growth [30, 33, 40] , and increased dendritic arborization and spine density in the contralesional sensorimotor cortex [34] , indicating that recovery of sensorimotor function after cortical injury may be achieved by dis-inhibiting sprouting in axons and dendrites by strategies to neutralize the Nogo-A protein.",

In fact, the stroke/anti-Nogo-A antibody group was indistinguishable from the normal aged group (p=0.1573), while the rate at which the stroke/ control antibody group acquired the hidden platform location was slower than the normal aged group (p<0.001). These findings were supported by analyzing the distance the rats took to locate the hidden platform. At the start of the place task animals in all groups swam similar distances to locate the platform (p= 0.2122; Fig. 1E , E'). As testing continued the rate at which rats in the stroke/anti-Nogo-A antibody group acquired the hidden platform location was faster than the stroke/control antibody group (p<0.001). However, both stroke groups had slower rates to acquire the hidden platform location than the normal aged group (p<0.01 for stroke/ anti-Nogo-A antibody, p<0.001 for stroke/control antibody). Taken together, these results indicate that rats in the stroke/anti-Nogo-A antibody group acquired the hidden platform location faster than rats in the stroke/control antibody group.",

The results from the Morris water maze could potentially be confounded if the animals had gross motor deficits from the stroke lesion. However, no differences in swim velocity were detected between groups arguing against gross motor deficits as a confounding variable. By observation these animals did not appear to have motor deficits after stroke and they ambulated, fed, groomed and swam without difficulty.

The acquisition of this procedural information during the place task could have then affected the performance of the rats during the subsequent matching-to-place task.

Furthermore, improvement on a sensorimotor task has been shown in aged rats after stroke given anti-Nogo-A immunotherapy, although the recovery took longer to occur as compared to adult rats [30] . The sensorimotor recovery was correlated in adult rats with axonal sprouting from intact pathways across the midline into subcortical denervated areas [23, 33, 40, 42] , and dendritic sprouting and increased dendritic spine density in the contralesional sensorimotor cortex [34] . Further support for the role of Nogo-A in recovery from stroke is provided from genetic studies using knock-out models. Mice that lack the NgR or that lack Nogo-A and Nogo-B have improved sensorimotor recovery after a photothrombotic lesion to the sensorimotor cortex as compared to heterozygous littermates, and this correlates with axonal sprouting from intact pathways across the midline into the denervated red nucleus and spinal cord [23] .",

Several studies examining the therapeutic use of anti-Nogo-A immunotherapy to improve cognitive impairment in rodent brain injury models support our findings. In an experimental model of traumatic brain injury (TBI) adult rats that sustained a lateral fluid percussion injury and treatment with anti-Nogo-A immunotherapy starting 24 hours post-injury showed improved performance on the Morris water maze place task [24, 29] . In that study, rats with TBI given anti-Nogo-A immunotherapy had a higher expression of growth-associated protein-43 (GAP-43) in CA1 of the hippocampus as compared to rats with TBI and treated with control antibody [29] . The higher levels of GAP-43 suggest that anti-Nogo-A immunotherapy may enhance the axonal growth potential of the hippocampus after TBI. Additionally, in a cortical aspiration lesion model of severe neglect adult rats showed improvement from neglect when treated with anti-Nogo-A immunotherapy immediately following injury. These behavioral improvements could be abolished causing the rats to once again exhibit severe neglect by severing the corpus callosum, demonstrating the importance of the contralateral hemisphere in the behavioral recovery [5] . Interestingly, genetically modified unlesioned mice that lack Nogo-A have normal spatial memory on the Morris water maze, but have enhanced motor coordination and balance as compared to heterozygous littermates [43] . Our study adds to the growing body of literature of cognitive recovery with anti-Nogo-A immunotherapy by using the clinically relevant age group and time of treatment.",

            "text": "Due to the importance of the hippocampus for performance of spatial memory tasks [14] , and the correlation of anti-Nogo-A immunotherapy with dendritic sprouting [34] , we investigated whether the improved performance we found in the spatial reference memory task with anti-Nogo-A immunotherapy post-stroke would correlate with structural changes in the hippocampus. However, we found no differences in dendritic branching of CA3 and CA1 pyramidal and dentate gyrus granule cells, and no differences in spine density and morphology in CA3 and CA1 pyramidal cells between rats with stroke given anti-Nogo-A immunotherapy or given control antibody. This could be explained in several ways. First, morphological axonal or dendritic changes in brain areas other than the hippocampus may underlie the improved performance in the spatial memory task after anti-Nogo-A immunotherapy. Performance on the Morris water maze depends upon a distributed network of brain areas [14] that have neural activity in response to place including the medial entorhinal cortex, striatum, subiculum and lateral septum [22] , areas which were not examined in this study. Interestingly, when rats received non-spatial pre-training to become familiar with the Morris water maze, blocking NMDA receptor-dependent long term potentiation (LTP) in the dentate gyrus did not result in impairment [39] . These studies suggest that, though the hippocampus is important for Morris water maze performance, other brain regions also contribute to performance on the Morris water maze. Secondly, although dendritic growth was examined quite extensively in CA3, CA1 and the dentate gyrus, we did not investigate axonal growth in the hippocampus raising the possibility that axonal growth may underlie the improved performance on the spatial memory task after anti-Nogo-A immunotherapy. Axonal growth in the hippocampus has been shown after treatment with anti-Nogo-A antibodies in cholinergic axons after damage to the septohippocampal pathway [7] , and in hippocampal slice cultures either intact or after cutting the Schaffer collaterals [12] , or perforant pathway [31] . Finally, we cannot rule out that nonmorphological changes affecting factors such as electrophysiological characteristics or biochemical composition of hippocampal cells, or cells in other areas of the brain important for spatial memory may underlie the improved performance on the spatial memory task after anti-Nogo-A immunotherapy.",

Aging alone also causes impaired performance on the Morris water maze place task [2, 26] . Despite the consistent demonstration of impaired performance on the Morris water maze after unilateral MCAO by us and others and the importance of the hippocampus for performance on the Morris water maze, MCAO does not cause gross histological damage to the hippocampus [44] . Here we show a decrease in dendritic complexity in CA3, CA1 and dentate gyrus neurons of the ipsilesional hippocampus. One study of MCAO reported an increase in the NMDA receptor subunit NR2B mRNA in the ipsilesional dentate gyrus, an increase in synapsin II bilaterally in the dentate gyrus, and a decrease in NGFI-A mRNA bilaterally in CA3 as compared to naive animals [13] , suggesting that unilateral MCAO can effect gene expression in the hippocampus. On the other hand another study found no significant differences in the CA1 subregion of the hippocampus in LTP, microtubule-associated 2 positive fibers, and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) positive cells between the contralesional and ipsilesional sides [32] . This study found no changes in acetylcholine levels in the dorsal and ventral hippocampus in rats after MCAO as compared to sham operated rats and intact rats. Therefore, unilateral MCAO appears to cause some structural and gene expression changes in the hippocampus.",

This suggests rats with stroke are using different navigational strategies during the Morris water maze task. Thigmotaxis is considered a maladaptive behavior because the hidden platform is never located near the wall. Increases in thigmotaxis behavior have previously been reported after permanent MCAO [13, 44] , and in aged animals as compared to adult animals [2] . Yonemori et al. [44] reported that thigmotaxis behavior was correlated with shrinkage of the caudate-putamen, suggesting that damage to the caudate-putamen plays a role in thigmotaxis. Our method of MCAO results in a primarily cortical lesion with minimal damage to the underlying caudate-putamen [34] ; however, it is possible that subtle damage to the caudate putamen underlies the thigmotaxis behavior we observed after stroke. These results suggest that although aged rats treated with anti-Nogo-A immunotherapy post-stroke are performing better on the Morris water maze than control antibody treated rats, they are not performing the task in the same manner as a non-stroke aged rat.",

(C) The stroke lesion size quantified in Golgi-Cox stained tissue, represented as percent of the intact hemisphere, did not differ between the two stroke groups (p=0.706, t-test). (D) Time to locate the hidden platform during the Morris water maze place task. Average curves of the fitted functions for each group. (D') Averages of the individual parameters of the functions. Time at the start of testing, or the y intercept, was the same for all groups. As testing continued normal aged and stroke/anti-Nogo-A antibody treated rats acquired the location of the platform faster than stroke/control antibody treated rats, as shown by the slope parameter (p < 0.001, likelihood based \u03c72 test of random-effects simple exponential two-parameter model, \u03b7(x) = \u03b8 1 e \u2212\u03b8 2 x , where x = day -1 [28] ). (E) Distance to locate the hidden platform during the Morris water maze place task. Average curves of the fitted functions for each group. (E') Averages of the individual parameters of the functions. Distance at the start of testing, or the y intercept, was the same for all groups. As testing continued all three groups acquired the location of the platform at significantly different rates, with the stroke/anti-Nogo-A antibody treated rats having faster rates to acquire the platform location than stroke/control antibody treated rats (p<0.001 for stroke/anti-Nogo-A antibody and stroke/control antibody, p<0.01 for normal aged and stroke/anti-Nogo-A antibody, p<0.001 for normal aged and stroke/control antibody, likelihood based \u03c72 test of randomeffects simple exponential two-parameter model, \u03b7(x) = \u03b8 1 e \u2212\u03b8 2 x , where x = day -1). (F) During the probe trial all groups equally preferred the quadrant that contained the platform during the place task (p=0.876, one-way ANOVA). (G) During the matching-to-place (MTP) task all groups found the platform faster on Trial 2 than on Trial 1 (p<0.001), and there were no significant differences between groups (p=0.4387 for trial 1, p=0.0550 for trial 2, one-way ANOVA). Error bars denote \u00b1 standard error of the mean. **p<0.01, ***p<0.001. Behaviors in the Morris water maze that were unique to rats with stroke regardless of antibody treatment. (A) Thigmotaxis, time spent in the periphery, during the place task. Average curves of the fitted functions for each group. (A') Averages of the individual parameters of the functions. Thigmotaxis at the start of testing, or the y intercept, was the same for all groups. As testing continued both stroke groups showed more thigmotaxis behavior than normal aged rats (p<0.001, likelihood based \u03c72 test of random-effects simple exponential three-parameter model, \u03b7(x) = \u03b8 1 e \u2212\u03b8 2 x + \u03b8 3 , where x = day -1 [28] ). Thigmotaxis at the end of testing, or the lower asymptote, was the same for all groups. (B) The path circuity or direct distance to the platform/ the actual distance swam to the platform during a trial during the place task. Both stroke groups had significantly more circuitous paths than the normal aged group (p<0.05, repeated measures ANOVA, Bonferroni test for post-hoc comparison). (C) Swim velocity during the Morris water maze place task did not significantly differ across groups (p=0.2476, repeated measure ANOVA). Error bars denote \u00b1 standard error of the mean. *p<0.05, ***p<0.001. Representative Golgi-Cox stained hippocampal CA3 (A) and CA1 pyramidal cells (B) and dentate gyrus granule cell (C, white arrows), and the corresponding Neurolucida tracings (A', B', C'). Images were acquired from the hippocampus of a normal aged rat. Scale bar=100 \u03bcm. Decreased dendritic arbor complexity of CA3 pyramidal cells in both stroke groups ipsilateral to the stroke (right). (A) Quantification of apical total number of branch segments and total dendritic length, and (A') apical branch segments and dendritic length in each branch order. (B) Quantification of basilar total number of branch segments and total dendritic length, and (B') basilar branch segments and dendritic length in each branch order. Error bars denote \u00b1 standard error of the mean. *p<0.05, ** p<0.01, ***p<0.001 for normal aged vs. both stroke groups, and #p<0.05 for normal aged vs. stroke/control antibody (one-way ANOVA p values reported, Student-Newman-Keuls test for post-hoc comparison). Decreased dendritic arbor complexity of CA1 pyramidal cells in both stroke groups ipsilateral to the stroke (right). (A) Quantification of apical total number of branch segments and total dendritic length, and (A') apical branch segments and dendritic length in each branch order. (B) Quantification of basilar total number of branch segments and total dendritic length, and (B') basilar branch segments and dendritic length in each branch order. Error bars denote \u00b1 standard error of the mean. #p<0.05 for normal aged vs. stroke/control antibody (one-way ANOVA p value reported, Student-Newman-Keuls test for post-hoc comparison). \u2021p<0.05 for normal aged vs. stroke/anti-Nogo-A antibody (Kruskal Wallis one-way ANOVA on ranks p value reported, Dunn's method for post-hoc comparison). Decreased dendritic arbor complexity of dentate gyrus granule cells in the stroke/control antibody group ipsilateral to the stroke (right). (A) Quantification of total number of branch segments and total dendritic length, and (A') branch segments and dendritic length in each branch order. Error bars denote \u00b1 standard error of the mean. ##p<0.01 for normal aged vs. stroke/control antibody (Kruskal Wallis one-way ANOVA on ranks p value reported, Dunn's method for post-hoc comparison). Apical dendritic spine density and morphology in CA3 and CA1 pyramidal cells did not significantly differ across groups. (A) Quantification of CA3 pyramidal cell dendritic spine density, and (B) CA3 pyramidal cell dendritic protrusion morphology.
