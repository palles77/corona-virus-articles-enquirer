            "text": "Non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) are an important public health tool for responding to infectious disease outbreaks, including pandemics. However, little is known about the individual characteristics associated with support for NPIs, or whether they are consistent across regions. This study draws on survey data from four regions-Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan, and the United States-collected following the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak of 2002-03, and employs regression techniques to estimate predictors of NPI support. It finds that characteristics associated with NPI support vary widely by region, possibly because of cultural variation and prior experience, and that minority groups tend to be less supportive of NPIs when arrest is the consequence of noncompliance. Prior experience of face-mask usage also results in increased support for future usage, as well as other NPIs. Policymakers should be attentive to local preferences and to the application of compulsory interventions. It is speculated here that some public health interventions may serve as 'gateway' exposures to future public health interventions. . Interviewees were selected through a combination of random-digit dialling (RDD) and telephone directory sampling, as was available in each region. Approximately 500 interviews were held in each region, and this information was weighted using a common weighting scheme, including age, income, number of people in the household, number of telephone lines in the household, and sex. The study sought and received Institutional Review Board approval, through the Harvard School of Public Health.",

Linear and logistic regression models were employed to establish the relationship between demographic and experiential factors and support for NPIs. The dependent variables (support for NPIs) were created from eight survey items. These eight items were grouped into three categories that were confirmed using factor analysis (see Appendix 1). The three categories were: support for basic NPIs; support for non-compliance punishment by arrest (that is, making an NPI mandatory); and quarantine location preferences (see Table 1 ). Ultimately, three main models were run for each of the four regions (see below). In addition, the same models were run for all four regions together, controlling for region, as well as for the three regions of Asia together, controlling for region.

Experts and policymakers continue to confront the potential emergence of novel infectious diseases with unknown characteristics (Morens and Fauci, 2007) . Although pharmaceutical interventions, including anti-viral medications and antibiotics, are a major component of the response to infectious disease threats, they may not be readily available or affordable, especially in lower income regions of the world. Moreover, antibiotics, antivirals, and vaccines alone may not prevent adequately morbidity, mortality, transmission, and the spread of disease, and they may have other limitations, such as with regard to resistance (Gani et al., 2005; Longini et al., 2005; Germann et al., 2006; Morse, Garwin, and Olsiewski, 2006; CDC, 2007; Nuno, Chowell, and Gumel, 2007; Davey and Glass, 2008; Kerneis et al., 2008) .

Compliance depends on public support, and the public may not comply with unpopular or unclear measures. Trust in public health officials and health professionals is critical for NPI compliance (Blendon and Benson, 2001; Quah and Hin-Peng, 2004 , Taylor-Clark et al., 2005 , Inglesby et al., 2006 . In addition, it is important for public health agencies to know which policies are likely to be supported under a given set of conditions or by certain subgroups of the population (Leung et al., 2003; Eisenman et al., 2007) . Infectious disease models often rely on assumptions about public behaviour and compliance with public health recommendations; data to support these assumptions, though, are limited. Better understanding of the predictors of NPI support may help public health officials, scientists, and policymakers to design preparedness plans, to construct models to predict the outcomes of different interventions, and to interpret experiences of public health emergencies.",

Most previous research employs simple descriptive and bivariate analyses to illustrate relationships between individual characteristics and public support. By contrast, this study uses multivariate methods and illuminates relationships between various demographic and experiential characteristics and public support. Consequently, it is possible to compare results across multiple countries and to address differences in support for voluntary versus mandatory interventions. The data were collected in the year following the SARS outbreak of 2002-03, permitting the evaluating support for individual NPIs, instead of the support indices. These models use identical independent variables.",

To create the information trust variables, a factor analysis was used that divided the five survey trust items into two groups, which are described here as public and private sources. Public sources of information include the media, physicians, and public health officials, whereas private sources of information include employers and family/ friends. Based on the results of the factor analysis, public sources of information may also be construed as more official sources of information, while private sources of information may be interpreted as more social sources of information. Each trust variable was developed by generating an average across the related survey items for each respondent, which was then modified into a binary variable (that is, those with higher levels of trust, as compared to those with lower levels of trust).",

The difference in NPI support based on trust in public sources of information in Singapore was 11.8 percentage points. In the case of Singapore, this result was driven largely by a single variable in the index: support for quarantine. Individuals with higher levels of public information trust in Singapore were significantly more likely to support quarantine than those without public information trust (odds ratio (OR): 6.83). There were no other significant predictors of quarantine support in that region.

When broken down into individual NPIs, disease concerns generally led to increased support for temperature screening only.

Even accounting for variations in the population characteristics themselves, this research indicates that public support will likely vary widely between regions. Immeasurable variables, such as culture, may provide the only explanation for this variation.",

The study's results did not reflect such a strong association. However, unlike the short-term perspective of many studies, the results of this research reflect perceptions about 12-month risk to self and family. While short-term risk perception should be captured by a long-term perspective, it is possible that perceptions of long-term risk have less variation across individuals than short-term risk (that is, risk perceptions converge). If this is the case, then the results would seem to suggest that it is acute risk perceptions, not overall concerns about disease, that translate into behavioural change. Furthermore, where significant results were not apparent, they were disease-specific and did not translate across all of the infectious disease threats (with the exception of Hong Kong and support for temperature screening). Jones and Salathe (2009) , in their analysis of the H1N1 response, suggest that certain risk perceptions (public health and otherwise) clustered together. The results of the current study do not show a similar clustering, but, again, this may be due to the long-term nature of the survey items.",

However, this is probably not limited to the issue of race in the US, since other types of minority populations are likely to express distinct needs and preferences and other regions may face similar heterogeneity. It is not news that public health policymakers and practitioners will need to make efforts to increase trust and to educate subgroups before events to secure more willingness to comply.

If NPI support can be influenced through introduction to certain measures, then it may be possible to expose populations to NPIs in advance of an emergency. The exposure of populations to face masks prior to an outbreak is a particularly intriguing option, since they are inexpensive and easy to distribute. While the effectiveness of face-mask usage is currently under debate (MacIntyre et al., 2009; Cowling et al., 2010; Tracht, Del Valle, and Hyman, 2010) , their usefulness may go beyond their direct role in disease prevention and instead be a way to increase population compliance with other NPIs, such as quarantine. The effectiveness discussion is largely scientific; however, an individual may perceive an experience of face-mask usage as 'positive' with a much more simple perspective. This could happen when he/she does not become ill or does not make the family ill when wearing the mask, or simply when he/she finds the wearing of the mask to be non-burdensome. If face masks were shown to be completely ineffective or harmful in the future, though, this could lead to a negative gateway experience, potentially reducing future compliance. In much the same way as hand sanitizers came to be widely accepted before H1N1, the correct usage of pre-pandemic exposures to public health interventions may create a more public health aware and savvy population.",
