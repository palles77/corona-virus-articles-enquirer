            "text": "Respiratory viruses are ubiquitous pathogens that cause acute respiratory illnesses in all age groups [1] . Viral pneumonia occurs most frequently at the extremes of agedin young children and elderly adults. When respiratory viruses first are encountered by children who do not have immunity, particularly during infancy when airways are small and immature, pneumonia may result. Although infection in older adults represents reinfection, viruses again become a more frequent cause of pneumonia because of immunosenescence and the presence of chronic medical conditions. Influenza virus is the viral pathogen that is most well recognized in older adults and is the cause of significant morbidity and mortality in this age group [2, 3] . In addition, several common respiratory viruses are implicated in the etiology of pneumonia in older adults ( Table 1) . Because of the fastidious nature of several of these viruses and imperfect diagnostic tools, the burden of disease likely is underestimated. Newer investigations using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and sensitive serologic techniques define the frequency of these agents in adults more accurately. Several other systemic viruses (see Table 1 ) also can cause pneumonia. Most are uncommon in immunocompetent older adults because of pre-existing immunity. Although viral pneumonia cannot be distinguished reliably on clinical grounds alone, some features can help clinicians judge the likelihood of viral infection and the need for laboratory testing ( Table 2 ). The focus of this review is on the role of the common respiratory viruses in immunocompetent older adults who have community-acquired pneumonia, with a brief mention of other viruses that cause pneumonia less frequently. Epidemiology, clinical features, methods of diagnosis, and treatments are discussed.",

In published series of adults, specifically the elderly, rates of viral pneumonia vary tremendously depending on the type of tests used, populations, and season studied. Viruses are identified in 0.3% to 30% of patients who have community-acquired pneumonia in studies using viral culture and serology for diagnosis (Table 3 ) [4, 5] . Recent studies using RT-PCR for diagnosis have improved the ability to detect viruses considerably [6, 7] . In a study of 105 patients who had community-acquired pneumonia, 50% of whom were over age 60, respiratory viruses were detected in 14% of patients using conventional techniques compared with 56% by RT-PCR [7] . In all studies of the etiology of community-acquired pneumonia, regardless of the diagnostic techniques used, influenza A is the viral pathogen identified most commonly, accounting for 4% to 19% of cases [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] .

            "text": "Influenza viruses are segmented RNA viruses that are classified as A, B, or C, based on stable internal proteins [13] . Influenza viruses A and B are the most significant human pathogens and are capable of causing serious lower respiratory tract disease, whereas influenza C generally causes mild upper respiratory tract disease. Influenza A viruses are classified further based on the two surface envelope proteins, hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N). These glycoproteins are the primary targets of neutralizing antibody. At least 16 antigenically distinct hemagglutinin (H1-H16) and nine neuraminidase (N1-N9) proteins are described. H1-H3 viruses currently are the primary pathogens in humans, whereas the others generally are found in other mammals and aquatic birds. As with most RNA viruses, influenza A viruses are prone to a high degree of genomic mutations during replication, which leads to minor changes in the H and N proteins. These changes are referred to as antigenic ''drift'' and account for seasonal influenza epidemics. Because influenza A has a segmented genome, two influenza viruses can exchange H or N genes, with resultant viruses containing a completely new H or N gene. This phenomenon is referred to as antigenic ''shift'' and may result in worldwide pandemics. During the past century, three pandemics occurred: 1918 (H1N1), 1957 (H2N2), and 1968 (H3N2). Currently, two type A viruses circulate (H1N1 and H3N2) and influenza B. H3N2 viruses tend to be most severe in the elderly. Partial immunity to H1N1 virus, resulting from exposure in the early part of the twentieth century, is postulated as a mechanism for milder H1N1 disease in this age group. In 1997, influenza A (H5N1), previously seen only in birds, crossed the species barrier and human infection occurred in Southeast Asia [14] . This highly pathogenic avian influenza has spread in bird populations throughout Asia and into Europe. To date, human infection is rare and transmission has occurred primarily by direct contact with infected birds. Transmission between humans is limited but the possibility of mutation allowing efficient person-to-person spread makes avian influenza (H5N1) the greatest pandemic threat since 1918.",

Epidemics usually last 6 to 8 weeks and can occur anytime between November and April, with highly variable severity. The virus is transmitted most efficiently by small particle aerosols generated by coughing and sneezing; thus, explosive outbreaks can occur in closed settings, such as nursing homes [15] . Influenza results in approximately 36,000 deaths and more than 200,000 hospital admissions in the United States every year [16] . Age-specific hospitalization rates resulting from influenza form a J-shaped curve in which rates are high in ages below 5, decline in ages 5 to 49, and rise significantly for those age 50 or older [3] . Rates of hospitalization rise significantly with each decade over age 60, rising from 190 per 100,000 for ages 65 to 69 to 1195 per 100,000 for those over age 85. Increases in mortality are more dramatic, rising from 19 to 358 per 100,000 for the previously noted age groups.",

Lower tract disease was classified into four categories: (1) no radiographic pneumonia; (2) viral infection followed by bacterial pneumonia; (3) rapidly progressive viral pneumonia; and (4) concomitant viral-bacterial pneumonia. Diffuse infiltrates previously were seen in patients who had rheumatic heart disease-associated mitral stenosis (Fig. 1) . Although age is a significant risk factor for the development of lower respiratory tract complications to influenza, pure viral pneumonia is uncommon outside pandemic settings in nonimmunocompromised hosts [18, 19] . Most elderly persons have partial immunity resulting from previous vaccination or natural infections. In a recent study of highly vaccinated elderly in the community who subsequently were documented to have influenza, approximately 5% developed pneumonia [20] . In a survey of 193 patients hospitalized with influenza A, approximately half (101) had radiographic findings consistent with acute disease [21] . Of these, 33% had definitive infiltrates, 45% had atelectasis versus pneumonia, 15% had edema, and 7% had edema versus infiltrates. Most infiltrates were subtle and unilateral and involved the left lower lobe (Fig. 2) . Documented bacterial infection was observed in 8% of cases. Pneumonia and progression to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and death are common with influenza A (H5N1). Limited microbiologic data indicate that this syndrome is a primary viral pneumonia. Unlike epidemic influenza, avian influenza to date is most severe in children under age 15.",

Among elderly outpatients, cough, fever, and acute onset of symptoms had a positive predictive value for influenza of 30% in contrast to young adults, in whom this triad of symptoms had a value of 78% [23] . The presence of gastrointestinal complaints, fever, and myalgias, with a lack of significant rhinorrhea and wheezing, may help distinguish influenza from respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), another common winter virus [24, 25] .

Because of cocirculation of several other respiratory viruses, however, laboratory confirmation generally is recommended. Viral diagnostics include culture, antigen detection, RT-PCR, and serology [26] . Nasal swabs are believed better specimens than throat swabs to detect influenza viruses [13] . Sputum, endotracheal secretions, and bronchoalveolar lavage specimens also can be used to detect virus. Viral culture is the time-honored technique for identifying influenza infection. Influenza virus is hardy and grows well in culture but generally 2 to 3 days is required for cytopathic effect to be evident. Thus, culture is of limited value for making therapeutic or isolation decisions. The use of shell viral culture can shorten time to detection to approximately 24 hours [27] . Rapid antigen testing is available for influenza A and B and offers immediate results. These tests offer a sensitivity of approximately 50% to 60% and sensitivity of 90% or greater in adults [28] . Because false-negative results are common, patients who have pneumonia and negative test in whom a high index of suspicion of influenza based on clinical grounds exists should be considered for empiric treatment. Molecular testing, such as RT-PCR, offers the best combination of sensitivity and specificity for diagnosis of acute influenza but is labor intensive, expensive, and currently not widely available. Most assays use primers complementary to the conserved matrix gene [26] . RT-PCR can be useful in patients who are immunocompromised. Because all adults have antibody, a single serologic test is not useful for the acute diagnosis of influenza. Serologic testing demonstrating a fourfold or greater rise in influenza-specific antibody can be used to make a diagnosis as long as vaccine effect does not complicate interpretation.",

Amantadine and rimantadine are active against influenza A, whereas zanamivir and oseltamavir are active against influenza A and B. These agents are 70% to 90% effective for prophylaxis and reduce illness severity, duration of symptoms, and viral shedding when given within 48 hours of symptom onset in uncomplicated influenza. Data are limited regarding the effectiveness of antiviral treatment of influenza pneumonia. The duration of patients' symptoms before admission usually presents a dilemma, because the average number of days most are ill is 3 to 4 days, falling outside the recommended 48-hour window of symptom duration for drug treatment [29] . Although no official recommendation can be made because risks and benefits must be weighed in individual clinical situations, many authorities believe treatment of patients who are antigen positive is reasonable because a significant viral load in secretions is needed to generate a positive rapid test. If a decision is made to use antiviral therapy, it is important to consider the type of influenza being treated (A or B), issues of drug resistance, and the possible adverse reactions of specific medications. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently reported that 92% of influenza A (H3N2) and 25% of influenza A (H1N1) were resistant to the adamantanes [13] . Although only a total of 217 isolates was tested, isolates were obtained from 26 states and for this reason, use of this class of drugs is not recommended at the present time. Zanamivir and oseltamivir are effective for influenza A and B and, currently, rates of resistance are low. Each antiviral agent has different side-effect profiles that must be considered in treatment selection (Table 4 ). Zanamivir is associated with bronchospasm and decline in forced expiratory volume in 1 second in some patients who have underlying lung disease and is not recommended for patients who have asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) [30] . Oseltamivir generally is well tolerated, although approximately 10% of recipients experience associated nausea and vomiting. The precise rate of bacterial complications of nonpandemic influenza is difficult to ascertain. Observational studies report ranges of 8% to 36% [31] . Physicians treating frail, elderly patients who have pneumonia and who have documented influenza face a challenge when deciding if antibiotics are needed. Decisions must be individualized based on duration of symptoms, patient stability, white blood cell count, and results of blood and sputum cultures.",

For many years after its discovery in 1956, RSV was considered strictly a pediatric pathogen; however, it recently has been recognized increasingly as a serious adult pathogen [20] . Human RSV is an enveloped RNA virus and is a member of the family, Paramyxoviridae, classified within the genus, Pneumovirus [33] . RSV can be classified into two major groups, A and B, based primarily on antigenic differences found in one of the surface glycoproteins but, unlike in influenza, major antigenic shifts do not occur. RSV is a predictable cause of yearly epidemics of winter respiratory illnesses in temperate climates and activity typically begins in late fall and generally lasts 4 to 5 months, ending in late spring. Unlike influenza, which tends to produce a sharp peak in respiratory illness over 6 to 8 weeks, the epidemic curve of RSV generally is broader.",

In a large study of approximately 1200 adults admitted to the hospital with a diagnosis of pneumonia, investigators found that RSV was identified in 4.4% of cases and was the pathogen identified third most commonly after Streptococcus pneumoniae and influenza [36] . A recent study of community-acquired pneumonia from Spain using a combination of diagnostic techniques found RSV to be the cause of 5 of 198 (3%) of adult patients who had pneumonia [10] .

Antiviral therapy with aerosolized ribavirin and RSV-specific immunoglobulin are approved for high-risk infants, but only anecdotal data are available in adults [32] . Although the general use of ribavirin cannot be recommended, its use may be considered in selected cases, such as for patients who are immunocompromised.

PIV-3 is associated most often with pneumonia in children [1] . Infection recurs throughout adulthood, accounting for 1% to 15% of acute respiratory illnesses with occasional reports of pneumonia in young adults. The burden of disease resulting from PIV in the elderly is not well studied, but pneumonia is reported [46] . Investigators in Sweden found that 11% of elderly persons who had communityacquired pneumonia had serologic evidence of recent PIV-1 or PIV-3 [47] . Prospective studies in nursing homes have documented PIV infection in 4% to 14% of respiratory illnesses and fatal cases of bronchopneumonia are described [48] . PIV also is implicated as a precursor to an outbreak of invasive pneumococcal disease in a long-term care facility [49] . Clinical syndromes, characterized by fever, rhinorrhea, hoarseness, cough, and sore throat, are not distinctive. Viral culture, RT-PCR, and serologic tests can be used to diagnose PIV infection. At the present time there are no commercially available rapid antigen tests. Ribavirin has activity in vitro against PIV but is not approved for treatment of PIV pneumonia [45] .",

The virus is shown to have worldwide distribution; by age 5, all children are infected. In temperate climates, the virus circulates predominantly in the winter months overlapping with activity of influenza virus and RSV. Several studies suggest there may be significant year-to-year variation in incidence rates [51] . Infection with hMPV in young children causes a syndrome similar to RSV, with bronchiolitis and pneumonia the most common manifestations. Asymptomatic infection, colds, asthma exacerbations, and flu-like illnesses are documented in older children and healthy young adults [52] . Pneumonia and exacerbation of COPD are documented in elderly adults; however, comprehensive studies have not yet been published [53] . In a 2-year study of elderly and high-risk adults, hMPV infection was identified in 4.1%, using RT-PCR and serology for diagnosis [51] . Twenty-five percent of patients hospitalized with hMPV had infiltrates on chest radiographs. Illness may be more severe in frail elderly, as evidenced by a Canadian study in which pneumonia was documented in 40% of hMPV-infected nursing home residents [54] . The clinical characteristics of hMPV pneumonia in older adults do not appear distinctive from the other wintertime respiratory viruses, although rates of fever seem higher than with RSV and are similar to influenza. Diagnosis of hMPV outside research settings is difficult. The virus has special growth requirements and cytopathic effect can take up to 3 weeks to be detectable [50] . RT-PCR and serology are used successfully in research settings and transplant units, but these assays are not widely available commercially. Similar to PIV, ribavirin has activity in vitro but is not approved for treatment of hMPV infection.",

Coronavirus lower respiratory tract disease is described in frail elderly attending senior daycare, where 66% of infected persons complained of a productive cough and 34% were short of breath [60] . In a study from China, investigators examined the frequency and clinical features of the newly described coronavirus HKU1 [61] . Of 418 patients admitted to the hospital with community-acquired pneumonia, 2.4% had evidence of coronavirus HKU1 by RT-PCR. All cases occurred between January and May. Of the 10 patients identified, eight were over age 65. Preceding upper respiratory tract symptoms were noted in only two patients. Clinically, illnesses were not distinguishable from other causes of community-acquired pneumonia. Two patients who had multiple chronic medical problems died. Another new strain of coronavirus discovered recently, HCOV-NL63, is found to circulate in summer and autumn and is associated with upper respiratory infection, bronchiolitis, and asthma exacerbations in children [62] . Little data on H COV-NL63 in the elderly exist. Nineteen of 525 respiratory specimens collected from patients who had winter respiratory illnesses in Canada were positive by RT-PCR for this pathogen [63] . Nine of 19 (47%) were elderly persons. Symptoms primarily were fever, sore throat, and cough. Most coronavirus studies to date do not describe radiographic findings; thus, the frequency of coronavirus pneumonia remains unknown.",

Patients at risk for HSV pneumonia include those who have immunosuppression, severe burns, AIDS, or trauma. Age per se is not a specific risk factor, but older adults may reactivate HSV because of any of these factors. Because the isolation of HSV is possible as a result of asymptomatic reactivation, interpretation of cultures may be difficult. For example, HSV was isolated in 74% and 65% of upper and lower respiratory tract samples in one series of patients who had ARDS; however, pathogenicity was unclear [69] .",

Focal pneumonia is attributed to direct spread or a virus from the upper tract with tracheitis or esophagitis to the lower tract from aspiration of infected secretion [70] . The disseminated form results from viremia and occurs in patients who are severely immunocompromised. Fever is common as are cough and dyspnea. Chest pain and hemoptysis also may occur and mucocutaneous lesions are present in all patients. Because oral lesions in the majority of patients are not associated with lung involvement and contamination of bronchoalveolar lavage, specimens from upper airway secretions are a problem, definitive diagnosis requires the finding of histologic or cytologic examination of lower tract specimen showing necrotizing or hemorrhagic pneumonia with viral inclusion bodies [70] . Infection is localized mainly to the trachea and large bronchi, and a thick inflammatory membrane and mucosal ulcerations may be seen. Endobronchial biopsy is preferred for diagnosis compared with open lung biopsy. Acyclovir is active against HSV and has decreased mortality in disseminated HSV and pneumonia in children; however, in adults who have ARDS, the benefit is less clear [69] . No controlled trials of acyclovir for pneumonia have been done, and risks and benefits must be weighed in individual cases.",

Adenoviruses, in particular types 4 and 7, are linked to large outbreaks of respiratory disease and severe pneumonia in young adults living in congregate settings [71] . In the author's experience, adenovirus is not a frequent pathogen in elderly adults. Human bocavirus is a newly discovered parvovirus [72] . The virus has been identified by RT-PCR in respiratory samples from children who have lower respiratory tract illnesses; however, no data are available in adults. Several systemic viruses, such as varicella zoster and measles, not uncommonly cause pneumonia when acquired in adulthood, yet are uncommon in the elderly because of pre-existing immunity. Hantaviruses primarily are pathogens of rodents but may be transmitted to humans by contact with rodent excrement or bites [73] . Cases are reported in the southwestern United States. Human infection results in a febrile prodrome followed by pulmonary edema and shock. Progression may be rapid, and laboratory findings include elevated hematocrit and white blood cell count with thrombocytopenia. Treatment is supportive. Although primary Epstein-Barr virus is uncommon in the elderly, when it occurs, clinical syndromes can be atypical and pneumonia is described [74] .",

Influenza virus remains the primary viral pathogen in the elderly, although the true impact of the other respiratory viruses remains to be defined as more sensitive diagnostic tools are developed. Unfortunately, the clinical syndromes associated with respiratory viruses frequently are indistinguishable from one another and bacterial pathogens. Because healthy elderly persons may visit exotic locations, which place them at risk for emerging pathogens, a travel history is important in the workup of pneumonia of older adults. Antiviral therapy is available for influenza A and B; thus, specific viral diagnosis may be useful for clinical management. Rapid antigen tests, although not as sensitive as viral culture or new molecular techniques, are widely available and offer quick turnaround times. RSV, PIV, hMPV, and coronaviruses in composite contribute to a substantial proportion of the community-acquired pneumonia cases in the elderly but at the present time treatment primarily is supportive.",
