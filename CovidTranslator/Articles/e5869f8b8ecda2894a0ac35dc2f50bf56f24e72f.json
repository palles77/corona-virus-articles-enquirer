            "text": "The mass media is a critical component of response to a worldwide influenza pandemic. This is because the mass media -print, television, radio and internet -is able to reach such a large and diversified audience, [1] [2] [3] and is crucial to getting public messages out in a crisis. 4 However, it also exerts a powerful influence on the way a pandemic is represented or 'framed'; for example, as crisis, or mere beat up; or as well or poorly managed. These frames influence people's reactions. 5 Health experts are not immune to such 'framing effects', and in previous respiratory illness crises, such as the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, were both reliant on and influenced by mass media reporting on events. 4, 6 Most commentators feel that it is therefore important that in addition to its commercial functions, the mass media does and should serve key civic functions. These include ensuring that citizens are sufficiently informed about significant issues as to be able to make appropriate decisions and to engage in forms of collective action against threats, such as infectious disease. Many studies of media ethics concentrate on identifying the ways in which coverage falls short of this ideal. The limitations of mass media reporting, mostly resulting from its commercial imperatives, have been repeatedly described since the 1960s. Among them are claims that the media is prone to sensationalism, sins of omission and sheer inaccuracy 7, 8 ; that in seeking to provide 'both sides of a story', it may perpetuate a problem or give unwarranted validity to wholly untenable views; that it leaves out complexity 8 and is the reverse of 'evidence based'. 9, 10 The perennial challenge for health policymakers, advocates, clinicians and researchers who respond to influenza and other infectious diseases is communicating extensively while avoiding these pitfalls. The unavoidable and critical effects of mass media coverage of epidemics and pandemics make it important that health experts who may play a role in responding to such events have a clear understanding of the factors that shape media reporting.",

This is the period in which risk issues can slip out of public sight, regardless of their long-term importance. 3 It occurred at a similar point in the cycle of public concern that we have recently experienced with regard to H1N1: a stage of post hoc questioning and judgement well known in the cycles of responses to crisis-like events. 1, 3, 18 It therefore sheds some light on the present post-pandemic stage.",

We have published a separate analysis, drawn from the data collected for this study, of media coverage of health issues in general, where we report the study methods in further detail. 19 We interviewed 16 journalists known to have reported significantly on pandemic influenza, drawn from a range of print, radio and television. We focused on journalists working in the traditional rather than online mass media, since the former still tends to be identified as setting the agenda for public discussion. The majority of the interviews were conducted via telephone, primarily by one researcher (JL). Our questions explored why avian influenza was covered or not covered and journalists' thoughts and reactions to the issue. All interviews were digitally recorded and transcribed. Coding in NVivo identified major themes. The coded text was reviewed by all researchers with the meanings and implications of the issues arising developed into higher order themes. Each theme was then reviewed by all authors to discuss general findings, exceptions and differences between participant groups.",

(One commented drily, 'The media is not the public relations wing of the health department.') However, we note that despite this stated commitment, in practice, in crisis situations journalists are often either too much taken up with the outlook of those whose views they report or too busy to take a critical stance. See for example a critique of the reporting of air quality issues in the lower Manhattan district after 9 \u2044 11. 22 In keeping with their strong commitment to their role as public informants, journalists were adamant that they would continue to work in a pandemic situation despite the dangers to themselves, although journalists with dependent family were more cautious.

Human-to-human transmission and clusters of deaths provoked an initial resurgence in media coverage, which was then driven by cultural and geographic proximity and swiftly thereafter by expert response, dominated by attention to technological and scientific solutions. Lack of novelty was the chief determinant of when the issue receded from mass media coverage. One of the chief findings from this study is reassuring: that in an actual crisis situation, local journalists at all levels of the production process expressed explicit commitment to the public good: communicating infection control messages, and being concerned about the potential to cause public over-reactions, being accurate, and being concerned about oversimplifying complex scientific issues. Specialist health reporters anticipated playing leading roles in a pandemic and in becoming rapidly educated about the relevant basic scientific information and technical issues. Evidence from previous outbreak events suggests that local media has handled these concerns well during crisis situations. 4, 25, 26 However, this situation is only sustainable so long as (i) the acute phase of the crisis persists, in which unified public action is perceived as integral to infection control, and (ii) journalists feel themselves to be getting full and frank information from government sources, sufficient to meet the requirements of media competition. Our study suggests that as time passes, journalists resume their role as critics of government and prioritise news values such a dissent and novelty above other public goods. 'Postmortem' reflections from government and community leaders on the handling of an outbreak have high news value and will be given considerable coverage, quite likely regardless of their intrinsic merits. Such reflections regarding H1N1 influenza, for example, have been evident since late 2009. 27, 28 Therefore we suggest media strategies in pandemic plans should anticipate this post-acute, 'reflective' phase.",

During the H1N1 threat, journalists sought to diversify their sources as part of providing new and interesting angles, but found that at exactly this time many of those best qualified to comment were tied up at the coalface and \u2044 or constrained in speaking to the media because of their government role. Being sensitive to media timetables and being available to check stories would have offered health officials more influence on the quality of coverage. 8 However, we note that uncertainties are not always clearly reported, or may tend to amplify perceptions of risk. Emphasising that there is a range of possibilities may help.",

One was constant deference to highly medicalised solutions, such as vaccine and antiviral medications or thermal scanners, rather than on community based infection control methods, such as handwashing, wearing masks, neighbourhood support and social distancing. As these sorts of responses are often among the most critical in early pandemic responses, their under-representation would certainly influence the way a pandemic and its solutions were framed and hence affect public and government responses. The H1N1 influenza 2009 pandemic has played out such dynamics. Early media reports focusing on upcoming biomedical solutions were met with assurances from many governments of an adequate and fasttracked supply of vaccine for the entire population. Now, in the face of a mild pandemic, there are post hoc criticisms about cost to the public purse, timing and delivery mechanisms. 27, 30 Limitations",
