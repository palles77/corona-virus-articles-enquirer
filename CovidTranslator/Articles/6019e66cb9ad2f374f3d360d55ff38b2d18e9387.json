The appearance of the characteristic whirlpool sign can facilitate the preoperative diagnosis of midgut volvulus and malrotation [4] . The disadvantage of ultrasonography is that it is operator-dependent. A detailed ultrasonographic survey of the abdomen, especially of the superior mesenteric vessel to their mesenteric artery, can increase diagnostic accuracy and give better evaluation of SMV and SMA relationship. However, this needs to be weighed against the impracticality of obtaining a detailed ultrasound examination under these circumstances. We demonstrated a patient with the initial presentation of abdominal pain with ileus pattern on initial plain radiogram. The whirlpool sign and the SMV using ultrasonography, was twisted around the SMA with 2708 of rotation and with the whirlpool sign being observed, and small bowel volvulus was diagnosed promptly and is valuable for the preoperative diagnosis of mesenteric vessel malrotation and midgut volvulus.",
