We sought to determine the diagnostic accuracy of lung ultrasound when compared to radiographically-confirmed clinical pediatric pneumonia. Methods: Between January 2012 and September 2013, we consecutively enrolled children aged 2e59 months with primary respiratory complaints at the outpatient clinics, emergency department, and inpatient wards of the Instituto Nacional de Salud del Ni\u00f1o in Lima, Peru. All participants underwent clinical evaluation by a pediatrician and lung ultrasonography by one of three general practitioners. We also consecutively enrolled children without respiratory symptoms. Children with respiratory symptoms had a chest radiograph. We obtained ancillary laboratory testing in a subset. Results: Final clinical diagnoses included 453 children with pneumonia, 133 with asthma, 103 with bronchiolitis, and 143 with upper respiratory infections. In total, CXR confirmed the diagnosis in 191 (42%) of 453 children with clinical pneumonia. A consolidation on lung ultrasound, which is our primary endpoint for pneumonia, had a sensitivity of 88.5%, specificity of 100%, and an area under-the-curve of 0.94 (95% CI 0.92e0.97) when compared to radiographically-confirmed clinical pneumonia. When any abnormality on lung ultrasound was compared to radiographically-confirmed clinical pneumonia the sensitivity increased to 92.2% and the specificity decreased to 95.2%, with an area under-the-curve of 0.94 (95% CI 0.91e0.96). Conclusions: Lung ultrasound had high diagnostic accuracy for the diagnosis of radiographicallyconfirmed pneumonia. Added benefits of lung ultrasound include rapid testing and high inter-rater agreement. Lung ultrasound may serve as an alternative tool for the diagnosis of pediatric pneumonia.",

Despite a decrease in child mortality in the past 20 years, the proportion of pneumonia deaths has remained constant at approximately 20% [3] . In low resource settings, where skilled providers are not widely available, the World Health Organization (WHO) developed a case management algorithm for the treatment of pneumonia. This involved training community health workers to identify respiratory signs and symptoms, centered on cough, difficulty breathing, respiratory rate and danger signs, for diagnosis, treatment, and referral [5] . While this algorithm achieved important mortality reductions after implementation [6] , multiple studies thereafter have shown that it lacks specificity [7e9]. A high false positive rate has resulted in overuse of antibiotics and improper therapy for children with acute bronchospasm that may instead require bronchodilators.",

Therefore, the diagnosis of pneumonia can be challenging and requires integration of a variety of diagnostic tools [9, 10] . In low resource settings, previous studies have tested additional, non-respiratory, diagnostic features, such as fever [10] and oxygen saturation [11, 12] . But when resources are available, imaging is an important adjunct [13] . In fact, the American Academy of Pediatrics endorsed chest X-ray (CXR) as the imaging modality of choice for complicated or ambiguous cases [10] . However, CXR has its own disadvantages including radiation exposure, high inter-observer variability [14] , and lack of impact on clinical outcome [15] .",

We focused on clinical pneumonia only because asthma, bronchiolitis and upper respiratory infection had low rates of consolidation on CXR. We defined positive sonographic findings as either finding a consolidation or any abnormality on LUS. Any abnormality on LUS was included to show that there was a difference in diagnostic accuracy between consolidation and any abnormality on LUS, when compared to radiographically-confirmed clinical pneumonia. Diagnostic accuracy was measured using positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), sensitivity, specificity and the C-statistic as a measure of area under the Receiving Operator Characteristic curve. We analyzed continuous variables as means using analysis of variance, and categorical variables as proportions using chi-square or Fisher exact tests, as appropriate. Inter-rater agreement among readers was determined using the kappa coefficient. We conducted statistical analyses in R (www.r-project.org) and STATA version 13 (StatCorp, College Station, Texas).",

            "text": "Children without respiratory symptoms (n \u00bc 230) five years and performed all testing in a busy tertiary care hospital in a resource-limited setting, suggesting that LUS can be realistically implemented in high-volume clinical settings without major disruptions to work flow. To our knowledge, this study is the first to examine reproducibility of LUS between multiple readers, using a standardized approach for the conduct of LUS. We provided specific details of sonographic findings, separating minimal pleural abnormalities and interstitial B-lines from large consolidations. Furthermore, we performed LUS evaluation on participants with a breadth of diverse respiratory pathologies including a group of children without respiratory symptoms. This differs from prior research that only focused on pneumonia without including healthy children or those with other respiratory disease processes, with the exception of Caiulo et al. who also studied bronchiolitis [33] . While not part of the reference standard for diagnosis, ancillary laboratory testing provided additional confidence to our diagnoses. Procalcitonin has previously been shown to be elevated in bacterial disease [34] and was highest in children with radiographically-confirmed pneumonia when compared to children who did not. The proportion of children with respiratory syncytial virus was greatest among children with bronchiolitis than among those with pneumonia, which is consistent with previous epidemiologic studies [24] . However, a limitation to the use of pharyngeal swabs is evident because there we did not find a no difference in the prevalence of S. pneumoniae between children with or without respiratory symptoms. Our study has some potential shortcomings. First, we did not have computerized tomography (CT) scan on all children with respiratory findings but standard of care would have not directed the use of CT scans to diagnose pneumonia in children. We used radiographically-confirmed clinical pneumonia as our gold standard, despite its limitations, which we believe is the safest alternative to the current gold-standard. As such, we were unable to arbitrate differences between LUS and CXR findings. LUS cannot detect consolidations that do not reach the pleura, whereas small consolidations (<1 intercostal space) observed on LUS cannot be visualized on CXR [27] . Nonetheless, the clinical relevance of small consolidations of LUS remains uncertain. Moreover, retrocardiac opacifications or consolidations may not be easily visualized on antero-posterior CXRs when compared to LUS. Second, we did not have information on the time course or severity of illness. Specifically, we did not follow the clinical course and had imaging only at the time of enrollment. Third, LUS may not be able to differentiate between small alveolar abnormalities and atelectasis. While Lichtenstein et al. described that, in adults, dynamic air bronchograms were more likely to occur in pneumonia whereas static air bronchograms were more likely to occur in atelectasis [35] , recognition of dynamic air bronchograms is difficult in children because of their body size. Fourth, overall sensitivity of LUS for the diagnosis of radiographically-confirmed pneumonia was lower than previously reported [15, 16] . However, this may be in part due to selection bias in previous studies where participants may have been more likely to have severe pneumonia. It might also be due to probe placement in our study: we did not consistently utilize transverse views, which may improve the diagnostic yield in children [17] . Fifth, the study physician conducting the ultrasound was not blinded to visible clinical symptoms, which may induce them to spend longer conducting LUS on children that appear more ill. Sixth, the kappa for agreement for CXR in our study was lower that what is previously found [36, 37] . This may be due lack of adherence to the WHO guidelines for reading CXRs, poor quality of the CXR and variability of respiratory illness in our study population. LUS is a promising tool that offers portability and diagnostic accuracy in resource-limited settings. It has the added benefits of rapid testing and appears to be easily taught. These results offer promise and may help improve the specificity of case management algorithms for the diagnosis of pediatric pneumonia. Future research should focus on prospective randomized trials using LUS as part of the case management algorithm for acute lower respiratory infections. Moreover, with prospective follow-up, we may better understand the evolution of LUS findings over time and determine whether early diagnosis using LUS may translate into clinically meaningful outcomes. Through increased development and production of high performance, portable devices, and standardized training modules, LUS could be a cost-effective solution to improve the diagnosis and management of pediatric pneumonia in appropriate settings worldwide.",
