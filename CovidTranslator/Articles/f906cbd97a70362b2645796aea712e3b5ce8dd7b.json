The ORNs are produced by proliferation of globose basal cells with newly generated neuronal cells migrating toward the surface of the olfactory neuroepithelium during maturation. The ORNs express specific molecular markers depending on their maturational status. Immature ORNs express growthassociated protein (GAP)-43 or neuron-specific \u03b2III tubulin (\u03b2IIIT) (Verhaagen et al. 1990 ; Lee and Pixley 1994; Roskams et al. 1998) , whereas mature ORNs express olfactory marker protein (OMP) (Monti Graziadei 1983; Kream and Margolis 1984) .",

Most of the studies regarding PVOD have focused on virus-induced apoptosis of the olfactory neuroepithelium or the olfactory bulb (Schwob et al. 2001; Welge-Lussen and Wolfensberger 2006) , while there have been few studies focusing on the damage caused by immune responses.",

Various viruses produce double-stranded (ds) RNAs during their replication cycle (Jacobs and Langland 1996) , which are recognized by TLR3. The stimulation of TLR3 causes the translocation of interferon regulatory factor-3 (IRF-3) and nuclear factor (NF)-\u03baB into the nucleus and the subsequent release of type I interferon and proinflammatory cytokines including TNF\u03b1, IL-6 and IL-8 (Alexopoulou et al. 2001; Matsukura et al. 2006 ). These cytokines induce migration and activation of inflammatory cells. In general, immune system processes work to protect the host against pathogens, but excessive immune response might itself cause tissue damage. Primed neutrophils release various inflammatory mediators, such as neutrophil elastase (NE) and cathepsin G, into extracellular spaces, and NE in particular is thought to be mainly involved in tissue damage (Janoff 1985; Inoue et al. 2006) .",

We selected the 9th posttreatment day because the number of mature olfactory receptor neurons was the lowest at this time point. This behavioral test relies on the mouse's natural tendency to investigate novel smells. Briefly, mice were acclimated to a clean plastic cage (46 cm\u00d723.5 cm\u00d720 cm) without wood chip bedding for 30 min, and then presented with a filter paper soaked in mineral oil placed in a 35 mm polystyrene dish for 3 min. This procedure was repeated three times at 1 min intervals. On the fourth trial, a filter paper soaked instead with propyl propionate was presented for 3 min. The mouse behavior was recorded with a digital video camera and each investigation time was measured. Investigation was defined as the mouse's nose being within 1 mm of the filter paper. The investigation time on the fourth trial was compared to that on the third trial. Mice with normal olfaction show significantly reduced sniff times when an odor is reintroduced for the second and third time (habituation), but they show a reinstatement of sniffing when a novel odor is presented. A lack of this reinstatement indicates the decrease or absence of olfactory sensitivity.",

First, we examined the morphological appearance of the olfactory mucosa in the mice treated with cycrophosphamide (CPA). Although CPA may be able to inhibit the proliferation of basal cells in the olfactory mucosa and cause morphological changes in the olfactory neuroepithelium, the dose used in this study did not cause any effects on either the olfactory mucosa or epithelium during the observation period (data not shown). We then tested whether the number of infiltrated neutrophils was reduced in neutropenic mice. In the Saline-Poly(I:C) group, a number of neutrophils were observed in the olfactory mucosa and the nasal cavity 3 days after intranasal administration of Poly(I:C) (Fig. 15a) . In contrast, in the CPA-Poly(I:C) group, neutrophils were rarely observed (Fig. 15b) , although the number of macrophages which had infiltrated the olfactory mucosa appeared to be similar to that in the Poly(I:C) group (data not shown).

We found that (1) a number of neutrophils infiltrated the olfactory mucosa in response to the intranasal administration of Poly(I:C), (2) intranasal administration of elastase severely damaged the olfactory neuroepithelium, (3) a neutrophil elastase inhibitor could suppress the olfactory neuroepithelial damage induced by Poly(I:C), and (4) the olfactory neuroepithelial damage induced by Poly(I:C) was suppressed in the neutropenic murine model. These results suggest that damage to the olfactory neuroepithelium by Poly(I:C) through TLR3 signaling is attributed mainly to the cytotoxic effect of elastase released by neutrophils that infiltrate the olfactory mucosa due to an innate immune reaction. Therefore, such a cellular mechanism is considered to be, at least partly, involved in the pathogenesis of human PVOD.",

To our knowledge, the present study is the first to demonstrate the expression of TLR3 in the olfactory mucosa. Immunohistochemistry with an anti-TLR3 antibody showed intense labeling in the apical part of supporting cells in the olfactory neuroepithelium. Supporting cells occupy a major part of the surface of the olfactory mucosa and are frequently exposed to foreign substances. Although the function of supporting cells in the olfactory neuroepithelium has not been fully elucidated, previous studies have proposed several possible roles, including mucus production or regulation, scavenging of local odorants, and phagocytosis of apoptotic ORNs (Suzuki et al. 1996; Makino et al. 2009 ). The results of the current study strongly suggest that the supporting cells also serve as a first line of defense for the immune system by taking foreign materials into the cytoplasm and inducing an immune response.",

We observed Fig. 9 Olfactory habituation/dishabituation test. Mice were presented with a filter paper soaked in mineral oil placed in a polystyrene dish three times at 1 min intervals. In the fourth trial, a filter paper soaked instead with propyl propionate was presented for 3 min.The mouse behavior was recorded with a digital video camera and each investigation time was measured. Before the administration of Poly(I:C), the investigation time on the fourth trial was significantly longer than that on the third trial (n=5, p<0.01). At 9 days after the first administration of Poly(I:C), there was no significant difference between them, suggesting a decrease of olfactory sensitivity (p=0.438) that TLR3 was also expressed in Bowman's glands. This finding suggests that Bowman's glands may recognize viruses via TLR3 and act as part of the immune system similar to the supporting cells. This homology between supporting cells and Bowman's glands appears to fit with their same lineage and similar immunohistochemical profiles (Huard et al. 1998 ).",

The most likely explanation for this finding would be that intranasal administration of Poly(I:C) induced rapid mucus secretion from Bowman's glands into the nasal cavity and a decrease in the total amount of mucus in Bowman's glands. Another possibility, not mutually exclusive with the first possibility, is that the toxic effect of Poly(I:C) reduced the production of the mucus in the acinar cells of the glands, and/or the mucus composition in the glands was altered and the Alcian bluepositivity became reduced. Whatever the cellular mechanisms, this histochemical change in Bowman's glands suggests that they are affected by Poly(I:C) stimulation and possibly contribute to the elimination of pathogens by secreting mucus.

Sections of the mucosae harvested at 8 h, 3, 9, and 24 days after the first administration of Poly(I:C) (b, d, f) or saline (a, c, e) were immunostained for neutrophils (a, b), F4/80 (Macrophage; c, d) and CD3 (T lymphocyte; e, f). In the control group, neutrophils were not observed across any of the time points (a-a\u2033\u2032).

At 3 days, the number of OMP-positive ORNs in the neuroepithelium had decreased in almost the whole lining of the olfactory mucosa (a). In a high magnification view, the number of OMP-positive ORNs was very low at 3 days after the administration of elastase (b). At 9 days, their number still remained reduced, but the neuroepithelial thickness had increased (b\u2032). After the administration of saline, there was no change in the olfactory neuroepithelium (c, c\u2032). Sections of the olfactory mucosa harvested at 8 h after the administration of elastase were immunostained with anti-phospho-NF-\u03baBp65 antibody (d). Intense immunoreactivity was detected in the nuclei of exfoliated neuroepithelial cells and weak immunoreactivity was also observed in the nuclei of remaining neuroepithelial cells. Bars (a) 0.5 mm, (b, c) 50 \u03bcm, (d) 100 \u03bcm Poly(I:C)-induced immunological reaction and olfactory neuroepithelial damage After the administration of Poly(I:C), we observed an increase in the expression of phospho-IRF-3 and phospho-NF-\u03baB p65, downstream signaling molecules of TLR3, and upregulated expression of MIP-2 (mouse homolog of IL-8), a neutrophil chemoattractant, in the olfactory mucosa. Several types of inflammatory cells including neutrophils, macrophages, and T lymphocytes then infiltrated the olfactory mucosa in a timedependent manner. Neutrophils were the dominant cell type in the early phase of the response. Macrophages and T lymphocytes infiltrated to a lesser extent and remained in the olfactory mucosa relatively longer than neutrophils. It has been reported that, when airway epithelial cells are stimulated by Poly(I:C), they produce leukocyte chemoattractants such as IL-8 and MIP-1\u03b1 (Matsukura et al. 2006; Berube et al. 2009; Ohkuni et al. 2011) , leading to the infiltration of inflammatory cells. IL-8 upregulation following the activation of TLR3 in airway epithelial cells is mediated by the NF-\u03baB and MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) pathways (Berube et al. 2009 ). In the current study, we observed similar upregulation of TLR3-mediated signaling molecules and MIP-2 in the olfactory mucosa. Therefore, we speculate that the neutrophil influx into the olfactory mucosa was caused by the upregulation of MIP-2 expression, which was induced via the TLR3 signaling pathway activated by Poly(I:C).",

Neutrophil elastase also induces the production of cytokines, such as IL-6, IL-8, macrophage inflammatory protein-1(MIP-1), and mucin, from epithelial cells (Sommerhoff et al. 1990; Nakamura et al. 1992; Bedard et al. 1993) , resulting in the exacerbation of inflammation. In the present study, the tissue damage was most severe in the lateral area of the olfactory region, where neutrophilic infiltration was marked, suggesting that neutrophils might be involved in the pathogenesis of tissue damage. We also demonstrated that Poly(I:C)-induced olfactory neuroepithelial damage was inhibited by prior administration of the neutrophil elastase inhibitor, Sivelestat. In addition, we demonstrated that the intranasal administration of elastase induced neuroepithelial damage, and that Poly(I:C)-induced neuroepithelial damage was suppressed in the neutropenic murine model. These findings strongly suggest that neutrophil elastase plays an important role in the Poly(I:C)-induced damage of the olfactory neuroepithelium. It has previously been reported that a neutrophil elastase inhibitor reduced the number of neutrophils in a murine model of pneumococcal pneumonia (Yanagihara et al. 2007 ). In the current study, there was no significant difference in the number of infiltrating neutrophils between the Sivelestat-Poly(I:C) group and Saline-Poly(I:C) group. This result suggests that, although neutrophil elastase is involved in the pathogenesis of the Poly(I:C)-induced neuroepithelial damage, other inflammatory mediators provoke the recruitment of neutrophils in the olfactory mucosa.",

Although we focused on TLR3-mediated cellular and molecular events in the olfactory mucosa, real viral infections can induce other innate immune responses and adaptive immune responses which could also contribute to tissue damage. For example, it has been shown that viral infections can activate a broader set of intracellular innate immune receptors, such as TLR7 or TLR9. By using an experimental model in which a specific molecular pathway is activated, we would be able to demonstrate that TLR3 signaling is one of the components of an immunological reaction during viral infections in the olfactory mucosa. Other signaling pathways could be evaluated using the same methodology.",

These findings suggest that the cell death of ORNs induced by intranasal administration of Poly(I:C) occurred partly due to a caspase-3 mediated apoptotic process, but mostly due to other mechanisms such as necrosis. They also suggest that other cell types in the neuroepithelium, such as supporting cells and basal cells also underwent cell death through apoptotic processes. The pathophysiology of cell death in the olfactory mucosa has been investigated in a number of experimental studies, which have suggested that the mode of cell death varies depending on the etiology. For example, a study using transgenic mice which express TNF-\u03b1 in supporting cells under the control of doxycycline demonstrated that TNF-\u03b1 can cause the loss of mature ORNs and infiltration of inflammatory cells into the olfactory mucosa (Lane et al. 2010 ). In this model, supporting cells were retained despite extensive loss of mature ORNs, suggesting that apoptosis is the primary mode of ORN cell death. In another model, when mice were sensitized to intranasal Aspergillus fumigatus extract and subsequently challenged acutely or chronically with the allergen, the mice demonstrated elevated eosinophil infiltration and olfactory sensory neuron apoptosis. However, massive neuronal apoptosis without eosinophil infiltration also occurred in nonsensitized mice after a single dose of the extract (Epstein et al. 2008) . This suggests that the fungal allergens could induce ORN apoptosis in both an eosinophilic inflammation-dependent way, and also in a direct toxicity way mediated through TLR2 or 4, the latter of which may be similar to what we observed in our Poly(I:C) models. In a nasosinusitis model infected with Staphylococcus, single-strand DNA-, Bcl-2-, or Bax-positive apoptotic cells were detected in olfactory neuroepithelium, and, interestingly, the apoptosis of ORNs in the non-infected (i.e., contralateral) side was also upregulated (Ge et al. 2002) . The distribution of apoptotic cells was different between infected side and non-infected side, suggesting that the mechanism underlying ORN apoptosis is different. These findings altogether strongly suggest that there are multiple pathways to induce cell death of ORNs.",

The reason for this is not clear, but there seem to be several underlying factors: the number of ORNs, regenerative capacity of basal cells, strength of host immune responses, and types of viruses. We would expect considerable variability in the number of ORNs among individuals due to extrinsic and intrinsic factors (Kondo et al. 2009; Holbrook et al. 2011) . Elderly people may be more vulnerable to PVOD, due to a subclinical decrease in the number of ORNs and their low regenerative capacity after injury.",
