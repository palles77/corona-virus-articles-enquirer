Purpose: To explore whether enhanced cooperation with local government and community institutions can effectively supplement traditional state-centric public health epidemic responses. Methods: Drawing on Taiwan as a case study, we assess the role of the whole-of-society approach to epidemic response as arises from the collaborative governance literature. The approach calls for enhanced cooperation, trust building, resource sharing and consensus-oriented decision making among multiple levels of government, business, non-profits, and the public in general. Results: The Taiwan case illustrates the benefits of the whole-of-society approach. Enhanced cooperation between state, local government and non-state institutions, particularly neighborhood committees, has resulted in a strengthened, holistic epidemic preparedness and response infrastructure. Conclusion: The Taiwan case provides evidence that by implementing the whole-of-society approach to pandemic preparedness and response governments can enhance their ability to manage future outbreaks. We recommend that governments beyond Taiwan's borders seriously consider adopting this approach.",

At the point the outbreak becomes a domestic affair, the burden of control falls to the pandemic preparedness and response infrastructure and institutions established by the country. As has been repeatedly observed across the globe, no country facing an outbreak has proven itself to possess a fully effective response system.",

These and other examples of potential pandemic disasters are made more potent by the easy and rapid international movement of goods, services, people, and vectors (e.g., mosquitoes) characterized by globalization. In short, the threat of a disaster arising from a pandemic outbreak is increasing, and effective responses are very much needed.",

Success cannot rely solely on high-technology medical tools, physician care, and vaccination/immunization, but must incorporate widespread implementation of sometimes straightforward yet unpopular (and potentially disruptive) protocols such as social distancing, constraints on population movements, mask distribution, and hand washing. Constructing and implementing an effective domestic pandemic response system thus requires far more than simply investing heavily in traditional public health approaches. As is often noted, even where technically sound solutions exist, they are not always used because of political constraints. 7, 8 Indeed, the political nature of pandemic response requires that government officials responsible for pandemic response develop a model that incorporates both advanced public health tools, and local government officials and nonstate actors.",

And yet, the World Health Organization (WHO) and other organizations are increasingly calling for such collaboration. 9, 10 In what is described as a whole-of-society pandemic readiness approach, the WHO argues that states should draw on nonstate actors to play a variety of roles, including distributing resources such as bed nets, condoms, and sanitary toilets; obtaining and disseminating information to educate and mobilize the public to achieve healthcare priorities; representing community interests while promoting equitable access; and providing some financing and monitoring of care. As the WHO argues, \"there is great potential for improving public health through systematic collaboration between governments and civil society..\" 11, 12 The Collaborative Governance literature speaks directly to the \"whole-of-society\" approach. According to Ansell and Gash, 13 collaborative governance describes an arrangement between one or more public agencies that collaborate with nonstate actors in a collective decision-making process aimed at implementing public policy or managing public programs or assets. Actors engage in consensus-oriented decision making, fostering mutual trust, resource sharing, and responsibility. Collaboration may be formal or informal, and may include multiple levels of government, businesses, nonprofit and philanthropic organizations, communities, and the public as a whole.",

Second, Taiwan has a public health system that provides high quality care to all its citizens. As a result, traditional public health initiatives can be relatively easily implemented. Third, Taiwan is a medium-sized, contained, wealthy island democracy with an advanced economy. This ensures that Taiwan possesses the resources necessary for pandemic response while also being attentive to and constrained by public interests and concerns.

In its Influenza Pandemic Preparedness Plan in Taiwan 2005e2010, the Taiwan CDC predicts the possibility of more than 3 million people (in a population of 23 million) requiring some level of medical assistance and a large number of deaths should an outbreak of avian influenza occur. 20 The Taiwan government has responded to the potential threat by investing in building a comprehensive state-driven epidemic preparedness and response network intended to quickly identify an outbreak and mobilize resources. The essentials appear in the 2009, amended Communicable Disease Control Act. 21 As the Central Competent Authority, the Ministry of Health and Welfare (MoH) is responsible for formulating policy responses to outbreaks while also acting on national level challenges (such as port quarantines, epidemiological surveillance) (Art. 1, subsection 1). Municipal and county authorities have similar responsibilities at the local level, and may turn to the Center for assistance as needed (Art. 1, subsection 2). Should an outbreak occur, the central government may mobilize the Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC) in order to centralize epidemic response efforts and facilitate cooperation. Under the leadership of the MoH, participating government units may include environment, agriculture, education, interior, police, transportation, and foreign affairs. The CECC holds regular meetings to cooperate on developing implementation plans and to coordinate control of the outbreak. Command centers similar to the CECC may also be established by local governments, which have their own disease prevention resources.",

According to the TCDC 2015 Annual Report, TCDC responsibilities include formulating policy recommendations on addressing epidemic outbreaks, collaborating with international actors, controlling international ports of entry, and providing guidance to local authorities on epidemic control. 23 The TCDC maintains a surveillance network that relies on regular reports from schools; populous institutions such as elder care facilities, prisons, and international entry points. During WHO-declared pandemic phase 4 (increased evidence of human-to-human transmission), physicians in Taiwan have 24 hours to update the TCDC via the Internet regarding any notifiable diseases they encounter among patients.

And although this is encouraging, even with H1N1 there were many shortcomings. In one particularly troubling example, having provided 10 million doses of an indigenously developed vaccine, the public reacted negatively when the media, despite a lack of evidence, tied the death of the son of a physician to the vaccine. The government was unable to overcome this story and as a result, trust in the government, its statements, and recommendations declined, and in many cases individuals refused vaccination. 27 Furthermore, while following SARS the central government increased the CDC's budget and human resources significantly, but in later years the budget steadily declined, with investment in epidemic control particularly undermined. 28 Further undermining pandemic preparedness and response, the government restricted global budget growth for the national health system, even as demand for health services steadily increased. Hospitals have responded by seeking savings, including cutting in areas they perceive to be relatively noncritical including emerging disease control and surge capacity. 29 As becomes clear from Taiwan's H1N1 experience, even after adjusting government policies, guidelines, and protocols in the wake of SARS, funding for state institutional response remained inadequate, undermining effective response while at the same time the public was swayed by rumors to distrust government actions. The result was an insufficient response. Inadequate resources and declining public trust are both recognized in the collaborative governance and whole-of-society literatures as challenges to effective pandemic response. Faced with a vulnerable public that distrusts, yet expects insufficiently resourced state institutions to protect them, responsible state actors must develop alternatives to the traditional, state-led approaches.",

The TCDC, in collaboration with the Taipei CDC, therefore developed, tested, and piloted a response model based on Incident Management Systems and Six Sigma. Incident Management Systems describes a chain of command and control with four components that enhance response coordination across institutional spheres. These components include planning, financing, logistical support, and action. Six Sigma is a process management tool that simplifies complex processes by breaking them down into smaller, more manageable steps. Both tools influenced Traffic Control Bundling (TCB)da model developed to arrest nosocomial infection of healthcare workers and patients in hospitals. TCB involves triaging and dispatching patients prior to hospitalization (often outside the hospital itself); maintaining zones of contamination where confirmed cases are housed; distinguishing zones of contamination from clean zones; disinfection stations established between zones with all zones clearly delineated. Studies of hospital infection rates during SARS found that, when implemented, TCB proved highly effective. As a result, TCB has been expanded across Taiwan's hospital system and has been deployed in outbreaks that have occurred since then. 30 In addition to the microapplication of TCB to hospitals, TCB has also been applied nationally, drawing on the six regional communicable disease control centers. The network facilitates communication and integrates response efforts (including sharing training and surge capacity) among the national and local level governments while also incorporating input from hospitals, infection control units and local health departments.",

Hotel personnel are expected to report fever, flulike illness, diarrhea, rash, and other symptoms among hotel guests to the public health authorities. In addition, hotel administrators are required to distribute notices to guests explaining epidemic risks and the various measures to be taken to avoid infection. 30 This same approach has been adopted in other cities across Taiwan.

To limit outbreak spread, interzonal traffic is restricted by checkpoints that are established between subdistricts, and public transportation is blocked among the subdistricts.

By the end of the year, Tainan had identified 22,752 cases, more than half of the 43,280 diagnosed cases across Taiwan. The 2015 dengue outbreak was the worst in Taiwan's history, coming on the heels of a record outbreak the previous year. Major contributors to the record setting outbreak included rising temperatures caused by El Ni\u00f1o and global warming in general, as well as increased imported cases. Tainan's mayor identified city-specific contributors as well, including locally heavy rains and the public's response to a past drought by storing water near or in their homes. Because dengue is a mosquito-borne disease and standing water provides ideal breeding conditions, the mosquito population exploded. 34, 35 In the previous year, 2014, Kaohsiung city also suffered a record-setting dengue outbreak, diagnosing more than 15,000 casesd96% of those reported in Taiwan. As in Tainan, Kaohsiung's outbreak was attributed to unusually warm weather coupled with heavy rain and widespread, standing water. 36 Having learned from the Kaohsiung experience, the Taiwan MoH responded to the Tainan outbreak by collaborating with the city government, designating four dengue isolation hospitals with wards allocated to managing any surge in dengue-infected patients. As there is no dengue vaccine currently available, TCDC focused primarily on eliminating vectors. The strategy can be summarized as educating local government officials and the general public about dengue fever sources and engaging in community training and mobilization to identify and eliminate mosquito breeding grounds. This was supplemented with improved surveillance and reporting systems to facilitate information sharing and updates by both public health officials and the public in general. 37 Such policies rely heavily on public participation. In anticipation of dengue's return in 2016, the TCDC director initiated a further experiment in collaborative pandemic preparedness and response. First, the TCDC identified the 309 Li from among the 1670 Li in Tainan and Kaohsiung that had suffered 90% of all confirmed 2015 dengue cases in those two cities. The TCDC then focused on providing those 309 wardens with training and additional resources to enhance their capacity to work with health officials to educate and mobilize residents and to track and eliminate dengue vectors. Since wardens cannot be required to participate in this initiative, the TCDC encourages participation by offering rewards to those wardens whose Li's enjoy the greatest improvement in dengue infection rates compared to the previous year. As the TCDC director argues, working through wardens may be the most effective way to engage the public at the ground level in awareness building and dengue prevention and control.",

Lacking adequate capacity to do so effectively, the state may draw a public reaction characterized by increasing distrust and disappointment. As occurred in Taiwan during the SARS outbreak, these attitudes may catalyze a cycle in which the public questions and challenges government initiatives, sometimes refusing to cooperate or even actively concealing information from the state. As was recently illustrated by events during the 2014 Ebola outbreak in western Africa, this phenomenon is not limited to Taiwan.",

The CECC draws together ministries and departments from across the national-level bureaucracy to cooperate on pandemic response. The central government also collaborates with lower levels of government such as is the case with Taipei, Tainan, and Kaohsiung, and with state hospitals. Collaboration with city hotels exemplifies local government collaboration with private sector actors. Finally, the ongoing and expanding cooperation of central and local state actors with neighborhood wardens exemplifies outreach and collaboration that engages community actors.",
