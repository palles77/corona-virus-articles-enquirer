            "text": "a b s t r a c t A reverse vaccinology system, Vaxign, was used to identify and select a subset of five African Swine Fever (ASF) antigens that were successfully purified from human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK) cells and produced in Modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) viral vectors. Three HEK-purified antigens [B646L (p72), E183L (p54), and O61R (p12)], and three MVA-vectored antigens [B646L, EP153R, and EP402R (CD2v)] were evaluated using a prime-boost immunization regimen swine safety and immunogenicity study. Antibody responses were detected in pigs following prime-boost immunization four weeks apart with the HEK-293-purified p72, p54, and p12 antigens. Notably, sera from the vaccinees were positive by immunofluorescence on ASFV (Georgia 2007/1)-infected primary macrophages. Although MVA-vectored p72, CD2v, and EP153R failed to induce antibody responses, interferon-gamma (IFN-\u2425 + ) spot forming cell responses against all three antigens were detected one week post-boost. The highest IFN-\u2425 + spot forming cell responses were detected against p72 in pigs primed with MVA-p72 and boosted with the recombinant p72. p72, CD2v, and EP153R) T-cell proliferative responses were also detected post-boost. Collectively, these results are the first demonstration that ASFV subunit antigens purified from mammalian cells or expressed in MVA vectors are safe and can induce ASFV-specific antibody and T-cell responses following a prime-boost immunization regimen in swine.",

            "text": "African swine fever (ASF) is one of the most important disease of domestic pigs (S\u00e1nchez-Vizca\u00edno et al., 2015) . The etiology agent, ASF virus (ASFV), is a large, complex DNA arbovirus and only member of the Asfarviridae family (Tulman et al., 2009) . ASFV shares some features with poxviruses, including cytoplasmic genome organization and gene expression (Tulman et al., 2009) . Although ASFV infection is generally asymptomatic in African wild suids, ASFV infection of domestic pigs usually results in a highly contagious hemorrhagic disease (Costard et al., 2013) . Pigs that survive and recover initial infection may become persistently infected and serve as virus reservoirs in areas where the disease is endemic (Oie, 2012) . Outside the African continent, the disease is endemic to Madagascar and Sardinia, and intensive eradication programs following ASFV outbreaks in Portugal, Spain, South America, and the Caribbean were successful. Since its introduction into Georgia in 2007, ASFV has spread rapidly into vast areas of Western and Southern Russia, Ukraine, and the Republic of Belarus (Costard et al., 2009) . There is no effective treatment or vaccine against ASF, thus current control measures rely mainly on detection and elimination of infected animals (S\u00e1nchez-Vizca\u00edno et al., 2013) . Studies in domestic pigs using conventional vaccine approaches such as inactivated, avirulent or live attenuated ASF viruses (tissue culture adapted, rational gene deleted) have reported varying levels of homologous protection, however, some surviving animals have been shown to develop subclinical disease, thus raising the possibility of vaccinated animals becoming carriers (Sanchez-Vizcaino et al., 2009) . Although protective immune mechanisms are poorly understood, cellular immune responses (particularly CD8+ T-cells) (Oura et al., 2005; Takamatsu et al., 2013) , and humoral responses Onisk et al., 1994; Wardley et al., 1985) are thought to have important roles in host protection. Early vaccination studies that tested several, B-cell immunodominant ASFV subunit, recombinant proteins (i.e., p30, p54 and p72) produced using either baculovirus or DNA-based vaccines yielded variable success (Argilaguet et al., 2012 (Argilaguet et al., , 2011 Barderas et al., 2001; G\u00f3mez-Puertas et al., 1998) . Interestingly, immune responses elicited by DNA vaccines were variable and dependent on the fusion tag (i.e., soluble HA or ubiquitin) selected for ASFV recombinant antigen expression (Argilaguet et al., 2012) . A recent study using an ASFV E75 expression library containing approximately 4000 individual plasmid clones (excluding p30, p54, and CD2v) demonstrated a correlation between protection and CD8+ T-cell response (Lacasta et al., 2014) . Results from this study showed that the ASFV genome (\u223c170-190 kb) contains additional antigens with protective potential, and implied that identification of such determinants would enable advances in the development of protective subunit vaccine candidates. To this end, we applied an in silico bioinformatic tool to identify and rank ASFV open reading frames (ORFs) that possess attributes desirable in selecting vaccine targets. Vaxign is the first web-based vaccine design program that predicts vaccine targets based on genomic sequences utilizing the reverse vaccinology (RV) strategy (He et al., 2010b) . Using the entire annotated protein sequences from genome(s), Vaxign identifies open reading frames that possess a high probability of being good vaccine candidates based on (i) protein subcellular location, (ii) transmembrane helices, (iii) adhesin probability, (iv) sequence ortholog analysis among pathogenic strains, (v) sequence exclusion from genome(s) of nonpathogenic strain(s), and (vi) epitope binding to MHC (major histocompatibility complex) class I and class II. Vaxign has been used for rational design of experimental vaccines against several intracellular pathogens including Brucella and Rickettsia prowazekii (Caro- Gomez et al., 2014; Gomez et al., 2013) , and has been successfully used for prediction of potential vaccine targets in uropathogenic Escherichia coli (He et al., 2010b) , Streptococcus agalactiae (Pereira et al., 2013) , and human herpes simplex viruses (Xiang and He, 2013) .",

Pigs were monitored at least twice daily for any clinical signs and to document any localized and or systemic adverse effects throughout the post-immunization phase. Animal care to alleviate any animal suffering was provided by the attending veterinarian. The pigs were fed an antibiotic-free commercial pig ration twice daily and water ad libitum. At the end of the study, the pigs were euthanatized with an intravenous overdose of a commercial euthanasia solution (Beuthanasia-D Special, sodium pentobarbital 390 mg/ml and sodium phenytoin 50 mg/ml, Intervet/Merck Animal Health, Madison, NJ) and osculated with a stethoscope to confirm lack of heartbeat.",

Five genomes were downloaded from the National Center for Biotechnology Information RefSeq database: BA71 V (Accession #: NC 001659.1), Benin 97/1 (AM712239.1), E75 (FN557520.1), Georgia 2007/1 (FR682468.1), and OURT 88/3 (avirulent field isolate) (AM712240.1). Seven genome sequences were kindly provided by Dr. John Neilan: Kenya 1950 (AY261360.1), Malawi Lil-20/1(1983) (AY261361.1), Mkuzi 1979 (AY261362.1), Pretorisuskop/96/4 (AY261363.1), Tengani 62 (AY261364.1), Warmbaths (AY261365.1), and Warthog (AY261366.1). Since annotations of individual genes from these seven genomes were unavailable at the time of the study, the gene coding sequences of these genomes were determined by using Glimmer software (Delcher et al., 2007) . Annotated protein sequences were used as input for the Vaxign pipeline analysis using the Georgia 2007/1 strain genome (Chapman et al., 2011) as the seed genome. For each protein sequence of the Georgia 2007/1 genome, Vaxign calculated and predicted the following five features: i) transmembrane domains, ii) adhesin probability, iii) sequence conservation among other ASFV strains, and epitopes binding to iv) MHC class I and v) MHC class II molecules (He et al., 2010b; Xiang and He, 2013) . These five features were selected for analysis based on the following rationale: 1) the presence of transmembrane domain(s) suggested a possible virion surface location; 2) adhesin proteins suggested to be critical for virus attachment and entry; 3) expansive protection against diverse strains requires the use of conserved genes among different pathogenic ASFV strains as vaccine candidates; and 4) MHC class I/II epitope predictions for immunity determinants.",

Since limited swine leukocyte antigens (SLA) specific epitopes were available for training of the epitope prediction function of Vaxitope, the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) epitope prediction method in Vaxitope was used to predict ASFV epitopes for binding to swine MHC. For the epitope screening for HLA alleles, we used six \"Supertype\" HLA Class I alleles and eight \"supertype\" HLA Class II alleles as reported previously (De Groot et al., 2009 ). This approach was rationalized based on reports that swine and human share many similarities in terms of genetics and physiology (Meurens et al., 2012; Suenderhauf and Parrott, 2012) and human MHC and swine SLA complexes share multiple paralogous regions (Chardon et al., 2000) . The key feature of the MHC gene clusters is the encoding of class I and class II membrane-anchored glycoproteins that differ in structure, cellular and tissue expression specificity, origin of the peptides presented to T-cells, and T-cell subset activation (Chardon et al., 2000) . The SLA class I antigens are constitutively expressed on the surface of nucleated cells and present peptides derived from nuclear and cytosolic proteins to CD8+ cytotoxic T-cells. They also interact with natural killer cells to prevent NK-mediated cytotoxicity (Lunney et al., 2009) . The SLA class II antigens are expressed primarily on the surface of antigen presenting cells such as macrophages, B-cells, T-cells, and dendritic cells and present peptides derived from exogenous proteins to CD4+ helper T-cells (Lunney et al., 2009) .",

The highest weight of 40% was assigned to MHC class epitopes I and II epitope prediction scores since MHC class I epitopes may stimulate cytotoxic CD8+ T-lymphocyte activity while MHC class II epitopes may stimulate CD4+ helper T\u2212cell and antibody activity. Adhesion probability and transmembrane prediction scores assigned weights were based on their potential contribution to protein topography and virulence.

Vaccine development progress has been hindered by the gap in knowledge of antigens that can be effectively used for protective prophylactic vaccination. ASFV has a relatively large genome and encodes for some proteins that play a role in host immune response evasion (Dixon et al., 2004) . To date, inactivated ASFV preparations, live, attenuated ASFV viruses, bacteria expressed recombinant subunit antigens, and DNA vaccine approaches have all been met with limited success in providing consistently high efficacy against homologous or heterologous challenge with virulent ASFV Barderas et al., 2001; Jenson et al., 2000; Ruiz-Gonzalvo et al., 1996) .

Vaxign predicts relevant features by utilizing publicly available and in house/internally developed bioinformatics tools. For example, Vaxign utilizes HMMTOP for transmembrane helix topology analysis (Kall et al., 2007) , SPAAN for adhesion probability prediction (Sachdeva et al., 2005) , and OrthoMCL (Li et al., 2003a) for sequence conservation analysis. For MHC class I and class II binding epitope prediction, an internally developed bioinformatics tool, Vaxitope, was used (He et al., 2010b; Xiang and He, 2013) . The Vaxitope program is based on the position specific scoring matrice (PSSM) (Stormo et al., 1982) and refinements to the cutoff scoring. Instead of a percentage or top number, Vaxitope utilizes the statistical P value of 0.05 to determine the cutoff value that provides high sensitivity and specificity (He et al., 2010b; Xiang and He, 2013) .",

            "text": "The Vaxign ranking is this study was based on a method of assigning different weights for each analysis feature. The weighting was based on parameters related to potential immunogenicity (e.g., 40% weight to MHC class epitopes, 35% weight to adhesion probability, 15% to transmembrane domain presence, and 10% to sequence conservation). A 35% weight was assigned to adhesion probability since adhesion proteins may be surface attachment and cell fusion proteins that are important for cell invasion and virulence (Sachdeva et al., 2005) . For example, SPAAN (used in Vaxign) identified many spike glycoproteins from Human coronavirus as adhesins (Sachdeva et al., 2005) and the spike protein (S), a membrane component of Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), was identified to be critical for viral pathogenesis (Li et al., 2003b) and experimentally proven to be effective as a vaccine candidate (Bisht et al., 2004) . The identified adhesion probability scores for EP402R (CD2v) (score 0.457) and EP153R (score 0.372) correlate with previous reports that have shown that these proteins are involved in ASFV hemadsorption (HA) in vitro (Borca et al., 1998 (Borca et al., , 1994b Galindo et al., 2000; Neilan et al., 1999; Rodr\u00edguez et al., 1993; Ruiz-Gonzalvo et al., 1996) . Adhesion probability scores were identified for B646L/p72 (score 0.25), CP204L/p30 (score 0.363), and E183L/p54 (score 0.566), all previously reported to be potential protective antigens (Argilaguet et al., 2012; G\u00f3mez-Puertas et al., 1998; Lokhandwala et al., 2016; Neilan et al., 2004) . A 20% weight for each MHC class epitopes was chosen to select both classes of epitopes equally to maximize immunogenicity potential. A recent report correlated two SLA I-restricted 9-mer peptides within CD2v capable of in vitro stimulating the specific secretion of IFN-\u2425 from PBMCs from challenged survivor pigs (Argilaguet et al., 2012) . MHC class I and II scores that range from 0.60-0.78 were identified for previously reported potential protective antigens B646L, CP204L, E183L, EP153R, and EP402R. A 15% weight was assigned to transmembrane domain presence based on the assumption that transmembrane proteins would be on the surface of the virion when ASFV has the capsid outer layer embedded onto inner membrane. Overall, the Vaxign ranking for previously reported potential protective antigens are as follows: B646L (rank 107), CP204L/p30 (rank 79), E183L (rank 4), EP153R (rank 17), and EP402R (rank 15). Three of the previously reported potential protective antigens are ranked within the top 20. The lower ranking for B646L and CP204L is likely due to the lack of predicted transmembrane domain, which was assigned 15% weight to the overall ranking. Many of the top 30 Vaxign ranked antigens, including the rank 1 antigen, E146L, have not previously been evaluated in immunogenicity studies. To our knowledge, this study represents the first report on a strategy for weighting analysis features for antigen ranking by Vaxign. The swine immunogenicity results obtained in the present study support that a ranking approach can be subsequently used to down select ASFV recombinant antigens that induce a detectable immune response.",

The mammalian HEK 293 expression system was selected based on the hypothesis that authentic soluble post-translationally modified, recombinant ASFV proteins would induce both humoral and cellular immune responses. The poxvirus MVA vector system was selected based on its demonstrated safety in swine and its ability to induce in vivo expression of one or more specific antigens in the administered host (Moss, 1993) . Following in vivo administration, MVA infected cells will express the recombinant antigen(s) de novo for subsequent processing by the proteasome to generate peptides that are presented on the cell surface by MHC-I molecules for T-cell recognition (Brewoo et al., 2010) . The presentation of antigenic peptides by professional antigen presenting cells via this MHC class I pathway induces the activation of CD8+ T-cells, a feature postulated to be desirable for ASFV protection. In addition, the MVA vector system also enables the synthesis of long-lived antigens (stable proteins) which is advantageous since these proteins, as immunogens, are superior for efficient activation of immune responses in vivo. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that T-cell responses are more efficiently activated when dendritic cells cross-present stable MVA-produced antigens (Gasteiger et al., 2007) . For these reasons, the MVA system was Fig. 4 . ASFV antigen-specific PBMC proliferation following homologous HEK-ASFV antigen post-boost.

Although troubleshooting was performed, the factors contributing to lack of protein expression in the HEK system are unknown. The various physicochemical and structure features of and post-translational modifications associated with each target protein as well as transcript stability and proteolysis may have contributed to the unsuccessful protein expression. Three proteins, E146L, E199L, and E248R, that were expressed contain putative transmembrane domains and were insoluble in Triton X-114. The technical challenges initially observed with the MVA systemgenetic instability and lack of cell growth for the recombinants -was resolved through the addition of the secretory signal tPA (human tissue plasminogen activator) which enabled successful generation of these recombinant MVA-ASV viruses. The inclusion of the secretory tPA signal likely reduced the toxicity of the gene products, allowing for stable recombinants expressing E146L (Vaxign rank 1), I10L (rank 3), E183L (rank 4), E199L (rank 6), E248R (rank 9), O61R (rank 20), and CP204L (rank 79).

E183L, EP402R, EP153R, and O61R exhibited optimal Vaxign ranking in the range of 4-20 and B646L exhibited a low ranking of 107.

With the exception of B646L, four of these genes encode for at least one transmembrane domains and one of these (EP402R) encodes for a CD2 homologue adhesion protein (CD2v). B646L had a relatively low 107 Vaxign ranking likely due to the absence of any transmembrane domains and a low adhesion probability. However, p72 is a major component of the virus capsomer, accounting for approximately one-third of the virus protein mass (Garc\u00eda-Escudero et al., 1998) . Moreover, p72 is known to be associated with membranes in infected cells and p72-specific antibodies block ASFV entry in a way that suggests that p72 may play some role in host target cell attachment (G\u00f3mez-Puertas et al., 1996) . Interestingly, E183L had the highest adhesion probability of the five antigens used in the swine immunogenicity study, and has been demonstrated to possess neutralizing activity to block virus attachment to host cell targets (G\u00f3mez-Puertas et al., 1996) .",

This outcome was somewhat unexpected since this expression system elicited antibodies when used with other antigens (Brewoo et al., 2010) and another viral-vector system (human adenovirus 5) elicited antibodies when used with some of the same (E183L, B646L) antigens (Lokhandwala et al., 2016) . The lack of antibody response may be related to a defect in antigen presentation, e.g., the retention of the MVA expressed ASFV antigens inside infected cells may have limited their presentation to B-cells (Borrego et al., 2006; Ganges et al., 2005) . The use of molecular elements such as tPA to enhance intracellularly expressed antigen secretion for B-cell recognition and MHC II presentation for priming of helper CD4 T-cells (Brewoo et al., 2010; Embry et al., 2011) has been previously reported. Since the administered MVA-ASFV constructs lacked the secretory tPA signal, the absence of observed antibody response may be due to limited B-cell presentation. Subsequent to the results reported herein, we have been successful in the construction of seven, stable MVA-tPA-ASFV virus recombinants that could be evaluated in future swine immunogenicity studies for their ability to induce antibody and T-cell response (Lopera-Madrid, unpublished data).",

Antigen-specific T-cell proliferation responses to B646L were detected in PBMCs from homologous HEK-ASFV antigens prime-boost treatment group (T1). Although no statistically significant difference in mean antigen-specific T-cell proliferation responses were detected in PMBCs from MVA-ASFV homologous and heterologous prime-boost treatment groups (T3 and T4) and negative controls (T5), antigen-specific T-cell proliferation responses to all immunizing antigens, EP153R, EP402R, and B646L, were observed in PBMCs from individual pigs in both treatment groups (Fig. 5) . Furthermore, ASFV antigen specific IFN-\u2425 + T-cell responses were detected in PBMCs from MVA-ASFV primed and HEK-ASFV antigens boosted pigs (T3). These results are in congruence with previous reports that emphasize the importance of heterologous prime/boost regimes (Boyd et al., 2013; Draper et al., 2013; Pattacini et al., 2012; Ratto-Kim et al., 2012) and correlate with recent relevant reports. Interestingly, antigen-specific IFN-\u2425 + T-cell responses to B646L were also observed following an adenoviral-vector homologous prime/boost immunization strategy (Lokhandwala et al., 2016) . However it should be noted that the correlation between IFN-\u2425 + T-cell responses and host protection against ASFV remains unclear, at least in the context of using live, attenuated ASFV models (Carlson et al., 2016) . The current study results also correlate with the recent study using ASFV interserotypic CD2 v (EP402R)/C-type lectin (EP153R) recombinant chimeric viruses and vaccination/challenge experiments in swine, which demonstrated partial protection as defined by delayed timeto death (3 days), onset of fever, and onset of viraemia. The partial protection was likely due to host response to homologous CD2 v and C-type lectin antigens and provide evidence that these antigens are important for homologous protective immunity (Burmakina et al., 2016) . The Burmakina et al. report and the data and Vaxign ranking reported herein support the potential role of CD2 v (rank 15) and C-type lectin (rank 17) as protective antigens.",

The antibody and T-cell activity reported with this adenovirus-vectored ASFV multiantigen cocktail appears to be more robust and broader compared to the MVA-ASFV prime/HEK-ASF antigen boost strategy used in the present study. One possible explanation for this difference is that the time interval between the prime and boost doses may be critical to the generation of optimal immune responses. In the adenovirus-vectored ASFV study a 14-week time interval was used compared to the 4 week interval in the current study. A protracted time period may allow for the induction of higher numbers of antigen-specific memory cells. Alternatively, the two different adjuvant systems used in the adenovirus-vectored study may be more potent than the TS6 adjuvant used in the current study.",

Previous studies have demonstrated the important role of T-cell mediated immunity in host protection against ASFV infection. In one study, pigs immunized with the live, attenuated OUR/T88/3 isolate were protected from subsequent challenge with the virulent, parental OUR/T88/1 isolate. Subsequent depletion of CD8 + cells in live, attenuated OUR/T88/3 immunized swine resulted in disease susceptibility following virulent OUR/T88/1 challenge thus demonstrating the importance of cell-mediated immunity in protection from ASFV (Oura et al., 2005) . Another study demonstrated that an experimental DNA vaccine comprised of an ubiquitin tagged p30-p54-soluble CD2v hemagglutinin induced antigen-specific CD8 + T-cell responses and conferred partial protection in the absence of detectable ASFV antibodies (Argilaguet et al., 2012) . Similarly, another study that used a baculovirus-based mammalian cell expressed fusion p30-p54-soluble CD2v hemagglutinin protein also demonstrated partial protection that correlated with virus-specific IFN-\u2425-secreting T-cells in the absence of antibodies . A follow-up study to identify additional protective T-cell determinants in which an entire ASFV genomic expression library lacking CD2v, p54, and p30 was used for vaccination resulted in 60% of the vaccinated pigs being protected when challenged with E75. Protection was correlated with detection of specific CD8+ T-cell responses in the absence of detectable specific antibodies prior to challenge (Lacasta et al., 2014) .",

This report demonstrates how Vaxign, an in silico antigen prediction program, can be used as a tool to help identify and rank potential antigenic features of novel ASFV proteins. This is the first reported study to apply the Vaxign tool, express a down selected subset of five ASFV antigens in both a mammalian (HEK 293) as well as MVA viral vector system, and demonstrate safety and antigenicity in swine. Vaccination with HEK-purified ASFV proteins promoted humoral immune responses and detectable but less intense cellular immunity. Even though humoral immune responses were not induced following MVA-ASFV vaccination, cellular immunity characterized by T-cell proliferation and IFN-\u2425 producing cells was observed. The induced T-cell responses using a heterologous MVA-ASFV prime/HEK-ASFV antigen boost immunization regimen support the rationale for future studies to better define these responses and to determine a correlation, if any, to protection against subsequent challenge with ASFV Georgia 2007/1. If robust T-cell and B-cell ASFV immune responses can be consistently obtained in immunized swine using this strategy and approach, then the prime-boost regimen comprised of the best ASFV antigens can be used in future studies to evaluate ASFV vaccine candidates for their ability to induce a durable, protective immunity against virulent homologous and heterologous ASFV challenge.",
