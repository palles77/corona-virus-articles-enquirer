The effects of 30 MAbs on viral replication of the encephalitis-derived HSV-1 strain 2762 and its less neuroinvasive variant 2762p11 were assayed in this model . One MAb reactive with gD gave a nine-fold reduction of the virus yields of both strains . One MAb directed against gB gave an enhanced virus yield of strain 2762, but not of the 2762p11 variant . Another gB-reactive MAb decreased the virus yield of strain 2762pll, but not of 2762 after neuritic infection . The findings indicate that an alteration of gB has occurred during the passage of the strain 2762 . Mutants of the same strain were derived by infecting hybridomas producing MAb reactive with gB, gC, gD and gE, respectively . The gB hybridoma mutant showed a significantly lower neuroinvasiveness in the DRG model, and was non-virulent after snout infection of mice .

Derivation of hybridoma, mutants has earlier been used in the study of the neurovirulence of coronavirus JHM . 25 When we applied this technique on the strain 2762, a mutant derived from the hybridomaproducing MAb cell line, 4G2G5 (gE), showed a reduced neuroinvasiveness in the DRG model . This mutant was also non-lethal after snout inoculation of mice . As reported by Rajcani et al ., 28 a gE minus mutant of the encephalitogenic strain ANGpath was not taken up by neurons nor axonally transported to the trigeminal ganglia after peripheral inoculation into mice . We observed an even stronger reduction of the neuroinvasiveness with the gB hybridoma mutant B3G11 E8. The observed >one \"log reduction of in vitro neuroinvasiveness was in parity with the earlier described difference between encephalitis-causing and oral HSV-1 strains, using the same model .'\u00b0F urthermore, this mutant was also non-lethal after peripheral inoculation in our mouse model . Although sequencing has as yet not been carried out, the characterization by EIA and RIP indicated that probably only minor genetic changes had occurred .
