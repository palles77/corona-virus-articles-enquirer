            "text": "While commercial forms of Chinese hospitality have existed since ancient times, the contemporary form of China's hotel industry has been shaped by two main timeframes. The first is 1949, when the establishment of the People's Republic and the advent of communist rule introduced an insular society focused on internal political struggle, resulting in the country's international isolation. This isolation was most notably evidenced through lack of participation in the transnational travel environment, and was an era characterised by suppressed tourism and limited hotel development (Pine & Qi, 2003, Chapter 13) . The second is 1978, which saw the initiation of a programme of ongoing \"Open Door\" economic and social reforms. These reforms have progressively engaged China with the world, inviting foreign direct investment (FDI) and tourists, since facilitating a rapid expansion of the country's tourism industry (Guangrui, 2003, Chapter 2; Zhang, Pine, & Lam, 2005) .",

During the transition, China endeavours to integrate the challenges of globalisation with national culture and values (Huang, 2008) . The hotel trade was among the first industries to act on the opportunities offered by China's opening to FDI. Consequently, foreign multinational hospitality firms have benefitted from first mover status as the pioneers of inbound FDI in the early 1980s (Pine & Qi, 2003, Chapter 13) . The Chinese hotel industry has grown rapidly since the first international hotel joint venture in 1982 (Stross, 1990) . In 2008, 18 of the largest hotel companies in the world were headquartered in China, half of which were in Hong Kong and half in the Mainland (Gale, 2009) .",

Four research themes were identified from this review study. They were (1) strategy and development, (2) marketing, (3) service quality, and (4) human resource management. The authors also provided a summary list of the 66 publications, albeit with limited analysis and discussion.

A systematic review consists of a comprehensive search for relevant studies on a specific topic, followed by appraisal and synthesis of those studies according to a predetermined method. Meta-analysis is an appraisal of studies where findings among the studies are directly comparable with each other. Meta-analysis may also apply quantitative methods that compensate for methodological variations among the studies in order to render the findings metrically equivalent. Meta-interpretation takes an interpretivist approach to the synthesis of multiple studies on a topic that have used disparate methods, typically using qualitative techniques for analysis (Weed, 2006) .

Such variability of interpretation is to be expected among methods for which a single, definitive framework is yet to be determined. Shelby and Vaske (2008) provide a useful analysis of the methodological definitional dilemmas in review studies, identifying the main areas of confusion as (1) total methodology vs. an analysis technique, (2) the use of effect sizes, (3) the unit of analysis, and (4) meta-analysis vs. comparative analysis.",

Table 3 shows extant China tourism and hospitality literature synthesis studies, all of which use systematic review via content analysis to produce diverse findings. Common content analysis approaches found in review studies include attempts at categorising research themes, settings, and methods. Electronic databases are the preferred sources for data, which are mostly searched by keywords. Some authors place the bodies of literature within their political, economic, geographical, social and cultural contexts. There are also attempts to identify contested perspectives and modes of thought, and to forecast and recommend the directions for future research. The present study adopted the systematic review approach, characterised by a comprehensive search for relevant studies on China hotel research, which were then evaluated and synthesised according to the content analysis method. The systematic review approach provides a rigorous and transparent compilation that serves to map an area containing dispersed and diverse knowledge (Weed, 2006) .",

Hospitality and Tourism Complete collects full text research articles, abstracts and industry news relating to all areas of hospitality and tourism after 1965 and covers a large range of major hospitality and tourism research journals. Science Direct is recognised as a major database for scientific research covering disciplines of both social and physical sciences. We believe the combination of using the two databases would provide a most cost-effective way to locate English language academic literature in relation to China hotel research. The pool of 115 papers selected met the criteria of English language refereed academic journal papers. In-press papers, book chapters and book reviews were excluded.",

Simple cross-tabulation was adopted to identify the trends of research development. Absolute counting was used to determine research productivity of individuals and institutions as suggested by prior studies (e.g., Law & Cheung, 2008) . If more than one author appeared in one paper, each co-author was given the same credit as a sole author. Although some papers adopted both quantitative and qualitative methods, papers were coded as following either a predominately qualitative or a quantitative approach . The same principle was also applied to research themes. Each paper was classified into one main theme category even though the paper may be related to a different theme to a lesser extent.",

Burke, Koyuncu, Wang, and Fiksenbaum (2009) examined potential antecedents and consequences of work engagement in hotel managers. Li, Tse, and Xie (2007) investigated general managers' demographic characteristics and career paths.

Research on how to integrate corporate culture into national culture showed the necessity to manage cultural conflict for international companies (Mwaura, Sutton, & Roberts, 1998; Pang, Roberts, & Sutton, 1998) . A case study of the New Chinese Hotel project in China showed the impact of cross cultural management on international construction in China (Pheng & Leong, 2000) . Otis (2008) focused on management in terms of combining foreign organisational template and service protocols with local regional and ethnic identities to discipline the workforce. Cai and Ninemeier (1993) revealed cultural conflict on food service styles and how Chinese hoteliers cope with the situation. Another cultural conflict management study conducted by Smith, Wang, and Leung (1997) showed large differences between Chinese and non-Chinese operators in daily management routines. Hu, Cai, and Kavanaugh (2001) examined the impact of cultural differences on employee behaviours in China and UK hotels. Littrell (2002) compared desirable and actual leadership traits exhibited by managers and supervisors and found that leadership traits outside task and person orientation appear to be highly culture-specific.",

However, China's membership in WTO also meant less government control in the hotel industry and vulnerability of local industry to greater competition from foreign companies (Pine, 2002) . The booming domestic demand, coupled with fierce competition from international markets, caused China hotels to emphasise strategy and performance. Pine and Phillips (2005) compared hotel performances in variation with ownership, size and star grade and indicated that better performance occurred in hotels either with a foreign ownership, bigger or with a higher star grade. Tse (2004, 2006) investigated the link between entrepreneurial organisation structure and hotel performance, and found that entrepreneurial strategic posture was positively associated with performance, while organic structures were negatively associated with performance. Organic structures were identified as those that allow less strict task differentiation, less clear hierarchy, and a relatively higher degree of autonomy.",

Most studies dealt with topics on hotel structures (Yu, 1998) , some together with business expansion strategies (e.g., Lee, 2002) . With the influence of globalisation and economic development, hotel managers tend to search for new approaches to expand their business. Brand affiliation (Cai, 2004) , franchising (Heung, Zhang, & Jiang, 2008; Pine, Zhang, & Qi, 2000; Xiao, O'Neill, & Wang, 2008) , and joint-venture were the most popular ways of hotel business expansion in China. Pine and Qi (2004) identified and discussed barriers in hotel chain development. Tibbitts (2003) analysed current expansion of the international chains in terms of key implications, brand building, challenges and opportunities, and important contributions and points of differentiation between the international chains and domestic hotels. Wu, Costa, and Teare (1998) examined the relationship between environmental scanning activities and business expansion strategies. Spatial distribution of hotels in China was discussed in Begin's (2000) and Shu and Dai's (2006) studies. Yu (1992b) noted the roles of various Chinese government agencies and foreign investors in the development of China hotels. Challenges facing other aspects of hotel development have been discussed as well. Cook (1989) analysed problems in the development of the hospitality industry and gave advice to foreign developers to collaborate in China. Mak (2008) revealed causes of problems facing state-owned hotels and future development. Chan and Yeung (2009) suggested that contingency planning is important for hotels in cases of crisis and changes.",

Economic conditions and Chinese business culture were also identified as important environmental factors for international hotel chains to enter the China market.

Qu and Ennew (2008) explored the external influence of market environment on the development of market orientation. Other less directly-related issues were also addressed by researchers, for instance, Jackson (2006) suggested to develop regional tourism clusters including hotels in order to foster competitive advantage in regional China; Chan et al.

Given the fact that earlier papers may not be available online, it still makes sense that hotel development in China has attracted increasing research attention from academics, especially after the year of 1997. In general, three reasons may have attributed to the continual growing publications. Firstly, China's economy continues growing and the hotel sector plays an important part in the national economy. The huge market in China attracts increasing foreign investment and cooperation between international firms and domestic firms has been strengthened. Secondly, the hospitality industry in China has also undergone gradual changes. Technological developments offer new revenues for hotel development. The unique Chinese culture also brings challenges for hotel operators. Thirdly, there is an increasing demand for tourism education and training. Education has been highly emphasised by the increasing amount of investment at different levels (Law & Cheung, 2008) . Tourism has integrated into degree offering programmes in most universities. As a result, more research publications emerged to provide better understanding of the fast growing industry.",

From 1978 to 1994, foreign investment was introduced and the industry experienced an unprecedented growth. In 1995 and 1996 the heated growth slowed down and the average hotel occupancy rate dropped below 60% . In terms of management, until late 2001, overseas involvement in China's hotel industry, while encouraged and even supported by the state politically and financially, was still under government control .

The number of papers focusing on development issues fluctuated during the past 26 years with an apparent increase in 2008. Papers investigating environmental issues only appeared after 2000, with the number increasing sharply from 2005 to 2008.

However, by extending the literature search scope and including more relevant research papers, the present study also identified hotel operation and performance, marketing and finance as salient research themes under the general hotel management and performance category. In addition, hotel development strategies and business environment issues were identified as another two significant research themes which appear to be related to the general Chinese macro economic situation and addressing external issues to hotel operation. Interestingly, our present study found that business environment issues became a research concern only after the turn of the century. This may be due to China's further integration into the world economy marked by its entry into the World Trade Organisation in 2001. In Tsang and Hsu's (2011) study, out of a total of 119 papers, 13 were identified to fall into the theme of hotel development. As Tsang and Hsu's study covers the general literature of China tourism and hospitality research and their review scope appears to be much broader than that in our current study, little meaningful comparison can be drawn between our study findings and theirs. Our present study actually provided a much more focused 'zoom-in' view on China hotel research.",

As expected in the early stages of a developing literature, we find considerable diversity in the types of themes and their respective frequencies. An examination of the study designs employed in review studies suggests methodological variability in: (1) choice of time periods under study; (2) sources from which papers are drawn; (3) search keywords; (4) and factors for measurement. Types of analysis contribute further to diversity, as different groups of authors interpret the papers under study in different ways. Thus interpretation of findings must be done cautiously, and the most thorough understanding may be gained by considering the findings of such review studies in the aggregate level. The present study provides insights into China hotel research via a systematic review of research themes and trends. Through analysis of the publications under study, we have demonstrated the diverse and changing nature of how scholars have examined the issues around China hotel research. However, the present review also suggests that China hotel researchers do not share a unified agenda, and have multiple competing perspectives. This may be an organic and desirable way for the research discourse to grow. Indeed, it may be too soon to expect mature coalescences of contested perspectives in a literature only a few decades old, especially given the dynamic environment within which China pursues its socialist economic reforms (Huang, 2008) .",
