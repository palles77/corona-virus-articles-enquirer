Sequence analysis suggested that these peptides are similar with 1368 GPRLQPY 1374 found at the carboxy-terminal of the S protein. In neutralization inhibition assays, the two peptide motifs and a 24mer synthetic peptide corresponding to the C-terminal endodomain of PEDV S protein were observed to compete for the antigen binding site of 2C10, as demonstrated by the loss or reduction of neutralizing activity of the monoclonal antibody.

Because of the economic importance of PED in the swine industry, measures to control the spread of the disease have led to the development of live attenuated vaccines. It began with the work of Hofmann and Wyler (1988) when they successfully propagated PEDV in Vero cells. Later, Bernasconi et al. (1995) reported that after multiple passages of PEDV CV777 in Vero cells, the cell adapted strain differed significantly from the parental strain both in terms of genomic sequence and pathogenicity. In a similar study, Kweon et al. (1999) reported that another cell adapted strain of PEDV induced protective immunity in pregnant sows that were transferable to lactating piglets. However, in spite of these developments, PED still persist in several provinces in the Asian region. Thus, there is a need to understand the mechanism of viral entry and pathogenesis. Such information would be valuable in developing more effective vaccines in the future.",

Higher dilutions of this phage (1:500 and 1:2500) also demonstrated inhibiting properties against 2C10 (47.2% and 30.2%, respectively). A similar trend was observed for phages displaying GPRPVTH. Phage dilution of 1:100 completely inhibited neutralizing activity of 2C10 while higher dilutions of this phage (1:500 and 1:2500) resulted in lower inhibitions (66.1% and 20.8%, respectively).

The CO-26K (collagenase digested fragment) is a conserved region discovered on the S protein of TGEV and was previously shown to include most of the critical epitopes important for virus neutralization (Delmas et al., 1986 (Delmas et al., , 1990 . Chang et al. (2002) expressed the recombinant COE in E. coli and used that to generate polyclonal antibodies in mice. The antibodies were demonstrated to possess neutralizing activity against PEDV in plaque assay experiments using Vero cells as host. However, sequence comparison among PEDV strains identified in recent outbreaks in Korea (Cruz et al. unpublished data) revealed numerous differences on the COE domain of the S protein, implying that antibodies that recognize critical epitopes on the COE of one strain of PEDV may not be able to recognize that of another strain.",

            "text": "In this study, we identified the peptide sequence recognized by 2C10, a monoclonal antibody that has neutralizing activity against PEDV, using a phage peptide library. Our findings revealed two peptide motifs, SHRLP(Y/Q)(P/V) and GPRPVTH. Phages displaying these peptides showed strong binding affinity to 2C10 and demonstrated their ability to block the neutralizing activity of 2C10. It is quite interesting to note that these peptides were found to share a homology with the region on the C-terminal cytoplasmic tail of the S protein. Two peptide molecules were synthesized based on this region. The S-CT(24) which contained the GPRLQPY motif inhibited the PEDV neutralizing activity of 2C10. In contrast, S-CT(17) which had the GPRQPY motif deleted, failed to inhibit the neutralizing activity of 2C10. This strengthens our hypothesis that the phage peptides SHRLP(Y/Q)(P/V) and GPRPVTH share antigenic similarities with the 1368 GPRLQPY 1374 motif found on the cytoplasmic domain of the S protein. Because of the inaccessibility of this region in intact virions to neutralizing antibodies, it raises the question of whether the C-terminal endodomain of the S protein indeed has a neutralizing epitope or that the newly identified peptide sequence share a structural similarity with a conformational epitope in another region of the glycoprotein. Virus neutralization involves blocking the early stages of the virus replication cycle, namely the attachment and entry into the host cell. This is usually mediated by antibodies that block the receptor binding sites on the surface of the virus or other related sites involved in virus integration into the host. Most of the neutralizing epitopes involved with virus attachment and entry are located on the surface of the virus and are easily accessible to the antibodies. However, some epitopes may exist on sites that are thought to be inaccessible to antibodies (Cleveland et al., 2003) . Until now, only a few neutralizing epitopes located on the cytoplasmic domain of transmembrane proteins have been identified. The envelope glycoprotein gp41 in HIV-1 was first reported to contain the neutralizing epitope 746 ERDRD 750 at the C-terminal endodomain (Broliden et al., 1992; Vella et al., 1993) . However, this finding has been highly controversial since antibodies cannot cross the lipid bilayer envelope membrane. Buratti et al. (1997) suggested that this discrepancy can be explained by the existence of a similar epitope exposed on the ectodomain of the p17 matrix protein which is cross-reacting with the antibodies directed to the gp41 epitope. Incidentally, this transmembrane protein is involved in virus replication and has been a target of several candidate HIV-1 vaccines (Boucher et al., 1990; Naylor et al., 1987) . Cheung et al. (2005) proposed a theoretical model that suggests that the C-terminal of gp41 spans the membrane several times and that the 746 ERDRD 750 epitope is constantly exposed on the surface of HIV-1. At present, the exact topology of the 746 ERDRD 750 and how antibodies that bind specifically to this epitope are able to inhibit virus infection is not fully known.",

In contrast, peptide residues of a conformational or discontinuous epitope maybe several amino acids apart on a linearized protein but are spatially juxtaposed in a folded protein resulting from internal disulfide bonds, addition of carbohydrate side-chains and other post-translational modifications. Coronaviruses have highly complex peplomers. The S protein is about 175 to 180 kDa and forms a homotrimer with a highly glycosylated terminal. It also contains two hydrophobic (heptad) repeat regions that forms the fusion core complex (Delmas et al., 1986; Jan Bosch et al., 2003) . In the case of PEDV, the S protein is a 1383-to 1386-amino-acid transmembrane glycoprotein that has 27 to 29 potential N-linked glycosylation sites, a stretch of hydrophobic residues proximal to the C-terminal believed to function as the membrane anchor, and lacks the proteolytic cleavage site to yield cleaved amino and carboxy subunits S1 and S2, similar to the TGEV subset (Duarte and Laude, 1994; Yeo et al., 2003) . There is the likelihood that the 2C10 monoclonal antibody recognizes a discontinuous epitope on PEDV that is structurally similar with the SHRLP(Y/Q)(P/V) and GPRPVTH peptides.",

However, when a monoclonal antibody used to probe the peptide library recognize a discontinuous epitope, the resulting peptide sequences may vary or may not match any regions on the target protein (D'Mello et al., 1999; Geysen et al., 1984) . Although such characteristic limits the ability of this technique in identifying the primary sequence of discontinuous epitopes, the use of peptide libraries does offer the advantage of determining antigen-antibody interaction and structural homology between discontinuous epitopes and linear peptides (Al-Bukhari et al., 2002; Houghten, 1985) . For the past decade, phage peptide libraries have been used extensively to identify the primary sequences of continuous and discontinuous epitopes of different viruses like dengue virus (Wu et al., 2003) , human papillomavirus (Santamaria et al., 2001 ), hepatitis C virus (Petit et al., 2003) , porcine reproductive, and respiratory virus (Ostrowski et al., 2002) , HIV (Scala et al., 1999) and coronaviruses like MHV (Yu et al., 2000) and SARS CoV (Zhong et al., 2005) . Aside from identifying probable epitopes, these functional linear epitopes can be used as mimitopes in subunit vaccines. Several candidate subunit vaccines derived from phage peptide libraries have been tested against certain diseases (Meola et al., 1995; Puntoriero et al., 1998; Tumanova et al., 2001) .",

After 1-h incubation at 37\u00b0C for 1 h, the monolayer was overlaid with 2.5 ml 1% agarose in EMEM supplemented with 0.001% trypsin and continued incubation at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO 2 . After 24 h, second agarose overlay containing 0.01% neutral red was added. The cell monolayers were fixed with 3.5% formaldehyde in PBS after 24 h, then permanently stained with crystal violet solution. The monoclonal antibody that reduced plaque formation by more than 50% at a dilution of 1:400 was used for screening of the phage peptide library.",

Briefly, a well of a 96-well microtiter plate was sensitized with 25 \u03bcg of selected MAb and incubated at 4\u00b0C overnight. Blocking was performed with 350 \u03bcl of BSA (5 mg/ml) in 50 mM Trisbuffered saline (TBS) for 1 h at room temperature followed by six times washing with 50 mM TBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 (0.1% TBS-T) to remove excess antibody and blocking reagent. Approximately 2 \u00d7 10 11 pfu recombinant phages were added to the well and incubated for 1 h. Unbound phages were removed by ten times washing with 0.1% TBS-T. Antibody-bound phages were eluted by treatment with 100 \u03bcl of 0.2 M Glycine-HCl (pH 2.2) followed by 15 \u03bcl of 1M Tris-Cl (pH 9.1) containing BSA. The eluted phages were amplified in log phase E. coli ER2738 and harvested in the culture supernatant at 12,000 \u00d7 g for 10 min and concentrated by PEG/NaCl precipitation. Bio-panning was repeated 3 times on amplified phage eluate using a wash buffer containing 0.5% Tween 20 (0.5% TBS-T) to enrich the pool of phages with strong binding affinity to the MAb. Eluted and amplified phages were titrated after each panning.",
