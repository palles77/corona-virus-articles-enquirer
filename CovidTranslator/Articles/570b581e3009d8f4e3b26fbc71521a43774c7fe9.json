            "text": "The application of the immunoperoxidase (IP) plaque staining procedure (IP test) to the diagnosis of canine coronavirus (CCV) infection was investigated. The IP test did not react with sera from either 15 speci\u00a2c pathogen-free (SPF) dogs or 7 SPF dogs immunized with a multivalent vaccine, including canine parvovirus type 2, canine distemper virus, canine adenovirus type 2, and canine parain\u00a3uenza virus. To compare the IP test with the neutralizing test (NT), sera from 240 healthy dogs and from 3 experimentally CCV-infected dogs were examined. All 60 sera positive for NT antibody were positive for IP antibody, and all 180 sera negative for NT antibody were negative for IP antibody in the healthy dogs. The IP titres showed similar changes with time after CCV inoculation to those of the NT titres in the experimentally infected dogs. These \u00a2ndings indicate that the IP test speci\u00a2cally detected anti-CCV antibodies. When the IP test and NT were compared in dogs with diarrhoeic signs. 2.1% of 48 sera and 20.3% of 74 sera, which were all negative for NT antibody, were positive for IP antibody in the dogs of under one year of age and at least one year of age, respectively. The di\u00a1erence between the IP and NT titres (log 10 [reciprocal of IP titre]^log 10 [reciprocal of NT titre]) for the diarrhoeic dogs of under one year of age (2.350+0.931) was signi\u00a2cantly larger than that for the healthy dogs (0.982+0.447) (p50.0001), the NT titre being negative or very low, despite a high IP titre in many diarrhoeic dogs. Hence, the IP test is more able to detect anti-CCV antibodies, especially in dogs showing clinical signs. The IP-positivity rate was signi\u00a2cantly higher in the diarrhoeic dogs of under one year of age (48.7%) than in the healthy dogs (25.0%) (w 2 = 19.844, p50.0001), suggesting that CCV may contribute to diarrhoea in many juvenile dogs.",

In Japan, Yasoshima and colleagues (1983) isolated CCV from a canine parvovirus (CPV)-infected dog in 1982. Together with CPV, CCV is now recognized as an important cause of diarrhoea in dogs. CCV infection is highly prevalent, but the mortality is generally low and the prognosis is good. However, mixed infections with other viruses and bacteria are frequent, and the resultant signs may be serious, especially with concurrent CPV infection (Appel et al., 1979) .",

However, the former technique requires an expensive instrument, while the latter takes days to complete and the viral activity may easily be reduced by mistreatment of the collected faeces (Tennant et al., 1994) . Moreoever, no virus is excreted in the faeces of some CCV-infected dogs (Kokubu et al., 1998) . Therefore, antigen detection in faeces is not a reliable diagnostic method. In contrast, detecting antibody against CCV is a reliable diagnostic procedure, especially using paired sera, since the antibodies remain in the blood for a prolonged period after infection.",

Over time after CCV infection, the IP titres showed similar changes to the NT titres. These \u00a2ndings indicate that the IP test can speci\u00a2cally detect anti-CCV antibodies. In contrast, in diarrhoeic dogs of less than one year of age, and the diarrhoeic dogs of at least one year of age, 20.3% and 2.1%, respectively, of NTnegative dogs were IP-positive. The consistencies between the IP and NT titres in the diarrhoeic dogs (under one year of age, 2SD = 1.862; at least one year of age, 2SD = 1.792) were lower than in the healthy dogs (2SD = 0.894). The di\u00a1erence between IP and NT titres in the diarrhoeic dogs of less than one year of age was signi\u00a2cantly large compared to that in the healthy dogs, the NT titre being negative or very low, despite a high IP titre in many diarhoeic dogs. According to Palmer-Densmore and colleagues (1998), anti-nucleocapsid (N) protein antibodies appear in the blood circulation earlier than anti-spike (S) protein antibodies after infection with CCV. S protein carries neutralizing epitopes, while N protein is the most abundant protein in CCV (Garwes and Reynolds, 1981) . As the IP test detects both the anti-S protein and the anti-N protein antibodies, it can detect the infection in dogs producing few or no antibodies The fact that the IP positivity rate for the diarrhoeic dogs of less than one year of age was signi\u00a2cantly higher than that for the healthy dogs may indicate that CCV contributes to diarrhoea in many juvenile dogs in the general pet population.
