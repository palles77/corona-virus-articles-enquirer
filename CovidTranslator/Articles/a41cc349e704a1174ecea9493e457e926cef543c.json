The detection of the three active components is linear in concentrations ranging from 100 to 1500 ng/mL, the squared correlation coefficient is higher than 0.996, the precision as measured by the relative standard deviation is no larger than 9.5%, and the recovery is greater than 86.6%. The analysis of the 21 Banlangen samples led to considerably different conclusions on the contents of tryptanthrin, indigo, and indirubin in fresh leaves versus those in dried leaves. These results should shed some light on future plant selection and breeding. Compared with the traditional TLC and HPLC-UV methods, the new LC-APCI-MS approach has proven to be an optimal tool for detecting and analyzing the three marker compounds in the Chinese herbal medicines of Daqingye and Banlangen.",

Their leaves and roots known as Daqingye and Banlangen, respectively, have been used in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) for hundreds of years as antipyretic, antiviral, anti-inflammatory, and anti-influenza agents [1, 2] . During the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, both Daqingye and Banlangen were prescribed to treat patients in China although there was no medical evidence suggesting their applicability. Since then, they have become two of the most popular TCMs.",

            "text": "Over the last decade, more than 50 chemical constituents have been identified in Daqinye and Banlangen including alkaloids [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] , sucrose [5, 6] , organic acids [3, 10] , and glycosides * Correspondence to: Department of Chemistry, National Chung-Hsing Uni- [7, 9] . Among them, three alkaloids are selected as the markers for quality control in this paper due to their unique pharmaceutical activities: tryptanthrin, indigo, and indirubin ( Fig. 1) . Tryptanthrin, or indolo-[2,1-b]-quinozoline-6,12-dione, is an indoloquinazoline alkaloid that strongly inhibits cycloxygenase-2 (COX-2) in cellular assays (IC 50 64 nm in Mono Mac 6 cells) [11] . It was reported that tryptanthrin is also a 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) inhibitor in vitro-pharmacological investigations [12] . Indigo and indirubin are structural isomers. Indigo is one of the oldest natural blue dye stuffs and had been used by the Asians to color artificial crafts until synthetic indigo was marketed at the end of last century. However, indigo is more than just a natural pigment since Sugihara et al. demonstrated that both indigo and indirubin have physiological effects on liver microsomes in mice [13] . They also possess the property of inducing ethoxyresorufin-O-dealkylase (EROD) as well as methoxyresorufin-O-dealkylase (MROD) activities and the influence is mediated by the hydrocarbon receptor. In addition, indigo derivates and indirubin have been proven to have curative effects on anti-cancer drugs in humans and chronic leukemia inhibitors in mice [14, 15] . Most recently, indirubin has been shown to inhibit the chemokine regulated on activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted (RANTES) [16] . The majority of methods for detecting tryptanthrin in Isatis plants are based on the scan mode of thin layer chromatography (TLC) and high performance liquid chromatography with an ultraviolet detector (HPLC-UV) [12] . Currently, liquid chromatography (LC) coupled with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) has been successfully employed to analyze another Isatis species plant I. tinctoria [17] . For the detection of indigo and indirubin, the most common methodologies are TLC, HPLC-UV [18] [19] [20] , and fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry (FAB-MS) [21] . Szostek et al. and Puchalska et al. recently used LC-MS to investigate the natural dyes (including indigo and indirubin) in Coptic textiles and historical art objects [22, 23] , but the matrix effect is quite different from that in TCMs.",

By integrating it with the technique of atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI), we propose the use of LC-APCI-MS to quantify the amounts of the three active components contained in Daqingye and Balangen. In other words, the main objective of this paper is to employ the new method in the SIM scan mode to simultaneously evaluate tryptanthrin, indigo, and indirubin as the marker standards for quality control of related herbs. To validate its effectiveness, our approach will be applied to fresh and dried leaves of some dye plants.",

The experimental results indicated that the water contents on six fresh leaves samples varied between 81.8 and 85.6%, and their standard deviations ranged from 0.1 to 4.3%, therefore, the dry weight for each of them can be calculated based on its water content, respectively.
