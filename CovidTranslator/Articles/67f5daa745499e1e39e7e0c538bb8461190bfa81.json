This study had the objectives of determining the oral manifestations of diseases caused by bioterrorist agents, measuring the prevalence of these manifestations in emergency department reports, and constructing and evaluating a detection algorithm based on them. We developed a software application to detect oral manifestations in free text and identified positive reports over three years of data. The normal frequency in reports for oral manifestations related to anthrax (including buccal ulcers-sore throat) was 7.46%. The frequency for tularemia was 6.91%. For botulism and smallpox, the frequencies were 0.55% and 0.23%. We simulated outbreaks for these bioterrorism diseases and evaluated the performance of our system. The detection algorithm performed better for smallpox and botulism than for anthrax and tularemia. We found that oral manifestations can be a valuable tool for biosurveillance.",

The reports were de-identified (Gupta et al., 2004) , and the date was substituted with the report's number for the week in the year of record. Our application searched each report for the listed terms (Table 1) . When a term was found, the application checked whether the term was negated (e.g., \"lacking oral ulcers\") (Chapman et al., 2001) . Once the application verified a positive report (i.e., that the term was not negated), it recorded a \"hit\" (case of interest) for the year and week of the report. Additional terms in the same report were ignored. Subsequently, the number of hits was plotted over time in Microsoft Excel (Redmond, WA, USA).

Because no outbreaks of the 4 diseases occurred in Pittsburgh from 2001 to 2003, we simulated their effect on our baseline data (Wallstrom et al., 2005) . For each of the 4 diseases, we assumed that each case had a probability of 0.4 of visiting an emergency department with oral symptoms. Since our surveillance system uses data from only one emergency department, we used published emergency department utilization data (Pennsylvania Department of Health, 2007) to estimate that each emergency department visit had a 0.0876 probability of being captured by our surveillance system. We estimated the case-detection sensitivity for our system as 0.9 for all 4 diseases.

Using a four-component stochastic disease model, we selected an initial number of cases, and assumed that each patient infected 1.5 other individuals (Meltzer et al., 2001) , that all patients remained in the region covered by the surveillance system, and that no intervention (e.g., quarantine) was undertaken.

Selecting this interval provided at least 16 weeks of training data for the algorithm and 12 weeks to observe the effect of each outbreak. We simulated outbreaks of anthrax, tularemia, and botulism with 100, 500, and 1000 cases, and for smallpox with 1, 10, and 50 initial cases. For each simulated outbreak, we constructed a time series of emergency department visits, ran our detection algorithm on the series, and determined the number of weeks, if any, from the initial exposure that the algorithm produced an alert. When our algorithm did not detect an outbreak, we assumed that other methods would finally detect it in the week following the last week of the simulated outbreak. We characterized overall sensitivity of detection using receiver operating characteristic curves that display the relationship between false alarm rate (controlled by the parameter k) and sensitivity. We also used activity monitor operating characteristic curves (Fawcett and Provost, 1999) to show the relationship between false alarm rate and detection timeliness. This analysis allows public health officials to evaluate a specific surveillance system according to the potential costs of false alarms. The University of Pittsburgh's IRB approved this study as exempt (approval #0406164).",

Nevertheless, we captured the frequency of related oral manifestations naturally occurring as recorded by physicians from 2001-2003 (Table 2) . Out of a total of 199,691 emergency department reports, 30,233 contained at least one term of interest. As shown (Table 2) , the highest term frequencies were found for anthrax (including buccal ulcers, sore throat) and tularemia (e.g., tonsillitis), both at approximately 7%, while those for botulism (dry mouth) and smallpox (enanthema) were relatively low (0.55% and 0.23%). This finding makes intuitive sense, because both anthrax and tularemia have symptoms that occur quite commonly in other diseases, such as the common cold. Inspection of the graphs displaying weekly frequencies did not reveal any obvious patterns, as shown in the detected reports with oral manifestations (Fig. 1) . (End-of-year valleys are artifacts resulting from the de-identification process.)",

The receiver operating characteristic curves show the algorithm sensitivity as a function of false alarms per year, while the activity monitor operating characteristic curves do so for the week of detection from the beginning of the outbreak. The algorithm performed best for smallpox and botulism in detecting actual outbreaks, especially with a large number of cases. For instance, the algorithm can detect a smallpox epidemic of 50 initial cases with a sensitivity of 80%, with slightly over two false alarms per year. For botulism (1000 cases), the false alarm rate at the same level of sensitivity is about 4/yr. The sensitivity characteristics for anthrax and tularemia, in contrast, resemble the line of no discrimination, indicating poor performance of our algorithm. The activity monitor operating characteristic curves present a similar impression with regard to timeliness of detection. For instance, a botulism outbreak (500 cases) is detected within one week at a false alarm rate of 4/yr. Smallpox outbreaks take longer to detect (between 6 and 7 wks) at the same false alarm rate. For anthrax and tularemia, detection timeliness ranges between 2 and 3, and 1 and 2 wks, respectively, given 4 false alarms/yr. However, the poor sensitivity of the algorithm for the two diseases reduces its application.",

In this model, the performance differential among different diseases may have occurred for several reasons. One major factor is that oral manifestations for smallpox and botulism occurred much less frequently (0.23% and 0.55%, respectively) in emergency department reports at baseline than those for anthrax and tularemia (7.46% and 6.91%). Any increase in corresponding oral manifestations thus had a proportionally larger effect for smallpox and botulism than for anthrax and tularemia. Second, the incubation periods for anthrax and tularemia are much longer than for the other two diseases. The uniform distribution of simulated cases over the incubation period thus \"diluted\" the signal compared with the diseases with a shorter incubation period. In the case of smallpox, the highly contagious nature of this disease had the effect of amplifying the initial signal rapidly, and thus may be primarily responsible for the superior performance of the algorithm.",

As such, our model is contingent on assumptions for which, at present, little support exists. First, our assumptions about oral manifestations of bioterrorist diseases are based on a literature review, not on systematic studies conducted by oral health researchers. Future studies should focus on determining oral manifestations in detail, and how health professionals report them. Second, we do not know how likely it is that patients would seek care for oral manifestations during an outbreak. With the exception of those for smallpox, none is prodromal, making systemic manifestations equally useful for monitoring. Third, the 'moving average' analysis we used is only one approach for detection. More sophisticated univariate detection methodologies exist, and other factors, such as dayof-week effects and seasonality, should be utilized in refining the algorithm. Last, the lack of data from real outbreaks limited our ability to evaluate the proposed detection system. A reasonable approach in leveraging our method would be to combine the developed signal with others to improve detection performance.",
