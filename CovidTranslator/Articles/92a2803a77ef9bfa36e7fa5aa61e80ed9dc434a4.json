            "text": "The recorded number of natural viral infections of marsupials as a group is very low. Whether this is because marsupials are less susceptible to viral infections or because they have been insufficiently studied is unclear. Representatives of three virus families have been isolated from or physically detected in marsupials. These are an adenovirus which was isolated from kidney cultures derived from the South American opossum (Didelphis marsupialis marsupialis) [15] , herpesviruses isolated from rat kangaroos (Bettongia penicillata and Aepypymnus rufescens) [5] , and wallabies (Macropus parma, Dorcopsis mueIleri Iuctuosa and Setonix brachyurus) [-7, 241 , and a retrovirus detected by the polymerase chain reaction and thin section electron microscopy in peripheral blood leucocytes from the koala (Phascolarctos cinereus) [4, 25] . Histological and serological evidence also implicate infection by herpesviruses in marsupial mice (Phascogale tapoatafa and Antechinus stuartii) [3] , and the common wombat (Vombatus ursinus) [203, by poxviruses in kangaroo (Megalia rufescens, Macropus fuliginosous and Macropus giganteus) [2, 13] , and wallaby (Setonix brachyurus) [16] , and by an adenovirus [19] , and a group A arbovirus [14] , in the Australian brush-tailed possum ( rrichosurus vulpecula). As discussed elsewhere [191, the Australian brush-tailed possum, which was introduced into New Zealand last century, now has a population of 65 million distributed over 95% of the land area. The pressure exerted by possum numbers on native forests due to overbrowsing and the role of possums in the spread and maintenance of bovine tuberculosis make the search for effective control methods a high research priority in New Zealand.",

Two co-existing virus types were recorded in 3/100 (3%) of the tested samples: one of these contained adenovirus and coronavirus particles; one contained adenovirus and coronavirus-like particles; one contained coronavirus and coronavirus-like particles. Figure 2 shows the distribution of viral types from the three different geographical collection sites. Adenovirus and coronavirus-like particles were detected in all three sites, coronavirus at two sites, and herpesvirus at only one site. Although the number of positive animals for each viral type in individual areas is low, the results indicate that possums in each area are host to a range of viral species. Adenovirus particles are commonly found in gut contents and faeces especially of young animals and infants and can be associated with diarrhoea [5, 11] . Of the six samples positive for adenovirus, one was fluid in consistency and contained a large number (> 25 particles per photographic field at 40 250 x magnification) of adenovirus particles (Fig. 1) . The non-enveloped nucleocapsids measured 72-79 nm in diameter, exhibited icosahedral symmetry and typical adenovirus morphology. The remaining five adenovirus positive samples were non-diarrhoeal in consistency and contained only the occasional adenovirus particle (one or two per grid square on 200 mesh grids).",

Individual capsomeres were seen as hollow hexamers. The intact envelope of the herpesvirus in the second sample suggests that the virus source was distal to the stomach as it seems unlikely that the envelope would survive intact as the virus passed through the strongly acidic environment of the stomach. Peyer's patches or the gut epithelial cells are possible candidate sites for replication of herpesvirus.

The particles were round to ovoid in shape, 75-245 nm diameter (mean 147 nm) with very long surface projections (31~-67 nm) consisting of a thin stalk with one or two knobs discernable along their length (Fig. lf-h) . Some projections appear to have one or two laterally squashed knobs along the stalk giving the appearance of T-shaped structures (Fig. lh) . In some cases the stalk is seen to project beyond the attached knob (Fig. lg, h) . A similar range of coronavirus-like morphologies have been reported in other mammals including cats [9] , mice [11] , dogs [21], and man [10, 221. This study has provided electron microscopic evidence of four recognisable virus types present in the possum population in New Zealand. It further supports the interpretation of our earlier serological study that possums are host to at least one species of adenovirus [-19] . Not unexpectedly, it appears that they are also host to herpesvirus, coronavirus and coronavirus-like particles. While the finding of viral particles in the intestinal tract is not absolute evidence that they are the result of active replication in the possum, the possibility that they have merely been ingested and are in transit seems unlikely. Our findings suggest that the small n u m b e r of reports of viruses in marsupials is due in part to the paucity of comprehensive studies of diseases that affect this group of mammals. F u r t h e r work is u n d e r w a y to propagate the different viral types obtained from the Australian brush-tailed possum to allow their further characterisation.",
