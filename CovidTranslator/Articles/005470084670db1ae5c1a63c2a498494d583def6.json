            "text": "Liposomes have been investigated extensively as a vaccine delivery system. Herein the adjuvant activities of liposomes with different net surface charges (neutral, positive, or negative) were evaluated when admixed with protein antigens, ovalbumin (OVA, pI = 4.7), Bacillus anthracis protective antigen protein (PA, pI = 5.6), or cationized OVA (cOVA). Mice immunized subcutaneously with OVA admixed with different liposomes generated different antibody responses. Interestingly, OVA admixed with net negatively charged liposomes prepared with DOPA was as immunogenic as OVA admixed with positively charged liposomes prepared with DOTAP. Immunization of mice with the anthrax PA protein admixed with the net negatively charged DOPA liposomes also induced a strong and functional anti-PA antibody response. When the cationized OVA was used as a model antigen, liposomes with net neutral, negative, or positive charges showed comparable adjuvant activities. Immunization of mice with the OVA admixed with DOPA liposomes also induced OVA-specific CD8 + cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses and significantly delayed the growth of OVA-expressing B16-OVA tumors in mice. However, not all net negatively charged liposomes showed a strong adjuvant activity. The adjuvant activity of the negatively charged liposomes may be related to the liposome's ability (i) to up-regulate the expression of molecules related to the activation and maturation of antigen-presenting cells and (ii) to slightly facilitate the uptake of the antigens by antigen-presenting cells. Simply admixing certain negatively charged liposomes with certain protein antigens of interest may represent a novel platform for vaccine development.",

            "text": "New approaches to vaccine development using recombinant protein antigens have significant advantages over traditional vaccines consisted of live attenuated pathogens, whole inactivated organisms, or inactivated toxins. However, recombinant protein antigens alone are often poorly immunogenic or non-immunogenic and, thus, need a potent vaccine adjuvant to enhance the resultant immune responses. 1 In recent years, particulate carriers have been extensively researched as vaccine delivery systems. It is generally accepted that many particle carriers have adjuvant activity, which is likely due to the particle's ability to facilitate the uptake of antigens by APC. Moreover, enhancement of antigen stability, presentation of multiple copies of antigens, and the ability to include immunomodulators are also the advantages of using particulates as a vaccine delivery system. 2 Liposomes are a well known lipid-based particulate vaccine delivery system. The adjuvant activity of liposomes was first reported by Allison and Gregoriadis in 1974 using diphtheria toxoid as an antigen. 3 Since then the adjuvant activity of liposomes has been extensively studied. [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] Many parameters that may affect the adjuvant activity of liposomes have been investigated. It was found that a variety factors such as particle size, surface charge, lipid composition, method of antigen loading, to name a few, in a liposome-based vaccine formulation can potentially shape the resultant immune responses against the antigen of interest. There were numerous studies defining the adjuvant activity of negatively and positively charged liposomes and examining the effect of the charge of liposomes on their adjuvant activities, but the results were rather conflicting and inconclusive. 3, [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] For example, Allison and Gregoriadis (1974) reported that diphtheria toxoid in negatively charged liposomes elicited significantly higher antibody levels than in positively charged liposomes. 3 However, Nakanishi et al. reported that positively charged liposomes containing a protein antigen were more potent inducers of antigen-specific CTL responses than negatively charged and neutral liposomes. 25 Similarly, Afrin et al. showed that Leishmania donovani antigens encapsulated in positively charged liposomes induced the strongest level of protection against experimental visceral leishmaniasis in mice, followed by neutral and negatively charged liposomes, respectively. 26 On the contrary, in another study using the recombinant glycoprotein of Leishmania antigen, 27 it was shown that antigens entrapped in neutral liposomes conferred a significantly higher protection and Th1 type immune responses than antigens entrapped in positively charged liposomes, whereas the negatively charged liposomes favored the induction of a Th2 type immune response.",

            "text": "In the present study, the adjuvant activities of liposomes with different net surface charges (i.e., neutral, positively charged, or negatively charged) were further investigated. Very often, protein antigens were either entrapped inside liposomes or covalently conjugated onto the surface of liposomes when liposomes were used as a vaccine delivery system. 3, [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] Entrapment of protein antigens into liposomes has many advantages. For example, it improves the stability of the proteins by protecting it from degradation after injection. 28 Using BSA as a model antigen, showed that tryposinization of liposomes with entrapped BSA did not reduce the anti-BSA immune response induced by the liposomes, but trypsinizatoin of liposomes with surface adsorbed BSA significantly reduced the anti-BSA response induced. 28 Moreover, it is thought that liposomes with antigens entrapped inside can act as a depot and allow the slow and persistent release of the antigen. Similarly, conjugation of antigens onto liposomes has its advantages as well. For example, it was shown that conjugation of lysozyme as an antigen onto neutral liposomes induced significantly stronger antibody responses than entrapment of it in the liposomes. 36 However, a significantly more convenient approach is to simply mix the antigen of interest with pre-formed liposomes, similar to the mixing of protein antigens with aluminum hydroxide or aluminum phosphate in suspensions, which are used in many human vaccines. Using model antigens OVA and the PA protein of Bacillus anthracis with a pI value of 4.7 and 5.6, respectively, the adjuvant activities of net neutral, net positively charged, and net negatively charged liposomes were evaluated by simply mixing the antigens with the liposomes before injecting them into mice. It was found that net negatively charged liposomes prepared with certain negatively charged lipids have a potent adjuvant activity when admixed with protein antigens. ",

To prepare net positively or negatively charged liposomes, DOPC was replaced by DOTAP or DOPA, respectively. For the preparation of different negatively charged liposomes, DOPS, DOPG, or DCP was used as follow: DOPS:Chol (1:1, m/m), DOPG:DOPC:Chol (1:2:1, m/m/m), and DCP:DOPC:Chol (1:2:1, m/m/m), all with 20 mg of total lipids.

The mean size for the neutral, positively charged, and negatively charged liposomes was 140 \u00b1 4, 159 \u00b1 3, and 163 \u00b1 3 nm, respectively. OVA-liposome mixtures were prepared by simply mixing an equal volume of liposomes and different concentrations of OVA in solution (e.g., 2.5, 5, 10, 25, or 50 \u00b5g in 25 \u00b5L). As shown in Fig. 1A , significant aggregations were formed when the positively charged liposomes (DOTAP) were mixed with high concentrations of OVA, as indicated by the increased turbidity of the mixtures (Fig. 1A) . At a concentration less than 5 \u00b5g OVA/50 \u00b5L, the turbidity of the mixture was only slightly different from that of the liposomes alone. Therefore, OVA-liposome mixtures containing 100 \u00b5g/mL of OVA were used in the immunization studies. The particle sizes of liposomes and OVA-liposome mixtures (final OVA concentration, 100 \u00b5g/mL) were not different for the neutral (DOPC) and net negatively (DOPA) charged liposomes, whereas the size of OVA-DOTAP liposome mixture was significantly larger than that of the DOTAP liposomes alone (Fig. 1B) .

In cell culture, the negatively charged DOPA liposomes only slightly enhanced the uptake of the OVA protein as a model antigen by mouse DC2.4 cells, significantly less effective than the positively charged liposomes prepared using DOTAP lipid (Fig. 7) , but the negatively charged DOPA liposomes and the positively charged DOTAP liposomes both showed a strong adjuvant activity (Figs. 2, 3) . Therefore, mechanisms other than the ability to enhance antigen uptake have likely contributed to the adjuvant activity of the negatively charged DOPA liposomes when simply admixed with antigens. The DOPA liposomes also significantly up-regulated the expression of genes related to DC activation and maturation (Figs. 9-10 ). For example, the DOPA liposomes upregulated the expression of MHC II, B2m (a component of MHC I molecule), Cd1d2, and Cd74, which are related to antigen presentation by APC. 43, 44 The DOPA liposomes and the DOPS liposomes also significantly up-regulated the expression of chemokines such as CCL-17 and CCL- 19 (Figs. 9, 10) . It is known that immature DC can produce inflammatory chemokines including CCL-5. As they mature, DC lose the ability to produce inflammatory chemokines and switch to produce chemokines such as CCL-17 and CCL-19, which attract T and B lymphocytes. 45, 46 It is speculated that the ability for certain negatively charged liposomes to induce DC activation and maturation may explain their adjuvant activity. Finally, the preliminary observation that the positively charged DOTAP liposomes and the net neutral DOPC liposomes failed to significantly up-regulate the secretion of the CCL-17 and IL-6 by DC2.4 cells suggested that the mechanisms of adjuvant activity of differently charged liposomes are likely different. Fig. 5 showed that not all negatively charged liposomes had a strong adjuvant activity. For example, negatively charged liposomes prepared with DOPA, DOPS, and DCP were shown to have comparable and strong adjuvant activities when admixed with OVA, but the net negatively charged liposomes prepared with the DOPG lipid showed only a weak adjuvant activity (Fig. 5B) . It was unlikely that the size of the OVA-liposome mixtures was related to the different adjuvant activities of the four different negatively charged liposomes because the sizes of the DOPA, DOPS, and DOPG liposomes admixed with OVA were around 130-160 nm, whereas the size of the DCP liposome-OVA admixture was around 250 nm. More experiments need to be completed to understand why certain negatively charged liposomes have a strong adjuvant activity while others do not.",

Similarly, the PA-DOPA liposome mixture also induced a stronger PA-specific antibody response than PA admixed with Alum (Fig. 3A) . The purpose of using the PA as an antigen was two-fold. Firstly, it allowed us to confirm that the adjuvant activity of the negatively charged liposomes prepared with DOPA was not limited to the OVA as an antigen. Secondly, the use of PA allowed us to evaluate the neutralizing activity of the specific antibodies induced. Anthrax is a toxin-mediated disease. B. anthracis produces two toxins, lethal toxin and edema toxin. Lethal toxin is comprised of PA protein and anthrax lethal factor; edema toxin is made of PA and edema factor. PA protein is required for the entrance of lethal factor and edema factor into cells, and only when inside cells, the lethal factor and edema factor are toxic. [47] [48] Therefore, neutralizing anti-PA antibodies were showed to be able to effectively protect against anthrax infection or against the anthrax toxins. As shown in Fig. 3B , the anti-PA antibodies induced by the PA-DOPA liposome mixture were functional. Finally, it seemed that the negatively charged liposomes prepared with the DOPA can help improve not only antibody responses, but also cellular responses against a protein antigen. The OVA-DOPA liposome mixture induced OVA-specific CTL responses, and immunization of mice with OVA admixed with the DOPA liposomes prevented the growth of the OVA-expressing B16-OVA tumor cells in mice (Fig. 6) .",

PA contains 735 amino acids; its molecular weight is 83 kDa, and its pI is 5.6. Therefore, at pH 7.4, both OVA and PA should be predominately net negatively charged. In order to understand the adjuvant activity of the negatively charged DOPA liposomes when an antigen with a pI value of larger than 7.4 is used, OVA was cationized by adding hexamethylene diamine to it to generate the cOVA protein. Data in Fig. 4C showed that the cOVA-DOPA liposome mixture also induced a strong anti-cOVA IgG response. In agreement with the previous finding that a catioinized protein is more immunogenic than the original protein, 49, 50 the cOVA itself was strongly immunogenic, which may explain why the cOVA-DOPA liposome mixture, the cOVA-DOTAP liposome mixture, and the cOVA-DOPC liposome mixture were all strongly immunogenic (Fig. 4D) . At physiological pH (7.4), OVA and PA are expected to be mainly negatively charged, whereas the cOVA is expected to be mainly positively charged. That explains the finding that more than 90% of the OVA was found binding to the positively charged DOTAP liposomes in PBS (pH 7.4). Although to a less extent, binding of OVA with the negatively charged DOPA liposomes and the net neutral DOPC liposomes was also detected, possibly due to interactions other than electrostatic interaction. It also explains the increase in turbidity when a large amount of cOVA was admixed with the negatively charged DOPA liposomes, but not the DOTAP liposomes (Fig. 4A ). As mentioned above, the adjuvant activity of the negatively charged liposomes may be related to the liposome's ability (i) to up-regulate the expression of molecules related to the activation and maturation of APC and (ii) to facilitate the uptake of the antigens by APC. However, when antigens with a pI value larger or smaller than 7.4 were used (i.e., cOVA vs. OVA), the extent to which the antigens strongly bound to the negatively charged liposomes was expected to be different. Therefore, the extent to which the adjuvant activity of the negatively charged liposomes can be attributed to their ability to facilitate antigen uptake by APC may vary depending on antigens used. The same reasoning may be applied to the net positively charged liposomes. Finally, when the net neutral DOPC liposomes were used, only antigens such as the PA and cOVA were able to induce specific antibody responses (Figs. 3-4) . Therefore, the mechanisms of adjuvanticity of the liposomes with different net charges are likely different.",

[32] [33] [34] 51 With the exception of the complexing of plasmid DNA with positively charged liposomes, very rarely were immunizations carried out using antigens simply admixed with pre-formed liposomes. The simple admixture of antigens with pre-formed liposomes is convenient and commercially favorable because it will avoid the procedures of entrapping antigens into the liposomes or chemically conjugating antigens onto the surface of the liposomes. Based on the finding in the present study that the negatively charged DOPA liposomes were more potent than Alum in increasing the immunogenicity of OVA or PA (as an antigen), and that the OVA admixed with the negatively charged DOPA liposomes also induced specific CTL responses, it is concluded that negatively charged liposomes may have the potential to become a suitable alternative to Alum to be admixed with certain antigens in vaccine development. Other advantages of using the negatively charged liposomes, instead of Alum, may include i) the possibility of combining various antigen types such as recombinant proteins and live attenuated viruses in a single delivery system and ii) the faster clearance of the negatively charged liposomes than Alum from the injection site. However, it is premature to generalize that all protein antigens can be simply admixed with negatively charged liposomes to induce a strong immune response. Only three antigens (OVA, PA, and cOVA) were evaluated in the present study, and the negatively charged liposomes prepared with DOPG did not show a potent adjuvant activity when admixed with OVA (Fig. 5) . Moreover, data from an early report showed that simply mixing BSA as a model antigen with negatively charged liposomes prepared with egg lecithin, Chol, and phosphatidic acid failed to induce any anti-BSA immune responses. 52 Nonetheless, it is interesting that all three antigens tested in the present study were able to induce strong specific antibody responses when simply admixed with the net negatively charged DOPA liposomes.",

Certain net negatively charged liposomes showed a potent adjuvant activity when simply admixed with the antigen of interest, and the negatively charged liposomes promoted both antibody and cellular immune responses. The strong adjuvant activity of the negatively charged liposomes may be attributed to their ability to induce the activation and maturation of APC. Simply admixing certain negatively charged liposomes with certain antigens of interest may represent a novel and convenient strategy for vaccine development. ",
