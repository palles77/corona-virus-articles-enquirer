            "text": "A one-tube reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for absolute feline coronavirus (FCoV) quantitation was developed. The assay is based on the 5% nuclease activity of the Thermus fla6us (Tfl) polymerase and a fluorogenic probe which generates fluorescence when it is cleaved. The fluorogenic probe, also called TaqMan\u2122 probe (Perkin Elmer, Foster City, USA), is an oligonucleotide designed to bind between the two PCR primers to the target cDNA and is labeled with a reporter and a quencher dye. In the intact probe, the quencher dye suppresses the fluorescence of the reporter dye by F\u00f6 rster-type energy transfer. During the polymerase extension steps the Tfl exonuclease activity cleaves the hybridised probe resulting in the generation of fluorescent emission of the reporter dye. The threshold cycle (C T value) indicates the increase of reporter fluorescence and is directly related to the initial amount of target cDNA or RNA, respectively. Fluorescence is monitored in real time after each cycle by a Perkin-Elmer ABI Prism \u00ae 7700 Sequence Detector. After completion of amplification, the C T values of the samples are calculated back to a standard curve, generated by amplification of diluted standard molecules. The one-tube RT-PCR described below allows precise quantitation, is highly sensitive, rapid (no separate reverse transcription step and no post-amplification steps), easy to handle, allows for a high sample throughput, shows a very good reproducibility, and can be executed with a low risk of contamination. The design of the primers-probe combination enables the detection of all known FCoV strains and is also useful for the detection of canine coronavirus, transmissible gastroenteritis virus and porcine respiratory coronavirus.",

            "text": "Feline coronavirus (FCoV) is known to be highly prevalent in the cat population, especially in catteries (Addie and Jarrett, 1992; Pedersen, 1995; Fehr et al., 1997) . FCoV causes mild gastrointestinal and respiratory diseases mainly in kittens (Pedersen et al., 1981) and, it is hypothesised, due to mutations during intestinal replication (Pedersen, 1995; Vennema et al., 1995) , feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) . FIP is actually the most important fatal infectious disease in cats, : 5 -12% of seropositve cats develop lethal FIP (Addie and Jarrett, 1992; Fehr et al., 1997) . The pathogenicity of FCoV leading to the FIP syndrome may be linked to increased replication due to a high FCoV load in a cat which can not be determined without a quantitative detection of the causative agent. The fact that FIP is still incurable emphasises that fighting FIP has to depend on preventive measures. Efficacious prevention can be accomplished by detection and separation of FCoV shedding from non shedding cats, resulting in the reduction of coronaviral load or even the elimination of FCoV from a cattery (Foley et al., 1997) . Vaccination has been shown to be efficacious if the cats are FCoV naive at the time of vaccination (Fehr et al., 1997) . Both strategies require a method to detect FCoV quantitatively, because only cats shedding FCoV at high level may transmit the virus to other cats (Foley et al., 1997) .",

In addition, conventional PCR methods are time consuming due to several post-amplification steps, contain a certain risk of cross-contamination between the samples due to a separate labor-intensive reverse transcription (RT) step and a second PCR step in nested PCR systems, are limited in sensitivity and allow only relatively few samples to be processed at one time.

A fluorescent reporter dye FAM (6-carboxyfluorescein) is covalently attached to the 5% end of the probe and a quencher dye TAMRA (6-carboxytetramethylrhodamine) is covalently attached to the 3% end of the probe. The quencher dye absorbs the emission of the reporter dye by F\u00f6 rster-type energy transfer while the probe is intact (F\u00f6 rster, 1948) . The 3% end of the probe is phosphorylated to prevent extension by the Tfl during the polymerisation steps. While the reporter dye emission is quenched due to the physical proximity of the quencher dye in the intact probe, the 5% 3% exonuclease activity of Tfl polymerase leads to cleavage of the probe in the extension phase of the PCR cycle. The effect is a dislocation of the reporter dye and, as a result of the decrease of the energy transfer, a rise of the reporter's fluorescence. The resulting relative increase of the reporter dye's fluorescencent emission is measured in the course of every PCR cycle using a Perkin Elmer ABI Prism 7700 Sequence Detector, which is a combination of thermal cycler and luminescence spectrometer.

The plasmids were purified (Birnboim and Doly, 1979) , linearised, purified by gel electrophoresis and extracted from the gel using a DEAE membrane (Dretzer et al., 1981) . The standard plasmids were quantified by spectrophotometrical analysis. Verification and orientation of the sequence was verified by sequencing. The amount of 1.5 mg of the linearised plasmid was used to perform an in vitro transcription with T7 polymerase (Boehringer Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany) at 37\u00b0C for 2 h. After digestion with RNase free DNase, the resulting RNA transcripts were purified with phenol-chloroform and precipitated with isopropanol. The RNA transcripts were disolved in diethylpyrocarbonate (DEPC) treated water and quantified by spectrophotometrical analysis. The dilutions of the standard plasmid were carried out in TE buffer (pH 7.6) containing 30 mg carrier RNA (transfer RNA from E. coli, Sigma, Buchs, Switzerland) /ml. Endpoint dilution amplification was used to confirm the calculated copy number. The diluted RNA stock was aliquoted and frozen immediately at \u2212 70\u00b0C. Each aliquot was used only once for a fluorogenic RT-PCR.",

The 96-well plates used in the 7700 ABI Prism system might generate a problem of cross-contamination because pipetting has to be done with the PCR tubes open. All the wells used are only closed with rows of linked caps after pipetting.

The basis of this assay is a fluorogenic oligonucleotide, called TaqMan\u2122 probe, which is added to the RT-PCR mix. This fluorogenic probe is cleaved during the PCR polymerisation steps due to a 5% nuclease activity of the Tfl polymerase. While the unhybridised probe does not contribute significantly to the signal, the cleavage of the probe leads to the generation of fluorescence. This fluorescence is measured during each cycle by a luminescence spectrometer (ABI Prism 7700) and transferred to a connected computer, where graphics and calculations, for example standard curves or initial amounts of template in the samples, are automatically performed. The use of such a fluorogenic probe increases the level of specificity of the assay. This assay is a one-tube RT-PCR, where all ingredients for RT and PCR are mixed and RT-PCR is performed without additional handling or reopening of the tubes. No post amplification steps are required and calculation of the initial amount of viral particles is done by the software, resulting in a very short processing and assay time. RT-PCR testing of : 90 samples, including pipetting, can be performed on a 96-well plate including some non template controls and standard dilutions in B 6 h.
