PLP2 acts as 17 a protease that cleaves the viral replicase polyprotein, and a deubiquitinating (DUB) enzyme which 18 removes ubiquitin moieties from ubiquitin-conjugated proteins. Previous in vitro studies 19 implicated PLP2 DUB activity as a negative regulator of the host interferon (IFN) response, but 20 the role of DUB activity during virus infection was unknown. Here, we used X-ray structure-21 guided mutagenesis and functional studies to identify amino acid substitutions within the 22 ubiquitin-binding surface of PLP2 that reduced DUB activity without affecting polyprotein 23 processing activity. We engineered a DUB mutation (Asp1772 to Ala) into a murine coronavirus 24 and evaluated the replication and pathogenesis of the DUB mutant virus (DUBmut) in cultured 25 macrophages and in mice. We found that the DUBmut virus replicates similarly as the wild-type 26 virus in cultured cells, but the DUBmut virus activates an IFN response at earlier times compared 27 to the wild-type virus infection in macrophages, consistent with DUB activity negatively 28 regulating the IFN response. We compared the pathogenesis of the DUBmut virus to the wild-type 29 virus and found that the DUBmut-infected mice had a statistically significant reduction (p<0.05) 30 in viral titer in livers and spleens at day 5 post-infection, albeit both wild-type and DUBmut virus 31 infections resulted in similar liver pathology. Overall, this study demonstrates that structure-guided 32 mutagenesis aids the identification of critical determinants of PLP2-ubiquitin complex, and that 33 PLP2 DUB activity plays a role as an interferon antagonist in coronavirus pathogenesis.",

To 40 separate the DUB activity from the protease activity, we employed a structure-guided mutagenesis 41 approach and identified residues that are important for ubiquitin-binding. We found that mutating 42 the ubiquitin-binding residues results in a PLP2 that has reduced DUB activity but retains protease 43 activity.

Although these accessory genes 55 are not necessarily required for virus replication and are, in general, not highly conserved within 56 the virus family, many encode proteins that regulate the host response (3). Interestingly, 57 coronavirus replicase proteins, which are highly conserved, can also act as antagonists to block or 58 delay the host innate immune response to infection (1, 4-8). That a slew of coronavirus-encoded 59 accessory and non-accessory proteins have been shown to shape the host antiviral response 60 suggests that viral-mediated subversion of host defenses is an important element of infection.

X-ray structural studies of SARS-and MERS-CoV papain-like protease/DUBs co-85 crystalized with ubiquitin modified at the c-terminus with a covalent warhead (aldehyde, 3-bromo- 86 propylamine, or propargylamine) allowed for identification of residues that are important for direct 87 interaction with ubiquitin (17, 18, 20). Here, we took a slightly different approach and mutated the 88 catalytic cysteine (C1716) of MHV PLP2 to a serine residue and co-crystallized it with free 89 ubiquitin. The X-ray structure of MHV PLP2 (C1716S) in complex with ubiquitin was determined 90 to a resolution of 1.85 \u00c5 and an overall Rfree = 19.6% and Rwork = 15.8% (PDB: 5WFI). The overall 91 structure of the MHV PLP2-ubiquitin complex is similar to other PLP2/PLpro ubiquitin-bound 92 structures (Fig. 1A). Ubiquitin binds within the palm region and is gripped by the zinc-fingers 93 motif while the C-terminus extends into the active site. 94 Next, we aligned the primary amino acid sequence of the MHV PLP2 domain with the 95 SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV papain-like protease domains (Fig. 1E) . The sequence alignment and 96 X-ray structure of the MHV PLP2-ubiquitin complex were then analyzed in conjunction with the 97 previous structural and mutagenesis studies on SARS-and MERS-CoV to identify candidate 98 residues that could be mutated to render a loss of DUB activity in vitro. From this analysis, we 99 identified three residues (R1803, D1772, F1812) in MHV PLP2 that form direct interactions with 100 ubiquitin (Fig. 1B-D) . Two of the side chain guanidinium nitrogens of R1803 form direct hydrogen 101 bonds with the backbone carbonyl oxygen of A46 in ubiquitin (Fig. 1B) . The two side chain 102 carboxylate oxygens of D1772 in MHV PLP2 interact with ubiquitin by forming direct bonds with 103 each of the guanidinium nitrogens of R42 and with one of the guanidinium nitrogens of R72 (Fig.   104 1C). Finally, F1812 forms Van der Waals contacts with the side chains of I44 and V70 and the 105 delta-carbon of R42 of ubiquitin (Fig. 1D) .",

The net result is a significant reduction in the 129 catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) compared to the wild-type enzyme, which was the goal of these trials. 130 The kinetic response of MHV PLP2 toward another substrate, ISG15-AMC, was also 131 determined. ISG15 is an important ubiquitin-like modifier that is upregulated and used to ISGylate 132 host proteins during viral infection. A number of viruses, including coronaviruses, engender 133 ISGylation during infection but the function(s) and importance of this activity are not clear 30). For MHV, neither the wild-type nor the D1772A mutant PLP2 enzyme can be saturated with 135 ISG15-AMC, suggesting weak binding with this ubiquitin-like modifier (Fig. 2B) . Moreover, the 136 R1772A mutation does not disrupt the interaction with ISG15 but in fact enhances it to some 137 degree. A potential explanation for the observed selective disruption of ubiquitin binding stems 138 from our analysis of a primary sequence alignment of ubiquitin and ISG15 and the residues that 139 interact with D1772 (Fig. 2C ). The interaction between MHV PLP2 D1772 and the R42 residue in 140 human and mouse ubiquitin is absent in human and mouse ISG15 since this residue is a tryptophan 141 in human and mouse ISG15. Therefore, in line with our observations, D1772A mutation would 142 not be expected to alter ISG15 binding. In contrast to R42, residue R72 is conserved in both 143 ubiquitin and ISG15 and its interaction with MHV PLP2 for ubiquitin is likely weaker than that 144 with ISG15.",

The in vitro biochemical studies presented here support the notion that we 147 are able to use a structure-guided mutagenesis to uncouple the DUB enzymatic activity from MHV 148 PLP2 while preserving the peptide hydrolysis and deISGylating activities of PLP2. Next, we 149 focused on comparing the activity of the mutant enzyme to its wild-type counterpart for the ability 150 to remove Flag-tagged-ubiquitin conjugated to host proteins in cultured cells (Fig. 3A) . We found 8 that in cells, wild-type PLP2 exhibits robust DUB activity and removes ubiquitin modifications 152 from multiple cellular proteins. On the other hand, the PLP2-D1772A mutant exhibits reduced 153 DUB activity, similar to that of the previously documented catalytic cysteine to alanine mutant, 154 PLP2-CA (19). To determine if this impaired DUB activity altered the ability of PLP2 to act as an 155 interferon antagonist, we transfected cells with a RIG-I expression plasmid, an interferon-156 luciferase reporter construct, and either wild-type or mutant PLP2 plasmid and measured luciferase 157 activity at 18 hours post-transfection. In agreement with previous reports (13, 25, 31), we find that 158 wild-type PLP2 acts as an interferon antagonist, reducing reporter activity by 50-80%. In contrast, 159 PLP2-D1772A is unable to significantly reduce interferon activation in this assay despite similar 160 expression levels of the wild-type and mutant versions of the protein (Fig. 3B ). We also evaluated 161 the protease activity of the enzymes in cells using two independent trans-cleavage assays and 162 found that the wild-type and DUB-mutant enzymes produce similar levels of cleaved products. 163 These results indicate that the D1772A substitution did not alter protease activity (Fig. 3C and D), 164 in agreement with the in vitro kinetic results described above (Fig. 2) . Together, these studies 165 reveal that aspartic acid residue 1772 of MHV-PLP2 is important for DUB activity and interferon 166 antagonism, but not for protease activity.",

Upon evaluating virus replication of the DUBmut virus by 175 performing a growth kinetics experiment in parallel with wild-type virus, we found that the 176 DUBmut virus replicates with essentially identical kinetics as the wild-type in a murine 177 astrocytoma cell line (DBT cells) (Fig. 4A ). These results are consistent with previous studies of 178 coronavirus interferon antagonists, which showed in many cell lines that viral-mediated interferon 179 antagonism is not essential for virus replication (5, 6).

These results indicate that F1812 may 182 play a critical role within the polyprotein during virus replication. We were able to recover virus 183 containing the R1803A substitution, but found that it had no detectable phenotype, which we 184 documented in our previous study (5). Here, we focus our efforts on evaluating replication and IFN\uf061\uf020protein into the supernatant, as detected by ELISA (Fig. 4B ). We show that this activation 191 of IFN\uf061 is dependent on expression of pattern recognition receptor MDA5 (Fig. 4D ), in agreement 192 with previous reports (5, 6, 33).

Together, this previous 268 report in conjunction with the current study support the concept that different PLP2/DUB domains 269 may have distinct effects on antagonism of the innate immune response depending on the virus 270 and the host cell type. Another possibility is that the DUB-mutant virus we generated may not have 271 been sufficiently debilitated in its DUB activity to result in altered pathogenesis. We found that it 272 was difficult to recover viable DUB-mutant viruses; indeed, this D1772A mutant was the sole 273 viable DUB-mutant representative of our many attempts. Because an elevated interferon response 274 was elicited from the DUBmut-infected cells, this mutant virus fulfilled our criteria demonstrating 275 the inactivation of an interferon antagonist. However, we speculate that if we are able to recover 276 mutants that exhibit a range of DUB activity, we may be able to more fully assess the role of DUB 277 activity as a contributor to coronaviral pathogenesis. Despite these caveats, the MHV DUB-mutant 278 generated in this study did exhibit a reproducible phenotype of eliciting an elevated interferon 279 response in infected macrophages that was associated with mild attenuation of pathogenesis with 280 reduced titers in the livers and spleens of infected mice.
