Expecting individual countries to bear the responsibility and costs of addressing AMR is unreasonable, when the international community is also set up in such a way that the efforts of individual countries acting alone will likely fail. Such failure stems from the reality that individual countries also face disincentives and constraints in acting on their own. A single country might invest its resources and take significant steps to mitigate AMR, yet that country's efforts can be easily undermined by a few resistant microbes tagging along on an international flight from one country to another country.",

As such, it is our global governance structures that ought to be reformed to address AMR and its root social causes. The most sustainable and effective method to instigate such change is through an international legal agreement, whether it is called a convention, covenant, regulation, treaty, or any one of the other more than 30 names for it. 16 Current progress towards global collective action has already been made through existing international legal agreements. For example, the International Health Regulations require WHO member states to monitor and report disease outbreaks, and both the WHO and the World Organization for Animal Health have created international standards for antimicrobial surveillance programmes. 17 These global standards are helpful for encouraging a common approach to challenges, ensuring the comparability of information and minimizing the between-country differences, inequities, and market distortions that are barring significant global action at the moment.",

Resistance itself will always occur, as it is a natural biological process-one that Sir Alexander Fleming high- In terms of global market failures, using the lens of political economy, there are some clear game-theoretic problems that make current government actions rational but that lead to suboptimal global collective actions overall. For example, the free-rider problem is often present when we are attempting to achieve greater innovation. The theory is that the free-rider problem occurs when people or countries can benefit from a public good or service without making a significant investment themselves. This ultimately results in a lack of provision of those products. 20 When a public good is available to all, and is costly to produce, rational actors will attempt to free-ride on the work of others. The economic assumption is that international standards that apply to all countries to invest in antimicrobial innovation and regulate the use of antimicrobials-albeit appropriately differentiated according to national circumstance-is the only cost-effective and sustainable way of solving this free-rider problem. 21 In the absence of such an international collective approach, it is difficult to convince any government to invest in antimicrobial innovation when each can simply wait for another country, ",

However, given the urgent need to make progress in the short and medium term, the most pragmatic, effective, fair, and sustainable way forward is through a new international legal agreement. A growing number of scholars have been calling for such an agreement to address AMR. 25 An international legal agreement makes the most sense for at least four reasons.

The challenge we face is that issues like AMR garner significant attention but attention also tends to fall off just as quickly as another pressing issue takes its place.

            "text": "ments can limit the ways in which antimicrobials are distributed, such as by requiring physicians or other health care providers to prescribe them before a patient can access them. Pharmaceutical company advertisements and promotions of antimicrobials can be banned, and undergoing infection prevention and control programmes can be required for all health care facilities. With respect to farms-where the vast majority of antimicrobials are used today 12 -governments can establish standards for veterinarians in the way they use antimicrobials in their practice, prohibit veterinarians from profiting from the sale of antimicrobials, and increase animal-grade antimicrobial prices by setting a minimum sale price or imposing additional taxes. Alternatively, governments could use domestic law to change how animals are raised on farms-mandating less antimicrobial-dependent practices,-or even ban the sale of animals raised with antimicrobial growth promoters. A previous study examined how 10 different countries have used domestic law to collectively address this challenge and found that no country followed the same approach. Rather, different states took different approaches in their legislation, with mixed results. 13 This finding shows that countries have a range of domestic legal options from which they can choose and experiment to find the best approach for their unique national context. While domestic law can mitigate many practices that accelerate AMR, domestic law is also limited in its capacity. This is particularly true when considering international trade and treaty relations, where the actions of one country are constrained by their interconnectedness with neighbours and trading partners. The example of trade between Canada and the USA illustrates this challenge well. If Canada sought to establish the most robust possible regulations to optimize the use of antimicrobials in animals, that country would need the USA to adopt similar regulations because trade between those two countries is so integrated. If the Canadian government chose to adopt stricter regulations independently of the USA, they would put their Canadian farmers at an enormous competitive disadvantage in the marketplace compared with US farmers, to whom those stricter regulations would not apply. The markets between Canada and the USA are interconnected to such an extent that it would not only be pragmatically infeasible for the Canadian government to adopt on its own such regulations for antimicrobial use in animals, but also politically infeasible, as farmers would mobilize against the regulations and inflict severe political costs upon the government of the day. Another limitation to what can be achieved through domestic law lies in the global mobility of microbes. We live in an interconnected world where environmental changes and migration can enable microbes to cross over the political borders we have established. This limits the degree of control that domestic law can possibly have over the spread of infectious disease threats.

Sustainably and appropriately using antimicrobials requires a change to the underlying social use of antimicrobials through global collective action.In trying to distill and simplify its root social causes, it is important to consider that the AMR problem actually consists of at least three problems. First, there is insufficient access to antimicrobials for the millions of people who require them and are currently without them.Second, we need to conserve existing antimicrobials to retain their effectiveness. Third, innovation of new drugs and technologies is needed to reduce reliance on existing antimicrobials and to facilitate reductions in their overall use. 19 As Figure 1 shows, these challenges are interconnected and need to be addressed simultaneously and in a meaningful way. For example, if we were to promote access to antimicrobials without conservation and innovation, then the increased use of antimicrobials would speed up the development of resistance. Conservation constrains access, meaning that millions might be unfairly denied effective treatment of their illness. Conservation alone would also further undermine innovation, as efforts to reduce antimicrobial use would result in a smaller market for them and fewer incentives for pharmaceutical companies to develop new antimicrobials.Finally, innovation without access would be unfair, while innovation without conservation would be wasteful, as new resistance would inevitably follow the development of new drugs. International law offers an opportunity to strike a bargain across these three pillars, with different countries contributing and gaining more or less in accordance to their needs, capacity, and specialization (Figure 1).",

For example, increasing the efficiency of food production through antimicrobial growth promoters, thereby advancing the Food & Agriculture Organization's objectives, could adversely affect human health, thereby of concern to WHO. In addition, these institutions work through different policy forums that have different powers to influence state behaviour and are attended by different actors with different priorities (e.g., ministers of agriculture versus ministers of health). Cooperation and coordination under such circumstances is naturally challenging.23 The failure of existing actors to address either the governance gaps or market failures perpetuating global inaction on antimicrobial access and effectiveness is glaring. Four weaknesses for international law to address seem most evident. The first is an absence of effective coordination across the constellation of actors addressing this important challenge (a governance problem). The second is a gap between the many actions that have been promised by states and the few that have been delivered (a compliance problem). The third is insufficient political will, momentum, or ambition for stopping the inappropriate use of antimicrobials in both humans and animals (a leadership problem). The fourth is the grossly insufficient resources for implementing recommended antimicrobial policies, especially for the poorest countries that may individually be better off in allocating their limited resources towards basic primary health care, vaccines, and sanitation, even if the transnational externalities of inaction overall make antimicrobials a better global investment (a financing problem).24",
