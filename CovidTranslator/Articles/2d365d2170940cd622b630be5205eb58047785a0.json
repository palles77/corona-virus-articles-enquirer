Let us consider a sphere of radius \"r,\" surface area, and volume of sphere given in Eqs. (2.1) and (2.2) . The ratio of these two equations gives Eq. (2.3), which indicates the increase in surface to volume ratio with decrease in size of materials. Thus, when the radius of the sphere decreases, its surface area to volume ratio increases [3, 4] . Figure 2 .2 shows the relation between surface area and size of silica nanoparticles. It is seen that obtained surface area increased exponentially below 100 nm indicated crucial role of size in NsM. If a bulk material is subdivided into an ensemble of individual nanomaterials, the total volume remains the same, but the collective surface area is greatly increased.",

These effects also differ in the range of sizes in which they appear. Size effects are observed in semiconductor crystals measuring 10\u00c0100 nm, whereas quantum size effects are usually characteristic of nanocrystallites measuring less than 10 nm. In the literature semiconductor nanoparticles in which quantum size effects of one type or another appear, are often called quantum size particles or quantum points to emphasize their special electronic structure. It is necessary to mention the tentative nature of the classification in so far as the exact \"critical\" size after which the appearance of quantum size effects can be expected is largely determined by the chemical nature of the semiconductor and can vary from 0.5 (CuCl) to 46 (PbSe) or more nanometers. From the positions of quantum mechanics the \"critical\" size (the threshold for the appearance of quantum size effects) corresponds to the De Broglie wavelength of the free electron. During analysis of the interband absorption of the semiconductor nanoparticle the Bohr radius of the exciton (a B ), which can be calculated from the electrophysical constants of the bulk semiconductor, can be used as such a criterion [6] . The data that have accumulated on size effects in semiconductor nanoparticles make it possible to examine them according to the nature of the effect on the properties of the nanocrystals.",

It dips slightly around 400\u00c0500 nm, and when held up to the light, such a thin film appears blue due to the weak transmission of light in this wavelength range [8] . However, the dilute gold colloid film displays total transparency at low photon energies (below 1.8 eV). Its absorption becomes intense in a sharp band around 2.3 eV (520 nm). This kind of effect is known as surface plasmon, which is aroused from small size of metal particles [9] . Besides quantum size effects, the NsM behavior is different due to surface effects, which dominate as nanocrystal size decreases. Reducing the size of a crystal from 30 to 3 nm, the number of atoms on its surface increases from 5% to 50% beginning to perturb the periodicity of the \"infinite\" lattice. In that sense, atoms at the surface have fewer direct neighbors than atoms in the bulk and as a result they are less stabilized than bulk atoms. The origin of the quantum size effects strongly depends on the type of bonding in the crystal [10] .",

The relevant length scale is the de Broglie wavelength, \u03bb dB , of an electron in one particular direction: If the dimension of the system in one dimension is lower than \u03bb dB we call it a twodimensional (2D) system. Graphene sheet obtained from exfoliation of graphite is the best example of a 2D system as well as semiconductor superlattices. One-dimensional (1D) system is obtained when two dimensions are lower than \u03bb dB values; nanowires and nanotubes belong to this category [11] . Special is the case of the so-called quantum dots whose all three dimensions are lower than \u03bb dB and we name these as 0D systems. Their energy spectra are discrete and the system can be viewed as an artificial atom. This has a tremendous effect on optical properties of nanoparticles, as the absorption shifts from the infrared to the visible range. Quantum confinement in quantum wells (1D), quantum wires (2D), and quantum dots (3D) and the resulting changes of the energy spectrum as shown in Figure 2 .4 has also serious implications for the optoelectronic properties of nanostructured semiconductors, and is currently utilized in optoelectronic devices.",

If a magnetic field H is applied, the magnetization of all domains takes the direction of the field and remains in this direction even if the outside field is removed. If the size of ferromagnetic nanoparticles becomes smaller than the critical domain size (10\u00c020 nm), only one domain remains in the particle (Figure 2 .5b). If again a magnetic field is applied, all particles will align according to this field ( Figure 2 .5c), but if the field is removed, thermal motion will lead to a loss of orientation (Figure 2 .5d). This behavior is similar to that of permanent magnetic dipoles in a paramagnet and is thus called superparamagnetism [12] . This effect sets, among others, an upper limit to the miniaturization of magnetic memories. On the other hand, superparamagnetic particles are envisioned to play an important role in nanobiotechnology and medicine. Another magnetic nanoeffect, which is used presently in magnetic memories, is the so-called giant magnetoresistive effect [13] .

From the perspective of applications, these structures have wide-ranging utility in areas as diverse as catalysis, energy storage, fiber engineering, fuel cells, biomedicine, computation, power generation, photonics, pollution remediation, and gas sensing. There are few basic parameters, such as synthesis cost, use of nontoxic chemicals, maximum use of aqueous solvents, minimum number of reagents and few steps with high yield, room or low temperature and high efficiency, which needs to be considered during fabrication of advanced devices based on NsM. Nowadays synthesis of new NsM using chemical methods have focused greatly because of low temperature and cost with better functions for environmental and energy applications. The synthesis of NsM is an interesting research field. Until now, a large number of approaches have been explored to synthesize NsM, which could be divided into two major sections, that is, top-down and bottom-up. Interestingly, bottom-up route based on chemistry have attracted considerable attention because of relatively low cost and high yield [14] . In this process, material growth started from atom to atom, molecule by molecule. Recently, a number of techniques, including coprecipitation, sol\u00c0gel processes, microemulsions, freeze drying, hydrothermal processes, laser pyrolysis, ultrasound and microwave irradiation, templates, and chemical vapor deposition, have been developed to control the growth, size, morphology, and uniformity of NsM [15] .

Upon doping NsM, the concentration of the majority carriers increases, and with it their \u03c4 and L values. On the contrary, the lifetime and diffusion length of the minority carriers decrease [16] . For optimum collection of both carrier types at the back contact, the semiconductor film thickness d has to be in the same range as L e and L h (Figure 2.6 ). To improve minority carrier collection at the semiconductor\u00c0electrolyte interface, the surface roughness of the film can be increased. This surface nanostructuring approach is particularly useful for first row transition metal oxides (MnO 2 , Fe 2 O 3 ), which suffer from low hole mobility and lifetimes [17] . Ideal electron/hole collection is possible with suspended nanoparticles, if their particle size d , L e , L p . Although in this situation, both carrier types need to be extracted at the sc\u00c0electrolyte interface. Thus, there is a need for selective redox agents. This has been referred to by Helmut Tributsch as kinetic rectification [18] . refers to the distance after which the light intensity is reduced to 1/e of the original value. For example, for Fe 2 O 3 , \u03b1 21 5 118 nm at \u03bb 5 550 nm, for CdTe, \u03b1 21 5 106 nm (550 nm), and for Si, \u03b1 21 5 680 nm (510 nm) [19] . To ensure .90% absorption of the incident light, the film thickness must be .2.3 times the value of \u03b1 21 (Figure 2.7) . Surface-structuring on the micro-or nanoscale can increase the degree of horizontal light distribution by light scattering. This \"trapped\" light would otherwise be lost by direct reflection from a flat surface [20] . Light scattering is maximal in particle suspensions, because it can occur at both the front and back sides of the particles.",

            "text": "Both the technological and economic importance of photocatalysis have increased considerably over the past decade. Improvements in performance have been strongly correlated to advances in nanotechnology; for example, the introduction of nanoparticulate photocatalysts has tremendously enhanced the catalytic efficiency of specific materials. A variety of applications ranging from anti-fogging, antimicrobial, and self-cleaning surfaces, through to water and air purification and solar-induced hydrogen production, have been developed and many of these have made their way into commercial products. However, extensive research continues to further optimize this technology and to widen the spectrum of potential applications. Research and application foci include anti-stick or anti-fingerprint coatings, soil repellency, and decomposition of organic matter, such as microbes or fat. When exposed to light certain semiconducting materials such as \"photocatalysts\" trigger or accelerate chemical reactions resulting, for example, in a decomposition of organic molecules [24] . Due to their large surface area, nanosized catalyst particles show a significantly enhanced reactivity compared to larger particles or bulk material. Numerous materials are under examination; however, none appear to match the efficiency of TiO 2 . Its application requires illumination in the UV or at the extreme blue edge of the visible spectrum. Volume applications are thus mainly limited to the outdoor area [25] . However, despite the reduced natural illumination, even indoor products such as sanitary ceramics are being increasingly applied. Moreover, research is underway to widen the exploitable spectral range toward visible light. A few applications of photocatalysis are provided in Figure 2 .9. In recent years, applications have been directed toward environmental clean-up, drinking water treatment, industrial, and health applications. (i) Removing trace metals: Trace metals, such as mercury (Hg), chromium (Cr), lead (Pb), and other metals, are considered to be highly hazardous to health. Thus, removing these toxic metals is essentially important for human health and water quality. The environmental applications of heterogeneous photocatalysis include removing heavy metals such as mercury (Hg), chromium (Cr), cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb), arsenic (As), nickel (Ni), and copper (Cu). The photoreducing ability of photocatalysis has been used to recover expensive metals from industrial effluent, such as gold, platinum, and silver [26] .",

These are also defined as the fraction of filtered water that adsorb on XAD-8 resin (nonionic polymeric adsorbent) at pH 2. They are the main constituents of the dissolved organic carbon pool in surface waters (freshwaters and marine waters), and ground waters, commonly imparting a yellowishbrown color to the water system. The concentration of HS varies from place to place; the values in seawater being normally from 2 to 3 mg L 21 . Their size, molecular weight, elemental composition, structure, and number and position of functional groups vary, depending on the origin and age of the material. HS are known to affect the behavior of some pollutants significantly in natural environments, such as trace metal speciation and toxicity, solubilization and adsorption of hydrophobic pollutants, and aqueous photochemistry. HS act as substrates for bacterial growth, inhibit the bacterial degradation of impurities (some color) in natural water, and form complex with heavy metals such as Fe, Pb, and Mn making it harder to remove them, transport the metals in the environment, and also promote the corrosion of pipes. HSs act as a source of methyl groups and thus react with hypochlorite ion, which is used as a biocide in water treatment plants, to produce disinfectant byproducts, for example, trihalomethanes, haloacetic acids, other chlorinated compounds, and nitriles, some of which are suspected to be carcinogenic. More than 150 products have been identified when HS react with chlorine [31] . Recently, 3-chloro-4-(dichloromethyl)-5hydroxy-2(5H)-furanone [abbreviated as (MX)] was found in the chlorinated water containing HS. Advanced oxidation has been applied to decreasing the organic content in water including humic acid. It has the advantage of not leaving any toxic byproducts or sludge [32] . Heterogeneous photocatalysis was also coupled with other physical methods to increase the degradation rate of organic molecules including HA (sono-photocatalysis, ozonation photocatalysis).",
