Finally, all patients were released from quarantine without death, and the clinical outcome was significantly better than that in Hubei province.

After hospitalization, all patients were stratified according to the PSI, which may be a better strategy to improve the outcome of COVID-19 patients, especially in the outbreak where medical resources are relatively insufficient [14] . Although the proportion of patients with chronic underlying diseases in this group was 21.6%, it did not seriously affect the outcome, since most of the patients were around 44 years old. According to the epidemiological history, some of the patients in this study were in direct contact with the confirmed patients, and some were in the same workplace and did not meet the conceptual standard of close contact, which suggested the existence of the transmission route of COVID -19 aerosol. Among these patients, the proportion of asymptomatic patients accounted for 18.9% of the total patients. In some patients, chest CT scan still showed pneumonia and All rights reserved.

The effects of thymosin, glucocorticoid, albumin, and immunoglobulin on COVID-19 need to be further investigated, especially in mild and moderate patients. Many studies had demonstrated the important role of TCM in inhibiting coronavirus. [20, 21, 22] Although the patients in this study were mainly mild and moderate, there was still a significant difference in the duration from onset to release form quarantine. The most important basis for release from quarantine is the persistence of negative nucleic acid test results, so the duration from onset to release form quarantine reflects the time it takes the patient to release the virus from the respiratory tract. The average time from onset to release form quarantine was 20 days. Since the patient could only be released from quarantine after three consecutive negative nucleic acid test results, and each test interval was 24 hours, and the incubation period reported in previous literature was considered [1] , the average duration of virus release in this study should be similar to that of professor Cao Bin's study . [23] Some items in the \u2264 20-day group and the > 20-day group were significantly different, which may be the reason why the quarantine cannot be released for a long time. The age of the > 20-day group was older and the time from onset to admission was later, suggesting that All rights reserved.

There was no significant difference in the number of patients between the two groups, which was related to the fact that almost all of the patients were mild and moderate, while one critically ill patient was quickly released from quarantine. These clinical results may suggest that there is a cross relationship between the sustained positive nucleic acid of novel coronavirus in respiratory tract specimens and the severity of the disease [1, 23, 24] , but it is not a linear relationship, and the reasons for the sustained positive nucleic acid are complex.
