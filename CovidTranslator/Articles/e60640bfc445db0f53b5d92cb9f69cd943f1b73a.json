The proposed aplysia californica nido-like virus (AcNV), with a genome sequence of ca.35,906 nt, represents the longest ever recorded RNA virus yet. Phylogenetic insights indicate that AcNV clusters in a major phylloclade of unclassified invertebrate nidoviruses, Roniviridae, and Mesoniviridae.

            "text": "In tandem, a growing multifaceted RNA virosphere is emerging, uncovering the viral dark matter associated with every single living organism assessed (Greninger, 2018) . Despite the exponential growth of data generation during the last years and the parallel discovery of thousands of new emergent viruses, one crucial characteristic of RNA virus genomes, which has maintained constant in the metagenomics revolution (perhaps the only constant), is an upperlimit on genome length of <34 kb in RNA viruses (Shi et al., 2018) . Ball python nidovirus (Nidovirales; Coronaviridae) presents a 33.4 kb RNA virus genome (Stenglein et al., 2014) which still remains to be the largest reported to date and has been associated with respiratory disease in experimental infections of ball pythons (Bodewes et al., 2014; Hoon-Hanks et al, 2018) . Nidoviruses are positive-stranded RNA enveloped viruses with a monosegmented large genome. The linear nidoviruses genome is infectious, and its RNA molecule is capped and polyadenylated. The order Nidovirales is comprises four different families: Arteriviridae, Mesoniviridae, Coronaviridae and Roniviridae (Adams et al., 2017) . While genome size of nidoviruses differs significantly amid ca 12.7-33.4 kb, a general conserved genome organization, their replication strategy and sequence similarity in the replicase protein suggest that nidoviruses share a common ancestor (Gorbalenya et al., 2006) . Nidoviruses are widespread in humans and numerous animal species, and have been detected in terrestrial and marine mammals, fish, birds, reptiles, insects and crustaceans (De Groot et al., 2012; Nga et al., 2011; Lauber et al., 2012) . Interestingly, despite their evident broad host range, only one nidovirus has been associated with mollusks (Phylum Mollusca), more specifically with a Turritella sea snail (Gastropoda) (Shi et al., 2016) . The California sea hare (Aplysia californica) is a sea slug marine opisthobranch gastropod mollusk in the family Aplysiidae. This gigantic gastropod (up to 75 cm and 7 kg of weight) and valuable laboratory animal presents a \"simple\" nervous system of about 20 thousand neurons, distributed in 10 ganglia of ca. two thousand cells each.",

ORF1a (67-17,521 nt coordinates) appears to be followed by a putative pseudoknot (Figure 1 .E) that could be associated to translation read-through of a UGA stop codon (opal) at position 17,519-21 nt to generate a larger ORF1ab by suppression of termination (67-25,198 nt coordinates) . After a 53 nt spacer a second large ORF2 is predicted at 25,252-34,920 nt coordinates. The encoded ORF1ab and ORF2 are flanked by a 67 nt A/U rich (61.2 %) 5'UTR and a 964 nt long 3'UTR followed by a 22 nt Poly (A) tail. This genome organization, while clearly different from the hallmark configuration of nidoviruses, is shared with the only available nido-like virus associated with a gastropod reported yet: Beihai nido-like virus 1 (BNLV-1; Shi et al., 2016) . BNLV-1 presents two large ORFs encoding two polyproteins, and the first polyprotein encoded in ORF1ab is tentatively generated by readthrough of a premature stop codon at 7708-7710 nt, instead of a characteristic -1 ribsomal frameshifting, the standard for nidoviruses (Brierley et al., 1987 TM3, similar to that of picornavirus 3C proteinases, is responsible for the processing of the most conserved part of the replicase polyprotein (ORF1b) (Anand et al., 2002) . In the ORF1b polyprotein region, HHPred searches identified at 6496-6911 aa coordinates of ORF1ab a RNAdirected RNA polymerase (RdRP, PDB structure: 1RAJ_A; Probability: 96.82; E-value = 9.6e-6; Pfam = pfam00680) and at 7,259-7596 aa coordinates a Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus helicase domain (HEL, PDB structure: 5WWP_A; Probability: 99.76; E-value = 6.4e-23). This peculiar position of the RdRP upstream the HEL domain is distinctive, exclusive of nidovirales among ssRNA(+) viruses (Gorbalenya et al., 1989) , and has also been reported in tentative ssRNA(+) hypovirus-like mycoviruses (Marzano et al., 2016) . Additionally, between the RdRP and HEL domains, as expected, a multinuclear coronavirus zinc-binding domain (CV-ZBD) was identified (6,963-7,050 aa; score = 10.893; Prosite = PS51653). The predicted CV-ZBD domain contains 10 His/Cys typical residues at equilocal conserved positions of several nidoviruses ( Supp. Fig 2) . The ZBD domain has been indicated as a genetic marker of order Nidovirales, since it has not been identified in any other viral orders (Gorbalenya et al., 1989) .",

In sum, the predicted ORF1ab protein presents an array of characteristic domains in an architecture typically associated to nidoviruses (NH2-PL-TM1-TM2-3CLpro-TM3-RdRP-ZBD-HEL-MT-COOH) this specific domain order is essential for diverse aspects of the replicative cycle of nidoviruses (Gorbalenya, 2001) . Further characterization of ORF2 encoded protein (PP2) suggests a clear divergence between this polyprotein and ordinary nidoviruses. Nevertheless, divergent but consistent signatures were identified which supports its affinity with BNLV-1. ORF2 encodes a 3,224 polyprotein with an N-terminal signal peptide with a predicted cleavage site between residues Ala 21 and Gly 22 ( Fig.1. A.i-ii). HHPred searches identified at 276-471 aa coordinates of PP2 a Trypsin (TryP; E.C.3.4.21.4) serine protease domain (PDB structure: 5KWM_A; Probability: 98.88; E-value = 4.3e-12). At an equilocal position (128-308 aa coordinates), the ORF2 product of BNLV-1 presents a related domain (Trypsin-like serine protease; Superfamily = SSF50494; E-value = 5.9e-07). While proteases involved in post-translational processing of PP1ab are a hallmark of nidoviruses, evolutionary insights of the detected domain suggest that this peptidase is significantly related to the ones found in the digestive system of many vertebrates, where they hydrolyzes diverse proteins. Future studies should explore the potential source of the detected TryP domain, which might be associated to horizontal transmission from an eventual host. In addition, the C-region of ORF2 of BNLV-1 presents an alphavirus glycoprotein like domain (Superfamily = SSF56983; 1,335-1,546 aa). The A. californica ORF2 product presents an analogous, but highly divergent region with similarity with Torovirinae spike glycoprotein (Sgp; 2,185-3,092 aa; FFAS03 = PF17072.3; 17 % id) at the C-region of the predicted PP2, which could be associated with structural functions.",

At ca. 35.9 kb, AcNV is over 2.4 kb longer that the second largest: Ball phyton nidovirus 1 (BPNV-1) RNA genome (Stenglein et al., 2014) . When comparing the 84 refseq genomes of nidovirus available at NCBI and their taxonomic assignment to specific Nidovirales families or sub-families, three major groups became evident: (i) Arteriviridae members, \"small nidoviruses\"; (ii) Mesoniviridae, \"intermediate nidoviruses\", and (iii) Coronaviridae and Ronaviridae \"large nidoviruses\" (Supp. Fig 1.A-B) . Within the Coronaviridae group, particular dynamics in size may be observed such as a wider pattern of longitudes of subfamily Torovirinae members presenting a either ca. 20 kb genomes or larger ca. 32-33 kb ones, the latter being the snakehosted BPNV-1 and Morelia viridis nidovirus. On the other hand, sub-family Coronavirinae members present a more restricted pattern of genome length, which may be grouped by genus, from Deltacoronavirus to Betacoronavirus members (Supp . Fig 1.A) . It is possible that the discovery of new Ronaviridae like viruses would help complement this emergent grouping by RNA genome size. The placement of AcNV in this context is intriguing; the similar and only other mollusk nido-like virus BNLV-1 was reported to have a much shorter 20.2 kb RNA genome. Nevertheless, there are some hints that may suggest that BNLV-1 could be longer than reported: The described BNLV-1 sequence NC_032496 does not present any stop codon interrupting the ongoing ORF1a, thus the suggested translation start site and the reported 5'UTR could correspond to a truncated coding region of ORF1aPP.

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/307678 doi: bioRxiv preprint Given the estimated large size of AcNV genome, and the apparent constrains in terms of longer RNA viruses, the underlying basis of this discernible bar is under ongoing assessment. Probable causes of this size limit are under discussion, and the most plausible explanation could be associated with the high rate of RNA virus mutation associated with limited mechanisms of proof reading and repair, concomitant with high rates of replication (Holland, 1982; Denison et al., 2011) . Supporting these assumptions, in parallel, there appears to be a correlation between small genome DNA viruses and high rate of mutation. In evolutionary terms, mutation rates could be associated not only to polymerase fidelity, but also to viral biology, genome architecture and to replication speed (Duffy et al., 2008; Campillo-Balderas et al., 2015) . The size limit of RNA viruses is not specifically associated to monosegmented viruses. As a matter of fact, the largest members of the Reoviridae family, encompassing 9 to 12 dsRNA segments which added together grasp a total genome of ca. 32 kb, mirror the apparent size limit of Nidovirales and RNA viruses in general (Dolja & Koonin, 2018) . From and evolutionary perspective, it was recently suggested that the nido-like clade of animal viruses emerged in early invertebrates and through horizontal virus transmission then colonized vertebrates. This proposition was based on the relative small genome size of deep-rooted arthropod nidoviruses, and the observation that the largest genomes correspond to vertebrate coronaviruses, postulating that gene incorporation and layering (and concomitant genome length growth) succeeded during the co-evolution of nidoviruses and vertebrates (Dolja & Koonin, 2018) . The discovery here of the tentative AcNV associated to a mollusk, with the largest RNA genome of nidoviruses yet, with more affinity to intermediate-long Roniviridae than to larger coronaviruses, implies that the evolutionary history of Nidovirales could be more complex than expected.",

Polymorphic sites were defined with a conservative estimated frequency of at least \u2265 0.05 and a Phred score of 20 or higher to filter raw reads. Considering that sequencing errors of the diverse platforms reach at most ~1 % (Ion Torrent data), thus a 5% frequency threshold enables the detection of probable true variants in the virus RNA genome with high confidence. Cotten et al (2013) , with a similar strategy, explored virus variants of human betacoronavirus using as threshold 1 %. A 5% frequency threshold was used by Van den Hoecke et al (2015) to assess the variation landscape of Influenza virus A. The detected variability among bioprojects appears to be non-significant or within the levels of intra-host variability. While dispersed in time, most NGS libraries were generated from lab reared animals from the same provider. Thus it is tempting to suggest (this is pure speculation) that the low intrinsic variability observed could be linked with a single virus lineage maintained inadvertently through the years at the breeder facilities.",

Virus RNA transcripts were detected in an outstanding diversity of target tissue and organs, suggesting e pervasive tissue tropism, showing an emergent enrichment of AcNV in the CNS. Single-cell RNAseq data allowed the surveillance of AcNV at the cellular level, including not only specific types of neuron (e.g. abdominal ganglia neurons) but also the detection of AcNV in welldefined individual neurons of A. californica (e.g. R2, L29, R15). Interestingly, AcNV RNA accumulated at high levels in R2, which is the largest known neuron in the animal kingdom, offering an outstanding and unprecedented model for the study of virus dynamics at the single cell level. Besides their accessibility, ease to identify and size, each R2 neuron may yield over 1.9ug of RNA allowing to amplification-free RNA profiling at a single-neuron level (Moroz & Kohn, 2013) . The standard of single-cell RNAseq preparation in any other organism cells, which have picogram levels of nucleic acids, is a robust amplification step, which may lead to irregular coverage, noise and imprecise quantification of sequencing data (Islam et al., 2011) .",

In retrospective, it is perhaps worth contemplating the possibility that this hidden entity, present with certainty in samples of more than decade-old studies, might have influenced the outcome of any of the uncountable works published in the last 50 years. It is in this scenario that future studies should eagerly focus on the specific potential effects of this virus and its host.

(ii) A lineage of small nidoviruses (Arteviridae) associated also to vertebrates, which has been recently separated into five genera (Dip-Equ-Nes-Por-Sim-arterivirus).

The obtained tree indicates that AcNV unequivocally clusters within the order, in the pivotal major clade composed of recently proposed crustacean and gastropod nidoviruses, the Roniviridae family and Mesoniviridae.
