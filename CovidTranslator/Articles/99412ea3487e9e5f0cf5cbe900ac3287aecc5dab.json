We describe two young infants, monozygotic twins, with a severe B. pertussis pneumonia of whom one needed extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Diagnostic work-up of unexplained hematuria and proteinuria during the illness revealed low serum complement component 3 (C3) levels. During follow-up, C3 levels remained low (400-600 mg/L). Extensive analysis of the persistent low C3 levels revealed an unknown heterozygous mutation in the C3 gene in both siblings and their mother. This C3 mutation in combination with the specific virulence mechanisms of B. pertussis probably contributed to the severe disease course in these cases. Conclusion: We propose that genetically caused complement disorders should be considered when confronted with severe cases of B. pertussis infection.",

A genetic cause was suspected and parents gave permission to study the genes encoding the most important alternative complement pathway proteins (factor H, factor I, membrane cofactor protein, complement factor B [CFB], and C3). In both siblings, a previously unknown deletion of one nucleotide was identified in exon 21 of the gene encoding C3 (c.2696delT, p.Val899AlafsX5). This mutation causes a frameshift, leading to a preliminary stop (five amino acids after the deletion) in the MG7 domain of In gray, the C3 domains involved in CFB binding are indicated [5] . The images were generated using PyMOL with the Protein Data Bank file 2XWB the protein. The mutant protein is almost 46 % shorter than wild-type C3, resulting in the loss of important binding sites for CFB and the loss of the thioester bond important for the function of the protein (Fig. 1 ) [5] . Genomic DNA analysis in both parents showed a maternal inheritance; the mother of the twins is generally healthy, but recalls being frequently sick and suffering from upper respiratory tract infections as a child. The mutation probably leads to absent secretion of mutant C3 due to nonsense-mediated mRNA decay, which is indicated by serum C3 levels of about half of the normal. Consequently, one may expect that this mutation leads to an impaired complement activation system.",

The newly found mutation possibly causes lack of C3 secretion and can therefore be the reason for the persistent decreased serum C3 levels. Consequently, this causes less formation of MAC on bacteria and therefore leads to an impaired elimination of B. pertussis.",

Accordingly, one should consider to screen for abnormal complement protein levels when confronted with such a severe infection to B. pertussis or other pathogens that can evade the complement system by using similar mechanisms, as an underlying genetically caused complement disorder might be present.",
