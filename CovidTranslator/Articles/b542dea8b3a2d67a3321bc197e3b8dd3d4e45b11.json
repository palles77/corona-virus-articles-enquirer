Their financial statements show different results between the operating incomes and net incomes over time. To examine the major causes of the differences, this study measured the efficiency of the top three cruise lines to develop a network DEA model to analyze the cruise operations at two stages, namely operating and non-operating stages. In addition, the determinants of the efficiencies were examined using a bootstrapped-truncated regression model. Overall, cruise lines were efficient at the operating stage, but varied widely in the efficiency of the non-operating stage. Cruise lines attempting high capacity expansion were relatively inefficient because of the heavy interest payments arising from the high debt-to-capital ratio. Moreover, the neglected hedging policy regarding the financial risks also contributed to the inefficiency.",

            "text": "Cruise tourism has witnessed substantial growth in the tourism market over the last few decades. From 1980 to 2014, the annual growth rate of cruise passengers was 7.2% (FCCA, 2015) , where 22.1 million passengers enjoyed cruise travel in 2014 alone. The future of the industry is also encouraging. According to Cruise Market Watch, the number of passengers are projected to grow to 25 million in 2019 with an average growth rate of 4.5%. Although cruise tourism comprises only a fraction of the total tourism industry, whose total revenue amounted to $ 40 billion in 2015, the per capita expenditure of cruise passengers is more than double the amount of general tourists; in 2014, each passenger paid nearly $ 1797 to cruise lines for their service while other general tourists spent $ 830 (UNWTO, 2015) . The substantial spending of cruise passengers, together with the high growth rates indicate that the cruise industry has great market potential. Therefore, policy makers and researchers have paid close attention to the economic impacts of cruise tourism at the national or regional level (Braun, Xander, & White, 2002; Dwyer, Douglas, Livaic , 2004; Chang, Park, Liu, & Roh, 2016b; Dwyer & Forsyth, 1998) .",

            "text": "Cruise Market Watch reports several key statistics that characterize the cruise industry. For one thing, the industry is dominated by three major cruise lines. Carnival Corporation & plc (CCL) is the leader in the global market. In 2015, it carried 48.1% of passengers and collected 42.4% of revenue in the industry. Royal Caribbean Ltd. (RCL) and Norwegian Cruise Line (NCL) come next with the passenger and revenue share being 23.1% and 22.1%, and 10.4% and 12.4%, respectively. The oligopolistic market structure is rooted from two factors: the enormous fixed costs required in cruise line operation and the high entry barrier (Papatheodorou, 2006) . First, potential entrants should purchase cruise ships to operate, which costs almost a billion dollars per ship. To recover the fixed costs, entrants need to build a substantial customer base. Second, it is not easy for new comers to establish a passenger base due to brand-awareness and reputation effects, meaning that cruise passengers tend to prefer well-established cruise lines to reduce their risk of travel involving high expenditure.",

On the other hand, this is not always true when looking into the performance of the lines. Table 1 presents a snapshot of financial statements of the major cruise lines. All three lines have performed well in generating their revenues, but showed different outcomes in making their net incomes. Together with implementing a well-planned operation, cruise companies need to leverage their profits through appropriate financial strategies. A failure in financial strategies, e.g., hedging and capital investment, can decrease the final returns substantially even when sales and physical operation are successful. The variations in their performance in the table may have been affected by divergent business strategies in operation and financial management. Therefore, an interesting research question arises; if cruise lines are efficient in both operational and financial management, and if not, which part caused the inefficiency?",

Other than cruise lines, a variety of tourism units have been analyzed in the tourism literature to determine if their operation was efficient, e.g., hotels (Barros, 2005; Hwang & Chang, 2003) , resorts (Goncalves, 2013) , and travel agencies (Fuentes, 2011) . These studies applied a widely used method, the data envelopment analysis (DEA) proposed by Charnes, Cooper, and Rhodes (1978) (henceforth, CCR model). DEA is a programming-based method to gauge the performance of organizational units in relation to their peers. The main advantage of DEA is that it does not require a production function and can handle multiple inputs and outputs. This attractive feature has made DEA pervasive among researchers.",

            "text": "The DEA models used in tourism papers assumed predominantly that the inputs were converted to outputs via a single production process. On the other hand, this may misrepresent many cases including cruise line operation. For example, cruise lines initially attempt to induce as many passengers as possible to generate ticket and ancillary revenues. This process is followed by profit generation, which is related to the cruise lines' efforts to maximize the net income out of their revenue. In this case, at least two stages of the production process are involved in cruise line operation, i.e. operational and financial. Therefore, traditional DEA models with a single process used in existing works of the tourism literature are inadequate to analyze the operational procedures. Rather, it can be modelled more properly by the network DEA, which originated from F\u20ac are and Grosskopf (1996) . Network DEA models are advantageous when evaluating a multi-level production process. Yu and Lee (2009) and Hsieh and Lin (2010)s application of a network DEA model to the hotel industry showed that the model has potential merits in evaluating the tourism units by enabling a sophisticated depiction of its operation.",

Section 3 illustrates the network structure of cruise line operation and its mathematical formulation and specifies the estimation model that determines the efficiency. The data source, data handling, and results are presented in Section 4, and Section 5 concludes the paper. Wild and Dearing (2000) defines cruise tourism as \"any maritime based tour by fare paying guests onboard a vessel whose primary purpose is the carriage of passengers.\" As the definition suggests, cruise tourism encompasses leisure, transportation and logistics, and maritime businesses. Owing to the applied and integrated nature of the cruise industry, theoretical development and empirical research have been scant, and in-depth research for the cruise industry is growing only in recent years. Researchers examined the cruise industry mainly from three divergent angles: cruise line operation, passenger analysis, and economic effects.",

            "text": "Studies on cruise line operation analyzed the nature of cruise lines and their suitable management strategy. Weaver (2005) made a deep look into the cruise operation from \"Mcdonaldization\" perspective. He argued that essential indicators of Mcdonaldization were observed in the cruise industry, which are efficiency, calculability, predictability, and irrationality of rationality. However, he contended that inherent risk in cruise operation, e.g., safety and weather condition, and service differentiation within a ship or Ladany and Arbel (1991) proposed a revenue management model for cruise lines to determine the optimal number of market segments and the pricing policy. To this end, passenger demand was assumed to be linear, and the equal number of market segment was considered to simplify the model. Ji and Mazzarella (2007) validated two frequently used revenue management models, which are modified nested class allocation model and dynamic class allocation model. Sun, Gauri, and Webster (2011) applied numerous forecasting methods to identify the most suitable forecasting models for revenue management of cruise lines. Their finding suggests that revenue management forecasting for hotel industry is not necessarily applicable to the cruise industry. Wie (2005) derived the optimal capacity investment of cruise lines when they provide homogeneous service in an oligopolistic market.",

Checking the relationship between major loyalty constructs, the authors found that cognitive, affective, and conative loyalties are sufficient to explain behavioral loyalty. The question of \"why people cruise\" was addressed by Hung and Petrick (2011) . They showed that cruise motivation could be categorized into four dimensions, which are self-esteem/social recognition, escape/relaxation, learning/discovery/thrill, and bonding. Hyun and Han (2013) studied the effect of \"other passengers' perception\" on a passenger's social value, brand attachment, and willingness to pay a price premium. Their results suggest that the significant effect of other passengers' perception influence social value, and brand attachment. In addition, a mediating relationship of brand attachment on willingness to pay a price premium was identified. Chang, Liu, Park, and Roh (2016a) examined the determinants of cruise passengers' satisfaction. After surveying passengers before and after their trips, they inferred that satisfaction and revisit-intention were mainly explained by cruise travelers' experience on site rather than the gap between expectation and real experience.",

            "text": "Several authors have contributed to measuring the efficiency in the tourism sector, predominantly using DEA. Hwang and Chang (2003) used the CCR model and Malmquist Productivity Index to analyze the performance of Taiwanese hotels. They measured the change in the managerial efficiency of the hotels over time and found a link between efficiency and strategy formulation. Barros (2005) evaluated the performance of Portuguese hotels using the input-oriented CCR model. He showed that the economies of scale and location were major factors that determined the hotel efficiency. The same model was used in K\u20ac oksal and Aksu (2007), who assessed the A-Group travel agencies in Turkey. They found an insignificant difference in efficiency between the agencies operating independently and the ones operating under a chain brand. Barros, Botti, Peypoch, Robinot, and Solonandrasana (2011) identified the key determinants of efficiency in French tourist destinations. Initially, they ran an output-oriented CCR model to measure the efficiency, which was followed by the bootstrappedtruncated regression of the tourist attraction features on the efficiency. Their results suggested that beach endowments, the presence of theme parks, monuments, museums, ski resorts, and natural parks improved efficiency. In their analysis of Italian tourist regions, Bosetti, Cassinelli, and Lanza (2007) calculated the Malmquist Productivity Index to gauge the technological and efficiency change of the regions over time. They incorporated the variables related to the environment as well as tourism service provision, claiming that the tourism regions should minimize their environmental effects to maintain competitiveness. W\u20ac ober and Fesenmaier (2004) applied both input and outputoriented DEA models to evaluate the state tourism advertising programs in the U.S. By applying super efficiency, they further differentiated the rankings among the efficient programs. Reynolds and Thompson (2007) used the output-oriented CCR model to assess full-service restaurants in the U.S. Their approach is unconventional in that they analyzed the effects of the marginal input usage on the restaurant efficiency. To this end, they first identified a set of inputs that correlated with the outputs and treated all inputs as uncontrollable. By increasing the input usage one at a time, they found what inputs drove the efficiency improvement mostly. Gim enez-Garc\u00eda, Mart\u00ednez-Parra, and Buffa (2007) utilized both input-and output-oriented BCC models (variable return-to-scale model) to evaluate the restaurant establishments of a Spanish fast-food chain. Goncalves (2013) measured the Luenberger Productivity Indicator of French ski resorts, which enabled them to examine both the technical efficiency change and technological change in the places.",

On the other hand, tourism service is often offered in multi-level process, e.g., tourism units may attract a number of tourists first, and then they would attempt to leverage revenue from tourists. In contrast to the tourism literature, theoretical DEA literature shows advanced model developments to represent the multi-level processes, so called \"network DEA.\" F\u20ac are and Grosskopf (1996, 2000) paved the way of network DEA via introducing \"intermediate outputs\" to a conventional DEA model. Several applications confirmed earlier work. Liang, Yang, Cook, and Zhu (2006) proposed a supply-chain model, where a supplier and retailer cooperate with each other in a leader-follower relationship. Bogetoft, F\u20ac are, Grosskopf, Hayes, and Taylor (2009) examined the optimal investment path of firms in a manner that utilized capital and leveraged the final output production. Tone and Tsutsui (2009, 2014) modified the previous models, incorporating \"slacks\" in an efficiency measure. The primary merit of their model is that the inputs or outputs do not necessarily need to be improved equiproportionally, and the worst aspects of firm operation are emphasized. Chang, Park, Zou, and Kafle (2016c) examined the financing reform of the U.S. airports in a dynamic network framework. In particularly, substitutability between the passenger facility charge and airport improvement funds, which are the two major financing sources of the U.S. airports, were analyzed.",

The present research team checked the major items of the cruise companies financial statements carefully in detail for the consideration of selecting input, intermediate and output variables at the two stages. The first stage, \"operating process\", refers to the revenue-generating activities of the firms. In particular, payroll, operating, and administrative expenses, and depreciation turned out to be the major input variables in producing the outputs, such as ticket and onboard revenues and operating income. The payroll and related expenses are the payments for shipboard personnel, officers, deck and engine crew, and hotel and administrative employees. The payroll was separated from overall operating expenses to reflect the degree of customer service on board ship, e.g., more payroll implies the employment of more crewmembers, which improves the service quality (Teye & Leclerc, 1998) . Administrative expenses contain marketing, sales, and administration activity expenses, which are generated mainly via the shore side operation. Depreciation is allocated generally over the 30-year economic life span of the asset. The other operating expenses include the cost of passenger bookings, transportation expenses, commissions of travel agents, fees, taxes, and other charges. Ticket revenues comprise the sales of passenger tickets, and the air transportation to or from ships. A ticket price generally includes meals, accommodation, onboard entertainment, and some non-alcoholic beverages. Onboard revenues are the sales of goods and service onboard ships, which are not included in the ticket price. 1 The next stage, non-operating process, describes the performance of cruise lines in generating profits out of the earned income. Note that the operating income serves as an intermediate output, meaning that it mediates the first and second stages. The operating income is calculated by subtracting all expenses from the total revenue. The non-operating expense is also added to the second stage, which includes the net of interest expenses and other expenses. The result of the second stage operation is the net income. This refers to the remaining portion of the total revenue after excluding the total cruise operating expenses, total other operating expenses, total non-operating expenses, and income tax expenses.",

For such models, he showed that the data can be handled by adding an arbitrarily large fixed value to observations in potentially negative variables. Zhu (1999, 1996) chose rather extreme approach: they removed the observations that contain negative values from their samples. More recently, Portela, Thanassoulis, and Simpson (2004) developed a \"range directional distance function\" model, which is to construct an artificially constructed frontier by setting improvement vector at (x\u00c0min(x),max(y)\u00c0y). This method was extended by Sharp, Meng, and Liu (2007) , who proposed a slack-based measure (SBM) of the previous model.

Since the network SBM model is not translation-invariant, Pastor (1996) s solution does not apply in our case.

(2007) where, y j is an output observation of firm j. This way, bad performers are severely penalized. Even though accuracy is lost to some extent, this treatment is simple and clear, and more importantly, we could not find any better feasible alternative than this. One can argue that this approach still has a problem of bias. In this aspect, we find that no literature is available to address this issue. Therefore, we have developed our new approach to assess the potential measurement errors that might be inherent in this approximation indirectly through data translation. First, we added a sufficiently large positive constant a to a variable with negative observations, i.e. Y o \u00bcy o \u00fea>0. Next, we calculated the second stage efficiency score with translated data (because negative values were present in the second stage output, so affecting the second stage Table 4 lists the efficiency scores of the cruise lines. The year of observation, and its corresponding efficiencies are reported. Fig. 2 summarizes the average efficiency to gain greater insight. A quick inspection reveals that CCL is most efficient in terms of the overall efficiency with average 0.883, followed in order by RCL with 0.695 and NCL with 0.275. Regarding the changes in efficiency over time, there appears to be no clear pattern because the efficiency scores fluctuate widely.",

The RCL is in between with the average efficiency of 0.695. These results suggest that the variation of the cruise line performance arises mainly at the non-operating stage, which reflects the companies financial or accounting activities, e.g., interest payment and taxation. The efficiency scores suggest that relatively inefficient RCL and NCL can increase their net income (the final output of the non-operating stage) by improving their financial strategies. On the other hand, to identify the possible financial strategies to leverage their income, the determinants of efficiency should be examined.

This could have been attributed to their hedging policy. RCL and CCL actively hedged against fuel costs, interest rates, and exchange rates while NCL failed to do so (This was officially stated in the annual report of NCL in 2006). The failure intensified NCL's already massive debt when the interest rate escalated. Indeed, in December 31, 2006, NCL had $2.6 billion of total debt, of which $154.6 million was the portion of long-term borrowings, which were mostly incurred to finance ship construction. In the same year, the LIBOR and EURIBOR rate increased by 1%, increasing their burdens of debt payment. For this reason, NCL recorded huge foreign currency translation losses, e.g., total losses of $ 25.3 million throughout 2002e2006. In addition, NCL had to bear substantial impairment losses occurring in 2008 due to the cancellation of a shipbuilding contract. Overall, NCL's neglecting the hedging strategies and the sudden cancellation of a shipbuilding contract largely contributed to the negative net income of NCL for 2003e2008. This explains NCL's exceptionally low non-operating efficiency score compared to RCL.",

In the specification, cruise lines generate ticket revenue, other revenues, and operating income from their labor and capital resources at the operating stage. The operating income flows directly into the non-operating stage, which is closely associated with the financial activities of cruise lines that plow profits (net incomes) out of the operating income. Once the efficiencies of the lines were estimated by the DEA model, the determinants affecting the efficiencies were estimated using the bootstrapped-truncated regression.",

Their operation, however, was prone to epidemics as evidenced in tourism literature (Baxter & Bowen, 2004; Cooper, 2006) . Next, the operating efficiency improved during economic crisis because cruise lines reduced their operating costs significantly. This interesting point is new in tourism literature, as existing studies (Papatheodorou et al., 2010; Smeral, 2010; Song & Lin, 2010) only highlighted indicators such as tourist counts. Another finding is that the non-operating efficiency of cruise lines varied widely, most likely due to their different financial strategies. Aggressive market followers, such as RCL and NCL, recorded low efficiency at the non-operating stage because of their high debt ratio, which put severe pressure on debt payments. This finding is similar to financial efficiency patterns in the other fields (Pires and Fernandes, 2012; Beck et al., 2013) . In addition, though implicative, hedging strategies could also have affected the non-operational efficiency. For example, RCL and NCL adopted similar financial strategies in terms of the debt to capital ratio, but the nonoperating efficiency of NCL was significantly different. This is because NCL failed to hedge against the interest rate and exchange rate, making it vulnerable to financial downturns. It is also noteworthy to see that economic downturn had detrimental effect on non-operating efficiency in general. Investment and capital utilization affected cruise lines net income critically, and even rigorous restructuring of operation could not make up for them.",

            "text": "This paper provides several managerial implications. First, epidemics affects the cruise lines' sales operation. To mitigate potential travelers' concerns on diseases, cruise lines need to ensure passengers that their service is clean and secure from epidemics. Media advertisement can be an effective tool to relieve potential travelers' worries. In addition, it would be helpful for cruise lines to reposition current operating routes to avoid tourist attractions labelled as \"epidemic zone.\" The second implication is that cruise lines should prepare themselves for economic downturn, which poses great threat to earning net income. One way to cope with the shock is hedging. Active hedging against fuel costs (which accounts for the majority of operating costs) and insurance on idle capacity would be essential. Decision-makers should be aware that presumably wasteful spending on hedging in normal times can minimize significant loss during economic downturn. Another critical point is the capital investment. This strategy is essential for cruise lines to increase market share in the long run. The resulting debt burdens, however, can hurt the financial health of expanding cruise lines, leading to reduced net income and dividends for shareholders (note that NCL's main source of non-operating inefficiency is high debt-to-capital ratio, which must have been mainly caused by aggressive capital investment). This can make investors hesitant to further investment, which in turn would increase the debt financing again. Hence, capital investment should be calculated by examining its negative impacts. When investing capital by debt financing, cruise lines should not hesitate to hedge against interest rate, fuel price, foreign currency, and other available hedging mechanisms. This would enable cruise lines to avoid sudden increases in liability (if interest rate gets high) and avoid the postponement of debt payment when the market condition is unfavorable. This paper suggest a few directions for further study. First, if detailed information on hedging strategy of cruise lines becomes available, we can formally estimate the relationship between hedging and non-operating efficiency more quantitatively. Second, one can develop alternative network structures and recalculate the efficiency scores using other types of input and output sets. In this way, we can check whether the efficiency ranking among cruise lines are robust. Third, one can use dynamic DEA models to incorporate the inter-temporal influences between the years. Furthermore, since DEA efficiency measures are deterministic, some authors employed \"bootstrapping\" to draw confidence intervals for efficiency scores (Nguyen, Nguyen, Chang, Chin, & Tongzon, 2016; . The method would be beneficial in checking the robustness of DEA results in future research. Lastly, researchers can improve the method of handling negative output data, rather than substituting negative values by scaling down positive output values among observations, which this paper employed. To this end, researchers need to develop a network DEA model that captures the negativity of data in measuring inefficiency.",

Similarly, (2) shows that the cruise line o has potential to increase output by s k\u00fe r . Constraint (3) is a newly incorporated component into the network DEA, which states that the intermediate output produced at the first stage directly flows to the second stage. In other words, the intermediate outputs are not added or lost when they are moved through the stages. Eq.
