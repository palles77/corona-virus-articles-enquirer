            "text": "In vitro culture conditions were determined to induce an anti-Salmonella abortusovis antibody synthesis from lymph node leucocytes of three immunized sheep and two unprimed lambs maintained in culture in the presence of heat-inactivated bacteria for 2 weeks. Humoral immune responses were assessed by enumerating specific antibody-secreting cells using ELISASPOT and by titrating immunoglobulins secreted into culture supernatants using ELISA techniques. Optimal secondary antibody response was observed from cultures performed with fetal calf serum (compared with horse serum) and with an antigen concentration of one to ten bacteria per cell. This kind of antigenic stimulation allowed induction of numerous antibody-secreting cells without adsorption of the secreted antibodies. Maximal numbers of antibody-secreting cells could reach a rate of 1% of the sheep leucocytes initially put into culture. Kinetic profiles of antibody production from boosted lymph node cells were characterized by an ascending phase from the sixth to the twelfth day of culture and then showed a plateau phase until Day 14. Most of the responses were composed of IgM and IgG1 antibodies, traces of IgG2 being detected at the end of experiments. From the twelfth day of antigenic stimulation, the IgM isotype was preferentially expressed with high antigen concentration ( 100 bacteria per cell), whereas the highest amounts of IgG 1 were detected at lower concentration (one to ten bacteria per cell ). While anti-Salmonella IgM appeared to be mainly specific for the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) cell wall fraction, some IgG1 recognized other bacterial antigens. Kinetic profiles and magnitudes of primary antibody responses induced in vitro from lamb lymph node cells did not differ from those defined in cultures of sheep boosted leucocytes. But these immune reactions were mainly made up of anti-LPS IgM. Few anti-Salmonella IgG i were detected from the tenth day of culture. So these in vitro assays allowed induction of an antibody synthesis from either in vivo sensitized or unprimed sheep lymph node leucocytes. This methodology would permit achievement of more detailed studies on interactions between Salmonella and lymph node leucocytes, leading to a better understanding of the mechanisms controlling bacterial dissemination through the lymphoid tissue.",

Immune responses induced within lymph nodes seem to play a fundamental role in control of the infectious process. T-lymphocyte responses appear late, from nearly the tenth day following infection (Maskell et al., 1987 ) , and are responsible for granuloma formation (Guilloteau et al., 1991 ) . However, in cell-transfer experiments studying protective mechanisms, it has been shown that T-cells from lymph nodes were more efficient than spleen cells in the transfer of anti-Brucella immunity to mice (Plommet and Plommet, 1987 ) . Antibody production from B-cells occurs earlier in infection and is usually considered as the first evidence of the bacterial contamination. With their agglutinin and opsonin properties, specific antibodies secreted within lymphoid tissue would be involved in control of the bacterial colonization of lymph nodes, as has been previously described (Pardon, 1977; Plommet and Plommet, 1989) .",

The establishment of an experimental model of infection by Salmonella abortusovis, a serotype specific for sheep which induces abortion and sometimes mortality of newborn lambs (Pardon et al., 1990b) , gives the opportunity to study the Salmonella pathogenesis pattern in its natural host. In mice, experimental inoculation of S. abortusovis results in an infection similar to the one developed after Salmonella typhimurium administration (Pardon and Marly, 1979; Lantier et al., 1981 ) .",

Beh, CSIRO, Division of Animal Health, McMaster Laboratory, Glebe, Australia). After a 90 min incubation at 37 \u00b0 C, monoclonal antibody binding was detected with peroxidase-conjugated goat Ig to mouse IgG (H and L chains) (Bio-Rad, No. 172-1011 ), 1 : 10 000 diluted in Tween-milk-PBS and incubated for 90 min at 37 \u00b0C. Between each of the steps, plates were washed four times with tap water and three times with 0.05% Tween 20 in saline. The peroxidase activity was detected with 2,2'-azino-bis-( 3-ethyl benzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (Boehringer Mannheim)/H202 substrate solution and read at 415 nm (Bernard et al., 1986 ) . Optical densities were obtained according to the serial 1 : 3 dilutions of samples allowed to obtain ELISA logistic curves. These curves underwent conversion to logits to get linear functions enabling the determination of the sample dilution for the point of inflexion of the ELISA logistic curves.",

The highest cell recoveries were observed with the concentration of inactivated Salmonella of 100 bacteria per cell. Higher amounts of inactivated S. abortusovis per well have been tested ( 160 bacteria per cell), corresponding to the antigen concentration of the stock suspension of Salmonella. These conditions led to similar results to those obtained with the former bacterial concentration (data not shown). Culture conditions defined in this report differ from those previously described for pig blood lymphocytes stimulated with bacterial antigens such as membrane components of Haemophilus pleuropneumoniae (Borthwick et al., 1988 ) . In that case, the boost in vitro had to be carried out in the form of an antigenic pulse for 16 h to keep the cells clear of the cytotoxic effect of such antigens. Results on cell culture recoveries from sheep lymph node leucocytes stimulated with inactivated S. abortusovis, showed that these cells could be maintained in the presence of whole bacteria throughout the experiments. Some samples were cultured for 1 month (data not shown).",

Furthermore, characteristics of the immune reaction developed from in vivo primed leucocytes were identical to those observed in vivo. This suggests that these reported culture conditions might allow partial reproduction in vitro of some of the physiological mechanisms occurring in vivo. Such in vitro assays will give rise to more detailed studies on the interactions between Salmonella and lymph node APC and on the resulting immune responses, in relation to the expression of the host genetic resistance to the disease.

The earliest IgM and IgG1 antibody secretions were observed in vitro using the lowest antigenic stimulation. These anti-S, abortusovis antibody titres increased until Day 14, except the IgM responses induced with one bacterium per cell which decreased from Day 10. From the twelfth day of culture, the highest anti-S, Ig-isotype and specificity of the anti-Salmonella abortusovis antibodies secreted into supernatants of the cell cultures performed with fetal calf serum, during the secondary humoral immune response (see caption to Fig. 1 ).
