            "text": "Human rabies was first recorded in ancient China in about 556 BC and is still one of the major publichealth problems in China. From 1950 human rabies cases were reported in Mainland China with an average of 1977 cases per year. It is estimated that 95% of these human rabies cases are due to dog bites. The purpose of this article is to provide a review about the models, results, and simulations that we have obtained recently on studying the transmission of rabies in China. We first construct a basic susceptible, exposed, infectious, and recovered (SEIR) type model for the spread of rabies virus among dogs and from dogs to humans and use the model to simulate the human rabies data in China from 1996 to 2010. Then we modify the basic model by including both domestic and stray dogs and apply the model to simulate the human rabies data from Guangdong Province, China. To study the seasonality of rabies, in Section 4 we further propose a SEIR model with periodic transmission rates and employ the model to simulate the monthly data of human rabies cases reported by the Chinese Ministry of Health from January 2004 to December 2010. To understand the spatial spread of rabies, in Section 5 we add diffusion to the dog population in the basic SEIR model to obtain a reaction-diffusion equation model and determine the minimum wave speed connecting the disease-free equilibrium to the endemic equilibrium. Finally, in order to investigate how the movement of dogs affects the geographically inter-provincial spread of rabies in Mainland China, in Section 6 we propose a multi-patch model to describe the transmission dynamics of rabies between dogs and humans and use the two-patch submodel to investigate the rabies virus clades lineages and to simulate the human rabies data from Guizhou and Guangxi, Hebei and Fujian, and Sichuan and Shaanxi, respectively. Some discussions are provided in Section 7 .",

When a susceptible human individual is bitten by an infectious dog, this human individual is now exposed. Data [51] indicate that the incubation period ranges from 5 days to 3 years, with a median of 41 days and a mean of 70 days. About 15-20% of those bitten by infected dogs progress to illness and become infectious [9] . Since more and more bitten people are seeking for PEP, the recovered rate of infected humans has been increasing in China [15] .",

All species of mammals are susceptible to rabies virus infection, but dogs remain the main carrier of rabies and are responsible for most of the human rabies deaths worldwide [13] . The rabies virus infects the central nervous system, ultimately causing disease in the brain and death. Once the symptoms of rabies have developed, its mortality rate is almost 100%. Rabies causes almost 60,0 0 0 deaths worldwide per year [29, 53, 92, 105] , more than 95% of which occur in Asia and Africa [50] .

The first peak occurred from 1956 to 1957 with about 20 0 0 cases in both years, followed by substantial decreases in the early 1960s. The number of cases reached 20 0 0 again in 1969 and increased to the historical record of 7037 cases in 1981. During the 1980s, more then 50 0 0 cases were reported annually. In the 1990s, the number of cases declined rapidly from 3520 in 1990 to 159 in 1996 [60, 115] . Since then, the number of human rabies case has increased steadily again and reached another peak in 2007 with 3300 cases [60, 84] . From 1996 to 2015, 30,300 human rabies cases were reported [59] [60] [61] . Though human rabies were reported in almost all provinces in China [45] , nearly 60% of the total rabies cases in China were reported in the southern Guangdong, Guangxi, Guizhou, Hunan, and Sichuan provinces [60] . It is believed that the increase of rabies deaths results from a major increase in dog ownership and a very low rate of rabies vaccination [60] . In rural areas, about 70 percent of households have dogs and vaccination coverage of dogs is very low, largely because of poor awareness of rabies and the high cost of vaccination. Moreover, owned dogs usually have not been registered and the number of dogs is estimated at 80-200 millions [87] .",

Zhang et al. [115] analyzed the 108,412 human rabies cases in China from 1950 to 2004. They suggested that the rabies epidemics in China may be explained by dog population dynamics, untimely and inappropriate postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) treatment, and the existence of healthy carrier dogs. Si et al. [79] examined the 22,527 human rabies cases from January 1990 to July 2007 and the details of 244 rabies patients, including their anti-rabies treatment of injuries or related incidents. They concluded that the failure to receive PEP was a major factor for the increase of human cases in China. Song et al. [84] investigated the status and characteristics of human rabies in China between 1996 and 2008 to identify the potential factors involved in the emergence of rabies. Yin et al. [107] compiled all published articles and official documents on rabies in mainland China to examine challenges and needs to eliminate rabies in the country.",

Various models have been used to study different aspects of rabies in wild animals. Anderson et al. [3] pioneered a deterministic model consisting of three subclasses, susceptible, infectious and recovered, to explain epidemiological features of rabies in fox populations in Europe. A susceptible, exposed, infectious, and recovered (SEIR) model was proposed by Coyne et al. [19] , and lately was also used by Childs et al. [14] , to predict the local dynamics of rabies among raccoons in the United States. Dimitrov et al. [24] presented a model for the immune responses to a rabies virus in bats. Clayton et al. [17] considered the optimal control of an SEIRS model which describes the population dynamics of a rabies epidemic in raccoons with seasonal birth pulse. Besides these deterministic models, discrete deterministic and stochastic models [2, 7] , continuous spatial models [48] , and stochastic spatial models [75, 81] have also been employed to study the transmission dynamics of rabies. See also [27, 33, 38, 73, 82, 83] . We refer to reviews by Sterner and Smith [86] and Panjeti and Real [70] for more detailed discussions and references on different rabies models. Note that all these modeling studies focused on rabies in wildlife [55] .",

            "text": "In the last a few years, our team have been trying to model the transmission dynamics of rabies in China by considering different characters and aspects. In Zhang et al. [113] we constructed a basic susceptible, exposed, infectious, and recovered (SEIR) type model for the spread of rabies virus among dogs and from dogs to humans and used the model to simulate the human rabies data in China from 1996 to 2010. In Hou et al. [43] we modified the basic model in Zhang et al. [113] by including both domestic and stray dogs and applied the model to simulated the human rabies data from Guangdong Province, China. Observing that the monthly data of human rabies cases reported by the Chinese Ministry of Health from January 2004 exhibit a periodic pattern on an annual base, in Zhang et al. [111] we proposed a SEIR model with periodic transmission rates to investigate the seasonal rabies epidemics and used the model to simulate the monthly data of human rabies cases reported by the Chinese Ministry of Health from January 2004 to December 2010. To understand the spatial spread of rabies, in Zhang et al. [112] we added diffusion to the dog population in the SEIR model considered by Zhang et al. [113] to obtain a reactiondiffusion equation model, determined the minimum wave speed connecting the disease-free equilibrium to the endemic equilibrium and illustrated the existence of traveling waves by numerical simulations. In order to investigate how the movement of dogs affects the geographically inter-provincial spread of rabies in Mainland China, in Chen et al. [12] we proposed a multi-patch model to describe the transmission dynamics of rabies between dogs and humans and used the two-patch submodel to investigate the rabies virus clades lineages and to simulate the human rabies data from Guizhou and Guangxi, Hebei and Fujian, and Sichuan and Shaanxi, respectively. The purpose of this article is to provide a review about the models, results, and simulations that we have obtained in these papers on studying the transmission of rabies in China. We also summarize the prevention and control measures for the spread of rabies in mainlan China that were proposed based on these studies. Finally we discuss some topics for future study. ",

Zinsstag et al. [117] also estimated the effective reproductive ratio to be 1.01 through a research framework for rabies in an African city. Also for the rabies in USA in the 1940s when the annual reported cases varied from 42 to 113 and sharply increased in 1948, it was estimated that R 0 = 2 . 334 [18] .

From Fig. 2 .3 , we can see that the initial population sizes of both dogs and humans effect on I h ( t ). Moreover, the initial conditions of dogs can influence not only the number of human rabies cases but also the time of rabies case peak. The initial conditions of humans do not have such effects. We also observe that the peak of the initial outbreak would be postponed if S d (0) is decreasing. Next, to find better control strategies for rabies infection, we perform some sensitivity analysis of I h ( t ) and the basic reproduction number R 0 in terms of the model parameters. First, we show variations of I h ( t ) with time for different values of R 0 in Fig. 2.4 . We can see that R 0 is really the threshold for the establishment of the disease in the susceptible pool and the number of infections increases with the increase of R 0 ( Fig. 2.4 (A) ). The influences of A and k on I h ( t ) are shown in Fig. 2 .4 (B)(C). It can be observed that I h ( t ) decreases as A is declining or k is increasing. When A = 10 6 and k = 0 . 98 , the disease can die out. Moreover, we find that the decrease of A cannot delay the time of the first peak while an increase of k can. Furthermore, the influences of A, \u03b2, k on R 0 are given in Fig. 2 .5 . It is clear that R 0 changes more quickly when both A and \u03b2 vary. When \u03b2 is very small, the disease can be eliminated even if A = 5 \u00d7 10 6 . When \u03b2 \u2265 4 \u00d7 10 \u22127 , the disease cannot be eliminated even if A = 10 6 . From (B) and (C) in Fig. 2 .5 , it is clear that when A or \u03b2 is very small, the disease can disappear even if k = 0 . When A > 3 \u00d7 10 6 or \u03b2 \u2265 3 \u00d7 10 \u22127 , the disease cannot be eliminated even if k = 1 . Hence, it indicates that the influence of A and \u03b2 on the basic reproduction number R 0 is greater. Fig. 2 .5 reflects that whatever dog vaccination rate is, when the annual crop of newborn puppies is greater than 3 million and dog-to-dog transmission rate is greater than 3 \u00d7 10 \u22127 , R 0 cannot be below 1. However, it is difficult to control \u03b2. Currently, in China the annual crop of newborn puppies can exceed 5 million and the proportion of immunized dogs is only about 10%, which is too low.",

Now most households in Guangdong, Guangxi, Guizhou, and Hunan Provinces, where most of the rabies cases were recorded in recent years, have at least one dog. However, dog rabies surveillance often has not been carried out and most people are unaware of the risk of rabies in China. Domestic dog vaccination rate remains 2.8-6.4% [44] , and only 30% or less of infected patients seek medical services or receive adequate post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP, which consists of local treatment of the wound, followed by vaccine therapy with or without rabies immunoglobulin) [79, 84, 114] . In Guangdong Province, there are more than three million domestic dogs and many stray dogs, but only about four hundred thousand rabies vaccines are sold every year. In particular, some infected domestic dogs are not treated properly and are abandoned by their hosts or run away from their hosts. From 2003 to 2004, 66.5% of the human rabies cases were caused by domestic dogs and at least 18.2% by stray dogs and others [79] . Between 2006 and 2010, a total of 1671 human rabies cases were reported in Guangdong Province, the average outbreak rate is about 0.40/10 0,0 0 0, accounting for 12.7% of the total cases of China [20, 61] , see Table 3 .1 . After Guangxi and Hunan Provinces, Guangdong has the third most rabies cases in China [79] . In this section, taking into account some specific characteristics of rabies transmission in Guangdong Province of China, we propose a susceptible-exposed-infectious-vaccinated (SEIV) model for the dog-human transmission of rabies taking both domestic and stray dogs into consideration. We classify each of the stray dog, domestic dog, and human populations into four subclasses: susceptible, exposed, infective and vaccinated. Let S 0 ( t ), E 0 ( t ), I 0 ( t ), V 0 ( t ), and S 1 ( t ), E 1 ( t ), I 1 ( t ), V 1 ( t ) denote the densities of susceptible, exposed, infective and vaccinated stray dog and domestic dog populations; S h ( t ), E h ( t ), I h ( t ), V h ( t ) denote the densities of susceptible, exposed, infective and vaccinated human populations at time t , respectively.

Fig. 3 .2 shows that the simulation of our model with reasonable parameters values provides a good match to the data on infected human rabies cases in Guangdong Province from 2006 to 2010. With the current control measures, our model predicts that the human rabies infection cases would continue decreasing in the next a couple of years and then may increase slightly afterward. With the simulated parameter values, we estimate that R 0 = 1 . 65 . Thus, human rabies will persist in Guangdong Province under the current control and prevention measures. If we fix all parameters except l (the rate at which domestic dogs are abandoned) and (the rate rabid domestic dogs become stray dogs), the basic reproduction number R 0 increases as l and increase. represents the relationship between R 0 and the quantity of stray dogs. We can see that the influence of parameter on the basic reproduction number R 0 is greater than that of parameter l , thus culling domestic infected dogs at the right time can effectively decrease R 0 . From Fig. 3 .3 (c) and (d), we can also see that culling stray dog population (increasing c ) can reduce R 0 . Moreover, in order to control rabies, the larger is, the more important it is to target culling stray dogs. Though both vaccinating susceptible dogs and culling stray dogs are effective control measures, comparing Fig. 3 .4 (a) and (b), we find that R 0 can become less than one if vaccination rate \u03bd is greater than 50% but cannot become less than one even though the culling rate is 100%. Thus, culling stray dogs alone is not a good control measure while vaccination is a more effective one. Fig. 3 .4 (c) and (d) depicts the plots of R 0 in terms of ( \u03bd, c ) and ( \u03bd, ), respectively. We can see that increasing the vac-cination rate and the culling rate of rabid domestic dogs are more effective than increasing the vaccination rate and the culling rate of stray dogs. Therefore, culling of infected dogs and vaccination are most important and effective means to control rabies infection. From Fig. 3 .5 (a), we can see that the acute infection in humans in Guangdong Province would be reduced evidently through the decrease of the stray dog population. Moreover, reducing the transfer from infected domestic dogs to stray dogs is more effective than decreasing domestic dogs that are abandoned. According to WHO, as long as victims bitten by animals receive proper PEP timely, human rabies can be prevented [98] . Fig. 3 .5 (c) indicates that the rabies infection rate can be reduced with the increase of using PEP. Thus, publicity and education on the risk and prevention of rabies is necessary and important to control the epidemic and should be strengthen in endemic areas, especially in rural areas. ",

Seasonally effective contact rate [78] , periodic changing in the birth rate [54] and vaccination program are often regarded as sources of periodicity. In this section, we take periodic transmission rate into account based on the following facts: (i) In the summer and fall, people wear light clothing and are lack of protection for the bites or scratches of dogs. Also, in summer and fall people, in particular farmers, have more frequent outdoor activities which increase chance of humandog interact. (ii) In these seasons, dogs are more maniacal and apt to attack each other and humans. (iii) From July to September schools are closed for summer vacations and children are out of supervision and enjoy tantalizing dogs. In fact, it was reported [84] that 25.7% of human rabies cases in China are students and unattended children. (iv) In addition, temperature may be related to the fluctuation of diseases. Under high temperature in summer, rabies virus can survive easily and its infectivity is stronger.",

The number of the initial susceptible human population at the end of 2003, S h (0), is obtained from the China Statistical Yearbook and the number of the initial infective humans I h (0) is from epidemiological bulletins published by the Chinese Ministry of Health.

We derive We observe that the data of 20 05, 20 08 and 20 09 are slightly different from the solution as observed in [113] . We think this is because of large scale culling of dogs in these years. However, culling of dogs is not considered in model (4.1) . We can also predict the general tendency of the epidemic in a long term according to the current situation, which is presented in Fig. 4 .2 . From these figures we can see that the epidemic of rabies can be relieved in a short time ( Fig. 4.2 (a) ), but cannot be eradicated with the current prevention and control measures ( Fig. 4.2 (b) ). Moreover, with these parameter values, we can roughly estimate that the basic reproduction number R 0 = 1 . 03 under the current circumstances in China.

From Fig. 4.4 (a) , it is obvious that when A is less then 226,890, R 0 can be less than 1. However, the annual birth population of dogs can achieve 40 0,0 0 0 or more in China. This indicates that human rabies in China cannot be eradicated if the birth number of dogs cannot be controlled under 2 million. The postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) is used for most situations for human rabies. In model (4.1) , it is embodied in the terms k and k h and it can affect \u03b3 and \u03b3 h . We observe that R 0 is a concave function of k from Fig. 4.4 (b) . So k has an obvious effect on R 0 . We also know that immunization is an effective measure to control rabies. Next, we consider the dependence of R 0 on \u03b3 and observe that it is linear in \u03b3 , which is depicted in Fig. 4.4 (c) . Most people, especially in the rural and remote areas, have little knowledge about rabies and even do not know what to do after being bitten by dogs. It was reported in [84] that 66.3% of rabies victims did not seek medical services at all and 27.6% of the cases received inadequate PEP. Although the effect of \u03b3 on R 0 is less than k , in order to decrease the rate of clinical outbreak to rabies we can enhance people the awareness and knowledge about rabies and the emergency measure and treatment after they are bitten and scratched by dogs. Now we discuss how a effects R 0 in Fig. 4.4 (d) . Although R 0 in linear in a \" a slight change of a can lead to large variations of R 0 . Since \u03b2(t) = a [1 + b sin ( \u03c0 6 t + 5 . 5)] = \u03bb 0 \u03b2 (N) \u03b2 /N, we can manage a by controlling \u03b2 (N) , i.e., the number of dogs a susceptible dog runs into per unit time, which is to strengthen the management of dogs, especially stray dogs, in case they run wild and bite each other and humans.",

Fig. 5.1 (a) shows that there were only 120 counties reporting human rabies cases in 1999. However, the number of infected counties in 2008 was nearly seven times as that in 1999. Moreover, we can see the tendency of rabies diffusion from Fig. 5.1 (b) . In 1996, the 160 infected cases were sporadically distributed in the south provinces. As time goes on, the situation of rabies in south provinces has become more serious and it has spread to central and north provinces. Now we want to explore the factors behind the spatial spread of rabies in Mainland China. There are some studies on investigating animals rabies and using partial differential equations by adding diffusion terms to ordinary differential equations. Kallen [47] studied rabies transmission in fox population by differential equations with diffusion. He used the deterministic model to simulate rabies epizootic in foxes crossing continental Europe and proved the existence of traveling waves. Murray et al. [63, 64] also considered foxes rabies, calculated the speed of propagation of the epizootic front and the threshold for the existence of an epidemic and quantified a mean to control the spatial spread of the disease. Artois et al. [7] employed a one-dimensional discrete deterministic model to analyze the evolution of a given population which is infected by rabies. Ou and Wu [69] considered the spatio-temporal patterns of rabies spread involving structured fox populations and delayed nonlocal interaction on the disease spread. See also Ruan and Wu [74] .",

For reactiondiffusion equations, the asymptotic speed and traveling waves are attracting more attention and usually need to be investigated and discussed in order to understand the dynamics. The concept of asymptotic speeds of spread was first introduced in [6] for reaction-diffusion equations. There is an intuitive interpretation for the spreading speed c * in a spatial epidemic model: if one runs at a speed c > c * , then one will leave the epidemic behind; whereas if one runs at a speed c < c * , then one will eventually be surrounded by the epidemic [21] . Following the method adopted by [56, 57] , we determine the minimum wave speed connecting the disease-free equilibrium to the endemic equilibrium and illustrate the existence of traveling waves by numerical simulations. In Section 2 it was shown that the endemic equilibrium of the ODE model (2.1) is stable. Here we study the diffusive model by linear analysis to see whether the endemic equilibrium is still stable and whether spatial patterns can appear. Moreover, we carry out some sensitivity analysis on parameters to determine factors that affect the spatial spread of rabies in Mainland China. , t ) , and R d ( x, t ) to denote the density of susceptible, exposed, infectious, and recovered dogs at location x and time t , respectively. The corresponding human sub-populations are denoted by S h ( x, t ), E h ( x, t ), I h ( x, t ), and R h ( x, t ), respectively. Suppose that the spatial diffusion of rabies is a result of the movement of dogs. So we add the diffusion of dogs to system (2.1) and ",

Moreover, from Fig. 5 .5 we can see that the diffusion of dogs not only spreads the disease to other adjacent areas but also makes the rabies situation more serious, which agrees with the fact that not only rabies has spread from the south to the central and north areas but also the situation of rabies in the south is getting more serious.",

In order to improve rabies control and prevention, in 2005 the Chinese government implemented a trial surveillance program to monitor rabies at the national level in an attempt to obtain a more comprehensive epidemiological dataset. In addition to recording statistics on human cases, the Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention of China CDC cooperated with the provincial CDC laboratories and began collecting samples from dog populations in regions where human rabies cases had been reported. The positive samples were then submitted for DNA sequencing and combined with a second subset of selected sequences from publicly available sequences. Yu et al. [108] selected a subset of samples for sequencing and investigated the history and origin of the virus in China and examined the variation from a geographical perspective. Guo et al. [36] used comprehensive spatial analysis methodology to describe the spatiotemporal variation of human rabies infections in China from 2005 to 2011, detected spatiotemporal clusters of human rabies, modeled the transmission trend of rabies, and provided a scientific basis for improved targeted human rabies control interventions in China. Guo et al. [37] collected rabies virus nucleoprotein gene sequences from different provinces and investigated their phylogenetic and phylogeographic relationship. More specifically, their phylogeographical analyses of two rabies virus clades (China I and China II) lineages identified several provinces that appear to be epidemiologically linked and China I lineage plays the dominant role in the spread of rabies in China. Moreover, their analysis indicates that east China appears to be not only epidemiologically related to adjoining provinces but also to distant provinces, and seems to act as an epidemic hub for transmission of rabies virus to other regions, which is consistent with previous results by Yu et al. [108] . Other long distance translocations of rabies virus can also be identified as well as translocation events between neighboring provinces. Their analysis demonstrates a strong epidemiological linkage between Shaanxi and Sichuan and between Sichuan and Yunnan. This is consistent with surveillance data for human rabies cases which show dissemination of the virus from southwest China to neighboring provinces and into regions such as Shaanxi in the northern part of the county that have previously been incident free for several years [106] . For both clades there appears to be a general trend of longitudinal transmission (Guangdong-Shandong, Fujian-Hebei, Zhejiang-Shandong) and latitudinal transmission (Yunnan-Shanghai, Guizhou-Shanghai, Hunan-Shanghai). That is also consistent with human rabies surveillance data which highlights a flow of cases from high incidence regions in the south of the country to medium and low incidence regions [106] . For example, discrete phylogeographic analysis for China I strain [37, 88, 89, 103, 108] indicates the linkage of rabies virus between Sichuan and Shaanxi, Guangxi and Guizhou, and Fujian and Hebei ( Fig. 6.1 ) .",

We will describe the model in details, discuss the existence of the disease-free equilibrium, calculate the basic reproduction number, and study how the moving rates between patches affect the basic reproduction number. To investigate the epidemiological linkage (such as Guizhou and Guangxi, Hebei and Fujian, and Sichuan and Shaanxi) observed in Guo et al.

Under this assumption the disease would die out in both provinces since their isolated basic reproduction numbers are less than one. This example theoretically shows the possibility that the immigration of dogs can lead the disease to a worse scenario even it could be eliminated in each isolated patch. It is remarkable that we only mentioned the dog immigration here because a simple observation to the formula of the basic reproduction number shows that only the immigration rates of dogs ( \u03c6 K i j for K = S, E, I, V ) can affect it. In fact, only dogs can carry the rabies virus and then spread it to humans and other dogs. This transmission feature supports our mathematical analysis. Furthermore, Fig. 6 .6 (b) shows a direct comparison of numerical simulations on the number of human cases from the model with immigration and without immi-gration. The additional green curve represents simulations of the human cases without any immigration in Hebei and the human infectious population size goes to zero faster which is consistent with the fact that the isolated basic reproduction number (0.5477) in Hebei is less than one.",

Particularly, the number of human deaths caused by rabies virus in Guangxi is ranked the highest in China. Similar simulations were carried out for these two provinces and results are shown in Fig. 6 .4 . The isolated basic reproduction numbers for Guizhou and Guangxi are calculated as R Guizhou 0 = 1 . 5998 and R Guangxi 0 = 6 . 1905 , respectively, while the basic reproduction number for the linked system is estimated to be R 0 = 4 . 9211 . To eliminate rabies we need some effective control strategies that can reduce R 0 significantly. Thus it is even more challenging to control and prevent the disease in Guangxi and Guizhou from a numerical perspective. In Fig. 6.6 (a) , we compare the human rabies in Guizhou having dog immigration with that having no dog immigration. It is obvious that if there is no dog immigration between Guizhou and Guangxi, the number of human rabies in Guizhou would be less than the reported numbers, and also much less than the simulation results with dog immigration.",

First, let (the immigration rate of dogs from patch 1 to patch 2) \u03c6 12 = 0 . 02 .

Furthermore, if \u03c6 21 is small and \u03c6 12 is large, R 0 is greater than both R 1 0 and R 2 0 . To reduce R 0 , we need to control \u03c6 12 small enough. For example, let \u03c6 21 = 0 . 5 , \u03c6 12 = 0 . 01 , then we obtain that R 0 < min {R 1 0 , R 2 0 } .

Some researches suggest that combining these methods can be more effective in controlling the rabies. For example, Hu et al.

However, the large-scale culling of dogs, criticized by pet owners and animal protection activists, is controversial and there is a lack of evidence of its effectiveness in controlling dog population or rabies [100] .

The sensitivity analysis of R 0 in terms of the model parameters and the comparison of the effects of culling and immunization of dogs demonstrate that (i) controlling dog birth rate and increasing dog immunization coverage rate are the most effective methods for controlling rabies in China; and (ii) large scale culling of susceptible dogs can be replaced by immunization of them.",

However, the dog immunization rate in China has yet reached 10%, which is even lower in the countryside [60] . So increasing dog vaccination coverage rate is necessary and crucial in control rabies transmission in China. We suggest decreasing the dog birth rate in order to reduce the dog population and stop culling dogs and try to vaccinate these dogs instead. For pet dogs, registration and immunization should be mandatory; the price of vaccine should be reduced; the awareness of prevention rabies for dog owners should be enhanced; and contraception measures should be taken.",

It was reported that at least 18.2% of the human rabies cases in Guangdong Province are caused by stray dogs [79] . In Section 3 , taking this fact into consideration and using rabies data from Guangdong Province, we proposed a SEIV model for the dog-human transmission of rabies in which both domestic and stray dogs are considered. By the analysis of the model, we concluded that the cases of rabies in Guangdong would decrease gradually in the next a few year and increase slightly afterward, which indicates that rabies cannot be controlled or eradicated under the current strategies. By carrying out some sensitivity analysis of the basic reproduction number in terms of various parameters, we found that the vaccination rate of domestic dogs, the recruitment rate of domestic dogs, the number of stray dogs and the valid time of the immunity play very important roles for the transmission of rabies. From Fig. 3.5 (a) , we can see that the acute infection in humans in Guangdong Province would be reduced evidently through the decrease of the stray dog population. Moreover, reducing the transfer from infected domestic dogs to stray dogs is more effective than decreasing domestic dogs that are abandoned. As shown in Fig. 3.4 (a) and Fig. 3.5 (b) , rabies can be controlled with the vaccination coverage rate over 75% which is a little bit higher than the recommended vaccination rate by WHO, the main reason is that a large number of stray dogs exists in most areas of Guangdong Province. However, from Fig. 3.5 (b) , although acute infection cases can be reduced by culling stray dogs, rabies cannot be eventually eradicated by this measure alone. Therefore, culling stray dogs is not a good strategy in controlling rabies. To prevent and control rabies in stray dogs, as suggested in Section 2 , fostering of stray dogs could be introduced and encouraged, food baits containing abortifacient oral vaccine in capsules could be distributed in order to reduce the stray dog population and vaccinate stray dogs.",

It should be pointed out that the latter is the reason that the basic reproduction number for rabies in China was estimated to be R 0 = 2 in Section 2 while it is estimated that R 0 = 1 . 65 for Guangdong Province in this section. Indeed, the human rabies cases increased continuously and dramatically in China from 1996 to 2006 and then started to decrease steadily (see Fig. 2 .2 ). In Section 3 we used the data from 2004 to 2010 for the whole country and it was estimated that the \"average\" basic reproduction number for China for this time period is R 1 = 1 . 25 .

Firstly, we calculated the basic reproduction number R 0 and analyzed the dynamics of the model including the global stability of the disease-free equilibrium and the existence of periodic solutions. We then used our model to simulate the monthly data on the number of infected human cases from January 2004 to December 2010 in China reported by the Chinese Ministry of Health and predicted the general tendency of disease in China.

The values of most parameters in our model were obtained from the literature or by assumptions.

From Fig. 2.2 , we can see that the numbers of infected human cases increased dramatically from 159 cases in 1996 and were fierce from 1996 to 2004. After 2004, the spread of rabies began to slow down. Moreover, the data in 2005 and after 2007 decreased. So the fact that R 0 in Section 4 is less than in Section 2 is reasonable.",

Moreover, we discussed the stability of the endemic equilibrium with diffusion to illustrate that the spatial pattern cannot appear. The key is to check the magnitude of influence of parameters on human rabies cases and the minimal wave speed c * . From the formula of c * , we can see that only d 2 , d 3 (= d 2 ) can influence c * , but d 1 , d 4 do not. Therefore, only the movement of exposed and infected dogs affects the spatial spread of rabies. From Fig. 5.6 (b) , we know that the influence of d 2 , d 3 on c * is larger which illustrates that quarantine of dogs during movement is important to control the spatial spread of rabies.",

The expression and sensitivity analysis of the basic reproduction number indicates that the movement of dogs plays an essential role in the spatial transmission of rabies. As mentioned in the previsous sections, reducing dog birth rate and increasing dog immunization coverage rate are the most effective methods in controlling human rabies infections in China. They also play important roles in controlling the spatial spread of rabies based on the multi-patch model. WHO recommends that 70% of dogs in a population should be immunized to eliminate the rabies. Unfortunately, this rate is still lower than 10% in most regions in China. Therefore, efforts to bring the awareness of the importance of treatments and enhance the vaccination coverage in dogs are important to control the disease in China.",

First of all, the immigration may lead a basic reproduction number to be larger than one even if the isolated basic reproduction numbers are all less than one. Therefore, the immigration of dogs is the main factor for the long-distance interprovincial spread of rabies. We note that the transportation of dogs even between non-endemic provinces, such as Fujian and Hebei, can cause human rabies in Hebei to increase greatly. Additionally, the movement of dogs from regions with a low vaccination rate also makes the situation worse. Attention should be paid not only to the provinces with more reported cases but also to the provinces with low vaccination rates. In those extremely poor areas, where dogs have a low vaccination coverage, the dog trade business and transportation to other areas will contribute to the geographical spread of rabies significantly. To control the disease at a national level, more effort s are needed in these regions.",

In some areas, such as the endemic provinces Guizhou and Guangxi, people eat dogs due to minority culture or harsh climate. There is no open market for selling and buying dogs for business purpose, however the black market always exists. It is frequently reported that trucks sometimes full of dogs are intercepted by animal lovers in the inter-provincial highway. Sometimes more than one thousand dogs were crammed into many tiny cages in one truck. The efficiency of such dog transportation has been enhanced by the fast development and expansion of the highway system in China in the past ten years. Chinese law requires that the transported animals must be certified as vaccinated for rabies and other diseases. However, dog traders are found to falsify the paperwork for most of the dogs in the truck to reduce their cost. Thus it would be important to regulate the market and implement certain policies on dogs (such as vaccine records) and the dog traders (such as licenses). During our research, we found that it was very difficult to find the information on dog population in China due to the lack of dog registration management. Since a large number of dogs are transported from provinces to provinces, it is necessary to register and manage such transportation properly. In particular, dogs carrying rabies viruses can easily spread the virus to other dogs when they are crowded into a small space during the trip. The last case of our sensitivity analysis shows the oblivious dangers resulted from the transportation of infectious dogs that has a destination with a low vaccination rate. We suggest creating strict and uniform procedures to test the dogs that will be transported.",
