These developments will also force Taiwan to respond by taking more active actions for the sole purpose of safeguarding its sovereignty and maritime jurisdiction in the SCS.

The co-operative actions taken in the SCS area could enhance mutual trust between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait. r",

Taiwan has also been barred from participating in the Track One regional security dialogue processes, such as the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF), which address security issues, including the SCS territorial disputes, confidence building measures (CBMs), and preventive diplomacy in the Asia-Pacific region.",

A committee will be set up by the two companies to help select parts of the waters in the SCS area where exploration for oil may be carried out. They also agreed to a program to ''review, assess and evaluate relevant geological, geophysical and other technical data available to determine the oil and gas potential in the area''. 4 This joint project is one of the most recent examples that exclude Taiwan from participation in the proposed cooperative activities in the SCS. Taiwan cannot but respond to the recent developments in the area by taking counter-actions. On August 18, 2003 , Taiwan's Interior Minister Yu Cheng-Hsien, on behalf of Premier Yu Shy-Kun, traveled to Taiping-Dao to reaffirm the nation's sovereignty over the Spratly Islands. 5 In late October 2003, Taiwan's coast guard personnel stationed on Taiping-Dao 6 drove Vietnamese fishing vessels away in the waters near the island. 7 It can be expected that more actions will be taken by Taiwan if both China and member states of the ASEAN keep ignoring Taiwan's territorial claims and fail to respect its legitimate right in the SCS area.",

The cross-strait relations and foreign relations between Taiwan and member states of ASEAN will also likely be affected. China is holding the key to Taiwan's involvement in the regional security dialogue process on the SCS issues and its participation in any of the proposed co-operative activities in the Spratly area between China and the ASEAN based on the guidelines underlined in the SCSCOP Declaration. It is suggested that China should consider the utility of taking a ''win-win-win-WIN'' approach to deal with the territorial and jurisdictional disputes in the SCS. It is believed that China, by adopting the approach, will gain (win), Taiwan likewise (win), and the ASEAN will also benefit from it (win). In the end, all parties concerned and the region as a whole will WIN. Not only will this approach help realize China's policy goal of ''setting aside sovereignty disputes, jointly develop the resources'' in the SCS, but also help promote peace, stability and prosperity in the region. The cross-strait relations could also be improved.",

The reef's Chinese name is Meiji Jiao; the Filipino name is Panganiban; and the Vietnamese calls it Vanh Khan. China and Vietnam also engaged in armed conflicts in the dispute over the ownership of the Paracel and Spratly Islands in the SCS in 1974 and 1988, respectively. 9 In response to China's enactment of its territorial sea law on February 25, 1992, in which China reaffirms its sovereignty over the Paracel Islands, the Spratly Islands, and other island in the SCS, and to China's signing a contract with the Denver-based US oil corporation Crestone on May 8, 1992 to explore oil and gas potential in the Spratly area, the foreign ministers of the member countries of the ASEAN issued the ASEAN Declaration on the South China Sea on July 22, 1992 , which urged all parties concerned to exercise restraint with view to creating a positive climate for the eventual resolution of all disputes. The declaration also asked the countries having directly interests in the area to explore the possibility of co-operation in the SCS relating to the safety of maritime navigation and communication, protection against pollution of the marine environment, coordination of search and rescue operations, efforts towards combating piracy and armed robbery as well as collaboration in the campaign against illicit trafficking in drugs. In addition, the declaration commended all parties concerned to apply the principles contained in the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation in Southeast Asia as the basis for establishing a code of international conduct over the SCS. For the text of the declaration, visit website of ASEAN at: http://www.aseansec.org/90.htm and http://www.aseansec.org/5038.htm. and to undertake co-operative activities in the SCS area. 10 The United States also responded to the increasing tensions in the SCS by issuing a strong official statement on the SCS on May 10, 1995, which inter alia urged all claimants to exercise restraint, to avoid destabilizing actions, and to intensify diplomatic efforts which address issues related to competing territorial and jurisdictional claims in the SCS [1] . On July 28, 1995, Vietnam became the seventh member state of the ASEAN. China's SCS policy during the second half of the 1990s had been influenced to a large extent by the actions taken by the United States, the ASEAN, admission of Vietnam to the organization, and the increasing importance of ASEAN market to China's foreign trade development.",

            "text": "It is observed that China began to calculate carefully the costs it had to bear and the benefits it could gain between the policy options of taking a much more aggressive stand, such as occupying new reefs or constructing new structures on the islands it occupies in the SCS area, or undertaking co-operative activities with the member states of the ASEAN in the future. The increasing US involvement in the SCS area through strengthening military co-operation with member states of the ASEAN, such as the Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand, and the increasing frequency of joint military exercises conducted at sea between the United States and member states of the ASEAN, which was interpreted by the Chinese scholars and officials as a change of US SCS policy, moving from a position of neutral to active concerns, are believed to have important impacts on the direction of China's SCS policy. The development pushed the Chinese policy makers to move further toward adopting a diplomatic co-operative approach when the SCS issues are to be tackled with. The Asian financial crisis of 1997-1998 reinforced this policy choice of China. 11 In 1997, China and the ASEAN issued a joint statement, in which the two sides reaffirmed the principles of peaceful settlement of disputes in the SCS, agreed to resolve their disputes in the SCS through friendly consultations and negotiations in accordance with universally recognized international law, including the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, and agreed that the concerned countries should exercise self-restraint and to explore ways for cooperation in the SCS. 12 On December 28, 1999, at the informal ASEAN-China summit, Zhu Rongji, Premier of China, stated that China would continue to render support to and co-operate with member states of ASEAN in regional and international organizations such as the ARF, the UN, and others. He also said that China would increase multilateral and bilateral security dialogue and consultations and made joint efforts for the establishment of a new just and reasonable international political, economic and security order. 13 As far as the SCS issues are concerned, the Chinese premier stressed that China will, as always, adhere to the principles and spirit of the China-ASEAN Joint Statement signed in 1997 and resolve its differences and disputes with ASEAN countries through friendly consultations and peaceful means. China appreciated the purposes and spirit of the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation in Southeast Asia and will continue to support ASEAN in its efforts to establish a zone of peace, freedom and neutrality and a Southeast Asia Nuclear Weapon Free Zone.",

Taiwan's participation in the regional security, political, economic, or technical talks on the SCS issues will also be affected by the recent agreements done between the member states of ASEAN and China, and the follow-up activities. As a result, Taiwan will be further marginalized in any serious consultations or negotiations over the SCS issues in the future. The recent development in the SCS will also turn Taiwan's policy regarding ''temporarily shelving the sovereignty disputes in order to explore ways of jointly developing, managing and policing the SCS'' into empty words, with no possibility of being implemented. Taiwan will continuously be excluded from the regional dialogue over the adoption of a code of conduct in the SCS. On the other hand, if indeed the co-operative activities were carried out in the areas also claimed by Taiwan, and thereafter oil reserves for example were found, Taiwan would be forced to take actions to defend its sovereignty and maritime interests in the SCS.

Most of the participants were Chinese scholars, but four representatives from Taiwan were also invited to attend the meeting. Around 38 papers on a variety of issues related to the SCS were presented. Among them, Zhao Enbo, the then Section Chief of Office of Laws and Regulations at the State Oceanic Administration, presented a paper entitled ''Prospects for Cross-strait Cooperation in the Spratly Islands'' in which he called upon both sides of the Taiwan Strait to promote cooperation in the areas of marine scientific research, marine weather forecasting, marine fisheries, search and rescue at sea, and even military co-operation such as conducting alternative naval patrols in the Spratly archipelago area. He listed three bases for the proposed cross-strait cooperation in the SCS: (1) the consensus on the ownership of the Spratly Islands; (2) common actions taken against other claimants in the SCS; and (3) the efforts made to safeguard the sovereignty of the Spratly Islands. In addition, he stressed that any implementation of the cross-strait co-operation on the SCS issues must be guided by the principle of ''peaceful re-unification, and one country two systems''. 33 Hu Chizi, a participant from Taiwan, called for crossstrait co-operation to develop fisheries resources in the Spratly Islands by setting up a fisheries base on Itu Aba Island [5] .",

Ten scholars came from Mainland China, each of them presented a paper on different topics related to the SCS, including China's legal claim, historical evidence, archaeology, marine environmental protection, marine scientific research, research institutions, assessment and exploitation of oil and gas resources, marine fisheries, and shipping and navigation. It was understood that both Taiwan and China at that time considered the need to strengthen the cross-strait co-operation in the SCS area.",

Helping to bring about national unification should be the common responsibility of all Chinese people''. 34 In addition, under Taiwan's SCS Policy Guidelines, adopted in April 1993, one of the policy implementing actions to be taken is to support the Guidelines for National Unification by studying and setting up relevant policy and plans, and studying the matters relevant to the SCS issues that involve both sides of the Taiwan Strait [6] . 35 At the 1994 Cross-Strait and Oversea Chinese Academic Symposium, Lin Chin-Tz, a senior researcher from Xiamen University, proposed to consider the possibility of cross-strait co-operation on compiling the historical literature in relation to the SCS, inviting scholars to participate in the joint compilation project, and exchange data or research findings/results [7] . Wang Henjei, a professor from the Central National University, called for setting up a general academic structure to be in charge of the responsibility for coordinating the SCS research works done by scholars in Taiwan, China, Macau, and Hong Kong [8] . Du Bilan, the Chinese participant from the State Oceanic Administration, proposed to organize a cross-strait co-operative research project on environmental and ecological studies in the SCS [9] .

Suddenly the organizing committee was informed that all of the invited Chinese participants decided to cancel their trip to Taiwan. The main reason for the cancellation obviously was President Lee Teng-hui's visit to Cornell University in the United States in June 1995. After the visit, the cross-strait relations deteriorated. The tension in the Taiwan Strait area was escalated and reached to the peak in March 1996, when China decided to ''test-fire'' its missiles in the water areas near Taiwan's two largest sea ports, Keelung in the north and Kaohsiung in the south, to intimidate Taiwan and therefore influence the outcome of the presidential election. The deteriorating relations between Taiwan and China made it impossible for the cross-strait exchange of views on the SCS issues to be continued.",

Ma Yin listed three changes she observed: (1) President Lee's government is taking a position not to co-operate with China on the Spratly issues; (2) Taiwan gives up the sovereignty claims in the historical waters within the SCS; and (3) Taiwan intends to invite the United States and Japan to involve in the SCS issues. 38 She interpreted the changes as Taiwan's strategy to split China, move to independence, and to break the international political myth of ''One China''. Therefore, she suggested that China should take actions to disclose and criticize President Lee's ''Two States Statement'', and prevent his goal of splitting China from becoming a reality. In addition, China should urge Taiwanese authority to consider and respect the interest of the Chinese people and insist on the principle of ''One China''.",

At the Sanya SCS meeting, the Chinese participants raised their great concerns over Taiwan's move to replace its marines stationed on the Taiping Dao (Itu Aba) with personnel from the Coast Guard Administration. According to a report prepared by the Institute of Ocean Development and Strategy Institute, which is under China's State Oceanic Administration, the Taiwanese move was interpreted as another practice of President Lee's ''Two States Statement''. It is also believed that the move was taken for the strategic purpose of differentiating Taiwan SCS policy from China's and was an important indicator of Taiwan's adjustment of its security strategy. It is also stated in the report that Taiwan's move in the Spratly Islands would have the potential to make the situation in the SCS more complicated and to weaken China's overall safeguarding strength in the SCS area. 39 In December 2001, the Cross-Strait SCS Issues Exchange and Co-operation Academic Dialogue Meeting was held in Tao-Yuan, Taiwan. Around 16 Taiwanese and 6 Chinese scholars and governmental officials attended the meeting. One of the major issues discussed was cross-strait co-operation on the SCS issues. It was proposed in a paper prepared by Taiwanese participant Chung-Young Chang, Professor at Central Police University, that at the non-governmental level, the two sides of the Taiwan Strait may (1) study the possibility of setting up a permanent, institutional co-operative mechanism and exchange channel to help ordinate those research institutions, universities or graduate schools that are involving in the SCS research; (2) encourage the private research ARTICLE IN PRESS 36 ''Let the Chinese People in the 21st Century Understand [the Importance] of the Spratly Islands,'' paper presented at the meeting, in Chinese. 37 ''Spratly Disputes and the Policy Measures that Should be Adopted by Our Government,'' paper presented at the meeting, in Chinese. 38 ''The Changing Attitudes of Taiwanese Authority on the Spratly Islands and its Impact on the Situation of the SCS,'' paper presented at the meeting, in Chinese. institutions, public interest groups, or professional associations to conduct the SCS-related research; and (3) encourage and assist the relevant industries or private institutions to co-operate and jointly to conduct investigation, exploration, and development of the SCS resources [16] . At the governmental level, he suggested, the agencies of the two sides of the Taiwan Strait in charge of marine affairs and the SCS issues (1) should go through academic units, research institutions or associations to establish the cross-strait linkage, working relations; (2) should consider establishing a joint patrol mechanism in the SCS to help maintain safety of navigation at sea, maintain fisheries order, protect marine ecological conservation, and prevent smuggling, drug trafficking, and illegal activities at sea; and (3) should provide funds, through foundations or academic institutions, to support and encourage the proceeding of the cross-strait co-operative project on the SCS issues and to help increase the awareness of the people on the importance of the SCS issues [16, p. 6] .",

However, before setting up the co-operative mechanism, Lee Guochang suggested, the two sides of the Taiwan should consider the areas and scope of the co-operation and exchange of views. The scientific research and economic development areas should be included in the cross-strait co-operation. But more importantly, communication is first needed [17] . Chen Hungyu pointed out that at this current stage, there are difficulties for the cross-strait co-operation on the SCS issues at the governmental level [18] . Zhou Chonghai stated in his paper that the objective for the cross-strait co-operation is to promote peaceful reunification and to safeguard national rights and interests. The basis for this cooperation is ''One Country Two Systems, and Peaceful Unification''. He listed the following possible direction, scope and concrete items for the cross-strait cooperation on the SCS issues: (1) to ensure China's ownership over the islands in the SCS area in accordance with international law; (2) to discuss and prove the status of the SCS in accordance with international law and international law on recognition; (3) to empower China's rights and fulfill its obligations in the SCS in accordance with the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea; (4) to proceed with research and co-operation on the fisheries preservation, protection, development and utilization in the SCS area; (5) to proceed with co-operation on marine scientific research; and (6) to study the possibility of joint exploitation of oil resources in the SCS. The approach taken should include three steps: making the co-operative plan, setting up a co-operative fund, and then establishing a coordination mechanism [19] .",

Two representatives from Taiwan were invited to attend the meeting. It is clear that the idea of setting up a cross-strait SCS forum had been approved before by the Chinese government in Beijing, since a copy of draft by-law for the cross-strait SCS forum was prepared for discussions at the special meeting. In fact, the main purpose of the meeting, as decided by the host Hainan SCS Research Institute, was to adopt the by-law that will govern the operation of the cross-strait SCS forum if established.",

The secretariat is also in charge of issuing news release, organizing the forum's preparatory meetings, coordinating with the countersecretariat across the strait to draft or amend the by-law, and to raise funds for the forum activities. 41 The forum meetings will be held alternatively in Hainan and Taiwan without fixed dates. The two secretariats, after obtaining the permission from the authors, could either respectively or jointly publish the papers delivered at the meeting. 42 The two secretariats of the forum may accept financial support from contributors to cover the expenses for daily administrative works and hosting of academic symposia, but no conditions considered inconsistent with the goals of setting up the Cross-Strait SCS Forum should be attached for the financial contributions. 43 Due to the fact that the two Taiwanese representatives were not instructed to talk about the adoption of the by-law, in addition to several political and administrative concerns raised by Taiwan's counter- institute, National Chengchi University thereafter, the idea for setting up the cross-strait SCS forum remains a matter to be discussed between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait at other meetings. 44",

            "text": "Over the past 12 years, as mentioned in the review done earlier, quite a few new and old ideas that advocated the cross-strait co-operation on the SCS issues have indeed been raised by scholars from Taiwan and China, in particular, at the cross-strait SCS academic symposia held in two sides of the Taiwan Strait. However, it is noticed that most of the recommended items for the co-operation fall in the category of ''low politics'', which call for cross-strait cooperation in the areas of marine scientific research, marine environmental protection, combating piracy, armed robbery, and illegal activities at sea, exploration and development of natural resources, and other technical and functional matters. Table 3 summarizes the areas for the cross-strait co-operation on the SCS issues that have been proposed over the last decade or so. Table 3 demonstrates that no items for the crossstrait co-operation on the SCS issues are considered ''high politics'' matters. The Taiwanese scholars and governmental officials have been asking for participation in the regional Track One security dialogue mechanisms that also deal with the SCS issues. But China insists on the exclusion of Taiwan from the process because of the concern over the risk of helping upgrade Taiwan's international status. China, for instance, has been blocking Taiwan's involvement in the process of developing a regional code of conduct in the SCS. Even though it is a Track Two dialogue mechanism, China has been adopting the same strategy to block Taiwan's proposal for hosting technical or group of expert meetings on technical matters such as shipping and safety of navigation in the SCS. In fact, Taiwan is the only participating party in the SCS Workshop process that has never had the chance to host TWG or GEM meetings (see Table 4 ). Why so? Again, because China is worried about the risk of upgrading or strengthening the diplomatic relations between Taiwan and member states of the ASEAN, which is interpreted by the policy makers in Beijing as a violation of the principle of ''One China''. There is no possibility for the proposed areas of SCS co-operation being accepted if they are considered not abiding by the principle of ''One Country, Two Systems'' or ''One China, Joint Development''. Indeed there exist several major obstacles to the implementation of the cross-strait cooperation in the SCS, which are unlikely to be overcome in the near future. As pointed out by Professor Steven Kuan-Tshy Yu, the insistence on the principle of ''One China'' by China and Taiwan's being forced to adopt a strategy of ''pragmatic diplomacy'' to counter China's diplomatic blockade are the main barriers to any ideas of crossstrait co-operation in the SCS [20] . From the perspective of Taiwan, if Taipei co-operates closely with Beijing government in the SCS, its foreign policy goal of improving diplomatic relations with member states of the ASEAN would then be jeopardized. Professor Hung-Yu Chen listed a number of obstacles to the improvement of cross-strait relations and the implementation of co-operative projects in the SCS area, which include: (1) ideological differences between the two sides; (2) limitation on contact between the Taiwanese and Chinese officials; (3) China's political and military intervention in Taiwan's domestic politics and presidential election; (4) China's misinterpretation of the consensus reached between Beijing and Taipei in Singapore in 1991; (5) China's successful attempt to prevent Taiwan from attending the APEC summit held in Shanghai in October 2001; (6) the co-operation on SCS issues involving the sensitive issue of sovereignty; and (7) actions taken by China to prevent Taiwan from participating in the regional and international security dialogues [21] . Chung-Young Chang also stated in his paper presented at the 2001 Cross-trait SCS Issues Exchange and Co-operation Academic Dialogue Meeting that if Taiwan adopts a position identical with China's, it would not only alienate its bilateral diplomatic relations from the member states of the ASEAN, but also imply Taiwan's acquiesce in the principle of ''One China'', which, as a result, would make its sovereign status and independent entity subject to doubt [22] . Wen-Chen Lin argued that China's military threat against Taiwan is the major obstacle to the cross-strait co-operation in the SCS. China's diplomatic suppression also makes it impossible for Taiwan to trust China on the SCS issues. How can Taiwan co-operate with China if Beijing continues to impose embargo against Taiwan's proposal to host TWG or GE meetings within the Track Two framework of SCS Workshop? [23] . Kuen-Chen Fu called for a cross-strait co-operation on the SCS issues based on equality and listed the following difficulties in the crossstrait co-operation on the SCS issues: (1) shortage of financial support from the governments in Taiwan and China; (2) Taiwan's being discriminated by China without fair treatment; and (3) both Taiwan and China are concerned about the reaction of the member states of ASEAN to the cross-strait co-operation in the SCS [24] .",

But, on the contrary, it can be argued that the development of a closer cross-strait co-operative relationship between Taipei and Beijing could also help improve Taiwan's bilateral relations with the member states of the ASEAN. As a result of improvement of the cross-strait relations in the SCS, Taiwan might be invited to participate in the proposed joint projects between China and member states of the ASEAN based on the guidelines underlined in the 2002 SCSCOP Declaration, provided that flexible arrangements are found and accepted by the parties concerned.

As a result, it would become less necessary for China to apply the ''One China'' principle to the cross-strait relations and its foreign relations with member states of the ASEAN in a rigid manner as it did before. In short, a win-winwin-WIN approach should be considered seriously for adoption by the Chinese policy makers, in particular if the cross-strait co-operation in the SCS are at issues. Flexible arrangements and other creative measures, reflected in the practice of international governmental organizations such as APEC, WTO, WCPFC, and others, could be followed to help promote cross-strait co-operation in the SCS area.",

            "text": "As a matter of fact, Taipei and Beijing has been cooperating on the issue of oil and gas exploration in the Taiwan Strait and northern part of the SCS area since the early 1990s. In December 1992, for instance, authorities in Hainan province of China proposed joint exploitation of natural resources in the SCS with Taiwan. In addition, some investors from Taiwan also proposed the establishment of a ''South China Sea Development Funds'' for joint fishing and crude oil exploration in the area of the sea not involved in sovereignty disputes with Vietnam and other member states of the ASEAN. 45 In October 1994, two state-run oil companies from China and Taiwan met in Singapore to discuss the possibility of joint oil exploration in the East China Sea and SCS. 46 In July 1996, Taiwan and China finally agreed their first ever upstream joint venture with the signing in Taipei of a 2-year exploration and surveying accord for acreage in the SCS [25] . In 1998, it was also reported that China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC) and Taiwan's Chinese Petroleum Corporation (CPC) would begin a joint oilexploration project in the SCS in August of that year. 47 In May 2003, Taiwan's CPC and China's CNOOC agreed to postpone their joint wildcat drilling program in the SCS block as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) continued to ravage the Greater China region [26] . In addition to the cross-strait co-operation on oil exploration, the two sides have also been co-operating on the maritime safety measures. In November 1997, the Taipei-based China Rescue Association and its mainland counterpart, the China Marine Rescue Center, agreed to set up a hotline to facilitate marine rescue work in the Taiwan Strait. Under the agreement, when marine accidents occur, involving vessels from Taiwan and China, the vessels in distress and the rescuing vessels may use the hotline to ask for help and request permission to enter the waters and harbors of the other side. 48 It was also reported in February 1998 that the border defense corps of Fujian Province of China would explore channels with Taiwan for jointly maintaining cross-strait security and co-operation. 49 Allen, a senior associate in the CBM project at the Henry L. Stimson Center, concluded in his study of military CBMs across the Taiwan Strait that ''it is unlikely there will be any significant movement toward military CBMs across the Taiwan Strait until there is movement on political issues [27] ''. This is also true for the movement of cross-strait co-operation in the SCS area. As pointed out by Allen, two of the most important CBMs in the cross-strait relations are: (1) the unilateral declaration made by Beijing, promising not to use force to reunify Taiwan with the mainland; and (2) the announcement made by Taiwan not to declare independence [27, p. 131 ]. While President Chen Shui-bian made his ''Four Nos'' commitments during his 2000 inaugural speech, pledging that during his term in office, he would not declare independence, not change the national title, not push for the inclusion of the socalled ''state-to-state'' description in the Constitution, and not promote a referendum to change the status quo in regards to the question of independence or unification, China has never renounced its policy to use force against Taiwan. It should be noted that the ''Four Nos'' commitments were made under the pre-condition of ''rapprochement, co-operation and peace''. But clearly the policy makers in Beijing do not trust President Chen. The recent move made by China to block Taiwan's efforts to join the World Health Organization (WHO) in May 2003 generated a series of counter-measures adopted by Taiwan, in particular, advocating a ''referendum'' to join the WHO and revising its Constitution.",

Under the current situation, it seems remote for the realization of the establishment of a closer relationship between Taiwan and China on the SCS issues. However, it is likely that the cross-strait relations would move toward a different direction when the presidential election ends in March 2004. While it is still subject to debates, it seems that the chance for the cross-strait co-operation on the SCS issues would be bigger if the Pan-Blue camp wins the election. If the Pan-Green camp wins the election, however, the possibility for adopting CBMs between Taiwan and China in the SCS area can never be ruled out either, given the fact that President Chen might renew his call for rapprochement and co-operation with China. Accordingly, the following declaration, communications, transparency, and constraint CBMs are listed for consideration by the policy makers in Beijing and Taipei: * Exchange of visits by scholars and retired military officer to the occupied Pratas Islands (Taiwan), Paracel Islands (China) , and Spratly Islands (Taiwan and China) in the SCS. * Declaration of not use of force or not threat to use force against each either in the SCS area. * Exchange of monitoring information on activities taken by other claimants in the area of the sea in the SCS that are also claimed by Taiwan and China. * Setting up hotlines or notification mechanism to assist stationed military and coast guard personnel in the occupied islands and fishermen operating in the claimed waters in maritime rescue. * Pre-notification, on voluntary basis, of the military exercises to be conducted in the SCS area. * Avoidance of entering the waters or flying over the zones in the SCS, that are considered by each other as sensitive in terms of security and military defense. * Inviting national security academics and retired military personnel to attend the cross-strait SCS conferences held either in Taiwan or China for discussions on SCS issues. * Dispatching national security academics and military personnel to attend international meetings on the SCS issues. * Setting up a cross-strait SCS academic forum that is based on the principle of equality. * Organizing friendship sports games on the occupied Spratly Islands in the SCS. * Conducting cross-strait anti-piracy, anti-maritime terrorism, and search and rescue joint exercises in the SCS areas. * Encouraging member states of the ASEAN to invite Taiwanese scholars and governmental officials to attend regional Track One or Track Two SCS dialogues; at the same time, discouraging Taiwan's attempt to take advantage of the chance to participate to achieve other political and diplomatic goals. * Making a flexible arrangement to allow Taiwan to participate in the process of developing a regional code of conduct in the SCS. * Finding a way to enable Taiwan to participate in the joint projects to be implemented in the SCS in accordance with the guidelines underlined in the 2002 SCSCOP.",

The cooperative actions taken in the SCS area could enhance mutual trust between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait. If China and member states of the ASEAN can reach agreements to move from confrontation to co-operation in the SCS area, there are more reasons to believe that Taiwan and China should do the same thing. The CBMs suggested in the paper are welcomed to be considered seriously by the policy makers of the two sides of the Taiwan Strait. It is believed that the adoption of the proposed CBMs will not only help improve the crossstrait relations, but also assist in maintaining stability and peace in the Taiwan Strait and the SCS areas. All of the people in the region would benefit from the adoption of the proposed ''win-win-win-WIN approach'' by China as urged in this paper.",

No scholars or governmental officials from Taiwan, Vietnam and China were invited to attend the first SCS Workshop. However, at the end of the meeting, the possibility of organizing an informal meeting between individuals from ASEAN countries, Vietnam, China, and Taiwan was discussed and believed to do so as soon as possible.
