This study expands on previous research by performing a prospective evaluation of RT-PCR/ESI-MS to detect and identify Influenza A and B viruses compared to Prodesse ProFlu Plus and combined ProFlu Plus and Cepheid Xpert Flu. ProFlu Plus was also used as a gold standard for comparison for respiratory syncytial virus detection. Using ProFlu Plus as a gold standard, RT-PCR/ESI-MS had sensitivity and specificity of 82.1% (23/28) and 100% (258/258), respectively, for Influenza A, 100% (16/16) and 99.6% (269/270), respectively for Influenza B, and 88.6% (39/44) and 99.6% (241/242) for any Influenza virus. Using matching results from ProFlu Plus and Xpert Flu as a gold standard, RT-PCR/ESI-MS had 85.2% (23/27) and 100% (259/259) sensitivity and specificity respectively for Influenza A, 100% (14/14) and 99.6% (270/272), respectively for Influenza B virus. Overall, RT-PCR/ESI-MS was not as sensitive as the combined gold standard of ProFlu Plus and Xpert Flu, although it has the capability of detecting other respiratory viruses.",

Briefly, reverse transcription PCR electro-spray ionization mass spectrometry (RT-PCR/ESI-MS) is a commercially developed (Ibis Biosciences, San Diego, CA, United States) technology that analyzes PCR products via mass spectrometry and produces accurate base pair compositions of generated PCR products. The base pair compositions of the PCR products are plotted in three dimensional space and compared against a database of known organisms. Organism identifications are made based on alignment of base pair compositions of PCR products with base pair compositions of known organisms. Based on the ability of the technology to detect and identify viruses, bacteria and fungi on one platform, it is a potentially flexible and useful approach to detect and identify pathogens from clinical samples. Additional evaluations have been performed with broad respiratory virus primers for RT-PCR/ESI-MS via Respiratory Virus Surveillance (RVS) kits (Ibis Biosciences, San Diego, CA, United States) v2.0-2.5, which detect Influenza A and B viruses, Respiratory syncytial virus, Coronaviruses, Adenoviruses, Metapneumovirus and Parainfluenza Virus 1-3, with various gold standard assays (Chen et al., 2011a,b; Forman et al., 2012; Hardick et al., 2014) .",

(2012) and Hardick et al. (2014) , as this study primarily evaluated Influenza detection capability with RVS 2.5. Previous evaluations compared conventional viral culture methods and direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) (Chen et al., 2011a,b) , or xTag RVP and DFA or to xTag RVP alone (Forman et al., 2012) . Additionally, previous studies used archived nasopharyngeal swabs (Chen et al., 2011a,b; Hardick et al., 2014) or prospective pediatric samples (Forman et al., 2012) while this study analyzed prospective nasopharyngeal swabs from exclusively adult emergency department patients, and compared RT-PCR/ESI-MS performance to two molecular diagnostic methods.",
