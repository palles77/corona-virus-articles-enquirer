In growing cells, the vesicles are present at the normal growth temperature of 23 ~ However, at 16 ~ vesicle accumulations occur. Golgi apparatus of non-growing cells exhibited both larger numbers of vesicles and larger dictyosomes at all temperatures. In non-growing cells, vesicle numbers also were increased at 16~ The 16 ~ block was reconstituted in a cell-free system using Golgi apparatusand endoplasmic reticulum-enriched fractions prepared from suspension cultures. When incubated in the presence of ATP and cytosol, transitional endoplasmic reticulum fragments of Micrasterias responded by formation of membrane blebs and vesicles resembling those seen in situ. When prepared from cells metabolically labeled with [3H]leucine, the isolated transition elements supported the transfer of radioactivity to Golgi apparatus preparations immobilized on nitrocellulose strips. The transfer was time-and temperaturedependent and stimulated by ATP. The ATP-dependent component of transfer expressed at 23 ~ was reduced or absent at temperatures of 16 ~ or below. This suggested that membrane transfer mediated by transition vesicles was the same rate-limiting step in endoplasmic reticulum to Golgi apparatus membrane trafficking both in situ and in the cell-free system. Growth, as evidenced by a progressively altered Micrasterias morphology, was slowed at low temperatures but showed no abrupt temperature transition as seen with_ the vesicular traffic between the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus.",

B Non-growing cell in which the dictyosome was approximately twice the diameter of those of growing cells. Bar: 0.5 lam 70 nm vesicles per cross sectional area of the correct size and location to be transition vesicles. These vesicles appeared to bleb from the part-rough, part-smooth transitional regions of the endoplasmic reticulum and migrate to and fuse with peripheral membranes of cisternae at the cis face of the dictyosomes. In the non-growing cells, most of the stacked cisternae of dictyosomes were located near the surface of the chloroplast. The dictyosomes consisted typically of stacks of eleven or twelve cisternae, about 3.7 gm, in diameter ( Fig. 1 B) . A lamella ofendoplasmic reticulum was usually located between each dictyosome and the chloroplast. The region of endoplasmic reticulum-dictyosome interface contained, on average, 8 to 13 of the 50-70 nm transition vesicles per cross sectional area. In cells which had been cultured at 8 ~ to 37 ~ for 1 h, the morphology of the dictyosome was similar at all temperatures to that observed at the normal culture temperature of 23 ~ (Fig. 1) . However, after culture at 4 *C, most dictyosomes were distorted. Normal appearing cisternae of dictyosomes of growing cells cultured at 4 ~ were few. In their place were large swollen vesicles (Fig. 2 A) . The swollen cisternae were visible at 8 ~ but were less frequent than at 4\"C. In nongrowing cells at 4 ~ the distortion was represented by a characteristic curvature of the cisternae (Fig. 2 B) . About 4-6 trans cisternae were curved outward toward the trans pole and the remaining cis cisternae were curved in the opposite direction toward the cis side. The trans curvature may occur first, since dictyosomes which consisted of flattened cis cisternae sometimes were observed only with curved trans cisternae.

The endoplasmic reticulum was well developed with numerous ribosomes at all temperatures. When cells were incubated at different temperatures, the number of transition vesicles per dictyosome increased with increasing temperature to an optimum at 16~ (Fig. 3) . At temperatures greater then 16 ~ the numbers of vesicles declined abruptly to a constant value near that observed at the normal growth temperature of 23 ~ in growing cells. The decline of the number of Although there were approximately twice the number of transition vesicles per median dictyosome cross section for non-growing cells, the dictyosomes were of twice the diameter so that the average number of transition vesicles per unit cisternal diameter was very similar in growing and non-growing cells.",

The occurrence of transition vesicles derived from endoplasmic reticulum and their fusion with the Golgi apparatus were noted early in the pioneering studies of Drawert and Mix (1962) and Kiermayer (1970) . Our findings of a low temperature block in transition vesicle function offer an opportunity for investigation of the role of transition vesicles in membrane transfer between the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus as with animal cells (Tooze etal. 1984 (Tooze etal. , 1988 Tartakoff 1986 ) and tissues (Morr6 etal. 1989 ). Additional evidence for a low temperature compartment was provided from studies with virus-infected cells (Tooze etal. 1984 (Tooze etal. , 1988 . The accumulation of transition vesicles at temperatures of 16 *C or below is interpreted as the production of vesicles at these low temperatures but their failure to migrate to and fuse with the Golgi apparatus.",

            "text": "Reduced temperature has been shown to affect posttranslational processing and secretion in a number of cell systems. Evidence for a low temperature compartment was first provided for transport and secretion in pancreatic ascinar cells by Tartakoff (1986) . Tartakoff (1986) demonstrated that at 10 ~ secretory proteins of the exocrine pancreas accumulated in pre-Golgi apparatus transition vesicles, while at temperatures of 22 ~ or greater, these proteins progressed through the Golgi appartus and into condensing vacuoles. Histamine secretion from mast cells also decreased markedly at temperatures below 18 ~ (Lagunoff and Wan 1974) . Secretion of IgM and the appearance of HLA-1 on the cell surface decreased gradually in lymphoid cells as the temperature was reduced from 37 ~ to 20 ~ but no intracellular accumulation was observed (Brand et al. 1985) , With hepatic cells, secretory proteins were blocked in a pre-Golgi apparatus compartment at 18 ~ but at 20 ~ these proteins were exocytosed normally (Fries and Lindstrom 1986) . This was similar to rat pancreatic cells where, at 16 ~ most of the labeled secretory proteins remained in the endoplasmic reticulum while at 20~ the medial Golgi region was reached (Saraste et al. 1986 ). These and other data, especially with the intracellular transport and surface expression of proteins in virusinfected cells (Copeland et al. 1988; Griffiths et al. 1985; Holmes etal. 1981; Matlin and Simons 1983; Saraste and Kuismanen 1984; Tooze etal. 1984 Tooze etal. , 1988 has led to the concept of a pre-Golgi apparatus compartment. This pre-Golgi apparatus compartment would differ from the bulk of the endoplasmic reticulum and would presumably be located in the secretory pathway between the transitional endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus. Despite the considerable evidence for the existence of such a compartment based on the interruption of processing and transport of secretory and membrane proteins, the data on the morphological identification of such an intermediate compartment in uninfected cells are still limited and somewhat conflicting. Local increases in lamellar rough endoplasmic reticulum as reported by Meindl (1990) for Micrasterias denticulata treated at 7 ~ for 2 h were observed as well in the present study but not quantitated. The functional relationship between the low temperature block and reduced transfer from transitional endoplasmic reticulum to Golgi apparatus in Micrasterias was provided from a reconstituted cell-free system involving these cell compartments. In the reconstituted cell-free system, fragments of the transitional endoplasmic reticulum were induced to form vesicles by incubation with ATP, and ATP-regenerating system and cytosol. When prepared from cells radiolabeled with [3H]leucine, the transition elements supported the transfer of radiolabeled membrane constituents to acceptor Golgi apparatus immobilized on nitrocellulose.",
