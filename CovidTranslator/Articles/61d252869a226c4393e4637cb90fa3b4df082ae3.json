One to two Canadians are reported to die each year due to delayed diagnosis or treatment of malaria, 2 and many more become critically unwell and require admission to intensive care. 3 However, most febrile returned travellers will have more benign aetiologies, such as traveller's diarrhoea (TD) or respiratory tract infections; 1 4 yet there is no standardised 'system' for close follow-up and monitoring of such patients in the critical first few days of their illness, when deterioration may occur or a serious diagnosis may declare itself. Thus, many patients are either admitted to hospital for observation, or are discharged from the ED with ambulatory infectious diseases follow-up, days to weeks later. This gap in care translates into overutilisation of acute care, such as the ED and general medicine inpatient service, and also leads to underprovision of care for those who present early in their potentially serious illness with more benign appearing clinical parameters. 5 National Canadian guidelines on the assessment of febrile returned travellers have been published, 6 and we have adapted these guidelines into an ED decision-algorithm to standardise the evaluation and disposition of such patients, through creation of the 'Rapid Assessment of Febrile Travelers' (RAFT) Programme. The RAFT algorithm triages patients to either hospital admission, in the case of unstable vital signs, significant laboratory derangements, volume depletion or Plasmodium falciparum malaria, or to same-day referral to the RAFT Clinic in the Tropical Disease Unit (TDU) of Toronto General Hospital, if patients fail to fulfil admission criteria (figure 1). In addition, the RAFT algorithm provides management advice and diagnostic stewardship to the participating EDs. The RAFT Programme aims to fill the identified care gap and, in the process, improves patient flow, utilisation and delivery of service and clinical outcomes. We herein report our primary and secondary outcome measures of quality and performance at 10 months postimplementation of the RAFT programme.",

Exclusion criteria for RAFT Clinic referral include: unstable vital signs; significant laboratory derangements; volume depletion; fulfilment of other standard hospital admission criteria; and initial malaria screening that is positive for P. falciparum malaria. For patients referred to the TDU via the RAFT algorithm, we offer a same-day or next-day assessment clinic (RAFT Clinic), which runs concurrently with regularly scheduled ambulatory tropical medicine clinics. The RAFT Clinic is operational on weekdays, and is staffed by 1-2 administrative assistants, 1 of 2 staff physicians on each day and up to three rotating resident trainees. A roster of eight staff physicians in tropical medicine offer coverage of TDU staff physician absences. No additional hospital resources were committed to development or implementation of the programme.

All cases of chikungunya fever were acquired in the Caribbean or Central America: three in Jamaica, three in the Dominican Republic and one each in the British Virgin Islands, Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, St. Lucia and St. Vincent.

            "text": "Implementation of the RAFT clinic led to a 78% reduction in the time to assessment by ambulatory tropical medicine, and this enabled febrile returned travellers to be followed closely during the critical first few days of illness during which clinical deterioration can occur. That we did not have any patients requiring admission following assessment in the RAFT clinic supports that such an ED algorithm and programme can be implemented safely. For the two patients with P. falciparum malaria, the RAFT algorithm was followed and those patients were appropriately referred to the Infectious Diseases consultation service for evaluation, prior to being sent to RAFT by the Infectious Diseases team. Conversely, the benign, self-limited nature of many travel-acquired illnesses was reiterated by the number of patients seen in the EDs and referred to RAFT, but who felt better by the following day and declined the appointment. Since no additional resources are committed to running the RAFT programme as patients are accommodated into the regular schedule, the impact of 'no shows' on clinic operations is negligible. Averaged over a year, our results suggest that implementation of a RAFT programme can avert \u223c72 repeat ED visits and 288 hours of ED bed-usage for a second malaria screening, thereby enhancing patient care and reducing workload in the ED. Our RAFT algorithm was derived from national guidelines on the approach to febrile returned travellers. 6 Yet adherence to the recommended minimum blood work was variable, with excellent adherence to malaria screening, CBC, electrolytes and creatinine, and lesser adherence to tests such as hepatic transaminases and urinalysis. Liver function tests are often perturbed in febrile returned travellers with diagnoses such as dengue, enteric fever, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), leptospirosis and the viral hepatitides, even in the absence of overt jaundice. Furthermore, hyperbilirubinaemia is one of the diagnostic criteria for severe malaria. 7 The pattern of abnormality of liver tests can be useful in refining the differential diagnosis. For instance, predominant elevation of hepatic transaminases occurs in arboviral infection, enteric fever, EBV, CMV and viral hepatitis. Conversely, a more cholestatic picture is suggestive of leptospirosis, biliary obstruction and even viral alcalulous cholecystitis. Thus, hepatic transaminases and bilirubin should be collected on all febrile returned travellers in order to inform the differential diagnosis, even in the absence of right upper quadrant pain and overt jaundice. Urinalysis, independent of urine culture, is also helpful in refining the differential diagnosis and may be abnormal in those without frank urinary symptoms, but with common travel-related diagnoses such as pyelonephritis (often occurring in the setting of traveller's diarrhoea), STIs including chlamydia and gonorrhoea, and leptospirosis, which leads to significant proteinuria. Conversely, the temptation to perform urine culture on febrile returned travellers without signs or symptoms of bacterial cystitis or pyelonephritis should be resisted in order to avoid inappropriate antimicrobial treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria. Even in the absence of a dedicated RAFT programme, we advise adherence to the national guidelines for assessment of febrile travellers, though, as demonstrated in this analysis, adherence overall was quite good. Respiratory tract infections are the third most common cause of fever in the returned traveller in single-centre and multicentre analyses. 6 8-13 We noted that respiratory syndromes were the second most common presentation among this group of febrile returned travellers, including eight cases of laboratoryconfirmed influenza. We noted at least 1 'off season' transmission of travel-acquired influenza A imported back to Canada in the month of July, which reinforces the point that influenza circulates with reciprocal seasonality in the temperate southern hemisphere (ie, during their winter months, which are our summer months). 14 Influenza can circulate year-round in the tropics, so clinicians must have it on their differential diagnosis and perform nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs on returned travellers with influenza-like illness, regardless of the month or season here. Testing laboratories should be alerted to the potential for off-season transmission of influenza in travellers, so that they may adjust their NP screening algorithms accordingly.",

Of 33 febrile returned travellers with presumed bacterial TD in this study, only six had stool culture positivity for a typical bacterial enteropathogen, despite >80% of TD being bacterial. 15 This lack of aetiological confirmation among individuals with TD has led to widespread implementation of empiric treatment strategies (eg, 3 days of ciprofloxacin 15 ); however, this approach may foster increased fluoroquinolone resistance among endogenous flora, and is counter to the tenets of antimicrobial stewardship. High-sensitivity, multiplex stool pathogen detection assays, now even commercially available, 16 17 have the potential to better direct antimicrobial treatment decisions in returned travellers with TD.",

While we did not have any patients with EVD during our enrolment period, \u223c17% of diagnoses (n=26) in this population of febrile returned travellers were notifiable at both the provincial and federal level, including influenza, HIV, salmonellosis, campylobacteriosis, typhoid fever, giardiasis and malaria, indicating public health import and/or potential communicability. 18 Our diagnosis of four febrile returned travellers with acute HIV, syphilis and genital chlamydia infection reinforces the need for a thorough sexual and behavioural history, especially in the context of known disinhibition on the part of travellers. 19 In their crosssectional study of >112 000 ill returned international travellers, Matteelli et al 20 documented STIs in 0.9%, many of which were acute HIV. Common STIs including secondary syphilis, acute HIV, acute HSV1 or HSV2, and gonococcemia can all lead to fever in the returned traveller. As such, these diagnoses should remain on the differential diagnosis and be excluded in the sexually active febrile returned traveller with a compatible history and clinical picture.",

            "text": "The several limitations of this analysis should be acknowledged. First, owing to limitations in the scope and funding of the study, we do not have the full range of hospital administrative ED data that would permit quantification of economic savings; thus, an economic analysis was neither planned nor performed. Although we cannot apply a dollar value to the economic savings of an ED visit averted for fever after travel, owing to the variability of this metric, we believe that our programme offers a systems-level improvement in care as most patients appreciate timely definitive management and avoidance of ED visits if possible. Second, illnesses with very short incubation periods, such as influenza and URTIs, may be over-represented and erroneously attributed to travel. We cannot definitively exclude the possibility that some cosmopolitan causes of fever in this group of returned travellers were locally acquired. Third, our ability to comment on the full spectrum of aetiological illness in this population is limited by the application of specific diagnostic tests deemed to be clinically relevant to the patient. Our goal was not to more precisely define the spectrum of illness encountered, but to reduce time to diagnosis, as we assume this leads to better outcomes and to a more efficient use of hospital resources. In 19 patients, 'non-specific viral illness' was the final diagnosis, and in three patients the diagnosis remained unknown, although symptoms resolved uneventfully and without specific therapy. Understanding the full spectrum of aetiological illness in such a population would require additional sophisticated and investigational diagnostics. Finally, we did not have a system by which to capture febrile returned travellers who may have fulfilled algorithm criteria but not sent to RAFT. We mitigated the risk of failure to capture all febrile returned travellers by frequent in-services and reminders to ED staff, as well as posted RAFT signage and binders in the ED. All fellows on-call overnight for the Infectious Diseases service had RAFT pocket cards and signage in their reviewing room. Similarly, we do not have a system that forces a general travel history, though with triage protocols mandating the collection of travel history to specific geographic regions such as the Middle East (due to Middle East Respiratory syndrome coronavirus) and West Africa (due to Ebola virus), we believe that travel history is most likely requested from all febrile patients entering the ED. At present, nurses are automatically prompted at triage to document a travel history within 21 days should a patient present with fever, cough, dyspnoea or diarrhoea; thus, we feel that the likelihood of missing travel-acquired illness in our EDs is low.",

In addition, we have offloaded the responsibility for treatment of infectious diseases that can be managed in an outpatient setting, but require specific therapy, such as acute urinary tract infections, from the ED.
