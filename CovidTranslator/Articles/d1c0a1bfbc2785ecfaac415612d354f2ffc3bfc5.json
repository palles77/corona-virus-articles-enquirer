The infection of SARS-CoV-2 leads to acute viral exudative pneumonia, with multiple organ damages, especially in lung, presenting bilateral diffuse alveolar damage with cellular fibromyxoid exudates. 7 80% cases have mild symptoms (including nonpneumonia and mild pneumonia cases), while about 20% patients have developed severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome, which attribute to death. 8 As of Mar 12th, 2020, 125,048 cases and 4,613 death have been reported globally. 9 The current standard treatment including oxygen therapy, antiviral treatment, fluid management, and antimicrobial therapy for secondary bacterial infections. 10 Although several drugs, such as remdesivir and chloroquine phosphate, have been registered in ongoing clinical trials for COVID-19, no specific antiviral drugs against this novel coronavirus are approved so far. The latest report indicates the infection of SARS-CoV-2 increases the expression levels of multiple proinflammatory cytokines, including IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1, MCP1, and IL-6 in the serum, which suggests the inflammation storm may involve in the progression of COVID-19. 4 Therefore, inhibiting virus replication and limiting excessive inflammation are of equal importance in COVID-19 therapy.",

A humanized IgG2 monoclonal antibody against CD147, meplazumab, effectively inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication and virus-induced cytopathic effect in Vero E6 cells, both in a dose-dependent manner. These data demonstrated a novel entry of virus infection mediated by CD147 receptor. 13 CD147 is also presented in activated inflammatory cells and participates the regulation of cytokine secretion and leukocytes chemotaxis by binding with cyclophilin A (CyPA). 14, 15 CyPA is a proinflammatory cytokine that is up-regulated in response to virus infection. 16 Our previous studies demonstrated that antibody targeting CD147 inhibited CyPA-induced T cell chemotaxis thus attenuating the local inflammation. 17 Based on these evidences, we assess the clinical outcomes using meplazumab as add-on therapy in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. We designed an open-label, concurrent controlled trial to evaluate whether meplazumab infusion improves the patients with COVID-19 pneumonia by inhibiting virus replication and suppressing inflammation.
