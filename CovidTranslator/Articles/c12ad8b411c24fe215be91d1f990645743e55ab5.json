This toolbox is built upon a hierarchical epidemiological model in which two observed time series of daily proportions of infected and removed cases are emitted from the underlying infection dynamics governed by a Markov SIR infectious disease process. We extend the SIR model to incorporate various types of time-varying quarantine protocols, including government-level macro isolation policies and community-level micro inspection measures. We develop a calibration procedure for under-reported infected cases. This toolbox provides forecast, in both online and offline forms, of turning points of interest, including the time when daily infected proportion becomes smaller than the previous ones and the time when daily infected proportions becomes smaller than that of daily removed proportion, as well as the ending time of the epidemic. An R software is made available for the public, and examples on the use of this software are illustrated. Some possible extensions of our novel epidemiological models are discussed.",

In addition, the virus itself may mutate to evolve, so to increase the potential rate of false negative in the disease diagnosis. As a result, some individual virus carriers are not contained. Thus, the transmission rate \u03b2 indeed varies over time, which should be accounted in the modeling. One extension to the above basic epidemiological model is to allow a time-varying probability that a susceptible person meets an infected person or vice versa. Suppose at a time t, q S ptq P r0, 1s is the chance of an at-risk person being in-home isolation, and q I ptq P r0, 1s is the chance of an infected person being in-hospital quarantine. Thus, the chance of disease transmission when an at-risk person meets an infected person is modified as: \u03b2t1\u00b4q S ptqu\u03b8 S t t1\u00b4q I ptqu\u03b8 I t :\" \u03b2\u03c0ptq\u03b8 S t \u03b8 I t , with \u03c0ptq :\" t1\u00b4q S ptqut1\u00b4q I ptqu P r0, 1s. In effect, this \u03c0ptq modifies the chance of a susceptible person meeting with an infected person or vice versa, which is termed as a transmission modifier due to quarantine in this paper. Obviously, with no quarantine in place, \u03c0ptq \" 1 for all time. See Figure 2 . This results in a new SIR model with a time-varying transmission rate modifier:",

When medical diagnostic tools become more accurate and reliable, as well the transparency of preventive measures gets improved for an exchange of voluntary in-home quarantine, certain adjustments in data typically occur. It is shown in Figure 8 that on Feb 12 the cumulative and daily added number of infected cases in Hubei had clear jumps with significantly large sizes. Such sizable jumps cannot happen within one day, rather they represent an accumulation of cases that have not been reported in previous dates prior to Feb 12. To fix this under-reporting issue, we develop a calibration procedure with the detail in Appendix C. Below we briefly describe our approach for the calibration of the infected cases.",

Possible reasons for such low proportions of infection and deaths include (i) discontinuing the traffic connections between Hubei and the provinces, (ii) more timely caution and preventative measures taken, and (iii) a comparatively large population that dilutes the exposed group. When Panel A in Figure 12 is zoomed in, some of the observed proportions (black dots) are deviated from the posterior mean or median of the fitted prevalence albeit they all fall in the 95% credible intervals, as shown by Panel A in Figures 13 and  14 . Since the latent process follows the SIR differential equations, there may be a lack of fit for the SIR model to accommodate a very large and complex population of 1.3 billion people, in which most of the subjects are not at risk. The proposed models should work much better for individual provinces, but we did not perform such analyses. The other epidemiological model with an added quarantine compartment as an absorbing state was fitted via our R function qh.eSIR in the package eSIR. The arguments used in qh.eSIR() are almost identical to those in tvt.eSIR(). Note that if the quarantine rate function is set at constant 0, this model will be reduced to a basic epidemiological SIR model. ### Example 4: Dirac delta function of the quarantine process change_time <-c(\"01/23/2020\",\"02/04/2020\",\"02/08/2020\") phi <-c(0.1,0.4,0.4) res.q <-qh.eSIR (Y,R,begin_str=\"01/13/2020\",death_in_R = 0.4, phi0=phi0,change_time=change_time, casename=\"Hubei_q\",save_files = T,save_mcmc = F, M=5e2,nburnin = 2e2) res.q$plot_infection 14 All rights reserved.

This is no surprising as our new models explicitly incorporate interventions, so that the estimated R 0 is an adjusted number with the influence of interventions be removed. In contrast, the basic model with no use of the quarantine modifier implicitly integrates the effect of interventions into the transmission rate \u03b2, and consequently the estimated R 0 is reduced due to the contribution from interventions. Our analyses suggest that reproduction numbers R 0 of COVID-19 without public health interventions would be around 4-5 within Hubei and around 3-3.5 outside Hubei with relatively big credible intervals. These findings are in agreement with findings from [17] . As pointed out above, the size of credible interval may be reduced with more accessible data of COVID-19, which permit users to specify smaller variances in the prior distributions given in section 3.1.",

Some turning points of interest are obtained from these forecasting curves as part of the deliverable information, including the predicted time when daily proportion of infected cases becomes smaller than the previous ones and the predicted time when daily proportion of removed cases (i.e. both recovered and dead) becomes larger than that of infected cases, as well as the time when the epidemic ends. Our informatics toolbox provides quantification of uncertainty on the prediction, rather than only point prediction values, which are valuable to see the best versus the worst. The key novel contribution is the incorporation of time-varying quarantine protocols to expand the basic epidemiological model to accommodate changing transmission rates over time in the population. The toolbox can be used by practitioners who have better knowledge of quarantine and better quality data to perform their own analyses. Practitioners can use the toolbox to evaluate different types of quarantine strategies in practice. All summary statistics obtained from the toolbox are of great importance for public health workers and government policy makers to take proper actions on stop spreading of COVID-19.",

For this, we analyzed the complete SARS data from Hong Kong given some similarity of COVID-19 to SARS. From this perspective, what we learned from this COVID-19 epidemic in this paper is extremely valuable to form initial conditions in the analysis of any future outbreak of similar infectious disease.

For example, the number of suspected cases is largely dependent on the diagnostic protocols, which have been revised a few times since the outbreak of the disease, and the sensitivity of the RNA test.

            "text": "We fit a state-space model with extended SIR, in which a time-varying transmission rate modifier \u03c0(t) (between 0 and 1) is introcuded to model. This allows us to accommodate quarantine protocol changes and ignored resources of hospitalization. The form of reducing rate may be a step-function with jomps at times of big policy changes or a smooth exponential survival function exp(\u2212\u03bb 0 t). The parameters of the function and change points, if any, should be predefined.Value casename the predefined casename.incidence_mean mean incidence.incidence_ci 2.5%, 50%, and 97.5% quantiles of the incidences.out_table summary tables including the posterior mean of the prevalance processes of the 3 states compartments (\u03b8 S t , \u03b8 I t , \u03b8 R t ) at last date of data collected ((t ) decided by the lengths of your input data Y and R), and their respective credible inctervals (ci); the respective means and ci's of the reporduction number (R0), removed rate (\u03b3), transmission rate (\u03b2).plot_infection plot of summarizing and forecasting for the infection compartment, in which the vertial blue line denotes the last date of data collected (t ), the vertial darkgray line denotes the deacceleration point (first turning point) that the posterior mean first-derivative of infection prevalence\u03b8 I t achieves the maximum, the vertical purple line denotes the second turning point that the posterior mean firstderivative infection proportion\u03b8 I t equals zero, the darkgray line denotes the posterior mean of the infection prevalence \u03b8 I t and the red line denotes its posterior median.plot_removed plot of summarizing and forecasting for the removed compartment with lines similar to those in the plot_infection. The vertical lines are identical, but the horizontal mean and median correspond to the posterior mean and median of the removed process \u03b8 R t . An additional line indicates the estimated death prevalence from the input death_in_R. spaghetti_plot 20 randomly selected MCMC draws of the first-order derivative of the posterior prevalence of infection, namely\u03b8 I t . The black curve is the posterior mean of the derivative, and the vertical lines mark times of turning points corresponding respectively to those shown in plot_infection and plot_removed. Moreover, the 95% credible intervals of these turning points are also highlighted by semitransparent rectangles.first_tp_mean the date t at which\u03b8 I t = 0, calculated as the average of the time points with maximum posterior first-order derivatives\u03b8 I t ; this value may be slightly different from the one labeled by the \"darkgreen\" lines in the two plots plot_infection and plot_removed, which indicate the stationary point such that the first-order derivative of the averaged posterior of \u03b8 I t reaches its maximum. first_tp_ci fwith first_tp_mean, it reports the corresponding credible interval and median.second_tp_mean the date t at which \u03b8 I t = 0, calculated as the average of the stationary points of all of posterior first-order derivatives\u03b8 I t ; this value may be slightly different from the one labeled by the \"pruple\" lines in the plots of plot_infection and plot_removed. The latter indicate stationary t at which the first-order derivative of the averaged posterior of \u03b8 I t equals zero. second_tp_ci with second_tp_mean, it reports the corresponding credible interval and median.",
