Therefore, major risk factor control is of particular importance for patients with ASCVD to reduce recurrent cardiovascular events. In the clinical guidelines co-developed by the Taiwan Society of Cardiology, Taiwan Society of Lipids and Atherosclerosis, and Diabetes Association of Republic of China (Taiwan), Li et al. 1 assisted health care professionals in Taiwan about the control of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia and diabetes mellitus. The panel also highlighted the recommendations about blood pressure, cholesterol, and sugar control for ASCVD, with medications beneficial for ASCVD.",

A total of 124 DN patients were randomly assigned into two groups to receive either valsartan 160 mg/d treatment (control group) or TWHF 60 mg/d plus valsartan 160 mg/ d treatments (TWHF group) for 24 weeks. The primary endpoint was a reduction in 24-h urine protein excretion between baseline and the end of study, the secondary endpoint was to observe the change in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) between two groups. After treatment, a more significant decrease in proteinuria was observed in patients who received TWHF treatment (from 4.95 AE 1.27 g/24 h to 3.36 AE 0.83 g/24 h) compared to valsartan monotherapy (from 5.21 AE 1.59 g/24 h to 4.52 AE 1.06 g/24 h). The percentage change in urine protein excretion was \u00c032.12% in TWHF group and \u00c013.24% in valsartan group. Patients' plasma albumin in TWHF group (from 32.53 AE 5.24 g/L to 36.91 AE 4.42 g/L) was higher than that in control group (from 33.18 AE 4.87 g/L to 34.67 AE 4.75 g/L). However, adverse events in TWHF group were higher than those in control group. In summary, TWHF is more effective than valsartan monotherapy in reduction of proteinuria in DN patients with overt proteinuria and normal eGFR, but with more adverse effects.",

To this end, Lai et al. 3 retrospectively collected 67 patients with ATTR p.A97S to study their clinical profiles, echocardiography, and ECG findings. Of these patients, 82% met the criteria for left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy. Reduced global longitudinal strain (GLS) was noted in 42.1% of them, and 14% had a relative apical sparing pattern. A low voltage pattern in the ECG was observed in 31.3%, while 64.2% presented with a pseudoinfarction pattern. End-systolic LV inner dimension (HR: 2.25 (95% CI: 1.01e5.01), p Z 0.048), reduced GLS (HR: 5.26 (1.08e25.0), p Z 0.039), relative apical longitudinal strain (RALS>1, HR: 8.57 (1.69e43.3), p Z 0.009), increased E/A ratio (HR: 6.51 (1.17e36.4), p Z 0.033), and increased QRS duration (HR: 1.02 (1.00e1.04), p Z 0.05) were correlated with reduced survival in univariate analysis. Multivariate analysis revealed reduced RALS was significantly correlated with reduced survival (HR: 13.00 (1.81e93.45), p Z 0.011). Thus, ATTR p.A97S is a cardiomyopathy as well as a polyneuropathic syndrome. Contemporary echocardiographic techniques are useful for identifying cardiac amyloidosis and providing prognostic information.",

Three-Available online at www.sciencedirect.com dimensional imaging data of 1-month pre-surgical (T1) and 6-month post-surgical (T2) CT were compared to assess accuracy of CASNOS planning. The accuracy of CASNOS protocol was evaluated by calculating the differences in the positions of selected landmarks between simulated surgical and post-surgical 3D images parameters, including ANB, A-Nv, Pog-Nv, and the positions of selected landmarks (ANS, Point A, Point B, Pog) changes in horizontal (x-axis) and vertical (y-axis) directions. Overall geographical discrepancy of planning was assessed by superimposing the color mapping of T1 and T2 imaging. A total of 30 adult patients with a mean age of 20.6 AE 1.5 years (female/male Z 18/12) were enrolled. The geographical changes of overall superimposition between the planned and post-surgical imaging was 0.60 AE 0.19 mm (range: 0.42e1.08 mm). The discrepancies between simulated and post-surgical ANB, A-Nv, Pog-Nv were 1.16 AE 0.36 , 1.25 AE 0.33 mm, 1.19 AE 0.35 mm, respectively. The deviations between simulated and postsurgical Point A and Point B positions were within 1 mm in horizontal and vertical directions. Therefore, the application of the pre-designed bony guiding splints of CASNOS protocol may allow surgeons to treat patients with craniofacial deformities more precisely.",

Ledipasvir/sofosbuvir (LDV/SOF) was introduced to Mongolia since 2016 for HCV eradication. HCV resistanceassociated substitutions (RASs) may affect the effectiveness of LDV/SOF in western chronic hepatitis C (CHC) patients. In this collaborative study, Hsu et al. 5 investigated the effectiveness of LDV/SOF and the impact of RAS on the treatment outcome in Mongolian CHC patients. Patients with genotype (GT) 1b HCV infection were enrolled in Mongolia and treated with LDV/SOF for 12 weeks. The proportion of pre-treatment NS5A Y93H RAS in viral quasispecies was measured using next-generation sequencing. The endpoint of LDV/SOF effectiveness was sustained virological response at post-treatment week 12 (SVR12). A total of 94 CHC patients were evaluated. The baseline Y93H proportion was <1% in 74 patients, 1e15% in 7, 15e50% in 2, and !50% in 11. All patients completed 12-week LDV/SOF treatment and the SVR rate was 90.4%. The rate of failure to achieve SVR12 for patients with Y93H < 1%, 1e15%, and !15% were 0%, 14.3%, and 61.5%, respectively (p for trend Z 0.001). Older age, baseline alanine transaminase level <40 U/mL, and a higher proportion of Y93H were associated with treatment failure in univariable analysis. In multivariable analysis, only a higher proportion of Y93H was associated with treatment failure (p Z 0.022). In summary, LDV/SOF therapy achieves a high SVR rate in Mongolian CHC GT1b patients without baseline Y93H RAS. However, a higher proportion of Y93H may undermine the its effectiveness.",

The blood hemoglobin (Hb) and serum iron, vitamin B12, folic acid, homocysteine, and GPCA levels in 56 B12D/AG patients and 532 healthy control subjects were measured and compared. The results showed that 56 B12D/AG patients had significantly lower mean blood Hb and serum iron levels as well as significantly higher mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and mean serum homocysteine level than healthy control subjects (all Pvalues < 0.05). Moreover, 56 B12D/AG patients had significantly higher frequencies of macrocytosis (53.6%), blood Hb (64.3%), iron (26.8%), and folic acid (3.6%) deficiencies, hyperhomocysteinemia (89.3%), and serum GPCA positivity (55.4%) than 532 healthy control subjects (all Pvalues < 0.005).

The Tridimensional Personality Questionnaire (TPQ) and Opiate Treatment Index were used to assess the association between personality and psychosocial conditions. Deviations of the three personality dimensions of TPQ (novelty seeking, harm avoidance, and reward dependence) could reflect eight personality patterns. The data indicated that SUD was associated with high novelty seeking and harm avoidance traits and explosive (borderline) personality pattern, whereas HUD was also linked with sensitive (narcissistic) pattern. Subjects with HUD tended to have more deviant personality traits than subjects with MUD. For subjects with SUDs, all three personality dimensions and sensitive (narcissistic) personality patterns were associated with emotional and somatic distresses, and those with explosive (borderline) and sensitive (narcissistic) patterns had poor social functioning.
