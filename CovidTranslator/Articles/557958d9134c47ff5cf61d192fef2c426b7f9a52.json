Green and Stillinger (1934) noted similar inclusions when they experimentally infected dogs with material from fox encephalitis. The first avian adenovirus was isolated when material from bovine lumpy skin disease was inoculated into latently infected embryonated eggs and a virus was isolated (Van den Ende et al., 1949) .",

Densities between 1.32 and 1.37 gm/ml in CsCl have been estimated for fowl isolates (Laver et al., 1971; Potter et al., 1971; Yasue and Ishibashi, 1977; Todd and McNulty, 1978) . A value of 1.32 gm/ml was obtained for a hemagglutinating adenovirus, 127, probably of duck origin (Todd and McNulty, 1978) , and values of 1.32-1.34 gm/ml for the turkey hemorrhagic enteritis/marble spleen disease viruses (Carlson et al., 1974; Iltis et al., 1975) .

There was about 25% homology between the DNAs of B3 and H5 by filter hybridization (Niiyama et al., 1975) . Burnett et al.

Thus highly oncogenic human adenoviruses (HI2, HI8, H31) have a G-C content of 48-49%, weakly oncogenic strains (e.g., H3, H7) 50-52%, and nononcogenic strains (e.g., H8, H9, H10) 57-61%. However, this pattern does not apply to the simian adenoviruses, in which oncogenic viruses have a G-C content of 55.1-61.6% (Table V) . Thus the highly oncogenic strains SA7 and SV20 (Hull et al., 1965) have a G-C content of 58-62% (Pina and Green, 1968; Burnett et al., 1972) . The highly oncogenic B3 (Darbyshire, 1966 ) from cattle has been described as having a G-C content of 58% (Niiyama et al., 1975) and would therefore resemble the oncogenic simian viruses. However, Panigrahy et al. (1977) established the G-C content of B3 at 48% and that of the non oncogenic Bl and B2 at 61-62%, which would fit into the classification of human adenoviruses. agglutinated cells from seven mammalian species, and bovine cells were used in a hemagglutination (HI) test for Bl, B2, and B7 ).

These workers showed that fluorocarbon and ultrasonication quickly inactivated the hemagglutinating activity. This contrasts to many of the human adenoviruses, with which fluorocarbon can be used for virus purifica tion (Green and Pina, 1963) , although H19 and H26 are inactivated by fluorocar bon (Wigand et al., 1966) . The ICH hemagglutinin-erythrocyte receptor complex appears to be more stable than human strains, since it is not dissociated either by lowering of the temperature or by the use of receptor-destroying enzyme (Simon, 1962; Norrby\u00e9>itf/., 1967; Marusyk and Yamamoto, 1971) .",

It is possible to group monkey adenoviruses in a similar fashion to human adenoviruses on the basis of their power to agglutinate erythrocytes from three species (Table V) . The main differences are that most strains of monkey adenoviruses agglutinate guinea pig and rhesus erythrocytes at 4\u00b0C but not at 37\u00b0C, (Rapoza, 1967) . This can be contrasted to the human strains, of which only H8, H9, H10, and H19 hemagglutinate guinea pig cells, and with which rat and rhesus monkey cells are agglutinated at 37'C (Hierholzer, 1973) . S4 will also agglutinate human, bovine, and ovine erythrocytes (Tyrrell et al., 1960) . Hillis and Goodman (1969) divided the adenoviruses isolated from chimpan zees into three subgroups. Subgroup 1 agglutinated rhesus or vervet monkey erythrocytes; subgroup 2 hemagglutinated rat cells in the presence of heterotypic immune serum; and subgroup 3 did not agglutinate monkey, rat, guinea pig, or human cells. The subgroup 1 viruses include the Cl isolate. These isolates may have some relationship to human 16, but full cross His were not undertaken. The Cl isolate has been shown to be related by serum neutralization to H14 (Rowe et al., 1956) . The subgroup 2 viruses were divided into four strains: Y25, Y141, those viruses apparently identical to H5, and those, including C2, related to H2. Subgroup 3 had two unrelated strains, Y34 and Y37 (Hillis and Goodman, 1969) . Four serologically distinct viruses, PAN5, 6, 7, and 9, were isolated from lymph nodes of chimpanzees.PAN6 hemagglutinated rhesus monkey cells, and they were not related to human or other simian viruses (Basnight et al., 1971) .",

The hemagglutinin was stable to trypsin, RNase, DNase, and neuraminidase. It was, however, inactivated after 15 minutes at 56\u00b0C, and 0.2% formaldehyde reduced its titer by eightfold. By agglutinating rat cells, the virus resembled the viruses of Rosen's human adenovirus group 2, but the fiber length of 17 nm would classify it in the human subgroup 3.",

Thus hexon preparations of six human, three simian, and two canine adenoviruses showed cross reactivity in the complement fixation (CF) test . Exceptions to this have been the subgroup 2 bovine adenoviruses Table II ). While the subgroup 1 viruses fully share a common antigen with human adenoviruses, the subgroup 2 viruses have only a weak relationship. The reaction is stronger when human antigen is reacted against bovine subtype 2 sera than with the reverse reaction (Bartha, 1969) . Support for these findings has come from other workers (Tanaka^/ al., 1968; Mohanty, 1971; Rondhuis, 1973; Mattson et al., 1977) . However, Inaba et al. (1968) showed that there was as much sharing of antigens between human strains and B4 and B7 as there was between B4 and B7. B6 shared a common CF antigen with B1-B4 and P4 adenoviruses (Mayr et al., 1970) . B4 had a common line of identity with H2 in the immunodiffusion test (Cole, 1970) , and a B5 isolate had the adenovirus group antigen (Coda et al., 1975) . Baczynski et al. (1974) used purified hexon antigens of B5 and B8 in the CF and fluorescent antibody CF tests against antisera to B4, 3, and 4 -8 and demonstrated that both subgroups shared an antigen, but titers were two-to fourfold higher with the homologous system.",

When divalent cations at 50\u00b0C were examined, one strain was unaffected (Dutta, 1975) and another destabilized (Harden, 1974) . The bovine adenoviruses show consid-\u00e9rable variation in their response to heat, and this property is discussed under their classification. The ovine adenoviruses resist 56\u00b0C, and divalent ions in crease their inactivation (McFerran et al., 1971b; Bauer et al., 1975) . The ICL (A26/61) canine adenovirus is inactivated by 40 minutes at 56\u00b0C (Yamamoto, 1966) . The fowl adenoviruses are apparently the most variable. At 56\u00b0C, FI (U. Conn) was inactivated after 90 minutes (Petek et al., 1963) , while FI (Phelps) was still viable (Yates and Fry, 1957) . FI (EV-89) was still infective after 22 hours (Burke et al., 1959) . The infectivity of Fl (93) was reduced by 30 minutes at 70\u00b0C but not removed until 80\u00b0C was reached (Clemmer, 1964) , and F2 (65) was not completely inactivated by 40 minutes at 60\u00b0C (Cho, 1971) . Strains tested in the same laboratory have shown variations in thermostability, suggesting that these variations cannot be ascribed just to differences in technique (Rosenberger et al., 1974; Mustaffa-Babjee and Spradbrow, 1975) . Fowl adenoviruses have been found to be destabilized by divalent cations (Petek et al., 1963; Burke et al., 1965; McFerran et al., 1972) , although other workers could not confirm this . Some other variations could be due to technique, however. Thus 3-30 minutes at 56\u00b0C inactivated both mouse adenovirus types, and divalent ions had no effect (Hartley and Rowe, 1960; Hasimoto et al., 1966; Missal, 1969) . But Wigand et al. (1977) found that if cell culture supernatant was used, 30 minutes at 56\u00b0C inactivated the virus, whereas if the supernatant was diluted 1:20 in distilled water, the virus was thermostable. Yamamoto (1967) drew attention to the importance of pH when testing for the effects of cations on thermal stability.",

It has been possible to classify the animal adenoviruses studied into these human adenovirus subgroups (see Table I ).",

These strains have differing degrees of oncogenicity. Thus S16 produced tumors in all animals inoculated after 41 days, whereas SII produced only one tumor after 229 days. In a comparative study, Burnett et al. (1972) found S5 and S16 the most oncogenic and were unable to confirm the oncogenicity of S6 or S14. Strain S16 will also produce tumors in suckling rats (Hull et al., 1965) . Monkey adenovirus-induced tumors rarely metastasize unless virus is inoculated intraperitoneally. The tumors are usually invasive and poorly differentiated. Types S5, S8, and S16 induced tumors resembling lymphomas, while the other strains produce palisading, pseudoaciner, and spindle cell patterns (Merkow and Slifkin, 1973) .",

Avian adenoviruses are distinct from mammalian AAV types (Yates et al., 1973; El Mishad et al., 1975) . Although many stock cultures of fowl adenoviruses have AAV present (El Mishad et al., 1975) , this may be due to AAV infection in the parent flock supplying the eggs for cell culture. Immuno-electron microscopy examination of both field isolates and stock pools has shown relatively low levels of infection with AAV (McFerran, unpublished observations), and Yates et al.

Subgroup 1 viruses are inactivated by 56\u00b0C for 30 minutes, replicate in bovine testicular and kidney cells, are readily isolated on first passage in cell culture, have single, irregularly shaped inclusion bodies, and share an antigen with human adenoviruses. Subgroup 2 viruses are reduced in titer but not inactivated by 56\u00b0C for 30 minutes, replicate only in bovine testes cells, form multiple regular inclusion bodies, and are difficult to adapt to cell culture. There is only a partial sharing of an antigen with human adenoviruses. Bartha and Kisary (1970) modified this classification, as they found that resistance at 56\u00b0C could be modified by passage. Thus the prototype strains of Bl and B2 were still themolabile after 10 passages but thermolabile after 60 passages. One B3 strain was reduced in titer but not inactivated by 56\u00b0C (Mattson, 1973) , while another B3 isolate was virtually inactivated (Lehmkuhl et al., 1975) . B4 and B6 strains were either inactivated or markedly reduce in titer by 30 minutes at 56\u00b0C (Tanaka et al., 1968; Cole, 1970; Coria et al., 1975) , whereas although B7 had a 99% fall in titer after 30 minutes at 56\u00b0C, 2000 TOD.\u2122 was still present after 120 minutes. Clearly, more work is required to establish if this is a reasonable parameter for classification.",

Therefore, more work is required to establish the true situation. Phillip and Sands (1972) showed that B4 and B7 had inclusions which were numerous single irregular and multiple round types corresponding to both of Bartha's subgroups. However, Curran (1978-1979) have shown that there is reasonable agreement between the pattern of growth in cell culture and Bartha's subgroups. Thus B l -3 and B9 fell into group B, and B4-6 and B8 fell into group A. B7, however, is in Bartha's subgroup 2 but falls into cytopathology group B. A number of workers have confirmed that subgroup 2 viruses do not replicate in bovine kidney (BK) cells (Bartha and Aldasy, 1966; Tanaka et al., 1968; Cole, 1970; Phillip and Sands, 1972 ). It appears that these viruses grow in the epithelial cells of bovine testes (BT) cultures but not in the epithelial cells of BK (Aldasy et al, 1965; Mattson et al., 1977; Sibalin et al., 1978) . However, other workers have found that B4 (THT), B5 (B4/65), B6 (671130), B6 (KC-2), B7 (Fukuroi), and B8 (Misk/67) all grow as well in (BK) as in (BT) cells. Other strains of species B4 (KC-6), B5 (BIL), and B6 (RG) all required one to two blind passages in bovine embryonic corneal (BEC) cells before pro ducing a cytopathic effect (CPE), and B4 (Negano) could not be adapted to BK cells (Mohanty, 1971) . Although in general the subgroup 2 viruses conform to Bartha's classification in that they are difficult to isolate in cell cultures and grow to low titers (Cole, 1970; Mohanty, 1971) , others have recorded high titers (Tanaka et al., 1968; Stauber et al., 1976) . Furthermore, the subgroup 1 viruses can also be difficult to isolate and can grow to very low titers (Klein, 1962; Darby shire et al., 1965 Darby shire et al., , 1969 Lehmkuhl^a/., 1975) .",

This condition occurs mainly in 2-week-old to 4-month-old calves. Initially, upper respiratory tract signs are seen, quickly followed by increased salivation and diarrhea. Following a 1-2-week course, most calves recover, although with a marked loss of condition; however, about 10% develop more severe respiratory signs, and many die. At autopsy the main findings depend on the stage of the disease. There is usually a hemorrhagic tracheitis, and lung changes vary from hyperemic through catarrhal pneumonia to a purulent pneumonia, often associ ated with pleurisy and endocarditis (Aldasy et al., 1965) . Experimental infection of calves with B4 reproduced the syndrome, albeit in a milder form. Mohanty (1971) carried out experimental infections with B4, B5, and B8. Calves infected with B4 and B5 had clinical respiratory signs, while those given B8 did not. Some of the calves given B4 and B5 had macroscopic and micro scopic lung changes. B4 appears to be the most important pathogenic bovine adenovirus in central Europe (Burki, 1973) .",

Elazhary and Derbyshire (1978) found that higher titers of B3 were obtained if they were grown in suspension cultures of MDBK cells and suggested that the virus might have a preference for young, actively dividing cells.

Thus the virus has been recovered from the nasal mucus of a 3-day-old Clydesdale foal (Wilks and Studdert, 1973) . Fur thermore, on four farms during a 4-year observation period, multiple incidences of disease occurred within groups of foals. One mare gave birth in successive years to three foals that died of pneumonia, indicating not only a genetic defi ciency but also virus persistence . There is often a very high incidence of antibody on farms (Todd, 1969; Studdert et al., 1974) . Foals before suckling had no antibody to adenovirus, which develops after ingestion of colostrum (Harden et al., 1974) . Serological studies indicate that reinfection is fre quent, and infection or reinfection can occur in the presence of high levels of circulating antibody. However, subclinical infections appear to occur quite fre quently between 90 and 150 days, when maternal antibody levels have fallen (Harden^\u00ab/., 1974; Studdert^\u00f6/., 1974) .",

Hematological examination revealed an absolute lymphopenia and neutropenia in the foals which died. No HI antobidy could be detected. In-contact foals were infected with equine adenovirus and developed respiratory signs and HI antibody, but did not show the severe lymphopenia . In the foals which died, rhinitis, tracheitis, pulmonary atelectasis, bronchopneumonia, and lymphoid atrophy were seen. Microscopi cally, there was necrosis of and large basophilic intranuclear inclusions in the epithelial cells of the respiratory tract, urinary tract, conjunctiva, pancreas, and focally in the intestine McGuire and Poppie, 1973) . These foals lacked bone marrow-derived (B) lymphocytes, as shown by the lymphopenia and hypogammaglobulinemia (IgM and IgA could not be detected) and by the absence of germinal centers in the lymph nodes and spleen. They also lacked thymus-derived (T) lymphocytes, as indicated by thymic hypoplasia and the absence of thymic-dependent lymphoid tissue (periarteriolar lymphocytic sheaths) in the lymph nodes and spleen. These immunological deficiencies sug gest that there might be a genetic component of this condition McGuire and Poppie, 1973) . Following a study of the percentage of affected foals in Australia, Thompson et al. (1975) suggested that the immuno deficiency was due to a simple recessive autosomal gene. These authors consider that the basic reason for the fatal pneumonia is the immunodeficiency and not the adenovirus.",

Using both the HI and SN tests, it was possible to divide seven isolates into CI or A26/61 types (Swango et al., 1969) . But using purified reagents, it was shown that antiserum to Cl hexons would neutralize both Cl and A26/61 viruses, whereas antiserum to A26/61 hexons would neutralize only A26/61 virus. Using antisera prepared to the fibers, the HI test indicated a similar one-way cross, but in the SN test these fiber antisera were type specific (Marusyk, 1972) .

Clemmer (1972) was able to distinguish between a juvenile and an adult pattern of virus excretion in the feces, depending on the age of infection. Day-old chicks excreted higher titers of virus for longer periods than did 21-day-old birds. Little information is available on the oronasal secretions as a source of infection, but as virus is often present in the conjunctiva, nasal mucosa, pharynx, and trachea, it seems reasonable to assume that they have a role. Egg transmission is important, and many workers have recorded the pres ence of adenovirus in uninoculated embryonated eggs or cell culture (Yates and Fry, 1957; Burke et al., 1965; Khanna, 1966; Cook, 1968) .",

The virus was confined to the intestine, bursa of the Fabricius, and upper respiratory tract, in contrast to the pattern seen in experi mental infection of antibody-free birds with massive doses of virus. In the type of husbandry practiced, with depletion of the flocks and with cleansing and disin fection of the houses between flocks, carryover of virus was not important. The viruses found in these flocks were antigenically similar to those present in the parent flocks of the same organization. Presumably following vertical transmis sion, the virus becomes unmasked with the loss of maternal antibody at 2-4 weeks, and spreads slowly through the flock. Experimental work has shown that maternal antibody is lost within the first 4 weeks of life and that its presence does not prevent infection with some serotypes (Kohn, 1962) , but presumably it does prevent latent virus from becoming activated. Because of the rather frequent isolation of more than one serotype from a bird, it is probable that there is little cross protection on the mucosal surface between species.",

Basophilic inclusions were rarely seen in field cases of IBH. In a study of the livers of 20 naturally infected birds, eosinophilic inclusions were seen in all, but basophilic inclusions were seen only in 6 birds (Itakura et al., 1974 (Itakura et al., , 1977 . On electron microscopic examination of the livers in naturally occurring cases, these eosinophilic inclusions contained either very few or no adenovirus particles (Pettit and Carlson, 1972; Bickford et al., 1973; McCracken and McFerran, unpublished observations; (Fig. 5 ). Itakura et al. (1977) found that virus particles were detected only in the cells with basophilic inclusions and that the eosinophilic inclusions corresponded to those cells consisting of fibrillar granular material, without viral particles. The lack of virus particles in the eosinophilic inclusions should be compared to the large numbers of particles associated with the basophilic inclusions in the livers of birds with a hepatitis following experimental infection (Figs. 5 and 6) (Bickford et al., 1973; McCracken and McFerran, unpublished observations) .",

            "text": "A number of workers have been able to reproduce the syndrome, but usually only by parenteral inoculation of very young chicks (Rosenberger et al., 1974; Grimes et al., 1977b) . One group has reproduced it both by natural routes of infection and in older birds (Fadly and Winterfield, 1973) . Other workers could not reproduce typical lesions even by unnatural routes (Sharpless and Jungherr, 1961; Kawamura and Horiuchi, 1964; McDougall and Peters, 1974; Macpherson et al., 1974) . McCracken et al. (1976) produced a hepatitis when type strains and strains isolated from birds with IBH were inoculated into 5-day-old chicks. These changes occurred with seven fowl and two turkey adenovirus serotypes, but not with Fl strains. It is difficult to reconcile these conflicting findings. It may be that some other agent is also required, a suggestion given substance by the development of a hemorrhagic-aplastic anemia syndrome in one trial which was not associated with adenoviruses (Grimes and King, 1977b) . Some workers have claimed that prior infection with infectious bursal disease virus enhances the pathogenicity of the adenovirus in IBD (Rosenberger et al., 1975; Fadly et al., 1976) , and regression of the bursa of Fabricius in IBD has been described (Pettit and Carlson, 1972; Bickford et al., 1973) . However, results from both natural cases (MacPherson et al., 1974) and experimental infection (Grimes et al., 1977b) suggest that IBD virus is not necessary to produce the IBH syn drome. b. Depressed Egg Production. Winterfield et al. (1973) recorded the isola tion of an Fl (Indiana C) virus from a flock with poor eggshell quality. Other workers have attributed a 10% decline in production to adenovirus infection (Berry, 1969; Cook, 1972) . Adenoviruses were also associated, on the basis of the development of group antigen, with depressed egg production linked to soft-shelled and shell-less eggs in the Netherlands (Van Eck et al., 1976) . McFerran et al. (1978a) , investigating the same syndrome, isolated adenoviruses be longing to serological groups from birds 26 to 40 weeks of age. However, they did not feel that these isolates were of major importance in the syndrome. Workers in the United States (Cowen et al., 1978b) experimentally infected birds with four isolates, including Fl (Indiana C). They had no effect on egg quality, and only one F5 (IBH-2) had a minimal effect on egg production. Furthermore, it is quite common to isolate adenoviruses from uninoculated eggs or cell cultures derived from flocks with normal production (Cook, 1968; McFerran, unpublished observations) .",

The first changes were seen 7 days after oral infection with 127 virus, when loss of shell pigment occurred. This was followed by thinning of the eggshell and then on the ninth day by soft-shelled and shell-less eggs.

Fowl sera prior to the importation of the infected birds did not have antibody to 127 virus . Duck flocks in England have antibody, and this virus has been isolated from them (Baxendale, 1978) . Duck flocks but not fowl flocks in the United States also have antibody to 127 virus, and there was evidence that infected ducks did not readily infect fowl (Calnek, 1978) . It seems reasonable to postulate that these viruses are duck adenoviruses. The problem of the widespread distribution of this virus in different breeds in Western Europe and its apparently poor ability to spread from flock to flock is best explained by contamination of a vaccine.

(1959) The DID test has been used for diagnosis and monitoring of specific pathogenfree (SPF) flocks for infection. It has the advantage of being inexpensive and quick, and it detects group antibody. McFerran et al. (1975) drew attention to the failure of SPF birds experimentally infected by a natural route with one serotype always to develop detectable antibody. This observation has been confirmed by others (Grimes et al., 1977a; Yates et al., 1977) . Cowen et al. (1978b) found, when studying naturally infected flocks, that in spite of isolating many adeno viruses especially from the 8-14-week age group, the percentage of birds wtih detectable precipitin antibody rose steadily from 28% in 8-14-week-old birds to 97% in the 30-43-week age group. Apart from the inherent lack of sensitivity of the test, it is probable that more sensitivity could be achieved by using more than one antigen. Thus, although the fowl and turkey adenoviruses tested have a common immunoprecipitin antigen (McFerran et al., 1975) , it is clear from CF studies that this group antigen is not shared to the same extent by all strains (Kawamura^/o/., 1964) .",

An isolation made in Germany may also be Fl but was not fully characterized (Ahmed, 1971 ). b. Turkey Adenoviruses. A number of workers have reported the isolation of one or more serotypes, but unfortunately comparative studies have not been carried out. Thus two serotypes (TAV1 and TAV2) were described in Northern Ireland (Scott and McFerran, 1972; McFerran et al., 1975) . Two serotypes (WTAV and AMK49) were described in the United States, and WTAV is similar to TAV1 (King and Hanson, 1975; King, 1977) . The NC-120 isolate (Simmons et al., 1976) , and NC-J and NC-K isolates (Sutjipto et al., 1977) , and the MST virus isolated by Domermuth (Easton and Simmons, 1977) were compared (Sut jipto et al., 1977) . Three serotypes were recognized. The NC-120 and MST viruses were identical and were different from the NC-J and NC-K viruses. The turkey viruses studied share a group antigen with the fowl adenoviruses, are not neutralized by the prototype fowl antisera (McFerran et al., 1975) , and either do not grow or grow poorly in cells of fowl origin (Scott and McFerran, 1972; King, 1977) .",

Viruses have been isolated from the respiratory tract of turkeys with respiratory tract disease (Scott and McFerran, 1972; Blalock et al., 1975; Simmons et al., 1976; Sutjipto et al., 1977) . Blalock et al. (1975) elicited a respiratory response when their Fl isolate was inoculated into turkeys. Cho (1976) , using another Fl isolate, claimed to have produced hepatitis, respi ratory tract disease, bursal atrophy, and growth depression in both chicks and poults. However the possibility of infectious bursal disease (IBD) virus infection was not eliminated since the affected organs were not examined by immunofluorescence or electron microscopy. Therefore the possibility exists that adenoviruses alone were not responsible for these lesions. Adenoviruses were isolated from a severe upper respiratory tract disease of young turkeys. But attempts to repro-duce this condition have failed, although mild disease was produced with some strains (Simmons et al., 1976; Dillman and Simmons, 1977; Sutjipto et al., 1977) . Page et al. (1978) have shown that these birds had antibody to IBD virus, which had not previously been recognized in turkeys, and suggested that turkeys might be infected with IBD, which could interfere with the immune response. This suggestion was opportune, as IBD virus has now been isolated from turkeys (McNultyeftf/., 1979) .",

The pathology has been described by a number of authors (Gross, 1967; Itakura and Carlson, 1975; Fujiwara et al., 1975) . The main lesions were splenomegaly, congestion of the small intestine, and hemorrhagic contents of the intestine. Microscopically, there was an acute hemorrhagic enteritis, degenera tive changes of the lymphoid tissue, and proliferation of reticuloendothelial cells in all areas. Intranuclear inclusions were seen in the large mononuclear cells in visceral organs and in reticular cells around sheathed arteries of the spleen. Death was probably due to bleeding from damaged capiallaries in the tips of the villi. The HEV or a similar virus of chickens has been isolated from the enlarged spleens of birds condemned for Marek's disease (Domermuth, 1979) .",

The attenuated vaccines have proved very effective. However, not only is the vaccine virus excreted in the urine, but it may result in focal intersti tial nephritis (Appel et al., 1973) . In addition, it may cause corneal edema, which is usually transient, provided corticosteroids are not used. One study suggests that over 0.4% of vaccinated dogs may have \"blue eye\" following vaccination (Curtis and Barnett, 1973) . The immunity following inactivated vaccine appears less effective, and this has led to some manufacturers to rec ommend repeated revaccination. This procedure could lead to the development of circulating immune complexes and glomerulonephritis, as suggested by Mur ray and Wright (1974) , but there is no direct evidence for this. Because A26/61 has been associated only with lesions of the respiratory tract, it has been sugges ted that an attenuated strain would be suitable for protection of dogs against both ICH and ILT (Appel et al., 1973) . A commercial A26/61 vaccine is now in use. Some work has been carried out using both inactivated and attenuated vaccines in the control of adenovirus infection in cattle (Tribe et al., 1969; Burki, 1973; Bartha, 1974) . Bartha (1974) has suggested that immunization with Bl and B8 would provide protection against the other members of the subgroups, but this remains to be confirmed.

            "text": "Surprisingly differences are found in the ease of isolating adenoviruses from different species. Thus it is easy to isolate fowl and canine adenoviruses and difficult to isolate bovine and porcine adenoviruses. Apart from inherent differ ences in the ability of adenoviruses to replicate in cell cultures, other factors may be important. It appears that they grow best in primary epithelial cells from the homologous species, and with some types (e.g., the group 2 bovines) these epithelial cells must be from certain organs. Some of the differences reported may be due to the percentage of epithelial cells in the cultures. Cells grown from bovine testes or embryo fowl liver can all too often end up as fibroblast cultures. Furthermore, the cells may contain latent adenovirus or, in the case of bovine cells, latent or noncytopathic bovine viral diarrhea (BVD) virus. Furthermore, BVD virus may be introduced into other cell lines through the use of contami nated fetal calf serum. As a first step, all cultures should be tested for the presence of BVD virus by immunofluorescence. It may also be advisable, espe cially where low titers of stock pools are found, to treat them with chloroform to remove possible contaminants. Adeno-associated parvoviruses can also cause a major reduction in the titer of pools and, where possible, should be removed.",

            "text": "One of the problems with adenoviruses of certain species is the time required to identify the adenovirus effect on cell cultures, as for example, the five blind passages in calf-tested cells to isolate a B8 strain (Rondhuis, 1973) . It is probable that the use of immunofluorescence would help to reduce the time. Furthermore, in investigating major syndromes, convalescent serum can be used in the indirect immunofluorescence test to aid in viral detection. Convalescence or pooled serum collected from old animals can also be used most successfully for immunoelectron microscopy (McFerran and McNulta, 1978c [Fig. 8] ). Possibly not enough attention has been paid to the metabolism of the cells, since for the growth of a number of strains, actively dividing cells are required. ",
