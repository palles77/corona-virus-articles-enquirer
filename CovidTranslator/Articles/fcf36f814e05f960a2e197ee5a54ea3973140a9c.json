            "text": "For this report, the Commission developed a new model-based global estimate of the total fi nancing that would be needed to achieve universal access to a basic package of essential medicines in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). A costing model was developed on the basis of disease prevalence, current or projected consumption of medicines, and international reference prices. Using two consumption scenarios, the Commission estimated that between US$77\u00b74 and $151\u00b79 billion (or $13 to $25 per capita) is required to fi nance a basic package of 201 essential medicines (378 dosage forms) in all LMICs. Yet in 2010, the majority of low-income countries (LICs) and 13 out of 47 middle-income countries, spent less than $13 per capita on pharmaceuticals. Thus, the Commission confi rmed that many people worldwide do not have access to even a limited basket of essential medicines. Countries should adapt the Commission's model to their national contexts to create a locally relevant estimate as a benchmark for measuring performance on essential medicines. The Commission's recom men dations on fi nancing of essential medicines are: \u2022 Governments and national health systems must provide adequate fi nancing to ensure inclusion of essential medicines in the benefi t packages provided by the public sector and all health insurance schemes. \u2022 Governments and national health systems must implement policies that reduce the amount of out-ofpocket spending on medicines. \u2022 The international community must fulfi l its human rights obligations to support governments of LICs in fi nancing a basic package of essential medicines for all, if they are unable to do so domestically. \u2022 Governments and national health systems must invest in the capacity to accurately track expenditure on medicines, especially essential medicines, in both the public and private sectors, disaggregated between prepaid and out-of-pocket expenditure, and among important key populations.",

Quality and safety of medicines are compromised when manufacturers, whether by accident or intent, produce substandard products, and when the supply chain allows unsafe, and sometimes dishonest, practices during transport and delivery. Current regulatory capacity and enforcement are insuffi cient in most LMICs. Global and national regulatory structures therefore require considerable and urgent reform to assure the quality and safety of medicines. The large donor programmes for AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria treatments have helped to advance strategies on quality procurement, such as the WHO/UN Prequalifi cation Programme. A clear trend towards international regulatory collaboration and electronic communications has emerged. These trends can now be leveraged to ensure continued progress for the full array of essential medicines for all countries.",

A new global policy framework is needed to drastically adapt the current model and to reduce its reliance on market exclusivity as the main driver of innovation. Governments need to defi ne a list of missing essential medicines to be provided under UHC schemes, and governments, non-governmental organisations, and the industry need to make the necessary R&D fi nancing mechanisms available for these identifi ed needs. The price of new essential medicines can then be delinked from development costs and the products can be made widely available and aff ordable through non-exclusive licensing agreements.

This commitment can be created in part through deliberate steps to document eff orts and demonstrate progress. Thus, the Commission proposes a set of 24 core indicators to measure progress in the implementation of comprehensive essential medicines policies. Together, the proposed indicators can track the progress of countries and the global community in their eff orts to advance in the fi ve priority areas for essential medicines policies (fi nancing, aff ordability, quality and safety, use, and development of new medicines). The Commission intends these indicators to serve as a starting point for the continued development of accountability mecha nisms that incorporate independent reviews and corrective actions. Setting appropriate targets for each indicator will be a crucial component of the process, requiring the active involvement of relevant stakeholders.

High prices for medicines are often associated with the period of monopoly under patent protection. However, even lower-priced medicines can become unaff ordable to most households in low-income countries (LICs). 6 Aff ordability becomes a particularly serious problem when medicines are needed for chronic conditions, including non-communicable diseases (NCDs). Aff ordability of medicines has become a key issue for governments, as well as public and private payers for health care, regardless of a country's income level. European countries aff ected by the global fi nancial crisis have reported restricted access to essential medicines. 7 In the USA, state-funded health-care institutions that are responsible for prisoners have been sued over the poor access to new high-priced essential medicines for hepatitis C. 8 The third key challenge is assuring the quality and safety of essential medicines. Poor-quality medicines seriously undermine the eff ectiveness of health care, as well as public confi dence in the health system. Many incidents of harm from sub-standard and falsifi ed medicines have been recorded. 9, 10 For example, poorquality antimalarial medicines are responsible for an estimated 122 000 deaths per year in children under 5 years in 39 sub-Saharan African countries. 11 Contaminated medicinal products were responsible for the deaths of more than 100 children in Panama 12 and 230 patients in Pakistan. 13 Medicines cannot have a positive impact on health unless they are used appropriately.

Directly related to this question is the need to estimate how much treatment will cost for each specifi c population. This estimate is in itself a major challenge, since pricing of the new DAAs varies widely among countries and also sometimes within countries. 22 For example, it has been estimated that treating all eligible patients in the USA with DAAs would require an additional US$65 billion over the course of 5 years. 23 Some US insurance plans off er treatment, but many restrict access to particular subsets of patients with hepatitis C virus infection (based on, for example, severity of illness or likelihood of benefi ting from treatment). The high price of sofosbuvir (with a list price of about $84 000 for a full course of treatment) prompted an investigation by the US Senate Committee on Finance; it revealed that even though Medicare spent more than $1 billion on the medicine in 2014, less than 2\u00b74% of patients with hepatitis C virus infection enrolled in Medicare had received treatment. 24 The budget implications of paying for DAAs as part of a basic health-care package are tremendous in high-income countries; the budget implications in health systems with far fewer resources are even more daunting.",

For example, in 2015, sofosbuvir was licensed in Malaysia where hepatitis C virus infection prevalence is estimated at 2\u00b75% of people aged 15-64 years, mostly among men. 25 However, sofosbuvir remains unaff ordable for patients and the government alike, with a price set at about $87 430 for a 24-week course. 26 Malaysia is considered an upper-middle-income country, 27 with a gross domestic product per capita of $11 307 in 2014-far less than the cost of a single treatment course. 28 Pricing has little to do with production cost; for sofosbuvir, production is estimated to cost between $68 and $136 for a 12-week treatment course. 29 The medicine is sold in India for $500, 29 and after Egypt introduced local production of the medicine, the price there dropped to about $330. 30 Thus, there is ample scope for price reductions in Malaysia and elsewhere, but achieving them requires concerted eff ort to implement a range of policies to promote aff ordability. Prices are expected to fall for the production of sofosbuvir, ledipasvir/sofosbuvir combination tablet, and the recently registered tablet sofosbuvir/velpatasvir for sale in 101 low-income and middle-income countries, following Gilead Sciences Inc's signing of voluntary licence agreements with 11 Indian generics companies in 2014. 31 The Medicines Patent Pool also off ers a licence for daclatasvir for sale in 112 low-income and middle-income countries. 32 Assuring quality and safety of DAAs Mitigating the risk of substandard and falsifi ed DAAs entering supply chains and reaching patients is necessary; quality and safety concerns highlight the need for aff ordable quality-assured treatments. In March 2016, a non-governmental organisation in Myanmar reported it had identifi ed two falsifi ed products, one claiming to contain 400 mg sofosbuvir + 90 mg ledipasvir, and the other 60 mg daclatasvir. 33 The manufacturer listed on the packaging has never produced the combination, nor was it currently producing 60 mg daclatasvir. Lack of access to treatment attracts criminal entities that exploit people's health needs. Other falsifi ed DAAs have been found in Israel, 34 and Pakistan's regulatory authorities have identifi ed factories making counterfeit versions. 35 Falsifi ed medicines endanger patients' health and undermine trust in legitimate medicines manufacturers. The best way to counter the supply of falsifi ed and substandard medicines is to ensure the availability of aff ordable, quality-assured essential medicines.",

When the WHO Action Programme on Essential Drugs was established in 1982, the pharmaceutical industry feared that WHO, under pressure from consumer groups, would develop an international code on pharmaceutical marketing. 43 44 The 1984 World Health Assembly (WHA), led by Nordic countries and the Netherlands, asked WHO Director-General Halfdan Mahler to organise a global meeting to discuss the rational use of medicines. The term rational use refl ected the view that medicine-related problems went beyond logistics, but were also driven by uncontrolled pharmaceutical markets.

            "text": "The fi rst era of essential medicines policies coincided with the emergence of the primary health-care movement and the Alma Ata Conference. The essential medicines concept was articulated in the fi rst WHO Model List of Essential Medicines published in 1977. 37 The fi rst Model List elicited both strong support and strong opposition. Supporters argued that a list of essential medicines established standards that both enabled stakeholders to work toward common aims and provided advocates with a baseline for health-care delivery. However, many health professionals and the pharmaceutical industry were opposed, concerned that the selection of a list of essential medicines would limit health-care delivery, constrain professional autonomy, interfere with pharmaceutical markets, and reduce health benefi ts for patients. 52 Despite the controversies around the concept of essential medicines, throughout the 1980s governments and health systems around the world-especially, but not only, in LMICs-developed essential medicines lists, largely for the public sector. By the 1990s, many multilateral and bilateral agencies supported national public sector essential medicines programmes. Notable examples included programmes in Bolivia, Ecuador, Kenya, Malawi, Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda, Yemen, Zimbabwe, and later, South Africa. Non-governmental health organisations and faith-based organisations also applied these strategies across Africa via the Ecumenical Pharmaceutical Network among others. 53, 54 Most national essential medicines lists in this fi rst era focused on off -patent, lower-priced generic medicines to treat or prevent common acute conditions. Examples include anti-infectives (such as mebendazole, ivermectin, ampicillin, and doxycycline), analgesics (aspirin and paracetamol), anti malarials (chloroquine and primaquine), oral rehydration solution, and childhood vaccines. This emphasis aligned with the movement for selective primary health care that was strongly championed in the 1990s. 55 This movement had emerged as a response to the problem of facing enormous unmet medical needs with limited resources. Selective primary health care focused on delivering a restricted range of fi rst-contact services with high costeff ectiveness in LMICs, and emphasised maternal and child health services. It did not directly address health system structures needed for chronic communicable and non-communicable conditions, particularly the emerging burden of HIV. Instead, the emphasis of essential medicines policies in this era was on effi ciency (by prioritising low-cost and cost-eff ective treatments) and equity (by emphasising treatm ents for diseases associated with poverty). 56 The fi rst era also saw a global economic crisis and the imposition of economic structural adjustment programmes on many donor-dependent LMICs. These programmes reduced the fi scal space for public sector ; literature searches, searches using Google and websites of essential medicine programmes; and a specifi c call through the E-DRUG listserv. In case of contradictory information, especially with regard to date of publication, the original document was identifi ed and studied when possible. The dataset includes 101 countries for which at least one national essential medicines list could be identifi ed. Excluded were institutional, regional, and national reimbursement lists. For each country, the year of the fi rst national essential medicines list and the GDP per capita in that year, according to the World Bank, were identifi ed. This fi gure shows the national GDP (expressed in 2015 US$) in the year of publication of the fi rst national essential medicines list. Every dot represents one country with a fi rst national essential medicines list. GDP=gross domestic product. 57 Increased user fees for health services and a reliance on revolving drug funds became common features of health policy in such settings. As a result, essential medicines were largely fi nanced by individuals paying out of pocket, often in the private sector. Two indicators are frequently cited to demonstrate progress during this fi rst era: the number of LMICs that established a national list of essential medicines, and the number of countries that adopted a national medicines policy describing principles for selection, quality, and appropriate use. Although these are useful structural indicators that demonstrate the spread of the concept of essential medicines, the existence of a policy or a list does not in itself guarantee aff ordable access to qualityassured essential medicines. Neither does it necessarily result in quality use. Furthermore, with reductions in public budgets, some countries have not regularly updated their essential medicines policies or lists, leaving large gaps between policy development and implementation.",

            "text": "The second era for essential medicines policies began in the late 1990s with the global moral outrage over the toll of the AIDS epidemic. At the era's outset, eff ective 59 Human rights principles reinforced the arguments used, fi rst by AIDS activists and then by political leaders, to support greater access to treatment for AIDS and to raise awareness about global disparities in access to essential medicines. The concept of a human right to health was fi rst articulated in 1946, 60 but it was not until 2002 that the UN appointed the fi rst UN Special Rapporteur on \"the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health\". 61 Subsequently, access to essential medicines was highlighted and elaborated as a concrete element of the right to health. 62 To make the process of selecting essential medicines for the WHO Model List more evidence-informed and transparent, major changes were introduced in 2002, 63 coinciding with calls by activists and advocacy groups such as M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res. 64 WHO changed its defi nition of essential medicines from those \"of utmost importance, and are basic, indispensable and necessary for the health and needs of the population\" 37 to \"those that satisfy the priority health care needs of the population\", adding a clarifi cation that \"[t]hey are selected with due regard to public health relevance, evidence on effi cacy and safety, and comparative cost-eff ectiveness.\" 65, 66 The key change was the new emphasis on costeff ectiveness; high cost of a medicine no longer automatically excluded it from the Model List. With these changes, twelve widely patented antiretroviral medicines, then priced up to US$10 000 per patient per year, were classifi ed as essential in the Model List of 2002. 67 This change bolstered the moral argument for policy to progressively realise access to treatment. Previously, aff ordability had been one condition of selection; selection now became part of the pressure to ensure aff ordability. In the following decade, due to the concerted global action by patient and activist groups, donor governments, WHO, and generics manufacturers, and the absence of product patents for medicines in India and elsewhere, the cost of antiretroviral medicines fell to less than $100 per person per year, enabling millions of patients to gain access to life-saving treatment.",

These goals emphasised reducing mortality due to AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria, and promoting newborn baby, child, and maternal health. Essential medicines were an integral component of interventions to achieve the MDG targets by 2015. 70 Reduced mortality from pneumonia, diarrhoea, and measles were responsible for half of the 3\u00b76 million fewer deaths under fi ve years recorded between 2000 and 2013. 71 Also by 2013, about 13 million persons living with HIV were receiving life-saving antiretrovirals. Global malaria mortality fell by 42% between 2000 and 2012, with 3\u00b73 million deaths averted because, in part, of increased access to antimalarial medicines. 70 Global disease programmes instituted a range of mechanisms to address pricing, selection, quality assurance, and cost-eff ective procurement of medicines. However, these interventions were rarely identifi ed as essential medicines policies, although the concept supported this public health approach. The GFATM required that only quality assured generic antiretroviral medicines were procured, when possible. 72 Pooled procurement of such products was used to exert downward pressure on prices. Additionally, the GFATM required public reporting of procurement prices. 73 These policies contributed to improved transparency and set an important precedent for other major donors and procurement programmes.",

In 2004, WHO presented a global survey of therapeutic areas that lacked essential treatments, creating the concept of missing essential medicines and calling for a public health approach to innovation. 74 A key group of missing essential medicines were those for children. In parallel with American and European regulatory eff orts, the 2007 World Health Assembly Resolution (WHA60.20) on Better Medicines for Children highlighted the need for paediatric dose forms of many essential medicines. 75 In response, WHO published the fi rst Model List of Essential Medicines for Children in 2007. 76 Although important successes were achieved in relation to the MDGs, the general target related to access to medicines (MDG 8.E: \"In cooperation with pharmaceutical companies, provide access to aff ordable essential drugs in developing countries\") proved diffi cult to measure with any certainty. A report by the UN pointed out what is obvious to health workers and patients around the world: many poor households remain unable to obtain needed medicines, either because of poor availability, or poor aff ordability, or both. 77 The controversies around essential medicines that characterised the fi rst era continued throughout the second era, and many persist into the current period. 78 However, the second era also brought concerted eff orts to mobilise all stakeholders, including the pharmaceutical industry, to work towards improving health by securing access to aff ordable and quality assured medicines. In 2008, the Human Rights Guidelines for Pharmaceutical Companies in Relation to Access to Medicines were published, 79 followed in 2011 by the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. 80 In the past decade, more than 300 health partnerships in LMICs have been reported wherein the pharmaceutical industry, alone or in collaboration with other stakeholders, is investing to improve health and development. 81 Some progress of these initiatives is documented by the Access To Medicines (ATM) Index. 82 Rigorous evaluation of the eff ect of these initiatives remains a key challenge.",

Policies to support essential medicines must support increasingly comprehensive health services, delivered through pluralistic systems that include both the public and private sectors, and which eff ectively mobilise and engage with civil society. 90 Demographic and epidemiological transitions that accompany social and economic development-namely the ageing of populations and an emerging focus on NCDs-generate major challenges for essential medicines policies. Public fi nancing and provision of essential medicines in the fi rst and second eras traditionally gave priority to medicines to treat or prevent communicable diseases. 91 The 2011 UN High Level Meeting on NCDs recognised that addressing non-communicable conditions is necessary in all countries. 92 The WHO Global NCD Action Plan 2013-2020 set, as one of its targets, \"80% availability of the aff ordable basic technologies and essential medicines, including generics, required to treat major NCDs in both public and private facilities.\" 93 All countries need to adopt and implement policies that ensure equitable access to aff ordable essential medicines.",

Similarly, any medicine for which no prevalence or demand data were available, or which was not used in either of the settings used to estimate consumption (namely KwaZulu-Natal and Denmark, as explained below), was excluded from the analysis. A similar approach has been used in other modelling exercises, for example in distinguishing between basic, limited, enhanced, and maximal provision for packages of medicines and care for patients with breast cancer. 110 Detailed explanations of the methods used in the modelling exercise are provided in appendices 1.2-1.4. In brief, three methods were used for estimating the quantity of each medicine that is required each year in all LMICs. First, for medicines with a single indication, data on global burden of disease were used to project demand. These data were obtained from the Global Burden of Disease project or from the scientifi c literature; and were then scaled by an estimate of how many patients with a given condition would receive treatment (known as treatment coverage; appendix 1.4). Additionally, standard treatment guidelines and fi ndings from the literature were used to model how many people on treatment for a condition would receive each medicine (known as medicine coverage; appendix 1.4).",

Overall, the modelled results were fairly robust and not strongly infl uenced by changes in the data inputs, except in relation to medicine prices.

The Commission's estimate is comparable, however, with the Clinton Health Access Initiative estimate that meeting the \"90-90-90\" targets in LMICs would cost $3\u00b78 billion in purchasing costs for antiretrovirals. 104 Likewise, for tuberculosis the Commission's modelled estimate for the total cost of medicines is approximately $760 million, with $440 million for fi rst-line treatments and $320 million for second-line treatments. According to UNITAID's 2014 TB Medicines Landscape report, the total value of the global tuberculosis medicines market (combining the public and private sectors) was approximately $700 million, including up to $425 million for fi rst-line treatment in adults and $300 million for treatment of multidrug-resistant tuber culosis in adults. 120 The similarities among the Commission's model results and other existing estimates of medicine costs for global treatment of HIV and tuberculosis provide some corroboration of the Commission's estimates.",

This support would contribute to ensuring that all people have access to essential medicines, as included in international human rights treaties, and fulfi l governments' obligations to realise human rights even beyond their borders. 60 Such support would also help LICs to develop health services delivery infrastructure while they work to identify adequate domestic fi nancing.",

The Commission's modelling exercise can serve as a starting point for determining the fi nancing needs for essential medicines for a particular country. This exercise should be adapted to the national context (including disease burden, standard treatment guidelines, health priorities, and the costs of delivering care in that particular system). In any national costing exercise, particular attention must be paid to the specifi c needs of underserved communities to promote equity and to assure progressive realisation of the right of access to health-care services. The aim must be to achieve a benefi ts package that addresses the population health needs in a way that can be sustainably fi nanced from diff erent sources, in a fair and transparent manner. 2 Governments and national health systems must implement policies that reduce the amount of out-ofpocket spending on medicines. More than half of all spending on medicines in LMICs comes from out-ofpocket expenditure, which is highly inequitable.",

This support should come in addition to similar support programmes already in operation for essential medicines for specifi c diseases such as HIV, tuberculosis, malaria, and neglected diseases. The Commission urges countries to review innovative fi nancing mechanisms to determine whether they can be extended to apply to essential medicines generally. 4 Governments and national health systems must invest in the capacity to accurately track expenditure on medicines, especially essential medicines, in both the public and private sectors. Data should be disaggregated between prepaid and out-of-pocket expenditure, and among important key populations. Informed decision making on investments in the purchase of essential medicines requires quality data on current spending. Since national-level data can obscure important inequities, data need to be disaggregated for important key populations, chosen with the particular national situation in mind. In designing monitoring systems, attention must also be paid to enabling maximal involvement of all stakeholders and to the principles of transparency, including access to the data for use by policy analysts and academics.

This is especially true for individuals who are paying out of pocket. When medicines are unavailable in the public sector, patients are forced to purchase them in the private sector using out-of-pocket resources. 132 Between 2007 and 2014, generic medicines were available in an average of 58% of public health facilities in LICs and lower-MICs (availability ranged from 17% to 100%). 133 Aff ordability is particularly problematic when medicines must be taken on a continuing basis, such as for the management of chronic communicable or noncommunicable conditions. Unlike AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria, NCDs have not been the target of new global funding facilities. Diff erences in aff ordability also exist within the NCDs group: essential medicines for cancer and diabetes are often less aff ordable than treatments for hypertension. 134 Nonetheless, a study of private pharmacy prices for four commonly used cardiovascular medicines in 18 countries showed that they were potentially unaff ordable for at least some patients in every country. This result included 0\u00b714% of households in HICs, 25% in upper-MICs, 33% in lower-MICs, as much as 60% in LICs (excluding India), and 59% in India. 6 The results of a review 132 of WHO/Health Action International (HAI) price data in LMICs showed that a month of treatment for three common chronic NCDs (gastric ulcers, asthma, and type 2 diabetes) was not aff ordable to large segments of the population when purchased in the private sector. (The WHO/HAI method uses a defi nition of aff ordability that is based on the number of days of the minimum public sector wage for unskilled government workers required to purchase 1 month of treatment.) 135 Similarly, considerable challenges have been documented with the aff ordability of insulin for treating diabetes. 136 Public sector data from 13 LMICs showed that the mean public sector price of human insulin (100 IU isophane/regular 70/30) represented 0\u00b77 to 6\u00b72 days' minimum public sector wages for 1 month of treatment. In the private sector, across 20 LMICs the same medicine represented about twice the burden, between 1\u00b71 and 13\u00b77 days' wages. 137 ",

However, these data are limited and rapidly become out of date. In the 2015 World Health Statistics report, only 38 (19\u00b76%) of 194 countries had survey results generated between 2007 and 2013. 139 The only datapoints reported were minimum, median, and maximum values for the availability of generic medicines, and the median consumer price ratio (compared with international reference prices) of selected generic medicines in the public and private sectors. Although the WHO/HAI cross-sectional survey method 136 has been validated, it remains subject to limitations in terms of sampling, facilities, and the basket of medicines assessed. 140 Very few countries have done repeated price surveys, while data on aff ordability by income strata are not available. Routine data are easier to collect from single-payer and state-operated systems, but data obtained from distributors or retailers have limitations. Such data are often out of date because of price fl uctuations, and do not refl ect undisclosed discounts, clawbacks, or other types of price reductions. Routine collection of data on the actual prices paid by patients for medicines rarely occurs, especially in settings in which out-of-pocket payments are common and the prices paid are highly variable. The International Drug Price Indicator Guide issued by Management Sciences for Health addresses this gap to a certain extent, by reporting sellers' and buyers' prices from government agencies, pharmaceutical suppliers, and international development organisations. Other price reporting mechanisms have been developed for specifi c medicines, such as antiretrovirals and tuberculosis treatments. [141] [142] [143] The lack of reliable price information is a barrier to cross-national comparisons and impedes the development of responsive pricing policies. Furthermore, because aff ordability relates to total expenditure, which is determined by both price and volume, data on the use of medicines (see section 4) should be considered as well during the development of evidence-informed policies. The Commission concludes that new systems are needed to routinely collect, analyse, and respond to pricing data in real time, particularly in LMICs. These systems will require investments in strengthening capacity between institutions that generate and analyse information.",

WHO off ers guidance to countries on a wide range of medicines pricing policy options available to governments and health systems. 144 Topics include: internal and external reference pricing, 145 reimbursement limits and reasonable co-payments, removing sales taxes and tariff s on medicines, 147 regulating increases to factory-gate prices, setting distribution chain price controls, and regulating professional and other fees. 146 Although many policy options are relevant to countries where public sector provision of health care predominates, others only become available when countries implement a purchaser-provider split. 148 UHC does not imply either complete reliance on public sector service provision or a more pluralistic system involving both public and private providers. However, any system that enables a large purchaser, such as a national health insurance fund or public health sector, to use monopsony (only one buyer) power (through competitive bidding and price negotiations) exerts downward pressure on prices. 150 Pooled procurement, when multiple payers within a country or across countries negotiate prices together, can also be used to increase monopsony power. 151 Such practices have been widely used, in conjunction with measures to overcome patent barriers, to supply generic antiretrovirals by the global fi nancing initiatives that have transformed the landscape of antiretroviral prices. 152, 153 Transparency about prices has been a major feature of these global fi nancing systems, in marked contrast with the situation that pertains to pharmaceutical pricing in other settings. Although little conclusive evidence exists that transparency alone results in price reductions, the possibility has been raised that price transparency could enable collusion or other anticompetitive behaviours between companies 154 or in an attempt to limit price reductions. However, as the case of antiretrovirals has shown, transparency can also be accompanied by drastic price reductions.",

            "text": "Ineff ective and ineffi cient national procurement institutions and processes can also contribute to higher than necessary prices for payers, aff ecting the availability of medicines. 124, 155 Over at least the past decade, collective procurement strategies have been promoted globally, particularly between international agencies. For example, manufacturers reduced the prices of etonogestrel and levonorgestrel by roughly 50%, from $18 to $8\u00b750 per unit for etonogestrel and $16\u00b750 to $8\u00b750 per unit for levonorgestrel, thanks to minimum volume guarantees by a consortium of global health partners. The price reductions resulted in a near-doubling of orders from buyers and, ultimately, improved access for women. [156] [157] [158] Global donors, technical partners, and manufacturers have also joined forces to help reshape health product markets and reduce the production costs of pharmaceuticals. For example, between 2003 and 2013, GAVI cultivated a competitive marketplace for the penta valent vaccine, resulting in a price reduction of up to 65% (from $3\u00b756 per dose to as low as $1\u00b719). In 2013, this reduction was projected to save GAVI up to $150 million over the course of 4 years. 159 The policies that promote aff ordability vary depending on the types of essential medicines being considered. Single-source medicines (including those still under patent) and multi-source medicines require diff erent approaches. Pro-generic policies enable considerable cost savings whenever generic alternatives exist. 160 For example, it has been estimated that Chinese hospital purchasers could save a total of $1\u00b74 billion (2014 US$) by switching from originator brand antihypertensives and antidiabetics to domestically available generic equivalents. 161 Pro-generic policies include: prescription by international nonproprietary name, allowing (or requiring) generic substitution by pharmacists, and using procurement and reimbursement decisions to promote generic use (table 4) . These policies depend on trust, held by prescribers, dispensers, patients, and carers, in the quality of available generic products (sections 3 and 4). 163, 164 For the past 5 years, price increases of up to 1250% for medicines available as generic products have come under intense scrutiny in North America 165 and Europe. 166 Manufacturers of older generic medicines point out that the larger companies have little interest in these products, because of low profi tability. Little or no competition between the few remaining producers removes downward pressure on prices, enabling inordinate price hikes. The manufacturers argue that pricing refl ects the value of the medication, but others interpret it as unscrupulous price gouging and call for policy solutions on moral grounds.",

The World Trade Organization's Agreement on Trade-related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) obliges all member countries to provide patents for all technologies, including pharmaceuticals, with a minimum duration of 20 years. (The exemption for least developed countries [LDCs] is time limited, to 2033.) TRIPS also includes a range of fl exibilities that provide governments with options that allow for the protection of public health, including access to aff ordable medicines (section 5). Widespread use of these fl exibilities has been key, for example, in the supply of generic antiretrovirals. 167 However, these fl exibilities are under continual threat from the TRIPS-plus obligations included in bilateral and regional trade agreements. For example, data exclusivity provisions require each manufacturer of generic or biosimilar medicines to generate its own data for applications to regulatory authorities for market authorisation-for many, this requirement becomes an insurmountable barrier. 168 Furthermore, it raises ethical concerns when a standard of care has already been established. Countries that use TRIPS fl exibilities also risk trade pressures, such as being included in annual watch lists like the Special 301 Report issued annually by the US Trade Representative.",

            "text": "A systemic response to the challenges of intellectual property barriers is provided by the Medicines Patent Pool (MPP), 169 which is described in more detail in section 5. Patent licences, such as those available from the MPP or certain patent-holding companies, provide a legal means to reduce the negative eff ects of a patent monopoly on the availability of a generic medicine and lead to greater availability at more aff ordable prices. Use of a licence might require the payment of a royalty, and is subject to restrictions in terms of geographical scope. Companies making generic medicines under an MPP licence and certain company licences can, nevertheless, supply countries outside of the scope of the licence, provided those countries have issued a compulsory licence or enabled government use of a patent, or such supply does not otherwise infringe on a granted patent in that country. 170 Local production has been promoted as a strategy to expand access to aff ordable generic medicines. For example, Mozambique received support from the government of Brazil to promote domestic pharmaceutical production, 171 whereas the European Union funds a large project to foster technology transfer between regions. 172 In the early 1990s, the national HIV treatment programmes of Brazil and Thailand were both largely dependent on locally produced low-cost antiretrovirals. 173 Two earlier literature reviews 174,175 concluded that, while promoting domestic production is often politically or economically motivated, meaningful assessment of the impact is missing. What evidence exists on the impact of domestic production on prices is contradictory, 175 perhaps partly caused by confl icting public health and industrial policy agendas. 176 Weak regulatory authorities and a dearth of human resources are among the economic and institutional barriers that have impeded domestic production in many settings. 176 , 177 The problem of aff ordability of single-source medicines under patent protection might well be most acute for MICs excluded from voluntary licensing agreements. These countries are obliged to grant patent protection for pharmaceuticals and are vulnerable to political pressures when they attempt to apply TRIPS fl exibilities. They might also be excluded from receiving donor support. In this regard, South Africa is an exceptional case. On the basis of its high HIV prevalence, it is included in many voluntary licences and non-enforcement agreements for antiretroviral drugs. However, South Africa is subject to the full force of the TRIPS Agreement and has yet to amend its patent laws to take full advantage of available fl exibilities.",

The price of a new medicine is typically set by the manufacturer to maximise its profi ts during the period of monopoly supply under patent. Tiered pricing schemes have been promoted as a strategy to protect aff ordability. However, this practice can artifi cially segment a market, or result in only short-term price reductions, particularly when compared with the long-term impact of competition. 178 Large volumes, high prices, or a combination of both can contribute to making essential medicines unaff ordable. Whenever a large amount of medicine is required, such as when a large patient pool exists, a health system's fi nancial capacities can be stressed. If the price of a widely used medicine, or an entire class of medicines, is increased, the budgetary impact can be devastating. Antiretroviral drugs exemplifi ed these challenges as access to treatment was expanded. 179 For more on Special 301 Report see https://ustr.gov/issue-areas/ intellectual-property/Special-301 treat hepatitis C. 22 As described in panel 2, these expensive medicines are urgently needed by millions of people worldwide, and the expiration of primary patents for these products is only expected from 2024. 180 Biological medicines (those based on large, complex molecules, such as proteins and antibodies, as opposed to the simpler, smaller molecules that are incorporated in chemical medicines), such as monoclonal antibodies used to treat cancers, are another example of medicines whose prices present aff ordability challenges to all countries, regardless of income level. In the USA, the average acquisition price (the price charged to patients, insurers, or the health system) of newer cancer treatments now ranges from $10 000 to $30 000 per month. Biological medicines are projected to comprise approximately 20% of the value of the global pharmaceutical market in 2017. 181 They contributed to the largest percentage increase in pharmaceutical expenditure in HICs between 2005 and 2015 (fi gure 5).",

In the USA, where a largely laissezfaire approach to medicine pricing has been in eff ect for many years, there are now calls for a change to the \"system in which prices are linked to the value of products.\" 184 In 2016, US President Barack Obama issued a call for transparency in reporting production and development costs, increasing rebates by manufacturers to pay for medicines received by certain groups of benefi ciaries of Medicare and Medicaid, and granting government the authority to negotiate prices for certain high-priced medicines. 185 These developments represent a complete change in attitudes about new medicines and their costs in the USA, which pays, on average, the highest prices for medicines globally.

For instance, a review of reimbursement decisions in 14 OECD countries found that both the severity and the rarity of a condition were used to justify higher incremental cost-eff ectiveness ratios or higher prices than would be the norm. 217 Balancing the various considerations and justifi cations that could be used in such decisions highlights the necessity of explicitly defi ning ethical principles to guide the use of economic analyses in the selection of medicines.",

An initial HTA had shown that FOLFOX would be considered cost-eff ective compared with the alternative (adjuvant therapy with folinic acid, 5-fl uoruoracil, and capecitabine), but only if the price of oxaliplatin were reduced by at least 40%.

A multistakeholder process, including ophthalmologists, academics, and representatives from the Thai Food and Drug Administration and pharmaceutical industry, recommended that negotiations commence with the producer of ranibizumab to reduce the price, but in the event that these price negotiations failed, bevacizumab will be included in the NLEM (with development of a system for monitoring serious adverse eff ects). \u2022 Cost-sharing arrangement: although an HTA of imiglucerase for the treatment of type 1 Gaucher disease showed the product not to be cost-eff ective, a cost-sharing model was negotiated, which allowed the product to be included on the NLEM in 2012.

The Commission maintains that every available regulatory and management intervention that could improve the aff ordability of medicines must be considered. The suite of policy instruments includes: pricing interventions, pro-generic policies, use of TRIPS fl exibilities when patent barriers prevent access to lowerpriced alternatives, and avoidance of TRIPS-plus provisions in bilateral trade agreements. Considerable evidence supports the use of these policies to support the aff ordability of essential medicines. 220 No option should be regarded as off the table for political reasons. For example, removing taxes and tariff s is well within the power of governments, even if it might be unpopular with certain stakeholders. Moreover, committing to UHC provides countries with new opportunities to eff ectively implement policies, such as leveraging newly created buyer power and fi nancial pooling, to address high prices of medicines. The ultimate objective is not merely cost-containment. Instead, as previously noted, UHC aims for the long-term sustainability of the health system; the ability to develop and provide proven eff ective medicines to all people who need them, including disadvantaged groups; and to improve their health status and personal satisfaction, and the fi nancial protection off ered to citizens.",

Countries moving towards UHC have an opportunity to respond to the needs of payers for quality price information for procurement and reimbursement decisions. Simultaneously, countries should measure their progress on providing aff ordable medicines. Monitoring systems should inform decision making about the need for interventions on medicines price and aff ordability. Monitoring systems also need to include regular surveys to obtain data disaggregated by economic status, rural or urban setting, sex, and other key population groups. 2 Governments must implement a comprehensive set of policies to achieve aff ordable prices for essential medicines. Countries moving towards UHC should consider using pricing policies that leverage large buyer power, setting a reimbursement limit by reference, and creating incentives for prescribers and patients such as reimbursement caps or copayments when appropriate. Policies to address high prices of generic essential medicines might require a diff erent set of policies from essential medicines under patent protection. The full range of medicines pricing policy interventions must be employed to ensure the aff ordability of essential medicines for individuals and populations, including When the outcome of a health technology assessment and a decision to deny coverage of a medicine is socially unacceptable, politicians might be asked to seek short-term solutions.

This reversal provoked fi erce responses from cancer groups, including a request to the UK Government to issue a compulsory licence to allow a lower priced version of the product. 201 The product remains available through the Cancer Drugs Fund after an agreement between the manufacturer and National Health Service in England was reached. 202 However, the Cancer Drugs Fund was not considered to be a long-term solution, and it was replaced by the Managed Access Fund. 203, 204 Sustainability lies in lower pricing of medicines considered essential. Political response to the Pharmaceutical Benefi ts Advisory Committee's rejection of trastuzumab also resulted in the creation of a unique funding programme in Australia in 2001. 205 In 2015, trastuzumab was added to the WHO Model List of Essential Medicines, together with several other expensive cancer treatments and all of the currently available direct-acting antivirals for hepatitis C virus infection. 20 That step was only the fi rst in the process of ensuring equitable access to all who need these essential medicines. 206 exempting medicines from taxes and tariff s, progeneric policies in the case of multi-source products, and the use of TRIPS fl exibilities in the case of singlesource products.

For example, assessments of new generic versions of fi rst-line antiretrovirals can now be left to stringent national authorities or regional networks. The focus of WHO's programme should then shift to other priority medicines, such as generic insulin, other biosimilars, and newly developed essential medicines that still pose challenges to NMRAs. The programme's quality standards and public reports should be used as the basis for regulatory convergence and reciprocal recognition; its Public Assessment Reports and Public Inspection Reports can serve as examples for all NMRAs. The transparency initiatives of the European and Australian regulators can also serve as exemplars in this regard. 246 A multilateral fi nancing mechanism would enable the prequalifi cation programme to evolve in this way-not merely increasing its existing activities but moving towards the analysis of selected new essential medicines independently from individual donors and manufacturers alike.",

A sustainable fi nancial base must be created to maintain its full independence from donors and manufacturers. 3 Payers and procurement agencies must adopt good procurement practices that incorporate eff ective and transparent quality assurance. Quality assurance mechanisms must exist at all points in the supply chain. Appropriate quality assurance systems require investment. Sharing test results and fi ndings of inspections can avoid duplication and increase effi ciency. 4 Governments must redirect the activities of national regulatory agencies towards those that add value and reduce duplication of eff ort, and engage with a system for independent and public assessment of the performance of NMRAs. Activities aiming to address effi ciency and eff ectiveness should cover all the basic components of a national medicines regulatory authority, with special focus on international harmonisation, prevention of duplicative eff orts, maintenance of a single or central NMRA within a country, inspections and enforcement of regulations, assessments of new essential medicines for neglected diseases in their jurisdiction, regulation of medicine promotion, transparent reporting on the prevalence of substandard medicines in the market, pharma co vigilance, collaborating with domestic manufacturers in promoting GMP, and abstention from patent linkage and extended periods of data exclusivity. 5 Regulatory agencies must encourage the involvement of other stakeholders and the general public in promoting the quality and safety of essential medicines. This action can be achieved through, for example, the involvement of stakeholder re presentatives before regulatory decisions, the use of product quality verifi cation testing at the point of sale, involving unique barcodes, portable low-cost quality-control equipment, or other technical devices linked via smartphones and the internet. 6 WHO and national governments must establish concrete targets and a public accountability mechanism for assessing the performance of national regulatory authorities.

Indeed, the Commission contends that UHC both necessitates and can facilitate a change toward quality use of medicines. If health-care delivery and fi nancing systems do not focus on quality use of medicines-including using less expensive equivalent products when they are available-as a core system objective, they will waste resources on inappropriate use of medicines. In short, if measures are not taken, moving towards UHC can also increase the inappropriate use of medicines. Ghana's early experiences in expanding coverage showed that failure to address medicines use can threaten system sustainability. 282 In the USA between 1999 and 2010, substituting generic products for their brand-name counterparts saved the health system more than $1 trillion. 283 WHO has estimated that, if 18 common medicines were sold as lowest-price generics rather than originator brands, between 9% and 89% of costs could be saved across 17 countries, mostly MICs. 284 Inappropriate use of medicines, which is a longstanding challenge, becomes increasingly problematic as pharmacotherapy evolves. 96 Prescribing second-line and third-line treatments with higher prices when older, safer, fi rst-line therapies with lower prices are indicated and available, is inappropriate.

Two systematic reviews 311, 312 of evidence on interventions to improve health-worker behaviour have used the Eff ective Practice and Organization of Care criteria 313 for study quality and restricted their analyses to studies from LMICs only. In the fi rst, Holloway and colleagues 311 summarised the studies on the eff ects of well designed interventions to improve treatment of paediatric infections (n=44) and general outpatient prescribing (n=110). The median improvement in practice across all types of interventions in LMIC settings was modest (about 16% for the treatment of paediatric infections and 7% for general outpatient prescribing). 14, 311 Larger median eff ects tended to occur when multifaceted strategies combined several components (for example, education directed at both providers and consumers about the same medicine use issue), as compared with single strategies. Community case management programmes (in which community members are trained to recognise and treat common illnesses such as respiratory infections and diarrhoea, provided with medicines, and supervised in care delivery) had consistently positive eff ects that were notably higher than those of other strategies.",

Its preliminary results indicate that: \u2022 High-intensity training (more than 5 days and with an interactive training modality) combined with posttraining supervision is particularly eff ective, with a median improvement of 28% in LICs and 17% in MICs. \u2022 Interventions that engage health-worker teams in group problem solving, such as quality improvement collaboratives, combined with low-intensity training (less than 5 days or no interactive training modality), also have sizeable eff ects in LICs (median 45% improvement). However, most studies of these interventions had methodological limitations. \u2022 In MICs, supportive interventions for patients or community members combined with low-intensity training for health workers tended to have large eff ects (median 24% improvement); eff ectiveness increased when the intervention was combined with other management techniques and strengthening supervision, infrastructure, or governance (median 30% improvement). 314 IMCI involves algorithm-based and symptom-based treatment of common childhood illnesses, extensive health-worker training and supervision, and community sensitisation to improve illness recognition and care seeking. IMCI is the type of multi-component intervention that literature reviews suggest should be eff ective. However, national evaluation results were sobering. 315 Most countries found it challenging to scale up the strategy while maintaining fi delity to the approach. Community engagement was generally weak, and essential programme messages were not eff ectively communicated. Furthermore, programme reach suff ered because implementation exclusively relied on public sector delivery systems and failed to involve other sources of care. The assessments suggested that successful implementation of large national programmes to improve use of medicines requires more than specifi c technical design elements. Political commitment, dedicated human and fi nancial resources, coordinated policies and programmes, and meaningful engagement of various stakeholders are equally important. 315 ",

Key lessons learned from Medicines Transparency Alliance were: engaging stakeholders requires building trust and confi dence over time and creating a neutral environment for the stakeholders to work together; multi-stakeholder engagement alone was insuffi cient to create change; and careful disclosure of data was essential. 347, 348 Undertake concerted action to establish priorities and implement national interventions Appropriate use of medicines might be an individual behaviour, but it must be enabled by core system functions. Pharmaceutical systems are continuously changing as new products enter markets, evidence about best practices evolves, and information moves through medical and social networks. Clinician and patient choices change in response to these and other factors. These changes, in turn, determine the quality of care, effi ciency of health spending, achievement of positive health outcomes, and ultimately whether people are able to engage in the global development agenda. 349 A systematic and coherent process involving multiple stakeholders to promote quality use of medicines could be developed through the following concrete activities: Data adapted with permission from Sun and colleagues. 325 The comprehensive antibiotic stewardship programme in hospitals targeted outpatient antibiotic prescribing rates of <20% of patients and inpatient antibiotic prescribing rates of <60% of patients; antibiotic prophylaxis to be given before incision and not continued for more than 24 h; and total inpatient antibiotic consumption <400 defi ned daily doses per 1000 inpatient days.

Systems working toward UHC should invest in an independent local institution that can produce policy-relevant pharmaceutical analytics. The country context will infl uence both the appropriate structure and resource base to support an independent medicines-focused analytics unit. 2 Pharmaceutical analytics units must collaborate with multiple stakeholders in all relevant systems to increase their engagement in and accountability for quality use of medicines, and to intervene jointly on use of medicines problems. An analytics unit independent from public and private sector stakeholders is positioned to interact with multiple stakeholders, whose diverging objectives and behaviours might contribute to appropriate and inappropriate use of medicines, engaging them in information generation and analysis, intervention design, implementation, and monitoring and assessment. 3 Engaged stakeholder groups, led by data produced by the pharmaceutical analytics unit, should identify and prioritise local medicines use problems, identify contributing factors across the system, and develop and implement sustainable, long-term, multifaceted interventions. The process of multi-stakeholder engagement in a priority setting for national activities to promote quality use of medicines can result in better understanding of each stakeholder's underlying assumptions, motivations, and objectives. To succeed, there must be tangible benefi ts of such constructive engagement for all stakeholders.",

Under Article 58, the EMA provides scientifi c assessments, in coordination with WHO, of medicinal products for human use in markets outside the EU. 392 Since 2007, US federal legislation has allowed for priority review vouchers (PRVs). However, PRVs have been criticised because there is no provision that the product should be made available and aff ordable, and PRVs can also be used for products already registered outside of the USA or by a company that did not invest in the R&D. 378, 393 A marketed antituberculosis medicine, bedaquiline, was off ered for prices of around $3000 in MICs and $900 in LICs. Yet in the USA it was marketed for $30 000 per treatment, despite having received a PRV and fast-track approval by the US Food and Drug Administration. Eff orts are underway to include access and novelty requirements into the legislation. 394 New regulations to encourage paediatric medicine development have been introduced by the USA 395 and the EU. 396 As of 2008, all new applications in the EU must include data for children (0-17 years) unless a specifi c waiver is approved. An increase in new paediatric formulations is possible, 397 yet the costs to society might become higher than the actual R&D investment. Whether these innovations meet priority needs or are primarily used to extend the market exclusivity of products with predominantly adult indications remains unclear. 398, 399 In 2016, the EU initiated a review of R&D incentive mechanisms, including those for paediatric R&D, to strengthen the balance of pharmaceutical systems in Europe. 400 Regulatory approval of new essential medicines poses great challenges, for example with onerous studies needed for new paediatric formulations 401 or assessments of new medicines for neglected diseases not prevalent in countries with stringent regulatory authorities. The Commission asserts that assessments of new medicines for neglected diseases should be led by regulatory authorities in the aff ected areas. These institutions will probably need further strengthening to do such reviews, through enhanced collaboration with stringent regulatory authorities and the WHO/UN Prequalifi cation Programme (section 3). Regional regulatory initiatives within zones with similar disease patterns should also be supported.",

The MPP initially focused on patents related to HIV medicines to promote low-cost generic production and the development of fi xed-dose combinations and paediatric formulations. The MPP has expanded its mandate to cover hepatitis C and tuberculosis. In November, 2015, the MPP signed an agreement with Bristol-Myers Squibb that allows supply of generic daclatasvir in 112 LMICs. 32 Separate from the MPP, Gilead Sciences Inc has licensed patents for its hepatitis C virus medicines for use in 101 LMICs. 31 Unfortunately, some MICs are excluded from these licences and must continue to rely on TRIPS fl exibilities to access low-priced generics (appendix 5). Generics companies that produce hepatitis C virus and HIV medicines under a licence agreement with the MPP and Gilead Sciences Inc are mostly allowed to supply generic product to a country that makes use of TRIPS fl exibilities. 170 After 5 years of operation of the MPP, millions of people have benefi ted and impressive fi nancial savings have been achieved (panel 20).

However, it is increasingly clear that this approach endangers the progressive realisation of global health equity objectives and human rights. The global community has laid out a vision of health care as a human right in treaties such as the 1966 International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, which enshrined the right to health and was ratifi ed by more than 160 countries. The right to essential medicines is a key component of the right to health, 60, 62 and this also implies certain human rights obligations for pharmaceutical companies. 79 Some pharmaceutical companies fail to acknowledge their unique role in society as the providers of life-saving medicines. One assessment of fi ve large pharmaceutical companies showed that their corporate social responsibility approaches were inconsistently applied. 419 In some cases, offi cial company credos are not in fact refl ected in the company's actions. For example, Johnson & Johnson publicly commits to striving to reduce costs and maintain reasonable prices, yet the company does not license its HIV medicines patents to the MPP; 420 and one HIV medicine, darunavir, was priced at $810 per patient per year in certain LMIC markets for both a 600 mg dose and only declined to $663 by 2015. 421 In the USA, the price of Novartis' imatinib for the treatment of chronic myeloid 423 It also vigorously defends its patents in LMICs that strive to have access to imatinib. 424, 425 AbbVie charges MICs $740 per patient per year for lopinavir/ritonavir (more than twice the price of $231 per patient per year in LDCs); this price has not changed since 2012. A price of more than $3500 per patient per year was quoted for lopinavir/ ritonavir in 2014 in Malaysia. Investors' profi t-seeking has been blamed when companies fail to arrange for access pricing. 426 Pharmaceutical manufacturers in LMICs are also expected to contribute to public health needs. However, many fail to produce essential medicines, or to produce them according to acceptable quality standards (panel 9). 174 Academic institutions, when seeking to increase the commercial value of their research, also have an insuffi cient focus on developing missing essential medicines. 427",

Yet as previously described, industrial investment in R&D for neglected diseases remains very low. In 2013, public and private investment for R&D in 34 neglected diseases was $3\u00b72 billion, of which pharmaceutical corporations only contributed $401 million. The latter amount represents only 0\u00b78% of total industrial R&D spending of $51\u00b72 billion in 2014. 435 Not-for-profi t R&D initiatives have compensated for some defi ciencies of the current system, but they cannot provide a permanent solution to the underlying fundamental problem of an innovation system relying on market exclusivity. The Commission believes that governments need to proactively set public health-based research priorities for so-called essential R&D and not leave these priorities to pharmaceutical manufacturers. Governments also need to fi nance new models of biomedical innovation that address access from the early stages of development, such as the Global Health Innovative Technology based in Japan. The massive spending on pharmaceuticals through increasingly higher pricing of medicines can be repurposed to shape a new R&D framework.

            "text": "The need for new global approaches was reinforced by UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon's call for a new deal at the establishment of the High-Level Panel for Access to Medicines in November 2015. 444 The scope of this panel's investigation was \"to review and assess proposals and recommend solutions for remedying the policy incoherence between the justifi able rights of inventors, international human rights law, trade rules and public health in the context of health technologies.\" 444 WHO member states will continue to discuss the monitoring, coordination, and fi nancing of health R&D, taking into account the report of the UN Panel 445 and that of the WHO Consultative Expert Working Group on Research and Development: Financing and Co ordination, 446 which recommended the establishment of a biomedical R&D treaty (panel 21). The talks about a new R&D framework are likely to be intensely political, as were the negotiations for the GSPA. It will be important for clear R&D priorities to inform this process. 451 The necessary practical details of a new medical R&D framework will need to be negotiated. These global discussions on R&D priorities provide opportunities for national governments, WHO, and the UN to fulfi l their obligations to present a bold new global framework for achieving the dual objectives of health-need driven R&D and equitable access to its products. 452, 453 Pooling patents of new essential medicines promotes universal access to innovation On the basis of the positive outcomes of the MPP, the Commission concludes that there is a wide scope for patent pooling for other essential medicines (as defi ned by WHO or national committees). To this end, the current MPP could be expanded into an Essential MPP (or EMPP). This expansion would create an opportunity for companies to license patents for the purpose of creating a competitive generic market of essential medicines, in line with their responsibility to protect and promote human rights. 454 Patents of medicines developed under the new research agreement or new fi nancing mechanisms could also be licensed. The EMPP should use a tiered royalty system to remunerate patent holders and to contribute to R&D expenditure at levels proportionate to the economies of the countries where the medicines are used. 455 The Commission notes that a patent owner's refusal to license an essential medicine to the EMPP would satisfy the condition for granting a compulsory licence under TRIPS Article 31, which requires the grantee to have made eff orts to obtain authorisation from the right holder on reasonable commercial terms and conditions. 456 There is no such requirement in cases of national emergency, extreme urgency, or public non-commercial use. 456 Governments should also ensure that national patent legislation allows for easy deployment of TRIPS fl exibilities, eff ective automatic licensing of essential medicines in the absence of voluntary agreements, and regulatory rules for protection of test data that provide the necessary fl exibility to register products submitted by licensees (see also section 2). 457 The pharmaceutical industry should live up to its special responsibilities Instances of important achievements when industry is open to collaboration are apparent. Examples have included the MPP, collaborative research for vaccines, 458 and neglected diseases research. In recent years, some Panel 21: An international agreement on research and development (R&D) 447 Several proposals have been made for an international agreement on medical R&D to achieve the two objectives of fi nancing needed innovations, and equitable access to those innovations. Key features of such an agreement include: \u2022 R&D priorities driven by health needs rather than commercial potential \u2022 Binding obligations on governments to invest in R&D \u2022 Equitable distribution of contributions across countries \u2022 Measures to improve the regulatory environment \u2022 Measures to ensure aff ordability of the end product \u2022 Access-maximising licensing practices to deal with intellectual property issues \u2022 Innovative approaches to promote R&D while delinking its cost from the ultimate sale price",

This should include developing a list of missing essential medicines, within the context of the WHO Global Health R&D observatory and in close connection with the WHO Model List of Essential Medicines. The WHO mechanism to identify missing essential medicines should be further developed, with the involvement of all relevant stakeholders. 2 Governments must lead the process towards a global R&D policy framework and agreements, which include new fi nancing mechanisms to ensure that missing essential medicines are developed and made aff ordable. Such mechanisms should be based on transparent estimates of the real cost of R&D; they might include a pooled fund for global health R&D, prize funds, targeted research partnerships and advance market agreements, and licensing of related patents, leading to an increasing number of new priority products with an aff ordable price which is delinked from R&D costs (known as progressive delinking). 3 ",

Promoting equity in access to essential medicines must be a key priority. Throughout the report, the Commission noted the special importance of essential medicines policies that contribute to achieving equity. Disaggregating data ensures that diff erent strata of society are well represented and can be compared when measuring the eff ect of such policies. 2 Strengthening institutions: throughout the report, the Commission identifi ed a range of specialised knowledge and skills required to implement essential medicines policies, as well as to collect and analyse data for decision making and accountability. These capacities cannot rest solely with a single person in a country. For sustainability and accountability, institutional structures and processes must be created and supported to develop, administer, implement, and assess policies. One key structure and process is an independent review mechanism that can identify when corrective action is necessary. The capacities of various institutions to carry out these tasks must be strengthened through the establishment of explicit mandates, the assurance of independence, and the provision of dedicated funding. 3 Promoting accountability: accountability refers to a responsibility to meet specifi c obligations, and for actors to answer to one another in a public and transparent process. 462 The ultimate aims of UHCimproving health status, protecting against fi nancial catastrophe due to illness, and achieving patient satisfaction-require commitment and concerted action by governments and other partners. Governments must demonstrate to citizens that their policies, and the institutions and administrative mechanisms that implement policies, are accomplishing these goals. Increasingly, governments are also agreeing to demonstrate progress to the international community, as with the SDGs. To track change, data must be collected, analysed, and shared with stakeholders. Accountability requires transparency in decision making and about the results of independent assessments of interventions. 463 Stakeholder participation in the processes of decision making also promotes accountability; benefi ciaries must be represented whenever decisions are made on their behalf. Civil society participation is key to representing the public at large, as well as to protecting particular subgroups. 464 These cross-cutting themes align with broader global agendas for the SDGs, UHC, and strengthening of health systems, and the progressive realisation of the human right to health. The 24 core indicators the Commission recommends are intended to complement those being developed for the SDGs, including the WHO 100 Core Health Indicators. 465 Initiatives such as the Medicines Transparency Alliance 348, 466 and the WHO Good Governance for Medicines 467 approach have made substantial, but insuffi cient, contributions to increasing transparency related to medicines; eff orts need to be expanded.

One of the indicators included in this set-household expenditure on pharmaceuticals as a percentage of total household expenditure-is a measure of fi nancial protection. To measure progress on reducing disparities related to fi nancing essential medicines, household expenditure on pharmaceuticals as a percentage of total household expenditure should be disaggregated by income, ethnicity, education, geography, and other relevant characteristics (such as households with a member living with NCDs). Since household data on expenditure is often separate from data on the health status of household members, it can be diffi cult to meaningfully measure equity with existing datasets. 15 Indicators for fi nancing depend on household surveys to obtain data on household expenditures on pharmaceuticals, including out-of-pocket expenditure. Yet many countries still lack routinely collected and nationally representative household data. 15 Measuring progress towards UHC provide an opportunity to integrate the indicators into a wider SDG-monitoring framework.",

Three of the indicators to measure comparable information on prices of medicines and availability have already been used extensively, including two that are standard indicators in the World Health Statistics. 139 Ensuring that information on price is available depends on several prerequisites. The prices of essential medicines must be monitored regularly at several points along the supply chain, from procurement prices in the public and private sectors (including hospitals), to retail consumption. The prices of individual products should be collected and reported to provide a mean price ratio that can be combined with maximal and minimal values for individual products. 135 It is rare for hospital procurement prices to be openly available. 478 Health insurance funds can play a key part in collecting and publicising reimbursement price information.",

The EMPP should use a For more on the WHO Global Health R&D Observatory see http://www.who.int/ research-observatory/about/en/ tiered royalty system to remunerate the patent holder and to contribute to R&D expenditure. 4 Governments and national stakeholders must develop and implement comprehensive national action plans to guarantee equitable access to new essential medicines, including open knowledge innovation, fair licensing practices, support for a patent pool for essential medicines, full use of TRIPS fl exibilities when needed, and rejecting TRIPS-plus provisions.5 The pharmaceutical industry must better align its R&D priority setting with global health needs, and develop access strategies to make medically important innovations available to all in need. To this end the industry could determine a certain percentage of its profi ts to reinvest in R&D for medicines that are not commercially attractive, but are deemed essential from a public health perspective. Equitable access strategies should include broad licensing of patents and technology transfer to enable generic medicines production; and equitable pricing mechanisms. The policies and practices of pharmaceutical companies should be independently assessed by international mechanisms, such as the ATM Index.",
