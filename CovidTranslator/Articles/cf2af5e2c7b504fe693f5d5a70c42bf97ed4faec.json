This is the first trial to examine the herbal therapy of combined yunzhi and danshen on quality of life among breast cancer patients. Methods: A multicenter, longitudinal, and self-control study was used. Eighty-two breast cancer patients were given combined yunzhi and danshen capsules for six months on a daily basis. Data collection including quality of life, vitality status and adverse effects were taken. Results: Results showed a significant improvement in physical function, role-physical, roleemotion and health transition (P , 0.05). Patients also reported less fatigue, better quality of sleep, better appetite, more regular bowel movements and more stable emotions (P , 0.05). As far as side-effects were concerned, only mild discomforts including sore throat (13.4%) and dry mouth (9.8%) were recorded. Conclusion: The findings add clinical evidence to support the beneficial effects of herbal therapy on quality of life and vitality status in breast cancer patients. Therefore, herbal therapy has a potentially important role to play in managing psychological distress in cancer patients. This study also suggests that herbal therapy is clinically acceptable and can be used safely with breast cancer patients.",

Such complications result in poor psychological adjustment, vitality status and quality of life. 2 Mounting evidence indicates that herbal therapy is effective in alleviating anxiety, lessening cancer treatment-related side-effects, and facilitating rehabilitation. [2] [3] [4] The mushrooms yunzhi (Coriolus versicolor) and danshen (Salviae miltiorrhiza) are two commonly-used herbs for cancer prevention. 5 The results of clinical trials have further shown that the addition of yunzhi to radiotherapy and chemotherapy treatment for cancer patients could greatly improve their clinical symptoms and stabilize their immune function, thus greatly improving their quality of life. [5] [6] [7] [8] However, methodological flaws in these studies, including a small sample size, have limited the generalizability of their findings.

Patients were excluded if they had cancer in both breasts or cancer metastases were present, had abnormal liver and renal function, were either pregnant or breastfeeding, had a significant history of drug hypersensitivity, or were taking other alternative medicine or supplements. Based on previous studies, there is a 7%-10% difference in the quality of life between women with and without breast cancer. 15, 16 Taking a conservative approach, an 11% increase in the quality of life was used as the primary outcome. Eighty-two patients were required in order to detect group differences at a 5% two-sided significance level with a power of 90% and an attrition rate of 20%.",

All subjects were asked whether they had experienced any discomfort or adverse events, by means of an open-ended question at each study visit. Particular instances of discomfort or adverse events were then sorted into 3 categories: 'Hot Constitution' for complaints such as cold sore or sore throat; 'Cold Constitution' for dizziness or diarrhea; and 'Others' for vomiting or stomach discomfort. This classification was suggested by a Chinese medicine practitioner and based on established terminology used in Chinese medical literature. 18 Blood tests were carried out to assess renal and liver function and to ensure that the YZDS treatment was not endangering patients' safety. Serious adverse events were recorded in the serious adverse events form and reported within 24 hours to the Ethics Committee.",

As nearly all the participants were afraid of a recurrence of cancer, 97% of them breached the terms of the study by taking their own herbal supplements, and over half (60%) were found to be taking 2 or more types of health supplement at the same time. The scale of this subversive behavior became apparent 4 months after the commencement of the study. We decided that the best and most practical course of action was to convert the study into a self-control comparative study without placebo, to ensure that the participants would comply with the study protocol.
