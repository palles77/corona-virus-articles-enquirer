Blood samples were obtained from farmed or nomadic camels by jugular vein puncture. Serum samples originated from the archives of the International Livestock and Research Institute (ILRI) (Nairobi, Kenya). Ethical clearance for collection was part of the agreement between the Government of Kenya and ILRI, which provided ILRI with approval to broadly investigate livestock disease in Kenya.",

We used the assay-specific cutoff (optical density ratio 0.3) that had been validated in a previous study of camel serum samples (13) . A total of 228 (29.5%) of 774 dromedary camels were rated MERS-CoV positive by the rELISA (Table 1 ). All 228 rELISA-positive serum samples from these 228 camels were subsequently tested at a 1:40 dilution by using an established recombinant immunofluorescence assay and Vero cells expressing MERS-CoV spike protein (6) . This confirmatory assay showed that 213 (93.4%) of 228 rELISA-positive serum samples had MERS-CoV antibodies ( Table 1) .",

Our finding of MERS-CoV antibodies in dromedary camels as early as 1992 is consistent with findings of a recent report from Saudi Arabia, which suggested that MERS-CoV has been circulating in dromedary camels for \u226520 years (5) . To project and potentially control virus spread, the public health community must understand factors determining virus maintenance. Our group and others have demonstrated that young dromedary camels have lower seroprevalences and are more likely to carry infectious virus (5,6). Similar observations have been made for coronaviruses in their original chiropteran hosts wherein strong virus amplification occurred soon after the time of parturition (15) . Young, immunologically naive animals may thus facilitate virus amplification in dromedary camel populations.",

Dromedary camels in this area are often nomadic following rainfall patterns, and are taken across borders into neighboring countries, such as Ethiopia, for trade purposes (13) . The observed increase in seropositivity from the Western region to the Northeastern and Eastern regions could be attributed to increased animal-to-animal contact in cross-border dromedary camel metapopulations.",

(11), our findings might facilitate the search for more ancestral MERS-CoV variants to clarify the natural history of acquisition of MERS-CoV by dromedary camels and its putative transmission to humans. Our recent finding of a MERS-CoV ancestor in bats from South Africa (3) highlights the need for wider investigations of viral reservoirs. The fact that no human MERS cases have been observed in eastern Africa could indicate less transmissibility of viruses in regional lineages or lack of detection and reporting of cases. Serosurveys of persons handling dromedary camels in this region could help to determine whether silent or unrecognized infections are being maintained in humans.",

B) Detailed map of Kenya showing sampling sites in 7 counties (Turkana, Baringo, Laikipia, Marsabit, Isiolo, Mandera, and Wajir) for Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Counties were assigned to 3 regions named after the former administrative provinces of Rift Valley, Eastern, and Northeastern (left to right). The 3 sampling regions are indicated in shades of green and other counties are indicated in gray. Percentages of camels positive for antibodies against MERS-CoV are shown with the density of camels (individuals/km 2 ) for the analyzed regions during 2 periods (1991-2000 and 2000-2013). Serosurveys were performed during 1992-2013. Camel population numbers were determined for 1991-2000 and 2000-2013. Maps were created by using data from http://www.naturalearthdata.com.",
