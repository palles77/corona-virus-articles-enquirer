In this study, we showed that lipid rafts also play an important role in the life cycle of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-coronavirus (CoV). Cholesterol depletion by pretreatment of Vero E6 cells with methyl-b-cyclodextrin (MbCD) inhibited the production of SARS-CoV particles released from the infected cells. This inhibition was prevented by addition of cholesterol to the culture medium, indicating that the reduction of virus particle release was caused by the loss of cholesterol in the cell membrane. In contrast, cholesterol depletion at the post-entry stage (3 h post-infection) caused only a limited effect on virus particle release. Northern blot analysis revealed that the levels of viral mRNAs were significantly affected by pretreatment with MbCD, but not by treatment at 3 h postinfection. Interestingly, no apparent evidence for colocalization of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 with lipid rafts in the membrane of Vero E6 cells was obtained. These results suggest that lipid rafts could contribute to SARS-CoV infection in the early replication process in Vero E6 cells.",

Human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1), Semliki Forest virus and some human enteroviruses require lipid rafts during the binding and internalization of virus particles into host cells [2e4] . Interestingly, the receptors or co-receptors for certain viruses have been reported to be associated with lipid rafts on cell membranes, such as CD4 for HIV-1 [5] , heat shock proteins 70 and 90 for dengue virus [6] and integrin avb3 for human cytomegalovirus [7] . Raft microenvironments also provide a platform for virus assembly as well as viral release. In the case of influenza virus, for example, both the cytoplasmic tail and the transmembrane domain of one of the viral proteins, hemagglutinin, facilitate the binding of another viral protein, matrix 1, to detergent-resistant lipid rafts [8] . Similarly, lipid rafts were also shown to be necessary for the assembly of HIV-1 [9] and Sendai virus [10] . Several enveloped viruses contain lipid rafts on their membranes, and cholesterol depletion by MbCD was shown to inactivate and permeabilize the virions, suggesting the importance of virus-associated cholesterol for infectivity [11, 12] . Furthermore, Nef protein of HIV-1 is reported to be able to increase the infectivity of HIV-1 via lipid rafts [13] . Therefore, lipid rafts could play important roles not only in virus replication but also in viral pathogenesis.",

These infected cells were cultured for 18 h. The virus production in the resulting culture fluid was assayed by titration on Vero E6 cells, as described in Section 2. The results were expressed as TCID 50 per ml. As shown in Fig. 2A , MbCD treatment impaired the virus production at a dosedependent manner, suggesting that the cholesterol is necessary for the replication of SARS-CoV in Vero E6 cells. The impairment of the virus production was more apparent in cells infected with lower MOIs of SARS-CoV. To confirm the importance of cholesterol for SARS-CoV replication in Vero E6 cells, after depletion of cellular cholesterol by pretreatment with 10 mM MbCD for 30 min, cholesterol was added back (Treat:\u00c00.5 \u00fe CHO) and then the virus production after replenishment was similarly investigated (Fig. 2B) . The cholesterol replenishment could restore the virus production in all cases, as evidenced by similar levels of viral production as in untreated cells. These results suggest that the reduction of virus production was specifically due to the cholesterol depletion, and this effect was reversible. Next, we attempted to find out whether depletion of lipid rafts after the early stage of SARS-CoV life cycle has an inhibitory effect on virus production. Vero E6 cells were infected with SARS-CoV, and after incubation for 3 h, the cells were treated with MbCD (Treat:\u00fe3). At 18 hpi, virus production in the culture fluid was examined.

In addition, pretreated and untreated cells were similarly infected and at 3 hpi, cells were treated with MbCD (Treat:\u00fe3) and infected cells were incubated for another 3 h. When the viral mRNAs from the cells were compared, we found that at 6 hpi, cells pretreated with MbCD showed a significantly lower level of mRNA than untreated cells, but both types of cells showed much higher levels of viral mRNAs than at 3 hpi, indicating that mRNAs synthesis was proceeded successfully. The treatment with MbCD at 3 hpi caused only a moderate effect, suggesting that the reduction of viral mRNA synthesis may have resulted from the blockage of an early process before starting the synthesis of viral messages. In addition, when immunofluorescence was performed to examine the viral antigen expression level using a MAb against SARS-CoV S protein, a clear reduction of viral antigen expression at 6 hpi was observed in the cells pretreated with 10 mM MbCD when infected at an MOI of 10 (data not shown).",

Since the cholesterol level in cell membranes was shown to be able to gradually increase to a similar level to that in untreated cells at 7e9 h post-treatment, the susceptibility of the cells to SARS-CoV infection might also have recovered, which would enable the next round of infection, especially when we infected the cells at higher MOI.

We therefore examined the ACE2 expression level after MbCD treatment by flow cytometry. The result showed that MbCD treatment slightly decreased the expression level of ACE2 in the cell membrane at a dose-dependent manner. Thus, there might be some association between ACE2 and lipid rafts in the cell membrane. However, membrane flotation assays showed that ACE2 was not colocalized with lipid rafts in Vero E6 cells either uninfected or adsorbed with SARS-CoV. This result may be consistent with another report showing that ACE2 were not raft-colocalized in CHO cells [27] . In the case of HIV-1, major receptor CD4 is localized in lipid rafts, whereas the coreceptor CXCR4 is not directly associated with lipid rafts [5] . However, CXCR4 functionally requires cholesterol in target cells membranes [28] . Consequently, the discrepancy obtained by flow cytometry and membrane flotation assay in our study may be explained by the possible presence of unknown host factor(s) that could be localized in lipid rafts and play a role in the virus entry. SARS-CoV is known to utilize both endocytosis and fusion process to enter host cells [29] . Both pathways could be impaired by the extraction of cholesterol from cell membrane [1] .

Lipid raft membrane structures were shown to be required for the entry, but not the viral particle release of MHV. The cellular receptor for MHV, CEACAM-1, was not enriched in raft-containing membranes. Cholesterol depletion had no effect on the binding of the virus to the cells; however, virus entry and virus-induced fusion were impaired, suggesting that cholesterol might be required at a post-binding stage [20] . In the case of another coronavirus, human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E), the cellular receptor CD13 was shown to be localized in the lipid rafts. The colocalization of HCoV-229E and caveolin-1 occurred under physical conditions; however, depletion of cholesterol by pretreatment with MbCD reduced the colocalization without a significant effect on the binding of virus to cells. The depletion of cholesterol with MbCD significantly reduced the HCoV-229E redistribution and subsequent infection [30] .",

For detection of GM-1, the same fractions were dot-blotted and reacted with cholera toxin-peroxidase. Finally, these blots were visualized using the ECL Protein Detection System.",
