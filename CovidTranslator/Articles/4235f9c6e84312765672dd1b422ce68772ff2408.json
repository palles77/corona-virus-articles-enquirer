            "text": "To study the molecular basis of TGEV tropism, a collection of recombinants between the PUR46-MAD strain of transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV) infecting the enteric and respiratory tracts and the PTV strain, which only infects the respiratory tract, was generated. The recombinant isolation frequency was about 10 09 recombinants per nucleotide and was 3.7-fold higher at the 5-end of the S gene than in other areas of the genome. Thirty recombinants were plaque purified and characterized phenotypically and genetically. All recombinant viruses had a single crossover and had inherited the 5and 3-halves of their genome from the enteric and respiratory parents, respectively. Recombinant viruses were classified into three groups, named 1 to 3, according to the location of the crossover. Group 1 recombinants had the crossover in the S gene, while in Groups 2 and 3 the crossovers were located in ORF1b and ORF1a, respectively. The tropism of the recombinants was studied. Recombinants of Group 1 had enteric and respiratory tropism, while Group 2 recombinants infected the respiratory, but not the enteric, tract. Viruses of both groups differed by two nucleotide changes at positions 214 and 655. Both changes may be in principle responsible for the loss of enteric tropism but only the change in nucleotide 655 was specifically found in the respiratory isolates and most likely this single nucleotide change, which leads to a substitution in amino acid 219 of the S protein, was responsible for the loss of enteric tropism in the closely related PUR-46 isolates. The available data indicate that in order to infect enteric tract cells with TGEV, two different domains of the S protein, mapping between amino acids 522 and 744 and around amino acid 219, respectively, are involved. The first domain binds to porcine aminopeptidase N, the cellular receptor for TGEV. In the other domain maps a second factor of undefined nature but which may be the binding site for a coreceptor essential for the enteric tropism of TGEV. \u1b67 1997 Academic Press",

In fact, recent studies (Godet et al., 1994) showed However, it can not be excluded that other viral genes, that baculovirus-expressed polypeptides corresponding apart from the S gene, could be involved in the determination of the tropism of TGEV. In fact, changes in ORF3a have been associated with the loss of enteric tropism.",

In agreement with these data, it was shown that porcine APN, the receptor for TGEV (Delmas et al., while Group 1 replicated in the epithelial cells of both the enteric and respiratory tracts.

Nevertheless, this not infect the enteric tract. This apparent discrepancy could be explained if an interaction between pAPN and possibility seems unlikely because most enteric viruses have the same nucleotide as PTV at position 214 (S\u00e1 n-two domains of S protein located at both areas (amino acids near residue 219 and amino acids 522 to 744) are chez et al., 1992), indicating that most likely a single nucleotide change at position 655 was responsible for required to infect the enteric tract. Alternatively, a putative second factor, such as coreceptor, mapping around the loss of enteric tropism. Nucleotides 214 and 655 are located within the area of the S gene which is deleted amino acid 219 of the spike protein could be specifically required to infect the enteric tract and responsible for in PRCVs, strongly suggesting that this deletion was responsible for the loss of enteric tropism in PRCVs. In the loss of enteric tropism in PTV and PRCV isolates. Other explanations are also possible and the loss on human immunodeficiency and other virus systems it has also been shown that a single point mutation can alter enteric tropism could also be due to: (i) a decrease in the pH stability required to allow the virus passage tropism (Takeuchi et al., 1991) .",

Two TGEV strains, PUR46-MAD and PTV-ts-dmar (seeFig. 1) with enteric and respiratory tropism, respectively, were used to coinfect ST cells at a m.o.i. of 20 for each virus. As a first step, selective pressure based only on restrictive temperature was used. To minimize virus neutralization due to the formation of chimeras containing spike proteins from both parental viruses, the supernatant from ST cells coinfected with the two viruses was used to infect a new ST cell monolayer with a m.o.i. \u00a3 0.5. This supernatant was collected at 12 h.p.i., neutralized with the MAbs 1C.C12 and 1D.E7, and then used to plaque isolate recombinant viruses at restrictive temperature.

The position of mutations used in the selection of recombinant viruses is indicated; tr or ts represent temperature resistance or sensitivity, respectively, A // and A 00 represent the presence or the absence, respectively, of the antigenic subsites Aa, and part of Ab of S protein. Coinfection of the ST cell culture with the two parental viruses generated three kinds of recombinant viruses. The first had inherited the ts mutation from the PTV-ts-dmar strain and the position A // from the PUR46-MAD strain.
