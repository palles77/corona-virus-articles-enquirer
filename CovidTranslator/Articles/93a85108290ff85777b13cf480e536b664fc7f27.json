Satellite telemetry was used on nine flying-foxes of three species (Pteropus alecto n = 5, P. vampyrus n = 2, and P. neohibernicus n = 2) to determine the scale and pattern of their long-distance movements and their potential to transfer these viruses between countries in the region. The animals were captured and released from six different locations in Australia, Papua New Guinea, Indonesia, and Timor-Leste. Their movements were recorded for a median of 120 (range, 47-342) days with a median total distance travelled of 393 (range, 76-3011) km per individual. Pteropus alecto individuals were observed to move between Australia and Papua New Guinea (Western Province) on four occasions, between Papua New Guinea (Western Province) and Indonesia (Papua) on ten occasions, and to traverse Torres Strait on two occasions. Pteropus vampyrus was observed to move between Timor-Leste and Indonesia (West Timor) on one occasion. These findings expand upon the current literature on the potential for transfer of zoonotic viruses by flying-foxes between countries and have implications for disease risk management and for the conservation management of flying-fox populations in Australia, New Guinea, and the Lesser Sunda Islands.",

The risk of disease posed by geographic translocation of bats has been reviewed (Constantine, 2003) with many cited examples of natural and anthropogenic movement of bats found to be infected with potentially fatal zoonotic pathogens.",

Several species have very large geographical ranges and may exhibit partially migratory or nomadic lifestyles with food availability likely to be the most significant factor driving movement patterns (Fleming and Eby, 2003) . Previous studies of the long-distance movement of flying-foxes have used radiotelemetry and banding techniques. However, these approaches have limited application due to the spatial scale involved. Satellite telemetry has the potential to overcome this limitation and has been utilized to track a small number of individuals of Pteropus poliocephalus, Pteropus vampyrus, and Eidolon helvum (Tidemann and Nelson, 2004; Richter and Cumming, 2008; Epstein et al., 2009) .",

Nipah virus also has been detected by PCR in P. lylei from Thailand (Wacharapluesadee et al., 2005) and evidence of exposure to henipaviruses or related viruses has been reported from bats in Indonesia (Sendow et al., 2009) , China (Li et al., 2008) , Bangladesh (Hsu et al., 2004) , India (Epstein et al., 2008) , Madagascar (Iehle et al., 2007) , and Ghana (Hayman et al., 2008) . The potential for overlap in distribution of Hendra and Nipah viruses and for flying-foxes to act as vectors for long-distance transmission of these viruses is largely unknown. Nipah virus, which (in Bangladesh) has transmitted directly from human to human, appears to pose a greater threat to human populations than Hendra virus because it has been responsible for many more human deaths, and has so far had much greater economic impact (Field et al., 2007; Wacharapluesadee et al. 2009 ).",

(2009) that members of the Pteropus genus are able to travel very long distances, with one of the P. alecto individuals (bat D) that we tracked travelling more than 3,000 km during an 11-month period. The study also has recorded several movements of flying-foxes across national boundaries, indicating the potential for transmission of pathogens between countries. A comparable situation has been recently documented in Africa with the long-distance movement and potential for disease transmission by the straw-colored fruit bat (E. helvum) between Zambia and the Democratic Republic of Congo (see Richter and Cumming, 2008) . Design limitations inherent in most telemetry studies mean that generalization of findings of the few studied individuals to populations as a whole need to be made with care. In this study, animals were nonrandomly selected and individuals were captured and released at different times of year with only three of nine being monitored for more than 6 months. Nevertheless, the results show that considerable distances can be travelled by at least some individuals in the population and are relevant to both wildlife management and animal and public health authorities. Richter and Cumming (2008) highlight the importance of transmitter weight in telemetry studies of bats with the transmitters in their study constituting 3.1-4.0% (mean 3.7%; n = 4) of the animal's bodyweight. The transmitters used in the present study constituted a smaller proportion of bodyweight at 2.0-3.0% (mean 2.5%; n = 9), hence reducing potential effects on behavior of the bats. The particularly large size of flying-foxes and their tendency to fly above the forest canopy make them suitable candidates among bats for the application of satellite telemetry technology.",

A 12-month radiotelemetry study of P. alecto in northern Australia by Palmer and Woinarski (1999) showed a maximum roost-to-roost movement of 133 km, with a mean of 35 km; Woinarski et al. (2007) reported an approximate 25 km crossing over sea from mainland Australia to Melville and Bathurst Islands for this species. However, a genetic study of P. alecto in eastern and northern Australia, using allozyme electrophoresis, has indicated a high level of gene flow among populations, suggesting long-distance movements may indeed occur among populations within Australia (Webb and Tidemann, 1996) .",

In the present study, the movement patterns have shown this species forages among islands in the Fly River delta with a radius of 73 and 31 km covered by bats F and G respectively, less than some P. alecto (139, 175, and 248 km radii for bats A, C, and D, respectively).

This is consistent with the fact that P. neohibernicus has never been reported from Australia, including the Torres Strait islands, although it occurs on mainland New Guinea immediately north of this area.",

            "text": "It has been suggested that Pteropus vampyrus is comprised of five subspecies (Simmons, 2005) . However, genetic studies, incorporating all claimed subspecies, do not show differentiation, thus suggesting high levels of gene flow between populations in peninsular Malaysia, Sumatra, Java, Borneo, and the Lesser Sunda Islands (Olival, 2008) . Individuals of this species have been recorded travelling up to 50 km per night and flying short distances between islands to forage (Mickleburgh et al., 1992) . In the present study, P. vampyrus yielded the least data of the three species monitored in terms of duration of transmission, with a combined total of only 94 days of movements being recorded. Bat I moved from Timor-Leste to Indonesian West Timor, and both individuals showed foraging activity in areas of cultivated plants and human settlements. The apparent limited mobility of these bats is at odds with other studies (below), and it is possible that our findings are confounded by the limited duration of transmission, which may have precluded seasonal or biological pressures that induce greater distance movement. Satellite telemetry has previously been used to track the movements of P. vampyrus in peninsular Malaysia and Sumatra with four animals travelling across approximately 50 km of open sea (the Strait of Malacca) from peninsular Malaysia to Sumatra, and later returning to peninsular Malaysia (Daszak et al., 2006; Olival and Higuchi, 2006; Epstein et al., 2009) . The movements of three bats, tracked for 84-112 days, and travelling average distances of 26, 30, and 58 km per week (total distances 360, 810, and 420 km) (Olival and Higuchi, 2006) were greater than the distances travelled by P. vampyrus in the present study (11 and 19 km per week), and comparable to those of P. alecto and P. neohibernicus.",

Neutralizing antibodies to Hendra virus have been found in P. neohibernicus from the north coast of Papua New Guinea (Mackenzie, 1999) , and neutralizing antibodies to Nipah virus have been found in P. vampyrus on peninsular Malaysia (Johara et al., 2001) , Java and Sumatra (Sendow et al., 2006) . Thus, each of these pteropid species has the potential to transmit Nipah or Hendra viruses. The frequency and scale of transboundary movements add to the findings of previous studies and further demonstrate the potential for the introduction of henipaviruses and other bat-associated infectious diseases to adjacent populations, and/or indicate the likelihood of this having occurred in the past.",

Similarly P. scapulatus is widespread in northern Australia, including the Torres Strait islands but has only been reported from New Guinea on one occasion (Waithman, 1979) . Our study suggests that for P. alecto, Torres Strait seems to be readily traversable and that a contiguous population of P. alecto may occur from northern Australia, through the TransFly region of Papua New Guinea into southeast Papua, Indonesia. Hence, the flying-foxes in these three areas may share the same pathogens, including henipaviruses and others, such as lyssaviruses and Dengue virus.",

They are taxa of high conservation concern; 27 of the 52 Pteropus species are considered threatened with extinction, with hunting and habitat loss identified as the main drivers of population declines (IUCN, 2010) . The hunting of flying-foxes for food occurs across the area covered by this study and increasingly frequent contact between bats and humans may facilitate disease spillover. The present study shows the potential for close connectivity between flying-fox populations on the Australian and New Guinean land masses, and underscores the importance of consultative crossborder approaches in disease risk management and conservation planning. It also suggests the possibility that P. alecto may range more widely than P. neohibernicus, highlighting the potential heterogeneity of movement patterns among flying-fox species. A thorough understanding of flying-fox movement dynamics and the processes that drive them is a necessary prerequisite for mapping the risk of emergence of infectious disease from bats to humans and domestic animals. Assessment of the risk of disease emergence across regions and national boundaries can then meaningfully inform disease surveillance and management strategies, facilitating appropriate and efficient use of limited resources.",
