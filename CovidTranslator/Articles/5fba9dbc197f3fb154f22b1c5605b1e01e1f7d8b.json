Recent highprofile outbreaks have highlighted the global risk that infectious agents, both new and old, represent for society. The experience of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) shows the risk posed by emerging infectious diseases, but also the power of strongly coordinated global surveillance and public health measures, coupled with scientific research, to keep infection under control 1,2 . Diseases such as drug-resistant malaria continue to be threats. There is a need to enhance global resources to investigate, detect and respond to emerging infections, and to appropriately coordinate and direct research efforts to meet the challenges presented by these diseases.",

We also have the recent experience of the human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome pandemic as a constant reminder of how some diseases can emerge, not as an acute, self-regulating outbreak, but as diseases with chronic, long-lasting impact. One of the key elements of the successful containment of SARS was its early detection and identification within relatively strong health care systems and research environments, and the ability to mount a coordinated global response. Many of the challenges that we face in the area of emergent infections result from the fact that they frequently occur in poor, resource-constrained settings where it is more difficult to be prepared and to mount an effective response. In addition, many emergent infections and epidemics are not the results of 'new' diseases, but of the poor containment of well-understood diseases, such as drug-resistant malaria, drug-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and other infectious agents.",

This concept helps to define a conceptual framework for surveillance and response to emergent infections ( Fig. 1) .

A major initial emphasis on the development of diagnostic techniques is often a high priority, coupled with the need to assess as early as possible if any existing interventions can also be used against the new disease. For example, the discovery that some anti-influenza drugs are active against avian flu allows for contingency plans to be developed in case of a future outbreak 8 .

But in these cases, research can be initiated in advance to develop tools (diagnostics, drugs and vaccines) so that they are available when an outbreak occurs. For biodefense, there is a strong public-sector, security-led imperative to develop such tools, which may be matched in certain cases by military investment 9 . For rare infections, however, the difficulty in undertaking human clinical trials to evaluate these tools makes it difficult to fully assess their efficacy. In the US there has recently been a huge influx of National Institutes of Health funds into biodefense-related research. But for diseases such as Ebola and other hemorrhagic fevers 10 that arise occasionally and affect relatively marginalized populations, there is more difficulty in obtaining research funds. Even if funds are obtained, it often occurs subsequent to a major outbreak when the 'political' interest is at its highest, and it is extremely difficult to maintain those levels for long-term planning.

A feature for many, although not all, of these diseases, is that tools such as drugs may be available, and there is a research community in place with an interest in developing new and improved tools and methodologies to counter the disease. Once again, the diseases most associated with poverty, or that are more definitively seen as diseases of developing countries, tend to be underfunded, despite their huge global burdens. A classic example is African trypanosomiasis, or sleeping sickness, which emerges primarily in regions suffering social disruption and unrest, and which lacks affordable, safe and effective drugs and diagnostics. At the beginning of the twenty-first century, an arsenical agent remains a key intervention for the treatment of this disease.",

One of the fundamental constraints for dealing with many of the diseases under discussion is that they do not represent a substantial commercial market. The competitive pharmaceutical market approach that works in general for the development and production of new drugs, diagnostics and vaccines does not work for these diseases. The diseases must also be viewed within the context of national surveillance and control strategies. In many cases the resources available to support these systems is limited. Nevertheless, for the sustainable development of new tools and their optimal use, together with the development of appropriate methodologies and control strategies, it is important that research be carried out in a way that it can link to, and be adopted into, national control strategies and systems 11 .",

Many successful products have been developed in partnership with the pharmaceutical industry, and this will be covered in more detail in the next paragraph.

For example, industry may focus on chemistry, formulations and preclinical and regulatory activities, whereas the public sector may focus on defining the type of product required and the clinical studies required for their development. This mode of operation and sharing of risk has become increasingly important as the costs of drug research and development have increased. It is now estimated that, for every new product that comes on to the market, the pharmaceutical industry has invested approximately $800 million. Even though resources of the public and private sectors are combined in partnerships, it is rare that companies make any substantive profit on the products in the area of neglected diseases. Much of the assistance is provided in a spirit of corporate social responsibility. Under appropriate agreements, the industrial partner normally undertakes to provide preferential pricing to the public sector in developing countries. In some cases the product may even be donated.",

To repay the cost of development, a successful antibacterial needs to be highly efficacious against multiple types of infection.

The final public health model became a districtfocused, action-oriented integration of core and support activities that could be readily evaluated and led to sustained capacity development through an empowerment strategy that transformed both the staff and the system.

Early laboratory studies identified ivermectin, a veterinary product, as potentially active against Onchocerca volvulus, the causative agent of human onchocerciasis, or river blindness. A subsequent public-private partnership with Merck led to the development of the drug for human use and also to a generous drug-donation program by Merck. With the new drug available, methodologies still had to be worked out as to how the drug could be effectively distributed across many resource-poor and dispersed communities. Ultimately, locally empowered, communitydirected treatment strategies were developed that proved to be more effective than externally managed strategies. Over a period of many years, this activity has substantially reduced onchocerciasis as a public health threat and has liberated many hectares of riverside land for agricultural use. The utility of community-directed treatment strategies is also being explored for other disease management interventions.",
