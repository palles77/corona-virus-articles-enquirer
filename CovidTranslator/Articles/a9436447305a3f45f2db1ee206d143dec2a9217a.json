People without the bracelet will still be asked to practice social-distancing and stay away from work and school. A wide range of alternative forms of identification such as serological cards and phone identification or creative solutions, could also be considered to accommodate various personal preferences or professional needs.",

It requires that patients with IgG antibodies are functionally immune, don't have confounding anti-bodies in response to another virus (unlikely in the prime-age population), aren't shedding the active virus, and have long-term immunity so they don't get reinfected. This may require testing for both viral RNA and antibodies-both are possible now in a point of care setting. Early evidence from China is that within two weeks of exposure, 100% of patients have the relevant antibodies [1] , but this could be verified for US patients who have cleared the virus.",

It is possible that this group is quite large-especially if younger people who were infected didn't think that their symptoms meant that they had the virus. Most importantly, this approach requires a lot of serological testing capacity but that has dramatically improved in the past 48 hours. In two weeks, this capacity could be many times greater.",
