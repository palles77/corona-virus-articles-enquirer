The results from social network analysis and content analysis highlight that the flood response communication had strong cultural characteristics, highlighting the notion that of the cultures in Louisianafaith-based, local authority, and nonprofits-were the prominent cultural responders in the flood response communication. In particular, cultural similarity in both intra/inter group response communication was observed, with each communication group comprising actors who shared a common cultural background and spoke similar keywords.",

In addition, compared to the large volume of communication studies in disaster management, lesser volume of studies has explored the cultural tendencies embedded in communication structures in the context. Previous studies tend to focus on minorities' culture and cultural competency and awareness of majority emergency managers (Bergeron 2014; Renzaho and Oldroyd 2014; Tovar et al. 2014; Mileti 1999; Cross 1989) .

Therefore, when compared to other neighboring communities, these residents returned sooner and in greater numbers (Airriess et al. 2008; Leong et al. 2007 ).

Yet, the lack of response from local, state, and federal government officials during and after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita reinforced this distrust. Researchers have written about this unethical behavior, especially from New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin, law enforcement officers, Louisiana Governor Kathleen Babineaux Blanco, FEMA Director Michael Brown, and President George W. Bush (Ancelet et al. 2013; Eikenberry et al. 2007; Jurkiewicz 2007 Jurkiewicz , 2009 ). The level of distrust at the state and local level is shifting. Currently, Governor John Bel Edwards (D) is serving his first term with a 63% approval rating; however, the outgoing republican governor, Governor Jindal, had one of the lowest approval ratings in the state's history (below 30%) (O'Donoghue 2016). While the public trust in the federal government is at an all-time low at 19%, public trust of local government officials has maintained at 63% and state government officials at 57% (Pew Research Center 2013 .",

One of the issues is that local land use plans used outdated flood maps from 1996; therefore, residents were unaware their subdivisions were built in a flood zone and that they needed flood insurance. In fact, approximately 80% of those homes did not have flood insurance (Chiglinsky 2016) . Not only do the flood maps need to be updated, they also need to account for climate change. FEMA officials update the flood insurance maps every 5 years, which may not be accounting for the effects of climate change (Joyce 2016) . Specific to this case study, model simulations estimate that between 10 and 20% of the precipitation in the Louisiana Flood could be attributed to climate change (van der Wiel, et al. 2016; Wang et al. 2016) . Researchers have concluded that the effects of climate change increase the risk Unveiling cultures in emergency response communication\u2026 523 of losing diverse cultures and language especially in coastal communities (Adger et al. 2011) . The flooded parishes have seen an increase in population, especially after a portion of individuals who evacuated for Hurricane Katrina and Rita took up residency in the Baton Rouge and Lafayette areas. Ten years later, records show that Baton Rouge nearly doubled its population after the 2005 storms-adding and maintaining nearly 90,000 new residents Mitchell Mitchell (2015) . With this increased population came urban sprawl into surrounding communities. Southern Lafayette Parish has dramatically changed in the past 10 years with Youngsville-one of the hardest hit cities in the 2016 flood-being the fastest growing city.

It is advantageous to use Twitter data streams in investigating communication since the system is designed to support millions of users' information sharing with open public about ongoing event at any moment around the world (Weng et al. 2013) . Twitter stream data is distinctive from other web-based engines. Traditional web search engines are useful to identify user's intention, desire, wants, or needs. In contrast, Twitter data streams identify users' actions and thoughts about current events. In addition, with the technological support of the social media platform, the data stream can capture direct interactions among the users, and a user's information sharing through denotation of other users and reposting other's initial postings (Bifet et al. 2011) . Therefore, the Twitter data-Twitter contents and interaction behaviors among the users-are useful to examining patterns of human communication behaviors (Weng et al. 2013 ). This study investigated Twitter data streams from September 9-16, 2016, which is 2 weeks after the last date of the flood inundation, August 25, 2016. The time frame is important to observe the disaster response communication. During the time frame, response activities were still underway while the recovery operations were initiated. In addition, during the time, information was shared across stakeholders to make important decisions about the longer-term response and attempting to return all system back to their normal state. Therefore, the observation period allowed evaluating specific communication behaviors and actions of stakeholders emerged during the longer-term response phase.",

The researchers conducted network analysis to identify the whole communication network structure, and cluster analysis to identify sub-group structures. While conducting a network analysis, network nodes were identified. Nodes indicate Twitter users, entities of the communication, who posted Tweets including ''LA Flood'' during the observation period, and additional Twitter users who respond to those labeled Tweets (Smith et al. 2009; Smith 2015) . Then, edges (or links) among all users were identified based on their communication behaviors using Tween functions (1) mentioning one another's initial Tweets containing the ''LA flood'' and (2) directly replying to those initial Tweets. In addition, the direction of the communication among actors was coded.

Group 2 has comparatively many out-going ties to groups 1, 3 and 4, and receives a strong input from group 2. Group 2 receives ties all other major groups. Group 3 has both strong outgoing and in-coming ties from group 2. Group 3 also receives ties from all other major groups. Group 4 and 5 have mutual ties with group 2 and 3, but they only receive ties from group 1. This inter-group communication structure indicates that groups 2 and 3 bridge communication across the major clusters through their mutual group communication, as well as each of their connections with all other groups. In particular, groups 2 and 3 bridge communication among groups 1, 4, and 5. Figure 2 summarizes information of inter-group communication among the top five groups.",

In addition, the users in the group tend to share those key words by mentioning or replying to the tweets made by ''Franklin Graham (R),'' ''Samaritan's Purse (M),'' and ''Liberty University (M).'' This is associated with the predominant local culture, strong involvement and power of faith-based organizations in the regional/community affairs. The group 2's communication pattern shows common attitude towards local and/or public authority. Lastly, group 5 is the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) communication network. Group members exchanged information about federal assistance from both FEMA's headquarters and regional office. During the communication, information about FEMA operations were shared through keywords including ''FEMA,'' ''1 billion [Federal assistance],'' and ''big milestone surpassed [self-evaluation].''",

Groups sharing cultural attributes tend to have more frequent interactions while groups of distinctive cultures tend not to communicate.

In particular, groups 3, based on its cultural diversity, are able to communicate with all other cultural groups. Some local government members of the group 3 communicated with group 2 and delivered formal information to the group 1 (faith-based response). In addition, the public authorities embedded in the group 2 enabled its interactions with the groups 4 (red-cross) and 5 (FEMA). In addition, the group 2 delivered information to group 3, which was connected to the group 1.",

Results highlight that 2017 Louisiana Flood response communication showed strong cultural characteristics. Among all the cultures in Louisiana, faith-based, distrust of local authority, and humanitarian assistance were prominent cultural indicators in the flood response communication. In particular, each communication group was composed of actors sharing common cultural background and speaking similar languages (key words). In addition, inter-group communications emerge when communication group have some common cultural agenda. In other words, groups sharing some key words tend to communicate more frequently than those which do not. Thus, intergroup communications were bridged by the groups carrying multiple cultural characteristics.",

For instance, realtime data directly collected from social media overtime provides first responders with an opportunity to assess whether cultures embedded in local community matter in facilitating communications with key stakeholders such as local governments and nonprofits via social media. Also, social network analysis with social media datasets can allow practitioners to identify the most influential stakeholders and keywords as needs of affected communities over time (Jung et al. 2017) . The application of a webometric approach as a method of social network analysis with social media datasets will be critically considered as a smart big-board which exactly identify dominant cultures of key stakeholders' communications, which helps an organization respond to an unexpected event and develop communication strategies.As with any case study, there are limitations and recommendations for future research. First, researchers often criticize single-case study designs for lacking external validity because the study results are harder to generalize to larger populations. Sobeck (2003) and Yin (1994) , among other scholars, make the argument that case study research is attempting to create analytic, and not statistical, generalizations. Future research should replicate the data collection and analysis methodology to study culture in other disasters, such as the recent 2016 disasters: Korean Earthquake, San Jose Flood, and Fort Lauderdale Airport Shooting. Second, researchers in this case study collected the Twitter data for dates following the disaster. Similar to the study on Twitter use before, during, and after Superstorm Sandy (Jacques and Knox 2016), a future study could expand the Twitter data collection to capture cultural communications throughout the disaster.",

Yet, key words shared among diverse group members were very action based, such as ''Help,'' ''Recovery,'' and ''Need volunteers.'' The keywords explain that the group's sole focus is on recovery and response operation, the ultimate goal of overall actors in this communication. The communication among members of group 4 can be characterized as a humanitarian nonprofit emergency response network across jurisdictions. Twitter users shared information Tweeted by ''American Red Cross [National] (M),'' ''Red Cross, Baton Rouge [Affected Region] (M),'' and ''Red Cross Louisiana (M).'' In addition, keywords shared by those Tweets were ''helping,'' ''latest month,'' ''Watch community,'' and ''Volunteers.'' The key words indicate information about how the humanitarian nonprofits have worked in the affected community from the beginning of the flood in the region. This observation confirms that after Hurricane Katrina and Rita in 2005, nonprofits became one of the active and well-trusted actors during disaster response in LA.",
