Obviously, all cough at its beginning is acute. It is not currently possible to predict at the onset of cough in whom it will be of short duration (i.e., resolve within 3 weeks) or in whom it will become subacute or chronic. The issue is further complicated by the fact that effective therapy can abort or abbreviate the duration of cough, whereas failure to institute effective therapy can convert what might have been an acute cough into a subacute or chronic one. Furthermore, recurrent acute episodes of cough can be a manifestation of an undiagnosed chronic disease (e.g., asthma). Nevertheless, keeping these caveats in mind, a relatively ''standard'' diagnostic and therapeutic approach based on duration of cough has proved useful [4] .",

Despite its importance, there are no large, prospective studies that describe the spectrum and frequency of the causes of acute cough. It is presumed that acute cough is most commonly caused by viral respiratory tract infections. The infections that involve primarily the upper respiratory tract (URT) are designated collectively as the ''common cold.'' Alternatively, infections that appear to involve primarily the airways of the lower respiratory tract (LRT) are termed ''acute bronchitis'' [10, 11] . Acute bacterial sinusitis, Bordetella pertussis, mycoplasma, and chlamydia infections, allergic rhinitis, environmental irritant rhinitis, and foreign body aspiration are other causes of acute cough [1] . Importantly, on occasion acute cough can be the presenting or predominant symptom of a serious or even life-threatening condition (e.g., pulmonary embolism, congestive heart failure, pneumonia) [1, 12] .",

One proposed mechanism is that the production of inflammatory mediators, such as bradykinin, prostaglandins, and tachykinins, produce excessive secretions that result in PND that mechanically stimulates the cough receptors. This is supported by a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study on the common cold that demonstrated statistically significant associations among cough, throat clearing, and PND [10] . Cough improved in parallel with decreases in throat clearing and PND. Alternatively, it has been proposed that viral-induced inflammation of upper airway structures can directly irritate and activate the afferent sensory nerves in the upper airway [15] . Madison and Irwin have proposed that this increase in cough sensitivity of the upper airway during URTI may be due to an increased sensitivity of the rapidly adapting sensory receptors in the airway [16] . In recognition of the possibility that both PND and direct irritation of airway cough receptors can be factors in how upper airway cough is triggered, the term upper airway cough syndrome (UACS) was proposed in the 2006 American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) cough guidelines to replace the term PND [1] .",

Furthermore, there is no diagnostic test that can differentiate between these two disorders.

Various respiratory viruses appear to be the most common cause of acute bronchitis. Fewer than 10% of patients will have a bacterial infection diagnosed as the cause [18] . Viruses associated with acute bronchitis include influenza B, influenza A, parainfluenza, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). In addition, viruses that are predominantly associated with URT infection, including coronavirus, rhinovirus, and adenovirus have been implicated in acute bronchitis.

In contrast, the newer, so-called second-generation ''nonsedating'' antihistamines have been shown to be ineffective in treating the symptoms of the common cold [20] .

Prolonged use is not advised because of the risk of rhinitis medicamentosa. Zinc-containing lozenges abbreviated the symptoms of the common cold, including cough in one prospective study [23] . Two other studies and a metaanalysis, however, did not support the purported benefit of zinc in treating the common cold [24] . Because zinccontaining therapy is associated with a significant incidence of side effects, its use cannot be recommended [25] . Topical anticholinergic therapy has been shown in one prospective study to decrease rhinorrhea and sneezing in the common cold, but its efficacy on decreasing cough was not evaluated [26] . Interferon may decrease symptoms of the common cold, but only if used prophylactically. Further limiting interferon's value is the significant potential for side effects. [27] .
