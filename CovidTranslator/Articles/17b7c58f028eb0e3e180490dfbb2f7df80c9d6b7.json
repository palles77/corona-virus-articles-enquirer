Bootstrap value was set at 1000\u00d7. Samples were colour-coded by epidemiological link as follows: 1) Magenta represents Cluster 1: Imported cluster; 2) Cyan represents Cluster 2: unknown source; 3) Green represents Cluster 3: local; 4) Orange represents Cluster 4: Hotpot partyrelated Superspreading event (SSE); 5) Blue represents Cluster 5: Public housing estaterelated SSE; and 6) Red represents Cluster 6: Buddha worship hall-related SSE. Case 84 and Case 102 were asymptomatic at the time of sample collection, and were marked with asterisks (*) in the diagram. Each case is indicated with a case number (see figure 1 ) followed by the date (dd/mm/yyyy) of symptom onset.",

The reproduction number value was 1\u00b784 as of February 28, 2020 in Hong Kong. Interpretation: We provided a territory-wide overview of COVID-19 in Hong Kong, which has borders connecting to Mainland China. Transmission in closed settings especially during family and religious gatherings is a hallmark of the recently reported cases. The reproduction number value indicated an ongoing outbreak in the community. Rapid isolation of suspected or confirmed cases and their close contacts coupled with robust laboratory surveillance and social distancing is crucial to the containment of COVID-19 transmission. Introduction \"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)\" refers to the cluster of viral pneumonia cases initially from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China since December 2019. The aetiology was unknown during the early stage of the outbreak until Chinese scientists isolated a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, from a patient on January 7, 2020 and performed genome sequencing. 1",

Of the 50 cases, 42 (84\u00b70%) could be clustered based on their epidemiological linkages (figure 1). Six transmission clusters (Clusters 1-6) were identified. Cluster 1 involved a family of four members.

The genomic-wide SNPs were used to contextualise the phylogenetic placement of Hong Kong strains in the global phylogeny of SARS-CoV-2. In comparison with SARS-CoV-2 strains isolated from other regions, Hong Kong strains showed limited genomic variability, and tended to aggregate in two clusters (figure S1). In the first cluster, a total of 13 Hong Kong strains formed a subclade (yellow rectangular box) with the strains from France (n=5), Singapore (n=4), Australia (n=2), South Korea (n=2), Sweden (n=1) and USA (n=1). The second cluster composed of 31 Hong Kong strains, which formed another distinct subclade (pink rectangular box) with the strains from Japan (n=3), China (n=2), England (n=2), Australia (n=2) and New Zealand (n=1).Regarding the phylogenetic relationship among the Hong Kong cases, the branching and the clustering of samples were consistent with the actual epidemiological linkage (figure 2).

Finally, the fourth node belonged to the SSE occurring in Buddhist worship hall (Cluster 6), in which Orf1ab G295V and Orf3a G251V were identified in all the strains in the cluster. According to Bayesian time-scaled phylodynamic analysis, the estimated tMRCA of COVID-2019 outbreak in Hong Kong was postulated to be December 24, 2019 (95% Bayesian credible interval [BCI]: December 11, 2019 to January 5, 2020) with an evolutionary rate 3.04\u00d710 -3 substitutions per site per year (95% BCI: 2\u00b704\u00d710 -3 to 4\u00b709\u00d710 -3 substitutions per site per year).

Transmission in closed settings especially during family and religious gatherings is a hallmark of the recent cases recorded in Hong Kong. Among six clusters identified based on epidemiological linkage, three (Clusters 4-6; figure 1) were considered SSEs because they involved more individuals (n=8-13). To investigate the phylogenetic relatedness and the transmission linkage among these clusters and other singleton cases, WGS was performed on all 50 cases. The SARS-CoV-2 strains isolated in Hong Kong have 99\u00b798% identity to the reference genome (NC_045512.2), indicating that the virus has not undergone major genome 1 4 modification since the initial outbreak of COVID-19 in Wuhan. Forty-four (88\u00b70%) of our strains shared a common mutation Orf3a G251V. Except one imported case, all belonged to local cases and their close contacts without travel records (figure 1). Unlike other regions, such as China and Europe, where the SARS-CoV-2 genomes scattered across different branches in global phylogeny, the majority (88\u00b70%) of Hong Kong strains were clustered together in two subclades (figure S1). This suggested that the COVID-19 outbreak in Hong Kong community was mostly arisen from two ancestors. Regarding the local phylogenetic analysis, although the bootstrap value is only marginally supportive because of the highly conserved genomic sequences, the clustering of samples was highly concordant to the epidemiological linkage. Cluster 1 demonstrated the closest genetic distance to the reference genome amongst all cases reported in Hong Kong (figures 1 and 2).",

Considering the fast-evolving property of RNA viruses, the identical genetic sequences among the strains implied that the transmission occurred in a short period or even in a single event.
