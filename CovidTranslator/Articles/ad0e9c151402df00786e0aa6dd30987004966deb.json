Public health investigators were able to assess exposure risk and actively monitor symptoms for 347 (93%) of the 372 contacts, including 222 (94%) of 236 contacts with exposure on or after the date of first positive specimen collection. There were 25 people that had insufficient contact information to complete active monitoring. None of these individuals were found to have emergency department visits with fever, cough, or shortness of breath using near real-time surveillance data received from regional acute care hospitals for 14 days after their last exposure. Data presented are for those actively monitored. Of these 347 contacts, 195 (56%) were health-care personnel and 152 (44%) were community members. Although the majority of monitored contacts (228 [66%] of 347) had low-risk exposures, 119 (34%) had exposures of medium risk or greater (table 2) .",

Transmission occurred between close household contacts, from an index travel-associated case who subsequently transmitted the infection to her husband. Their prolonged, unprotected close contact occurred across multiple days early in her illness, before Patient 1 sought clinical care. No additional cases of COVID-19 were identified through active symptom monitoring of several hundred community and health-care personnel contacts, testing of symptomatic PUIs, or screening of a subset of asymptomatic healthcare personnel contacts. These data suggest that personto-person transmission of COVID-19 might be most likely to occur through unprotected, prolonged exposure to a patient with symptomatic COVID-19. Our experience of limited transmission of SARS-CoV-2 differs from that documented in Wuhan, where transmission has been reported to occur across the wider community and in health-care personnel, 6 and from experiences of other similar coronaviruses. [17] [18] [19] The severity of illness, the extent of viral shedding, and timing of exposures to a symptomatic patient might all have contributed to the limited transmission described here. Infection control measures within the hospital setting and an aggressive public health response might also have prevented further exposures.",

The date of symptom onset for Patient 2 was especially difficult to ascertain. Given this uncertainty, we applied a conservative approach for identifying contacts of Patient 2 by using the earliest reported date of possible symptom onset, DOI 3.

For example, we considered nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal specimen collection aerosol-generating procedures, and therefore classified health-care personnel performing these without all recommended PPE as high risk, whereas they are classified as medium risk according to the guidance. Additionally, we included community members as contacts if they entered the same indoor environment (eg, hospital waiting room) within 2 h of a patient with COVID-19, an approach based on other viruses with airborne transmission patterns, such as measles. Current interim guidance requires contacts to have been in the room at the same time as a patient with COVID-19.

These findings also support CDC's assessment that, without using appropriate PPE, people living in the same household as, or providing care in a non-health-care setting for, a person with symptomatic laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 have high-risk exposure. 21 In these contexts, CDC's recommendation for people with high-risk exposures to remain quarantined with no public activities might be effective in reducing onward person-toperson transmission of SARS-CoV-2. 11 Given the difficulty in detecting new symptoms in patients with underlying lung disease, CDC recommends that clinicians considering a diagnosis of COVID-19 should discuss testing with public health departments on a case-by-case basis. 22 Patients with potential exposure to SARS-CoV-2 with a fever, cough, or shortness of breath should call their health-care provider before seeking care so that appropriate preventive actions can be implemented. 21 Healthcare facilities should rapidly triage and isolate suspected PUIs and notify infection prevention services and local health departments for support in testing, management, and containment efforts. 22 Contributors IG, TDM, JCH, and HLK each led aspects of the contact investigation and JRV and JEL provided overall leadership and guidance to the investigation.
