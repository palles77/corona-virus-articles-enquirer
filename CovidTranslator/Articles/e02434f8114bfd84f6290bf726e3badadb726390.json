            "text": "A causal relationship between respiratory tract infection, especially viral infection and exacerbations of bronchial asthma is well established in the medical literature. 1 In early prospective studies by McIntosh et al., 2 the relationship between exacerbations of wheezing and infection in hospitalized, previously diagnosed asthmatic children was investigated. A significant fraction (42%) was associated with viral respiratory infections, but not with pathogenic bacteria. Prospective studies on acute exacerbations of asthma in the adult population have suggested that approximately 10-20% of acute exacerbations may be attributable to acute viral infection. Berman and coworkers 3 convincingly failed to show an association between bacterial respiratory infection and asthma. Transtracheal aspirates from 27 adult asthmatic patients with acute exacerbations showed no correlation between bacterial isolates and asthma symptoms. This suggested that overt bacterial infection of the lower respiratory tract does not contribute to the exacerbation of asthma. However, studies of older children and young adults have shown that infection with atypical bacteria e.g. Mycoplasma and Chlamydia may be responsible for exacerbations. In these studies, rhinovirus was the most important pathogen, followed by influenza A virus, Mycoplasma and Chlamydia. [4] [5] [6] Several other studies have suggested a relationship between respiratory infections in infancy and development of asthma, although this hypothesis awaits more definite proof.",

The illness may start with nonrespiratory symptoms such as headache and myalgias, and there is frequently pharyngitis and low-grade fever. A nonproductive cough, which tends to be prolonged and severe, is most characteristic. The diagnosis is made based on clinical history and chest radiograph, which shows patchy segmental pulmonary infiltrates. The definitive diagnosis is made by serological studies, particularly a doubling titer in convalescence. Antibiotic therapy is most effective if given within a few days of onset. Erythromycin or tetracycline are equally effective, and treatment is continued for 2-3 weeks. As well as causing exacerbations of asthma, M. pneumoniae pneumonia in nonasthmatics may well induce bronchial hyperresponsiveness which may be transient or persistent. 10 ",

The diagnosis is difficult to make, as commercial serological tests are generally not available. Chest radiograph shows findings similar to M. pneumoniae infection.

In a study of 25 normal subjects, samples from multiple sites in the lower respiratory tract were obtained with a protected brush specimen. Most cultures contained bacteria (38 out of 52 specimens, or 73%) similar to those found in the nasopharynx, but the colony counts were often so low (none to five colonies per culture plate) that the cultures probably indicated upper respiratory tract contamination rather than true lower respiratory tract colonization. 21 The nasopharyngeal bacteria may be transiently aerosolized or aspirated into the lower respiratory tract but are removed by mucociliary clearance or cough. Pathogenic aerobic Gram-negative rods do not inhabit the upper airways mucosa in normal persons, but may do with alterations in health status such as alcoholism, diabetes, residing in a health-care facility. 22 Subconscious aspiration of oropharyngeal secretions allows these microbes to enter the lower airways and alveoli and become a nidus for subsequent infection.",

The results showed that fewer than two bacteria per oil-immersion field were found in stable patients, while during exacerbations the sputum revealed 12 organisms per oil-immersion field resembling H. influenzae, eight organisms resembling Strep. pneumonia or 18 organisms resembling M. catarrhalis. Over 99% of patients with chronic bronchitis without clinical evidence of infection fell below these thresholds.These findings suggest that an upper limit may be set for the numbers of micro-organisms seen on a Gram stain of sputum from patients with COPD in the absence of a bacterial infection.

A positive response to a specific antibiotic prescribed for an exacerbation by a specific organism would provide evidence of a pathogenic role for the bacteria. In a landmark study, Anthonisen and co-workers 25 demonstrated, for the first time, that patients could be stratified according to the symptoms to predict a response to antimicrobial therapy. In patients with at least two of the three cardinal symptoms of acute exacerbation (increased sputum purulence, increased sputum volume and increased dyspnea), broad-spectrum antibiotics (amoxicillin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, doxycycline) led to improved clinical outcomes, fewer therapeutic failures and a more rapid rate of lung function recovery than did placebo. Overall, the length of illness was 2 days shorter for the antibiotic-treated group as compared with the placebo group. A meta-analysis by Saint et al. 37 showed that there were benefits from antibiotic therapy for exacerbations as compared with placebo ( Fig. 54.3) . In nine prospective randomized trials conducted from 1957 to 1992, the overall effect size (defined as the standard deviation of benefit with therapy versus placebo for the effect measured) favored antibiotics (0.22), and seven of the nine trials showed a benefit for antibiotics. A beneficial effect of antibiotics was demonstrated in studies that included the greatest number of patients and the patients with more severe disease. The demonstration of therapeutic efficacy of antibiotics in exacerbations provides evidence of a pathogenic role for bacteria in exacerbations. Design flaws in the earlier studies, such as small numbers of study patients, unclear selection criteria, uncertain microbiology, nonstandard evaluation criteria and lack of stratification of patients, may account for the discrepancy of outcomes in these studies. 38 Although antibiotics provide benefit compared with placebo, further studies are required to assess different classes of antibiotics in specific clinical situations. Several studies have suggested that patients with different severities of chronic lung disease have exacerbations with different organisms. Eller et al. 39 found that if patients with better lung function were compared with those with worse lung function (based on FEV 1 ), the bacteriology shifted from pneumococcus and H. influenzae to more complex organisms such as Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas species. Similarly, Miravitlles et al. 40 found that H. influenzae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were more common in patients with FEV 1 values of less than 50% of predicted.The patients with worse lung function suffered from more frequent exacerbations and were given repeated antibiotic therapy which likely led to alteration of airway microbial flora.",

Cole and Wilson used this evidence to construct the vicious circle hypothesis (Fig.  54.4) . 54 According to this hypothesis, initiating factors such as cigarette smoke lead to impaired mucociliary clearance in the airways. This is followed by bacterial colonization and release of bacterial products such as lipooligosaccharides, causing direct damage to airway epithelium and inhibiting mucociliary activity.The neutrophils are attracted by chemotactic bacterial factors released by resident phagocytes, complement components, and directly by chemotactic bacterial products. A destructive, cytokine-mediated inflammatory host response is triggered, which enhances the elastolytic activity in the lung, ultimately causing further airway damage. The impairment of the host defense mechanisms predispose to further bacterial infection, thereby establishing the self-perpetuating vicious circle of host and bacterialmediated respiratory tract damage. Previous studies could not demonstrate a role for respiratory infections in the progression of airways obstruction. [55] [56] [57] However, Kanner et al. 58 have recently demonstrated that more rapid decline in lung function occurred with more frequent respiratory tract infections. They found that smokers with mild to moderate COPD suffered from increased numbers of lower respiratory infections as compared with quitters. In addition, one infection per year was associated with an increase in decline of FEV 1 of about 7 mL per year. 59 Recently, Seemungal et al. 60 prospectively followed a cohort of 101 patients with moderate to severe COPD over a 2 year period. In 7.1% of exacerbations, recovery of lung function (PEFR) had not occurred in 91 days. 60 Although this model of pathogenesis is popular, more clinical studies and applications of newer techniques are required to study these proposed mechanisms of \"Vicious Circle Hypothesis\".",

Despite their relatively poor activity and suboptimal respiratory pharmacokinetics, cephalexin and cefaclor have been extensively used for the management of AECB.

In older studies, comparisons with oral cephalosporins generally showed equivalent efficacy. 84 Recent studies have shown increased resistance of common respiratory pathogens to TMP-SMX in Europe and the United States, making this antibiotic less useful in the treatment of AECB. Penicillinresistant pneumococci have an 80 to 90% likelihood of being resistant to TMP-SMX. 85 Newer macrolides and azalides Erythromycin has poor activity against H. influenzae (MIC 4 to 8 mg/L) and cannot be considered one of the drugs of choice for AECB. Azithromycin and clarithromycin have improved pharmacokinetics and antibacterial activity. 86 A 3-day regimen of azithromycin is clinically and microbiologically equivalent to a 10-day course of coamoxiclav. 87 The significant advantages of azithromycin are enhanced potency against H. influenzae, once daily administration, an abbreviated 4-day course, and perhaps a reduced frequency of relapse during extended followup. 88, 89 Clarithromycin has only intermediate activity against H. influenzae but synergy with a metabolite reduces the overall MIC to around 1 mg/L so thus in the therapeutic range. 90 Clinical studies of clarithromycin involving 7-to 14-day regimens in patients with mild to moderate infections have shown equivalence with ampicillin. 81 A direct comparison with azithromycin and clarithromycin showed no difference in response rates or adverse reactions. 91",

The presence of cardiovascular comorbidity combined with more than four exacerbations in the previous year has a sensitivity of 70% and specificity of 37% in predicting treatment failure. 96 Therefore, advanced age, significant impairment of lung function, poor performance status, comorbid conditions, and history of previous frequent exacerbations requiring systemic corticosteroids characterize a high-risk group. Because the cost of failure is high, an aggressive approach to treatment of this high-risk group may improve outcome. Therapy with first-line antibiotics fails in 13% to 25% of exacerbations. 97 Therapeutic failure increases cost of care due to extra physician visits, further diagnostic tests and repeated courses of antibiotics, more hospitalizations, and absence from work.

Pharmaco-economic analysis involves determining the extra costs required to achieve an additional unit of clinical benefit. In AECB, therapeutic failure is associated with much higher costs, thus identification of subgroups of patients likely to fail low-cost therapy is important. Various techniques including modeling studies, retrospective analysis of data bases, and prospective randomized pharmacoeconomic clinical trials have been developed to examine these issues. A retrospective study by Destache and colleagues 582 Asthma and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease showed that the use of newer antibiotics (cephalosporins, macrolides and fluoroquinolones) when compared with first-line agents, reduced overall costs of treating patients despite higher initial acquisition costs. 103 The Canadian Ciprofloxacin Health Economic Study Group 104 randomized patients with more than three exacerbations to receive either ciprofloxacin or any nonquinolone-based therapy.The study measured clinical endpoints (days of illness, hospitalizations, time to next exacerbation) blended with quality of life measurements and total respiratory costs. The use of ciprofloxacin in patients with a history of moderate to severe bronchitis and at least four AECB in the previous year offered substantial clinical and economic benefits. Additional future prospective studies are required to determine if the newer antimicrobial agents offer advantages in terms of costs, quality of life and clinical efficacy.",

Future therapies may also be directed towards the inflammatory process within the airways that damages the airway mucosa and that leads to greater colonization by pathogenic bacteria. Specific anti-inflammatory mediators directed against various cytokines may interrupt the progressive deterioration of lung function. 105 Most clinical trials of antibiotics were performed for licensing, and patients with pathogens resistant to different antimicrobials were excluded. Further comparative trials showed clinical equivalence and not superiority. Future studies of new antimicrobials should examine clinical efficacy more stringently based on a classification system that would help select patients most likely to benefit from an antibiotic such as those falling in the last two categories in Table 54 .5, and should only include patients with Winnipeg type I criteria.",
