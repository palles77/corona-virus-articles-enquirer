            "text": "The infection of the nasal airways determines an acute coryzal illness, traditionally referred to as a common cold, presenting with nasal discharge and obstruction, sneezing and sore throat. It is caused by a group of infections, all of viral nature, for the most part belonging to five families: rhinovirus, parainfluenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, enterovirus (especially coxsackievirus A21), and coronaviruses. Acute laryngitis is characterized by hoarseness of voice with a deepened pitch with possible episodes of aphonia. Often these signs are associated to those of coryza and pharyngitis. The large majority of episodes are due to viral agents, including parainfluenza virus, rhinovirus, influenza virus, and adenovirus. Bacteria, represented by C. diphtheriae, Branhamella catarrhalis and Haemophilus influenzae, may rarely play a role in this condition, and are almost invariably associated to pharyngitis. The acute inflammation of the pharynx causes the pharyngitis syndrome, which presents with soreness, scratchiness and irritation. Most cases are of viral etiology, and appear in the context of the coryzal syndrome or influenza, rather than as an isolated entity. Rhinovirus and coronavirus are the most common causative agents, but adenovirus and herpes simplex virus may also be implicated, usually in more severe clinical cases. Other viral causes of pharyngitis in the context of a generalized infection are Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The pharyngitis/tonsillitis syndrome is caused by bacteria in SECTION 11 up to 15% of the cases, the most important agent being represented by Streptococcus pyogenes (Group A \u03b2-hemolytic streptococcus) and, more rarely, Corynebacterium diphtheriae.",

In a classic study comparing incidence rates in travelers to different areas RTI occurred in 3.7/1000 travel days to Latin America, 3.5/1000 to Oceania, and 3.1/1000 to the Caribbean. 7 In the literature, there are large variations in the proportion of respiratory infections among all causes of illness in returning travelers. Comparison among studies, however, is difficult and differences are likely to reflect diverse diagnostic procedures and definition of syndromes rather than true epidemiologic differences. Still, RTIs consistently rank in the highest belt of most frequently diagnosed conditions. Incidence rates have been recently reviewed by Denny and Kallings, ranging from 4-42%. 8 As they correctly point out, proportions made on a population group should be differentiated from those made on an ill group. A few additional reports have become available since the above review has been published. Among 1469 British package holiday tourists 7.6% had respiratory infection, and this condition was over-ranked by travelers' diarrhea only. 9 Respiratory illness occurred in 26% of 748 travelers from the USA, second only to diarrhea. 10 O'Brien et al. studied a group of 232 sick travelers at a tertiary hospital in Australia mainly returned from Asian destinations: RTIs were second after malaria, accounting for 24% of the cases. 11 Leder and colleagues have found that 7.8% of ill travellers overall had respiratory illness in the GeoSentinel Surveillance System. 12 In that series, lower tract infections accounted for 50% of all RTIs, and were almost equally distributed between bacterial pneumonia and influenza. 11 Bacterial pneumonia was significantly more common in patients aged >40 years with an OR of 5.5. One-quarter of upper tract infections were due to group A streptococcus. In a multicenter hospital study in Italy including 541 travelers with fever, 8.1% of the patients had a respiratory syndrome, one third of whom had pneumonia. TB was responsible for 29% of pneumonia cases. Among cases with RTI and no signs of pneumonia, malaria was the underlying disease in 11 of 27, despite the fact that malaria is reportedly not associated with respiratory symptoms. 13",

However, some persons are at increased risk of developing severe clinical consequences should infection occur. High-risk groups include people at the extremes of age, infants, small children and the elderly, and subjects with chronic tracheobronchial or pulmonary disease. There is convincing evidence that chilling is not an important risk factor for these diseases. The reduced pressure of inspired oxygen found on airline flights or high altitude destinations may adversely affect infants' breathing patterns. 14 It has been suggested that if a concomitant respiratory tract infection is present hypoxia can reach levels to be a significant risk for sudden infant death. Respiratory infections are the most common diagnosis for passengers and crew seeking medical care on board ships. 15 In addition, cruise travelers are at increased risk for legionellosis, influenza or pneumococcal disease. 2 Reasons for increased susceptibility of cruise ship travelers to respiratory infections include passenger factors, such as age, underlying illnesses and physical conditions, as well as environmental factors, like the heavy use of secretional spas (increasing difficulties in maintaining safe water systems) and the confinement in relatively close quarters. 16 ",

Although the majority of cases with radiologic evidence of pneumonia may still have a viral infection, the proportion of cases due to bacteria is high enough to warrant systematic antibacterial treatment. The chest film is not helpful in making a specific etiologic diagnosis; however, lobar consolidation, cavitation and large pleural effusions support a bacterial cause. Pneumococcal disease is often characterized by abrupt onset of fever, cough, rapid respiration, and lobar consolidation on chest film. Atypical pneumonias caused by M. pneumoniae and C. pneumoniae are characterized by gradual onset of symptoms, cough progressive from dry to productive, chest film worse than symptoms, and normal peripheral white blood cell counts. Overall, however, clinical presentation is not specific enough to make etiologic diagnosis, and effective methods to recognize the causative agent of pneumonia are not available. The sputum Gram stain is a simple, quick and inexpensive procedure but its helpfulness for aiding in the etiologic diagnosis is unclear. The main advantages are the identification of P. carinii in patients with AIDS or acid-fast bacilli in patients with tuberculosis. The utility of the sputum culture is also unclear, since the procedure is insensitive, only half of patients with pneumonia may produce sputum and contamination occurs in one third. An advantage of routine sputum Gram stain and culture is that these procedures would capture rare causes of pneumonia like melioidosis. Because the cause of pneumonia cannot be determined on the basis of any specific clinical, radiographic, or laboratory parameter, antibiotic therapy is usually begun empirically. Treatment should be effective on S. pneumoniae, the most frequently responsible agent, and on agents of atypical pneumonia: M. pneumoniae, C. pneumoniae, and legionella infections. Amoxicillin and amoxicillinclavulanic acid should be associated with a macrolide. Alternatively, the new respiratory tract quinolones can be used alone. Presumptive treatment should be replaced by more specific treatment when a high degree of suspicion of the etiology of diagnosis is reached.",

As a consequence of the 1998 epidemic of influenza in Alaska and the Yukon Territory, The National Advisory Committee on Immunization of Canada recommended influenza vaccination for people at high risk of influenza complications before embarking on travel to destinations where influenza was likely to be circulating. 20 At the same time, some cruise lines initiated policies to vaccinate crew members to decrease the risk for influenza transmission to travelers. 21 ",

Massive efforts were put in place by international organizations for the identification and containment of the outbreak, including the slaughtering of 1.6 million chickens, the putative source of the infection. 27 Several measures can help minimize the global public health risks that could arise from large outbreaks of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza in birds: (1) to halt further spread of epidemics in poultry populations; (2) to vaccinate persons at high risk of exposure to infected poultry, using existing vaccines effective against currently circulating human influenza strains; (3) to protect workers involved in the culling of poultry flocks by proper clothing and equipment; (4) To give antiviral drugs as a prophylactic measure to the same workers. The World Health Organization (WHO) does not recommend screening of travelers coming from H5N1-affected areas.

Prevention of SARS among travelers will be difficult during epidemic periods. The only sure way to prevent infection is to avoid locations where outbreaks have occurred. Air travel appears to be relatively safe since only 14 cases have been reported from 35 flights carrying infected passengers. Twelve occurred among passengers seated within four rows of the index case and two were flight attendants.",

            "text": "In 2005, highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza A viruses were endemic in avian populations in SE Asia, and human cases continue to accumulate. To 5 February 2008 359 cases of Avian flu were reported in 14 countries with 226 deaths. 35 Transmission requires direct contact with birds or their droppings. Large amounts of the virus are known to be excreted in the droppings from infected birds. Populations in affected countries are advised to avoid contact with dead migratory birds or wild birds showing signs of disease. 36 Usually, pneumonia that occurs in patients with influenza is not directly caused by influenza virus, but is caused by bacterial infection. In human cases of avian influenza pneumonia was caused directly by the virus, it did not respond to antibiotics, and it frequently was rapidly fatal. 37 Although currently incapable of sustained human-to-human transmission, H5N1 represents a serious pandemic threat owing to the risk of a re-assortment or mutation generating a virus with human-tohuman transmissibility. If more humans become infected over time, the likelihood also increases that humans, if concurrently infected with human and avian influenza strains, could serve as the 'mixing vessel' for the emergence of a novel subtype with sufficient human genes to be easily transmitted from person to person. Such an event would mark the start of an influenza pandemic. It is impossible to anticipate when the next influenza pandemic might occur or how severe its consequences might be. If H5N1 viruses develop the ability for efficient human-to-human transmission, an influenza pandemic would likely result. Problems associated with such an event include the notion that little pre-existing natural immunity to H5N1 infection exists in the human population, that genetic sequencing shows that H5N1 is naturally resistant to the two antiviral medications most commonly used for treating influenza, and that there is no demonstration on efficacy of neuraminidase inhibitors. 38 Influenza Influenza is the most important of the viral respiratory infections, sustained by the influenza viruses type A and B. The virus is responsible for recurrent epidemics due to the emergence and spread of a novel type of virus. Worldwide pandemics resulting in a high number of illnesses and millions of deaths occurred in 1918, 1957, and 1968, each one lasting for approximately 2-3 years. While large epidemics are due to human viral strains, small outbreaks have been associated with avian and swine viruses.",

            "text": "Travelers acquire influenza both as sporadic cases and as clusters from a common source aboard ships, airplanes, or in tour groups. All described outbreaks are caused by the type A virus, and are characterized by the involvement of a large proportion of the population at risk, and the explosive nature of the epidemic. In 1998, approximately 40 000 tourists and tourism workers were affected by an influenza outbreak in Alaska and the Yukon Territory. 39 Influenza is a common infection also among Hajj pilgrims, with 24 000 estimated cases per Hajj season. 40 Influenza is a self-limiting disease, which produces high morbidity and is responsible for lethal cases among the youngest and the eldest. The hallmark of the clinical presentation of influenza is a febrile illness with cough, resulting from involvement of trachea and bronchi. Fever characteristically lasts 3-5 days, but dry cough may persist for much longer. Pneumonia is the most frequent complication. Part of the cases are due to direct involvement of the lungs by the influenza virus, the remainder being attributable to bacterial superinfections, mainly from S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, and group A Streptococcus. Otitis media and sinusitis are other serious complications. Complications are more frequent and severe among patients with chronic diseases of the lung or the heart. Early diagnosis of influenza can be based on rapid antigen detection tests. Viral isolation is the method of reference but it is seldom used in clinical care. Antibody determination is also rarely used for diagnosis in clinical settings. Treatment is symptomatic in most cases. For severe cases in debilitated subjects the M2 inhibitor antivirals amantadine and rimantadine are effective on type A virus, and reduce the duration of the illness and viral shedding if administered within 48 h of symptom onset. Oseltamivir is the only practical choice for self-treatment in the traveler, because M2 inhibitors have important adverse effects and zanamivir requires use of a difficult inhaler device. 18 Legionellosis Legionella infections occur worldwide as sporadic cases. Endemic legionellosis is responsible for approximately 2% of community acquired pneumonia; the highest incidence is in people aged over 40 years, but only a fraction of these cases are recognized. Legionellosis also presents as clusters in large, common-source, outbreaks. A number of such outbreaks have been described among travelers. A European Working Group on Legionella Infection involving 29 countries was started in 1987. During 2000-2002, a total of 113 travelassociated Legionnaires' disease clusters were reported, with the majority linked to hotels. 41 In Sweden 15-30% of all legionella infections are related to travel, either international or domestic. 42 In the UK this proportion presents an increasing trend since the 1970s, with a peak at 46%. 43 Countries whose tourist industries are expanding appear to have higher rates of infection. The Mediterranean region in Europe has been the origin of most reported outbreaks, but no area is immune from the risk, as exemplified by the recent identification of the first cluster of cases associated with a hotel in Bangkok. 44 Transmission is air-borne, but the source of infection is the environment, rather than other persons.",

However, importation of the organism from developing countries where diphtheria remains endemic poses a constant threat, particularly among subgroups of travelers with low vaccination levels. Eastern Europe has been the theater of a largescale resurgence of diphtheria during the 1990s, due to the collapse of the health systems and consequent disruption of the vaccination programs. Almost 20 000 cases of diphtheria were reported in 1993, mainly in the former Russia Federation and Ukraine, with cases identified in neighboring countries including Poland, Norway, Finland, and Germany. 46 Re-emergence of diphtheria has been described in susceptible travelers to these areas. 47 Travelers to endemic areas may act as asymptomatic carriers of the bacterium, and determine secondary cases in unimmunized children in non-endemic areas. 48 Diphtheria presents as a respiratory disease with cough and fever, characterized by pseudomembranous pharyngitis with membrane formation and cervical lymphadenitis, sometimes evolving to cervical edema (bull-neck). Pharyngeal and tracheal membranes are described as thick and gray, bleeding upon attempted removal. A chest X-ray may show subglottic narrowing and bilateral lung hyperinflation. Lethal complications are due to airway mechanical obstruction at laryngeal level and to myocarditis and neuritis resulting from acute systemic toxicity caused by a toxin. Cardiac toxicity consists of both cardiac heart failure and potentially fatal arrhythmia. Clinical suspicion of diphtheria must be confirmed by culture isolation of the bacteria, which demonstrates the presence of a toxigenic strain of Corynebacterium diphtheriae. Microscopic examination of direct stained pharyngeal smear is unreliable. The mainstay of therapy is diphtheria antitoxin, which must be administered as early as possible to neutralize circulating, unbounded toxin. Antibiotic treatment with penicillin or macrolides is indicated to eradicate the organism and terminate toxin production. The notification of a diphtheria case must prompt the implementation of control measures to prevent the spread of toxigenic C. diphtheriae, including taking nose and throat swabs from close contacts, antibiotic prophylaxis, and full immunization or booster doses depending on contacts' immunization history.",

The disease is caused by Burkholderia pseudomallei (Pseudomonas pseudomallei), an aerobic Gram negative bipolar staining bacillus which is free living in earth and water in many tropical and subtropical countries. Melioidosis is rare outside the main endemic regions, namely SE Asia and Northern Australia. Reactivation melioidosis has been reported among tourists, immigrants and Vietnam veterans decades after leaving endemic regions. The infection is acquired by inhalation, ingestion or from contaminated injuries. Many big mammals (cows, horses, pigs) are the reservoir. Human-to-human transmission is extremely rare. Melioidosis remains a risk for travelers to endemic areas, especially in presence of recognized risk factors like adventure tours resulting in extensive exposure to wet season soils and surface water. 49 Lung involvement consists of acute necrotizing pneumonia or chronic granulomatous or fibrosing lung disease mimicking tuberculosis. The diagnosis of pulmonary melioidosis is difficult. It might be suspected in travelers from endemic areas, though cases have reported from areas considered to be non-endemic. 50 The diagnosis can be confirmed by Gram stain and culture of respiratory specimens. The presumptive diagnosis of melioidosis may be based on a positive IHA or ELISA serology. 51,52 IHA titers above 1:80 are suggestive of active infection but can also be seen in asymptomatic subjects in endemic regions. 52 Current therapy recommendations are ceftazidime or imipenem plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, doxycycline or amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, for a period of 2-6 weeks. Maintenance therapy for 3-6 months using either trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, doxycycline or amoxicillin clavulanic acid is also necessary.

Over 85% of the cases of 1996 were reported from Africa, where >85% of the cases occurred in just two countries, Madagascar and United Republic of Tanzania. 54 The major recent worldwide plague epidemic occurred in India, where a total of 5150 suspected pneumonic or bubonic cases occurred from August to October 1994, causing travel and trade disruption and resulting in severe economic repercussions. 55 Travelers are rarely affected by plague while visiting endemic areas; for example, no visitors were affected during the 1994 epidemic in India. Campers or visitors staying in rodent infested lodges are exposed to the highest risk of infection.",

This rate is very similar to that of native populations in the visited countries, and much higher than the 0.01% yearly risk in the Netherlands. 5 Other factors identified for increased TB risk among travelers were: being a healthcare worker, a longer cumulative duration of travel, and a longer total time spent in TB endemic countries. 64 Thus, this demonstrates a previously unrecognized high risk for TB infection among travelers, limited to travels with a duration of \u22653 months.",

Travelers acquiring the infection during travel may be identified by skin conversion in pre-and post-travel tests (Fig. 57.3) . However, tuberculin skin testing and preventive therapy have several drawbacks of operational feasibility, lack of sensitivity/specificity, and poor adherence that will be discussed shortly. At present, the detection of tuberculosis infection is based on the skin reaction to the intradermal injection of M. tuberculosis antigens and detection of an area of induration (conventionally \u226510 mm) at 72 h. Skin-testing of travelers is useful only if the pre-travel test is negative and a post-travel test is conducted 3 months after returning home, to allow time for the immune system to mount a significant skin reaction in case of infection. This therefore requires at least two encounters with the traveler before and two after travel. The possible interference of the booster effect on the significance of a positive tuberculin test might even require two tests (four encounters) before travel, 5 though this is considered unnecessary by most. Sensitivity and specificity of the tuberculin skin test are far from optimal. Rieder estimated that the positive predictive value of a positive tuberculin test with a basic prevalence of 2% is 16%, and is increased only marginally even by a 1% risk of infection during a travel. 68 Until recently, there were no alternatives to the TST for diagnosing latent tuberculosis infection. Alternative tests have now emerged which measure the in vitro production of gamma-interferon by leukocytes stimulated by specific Mycobacterium tuberculosis antigens (such as early secretory antigenic target 6 and culture filtrate protein 10). Such tests may have advantages over the TST, in terms of higher specificity, better correlation with exposure to M. tuberculosis, and no cross-reactivity due to BCG vaccination and non-tuberculous mycobacterial infection. The role of these tests in clinical practice still needs to be defined. 69 Preventive therapy carries additional operational problems. Clinical trials have consistently demonstrated that a standard course of 6-12 months of daily isoniazid is over 90% effective in preventing reactivated TB. 70 However, under field conditions adherence is less than optimal and efficacy is significantly reduced. Finally, the isoniazid chemoprophylaxis regimen is not effective against isoniazid-resistant strains, which now may represent from 5-10% of all strains in resourcepoor countries. Because of all these drawbacks, Rieder has estimated that 14 travelers should be exposed to isoniazid treatment in order to eradicate a single case of latent infection. 71 In summary, a universal strategy of tuberculin testing and preventive therapy for travelers cannot be advocated, at this moment, for both economic and epidemiologic reasons.",
