In humans, they give rise to a spectrum of illnesses called hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) in Eurasia and hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HCPS) in the Americas. HCPS carries a mortality rate of 40%, whereas the mortality in HFRS is lower (0.4%-15%), but the incidence of HFRS is substantially higher. Classically, HFRS occurs in 5 distinct phases: febrile, hypotensive, oliguric, polyuric, and convalescent. Capillary leakage, thrombocytopenia, and acute kidney injury (AKI) are the key elements in the pathogenesis of HFRS. Specific treatment is not available for hantavirus infection. [1] Low platelet count is a hallmark of hantavirus disease, but the severity of bleeding symptoms varies according to the hantavirus species. Signs of bleeding can be noted in up to one-third of the patients infected with the most common European hantavirus, Puumala virus (PUUV). Hemorrhage has been documented in various organs in fatal cases, [2] and mild mucocutaneous involvement has been reported in general. However, thromboembolic complications and increased risk of acute myocardial infarction and stroke have been reported to associate with PUUVinduced HFRS in Swedish patients. [3, 4] The individual balance between enhanced and hampered coagulation prevails and remains challenging.",

            "text": "Recent studies support the idea of platelet contribution to disease progression and binding to fibrin-covered endothelial cells as a mechanism leading to the decreased platelet count during acute hantavirus infection. [1] Upregulated tissue factor (TF) expression on the infected endothelial cells is suggested to induce increased thrombin formation noted during PUUV infection. [5, 6] Compatibly with endothelial cell activation, elevated level of tissue plasminogen activator and D-dimer have both been observed. [6, 7] Findings of enhanced platelet ligands are in concordance with those of increased platelet activation. [8, 9] Large mean platelet volume (MPV) and immature platelet fraction % (IPF%) together with elevated serum thrombopoietin (TPO) level imply active thrombopoiesis. [9, 10] Despite increased platelet production the aggregation is, however, impaired. [10] We here studied serum TPO level and the procoagulant activity of plasma microparticles (MPs) in 33 Finnish patients who were treated in hospital for acute PUUV infection. We analyzed the results in relation with clinical data, platelet function tests in whole blood (platelet function analyzer PFA-100 and Multiplate), and coagulation variables available. Our aim was to study whether active thrombopoiesis could be confirmed during the thrombocytopenia associated with acute hantavirus infection. We also sought to further characterize the procoagulant changes observed in vitro and in vivo. As the prediction of disease severity is still of utmost importance in the treatment of hantavirus infection, we particularly compared the relationship of our findings with the clinical disease severity.",

The MP-Activity test kit is a functional assay measuring procoagulant activity of MPs derived from various cellular sources. [12] In the assay, circulating MPs in the plasma sample bind to Annexin V on the microplate surface and expose their phospholipid surface, which allows prothrombin activation by factor Xa and Va complex in the presence of calcium. The exposed phospholipid concentration reflects the amount of thrombin generation, which is measured using specific thrombin substrate. According the manufacturer, concentration of MPs in normal plasma is usually 5 nmol/L (expressed as phophatidylserine equivalent).",

            "text": "The most evident finding of our study was the 4-fold elevated level of serum TPO during acute PUUV infection compared with the recovery phase. Elevated platelet indices MPV and IPF% imply that bone marrow response to the TPO stimulus is adequate, and decreased platelet count observed during the acute phase of the disease is contributed by factors other than impaired platelet production. The association of high TPO with decreased platelet functions measured both with PFA-100 and Multiplate was observed during thrombocytopenia. It suggests that active thrombopoiesis, though able to provide with clinical hemostasis, is not sufficient to overcome the diminished functional capacity noted in vitro. TPO did not associate with AKI, the major outcome of HFRS. The markedly increased F1 + 2 and D-dimer further support the idea of platelet consumption in the vasculature by ongoing coagulation and fibrinolysis. Their association with variables reflecting AKI is a novel finding in Finnish PUUV-patients, but in line with a previous observation of high D-dimer under severe disease condition in Swedish patients. [3] We could not detect any increase in MPs' procoagulant activity during acute PUUV infection. That finding, however, needs to be explored in more detail, but MPs have been shown to bind to fibrin surfaces, [13] which may be the case during the hantavirus infection. TPO is a humoral growth factor characterized for its ability to stimulate the production and differentiation of megakaryocytes. TPO is mainly produced in the liver and kidneys, and binding of TPO with its receptor c-mPl on platelet surface initiates intracellular signaling including activation of JAK2/signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) pathway. Plasma TPO concentrations vary usually inversely with the platelet count, but mechanisms other than platelet count that affect TPO have also been identified. [14] High plasma concentration of TPO and low platelet count have been reported in patients with Puumala hantavirus, dengue virus, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. [9, 15, 16] In HIV-infected patients, c-mPl expression per platelet is elevated, and recombinant human megakaryocytic growth factor reduces the c-mPl expression and restores platelet count to normal level. [16] In a macaque model of HIV, transforming growth factor b (TGFb) downregulates TPO, and combined antiretroviral therapy corrects both plasma TGFb level and platelet count. [17] In severe acute respiratory syndrome induced by a novel coronavirus, TGFb inhibits the effect of high TPO on megakaryocytopoiesis. [18] Inflammatory mediator interleukin 6 (IL-6), however, increases TPO production both in vitro and in vivo. [14] Our finding of high TPO during acute PUUV infection is in line with a previous observation [9] and consistent with both low platelet count and high plasma IL-6 in acute PUUV infection . [19] High plasma level of TPO is suggested to predict sepsis severity in the early disease phase. [20] We now noted an association between plasma level of TPO and the length of hospital stay, the latter variable describing overall disease severity. However, in this study, TPO had no association with any of the variables reflecting AKI that is the major clinical determinant of hantavirus-induced HFRS.",

They are now seen as mediators of cell-to-cell communication. [24] They express phospholipids and are classically thought to function as procoagulants supporting thrombin formation and facilitating coagulation by factor VII/TF-dependent and -independent pathways. Elevated concentrations of MPs deriving from platelets, endothelial cells, and monocytes have been reported in arterial and venous thrombotic diseases as well as in autoimmune conditions, infectious diseases, hematologic disorders, and cancer. However, the clinical significance of these findings remains controversial. [25, 26] Flow cytometry is the most widely used method to study MPs. [27] Increased TF expression , [5] enhanced thrombin formation, [6] and signs of cellular activation and apoptosis [1] are all present during acute hantavirus infection, and we presumed to detect higher level of MPs' procoagulant activity during the acute phase of the disease compared with the recovery phase. That was, Table 3 Laboratory findings of the two patients with severe Puumala hantavirus infection in the acute phase and at the recovery. however, the finding only among patients with mild kidney injury. In this study, increased thrombin formation (F1 + 2) and fibrinolysis (D-dimer) associated with the severity of AKI, and the attachment of platelet-derived MPs to fibrin clots especially in patients with more severe kidney injury could plausibly explain our observation. [13, 28] Preanalytical measures as well as analytical methods in the detection of MPs' activity are crucial [29] and even if the instructions of the ELISA-assay manufacturer were vigorously followed, the issues regarding methodology cannot be completely excluded. [12] The sample size of the study was, though not large but probably sufficient, as the difference of serum TPO level in the acute phase of the disease compared with the recovery could be verified. MPs' procoagulant activity did not associate with any of the variables depicting disease severity, and it failed to predict clinical outcome in this group of patients with acute Puumala hantavirus infection. Plasma level of TPO or MPs' activity could not predict severe hantavirus disease in the 33 patients of this study, but the 2 severely ill patients had particularly high TPO level and percentage of young platelets as well as very clearly impaired platelet functions according to PFA-100 in the acute phase of the disease ( Table 3 ). The finding regarding MPs' activity on these 2 individual patients was inconsistent and may stem from patients medical history, current treatment as well as the condition itself.",

Serum TPO does not predict disease severity in terms of AKI. Biomarkers of thrombin generation and especially fibrinolysis are high in the absence of clinical thrombosis or major bleedings, and they associate with adverse kidney outcome. As thrombopoiesis is active and the proportion of young platelets is high, measuring the activity of platelet-derived MPs with flow cytometry might clarify the role of MPs in the pathogenesis of HFRS.",
