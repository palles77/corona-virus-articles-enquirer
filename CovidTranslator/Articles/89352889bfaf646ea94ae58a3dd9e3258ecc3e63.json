Here, we summarize the recent understandings about the nucleolar functions, the regulation of nucleolar localization of proteins and the role that the nucleolus plays in virus infection, in which some related studies of Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) US11, UL24 and bovine herpesvirus-1 infected cell protein 27 (BICP27) carried out in our lab will also be included.",

The DFC is a compartment usually associated with FC, and contains newly synthesized pre-rRNAs and some proteins; and the GC is a region of the nucleolus that contains nearly complete preribosomal particles which will be transported to the cytoplasm later. The number of FCs, GCs and DFCs located in the nucleolus depends on the cellular metabolic status [9] . change significantly.

Connection with small protein chains, such as the small ubiquitin like modifier (SUMO) protein [26] , is a process which is both dynamic and reversible, and several SUMOspecific proteases that remove SUMO chains from protein substrates have been described [13] . A new SUMO-specific protease, SENP5, was recently identified and found to be predominantly localized in the nucleolus [8] . Researchers have discovered the first detailed molecular mechanism --GTP-driven cycle--for targeting a protein to the nucleolus [25] . Nucleostemin accumulates in the nucleolus. Its N-terminal basic domain is essential and sufficient for this localization. In addition, the protein harbours two GTP-binding domains, which prompted researchers to test whether these domains determine protein localization. Sure [25] . For example the B23 protein does not have any obvious GTP binding motifs, but its dynamic (BICP27), which localizes predominantly in the nucleolus [12] . Compared with NESs in which the leucine rich export motif (for CRM1 type nuclear export receptors) is available for interaction with the carrier proteins, the structural setting of a NoRS has not been well understood.

            "text": "The viral component that has attracted the most attention is the HIV-1 Rev protein, which is predominantly localized to the nucleolus [14] and interacts with the nucleolar protein B23 [6] . Rev regulates the splicing pattern of the HIV-1 mRNA by promoting unspliced or partially spliced mRNA export to the cytoplasm. Studies suggest that a complex comprising Rev, two nucleoporin proteins, and the nuclear export factor CRM1 (Chromosome region maintenance protein 1) assemble within the nucleolus, which could facilitate movement of this complex to the nuclear pore. The multimerization pattern of Rev in the nucleolus also indicates that it plays a role in nucleocytoplasmic transport [5] . ",

A proteome database of the Arabidopsis thaliana nucleolus has also been made accessible recently (http://bioinf.scri.sari.ac.uk/ cgibin/atnopdb/home [15] . One striking discovery from these proteomic studies is that about 30% of the 155 Virol. Sin. (2010) 25: 151-157 nucleolar proteins are encoded by previously uncharacterized genes. This suggests that in spite of the previous extensive research on the nucleolus over almost two centuries, there is still much to be studied about its structure and function. Moreover, with the recent availability of databases of human and plant nucleolar proteins, bioinformatic techniques could be applied to study new functions of nucleolar proteins [24] and the evolution of this subnuclear region.",

This suggests a role for the nucleolus in regulating sumoylation of proteins that affect progression of cell division. enzyme which maintains telomere by addition of the nucleotide repeats to the ends of chromosomes, that is sequestered in nucleoli until the late stages of S phase when the telomeres are replicated. The nucleolar sequestration of telomerase is reportedly mediated through its binding to the nucleolin which is a nucleolar protein. Therefore, the regulated release from the nucleolar region might ensure the appropriate function of telomerase during DNA replication. Interestingly, the cell cycle dependent sequestration of telomerase into nucleolous could not be detected in either cells that have experienced DNA damage or in cancer cells, which indicates that the loss of telomerase localization into the nucleolus might be an important feature of abnormal cells. Proteomic studies have shown that many proteins of the helicase family have nucleololar localization, some of which accumulate at certain cell cycle stages or as a result of a specific stimulus. It is also interesting that many helicases which are found in the nucleolus can causes human genetic disorders when mutated. Although it's possible that other non-nucleolar functions are likely to be affected, the nucleolar localization of these helicases implies that these specific functions in the processing of DNA or RNA that occur in nucleoli are very important for normal cell growth.CONTROL OF NUCLEOLAR LOCALIZATIONIdentifying the molecular pathways for targeting proteins to the nucleolus is an important part of understanding nucleolar function and its regulation.",

This research directly shows that GTP binding is critical for nucleolar accumulation of nucleostemin. But how general is regulation of nucleolar targeting by GTP binding? A search of the Lamond database shows that about 3% of the over 700 known nucleolar proteins habour a GTP-binding or closely related domain. This indicates that direct regulation by GTP binding is a relevant but not a major mechanism for nucleolar targeting. On the other hand,Tsai and Mckay have found that GTP binding-controlled localization of some nucleolar proteins may indirectly affect the localization of other proteins",

VIRAL PROTEINS LOCALIZE TO THE NUCLEOLOUS The interaction between viruses and the nucleolus is a common phenomenon for many viruses, which is exhibited by DNA viruses, retroviruses and RNA viruses. They interact with the nucleolus to take over host cell functions and recruit nucleolar proteins to help with virus replication. Adenovirus infection changes nucleolar structure and function. B23 is a nucleolar protein present in two isoforms (B23.1 and B23.2) and both isoforms have been identified as stimulatory factors that can facilitate adenovirus DNA replication.
