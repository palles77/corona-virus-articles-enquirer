Thankfully there have been, as of yet, no confirmed cases of Hajj-associated Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in Saudi Arabia or abroad. Screening PCR (E gene) for the virus was positive in three samples from a 61-year-old woman who returned to Spain from the 2013 Hajj pilgrimage on 1 November and one of her contacts who was accompanying her on the Hajj journey who developed symptoms on the same day and was suspected to have acquired the infection from the first case [1] . The first patient, who had no pre-existing medical condition, attended Hajj during October in Saudi Arabia. She became symptomatic 3 days before departure and attended a hospital in Makkah where pneumonia was confirmed by chest X-ray. In-flight to Spain she needed oxygen and was hospitalized on arrival in Madrid. However, sequencing for MERS-CoV has, to date, been unsuccessful and definitive confirmatory tests were negative [1] . If positive, this could be the first European case of post-Hajj-associated MERS-CoV with a second case among very close contacts.",

Sacrificing four-footed animals, including a small proportion of camels, is part of the Hajj rituals, and between 1 and 2 million animals are sacrificed at designated abattoirs located within walking distance of pilgrims' tents (Fig. 2) . Although official slaughtering is now performed by proxy by professional abattoir workers, the meat is consumed by pilgrims, many of whom also enjoy camel rides or photographs during their stay in Makkah. In recent studies, a very high prevalence of neutralizing antibodies against MERS-CoV has been found in Arabian camels of the Middle East and Egypt [11, 12] . Also, a camel in Jeddah has been reported to have an active infection (i.e. PCR positive), whose owner was also infected [13] . Bats have been suspected as a possible source for the MERS-CoV with part of the genome identified in a faecal sample from an Egyptian tomb bat captured in the living vicinity of a patient from Bisha, Saudi Arabia [14] . Human contact with fruit bat excreta/secretions, by consuming unwashed fruits, especially dates which are a Hajj delicacy, might increase the risk of MERS-CoV.",

A recent survey conducted among French pilgrims has shown that these measures are acceptable to pilgrims [18] .

Misleading media reports should be rapidly corrected. Healthcare workers who look after the pilgrims also need education about the disease, its prevention, diagnosis and reporting. Diagnostic tests should be readily available to front-line medical staff. Any returned Hajj pilgrim presenting with symptoms suggestive of respiratory infection, particularly pneumonia, should be suspected of having MERS-CoV, and contact tracing of confirmed cases is essential.",

Targeted research to identify the source(s) of MERS-CoV, modes of transmission, therapeutic options, vaccine development and other preventive actions are all a priority. With respect to prevention, we embarked on a large trial to assess the efficacy of facemasks against respiratory viruses including MERS-CoV and influenza at this year's Hajj and this will continue next year. We hope the trial will determine if facemasks are effective in preventing viral respiratory infection such as MERS-CoV and influenza.",
