In this study, a novel alumina nanofiber filter was assessed for its removal and retention capability for MS2 aerosol. Its physical removal efficiency in the 10-400 nm range was 94.35%, while its viable removal efficiency was 98.87%, which was slightly lower than three conventional HEPA filters tested. However, its pressure drop was much lower than HEPA filters, yielding a higher filter quality than HEPA filters. The average extracted fraction from the nanofiber filter was 8.64\u00d710 \u22122 \u00b1 7.00\u00d710 \u22122 , which is three orders lower than other HEPA filters, demonstrating that the viruses were effectively retained in the nanofiber filter. Furthermore, the performance of the nanofiber filter showed no dependence on relative humidity. In conclusion, this novel alumina nanofiber filter presents advantageous potential for removal and retention of viral aerosol agents.",

Fig. 2 shows a schematic drawing of the experimental system. The bioaerosol was generated by a six-jet Collison nebulizer (Model CN25, BGI Inc., Waltham, MA) and passed through a dilution drier to remove the moisture. The virus concentration in the nebulizer was around 10 7 PFU/mL and was prepared by diluting 0.1 mL of virus stock suspension in 50 mL of sterile DI water. The corresponding MS2 aerosol concentration was approximately 4000 PFU/L. The temperature and humidity of the air stream were measured by a thermometer and a RH meter (Model HX94C, OMEGA Engineering Inc., Stamford, CT), respectively. The airflow was then divided into two parallel streams. One stream that contained the test filter was designed for experimental collection while the other, which had no test filter, served as the control. The bioaerosol was collected by a biosampler (SKC Inc., Eighty-Four, PA) that had 15 mL of phosphate buffer solution (PBS) as collection liquid. MS2 collected in the biosampler was then enumerated following the procedures in Adams (1959) and plates were incubated at 37 \u2022 C for 18 h. The experiment was conducted at 22 \u00b1 2 \u2022 C and 50 \u00b1 5% RH for 30-min intervals, and the face velocity of filtration was 26.0 cm/s. In addition, the nanofiber filter was tested in three RHs (35%, 50% and 75%) to determine its response to different environmental conditions. RH was regulated by controlling the ratio of dry cylinder air to the nebulizer flow. The pressure drop of the test filter was measured using a pressure gauge (2010AV C, Dwyer Instruments, Michigan City, IN). ",

The PSDs of penetrating aerosol from the four filters are also shown in Fig. 3a . The most penetrating aerosol size was around 100 nm, which is smaller than the 0.3-m standard that is commonly used in filter testing (NIOSH, 2005) (Fig. 3b) . The corresponding minimum PRE of the nanofiber filter for 100 nm was around 75%, which is lower than other HEPA filters tested. Compared to other filters tested for MS2 aerosol reported in the literature, this alumina nanofiber filter's PRE is higher than 1.0-m and 3.0-m pore size polycarbonate filters (68% and 27%), but slightly lower than PTFE and gelatine filters ( > 96%) (Burton et al., 2007) . The VREs of the nanofiber and three conventional filters are shown in Table 1 . As shown, the nanofiber filter's VRE was slightly lower than the other filters. The difference between PRE and VRE implies that the virus distribution does not follow the number size distribution of the aerosol (Hogan et al., 2005) , although no detailed information regarding virus distribution in aerosol is available yet. SEM and TEM images of nanofiber filters after the MS2 filtration experiment and vortexing extraction are shown in Figs. 1b and d.

This phenomenon indicates that viruses were effectively retained in the nanofiber filter, due to electrostatic attraction between the electropositive fiber surface and electronegative MS2 particles. In contrast, the EFs of the other three filters were all greater than one. Theoretically, the EF should be less than one. However, the feed MS2 concentration determined by the biosampler collection was an underestimate because the biosampler had low collection efficiency for nanometer particles ( < 10% for 30-100 nm; Hogan et al., 2005) . With effective extraction, the EF therefore can be great than one. Unfortunately, there is no existing bioaerosol sampling method that allows better viable sampling and liquid impingement is the commonly accepted method (Hogan et al., 2005; Wang & Brion, 2007) .

The isoelectric point of MS2 is pH 3.9 and thus the MS2 is electronegative above this value (Ackermann & Dubow, 1987; Zhu et al., 2005) . On the other hand, the zeta potential of nanofiber media is +50 mV at pH 7 (Tepper & Kaledin, 2007) . To further verify the electrostatic attraction, experiments were carried out with four fresh filters added to a suspension of known MS2 concentration (\u223c10 7 PFU/mL) and the suspension was vortexed for up to 10 min. The results are shown in Fig. 4 . The infectivity of MS2 on the nanofiber filter decreased dramatically with an increase in vortexing time. In contrast, the infectivity of MS2 on the other three filters had a ",

Apparently, the performance of the nanofiber was not affected by RH change. It has been reported that high RHs decrease the removal efficiencies of electret filters (Motyl & Lowkis, 2006; Moyer & Stevens, 1989; Raynor & Chae, 2004; Yang et al., 2007) due to the reduction of charges within the filter. For non-electret filters that rely on mechanical removal mechanisms, RH imposes no significant effect on the removal (Huang & Yang, 2006; Kim, Bao, Okuyama, Shimada, & Niinuma, 2006) . Wang and Brion (2007) showed that glass microfiber filter had similar performance at 23% and 50% RHs after the filter had reached a steady-state condition. Compared to electrets where the charge is induced during manufacture, the nanofiber's charge is intrinsic in the way the alumina is formed. Hence, the charge is not water sensitive and is retained in bulk water.",

It presented lower PRE and VRE than conventional HEPA filters, but its pressure drop was much lower due to smaller drag force on the nanofiber surface. Hence, the nanofiber filter presented the best filter quality. The EF of nanofiber filter was three orders lower than the HEPA filters, demonstrating that viruses were effectively retained in the nanofiber filter due to electrostatic attraction. While the performance of conventional electret filters decreases at higher RHs, different RHs imposed no effects on the nanofiber filter's ability to remove aerosol.",
