Closely related coronaviruses have been isolated in bats, but most evidence suggests that humans have become infected directly from camels in a number of separate transmission events, with limited human-to-human transmission reported thus far. The majority of cases originated in the Middle East (predominantly Saudi Arabia), including all the index cases. Clinical manifestations primarily involve fever, chills, and rapidly progressive respiratory failure, often resulting in an acute respiratory distress syndrome, with a minority of patients reporting gastrointestinal symptoms, as well. The majority of critically ill patients are older males with medical co-morbidities, and a large number of minimally symptomatic cases likely go undetected. Unfortunately, attempted therapies have all been unsuccessful thus far, and treatment remains supportive care.",

In his posting, he described the previous isolation (June 2012) of a coronavirus from sputum, which was identified by a pancoronavirus reverse transcriptase (RT) PCR assay from a 60-year-old male patient with acute respiratory and renal failure of unknown etiology in the city of Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Three days later, another posting on ProMEDmail appeared, describing a 49-year-old male Qatari national with a history of travel to Saudi Arabia who developed similar fulminant symptoms of respiratory failure in a London hospital. These cases then generated interest regarding an earlier, unsolved outbreak that occurred in March and April 2012 in Zarqa, Jordan, involving 11 patients, including 8 health care workers (HCWs), and resulting in 2 deaths. PCR testing of banked samples later confirmed these cases as MERS-CoV infection (1, 2) .",

The median age of infected patients was 52 years, with a significant predominance of men affected, at a 2:1 male/female ratio. A large majority of patients had underlying co-morbidities: 76% in an earlier update by the WHO MERS-CoV research group. The most common Vol. 36, No. 15 August 1, 2014 www.cmnewsletter.com co-morbidity is chronic kidney disease (13.3%), followed by diabetes mellitus (10%), heart disease (7.5%), and immunocompromised status (3%). Almost 2/3 of patients (63.4%) experienced severe respiratory disease. Although only 11% of reported cases were asymptomatic, the true number of minimally symptomatic or asymptomatic cases in the community is likely much greater. Interestingly, some stark differences have been found between primary/index cases and secondary cases. Primary cases have been in older individuals (average age, 58 years) and have occurred predominantly (reported to be as high as 80%) in men; secondary cases have been in individuals with an average age of 45 years, with 58% men affected. In addition, the difference in severity has been astounding: 90.2% of primary cases have been classified as severe or fatal disease as opposed to 49.5% of secondary cases (4, 5) .",

Since the first detected cases in March and April 2012 in Zarqa, Jordan, the number of detected cases did not increase significantly until around April 2013. This is in part due to the expansion of aggressive screening recommended in the fall of 2012 by the Saudi Arabian Ministry of Health (MoH), not only of hospitalized patients with fever and respiratory symptoms, but also of their close contacts (5,6).",

            "text": "Thus far, no evidence has been found for sustained community transmission of MERS-CoV, secondary attack rates among family members have been low, and nosocomial spread to HCWs and other patients has been reasonably limited. Clusters among family members, as well as hospital clusters among patients and HCWs, have been reported in a number of countries. Studies of these clusters have allowed the calculation of an estimated incubation time of 5 to 14 days (6) . The true prevalence of the disease is difficult to estimate, as there are likely a number of cases that have been asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic in the community that went unrecognized, especially in younger, healthier patients. Attempts to identify some of these cases have been made, including in a large prospective study by Memish et al. (7) aimed at the widespread screening of MERS-CoV contacts in Saudi Arabia using PCR of respiratory tract samples. Over a 12-month period starting in September 2012, 5,065 individuals were screened, with detection of 108 cases (99 adults and 9 children), for a case detection rate of approximately 2%. Of the total population screened, the majority of positive cases were hospitalized patients with suspected infection, and the rest were almost evenly split between HCWs with exposure to confirmed MERS-CoV cases and family contacts. The authors note that cases were likely missed, given that serology was not used in the screening process to screen for resolved infections. Although the case detection rate for HCWs was only around 1.1%, it should be noted that the MoH in Saudi Arabia had been aggressive in their infection control practices, including the recommendation for contact and airborne precautions early in the epidemic.",

The index patient was transferred to the German hospital approximately 19 days after his symptoms began and was not diagnosed with MERS-CoV infection until 1 month after his initial admission in Qatar. The authors identified 123 contacts of the patient, 85 of whom underwent serological testing by a 2-stage approach.

Nine HCWs had performed aerosol-generating procedures within the 3rd or 4th week of the patient's illness. Notably, none of the 85 contacts, most of whom were HCWs, tested positive for MERS-CoV.",

They noted that the men and adolescent males shared meals, socialized, and worshipped together, notably separate from their wives and children. When the index patient became ill, he was tended to at home by women in the household and the 2 sons who became ill; however, once he was hospitalized, the wives rarely visited, while the sons continued to tend to their father before they themselves fell ill. Similarly to the wives, the children had very limited contact once the male patients were hospitalized.

The case fatality rate among this cohort was 60%, split evenly between males and females. Comorbid medical disorders were found in the vast majority of patients (96%). The most common comorbid disorders included diabetes mellitus in more than one-third of the patients (68%), chronic kidney disease in almost half (49%), hypertension (34%), and chronic heart disease (28%); only one patient was on long-term immunosuppression with steroids. The authors noted a few important factors in regard to these statistics.

In 2006, Woo et al. (15) performed a coronavirus surveillance study of bats in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and found 6 different novel coronaviruses among 13 species of bats in that region alone. The finding that SARS-CoV had originated and that MERS-CoV may have originated in bats is not surprising given a number of factors. The investigators noted that bat behavior includes the ability to fly as high as 5,000 meters and roosting with large numbers of other bats. Annan et al. (16) found that juvenile and lactating female bats were much more likely to harbor coronaviruses than adult or non-lactating females, arguing that bat maternity colonies likely play a role in the amplification of coronaviruses. In addition, a given bat species can become infected with multiple species of coronaviruses. These factors can facilitate viral genetic exchange among coronaviruses, not only in other bats, but in other species of animals. Given that coronaviruses have a high frequency of recombination and high mutation rates, infection of bats creates a \"perfect storm\" for the creation of novel coronaviruses that can adapt to infect humans.",

Lau et al.

Annan et al. (16) targeted bat species in Ghana, as well as 4 countries in Europe (Germany, The Netherlands, Romania, and Ukraine), also using the RdRp gene target.

The results showed that 7 of the 15 human cell lines met these criteria, including cells from the lower airway, kidney, intestinal tract, and liver, as well as histiocytes. These findings correlate with the clinical findings of severe pulmonary disease in most patients and with acute renal injury, gastrointestinal symptoms, and mild hepatitis noted in a minority of patients.

They demonstrated extensive apoptosis but noted that the apoptotic cells were different from the cells expressing viral proteins based on lack of co-staining, suggesting a paracrine mechanism of apoptosis rather than direct infection. Raj et al. (28) were able to identify the cellular receptor to which MERS-CoV binds, known as dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4). In general, coronaviruses bind to host cell surface receptors using a specific domain of their spike (S) entry protein; SARS-CoV uses the metallopeptidase angiotensin-converting enzymes 2 (ACE2). DPP4 is a type II transmembrane glycoprotein present on the cell surface that has many functions, including roles in glucose metabolism, T cell activation, chemotaxis modulation, cell adhe-sion, and apoptosis. Primary sites of expression in humans include the kidney, small intestine, and liver and prostate epithelial cells, as well as activated leukocytes. These investigators proved their hypothesis by a number of methods, using cell lines including Vero and Huh-7 (human liver) cells. These methods included inhibition of Vero cell infection with soluble DPP4, blockage of infection of Huh-7 cells after pre-incubation with polyclonal DPP4 antiserum before virus inoculation, and finally transformation of previously non-susceptible Cos-7 cells into cells capable of MERS-CoV infection through transfection with a human DPP4 expression plasmid. In addition, they demonstrated that a number of common coronaviruses, including CoV-229E and OC43, were unable to infect human cells expressing DPP4.",

X rays revealed localized infiltration and interstitial markings, and autopsy findings showed congestion and scattered nodules with microscopic multifocal interstitial pneumonia and exudative changes. Interestingly, no extrapulmonary lesions were observed, including within the kidneys, despite the observed moderate incidence of renal failure in human infection. PCR was notably positive from lung homogenate but negative from oropharyngeal, nasal, and cloacal swabs and from additional organs. Neutralizing antibodies appeared on day 7 after infection and peaked at day 14. None of the infected monkeys died. Munster et al. (32) performed a similar experiment but used older monkeys (aged 6 to 12 years), and they reported findings of reduced appetite, cough, tachypnea, piloerection, and hunched posture, as well as serum laboratory results that included leukocytosis. In addition, their pathologic results included \"multifocal to coalescent bright red lesions throughout the lower respiratory tract\" with progression to \"dark reddish purple areas\u2026 with fibrous adhesions, consolidation, and edematous and atelectatic areas in the lungs.\"",

Ribavirin, a nucleoside analog, can inhibit RNA replication and has a wide spectrum of anti-viral activity. Falzarano et al. (36) designed an experimental model using infected Vero and LLC-MK2 cells to test the effects of ribavirin and interferon. They defined markers of treatment success, including reduction in both the number of viral genome copies and cytopathic effect. A dose-dependent reduction in genome copies was noted for interferon, reaching a 1.84-log-unit reduction at 5,000 U/ml, and for ribavirin, reaching a 2.04-log-unit reduction at 2,000 g/ml. Similar success was noted in regard to reduction in cytopathic effect, with elimination at 1,000 U/ml for interferon and at 200 \u03bcg/ml for ribavirin. However, the authors noted that these concentrations are likely not safely achievable in humans. Once the two drugs were combined, though, they were able to achieve an 8-to 16-fold decrease in the doses required, making it theoretically possible to achieve therapeutic levels in humans.",

Notably, all 5 patients were of advanced age (average age, 62 years) with significant comorbidities, and treatment was not started until 19 days after admission, due in part to difficulty with diagnosis. In contrast, Falzarano et al. (38) demonstrated promising results in infected rhesus macaques with this treatment combination. They demonstrated improvement in pulmonary edema, a decrease in serum and pulmonary pro-inflammatory markers, and a reduction in viral genome copies. These results may be quite difficult to replicate in infected humans, however, because treatment was started only 8 hours after inoculation with the virus.",

A significantly higher number of SARS patients had anti-MERS-CoV immunoglobulin G by indirect immunofluorescence testing (61%, with titers ranging from 1:20 to 1:320, compared to 2.1% of the animal handlers, with titers of only 1:20 to 1:40, and none of the healthy blood donors). Using neutralization antibody testing, the authors found that 25% of SARS patients had low MERS-CoV neutralizing antibodies (titers of 1:20 or less) in comparison to none of the animal handlers or healthy blood donors. These results supported the hypothetical role of convalescent sera from recovered SARS patients in providing some degree of active antibody but suggest that intravenous immunoglobulin from healthy donors may not be helpful. Another option along the same line is to use convalescent serum from recovered MERS-CoV patients, as was tried with serum from recovered SARS patients with questionable success during the SARS-CoV epidemic (39) .",
