Although oral cGVHD occurs in >25 % of cGVHD patients and leads to decreased quality of life, its etiology is poorly understood. The present retrospective cross-sectional analysis of oral cGVHD patients sought to (1) test the feasibility of liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) to identify protein biomarkers of oral cGVHD and (2) to gain a clearer understanding of salivary proteins impacted by oral cGVHD. Methods Using unstimulated whole saliva, we compared pooled saliva from five patients with a diagnosis of moderate or severe oral cGVHD, with a gender-and age-matched pool of five cGVHD patients with no oral mucosal findings. LC-MS/MS was used to identify salivary proteins, followed by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA). Selected mass spectrometric findings, including lactotransferrin, lactoperoxidase, and albumin, were confirmed by targeted label-free quantification.",

Of these proteins, 102 changed in abundance at least 2 fold, including 12 proteins identified only in the No oral cGVHD group. Downregulation of~0.4 fold was confirmed for both lactotransferrin and lactoperoxidase in Oral cGVHD saliva using targeted label-free quantification. IPA analysis implicated pathways involved in cellular metabolism and immunoregulation. Conclusions Reduction of salivary lactoperoxidase, lactotransferrin, and several cysteine proteinase inhibitor family proteins suggests impaired oral antimicrobial host immunity in cGVHD patients. This shotgun proteomic analysis of oral cGVHD saliva using targeted label-free quantification of select proteins supports the use of mass spectrometry for future validation in a large patient population as noninvasive tests for screening, early detection, and monitoring of cGVHD.",

Considerable advances in detection and identification of the salivary proteome in the past several years have enabled finer analysis of the contents of saliva, and more detailed connections to systemic pathways [17, 18] . Consequently, the aim of the present study was twofold. First, to identify protein markers of oral cGVHD which could lead to improved diagnosis and monitoring after therapeutic intervention. Currently, the diagnostic gold standard for oral cGVHD is a clinical exam paired with biopsy of the buccal mucosa. Given that serial mucosal biopsy is not recommended for monitoring of the oral cavity, it would be preferable from the standpoint of both patient and practitioner to identify salivary markers for non-invasive serial testing. Second, a clearer understanding of salivary proteins impacted by oral cGVHD will elicit information about the mechanisms and etiological process of oral cGVHD which, in turn, could lead to development of more specific therapy.",

            "text": "Salivary proteomic technology is an emerging science whose advancement is driving the field of salivary diagnostics to identify and understand disease processes. In the current pilot study, we applied cutting-edge salivary proteomic techniques to the identification of proteins in the pooled saliva of age-and gender-matched cGVHD patients with and without oral cGVHD with the overarching goal of determining the potential of these techniques for GVHD saliva analysis. In this study, a total of 180 proteins were confidently identified. Amongst these proteins, hemoglobin subunit alpha and hemoglobin subunit beta were identified, which may be due to contamination of saliva samples from hemolysis of red blood cells. The alpha and beta hemoglobin subunits have also been detected in whole ductal saliva, collected directly from a cannulated parotid gland, which strongly suggests that these 2 subunits of hemoglobin may be an intrinsic part of saliva. It is postulated that these blood proteins may enter normal saliva through the leaky epithelium in the parotid and potentially other salivary glands. Their detected levels did not differ between groups in this study, so blood contamination of cGVHD saliva is not considered to be a major confounding factor. A \u22652 or \u22640.5 fold change cut-off [23] was applied to the above list, resulting in the identification of 102 differentially expressed proteins. A two-fold cut-off of differentially expressed proteins indicates doubling, or 100 % increase in the expression ratio. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) analysis was performed on 102 differentially expressed proteins leading to identification of 12 canonical pathways involved in the Oral cGVHD population compared to No oral cGVHD controls. Targeted free label confirmation focused on 3 proteins: lactotransferrin, lactoperoxidase and albumin, and detected significant downregulation of both lactotransferrin and lactoperoxidase, but no change in albumin levels, in the saliva of GVHD subjects. Among the identified pathways, a majority of the proteins were related to cellular metabolism (glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, inositol, glutathione, pyruvate, argnine and proline metabolism), and immune signaling (IL-17 and primary immunodeficiency signaling). Although pathway analysis using IPA on these proteins does not provide stringent evidence for their direct association in cGVHD pathophysiology, it may provide new insight into potentially important networks for in-depth mechanistic analysis to validate their involvement in disease pathogenesis. Clinical presentation of oral cGVHD includes atrophy, erythema, hyperkeratosis, lichenoid reactions, ulcerations, and edema, here seen on the lower lip (e), maxillary anterior gingiva (f), and buccal mucosa (g) of a patient with oral cGVHD, as compared with the normal intraoral mucosa of a patient with no oral cGVHD (ac). H&E staining of the oral mucosa from the above-matched patients demonstrates characteristic GVHD-like changes in the buccal mucosa compared with No oral cGVHD tissue (d), including prevalent lymphocytic infiltrate and apoptotic bodies (h). Buccal biopsy sections are shown in similar orientation at 10x magnification",

There, lactoperoxidase catalyzes oxidation of certain intermediates within the phenyalanine pathway. However, lactoperoxidase is also a natural antimicrobial compound found in mammalian saliva, mucus and milk [24] . The natural acceptor molecule for lactoperoxidase in the body is thiocyanate, whose oxidation product, hypothiocyanate, is a potent antibacterial compound that inhibits the growth of an array of bacteria. At high concentrations, lactoperoxidase functions to directly kill certain bacteria, including Escherichia coli, Pseudamonas aeruginosa and Haemophilus influenza, and to limit replication of human immunodeficiency virus [24, 25] .",

            "text": "Of particular interest is the reduction in detectable lactotransferrin in saliva of cGVHD patients. Lactotransferrin is an iron-binding glycoprotein found in high concentrations in epithelial secretions including saliva and human milk. This multi-functional antimicrobial compound is found in the secondary granules of neutrophils and also acts as a primary defense against bacteria via sequestration of iron that results in release of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from the outer microbial membrane and thereby stymies bacterial growth [26, 27] . Furthermore, low levels of lactotransferrin act synergistically with other antimicrobial compounds to increase overall potency and rate of bacterial killing [27] . This protein acts not only as an antimicrobial compound, but also has mitogenic capacity, and plays a role in the activation of the cellular immune system through TLR4-dependant and independent macrophage activation [28, 29] . Lactotransferrin involvement has been previously implicated in oral and gut cGVHD [16, 30] . A 2001 case report detailed successful use of supplemental lactoferrin to treat gut GVHD refractory to conventional immunosuppressive therapy [30] . A 2007 saliva survey from our group found increased salivary levels of lactotransferrin through 6-months post-transplant in GVHD patients. In contrast, the present study and included a post-transplant agematched patient population that was much later, on average, 45-months [16] . Involvement in both screens, however, clearly implicates lactotransferrin in an altered salivary proteome following HSCT. Several members of the cysteine proteinase inhibitor family were identified in this study. Cystatin-SA, cystatin-C, cystatin-B, cystatin-S and cystatin-D were down-regulated in oral cGVHD, while cystatin-SN did not change in abundance. These proteins are secreted extracellularly, where they inhibit proteinases, thereby limiting proteolysis and tissue damage [31, 32] . Cystatin D is a potent inhibitor of human coronavirus at physiologic salivary concentrations [33] . Thus, lower levels of these proteins may be lead to increased tissue damage and lower defenses against common viral infections.",
