Although great advances have been achieved in methods of diagnosis, it remains challenging to identify pathogens in unexplained pneumonia (UP) cases. In this study, we applied next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology and a metagenomic approach to detect and characterize respiratory viruses in UP cases from Guizhou Province, China. A total of 33 oropharyngeal swabs were obtained from hospitalized UP patients and subjected to NGS. An unbiased metagenomic analysis pipeline identified 13 virus species in 16 samples. Human rhinovirus C was the virus most frequently detected and was identified in seven samples. Human measles virus, adenovirus B 55 and coxsackievirus A10 were also identified. Metagenomic sequencing also provided virus genomic sequences, which enabled genotype characterization and phylogenetic analysis. For cases of multiple infection, metagenomic sequencing afforded information regarding the quantity of each virus in the sample, which could be used to evaluate each viruses' role in the disease.

In contrast, recently developed next-generation sequencing technology (NGS) combined with a highly sensitive random amplification method can provide a comprehensive view of the pathogenic agents in a given sample, making it suitable for identifying novel and unexpected pathogens Zoll et al., 2015) . Moreover, metagenomic sequencing could provide detailed genomic information of the pathogens present in samples, which could be used for genotype characterization and phylogenetic analysis. Based on the taxonomic assignment of output sequences, clinicians can further evaluate the individual influence of each pathogen to disease development (Graf et al., 2016) .

Based on the definition of UP cases, viruses should be the main causative agents. Our metagenomic sequencing identified 13 virus types in 16 samples among a total 33 cases tested. All the viruses were identified to the strain or genotype level, as demonstrated by human adenovirus B 55 and HCkV A10. HRV-C was the virus most frequently detected. Although we could not conclude that HRV-C was the causative pathogen of the UP cases because of its high prevalence in non-symptomatic individuals , attention should be given to HRV-C in young patients, such as the 1-month-old infant case in our study (CN24), as there is evidence that HRV-C may be more virulent in children with pneumonia (Khetsuriani et al., 2008) .",

Measles is a highly contagious disease characterized by a high fever, cough, and maculopapular rash. Its clinical symptoms are so characteristic that the measles virus is generally not included in common multiple PCR panels, such as the FDA-cleared GenMark eSensor RVP (Pierce and Hodinka, 2012) and CE-IVD-labeled RespiFinder SMART 22 FAST PCR panel (Dabisch-Ruthe et al., 2012) , which cover 14 and 22 respiratory pathogens, respectively. The scenario in our study of an infant as young as one month of age infected with measles is a rarity, as protection owing to maternal antibodies usually exists during this early period of life (Kili\u00e7 et al., 2003) . Thus, identification of the causative agent in such cases would be relatively difficult using routine PCR-based assays. Conversely, our unbiased metagenomic approach directly identified this virus, and we were able to assemble the complete genome sequence, allowing a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis and sequence characterization. Moreover, taxonomic assignment of the total reads indicated that the measles virus accounted for the greatest proportion of NGS output data. Given that no other pathogens were detected in the sample, we are substantially confident that the measles virus was the pathogen causing UP in this infant.",

Indeed, the read count ratio of the three virus correlated with the virus burden determined by dPCR (Table 2) .

Based on the complete genome sequence of the measles virus assembled for CN31, we found that the critical sites in HA responsible for protein folding and antigenic epitopes are conserved between our case and the vaccine strain. The phylogenetic analysis also indicated that this virus belongs to a local circulating lineage. Metagenomic sequencing also assembled the complete genome sequence of HCkV in CN12, and we further determined that it is of the A10 genotype. The HCkV sequence we detected clustered with A10 strains isolated in China in 2013 ( Figure 3B) , a time when CV-A10 infections were increasing in some regions of the country (Yang et al., 2015) . CV-A10 was demonstrated to be associated with severe complications in hand-foot-mouth disease (Lu et al., 2012) , which suggests a critical role of this virus in the severe pneumonia of this infant.

Sentinel hospitals in CHUPSN performed UP case identification and clinical sample collection. According to CHUPSN guidelines, a UP case should be accompanied by fever (>38\u00b0C) and pneumonia radiographic results as well as a normal or slightly decreased number of total white blood cells or a decreased lymphocyte differential count in the early stage of the disease. Moreover, no improvement is observed in UP cases after regular antibiotic treatment. After a UP case was defined, an oropharyngeal swab was sampled from the patient and stored in viral transport medium (VTM) at \u221280\u00b0C until testing. The VTM was transferred to the local center for disease control and prevention (CDC) for influenza A (FluA) virus testing by real-time PCR. This study focused on UP patients who developed severe clinical symptoms and required hospitalization in Guizhou Province from 2013 to 2014. Only FluA-negative samples were processed by metagenomic sequencing. A total of 33 patients, 24 males and nine females aged from one month to 82 years, were ultimately enrolled (Table S1 in Supporting Information). All the participants (or guardian for children) provided written informed consent.
