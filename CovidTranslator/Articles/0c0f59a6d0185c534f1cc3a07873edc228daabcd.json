Pooled samples were spiked with various organisms, serially diluted, and extracted in duplicate. The organisms/matrices were Bordetella pertussis/bronchoalveolar lavage, herpes simplex virus II/cerebrospinal fluid, coxsackievirus A9/cerebrospinal fluid, BK virus/plasma, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae/endotracheal tube samples. Extracts were amplified in duplicate using realtime PCR assays, and amplification of the target at a cycle threshold of 35 using the manual method was used for comparison. Amplification efficiency of nucleic acids extracted by automated methods was similar to that by the manual method except for a loss of efficiency for M. pneumoniae in endotracheal tube samples. The EZ1 viral kit 2.0 gave better results for coxsackievirus A9 than the EZ1 viral kit version 1.0. At the lowest limit of detection (past a cycle threshold of 35), the easyMAG was more likely to produce amplifiable nucleic acid than were either the EZ1 or manual extraction. Operational complexity, defined as the number of manipulations required to obtain an extracted sample, was the lowest for the easyMAG. The easyMAG was the most expensive of the methods, followed by the EZ1 kit and manual extraction",

Most reports describe subsequent PCR amplification with quantitation of the target to define the quality of extracted nucleic acid, which is a functional means of determining quantity and purity. [2] [3] [4] 8, 9 Others have used a difference in cycle threshold to assess amplification efficiency as a reflection of the quality of the nucleic acid. 1, 2 Our assessment of extraction efficiency most reflected the method used by Loens et al, 1 who compared the NucliSENS easyMAG and miniMAG with the QIAamp Blood Mini Kit for extraction of M. pneumoniae and C. pneumoniae from clinical samples. These authors noted that the easyMAG extraction yielded a positive result with a lower cycle threshold in 66% of blood samples analyzed for cytomegalovirus. Our study was designed slightly differently in that we used dilutions of organisms in various samples instead of running clinical samples. This allowed for comparisons to be made at the limit of detection, as well as at higher concentrations of organism.",

This was further illustrated in the interassay studies performed, which showed that the CV% across all dilutions was acceptable, although samples at the lowest concentration dilutions showed a higher CV% (data not shown). One other notable finding in our study was the fact that extraction using the easyMAG was more likely to result in PCR amplification past the defined limit of detection for most organisms, compared with either the EZ1 or manual extraction.

This analysis revealed that there were 280 total steps to produce nucleic acid from 15 samples, compared with 534 for the manual extraction. Surprisingly, the EZ1 required the greatest number of manipulations, totaling 762, largely due to the increased number of steps required for sample preparation before extraction. This results in a greater chance of error and deviation from protocol. Total time to completion decreased when using the easyMAG, but because of the large sample volume performed (15 samples), the EZ1 needed three runs to complete all samples, causing the time to completion to increase to much higher then the easyMAG.
