This was then used to build a three-dimensional structure to recognize nucleotide acids. Fourier transformation infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, 29 Si solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance, and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller instruments were used to characterize this 3D aerogel, demonstrating that it had high porosity and large internal networking surface area that could capture nucleotide acids. The functionality of molecular recognition on nucleotide acids was demonstrated by immobilizing an oligonucleotide to probe its DNA target and confirming the tagged fluorescent signals by confocal laser scanning microscopy. The results indicated that the as-prepared 3D bioaerogel was capable of providing a very large surface area to capture and recognize human gene ATP5O.",

The main common character of these materials as biosensor matrices is their vast 3D internal surface area, which functions as a substrate capable of immobilizing oligonucleotide probes or ligand receptors to capture more biological target molecules than traditional planar substrates. However, the problems of fragility and thermal resistance of these materials have not been thoroughly addressed, limiting the application of these materials. As we show in this contribution, silica aerogel can provide a good solution to these problems.",

Although the supercritical drying method is also a viable option to produce the aerogels [8, 11] , in order to avoid the harsh conditions of high temperature and high pressure used in this technique, in this study, the aerogel was prepared by the sol-gel process with a reusable ionic liquid (IL) as the solvent and pore-forming agent. The unique properties of IL, including negligible vapor pressure and ionicity, allowed the hydrolysis and condensation of the sol-gel polymerization to produce a stable gel network without excess shrinkage and also retain the aerogel structure after the solvent extraction and freeze-drying process [9] . The as-prepared aerogel was then applied for recognition of a sequence-specific deoxynucleotide acid (DNA) target and compared the results with those from traditional planar slides.",

CANX is a molecular chaperone found primarily in the endoplasmic reticulum and is essential for proper protein folding. Correct protein assembly in the membrane is supported by CANX, which retains intermediate structures in the endoplasmic reticulum prior to ternary complex formation completion [16] .

Table 1 lists their gene information and the primers participating in the PCR process. The 5 0 -end modified amino linker of the DNA-oligo probe allowed it to covalently bind either with the epoxy-modified surface of 3D aerogel or to commercial 2D glass slides (Phalanx Biotech, Hsinchu, Taiwan). Both probe and primer sequences are listed in Table 1 . The conformations of DNA-probe immobilization and probe-target hybridization are shown in Fig. 1 . All RNA, PCR primers and probes were purchased from ScinoPharm (Tainan, Taiwan). The probe immobilization buffer was prepared from SSC (sodium chloride-sodium citrate buffer, Amresco), glycerol (ICN Biomedicals) and ddH 2 O (Milli-Q synthesis A10 system).

Solid-state 29 Si MAS NMR spectroscopy is generally used to investigate the chemical environment of 29 Si atoms. According to the report of Legrand et al. [21] , the resonances of the different species of Si atoms in silica are located between \u00c080 and \u00c0110 ppm, as identified by the Q n terminology. Q 0 denotes the silicon with no SiAOASi linkage and Q n denotes the silicon with n SiAOASi linkages, where n = 1-4. Generally, the tetra substitution (Q 4 ) results in a characteristic peak between \u00c0100 and \u00c0110 ppm. Similarly Q 3 occurs between \u00c090 and \u00c0100 ppm and Q 2 occurs between \u00c080 and \u00c090 ppm. Fig. 3a shows the 29 Si solid-state NMR spectrum of the as-prepared silica aerogel.

Fig. 3b shows the 29 Si solid-state NMR spectrum for post-modification of hydroxyl to epoxy functional groups. Its T 3 characteristic peaks appeared at \u00c066 ppm and T 2 at \u00c057 ppm with a simultaneous Q 3 proportion that had dropped to 14.6%, indicating that about 22.3% of the aerogel surface was converted to the epoxy functional group.",

The extent of gas adsorption on the material is closely related to the nature of the sample and the gas. It is also dependent on the working pressure and temperature. An adsorption isotherm, which plots the amount of gas adsorption per unit weight of sample against the ratio of working pressure to the saturated vapor pressure of the gas, is usually presented as the measurement result. Fig. 4 shows the nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherm of the silica aerogel product, which exhibited a type-IV isotherm based on the classification of Brunauer et al. [22] . In this type of material, adsorption occurs in the micropores at very low pressure, followed by adsorption in the mesopores, with capillary condensation occurring at higher pressures, leading to the hysteresis loops [23] . The measurement indicated a specific surface area of 813 m 2 g \u00c01 , pore volume of 0.78 cm 3 g \u00c01 , and average pore diameter of 4.2 nm. After the epoxy modification, these levels dropped to 471 m 2 g \u00c01 , 0.48 cm 3 g \u00c01 , and 3.7 nm, respectively. The data suggest that modified silica aerogel was still a mesoporous material. Its large surface area ensured that the detection signal of the captured biological samples on the surface can be greatly intensified. Fig. 5 shows the magnified SEM image of silica aerogel. As shown in the image, the cluster surface is formed by a great many silica nanoparticles with an average size of around 100 nm.

As shown in the images of Fig. 7 , the fluorescence intensity was observed to vary with the Sp5 (60-mer) concentration of 10-0.1 lM. This can be compared with the low background generated by the aerogel at 0.01 lM of Sp5 DNA. Probe concentrations above 10 lM not only consumed excessive materials but pushed the intensity readings beyond the limit of the instrument. We thus chose 10-0.1 lM to further optimize the gene probe's concentration for immobilization. As shown in Fig. 8 , the optimization result showed that the best performance was with 10 lM ATP5Oc, so this concentration was adopted for further tests to demonstrate the functionality of molecular recognition.",

However, a heterogeneous DNAsample distribution was found on dots of the aerogel biochip (data not shown), indicating that the aerogel particles were unevenly distributed in the dots of the slide. This result was believed due to the slide's surface hydrophilicity caused by the pre-cleaning procedure. In order to improve it, another recognition test was carried out with the acetone-cleaned slide and the result is shown in Fig. 9 . The dots afterward became smaller, i.e., the aerogel particles had larger contact angle with the slide, and the majority part of each dots showed more homogeneous color, indicating that a better quality of the chip was achieved. In addition, the positive control dots on the bottom left of the aerogel slides was much brighter than that of the planar slides, indicating that the capturing capacity of the aerogel slide was much larger than that of the planar slide. At low-medium concentrations, both types of slides showed similar signal intensity. At concentrations of 40-120 nM, the flat surface started to reach its accommodation saturation for target molecules, but the intensity of the aerogel spot was increased with the concentration, indicating that the amount of the captured DNA was increased accordingly. Especially, at 360 nM, the aerogel spots even more obviously appeared higher capturing ability than the planar spots.",

Here, 1 ll of 20 nM DNA target was first added onto all top-four-row aerogel dots and then the slide was washed to remove the unbounded sample. The same procedure, including the target addition and the slide cleaning, was then applied to the top-three-row, top-two-row, and top-one-row dots for the second, third and fourth time, sequentially. Thus, the accumulated sample volume of each aerogel-spot row became 4, 3, 2 and 1 ll. After repeated washes, some aerogel dropped off from the slide to cause donut-shape spots, but the signal trend can still easily be seen. The 1 ll-sample row developed less signal intensity than that developed by the same samplevolume spot at Fig. 9 due to repeated washes. However, it is still clear that aerogel spots loaded with more sample volume significantly gained in signal intensity. The 4 ll sample row obviously had signal intensity higher than the 20 nM sample in Fig. 9 . It can thus be concluded that the aerogel functions as a sample reservoir collecting more samples to intensify detection signal. We had also run the identical experiment on a planar slide for a side-by-side comparison. The signal was again intensified with more DNA target added on the planar slide. Therefore a certain concentration can be detected more clearly with more DNA on both types of slides. However, as 3-4 ll of sample was applied, the aerogel slide started to exhibit orange and white colors, indicating that much more target DNA was captured and confirming much higher sample-binding capacity for the aerogel slide than the planar one.",

The test was conducted by repeating the previous experiment on four target concentrations but on a plain aerogel surface, i.e., with no probe immobilization. The low background, as shown in Fig. 11 , indicates that the signals observed previously indeed came from the probe-target recognition. Fig. 12 shows the repeated test on a longer gene. In this test, human gene CANX (1027b) served as the DNA target and the applied conditions were identical to the previous shorter gene. As shown in the images, the longer DNA did not have a good penetration capability into the porous aerogel and thus generated a much lower intensity than flat slides since the screening effect of the aerogel had more effect on the longer gene. Fig. 13 shows the recognition test for a non-specific DNA target on the as-prepared aerogel. Human gene PSMA5 (432b) was recognized on the aerogel surfaces by 10 lM ATP5Oc probe, which was immobilized on the aerogel. PSMA5 target spread over the aerogel was 0, 40, 120, and 360 nM from the left to right slides with 8 replicate dots on each slide. Sp5-cy3 (10 lM) served as the positive (bottom left) and hybridization buffer as the negative controls (bottom right).
