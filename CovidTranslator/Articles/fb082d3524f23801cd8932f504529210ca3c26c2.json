Therefore, this study is conducted to investigate the regulation of Beclin1-PI3K/AKT axis in reinfection of S. pneumoniae after influenza A virus in mice model of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). Samples of sputum and BALF were collected from patients with SCAP for etiological detection. The expression of each gene was determined by RT-qPCR and western blot analysis. Influenza A/PR/8/34 and S. pneumoniae were used to establish the mice model of reinfection pneumonia. The virus quantity, expression levels of inflammatory factors, bacterial load, and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity were tested. HE staining was applied to observe histopathology of lung tissue. The expression of Beclin1 was downregulated and the PI3K/AKT pathway was activated in viral pneumonia. In vivo experiment, the reinfection of S. pneumoniae following influenza A virus infection increased the number of S. pneumoniae population, the activity of MPO, and the expression of TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, and IFN-\u03b3 in BALF of mice. In contrast, inhibition of the PI3K/AKT pathway or overexpression of Beclin1 reduced the number of S. pneumoniae population, the activity of MPO, and the expression of TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, and IFN-\u03b3 in BALF of mice reinfected with S. pneumoniae after influenza A virus infection. Collectively, our study demonstrates that inhibition of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway or overexpressed Beclin1 alleviates reinfection of S. pneumoniae after influenza A virus infection in SCAP.",

            "text": "Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a serious infectious disease accompanied with high morbidity and mortality, and has a mortality of 30-50% [1, 2] . It is defined as a common infection which is potentially life threatening, particularly in older adults along with those with comorbid disease [3] . Severe CAP (SCAP) has generally been defined as CAP requiring admission to the intensive care unit due to invasive mechanical ventilation or septic shock requiring vasopressors [4] [5] [6] . It is related to severe mortality and approximately 16-36% patients with SCAP may die in a short time [7] . It is reported that about one-third of patients with CAP requiring hospitalization present with co-infection of both bacteria and virus, and most of them are Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae) and influenza [8] . The main bacterial causes of CAP are well described, with S. pneumoniae acting as the most significant pathogen in all age groups [9] . Viruses, such as influenza A and B viruses, parainfluenza viruses as well as adenoviruses, are also considered as important causes of CAP [10] . Currently, proper antibiotics, simple analgesics accompanied with adequate rest are the major medication against pneumonia [11] . And the macrolide antibiotics have been demonstrated to be widely applied to treat CAP (including pneumococcal pneumonia) due to their excellent inhibition against S. pneumoniae and atypical organisms [12] . Nevertheless, the prevalence of influenza A (H1N1) virus-associated pneumonia and the role of bacterial co-infection in the prognosis of patients are poorly described in the general population [13] .",

            "text": "Flexible bronchoscopy combined with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) is a viable alternative for sputum acquisition if noninvasive samples are unobtainable from the lower respiratory tract [14] . Pathogens detected in BAL can be verified by easy molecule biological methods, which can be used to improve the sensitivity and accuracy of diagnostic studies in patients with CAP who are nonresponsive to empiric antibiotic therapy [15] . However, the molecular mechanism of pathology by these pathogens remains unclear. Pneumonia is per se an inflammatory condition caused by multiple factors. It has been reported that pneumonia is strongly associated with inflammation caused by autophagy and apoptosis [16] . Beclin1, a mammalian homolog of the yeast Atg6/Vacuolar protein sorting 30 (Vps30) protein, is suggested to play a vital role in macroautophagy and vacuolar protein sorting [17] . Meanwhile, Beclin1 is necessary for the development of normal mammalian and it has been demonstrated to play a pivotal role in pathogenesis, including cancer [18] . The phosphorylation of Beclin1 mediated by protein kinase B (AKT) functions in oncogenesis and autophagy inhibition [19] . Meanwhile, the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT signaling pathway mediated by a pathogen contributes to coordination of actin rearrangement, thereby leading to internalization of the organism [20] . A study has suggested that the activated PI3K/AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway is implicated in lung tumorigenesis and it has been related to high-grade tumors and advanced diseases [21] . In conclusion, this study is carried out to discuss the role of Beclin1-PI3K/ AKT axis in reinfection of S. pneumoniae after influenza A virus.",

By detecting the respiratory viruses in the clinical samples of BALF, we found that 31 cases (51.67%) were positive in the sputum sample while 45 cases (75.00%) were positive in BALF sample (p < 0.05; Table 3 ). These results suggested that BALF sampling was superior to traditional sputum sampling in the detection of bacterial pathogens in pneumonia. In order to investigate whether the pathogenesis of reinfection pneumonia was related to the Beclin1-PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, we examined the expression of related genes in alveolar epithelial cells of BALF in 16 viral positive patients. The expression of Beclin1 in BALF was significantly lower than that in sputum of patients with reinfection pneumonia (p < 0.05), and the expression of Beclin1 in BALF of viral positive patients further decreased (p < 0.05; Fig. 1a ). Five cases were randomly selected from each group, and then determination of the Beclin1-PI3K/AKT pathway-related proteins (Fig. 1b, c) suggested that in contrast to the normal group, levels of p-PI3K/PI3K, p-AKT/AKT, and p-mTOR/mTOR increased while the protein expression of Beclin1 decreased in the Pne and the Flu + Pne group (all p < 0.05). Relative to the Pne group, levels of p-PI3K/PI3K, p-AKT/AKT, and p-mTOR/mTOR further increased while the expression of In order to verify whether the Beclin1-PI3K/AKT signaling pathway was involved in influenza virus/ S. pneumoniae reinfection in mice, relevant mouse model was established. The results in the detection of survival rate of mice in each group suggested that during infection, no mice died in the control group or in the Flu group. Compared with the control group and Flu group, the survival rate of mice significantly decreased in the SP group, and further decreased in the Flu + SP group (p < 0.05; Fig. 2a ). The amount of virus detected in the lungs of the mice showed that the number of H1N1 influenza viruses in the Flu and Flu + SP groups increased significantly on the 5th day compared with the 1st day (Fig. 2b) . Based on the findings in the detection of the population of S. pneumoniae, compared with the 1st day, the number of S. pneumoniae in the SP and Flu + SP groups increased significantly on the 5th day (p < 0.05). And the detective population of S. pneumoniae in the Flu + SP group was significantly higher than that in the SP group (p < 0.05; Fig. 2c ). In terms of MPO activity, the measurement results showed that the activity of MPO in the SP and Flu + SP group was significantly higher than that in the control group (p < 0.05; Fig. 2d ). According to the results observed by hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining, we found that in the control group, the lung tissue of mice showed normal state. However, in the SP group, inflammatory cell infiltration, alveolar collapse, perivascular, and peribronchiole edema were found in the lung tissue of mice. What is more, the lung injury in the Flu + SP group was more serious than that in the SP group (Fig. 2e) .

Compared with the Flu and SP groups, levels of p-PI3K/PI3K, p-AKT/AKT, and p-mTOR/mTOR in the Flu + SP group further increased, and the expression of Beclin1 protein further decreased (all p < 0. 05; Fig. 3a, b) . The expression of Beclin1 in lung tissue of each group of mice was examined by immunohistochemistry, and the results were consistent with those of western blot analysis (Fig. 3c, d) . These results suggest that the Beclin1-PI3K/AKT signaling pathway is involved in the process of influenza A virus infection. The expression of inflammatory factors in BALF of each group was detected. The findings revealed that in contrast to the control group, the expression of TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, and IFN\u03b3 in the SP and Flu + SP group significantly increased (all p < 0.05). Meanwhile, the expression of the above inflammatory factors in the Flu + SP group was significantly higher than those in the SP group (all p < 0.05; Fig. 3e-g) . Altogether, it is suggested that PI3K/AKT signaling pathway is activated and cell inflammation is aggravated in reinfection of S. pneumoniae after influenza virus infection in a mouse model. ",

The results of RT-qPCR showed that the expression of Beclin1 in lung tissue of mice in the oe-Beclin1 group was significantly higher than that in the oe-NC group (p < 0.05; Fig. 4a ), suggesting that lentivirus infection was effective. Based on the results of western blot analysis, it showed that the levels of p-AKT/AKT and p-mTOR/mTOR in the PI3K inhibitor + SP and PI3K inhibitor + Flu + SP group were significantly lower than those in the DMSO + SP or DMSO + Flu + SP group, while the expression of Beclin1 significantly increased (all p < 0.05; Fig. 4b, c) . Besides, the S. pneumoniae bacteria in lung tissue of mice in each group at 48 h after infection was detected, and the corresponding results suggested that compared with the DMSO + Flu + SP group, the bacterial count in the PI3K inhibitor + Flu + SP group was significantly lower than that in the DMSO + Flu + SP group (p < 0.05). Relative to the oe-NC + Flu + SP group, the number of bacteria in lung tissue of mice in the oe-Beclin1 + Flu + SP group decreased significantly (p < 0.05; Fig. 4d ). Meanwhile, the activity of MPO was measured at 48 h after infection. In comparison to the DMSO + SP group or DMSO + Flu + SP group, the activity of MPO in the PI3K inhibitor + SP group or the PI3K inhibitor + Flu + SP group significantly decreased (p < 0.05). Furthermore, in contrast to the oe-NC + SP group or the oe-NC + Flu + SP group, the activity of MPO in lung tissue of mice in the oe-Beclin1 + SP group or the oe-Beclin1 + Flu + SP group decreased significantly (p < 0.05; Fig. 4e ). The pathological changes of lung tissue of mice were determined by HE staining, which showed that compared to the DMSO + SP group or the DMSO + Flu + SP group, as well as the oe-NC + SP group or the oe-NC + Flu + SP group, the degree of injury in the lung tissue of mice significantly decreased in the PI3K inhibitor + SP group or the PI3K inhibitor + Flu + SP group, as well as in the oe-Beclin1 + SP group or the oe-Beclin1 + Flu + SP group (Fig. 4f) . Considering inflammatory response, we found that the expression of TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, and IFN-\u03b3 decreased in lung tissues of mice in the PI3K inhibitor + SP group or the PI3K inhibitor + Flu + SP group relative to the DMSO + SP group or DMSO + Flu + SP group (all p < 0.05). The expression of TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, and IFN-\u03b3 also decreased in lung tissues of mice in the oe-Beclin1 + SP group or the oe-Beclin1 + Flu + SP group in comparison to the oe-NC + SP group or the oe-NC + Flu + SP group (all p < 0.05; Fig. 4g-i) . These results suggest that the inhibition of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway or overexpression of Beclin1 in a mouse model can inhibit reinfection of S. pneumoniae after influenza virus infection and thus alleviate the degree of injury.",

Due to the increasing resistance among respiratory pathogens, together with the fact that S. pneumoniae is considered as the most common etiologic agent that is identified in CAP, the strategies for antimicrobial therapy should no doubt based upon the causative pathogen, local resistance patterns as well as the risk factors for infection with resistant bacteria [3] . However, the causative agents of CAP have not been routinely determined in China, especially in some severe cases. In this present study, we aim to discuss the molecular mechanism of reinfection of bacteria plus virus, figuring out the role of Beclin1-PI3K/AKT axis in reinfection of S. pneumoniae after influenza A virus.

BAL uses sterile fluid to wash pathogens directly. BAL has been widely applicable for adults and children in the determination of the reason of ventilator-associated pneumonia, nosocomial pneumonia, severe CAP, or recalcitrant pneumonia [14] . Additionally, BALF is suggested to be easily suitable for multiple detection methods, such as microscopy, aerobic culture, PCR as well as viral culture [15] . BAL is a noninvasive method, hence safe for patients. A previous study has suggested that BAL could be a useful tool in the identification of pathogens in ventilator-associated pneumonia, or in acute hypoxemic respiratory failure which requires noninvasive ventilation [31] . Another literature also has elucidated the utility of BAL acting as a less invasive option for the assessment of lung pathology, which could also aids in the diagnosis of Cytomegalovirus pneumonitis using molecular methods [32] . Therefore, BAL is an accurate and safe method to validate pathogens in pneumonia.",

Besides pneumonia, similar to our study, a study revealed that Beclin1 expression was markedly downregulated in cartilage tissue of osteoarthritis [33] . And it has been reported that Beclin1 is component in the PI3K complex and it is also a target of the kinase AKT [19] . Several studies have elucidated that the activation of PI3K happens in host cells during the invasive process by Streptococcus agalactiae (S. agalactiae), and the involvement of PI3K has been detected during the invasion process of S. agalactiae together with other human pathogens [34, 35] , which suggests a responsive inflammation occur. A recent study has suggested that the activation of AKT is of great importance for engulfment of P. aeruginosa, a extracellular pathogen, and the loss of bacterial motility results in a corresponding loss of stimulation and phagocytosis of AKT [36] . Taken together, the PI3K/ AKT signaling pathway collaborates with Beclin1 to regulate pneumonia progression.",

And it is demonstrated that ectopic Beclin1 expression suppressed cancer cell proliferation in vitro and tumorigenic potential in vivo, thereby implying a role for autophagy in tumor suppression [18] . As for the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, it is a signal transduction pathway that is implicated in the regulation of a great deal of cellular functions, such as cell proliferation, differentiation, adhesion, and invasion [37] . It is reported that the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway is frequently initiated through the regulation of trans-membrane receptor signaling, which is followed by activation of Src kinases to recruit and activate PI3K [38] . Kierbal et al. have observed that blockade of cellular PI3K activity is able to prevent P. aeruginosa entry into both kidney and HeLa epithelial cells [39] .
