Objectives To develop a radiological metric of injurious inflation derived from matched inspiratory and expiratory CT scans, calibrate it in a model of experimental lung injury, and test it in patients with ARDS. Methods 73 anaesthetised rats (acid aspiration model) were ventilated (protective or non-protective) for up to 4 hours to generate a spectrum of lung injury. CT was performed (inspiratory and expiratory) at baseline each hour, paired inspiratory and expiratory images were superimposed and voxels tracked in sequential scans. In nine patients with ARDS, paired inspiratory and expiratory CT scans from the first intensive care unit week were analysed. results In experimental studies, regions of lung with unstable inflation (ie, partial or reversible airspace filling reflecting local strain) were the areas in which subsequent progression of injury was greatest in terms of progressive infiltrates (R=0.77) and impaired compliance (R=0.67, p<0.01). In patients with ARDS, a threshold fraction of tissue with unstable inflation was apparent: >28% in all patients who died and \u226428% in all who survived, whereas segregation of survivors versus nonsurvivors was not possible based on oxygenation or lung mechanics. conclusions A single set of superimposed inspiratoryexpiratory CT scans may predict progression of lung injury and outcome in ARDS; if these preliminary results are validated, this could facilitate clinical trial recruitment and individualised care.",

A major advance came with the characterisation by CT, of the ventral 'baby lung', 4 which provided the rationale for use of low tidal volume 1 and prone positioning. 5 Quantitative study of ARDS using CT has been mostly limited to large regions of lung, 6 with limited analysis of inflation at very high resolution. 7 An alternative approach to pulmonary CT analysis pairs individual voxels in end-inspiratory (EI, table 1) and end-expiratory (EE) images, 8 and images are warped in order to superimpose anatomical structures that may be distorted by respiration or disease progression. 9 10 This approach permits detection of hyperinflation (low EI density) and air trapping (low EE density) in emphysematous lungs that is not otherwise detectable. 11 We previously reported that the spatial propagation of experimental lung injury was driven by tidal inflation, 12 and therefore hypothesised that in early acute lung injury, areas of lung with unstable inflation (detected by superimposed EI and EE CT scans) are 'at risk' for injury progression.",

To increase variability of injury progression, animals received ranges of HCl doses (1-4 mL/kg), and were ventilated with one of several options (not randomised) of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP, 3-10 cmH 2 O) and tidal volume (V T , 6-12 mL/kg).

In experimental injury, we used repeat CT to identify the imaging characteristics that mirror the trajectory of lung injury; this was enabled by image alignment, 9 15 which allowed tracking of individual voxels as sequential, superimposed EI-EE images over time. We thereby co-localised baseline unstable inflation with subsequent injury progression. This approach to scanning differs from a recently introduced method correlating ARDS survival with inflation heterogeneity in static CT images, but without EI-EE analysis. 7 Others have found correlations between CT imaging and ARDS outcomes, measuring the quota of tissue with recruitable atelectasis, 6 percent diseased lung 20 and evidence suggesting early fibroproliferative changes. 21 However, our methodology is unique in that it builds outcome prediction on the quantitative correlation between imaging and later injury progression, this allowed us to detect 'high-risk' tissue in areas of the lung with unstable inflation versus other states of aeration. Furthermore, this approach may unmask subtle inflation patterns that would not be noticed on conventional CT images (online supplementary figure 9 ).",

We modified a previous approach 12 in which moderate V T and low PEEP resulted in severe injury in about 50% of experiments, by using a spectrum of doses of HCl (aspiration) in the setting of protective or non-protective ventilation. In addition, our imaging approach in this design allowed investigation of the relationship among a spectrum of inflation abnormalities and subsequent development of injury.

            "text": "The combination of reduced gas content and of locally unstable inflation was closely associated with progression of experimental injury. This unstable inflation partially overlapsbut does not coincide-with tidal recruitment of atelectasis and elevated local strain. There are multiple mechanisms that can explain why this is closely associated with disease progression. First, voxels with unstable inflation may reflect the presence of reversible atelectasis, possibly atelectrauma. 22 Second, the high-risk regions contained voxels with intermediate gas content, mixed aeration that represents pathological alveolar inflation, 23 airspace flooding by oedema 24 and sparse microscopic atelectasis. Third, in areas where ventilated, collapsed and/or flooded airspaces coexist, CT yields an averaged greyscale 7 and cannot resolve a 'single' inflation state. Moreover, alveolar interdependence results in focal augmentation of stretch, 25 a concept supported by studies using in vivo MRI with inhaled hyperpolarised gas. 23 Finally, flooding potentiates ventilator-induced injury 26 and studies in humans 7 and animals 27 indicate that voxels with heterogeneous inflation are clustered among regions of fixed airspace filling and aerated lung. In summary, areas of unstable inflation concentrate local lung stress and potentiate topographic propagation of ventilator-induced injury. 12 Lung micromechanics can be directly assessed using techniques such as intravital microscopy, 28 optical coherence tomography 29 and real-time fluorescence microscopy. 26 However, these approaches do not permit whole-lung (or patient) assessment. While MRI provides more accurate functional information, 23 30 CT is more accessible and easier to use. Furthermore, ARDS is clinically under-recognised and undertreated 31 and further refinement of conventional criteria (ie, plain radiography and oxygenation) is not likely to provide substantial improvement. However, the detection of high-risk tissue with unstable inflation using CT might, if validated, offer additional future options in properly screened patients. 32 For example, image analysis could help identify subjects at high risk of deterioration, perhaps where unstable inflation is not reversible by ventilator adjustment. In such a setting, this information could inform treatment decisions, especially where costly or high-risk management (eg, extracorporeal therapy) 33 is being considered. In addition, the information could be used to enrich clinical trials of interventions in ARDS, perhaps ensuring that only patients with a high (but not overwhelming) probability of poor outcome are recruited. 2 34 In the future, measurement of high-risk tissue might enable determination of choices of (or responses to) specific therapies such as open lung ventilation, neuromuscular blockade 35 or prone positioning. 5 There are important limitations. The current results are preliminary, and translation is limited by interspecies anatomical differences. 36 Furthermore, the human data are retrospective with a small sample size; thus, prospective human studies will be required to better calibrate the methodology for human microanatomy and to verify the prognostic value. Because our images were static, we likely underdetected viscoelastic and recruitment behaviours that affect dynamic inflation. 37 The study design was intended to correlate baseline imaging characteristics with variable injury progression using an observational design similar to that used in our previous study. 12 Rats received different ventilator settings without randomisation, because our aim was to induce variability in injury trajectory rather than to test treatment strategies. We could not separate the effects of baseline injury severity from those of ventilator management because both PEEP and V T each affect CT images, critical care and these were not standardised during imaging. We chose this design because colocalisation with future injury requires that inflation is measured with ventilation settings identical to those being employed; future studies will address the predictive independence of high-risk inflation. The experimental model, acid aspiration, involves direct epithelial injury 38 and intratracheal injection, which could explain the centrifugal injury propagation. 12 The study is also limited by the short duration of the experiments and by the fact that injury progression was assessed through deterioration of imaging, C dyn and oxygenation, but lung inflammation was not directly measured. However, histology confirmed disseminated injury in rats with severe radiological and functional worsening, in our previous rat study following a similar injury protocol. 12 Furthermore, deterioration of lung compliance indicates the onset of ventilator-induced injury. 39 The correlation between high-risk inflation and mortality in the patients could be related to the 'pulmonary' 38 source of ARDS in seven of nine subjects (table 3) and may be different in other patterns of injury (eg, sepsis), where bacterial spreading, endothelial damage 38 or systemic inflammation may affect propagation. We selected patients who were imaged once within a week of endotracheal intubation, aiming to study early ARDS, 40 in whom ventilator settings were not standardised during or after imaging; thus, the impact on unstable inflation of a shorter (or longer) duration and the effects of ventilator management after imaging are unknown. Finally, extrapulmonary factors may explain patient mortality, although this seems unlikely given the similarity of the severity of illness scores between survivors and non-survivors (table 3) .",

If validated by others as an independent predictor in larger populations, a single set of paired EI-EE CT images in early ARDS may predict outcome and responses to mechanical ventilation, may enable enrichment of clinical trials and may facilitate personalised care.",

In the rat with more propagation (top), the distribution of paired EI and EE density values in the PRM evolved over time, with increased fraction of voxels in the high EI and EE density range (>\u2212300 HU), indicating oedema and/ or non-reversible atelectasis (severe injury).
