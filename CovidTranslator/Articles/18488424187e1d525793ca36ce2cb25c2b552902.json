            "text": "The positive sense ssRNA genome contains, in order from the 5\ue039 terminus, a large replicase gene (ORF1a/ORF1b) followed by genes encoding a p20 nucleoprotein (ORF2), a pp3 precursor polyprotein (ORF3), from which the gp116 and gp64 envelope glycoproteins are derived, and a small putative protein (ORF4) of unknown function that is not translated in abundance ( Figure 2 ). The overlap between ORF1a and ORF1b contains a slippery sequence (AAAUUUU) followed by a complex RNA pseudoknot structure causing a \ue0321 ribosomal frameshift, with an estimated efficiency of about 23%, that allows read-through translation of the pp1a polyprotein encoded by ORF1a to generate a pp1ab polyprotein encoded by ORF1a and ORF1b. The ORF1a coding sequence contains four regions containing multiple hydrophobic domains (HD1-HD4) a chymotrypsin-like cysteine (3C-like) proteinase (3CL pro or \"main\" protease, M pro ) flanked by HD3 and HD4 that is involved in autolytic processing of the pp1ab polyprotein. The 3CL pro of GAV has a tentative consensus VxHE\u2193(L,V) cleavage site specificity that distinguishes it from the corresponding M pro enzymes in vertebrate nidoviruses, and taken together with sequence differences, it appears to combine the Cys-His catalytic dyad of the coronavirus M pro with a potyvirus-like substrate binding pocket. ORF1a also contains two putative papain-like proteinase domains (PLP1 and PLPx) that share remote structural similarity, but very little direct sequence identity, with the PLP domains of coronaviruses. Like the corresponding papain-like proteases (PL pro ) of toroviruses, both PLP1 and PLPx lack a Zn 2\ue031 -binding finger. In vertebrate nidoviruses, the 3CL pro and PL pro s process the pp1a/ pp1ab polyproteins into functional nonstructural proteins (nsp's) numbered from the N-terminus Pos. ssRNA as nsp1 to nsp12 in arteriviruses and nsp1 to nsp16 in coronaviruses. Whilst the 3CL pro of GAV has been shown to cleave at an immediate upstream site and at a site toward the pp1ab C-terminus, the number and composition of nsps generated from pp1ab by the 3CL pro in combination with the putative PL pro s is not yet known. ORF1b also contains multiple sequence motifs with homologues in vertebrate nidoviruses. These include a large RdRp polymerase domain with an \"SDD\" active site motif and putative multinuclear Zn-finger-like domains preceding a 5\ue039-to-3\ue039 helicase domain (Zn-HEL), as well as homologs of the 3\ue039-to-5\ue039exoribonuclease (ExoN), nidoviral endoribonuclease specific for uridylate (NendoU) and ribose-2\ue039-O-methyltransferase (O-MT) domains that exist in the C-terminal region of pp1ab replicase polyproteins of the large vertebrate nidoviruses.",

The approximately 25.2 kDa polypeptide cleaved from the pp3 N-terminus contains three predicted TM domains and N-linked glycosylation sites in its predicted ectodomain. Whilst this triple-membrane-spanning glycoprotein is similar in size to the M protein of some vertebrate nidoviruses, it is not abundantly present in infected cells and evidence of its association with virions in very low amounts is tenuous. Compared to the 249-nt ORF4 in GAV, ORF4 in other okavirus genotypes studied so far is truncated substantially due to deletions or sequence changes interrupting the reading frame. There is evidence of ORF4 being expressed at low levels in tissues of GAV-infected shrimp, but whether the ORF4 protein has a specific function remains unknown.",

            "text": "In okavirus-infected cells, two subgenome-sized (sg) mRNAs are produced, sg mRNA2 and sg mRNA3, from which ORF2 and ORF3 are translated, respectively. The genome length RNA (g RNA1) and the two sg mRNAs are 3\ue039-coterminal and each possesses a 5\ue039-7-methylguanosine cap structure and a 3\ue039-poly(A) tail (Figure 2 ). It is likely that okavirus sg mRNAs are transcribed from complementary sg(-) strand templates as is the case in other nidoviruses. In support of this, double strand (ds) RNAs equivalent in size to the genomic and two sg mRNAs have been detected in shrimp cells infected with GAV, and likely represent replicative-intermediate RNAs. Unlike the sg mRNAs of corona-and arteriviruses, however, the okavirus sg mRNAs do not possess a common leader sequence identical to the genome 5\ue039-terminal sequence. In contrast, g RNA1, sg mRNA2 and sg mRNA3 each initiate with a 5\ue039AC-dinucleotide. For the sg mRNAs, this 5\ue039-terminal AC-dinucleotide maps precisely to a central position of a sequence (GGUCAAUUACAACCUA) that is conserved in the intergenic regions (IGRs) preceding the ORF2 and ORF3 genes. Presumably, this conserved element serves a dual function, in the genome as a terminator of minus-strand RNA synthesis and in the resulting minus-strand sg RNA templates, as a transcriptional promoter for sg mRNA synthesis. Thus, okaviruses would differ from corona-and arteriviruses by not using a discontinuous transcription process to produce their mRNAs, but rather a \"continuous\" transcription strategy similar to that utilized by members of the subfamily Torovinae (see family Coronaviridae chapter). Interestingly, a putative terminator/promoter element is also present in the IGR preceding ORF4. However, in all genotypes studied so far, the putative transcription initiation site nucleotide is either a G or U rather than an A, which based on the absence of a sg mRNA initiating from this element, appears to destroy its functioning.",

Infections have also been detected recently in blue shrimp (P. stylirostris) from the Gulf of California. Infections may be chronic or acute and transmitted horizontally or vertically. The prevalence of subclinical infection in P. monodon can be high in some regions, with pathology limited to the lymphoid organ. In acute infections associated with disease and mortalities, virus invades most tissues of ectodermal and mesodermal origin. Only genotypes 1 (YHV) and 2 (GAV) have been associated with disease.

Functional domains in ORF1a: hydrophobic regions (HD1-HD4), 3C-like protease (3CLP), papain-like protease (PLP1) and a domain with homology to PLP1 but lacking the canonical \u03b1 \ue031 \u03b2 fold of papain-like proteases (PLPx). Functional domains in ORF1b: RNA polymerase (RdRp), cysteine-and histidine-rich zinc finger and helicase (Zn-Hel), exoribonuclease (ExoN), uridylate-specific endoribonuclease (N) and ribose-O-methyl transferase (MT). ORF2 encodes the nucleoprotein (p20). ORF3 encodes a precursor polyprotein (pp3) that undergoes post-translation processing to generate envelope glycoproteins (gp116 and gp64) and an N-terminal triple-membrane-spanning fragment of unknown function (p25). The ribosomal frameshift site (RFS) allows read-through translation of polyprotein pp1ab from ORF1a and ORF1b. Known (\u25bc) and likely (\u2207) sites of proteolytic cleavage of expressed polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab are indicated together with the two signal peptidase type 1 cleavage sites in pp3 (\u2193).",
