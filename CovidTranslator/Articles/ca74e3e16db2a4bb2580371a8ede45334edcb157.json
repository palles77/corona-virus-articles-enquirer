            "text": "In the late 19th century, tuberculosis (TB) killed 1 of every 7 people living in the United States and Europe. 1 Today, TB kills approximately 2 million people worldwide annually, and without further intervention during the period 2002 through 2020, approximately 1 billion people will be newly infected, 150 million people will become ill, and 36 million people will die of TB. 2 The annual incidence of TB has decreased substantially during the past century in the United States. The increased morbidity that occurred during the late 1980s and early 1990s has decreased, and cases reported nationally reached a record low number of 15,078 in 2002. 3 The annual number of deaths caused by TB has also decreased in recent years; between 1980 and 2000, national TB deaths decreased from 1,978 to 751. 4 While under treatment for TB, a proportion of individuals die from the disease. In India, 6% of 676 patients age 14 to 87 years old died in a directly observed therapy program. Death rates were independently associated with weight \u03fd35 kg and history of previous treatment. 5 A study in Mexico found that the risk of death from pulmonary TB was associated with delays in treatment after the onset of disease and to poor adherence by patients to the treatment regimen. 6 In Ghana, patients who died were likely to be human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive, to be older, live in a rural area, have sputum smear-negative disease, and prolonged duration of symptoms before diagnosis. 7 A United Kingdom study indicated that delay in diagnosis was the main contributing factor leading to death from TB. 8 Delayed diagnosis of active pulmonary TB among hospitalized patients (which leads to greater morbidity, mortality, and transmission of infection) in Canada was associated with atypical clinical and demographic characteristics. 9 An investigation conducted among inner city residents in a large United States city identified predictors of death to be underlying illnesses such as diabetes mellitus, renal failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and HIV infection. 10 Cases of TB can go undetected until discovered after death. Among 3,102 TB cases in San Francisco, California, 4% were identified at death. Factors associated with these cases were age \u054643 years, male sex, white race, birth in the United States, and injecting drug use. 11 Death from TB may sometimes have a rapid onset and progression. TBrelated sudden death has been related to bronchopneumonia in 64 percent (n \u03ed 30) of reported patients, of which 30% had hemoptysis (n \u03ed 14). 12 In New York State, exclusive of New York City, deaths from TB appear to be relatively rare events. In 2001, of the 415 TB cases reported, 9 were identified at death. There are a number of reasons why TB cases are \"missed\" and are identified and reported at death. Individuals may have had a concurrent condition masking TB disease; they may have been treated for TB disease or infection in the past and suffered an unidentified reactivation; or they may have encountered economic or sociocultural barriers to accessing health care.",

The local rescue unit and the state police were summoned. The officer started cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), and the others cordoned off the area. The patient was transported by ambulance to the hospital, and the officers secured the area as a crime scene until notified by the hospital, 3 hours later, that the man had died from natural causes.

Many of those people were from high-prevalence countries in Central and South America. 14 The second complicating factor is that the index patient had advanced TB. Given the advanced stage of disease and his history of frequent coughing, the patient may have been capable of transmitting infection for quite some time. Therefore, although some of the first-round TST-positive individuals may have been infected before coming into contact with the patient, others may have been infected by the patient months earlier and had already converted their skin test at the time of first-round testing.",

Tuberculosis has not gone away. Some people still die of TB and completely bypass detection until a postmortem examination. Other TB patients are identified but still die from the disease alone or in conjunction with comorbid conditions. As national attention is drawn to anthrax, smallpox, and severe acute respiratory syndrome, TB cannot be ignored because it is still an important personal and public concern. The epidemiology of TB may have changed with shifting immigration patterns and the impact of HIV-related diseases. However, older, nonminority individuals are still dying from TB, and although fatalities may be comparatively rare events, TB should be considered in a differential diagnosis of patients with the characteristics previously described.",
