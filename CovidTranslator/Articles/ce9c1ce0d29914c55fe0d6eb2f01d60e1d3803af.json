Leukocytoclasia is a histologic term referring to pyknosis and karyorrhexis of nuclei. This can be visualized histologically as fragmented nuclear debris around blood vessels, often referred to as \"nuclear dust.\" Leukocytoclasia may range from subtle to severe and can sometimes be the only evidence of a vascular insult 5 ; however, a diagnosis of leukocytoclastic vasculitis requires several other criteria to be satisfied: Intramural inflammation (visualized as inflammatory cells transmigrating the vessel histologically), endothelial cell swelling, leukocytoclasia, hemorrhage, and fibrinoid necrosis of the vessel wall. 7 The dominant inflammatory infiltrate may be neutrophilic (majority of cases), eosinophilic, or lymphocytic. Leukocytoclasia is normally a feature of vasculitis affecting small or medium sized vessels. 5 Damage to dermal vessels usually leads to the development of hemorrhage and edema within the tissues. Hypoxic changes with pale collagen (\"smudging of the collagen\") along with faded hair follicles and adnexal structures may be seen as well. Epidermal lesions such as exudation, crusting, and ulceration may also develop owing to tissue ischemia. 7",

Currently, no classification system taking into account the clinical presentation of the individual patient is recognized in veterinary medicine. Based on such histologic classification, vasculitides in animals are categorized as either leukocytoclastic or non-leukocytoclastic, and then subdivided as neutrophilic, eosinophilic, or lymphocytic. 5 Correlations have also been made between histologic classifications and the different triggering factors leading to the vasculitic event; however, one should keep in mind that histologic lesions may evolve and change over time. 7 This has been thoroughly documented in human patients, where serial evaluations of human leukocytoclastic cutaneous vasculitis has shown that the granulocytic infiltrate gives way to a predominantly mononuclear population within 48 hours. 7 It is the personal opinion of the author that the current classification alone is unsatisfactory from a clinical standpoint, because it does not help to predict the outcome of the disease for the individual patient.",

Independent of body site, it is not uncommon that lesions are distributed in a linear fashion, reflecting the vascular anatomy of the patient. This may be a striking feature, especially when the tail or extremities are affected, that should alert the clinician to a possible ongoing vasculitic event. 8 The clinician needs to keep in mind that the cutaneous lesions resulting from an ischemic event in the skin may evolve over time. Patients presenting early may develop ulcers only several days later, and pitting edema along with constitutional clinical signs, which may be the only finding in the early stage of the disease. See Palpation of the skin is imperative to detect pitting edema, unusual firmness of the skin, or temperature changes that may occur as a result of a deficient blood supply.

In the same group, a majority of patients suffering from vasculitis also displayed signs of generalized or diffuse pain. This is particularly common during the initial phase of the disease; however, degree of pain may be highly individual. Pain may be related to the skin as a single organ system and in certain cases may be so severe that it becomes difficult to evaluate whether or not other organs are involved, for example, involvement of the ventral abdomen may cause the animal to walk with a stiff gait or avoid lying down. It may also be challenging to palpate the abdomen or perform a routine abdominal ultrasound, even under sedation, when the skin of the abdomen is severely affected 5 . This 5-year-old Shi Tzu originally presented as an emergency owing to ocular vasculitis and hyphema a day after visiting the groomer. On recheck with the ophthalmologist 3 weeks later, the dog developed these confluent purpuric lesions that rapidly expanded while being examined by the ophthalmologist. A thorough drug history revealed that the owner would give the dog acepromazine before car rides. Acepromazin was thus the likely trigger in this dog, because it had been administered both before the visit to the groomer and before seeing the ophthalmologist for a recheck. and painful. Dogs with a thick hair coat may only show signs of severe pain when touched or handled and the lesions may not become evident to the owners or clinician until the skin itself is more thoroughly examined.

These findings correspond with what is seen in human cases of leukocytoclastic cutaneous vasculitis. 8 In contrast with ischemic dermatopathies (also known as cell-poor vasculopathy or cell-poor vasculitis), patients presenting with true cutaneous vasculitis are usually sick dogs that require a thorough workup and careful monitoring. Early recognition of clinical symptoms and a tentative working diagnosis of cutaneous vasculitis allows for a better prognosis for the patient, so that appropriate actions can be taken in the early stage of the disease process.",

When faced with acutely ill patients, additional diagnostic tools can therefore be of value in an emergency setting. The author finds fine-needle aspiration biopsies from edematous areas to be a helpful in such situations. Aspiration of edematous skin lesions and subsequent staining with a Romanowsky type stain such as Diff Quick or Hemacolor can provide an impression of the nature of the cutaneous infiltrate. More important, bacterial organisms may be visualized on such smears. D-Dimer, if available, may also be of value in this early stage of decision making, because this test predicts thrombus formation in dogs with cutaneous vasculitis. [9] [10] [11] This test, however, will not differentiate between infectious and non-infectious processes so a positive D-dimer only reflects thrombus formation and does not replace histopathology as a means of diagnosing vasculitis.",

This may stem from the fact that proving a relationship between a drug and a specific adverse drug reaction can be challenging. Patients commonly receive multiple drugs simultaneously and when a reaction to a drug produces a severe life-threatening reaction, rechallenge runs the risk of being fatal and is therefore not advisable. Specific diagnostic tests aimed at documenting immunologically based reactions to specific medications are not commercially available for dogs and cats at the moment. This \"lack of solid proof\" may well be one of the reasons for the sparse amount of literature being published on the subject of cutaneous vasculitis and one can probably make the assumption that these diseases are underreported.

In a report from 1996, Legendre and coworkers reported that 7.5% of dogs receiving a 10 mg/kg dose of itraconazole developed vasculitis, whereas dogs receiving lower doses (5 mg/kg) did not develop lesions. 13 Recently, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs have been associated with vasculitis in dogs. Meloxicam was suspected as a trigger of vasculitis in a 10-year-old mixed breed dog from Portugal treated with the drug awaiting surgical repair of a cranial cruciate ligament injury. 14 An association between meloxicam exposure and cutaneous vasculitis was seen in 3 of 36 dogs in an unpublished retrospective review of canine cutaneous vasculitis (Marie Inner\u00e5 , unpublished data, 2011); however, a true connection between the drug and the clinical disease was difficult to assess in 2 out of 3 cases because 1 patient had a history of recent exposure to both meloxicam and deracoxib, and another dog received allergen-specific immunotherapy for atopic dermatitis as well as cephalexin at the time of the vasculitic event. A true connection between nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and cutaneous vasculitis may thus be difficult to assess, owing to the common practice of co-administering of additional medications. However, in the same retrospective study, a 5-year-old Shih Tzu developed cutaneous eosinophilic vasculitis 3 days post administration of beef-flavored chewable firocoxib tablets.

            "text": "Bacterial pyoderma was reported to be associated with canine vasculitis in 1978 and a hypersensitivity reaction to bacterial antigens was proposed as the most likely triggering event. 24 In people, nasal carriage of Staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant S aureus) has a known affinity for vascular endothelium, and Staphylococcus aureus carriage is capable of modulating the expression of WG, a type of human neutrophilic vasculitis. Patients suffering from WG are also more likely to carry S aureus (nasal colonization) than normal healthy individuals. Although the majority of patients suffering from WG are nasal carriers of S aureus, the corresponding prevalence for the general population is approximately 25%. 25 The exact pathomechanisms leading to an increased carriage of S aureus in human patients suffering from this type of vasculitis and the role of S aureus as a cause of exacerbations and flares of WG is unknown. However, several hypotheses have been proposed, including molecular mimicry, binding of cationic staphylococcal enzymes to glomerular endothelial cells, and a direct activation or priming of neutrophils. Patients carrying strains of Staphylococcus that produce superantigens, such as toxic shock syndrome superantigen-1 carry a particular strong risk for relapse of their vasculitic disease. 18, 25 Whether or not staphylococcal organisms are of importance in immune-mediated diseases in dogs and cats is not known; however, Staphylococcus pseudintermedius, the dominant staphylococcal organism of dogs and cats, has the capacity of producing exotoxins with superantigenic properties. 26 Inner\u00e5 Gram-negative toxin-producing bacteria has been linked with a specific form of systemic vasculitis mainly occurring in racing Greyhounds fed a diet consisting of undercooked beef. In idiopathic cutaneous and renal glomerular vasculopathy in racing Greyhounds (also known as green track disease and Alabama rot), an association has been made between verotoxin-producing strains of Escherichia coli O157:H7 and idiopathic cutaneous and renal glomerular vasculopathy in racing Greyhounds. 1 A purely infectious nature of this syndrome could, however, not be confirmed because oral and intravenous inoculation of adult greyhounds with high doses of idiopathic cutaneous and renal glomerular vasculopathy in racing Greyhounds-producing strains of E coli alone failed to produce the disease. 27 Unidentified genetic factors may also be involved, but this acute and potentially lethal syndrome has also been recognized in other breeds such as Great Danes. 28 The true etiology of this disease thus remains unproved.",

            "text": "Affected dogs present with cutaneous lesions consisting of multifocal erythematous cutaneous swellings that may drain a serosanguinous fluid, and affected animals are usually lethargic and febrile. Lesions evolve into sharply demarcated ulcers, and pitting edema of the distal limbs may be present in some dogs. The ventral abdomen and extremities are most commonly affected, sparing the head and dorsum. Gastrointestinal symptoms and signs of acute renal failure may also be present. Some cases present with strictly cutaneous involvement. 1, 8 Fibrinoid necrosis of small dermal arterioles along with full thickness necrosis of the epidermis is the typical dermatohistopathologic finding and renal biopsy specimens usually reveal glomerular lesions with thrombotic microangiopathy and necrosis. Glomerular changes resemble the childhood form of hemorrhagic uremic syndrome in humans; however, children do not develop cutaneous clinical signs. 29 Bartonella infections may lead to a condition called bacillary angiomatosis in dogs and people. This is a disease in which the vessels are directly invaded by the bacteria, producing lesions that may resemble vasculitis (pseudovasculitis). Bacillary angiomatosis was recently described in an immunosuppressed dog, and may in fact be an underdiagnosed disease because it requires special staining to detect the organisms in tissue sections 30 Tick-transmitted pathogens Associations between different tick-borne diseases and cutaneous vasculitides has long been proposed, but solid evidence of a true correlation between the 2 may be difficult to prove scientifically. There are several reasons for this. First, there may be a failure to recognize the importance of ticks as disease agents themselves. 31 Also, a substantial number of animals may be seropositive for specific tick-borne pathogens in endemic areas, making a true correlation between vasculitic diseases and tick-transmitted pathogens difficult to prove. 32 Classical symptoms of the different tick-borne illnesses are usually easily recognized in endemic areas. However, animals with an incomplete protective immune response commonly develop persistent subclinical infection, which can recrudesce with stress or concurrent disease. 33 In these cases, low numbers of organisms and cryptic infections make diagnosis difficult using standard methods. Continued antigenemia can lead to the induction of polysystemic, immune-mediated disease such as cyclic anemia, thrombocytopenia, polyarthropathy, uveitis, and vasculitis. Infected animals commonly have high serum globulin levels with monoclonal or polyclonal gammopathies and immune complex formation. 34 The true prevalence of tick-transmitted pathogens as triggers of canine cutaneous vasculitis is unknown. However, in a recent review of 36 cases of cutaneous necrotizing vasculitis, tick titers were performed as part of the workup for their vasculitic disease in 10 of the 36 dogs. Three of these 10 dogs showed significant elevation in tick titers. One had elevated Ehrlichia titers, 1 had a significantly elevated Anaplasma phagocytophilum titer, and 1 young dog presented with a Borrelia burgdorferi titer of 1:2560 (reference range >80 considered negative). In the latter dog, a convalescent tick titer was performed 4 weeks after initiating treatment with anti-inflammatory doses of prednisolone and standard doses of doxycycline, and a significant titer reduction was observed along with clinical resolution of cutaneous clinical signs.",

            "text": "In 2002, Malik and coworkers described 3 cases of necrotizing neutrophilic vasculitis in young Shar Pei dogs. All the affected dogs presented with constitutional signs of before the onset of, or along with the development of, cutaneous lesions. Extensive edema, especially of the face and extremities, that subsequently developed into multifocal, full-thickness skin necrosis and deep cutaneous ulcerations was seen dermatologically. Two dogs responded to treatment with steroids and various antibiotics, whereas 1 dog showed a better response to enrofloxacin than a combination of immunosuppressive treatment, clavulanate-potentiated amoxicillin, and cephalexin along with injectable dexamethasone. A pedigree analysis was not possible to perform in these cases and a genetic etiology could not be confirmed. Two of these 3 dogs had been vaccinated with a live virus vaccine 3 weeks before the onset of illness, and 2 dog dogs had also been exposed to antibacterial treatment with a combination of amoxicillin and clavulanic acid. Whether this disease represents a genodermatosis in the Chinese Shar Pei is currently unknown. Additional cases have not been reported so far. 40 Proliferative arteritis of the nasal philtrum A highly distinctive arteritis affecting only the nasal philtrum was originally described in 4 St Bernards and a Giant Schnauzer. 41 Subsequently, the disease has also been described in a Newfoundland and a Basset Hound. A genetic predisposition seems to exist in the St Bernard. 5, 42 The typical appearance is of a solitary, well-circumscribed, round, or sometimes V-shaped ulcer that is neither painful nor pruritic. Episodes of arterial bleeding may occur in affected dogs, a situation that often warrants emergency interventions. 5, 42 The visual appearance of this distinct disease of the St. Bernard is striking, but diagnosis should still be confirmed histologically to differentiate it from other disease processes that may affect the nasal cartilage.",

Immunohistochemical studies have shown that spindle cells proliferating within this thickened area of vascular intima are positive for smooth muscle actin and vimentin and negative for factor VIII-related antigen, suggesting either myofibroblast or smooth muscle-like differentiation of the proliferating cells. Superficial changes have included neutrophilic dermal inflammation and lymphoplasmacytic dermatitis. 7 Long-term treatment with immunosuppressive therapies have been used, including prednisolone, topical fluocinolone in dimethyl sulphoxide, a combination of tetracycline and niacinamide, and fish oil. 42 In the author's experience, topical tacrolimus ointment applied 2 or 3 times a day for extended period has been effective as well.

Keep in mind that the inciting agent can also be the vehicle of a drug and not only the drug itself (eg, capsules containing gelatin may be the triggering factor of hypersensitivity vasculitis in a beef-allergic dog). In patients suffering from vasculitis triggered by an adverse reaction to drugs, removal of the drug along with close patient monitoring may in fact be the only treatment necessary. This may also be true for patients presenting with severe and extensive ulcerations of the skin. As an example, a patient presenting with severe ulcerations affecting 20% of the total body surface with a particular drug as the only triggering factor may not benefit from glucocorticoid treatment unless the disease is progressing, because this may only serve to delay wound healing and increase the risk of wound infection and sepsis. Such patients may benefit more from drug withdrawal and proper wound care along with future avoidance of the offending drug.",

Starting at lower doses makes sense because prednisolone doses can easily be increased if necessary, higher doses are associated with severe side effects and poor wound healing, and significant immunosuppression may predispose animals with severe and extensive cutaneous ulcerations to secondary (wound) infections and sepsis. Furthermore, in the early phase of the disease, several diagnostic tests may still be pending, including tests for infectious conditions (blood cultures, tick titers, and tissue cultures). Administering high doses of steroids during this phase of disease could therefore have detrimental effects and negatively affect treatment outcome if it is later discovered that the animal was suffering from an infectious condition.",

Thiopurine antimetabolites compete with endogenous purines for incorporation into RNA and DNA, resulting in nonsense sequences. DNA and RNA syntheses are thus inhibited, and mitosis and cellular metabolism disrupted. 49 Azathioprine is a potent cytotoxic agent that may be considered as a steroidsparing agent in cases refractory to empiric anti-inflammatory therapy to reduce side effects associated with persistent high-dose corticosteroid therapy. Some dogs may experience life-threatening myelosupression, consisting of profound neutropenias, lymphopenias, and thrombocytopenias, as a result of standard azathioprine dosing. 50 Weekly or biweekly complete blood counts should be performed in all patients treated with azathioprine. Other uncommon adverse effects include hepatotoxicity, pancreatitis and gastrointestinal distress. 47 Myelosupression occurs more frequently in the cat preventing the widespread use of this drug in feline patients. 49 The clinician needs to keep in mind that there may be a considerable lag time before full effect of this drug is reached; 1 to 6 weeks have been reported. 1, 51 Once the patient is clinically stable, tapering to the lowest necessary dose should be attempted to minimize side effects. 1 The author prefers to start with a dose of 1 to 2 mg/kg, and uses the lower range of the dose in schnauzers or related breeds. 52 The dose is then tapered down slowly (every 14-21 days) to a dose of 1 or 0.5 mg/kg before tapering down further to every 48 hours and if possible every 72 hours.",

Some clinicians, including the author, find it to be a valuable drug when dealing with ischemic dermatopathies (see article by Morris elsewhere in this issue), but it is rarely effective as a single agent for the treatment of neutrophilic vasculitis. 53 The onset of action is slow, and several weeks to months may be required before clinical response is seen. 1, 54 Pentoxiphylline is, however, a safe drug, is associated with few side effects in dogs, and should not be discarded as a steroid-sparing agent in patients that require long-term management of their disease. Gastrointestinal irritation, although rare, has been reported as a side effect.",

Sulfasalazine is usually preferred over dapsone, because the latter has been associated with more severe hepatotoxicities 3, 7 Side effects associated with sulfa drugs are well-documented in dogs and includes anemia, leukopenia, keratoconjunctivitis sicca, and hepatotoxicity. Blood dyscrasias, cutaneous eruptions, nephrotoxicity, and neuropathies can also occur. Keratoconjunctivitis sicca has been shown to be reversible with reduction of either dosage or frequency of administration. 7 For sulfasalazine, a dose of 25 mg/kg 3 times per day has been recommended. It is advised not to exceed a total dose of 3 g per day. Dapsone is dosed at 1 mg/kg by mouth once daily.",

A number of underlying factors may be associated with vasculitides in dogs and cats, including drugs, infectious diseases, adverse reactions to food, malignancies, and immunemediated diseases. Vasculitis should thus be regarded as a reaction pattern that warrants an extensive workup of the patient to identify such triggers. Affected patients present with a variety of symptoms, such as purpura, pitting edema, and ulcerations of the skin. Constitutional signs such as fever, depression, and anorexia are common and seem to be present in the majority of patients. Once a diagnosis is confirmed by compatible histologic findings, treatment, and follow-up must be tailored to the individual patient. High doses of immunosuppressive medications are only recommended once infectious diseases capable of producing a similar constellation of clinical signs have been ruled out.",
