Multiple factors led to this level of control: wastewater disposal, personal hygiene improvements, pasteurization of milk, and advances in food preparation and storage. The availability of high-quality tap water in every household was also a crucial step. Showers, baths, and toilets reduced the level of fecal contamination in the household and allowed persons to cleanse themselves easily and frequently. Although it is still assumed that a significant proportion of gastrointestinal illnesses is waterborne and foodborne, we do not have enough data to estimate the proportion of the overall burden of disease by route of exposure. Available data pertain mostly to outbreaks (waterborne, foodborne, or contagious), but these data are only the tip of the iceberg. In a holistic approach, an action relating to one of the exposure routes should result in a measurable reduction of gastrointestinal illnesses associated with the other transmission routes. 1 This reduction of gastrointestinal illnessses is mainly the result of limiting subsequent person-to-person transmission, thereby reducing the risk of contaminating food and surfaces.",

Symptoms develop in only a few of the persons who are infected, and only a proportion of these persons will seek medical attention. The doctor may not report the illness, or if samples are taken they may fail to reveal a pathogen. If a pathogen is identified, the result may or may not be reported to a surveillance system (if such a system exists). Only a small proportion of acute episodes reach this level. Existing surveillance systems are thus likely to significantly underestimate the real burden of gastrointestinal disease. 7, 8 Few studies have investigated the incidence of gastrointestinal disease at the community level, and most of these studies have been conducted in North America. These studies include the Cleveland study, 4, 9 the Tecumseh study, 10, 11 and the Virus Watch Program. 12 Reported gastrointestinal illness rates were in the range of 0.5 to 2 episodes per year per person, varying from 5 to 100 episodes per 1000 persons per week, according to seasons and age. The number of episodes of gastrointestinal illnesses reported in these studies is similar to the number reported in some recent epidemiologic studies. A seasonal pattern of gastrointestinal illness is often observed. Adults are usually the least susceptible, and children younger than 5 years are the most susceptible. Peaks can be observed in children in autumn, whereas values as low as 5 episodes per 1000 persons per week are reported in summer.",

Enteric viruses are excreted through the feces in the environment by infected persons with or without clinical illness. The enteric viruses include more than 100 types: enteroviruses (eg, poliovirus, coxsackievirus, echovirus, and hepatitis A), reovirus, rotavirus, adenoviruses, coronavirus, calicivirus, astrovirus, coronavirus, and Norwalk-like agents. 13 Health effect studies have provided data on the prevalence of antibodies to several enteric viruses in US populations. 14 Data indicate that the hepatitis A virus is an infection acquired pro-gressively in life, and that in the United States, relatively few children have antibodies to this virus. In contrast, these infections generally are acquired early in life by people in other countries because of low hygiene levels.",

            "text": "Getting a clear understanding of the incidence of diarrhea in developing countries is even more difficult than it is in industrialized countries. Using the results of available studies to produce an overall estimate of diarrheal disease in developing countries is difficult for a number of reasons. Levels of diarrheal disease may markedly differ between relatively close communities because of different socioeconomic factors, such as the availability of a clean water supply and hygiene behavior. Estimates of diarrheal disease incidence from a variety of prospective epidemiologic studies indicate a range of 1 of 25 episodes per person per year. It seems clear that the incidence is higher in poorer communities and in rural environments than in urban environments. The age distribution of persons with diarrheal disease in developing countries seems to be similar in all regions in which this information reported. Disease incidence is relatively low in the first few months of life, and then peaks at about 24 months before declining toward adulthood. Travelers to developing countries are at risk. 15.16 Data from various countries indicate a similar incidence of 1 to 15 episodes per person per year for travelers, suggesting a high degree susceptibility and a high attack rate. This difference is even more notable given the fact that travelers usually live in more hygienic surroundings than do local persons. Thus, the evidence presented supports the hypothesis that local people build up a substantial immunity to the enteropathogens circulating in their communities. However, a consequence of achieving this level of immunity there is that young children in developing countries have a substantially higher incidence of illness than do children in developed nations. This high incidence of gastrointestinal disease in children is one of the reasons behind the high childhood mortality rates in developing countries.",

In the Philippines, Moe et al 19 reported that improved drinking water would have little or no effect in areas with poor environmental sanitation. In areas with good community sanitation, 20 reducing fecal coliform counts by 2 orders of magnitude would result in a 40% reduction in the incidence of diarrhea; eliminating excreta from around houses would result in a 30% reduction; and providing private excreta disposal would result in a 42% reduction.",
