The present study intended to establish an in vitro toll to assess the parasitological/immunological status of dogs, applicable in pre-clinical trials of vaccinology, prognosis follow-up and therapeutics analysis of canine visceral leishmaniasis. We have evaluated the performance of co-culture systems of canine Leishmania chagasi-infected macrophages with different cell ratios of total lymphocytes or purified CD4 + and CD8 + T-cells. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from uninfected dogs were used for the system set up. Employing the co-culture systems of L. chagasi-infected macrophages and purified CD4 + or CD8 + T-cell subsets we observed a microenvironment compatible with the expected status of the analyzed dogs. In this context, it was clearly demonstrated that, at this selected T-cell:target ratio, the adaptive immune response of uninfected dogs, composed by L. chagasi-unprimed T-cells was not able to perform the in vitro killing of L. chagasi-infected macrophages. Our data demonstrated that the co-culture system with T-cells from uninfected dogs at 1:5 and 1:2 ratio did not control the infection, yielding to patent in vitro parasitism (\u226580%), low NO production (\u22645 M) and IL-10 modulated (IFN-\u2425/IL-10\u22642) immunological profile in vitro. CD4 + or CD8 + T-cells at 1:5 or 1:2 ratio to L. chagasi-infected macrophages seems to be ideal for in vitro assays. This co-culture system may have great potential as a canine immunological analysis method, as well as in vaccine evaluations, prognosis follow-up and therapeutic interventions.",

A key goal in the control of CVL has been the development of vaccines with high protective capability to interrupt the cycle of parasite transmission (Reis et al., 2010) . Assessments of vaccine safety and anti-CVL efficacy generally require a long follow-up, extending into years of study (Giunchetti et al., 2007; Giunchetti et al., 2008; Roatt et al., 2012) . Thus, researchers need to develop methodological strategies that enable a more rapid and accurate evaluation of the canine immune response triggered by distinct vaccine candidates.",

Although it is well established that macrophages participate in killing parasites through mechanisms that depend on reactive oxygen and nitrogen intermediates, the mechanisms by which macrophages kill Leishmania in dogs have not been investigated as thoroughly (Rodrigues et al., 2011) . The immune response against Leishmania sp. is highly dependent on the microbicidal action of macrophages, which are actually the host cell target of this protozoan; however, macrophages are fully capable of antigen presentation and establishment of an effective response against the parasite (Pinelli et al., 1999) .",

            "text": "Thus, to develop new approaches for analyzing the immune response of naturally L. chagasi-infected dogs or dogs immunized against CVL, in vitro co-culture systems with macrophages and purified T-cells would be useful. However, there is so far no standardized methodology for this purpose, and these tests usually only involve a system with peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) without purified T-cell subsets (Pinelli et al., 1999; Holzmuller et al., 2005; Rodrigues et al., 2009) . Thus, it is necessary to develop additional methods for evaluating the immune system in veterinary medicine, especially in experimental dog models. Such tests could be included in pre-clinical trials of vaccines against CVL, so that the time needed for the experiments could be reduced. This would likely reduce the costs of experimentation using the dog model and provide a more rational way of selecting candidate vaccines against CVL as well as to evaluate therapeutic protocols. These methods would contribute to the identification of biomarkers related to interactions between the innate and adaptive immune responses of dogs. In this context, our main goal was to analyze the canine immune response using a co-culture system of canine L. chagasiinfected macrophages with different ratios of purified CD4 + and/or CD8 + T-cells. This approach, based on the canine immune response, would be useful in dealing with a number of canine diseases, in addition to evaluating various treatments and vaccines.",

This methodology seems to be useful for analyzing vaccine approaches and treatment against CVL, using peripheral blood samples, instead requiring invasive methods for parasitological/immunological measurements. In general, invasive methods, including bone marrow, spleen and lymph nodes aspirates, despite providing compartmentalized status, relevant to understand the anti-Leishmania host response, usually represent risks, require controlled procedures, qualified professional assistance and may interfere in the host response during follow-up studies. Therefore, the use of well standardized peripheral blood-based methods may allow the assessment of compatible parasitological/immunological parameters and overcome the major restrictions of those invasive procedures and also provide additional information than the already available PBMC-based methods. To establish such assay, in the present investigation we have evaluated the performance of co-culture systems to provide a range of biomarkers, including parasitological approaches to measure the L. chagasi infection status of PBMC-derived macrophages, the NO levels along with the type I and type II cytokines. These analyses were essential for identifying the ideal T-cell:M\u00d8 ratio that yield appropriated parasitological (parasitism frequency and parasite load) and immunological (Nitrite, IFN-\u2425, TNF-\u2423, IL-12, IL-4 and IL-10) pattern, compatible with the animals analyzed and avoid methodological artifact, that might lead to parasitological/immunological data inconsistent with those expected for a given dog status. Although, the proposed method is an in vitro approach that may not include all elements/events that take place in vivo. Our results showed that the proposed in vitro approach was able to yield laboratorial parameters useful to evaluate the ability of canine immune cells to control the L. chagasi infection in vitro as a biomarker for monitor their immunological status.",

The NO levels were similar between the macrophage co-cultured with CD4 + and/or CD8 + Tcells, showing NO production over the cut-off edge of 5 M only when high ratio of purified T-cells were used. The NO levels in cocultures using CD4 + or CD8 + T-cells at 1:5 and 1:2 ratios showed values below the cut-off edge, similar to the parasitological profile observed for the tested uninfected dogs. Our hypothesis is that as when a dog present a efficient anti-Leishmania response, achieve by effective vaccination, asymptomatic infection or successful treatment, a compatible parasite control mediated by enhanced NO production would be detected in the proposed co-culture method. In the context of biomarkers regarding Leishmania control, NO is considered as a crucial mediator for controlling intracellular pathogens, and its analysis was incorporated into this study. However, NO production may vary depending on cell type. For example, murine cell line J774 macrophages produce higher levels of NO than canine macrophages (Pinelli et al., 2000; Gantt et al., 2001; Holzmuller et al., 2002) . Furthermore, in a study using a strain of Darby canine macrophages, the authors did not find significant differences between the levels of NO cell line in comparison with PBMC cultures (Panaro et al., 1998) . However, the levels of phagocytosis and parasitism control were significantly higher in cultures of PBMC stimulated with concavaline A (Panaro et al., 1998) . Various studies have shown the importance of NO in the control of Leishmania infection as an effector molecule, indicating immunogenicity induction (Giunchetti et al., 2007; Ara\u00fajo et al., 2009; Reis et al., 2010) and reduction in the parasitic index in L. infantuminfected macrophages, and thus contributing to the establishment of an immunoprotection profile in vaccinated dogs (Holzmuller et al., 2005; Lemesre et al., 2007) .",

            "text": "Aiming to incorporate additional biomarkers regarding resistance or susceptibility to Leishmania infection, we also analyzed type I and type II cytokines in the supernatant of the co-culture systems. We demonstrated that the levels of TNF-\u2423, IL-12 and IFN-\u2425 and were significantly higher in the all co-culture systems of total lymphocytes and also T-cells with L. chagasi-infected macrophages. These results are similar to those obtained in other studies using cell cultures with whole lymphocytes (Holzmuller et al., 2005; Lemesre et al., 2007) . Furthermore, it was reported that L. infantum-infected macrophages co-cultured with whole lymphocytes from dogs immunized with the LiESAp vaccine showed increased levels of IFN-\u2425 in addition to reduction in the in vitro parasite load (Holzmuller et al., 2005; Lemesre et al., 2007) . Vaccination of dogs also induces an increased percentage of T lymphocytes producing IFN-\u2425, especially CD4 + T-cells (Ara\u00fajo et al., 2009; Ara\u00fajo et al., 2011) . Likewise, the levels of IFN-\u2425 measured in our study were higher (\u223c1000 pg/mL) in co-cultures using purified CD4 + Tcells than in those using CD8 + T-cells (\u223c400 pg/mL). Moreover, co-cultures using PBMC and L. chagasi-infected macrophages from healthy dogs demonstrated a positive correlation between mRNA levels of IFN-\u2425/IL-4 and parasite load (Rodrigues et al., 2009) . For all the co-culture ratios in this study, IL-4 and IL-10 levels were similar to those of the control group. However, there were significant reductions in IL-10 between the 1:1 and 1:2 co-cultures with CD4 + T-cells and the 1:5 and 1:2 co-cultures with CD8 + T-cells. Importantly, with the exception of the first studies (Pinelli et al., 1994; Pinelli et al., 1995; Pinelli et al., 1999) in which the co-cultures were performed with purified T-cells, the other studies in the literature (Holzmuller et al., 2005; Lemesre et al., 2007; Rodrigues et al., 2007; Rodrigues et al., 2009) were performed using whole lymphocytes. However, because the proposed co-culture system may be applied in detailed analysis of the canine immune response, it would be useful and highly relevant to employ purified T-cell subsets in this in vitro system.",

It is important to mention that as L. chagasi and L. infantum have been considered synonymies, the proposed methodology should also be applicable to other regions where L. infantum is cited as etiological agent and not only in South America where most studies refer to L. chagasi as the species causing visceral leishmaniasis.",

The proposed in vitro approach is able to yield laboratorial parameters useful to evaluate the ability of canine immune cells to control the L. chagasi infection in vitro as a biomarker for monitor their immunological status. The methodology employing co-culture of L. chagasi-infected macrophages and purified CD4 + or CD8 + T-cell subsets induced a microenvironment compatible with the expected status of the analyzed dogs. In this context, co-culture system with T-cells from uninfected dogs at 1:5 and 1:2 ratio did not control the infection, yielding to patent in vitro parasitism (\u226580%), low NO production (\u22645 M) and IL-10 modulated (IFN-\u2425/IL-10\u22642) immunological profile in vitro. CD4 + or CD8 + T-cells at 1:5 or 1:2 ratios to L. chagasi-infected macrophages seems to be ideal for in vitro assays, as this ratio was able to induce in vitro biomarkers profile related to the expected status of the dogs analyzed. This co-culture system seems to have great potential as a method to be incorporated in canine immunological analysis, applied to vaccine evaluations, prognosis follow-up and therapeutic schemes.",
