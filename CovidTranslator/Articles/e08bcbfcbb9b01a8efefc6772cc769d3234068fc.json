We used polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to study 9 virus groups, including 16 different viruses or viral strains, in 56 ambulatory children with radiologically confirmed community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). The same tests were carried out on 474 apparently healthy control children of the same age and sex. The mean age of children with CAP was 6.5 years (SD 4.2). Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was found in 19.6 % of 56 cases and in 2.1 % of 474 controls. Adenoviruses were present in 12.5 % of cases (0.2 % controls) and metapneumovirus and influenza A virus each in 10.7 % of cases (0.2 % controls). Interestingly, rhinoviruses were less common in cases (10.7 %) than in controls (22.4 %): odds ratio 0.36 (95%CI) 0.15-0.87) in conditional logistic regression including 56 cases and 280 controls matched for age, sex and sampling month. The prevalence of parainfluenza viruses, enteroviruses, coronaviruses and human bocavirus were similar in both groups.",

Most LRTIs caused by RSV occur in young children under 2 years of age and viral co-infections are common [2] [3] [4] 6] . The use of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect respiratory viruses has revealed the role of rhinoviruses in children's LRTIs [21, 22] and has even helped to discover metapneumovirus [27] and human bocavirus [25] , and rare types of coronaviruses [23, 33] . In some studies, rhinoviruses have been the second most common viruses after RSV in CAP and other LRTIs in children [3, 9] and there is increasing experimental and clinical evidence that rhinoviruses are capable of penetrating lower airways and causing invasive infections [5, 8] . Human bocavirus has been the third most common finding in children with LRTIs [3, 4] and there is preliminary evidence, based on antibody responses and results of quantitative PCR, that this virus is a real disease-causing agent [3, 9] . However, the final role of human bocavirus in pediatric respiratory infections has so far remained unresolved.",

During these study periods, 3842 children aged one to 18 years visited the outpatient clinic due to respiratory symptoms during office hours and chest radiograph was obtained in 146 cases when pneumonia was suspected. All the patients were examined by one of the authors (SK) and 102 of the children were considered to have community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) based on the clinical and radiological findings. We excluded 12 patients with bronchial obstruction on admission, 12 who had received antibiotic treatment some days before admission and 8 with severe pneumonia requiring hospitalization. Three experienced radiologists independently re-examined the chest radiographs of the remaining 70 patients, and all of them agreed with the diagnosis of radiological pneumonia in 56 cases. These 56 children aged one to 18 years with radiologically confirmed CAP who were treated at home made up the patient group.",

Oropharyngeal samples were taken from the children's posterior throat using a viscose swab (300202, Deltalab, Spain), two or more hours after eating. Nasopharyngeal samples were taken through the inferior nasal meatus using a sterile flexible nasopharyngeal swab with a plastic applicator (503CS01, COPAN, Italy). Nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs from each child were combined in a single sterile tube with 0.5 ml of normal saline solution and stored at minus 70\u00b0C until they were examined. Before we took the pharyngeal aspirate, the patients were asked to take a few consecutive deep breaths, hold their breath for a few seconds, and then forcibly exhale. A sterile catheter (Muco-Safe w. filter, Unomedica-A ConvaTec, Birkerod Co, Denmark) was then placed into the pharynx via the mouth, which caused a cough reflex, and then the airway secretions, which mainly consisted of mucus from the trachea due to coughing, were aspirated through the catheter using a suction device (Blue Cross A-750, Blue Cross Emergency Co., Ltd., Japan). The volume of the pharyngeal aspirate needed to be 1-3 ml and the specimens were stored at \u221270\u00b0C until examined. Real-time reverse-transcription PCR (RT-PCR) was used to detect viruses with the Rotor-Gene 6000 Instrument (Corbett Research, Sydney, Australia), according to the manufacturer's instructions. A series of kits from the Central Research Institute for Epidemiology, Moscow, Russia, were used: the AmpliSens \u00ae Influenza virus A/B-FRT PCR kit for influenza virus A and B RNA, the AmpliSens Enterovirus-FRT PCR kit for enterovirus RNA and the AmpliSens \u00ae ARVI-screen-FRT PCR kit for multiplex detection of res p i r a t o r y s y n c y t i a l v i r u s ( R S V ) R N A , h u m a n metapneumovirus RNA, parainfluenzavirus type 1-4 RNA, coronavirus \u041e\u042143, \u0415229, NL63 and HKU1 RNA, rhinovirus RNA, adenovirus B, C and E DNA and human bocavirus DNA.",

On the other hand, sensitive PCR techniques can identify rhinoviruses in respiratory samples for several weeks after acute infection [15, 24] , as well as in non-symptomatic children who have not reported any recent or subsequent respiratory infections [14, 25] . There is evidence that rhinoviruses are able to replicate in human lower airway cells [28] and may be associated with lower respiratory tract infections [4, 8, 12] . Since there are more than 100 rhinovirus serotypes, the development of antibody assays for rhinoviruses has not been successful [15] . Thus, the final role of rhinoviruses in children's CAP has remained unresolved. Blood myxovirus resistance protein A (MxA) level is increased in children with symptomatic respiratory viral infections, including rhinovirus infections, and is a promising method to separate carriers from those with infection [30] . Our finding that rhinoviruses were more common (22.4 %) in healthy controls than in CAP patients suggests that the role of rhinoviruses has been over-estimated in previous, non- controlled, PCR-based studies, and larger, prospective, controlled studies, as well as studies applying MxA or other virusspecific host markers, are needed.",
