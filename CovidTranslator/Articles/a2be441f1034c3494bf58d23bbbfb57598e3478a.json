CD8 + T cells also form part of the memory response. They can rapidly expand in number and eliminate pathogens after secondary challenge. Also, CD8 + T cells can recognize tumor antigens presented by cancer cells and eradicate them before they metastasize (2) . The cytotoxicity of CD8 + T cells requires direct contact with target cells, although the capability of each CD8 + T cell to eliminate target cells remains uncertain (3, 4) . Regardless, these cell-to-cell contacts enable CD8 + T cells to release cytotoxic granules and death ligands, thereby killing the target cells (5) .",

            "text": "Interferon-gamma (IFN\u03b3) is one of the critical cytokines for establishing effective immune responses. In the context of T cells, this cytokine helps to drive the polarization of CD4 + T cell response to T H 1, which directs the overall T cell response toward cell-mediated immunity. In CD8 + T cells, activated subsets start to produce IFN\u03b3 rapidly, with the dominant epitope-specific CD8 + T cells expanding preferentially over subdominant ones (6, 7) . IFN\u03b3 production by activated CD8 + T cells also promotes T H 1 polarization (8) , enhances cell motility and cytotoxicity (9) , and exerts antiviral immunity in a wide variety of cells through IFN\u03b3 receptor signaling (10) . IFN\u03b3 also plays a vital role in regulating the contraction of effector CD8 + T cells after the clearance of primary infection (11, 12) . Despite its multiple functions, IFN\u03b3 produced by activated epitope-specific CD8 + T cells is widely used as an indirect marker to demonstrate the functional efficacy of epitope-specific CD8 + T cells. For example, as assays for measuring IFN\u03b3 produced by CD8 + T cells can be highly robust (e.g., Intracellular Cytokine Staining, ICS), IFN\u03b3 is often used as a surrogate marker in screening assays for identifying potential cytotoxic CD8 + T cell epitopes. However, one should note that the relationship between these two parameters is not necessarily correlated.",

Fluorescence-based methods have since supplanted the radioactive labeling methods due to their higher sensitivity and better safety profile (14) . However, these assays are typically used in a single target format, allowing measurements of cytotoxic potential of one or two CD8 + T cell attributes. This approach is not highly robust, which limits its potential use in large-scale screening studies. When there is a need to test many CD8 + T cells epitopes, the amount of starting materials (mice or human PBMCs) that are needed will inevitably increase substantially, which may pose difficulties for conducting comprehensive analyses.",

This strategy was inspired by the use of multicolor-coded MHC multimers to test different antigen-specific T-cell responses in a single sample (22) . By modifying the concentrations of each dye, up to 24 different groups of donor cells can be created (Table S1 ). When equal numbers of cells from each group were combined and transferred into recipient mice through the intravenous route, all 24 different groups of donor cells could be identified by flow cytometry (Figure 1B) . The clear demarcation of each donor group raises the possibility of directly measuring the cytotoxicity of multiple CD8 + T cell specificities simultaneously in a single mouse (see below).

Na\u00efve: no treatment; Vax A + PR8: vaccination followed by a virus challenge; PR8: virus challenge only). At day 5 post-challenge, we prepared donor splenocytes from unrelated na\u00efve mice and divided them into eight groups. Each group of donor cells were pulsed and labeled with a specific combination of peptide and dye ( Table S2 ). The treated donor cells were then transferred into these mouse groups via intravenous or intranasal routes (Figure 2C , upper and lower panel), and they were recovered from these recipient mice the following day. As shown in Figure 2C , we could identify these labeled cells and distinguish them from each other in all experimental conditions. Furthermore, donor cells pulsed with influenza epitopes NP147 (CMFDA+) and HA518 (CMTMR+) experienced high levels of cytolysis in vaccinated mice upon challenge with influenza ( Figure 2C , highlighted by * in the middle panels, and Figure 2D ), but not in unvaccinated mice. However, the CSP280 (CMTMR++) control group experienced significant cytolysis in both the spleen and bronchoalveolar lavage of the unvaccinated mice, with this effect more pronounced in latter tissue compartment (Figure 2D , left vs. right panels). This observation suggested that the inflammatory microenvironment contributed to substantial non-specific killing in these unprotected mice. The proinflammatory milieu is known to induce Fas receptor expression in different cells (23) (24) (25) , and others have shown that bystander cell lysis by activated CD8 + T cells occurs in a TNF\u03b1-or FasL-dependent manner (26) (27) (28) . Thus, we believe that the non-specific cytolysis by activated CD8 + T cells in our model could occur similarly. We also believe that the bystander killing of target cells due to dysregulated inflammation resulting from IAV infection can also extend to cells labeled with IAV epitopes. Thus, the inclusion of irrelevant epitopes in this multiplex assay provides a unique opportunity to quantitate this bystander killing effect. Consequently, we used CSP280 data points from individual mice to normalize against the rest of the corresponding data points to obtain Figure 2E . These normalized data clearly showed that CD8-mediated cytolysis against influenza epitopes are also elevated in the lung mucosa of vaccinated mice.",

This functional assay allows the direct assessment of multiple CD8 + T cell specificities simultaneously in a single mouse or human PBMC sample, leading us to the finding that not all epitopespecific CD8 + T cells that express IFN\u03b3 exhibit concomitant direct cytotoxicity. Importantly, we demonstrate that this phenomenon is not limited to three different pathogen mouse models: IAV, malaria and MERS-CoV, but it also appears on human PBMC screening against experimentally known IAV CD8 + epitopes. These observations raise concerns about T cell studies in applications such as validating epitope candidates for vaccine studies. Currently, IFN\u03b3-ICS remains widely used for such a purpose, with those eliciting IFN\u03b3 production regarded as responding positively to a pathogen insult, leading them to be selected as potential targets of vaccine design. However, this may not mean the T cells induced by this kind of epitope-based vaccines can always control the disease, as has been shown in FIGURE 4 | Discrepancy between direct and indirect measurements of CD8 + T cell effector functions in an influenza mouse model. Splenocytes from vaccinated mice challenged by a lethal PR8 infection were used to measure epitope-specific CD8 T cell effector functions through direct (in vivo cytotoxicity) and indirect (IFN\u03b3-ICS) assays.

Although no cytotoxicity data were obtained in those studies, we argue that the possible discrepancies between IFN\u03b3 production and actual cytotoxic potential of the epitope-specific CD8 + T cells may be one of the causes. In this respect, we believe our multiplex cytotoxicity assay can further validate the epitope candidates in terms of the cytotoxicity potential of the cognate CD8 + T cells. In particular, our approach can be a robust tool for revealing a more comprehensive picture of the protective role of CD8 + T cells stimulated by T cell-based vaccines. Furthermore, the multiplex cytotoxicity assay is also useful for evaluating CD8 + T cell cytotoxicity responses in T cell therapies such as those involving chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cells or cancer vaccines. The multiplex cytotoxicity assay described here produces results that are comparable to that when the conventional single-plex cytotoxicity assay was performed instead (data not shown), which offers several advantages. Firstly, the number of recipient mice needed in a given experimental setup can be reduced, resulting in lower costs, better compliance with animal ethics (the 3R rule), and data that are more reproducible across multiple epitopes. Secondly, CD8 + T cell killing activities in different compartments can be analyzed simultaneously, which will provide data useful for evaluating the efficacy of a vaccine in inducing both systemic and mucosal FIGURE 6 | Discrepancy between direct and indirect measurements of CD8 + T cell effector functions in a Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) mouse model.

Thirdly, the expansion of parameters available for screening allows one to include one or more irrelevant epitopes in the cytotoxicity assay. By definition, irrelevant epitopes should not elicit destruction by CD8 + T cells. However, it has been shown that uninfected cells also undergo apoptosis and necrosis during IAV infection (32) . Hence, we argue that such non-specific killing can apply to intended target cells, and the destruction of irrelevant target cells acts as a control to measure non-specific killing activity, permitting the calculation of actual CD8 + T cell-mediated cytotoxicity levels.",

One would expect that CD8 + T cells that upregulate IFN\u03b3 production should be cytolytic against its cognate targets. However, in an HIV setting, single-cell analysis of individual HIV-specific CD8 + T cells in vitro revealed discordance between IFN\u03b3 expression and cytolytic potential (33) . In three different mouse models of infection tested in our study, we showed that such discrepancies also occur in some epitope-specific CD8 + T cells. In most cases, the discrepancies exist in specific CD8 + T cells that were IFN\u03b3-negative but possess vigorous cytolytic activity. However, this can also happen vice versa. Continuous IFN\u03b3 signaling by activated epitope-specific CD8 + T cells was shown to lead to their reduction of cytolytic potential (34) , suggesting that these cells may downregulate IFN\u03b3 production in order to maintain their cytolytic potential. On the other hand, the finding of substantial IFN\u03b3 production by CD8 + T cells that possess low cytotoxic potential, such as the M64-and M156-specific CD8 + T cells in our MERS-CoVinfected mice, was also unusual.

Besides, evaluations of pathogen-specific CD8 + T cell activities in diseases settings should be cautious when IFN\u03b3 is the only marker used in the assessments. We believe that our multiplex assay might able to fill these gaps.",
