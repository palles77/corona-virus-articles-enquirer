The results showed that most compounds exhibited high inhibitory activities against APN and low activities against MMP-2. Within this series, two compounds 5q and 5s (IC 50 = 5.3 and 5.1 lM) showed similar inhibitory activities compared with bestatin (IC 50 = 3.8 lM), which could be used as novel lead compounds for the future APN inhibitors development as anticancer agents.",

            "text": "Amino-peptidase N (APN/CD13; EC 3.4.11.2) is a zinc-dependent metalloproteinase that cleaves neutral or basic amino acids from the N-terminus of oligopeptides. Scientist found that outside the hematopoietic system, APN was widely expressed on various kinds of cells. For example, epithelial cells of the intestine and kidney, hepatocytes, osteoclasts, endometrial cells, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, bone marrow stromal cells and on neuronal synaptic membranes. APN is involved in many physiology and pathology processes such as hydrolysis of nutrients, inactivation of bioactive peptides, binding of corona viruses, mediating cytomegalovirus infection and antigen presentation. Furthermore, APN has been a target for anti-tumor agents due to its important functions in ECM degradation, tumor cells invasion and tumor angiogenesis. [1] [2] [3] In the past two decades, several APN inhibitors have been found. For example, Bestatin, Probestin, Amastatin, Actinonin, Phebestin, Lapstatin, AHPA-Val, Leuhistin, Curcumin and Pasmmaplin A. [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] Among them, bestatin has been launched and is now widely employed clinically as an anti-tumor agent. 14 In 2006, the 3D structure of APN has been studied according to the co-crystal complex of APN and bestatin by Kiyoshi. 15 Our group has studied the binding site and catalytic domain of APN based on this co-crys-tal complex. The binding sites of APN with bestatin can be divided to three parts. Part 1 is a hydrophobic pocket (S 1 ); part 2 is the zinc binding group (ZBG); part 3 is another hydrophobic pocket in the other side (S 0 1 ). With the help of computer-aided molecular design, in 2008, our group designed and synthesized a series of L-lysine derivatives and found that some compounds exhibited potential APN inhibitory activities 16 (Fig. 1) . Also in 2008, the crystal structures of Escherichia coli amino-peptidase N (e PepN) in complex with L-arginine, L-lysine, L-phenylalanine, L-tyrosine and L-tryptophan have been determined to understand the structural basis for APN's hydrolysis pattern. The result showed that all these amino acids bind with their backbone atoms close to the active-site zinc ion and their side chain occupying the S 1 pocket of e PepN. And the specificity of the S 1 -binding pocket suggest that the preferred amino acid is, in decreasing order, arginine, lysine, tyrosine and phenylalanine. 17 Additionally, arginine is similar with lysine in structure except the guanidinium group and the longer carbon chain. According to the former reasons, we choose L-arginine as the starting material in order to get more efficient and potential APN inhibitors. The compounds designed are showed in Figure 1 .",

For example, 5q with an IC 50 (MMP-2)/ IC 50 (APN) ratio equals to 65.8, while 5s equals to 46.3. The result, to a certain extent, confirmed our strategy for designing APN inhibitors. This possibly descript from the differences between the structures of two enzymes, leading to different requirements for their respective inhibitors. APN is a membranebound zinc exopeptidase that catalyzed the removal of NH 2 -terminal amino acid from the peptide, while MMP-2 is a zinc-dependent endopeptidase that could cut the peptide to parts from the specific amino acid residue of the peptide. The former L-lysine derivatives and 3-phenylpropane-1, 2-diamine derivatives designed by our group to inhibit APN all showed better activities against MMP-2. 16, 18 So L-arginine derivatives are more suitable for APN inhibitors.",

Other docking parameters implied in the program were kept default. From Figure 2 , we can see the backbone of 5s inserted to S 1 pocket, the hydroxymate of 5s interacted with the zinc ion of APN and the 4-bromo-3-nitro benzamide side chain extended to S 0 1 pocket. For a further and detail understanding of the binding mode of 5s with APN, a 2D picture was also created with the program LIGPLOT. In Figure 3 , we can see the backbone of 5s could form hydrophobic contacts with Glu 121 , Met 260 and Tyr 376 of S 1 pocket and form hydrogen bond with Glu 121 by the imine of guanidinium group. The two oxygen atoms of hydroxymate chelated with the zinc ion of APN. The carbonyl of amide in R position could form hydrogen bond with Gly 261 and Ala 262 of S 0 1 pocket.
