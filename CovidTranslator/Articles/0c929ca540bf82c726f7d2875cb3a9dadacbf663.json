The current study seeks to elucidate the mechanisms involved in summoning macrophages to the cochlear lateral wall and the role macrophages play in noiseinduced injury or repair. CCL2 and its primary receptor, CCR2, are the most widely validated effectors of monocyte chemotaxis in vivo. CCL2 -/and CCR2 -/mice have been used extensively in studies of monocyte activation in neuronal injury. However, the function of CCL2 and CCR2 in the cochlea has not been studied. The present study examines the role of CCL2 and CCR2 in acoustic injury. CCL2 -/and CCR2 -/mice on a CX3CR1 +/GFP background were exposed to octave band noise (8-16 kHz) for 2 h to determine the effect of CCL2 and CCR2 on monocyte migration into the cochlea, threshold shift, and cell survival. We found that threshold shift was unchanged in the two knockout mouse strains when compared to the background strain (CX3CR1 +/GFP ). Surprisingly, we found that monocyte migration was also unchanged, despite the absence of CCL2 or CCR2. However, there was a dramatic increase in noise-induced hair cell death in the CCR2 -/strain. This observation suggests that CCR2, independent of CCL2, plays a protective role in the cochlea after noise, and neither ligand nor receptor is necessary for monocyte migration. Possible mechanisms of neuroprotection by CCR2 are discussed.",

A predictable series of morphologic and functional changes occurs in the cochlea following acoustic trauma (Robertson and Johnstone, 1980; Ou et al. 2000; Wang et al. 2002) . The physiologic and histopathologic changes that accompany threshold shift have been well studied. In previous reports on ultrastructural changes associated with acoustic overexposure, various authors have described a phagocytic cell population that appears in the scala media and phagocytoses debris after hair cells are disrupted (Fredelius 1988; Fredelius and Rask-Andersen 1990) . In further investigation of this phagocytic cell population, we have discovered that a robust inflammatory response occurs after noise. Mononuclear phagocytes are recruited to the scala media and to the lateral wall in the basal turn of the cochlea in large numbers after acoustic injury (Hirose et al. 2005) . In this paper, we described the distribution of mononuclear phagocytes in the cochlea and characterized their cell surface markers by using immunohistochemistry. These inflammatory cells populated the membranous labyrinth in small numbers in the native cochlea but seven days after noise, they were abundant in the spiral ligament, spiral ganglion, and spiral limbus, concentrating mostly in the inferior portion of the spiral ligament. They also expressed CD45, CD68, Iba-1 (microglial and macrophage marker), and CX3CR1 (fractalkine receptor).",

CX3CR1 is expressed on a number of myeloid cells including microglia, macrophages, and dendritic cells, as well as natural killer cells and activated T cells. In addition, 90-95% of cochlear cells that are CD45 + , which are by definition leukocytes, express CX3CR1. In addition, GFP expressing cells in CX3CR1 +/GFP mice are shown to phagocytose debris in the injured cochlea. Therefore, the CX3CR1 +/GFP mouse has been clearly demonstrated to label cochlear mononuclear phagocytes that are best described as tissue macrophages (Hirose et al. 2005 ). This mouse has been shown to be useful in identifying these cells not only in the cochlea, but in the central nervous system and in the hematopoietic system as well.",

CCL2 and its primary receptor, CCR2, are the most widely validated effectors of monocyte chemotaxis in vivo (Ransohoff 2002; Rollins 1996) . CCL2 -/and CCR2 -/mice have been extensively used for studies of monocyte function in the central and peripheral nervous systems (Ambati et al. 2003; Dzenko et al. 2001; Han et al. 2004; Huang et al. 2001; Izikson et al. 2000; Mahad and Ransohoff 2003; Peterson et al. 2004; Siebert et al. 2000; Sorensen et al. 2004 ). However, CCL2 and CCR2 have not been studied in the inner ear. The present study addresses the role of CCL2 and CCR2 in the process of monocyte recruitment and hair cell survival after acoustic injury. First, by using quantitative, real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), we demonstrated that CCL2 gene expression is markedly increased in the cochlea after acoustic injury. This finding suggests that CCL2 may play an important role in monocyte migration and activation after acoustic injury. Then, we performed detailed physiologic, histologic/stereologic analysis of CCL2 and CCR2 knockout mice after noise exposure.",

After acoustic injury, CCL2 knockout mice had comparable functional and morphological outcomes to the background strain, CX3CR1 +/GFP .

This pairing generated CCL2 +/-CX3CR1 +/GFP mice and CCR2 +/-CX3CR1 +/GFP mice. These F2 mice were then bred to each other and F3 mice that were CCL2 -/-CX3CR1 +/GFP and CCR2 -/-CX3CR1 +/GFP were selected as experimental animals. The genetic control for these experiments were CX3CR1 +/GFP mice, which we refer to as the background strain. Mice that are CX3CR1 +/GFP have one functioning copy of CX3CR1 and one copy that has been replaced by green fluorescent protein. CX3CR1 is expressed by monocytes, macrophages, and some dendritic cells and NK cells (Hatori et al. 2002; Hughes et al. 2002; Jung et al. 2000) . Therefore, all these cells in the CX3CR1 +/ GFP mice are fluorescent green. Animal protocols described in this work were approved by the Institute for Animal Care and Use Committee.",

The inner hair cell and all three rows of outer hair cells were lost in all four cochleas in the 12-to 20-kHz region. The highfrequency outer hair cells were also severely damaged in this knockout mouse. In the CCR2 -/-CX3CR1 +/GFP mice, there was severe damage to the entire sensory epithelium (Fig. 3D) . This cochlea demonstrated a significant loss of all cell types of the sensory epithelium seven days after the 112-dB noise exposure. Not only were the outer and inner hair cells absent, but the Deiter cells, the Claudius cells, and Hensen cells were all obliterated, leaving only a denuded basement membrane with floating debris under the tectorial membrane. In summary, damage to the sensory epithelium after noise exposure was far worse in CCR2 -/-CX3CR1 +/GFP mice than in the other two mouse strains. Taken together, these data indicated that the pattern of noise damage in the CCR2 -/mice is qualitatively and quantitatively different from that of the background mouse strain and of the CCL2 -/-mouse in two ways. First, in CCR2 -/mice we observed a profound loss of hair cells and all sensory cells in the tonotopically appropriate region for the noise stimulus. We did not observe this degree of hair cell loss in the same area of the other two genotypes, nor did we observe damage to the supporting cells in any location in the other two genotypes. Second, there was a larger percentage of missing outer hair cells in the high-frequency region in the CCR2 -/mouse compared with high-frequency hair cell damage in the other genotypes. These results indicate that CCR2 has a protective effect on cell survival after acoustic injury, independent of the principal ligand, CCL2, and dissociated from any apparent effect on macrophage recruitment. Spiral ganglion cells were not perceptibly different in either of the knockout mouse strains. Spiral ganglion nuclei were of normal size and number, and the swelling that is observed around the cell body and disruption of the myelin sheath that we typically observe after 24 h was also observed here.

The spiral ligament and spiral limbus were considerably more susceptible to noise in the CCR2 mice when compared to the other three genotypes. Figure 4A demonstrates the condition of the CX3CR1 mouse after noise; the spiral ligament was only mildly damaged seven days after exposure to 112 dB noise. However, the same noise exposure resulted in a remarkable loss of spiral ligament fibrocytes in the lower half of the lateral wall of the cochlea. Figure 4B demonstrates a representative section from the cochlea of a CX3CR1 +/GFP mouse, which resembled the findings seen in the wild-type ear after acoustic injury. There was some fibrocyte loss observed beneath the basilar crest in the type IV fibrocyte region (Fig. 4B) . However, in the CCR2 -/mice there was considerably greater loss of fibrocytes, predominantly in the area below the spiral prominence. The cell population that was susceptible in this mouse comprised type II and type IV fibrocytes (Fig. 4C) . The spiral limbus was also considerably more damaged in the CCR2 knockout mice than in the background. Fibrocytes of the spiral limbus were atrophic or absent in the low-frequency region of the cochlea. This finding contrasts to what is observed in the background mouse, where we do not observe any significant injury to the spiral limbus.",

CCR2 has clearly been shown to be important in release of monocytes into the peripheral vasculature, but this does not rely on CCL2, but on CCL7 binding to the CCR2 receptor (Charo 2006) . Likewise, CCL7 may play an important role in binding and activating CCR2, thus providing cochlear protection after noise. Both CCL7 and CCL12 were found to be significantly up-regulated after noise by quantitative real-time PCR although at lower levels than CCL2. In cochleas of CCL2 -/mice, CCL7 and CCL12 remained up-regulated, although it appears that loss of CCL2 expression does not result in compensation by CCL7 or CCL12 as the expression levels of all three chemokines are higher in the wild-type mouse (Shick et al. 2006 ). If CCL7 is the effector molecule for the observed sensitivity to noise conferred by lack of CCR2 expression, this mechanism could provide an explanation for the observed changes in hair cell vulnerability to noise in CCR2 -/mice and not in CCL2 -/mice ( Figure 5 ).",

At this time, we are uncertain as to whether cochlear macrophages limit their activity to phagocytosis, whether they mediate further cochlear injury, or serve a neuroprotective role after acoustic trauma. One approach to study this question is to suppress macrophage recruitment and determine how the outcome differs. We considered the CCL2/CCR2 ligand/receptor pair to be a plausible target in downregulating macrophage recruitment as we detected a large increase in CCL2 expression after acoustic trauma. Furthermore, studies in the central nervous system using trauma, immune-mediated inflammation, and viral infection as models have indicated that monocyte migration is effectively suppressed by eliminating CCL2 or CCR2.",

In both the CCL2 -/-CX3CR1 +/GFP and CCR2 -/-CX3CR1 +/GFP mice, macrophages appeared as numerous as in the background strain in a quantitative analysis of cochlear macrophages. It appears that other chemokine/receptor pairs are capable of replacing the functions of CCL2 and CCR2, particularly when this pair is absent preceding development. Furthermore, we were not able to create a condition in which threshold elevation was different between genotypes. We used two different noise levels for the CCL2 -/-CX3CR1 +/GFP mice and both noise levels produced similar threshold shifts. The 112 dB noise level used in the CCR2 -/-CX3CR1 +/ GFP mice also replicated the threshold shift seen in the background mouse strain.",

            "text": "Nevertheless, the CCR2 knockout mouse did yield interesting results with regard to hair cell survival. While deleting CCR2 had no obvious effects on monocyte migration, its deletion clearly had an effect on hair cell survival. After CCR2 -/mice are exposed to a 112-dB octave band of noise at 8-16 kHz, there is a dramatic loss of hair cells in the corresponding frequency region of the cochlea. This lesion in the sensory epithelium is much larger and more consistent than lesions seen in the ears of the background strain CX3CR1 +/GFP or in the CCL2 -/-CX3CR1 +/GFP strain. The degree of hair cell loss in the high-frequency region is also more severe in the CCR2 -/-CX3CR1 +/GFP when compared with the other two genotypes. Therefore, it appears that CCR2 may play a protective role in the cochlea either through some mechanism related to macrophages in the ear or via independent CCR2 expression on endogenous cells within the cochlea itself. CCR2 is expressed on monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, activated T cells, basophils, and natural killer cells. CCR2 may also be expressed in other cells, particularly in native cells of the ear. Its expression pattern is important to establish, a task that will become possible when a suitable antibody is available. Characterization of which cell types express CCR2 will provide us with insight into the mechanism of CCR2-mediated protection against acoustic overstimulation.",

In acetaminophen-induced hepatotoxicity, CCR2 appears to play a protective role (Hogaboam et al. 2000) . Liver damage caused by acetaminophen overdose is exacerbated in CCR2 knockout mice when compared to wild-type mice. Both wild-type and CCR2 null mice produced elevated CCL2 levels in the liver after drug exposure. However, CCR2 -/mice experienced damage to the liver at a lower drug dose than when compared to wild-type mice. CCR2 mice had significant TUNEL labeling of hepatocytes when wild-type mice demonstrated no cell death and no TUNEL labeling. It is postulated that CCR2 plays an important role in attenuating apoptotic cell death, possibly via interactions with proinflammatory cytokines that are elaborated in response to acetaminophen. Another condition in which CCR2 appears to be protective is in pulmonary tuberculosis. CCR2-dependent trafficking of macrophages, again, independent of CCL2, appears to be an important part of protection of the lung against mycobacterium tuberculosis infection (Peters et al. 2004) . The protective effect of CCR2 in these experiments does appear linked to CCR2mediated macrophage and dendritic cell migration to the lungs and their role in defense against infection.",

The differences in outcome between the ligand and receptor knockout in this experimental paradigm suggest that the interactions between these two molecules are complex and that ligands other than CCL2 are physiologically important ligands for CCR2. Another study that arrives at a similar conclusion is one in which coronavirus infection in the central nervous system is studied in CCL2 -/and CCR2 -/mice (Held et al. 2004 ).

Ligand binding of these chemokine receptors can result in depolarization of sensory neurons (Boddeke 2001) . Further studies have demonstrated that CC chemokine receptors can associate with TRPV1 (vanilloid receptor 1) to open calcium channels or modify the sensitivity of voltage gated ion channels to receptor binding, thereby increasing nociception (Zhang et al. 2005) .

There are three cell types in the cochlea that may express CCR2 and could be instrumental in CCR2-mediated neuroprotection. The cochlear macrophage is the first and most apparent candidate. The cochlear macrophage, described in a previous paper, has been shown to express surface antigens consistent with other tissue macrophages and may also express CCR2. Clearly, if the cochlear macrophage expresses CCR2, it is not reliant on this receptor for recruitment to the ear as the CCR2 -/mouse demonstrates normal macrophage migration after acoustic injury. However, CCR2 may be important in programming the macrophage once it has arrived on site to effect what protective or reparative role it plays. The second possible candidates are the sensory cells themselves. As numerous investigators now have shown, neurons themselves can express CCR2, and ligand binding of CCR2 can result in direct changes in calcium currents and sensitivity to neurotransmitter binding and release (White et al. 2005) . It is possible that hair cells or supporting cells express CCR2, and the protective effect of CCR2 relies on antiapoptotic signals to the sensory cells directly. Finally, the microvascular endothelial cells may possess CCR2, and ligand binding here may result in recruitment or repulsion of other peripheral leukocytes that by some mechanism could provide protection to the cochlea after macrophage recruitment.",

There was more consistent loss of high-frequency outer and inner hair cells (encoding 50 kHz and above) after 8-16 kHz octave band noise (n=4). See panel (B). CCL2 -/ -CX3CR1 +/GFP mice demonstrated no loss of hair cells in the tonotopic region corresponding to the noise stimulus. The high-frequency hair cell loss was confined to outer hair cells only (n=4). See panel (C). CCR2 -/ -CX3CR1 +/GFP mice demonstrated a remarkable loss of hair cells both in the region of the noise band and in the high-frequency region of the cochlea. This was consistent across four mice, all exposed to 112 dB noise. This susceptibility of hair cells to noise was qualitatively different than what we see in the two other genotypes in this experiment. See panel (D). *Difference between hair cell survival in CCR2 -/mice and others is significant ( p G 0.05). Scale bar=25 mm. SAUTTER ET AL.: CCR2 is Protective Against Acoustic Injury 367",
