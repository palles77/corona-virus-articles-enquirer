            "text": "Lactobacillus species are commensal bacteria that have long been recognized as probiotic microbes and are generally regarded as safe (GRAS) for human consumption. We have investigated the use of L. gasseri as a vaccine vector for oral immunization against mucosal pathogens. Recent research has shown that the immune response to different lactobacilli can vary widely depending on the species or subspecies of Lactobacillus being studied. While some lactobacilli seem to induce oral tolerance, others induce an adaptive immune response. This study characterized the systemic and mucosal immune response to wild-type and genetically modified L. gasseri. L. gasseri primarily activates TLR2/6, with additional activation through the TLR2 homodimer. To expand the Toll-like receptor (TLR) activation profile of L. gasseri and the immunogenicity of the vector, a plasmid containing fliC, the gene encoding bacterial flagellin, was introduced which resulted in the strong activation of TLR5. The treatment of human myeloid dendritic cells with recombinant lactobacilli expressing flagellin triggered phenotypic maturation and the release of proinflammatory cytokines. In contrast, bacterial treatment also resulted in a statistically significant increase in IL-10 production. In vivo studies established that treatment with L. gasseri led to a diversification of B-cell populations in the lamina propria of the murine colon. Furthermore, treatment with genetically modified L. gasseri led to a significant decrease in the percentage of FoxP3 \u0609 colonic lymphocytes. Taken together, these data clarify the interaction of L. gasseri with the host immune system and support further investigation of the in vivo immunogenicity of L. gasseri expressing both flagellin and candidate vaccine antigens.",

            "text": "Several species of lactobacilli have been investigated as antigen delivery vehicles against a spectrum of infectious agents, including Helicobacter pylori, tetanus, enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-associated coronavirus, rotavirus, Brucella abortis, and human papillomavirus (reviewed in reference 34). Despite the growing evidence that lactobacilli are useful as vaccine vectors (21) , it is increasingly clear that different species and even subspecies of lactobacilli interact distinctly with the host immune system (1, 32) . Several studies have analyzed the abilities of various Lactobacillus species to induce dendritic cell (DC) maturation and cytokine production, showing a range of outcomes that appear to favor tolerance on one end of the spectrum and immune activation on the other (7, 22) . There also are clear differences in the ability of lactobacilli species to survive the hostile environment of the upper gastrointestinal (GI) tract and colonize the lower GI tract. Functional genomic studies have greatly improved our understanding of some of these characteristics, but much less is known about the molecular and genetic basis of host immunomodulation by Lactobacillus species. One strategy to develop lactobacilli as vaccine vectors is to screen many species and strains using in vitro and in vivo techniques to identify the best strain for a par-ticular application. The alternative is to fully characterize one promising candidate and then genetically modify that candidate for a particular application.",

A recent study has demonstrated the promise of L. gasseri as a vaccine vector, whereby mice were fully protected against challenge with anthrax after immunization with L. gasseri expressing the anthrax protective antigen (21) . Given its niche in the human microbiome, well-studied genome, and success in preliminary vaccine studies, L. gasseri is an attractive candidate for the rational design of an oral vaccine vector.

TLR5 is expressed on the basolateral surface of intestinal epithelial cells (9) , CD11c \u03e9 lamina propria DCs (31) , and the follicle-associated epithelium of Peyer's patches in mice (2), making it a ubiquitous target for orally delivered adjuvants. To expand the TLR activation profile of L. gasseri to include TLR5, we transformed L. gasseri with an expression plasmid, pFliCP, encoding the sequence of flagellin (fliC) from S. Typhimurium (Fig. 1B) . Figure 1C shows that cell lysates from fliC-transformed L. gasseri activate TLR5 in addition to TLR2/6. Live L. gasseri induces greater Toll-like receptor activation than dead lactobacilli. Others have demonstrated differences in the immunogenicity of live versus killed recombinant bacteria (4, 6). We tested whether live or UV-killed lactobacilli were more efficient at activating Toll-like receptors and whether the dosage of killed bacteria influenced the degree of TLR activation. A multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 50 was used. Based on preliminary titration studies, this was the maximum dose of live bacteria that was not cytotoxic to HEK293 cells (data not shown). This dose of live bacteria was compared to four doses of killed bacteria (1:25, 1:50, 1:100, and 1:200) on cell lines expressing TLR2/6 or TLR5 (Fig. 2) . At the 1:50 dose, live bacteria always elicited a greater NF-B response than killed bacteria. At no dose did killed bacteria statistically surpass the ability of live bacteria to increase NF-B production. In our system, live bacteria seem to have a greater intrinsic capacity to activate TLRs than dead bacteria.",

To establish how genetically modified lactobacilli influence dendritic cell maturation and coreceptor expression, the mDC surface expression of major histocompat- Freshly isolated human mDCs pulsed with ATCC 33323, NCK 1785, or FliCP trended toward an increased population of MHC-II \u03e9 CD80 \u03e9 CD86 \u03e9 cells (11.0, 11.6, and 11.6%, respectively) compared to that of untreated control mDCs (3.4%) (Fig. 3) . The percentage of MHCII \u03e9 CD80 \u03e9 CD86 \u03ea cells was higher in the two mDC groups pulsed with genetically modified L. gasseri (8.2 and 9.0%) compared to that of the untreated control mDC population (2.3%) (P \u03fd 0.005). The proportion of MHCII \u03e9 CD80 \u03ea CD86 \u03e9 cells in mDCs pulsed with genetically modified L. gasseri was significantly lower than that of MRS-treated control mDC populations. Recombinant L. gasseri induces proinflammatory cytokine/ chemokine release and a high IL-10/IL-12 ratio in myeloid DCs. We next sought to determine how wild-type and recombinant L. gasseri strains influence cytokine and chemokine production by human mDCs. Lactobacilli were incubated with mDCs for 24 h, and then culture supernatants were quantitatively assayed for cytokine and chemokine levels. Generally, incubation with any L. gasseri treatment resulted in a statistically significant increase in proinflammatory cytokine production by dendritic cells, including IL-1\u2424, IL-1R\u2423, IL-6, IFN-\u2425, TNF-\u2423, GM-CSF, and G-CSF (Fig. 4A and Table 2 ). The addition of lactobacilli to DCs also resulted in a statistically significant increase in chemokine (IL-8, MIP1-\u2423, and MIP1-\u2424) secretion ( Fig. 4B and Table 2 ). Finally, all L. gasseri treat-ments resulted in the increased production of IL-10 compared to that of controls (P \u03fd 0.0001), whereas IL-12 production was not significantly influenced by bacterial treatment (Fig. 4C) . These results suggest that L. gasseri has a role both in promoting a mixed cytokine response by DCs and in the recruitment of immune cells.",

Recent studies have shown that individual probiotic bacteria can influence the mucosal immune response, specifically at immune induction sites in the murine small intestine (3). We sought to determine the role of L. gasseri, generally, and genetically modified lactobacilli, specifically, in the colonic lamina propria, an effector site of the mucosal immune system. We further wanted to determine how L. gasseri expressing the FliC adjuvant would influence plasma cell populations, a change which could affect downstream antibody production after vaccine delivery. Mice were orally administered 1 \u03eb 10 9 CFU of bacteria for three consecutive days prior to euthanasia. Upon euthanasia, mononuclear cells were isolated from colonic tissue and stained for CD45 (to identify all leukocytes), CD19, and CD38. Mature plasma cells (CD19 \u03ea CD38 \u03e9 ) predominated in PBS-treated mice, while all three L. gasseri-treated groups showed the diversification of the colonic B-cell population compared to that of PBS controls (Fig. 5 ). This was characterized by a significantly increased percentage of B cells (CD19 \u03e9 CD38 \u03ea ) and B cells in transition to plasma CD38 \u03e9 ) and was most pronounced in mice treated with wild-type L. gasseri. Wild-type and genetically modified L. gasseri affect the T reg / Th17 ratio in the murine colon. We next sought to determine the effect of L. gasseri treatment on Foxp3 \u03e9 and IL-17 \u03e9 cell populations in the murine colon. Lymphocytes were isolated from the colon after three consecutive days of bacterial treatment. Staining for CD4 \u03e9 Foxp3 \u03e9 cells revealed that treatment with L. gasseri significantly increased the percentage of regulatory T cells (T reg ) in the murine colon compared to that of PBS treatment alone (Fig. 6B) . In contrast, treatment with genetically modified lactobacilli significantly decreased the T reg population of the colon compared to those of both WTand PBS-treated mice.",

To empirically assess the effect of dose on persistence, BALB/c mice were orally gavaged with L. gasseri at five doses: 1 \u03eb 10 7 , 1 \u03eb 10 8 , 1 \u03eb 10 9 , 1 \u03eb 10 10 , and 1 \u03eb 10 11 CFU.

L. gasseri was never recovered from the cecum, small intestine, or large intestine upon the culture of intestinal tissue and luminal contents at necropsy (72 h postinoculation; data not shown). We conclude that 1 \u03eb 10 10 CFU of L. gasseri is the optimal dose for mice, because it persists for up to 48 h and can be readily concentrated into a 100-l dose for oral gavage.",

In the case of lactobacilli, this may not only reduce the efficacy of subsequent boosts by affecting vector persistence but also could result in an anticommensal response, such as that associated with inflammatory bowel disease. To assess the likelihood of an anti-L. gasseri response, we inoculated mice with 1 \u03eb 10 10 CFU of L. gasseri at 2-week intervals for a total of six immunizations. Although variation existed between time points within each inoculation group, no net increase or decrease in the fecal shedding of control or recombinant L. gasseri was observed over time (Fig.  7B) . Thus, a multiboost inoculation approach does not alter host-bacterium interactions in a way that affects the magnitude of fecal shedding or the persistence (beyond 24 h) of the L. gasseri vector in the host.

            "text": "Few studies have reported the effects of the specific activa-tion of TLR2/6 as an adjuvant. In a mouse model of HSV infection, the vaginal pretreatment of mice with the TLR2/6 ligand FSL-1 produced a statistically significant increase in IL-12 and IFN-\u2425 production (26) . FSL-1 treatment of macrophages was shown to increase the phagocytosis of bacteria and upregulate DC-SIGN, while the FSL-1 treatment of dendritic cells induced maturation (14, 16) . The net effect of L. gasseri TLR activation will depend on the cell types in the mucosa expressing TLR2 and the heterodimeric partner, TLR6, and the capacity of L. gasseri to access those cell types. A considerable body of evidence has shown flagellin to be a potent adjuvant for vaccination (20) , and the immunogenic potential of Lactobacillus casei expressing flagellin has been previously reported (11, 12) . In the mucosa, TLR5 signaling promotes the rapid production of IL-17 and IL-22, leading to (33) . Our data show that oral treatment with FliCP did not increase the Th17 cell population of the murine colon. In fact, despite statistical differences in Th17 percentages among treatment groups, percentages were quite low and most likely were not biologically significant. TLR5 is expressed on the extracellular surface of immune cells and the basolateral surface of intestinal epithelial cells, thus the intracellular flagellin expressed by FliCP may not be available to bind TLR5 under these in vivo conditions. This biological sequestration of flagellin may account for the low Th17 percentage we observed compared to those of other studies involving TLR5 signaling (33) . The cell surface expression of FliC could increase TLR5 binding, but it is uncertain whether the surface-expressed FliC could survive gastric acid and bile salts in transit to immune induction sites of the intestine. Further studies involving cell surface-associated flagellin would be necessary to resolve these questions. The cytokine-inducing effects of many strains of lactobacilli on DCs have been reported but typically focus on Th1/2-polarizing cytokines such as IL-10 and IL-12. Given the complexity of the mucosal immune response, we chose to take a more comprehensive look at cytokine and chemokine expression by human myeloid dendritic cells. The synthetic ligand for TLR2/6 (FSL-1) was used as a positive control. L. gasseri induced a broader spectrum and greater magnitude of cytokine/ chemokine expression than FSL-1 alone, suggesting that the immunostimulatory effects of L. gasseri involve more than just TLR2/6 activation. These results are similar to those reported by Zeuthen et al. in studies employing L. acidophilus (35) .",

Both the upregulation and downregulation of IL-12 expression by lactobacilli have been reported to be mediated through TLR2 or NOD2 (30, 35) . The conflicting results are due to the Lactobacillus species used, the cell type evaluated, and the temporal order of TLR2 and NOD2 stimulation. Complicating this further is the complexity of NOD2, which is reported as both a proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory pattern recognition receptor (35) . However, Mohamadzadeh et al. clearly showed that although the oral administration of adjuvanted L. gasseri resulted in a high IL-10/IL-12 ratio, the net effect of the bacterial treatment was significant protection against B. anthracis infection (21) . Although the relative amount of IL-10 and IL-12 often is cited as a predictor of inflammatory status, the results from the Mohamadezadeh et al. study suggest that the IL-10/IL-12 ratio cannot be relied upon alone to predict vaccine effectiveness. Thus, the mixed inflammatory profile resulting from L. gasseri treatment should not deter the usage of L. gasseri as a vector. The cumulative effect of the cytokine milieu will need to be studied in more detail to determine its consequences on downstream immune responses.",

However, the long-term colonization of recombinant L. gasseri in the gastro-intestinal tract may not be optimal for several reasons. First, there may be unintended consequences if recombinant L. gasseri were to compete with and potentially alter the host microbiome. Additionally, the long-term shedding of a genetically modified organism is unlikely to achieve regulatory approval. Lastly, colonization may not be compatible with immunogenicity. A recent study by Round et al. (27) clearly demonstrated that commensal colonization is dependent on T reg induction by the bacteria, whereas in our case, T reg induction likely would FIG. 7 .

Interestingly, we found that recombinant L. gasseri significantly reduced the percentage of T reg in the colonic lamina propria. This did not lead to clinical or gross pathological abnormalities or to the induction of an anti-Lactobacillus antibody response. To our knowledge, no previous studies have reported the effect of oral Lactobacillus treatment on B-cell populations of the murine colon. Our studies showed that treatment with L. gasseri significantly increased the percentage of cells that had not yet differentiated to mature plasma cells. This may explain the association of increased mucosal IgA with oral L. gasseri treatment (24) . Whether L. gasseri in general and FliCP in particular affect the magnitude or kinetics of plasma cell induction should be further investigated using techniques to measure the absolute numbers of cells in the colonic lamina propria rather than simply percentages.",
