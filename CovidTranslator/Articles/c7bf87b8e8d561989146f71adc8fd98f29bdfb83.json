Though raw date palm sap consumption and person-to-person contact are recognized as major transmission pathways, alternative pathways of transmission are plausible and may not have been identified due to limited statistical power in each outbreak. We conducted a risk factor analysis using all 157 cases and 632 controls surveyed in previous investigations during 2004-2012 to identify exposures independently associated with Nipah, since date palm sap was first asked about as an exposure in 2004. To further explore possible rare exposures, we also conducted in-depth interviews with all cases, or proxies, since 2001 that reported no exposure to date palm sap or contact with another case. Cases were 4.9 (95% 3.2-7.7) times more likely to consume raw date palm sap and 7.3 (95% 4.0-13.4) times more likely to have contact with a Nipah case than controls. In-depth interviews revealed that 39/182 (21%) of Nipah cases reporting neither date palm sap consumption nor contact with another case were misclassified. Prevention efforts should be focused on interventions to interrupt transmission through date palm sap consumption and person-to-person contact. Furthermore, pooling outbreak investigation data is a good method for assessing rare exposures.",

Therefore, this study aimed to identify rare risk factors for Nipah virus disease by combining all outbreak data from 2004 to 2012. We also aimed to identify other possible exposures to Pteropus fruit bats, the reservoir hosts for Nipah virus, or sick animals that were not adequately addressed in epidemiologic investigations but may have contributed to transmission ( Fig. 1) (Halpin et al. 2011 ).",

Probable cases presented with febrile illness and altered mental status and had an epidemiologic link to a laboratory-confirmed case, but died before a blood specimen could be collected or before antibodies may have developed (Ramasundram et al. 2000) . Trained interviewers used structured questionnaires to collect basic demographics, household characteristics, travel histories, exposures related to animal, fruit, and contact with a Nipah case. Questionnaires were administered to cases who survived without neurological impairment or, for most cases, two to three proxy respondents. Proxy respondents were selected from within the case household or from others who had daily interactions with the case. Three, sometimes four, geographically matched controls per case were also interviewed. Consumption of raw date palm sap was added to the questionnaire in 2004 and fermented date palm sap, locally known as tari, was added in 2012 (Islam 2011) . Prior to 2004, questionnaires varied and controls were matched for age, sex, and geography. As a result, we restricted our analysis to data collected since 2004.",

We combined these data and calculated summary statistics of frequencies and means for all possible exposures. We recoded \"don't know\" responses as \"no\" to not reduce the sample size and delete observations with any \"don't know\" entry; the proportion of such responses did not exceed 10% for any exposure. This recoding would result in an underestimate in the effect of any one exposure. We used conditional logistic regression to build univariable models to investigate associations between each exposure and being a Nipah case, after adjusting for age and sex. We adjusted P values for multiple comparisons using the Bonferroni correction method (Holm 1979) . We capped adjusted P values at 1, so that if an adjusted P value was greater than 1, we only reported 1. We included contact with another Nipah case and history of consuming raw date palm sap in all possible models as we were interested in knowing if other exposures were independently associated with Nipah infection. A multivariable model of best fit was then built using the Akaike Information Criterion and biological plausibility, while still adjusting for age and sex. We calculated odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), qualifying an association as significant based on a P value < 0.05. Since our probable case definition did not include laboratory confirmation, we conducted a sensitivity analysis using only lab-confirmed Nipah cases.",

Though calculating the attributable risk from an odds ratio is problematic because odds ratios are not collapsible (Greenland et al. 1999b) , because the disease of interest is rare, the odds ratio is a good approximation of the relative risk of Nipah virus. Though the risk of Nipah virus is geographically variable and stronger in the areas where cases and controls are selected, we assume the disease of interest is rare as few Nipah cases occur in the country of Bangladesh (Cummings 2009 ).",

The interviewers collected detailed field notes on general practices of date palm sap and tari consumption, including whether cases engaged in these exposures prior to illness, as these exposures were not investigated in the first questionnaire. Dropped fruit consumption, typical animal contact, contact with a Nipah case, occupation, and travel were additionally asked about, both as general practices and exposures prior to illness.

This association could represent a proxy for bats contaminating raw date palm sap at night and a bias of case-patients having prior knowledge that the disease is spread by bats. As the cumulative effects of multiple factors are not necessarily additive, the attributable risk of Nipah infection for bats being around the house at night (40%) is likely largely accounted for in the attributable risk for drinking date palm sap (50%) (Benichou 2001) . Additionally, while case-patients were more likely to travel outside their sub-district, this association could represent our inability to capture exposures to date palm sap or a Nipah case that occurred during travels, as village proxies likely did not travel with casepatients and, therefore, could not report on exposures during travel. In support of this, other studies suggest that date palm sap is not available in every village and that availability of the sap is a primary determinant of whether individuals consume it or not (Nahar et al. 2015) . Although we do not know of outbreaks occurring in areas where these people traveled, they may have encountered cases that went unobserved by our surveillance system. Therefore, the attributable risk of Nipah infection for traveling to another sub-district (22%) could largely be accounted for in the attributable risk of having contact with a Nipah case (30%) or drinking date palm sap (50%).",

This could be due to chance variation, as based on a 95% confidence interval, 1 in 20 significant findings will be spurious (Rothman et al. 2012) . The more likely explanation though may be that due to the high case fatality of Nipah, controls were able to report exposures more completely than cases. While it is possible that sour fruits with high vitamin C content may have a protective effect against viral infection through ascorbic acid, there was no observed association between eating fruit and Nipah infection in the multivariable model of best fit (Atherton et al. 1978 ).",

Since most Nipah case-patients die, proxy respondents were asked about case-patient exposures. As proxies may have had limited knowledge of casepatients' activities prior to illness, this likely leads to inaccurate reporting and an underestimate of relevant exposures. This differential misclassification of exposures would lead to a bias towards the null, however, because the reported exposures are likely an underestimate. Therefore, the reported associations are likely an underestimate of true associations. Furthermore, we could not control for having a proxy respondent in the analysis since, as is inherent in case-control studies, selection of study participants is related to the outcome. Because the exposures of consuming date palm sap and having contact with a Nipah case are strongly associated with the outcome, which has a high case fatality, these exposures are spuriously linked to having a proxy respondent (Greenland et al. 1999a; Cole et al. 2010; Rothman et al. 2012 ). This limitation is inherent to investigations of diseases with high case fatality and should be considered in data analysis and interpretation.",

Interviews that use structured questionnaires are less likely to elicit honest responses of sensitive information, as they are relatively shorter by comparison and less likely to build rapport (Steckler et al. 1992) . Qualitative interviews are also imperfect, however; they can result in confirmation bias as a result of prodding by the interviewer, as discussed in anthropologic research literature (Bernard 1984) . Furthermore, when multiple proxy respondents are interviewed, it is important to note how discrepancies between answers will be interpreted.

The use of bamboo skirts around the date palm sap collection area on trees prevents bat contamination of sap and can be practiced more widely, thereby reducing population risk Nahar et al. 2014) . For Nipah infection spread, handwashing with soap has had a significantly protective effect (Gurley et al. 2007a) and interventions to promote handwashing and increase access to handwashing stations in hospitals are urgently needed. Though some infection control has been ongoing, limited infection control within hospitals and by family caregivers continue to be major contributors to disease transmission (Ram et al. 2011; Islam et al. 2014) . The recent West Africa Ebola outbreak made evident the difficulty of infection control in limited resource settings and the need for interventions to prevent person-to-person transmission, especially for similarly fatal, emerging infections (Chertow et al. 2014) . Importantly, improving such interventions could cause additional benefits by reducing other bat-borne pathogens, including emerging and endemic pathogens, which could transmit via contaminated fluids or from person-toperson.",
