A single chain variable fragment antibody (N18) with high affinity against N protein of SARS-CoV was isolated. Sequence analysis revealed that the VL gene was composed of VL3 h (V lambda subgroup) and JL2 regions and the VH gene was composed of VH1-69 (VH1 subgroup), D2-15, D3-22 and JH6 regions. Soluble N18 antibody was expressed in Escherichia coli HB2151, purified by NieNTA affinity chromatography and verified by SDS-PAGE and Western blot. The potential application for early diagnosis was evaluated using N protein capture ELISA in which N18 antibody demonstrated high sensitive activity in detecting N protein of SARS-CoV. Finally, the potential usefulness of the N18 antibody in prophylaxis, vaccine design and therapy of SARS is discussed.",

Although RT-PCR is a useful assay, it sometimes provides false-positive results due to contamination. Serological tests, however, do not provide early diagnosis [8] . Since SARS-CoV appears in the blood much earlier than the antibodies [9] , the identification of SARS-CoVantigens in sera provides a possible method for early diagnosis. Several studies have found that N protein is highly immunogenic, and antibody response in SARS patients is directed most frequently and predominantly to the nucleocapsid [10, 11] . Based on these findings, we constructed a single chain antibody library to isolate anti-N protein antibodies for early diagnosis and possible therapeutic use.",

            "text": "It is very interesting that only one scFv was isolated from a large library (3 \u00c2 10 9 members) with good diversity. A similar result was reported in the isolation of scFv antibody against SARS-CoV from a semi-synthesized scFv library [22] . The reason behind our result may be that the isolated scFv antibody N18 has the competitive affinity advantage in the panning and rapidly wiped out others in further stringent pannings. Therefore, fewer rounds of panning would help to get more diverse antibodies. More rounds of stringent panning may help to enrich the high affinity antibodies, but will reduce the diversity at the same time. In the present study, only four rounds of standard panning were performed, but the population was already overwhelmed by N18. It would be advisable to isolate scFv-phages after the second or third round of panning if one is interested in obtaining more diverse antibodies instead of the antibody with the highest affinity.",

Therefore, it is reasonable to believe that the two mutations in the CDR3 of the light chain and especially the long unique sequence of GYWGSGYH (from H94a-f to H96) in the CDR3 of the heavy chain due to the rearrangement between the regions of D2-15, D3-22 and JH6 are necessary for recognition of the N protein epitope. The standard genetic mechanism for the VDJ rearrangement in the formation of immunoglobulins was that only one V, one D and one J gene segment join together. Two D segments appearing in one CDR3 is a rare phenomenon. Dr. Baskin reported that DeD fusions in one CDR3 could be observed in all the fetal livers as well as in the adult PBMC, as previously reported [23e25]. The DeD fusion could have resulted from an error in VDJ rearrangement, and may lead to increased antibody's diversity.",

This study may provide some useful information for studies in the human humoral immunization against SARS-CoV or the vaccine development.",

The property of N18 scFv antibody that could detect N protein in a very low concentration in the capture ELISA makes it a potential useful reagent in the SARS prophylaxis and treatment. Furthermore, due to its easy, rapid and cheap production, it may be a good substitute for the monoclonal antibodies and anti-N serum [6, 7] . It is unlikely that the antibodies against N protein play a neutralizing role due to its internal position in the virion. However, some researchers reported that monoclonal antibodies (MAb) to N protein of murine hepatitis virus (MHV, an animal coronavirus) [26] and rotavirus [27] had protective effect on the virus infection even though the antibodies lacking of neutralizing activity. The latter phenomenon may be due to the ability of the IgA antibodies to enter the infected cells by the IgA-transcytosis pathway, thereby interfering with viral transcription [28] . So whether the N18 scFv antibody itself or a modified IgA format by being fused to an IgA Fc fragment has the similar protective effect in vivo needs to be further investigated.",
