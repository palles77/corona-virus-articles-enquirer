In this study, we evaluated the patterns of TLR2-, TLR3-and TLR9-expressing antigen presenting cells (APCs) in spleen and blood of gnotobiotic (Gn) pigs after colonization with a mixture of two strains of lactic acid bacteria (LAB), Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus reuteri or infection with the virulent human rotavirus (HRV) Wa strain. We also assessed the influence of LAB on TLR and serum innate cytokine responses induced by HRV. Distributions of subpopulations of APCs [CD14+/\u2212SWC3+CD11R1\u2212 monocytes/macrophages and CD14+/\u2212SWC3+CD11R1+ conventional dendritic cells (cDCs)] were described in our previous report (, L., 2008. Lactic acid bacterial colonization and human rotavirus infection influence distribution and frequencies of monocytes/macrophages and dendritic cells in neonatal gnotobiotic pigs. Vet. Immunol. Immunopathol. 121,. We demonstrated that LAB induced strong TLR2-expressing APC responses in blood and spleen, HRV induced a TLR3 response in spleen, and TLR9 responses were induced by either HRV (in spleen) or LAB (in blood). LAB and HRV have an additive effect on TLR2-and TLR9-expressing APC responses, consistent with the adjuvant effect of LAB. Overall, the frequencies of TLR-expressing CD14+ APCs were higher than CD14\u2212 APCs. LAB enhanced the IFN-\u03b3 and IL-4 responses in serum, but it had a suppressive effect on the TLR3-and TLR9-expressing CD14\u2212 APC responses in spleen and the serum IFN-\u03b1 response induced by HRV. These results elucidated the systemic TLR2-, TLR3-, and TLR9-expressing monocyte/macrophage and cDC responses after HRV infection, LAB colonization, and the two combined. Our findings facilitate the understanding of the mechanism of LAB's adjuvant effect on rotavirus vaccines and the diverse innate and adaptive immune responses induced by commensal LAB colonization versus rotavirus infection and the interactions between them.",

TLRs are expressed on many cell types, but mainly on professional antigen presenting cells (APCs), e.g. monocytes/macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs) . TLR activation induces type I interferon production through several signaling pathways that lead to anti-viral and proinflammatory cytokine responses and induction of adaptive immune responses (Sandor and Buc, 2005; Seth et al., 2006) . Different microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs) are recognized by different TLRs . TLR2, in association with TLR1 and/or TLR6, recognizes peptidoglycans, lipopeptides, and lipoteichoic acids from Gram-positive bacteria (Modlin, 2002) . TLR3 recognizes doublestranded (ds) viral RNA, which is found in rotavirus genome and many other viruses during their replication cycles (e.g. negative-stranded RNA viruses), and synthetic polyinosinepolycytidylic acid (polyI:C). TLR9 recognizes unmethylated CpG DNA found abundantly in bacterial and viral genomes (Werling and Jungi, 2003) . Both TLR3 and TLR9 play crucial role in defense against viral infection in vivo (Tabeta et al., 2004) . Alterations in TLR expression levels in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) have been reported in various viral infections de Kruif et al., 2008; Lester et al., 2008; Sato et al., 2007; Xu et al., 2007 and have been directly correlated with plasma viral load (Lester et al., 2008) or associated with the severity of disease outcomes (de Kruif et al., 2008; Xu et al., 2007) .",

Rotavirus virion has a non-enveloped, triple-layered capsid structure that surrounds the genome, which is composed of 11 segments of dsRNA. Rotavirus replicates mainly in the mature epithelial cells of the small intestinal villi and causes villous atrophy . However, recent studies confirmed that rotavirus infection is not restricted to the intestinal tract. Rotavirus infection has an acute phase of viremia (Azevedo et al., 2005; Blutt and Conner, 2007) . Thus, TLR-expressing APC responses in systemic lymphoid tissues may contribute to the anti-viral immunity or pathogenesis in rotavirus infection. Patients with acute rotavirus infection had elevated mean levels of TLR2, TLR3, TLR4, TLR7, TLR8 mRNA expression in PBMCs within 3 days of onset of the disease (Xu et al., 2006) .",

Lactic acid bacteria (LAB), including lactobacilli are widely evaluated as probiotics in animals and humans (Vaughan et al., 2002) and have been shown to significantly stimulate gut epithelial cell proliferation (Ichikawa et al., 1999) , enhance innate and acquired immunity in young lab animals (mice, rats) and children (Herias et al., 1999; Yasui et al., 1999) and suppress intestinal inflammation (Zocco et al., 2006) . Several LAB strains have been shown to reduce the severity of acute rotavirus gastroenteritis in children (Majamaa et al., 1995; Shornikova et al., 1997) . The mechanisms of LAB's beneficial effects on human and animal health are the subject of many ongoing studies. Our studies are focused on LAB's effect on innate and adaptive immune responses to rotavirus infection (Zhang et al., 2008a,c) and the adjuvant effect on rotavirus vaccines (Zhang et al., 2008b) . The adjuvant effect of several LAB strains has been documented in humans and in pigs (de Vrese et al., 2005; Isolauri et al., 1995; Kaila et al., 1992; Link-Amster et al., 1994; Olivares et al., 2007; Zhang et al., 2008b) ; however, the mechanism is undefined. It is known that many LAB strains are full of CpG islands in the genome (Rachmilewitz et al., 2004) ; therefore, lactobacilli may exert an immunostimulating effect via activation of TLR9 on APCs.",

The Gn pig model of human rotavirus (HRV) infection and diarrhea has been well defined in our previous studies Yuan and Saif, 2002) . Early and late cytokine responses (e.g. IFN-\u03b3, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12, TGF-\u03b21, and TNF-\u03b1) in serum of Gn pigs infected with the virulent Wa HRV have been reported (Azevedo et al., 2006) . In this study, we evaluated the effect of LAB on early cytokine responses as they are indicators of activation of innate immune cells via PRR. Besides being a differentiation/maturation marker of monocytes/macrophages and DCs (Carrasco et al., 2001; Paillot et al., 2001; Summerfield et al., 2003) , CD14 is also a PRR and plays a role in the innate immune response. It directly interacts with intracellular TLR3 and enhances dsRNAmediated TLR3 activation by aiding uptake of dsRNA into cells (Lee et al., 2006) . Because the monocytes (while in blood circulation) and macrophages (after entering spleen) are defined by the same cell markers, we refer to them as monocytes/macrophages in both locations (Zhang et al., 2008c) . It was previously found that LAB significantly reduced the total, but not CD14 +, frequencies of monocytes/macrophages and cDCs in spleen of LAB plus HRV pigs compared to HRV-only pigs (Zhang et al., 2008c) . The influences of LAB on frequencies of TLR2-, TLR3-and TLR9-expressing CD14+ versus CD14\u2212 monocytes/macrophages and DCs in the spleen and blood of HRV-infected Gn pigs were evaluated in this study to further clarify the effect of LAB on the responses in different APC subpopulations in systemic lymphoid tissues.",

As shown in Fig. 1 , similar frequencies of SWC3+TLR2+ and SWC3+TRL9+ monocytes were detected by antihuman and anti-pig TLR antibodies. We repeated the experiment in three pigs ( Fig. 1 shows the representative frequencies). The differences in frequencies of SWC3+TLR2+ or SWC3 +TRL9+ detected by anti-human and anti-pig antibodies were less than 0.5% and were not statistically significant. These results confirmed that the anti-human TLR antibodies are applicable for study of TLR responses in pigs. To date, anti-pig TLR3 is not commercially available.

The concentrations of IFN-\u03b3 and IL-4 in the LAB plus HRV group were higher or significantly higher than the HRV-only group, suggesting an adjuvant effect of LAB on both Th1 and Th2 type responses (Fig. 5) . The mean IFN-\u03b3 and IL-4 concentrations were 4-to 11-fold higher in the LAB plus HRV group compared to the HRV-only group.

The concentrations of IL-12 in the LAB plus HRV and HRV-only groups were significantly higher than the LAB-only and the mock control groups at PID 2. At PID 5, however, IL-12 concentrations in the LAB-only group were significantly higher than the LAB plus HRV and the HRV-only groups and they were all significantly higher than the mock control group. Thus, IL-12 responses were stimulated by both HRV infection and LAB colonization but with different kinetics.

In this study, we evaluated the frequencies of systemic TLR2-, TLR3-and TLR9-expressing CD14+ and CD14\u2212 APCs in Gn pigs colonized with LAB, infected with HRV, or both. Previously, the TLR expression in pigs has been studied only at the mRNA level in tissues by using real-time quantitative PCR because antibodies against porcine TLRs are not currently available (Burkey et al., 2007; Tohno et al., 2006; Willing and Van Kessel, 2007) . Using cross reactive anti-human TLR antibodies enabled us to evaluate the expression pattern at the protein level for cell surface (TLR2) and intracellular (TLR3, TLR9) TLR expression in the defined porcine APC subpopulations. LAB intestinal colonization alone had a profound stimulating effect on early postnatal development of the systemic innate immune cells, as evidenced by the significantly increased total frequencies of monocytes/macrophages and cDCs and the CD14+ monocyte/macrophage frequencies in spleen (Zhang et al., 2008c) , the significantly increased TLR2-and TLR9expressing CD14+ cDCs in blood, and the significantly elevated serum pro-Th1 cytokine (IL-12) level at PID 5. The induction of TLR2-and TLR9-expressingcDC andIL-12 responses can be explained, atleast partially, by the presence of TLR2 and TLR9 ligands (peptidoglycan in the cell wall and CpG motifs in the genome for TLR2 and TLR9, respectively) in the LAB. We identified 6405 CpG islands in the whole genome of L. acidophilus NCFM (Altermann et al., 2005) using EMBOSS CpGPlot (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/emboss/cpglot/index.html). Induction of TLR2-and TLR9-expressing cDC and enhancement of the IFN-\u03b3 and IL-4 responses may provide the mechanism for the adjuvanticity of LAB in enhancing cellular and humoral immune responses induced by influenza virus, poliovirus and rotavirus vaccines and rotavirus or Salmonella typhi Ty21a infections (de Vrese et al., 2005; Isolauri et al., 1995; Kaila et al., 1992; Link-Amster et al., 1994; Olivares et al., 2007; Zhang et al., 2008b) . Our results are consistent with other studies, e.g. (1) feeding L. casei increased TLR2 expression in Peyer's patches in mice (Galdeano and Perdigon, 2006) ; and (2) L. paracasei and L. salivarius significantly increased the production of IL-12 in PBMC of healthy adults (Castellazzi et al., 2007) .",

Notably, in LAB plus HRV pigs, the frequencies of TLR3-and TLR9-expressing CD14\u2212 APCs in spleen were significantly reduced compared to the HRV-only pigs. The reduced TLR3-and TLR9expressing CD14\u2212 APC responses correlated significantly with the reduced serum IFN-\u03b1 level in this pig group. Our previous study also showed that the LAB plus HRV pigs had significantly reduced total frequencies of APCs in spleen, reduced total frequencies of monocytes/ macrophages in ileum, and significantly reduced frequencies of CD14+ monocytes/ macrophages in ileum than the HRV-only pigs (Zhang et al., 2008c) . Because the viremia level and fecal virus shedding titers did not differ significantly among the HRV-infected pigs with or without LAB, the reductions are not likely due to reduced HRV replication, although some studies have indicated that probiotic feeding can reduce rotavirus shedding (Mao et al., 2008; Saavedra et al., 1994; Yasui et al., 1999) . Thus, the results may suggest that LAB colonization has a down-regulatory effect on subpopulations of APCs in HRV-infected pigs.

Frequencies of TLR2-, TLR3-and TLR9-expressing APCs in blood of the HRV-only pigs were similar to the control (LAB\u2212HRV\u2212) pigs. The lack of TLR responses in blood in the HRV-only pigs is consistent with our previous findings showing that HRV infection did not increase frequencies of total APCs or CD14+ cDCs, and significantly reduced the total frequencies of CD14+ monocytes/macrophages at PID 5 in blood (Zhang et al., 2008c) . The potential reasons for the considerable differences between the APC response in spleen and blood may be because (1) MNCs were collected at only one time point (PID 5), TLR-expressing APC responses occurring in the blood at an earlier time point might have been missed; or (2) splenic and circulating APCs are diverse APC populations and they react to MAMP stimulation from LAB and HRV differently. To date, the only two previous studies of TLR responses induced by rotavirus infection were conducted by measuring TLR mRNA levels in intestinal tissues (Aich et al., 2007) or PBMC (Xu et al., 2006) . Bovine rotavirus induced strong TLR3 mRNA expression in the intestinal tissue of newborn calves at 18 h postinoculation (Aich et al., 2007) . Rotavirus infected children had significantly elevated expression of TLR2, TLR3, TLR8 mRNA levels in PBMCs within 3 days of diarrhea onset and the elevated TLR mRNA expression lasted for 7-14 days (Xu et al., 2006) . The time frame for sample collection in the children overlapped with that in Gn pigs. Thus, the lack of TLR responses in blood APCs of the HRV-only pigs may not be solely due to the single sample collection time point; however, it is important to investigate the TLR responses to HRV at an earlier time point (PID 2-3) in the future study.",

Likewise were the TLR2, TLR4, TLR7 and TLR8 mRNA responses in rotavirus infected children (Xu et al., 2006) . Further studies are needed to understand these observations. Rotavirus dsRNA are known to be recognized only by TLR3 (Matsumoto et al., 2003; Sato et al., 2006; Zhou et al., 2007) . A recent study by Zhou et al. (2007) demonstrated that recognition of rotavirus dsRNA by TLR3 on intestinal epithelial cells triggers the secretion of IL-15, which functions to increase the percentage of intestinal intra epithelial lymphocytes and enhances their cytotoxicity in mice. Another study of rats (Sato et al., 2006) also showed that rotavirus dsRNA induced severe apoptosis and diminished wound repair in intestinal epithelial cells through TLR3 activation. Hence, TLR3 may be involved in the pathogenesis of rotavirus gastroenteritis. Study of the TLR3 response induced by HRV and LAB in the intestinal epithelial and lymphoid tissues is the objective of our ongoing investigation.",

The patterns of TLR9-expressing CD14+ APCs were similar to those of TLR3 in spleen and to those of TLR2 in blood. These data provide incidental evidence that TLR9 is involved in the innate immune responses induced by both LAB and HRV. RNA viruses are found to have a low presence of CpG dinucleotides in their genomes (Greenbaum et al., 2008) . We identified 52 CpG islands in the whole genome of the virulent Wa HRV (Yuan, unpublished data) using EMBOSS CpGPlot. The presence of CpG motifs may explain the HRV-induced TLR9-expressing APC responses. TLR9-expressing APC responses were induced by either LAB or HRV depending on the cell type and location. LAB alone induced a significant TLR9expressing CD14+ cDC response in blood, whereas HRV alone induced significant TLR9expressing CD14\u2212 (and some CD14+) monocyte/macrophage and cDC responses in spleen. LAB plus HRV induced the highest frequencies of TLR9-expressing CD14+ monocytes/ macrophages in spleen and blood, which is consistent with the adjuvant effect of LAB on HRV vaccine-induced B and T cell immune responses (Zhang et al., 2008b) .",

LAB had significant influence on IFN-\u03b3, IL-4, IFN-\u03b1 and TGF-\u03b2 serum responses induced by HRV infection. LAB plus HRV induced significantly lower levels of serum IFN-\u03b1 and higher levels of TGF-\u03b2 than HRV alone, suggesting the regulatory effect of LAB. However, LAB plus HRV pigs had significantly higher (4-to 11-fold) serum IFN-\u03b3 and IL-4 concentrations compared to the HRV-only pigs, which is consistent with the adjuvant effect of LAB on HRV-induced immune responses. In the previous study of cytokine responses to HRV in Gn pigs (Azevedo et al., 2006) , serum TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3, IL-4, IL-10, IL-6 and IL-12 levels after HRV infection peaked between PID 1-5, whereas TGF-\u03b2 peaked later at PID 14. IFN-\u03b1 levels were not measured previously. We selected PID 2 and PID 5 in this study to correspond with the peaks of most cytokines after HRV infection in Gn pigs. AlthoughserumIL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 responses peaked onPID3in the early study (Azevedo et al., 2006) , the responses in this study were low and no significant differences among groups were observed. Future studies should include more time points for detection of TLR and innate cytokine responses to better understand the kinetics of innate immune responses induced by LAB, HRV and the two combined.",

Our findings facilitate the understanding of the mechanism for LAB's adjuvant effect on rotavirus vaccines and the diverse innate and adaptive immune responses induced by commensal LAB colonization versus rotavirus infection and the interactions between them. Comparisons between anti-human and anti-pig TLR antibodies for detection of TLR2 and TLR9 expression in pig blood monocytes. The frequencies of SWC3+TLR2+ and SWC3 +TLR9+ monocytes detected by the different TLR antibodies are labeled on each dot plot. Dot plots show the representative of results from three pigs. Blood MNCs isolated from three normal conventional pigs were stimulated in vitro with CpG OND D19 (1 \u03bcM) (Watarai et al., 2008) or Bacillus subtilis peptidoglycan (10 \u03bcg/ml) for 48 h before staining. The MNCs were stained with SWC3a-biotin and streptavidin-PerCP and followed by the PE conjugated anti-human TLR2 and TLR9, respectively (see Section 2) or followed by the rabbit anti-pig TLR2 and TLR9 polyclonal antibodies (Cosmo Bio Co., Japan) respectively, and then a PE conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Open Biosystems, Huntsville, AL). Example of frequencies of TLR3-expressing splenic monocytes/macrophages of Gn pigs from each treatment group. Treatment group is labeled on each dot plot: LAB+HRV+, pigs were inoculated with LAB and virulent Wa strain HRV; LAB\u2212HRV+, pigs were inoculated with HRV only; LAB+HRV\u2212, pigs were inoculated with LAB only; and LAB\u2212HRV\u2212, pigs were mock inoculated. Monocytes/macrophages were defined as CD14+/\u2212SWC3+CD11R1\u2212 (Zhang et al., 2008c) . CD14/TLR3 dot plots were performed within the SWC3+CD11R1\u2212 subpopulation. The dot plot at lower left corner shows a TLR3 isotype control staining which included antibodies to all the cell markers (SWC3, CD11R1 and CD14), except that the antibodies to TLR3 were replaced by the isotype-matched antigen-irrelevant control antibodies. Frequencies of TLR2-, TLR3-, and TLR9-expressing CD14+ and CD14\u2212 APCs in spleen of Gn pigs at PID 5. Gn pigs were inoculated with LAB and virulent Wa strain HRV (LAB+HRV +), HRV only (LAB\u2212HRV+), LAB only (LAB+HRV\u2212) or mock (LAB\u2212HRV\u2212). The y-axis is the mean frequencies (%) of CD14+ or CD14\u2212 TLR-expressing cells among monocytes/ macrophages or cDCs. Note the difference in y-axis scales between CD14+ and CD14\u2212 APCs. The error bars represent standard error of the mean (n = 4). The letters A, B, and C indicate the results of significance testing for difference between treatments. Unshared letters indicate significant difference between treatment groups on frequencies of the TLR-expressing APCs (Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test, p < 0.05), while shared letters indicate no significant difference.
