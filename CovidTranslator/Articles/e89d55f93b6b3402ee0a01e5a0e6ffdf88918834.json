It was found that: (1) there was an overall increase in knowledge of bioevent preparedness; (2) participants gave high ratings for the effectiveness of the PBL process; (3) participants found value in the multidisciplinary group process; and (4) participants strongly agreed that they preferred the PBL process to the traditional lecture format for learning about bioevent preparedness. The PBL approach is useful in educating community-based health professionals from different disciplines about issues related to pandemic preparedness.",

Multidisciplinary education has been called \"the best vehicle to prepare professionals to increase collaboration\" [9] . As has been found with other multidisciplinary groups [7, 9] , the members almost unanimously valued their experience of participating in this diverse group exercise. Participants from the multiple disciplines felt that they had provided ideas that contributed to the success of the case, that they could express their ideas without judgment, agreed that the group had worked cooperatively rather than competitively, and that all viewpoints from the represented disciplines were equally accepted. These results support other research that has found the benefits of The process benefited from the 3. multidisciplinary training include harmonious group functioning and an increased understanding and respect for other professional's contributions [4] . One medical student noted, \"[the case] gave me a different perspective on learning medical issues\"; another commented that for them, the case \"brought to light public health and psychosocial issues\" related to bioevents. One participant wanted to see even more of his/her field represented within the context of the case \"so that the medical students could gain a better knowledge of how an assessment is done\". This exposure to a wide range of health workers and the anticipated outcome of an enhanced understanding of others' roles and responsibilities can potentially improve relationships, increase trust, and dispel stereotypes across disciplines, in turn strengthening a coordinated response to emergencies. There are also difficulties and constraints associated with conducting multidisciplinary PBL groups that have been identified elsewhere and were partially identified here. Most notable was the effect of an inherent \"interprofessional hierarchy\" [9] guiding the interactive process and a deference to medical students, who are often the only group exposed to a PBL curriculum in their schooling [10] . As one social work participant noted, \"it seems like there is a natural inclination by the group to focus on the medical aspects because the medical students are most accustomed to this format\". Although these issues were not evaluated directly, several results and comments are worth noting, particularly with views expressed by the social workers. For example, although on average participants felt all viewpoints from across the represented disciplines were equally accepted, social workers were the most likely to disagree and also rated the benefits of the multidisciplinary setting lower than all other groups. One social work student had these comments:",
