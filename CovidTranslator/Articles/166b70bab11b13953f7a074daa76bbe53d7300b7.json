Significant effort has focused on the evaluation of rAAV delivery and the immune response in both murine and canine models of neuromuscular disease. However, canines provided for research purposes are routinely vaccinated against canine parvovirus (CPV). rAAV and CPV possess significant homology and are both parvoviruses. Thus, any immune response generated to CPV vaccination has the potential to cross-react with rAAV vectors. In this study, we investigated the immune response to rAAV6 delivery in a cohort of CPV-vaccinated canines and evaluated multiple vaccination regimens in a mouse model of CPV-vaccination. We show that CPV-vaccination stimulates production of neutralizing antibodies with minimal cross-reactivity to rAAV6. In addition, no significant differences were observed in the magnitude of the rAAV6-directed immune response between CPV-vaccinated animals and controls. Moreover, CPV-vaccination did not inhibit rAAV6-mediated transduction. We also evaluated the immune response to early rAAV6vaccination in neonatal mice. The influence of maternal hormones and cytokines leads to a relatively permissive state in the neonate. We hypothesized that immaturity of the immune system would permit induction of tolerance to rAAV6 when delivered during the neonatal period. Mice were vaccinated with rAAV6 at 1 or 5 days of age, and subsequently challenged with rAAV6 exposure during adulthood via two sequential IM injections, 1 month apart. All vaccinated animals generated a significant neutralizing antibody response to rAAV6vaccination that was enhanced following IM injection in adulthood. Taken together, these data demonstrate that the immune response raised against rAAV6 is distinct from that which is elicited by the standard parvoviral vaccines and is sufficient to prevent stable tolerization in neonatal mice.",

            "text": "Adeno-associated virus (AAV) is a non-enveloped, single-stranded DNA virus that is a member of the Parvovirus family. The AAV genome is approximately 5 kb in size and is packaged within an icosahedral capsid that facilitates viral entry into susceptible cells (Schultz and Chamberlain, 2008) . AAV-mediated gene transfer has been successfully demonstrated in numerous large and small animal models of human disease (Arnett et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2009) , and recombinant AAV (rAAV) vectors are thus considered a prime candidate for use in the development of gene replacement strategies. rAAV vectors are limited by their small carrying capacity, but possess several attractive features that are advantageous for use as therapeutic reagents, including a broad range of tissue tropism and lack of pathogenicity (Schultz and Chamberlain, 2008) . Over 12 serotypes and numerous variants of AAV have been identified. Each serotype has demonstrated a unique profile of tissue tropism that can be utilized to develop targeted therapies with enhanced tissue specificity (Zincarelli et al., 2008; Vandenberghe et al., 2009) . For example, rAAV2 exhibits a high tropism for liver and has been used to treat hemophilia B via expression of Factor IX (Manno et al., 2006) . rAAV6 has been shown to achieve a high level of transduction in both lung (Halbert et al., 2001 (Halbert et al., , 2007 and striated muscle Gregorevic et al., 2004 Gregorevic et al., , 2006 , and is thus being studied to develop treatments for diseases such as cystic fibrosis (Flotte et al., 2007; Halbert et al., 2007) , \u03b11-antitrypsin deficiency (Halbert et al., 2010) , and the muscular dystrophies (Arnett et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2009) .",

            "text": "Stable transgene expression in transduced cells can be harnessed to treat diseases resulting from genetic deficiencies. However, a significant obstacle to the use of viral vectors is the development of host immune responses to both the transgene and the vector Muruve, 2005, 2008; Nayak and Herzog, 2010) . The rAAV genome is one of the simplest of viral gene therapy vectors, containing only the transgene expression cassette flanked by non-coding viral inverted terminal repeats that facilitate packaging and capsid assembly (Samulski et al., 1982) . No viral genes are encoded within the engineered genome, which significantly reduces the risk of viral protein synthesis within the host and limits the potential immunogenicity of rAAV vectors. Initial studies regarding rAAV delivery have demonstrated the relative lack of a cell-mediated immune response to rAAV infection in na\u00efve animals (Athanasopoulos et al., 2004; Warrington and Herzog, 2006) . In contrast to adenovirus, rAAV does not efficiently trigger a strong, acute inflammatory response, resulting in inefficient activation of dendritic cells and other antigen presenting cells that influence a cytotoxic immune response (Zaiss and Muruve, 2005) . These and other factors are thought to contribute to sustained transgene expression in targeted tissues. However, despite promising results in animal studies, clinical trials of rAAV gene delivery in humans have failed to demonstrate the same level of success. Results from multiple studies indicate that capsid-specific humoral and cell-mediated immunity limit tissue transduction and lead to gradual clearance of transduced cells (Manno et al., 2006; Mingozzi and High, 2007; Mingozzi et al., 2009) . Thus, renewed effort is being made to understand and modulate factors governing the immune response to rAAV across multiple routes of delivery.",

            "text": "Evaluation of therapeutic constructs and delivery strategies in large animal models is a necessary step in the assessment of potential gene replacement therapies destined for clinical trials. In this regard, dogs can suitably model the physics and challenges of vector delivery to large volumes of tissue and model potential adverse reactions of an evolved mammalian immune system (Wang et al., 2009) . The immune response to rAAV in canines has been investigated in several studies (Mount et al., 2002; Wang et al., 2007a Wang et al., , 2010 Yuasa et al., 2007; Ohshima et al., 2009; Halbert et al., 2010; Haurigot et al., 2010) . We and others have previously evaluated rAAV delivery to striated muscle (Yuasa et al., 2007; Gregorevic et al., 2009; Ohshima et al., 2009) and have observed significant humoral and cell-mediated immunity utilizing a variety of rAAV serotypes (Wang et al., 2007a Yuasa et al., 2007; Ohshima et al., 2009 ). However, canines used for research purposes are routinely vaccinated against several potential pathogens, one of which is canine parvovirus (CPV). CPV infection is associated with high mortality in young puppies and is very contagious (Patel and Heldens, 2009) . High risk of CPV infection necessitates early vaccination in the majority of kennels. Like AAV, CPV is a member of the Parvovirus family and shares significant sequence identity with AAV and other family members. As follows, any immune response generated against CPV vaccination has the potential to cross-react with other members of the Parvovirus family, including AAV. Thus, it is important to consider the influence of CPV vaccine-related immunity on the rAAV-directed immune response in canines, as well as the influence of early exposure to virus and vaccine constituents in the maturing mammalian immune system. In this study, we investigate the immune response to rAAV6 delivery in CPV-vaccinated canines and evaluate multiple vaccination regimens in a mouse model of CPV-vaccination. In addition, we explore the influence of early rAAV6-vaccination on the immune response to repeat rAAV6-infection in adulthood.",

It is important to recognize that variation in vaccination regimens could influence the nature of the immune response, and it may not be appropriate to generalize results obtained from a single vaccination regimen in a relatively small cohort of animals. The above results from vaccinated beagles provide some insight regarding the immune response to CPV-vaccination and cross-reactivity to rAAV6. However, the study is limited by issues inherent to large animal models. Both ethical considerations and high cost necessitate the use of a small number of animals, and thus it is impractical to effectively assess multiple vaccination regimens in a canine model. In consideration of these factors, we continued the remainder of our vaccination studies in the mouse, which is more amenable to larger sample sizes. In addition, their smaller mass facilitates administration of a higher dose (per kilogram) of rAAV6 that can achieve body-wide transduction of skeletal muscle and is more relevant to therapeutic dosing levels. While significant differences exist between canine and murine immune systems, the mouse has been utilized extensively as a model system for the study of vaccination responses, autoimmunity, and other aspects of mammalian immunology. Thus, commonalities between the immune systems of both animal models predict FIGURE 2 | Western analysis of CPV vaccination and serum anti-AAV activity in canines.

            "text": "The immune system in young mammals is immature, and neonatal exposure to antigen does not always elicit the same type of immune response as in the adult (reviewed in Jaspan et al., 2006) . A diminished cytotoxic T cell response and the presence of circulating maternal antibodies can result in impaired induction of memory cells and persistent infection in newborns (Adkins et al., 2001) . In addition, a tolerogenic response to antigens can be initiated in neonates (Morein et al., 2007; Verhasselt, 2010a) , which could theoretically be harnessed to facilitate repeat administration of therapeutic vectors. Thus, it is possible that very early vaccination with rAAV6 could modulate the immune response to rAAV infection in a permissive manner. To investigate this prospect, we vaccinated mice with rAAV6 at either 1 or 5 days of age. Vector was delivered intraperitoneally at a dose of 1 \u00d7 10 11 vg per mouse ( Figure 5A) . Serum was collected 4 weeks post-vaccination and rAAV6 neutralization activity was quantified prior to IM injection of rAAV6-hPlAP (1 \u00d7 10 10 vg) in the left tibialis anterior (TA). Both cohorts of mice generated a significant neutralizing antibody response to neonatal rAAV6 vaccination ( Figure 5B) . However, neutralization activity in the Day 1 vaccination cohort was significantly lower compared to the Day 5 cohort. In addition, animals in the Day 1 cohort demonstrated a greater degree of individual variability in neutralization activity, which may be related to differences in immune system maturity and development between newborn and 5-day old mice. Interestingly, transduction of skeletal muscle was not significantly impacted by early vaccination in either cohort, despite the presence of circulating anti-rAAV6 antibodies ( Figure 5C) . These results suggest that the rAAV6-directed immune response initiated in vaccinated, neonatal mice may represent either a weak, ineffective primary immune response against re-infection or may instead be indicative of a tolerant response with the potential to remain permissive to viral infection upon rAAV6 re-exposure during adulthood.",

As shown above, rAAV6-vaccinated mice responded positively to the first IM injection of rAAV6, but it was important to determine whether this permissive state would persist through repeated exposure to rAAV6 during adulthood. To evaluate whether mice had developed a functional tolerance for rAAV6, both Day 1 and Day 5 cohorts were given an additional IM injection of 1 \u00d7 10 10 vg into the contralateral TA muscle. Serum was collected immediately prior to injection, and neutralization activity was quantified ( Figure 6A) . Both cohorts showed a strong neutralizing antibody response that was significantly enhanced when compared to the response obtained from the first bleed ( Figure 5B ). No significant difference in neutralization activity was observed between vaccinated animals and un-vaccinated controls. In addition, neutralization activity remained high even at more dilute serum concentrations, suggesting that the 4 week IM injection enhanced the rAAV6-directed immune response. Consistent with these observations, transduction in the contralateral TA was dramatically reduced and was limited to a small number of sparsely distributed muscle fibers ( Figure 6B) . These data indicate that rAAV6-vaccinated mice did not remain permissive to repeat infection and suggest that the success of the initial IM injection may be related to a weak primary immune response to rAAV6-vaccination, rather than induction of tolerance.",

Initial studies suggested a relative lack of immunogenicity of rAAV vectors, but the success achieved in animal models has not Frontiers in Microbiology | Microbial Immunology been mirrored in human trials. Significant immune responses to the vector have been observed following intravascular delivery of rAAV to liver and direct injection into skeletal muscle. Exposure to wild-type AAV is common within the human population, and the frequency of sero-positivity for AAV-directed neutralizing antibodies approaches nearly 30% for AAV2 (Mingozzi and High, 2007) . Pre-existing neutralizing antibodies to AAV have been shown to significantly inhibit transduction of hepatocytes in a clinical trial evaluating delivery of rAAV2 to hemophilia patients (Manno et al., 2006) . A similar humoral response has been observed in cystic fibrosis gene therapy trials involving repeat administration of rAAV2 (Flotte et al., 2007) . Disappointingly, the majority of clinical trials have resulted in the gradual loss of transgene expression. rAAV2-mediated delivery of human Factor IX (hFIX) to either skeletal muscle (Kay et al., 2000) or liver (Manno et al., 2006) resulted in therapeutic levels of hFIX in a subset of patients, but hFIX expression was eventually eliminated or reduced to non-therapeutic levels in all participants. In another clinical trial, rAAV1 was used to deliver lipoprotein lipase (LPL) via IM injection to patients with LPL-deficiency (Mingozzi et al., 2009) . Once again, transgene expression rose to effective levels for a relatively short period before gradually dropping below therapeutic threshold. In a clinical trial of rAAV1-mediated delivery of \u03b1-sarcoglycan, two out of three patients responded well to the treatment, whereas the third patient failed to demonstrate successful gene transfer (Mendell et al., 2010) . Extensive analysis of data generated from these clinical trials has indicated that both humoral and cell-mediated anti-capsid immune responses likely play a significant role in the elimination of transduced tissues (Manno et al., 2006; Mingozzi et al., 2009; Mendell et al., 2010) .",

Aspects of the canine immune response have mirrored findings in human clinical trials, including detection of a capsid-directed T cell response and gradual loss of transgene expression in non-immunosuppressed animals. Ohshima et al. (2009) observed a strong inflammatory response and T cell infiltration following delivery of rAAV2 or rAAV8 to skeletal muscle, though the magnitude of the inflammatory response was reduced in rAAV8-injected muscles. In addition, we have previously shown that injection of rAAV6 or rAAV1 in immunocompetent animals results in a similar sequence of events. An anti-capsid immune response led to local inflammation and clearance of the majority, but not all, transduced cells over a period of several weeks (Wang et al., 2007a . Loss of transgene expression was prevented by a short course of immunosuppression (Wang et al., 2007b ). An rAAV-directed immune response has also limited transgene expression in a canine model of \u03b11antitrypsin deficiency (Halbert et al., 2010) . These studies raise concerns regarding the immunogenicity of rAAV vectors and emphasize the need for careful evaluation of the potential immune response to rAAV delivery, especially in disorders that may require very high vector doses for systemic delivery, such as the muscular dystrophies.",

Antibody cross-reactivity has been demonstrated with closely related variants of AAV and between other related members of the Parvovirus family (Patel and Heldens, 2009 ). In addition, it has been shown that T cell receptors are reactive to epitopes that are conserved between different serotypes (Mingozzi and High, 2007; Mingozzi et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2010) , suggesting that a cell-mediated response may be more broadly reactive across a related group of viral vectors. Here, we observed a low level of neutralization activity in both mouse and canine models of CPV-vaccination at serum dilutions of 1:50 (Figures 1 and  3) . This activity was not measurable at more dilute serum concentrations, and Western analysis of serum from parvo-vaccinated and unvaccinated canines did not exhibit enhanced binding to rAAV particles (Figure 2) . These results may indicate the presence of anti-CPV antibodies that possess low, cross-reactive affinity for rAAV6. Cross-reactive antibodies with weak affinity for rAAV6 would require a higher concentration of neutralizing antibodies to achieve significant neutralization. At more dilute serum concentrations, inefficient binding of cross-reactive antibodies would significantly limit neutralization activity. Further characterization of the antibody response would be necessary to quantify affinity strength and identify common epitope targets before crossreactivity can be confirmed. However, it is important to emphasize that CPV-vaccination did not correlate with any significant inhibition of rAAV6 transduction (Figure 4 ), suggesting that a low level of neutralization activity may not play a role in generating a functionally significant rAAV6-directed immune response. In addition, we did not detect any significant inflammatory infiltration, nor did we observe any changes in muscle architecture that would be indicative of a cell-mediated, cytotoxic response (Figures 4A,B) .",

The regimens evaluated in this study are representative of the majority of vaccine components that are used by major manufacturers, and thus, our results are likely applicable to a wide selection of vaccines. However, it is possible that subtle differences in vaccines and vaccination schedules could influence the immune response.

The immune system in newborn mammals is under-developed, and significant differences exist in the pattern of T and B cell activation between newborns and adults. Newborns exhibit a generalized deficiency in adaptive cellular responses, with a bias toward prolonged Th2-type immunity (Adkins et al., 2001) . This observation has been attributed to the influence of maternal cytokines and hormones that promote maternal tolerance to fetal antigens. These cytokines persist in the fetal circulation and influence the neonatal immune response for a significant period after birth, leading to a relatively tolerogenic, and vulnerable state in the neonate (Morein et al., 2002) . In this regard, the newborn period represents a time when the immune system is learning to balance induction of tolerance to self antigens with appropriate reactive immunity to foreign pathogens. Thus, viral vectors delivered during this developmental window have the potential to initiate a tolerant immune response.",

Unfortunately, repetitive administration of identical serotypes has been ineffective in the majority of cases due to the development of a significant humoral immune response to rAAV vectors (Burger et al., 2004; Riviere et al., 2006; Sabatino et al., 2007; Petry et al., 2008) . It has been speculated that early vaccination with rAAV could stimulate a tolerant response to vector in the immature immune system and thus permit re-administration in adulthood. In this regard, previous studies have investigated the response to in utero adenoviral (Lipshutz et al., 2000; Bouchard et al., 2003) or AAV (Jerebtsova Frontiers in Microbiology | Microbial Immunology et al., 2002; Bouchard et al., 2003; Sabatino et al., 2007) vaccination in mice. These studies were limited to IM injection of rAAV serotypes 1, 2, and 5, and did not evaluate rAAV6. Considering that serotype-specific transduction profiles, dosage, and the route of administration can significantly influence the immune response to viral vectors (Mingozzi and High, 2007; Petry et al., 2008; Zaiss and Muruve, 2008) , it is important to empirically determine the immune response rAAV6 vaccination.",

The neutralizing antibody response to the initial IP vaccination did not inhibit transduction during the first IM injection at 4 weeks of age. However, animals did not remain permissive to rAAV6 transduction. On the contrary, neutralization activity was significantly enhanced following the first IM injection, resulting in near-complete inhibition of transduction during the second IM injection. These results suggest that the initial vaccination triggered a weak primary immune response, which led to an enhanced secondary reaction to the first IM injection. However, without a more detailed characterization of the antibody response, we cannot rule out the existence of partial tolerance to specific viral epitopes. These findings are consistent with those previously observed following in utero delivery of rAAV1 and rAAV2 (Jerebtsova et al., 2002; Sabatino et al., 2007) and indicate that neonatal IP injection of rAAV6 does not facilitate repetitive administration of vector beyond a single, repeat injection.",

These data suggest that CPVimmunity is not a significant component of the rAAV6-directed immune response in canines, and support the use of canines as a valid model for further characterization of the immune response to rAAV6. In contrast, vaccination with rAAV6 in neonatal mice leads to a significant immune response that prevents repetitive administration of rAAV6.
