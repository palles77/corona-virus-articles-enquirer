A complete physical examination with careful attention to the head and neck should be performed, including ocular retropulsion. Firm resistance to retropulsion of the orbit or a painful reaction could be indicative of a retrobulbar lesion. Otic examination should be completed to evaluate for bulging or discoloration of the tympanum; these changes commonly occur with nasopharyngeal polyps. Deformation of the nose or face, exophthalmia, or pain neoplasia, oronasal fistula, and occasionally chronic foreign bodies. Vasculitis occurs in dogs with diseases such as ehrlichiosis and bartonellosis but is rare in cats. Unilateral nasal discharge is more likely with foreign bodies, oronasal fistula, and neoplasia, although the latter can become bilateral as it progresses. Bilateral discharge is nonspecific and can be found with almost any etiology. 33 Sneezing is a superficial reflex that originates in the mucous membranes lining the nasal cavity and is easily induced by chemical or mechanical stimuli. The sneeze results in forceful expulsion of air that passes through lymphoma, metastatic neoplasia, and fungal agents. Bacterial culture and antimicrobial susceptibility testing on nasal discharges are generally not recommended because results are difficult to interpret in that they typically yield normal intranasal bacterial flora. 43 However, in respiratory outbreaks in catteries, pet stores, shelters, and multicat households, culture may be indicated to determine whether a pathogenic Bordetella bronchiseptica isolate is present.",

However, cats can be asymptomatic carriers of these agents, and the FHV-1, FCV, B. bronchiseptica, and C. felis assays also amplify vaccine strains of the organisms, which means that positive results do not prove a disease association. This is especially true for FHV-1 and FCV, which may have a relatively high prevalence in the healthy cat population. 52, 78, 98 Recently, a study failed to link Bartonella spp. infection to rhinitis in cats; therefore at this time recommendations to perform Bartonella spp. serology, culture, or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays in cats with upper respiratory tract signs are controversial. 6 If a clinician chooses to test for evidence of Bartonella spp. infection, the cat should be evaluated by serology and PCR or culture because serology alone has been shown to yield false-negative results in up to 15% of infected cats. 8 In addition, because only approximately 40% of seropositive cats are currently infected, a positive serologic test result does not prove bartonellosis. 8 See Chapter 33 and the subsequent sections in this chapter about individual agents for a further discussion of molecular assays.",

In general, results of the CBC are of low yield but may reveal eosinophilia in some cats with fungal or allergic disease, thrombocytopenia in some cats with epistaxis, or other cytopenias that might accompany feline leukemia (FeLV) or feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) infections. FeLV and FIV do not cause sneezing and nasal discharge primarily, but they have been associated with lymphoma and may induce immunodeficiency that predisposes to other infections; therefore testing for these agents is indicated. A Cryptococcus antigen test is also recommended as a preliminary test for any cat with chronic nasal discharge, but particularly for those with nasal deformation, lymphadenopathy, or retinal lesions. 59 Although thoracic radiographs are generally normal, they are still indicated to rule out pulmonary involvement of fungal disease and metastatic neoplasia. In cats with epistaxis, blood pressure measurement, coagulation profile, and buccal mucosal bleeding test are recommended, and thromboelastography may also be useful. on palpation of the nasal or facial bones is most consistent with fungal disease or neoplasia. 1 Oral examination should be performed to assess for dental disease that could be causing an oronasal fistula, gingivostomatitis that could be consistent with feline herpesvirus (FHV-1) or feline calicivirus (FCV) infections, and defects in the hard or soft palate. External ocular examination may reveal conjunctivitis that could indicate FHV-1, FCV, Mycoplasma spp., or Chlamydophila felis infections. Fundic examination is performed to evaluate for lesions consistent with lymphoma or Cryptococcus neoformans infection. A cold microscope slide can be placed in front of the nose to assess airflow and may aid in determining if disease is unilateral or bilateral, although this should not limit diagnostic investigation to the obstructive side of the nose because bilateral disease may be present.",

If radiographs are performed, anesthesia is required for accurate positioning and should include a lateral view, ventrodorsal view, and intraoral and open-mouth bullae views. Nasal imaging can reveal increased density in the nasal cavity or bony lysis that could be consistent with a mass, turbinate destruction consistent with chronic rhinosinusitis or fungal disease, as well as radio-opaque foreign objects or tooth root abscessation. 44, 69 Although more expensive and not widely available, a CT scan has the added advantage of better visualization of the sinuses and tympanic bullae and better assessment of bony lysis; it also allows assessment of the cribriform plate and brain so that the extent of a lesion can be evaluated 86 ( Figure 30 -2). It is also faster to perform than a full series of skull radiographs and allows for radiotherapy treatment planning if indicated. It is the preferred imaging pressure. In cats lavaging should be performed from the anterior nares caudally. Gauze should be placed in the oropharyngeal area and then a 20-, 35-, or 60-mL syringe can be used to forcefully flush saline through the nose while the nares are being pinched off to create pressure ( Figure 30-4) . Material flushed from the nose (or oropharynx) should be caught on the gauze and examined for foreign objects. If no foreign material is located, biopsies are then made using a bone curette or the largest biopsy instrument that can be passed through the nares. Most rigid endoscopes are too large for the biopsy sleeve to be used in many cats; a gastroscopic biopsy instrument can often be passed next to the camera of a rigid scope to perform directed biopsies. Alternatively, the biopsy site can be directed by the results of diagnostic imaging or by rhinoscopy. If indicated, bacterial and fungal cultures are made using material from flush or biopsied tissues. 39",

In general, there is also no added benefit to debulking nasal tumors before chemotherapy (e.g., lymphoma) or radiation therapy. Although turbinate tissue can be removed to increase airflow through the modality, especially if a mass is suspected. Imaging should be performed before rhinoscopy and biopsy to prevent hemorrhage from obscuring details in the nasal passages.",

However, should a mass be present, rhinoscopy does not allow assessment of the extent of bony lysis (hence the importance of additional imaging). In addition, because gross appearance of the nasal mucosa on rhinoscopy does not always correlate with histopathologic diagnosis, biopsies should always be performed. 37 If no foreign material is visualized on rhinoscopy, the nasal cavity is flushed with sterile saline to evaluate for the presence of hidden material. The cuff of the endotracheal tube should be checked for full inflation before performing nasal lavage with saline administered under nasal cavities, bacterial osteomyelitis is often present as well as nasal discharge, so this procedure is generally not recommended for cats with chronic inflammatory rhinitis.",

            "text": "Nasopharyngeal polyps are non-neoplastic, inflammatory nodules that occur most commonly in young cats. They originate in the middle ear or auditory canal and can grow out through the nasopharynx or, alternatively, the tympanum. 34, 40 Why the growths occur is unknown, but because they tend to occur when the cat is young, a congenital etiology has been postulated. 2 The possible association of polyps with infectious agents has also been explored, including FHV-1, FCV, C. felis, Mycoplasma spp., and Bartonella spp., 41, 108 but to date no organism has definitely been proven to be a cause. Large polyps can be detected by palpation through the soft palate, and otic examination may reveal discoloration or bulging of the tympanum. When extending into the nasopharynx, polyps disrupt the normal flow of secretions, resulting in secondary bacterial infections, mucopurulent nasal discharge, stertorous breathing, and gagging. Signs of middle ear involvement, such as Horner's syndrome and head tilt, can also be seen. Diagnosis can be confirmed with examination of the nasopharynx under sedation with a dental mirror and spay hook or rhinoscope, as previously described. A bulla radiography series or CT scan should be performed to determine whether there is bulla involvement. However, if there is no evidence of middle ear-associated clinical disease and the polyp can be removed by way of the mouth, many clinicians will perform removal using traction and wait for a recurrence before performing a bulla osteotomy on account of the high incidence of morbidity associated with bulla osteotomy 40, 108 . Complications of this procedure include Horner's syndrome, facial nerve paralysis, and discomfort, and the recovery period is similar to that for a relatively invasive surgery. Without bulla osteotomy approximately 30% will be recurrent. 108 However, combining removal by traction with a tapering course of glucocorticoids (1 to 2 mg/kg per day, by mouth, for 14 days followed by a taper dosage over the next 2 weeks) may improve the success rate. 64 Bulla osteotomy is an effective surgical treatment, and when it is performed at initial presentation or at recurrence, most cases generally experience complete resolution. 40, 103, 108 Brachycephalic Syndrome",

In another study different organisms were isolated from each collection technique, so it may be most complete to culture both nasal flush and biopsy samples. 38 However, it should be remembered that positive culture results may not correlate with the cause of the disease on account of the presence of normal flora and other superficial bacteria.",

Many cats have antibodies against B. bronchiseptica, the organism is commonly cultured from cats in crowded environments, and there are sporadic reports of severe lower respiratory disease caused by bordetellosis in kittens and cats in crowded environments or other stressful situations. 7, 110 The organism was cultured on necropsy from the lower airways of several cats from shelters in Colorado, and in one shelter the organism was cultured from 19 of 40 cats (47.5%) with upper respiratory disease. 91 However, the significance of infection in otherwise healthy pet cats appears to be minimal. For example, in client-owned cats in north central Colorado, the organism was rarely cultured from cats with rhinitis or lower respiratory disease (approximately 3%). 109 B. bronchiseptica is easily grown, and culture is superior to PCR for this agent because antimicrobial susceptibility testing can be performed on isolates. Because the organism is not usually eliminated by treatment, follow-up culture or PCR assay after treatment has minimal benefit. 9 C. felis is a common differential diagnosis for cats with clinical evidence of conjunctivitis and rhinitis; it is not a common cause of lower airway disease. The organism is difficult to culture, so PCR detection of microbial DNA from conjunctival swabs can be useful clinically. Because of the intracellular nature of the organism, adequate cellular material must be obtained from the conjunctival swab for analysis. 28 PCR assay results can be used to prove a cattery has been cleared of the infection after treatment. 95 Most, but not all, PCR-positive cats are clinically ill (e.g., 3.3% if healthy cats were positive in one study). 13 Mycoplasma spp. are normal commensal organisms of the mucous membranes of multiple species, including cats. M. felis has been associated primarily with conjunctivitis but is suspected as a primary cause of rhinitis in cats as well. 31, 38, 39 There are multiple Mycoplasma spp. of cats, and the pathogenic potential for most is unknown. If other primary diseases are present, even nonpathogenic Mycoplasma spp. may be associated with the disease process. Mycoplasma spp. culture can be difficult and takes longer than routine culture, and antimicrobial susceptibility is not provided by most laboratories. Culture of nasal biopsy samples rather than nasal flush samples may increase yield. 39 Mycoplasma spp. PCR assays have at least some clinical utility, with some assays allowing for speciation, which is helpful in assessing the pathogenic potential of the organism. However, because Mycoplasma spp. are common flora, the PPV of the assays is likely to be low.

            "text": "If primary bacterial infections are suspected, doxycycline 10 mg/kg, administered orally once daily for cats with rhinitis with or without conjunctivitis, is usually effective (Table 30-1) . Doxycycline is the treatment of choice for B. bronchiseptica, Mycoplasma spp., and C. felis infections, 19, 28 and in the last has been shown to be superior to topical administration of tetracycline. 90 Sideeffects in young kittens are less of a concern with doxycycline than tetracycline but should still be taken into consideration. Amoxicillin-clavulanate is a good choice in young animals and is effective for most organisms, with the exception of Mycoplasma spp. because these organisms lack a cell wall. Pradofloxacin has been shown to have efficacy against Mycoplasma spp. 16, 31 Enrofloxacin has also been shown to be effective for C. felis 23 but should be used with caution in young cats because of possible adverse effects on cartilage. Although the drug has not been shown to damage chondrocytes in cats, this does occur in several other species. Clindamycin penetrates bone and tissues well and has an excellent anaerobic spectrum. Administering the liquid form of this drug is generally well tolerated if given cold. Azithromycin therapy (15 mg/kg, administered orally once daily) can be tried for cats with suspected resistant bacterial infections.* Doxycycline and clindamycin have been associated with esophagitis and esophageal strictures in cats 4, 24, 61 because of the poor secondary esophageal contractions in this species. The authors recommend never administering dry pills or capsules to cats. Drugs should be compounded into a liquid, administered, and then followed with a 3-to 6-mL liquid bolus or food, administered coated with butter or a product such as Nutri-Cal, or administered in a pill-delivery treat. 27, 50, 111 Cats with acute disease are treated for 7 to 10 days, except for C. felis, in which 28 days of therapy is needed to eliminate infection. 31 10, 36, 72, 87, 105 VS-FCV strains arise spontaneously from endogenous FCV strains, and outbreaks have resolved quickly after the initial cases were recognized. Currently, it is unknown how often these outbreaks occur and whether the number of outbreaks is increasing. The VS-FCV strains evaluated to date have been genetically and antigenically diverse. 42, 71 Virus isolation can be used to document current infection but takes at least several days for results and is not performed by all laboratories. Because of widespread exposure and vaccination, the PPV of serologic tests is poor. Reverse transcriptase (RT) PCR assays can be used to amplify the RNA of calicivirus, and results can be made available quickly. However, these assays also amplify vaccine strains of FCV (Lappin MR: unpublished data, 2010). FCV RNA can be amplified from samples collected from normal carrier cats as well as clinically ill cats, and PCR assays therefore have poor PPV. In addition, amplification of FCV RNA cannot be used to prove virulent systemic calicivirus infection. 78 False-negative results of FCV RT-PCR can also occur if inadequate RNA is present on the submitted swab or if the organism has been cleared to levels below the sensitivity limits of the assay by specific immune responses. Because treatment does not eliminate FCV infection, there is no benefit to follow-up culture or RT-PCR testing.",

            "text": "The most common viruses associated with feline respiratory disease are FCV and FHV-1. Both viruses are extremely common in cats, particularly those from crowded environments such as pet stores, catteries, and shelters. 14, 32 There are many strains of FCV, and mutations resulting in new strains are common. This organism is a common differential diagnosis for cats with clinical evidence of rhinitis, stomatitis, oral ulceration, and conjunctivitis ( Figure 30-6 ). Less commonly, FCV is associated with polyarthritis, lower airway disease in and not RNA viruses such as FCV, because they interfere with viral DNA synthesis and thus viral replication. Acyclovir and valacyclovir have been administered to some cats but can induce bone marrow suppression and are minimally effective for FHV-1; therefore they should no longer be used. 51, 66 Famciclovir is safe and effective and is used for both acute and long-term therapy for cats with FHV-1 infections. One dose that has been used with apparent clinical efficacy is 62.5 mg, orally, every 12 hours for 14 days. 58 However, recent pharmacokinetic studies indicate that higher doses may be needed for activity against FHV-1. 99 Idoxuridine and trifluridine have been used topically in cats with conjunctivitis or keratitis resulting from FHV-1 infection, but these must be administered multiple times per day and are irritating. Recently, cidofovir was used in a small experimental FHV-1 conjunctivitis study and was shown to lessen clinical signs and FHV-1 shedding. 21 Lysine at 250 to 500 mg, orally, every 12 hours may be helpful in some cats with acute or chronic rhinosinusitis caused by FHV-1 infection (not FCV). 53 However, in several controlled studies of cats fed a lysine-fortified diet, a significant positive effect was not noted. 17, 55, 80 Intranasal administration of modified live FHV-1 and FCV vaccines may lessen disease in some chronically infected cats, but controlled data are lacking. If there is a positive response to intranasal vaccination in a cat with chronic disease, this form of immunotherapy can be administered up to three times per year. Intranasal vaccination has been shown to potentiate cell-mediated immunity to FHV-1 better than parenteral vaccination. 48 Chronic administration of one commercially available probiotic (FortiFlora, Purina Veterinary Diets) was shown to enhance T-helper lymphocyte numbers in cats. 106 When this probiotic was administered to cats with chronic FHV-1 infections that were then subjected to mild stress, improved conjunctivitis scores were noted in some of the cats in the treatment group. 47 See the section on chronic rhinosinusitis for a discussion of other nonspecific therapies.",

However, because from conjunctival cells of approximately 20% of healthy cats; therefore the PPV of PCR assays for this agent is low. 79 Currently used PCR assays also detect vaccine strains of FHV-1, further lessening the PPV. 52 Quantitative PCR may ultimately prove to correlate with the presence or absence of disease but failed to correlate to presence of conjunctivitis in one small study in the authors' laboratory. 49 The negative predictive value of the FHV-1 PCR assays is also in question because many cats that are likely to have FHV-1-associated disease are PCR negative. This may relate to clearance of FHV-1 DNA from tissues by the immune reaction. Tissue biopsies have greater sensitivity than conjunctival swabs but do not necessarily have greater predictive value. 93 FHV-1 DNA can be amplified from the aqueous humor of some cats, but whether this indicates FHV-1-associated uveitis is unknown. 54 Because treatment does not eliminate FHV-1 infection, there is no benefit to follow-up culture or PCR testing.",

There may also be effects against chronic FHV-1 or FCV infections, but controlled data are not available. Topical administration of alpha interferon in saline to the eyes of cats with conjunctivitis or the nose has been recommended by some veterinarians as an aid in the management of some cats with acute or chronic FHV-1 or FCV infections.",

Nephrotoxicity is the most serious side effect, and an initial infusion dose of 0.1 mg/kg is used as a test dose. The dose can be slowly increased to 0.5 mg/ kg if it is well tolerated clinically and if renal values remain stable. 26, 56 A successful subcutaneous protocol has also been described in which 0.5 to 0.8 mg/kg is added to 0.45% saline/2.5% dextrose, and the total volume is given two to three times weekly to a cumulative dose of 8 to 26 mg/kg. 56, 67 In addition to the deoxycholate form of amphotericin B, a liposomal formulation is also available.

Additionally, these vaccine side effects may influence case management of kittens housed in shelters or humane societies. Subcutaneous vaccines are recommended if concerns about the respiratory side effects of intranasal vaccines exist. Currently, yearly revaccination for cats in high-risk environments (e.g., shelters, catteries, multicat household) and a 3-year revaccination interval for cats in low-risk environments (indoor-only with no contact with other cats) are recommended. 78, 81, 98 Inactivated vaccines containing VS-FCV are now available (Calicivax, Boehringer Ingelheim Vetmedica).

Responses have varied among studies, but good to excellent treatment responses are often achieved in cats administered fluconazole or itraconazole. 60, 67 Because of toxicity and the availability of more efficacious drugs, ketoconazole is no longer recommended by these authors. Fluconazole at 50 mg per cat, orally, once or twice daily is recommended because it results in the fewest side effects, has the best penetration across the blood-brain and blood-ocular barriers of the azoles, and presence of latent FHV-1 viral infections that are triggered into recrudescence by stressful events. In such cats with a prior history of viral infection, therapies such as lysine, antivirals, and immunomodulators are often tried, as previously discussed. Subjective improvement in clinical signs has been noted in response to cationic liposome DNA complexes (CLDC) immunomodulatory therapy in a small pilot study currently under way at Colorado State University, as well as in a previously published study. 107 Stress is thought to play a role in the clinical severity and potential for recurrence of chronic viral rhinosinusitis, particularly if FHV-1 latency or chronic FCV infections are involved. Environmental measures to decrease stress, allocate resources in multicat households, and provide antianxiety therapies such as feline facial pheromone use (Feliway, Ceva Animal Health) may also provide some benefit. Controversy surrounds the use of immunosuppressive therapy in these patients: It may not be beneficial and runs the risk of exacerbating viral and bacterial components of the disease syndrome.",

Administration of antihistamines such as chlorpheniramine at 1 to 2 mg, orally, every 12 hours may lessen clinical signs of disease in some cats. Several newer antihistamines are now available (see Table 30 -1), and because response to therapy is variable from patient to patient, an alternative drug should be tried if no improvement is seen with the initial choice.

Individual patients will respond variably to this approach. Prednisolone may be used at a maximum dose of 1 to 2 mg/kg, orally, every 12 hours. If a positive response is noted, the lowest dose and the longest dosing interval that is effective should be determined by adjusting the dose over time. Inhaled glucocorticoids can be used as an alternative to decrease the systemic side effects of oral glucocorticoid use and have the benefit of directly affecting the nasal mucosa. Beclomethasone or fluticasone can be administered by metered dose inhaler (MDI) with an inhalation chamber at 1 to 2 puffs once to twice daily. Resistant cases may respond to administration of cyclosporine at up to 7.5 mg/kg, orally, daily or every other day, but controlled data are lacking. Trough blood levels should be checked 2 weeks after initiation of therapy to ensure that involvement, such as exophthalmos and ocular discharge, can be seen in addition to nasal signs. Diagnosis of aspergillosis is based on visualization of fungal plaques on rhinoscopy or fungal hyphae on cytology or biopsy. Infection can be caused by either Aspergillus spp. or Penicillium spp., which can be difficult to differentiate cytologically. Fungal culture seems less sensitive and specific than visualization on rhinoscopy or biopsy. 112 Therapy with oral itraconazole and fluconazole has been documented as 50% to 60% efficacious, 102, 112 and better efficacy with nasal clotrimazole therapy has been reported in a few cases. 102",

Continuous positive airway pressure may be helpful in managing acute cases when intubation is not possible. 100 When possible, depending on the stability of the patient, cervical and thoracic radiographs are helpful for ruling out other causes of dyspnea. In a recent study 60% of cats with laryngeal paralysis had evidence of upper airway obstruction on radiographs. Findings included lung hyperinflation; caudal displacement of the larynx; and air in the larynx, pharynx, esophagus, and stomach. 84 Insofar as laryngeal paralysis is a functional disease, laryngeal examination provides a definitive diagnosis. In one study 75% of cats examined had bilateral disease. 84 In this study medical management was instituted for cats with unilateral disease with good outcome. Surgical management with arytenoid lateralization is reported to be variably successful (50% to 70%) for cats with laryngeal paralysis and is more commonly recommended in cats with bilateral disease.

Bronchoscopy allows examination of patency, color, and character of mucosa; presence and character of secretions; and presence and location of masses or foreign bodies. A major limitation of feline bronchoscopy is the requirement for very narrow bronchoscopes (2.5 to 3.8 mm outer diameter). Even with such narrow scopes, the airways are mostly occluded, requiring intravenous anesthesia for maintenance as well as induction. Oxygen can be supplied through jet ventilation or an oxygen cannula passed adjacent to the scope. In one study of bronchoscopy in 68 cats, complications resulted in approximately one third of cases (26 of 68 cats). In most cases the complications were mild, but in six cases they were serious, with death resulting in four cats.

The hindquarters of the cat can be elevated to facilitate aspiration, and gentle coupage of the chest wall may also be helpful. The presence of foam in the aspirated fluid indicates surfactant and a successful deep alveolar lavage. The volume of saline retrieved is typically less than half of what was instilled. If an inadequate volume is retrieved, a second aliquot can be instilled and the procedure repeated. Typically a total volume of 5 to 10 mL sterile saline is required to retrieve adequate samples, although total volumes of up to 60 mL have been described in cats. 7. The red rubber feeding tube or catheter is removed from the endotracheal tube, and supplemental oxygen is provided until the cat is ready for extubation. Elevating the hindquarters and providing gentle coupage can assist in clearance of remaining fluid from the airways.

            "text": "Radiography is a vital aspect in diagnosis of lower airway disease but cannot provide a definitive diagnosis of the cause of bronchial disease. The radiographic finding of a bronchial pattern helps guide the clinician to determine the cause; however, the absence of such a pattern does not rule out bronchial diseases. Cats with bronchial diseases can have a variety of radiographic findings, including no abnormalities. 45 One recent study assessed the radiographic findings of 40 cats with bronchial disease; 37 of 40 cats (92.5%) had a bronchial pattern, but a large number of these cats also had an unstructured interstitial pattern (30 of 40 cats). Nonspecific respiratory signs were also prominent, with lung hyperinflation (31 of 40), hyperlucency (21 of 40), and aerophagia (19 of 40) recognized. Further, lung soft tissue opacities were seen in 11 of 40 cats. This study also found variation in interobserver interpretation; however, there was disagreement in only 2 of 24 cases with severe bronchial disease. 83 These findings are similar to one other study in which Foster and coworkers 75 found a bronchial or mixed bronchial pattern in 20 of 22 cats (91%). Adamama-Moraitou and coworkers 2 recognized a bronchial pattern in 16 of 22 cats (73%), whereas Corcoran and coworkers 45 found a bronchial or mixed bronchial-interstitial pattern to be less consistent, occurring in only 17 of 29 cats (59%). Moise and coworkers 188 used a bronchial pattern as part of the inclusion criteria but found that 46% also had an airway inflammation is believed to be instigated by antigenic or allergic stimulation causing activation of a T-Helper 2 (T h 2) response. A T h 2 response instigates secretion of interleukins (IL) 4, 5, and 13, and this cascade results in recruitment of and subsequent degranulation of eosinophils. Degranulation of eosinophils results in damage and destruction of the epithelial lining of the airways. 73, 201 Cats with predominantly neutrophilic inflammation may have similar toxic damage with subsequent repair processes. 121 The consequences of these responses are metaplasia and proliferation of airway epithelium, hyperplasia of mucous glands with production of excess mucus, hypertrophy and hyperplasia of airway smooth muscle, and distal emphysematous changes in the pulmonary parenchyma. Hyperresponsiveness of airway smooth muscle results in airway constriction in response to nonspecific stimuli such as airway irritants, allergens, parasites, and viral particles. 121 Experimental models in which cats are first sensitized and then challenged with Bermuda grass antigen, house dust mite antigen, or pig roundworm (Ascaris suum) have been developed. These models have resulted in not only the clinical signs but also the airway hyperreactivity, typical airway cytology, and histologic lesions that are recognized in cats with naturally occurring bronchial disease. 133, 201 ",

Cats presenting with severe respiratory distress should have only a cursory initial examination, during which the clinician's aim is to determine if the clinical signs are from LRT disease or pleural effusion. Radiographs in the position most comfortable for the cat may be required to help make this distinction. Oxygen therapy should be instituted as soon as practicable, and a bronchodilator such as terbutaline (0.01 mg/kg subcutaneously) administered if bronchial disease is suspected. At the other extreme, some cats have no specific abnormalities present. In all but emergency situations, it is ideal to observe the cat before handling to watch for tachypnea and any signs of increased or prolonged expiratory proportions from less than 10% to 35% to 45%. 145, 201 The proportions of inflammatory cells found in wash cytology are not always mentioned in clinical reports, but in one study all eosinophilic exudates comprised more than 60% eosinophils, 75 and another noted that mixed cell exudates contained 30% to 50% eosinophils. 188 Although a mean of 25% eosinophils was found in one population of healthy cats, 211 it could be expected that 25% eosinophils from a wash of 1500 to 3000 nucleated cells/\u00b5L would have greater significance than the same proportion found in a wash of only 200 to 300 cells/\u00b5L. A large proportion of eosinophils may also reflect other conditions, such as parasitism, which must be ruled out. When the neutrophil population is elevated, the distinction of inflammatory disease from infection must be made. As well as the expectation of a positive culture result (from bacterial infection), the neutrophils associated with infection can be expected to show toxic, degenerative changes, whereas nondegenerate neutrophils resembling those of normal peripheral blood would be expected with inflammatory, noninfectious disease.",

The clinician's primary aim should be to distinguish LRT disease from pleural effusion or pulmonary edema; to this end, survey radiographs should be taken in the position most comfortable for the cat (usually dorsoventrally, with the cat supported by its elbows) after the patient has been stabilized as much as possible. It is appropriate to provide the cat with an oxygen-rich environment; details of supplementary oxygen-delivery techniques can be found in Box 30-5 later in the chapter. A bronchodilator such as terbutaline should be administered at 0.01 mg/kg parenterally. A response is usually seen in 10 to 30 minutes. The response to terbutaline alone can aid in the diagnosis of bronchoconstriction as the cause of respiratory distress. Terbutaline can be readministered 30 minutes later at the same dose if minimal effect has been noted. An alternative is to administer salbutamol-albuterol using an MDI (discussed later). The typical dose is 2 actuations every 30 minutes as needed. The drug takes effect rapidly with improvement in clinical signs seen in less than 5 minutes. If oxygen therapy and bronchodilation do not substantially reduce respiratory rate and effort, corticosteroids such as dexamethasone sodium phosphate (0.2 to 1 mg/kg, intravenously or intramuscularly) can be administered. Failure mouthpiece, whereas in other countries, they are labeled by the amount of drug delivered from the valve, which accounts for what appears to be different strengths of the same product. Inhaled fluticasone at doses of 44 \u00b5g every 12 hours and 110 \u00b5g every 12 hours was found to be effective in ameliorating signs and reducing inflammation in experimentally induced eosinophilic airway inflammation. 40 Further, 220 \u00b5g of inhaled fluticasone every 24 hours reduced the inflammatory response in cats with neutrophilic airway inflammation (but no clinical signs). 135 Each MDI delivers a set dose per actuation (a \"puff\"), and each container has a fixed number of doses. For MDIs that do not include a dose-counting mechanism, the owner must keep track of the doses used so that an empty container is not used. MDIs require slow, deep inhalation on the part of the patient. This type of inspiration is not possible for animals and infants, so a spacer and face mask must be used. Spacers decrease the amount of drug deposited in the oropharynx. A spacer and face mask of appropriate size for cats should be used (e.g., AeroKat, Trudell Medical International). To administer the medication, the MDI is shaken to open an internal valve in the canister and is then attached to the spacer. If the spacer does not contain a valve, the spacer and mask should be applied to the cat's face before the MDI is actuated. The MDI is then actuated to deliver the drug into the spacer and the owner should observe the cat take 7 to 10 breaths to ensure that the drug has been inhaled. The AeroKat system has an indicator valve that makes it easier for the owner to tell when the cat takes a breath. If a patient is receiving both an inhaled bronchodilator and corticosteroid, the bronchodilator should be administered first and the corticosteroid 5 to 10 minutes later. The owner should follow the manufacturer's instructions for cleaning and maintenance of the mask and spacer system.",

One study has shown that prednisolone administered at 5 mg/cat every 12 hours orally for 2 weeks resulted in a significantly lower percentage of eosinophils (mean = 5%) in BAL cytology compared with a control substance (mean eosinophils = 33.7%). 226 Typical recommendations are for prednisolone to be administered at 1 to 2 mg/kg every 12 hours for 5 to 10 days before tapering the dose over at least 2 months (e.g., reducing at weekly intervals until 0.5 mg/kg every second day). 121, 208 Treatment with injectable long-acting corticosteroids (e.g., methylprednisolone acetate, 10 to 20 mg/cat, intramuscularly every 4 to 8 weeks) is the least desirable approach and should be reserved for patients for which no other method of drug administration is possible.

Inhalational delivery of corticosteroids by use of MDI allows for local antiinflammatory activity while minimizing systemic absorption and the potential adverse effects that may arise. Systemic absorption of inhaled medications still occurs with some drugs; one study demonstrated hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPAA) suppression in healthy cats receiving 250 \u00b5g flunisolide every 12 hours, 223 but another study of cats receiving 220 \u00b5g fluticasone every 12 hours showed no suppression. 40 Research using nebulized radiopharmaceutical agents has demonstrated that inhaled medications delivered using a face mask and spacer can be distributed throughout the lung fields of cats. 242 The most commonly used inhaled corticosteroid is fluticasone, although others are sometimes available (e.g., beclomethasone) and may be less expensive (but potentially less effective). Fluticasone has the longest half-life of the available inhalant corticosteroids, is the most potent, and is the least likely to be absorbed systemically. 205 The drug is available in three strengths per actuation, with the labeling varying by country: 44 or 50 \u00b5g, 110 or 125 \u00b5g, and 220 or 250 \u00b5g. In the United States, MDIs are labeled by the amount of drug delivered at the Avoidance of oral corticosteroids may be important for certain patients with concurrent diseases, such as diabetes mellitus or herpesvirus infection. In one series of 300 cases, 206 80% of 246 cats with mild to moderate disease were weaned from oral corticosteroids and maintained on inhaled fluticasone alone. Of 54 cats with severe disease, 63% were weaned from oral corticosteroids and maintained on inhaled fluticasone. The remaining cats were maintained on a combination of oral and inhaled corticosteroids, but in most cases with a lower oral dose than if inhaled medication was not used. About 85% of owners were able to use a mask and spacer system effectively, and the rate of adverse effects was low, such as 5% of cats with ocular irritation.",

Diagnosis depends on histopathologic examination of affected lung tissue; either performed ante mortem by thoracotomy or thorascopic biopsy but usually at necropsy. The characteristic histopathologic finding is interstitial fibrosis with fibroblast or myofibroblast foci, honeycombing with alveolar interstitial smooth muscle metaplasia. Interstitial inflammation is not a prominent feature. As in people, coincident neoplasia may be present. 41, 286 CT has been used to diagnose idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis presumptively in people with an accuracy of approximately 90%; the key feature is cystic dilation of air spaces leading to peripheral honeycombing. Although this has not been described in cats, it may serve as a useful diagnostic aid. 130 There is no known effective treatment. Corticosteroids (e.g., prednisolone at 10 mg/cat, orally every 24 hours) and bronchodilators (e.g., terbutaline) appear to help some cats but have no beneficial effect in many.

The extent of damage depends on the frequency, volume, and character of the aspirated material, as well as the effectiveness of host defense mechanisms. Defense mechanisms include airway closure during swallowing; cough reflex; mucociliary transport apparatus; and pulmonary cellular defenses, which minimize the degree of damage when minimal amounts of material are aspirated. 265 Aspiration pneumonia is a potential consequence in cats with esophageal or swallowing disorders, including those that are anesthetized, comatose, or otherwise debilitated. Gastric contents are acidic and therefore result in chemical pneumonitis that can cause necrosis of bronchial and alveolar epithelium, as well as pulmonary edema. Supportive care with oxygen therapy is appropriate, and treatment for pulmonary edema may be required. 265 Cats undergoing long-term therapy (for any condition) should be assessed at regular intervals. Follow-up visits should be scheduled approximately 2 weeks after instituting therapy, 1 month later, and subsequently every 3 to 6 months. The schedules are not fixed and cats should be seen ahead of schedule if the cat fails to respond to treatment. The initial visits are important to assess not only the cat's response to therapy but also the owner's ability to administer medication, whether inhaled or oral. As well as the cat's clinical signs at home at examination, doses and frequency of medication should be assessed and confirmed. Home control measures should be discussed with the clients, such as avoidance of aerosol triggers such as cigarette smoke, fireplace smoke, and dusty cat litters; use of air filters can also help control signs. Cats on long-term systemic glucocorticoid treatment should also have periodic blood glucose assessment. Repeat thoracic radiographs or other investigations may be warranted if a cat's clinical signs persist, recur, or are not controlled entirely.",

Most cats in this study were middle-aged or older, with a median age of 8.3 years (range 1.9 to 15 years). Most cases present for respiratory signspredominantly labored or rapid respiration but also coughing. Lethargy, anorexia, and weight loss are also prominent (but not always present). Respiratory distress is often recognized at presentation and is often inspiratory or mixed inspiratory and expiratory compared with bronchial disease, in which expiratory signs predominate. Respiratory sounds auscultated were described as harsh or loud in numerous cases and wheezes or crackles, or both were recognized in approximately half of the cases. 41 Aspiration of small amounts of inert substances such as water or barium (or less acidic gastric material) usually results in transient, self-limiting hypoxia. Larger volumes aspirated can result in asphyxia, and solid material aspirated may result in a more severe reaction than gastric fluid alone. Solid material, such as food particles, should be removed by suction or bronchoscopy and must be removed as soon as possible to prevent death from asphyxiation. Oxygen therapy and other supportive care should also be instituted. 265 Bacterial pneumonia is a longer-term consequence, and preemptive antibiotics are appropriate.",

The latter often consists of an alveolar pattern with or without ill-defined pulmonary nodules or pleural effusion. The most commonly represented primary tumor is mammary gland adenocarcinoma. 74 Definitive diagnosis depends on cytologic or histologic assessment. Ultrasound-guided FNA of discrete masses or pleural fluid can provide a cytologic diagnosis in many cases but can lead to missed diagnoses because of poor cell recovery as a result of small sample size, poor exfoliation of certain cell types and minimal exfoliation of certain cell types (e.g., mesenchymal cells), necrosis, or failure to obtain a representative sample. 52 Histology of lung biopsy samples may be required for definitive diagnosis. 52, 199, 200 The prognosis for long-term survival with pulmonary adenocarcinoma has been reported to be poor. 13 The degree of differentiation of the tumor is the only recognized prognostic factor associated with survival in cats with primary pulmonary neoplasia; cats with moderately differentiated tumors survived a median 698 days (19 to 1526 days) compared with cats that had poorly differentiated tumors at 75 days (13 to 634 days), although all cats eventually died of metastatic disease. The overall median survival time is 115 days. 95 Longterm individual treatment success is possible: A recent paper reported that a cat remained well, with no radiographic evidence of disease at 34 months after left-sided pneumonectomy and adjuvant chemotherapy with mitoxantrone, administered every 3 to 5 weeks, for 10 doses after surgery. 38 ",

Distinctive clinical signs included facial and limb edema in febrile, anorexic, dehydrated cats, with hair loss and ulcerative dermatitis of the face and feet, and sudden death. 115, 215 In these outbreaks 33% to 50% of infected cats died. Cats need intensive supportive care of intravenous fluids and parenteral antibiotics. Phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (PMOs) are compounds that enter cells to target viral-specific sequences and block viral replication. Use of an single organism (\"pure\" culture) implies infection. 207 Diagnosis of LRT infection, therefore, is based on identification of an organism with supportive historical, clinical, radiographic, and cytologic findings; further, diagnosis is confirmed only with an unambiguous response to appropriate therapy. 78 Clinical signs may not relate directly to the respiratory tract. In one study 14 of 39 cats (36%) did not have respiratory signs, 161 although in another, 18 of 20 cats (90%) had coughing (15 of 20) or dyspnea (3 of 20) . 78 Anorexia, lethargy, and fever were absent in 14 of 39 cats (41%) in one study, 161 and pyrexia was noted in only 25% in another. 78 Hematologic indication of infection (neutrophilia with or without a left shift) is helpful diagnostically if present but can also be absent. 161 Infectious pneumonia is most often associated with an alveolar radiographic pattern, but any pattern is possible; one study found predominantly interstitial patterns (with normal radiographs in 3 of 13 cats), 161 and another, although finding 67% with an alveolar pattern, also found 81% with a bronchial pattern. 78 Neutrophils with toxic changes can be expected to predominate in bronchial wash fluid.",

Experimental infection of cats with H 1 N 1 influenza resulted in lesions confined to the lungs compared with experimental infection with H 5 N 1 influenza, which also results in extrarespiratory lesions. 275 A seroprevalence survey across several states in the United States during the 2009 to 2010 influenza season found that 17 of 78 (21.8%) cats sampled had appreciable antibody titers against the novel H 1 N 1 strain. The high seroprevalence and infrequent reporting of confirmed disease suggest that most infections are clinically inapparent, because there was no increase in pneumonia of undiagnosed cause over the same duration. 174 Poxvirus Cowpox, of the genus Orthopoxvirus, is found only in Eurasia, and the reservoir hosts are voles or wood mice. 19 Poxvirus-associated pneumonia is rare in cats. This virus typically causes focal cutaneous lesions, with few to no systemic signs. 18, 218 Experimental infection of domestic cats has been shown to induce fatal pulmonary disease, 293 and occasional fatal pneumonia has been reported in natural cases. 109, 239, 243 A recent report described the diagnosis and successful treatment of a 5-year-old cat with cowpox virus and herpesvirus pneumonia. Radiographs demonstrated a consolidated caudal right lung lobe. Neutrophils predominated on BAL cytology. Bacterial culture of the BAL fluid yielded a negative result. Tru-Cut biopsy of the consolidated lung lobe demonstrated severe, acute, necrotizing bronchopneumonia with necrosis affected both the bronchiolar and the alveolar epithelium. Cowpox virus and herpesvirus were demonstrated by immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy. Interestingly, the cat had skin lesions additional to the respiratory signs. The cat improved after nearly 2 weeks of hospitalization with intravenous fluid therapy and parenteral antibiotics. The reason for the prolonged hospitalization was that the owner was concerned about the zoonotic potential. 124 The potential of poxvirus infection to veterinary staff and owners should be considered when treating affected cats because cat-tohuman transmission has been reported. 103, 243 Coronavirus In one study feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) was the cause of pneumonia in 9 of 11 cats with viral pneumonia. 161 FIP is unlikely to cause pneumonia in cats without pleural effusion, and there are usually other indicators of infection, such as fever. FIP is covered in detail in Chapter 33.",

            "text": "Until this century, clinical signs resulting from influenza viruses were not recognized in cats despite the recognition that cats mount an immunologic response and develop antibodies against experimental infection. 110, 213, 232 The H 5 N 1 avian influenza pandemic in southeast Asia from the early 2000s resulted in sporadic deaths from natural infection in domestic cats. Infection results from ingestion of the carcass of infected birds, 139, 252 and horizontal transmission to other cats by respiratory and gastrointestinal routes has been demonstrated after experimental infections. 139 Infected cats can develop clinical signs, including significant pyrexia, in 1 to 5 days after infection, and virus attachment in the LRT can result in pneumonic signs in only 1 more day. 139, 230, 274 The disease can be fatal, but some cats are asymptomatic, and this wide range of severity of clinical signs is thought to be dose dependent. 149 Supportive care with intravenous fluids and parenteral, broad-spectrum antibiotics to treat secondary infection is warranted. There have been no reports of humans contracting the infection from diseased cats. 101 The pandemic (H 1 N 1 ) 2009 influenza virus (swine flu) was first reported in pigs in Canada in May of 2009 281 and has subsequently been recognized in multiple species, including humans, on multiple continents. Natural infection has been reported in three domestic cats between the ages of 8 and 13 years; in each case the cats are believed to have been infected by aerosol transmission from their owners. 157, 255 Pneumonia was recognized radiographically between 1 and 4 days after the onset of clinical signs of inappetence, lethargy, and dyspnea. In one case four other cats in the household had less severe respiratory signs that resolved without any intervention. Two cats died, and H 1 N 1 was diagnosed by PCR of postmortem samples (one of lung tissue and the other of a nasal swab). 157 The other cat was diagnosed by PCR of BAL fluid. The BAL fluid comprised 65% macrophages, 25% nondegenerate neutrophils, and 10% small lymphocytes, and radiographs demonstrated opacity of right and left caudal lung lobes. The cat was essentially managed as an outpatient with at-home administration of subcutaneous fluids and oral, broadspectrum antibiotics. 255 dating back to 1973. 118 N. animaloris is considered to be part of the normal oral flora of the dog and cat and has been recovered from the oral cavity of 30% to 82% of normal dogs 8, 234 ; no specific studies appear to have been done in cats, but they are thought to be normal flora in this species also. 279 The organism causes fatal necrotizing pneumonia with a multifocal distribution, which suggests hematogenous dissemination. The precise pathogenesis of N. animaloris infection in cats is not well understood. All previous cases have appeared acute clinically, with death occurring within 1 week of onset of clinical signs and often within 2 days, although necropsy and histologic findings were indicative of chronicity. N. animaloris has been shown to have inherently low virulence because experimental inoculation of guinea pigs with low numbers of bacteria did not result in any discernible change, but inoculation with larger numbers resulted in death within 18 hours. 156 It has been postulated that prolonged infection overwhelms the host's defenses, resulting in periodic subclinical bacteremia with hematogenous dissemination to the lungs and an eventual acute on chronic terminal exacerbation. 70 Thus the eventual outcome for the patient most likely depends on whether the organism spreads to locations that favor its survival and replication. Because of its small size and Gram stain reaction, the organism is difficult to visualize in cytologic and histologic preparations, necessitating culture of specimens to recognize infection. The organism is susceptible to a broad range of antibiotics, but no successful treatment has been recorded on account of the severity of signs at time of presentation. 11 Pasteurella spp.",

In case series, two postmortem studies reported Mycoplasma pneumonia prevalence of 0% 161 and 15%, 17 respectively, yet a clinical paper found 13 of 17 (76%) of bacterial LRT infections to have mycoplasma infection (and 11 of 13 had purely mycoplasma infection). 78 Further, Mycoplasma spp. feature prominently in other reports of feline LRT infections. 35, 48, 76, 163, 273 This discrepancy between antemortem and postmortem findings may be because Mycoplasma spp. lends itself to more ready diagnosis and successful treatment can be achieved in most cases. Mycoplasma spp. have not been isolated from airways of healthy cats, 221 yet mycoplasma LRT infections are often considered to be a consequence of preexisting pulmonary disease, mostly asthma or chronic bronchitis. In human asthma it is recognized that mycoplasma infection can exacerbate asthma and that asthma is induced subsequent to mycoplasma infection; similar associations may apply in feline medicine. 76, 78 In most cases infection is associated with the airways, but pulmonary parenchymal involvement also may be present (see Figure 30 -13). 35, 76, 78, 221, 273 In some cases pulmonary abscessation may be seen (Figure 30-19) . 48, 78 In most cases treatment with doxycycline 5 mg/kg orally every 12 hours for 3 weeks is often effective to clear infection, but if a cat has underlying airway disease (asthma or chronic bronchitis), management of the concurrent disease is required. 78 ",

Collectively, A. abstrusus and E. aerophilus are known as lungworm; P. kellicotti is known as lung fluke. Additionally, the filarioid, Dirofilaria immitis, or heartworm, although a resident of the pulmonary artery in cats, causes predominantly respiratory disease, and the The organism is recognized as indigenous microflora of the nasopharynx and large airways of dogs and cats. 89 Prior respiratory disease such as viral infection 89 or potassium bromide-induced airway disease 78 contributes to proliferation and then migration to lower airways. Reduced defense mechanisms lead to impaired bacterial clearance from the lung and resultant pneumonia. Pasteurella spp. are usually susceptible to a broad range of antibiotics; however, the pneumonia may be slow to resolve, and abscesses or pleuritis may develop. 89 Bordetella Pneumonia as a result of B. bronchiseptica infection has been recognized both experimentally 47, 116 and as a result of natural infection, 282, 287 although in most cases disease will be confined to the URT. It is likely that in cases of natural infection other factors may be involved in disease, including environmental factors such as stress or overcrowding or, in some cases, preexisting viral infection. 37, 66 Multiple cases of LRT disease associated with Bordetella have been reported in breeding catteries, boarding catteries, and in veterinary clinics with boarding facilities. Dogs with Bordetella may spread the infection to cats. 21, 105, 154 Most cases of Bordetella pneumonia are in kittens; a postmortem study of pneumonia in which 65% of cases were kittens younger than 12 weeks of age found 30% of confirmed bacterial infections to be B. bronchiseptica, 17 whereas only 1 of 68 (1.5%) of positive lower airway cultures from cats of unspecified age were recognized in another study. 257 Antibiotic choice should be based on sensitivity findings; however, almost all isolates of B. bronchiseptica from cats are sensitive to tetracyclines, and doxycycline dosed at 5 mg/kg orally every 12 hours for 21 days is the antimicrobial of choice. Feline isolates of B. bronchiseptica are less susceptible to clavulanate-potentiated amoxicillin, and a high level of resistance has been detected to ampicillin and trimethoprim. 254 Supportive care is almost always required initially. Feline vaccines against B. bronchiseptica are available in many countries. Although pneumonia is a severe consequence of this organism, in most cases bordetellosis is a mild disease of low prevalence in the small populations typical of most pet cats, so routine vaccinations are not recommended. Use of this vaccine should be limited to those cats living in or moving into high-density populations of cats with a history of bordetellosis. 66 B. bronchiseptica is a zoonosis, and disease has been reported in immunecompromised humans in association with living with cats. 283 ",

            "text": "P. kellicotti is a trematode that can infect the lungs of cats and dogs in the Eastern United States, mainly in areas surrounding the Mississippi River. Other species of Paragonimus can affect cats across eastern Asia and Central and South America. The disease in man is endemic in southeast Asia and portions of central Africa. 214 Adult flukes live within cysts inside the lung parenchyma and are about 6 mm long. Eggs are deposited into the lung tissue, where they are coughed up, swallowed, and then passed in the feces. If the eggs enter fresh water, they begin to develop and produce a ciliated miracidium, which hatches and seeks out a young snail host. After asexual multiplication in the snail, the cercarial stage is produced, which penetrates the shell of a crayfish and encysts in an area near the heart of the crustacean. Within the crayfish the cercaria forms a cyst wall and becomes a metacercaria. When the crayfish is ingested by a cat (or dog), the excised metacercariae penetrate the intestinal tract and enter the peritoneal cavity, within which they migrate for 7 to 10 days before entering the pleural cavity through the diaphragm. The lungs are entered approximately 2 weeks after infection. 259 Dogs and cats typically become infected by eating metacercariae in crayfish, but rats can serve as paratenic hosts and transmammary or transplacental transmission is also thought to be possible. 23 Clinical signs such as occasional coughing are usually mild, although pneumothorax can result from migrating flukes. Early lesions appear radiographically as indistinct nodular densities containing small air cavities and having irregular, sharply defined margins; older cysts are usually air-filled pneumatocysts, but illdefined interstitial nodular densities may also be seen. 229, 280 Successful treatment has been reported with praziquantel (25 mg/kg orally every 8 hours for a total dose of 150 mg/kg) and albendazole (25 mg/kg orally every 12 hours for 11 to 24 days). 23, 61, 114 protozoan Toxoplasma gondii can lead to pulmonary involvement in systemic disease.",

            "text": "A. abstrusus has worldwide distribution. 42 Adult A. abstrusus lungworms live in the respiratory bronchioles and alveolar ducts of cats. After mating, the females produce eggs that hatch in this same location. The first stage larvae (L1) then ascend the bronchial tree to the pharynx, from where they are swallowed and subsequently excreted in the feces and into the environment. L1s are then ingested by slugs and snails that act as intermediate hosts, with rodents, frogs, lizards, snakes, or birds acting as paratenic hosts. Cats become infected by ingesting a mollusk or a paratenic host (or both). 272 Most infections are subclinical 96, 244 ; however, heavy infections can result in clinical signs as a result of damage to the lung parenchyma induced by eggs and larvae. Severe disease can be fatal. Severe clinical disease was reproduced experimentally after kittens were infected with 800 L3 larvae; coughing developed 6 weeks after exposure. 97 A. abstrusus infection can mimic allergic respiratory disease because radiographs often demonstrate a bronchointerstitial pattern (although an alveolar pattern predominates during the period of heaviest larval shedding at 5 to 15 weeks post infection) and BAL fluids comprise predominantly eosinophils; further, cats can show an initial positive response to administration of corticosteroids and bronchodilators. 88, 271 Diagnosis depends on recognition of the organism in feces, BAL fluid, or pleural fluid. 140, 272 In one study standard fecal examination recognized A. abstrusus in only 21.7% of infected cats. 128 Using the Baermann technique to examine feces is considered the most sensitive method for larval detection; however, sensitivity is less than 90%. 140, 285 A PCR assay for A. abstrusus has recently been validated for use on Baermann sediment, feces, and pharyngeal swabs. This shows great promise to aid in diagnosis, with a reported specificity of 100% and sensitivity of 96.6%. 272 Many parasiticides have proved to be effective in treating cats with A. abstrusus infection. Fenbendazole has been used at 20 mg/kg orally every 24 hours for 5 days or 50 mg/kg orally every 24 hours for 15 days. 16, 88, 98 Ivermectin (0.4 mg/kg subcutaneously, repeated 2 weeks later) has been reported to be effective in some reported cases. 27, 131 Abamectin (0.3 mg/kg subcutaneously, repeated 2 weeks later) was effective in the treatment of one cat. 78 A single topical application of imidacloprid/moxidectin reduced larval counts by 100% in one study, 269a and topical application of emodopside/ praziquental reduced larval counts by 99.4% in another. 272a Two applications of selamectin (6 mg/kg, topical) were effective in the treatment of only one of three cats. 88 ",

            "text": "Toxoplasma gondii may cause self-limiting small bowel diarrhea but typically causes no disease in cats. However, transplacentally or lactationally infected kittens and immune-suppressed older cats can show severe systemic signs. 60 In a study of 100 cases with histologically confirmed toxoplasmosis, 76.7% of 86 lung tissue samples assessed had organisms present, and in the 36 cats considered to have generalized toxoplasmosis, 26 had predominantly pulmonary lesions. 59 Retrospective studies of feline LRT infection have found T. gondii in 1 of 20 cats (5%) 78 and 6 of 245 cases (2.4%). 17 Diagnosis is achieved by recognition of Toxoplasma tachyzoites, which can be found in BAL fluid 14 or FNA of affected lung tissue. 219, 235 Diffuse interstitial to alveolar patterns are typically described, 14,219,235 but a bronchial influence is also possible 14 (Figure 30-20) . Serology can aid diagnosis. 60 Recognition of Toxoplasma in an adult cat should instigate investigations to determine a cause of immune suppression, which is often FIV related 50,78 but can be iatrogenic (e.g., due to administration of corticosteroids or cyclosporin). 14,77 Treatment is covered in detail in Chapter 23 but is typically with clindamycin at 12.5 to 25 mg/kg orally every 12 hours for 2 weeks 60 ; combination therapy with pyrimethamine at 0.25 to 0.5 mg/kg orally every 12 hours may help the prognosis. 14 Supportive care such as oxygen therapy maintenance of fluid and electrolyte balance is also important. Successful treatment of clinical feline toxoplasmosis has been described infrequently. 14, 59, 143 Heartworm Despite prevalence studies demonstrating a worldwide distribution and recognizing heartworm infection in up to 18% of cats tested,* the prevalence rate being approximately 5% to 10% of that found in dogs, 84, 150, 153 * References 31, 71, 84, 107, 138, 150, 151, 155, 158, 197, 269, 285. prevalence being found similar to that of FIV and FeLV infection, 150, 151, 158 feline heartworm disease remains underdiagnosed in general practice. 30, 195 This is likely because clinical signs vary dramatically from no signs to sudden death and definitive diagnosis can be difficult. 20, 30, 153, 196 Heartworm disease is caused by the filarioid nematode Dirofilaria immitis, which is transmitted by mosquitos and for which dogs are the usual definitive host. Therefore a prerequisite for heartworm infection is a climate with adequate temperature and humidity to support a viable mosquito population and allow maturation of larvae within the intermediate host. The sexually dimorphic adult heartworm mate within an infected dog's pulmonary artery, producing immature forms called microfilariae. Circulating microfilariae are ingested by mosquitoes feeding on infected dogs. Within mosquitoes, microfilariae transform into larval stages. There are five larval stages (L1 to L5); L1 to L3 transformations occur within the mosquito, and L3 is the form that is transmitted from mosquitos to dogs and cats. Maturation from L3 to other larval stages occurs in subcutaneous tissues and peripheral veins of mammalian hosts; immature worms in peripheral veins are carried in the bloodstream to and through the heart, with adult heartworms ultimately residing at the caudal pulmonary arteries. 1 There are significant differences between feline and canine heartworm disease because the parasite is only partially adapted to the cat. The cat is susceptible to heartworm infection but more resistant than the dog. The cat represents a dead-end host because it cannot act as a reservoir for infection. The prepatent period in the cat is 7 to 8 months (1 to 2 months longer than in dogs). 169 In dogs, most juvenile worms mature into adults that can live for 5 to 7 years, whereas in cats most juvenile worms die shortly after arriving in the pulmonary arteries, instigating a severe vascular and parenchymal inflammatory response. Pulmonary lesions may be long lasting. The clinical response in the cat has been termed heartworm-associated respiratory disease (HARD). In a small percentage of cats, a few worms develop to mature adults that can live for 2 to 3 years. 195 Cats with adult heartworms develop pulmonary changes characterized by intimal proliferation, eosinophilic endarteritis, intimal fibrosis, and disruption of the internal elastic lamina. Arterial wall changes can lead to pulmonary hypertension with resultant pulmonary arterial distention. 173 Damage can be caused by juvenile heartworms without development to the adult stage, resulting in increase in thickness of the pulmonary arterial wall that in turn causes occlusion. 26, 56 There have been suggestions that Wolbachia pipientis, a symbiotic gram-negative intracellular bacterium harbored by D. immitis induces further pulmonary pathology. 57 A strong antibody response against Wolbachia surface protein has American Heartworm Society, the primary reasons for heartworm testing in cats are as follows:",

Sudden death has been reported in 7% to 47% of naturally infected cats with mature adult heartworm infections. 7, 68, 84, 277 Additional signs that may be seen include neurologic signs or vomiting. 7, 277 On most occasions cats will present clinically with respiratory tract signs mimicking asthma or chronic bronchitis, such as coughing or dyspnea. 7, 84, 277 Physical examination findings are nonspecific. Investigations should follow those for any cats with respiratory signs, but the diagnosis of heartworm disease is sometimes reached only when a high degree of suspicion of this disease is maintained. Cats are rarely microfilaremic, so filtration or immunofluorescent assay for microfilaria is not recommended. No single diagnostic test can detect feline heartworm at all life stages of the worm (Table  30-4) . Serologic testing, if positive, is the most straightforward for demonstration of infection, but falsenegative results occur frequently. According to the serologic testing. Recovery is indicated by an improvement in radiographic signs and seroconversion of a positive antigen test to negative. In areas where heartworm is endemic for dogs, all serologic evidence points to the appropriateness of cats (including those confined to indoors) receiving regular prophylactic treatment. There are several macrocytic lactone drugs registered for feline heartworm prophylaxis: ivermectin (Heartguard FX chewables, Merial), milbemycin oxide (Milbemax, Novartis), moxidectin (Advocate/Advantage Multi, Bayer; NB also contains imidacloprid), and selamectin (Revolution or Stronghold, Pfizer). heartworm prophylaxis may become antibody positive, although they are not at risk for HARD. Combining antigen and antibody testing achieves higher sensitivity than either test alone but may generate more falsepositive results. 250 Radiographic findings may add to a clinician's index of suspicion for heartworm disease, but results are inconsistent. Significant enlargement of the central and peripheral caudal lobar pulmonary arteries (greater than 1.6 times the width of the ninth rib) in the ventrodorsal view has been considered a typical radiographic sign of heartworm infection in cats. However, this was recognized in only 53% of cases in one study 237 and only 1 of 11 cats in another. 277 The latter study found diffuse or focal bronchointerstitial patterns to be most common, with focal changes supporting a better prognosis. 277 Echocardiography, in experienced hands, can also aid diagnosis. Adult heartworms typically appear as two echodense parallel lines within the pulmonary artery, one of its branches, or the right ventricle. One study found heartworms in 17 of 43 cats with echocardiography but, it is important to note, allowed a definitive diagnosis to be made in five cats in which antigen test results were negative; four of these five cats had positive antibody test results. 53 There is no definitive treatment for heartworm disease in cats. Most cats with infection are asymptomatic, and it is appropriate to start prophylactic treatment in these cats. Heartworm prophylactic treatments have been demonstrated to be slowly adulticidal in dogs, 168 and there is no reason to assume that this would not also be the case in cats. Ivermectin has the most potent adulticidal activity, milbemycin the least, with selamectin and moxidectin in between. 168 More rapid kill of adult heartworm with arsenical agents such as thiacetarsemide or melarsomine is not recommended. These agents are believed to be less potent in cats and have significant toxicity, and death of heartworms may result in fatal pulmonary embolism. 153 Successful surgical removal of heartworms has been reported, although there are substantial risks associated with the procedure. In particular, crushing or transecting the adult heartworms can induce a fatal shock reaction. Trauma to the jugular vein during multiple heartworm retrievals may result in transection of the vein. 248 In most cases, in addition to heartworm prophylaxis, it is appropriate to manage the clinical signs of infected cats with corticosteroids and bronchodilators. Prednisolone has been used at 2 mg/kg orally every 24 hours and then tapered at remission of clinical signs. 84 If W. pipientis is demonstrated to be relevant to clinical disease, a 3-week course of doxycycline (5 mg/kg orally every 12 hours) would be appropriate. 57 Monitoring of heartworminfected cats with radiographic evidence of disease may include repeat thoracic radiographs at 6-to 12-month intervals. Infected cats can also be monitored with repeat",

Lung volume and expansion are also affected with pathology of the pulmonary parenchyma (e.g., pneumonia, pulmonary edema), so a similar breathing pattern may result. In early stages, signs may be subtle, and cats may simply reduce activity levels. Cats may prefer a sitting or crouched sternal posture with elbows abducted from the thorax, perhaps with head or neck extended to maximize air intake. Coughing is not considered a typical sign with pleural space disease but may result from tracheal compression (e.g., from neoplasia) or pulmonary parenchymal involvement or pleuritis. 11, 105 Coughing was recognized in 30 of 37 cats with chylothorax in one series. 39 Other clinical signs depend on the underlying cause of intrathoracic disease but may include weight loss, anorexia, or fever. processes can result in pleural effusion, but in most cases the underlying cause is FIP, CHF, neoplasia, pyothorax, or idiopathic chylothorax. A recent review accumulated results from five prior studies ascertaining that of 265 cats with a definitive diagnosis of pleural effusion, 88% to 100% of cases had one of these first four diagnoses 11 ; idiopathic chylothorax is a diagnosis of exclusion and represents 10% to 15% of cats with pleural effusion. 23, 129, 141 Because clinical signs of pleural effusion are essentially the same as for other diseases affecting the pleural space, radiography (or ultrasonography) is required to confirm the presence of pleural fluid.",

Multiple radiographic views for precise diagnostics should be attempted only in stable cats. In severe cases, the stress from handling can result in decompensation and death, so some authors advocate thoracocentesis (discussed later and in Box 30-6) before radiography when pleural effusion is suspected. 42, 77 In many circumstances, cats with pleural effusion present very similarly to cats with pulmonary edema or bronchial disease, and radiography is required to confirm the presence of pleural fluid. Handling should be minimal, and initially only a single radiograph in the position most comfortable for the cat should be taken, with no additional handling to improve symmetry, for example. In most cases dyspneic cats are most comfortable sitting sternally and resting on their elbows, so a dorsoventral view is most appropriate. Supplementary oxygen should be provided by mask or flow-by ventilation if this is not stressful to the cat (see . Horizontal beam radiographs can be used to document fluid lines or distinguish masses from freeflowing fluid; in one study, however, this view did not contribute additional information to that gained from plain radiographs in eight of nine cats. 23 Small volumes of pleural effusion are not visible radiographically. It has been shown that 50 mL of effusion is required before radiographic signs are visible in 15-kg dogs, 73 but no similar studies appear to have been performed in cats. The first radiographic signs in small volume effusions are interlobar fissure lines, rounding of lung margins at costophrenic angles, separation of lung borders from the thoracic wall, scalloping of lung margins dorsal to the sternum, blurring to absence of the cardiac silhouette, and widening of the mediastinum. With larger volume effusions the visibility of the heart and mediastinum reduces, lung lobes may collapse, the trachea can be elevated dorsally, and the diaphragm and liver may be displaced dorsally 42, 94, 97 (Figures 30-21 , 30-22, 30-23, and 30-24) .",

In this poorly aligned dorsoventral radiograph, the lung is separated from the thoracic wall (yellow arrow) and the lung margins are rounded (red arrow). The cardiac silhouette is barely visible. Additionally, pulmonary edema can be seen as patchy opacities in lung lobes on the left side. In this case pleural effusion is more obvious in the lateral view (see . This cat was subsequently diagnosed with congestive heart failure secondary to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Ultrasonography can be used to detect the presence of small volumes of pleural effusion when radiographic findings are equivocal. 72, 101 In one study in humans, pleural fluid was recognized by ultrasonography in 93% of cases, compared with only 83% by radiology. 53 Ultrasonography can also provide gross estimations of effusion volume and assess effusion characteristics on the basis of echogenicity. 72, 101 Stabilization Cats (and other animals) with respiratory disease decompensate easily because although the oxygen saturation of hemoglobin is relatively stable, this is only provided the arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PO 2 ) remains above approximately 60 mm Hg. Below this point the amount of oxygen carried by hemoglobin drops dramatically, so for an already respiratory-compromised cat, very small reductions in oxygen intake can result in extreme clinical effects. This is demonstrated by the oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve (Figure 30-25) , where it can be seen that on the flat (right-hand side) part of the curve, decreases in PO 2 from 100 to 60 mm Hg result in only small drops in oxygen hemoglobin saturation. As PO 2 decreases below approximately 60 mm Hg, the curve drops to the left steeply, demonstrating the large decrease in the amount of oxyhemoglobin that results from only small drops in PO 2 ; PO 2 less than 60 mm Hg is defined as hypoxemic respiratory failure. If a cat is underventilating for any reason, the arterial carbon dioxide (PCO 2 ) will rise; therefore, if the patient is inspiring room air, hypoxia will worsen; PCO 2 greater than 45 mm Hg is defined as hypercapnic (ventilatory) respiratory failure. 55, 77 A patient can have both hypercapnic and hypoxemic respiratory failure occurring to differing degrees simultaneously.",

Oxygen therapy can be provided in the short term by flow-by delivery (Figure 30 the increasing heat and humidity caused by the presence of the cat in the sealed cage increases the cat's oxygen demands, thus further reducing the oxygen saturation of hemoglobin. Moreover, each time the cage door is opened to access the patient, the oxygen-rich environment not only is lost (which can lead to decompensation) but takes time to reach the desired oxygen concentration again. Human neonatal incubators (humidicribs) are most appropriate because they do allow manipulation of temperature and humidity, as well as having smaller openings (Figure 30-31) . In severe cases intratracheal catheterization may be necessary, and those cats that cannot sustain PO 2 greater than 60 mm Hg through their own efforts despite conventional oxygen supplementation will require mechanical ventilation. Further details about oxygen therapy are contained in Drainage of pleural fluid by pleurocentesis (puncture and aspiration from the pleural cavity) allows improved lung expansion, thereby enabling further oxygen saturation of hemoglobin. Some authors advocate thoracocentesis (puncture and aspiration from the thorax and not necessarily from the pleural space) before imaging when pleural effusion is strongly suspected because it can result in life-saving improvement for the patient. 42, 77 In experienced hands thoracocentesis is a safe procedure and very well tolerated by cats. The major complications are pneumothorax, hemothorax, pneumohemothorax, or organ laceration, and these risks may be greater in cases when there is a small volume effusion (including no effusion), uncooperative patients, use of a large needle, and the need for multiple needle passes. 103 Thoracocentesis is usually performed at the 6th, 7th, or 8th intercostal space, just ventral to the costochondral junction; this site should be clipped and surgically prepared. The positioning of the cat will vary from case to case. Sternal recumbency is ideal for maximal drainage of fluid, but access ventrally can be difficult when the cat is in this position; having the cat stand is appropriate, but this requires too much effort for many cats with respiratory distress; lateral recumbency results in the best access but may be too stressful for the cat. Butterfly catheter needles of 19 to 23G are appropriate to use and ideally should be mounted to a three-way stopcock and a 10-mL to 20-mL syringe. 42, 103 It is important that fluid be collected for assessment as well as drained for therapeutic purposes.

Other radiographic findings can include a mixed bronchoalveolar pattern, an ill-defined alveolar mass, or a mass with cavitation. Some form of bronchial disease is often present and may represent local airway metastasis. 5, 6, 84, 86 Pulmonary metastasis from other locations appears radiographically as interstitial nodules (which may be well or ill defined) or a diffuse alveolar patter with or without illdefined pulmonary nodules or pleural effusion (or both). Mammary gland adenocarcinoma is the most commonly represented primary tumor. 32 Digital metastasis of bronchial carcinomas is also recognized as an uncommon cause of lameness in older cats; it is also known as lungdigit syndrome and carries an extremely poor prognosis. 48 The prognosis for long-term survival with pulmonary adenocarcinoma is generally poor, with an overall median survival time of 115 days reported. 56 ",

Before lavage, suction should be attempted to determine the volume and nature of pleural effusion. Warmed (to body temperature) compound sodium lactate is used for lavage (use of 0.9% sodium chloride can result in hypokalemia 7 ) with volumes from 10 to 25 mL/kg per lavage. The volume of fluid introduced and aspirated should be recorded for each side, with expected recovery of 75% or more of lavage fluid. Recovery of smaller volumes should prompt investigations (usually with imaging) for thoracostomy tube complications or loculation of pockets of fluid as a result of adhesions. There are no definitive guidelines for frequency of lavage; every 4 hours for the first 24 to 48 hours and subsequently two to three times daily has been recommended. 9 Removal of thoracostomy tubes is indicated when the volume of pleural effusion has reduced to approximately 2 mL/kg per day; pleural effusion has resolved radiographically; and infection has resolved, as indicated by absence of organisms, reduction of neutrophil numbers, and loss of their degenerative appearance and appearance of macrophages. Recent studies have reported a median duration of thoracic drainage of 5 to 6 days. 7, 25, 128 Continuous water seal suction has also been used 59 but offers no real advantage over intermittent suction and lavage as described. Continuous suction offers the advantage of maximal drainage but does not decrease the time needed to manage pyothorax. Further, waterseal chest drainage units require continuous monitoring because leakage between the pleural cavity and the water seal can be fatal. 59 Needle thoracocentesis (on one occasion or multiple times) is the alternative to thoracoscopy tube placement but is associated with higher mortality and should be reserved for cases with low volume effusion or when thoracostomy tube placement is declined by the owner (e.g., because of financial concerns).",

Open pneumothorax is associated with a body wall wound that allows entry of free air. Depending on the wound size, pressure within the pleural space is less than or equal to atmospheric pressure. Closed pneumothorax occurs when the air within the pleural space has entered through a wound of the lung parenchyma or trachea. Open pneumothorax is further divided into simple and tension forms. Simple closed pneumothorax occurs when a puncture of the lung allows air to enter the pleural space during inspiration and exit during expiration. This allows the pressure within the pleural space to equilibrate with atmospheric pressure. In tension pneumothorax, the wound in the lung acts as a flap valve, allowing air to enter the pleural space during inspiration but not allowing it to escape during expiration. This results in a gradual increase in pleural space pressure and progressive pulmonary atelectasis. With large wounds pleural pressure can eventually exceed atmospheric pressure. Untreated tension pneumothorax therefore results in progressively worsening dyspnea, subsequent cardiovascular dysfunction, and ultimately death. 71",

A positive Rivalta test can also result from lymphosarcoma or septic effusions (these can be distinguished from FIP by cytology and culture).
