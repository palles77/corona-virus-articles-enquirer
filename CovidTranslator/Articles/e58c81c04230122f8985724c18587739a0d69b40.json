Sialodacryoadenitis virus (SDAV) and Parker's rat coronavirus (PRC) are two recognized viral strains which cause spontaneous disease in the laboratory rat. Currently there is no recognized practical procedure which will accurately differentiate infections with these strains. Using SDAV-and PRCinfected L-2 cells as the source of antigen, and sera from rats collected post inoculation with either of these viral strains, the indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) procedure was used to determine whether antibody titers could be used to differentiate infections from the homologous and heterologous virus. There was no detectable difference in the sensitivity or specificity of these systems in detecting antibody to the homologous or heterologous virus. Thus there was no evidence that SDAV-and PRC-infected cells would serve to differentiate antibody to the homologous virus using the IFA technique. In addition, antibody titers were similar when mouse hepatitis virus (MHV)-infected cells were used as the source of antigen for the IFA technique. However, using MHV or SDAV-infected cells as the source of antigen, there was a significant difference in antibody titers to the homologous virus detected using the immunoenzyme technique.",

One method used for the detection of coronaviral antibodies in rodent sera consists of equal proportions of cells infected with the JHM and S strains of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) as a source of antigen, together with uninfected cells. Using this as a source of antigen, the indirect fluorescent antibody procedure has proven to be a test system with D.H.

Similarly, enzyme i m m u n o a s s a y (EIA) procedures have been developed for antibody detection and titration.

When approximately 80% confluent, monolayers were inoculated with stock virus suspension, and incubated for 48 h at 37 \u00b0C in 5% CO2. Infected and control cells were then removed using a rubber policeman, placed in two separate centrifuge tubes, and centrifuged at 1600rpm, then resuspended in PBS. Cells were then mixed at one part of infected to 1.5 parts of noninfected cells. 20 gl of the mixture were then dropped on each well in multiwell depression glass slides (Gibco/BRL Inc). Slides were air dried for 1 h, fixed in acetone, and stored at -7 0 \u00b0C until tested.",

            "text": "The ability to replicate relatively high titers of rat coronaviruses in a continuous cell line has provided the opportunity to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of rat coronaviral-infected cells compared to MHV-infected cells as a source of antigen for the detection and titration of antibody to SDAV and PRC. The antigenic similarities among the rodent coronaviruses have been emphasized in previous studies [1, 3], thus allowing the use of MHV-infected cells as a source of antigen for the detection of antibodies to either mouse or rat coronaviruses [6] . Based on our studies, the use of rat coronavirus-infected cells as a source of antigen offers no significant advantage over MHV-infected cells. Furthermore, we were unable to demonstrate any appreciable advantage in using either SDAV or PRC as a source of viral antigen to detect antibody to the homologous virus, either in sensitivity or specificity. Based on these data, there is no evidence that IFA staining of L-2 cells infected with either SDAV or PRC will serve to differentiate antibody to the homologous or heterologous virus. However, using M H V or SDAV-infected cells as a source of antigen for the enzyme immunoassay procedure, there was a significant difference in the anti-SDAV antibody titers using the homologous virus (p < 0.0046). SDA antibody titers were usually considerably higher using the enzyme immunoassay procedure with homologous antigen than with MHV-infected cells.",
