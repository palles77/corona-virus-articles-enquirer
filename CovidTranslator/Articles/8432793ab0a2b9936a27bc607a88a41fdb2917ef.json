To determine the sequence essential for frameshifting, substitution mutations were introduced within the region containing the run of adenines and were examined for their effects on frameshifting. Substitutions at each of three (2nd, 3rd and 4th) adenine residues in the run, which are recognized by tRNA Lys reading insA, caused serious defects in frameshifting, showing that the three adenine residues are essential for frameshifting. The effects of substitution mutations introduced in the region flanking the run of adenines and in the secondary structures located downstream were, however, small, indicating that such a region and structures are not essential for frameshifting. Deletion of a region containing the termination codon of insA caused a decrease in fi-galactosidase activity specified by the lacZ fusion plasmid in frame with B'-insB. Exchange of the wild-type termination codon of insA for a different one or introduction of an additional termination codon in the region upstream of the native termination codon caused an increase in fi-galactosidase activity, indicating that the termination codon in insA affects the efficiency of frameshifting.",

            "text": "Accurate translation is ensured in general by regular progression of the ribosome in a triplet manner. Since disturbance of the regular triplet rule results in abortive translation, it is believed that the translational apparatus is actively constrained to maintain the correct reading Correspondence to: E. Ohtsubo frame during polypeptide chain elongation. Some functional proteins, however, can be synthesized only if specific translational frameshifting occurs (for a recent review, see Atkins et al. 1990; Sekine and Ohtsubo 1991) . Insertion sequence IS1 (Ohtsubo and Ohtsubo 1978) uses such programmed frameshifting to produce IS/transposase from two out-of-phase reading frames, insA and B'-insB, where B' is an open reading frame extending from the ATG initiation codon of the insB frame and is in the -1 frame with respect to insA (Sekine and Ohtsubo 1989) . The frameshifting event in the -1 direction occurs at an AAA codon for Lys in insA within a run of six adenines present in the overlapping region between insA and B', and produces the InsA-B'-InsB fusion protein, IS/ transposase, with the segment Leu-Lys-Lys-Leu encoded by the region containing the run of adenines (Sekine et al. 1992) .",

The run of six adenines present at the region corresponding to IS1 coordinates 307-312 has been shown to contain the frameshift site ( Fig. 1 ; Sekine and Ohtsubo 1989; Sekine et al. 1992) . The amino acid sequence at residues 84-87 of IS/transposase has been shown to be Leu-Lys-Lys-Leu (LKKL), which is encoded by the DNA seg- The number in parenthesis in the third line in each box shows the relative cointegration frequency of each IS1 mutant with a 1 bp insertion, designed so as to produce a mutant transposase with the polypeptide segment shown in the second line without frameshifting; the cointegration frequency of the IS/mutant with a single adenine insertion within the run of adenines to produce wild-type transposase (1.4x 10 -6 per division cycle; Sekine and Ohtsubo 1989 ) was taken as 100 ment 5'-TTAAAAAACTC-3' including the frameshift site, and the last codon recognized in insA during translation of IS/transposase has been estimated to be codon AAA for Lys at the second, third and fourth position in the run of adenines ( Fig. 1 ; Sekine et al. 1992) . To confirm the importance of the run of adenines and to determine the critical nucleotides within it, we constructed IS1 mutants each with a 1 bp substitution within the run of adenines and examined their ability to mediate cointegration. Figure 1 shows all the mutants constructed and summarizes the frequencies of cointegration mediated by these mutants. Note here that each mutation may alter the mRNA context responsible for translational frameshifting, causing variations in the efficiency of frameshifting. (This effect is referred to as the context effect.) Also, it may alter the amino acid specified by the mutated triplet, producing a mutant transposase with an altered degree of activity upon successful frameshifting. (This effect is referred to as the amino acid effect.) The cointegration frequency may be lowered by the context effect and/or by the amino acid effect. The degree of the amino acid effect can be estimated by examining the cointegration frequency mediated by an IS/ mutant with a 1 bp insertion, which produces, without frameshifting, an altered transposase that is expected to correspond to the one produced by frameshifting from a relevant IS/ mutant with a substitution ( Fig. 1 ; Sekine et al. 1992) . With these mutants, we can approximately estimate the context effect by subtracting the extent of the amino acid effect from the cointegration frequency measured.",

This substitution changes codon TTA at positions 305-307 (designated as 3\u00b0STTA) in insA for Leu at the 84th residue (designated as S4L) to the synonymous codon TTG, and thus this mutation is assumed to give wild-type transposase with the LKKL segment upon successful frameshifting. The result above suggests that the substitution at 307 shows some context effect, but that this position is not critically important for frameshifting. The mutants with each of the other substitutions, 307T and 307C, did not efficiently mediate cointegration (Fig. 1) . The poor cointegration ability of these IS/mutants is likely to be due to alteration of the amino acid from S4L (Leu) to F (Phe) by substitution mutations to give a mutant transposase with the FKKL segment, since the mutant with a 1 bp insertion which produces such a mutant transposase without frameshifting in fact showed less cointegration ability than that of the 1 bp insertion mutant producing wild-type transposase with the LKKL segment (Fig. 1) . Note here that a mutant IS1 with two substitutions, 305C and 307T, which changes the codon 3\u00b0STTA for S4L (Leu) to the synonymous codon CTT, retained cointegration ability at 62% of the level of wild-type IS1 (Sekine et al. 1992) .

The expression of the reading frame connected to ATGcro is under the control of a thermosensitive repressor, the product of ci857, which is also carried by the plasmid. We then measured the/%galactosidase (LacZ) activity in the lysate of cells harboring each plasmid to determine the efficiency of -1 frameshifting required to give the InsA-B'-InsB-LacZ fusion protein upon heat induction.",

All these substitution mutations cause no changes in the amino acids of the transposase. The frequencies of cointegration mediated by each IS/mutant relative to that of wild-type (wt) IS/(1.9 x 10-8 per division cycle) are shown destroy some of the possible secondary structures shown in Fig. 3 .

The relative activity of LacZ is calculated taking the LacZ activity (16.9 units) specified by the wild type, pSEK6000, as 100 event. We suspected that the termination codon 329TAA of insA, which is located within this region at 17 bp downstream of the run of adenines, is important for efficient frameshifting. To test this, we constructed several derivatives of the ISl-lacZ fusion plasmid pSEK6000 each with a base substitution in the termination codon, and examined the LacZ activity specified by each plasmid. Plasmid pSEK6294 has codon CAA instead of the ochre codon 329TAA (Fig. 4) . This plasmid gave a reduced activity, 24.6% of that of the wild type, pSEK6000 (Fig. 4) . This 4.l-fold decrease is almost equal to the degree of reduction in the efficiency of frameshifting (4.5-fold decrease) observed in the plasmid deleted for the termination codon (Sekine et al. 1992) . This suggests that the termination codon of insA is responsible for efficient frameshifting in IS/. Plasmid pSEK6311, with a substitution changing 329TAA to the amber codon TAG, gave an increased activity (328%, Fig. 4 ). Plasmid pSEK6301 with a substitution changing 329TAA to the opal codon TGA gave a much increased activity (2880%, Fig. 4 ). This increase in considered to be mainly due to the phenomenon called translational coupling (see Discussion) in that translation was unusually initiated from a possible initiation codon, 3ZSGTG, created in-frame with lacZ by 330G. In fact, plasmid pSEK6284-301, with a sequence altered from 328GTGA to CTGA, which abolished the putative initiation codon GTG, decreased LacZ activity (Fig. 4) . Note here, however, that pSEK6284-301 still gave more LacZ activity than the wild type, pSEK6000. These results further indicate that the termination codon of insA is important for frameshifting.",

This result led us to assume that this termination codon introduced into insA at a position upstream of the native termination codon affects the efficiency of frameshifting. To test this assumption directly, we constructed plasmid pSEK6151, a derivative of pSEK6000, with the opal codon 314TGA in insA at the same position as that in the IS/ mutant described above. This plasmid gave a LacZ activity 3.5 times higher than the wild-type, pSEK6000 (Fig. 4) , which parallels the increase in cointegration frequency in the IS1 mutant with the same mutation. We purified the protein with LacZ activity from the cells harboring pSEK6151 and determined its N-terminal sequence. The 17 cycles of Edman degradation revealed a sequence identical to that of the protein specified by the plasmid with the DNA fragment of wild-type IS1 (data not shown). This indicates that the LacZ activity specified by pSEK6151 was dependent on frameshifting and that the site of frameshifting was not changed.",

B Unusual base pairings of codon 3\u00b0SAAA in mRNA with U-35, U*-34 and U-33 of tRNA Lye, followed by disengagement of U-33. Base pairing between A-307 of mRNA and U-36 in the normal anticodon of tRNA Lys may be formed. C Slippage of tRNA Lys in the -1 direction. Note that each event permits A-310 to be available for base pairing with the anticodon of tRNA Ly~ reading codon 3 lOAA A of the frameshift site has also been reported in an artificial context (Weiss et al./987) . The results in this paper were obtained by two methods, cointegration mediated by IS1 and the LacZ assay of the products from ISi-lacZ fusion genes. In the LacZ assay, we observed that LacZ activity measured in one case derives from an unusual translation initiation event at a codon in-frame with lacZ, as well as from translation of lacZ which is dependent on -1 frameshifting. Introduction of the termination codon TGA into insA instead of TAA resulted in an unusually high activity of LacZ due to translation initiated from codon GTG in B'-insB-lacZ, which overlaps the introduced TGA codon. Since a reasonable ribosome binding site is absent in the upstream region of the initiation codon created, initiation of translation from the new initiation codon in B'-insB-lacZ might have occurred in a manner that depends on translation of the upstream reading frame (insA). Such a phenomenon is known as translational coupling, and was first described for the tryptophan operon in E. coli (Oppenheim and Yanofsky 1980) and subsequently in many other genetic systems. Obviously in our analysis described above, we have not considered this case of unusual initiation of translation in our interpretation of the requirements for frameshifting in IS1. Based on our results described above, it is reasonable to presume that a tRNA for Lys (tRNA Lys) recognizing codon 3\u00b0SAAA in insA plays a key role in frameshifting.",

It is expected that the anticodon of tRNA Lys interacts with the codon 3\u00b0SAAA for 8SK (Lys) in insA, as shown in Fig. 5A (top) , and that the nucleotide A at position 310 (designated as A-310) is somehow recognized by the next tRNA Lys reading 31\u00b0AAA for 86K (Lys) in B'-insB to initiate the -1 frameshifting event. It is possible that after tRNA Lys recognizes codon 3\u00b0SAAA, the base pairing between U-34 in the anticodon and A-310 of the codon is disengaged transiently to permit A-310 to became available for the first base of codon 31\u00b0AAA in B'-insB for S6K (Lys) (Fig. 5A ). Note here, however, that U-34 in the anticodon of tRNA Lys is modified to 5-(methylaminomethyl)-2-thiouridine (mnm5s2g; see U* in Fig. 5 ) in E. coli (Chakraburtty et al. 1975) , and that such modifications in U stabilize base pairing with A (Scheit and Faerber 1975; Yokoyama et al. 1985) . Therefore, disengagement of this stable base pairing is assumed not to be a frequent event in induction of a -1 shift of the reading frame.",

In this model, it is possible that at the same time as the disengagement of U-33, another pairing between U-36 in the normal anticodon and A-307 of the mRNA may occur to stabilize the tRNA Ly~ on the mRNA (see Fig. 5B ).

The four nucleotides at positions 307-310 in the mRNA are all adenines, and therefore the anticodon of tRNA Ly~ can base pair with the mRNA after slippage. If the slippage model is correct, a substitution at A-307 would inhibit frameshifting due to disruption of the site to which the tRNA Ly~ slips. However, as described in Results, the mutants with a substitution at position 307 still retained their ability to mediate cointegration. We assume, therefore, that the slippage model shown in Fig. 5 C is questionable. The simultaneous slippage model has been proposed as the mechanism for frameshifting on retroviral mRNA (Jacks et al. 1988 ). In this model, two adjacent tRNAs in the 0-frame, resident in the ribosomal P site and A site, respectively, slip back by one nucleotide, where the A site codon is the site of frameshifting. Wild-type IS/ has nucleotide sequence T TTA AAA at positions 304-310 which seems to fit the sequence requirement of this model. However, as described in Results, the mutant IS/ with 304C or 305C substitution, where the tRNA in the P site cannot make stable base pairs after a -1 slippage, still mediated cointegration. This suggests that the simultaneous slippage model cannot explain the -1 frameshifting in IS1.",
