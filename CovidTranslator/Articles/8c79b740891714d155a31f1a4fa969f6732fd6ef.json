As of March 1, 2020, 79,968 patients in China and 7169 outside of China had tested positive for COVID-19 and a mortality rate of 3.6% has been observed amongst Chinese patients. Its primary mode of transmission is via respiratory droplets from coughs and sneezes. The virus can remain viable for up to three days on plastic and stainless steel or in aerosols for upto 3 hours and is relatively more stable than the known human coronaviruses. It is stable in faeces at room temperature for at least 1-2 days and can be stable in infected patients for up to 4 days. Heat at 56\u00b0C kills the SARS coronavirus at around 10000 units per 15 minutes. Thus, temperature is an important factor in survival of COVID-19 virus and this article focuses on understanding the relationship between temperature and COVID-19 transmission from the data available",

Ever since, the disease was first identified in 2019 in Wuhan, China, it has spread worldwide quickly. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the 2019-2020 coronavirus outbreak a pandemic and a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). As of March 20, 2020, more than 240,000 cases have been reported, and more 10,000 people have lost their lives [2] . When the SARS outbreak happened in 2002-2003, SARS-CoV spread to approximately 30 countries only [3] . However, the current outbreak of COVID-19 by SARS-CoV-2 has spread to 176 countries or territories which suggests the enhanced ability of viruses to be aerosolized [2] . Environmental factors such as atmospheric temperature modulates the survival and spread of virus aerosols. It was shown that survival of influenza viral aerosols is reduced at higher temperatures [4] . In this study, we aimed to ascertain the relation between atmospheric temperatures and the COVID-19 disease recovery rates across the globe.",

Temperature reports were downloaded for each location for the day range of 01/22/2020-03/16/2020 which were correlated with the number of confirmed positive cases, deaths and recoveries. The ggpairs() function from the GGally package was used to create a plot matrix to see how the variables relate to each other [9] . The coefficient errors provide a variation of the estimated coefficients from the actual average while the t-value measures how many standard deviations the estimated coefficient is from zero. Residuals describe how well does the model fit the data and a bell curve distribution is an ideal for any linear fit [10] .

Correlation analysis between temperatures, cases confirmed positive, dead and recovered was performed separately for overall countries in the month of January, February and March of 2020. For cases confirmed positive, dead and recovered, a total number of cases was used as a variable value while an average of temperature (degree celsius (\u00b0C)) for each of the months was used as a variable temperature value. Comparing overall cases for temperature, no significant correlation between temperatures and cases confirmed positive, dead or recovered was observed ( Figure 5A ), however, a strong correlation (~0.9) was observed between cases confirmed and deaths for each of the three months. To further investigate effects of temperature, country (Australia) with highest average temperature (January~18\u00b0C, February~17\u00b0C, March~16\u00b0C) was compared separately with the country (Canada) with lowest average temperature (January~-3\u00b0C, February~-5\u00b0C, March~-2\u00b0C) for the month of March 2020 ( Figure 5B : Top Left and Top Right). Again, no significant correlation between temperatures and cases confirmed positive, dead or recovered was observed, however, an interesting correlation pattern was seen where a drop in correlation (~0.5) was found between cases confirmed and recovered in Australia and a drop in correlation (~0.3) was found between cases confirmed and deaths in Canada. China being the earliest and highly affected country with COVID-19 transmission, separate correlation plots were generated between temperatures and cases confirmed positive, dead or recovered for the months January-March 2020 ( Figure 5B : Bottom Left, Bottom Right; Figure 5C : Left). While no significant correlation between temperatures and cases confirmed positive, dead or recovered was observed, a strong correlation between cases confirmed and recovered (~0.9), and cases confirmed and deaths (~1) was recorded. Finally, a correlation matrix ( Figure 5C : Right) for the month of March 2020 for the US was generated and again no significant correlations were observed between any of the selected variables.",

Finally, a multiple regression model was generated using predicted April 2020 temperatures with confirmed positive cases for March 2020 for Australia, Canada, China, and the US to predict the number of deaths in April 2020.
