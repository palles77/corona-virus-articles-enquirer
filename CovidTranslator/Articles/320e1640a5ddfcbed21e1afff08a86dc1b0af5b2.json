The infection may directly impact cardiovascular disease (CVD). Preexisting cardiovascular disease (CVD) may predispose to COVID-19 infection. Those with CVD who are infected by the virus have an elevated risk of adverse outcomes; and infection, itself, is associated with cardiovascular complications (4) (5) (6) . Moreover, COVID-19 infection may also have numerous indirect effects relevant to CV health. The large numbers of infected people requiring care may impact optimal treatment delivery to patients with acute CV conditions. Therapeutics for COVID-19 have the potential for adverse CV effects and clinicians delivering CV care are at risk of developing the illness or become vectors for the infection. The objective of this review is to characterize the CV impact of COVID-19, its potential consequences in patients with established CVD, as well as considerations for individual patients (with and without COVID- 19) , health care workers, and health systems, as understanding and addressing these issues will be crucial to optimize outcomes during the current critical period and beyond.",

Since the initial epicenter for this outbreak was from China, the majority of data on patients with COVID-19 are from this region. Although a systematic attempt was made to include reports and viewpoints from other heavily affected countries, data related to CV risk factors or presentation were limited. This is important, since the testing strategies, care seeking behavior, and hospitalization thresholds vary in different settings and can bias numerators and denominators, influencing estimates of the impact of the virus. This selection bias in testing, care and reporting can lead to differences in prevalence estimates of pre-existing risk factors and patient presentation across the reports from various countries. Further, the majority of the existing analyses, including those related to CV complications of COVID-19 are based on retrospective and often single-center series. Accordingly, data elements were usually reported via chart review, without external prospective ascertainment. No published or completed prospective cohort studies or randomized controlled trials were present in this literature search. These issues have important implications for research priority setting, and for interpretations of the results reported herein. There is an urgent need for high quality research in this area, but at this point it is useful to review the available data.",

A number of SARS-related coronaviruses have been discovered in bats, and a working theory is that bats may have been the initial zoonotic host for SARS-CoV2 given that its genome is 96.2% identical to a bat coronavirus (8) . Studies have demonstrated that SARS-CoV2 as well as other coronaviruses can use the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) protein for cell entry. ACE2 is a type I integral membrane protein which serves many important physiologic functions. It is highly expressed in lung alveolar cells, providing the main entry site for the virus into human hosts (8, 9) . After ligand binding, SARS-CoV2 enters cells via receptor-mediated endocytosis in a manner akin to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (10) . ACE2 also serves a role in lung protection and therefore viral binding to this receptor deregulates a lung protective pathway, contributing to viral pathogenicity (11) . Figure 1 depicts the potential mechanisms for ACE2 with regard to viral pathogenicity and lung protection, as well as the potential effects on this from renin-angiotensinaldosterone inhibition as noted in the section on Drug Therapy and COVID-19 below.",

The infectivity of COVID-19 is greater than that of influenza, with an estimated R 0 value (the basic reproduction number, representing viral infectivity) of 2.28 (14) . Notably, the death rate associated with COVID-19 is also considerably higher compared with the most recent WHO estimate of seasonal influenza mortality rate of less than 0.1%, and may reach much higher rates in elderly patients, those with comorbidities, and absent efficient intensive care support (13) . While other zoonotic coronaviruses, including the 2002-2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV), had higher associated case fatality rates of 9.6% and 34.4%, respectively (15), COVID-19 has resulted in many more deaths than both of these prior outbreaks combined, an issue that is in part related to the greater infectivity and higher attack rate of this virus, leading to a larger number of infected patients (15, 16) . Uncertain and inconsistent disease ascertainment have resulted in variability in reported case fatality rates for several reasons, including: 1) the disease may be asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic in a large proportion of patients (15) , 2) inadequate testing capabilities in most geographies, leading to frequent underdiagnosis, especially in patients with less serious illness, and 3) complications and death often ensue much later than contagion (typically between 2 and 3 weeks after infection). Notably, the appraisal of SARS-CoV-2 infection may be further complicated by asymptomatic infection in a sizable portion of individuals (as many as 20%), which may significantly contribute to further spread of infection (17) The (18), although knowledge of the clinical feature of the disease is evolving daily (1, 19) . In severe cases, COVID-19 may present as pneumonia, the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), with or without both distributive and cardiogenic shock, to which elderly populations with preexisting medical comorbidities are the most vulnerable (1, 6, 19, 20) . Notably while rates of concomitant infections with other viruses and bacterial superinfections in preliminary data appear low (15) , patients with the most severe clinical presentations are likely still at risk for co-infections, and unsurprisingly, worse outcomes have been noted in such cases (20, 21) . Children account for the minority of laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 in China and appear to be less susceptible to severe disease, possibly due to stronger innate immunity, fewer comorbidities, differences in maturation of viral receptors, and/or prior exposure to other coronavirus species (22) . However, moderate-to-severe illness has been described in children as well (23) . Moreover, it is not clear how often children were being tested.",

Moreover, there is marked variation in testing by country. A number of studies in the available literature suggest an association between preexisting CVD and severe COVID-19, which are summarized in Tables 1 and 2 . A meta-analysis of six studies inclusive of 1,527 patients with COVID-19 examined the prevalence of CVD and reported the prevalence of hypertension, cardiac and cerebrovascular disease, and diabetes to be 17.1%, 16.4%, and 9.7%, respectively (4). Patients who required intensive care unit (ICU) admission were more likely to have these comorbidities compared to non-ICU patients. Increased case-fatality rates in the previously referenced analysis of 44,672 confirmed COVID-19 cases from Wuhan, China were noted in patients with CVD (10.5%), diabetes (7.3%), hypertension (6.0%), all notably higher than the overall case-fatality rate of 2.3% (15) . Several smaller cohort studies have yielded similar results suggesting higher risk for adverse events in patients with CVD who contract COVID-19, although biases related to testing and standardized data apply here as well (1, 19, (25) (26) (27) (28) . Notably, while reports outside of China are limited, data from Italy suggest similar mortality rates and an elevated risk for death in patients with comorbidities (29) . As emerging international data become available, analysis from multinational cohorts can help inform risk stratification for severe disease especially for patients with prior CVD.",

For instance, age is the strongest risk factor for CVD and the effect of aging on immune function may be equally important for COVID-19 suceptibility and severity. Exemplary of this, the effect of age on the immune system is exemplified by low protective titers among 50% of adults older than 65 who receive the influenza vaccine (30, 31) . Other traditional CVD risk factors such as diabetes and hyperlipidemia impact immune function, and conversely, dysregulated immunologic status corresponds with elevated risk of incident CVD (32) (33) (34) (35) . Thus, prevalent CVD may be a marker of accelerated immunologic aging/dysregulation and relate indirectly to COVID-19 prognosis. An increased frequency of adverse CVD events post COVID-19 infection might also play a role in prognosis, similar to other viral infections such as influenza with mechanistic underpinnings which are complex, multi-factorial, and bi-directional (36, 37) . In addition, COVID-19 infection may trigger pathways unique to this pathogen which contribute to outcomes in CVD patients. For instance, higher expression of ACE2 in patients with hypertension and CVD has been postulated to enhance susceptibility to SARS-CoV2, although the data are conflicting and without clear suggestion for treatment ( Figure 1 ) (5) . Additional study is needed to understand the potential mechanistic relationships between CVD and COVID-19 outcomes.",

The predominant clinical presentation of COVID-19 is acute respiratory illness, which may lead to ARDS manifested as ground-glass opacities on chest imaging (54) and hypoxemia. However, similar features may be seen in the case of de novo or coexisting cardiogenic pulmonary edema. As such, it is important consider cardiogenic or mixed cardiac plus primary pulmonary causes of respiratory manifestations in COVID-19. Historically, right heart catherization was used to determine pulmonary capillary wedge pressure in order to aid in this distinction, although this has been removed from the Berlin criteria used for the diagnosis of ARDS. Rather, the Berlin criteria utilize timing of symptom onset, imaging with bilateral pulmonary opacities, and lack of volume overload to identify patients with ARDS (55) . In many cases, serum brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and echocardiography can help clarify the diagnosis (56, 57) . However, if these tests are unclear and there remains concern for mixed presentation, pulmonary artery catheterization should be considered in select cases to assess filling considered. The optimal thromboprophylactic regimen for patients hospitalized with COVID-19 related illness is not known. As such, contemporary guideline endorsed strategies should be observed (61) . Given the drug-drug interactions between some antiviral treatments and direct oral anticoagulants, low molecular weight heparins, or unfractionated heparin with or without mechanical prophylaxis are likely to be preferred in acutely ill hospitalized patients.",

One important mechanism to help prevent transmission is the use of telemedicine. This technology, already utilized by numerous large health care systems around the world, is ideal in public health crises as it allows for patients to be triaged while minimizing exposure of patients and health care workers to potential infection. Additionally, telemedicine provides an opportunity for specialists that might not otherwise be available to evaluate patients. While there are currently barriers to the widespread implementation of telemedicine such as coordination of testing in patients triaged as high risk, this is a technology that will likely prove important to promote viral containment (86) . Other essential principles are to minimize non-essential/non-urgent in-person provider-patient interactions as much as possible (i.e. social distancing), and limiting elective cardiac catheterization, operating room and echocardiographic procedures. If such procedures are necessary, the number of required personal should be kept to a minimum. (38, 89) . These societies as well as a number of others agree that further data would be vital to inform decisions on adjusting regimens of these agents in the setting of this outbreak (38, (89) (90) (91) (92) .

Thorough infection prevention and control measures specific to the procedural cardiology specialties must be considered in light of the COVID-19 outbreak. Such procedures are associated with the small but quantifiable risk of complications and patient deterioration. In the event of a cardiac arrest, efforts at cardiopulmonary resuscitation causing aerosolized pathogens could result in the wide dissemination of virus particles to clinicians, health care workers, and other patients. One measure which may help protect health care workers in the setting of cardiac arrest and chest compressions is the use of external mechanical compression devices to minimize direct contact with infected patients. Another important consideration for the catheterization laboratory is appropriate post-intervention cleaning of all equipment potentially contaminated with SARS-CoV2. The necessary downtime required for cleaning may seriously impact the availability of catheterization laboratory-based treatments for other patients. As such, many hospitals are minimizing or cancelling elective procedures during the growth phase of the outbreak. Another consideration is the fact that catheterization laboratories and operating rooms are typically configured with positive pressure ventilation, and there have been reports of centers in China converting such facilities to negative pressure isolation in the setting of COVID-19(84).

The true prevalence in this setting may be underreported given the logistical challenges associated with limited testing and cardiac catheterization laboratory availability in the setting of this outbreak. For further recommendations for the care and management of COVID-19 patients in the cardiac catheterization laboratory, please see the joint American College of Cardiology (ACC) and Society of Cardiovascular Angiography and Intervention (SCAI) guidance statement (51). Arrhythmia and Cardiac Arrest. Cardiac arrhythmias are another common CV manifestation described in patients with COVID-19 infection. While nonspecific, heart palpitations were part of the presenting symptomology in 7.3% of patients in a cohort of 137 patients admitted for COVID-19 disease(26). In hospitalized COVID-19 patients, cardiac arrhythmia was noted in 16.7% of 138 patients in a Chinese cohort and was more common in ICU patients compared to non-ICU patients (44.4% vs. 6.9%)(19). Unfortunately, specifics about the types of arrhythmias that occur in these patients are yet to be published or presented. High prevalence of arrhythmia might be, in part, attributable to metabolic disarray, hypoxia, neurohormonal or inflammatory stress in the setting of viral infection in patients with or without prior CVD. However, new onset of malignant tachyarrhythmias in the setting of troponin elevation should raise suspicion for underlying myocarditis",

Finally, it is crucial to determine whether or not a concomitant cardiogenic component is present when considering mechanical respiratory and circulatory support with extracorporeal membranous oxygenation (ECMO) or other techniques, as this may lend to changes in device selection (e.g. venovenous vs. venoarterial ECMO cannulation). Regardless, in the most severe of infections with ARDS and necrotizing pneumonias, patient prognosis may be poor even with ECMO support. In a case series of 52 critically ill patients with COVID-19, 83.3% (5/6) of patients who were treated with ECMO did not survive. Further studies regarding the utility of ECMO support in advanced COVID-19, including which patients may (or may not) benefit and whether concomitant left ventricular venting should be done, are warranted(58). thromboembolic disease. COVID-19 infected patients are likely at increased risk venous of thromboembolism (VTE). Though there are no published case series thus far, there are reports of abnormal coagulation parameters in hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 disease(59,60). In a multicenter retrospective cohort study from China, elevated D-dimer levels (>1g/L) were strongly associated with in-hospital death, even after multivariable adjustment (OR 18.4 95% CI 2.6-128.6, p=0.003)(6). In another study comparing COVID-19 survivors to non-survivors, non-survivors had significantly higher D-dimer and fibrin degradation products (FDP) levels and 71.4% of non-survivors met clinical criteria for disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) during the course of their disease(59). In addition to DIC, critically ill patients with prolonged immobilization are inherently at high risk for VTE. Vascular inflammation may also contribute to the hypercoagulable state and endothelial dysfunction in such patients. In the setting of critically ill COVID-19 patients who demonstrate clinical deterioration as evidenced by hypoxia or hemodynamic instability, thromboembolic disease should be",

As these drugs are being studied, it is important to review the potential CV side effects and interactions with other CV medications.at risk for conduction abnormalities including those taking other QT prolonging drugs(65). Both ribavirin and lopinavir/ritonavir have the potential to affect anticoagulant dosing: ribavirin has variable effects on warfarin dosing(66) and lopinavir/ritonavir may require dose reductions or avoidance of CYP3A-Lopinavir/ritonavir can also influence the activity of P2Y12 inhibitors through CYP3A4 inhibition, which results in decreased serum concentrations of the active metabolites of clopidogrel and prasugrel and increased serum concentrations of ticagrelor. Given the increase in serum ticagrelor levels with such medications (69,70), concomitant use with ticagrelor is discouraged in the United States and Canada due to excess in bleeding risk. Conversely, there is evidence that clopidogrel may not always provide sufficient platelet inhibition in the setting of concomitant administration of lopinavir/ritonavir, Remdesivir is an investigational drug previously evaluated in the Ebola epidemic and is now being studied in patients with COVID-19. The drug is currently available in clinical trials and through compassionate use from Gilead Sciences, Inc (Foster City, California). While extensive CV toxicities and medication interactions have yet to be reported, prior evaluation of this drug during the Ebola outbreak did note the development of hypotension and subsequent cardiac arrest after loading dose in one patient Other treatments.Table 4presents information on other treatments being studied for COVID-19 (including ClinicalTrials.gov identifiers). In addition to antiviral medications, numerous immunemodulating and secondary medications to prevent complications that could arise from COVID-19 are currently being investigated. Chloroquine, which has been used as an antimalarial agent, blocks virus infection by increasing the endosomal pH required for virus/cell fusion, and has been demonstrated in concentration of drug requiring careful monitoring for heart rate and blood pressure shifts. Lastly, both agents are associated with a conditional risk of torsade des pointes in patients with electrolyte abnormalities or with concomitant use of QT prolonging agents. Short-term exposure to these agents, as would be expected in treatment of COVID-19, confers lower risk of these dose-duration dependent side effects.",
