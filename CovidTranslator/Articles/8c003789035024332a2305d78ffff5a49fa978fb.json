To develop an antigen that is specific, sensitive, and easy to prepare for serological diagnosis, antigenic sites in the SADS-CoV nucleocapsid (N) protein were screened. We generated and characterized an N-reactive monoclonal antibody (mAb) 3E9 from mice immunized with recombinant N protein.",

Protein sequence alignment indicated that 343 DAPVFTPAP 351 was highly conserved in different SADS-CoV strains and SADS-related coronaviruses from bat, with one substitution in this motif in HKU2-related bat coronavirus. Using mAb 3E9, we observed that N protein was expressed in the cytoplasm and was in the nucleolus during SADS-CoV replication. N protein was immunoprecipitated from SADS-CoV-infected Vero E6 cells. Taken together, our results indicated that 3E9 mAb could be a useful tool to investigate the structure and function of N protein during viral replication.",

The other third codes structural proteins that build up the coronavirion. All CoVs contain a common set of structural proteins: N, spike, membrane and envelope (Lai, 1990) . In infected cells, N protein is the most abundant of the viral proteins (He et al., 2004) . N protein is involved in structure and RNA synthesis (Almazan et al., 2004; Enjuanes et al., 2006) . In the virion, nucleoprotein molecules associate with viral RNA to form the helical nucleocapsid (Nelson et al., 2000) . CoVs N protein contains both nuclear localization and export signals (Rowland et al., 2005; Timani et al., 2005; You et al., 2005) suggesting shuttling of the protein between the nucleus and the cytoplasm in virus-infected cells. Nucleolar localization of other coronavirus nucleoproteins is reported in transfected cells (Chang et al., 2004; Shi et al., 2014; You et al., 2005) . However, inconsistent data were obtained about the presence of N protein in the nucleus of virus-infected cells with some studies seeing no evidence of nuclear localization (Laude and Masters, 1995) .",

The specificity of mAb 3E9 was tested using western blot and cell lysates infected with transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV), porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), or SADS-CoV. Hybridoma 3E9 mAb proved to be strictly SADS-CoV specific (Fig. 3A) . To further determine mAb specificity, cell transfected with pCMV-Myc-N plasmid were analyzed by western blot using mAb 3E9 as the primary antibody. MAb 3E9 specifically reacted with eukaryotically expressed N protein but not with samples from empty plasmid pCMV-Myc transfections (Fig. 3B ). in vitro neutralization tests showed that mAb 3E9 was not a neutralizing antibody (data not shown). Immunoprecipitation assays determined if SADS-CoV N protein could be precipitated from SADS-CoV-infected Vero E6 cells using mAb 3E9. The mAb precipitated SADS-CoV N protein from SADS-CoV-infected Vero E6 cells but not from mock-infected Vero E6 cells (Fig. 3C) . We also noticed that the extent of SADS-CoV N cleavage varied with experiments and was determined primarily by the extent of viral infection or viral propagation conditions (e.g., trypsin addition) (Fig. 3C ). SADS-CoV N expressed from an expression plasmid (pCMV-Myc-N) yielded only one major band at the expected size of full-length SADS-N (Fig. 3B) .

Virus Research 273 (2019) 197752 conserved nature of these epitopes in N would be an advantage in developing technologies for epitope-based diagnoses. MAb 3E9 against SADS-CoV N protein could be used in various assays. For example, mAb 3E9 showed that SADS-CoV N protein localizes to the cytoplasm and also to the nucleolus in infected cells and cells expressing only N protein alone (Fig. 4) . During infection, a number of viral proteins interact with the nucleolus (Shi et al., 2017) . The interaction of viral proteins with nucleolar antigens may explain why viral proteins have been observed in the nucleolus and the viral exploitation of nucleolar function that leads to alterations in host cell transcription and translation and disruption of the host cell cycle to facilitate viral replication. MAb 3E9 immunoprecipitated N protein from lysates of SADS-CoV infected Vero E6 cells (Fig. 3C ). The capacity of mAb 3E9 to immunoprecipitate N protein will promote further studies on interactions of N protein with viral and cellular proteins. In summary, a specific mAb 3E9 against SADS-CoV N protein was produced and linear B-cell epitopes in the N protein CTD were identified. Subcellular localization of the N protein was observed using mAb 3E9. The mAb was also used to immunoprecipitate N protein from lysates of SADS-CoV infected Vero E6 cells. MAb 3E9 and its epitope identified in this study will be useful for clinical applications and as a tool for further study of SADS-CoV detection and diagnosis. Taken together, our findings provide a solid foundation for further investigations into the antigenic functions of SADS-CoV N protein and the development of diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to SADS-CoV infection.

For the first round, three peptides spanning the N protein at aa 1-146 (N1), 147-249 (N2), and 250-376 (N3) were expressed. For the second round, peptide aa 250-376 was divided into two peptides, aa 250-310 (N4) and 311-376 (N5), for expression. For the last round, aa 311-376 was divided into six overlapping peptides, then decreased one by one from both ends until the minimal linear epitope was identified. (A) MAb 3E9 recognized the entire N protein (367 aa) and N3 peptide (aa 250-376). (B) In the second identification round, N5 peptide was further minimized.
