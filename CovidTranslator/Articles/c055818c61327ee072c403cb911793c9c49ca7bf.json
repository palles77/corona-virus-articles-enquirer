Complexed antigen, in fact, is taken up with high efficiency thanks to Fc receptors borne by APC . Antibody/antigen ratio in the complexes proved to be a critical parameter in enhancing antigen presentation . Complexes in moderate antibody excess provided optimal T cell activation independently of the physical state of the complexes {precipitated by a second antibody or solubilized by complement) . Complexes in extreme antibody excess, on the contrary, did not yield T cell activation although taken up by APC efficiently. The effect of antibodies at extreme excess was observed with substimulatory dose of antigen (loss of potentiation) and with optimal dose of antigen (loss of stimulation). An excess of specific polyclonal antibodies hampers proteolytic degradation of antigen in vitro, supporting the view that a similar mechanism may operate within the APC that have internalized immune complexes in extreme antibody excess. The possibility that immune complex forming in extreme antibody excess may turn off the T cell response is proposed as a regulatory mechanism .",

More recently, it has been demonstrated that antibodies complexed with soluble antigens interfere with the T cell response . Inhibitory effect has been reported in the cytochrome system (3, 4) , but enhanced T cell response has been observed when antibodies bound with antigen promote Fc receptor-mediated recognition by APC (5, 6) . Complexed antibodies can also influence the fine specificity of the T cell response (7, 8) , possibly by modulating the processing pattern of antigen internalized by APC in complexed form (9, 10) and the subsequent spectrum ofpeptides that are made available for MHC binding and presentation to T cells. These mechanisms affect the selection of the T repertoire and offer a linkage between the previous experience of the immune system and the current response .",

The effect of complexing antigen with specific polyclonal antibodies on presentation by macrophages to a specific T hybridoma clone is illustrating in Fig. 1 . Exposing T cells to antigen alone results in detectable stimulation only when antigen concentration is >3 Ag/ml (Fig. 1 a) . In contrast, in the presence of rabbit anti-GZ (RaGZ) polyclonal antibodies at 1 :250 and 1 :50 dilution, antigen concentration of 0.3 htg/ml is stimulatory (b and c) . Higher antibody concentration inhibits potentiation (d) and also prevents presentation of a stimulatory dose of antigen (e) . When appropriate complexes are used (1 :50 RaGZ, 1 Ftg/ml GZ ; (c), the peak production of IL-2 is higher than in the presence of optimal concentration of free antigen at 10 Ag/ml. This suggested that we explore more accurately the effect of antigen/antibody ratio in the system . Effect ofAntigen/Antibody Rutia GZ was mixed with increasing concentrations of RaGZ. The precipitation curve (Fig.  2 , solid line) was determined, and the macrophage-mediated stimulatory effect of the various complexes on T cells was evaluated as shown in Fig. 2 a. The dashed line indicates IL-2 production by T cells in the presence of immune complexes at the same ratios as used for the precipitation experiment . Similar curves were obtained with three additional T hybridoma clones (data not shown) . In all cases, optimal stimulation was obtained with complexes in moderate antibody 39 Manca et al. To eliminate any potential interference of serum proteins other than antibodies, the experiment was repeated with affinity-purified antibodies. Fig. 2 b confirms that in this case also, complexes with extreme antibody excess are no longer effective for potentiation, and that potentiation occurs with complexes at optimal ratio (equivalence or moderate excess) . Figure 3 . T cells respond to antigen complexed at optimal ratio at a 2-log lower dose than antigen alone. Complexes corresponding to optimal ratio (solid circles) and to extreme antibody excess (open circles) in Fig . 2 were prepared with GZ and with RaGZ . After incubation for 1 h, the complexes were serially diluted and tested for capacity to induce T cell activation. Final concentration of complexed or free antigen (squares) is on the abscissa. As little as 0 .015 t~g/ml GZ induces a detectable stimulation of T cells . GZ at stimulatory concentration when in free form (8 tug/ml) no longer stimulates when complexed in extreme antibody excess . Fig. 3 shows a titration curve ofcomplexes at different ratios. Complexes were prepared by mixing the reactants and were diluted after incubation . As little as 15 ng/ml antigen can be detected in complexes with optimal ratio. In contrast, complexes with excess antibodies were nonstimulatory even when final antigen concentration was stimulatory by itself. This indicates that antibody excess blocks potentiation in the first case and inhibits presentation in the second case.",

For this purpose, APC were pulsed with GZ complexes at optimal ratio. After washing, immune rabbit serum was added to the pulsed APC at the concentration corresponding to antibody excess, along with responding T cells. As shown in Table 1 , large antibody excess has no effect on T cell activation when APC had been pulsed with complexes at optimal antigen/antibody ratio. Therefore, the effect is due nei- ther to toxicity for APC nor to masking of processed antigen by free antibody in excess . Role ofFc Receptors in the Mechanisms of Potentiation. To confirm that potentiation is due to uptake of complexed antigen by APC via FcR in the case of polyclonal antibodies, as previously demonstrated with mAbs (8), we used anti-FcR mAbs or HAGG to functionally block FcR on APC . Fig . 4 a and b) is not affected by either reagent, indicating that only uptake of complexed antigen is FcR dependent . Furthermore, immune complexes of transferrin and antitransferrin at different ratios were also tested . Fig. 4 c shows that complexes in antibody excess inhibit T cell activation induced by a suboptimal dose of antigen complexed with specific antibodies at optimal ratio for potentiation, but T cell activation induced by an optimal dose of free GZ is not affected. This is consistent with the concept that potentiation depends on availability of FcR and that complexes in large antibody excess do not \"engulf\" the APC. Role ofComplement Receptors in the Mechanism ofPotentiation. Since FcRpositive APC also bear complement receptors, we tested whether complement activation by immune complexes could further facilitate uptake and presentation. Addition of rabbit, guinea pig, or human complement to immune complexes provides additional potentiation at low doses of antigen (Fig. 5) .",

FcRI is a 70-kD glycoprotein with high affinity for monomeric IgG (26) . Nevertheless, binding ofmonomeric polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies by APC was not evident when tested in a functional assay in which antigen was given immediately after pulsing with monomeric antibodies and T cell activation was used to measure antigen presentation (Fig. 6 ). In particular, mAb D6C9, used for this experiment was previously reported to behave similarly to polyclonal antibodies, in that large excess in the complexes prevents activation of T clone 1.7.1 (8) . This effect of mAb D6C9 was not evident with other T clones, suggesting that in the presence of this mAb processing of antigen is influenced in such a way that only the epitope recognized by clone 1.7.1 was not effectively presented. In this respect, interference by an excess ofmonoclonal and polyclonal antibodies may differ. mAbs may affect appropriate processing of one limited region of the antigen, as described in the myoglobin system (7), whereas polyclonal antibodies may interfere with the overall degradation of the antigen molecule. FcRII, a 40-kB glycoprotein, has low affinity for monomeric IgG, and is more specific for complexed Igs. FcRII is recognized by mAb 2AG2 (27) , which inhibits potentiation almost completely. Therefore, FcRII is a candidate to be the most relevant receptor for potentiation . Murine FcRIII is poorly characterized and does not seem to participate effectively in potentiation when FcRII is blocked by monoclonal 2AG2.",

Interferences of antibodies with intracellular degradation of TT taken up by monoclonal antigen-specific lymphoblastoid lines confirms that mAbs can modulate antigen processing (9), as we previously proposed (8) . In particular, monoclonal B lymphoblastoid cells with different fine specificities for TT generate different degradation products upon uptake and internalization ofantigen mediated by the surface Ig receptor (10) . It is likely that in the case of polyclonal antibodies, which bind to different epitopes on the antigen molecule, this protective mechanism is even more efficient .",

Furthermore, when complexes in large antibody excess are presented to APC, many FcR are engaged to internalize immune complexes that contain a low amount of antigen relative to the number of Ig molecules, suggesting the functional concept of much work for a poor catch. The interference of unrelated immune complexes (transferrin-antitransferrin) in large antibody excess with FcR-mediated potentiation, but not with presentation of an optimal dose of free antigen, indicates that lack of stimulation by antibody excess complexes is not due to nonspecific functional engulfment of APC . Potentiation in the system we describe is chiefly mediated by adherent macrophages, the major cellular component of peritoneal exudate . Nonadherent cells in the exudate capable of antigen presentation, i.e., B cells and dendritic cells, were unable to present low doses of complexed antigen . This is expected with FcR-negative dendritic cells, and the failure of FcRpositive B cells to bring about potentiation is in agreement with the observation that human B cells cannot present TT in complexed form to specific T cells (34) .",

Precipitation ofcomplexes is less likely to take place in vivo where complement exerts its solubilizing activity (19) . Antigen/antibody ratio may change at different times and in different compartments . Therefore, complexed antigen may appear in a stimulatory or a nonstimulatory form. These events may participate in the regulation of the T cell response. In particular, when boosting antigen meets with residual antibodies during a secondary response, complexes that form facilitate uptake of nonstimulatory doses of antigen by APC resulting in T cell activation. T cell clonal expansion ensues and further increases the chances for a specific T cell to encounter a specific B cell (38) .",
