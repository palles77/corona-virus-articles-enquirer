On March 11 th , 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic, and has called for aggressive actions from all countries to fight the disease. Current research has indicated that COVID-19 is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a betacoronavirus similar to the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in the genetic sequence [2] . Epidemiological evidence suggests that initially reported cases in China had a history of exposure to the Huanan seafood market [3] [4] . With the escalated spread of the infection, there has been clear evidence of human to human transmission [5] [6] . The most common symptoms include fever, dry cough and fatigue [5] [6] [7] [8] , with presence of asymptomatic, yet contagious cases [9] .",

A separate multivariate model was built by using the total number of pre-existing comorbidities as an ordinal predictor, adjusting for the same covariates.

Patients with CHD had 92% significantly higher risk of mortality in COVID-19, compared to patients without CHD (p=0.009). The estimated median survival times for those with CHD was 13 days (95% CI: 11-23 days), at lease 67 days shorter than those without CHD (p<0.001). Moreover, we estimated that COVID-19 patients with hypertension had 43% higher death risk, compared to those without hypertension (p=0.09).

We applied dynamic tracking method to fill in the unclear/missing date, but those with missing information on comorbidity condition had to be excluded. Only those common pre-existing comorbidities were evaluated in this study, since publicly reported data may contain incomplete medical information, especially when patients had several medical conditions. A study of incubation period that also used publicly reported confirmed cases pointed out that this type of data usually over-represents severe cases [45] . In general, the over-representing of severe cases has little impact on our survival analysis result to predict death risk under NCC design, since the impact of symptom severity was not of interest in this study and cases were matched with corresponding controls.",

Similarly, the estimated median survival time was significantly lower in Hubei Province, compared to those outside of Hubei Province (19.5 days vs. over 80 days, p<0.001).
