Present study reports presence and serological distribution of bovine respiratory viral infections in sheep and goats in Marmara region of Turkey. Total of 388 sera, 228 from sheep and 160 from goats collected from 4 provinces were analysed. Neutralising antibodies specific to BVDV, BHV-1, BRSV, PI-3, BAV-1 and BAV-3 were investigated. Among 388 serum samples 32.1% were positive for BVDV, 23.0% for BHV-1, 72.9% for BRSV, 13.2% for PI-3, 86.0% for BAV-1 and 93.0% for BAV-3. There were significant differences observed between seroprevalence rates detected in neighbouring provinces. Prevalence of BVDV specific antibodies was extremely higher (p=0.0009) in sheep, however, BHV-1 (p=0.0001) and PI-3 (p=0.0038) were more prevalent in goats. BRSV antibody prevalence was closely related to data obtained from cattle. This study demonstrates that, like in cattle herds, BRSV and adenoviruses are the possible common reason of respiratory diseases in small ruminants in the region.",

Previous investigations demonstrated that bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV), bovine parainfluenza virus 3 (PI-3), bovine herpesvirus 1 (BHV-1), bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV) and bovine adenoviruses (BAV) are the main viral agents included in respiratory infections of ruminant species. Other viruses e.g . rhinoviruses, reoviruses, enteroviruses and bovine coronavirus may also detected in respiratory infections. Although these viral agents play a preliminary role, they generally contribute with other infectious agents like bacteria and Mycoplasma spp. (Valarcher and Haaglund 2006) . Maedi and pulmonary adenomatosis are specific diseases of sheep that their symptoms localised in the lungs are developed in a long period of time.",

Serum samples were pre-diluted to be used in VNT in fallowing dilutions: 1:2 for BHV-1 and BRSV; 1:5 for BVDV and PI-3 and 1:10 for BAV serotypes. Fifty microlitres of diluted serum sample was mixed with an equal volume of virus suspension (100TCID 50 ) in 96-well microtitre plate wells as duplicates and consequently incubated in a 5% CO 2 atmosphere at 37\u00b0C. Two hours incubation was applied for BHV-1 while it was 1 hour for the other viruses. Thereafter, MDBK cell suspension (3\u00d710 5 cells/ml) was added into each well in a volume of 50 \u03bcl. In the VNT performed for anti-BRSV antibodies, Bel-26 cell cultures were previously prepared in 96-well plates. After incubation of virus suspension with diluted serum samples in a transfer plate; cell culture medium in 96-well plates was removed and 100 \u03bcl of virusserum mixture was inoculated onto cell culture at about 50% of confluence. Test results were evaluated by inverted light microscope after 5-7 days of incubation in 5% CO 2 atmosphere at 37\u00b0C. All the viruses used in present study are in cytopathogenic nature, thus, inhibition of virus growth indicated by non-destructed monolayers of cell cultures was evaluated as indicator of virus neutralization. For scoring a sample as positive for the investigated antibodies, both wells used for the same sample were asked to be free of cytopathogenic effect.",

Some of these agents are known to be transmitted between animal species, thus small ruminants may be a source of respiratory infections for cattle. This situation is important especially for small capacity family farms in which both large and small ruminant species are kept together. Wide distribution of pestivirus infection in small ruminants in different territories was reported (Graham et al. 2001; Berriatua et al. 2006; Krametter-Froetscher et al. 2007 ). There is data on the presence of BVDV infection in sheep in Turkey. Present study shows that BVDV is also common in small ruminants in Marmara region.

Due to correlation between serological prevalence rates of BRSV, sheep and goat population may also attributed to be source of infection for bovines. Virological studies may be more satisfactorily to clarify the role of these viruses on clinical cases of respiratory disease in small ruminants.",
