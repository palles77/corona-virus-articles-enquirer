The research agenda for MGs consists of a framework of fi ve major public health research directions that address issues related to reducing the risk of public health emergencies during MGs; restricting the occurrence of non-communicable and communicable diseases; minimisation of the eff ect of public health events associated with MGs; optimisation of the medical services and treatment of diseases during MGs; and development and application of modern public health measures. Implementation of the proposed research topics would be expected to provide benefi ts over the medium to long term in planning for MGs.",

[2] [3] [4] [5] Major MGs are likely to involve communities from diff erent parts of the world. Participants and host and home communities face health risks that are of international concern. Therefore, the control of infectious diseases and provision of medical services for non-communicable dis eases and other risks to health are increasingly important in the planning for MGs. Risks commonly associated with MGs include health systems having to accom modate a surge in capacity; challenges to existing health interventions; introduction and transmission of non-endemic diseases during and after MGs; diffi culties associated with risk communication to participants from diff erent cultures; and those arising because of the high profi le of some events, such as security risks.",

Much research into existing and emerging infectious diseases is devoted to the development of rapid diagnostic methods, surveillance and response, and treatment and vaccines. Although a research agenda based on public health must be underpinned by basic science, applied science and operational research are areas of particular interest to the organisers of MGs and the decision makers for public health, especially those in poorly resourced countries. The modern day idea of MG health has developed from the notion that \"mass gatherings medicine is concerned with the provision of emergency medical care at organized events with >1000 people in attendance\" 18 to include several specialties (fi gure). The intricate interactions between the diff erent specialties is essential for the planning and success of MGs.

The main challenge during MGs is the existence of systematic operative capacities such as risk assessment plans, coordinating mechanisms and standard procedures, institutional capacities, legislation and budgets, skilled Vaccination is highly eff ective in the prevention of infectious diseases. However, many countries, particularly those with insuffi cient resources, have not developed strategies for vaccinating their populations at risk and people travelling to MGs. The reason is partly related to the lack of information about the transmission of infectious diseases (eg, infl uenza) and the social, economic, and health eff ects to the host and home communities. Public health authorities need to decide how to eff ectively prioritise vaccine use on the basis of available information about disease burden and severity, epidemiology, and vaccine eff ectiveness and safety for vaccine-preventable infections associated with MGs. 6 A failure to promote and implement the polio vaccination programme caused the re-emergence of poliovirus in Nigeria and subsequent international spread, 35,36 emphasising the risks associated with insuffi cient vaccine coverage for participants at MGs. An outbreak of Neisseria meningitides serogroup A (originating from Africa) during the Hajj in 1987 37 was later successfully controlled with the introduction of mandatory pretravel vaccination and use of fl uoroquinolones among African pilgrims. 38 However, there are infectious diseases, including some of the most important and most dangerous, for which there are no vaccines.",

The SARS outbreak in 2003 reinforced the idea that a timely and transparent public information policy could help reduce excessive and inappropriate public health responses and minimise the social disruption and economic consequences of a fast-moving global epidemic. 49, 50 Increased investment in identifying eff ective approaches and developing and assessing new communication methods will benefi t risk prevention and control eff orts. The specifi c challenge is to provide clear, credible, and appropriate communication to meet the needs of diverse communities and retain public trust in a dynamic yet unknown process. 51, 52 Some of the main research topics in this specialty include the link between communication and behaviour change models; development and assessment of methods that can be quickly accessed and used in MGs; and assessment of best practices, challenges, and barriers in risk Research in early detection and monitoring of disease \u2022 Identify, develop, and adapt modern technologies for early detection of outbreaks of communicable diseases and their application in disease surveillance during MGs \u2022 Integrate and continuously assess innovative approaches and channels for disease surveillance and monitoring \u2022 Develop effi cient mechanisms to address the global challenges to sharing information, data, and details about pathogens identifi ed during outbreaks at MGs in terms of local, ethical, legal, and research perspectives \u2022 Defi ne the timeliness and quality of data required for early detection of disease from local to district, regional, national, and global levels",

In the future, the focus should be on strategies directed towards developing common research frameworks and defi nitions.
