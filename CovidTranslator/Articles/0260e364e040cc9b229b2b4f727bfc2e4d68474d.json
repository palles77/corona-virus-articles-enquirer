So traditional medicine is still the mainstay of health care and most drugs come from plants. Although many plants have long been recognized and widely used in Nepalese traditional medicine, some are relatively unexplored and not arrived to mainstream medicine (1) . Therefore, the search on new drugs must be continued and natural products from plants, microorganisms, fungi and animals can be the source of innovative and powerful therapeutic agents for newer, safer and affordable medicines (2, 3) . On the other hand the screening of plants as a possible source of antiviral drugs has led to the discovery of potent inhibitors of in vitro viral growth (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) .",
