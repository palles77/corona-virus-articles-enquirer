Measuring the health of populations is fundamental to improving their health status. Traditionally, public health deals with the health of populations, while the New Public Health deals with the health of both individuals and population groups. This chapter discusses how measurements are used to describe, analyze, prescribe, and justify interventions to protect and improve the health of populations and of individuals, and to monitor the outcomes of interventions.",

The field has broadened to include social demography, which has a broader focus on economic, social, cultural, and biological factors, an important aspect of the New Public Health because of the vital role that risk factors, which are deeply affected by social conditions, play in health protection and disease prevention. Epidemiology measures the distribution, causes, control, and outcomes of disease in population groups. It provides the basic tools for quantification of the extent of disease, its patterns of change, and associated risk factors. Epidemiology also provides basic information needed for planning, evaluating, and managing health services. Other disciplines provide additional information and insights needed for community and national health assessment. These include the social sciences (sociology, psychology, anthropology, and economics), as well as clinical fields such as pediatrics and geriatrics, and basic sciences such as microbiology, immunology, and genetics.",

Demography is based on vital statistics reporting and special surveys of population size and density; it measures trends over time. It includes indices such as fertility, birth, and death rates; rural-urban residential patterns; marriage and divorce rates and migrations; and their interaction with social and economic conditions. Since public health deals with disease as it occurs in the population, the definition of populations and their characteristics is fundamental. Vital statistics include births; deaths; and population by age, gender, location of residence, marital status, socioeconomic status (SES), and migration. Birth data are derived from mandatory reporting of births and mortality data from compulsory death certificates. Other sources of data include population registries, including marriage/divorce, adoption, emigration, and immigration, residential patterns, as well as census data, economic and labor force statistics, and data from special household surveys conducted by home visits, telephone, or electronic media methods.",

It is an enumeration of the population, recording the identity of all people in every residence at a specified time. The census provides important information on all members of the household, including age, date of birth, gender, occupation, national origin, marital status, income, relation to head of the household, literacy, education level, and health status (e.g., permanent disabling conditions). The census also covers residents of health and social facilities such as nursing homes or similar care facilities. Other information on the home and its facilities may be included. A census may assign people according to their location at the time of the enumeration (de facto) or to the usual place of residence (de jure). A census tract is the smallest geographic area for which census data are aggregated and published. Data for larger geographic areas (metropolitan/regional statistical areas) are also published. More extensive data may be collected for representative samples of the population. These surveys are carried out over a period of years by a specialized national agency (e.g., Bureau of the Census in the USA and the Central Bureau of Statistics, Office of Population, Censuses and Surveys in the UK).",

Economic prosperity, efficient and easily available methods of birth control, and greater education and work opportunities for women in the workforce are major factors in choices made in terms of the number of children a woman wishes to have, and her right to determine the number and spacing of pregnancies. In some countries, access to prenatal diagnosis of the gender of the fetus has resulted in wide-scale abortion of females because of birth policies, with parental preference for male children in China and India as examples. This is resulting in a major numerical deficiency of young women in the population with many attendant social and political effects.

Changes in the status of women, and sexual and reproductive health standards and methods have contributed to changing birth patterns and expectations of family size in evolving societies.

This is in contrast with the high ranking in Human Development Index (HDI) measures and the high level of expenditure on health. The reasons for this are debated: most attribute it to a lack of universal health coverage, but the regional variations in mortality rates seen in the USA suggest that the key issues include differences in diet and life habits. Life expectancies are as much as 5 years longer in other high-income countries such as Singapore, Japan, Israel, Scandinavia, 1900 1910 1920 1930 1940 1950 1960 1970 1980 1990 Canada, and the UK than for the US population. Figure 3 .5 shows life expectancy at the age of 45 since 1970: it has risen steadily with variation between western countries, including Western European countries, with the Central and Eastern European countries also rising, but the countries of the former Soviet Union lagging well behind. Life expectancy is also used in chronic disease epidemiology to summarize patterns of mortality and survival in a population, such as people with breast cancer. This is important in clinical epidemiology where studies of effectiveness of specific interventions are assessed. Life expectancy is quite different for males and females; thus, gender is an important factor in the assessment of disease prevalence and also in the effectiveness of interventions.",

The World Bank estimates that 215 million people, or 3 percent of the world's population, are living in countries other than their home countries. Internal migration has even more importance for the development of many countries, with huge transfers of the rural population to urban settings. Developing countries, where more than 80 per cent of the world's population live, are a significant source of international migration to industrialized countries as people search for better opportunities in more developed economies and for political freedom in stable civil societies. In aging western societies, migration provides young workers to sustain jobs that local educated young people avoid. High birth rates in poor countries and stagnant economies offer little opportunity to young adults in many developing countries. Migration is a modest but complex and important factor in demography. Vastly differing birth rates, together with increased life expectancy in most regions, are important factors in regional differences in population growth and aging which affect the supply of labor. As the twentieth century drew to a close, the rate of global population growth began to fall, due primarily to continuing declines in population replacement and declining fertility rate, but partially offset by longevity and an aging population.",

Potentially dangerous infectious diseases can be transmitted far from their original habitat with the rapid transportation and movement of populations, including migrants, tourists, and other travelers around the globe. Other infectious diseases are becoming resistant to available treatments, and multidrug-resistant (MDR) infectious diseases, especially tuberculosis (TB), are emerging. The HIV/AIDS epidemic (see Chapter 4) created a new and deadly situation with a worldwide pandemic. The epidemic rose to vast proportions in the 1990s but appears to have peaked and fallen since 2000, although it is still spreading in Central and Eastern Europe. Globally, 34 million people are living with HIV, including 3.3 million children, and 1.7 million people died of AIDS-related illnesses in 2011 (Figure 3.8) . There are an estimated 2.5 million new infections globally per year, but this is a reduction of over 20 percent since 2001. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) is holding down the epidemic through treatment and preventing further spread. Progress in reducing maternal-infant HIV transmission by ART drugs, now used widely in Africa by international donor agencies, has been a very impressive achievement. This experience gives cause for cautious optimism, but economic recession may slow this process.",

A study of late-stage diagnosis of colorectal cancer in New York State showed that women and African Americans were more likely to have late-stage cancer than men and whites. Individuals living in areas of low SES were significantly more likely to be diagnosed at a later stage than those living in higher SES areas. Similar patterns of socioeconomic disparity in mortality have been shown among men in the state of S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, with the poor having three times greater rates of mortality than the wealthy minority. In the UK, regional differences in mortality patterns are closely linked to socioeconomic conditions, with poverty and its associated conditions as key variables despite universal access to the National Health Service (NHS). In contrast, a study in Denmark of regional and social class variation in relative risk of death showed little social variation except for people with no known address. Social inequities in health occur in virtually all societies, even those with \"universal\" access to health care, including the USA, the UK, Israel, and many others, with differences in physical access to care; differences in lifestyle and risk factors; socioeconomic conditions, and knowledge, attitudes, and practices related to health and health care. Social epidemiology in some senses reflects the nineteenth-century traditions of Virchow, Chadwick, Shattuck, and Farr (see Chapter 1), and a return to the \"miasma theory\" of disease, in which health of populations is largely determined by environmental factors of society, and that to understand causation of disease it is essential to understand its historical and social context. This social epidemiology necessarily incorporates qualitative methodologies based on the social sciences in addition to the quantitative epidemiological tools of measuring associations between exposure and disease in individuals or groups. The New Public Health integrates the qualitative and quantitative methods with management sciences based on successful applications of all these modalities to public health issues over the past century and more.",

James Lind's classic case-controlled experiment showing the nutritional cause of scurvy in 1847 opened up the field of nutritional epidemiology; and the work of Edwin Chadwick and William Farr concerning social inequity in mortality and on classification of causes of death initiated social epidemiology. Farr observed that \"Hunger destroys a much higher proportion than is indicated by the registers in this and every other country, but its effects, like the effects if excess, are generally manifested indirectly in the production of disease of various kinds\" (Whitehead, 2000) . Ramazzini's work in occupational health and Percivall Pott's identification of cancer of the scrotum among chimney sweeps opened up new areas of epidemiological investigation. Ignaz Semmelweis improved maternal health by documenting the causes of high neonatal mortality in a maternity ward, identifying a lack of hand washing by medical doctors as the culprit.

It highlights the loss to society as a result of youthful or early deaths. The figure for PYLL due to a particular cause is the sum, over all people dying of that cause, of the years that these people would have lived had they reached a specified age. DALYs are calculated by a formula that includes five main components: the duration of time lost due to a death at each age, disability weights, age weights, time preference (expressed as a discounting function), and the integration of health measures among a population. DALYs for a disease or health condition are calculated as the sum of the years of life lost (YLL) due to premature mortality in the population and the years of healthy life lost from some degree of disability (YLD) for incident cases of the health condition. For detailed procedures on how to calculate DALYs, see WHO (2001 WHO ( , 2010 . data. Assessment of reliability and validity of the data is a key part of preparing it for analysis.

Instrument standardization, observer training in common standards, and standardization of recording observations are needed to ensure acceptable standards of reliability in any data set. Measuring the same patient at different times can produce different results (as in measuring blood pressure or blood sugar), such that standardization of conditions of recording or timing the test is essential to ensure comparable data. Standardization of a test requires, as part of quality control, sending samples tested in one laboratory to a reference laboratory to see whether the test results are the same. There are three main types of bias: selection, information, and analytical bias. All other types are subtypes of these. It is worth noting that bias is a dynamic concept; that is, if no conclusion is drawn, there is no bias. This means that bias cannot be defined only based on material aspects.

The Public Health Agency of Canada publishes Canada Communicable Disease Report, as well as Chronic Diseases and Injuries in Canada for non-infectious diseases and related laboratory findings, in addition to Statistics Canada publishing annual updates on important economic, environmental health, and other databases. Many countries publish similar bulletins and annual reports vital to following trends in health status of their populations.",

One challenge in managing health systems is to monitor population health by linking multiple factors.

Macrostudies into natural changes in the socioeconomic and physical environment include investigations assessing the impact of economic change on air pollution in California over the period 1980-2000 by linking multiple data sets (Davis, 2012) , and monitoring complications from influenza vaccinations by studying Medicare claims (Burwen et al., 2012) .

In developing countries, the poverty-disease-malnutrition cycle affects children, women, and the elderly predominantly, reducing potential for economic growth. Even in industrialized countries, there is unevenness in the patterns of income and of health status; the health status of the upper social class is much better than that of the unskilled workers for many health indicators.

Mothers with higher levels of education, as measured by years of school attendance, are more likely to absorb new knowledge regarding self-care in pregnancy and care of the infant in areas such as nutrition, immunization, and routine baby care. Better educated women tend to have fewer pregnancies, not only because of knowledge of the need for and methods of birth control, but also because of greater self-awareness and different life goals. Ethnic, cultural, political, and religious beliefs and practices have important implications for health, in such areas as the status of women, mental health, family structure, nutrition, substance use and abuse, and birth control and abortion. These beliefs and practices can affect attitudes towards issues such as national health insurance and the funding of health care.

A society that acts to prevent malnutrition in vulnerable groups is acting on behalf of the vulnerable groups in the population and indicates the wellbeing of that society.

Within the USA, the surveys provide vital information for adjusting recommended dietary allowances and national, state, or local nutrition programs. This information is of great importance for the food industry, which is obliged to follow federal government standards of labeling and content of packaged and processed foods. Safety of community water, management of solid and toxic wastes, air and noise pollution, and ambient air standards are all factors in the health of the community. Organized public health has traditionally focused on these issues, but they remain public policy issues in virtually all countries and internationally. Healthy societies are dealing with these issues with a very high degree of public awareness, sometimes overcoming strong economic interest groups to force improved attention to the environment by governments, communities, and businesses. Environment includes housing, recreation, schools, businesses, parks, urban and rural planning, and many other aspects of community life that are addressed in \"healthy community\" initiatives. Employment of children and work in hazardous industries are health issues. Societies that tolerate toxic and dangerous work settings create health hazards that are preventable, but costly to treat. Unemployment, job insecurity, loss of health insurance with change of employer, job-related injury or disease, and low income levels for many workers all contribute to poor health (see Chapter 9).

Performance-based measures have become essential elements of public health policy and implementation strategies. These are generally based on professional consensus criteria determined by Delphi methods of consultation. These may be translated into \"gold standards\" and health targets. They may be used for performance monitoring and indeed administrative payment systems to encourage their complete implementation. Examples of performance indicators for payment include immunization coverage, Pap smears, and mammograms for patients registered with British general practitioners.The concept of health targets has become an essential element of US public health policy with Healthy People 2020 at the federal level with state compliance with such measures. When reviewing policy issues in public health, currently accepted practices used in other countries with recognized stature in this field should be taken into account, as well as recommendations by respected international health agencies such as WHO, UNICEF, and others. Outcome is a variable with a value which varies according to the outcome or the effectiveness of an intervention (Last, 2007) , taking into account independent variables, such as more general changes occurring in the same time-frame.
