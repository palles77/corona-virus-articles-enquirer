To determine whether lycorine has an anti-tumor effect in vivo, a series of experiments were carried out in this study. HL-60 cells (5 \u00c2 10 6 ) were inoculated i.v. into severe combined immuno-deficiency (SCID) mice after these mice had been irradiated (total body receiving 200 cGy c irradiation). Treatment was given once a day from day 2 to 6, and from day 14 to 18. Lycorine (5 or 10 mg/kg/day i.p.) was found to decrease the percentages of immature granular leukocytes and of monocytes among the peripheral blood cells, and the mean survival time of both lycorine-treated groups was longer than that of the control group. Compared with the asynchronous and cytosine arabinoside-(Ara-C) treated (20 mg/kg/day i.p.) group, treatment with lycorine was more effective. Lycorine was also found to alleviate the infiltration of tumor cells into the liver, bone, and marrow. When SCID mice inoculated with HL-60 cells were then treated with lycorine, no severe adverse effects were observed. This study revealed that lycorine, when tested in the human leukemia xenograft models, appears to exhibit anti-tumor activity in vivo and is a useful therapy against acute promyelocytic leukemia.",

In 2001, approximately 21 500 deaths (12 100 males; 9500 females) in the United States were attributed to leukemia. Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) is a common type of leukemia. At present, chemotherapeutic agents are extremely useful in treating leukemia [1e3] . Finding novel antitumor chemotherapeutic medicine derived from natural materials has become an important research objective and has been the aim of new drug designs [4] . Many natural compounds have already been found to exhibit significant anti-tumor effects. Tea polyphenols can induce HL-60 cells apoptosis [5] . G2-M arrest and antimitotic activity can mediate by casticin [6] .",

Extracts from Narcissus tazetta var. chinensis strongly decreased the survival rate of many tumor cell lines [8] . Lycorine, a natural alkaloid extracted from Amaryllidaceae, has shown various pharmacological and microbiological effects. Researchers had revealed that lycorine can inhibit protein synthesis in eukaryotic cells [9] , and acetylcholinesterase activity [10] . In the presence of calprotectin, lycorine was shown to inhibit protein synthesis and cell apoptosis in MM46 cells [11] . Lycorine was found a potent antiviral activity against Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in recent report [12] . Lycorine could effectively arrest the cell cycle at the G2/M phase and induce apoptosis in HL-60 cells [13] . After treatment of human multiple meyloma cell line KM3 with lycorine, typical apoptotic events could be observed, and the results also showed that lycorine was able to block the KM3 cell cycle at G0/G1 phase through the down-regulation of both cyclin D1 and CDK4 [14] . In our previous study, we focused on the significant anti-tumor effects of lycorine. However, the anti-tumor effect of lycorine in vivo remains unknown. Therefore, it is important to determine the therapeutic effect of lycorine on leukemia in an animal model. SCID mice are widely used in cancer research especially in antileukemia research and can provide a system model to study the biology of human leukemias and explore the efficacy of novel leukemia therapy programs [15] . Previously, a leukemia model of SCID mice was successfully set up, where human leukemia cells could be detected in the bone marrow, spleen, and lymph nodes of SCID mice in a pattern resembling that of human acute leukemia [16, 17] . In this study, the effect of lycorine on APL in vivo was evaluated in a human leukemia xenograft model (i.e., SCID mice inoculated with HL-60 cells), although such a model would not completely reflect the situation in patients with leukemia.",
