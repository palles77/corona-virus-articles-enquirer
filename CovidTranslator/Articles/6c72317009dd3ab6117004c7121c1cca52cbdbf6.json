These included outdated and vulnerable technologies; a public health workforce lacking training and reinforcements; lack of real-time surveillance and epidemiological systems; and ineffective and fragmented communications networks. 1 While considerable headway has been made since the IOM report was published, there is still evidence of a need for further improvements. A recent report by Trust for America's Health, for example, found that there are persistent gaps in the ability of state and local public health agencies to respond to events ranging from bioterrorist threats to natural disasters and disease outbreaks. 2 The question is-how can we reduce these gaps? Nationwide and globally, rapid changes in health information systems, cloud computing technologies, communications, and global connections are catalyzing a re-examination of disease surveillance as an enterprise that needs coordinated and integrated system elements. Sustainable surveillance, which we define as ongoing data collection, analysis, and application, coupled with a capability to respond to novel demands, is needed to ensure that public health agencies can perform reliably regardless of shifts in public health funding and priorities. The ISDS Sustainable Surveillance Workgroup identified the following steps to maintain and advance the public health surveillance enterprise:",

In addition, the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act, 8 legislated as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 2009, is fueling the adoption of electronic health record (EHR) systems in the U.S. 9 In return for financial subsidies to implement EHR systems, hospitals and doctors are required to share data for public health purposes 9 with the intent to improve both population health outcomes and the quality of clinical practice. Sustainable surveillance systems have the potential to advance both of these goals. 10",

The optimum mix of stability and flexibility will depend on the purpose(s) of surveillance and the particular health condition under surveillance. For example, in OJPHI the case of SARS, an effective surveillance system has the potential to decrease the size of an epidemic by one-third and the duration by 4 weeks, with significant cost savings. 25 Another study found that the early detection of an outbreak of highly infectious bacterial meningitis saved approximately $2 for every dollar invested in infectious disease surveillance. 26 Yet another evaluation of surveillance practice found that technological improvements in a sentinel influenza-like illness (ILI) surveillance system in Virginia saved over $9,500 (1,992 hours) in staff-time during the 2007-2008 influenza seasons. 27 Ongoing surveillance can also inform the design and evaluation of prevention and intervention programs in order to control the escalating costs associated with chronic diseases in the U.S. and abroad. 28 Some experts forecast that chronic disease prevention programs could save up to $48.9 billion per year by 2030, 29 while others predict applying electronic medical record implementation and networking to the prevention and management of chronic disease will exceed the currently projected $81 billion in annual savings. 30",

            "text": "Siloed surveillance systems are outdated, inefficient, and incapable of meeting today's demands for electronic data exchange and for the informatics capabilities needed to use the information for maximum benefit. Integrated programs and collaboration, on the other hand, facilitate the efficient management of the complex, varied, and proliferating issues and information sources that exist today. The nature of public health surveillance also lends itself to multiple-purpose approaches in that strategies for preventing and controlling diseases, such as West Nile virus, are to a great extent the same as for an influenza epidemic, a foodborne disease outbreak, or a bioterrorist attack. 31 Technology that enhances communication and data sharing across disease programs, surveillance systems, and even across jurisdictions increases the ease of obtaining and disseminating useful information to a broad audience, including public health agencies, healthcare providers, policymakers, and the general public. 6, 32 This rapid information exchange not only facilitates timely response, but can also reduce emergency room visits, hospital admissions, and even costs of care. 33 However, many health departments currently have systems that are not flexible enough to respond to changing health IT needs, which makes it difficult to deliver information when and where it is needed. 4 Disease or program-specific funding also exacerbates program vulnerability to funding and budgetary cuts. For example, when funding is earmarked for specific purposes (e.g., emergency preparedness and associated surveillance systems), and then is reduced, such as has occurred for public health emergency preparedness cooperative agreement funding through CDC in the past seven years, 34 it can undermine and reverse efforts to establish sustainable systems that serve multiple crosscutting purposes throughout public health.

Specifically, enterprise funding supports a reliable, flexible infrastructure that can adapt to technological and information requirement changes, and allows for ongoing data collection and the integration of new data sources to advance all-hazard preparedness. A 2004 White House memo acknowledged how programmatic funding can lead to inefficiencies and redundancies in system acquisitions and usage and called for applying technological and human resources across programs. 35 By encouraging collaboration within and between departments, surveillance professionals can take advantage of shared platforms and resources to optimize data collection, analysis, storage, and dissemination, thus helping to reduce operational costs and improve efficiency. For example, collaboration could create opportunities for the effective integration of syndromic and reportable disease data for public health use. 36",
