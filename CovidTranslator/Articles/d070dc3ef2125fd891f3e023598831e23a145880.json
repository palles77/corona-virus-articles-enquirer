We developed a data-driven drug repositioning framework, which applies both machine learning and statistical analysis approaches to systematically integrate and mine large-scale knowledge graph, literature and transcriptome data to discover the potential drug candidates against SARS-CoV-2. The retrospective study using the past SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV data demonstrated that our machine learning based method can successfully predict effective drug candidates : bioRxiv preprint against a specific coronavirus. Our in silico screening followed by wet-lab validation indicated that a poly-ADP-ribose polymerase 1 (PARP1) inhibitor, CVL218, currently in Phase I clinical trial, may be repurposed to treat COVID-19. Our in vitro assays revealed that CVL218 can exhibit effective inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV-2 replication without obvious cytopathic effect. In addition, we showed that CVL218 is able to suppress the CpG-induced IL-6 production in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, suggesting that it may also have anti-inflammatory effect that is highly relevant to the prevention immunopathology induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection. Further pharmacokinetic and toxicokinetic evaluation in rats and monkeys showed a high concentration of CVL218 in lung and observed no apparent signs of toxicity, indicating the appealing potential of this drug for the treatment of the pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. Moreover, molecular docking simulation suggested that CVL218 may bind to the N-terminal domain of nucleocapsid (N) protein of SARS-CoV-2, providing a possible model to explain its antiviral action. We also proposed several possible mechanisms to explain the antiviral activities of PARP1 inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2, based on the data present in this study and previous evidences reported in the literature. In summary, the PARP1 inhibitor CVL218 discovered by our data-driven drug repositioning framework can serve as a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of COVID-19. author/funder.

We first constructed a virus related knowledge graph consisting of drug-target interactions, protein-protein interactions and similarity networks from publically available databases (Methods). Three different types of nodes (i.e., drugs, human targets and virus targets) within the knowledge graph were connected through edges describing their interactions, associations or similarities to establish bridges of information aggregation and knowledge mining. We then applied a network-based knowledge mining algorithm to predict an initial list of drug candidates that can be potentially used to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection ( Figure 1B and Methods). Next, we further narrowed down the list of drug candidates with the previously reported evidences of antiviral activities based on the text mining results from the large-scale literature texts, which were derived through a deep learning based relation extraction method named BERE [4] ( Figure 1C and Methods), followed by a minimum of manual checking. After that, we used the connectivity map analysis approach [5] with the gene expression profiles of ten SARS-CoV-infected patients [6] to further refine the list of drug candidates against SARS-CoV-2 ( Figure 1D , Table 1, Table S1 and Methods). The above screening process revealed that a poly-ADP-ribose polymerase 1 (PARP1) inhibitor PJ-34 could potentially have the antiviral activities against SARS-CoV-2. 4 author/funder.

Apart from China, other countries or regions including South Korea, Iran, and Europe have reported a rapid increase in the number of COVID-19 cases, implying that this novel coronavirus has posed a global health threat. Under the current circumstance of the absence of the specific vaccines and medicines against SARS-CoV-2, it is urgent to discover effective therapies especially drugs to treat the resulting COVID-19 disease and prevent the virus from further spreading. Considering that the development of a new drug generally takes years, probably the best therapeutic shortcut is to apply the drug repositioning strategy (i.e., finding the new uses of old drugs) [1, 2, 3] to identify the potential antiviral effects against SARS-CoV-2 of existing drugs that have been approved for clinical use or to enter clinical trials. Those existing drugs with potent antiviral efficacy can be directly applied to treat COVID-19 in a short time, as their safety has been verified in principle in clinical trials.",

With the aid of our developed text mining tool BERE, we found that many of the drugs that had been reported previously in the literature to have antiviral activities against the corresponding coronavirus, were also among the top list of our predicted results ( Table 2) . For example, chloroquine, an FDA-approved drug for treating malaria [7] , which was previously reported to exhibit micromolar anti-SARS-CoV activity in vitro [8] , was also repurposed for targeting the same virus by our prediction framework. Gemcitabine, which was originally approved for treating certain types of cancers [9] , was also predicted for targeting SARS-CoV with validation by previous in vitro studies [10] . Cyclosporine, a calcineurin inhibitor approved as an immunomodulatory drug [11] , was observed to block the replication of SARS-CoV [12] , and also successfully predicted by our approach. Among the predicted top list for MERS-CoV, miltefosine, which was approved for treating leishmaniasis [13] , was previously identified to have anti-MERS-CoV activity [14] . Chlorpromazine and imatinib, which were used for treating schizophrenia [15] and leukemia [16] , respectively, were also selected by our computational pipeline as anti-MERS-CoV drugs and can be validated by previous in vitro experiments [10] . Thus, the above retrospective study illustrated that our computational framework is able to predict effective drug candidates against a specific coronavirus.",

In addition, an in vivo study in the Friend retrovirus (FV) mouse model showed that IL-6 blockage can reduce viral loads and enhance virus-specific CD8+ T-cell immunity [23] . These findings supported a hypothesis that rapid production of IL-6 might be a possible mechanism leading to the deleterious clinical manifestations in viral pathogenesis [24] . Recently published researches on the clinical characteristics of severe patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection showed that IL-6 was significantly elevated especially in those ICU patients, which caused excessive activated immune response [25, 26, 27, 28, 29] . The pathological role of IL-6 in SARS-CoV-2 infection indicated that IL-6 blockade may provide a feasible therapy for the treatment of COVID-19.",

Incubation of PBMCs with 1 \u00b5M CpG-ODN 1826 for 6 h (Methods) induced IL-6 production by 40%, when compared to untreated cells ( Figure 3 ).

Further study showed that CVL218 inhibited the CpG-induced IL-6 upregulation in a time-and dose-dependent manner ( Figure 3 ). More specifically, exposure with CVL218 at concentrations 1 \u00b5M and 3 \u00b5M for 12 h attenuated the CpG-induced IL-6 production by 50% and 72.65%, respectively.

We first examined the concentrations of CVL218 over different tissues in rats at different time points post oral administration at different doses (Figure S2 and Table S2 ), which was also previously reported in [30] . Among seven tissues (i.e., lung, spleen, liver, kidney, stomach, heart and brain), we observed that lung had the highest CVL218 concentration, which was 188-fold higher compared to that of plasma ( Table 3 ). The observation that lung had the highest concentration of CVL218 was in line with the fact that the SARS-CoV-2 virus has the most pathological impact in lung with high viral loads, which suggested that CVL218 has the potential to be used for the indications of the lung lesions caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection, if its antiviral profile can be established in animal models and clinical trials. 8 author/funder.

We next conducted a toxicokinetic analysis of CVL218 in rats (Methods). In particular, rats were given CVL218 20/60/160 mg/kg by oral gavage once a day for consecutive 28 days, followed by 28 days without CVL218 administration, to investigate the reversibility of the toxic effects of the compound and examine whether there is any potential delayed-onset toxicity of this drug in rats. The results showed that, the maximum tolerable dose (MTD) and the no-observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) were 160 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg, respectively. The exposure of female rats to CVL218 (AUC 0\u221224 ) was 7605 h\u00b7ng/mL in day 1 and 6657 h\u00b7ng/mL in day 28, while that of male rats (AUC 0\u221224 ) was 9102 h\u00b7ng/mL in day 1 and 10253 h\u00b7ng/mL in day 28 (Table S4) .",

First, during the life cycle of the coronavirus, PARP1 inhibitors may inhibit the viral growth through suppressing viral replication and impeding the binding of the nucleocapsid protein to viral RNAs [31, 34, 35, 36] , which can also be supported by our molecular docking results (see Section 2.6). Second, PARP1 inhibitors have been previously reported to play a critical role in regulating inflammatory response by modulating the expression of pro-inflammatory factors such as NF-\u03baB, AP-1, IL-6 and downstream cytokines and chemokines [37, 38, 39, 40] . Also, it has been shown that the overactivation of PARP1 promotes energy (NAD + /ATP) consumption and drives cell death, exacerbating the inflammation response [37, 38, 39, 41] . PARP1 inhibitors thus may repress the NF-\u03baB-mediated pro-inflammatory signals, and reduce energy failure and subsequent cell death induced by necrosis, thus providing a clinical potential for attenuating the cytokine storm and inflammatory response caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

Several previous studies have demonstrated that PARP1 is critical for viral replication [35, 42, 43] . For example, PARP1 has been reported to interact with hemagglutinin (HA) of influenza A virus (IAV) and promote its replication by triggering the degradation of host type I IFN receptor [44] . In addition, the ADP-ribosylation of adenoviral core proteins displays an antiviral defense mechanism [34] . Therefore, intervening the ADP-ribosylation mediated interplay between PARP1 and viral proteins may be another important pathway for PARP1 inhibitors to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection. Of course, to throughly understand the anti-SARS-CoV-2 roles of PARP1 inhibitors, more experimental studies and direct (clinical) evidences will be needed in the future.",

Thus, it would generally need more safety data to justify any repurposing of PARP1 inhibitors for non-oncology indications. Fortunately, there are numerous existing pre-clinical and clinical studies on repurposing PARP1 inhibitors into non-oncological diseases, including the aforementioned acute diseases (e.g., acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), stroke) [52] and chronic diseases (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis and vascular diseases) [52, 53] . All these evidences indicate the possibility of repurposing PARP1 inhibitors as a safe therapeutic agent to treat the current acute lung disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. In addition, our pharmacokinetic and toxicokinetic data in rats and monkeys shown in our study indicate that CVL218 may have a relatively acceptable safety profile to be repositioned for the antiviral purpose. Moreover, CVL218 has been approved to enter Phase I clinical trial in 2017 by National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) in China for cancer treatment. The preliminary data from the Phase I clinical trial have shown that CVL218 is well tolerated in ascending dose studies at doses as high as 1000 mg QD and 500 mg BID, and no Grade II and above adverse events have been observed, which indicates that CVL218 is also quite safe and well tolerated in human.",

The drug molecular similarity network was obtained by calculating the Tanimoto similarities from Morgan fingerprints with a radius of 2 computed using the rdkit tool [65] . The protein sequence similarity networks of both human and virus were obtained by calculating the Smith-Waterman similarities of the amino acid sequences derived from UniProt [66] using a sequence alignment software provided in [67] . Noted that we collected additional protein sequences of SARS-CoV-2 from UniProt [66] and added them into the corresponding networks for the final prediction. Those drugs without drug-target interactions or outside the Drug-Bank database were removed from the corresponding networks.

The up-and down-regulated genes were then identified using a cut-off threshold of p-value < 10 \u221210 . We used the connectivity map (CMap) [5] , which contains the cellular gene expression profiles under the perturbation of 2428 well annotated reference compounds, to measure the associations of gene expression patterns between SARS-CoV infected patients and the reference compound-perturbed cells. The connectivity map scores were computed based on the up-and down-regulated gene sets of SARS-CoV infected patients using the web tool (https://clue.io/query).

Meanwhile, the key residues (i.e., S51, Y109 and Y111) participating in the binding with the drugs on SARS-CoV-2-N-NTD are also highly conserved among other viruses including SARS-CoV, HCoV-OC43, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) (Figure 5C), suggesting that the N-NTDs of different viruses most likely display similar binding behaviors for PJ-34, CVL218 or other PARP1 inhibitors.
