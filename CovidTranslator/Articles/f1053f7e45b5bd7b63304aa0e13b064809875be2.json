In addition, computational combinatorial methods for epitope mapping are also useful. These methods rely on the ability of the antibody of interest to affinity isolate specific short peptides from combinatorial phage display peptide libraries. The peptides are then regarded as leads for the definition of the epitope corresponding to the antibody used to screen the peptide library. For epitope mapping, computational algorithms have been developed, such as Mapitope, which has recently been found to be effective in mapping conformational discontinuous epitopes. The pros and cons of various approaches towards epitope mapping are also discussed.",

Thus, epitope mapping stems from the identification of a cluster of systematically construct mutations to specifically test the effect of mutations that strongly affect mAb binding. Once again, the alteration of selected residues. For example, in order to localize the problem is that mutations in contact residues do not always result X5 Fab epitope on HIV-1 gp120, [57] 55 residues of gp120 were in loss of mAb binding. Moreover, loss of binding is often the selected for 'alanine exchange'.

Of the mutants constructed, eight resulted in significant means to predict epitopes was determined in the study of the reduction of antibody binding. Subsequently, when the crystal crystal structure of histidine phospho-carrier protein (HPr)-Jel42 structure of gp120-X5 Fab-CD4 was solved, [58] it became apparent mAb complex. [73, 74] Among the 34 random mutations made to the that of the 55 substitutions made, only 6 residues fell within the surface of HPr, 12 were contact residues as defined by the cogenuine binding epitope.

Of these, nine residues lay within the genuine part of the epitope, whereas two mutations did impair binding binding epitope. However, the remaining four inhibitory mutations significantly. Moreover, six mutations outside of the epitope did were of residues totally removed from the binding interface. have a significant effect on antibody binding.
