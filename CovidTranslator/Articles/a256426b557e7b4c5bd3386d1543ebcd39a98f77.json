In such cases, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) may be considered as a rescue therapy. In a study of ECMO for ARDS in patients with Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), a similar coronavirus disease emerged in 2012, a significant decrease of inhospital mortality rate and length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay was found in patients treated with ECMO compared to those managed with conventional therapy [1] . However, with COVID-19, concerns have been raised about high mortality rate observed in an early report which included data on ECMO in infected patients [2] . It has been suggested that the compounded immunologic insult by both infection and extracorporeal circuit may counterbalance or even offset survival benefits [2] . In this article, we aimed to evaluate ECMO mortality as reported in early COVID-19 epidemiological studies.",
