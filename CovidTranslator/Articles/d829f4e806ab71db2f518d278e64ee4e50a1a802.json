These inhibitors may serve as valuable pharmacological probes to facilitate our efforts in elucidating the biological functions of EPAC and developing potential novel therapeutics against human diseases. Our SAR results have also revealed that further modification at the 3-, 4-, and 5-positions of the phenyl ring as well as the 5-position of the isoxazole moiety may allow for the development of more potent EPAC antagonists.",

            "text": "The pivotal second messenger cAMP can regulate a wide range of physiological and pathological processes via signaling pathways that are involved in many disease states including cancer, diabetes, inflammation, heart failure, and neurological disorders. 1 The physiological effects of cAMP are mainly transduced by three different downstream effectors, including protein kinase A (PKA), 2 cyclic nucleotide-activated ion channels, 3, 4 and the most recently discovered exchange proteins directly activated by cAMP (EPAC). [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] After being activated by the elevation in the intracellular concentration of cAMP, EPAC proteins act as guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) to catalyze the exchange of GDP for GTP on the Raslike small GTPases, Rap1 and Rap2, 5,6,11 thereby controlling Rap-mediated biological processes. Two isoforms of EPAC proteins have been identified, EPAC1 and EPAC2, 5, 6, 11 which are coded by two independent genes in both mature and developing tissues of mammals and have distinct expression patterns. EPAC1, also known as cAMP-GEF-I (RAPGEF3 in humans), is nearly ubiquitously expressed, whereas the expression of EPAC2, also known as cAMP-GEF-II (RAPGEF4 in humans), is relatively restricted. At least three splice variants of human EPAC2 have been found to exhibit a confined expression pattern. 12 Epac2A is the most broadly expressed and is largely found in brain, pituitary, and pancreatic islets. 6, 13, 14 By contrast, Epac2B has so far been detected only in the adrenal and testis, 13, 15 whereas Epac2C expression is restricted to the liver. 16 Since their discovery in 1998, EPAC proteins have evoked significant interest toward elucidating their roles in physiological processes and pathogenesis as well as the molecular mechanisms of EPAC activation. Accumulating evidence has demonstrated that EPAC proteins play a critical role in insulin secretion, cardiac contraction, osteoclast differentiation, vascular permeability, neurotransmitter release, Treg-mediated immune suppression, integrin-mediated cell adhesion, cell migration and proliferation, cell exocytosis, and apoptosis as well as gene transcription and chromosomal integrity. [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] Meanwhile, a substantial number of small-molecule EPAC modulators including various cAMP analogues and newly discovered EPAC-specific antagonists has been discovered and exploited for uncovering the biological functions of EPAC. 10 Various cAMP derivatives have been reported, 24, 25 such as 8-pCPT-2\u2032-O-Me-cAMP (007), [26] [27] [28] 8-pCPT-2\u2032-O-Me-cAMP-AM (007-AM), 29 and Sp-8-pCPT-2\u2032-O-Me-cAMPS, [29] [30] [31] which have been used as powerful pharmacological tools in EPAC-related research. However, these cAMP analogues as EPAC ligands are limited in their use due to a lack of selectivity among the isoforms of EPAC and potential off-target effects. Recently, substantial effort has been made to focus on nonnucleotide small molecules as EPAC-selective or isoform-specific antagonists, such as 4-cyclopentyl-2-((2,5-dimethylbenzyl)thio)-6-oxo-1,6-dihydropyrimidine-5-carbonitrile (HJC0197) and 4-cyclopropyl-2-((2,5-dimethylbenzyl)-thio)-6-oxo-1,6dihydropyrimidine-5-carbonitrile (HJC0198) as EPAC antagonists, 32 5 ,7-dibromo-6fluoro-3,4-dihydro-2-meth-yl-1(2H)-quinolinecarboxaldehyde (CE3F4) as an EPAC1selective inhibitor, 33, 34 and 1,3,5-trimethyl-2-tosylbenzene (ESI-05) and 1-(mesitylsulfonyl)-2,4-dimethyl-1H-pyrrole (HJC0350) as specific EPAC2 antagonists. 35 To identify new pharmacological probes with a high capability of specifically inhibiting EPAC activity, our team developed an automated, robust, and sensitive fluorescence-based high-throughput screening (HTS) assay, which is based on detecting the dose-dependent change in fluorescence intensity of a fluorescent cyclic nucleotide analogue, 8-NBD-cAMP, with purified full-length EPAC2 protein. 36, 37 After analyzing the EPAC2 8-NBD-cAMP competition activity, selected compounds were evaluated for their ability to inhibit cAMPmediated EPAC1 and EPAC2 GEF activity using purified recombinant full-length EPAC1 and EPAC2 proteins. A Maybridge Hitfinder compound library of 14 400 structurally diverse small molecules has been screened. 32, 35, 38 Among these, 2-(5-tert-butylisoxazol-3yl)-N\u2032-(3-chlorophenyl)-2-oxoacetohy-drazonoyl cyanide (ESI-09, 1) has been identified and characterized as a novel noncyclic nucleotide EPAC-specific antagonist with no effect toward PKA (Figure 1 ). 38 NMR spectroscopy experiments 39 have also verified that 1 specifically interacts with the cAMP binding domain (CBD) of human EPAC1 (aa. 148-318). 40-49 1 dose-dependently competes with 8-NBD-cAMP in binding to EPAC2, with an IC 50 value of 9.0 \u03bcM. In the presence of 20 \u03bcM cAMP, 1 also dose-dependently displays cAMP-mediated GEF inhibitory activity of full-length EPAC2 and EPAC1, with apparent IC 50 values of 4.4 and 10.8 \u03bcM, respectively. 39 1, as a specific EPAC inhibitor, has been a useful tool compound in revealing the roles of cAMP in regulating Plasmodium falciparum merozoite invasion of human erythrocytes, 50 restoring the endothelial barrier after thrombin-induced hyperpermeability, 51 and uncovering the functions of EPAC in osteoclast formation 23 and cAMP-dependent regulation of Schwann cell proliferation and differentiation, 52 in addition to other fields. [53] [54] [55] Further biological functional investigations have also demonstrated that 1 can specifically block intracellular Akt phosphorylation, EPAC-mediated Rap1 activation, and insulin secretion in pancreatic \u03b2 cells. Treatment of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) cells with 1 has no obvious effect on cell proliferation and viability, but it can give rise to a significant decrease in cell migration and invasion. 38 Furthermore, by employing an orthotopic metastatic PDA mouse model, 1 was found to reduce local and distant spread of MIA PaCa-2 cells and significantly decrease metastasis to the liver at a dose of 10 mg/kg via i.p. injection for 3 weeks. 20 Compound 1 also enhances leptin signaling in an organotypic hypothalamic slice culture system. Administration of 1 in wildtype mice at a dose of 50 mg/kg by oral gavage for 3 weeks significantly reduces plasma leptin. 56 Moreover, treatment with 1 at a nontoxic concentration can attenuate the formation of cytopathic effects, significantly reduce viral yields, and effectively protect permissive cells against Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-Cov) infection by inhibiting viral RNA replication and protein expression of MERS-CoV without affecting the expression and localization of EPAC protein. 57 It was also shown that hit 1 can completely recapitulate the EPAC1 knockout phenotype in vivo via pharmacological inhibition of EPAC1 and can significantly block the early stage of rickettsial attachment and invasion into nonphagocytic host cells. 58 Treatment with 1 at a dose of 10 mg/kg via i.p. injection for 12 days significantly protects wild-type mice against rickettsial infection, resulting in much milder disease manifestations and dramatically improved survival. 58 Taken together, these findings support compound 1 as being a selective pharmacological probe in unraveling the in vivo functions of EPAC and may provide potential novel therapeutics for the prevention and treatment of various human diseases including pancreatic cancer, diabetes, obesity, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus infections, and fatal rickettsioses.",

            "text": "As shown in Table 1 , we initially focused on investigating the effect of various substitutions on the phenyl ring of our previous hit 1. To evaluate the importance of substitutions, we removed 3-chloro on the phenyl ring of 1, leading to compound 8, which has about a 7-fold loss of binding affinity with an IC 50 of 59.8 \u03bcM. Adjustment of 3-chloro to either the 2-or 4-position (as in compound 9 or 10) resulted in a 3-fold decreased inhibitory activity in comparison with that of 1, suggesting that a proper substitution at the 3-position is beneficial to its activity. We next explored the electronic effect of substitutions at the 3-position of the phenyl ring in detail. Replacement of 3-chloro with its congeners bromo and fluoro (as in compounds 11 and 12) led to a slight loss of activity compared to that of 1, whereas it increased activity by about 3-4-fold compared to that of nonsubstituted analogue 8, with IC 50 values of 14.0 and 22.4 \u03bcM, respectively. Compounds 13 and 14, with other electronwithdrawing groups such as trifluoromethyl and nitro, led to approximately 5-and 2-fold increases in potency when compared to that of 8, with IC 50 values of 11.9 and 31.3 \u03bcM, respectively. Compounds 15, with ethyl carboxyl, and 16, with a cyano group, both retained a similar inhibitory activity to that of 8. However, compound 17, with an acetyl group, displayed a dramatic loss of activity. Introduction of electron-donating groups, such as methoxy and its isomer, hydroxymethyl, afforded compounds 18 and 19, which also resulted in a significant loss of activity. Interestingly, compound 20 with a methyl group was about 2-fold more potent than that of nonsubstituted analogue 8, with an IC 50 of 25.1 \u03bcM. These results suggest that the 3-position of the phenyl ring of 1 can tolerate chemical modifications with either electron-withdrawing or -donating groups.",

By keeping 3-chloro and introducing another chloro group on the 2-, 4-, 5-, or 6-position (as in compounds 21-24), 3,4-and 3,5-dichloro analogues 22 and 23 bearing the best binding affinity were obtained and were about 5-and 3-fold more potent than that of parent compound 1, with IC 50 values of 1.9 and 3.0 \u03bcM, respectively. We then explored fluorinated compounds given their notable successes in drug discovery, with an increasing number of fluorine-containing drugs on the market. Due to the unique nature of fluorine, fluorine substitution is commonly used in contemporary medicinal chemistry and drug design to alter physicochemical and conformational properties as well as to generate selective reactivity of developing candidates, thereby improving metabolic stability, solubility, bioavailability, and proteinligand interactions. 66, 67 Moreover, 3-fluoro and 3-trifluoromethyl analogues 12 and 13 from the above monosubstituted SAR studies also exhibited comparable potency to that of 3chloro (as in compound 1). Therefore, a series of compounds with fluoro, trifluoromethyl, and chloro groups in 3,4-or 3,5-disubstituted style was designed and synthesized (as in compounds 25-34). All of these compounds were approximately 2-6-fold more potent than hit 1. Having identified an optimal substitution for the phenyl ring that maintains good potency, we then directed our effort on tuning the isoxazole scaffold. Compounds 1, 22, and 35 were chosen as reference compounds. By keeping 3-Cl, 3,5-di-Cl, and 3,4,5-tri-Cl as constant substitutions on the phenyl ring, we embarked on exploring the steric hindrance effects of substitutions on the 5-position of the isoxazole ring via replacing t-butyl group of the reference compound with a methyl, c-propyl, c-hexyl, or phenyl group. As shown in Table  2 , compounds 38-41, 42-45, and 46-48 were three small parallel series, which mainly displayed good EPAC2 inhibitory effects in the order t-Bu > c-Hex \u2265 c-Pr > Me > Ph. Among these, compounds 43, 44, 46, and 47 were more potent than hit 1, with IC 50 values of 3.45-8.8 \u03bcM (Figure 3) . Notably, compounds 41 and 48 with phenyl substitutions were totally inactive, indicating that more conformationally constricted biaryl moieties may be unsuitable for fitting into the shallow hydrophobic pockets of EPAC proteins. These results suggest that appropriate bulky alkyl substitutions offering sufficient lipophilicity are more favorable for the ligand to interact with EPAC2 proteins.",

One-point calibration was performed against standards with known concentrations of the sample compounds to determine concentrations of the indicated compounds in samples. 1 itself has limited aqueous solubility, with a maximum concentration around 5.95 \u03bcg/mL, whereas it possesses excellent solubility in ethanol (14.98 mg/mL). The addition of another or two chloro atoms onto the phenyl ring of 1 not only enhanced their binding affinity on EPAC1 and EPAC2 but also improved their aqueous solubility. For instance, aqueous solubility of analogue 22, with 3,5-di-Cl on the phenyl ring, is enhanced with a saturated concentration of 45.4 \u03bcg/mL, and those of 3,4,5-tri-Cl derivatives 35 and 47 are 12.7 and 10.1 \u03bcg/mL, respectively.

            "text": "Since our robust HTS assay is particularly sensitive for identifying compounds that directly compete with 8-NBD-cAMP in binding to EPAC2, we predicted that our compounds may bind to the cAMP binding domain (CBD) of EPAC2. Molecular docking studies were performed to help us better understand the structure-activity relationships of these new compounds toward EPAC2. Using the AutoDock 4.0 method, the docking results revealed that our new compounds fit nicely into the functional cAMP binding pocket of active EPAC2 (PDB code: 3CF6). 32, 62 To further characterize the binding pose, we selected analogue 47 as a case study for our theoretical investigation. As shown in Figure 5A , the hydrophobic cyclohexylisoxazolyl moiety interacts with the hydrophobic residues of Phe 367, Leu406, Ala407, and Ala415, whereas the 3,4,5-trichlorophenyl fragment forms hydrophobic interactions with residues Val386 and Leu397. Moreover, this binding mode is further stabilized by the occurrence of hydrogen bonds between the NH hydrogen atom of the linker and the oxygen atom of residue Asp402. These results are in full agreement with our established SAR data that hydrophobic groups at the isoxazolyl moiety and phenyl scaffold as well as the types of the linkers are crucial to target EPAC2. The molecular docking studies of 47 also comply with our previous results with hit 1 10 through the overlay analysis of the two ligands, as depicted in Figure 5B . Given the critical role of the linker, these docking findings may also help us to understand why amides 53 and 55, urea 54, carbohydrazide 56, and pyrazole 57 display no significant activity. Taken together, these studies suggest that optimization of the substitutions at the isoxazolyl moiety and phenyl scaffold while keeping the NH groups on the linker may provide further opportunities to improve the binding affinity and specificity of the substituted 2-(isoxazol-3-yl)-2-oxo-N\u2032phenyl-acetohydrazonoyl cyanide analogues toward EPAC proteins.",

The SAR results based on EPAC2 activity were consistent with our docking studies, indicating that further modifications at the 3-, 4-, and 5-positions of the phenyl scaffold and the 5-position of the isoxazole moiety may allow us to tune the original hit 1 to achieve more potent EPAC antagonists. Interestingly, various linkers explored led to a significant loss in activity, indicating that the linker in the parent compound plays a critical role in the binding activity toward EPAC. Furthermore, several new molecules, such as compounds 22, 35, and 47, have been identified as potent EPAC1 and EPAC2 inhibitors with IC 50 values in the low micromolar to submicromolar range. These compounds may hold promise as potential drug candidates for the preclinical development to IND-enabling studies toward novel therapeutics against human diseases. Additionally, these small-molecule inhibitors may serve as valuable pharmacological probes to facilitate our efforts in elucidating the physiological functions of EPAC in disease and associated signaling pathways. Further studies of selected compounds in various human disease models and a systematic optimization based upon identified advanced chemical leads toward EPAC subtype selectivity are under way and will be reported in due course.",

Reactions were performed under a nitrogen atmosphere in dry glassware with magnetic stirring. Preparative column chromatography was performed using silica gel 60, particle size 0.063-0.200 mm (70-230 mesh, flash). Analytical TLC was carried out employing silica gel 60 F 254 plates (Merck, Darmstadt). Visualization of the developed chromatograms was performed with UV detection (254 nm). NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker-600 or Bruker-300 ( 1 H, 600 and 300 MHz; 13 C, 150 and 75 MHz) spectrometer. 1 H and 13 C NMR spectra were recorded with TMS as an internal reference. Chemical shifts are expressed in ppm, and J values are given in Hz. High-resolution mass spectra (HRMS) were obtained from Thermo Fisher LTQ Orbitrap Elite mass spectrometer. Parameters include the following: nano ESI spray voltage was 1.8 kV, capillary temperature was 275 \u00b0C, resolution was 60 000, and ionization was achieved in positive mode. Melting points were measured on a Thermo Scientific electrothermal digital melting point apparatus and are uncorrected. Purities of final compounds were established by analytical HPLC, which was carried out on a Shimadzu HPLC system (model no. CBM-20A LC-20AD SPD-20A UV/vis). HPLC analysis conditions were as follows: Waters \u03bcBondapak C18 (300 \u00d7 3.9 mm), flow rate of 0.5 mL/min, UV detection at 270 and 254 nm, and linear gradient from 10% acetonitrile in water to 100% acetonitrile in water in 20 min followed by 30 min of the last-named solvent (0.1% TFA was added into both acetonitrile and water).

Inspired by the results from the 3,4-and 3,5-disubstituted designs, we attempted to combine their substituted effects and study 3,4,5trisubstituted analogues. Intriguingly, 3,4,5-trichloro-substituted analogue 35 and 3,4,5trifluoro-substituted analogue 36 demonstrated enhanced potency, with IC 50 values of 0.9 and 1.1 \u03bcM, respectively (Figure 3), whereas 2,4,6-trichloro-substituted analogue 37 resulted in a dramatic loss of activity, with an IC 50 of 19.0 \u03bcM. These findings suggest that further optimization on the substitutions at the 3-, 4-, and/or 5-positions of the phenyl ring may offer the potential to develop new and more potent EPAC2 inhibitors.",
