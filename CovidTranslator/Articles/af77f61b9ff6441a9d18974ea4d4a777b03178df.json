Hong Kong was run as a laissez-faire economy under British colonial rule, and the Hong Kong government continued using this system after the territory reverted to Chinese rule in 1997. But the government took a more active role when market forces alone appeared to be insufficient to drive the territory's structural transformation. 7 Ocean Park 209 Hong Kong was frequently seen as a business city and associated with deal-making, dining, and shopping. 8 Tourist activities in Hong Kong were biased strongly toward shopping, with tourists spending half of their expenses on shopping as compared with only 3% on sightseeing. Unlike some countries such as China, Hong Kong had few natural scenic endow ments and therefore had to develop its own attractions. In 2001, the govern ment announced the development of five tourism clusters to increase the attractiveness of Hong Kong to tourists, the redevelopment of Ocean Park being one of them [see Exhibit 2]. 9 These projects, together with the con struction of a Disney theme park, formed part of the government's plan to turn Hong Kong from a mere business destination into a family destination.",

The park, located at Penny's Bay on Lantau Island, was 126 hectares in size, with another 54 hectares reserved for further expan sion. The total project development cost was HK$27.67 billion, of which HK$2.3 billion was covered by a commercial loan. The government contrib uted HK$3.25 billion in return for a 57% equity interest in HKITP, and another HK$6.1 billion in loans for the project. In addition, it also invested HK$13.57 billion on site formation and infrastructure building to prepare Penny's Bay for the park's construction. By comparison, Disney invested HK$2.45 billion in return for a 43% equity interest in HKITP. 25 It earned royalty payments between 5 and 10% on revenues generated from admis sions and money spent in the park, and received a 2% base fee plus a variable fee based on the theme park's performance for managing the park. 26 Since the theme park was a commercial project, negotiations between Disney and the government were kept under cover, and the deal was announced only after it was finalised. The government's disproportionate share of investment in the project gave rise to strong responses from the local community. The government defended itself on the grounds that in contrast to Disney, which assessed the project on its commercial rate of return, it assessed the project on the basis of its economic benefits to Hong Kong. 27 The government projected that the Disney theme park would bring net economic benefits of HK$148 billion to the territory over 40 years and would create 54,200 jobs by 2020. 28 The government also saw the Disney theme park as a strategic infrastructural project that would help turn Hong Kong into a \"world city\" 29 and a family destination for tourism. 30 While Hong Kongers generally welcomed the benefits of the park, the controversial co-operation between the government and Disney generated much debate within the community. 31",

Rides were named in English, and its working conditions led workers to walk off in protest days after it opened. Disney's cultural insensitivity caused uproar among the French public, driving one critic to call the park a \"cultural Chernobyl.\" 32 Having learnt its lessons, Disney worked hard to be culturally sensitive in planning Hong Kong Disneyland. The layout of the park was rotated several degrees at the early design stage at the recommendation of a feng shui master. In line with Chinese tradition, auspicious dates were picked for the commencement and completion of all the park's buildings. The number eight, which signified prosperity in Chinese culture, abounded in the park, while the number four, which was associated with death, did not appear even on lift buttons. Park signs and explanation for rides were written in both Chinese and English for the convenience of the Chinese tourists. 33 The park also offered both local music and food, including the first Chinese eatery on Main Street. Taking One such example was when Disney launched a discounted one-day ticket in early 2006 that allowed ticket holders to visit the park anytime within six months aside from special days designated by the park. Disney designated the four days that Hong Kongers enjoyed as public holidays during Chinese New Year as special days. It was unaware that mainland China enjoyed seven days instead. 40 So it was totally unprepared when crowds of mainland tourists swamped its gates, demanding access to the park. In order to control the crowds, park staff shut the gates repeatedly despite the fact that visitors held valid tickets. 41 The commotion that arose was captured by local TV stations, leading to strong criticisms from the local press [see Exhibit 6]. The embarrassing blunder led to an emotional public apology from Bill Ernest, the park's executive vice-president and managing director. \"We regret that anyone may have been disappointed.

Hong Kong Disneyland Hotel and Disney's Hollywood Hotel required Chinese travel agencies to reserve a guaranteed number of rooms weeks in advance when in fact most mainland tourists finalise their plans only a few days before they take off. 43 In addition, Disney was unaware that the places which package-tour guides took their clients to depended on the commission they got from each venue. Hence it failed to give adequate commission to entice mainland travel agencies to market the theme park. 44 \"They started off doing business the American way, so they have encountered problems,\" said Victor Yu, general manager of Beijing's China CYTS Outbound Travel Service. 45 Though Disney had purposely kept down the size of the park during the initial phase, local visitors expressed disappointment at the size of the theme park and its failure to measure up to its counterparts in the United States, while some mainland visitors opted for Ocean Park because the admission price for Disney was too high. Visitors also complained about long queues for rides and at restaurants.",

Sai Kung in eastern New Territories Sai Kung, with its countryside and beaches, was to be developed into an area with facilities for outdoor activities, such as hiking and water sports. The development of the Sai Kung cluster also would include world class resorts.A cultural belt stretching along the West Kowloon reclamation area This belt would include existing museums and performing arts centres, the former Marine Police Headquarters, and the Tsim Sha Tsui Promenade. It would include a new tourism area with a large-scale, multipurpose stadium and a new cruise terminal in southeast Kowloon. A heritage, entertainment, and dining area in the heart of Central This area will cover a number of existing landmarks, such as the Government House, St. Johns' Cathedral, and the city's prime nightlife district, Lan Kwai Fong. The redevelopment of Ocean Park and the new Aberdeen Harbour tourism node Ocean Park aside, the Aberdeen Harbour tourism node would include a Fisherman's Wharf, a traditional fishing village, and a leisure and dining node. In addition to the five above-mentioned tourism clusters, the government also had other tourism projects in the pipeline, including the Hong Kong Westland Park near Mai Po in the northwestern part of Hong Kong. : Hong Kong Government.

Profit and Loss of Ocean Park Source: Ocean Park Corporation. \"Annual Reports\" from 1996 to 2004. But in 2003, the Park was dealt another blow with the outbreak of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). As tourists shunned Hong Kong and Hong Kongers stayed home as much as they could, attendance at the Park fell by about 70%, with only a few hundred visitors each day instead of the usual thousands. 12 Consecutive years of loss, coupled with the heavy blow of SARS, threatened Hong Kong's only home-grown theme park with the possibility of closure. In response to the economy spiralling downward from the impact of SARS, the Chinese government launched the Individual Visit Scheme (IVS), lifting restrictions on the travel of mainlanders to Hong Kong. The scheme allowed mainlanders from designated cities to travel to Hong Kong in an individual capacity rather than only on a business visa or in a group tour as before. The scheme brought a flux of mainlanders to Hong Kong, and Ocean Park, long a Hong Kong icon in China, rebounded quickly, returning to profitability in 2003-2004 [see Exhibit 4].",

The financial package also stipulated that Ocean Park should always \"prepay\" the commercial loans as far as possible. The tenure of the commercial loans was 15 years. The fact that Ocean Park was designated a public sector entity by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority favoured the Park when lenders assessed the risk in participating in the syndicated loan. 73 The government's guarantee also served as a strong token of confidence for the project. Nonetheless, its non recourse nature meant that repayment would begin only when the redevelop ment project was completed and the project began generating revenues, giving rise to the long tenure of the commercial loans.
