However, host shutoff is not indiscriminate, since viral proteins and host proteins 28 required for viral replication are still synthesized during shutoff. The molecular determinants of 29 target selectivity in host shutoff remain incompletely understood. Here, we report that the 30 influenza A virus shutoff factor PA-X usurps RNA splicing to selectively target host RNAs for 31 destruction. PA-X preferentially degrades spliced mRNAs, both transcriptome-wide and in 32 reporter assays. Moreover, proximity-labeling proteomics revealed that PA-X interacts with 33 cellular proteins involved in RNA splicing. The interaction with splicing contributes to target 34 discrimination and is unique among viral host shutoff nucleases. This novel mechanism sheds 35 light on the specificity of viral control of host gene expression and may provide opportunities for 36 development of new host-targeted antivirals. 37 38 39 All rights reserved.

Moreover, the mRNA levels were similarly affected by overexpression of PA-X from the 156 A/Udorn/72 H3N2 (Udorn) strain, suggesting that target selection by PA-X is conserved between 157 different virus strains ( Figure 2D ). Collectively, these data demonstrate that PA-X broadly 158 targets RNA for degradation, while a subset of RNAs remains unaffected. 159 160 Specific functional classes of host RNAs are differentially sensitive to PA-X 161",

They were down-regulated in a PA-X-dependent 168 manner both during infection and by PA-X ectopic expression. The first group was completely 169 PA-X-specific, because their levels were largely unchanged in IAV PA(\u0394X) infected cells 170 ( Figure 3A , left panel). The RNAs in the second group were PA-X-sensitive, but were partially 171 down-regulated by other mechanisms during IAV PA(\u0394X) infection ( Figure 3A , right panel). By 172 contrast, 28% of the RNAs were host shutoff resistant and were not down-regulated by infection 173 or PA-X expression ( Figure 3B ). In addition, the k-means algorithm identified a group of RNAs 174 that were down-regulated during infection by a PA-X-independent mechanism, and yet were PA-175 X-sensitive in PA-X-expressing cells ( Figure 3C ).

Interestingly, based on gene ontology (GO) term analysis, the host shutoff-178 resistant RNAs were significantly enriched for genes involved in transcription and translation, 179 including ribosomal RNA processing, ribosomal proteins, and membrane protein synthesis 180 ( Figure 3D ). This result is consistent with the IAV requirement for host biosynthetic machinery IAV infection, as demonstrated by their higher expression compared to all detected RNAs, their 189 levels were even higher in the absence of PA-X ( Figure 3E ). While only 12% of ISGs were up-190 regulated during wt IAV infection, and only 4% were induced more than two-fold, 35% of the 191 ISGs were up-regulated in IAV PA(\u0394X)-infected cells, with 15% above two-fold.

The PR8 NS1 protein 348 does not block 3'-end RNA processing (Das et al., 2008), and its RdRp does not trigger 349 degradation of Pol II (Rodriguez et al., 2009). The mechanism of reduced host transcription in 350 IAV infected cells is not yet known, but it is not dependent on PA-X, because it also occurs 351 during infection with influenza B viruses (Bauer et al., 2018), which do not encode PA-X (Shi et 352 al., 2012). Lastly, clustering analysis revealed that some functional classes of RNAs are spared 353 from PA-X degradation, which agrees with previous results from Bercovich-Kinori et al. 354 (Bercovich-Kinori et al., 2016). In particular, mRNAs for proteins involved in translation appear 355 to be spared (Figure 3D, (Bercovich-Kinori et al., 2016)). Our new results suggest a potential 356 explanation for this phenomenon, which is linked to the small number of exons of these mRNAs",

Also, SARS CoV nsp1 only degrades RNAs that are actively translated (Gaglia 365 et al., 2012; Kamitani et al., 2009). Thus, to our knowledge, this is the first described instance of 366 a host shutoff RNase using splicing as a targeting mechanism. The connection between splicing 367 and PA-X degradation is evident from the reduced effect of PA-X on intronless mRNAs (Figures 368 4, 5) and the negative correlation between exon number and degree of degradation by PA-X 369 (Figures 4, S3). These findings begin to shed light on the specificity of PA-X for Pol II 370 transcripts (Khaperskyy et al., 2016). In cellular transcription, the splicing machinery associates 371",

            "text": "said, our published results suggest that even the two viral mRNAs that are spliced 383 (NEP and M2) are PA-X resistant (Khaperskyy et al., 2016). However, splicing of viral mRNAs 384 is a fundamentally different process, since the splicing machinery needs to be recruited to the 385 RNAs separately from Pol II (Dubois et al., 2014). It is likely that viral mRNA splicing does not 386 requires the factors that PA-X couples to, particularly since none of the potential PA-X-387 interacting proteins are core components of the spliceosome. The ability to easily discriminate 388 between host and viral mRNAs may be one of the reasons IAV has evolved a targeting strategy 389 based on splicing and not translation. For example, herpesviral mRNAs are not protected from 390 degradation by herpesviral host shutoff RNases, presumably because there is no clear difference 391 in their translation strategy (Abernathy et al., 2014). While herpesviruses can compensate for the 392 degradation of their own RNAs, this self-sacrifice may not work for a virus like IAV, which has 393 a shorter replication cycle and a simpler gene expression program. 394 395 Another conclusion of our RNAseq analysis is that PA-X with a 9-aa truncated X-ORF is 396 essentially non-functional in the context of infection. The shutoff impairment of IAV PA(X9) is 397 very similar to that of the PA(fs) and PA(\u0394X) viruses (Fig. S1B), even though the frameshifting 398 sequence (and thus presumably PA-X production) is not altered in the X9 virus. This finding 399 validates the results of multiple studies using ectopic PA-X expression models (Hayashi et al., 400 2016; Khaperskyy et al., 2016; Oishi et al., 2015), and our PR8 results shown in Figure 1B. 401 Previous studies indicated that at least 15 aa of the X-ORF are required for full RNA degrading 402 activity in cells (Hayashi et al., 2016; Khaperskyy et al., 2016; Oishi et al., 2015), despite in vitro 403 activity of the RNase domain alone (Bavagnoli et al., 2015; Dias et al., 2009; Yuan et al., 2009). 404 Jagger et al. previously tested a premature stop mutant, and obtained a virus with an intermediate 405 All rights reserved.
