Currently, most ventilation studies revolve around specialised areas such as operating rooms and isolation rooms. This paper focuses on the ventilation of multiple-bed hospital wards in the tropical climate, taking into account the design, indoor conditions and engineering controls. General ward layouts are described briefly. The required indoor conditions such as temperature, humidity, air movements and indoor air quality in the ward spaces are summarized based on the current guidelines and practices. Also, recent studies and engineering practices in the hospital indoor environment are elaborated. Usage of computational fluid dynamics tools for the ventilation studies is discussed as well. As identified during the review, there is an apparent knowledge gap for ventilation studies in the tropics compared with temperate climates, as fact studies have only been published for hospital wards in countries with a temperate climate. Therefore, it is highlighted that specific tropical studies along with novel engineering controls are required in addressing the ventilation requirements for the tropics.",

In 2006, an interdisciplinary panel consisting of experts in medicine, epidemiology, toxicology, environmental chemistry, aerosol sciences, psychology, engineering and architecture reviewed the effects of ventilation on health in nonindustrial indoor environments [13] . The group judged that 27 of the total 365 papers studied concurred that ventilation rates are associated with sick building syndrome (SBS), especially in offices. Furthermore, the group also highlighted the need for ventilation and health studies in warm and humid climates and polluted and public localities. Moreover, a list of 40 studies between 1960 and 2005 were appraised by another multidisciplinary panel. Subsequently, they also recognised that 10 studies have put forward substantial facts that show the relationship between ventilation and proliferation of infectious diseases, such as influenza and TB [14] .",

The number of beds in a ward differs from one facility to another. Therefore, the configuration of a multiple-bed hospital ward can range from 2 people per ward up to 30 people per ward in many localities, including Malaysia. Additionally, it is not uncommon to subdivide the ward into multiple units that hold 4 patients or up to 6 patients. Another practice is to have 1 patient per room as stipulated in [5] , which is particularly common in the United States. However, multiple-bed configurations with defined limitations are allowed for the intensive care unit and critical care unit. Compared with other clinical spaces such as operating rooms and isolation rooms, which are studied thoroughly, the aforementioned spaces are limited to one person and a few healthcare workers, such as doctors and nurses. Depending on the activities conducted and the affected floor area of a ward, these spaces are much more constrained compared with operating theatres. Furthermore, multiplebed hospital wards require lower capital expenditure, which is why they are more widely used in developing countries compared with single-patient rooms.",

This type of ward caters up to 30 adults or 24 children and is still widely used in many developing countries. Bay wards have a central nurses' station and cubicle rooms, which house several beds.

More than 75% of the respondents were neutral in their preferences, even when there was only a 40% conformance to ASHRAE recommendations of comfort zone. This view is also consistent with the findings of Nicol [27] and Mallick [28] . Nicol [27] presented evidence and methods that complement existing standards, such as ISO 7730, using adaptive thermal comfort standards derived from local subjective measurements. With this criterion, the comfort range can be above or below 2e3 C of the optimal figure and be considered satisfactory. In addition, Mallick [28] suggested that for people in a warm humid climate, comfort perceptions are governed by local acclimatisation to high temperatures and humidity. As a result from his study, the comfort temperature range is between 24 C and 32 C with relative humidity values between 50% and 90% with or without air movements in the selected space.",

It was also concluded that thermal stratification locking contributes to the concentrated layer of exhaled droplet nuclei in displacement ventilation. The study has also shown that bed distances of up to 1.0 m do not make any significant impact on the personal exposure level of the pollutant released from one bed to another.

Satisfying this condition will stop the spread of airborne pollutants between rooms as much as possible. For example, protective isolation rooms are required to be negative pressure rooms [1, 2, 5] . A negative pressure room includes a ventilation system that facilitates airflows from the corridors into the negative pressure room, ensuring that polluted air shall not leak out from the isolation room to another hospital space, as shown in Fig. 5 . An operating theatre ventilation system has been researched widely in terms of room layout, pressurisation and air distributions to create ultra-clean ventilation from laminar airflow systems [35, 36] . Operating theatre areas are prone to surgical site infection risks caused by airborne bacteria, which subsequently led to the current technical standards, such as the Health Technical Memorandum and microbial measurement tools [37] . Additionally, clean room technology standards are being recommended to select the bacterial threshold limits in operating rooms [38] . Ho et al. [39] presented a three-dimensional analysis for pollutant removal and thermal comfort in an operating room where air flows from high sidewall grilles and is exhausted through low sidewall grilles on the opposed walls. Consequently, supply grilles, which are located at the centre of the room, showed better effectiveness. This result again confirmed that airflow patterns substantially influence the efficacy of thermal comfort and pollutant removals. Furthermore, Rui et al. [40] established the critical outlet velocities in an operating room; exceeding the critical outlet velocity increases bacteria deposits, especially in upper surfaces.",

It was concluded that it is impossible to produce unidirectional flow according to the CDC recommendation of 4 ACH. Similarly, Philips et al. [43] demonstrated that it is not easy to ensure that an entire room space achieves the 12 ACH requirements even with a 15 ACH supply rate to the room, and the minimum ACH rate does not adequately ventilate the room. Additionally, the use of age-of-contaminant for comparing the efficiency of different ventilation solutions was recommended. Bryant also reiterated on the intricacy of the airflow and aerosol dispersion patterns within an isolation room and highlighted the importance of protecting the hospital staff that treat patients with infectious disease [44] .",

Furthermore, another study was conducted utilising a CFD simulation to investigate the effects of a moving person and the movement of a sliding door in an isolation room.

A mechanical ventilation system significantly helps to improve the indoor environment. Also, natural ventilation is being explored to improve the indoor environment quality. Mixing ventilation and displacement ventilation are the most prevalent principles used to design ventilation systems, which when combined with other engineering controls, such as filtration and UVGI, can significantly improve the indoor environment. These systems need further optimisation for tropical conditions. CFD modelling is a valued tool for analysing airflow and evaluating ventilation systems. Recent reviews have focused on specialised clinical areas, such as operating rooms and isolation rooms. Different conditions have been simulated and verified with field measurements. However, specific studies are needed for multiplebed wards to bridge the knowledge gap regarding the thermal comfort, pollutant removals and transmission risk of airborne diseases.
