We chose a period 2 weeks earlier than for the molecular diagnosis data for COVID-2019. Two keywords, 'coronavirus' and 'pneumonia', were used in Google Trends. The respective Chinese terms, '\u51a0\u72b6\u75c5 \u6bd2' and '\u80ba\u708e' were used in Baidu Index, the most popular web search engine in China, and Sina Weibo Index, a social media platform widely used in China. The peak number of search queries in Baidu was 682,888 for 'coronavirus' and 760,460 for 'pneumonia', both on 25 January 2020. The peak number of posts on Sina Weibo was 26,297,746 for 'coronavirus' and 30,704,753 for 'pneumonia', both on 21 January 2020. Google Trends does not provide the raw number of search queries but the number normalised to the peak number. The peaks for both keywords on Google Trends were reached on 25 January 2020. Figure 1 shows the overall trends of data from the keyword search for 'coronavirus' (or '\u51a0\u72b6\u75c5\u6bd2') and 'pneumonia' (or '\u80ba\u708e') via Google Trends, Baidu Index and Sina Weibo Index, and the number of daily new laboratory-confirmed and suspected COVID-19 cases. The data from Baidu Index, Sina Weibo Index and national COVID-19 daily incidence data were also normalised to the peak number, so that the values fall into the same range (0-100) during that period. We found a high correlation with the Internet search data (r > 0.7) 8-10 days earlier for new laboratory-confirmed cases, and 5-7 days earlier for new suspected cases.",

However, our results showed a much longer lag time for reported new laboratory-confirmed and suspected COVID-19 cases compared with digital surveillance data. There are several explanations. Firstly, COVID-19 is a novel disease just recently recognised. The first version of a guideline for diagnosis and management of COVID-19 was announced on 16 January 2020. It took time for the medical professionals to learn about the virus and the disease in order to make correct diagnosis. Secondly, the diagnosis of COVID-19 requires two independent confirmatory laboratory tests, which should be taken at least 1 day apart. Our results showed that the lag correlation is shorter for the suspected than for laboratory-confirmed cases. Thirdly, the supply of laboratory testing kits may have been insufficient in the early stages of the coronavirus outbreak, which would have limited the number of patients that can be confirmed. Finally, the Internet searches and social media mentions are not only initiated by the patients and their family members, but also globally by the general public who are concerned about this rapidly spreading disease.",

A possible explanation is that the Google is not a major search engine used in China, where Baidu and Sina Weibo are widely used. The peak in the Sina Weibo Index was reached earlier than in Google Trends and Baidu Index. This suggests that Sina Weibo, which also serves as a social medium, disseminated the information faster than traditional websites.",

On 8 January 2020, a novel coronavirus was identified as the cause of this disease. The disease was first named Novel coronavirus pneumonia by the NHC of China on 8 February and later 'coronavirus disease 2019' (abbreviated 'COVID-19') on 11 February by the WHO. Our search period was defined from January 16 to February 11. Therefore, we think that the two keywords 'pneumonia' and 'coronavirus' were sufficient to include most Internet content related to COVID-19 in this period. We also used other terms such as '\u65b0\u51a0' (novel coronavirus), '\u65b0\u578b\u51a0\u72b6\u75c5\u6bd2\u80ba\u708e' (novel coronavirus pneumonia) as keywords but they returned much smaller numbers of queries and posts and we did therefore not include them in the analysis.",

On Google, the keyword 'coronavirus' had the highest correlation coefficient (r = 0.958) with daily new laboratory-confirmed cases, and 'pneumonia' had the highest correlation coefficient with daily new suspected cases (r = 0.960). We found the same pattern in the Baidu Index and Sina Weibo Index. An explanation could be that 'coronavirus' is linked to the viral pathogen which should be investigated by a laboratory test, while 'pneumonia' is a clinical term and should link stronger to the suspected cases that are based on clinical and imaging evidence.",
