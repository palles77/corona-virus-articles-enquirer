A diverse group of scientists met in Hawaii in March 2005 to discuss the linked social and ecological contexts in which infectious diseases emerge. A subset of the meeting was a group that focused on ''transdisciplinary approaches'' to integrating knowledge across and beyond academic disciplines in order to improve prevention and control of emerging infections. This article is based on the discussions of that group. Here, we outline the epidemiological legacy that has dominated infectious disease research and control up until now, and introduce the role of new, transdisciplinary and systems-based approaches to emerging infectious diseases. We describe four cases of transboundary health issues and use them to discuss the potential benefits, as well as the inherent difficulties, in understanding the social-ecological contexts in which infectious diseases occur and of using transdisciplinary approaches to deal with them.",

That optimism relied on ignoring signs of impending trouble such as chemical resistance by microbes and their vectors, inadequate antiviral medications, growth of unsanitary megacities, globalized trade and travel of humans and animals, microbially unsafe factory farming and food-processing, and altered human-animal interactions in a rapidly changing landscape. Evidence of the difficulty of controlling infectious diseases through conventional biomedical strategies lies in the long list of human pathogens that have emerged and reemerged in the last three decades: Variant Creutzfeld-Jakob disease, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Nipah virus, avian influenza, Marburg virus, Lyme disease, HIV/AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis, cholera, plague, dengue, leptospirosis, and West Nile virus, to name a few (Taylor et al., 2001) . The fact that these and other diseases have emerged from a wide taxonomic variety of hosts is evidence of the ''metaphenomenon'' of a global increase in emerging infectious diseases (EIDs).",

            "text": "A symposium entitled ''Emerging Infectious Diseases and Social-Ecological Systems'' was held in Honolulu, Hawaii in March 2005. The meeting was designed to facilitate interdisciplinary integration as part of the National Institutes of Health Roadmap initiative ''Research Teams of the Future'' and was hosted by the East West Centre and the Asia-Pacific Institute of Tropical Medicine and Infectious Diseases. The ideas expressed here reflect the experiences and lessons of a group of scholars with expertise in fields ranging from social science to international development, ecology, and various branches of veterinary and human medicine. The article represents the collective ideas of a working group whose task was to focus on the role of ''transdisciplinary approaches'' as a means to integrate knowledge across and beyond academic disciplines; to enhance our understanding of the social and ecological contexts of infectious disease and, ultimately, to improve prevention and control of emerging infections. The meeting themes of interdisciplinary integration and application of a coupled, human-natural systems approach to emerging infectious disease are elaborated further by Lewis (2005) and Wilcox and Colwell (2005) . While significant successes in controlling infectious diseases, such as antibiotics, vaccines, vector reduction, and water purification, have been achieved through highly specific technological interventions, the rate and scale of global change in agriculture, trade, demographics, species translocations and invasions, microbial adaptation, and other complex factors, have evidently outstripped our ability to understand and respond to EIDs, and exposed serious limitations of approaches that fail to engage with the wider contexts from which infectious diseases emerge. In addition to environmental change, social factors such as income inequalities and governance and social power dynamics add another layer of complexity to the task of understanding and responding to emerging infections. Responding to the EID challenges listed in the first paragraph, therefore, demands attention to the interconnections among social and ecological systems at scales ranging from the village to the globe. Accomplishing this will require new forms of knowledge that integrate the natural and human sciences, attend to dynamics at multiple scales-both spatial and temporal-and engage diverse ways of understanding and intervening.",

            "text": "At the start of the 20th century, western European thought relied primarily on two disciplines to explain and control infectious diseases: microbiology and epidemiology. Early pioneers such as Snow, Koch, and Budd knew that social factors had a strong influence on infections; later researchers like Manson, Ross, and Chagas discovered vector-borne diseases, revealing the importance of transmission ecology. Research from these two periods led to the agent-hostenvironment model of infectious disease, which still serves as the central model for examining emergence of specific diseases. However, this model fails to shed light on the largescale social and ecological settings in which the metaphenomenon of increased EID emergence is taking place. Modern epidemiology's limited ability to thoroughly and systematically address global EID emergence is partly due to the fact that, after drug treatments and disease-vector controls were developed, many epidemiologists shifted their efforts from understanding epidemics of infectious diseases to studying individual risk factors for chronic diseases. Epidemiology's main focus became noncommunicable diseases such as obesity, asthma, vascular disease, cancer, substance abuse, and depression. Epidemiologists in the South were particularly critical of this paradigm, on the grounds that it did not explain large-scale influences affecting groups, and that its ethical and theoretical foundations were flawed (Breilh, 1995) . In the North, Krieger called for epidemiological research to engage with the ''web of causation'' (Krieger, 2004) . The debates and theories of the 1990s led to the establishment of ecoepidemiology (group level effects), life-course epidemiology (time sequences, socio-biology and intergenerational effects) and social epidemiology (social causation) (Evans et al., 1994; Commentaries, 1998; Ben-Shloma and Kuh, 2002) .",

For instance, in Latin America, unequal distribution and access to resources, as well as institutionalized racism, class, and gender inequalities, were given primacy in theories of disease causation, with emphasis on holistic explanatory accounts of infection based on the triangulation of quantitative and qualitative research methods (Laurell, 1989; Almeida-Filho and Goldbaum, 2004) , and the transformative potential of ''social ecosystems'' (Breilh, 1991) . Elsewhere, scientists studying the ''ecology of infectious disease'' (Real, 1996; Smith et al., 2005) did not necessarily focus on human pathogens but offered biophysical insights with far-reaching implications for epidemiological and biomedical thinking (Wilcox, 2005) . As the century ended, calls for integration of social and ecological determinants of health penetrated epidemiology and public health, and ranged from socio-ecologic systems perspective (McMichael, 1999) , to a proposal for an ''ecosocial'' approach to health (Krieger, 2001) . A convergence of systemsbased concepts with health and epidemiological research and policy was finally occurring (Parkes et al., 2003, Table 1 ), with obvious application in research that responds to the linked social and environmental risk factors of emerging infections (Weiss and McMichael, 2004) .",

''Ecosystem approaches'' to health (Waltner-Toews, 2001; Lebel, 2003; De Plaen and Kilelu, 2004) offer examples of research methods that explicitly engage with the ecological and social systems within which health is created and challenged, although these approaches were not developed specifically for EID investigation. However, these and other systems-based approaches provide some common principles with which to help understand the nested, interdependent systems in which diseases emerge, maintain themselves, and evolve on a multitude of levels-molecular, organismal, communal, national, and global (Wilcox and Colwell, 2005) . Understanding of these ''nested hierarchies'' is complemented by the idea of coupled human-natural systems, in which humans are both part of nature and fundamentally conditioned by social activity. This recognition, in turn, encourages researchers to incorporate into their methods and research design the idea that ''delineation between social systems and ecosystems is artificial and arbitrary'' (Berkes et al., 2003, p 2) . Research that explicitly engages with the complexity of systems' interactions (Kay et al., 1999) , and the associated concepts of adaptation and resilience (Holling, 2001) , offer valuable precedents and fertile ground for understanding the social, ecological, and economic contexts in which EIDs occur. Yet, despite these developments, systematic formulation, development, and application of approaches that integrate the social and ecological aspects of disease emergence into research paradigms has not yet occurred. The role of transdisciplinary approaches in helping to achieve such an integration is the central theme of this article.",

McDonnell proposes that for interdisciplinary studies ''the connection is relational, i.e., where the disciplines collaborate in such a way that each takes up some of the assumptions and worldviews and languages of the others,'' whereas for transdisciplinarity ''the integrating language relationship is taken to the extent of there being a transcendent language, a metalanguage, in which the terms of all the participant disciplines are, or can be, expressed.'' Similarly, Lattuca (2003, p 7) distinguishes synthetic interdisciplinarity, such as arises when teaching issues and research questions ''bridge'' disciplines, from transdisciplinarity, where research questions ''cross'' disciplines and the intent is to develop an overarching synthesis where ''the theories, concepts, or methods are not borrowed from one discipline and applied to another, but rather transcend disciplines and are therefore applicable in many fields.'' These distinctions have several implications for devising transdisciplinary approaches to EID control.",

Albrecht et al. also describe the following as potentially useful elements of transdisciplinary inquiries: the assemblage of a collaborative transdisciplinary team, review of existing knowledge, design and implementation of specific inquiries, data synthesis-with the hoped-for outcomes of creating or enhancing a conceptual synthesis (such as a ''common conceptual framework''), and formulating a detailed plan for intervention. Thus, transdisciplinary methodology influences all stages of inquiry-determining research questions as well as design and analysis-even while traditional disciplinary tools, techniques, and methods may examine aspects of the overall synthesis. As such, transdisciplinary approaches can be seen to emerge from systems of knowledge and interrelationships, in the same way that EIDs can be understood as emergent systemic phenomena. Furthermore, the resulting innovations for treatment, prevention, and control of EIDs may be targeted at multiple levels of the social and ecological systems within which diseases arise, which ought to make interventions more successful and longer-lasting.",

(2005) describe as individual, local, specialized, strategic, and holistic knowledge perspectives, provides a variety of new ''hands'' that can be utilized on deck. Important practical, ethical, and political implications accompany the inclusion of these new ''hands'' and nonacademic voices. This is highlighted by Lebel (2003) in his linking of ''transdisciplinarity,'' ''participation,'' and ''equity'' through their roles as the three pillars of ''ecosystem approaches to human health.' ' Breilh (2003) argues that it is impossible to understand the dynamics and conditions of human infectious diseases without embedding them within the (often inequitable) social relations in which they reside. Approaches to EID control that successfully integrate considerations of participation and equity into their strategies are likely to raise questions about global and local forces driving social and ecological change, and about the needs of those most vulnerable to infectious diseases, in particular women and children (Gerberding, 2004; McDonald et al., 2004) , thereby engaging explicitly with the political economy of health (Krieger, 2001) .",

In Malaysia, Nipah virus was transmitted to humans through an intermediate host, pigs. In its initial outbreak over a 35-week period, the virus caused a severe febrile encephalitis in 265 patients, of whom 115 died; 93% of the patients worked in the pigrearing industry (Lam, 2003) . Preceding the outbreak in humans was an outbreak of encephalitis and respiratory disease in pigs (Mohd Nor, 2000) . The virus spread to various regions of Malaysia via movement of infected pigs, then briefly to Singapore. Economic losses in Malaysia were estimated at US $500 million (Lam, 2003) .

Ecological theories of emergence include hypotheses that fire haze from slash-and-burn agriculture negatively affected fruiting trees and led bats to seek out fruit trees planted around pig farms. Though the ecosystem-scale drivers of bat foraging behavior are poorly understood, certainly the proximity of fruit trees and intensive pig farms allowed bats and pigs to come into close contact, which allowed spill-over of the Nipah virus from its reservoir host into domestic pigs, and then to humans.",

These factors range from global socio-economic pressures driving the development of intensive agriculture in Malaysia, to regional and local occupational trends leading farm laborers to seek employment on intensive pig farms, and possibly increased contact between bats and humans due to suburban encroachment on bat habitat. Furthermore, feedback loops acting positively (in terms of its relationship with its intermediate pig host) or negatively (in terms of effects on the Malaysian economy) for the virus are reminders that social and ecological systems interact at multiple spatial and temporal scales. The challenges of capturing the complexity of this zoonotic disease outbreak, particularly its social-ecological dynamics, will be explored in the discussion section.",

Ertan's completion was threatened when a live snail of a species known to carry schistosomiasis was discovered in the reservoir area 4 years before it was to be flooded. Three years later, after expensive efforts to survey vulnerable upstream areas, spray molluscicides, engineer snail-resistant water channels, and improve management of human and animal waste, the area was recertified snail-free. No outbreak of schistosomiasis has occurred to date (Gu et al., 2001) , but other infections (such as HIV and other infectious diseases resulting from high-risk behaviors and vulnerability of populations affected by the dams), and general health effects (endemic diseases of poverty, despair, inadequate water supplies, poor sanitation, and malnutrition) remain undocumented and unaddressed (Sleigh and Jackson, 2001) . The Ertan case exemplifies the limitations of studying through a single lens complex issues that, by their nature, transcend single disciplines, sectors, and/or diseases. The case provides an excellent opportunity to consider how a more holistic, more integrated health assessment could have been conducted-one that would have recognized the social and ecological impacts of dams as drivers of EIDs and related determinants of health.",

These influences may vary over space and time with implications for both health and development paradigms. A flood may increase vulnerability by disrupting crop cultivation or harvest resulting in loss of income in the short term, but in the long term may replenish the fertile alluvial soil and reduce dependence on external fertilizers. Likewise, in the short term, an irrigation canal may enable dry-season cultivation and enhanced income generation. This may reduce vulnerability through poverty reduction, but also provide new habitats for disease vectors and/or salinization of soils not suitable for dry-season irrigation, thus decreasing crop-yields, and increasing poverty and vulnerability in the long term.

Yet, just as single-discipline researchers need to maintain a healthy critique of their contributions, so too must those who seek to develop and utilize transdisciplinary approaches engage their abilities to analyze and criticize their contributions. Though integrated conceptual frameworks and disease control measures founded on complex understandings of social and ecological systems may be informative and grounded, they may not always be feasible or universally desired. A large portion of the mainstream biomedical community is biased against complex social, political, and environmental research on the grounds that such research often depends on more variable, hard-to-measure factors. Those dealing with EID threats will need to remain aware that, while multilayered approaches may produce results that more accurately reflect the uncertainty of real life, such approaches may be challenged on the basis that they often do not lend themselves to straightforward, rapidly-implemented policies or interventions (Ravetz, 2005) .",

The successes, and policy relevance, of these approaches will be key to their institutionalization (Lebel, 2004) . Additionally, teams and communities of transdisciplinary researchers must communicate their successes and failures so that they are understood by a wide range of audiences and measured by appropriate indices, particularly because holistic systems-based research can take a long time to complete and tends not to make the same splash as large drug or vaccine trials. Substantial outreach and education efforts will be required to achieve these goals, which include communication with, and participation by, those whose health is being studied as well as by decision-makers at multiple levels, from emergency physicians and veterinarians to funding agencies and global policy makers.",

Although each was initiated based on a ''simple'' problem (mercury poisoning in Brazil, cystic echinococcosis in Nepal), both led to profound and positive social-ecological transformations of communities through a combination of local engagement and ongoing research. Other examples of successful approaches to disease management are coming to light, whether in ''acute'' cases such as the SARS outbreak, or for long-term disease control, such as of onchocerciasis in West Africa, and Chagas' disease in Brazil (Hotez et al., 2004) . The past few years have seen wide acceptance by the infectious disease and public health communities that changing land-use patterns (e.g., deforestation, urban and suburban encroachment on wildlands), along with migration and air travel, are playing a major role in infectious disease transmission (Hotez et al., 2004; Patz et al., 2004; IOM, 2005) . This recognition could pave the way for the current practice of studying one outbreak at a time to be replaced by more powerful approaches that seek to understand and explain the metaphenomenon of emergence from multiple hosts in multiple settings.",

It is no longer enough for scientists to hone their own corners of research to perfection, and assume someone else (who?) will put it all together. Increased sophistication in efforts to incorporate systemsbased concepts regarding ecology, health, and sustainability into professional curricula (Howard, 2004; Howard and Rapport, 2004 ) is a step in the right direction for a new generation of researchers. We must also find ways to cultivate leadership in the current generation of researchers because it is they who will be required to build the collegial and collaborative platforms from which to bridge disciplines and policy, and make useful contributions in the multistakeholder arena of EID investigation and control. Critical skills will be required to identify how, when, and where disciplinary, interdisciplinary, and transdisciplinary approaches will be required in building responses to disease emergence.

Transdisciplinarity transports us: we then ask different questions, we see further, and we perceive the complex world and its problems with new insights.'' (McMichael, 2000, p 220) .
