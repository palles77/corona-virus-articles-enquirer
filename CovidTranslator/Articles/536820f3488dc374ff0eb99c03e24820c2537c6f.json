Padmaja A new class of amido linked bis heterocycles viz., pyrrolyl/pyrazolyl-oxazoles, thiazoles and imidazoles were prepared by 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition of Tos-MIC and diazomethane to the respective cinnamamide derivatives and screened for antimicrobial activity. The chlorosubstituted imidazolyl cinnamamide (6c) is the most potential antimicrobial agent as it displayed strong antibacterial activity against B. subtilis and antifungal activity against Penicillium chrysogenum.
