Rates of nosocomial infection in patients requiring more than 1 week of advanced life support within an ICU are three to fi ve times higher than in hospitalized patients who do not require ICU care. [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] Infection, usually nosocomial, is the most common cause of death, directly or indirectly, of patients who survive the early period after major trauma or full-thickness burns and is the most commonly identifi ed cause of multiple-organ dysfunction syndrome. [9] [10] [11] Although most of this book focuses on the diagnosis and management of critically ill patients in the ICU, nosocomial infections are clearly one of the most common and serious complications of ICU care and are usually a consequence of invasive monitoring or life support therapies. Thus they are greatly preventable, and it is appropriate that measures to prevent nosocomial infections be addressed.",

In the future, device-associated infection rates will be sought in accreditation reviews by the Joint Commission on the Accreditation of Healthcare Orga-nizations (JCAHO) 31 as this infl uential organization continues to move toward measurement of patient outcomes as the most effective way to improve patient care in the United States.",

Many patients admitted to an ICU are intrinsically more susceptible to infection because of underlying diseases or conditions associated with impaired immunity such as cancer, trauma, 46 or advanced age 47 or because of immunosuppression associated with malnutrition 48 or therapy with corticosteroids, 49 cancer chemotherapeutic agents, 50 or other immunosuppressive drugs. 51 Moreover, many drugs have indirect effects that increase susceptibility to infection, such as narcotics or sedatives that impair the capacity to protect the airway, or antacids or H 2 -histamine receptor antagonists that neutralize gastric acidity, producing gastric overgrowth by gram-negative bacilli, 52 increasing the risk of nosocomial pneumonia. 53 Even transfusion therapy produces immunosuppression and increases the risk of nosocomial infection. 54 Moreover, most nosocomial pathogens exhibit resistance to antibiotics (see Figs. 51-1 and 51-2), 42, 43, [55] [56] [57] [58] and many are also more virulent because of (1) their capacity to subsist or even multiply in aqueous reservoirs for prolonged periods (e.g., pseudomonads 59 or Legionella pneumophila 60 ); (2) the elaboration of endotoxins (e.g., all of the gramnegative bacilli) or exotoxins (P. aeruginosa, 61 C. diffi cile, 62 or S. aureus 63 ); or (3) the production of adhesions 64 or exoglycocalyx 65 (e.g., coagulase-negative staphylococci), conferring the capacity to adhere avidly and form biofi lms on biologic and prosthetic surfaces resistant to host defenses 66 and even antibiotics. 67 Because most patients in ICUs receive broad-spectrum antibiotics, resistant nosocomial organisms have an enormous ecologic advantage and, in Darwinian fashion, predictably supplant the normal cutaneous, respiratory, and gastrointestinal fl ora. In most cases, colonization is the fi rst step in the progression to nosocomial infection, 68 especially if the patient is already vulnerable because of underlying disease, if the organism is more virulent or resistant to antibiotics, or if the patient has invasive medical devices that assist invasion by colonizing organisms, bypassing or further impairing host defenses.",

Airborne spread of gramnegative bacilli is probably rare unless unusual environmental circumstances generate massively contaminated aerosols. 85 Increasing evidence suggests that many nosocomial infections acquired in the ICU derive from resistant organisms of enteric origin [86] [87] [88] [89] or present on skin 86, 87 or in the lower respiratory tract 88 on admission to the ICU.

SENIC was launched by a survey of all U.S. hospitals to determine the characteristics of infection control programs and was completed in 1975-1976 by a review of more than 339,000 patient medical records in 338 randomly selected hospitals. 114 The SENIC found that hospitals reduced their nosocomial infection rates by approximately 32% if their surveil- 117 It is hoped that surveillance and control programs will continue to evolve. Prevention of nosocomial infections is a major priority of the U.S. Public Health Service, 118 JCAHO, 31 and the Institute of Medicine. 119 With the shift to prospective-payment reimbursement, hospitals now have a powerful fi nancial incentive to reduce their rates of nosocomial infection, 120 and it can be anticipated that efforts to prevent hospital-acquired infections will assume ever greater importance.",

Because total surveillance (of all infections) is labor intensive, most hospitals now focus their surveillance efforts on infections that are associated with high morbidity (e.g., nosocomial pneumonia), that greatly increase health care costs (e.g., postcardiac surgery sternotomy infections), that are caused by antibioticresistant organisms with potential for spread (e.g., MRSA, C. diffi cile), or that are highly preventable (e.g., intravascular device-related bloodstream infections). 116, 122 The 1990s were characterized by major efforts by hospitals to apply to the numerous facets of health care principles of quality improvement developed by industry. Hospital infection control programs have been working on quality improvement for 20 years 123 but, infl uenced by JCAHO, were probably too heavily focused on process, namely, policies and procedures, rather than documenting outcome vis-\u00e0-vis reduced infection rates. Infection control programs in most U.S. hospitals are now closely allied with their institutional quality improvement departments. 123, 124 Hospital infection control programs are also regulated by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) in terms of institutional standards and programs to protect HCWs from bloodborne pathogens 125 and tuberculosis 126 ; the Environmental Protection Agency 127 has also published regulations in terms of disposal and tracking of medical waste-only a small fraction of which is truly biohazardous. 128 Finally, it is essential that all health care personnel working in an ICU receive training in the epidemiology and control of nosocomial infections. This may be most important for house offi cers in teaching hospitals, who commonly enter the ICU with only the most rudimentary knowledge of asepsis but have hands-on contact with numerous patients each day. ICU physicians and nurses must be especially familiar with their hospitals' guidelines for the management of invasive devices, particularly intravascular catheters of all types, 129 urinary catheters, 130 endotracheal tubes, 131 and tracheostomies. 131 Moreover, all physicians need to be made aware that broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy greatly increases the risks of superinfection by antibiotic-resistant bacteria and Candida, as well as antibiotic-associated colitis caused by C. diffi cile.",

Sifting through these data can be time consuming, and developing electronic information systems that streamline this process is essential to improving the effi ciency of the infection control program. Commercial software programs that can automate this process are now available. Many of these programs automatically collate microbiologic data, provide rudimentary geographic information, and perform basic statistical analyses that can assist in the surveillance of nosocomial infections and identifi cation of potential outbreaks. 135, 136 Reporting cumulative summaries of antimicrobial susceptibility data (antibiograms) is another essential responsibility of the clinical microbiology laboratory. 137, 138 When implemented appropriately, the timely dissemination of antibiograms helps guide the choice of empiric antimicrobials, pending the results of clinical cultures, and provides valuable data to help the infection control department monitor institutional antimicrobial resistance trends and identify potential outbreaks. 139 The Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute-formerly the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards-recommends that institutional antibiograms be updated at least annually and has recently published standards for their content and format. 140 Automated electronic systems for collating and disseminating nearly real-time antibiograms along with antibiotic-use decision support exist and, when implemented properly, have been effective in improving antimicrobial utilization within the hospital setting. 141, 142 Monitoring of sterilizers with spore tests, environmental sampling, and advanced microbiologic support for epidemiologic investigations are additional responsibilities expected of most clinical microbiology laboratories, although some university hospital programs have dedicated personnel within their infection control programs who perform these activities. 134 The clinical microbiology laboratory is a key resource in the investigation of a suspected outbreak. One of the fi rst and foremost actions when a nosocomial outbreak is suspected is to immediately retrieve all available isolates of the putative epidemic pathogen for possible subtyping. 143 The need to move rapidly becomes apparent when it is realized that most hospital laboratories discard cultures as soon as the isolates have been fully characterized.",

Despite this level of surface colonization, early studies found that the inanimate environment-surfaces, walls, and even air-does not contribute materially to the occurrence of most nosocomial infections, 154 other than invasive infections caused by airborne Aspergillus and other fi lamentous fungi in seriously immunocompromised patients. 36, 37 Although inanimate surfaces may rarely be involved in the direct transmission of infection to patients, more recent evidence suggests that surfaces may well play an important role in the nosocomial acquisition of patho- Isolates subjected to Dra1 endonuclease digestion from machines or endoscopes and from patients in three centers using an Olympus automated Endoscope Washer. Lanes 1 and 2, from the University of Wisconsin Hospital and Clinics, 3 and 4 from Center B, and 5 and 6 from Center C also show concordance between each institution's machine or endoscope isolate and patient isolate. Lanes 7 and 8 contain unrelated (control) strains of P. aeruginosa. The use of molecular subtyping strongly supported the epidemiologic studies, causally implicating contaminated endoscope washers in the genesis of endoscopy-associated nosocomial P. aeruginosa infections in U.S. centers using the fl awed washer.

This indirect route of infection is of particular importance in the ICU, where all patients are heavily exposed to invasive devices and have a high risk of infection. In the ICU the inanimate environment may become a reservoir for the transmission of resistant nosocomial organisms such as MRSA, 155, 156 C. diffi cile, 80, 157 VRE 152, 158 and gram-negative bacilli such as Klebsiella spp., Acinetobacter spp., and Enterobacter organisms. 159, 160 Studies have shown that enhanced surface decontamination with hypochlorite-containing cleaning solutions has been necessary to terminate outbreaks caused by C. diffi cile 161 and Acinetobacter baumanii. 153 Although the ICU environment cannot be made microbe free, certain organizational, architectural, and environmental issues must be addressed with the design or remodeling of an ICU. The capacity to systematically improve the care of critically ill patients and prevent nosocomial infection requires a structural foundation on which the processes of care can be optimized (i.e., make it easy for HCWs to do it right and diffi cult to do it wrong). Accountability for compliance with critical policies and procedures and ongoing assessment of outcomes needs to be built into the administrative structure of the ICU.",

Adequate staffi ng cannot be overemphasized; numerous studies have found greatly increased rates of nosocomial infection when ICUs are staffed suboptimally or when staffi ng requirements are met with temporary personnel who are unfamiliar with ICU infection control policies and procedures. 162, 163 In a large nosocomial outbreak of Enterobacter cloacae infection in a neonatal ICU, Harbarth and colleagues 164 found that infection rates during periods of understaffi ng were strikingly higher than during periods with adequate levels of staffi ng (RR = 6, 95% CI = 2.2 to 16.4). The effects of understaffi ng are likely multiple; however, erosion of basic hygienic practices with excessive patient-to-staff ratios likely explains much of this phenomenon. 165 Many of the published recommendations for ICU architectural design 166 are empiric, and evidence that they reduce rates of nosocomial infection is, by and large, lacking. Although more research is necessary before specifi c features of ICU design achieve a level of evidence suffi cient for an evidence-based guideline, certain facets of the ICU layout deserve attention: \u25a0 ICUs should be located in areas that limit traffi c fl ow to essential ICU personnel. \u25a0 ICU facilities should be designed with ICU professionals in mind, ensuring appropriate space, resources, and environment for day-to-day operations. 166 Recognizing the growing variety and complexity of life support equipment required for the care of many patients, each cubicle or room should provide a minimum of 11 m 2 per bed. 167 The area should be large enough to accom-modate the bed and all equipment yet allow immediate access to the patient at all times from both sides of the bed. Adequate space must also be provided for storage of nursing supplies. Facilities for disposal of biohazardous waste (e.g., bedpan fl ushers); for cleaning, reprocessing, and storage of ICU equipment; and for storage of housekeeping supplies should be separate from patient care areas. Single-patient rooms may increase the likelihood of handwashing being done and improve compliance with isolation practices, reducing the risk of cross-infection. For example, Mulin and colleagues 168 found that converting from an open unit to single rooms in their ICU greatly reduced rates of patient colonization with A. baumanii, and Shirani and colleagues 169 found that renovation of their burn unit to include separate bed enclosures reduced rates of nosocomial infection by 48%. 169 \u25a0 Materials used for fi xtures, furniture, and other surfaces should be smooth and easy to clean; surfaces made of porous materials foster bacterial colonization. 170 \u25a0 An adequate number of sinks must be available for convenient handwashing by ICU personnel. Ideally, a sink should be located at the entrance of each cubicle or patient room to encourage handwashing by all entering personnel who will have contact with the patient or the immediate environment. 171, 172 Separate sinks should be used for cleaning and reprocessing contaminated equipment. Sinks and sink drains are normally contaminated by pseudomonads, 173 although their role in the epidemiology of nosocomial infection is as yet unclear. However, sinks should be designed to minimize aerosol formation and splashback. \u25a0 All ICUs should be equipped with one or more class A isolation rooms, 200 which include an anteroom for gowning and handwashing and the necessary modifi cations (negative pressure, roofl ine exhaust) to permit it to be used for patients with tuberculosis or other airborne infections such as chickenpox, measles, disseminated HSV infection or a highly contagious emerging pathogen such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) human coronavirus. If an ICU treats bone marrow transplant patients or other patients with prolonged severe granulocytopenia, positive-pressure isolation rooms using high-effi ciency particle-arrest (HEPA) fi lters should be available. Isolation rooms for patients with infections transmitted by the respiratory route or to protect profoundly granulocytopenic patients must be kept closed to maintain control over the direction of airfl ow. \u25a0 A centralized, fi ltered air-handling system that provides at least six room-exchanges per hour is essential. 167, 174 Ideally, each patient's room should have the capacity of being set at positive or negative pressure with respect to the rest of the unit; if it cannot be, the room should be maintained permanently at positive pressure.",

[186] [187] [188] Despite the ubiquity of water systems colonized with Legionella species and studies demonstrating a correlation between the level of colonization and risk of infection, the CDC does not recommend routine surveillance of hospital water systems, 181 although this stance is controversial. 183 Researchers from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and the Allegheny County Health Department have recommended a more proactive stepwise approach that involves initial surveillance of hospital water for Legionella contamination, regardless of the presence or absence of institutional nosocomial legionellosis, followed by continued surveillance based on the level of water contamination found or the presence of institutional legionellosis. 183 Legionella species are resistant to chlorine and heat, making it challenging to eradicate them from contaminated hospital water systems. 188 Attempts to hyperchlorinate hospital water have been partially successful if chlorine levels are continuously maintained between 2 and 6 parts per million at all times but produce rapidly accelerated corrosion of water pipes and are expensive. 189 Thermal eradication is feasible, using a \"heat-and-fl ush\" method to raise water tank temperatures to greater than 70\u00b0 C and distal water sites to >60\u00b0 C for short periods of time. 190 Although effective, super-heating is labor intensive and there is the constant fear that patients or health care personnel may sustain scald injuries if they wash or shower with tap water during a fl ushing period. The use of technologies such as instantaneous steam heat for incoming water 190 and ultraviolet light 191 are technically feasible with newer hospital water systems but may be incompatible with older hospital water systems.",

Surveillance of the hospital water system found that 75% of all samples contained low levels of L. pneumophila, which were shown to be clonally related to the 10 cases of nosocomial legionellosis.

Critical objects, which are introduced directly into the bloodstream or into other normally sterile areas of the body, such as surgical instruments, cardiac catheters, and implanted devices, must be reliably sterile and sterilized with steam, gas, hydrogen peroxide gas, or chemical sterilization. Semicritical items, which come into contact with intact mucous membranes, such as fi beroptic endoscopes, endotracheal tubes, or ventilator circuit tubing, can be decontaminated between patients by pasteurization or the use of high-level chemical disinfection with glutaraldehyde, peracetic acid, hydrogen peroxide, ethyl alcohol, or hypochlorite. Noncritical items, which normally come into contact only with intact skin, such as blood pressure cuffs or electrocardiograph electrodes, require hygienic cleansing or low-level disinfection with an iodophor, hypochlorite, quaternary ammonium or phenolic disinfectants, or alcohol. 193, 194 The lone exception to this classifi cation scheme is devices that pose a risk of transmitting prion-related diseases. Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) and variant CJD (vCJD) have gained considerable attention over the past decade and have only recently been addressed in published disinfection and sterilization guidelines. 195 Prions are not readily inactivated by conventional disinfection and sterilization procedures. 193 As a result, devices that pose a risk for transmission of prionrelated diseases should undergo special sterilization procedures after cleaning that involve sodium hydroxide followed by low-temperature autoclaving (121\u00b0 C) or hightemperature autoclaving (132\u00b0 C for 1 hour or 134\u00b0 C for 18 minutes). 194 Despite concerns that procedures involving semicritical items such as endoscopes and bronchoscopes may pose a risk for transmission of prion-related infections, there has not been a single report of CJD or vCJD associated with these devices. As a result, current guidelines recommend that only critical items and semicritical items that have come in contact with neurologic tissue (e.g., brain, spinal cord, eye tissue) should undergo special prion inactivation sterilization procedures. 194, 196 Numerous epidemics of gram-negative infection have been described in association with respiratory therapy equipment, 94, 95 diagnostic equipment such as bronchoscopes and endoscopes, 95, [99] [100] [101] and solutions used for cutaneous antisepsis. 197, 198 Most of these outbreaks were traced to improper procedures or malfunction of automated systems used for the disinfection and sterilization of medical devices, although a number of epidemics in years past arose as a result of extrinsic contamination of solutions used for cutaneous antisepsis. 197, 198 For these reasons, the importance of strict adherence to recommended policies and procedures for cleaning and reprocessing medical equipment used in the ICU cannot be overemphasized.",

Although most postendoscopy nosocomial infections are caused by inoculation of colonizing mucosal fl ora into normally sterile, vulnerable anatomic sites during the procedure, numerous epidemics have been traced to contaminated endoscopes. 95, [99] [100] [101] Following use for bronchoscopy, endoscopes are typically contaminated with 6 \u00d7 10 4 colony-forming units (CFUs/mL). 199 All endoscopes are considered semicritical medical devices by the Spaulding classifi cation and therefore require high-level disinfection following use. 196 In order to ensure their safe use, fl exible endoscopes should be reprocessed with the following procedures: (1) physical cleaning to reduce microbial bioburden and remove organic debris; (2) high-level disinfectionglutaraldehyde and automated chemical sterilizing systems that use peracetic acid are most commonly used in the United States-with adequate contact time between the disinfectant and device surface; (3) following disinfection, rinsing with sterile or fi ltered tap water to remove dis-infectant residue; (4) fl ushing of all channels with 70% to 90% ethyl or isopropyl alcohol; and (5) drying with forced air. 196 Devices used with endoscopes that violate mucosal barriers, such as biopsy forceps, need to be reprocessed as critical medical items with full sterilization. 196 Other devices used in the delivery of respiratory care are also considered semicritical under the Spaulding classification and therefore should be reprocessed in a manner similar to endoscopes prior to reuse. 131 Iodophors (e.g., 10% povidone-iodine), until recently, have been the most common agents used for cutaneous disinfection in North America. However, a large, prospec-tive, randomized trial of cutaneous antiseptics used for drawing blood cultures recently showed that chlorhexidine was superior to 10% povidone-iodine and was associated with a more than twofold reduced rate of contaminated blood cultures (OR = 0.40, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.75, P = .004). 200 Moreover, a recent meta-analysis examining the impact of different cutaneous antiseptic agents found that chlorhexidine was superior to povidone-iodine for both the prevention of intravascular catheter colonization and catheter-related bloodstream infection. 201 On the basis of these and other recent studies, 202, 203 chlorhexidine-containing solutions are the preferred cutaneous antiseptics for insertion of intravascular devices in the ICU. 129 Whatever agent is used, it is essential that it be applied with vigorous scrubbing for a minimum of 1 minute to allow adequate time for germicidal activity.",

            "text": "The major reservoir of nosocomial infection in the ICU is infected or colonized patients, and the major mode of spread of most nosocomial bacterial pathogens, many viruses, and even Candida from patient to patient is by transient carriage on the hands of medical personnel (see Fig. 51 -3). Studies in our center of hand carriage of nosocomial pathogens by ICU personnel, using a simple rinse technique to quantify the transient fl ora, 204 have shown that, on average, approximately 60,000 CFUs (or 4.6 logs) are recovered from the hands of ICU personnel randomly sampled (Table 51-6). Nearly half of persons cultured at any point in time will be found to be carrying gram-negative bacilli, and 10% will be carrying S. aureus. 205 Serial culturing has shown that all ICU personnel, at various times, carry gram-negative bacilli and that nearly two thirds carry S. aureus. Carriage of both gram-negative bacilli and S. aureus is typically transient: sampling persons every other day over a prolonged period has shown S. aureus or the same gram-negative species in consecutive cultures only 16% of the time; prolonged carriage of a single gram-negative species seems to be rare-but has been reported. 206 Hygienic handwashing before undertaking invasive procedures, handling open wounds, or having manual contact with high-risk patients (e.g., newborns or patients in ICUs) or after touching a source or object likely to be contaminated has been recognized since the time of Semmelweis and Lister as one of the most basic and important infection control measures. Despite universal acknowledgement of handwashing as a cornerstone of nosocomial infection control programs, compliance rates much above 50% have been diffi cult to achieve and handwashing rates among HCWs have ranged from 9% to 50% in numerous observational studies. 165, 207, 208 Recent investigations have undertaken to better understand the reasons for poor compliance in the face of the compelling evidence that hand hygiene is essential for prevention of nosocomial infection, 165 identifying cutaneous irritation, inconvenient sink location, time constraints, high workload, and understaffi ng. Of concern, risk factors for noncompliance with hand hygiene include being a physician (rather than a nurse); working in an ICU; and, paradoxically, engaging in patient-care activities with a high risk of cross-transmission. 165 Interventions to redress these defi ciencies have included targeted education; feedback; convenient location of sinks and hand hygiene agents; use of alternative, less irritative hand hygiene agents; hand care lotions or creams 209 ; and patient education. 210 Studies done with working hospital staff have shown that hygienic handwashing with an antiseptic-containing agent reduces the count of microorganisms on the hands of the user far more effectively than handwashing with a nonmedicated soap. 204 Repeated use of some antiseptics such as chlorhexidine has a cumulative suppressive effect on the transient hand fl ora. Routine use of an antisepticcontaining handwashing agent could, in theory, enhance the effectiveness of the handwashing that is done. Moreover, if an agent that exhibits prolonged antimicrobial activity, such as chlorhexidine, is used, it might also confer protection against contaminants acquired between handwashings. 204 However, antiseptic-containing handwashing agents are more expensive and often more irritating to the skin. Irritation can result in dermatitis and, paradoxically, increased colonization by gram-negative bacilli. 211 Clearly, antiseptic-containing soaps are more effective in removing microorganisms from the hands of users, but will routine use of these agents for hygienic handwashing reduce the incidence of nosocomial infection in patients? Discontinuation of hexachlorophene for handwashing by personnel and bathing of infants in the United States in 1973 was followed by a marked upsurge in S. aureus infections in nurseries, 212 and use of chlorhexidinecontaining handwashing agents was considered an essential measure for control of hospital outbreaks caused by multiply resistant Klebsiella 213 and MRSA. 214, 215 However, since Semmelweis' study, few studies have prospectively evaluated the effi cacy of antiseptic-containing handwashing agents for reducing endemic nosocomial infections, particularly infections caused by gram-negative bacilli. 211, 216 In 1982 a comparative sequential trial of three handwashing agents-a nonmedicated tissue soap, 10% povidone-iodine (Betadine Scrub), and 4% chlorhexidine (Hibiclens)-was undertaken in the trauma-surgical ICU of the University of Wisconsin Hospital. 211 Each agent was used exclusively for approximately 6 weeks, during which time hand cultures of ICU personnel were done at random and surveillance of infection in patients was carried out.",

Isolation is also indicated, usually for the entirety of hospitalization, for all patients infected or known to be colonized by antibioticresistant nosocomial pathogens such as MRSA, gram-nega- tive bacilli resistant to aminoglycosides or third-generation cephalosporins, or VRE; in such cases, isolation has been shown to be effective in reducing endemic infections 224, 225 (Figs. 51-5 and 51-6) and in controlling outbreaks. 225 Isolation Systems Most U.S. hospitals subscribe to one of two CDC isolation systems developed by panels of experts. The simplest system, category-specifi c isolation precautions, issued by the CDC in 1970, 223 groups diseases in seven categories by infections for which similar precautions are indicated: wound and skin precautions, enteric precautions, discharge precautions, blood precautions, respiration isolation, strict isolation, and protective isolation. Guidelines for disease-specifi c isolation precautions, issued in 1983, 226 consider each infectious disease individually, so only those precautions indicated to interrupt transmission of that specifi c disease are used. Disease-specifi c precautions minimize unnecessary isolation procedures; however, they are more complicated and may be implemented most effectively by a computerized system.",

These barriers should be used when potentially infectious secretions are likely to soil or splash the clothing, skin, or face of the HCW. 227 Body substance isolation provides suffi cient fl exibility to augment the basic precautions taken with each patient, as needed, and adds private rooms with masks for infections transmitted by the airborne route. A criticism of this simpler system has been the reduced emphasis on handwashing when gloves are removed. 228 The most recent CDC guideline, currently in draft form, 174 separates basic precautions into (1) standard precautions designed for the care of all patients in hospitals, regardless of their diagnosis or presumed infection status, and (2) additional transmission-based precautions designed for the care of specifi ed patients who are known or suspected to be infected with highly transmissible or epidemiologically important pathogens. Standard precautions synthesize the major features of universal blood and body fl uid precautions and are designed to reduce the risk of transmission of microorganisms from patient to patient and from patient to HCW, from both recognized and unrecognized sources of infection in the hospital. Transmission-based precautions are divided into three subgroups on the basis of the mode of transmission: contact precautions, droplet precautions, and airborne precautions. Contact precautions are recommended with multidrug-resistant bacteria that can be acquired by contact with the colonized patient or environmental surfaces or objects. Droplet precautions provide additional measures for transmission by large-particle droplets, such as during suctioning or bronchoscopy. Airborne precautions are added to standard precautions for care of patients with tuberculosis and other microorganisms transmitted by the airborne route. In general, transmission-based precautions usually specify a private room-always for airborne precautions.",

            "text": "An environmental issue pertaining to isolation may be most relevant in the ICU, namely, the greater potential for fomites or environmental surfaces to contribute to the spread of nosocomial infection, especially with antibioticresistant microorganisms. Although previous studies have not been able to demonstrate that the inanimate hospital environment, particularly surfaces, walls, or fl oors, contribute materially to the occurrence of nosocomial infection, 154, 155 accumulating evidence suggests that this may not necessarily be true for ICUs, where uniform exposure to invasive devices makes patients unduly susceptible. A number of careful studies of the epidemiology of ICUacquired infection with resistant organisms such as MRSA, 155, 156 C. diffi cile, 80, 157 and VRE 152, 158, 229 have shown heavy contamination of the inanimate environment immediately contiguous to the patient by strains implicated in nosocomial infections occurring in patients. Even if gloves are being worn as part of protective isolation or universal precautions, the possibility of transmission of microorganisms from the environment to patients on the gloved hands of HCWs is real. Prolonged wearing of gloves in the ICU, which is common, may increase the risk of nosocomial cross-infection, expanding the epidemiologic role of the inanimate environment with certain pathogens such as MRSA or VRE. 229 Similarly, the use of common stethoscopes, sphygmomanometers, or electronic thermometers with multiple patients provides further opportunity for organisms to spread. Although stethoscopes are commonly contami-nated by nosocomial organisms, 230 their role in crossinfection is less clear. 230 On the other hand, spread of VRE 231 and C. diffi cile 232 has been traced to contamination of electronic thermometers. All surfaces contiguous to the ICU patient should be wiped down with the general hospital disinfectant at least daily, and each ICU patient should have a dedicated stethoscope and sphygmomanometer. The use of electronic temperature measuring devices on multiple patients within an ICU bears reevaluation, unless stringent efforts are made to assure reliable decontamination of the device after each use.",

Because the vast majority of occupationally related HIV infections have involved needle sticks or other sharps injuries, every effort must be made to avert such injuries that could result in percutaneous inoculation of HIV or other bloodborne viruses. 236, 239 Because prophylactic use of barrier precautions appears to be of some benefi t for prevention of nosocomial infection 169, 240, 241 and all U.S. hospitals are currently mandated to follow standard precautions, it has been suggested that the use of gloves for all patient contacts, as is now common in many U.S. hospitals, should implicitly reduce the risk of nosocomial infection in general. However, this has not been demonstrated and there is concern that standard precautions might paradoxically increase the risk of nosocomial cross-infection. 242 In most U.S. hospitals it is still common to observe ICU personnel, many of whom routinely wear gloves for all patient contacts to protect themselves, put on gloves, touch heavily contaminated areas (e.g., an open wound or tracheostomy), and then, without removing the gloves, proceed to write in the patient's chart, answer the telephone, or care for another patient. This occurs because the health care providers have forgotten that although the gloves may protect themselves, the gloves must be immediately discarded after use to prevent cross-contamination of hazardous pathogens to other vulnerable sites on the same patient or transmission to other patients or the ICU environment. Before the era of AIDS and universal precautions, health care professionals were oriented toward protecting the patient and likely to wash their hands when exposed to potential contamination. Now the focus is centripetal, and many HCWs unfortunately view all precautions as measures to protect themselves. Thus prolonged wearing of gloves can result in heavy contamination of the gloves 243 and increase the risk of nosocomial cross-infection among patients. 229, 244 It also puts the HCW worker at increased risk of dermatitis and allergic reactions to glove material. 245 Standard precautions do not obviate the need for designated isolation precautions for patients with communicable infections. The greatly expanded use of gloves as part of standard precautions in hospitals must now be accompanied by educational programs on how to use gloves effectively and in a manner that will not jeopardize patients. Staff must be strongly encouraged to wash their hands after removing gloves, especially after performing a bloody procedure, because blood often penetrates defects in gloves and can be found on the hands of the wearer. 246 Moreover, if the gloved HCW has had hands-on contact with a patient colonized by MRSA or VRE, the process of removing the gloves will result in contamination of the hands of the HCW by these organisms up to one third of the time.",

Antimicrobial therapy has its greatest ecologic impact in the close confi nes of the ICU. Most nosocomial outbreaks caused by antibioticresistant microorganisms 249, 250 have occurred in patients hospitalized in an ICU. Antibiotic pressure, which promotes the exchange of genes encoding drug resistance by a variety of transfer mechanisms (Fig. 51-7) , 251 has been shown to be the single most important factor predisposing patients to nosocomial infection with resistant organisms. Modern-day ICUs are the breeding grounds for the multiply resistant bacteria that are now being encountered in hospitals throughout the world: methicillin-resistant staphylococci; VRE; Enterobacter, Serratia, Citrobacter, Proteus-Providencia, and P. aeruginosa resistant to fl uoroquinolones, aminoglycosides, or extended-spectrum beta-lactams. [55] [56] [57] [58] 247 Broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy is the root cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhea and colitis caused by C. diffi cile. 80 Clearly, antimicrobials are widely overused and misused; more than 75% of patients in U.S. ICUs, other than coronary care units, receive antimicrobial agents, whereas studies indicate that more than half of hospitalized patients receiving antimicrobial therapy have no evidence of infection or clear justifi cation to be receiving antibiotics. 252 Moreover, within ICUs, a high proportion of the antibiotics used are broad-spectrum-extended-spectrum penicillins, third-generation cephalosporins, carbapenems, aminoglycosides, or fl uoroquinolones. Greater efforts must be directed to improving the use of systemic antibiotics, especially within ICUs.",

However, several principles can reduce unnecessary antimicrobial therapy and improve the use of the drugs that are given: cultures, and other appropriate diagnostic tests, as indicated, should be done without fail before beginning antimicrobial therapy for treatment of presumed infection in an ICU patient. 3. Whenever antimicrobial therapy is begun, the reason should be documented in the patient's record (e.g., \"for treatment of pneumonia,\" \"for surgical prophylaxis\"). 4. When possible, a single drug and the most narrowspectrum drug or drugs should be used, especially if the infecting organism or organisms are known at the outset. 5. The need for continued antimicrobial therapy should be reassessed daily. If cultures identify the infecting microorganism or microorganisms, therapy should be modifi ed, aiming for the most narrow-spectrum drug or drugs likely to be effective. If diagnostic studies are negative after 48 to 72 hours and the patient is not exhibiting signs of sepsis, antibiotic therapy should be discontinued, unless the patient is profoundly granulocytopenic. 6. Beyond monitoring for effi cacy and adverse drug effects such as hypersensitivity or organ toxicity, it is essential that monitoring include surveillance for superinfection by resistant bacteria or Candida and for C. diffi cile diarrhea. 7. Surgical antimicrobial prophylaxis should not extend beyond 24 hours postoperatively 258, 259 and in most operations can be limited to a single dose. 258 ",

Finally, recovery of certain microorganisms in multiple blood cultures, such as staphylococci, Corynebacterium or Bacillus species, or Candida or Malassezia strongly suggests infection of an IVD.",

Contaminated fl uid is fortunately an infrequent cause of endemic infusionrelated infection with most short-term IVDs; it is, however, an important cause of BSIs with arterial catheters used for hemodynamic monitoring and long-term IVDs such as Hickman or Broviac catheters, cuffed hemodialysis CVCs, and subcutaneous central venous ports. 303, 306, 307 Most nosocomial epidemics of infusion-related BSI have been traced to contamination of infusate by gramnegative bacilli, introduced during its manufacture (intrin-sic contamination) or during its preparation and administration in the hospital (extrinsic contamination). 143, 308 If an epidemic is suspected, the epidemiologic approach must be methodical and thorough yet expeditious, directed toward establishing the bona fi de nature of the putative epidemic infections (i.e., ruling out \"pseudoinfections\") 242 and confi rming the existence of an epidemic; defi ning the reservoirs and modes of transmission of the epidemic pathogens; and, most importantly, controlling the epidemic, quickly and completely. Control measures are predicated on accurate delineation of the epidemiology of the epidemic pathogen. The essential steps in dealing with a suspected nosocomial outbreak have recently been reviewed (and are discussed later). 262 In recent years the factors associated with an increased risk of IVD-related BSI have become better delineated (Table 51- 11) . Prolonged hospitalization and severity of illness clearly infl uence the risk, and clinical states such as granulocytopenia, AIDS, and bone marrow transplanta- tion have been associated with fourfold to sixfold increased rates of IVD-related BSI. 309, 310 However, the features of the IVD, its insertion, and its maintenance appear to have far greater impact on the overall risk of infection. In 289 patients, Merrer and colleagues 311 found that insertion of an IVD in the femoral versus the subclavian vein was associated with a greatly increased risk of infection (20 versus 3.7 BSIs per 1000 IVD-days, P<.001) and thrombotic complications (21.5% versus 1.9%, P <.001). 311 Moreover, Robert and colleagues 312 found that patients with primary BSI were more likely to have received care during times when there was a lower nursing-to-patient ratio and a higher proportion of temporary (\"fl oat\") nurses rather than the fulltime nursing staff. 312",

Unfortunately, prospective studies evaluating the risk of femoral vein device placement have shown that CVCs placed in the femoral vein are more likely to be colonized at the time of removal than catheters placed in the internal jugular vein (RR = 4.7, CI = 2 to 8.8, P = .0001) 315 and are associated with an increased risk of IVD-related BSI when compared with CVCs placed in the subclavian vein (4.4% versus 1.5%, P = .07). 311 Furthermore, recent prospective studies have found higher rates of catheter-related deep vein thrombosis with femoral catheters, in the range of 7% to 25%. 310, 311 In general, we believe femoral access should be used only if emergent access is required, the inexperience of the operator limits placement in the upper body, or there is a contraindication to placement in the upper body (no available sites, an extensive burn, or severe coagulopathy). If a shortterm CVC must be placed in the femoral vein or artery, we believe it is important that the catheter insertion site be located at least 2 inches (5 cm) below the inguinal crease or an intertriginous area, which is heavily colonized with bowel organisms and yeasts; this also allows a more secure protective dressing to be affi xed.",

            "text": "Hand hygiene with an antisepticcontaining preparation, either conventional handwashing with chlorhexidine (2% to 4%) or with a waterless alcohol rub or gel, 171 must always precede the insertion of an IVD and should also precede subsequent handling of the device or its administration set. 129 A new pair of disposable, nonsterile gloves, using a \"notouch\" technique, is adequate for the placement of peripheral IV catheters in most patients; however, sterile gloves should be used during insertion in highrisk patients such as those with granulocytopenia. Sterile gloves are strongly recommended for placement of all other types of IVDs that are associated with a 1% or higher risk of associated bacteremia, specifi cally arterial catheters and all types of centrally placed devices including PICCs. 129 Studies have shown that the use of maximal barriers including a long-sleeved, sterile surgical gown, mask, cap and large sterile drape, and sterile gloves significantly reduces the risk of CVC-related BSI (0.08 BSIs with maximal barriers versus 0.5 BSIs per 1000 IVDdays without maximal barriers, P = .02). 320 The use of maximal barriers has further been shown to be highly cost effective. 320 Considering that of all IVDs, CVCs are most likely to produce nosocomial BSI, a strong case can be made for mandating maximal barrier precautions during the insertion of all central IVDs. 129 They are not necessary, however, for arterial catheters used for hemodynamic monitoring, during which sterile gloves and a sterile fenestrated drape will suffi ce. 321 3. IV teams: Good technique is also essential. Studies have shown that the use of special IV therapy teams, consisting of trained nurses or technicians who can assure a consistent and high level of aseptic technique during catheter insertion and in follow-up care of the catheter, have been associated with substantially lower rates of catheter-related BSI and are cost effective. 322, 323 But even if an institution does not have an IV team, it can greatly reduce its rate of IVD-related BSI by formal education of nurses and physicians and stringent adherence to IVD care protocols. 324,325 4. Cutaneous antisepsis: Given the evidence for the importance of cutaneous microorganisms in the pathogenesis of short-term IVD-related infections, measures to reduce colonization of the insertion site would seem of the highest priority, particularly the choice of chemical antiseptics for disinfection of the site. Nine randomized, prospective trials comparing a chlorhexidine-containing antiseptic to either povidone-iodine or alcohol for preparation of the skin prior to insertion of a short-term IVD have been reported. [201] [202] [203] 326 In the largest study to date, a randomized trial in 1050 CVCs and arterial catheters placed in a university hospital ICU, cutaneous antisepsis with 1% tincture of chlorhexidine showed a highly signifi cant reduction in IVDrelated BSIs compared with an iodophor (RR = 0.35, P < .01). 326 More recently, a meta-analysis that examined results from eight of the nine aforementioned studies found that use of chlorhexidine was associated with a nearly 50% reduction in the risk of IVD-related compared with povidone-iodine (RR = 0.49, 95% CI = 0.28 to 0.88). 201 Insertion Site Care and IVD Maintenance 1. IVD dressings: IVDs can be dressed with sterile gauze and tape or with a sterile transparent, semipermeable, polyurethane fi lm dressing. The available data suggest that the two types of dressings are equivalent in terms of their impact on IVD-related BSI with peripheral IVs and short-term CVCs. [327] [328] [329] In contrast, results from studies of arterial catheters have found that polyurethane dressings greatly increase the risk of IVD-related BSI. 327, 330 As a result, polyurethane dressings should probably not be used on arterial catheters until future studies confi rm their safety. 2. Topical antimicrobial ointments: In theory, application of a topical antimicrobial agent to the catheter insertion site should confer some protection against microbial invasion. Clinical trials of a topical combination antibacterial ointment containing polymyxin, neomycin, and bacitracin with peripheral IVs have shown marginal benefi t, 331 but the use of polyantibiotic ointments has been associated with a fi vefold increased frequency of Candida infection, limiting their utility. 331, 332 The topical antibacterial mupirocin, which is active primarily against gram-positive organisms, was shown in one study to signifi cantly reduce colonization of internal jugular catheters without increasing colonization by Candida spp., 333 and a more recent study by Sesso and colleagues 334 showed signifi cant reductions in hemodialysis catheter colonization (3.17 versus 14.27 per 1000 IVD-days, P = <.001) and S. aureus IVD-related BSIs (0.71 versus 8.92 BSIs per 1000 IVDdays, P = <.001). 334 Unfortunately, resistance of S. aureus 335 and coagulase-negative staphylococci 336 rapidly emerges during wide-scale mupirocin use, 337 which contravenes its use as a topical agent for the prevention of IVD-related BSI at this time. 129 Three prospective studies of topical povidone-iodine ointment applied to central venous catheter sites have failed to show a statistical benefi t to its use, 331,338,339 but a single comparative trial in subclavian hemodialysis catheters showed that the use of topical povidoneiodine ointment was associated with a fourfold reduction in the incidence of IVD-related S. aureus BSI. 340 Therefore if a topical agent is to be used with hemodialysis catheters, an iodophor may be most desirable. 3. Replacement of the device: Studies have shown that peripheral IVs may be safely left in place for up to 96 hours if the patient and the insertion site is monitored closely. 341 Studies have suggested that the duration of peripheral catheterization may be prolonged even further, 342 but, viewing reports of increasing nosocomial S. aureus bacteremias linked to prolonged peripheral venous catheterization, 343 more studies are required before this can become considered acceptable routinely. Scheduled replacement of short-term, noncuffed, nontunneled CVCs has long been practiced in many centers; however, some studies have called this practice into question. 344 Moreover, a meta-analysis found no benefi t to routine replacement of short-term CVCs. 345 On the basis of these data, there appears to be no indication for scheduled replacement of short-term CVCs that are functioning well and show no clinical signs of infection.",

In these cases the old catheter should be removed and cultured, and a new catheter should be inserted in a new site. 5. Replacing the delivery system: Whereas most infusionrelated BSIs are caused by infection of the device used for vascular access, infusate can occasionally become contaminated and cause endemic BSIs. 303, 348 If an infusion runs continuously for an extended period, the cumulative risk of contamination increases, and there is further risk that contaminants can grow to concentrations that could produce BSI in the recipient of the fl uid. For more than 25 years, most U.S. hospitals have routinely replaced the entire delivery system of patients' IV infusions at 24-or 48-hour intervals 349 to reduce the risk of BSI from extrinsically contaminated fl uid. Prospective studies indicate that IV delivery systems need not be replaced more frequently than every 72 to 96 hours, including infusions used for total parenteral nutrition or any infusions in ICU patients 341, 350 ; extending the duration of use can permit cost savings to hospitals. 350 Four clinical settings might be regarded as exceptions to using 72 hours as an interval for routine set change 350 : (1) administration of blood products, (2) administration of lipid emulsion, (3) arterial pressure monitoring, and (4) suspicion of an epidemic of infusion-related BSI. In these circumstances, it may be most prudent for administration sets to be changed routinely at 24-or 48-hour intervals.",

The use of prophylactic heparin for reducing rates of IVD-related thrombosis and infection has been evaluated in a meta-analysis. 357 Examining a variety of different administration techniques in 14 randomized controlled studies, Randolph and colleagues 357 concluded that systemic heparinization signifi cantly reduced the risk of IVD-associated thrombosis (RR = 0.43, CI = 0.23-0.78) and device colonization (RR = 0.18, CI = 0.06 to 0.6) but failed to show a reduction in IVD-related BSIs. Heparin-bonded pulmonary artery catheters may be less prone to IVD-related BSI than nonheparinized catheters. 303, 358, 359 On the basis of these studies, low-level anticoagulation with warfarin is warranted for long-term IVDs as long as there is no contraindication (bleeding diathesis, brain tumor, or predilection to falls) and the INR is maintained below 1.6. 355 For short-term IVDs, the use of low-dose subcutaneous heparin is more appropriate; it is commonly given to patients with CVCs or arterial lines as part of ICU thromboembolism prophylaxis.",

            "text": "Despite compliance with recommended guidelines, many centers continue to have high rates of IVD-related BSI. Novel technology holds much promise (Table 51-13) . Innovative technologies designed to reduce the risk of IVD-related BSI have proved to be not only effective but also to reduce health care costs, both with short-term and long-term IVDs. 301 In a randomized trial of the device, premature loss of pediatric PICCs caused by accidental extrusion and PICC-associated thrombosis was signifi cantly reduced, 361 and in two additional trials the incidence of catheter-related BSI was signifi cantly reduced with the use of the novel securement device, both in adults and children with PICCs. 361, 362 The promise of this device for reducing infection may derive from elimination of a festering skin suture wound contiguous to the newly inserted catheter and minimizing to-and-fro movement of the catheter, which may promote invasion of the tract by cutaneous microorganisms through capillary action. 363 2. Novel dressings: Studies of polyurethane dressings, which contain antiseptics such as povidone-iodine or ionized silver, have been disappointing. However, on the basis of demonstrated superiority of chlorhexidine for cutaneous disinfection of access sites, a novel chlorhexidine-impregnated sponge dressing has been developed (Biopatch, Johnson and Johnson Medical, Inc.). It maintains a high concentration of the antiseptic on the insertion site under the dressing. The largest study to date found that use of the chlorhexidineimpregnated sponge dressing was associated with a 60% reduction in catheter-related BSI (RR = 0.37, P = .01). 364 Although there were no adverse side effects associated with the use of this dressing in this trial in adults, a pediatric trial found that 15% of low-birth-weight neonates developed local dermatotoxicity. 365 3. Anti-infective impregnated catheters: Intravascular devices directly coated or impregnated with antimicrobials or antiseptics have been intensively studied over the past decade. Eighteen randomized trials evaluating the effi cacy of chlorhexidine-silver-sulfadiazine-or minocycline-rifampin-impregnated CVCs have been published in full article or abstract form since 1994. 268, 269, 291, 366, 367 Of the 16 published studies that examined the effect of antimicrobial-impregnated CVCs on rates of CVCrelated BSI, 12 found either a statistically signifi cant reduction or a strong trend toward a reduction in rates of CVC-related BSI. 366, 367 Aggregate analysis of the 15 studies that compared antimicrobial-impregnated CVCs with nonimpregnated CVCs, 366,367 encompassing a total of 4250 CVCs, shows that antimicrobialimpregnated CVCs are associated with a 40% reduction in CVC-related BSI (61 BSIs/2129 devices versus 101 BSIs/2118 devices, OR 0.60, 95% CI = 0.44 to 0.82, P = .001), a result remarkably similar to the fi ndings of three published meta-analyses. 301, 368, 369 Finally, two rigorous and sophisticated economic analyses have found that antimicrobial-impregnated CVCs are cost effective. 370, 371 Veenstra and colleagues showed that antimicrobial-impregnated CVCs remained cost effective even if the cost of a CVC-related BSI was as low as $687 per case; cost savings were $196 per antimicrobial-impregnated CVC when a more realistic cost of a CVC-related BSI of $9738 was used in the analysis. 370 Shorr and colleagues 371 showed that use of antimicrobial-impregnated CVCs was associated with a cost savings of $9600 per CVC-related BSI prevented and that $165 to $280 would be saved for every patient who received an antimicrobialimpregnated CVC.",

However, the use of prophylactic antibiotic lock solution is considered acceptable in the 2001 HICPAC Guideline if a patient with an essential long-term IVD has continued to experience recurrent IVD-related BSIs despite consistent application of infection control practices. 129 Various other prophylactic lock solutions have been studied as a means of preventing IVD-related BSI including trisodium citrate/gentamicin, 375 minocycline/ ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), 376 ethanol, 377 and taurolidine-containing solutions. 378 Concerns about increased IVD complication rates 378 and drugrelated toxicity 375 associated with the use of certain types of lock solutions, combined with the limited number of patients who have been studied while receiving these agents, precludes their routine use at this time. 5.

This study has been criticized for its exclusion of subjects at high risk for infection with antimicrobial-resistant pathogens. 422 In the absence of defi nitive data demonstrating the superiority of either approach, the recent American Thoracic Society-Society of Critical Care Medicine-Infectious Disease Society of America joint guideline acknowledges that both diagnostic approaches are useful and acceptable when evaluating patients with suspected VAP. This puts great weight on an initial Gram stain of a deep tracheal aspirate, however, if no microorganisms are seen, it can be concluded that it is unlikely the patient has bacterial VAP. 383",

That an altered level of cognition is associated with an increased risk of aspiration is supported by surveillance data showing increased rates of VAP in trauma and neurosurgical ICUs. 133 and colleagues 430 found that the use of a nasogastric tube was an independent predictor of VAP in a multivariate analysis (OR 6.5, 95% CI 2.1 to 19.8). Finally, as noted, endotracheal tubes allow pooling of hypopharyngeal secretions that can leak around the cuff directly into the trachea, and a supine position appears to increase the risk of aspiration around the cuff. 431 Host factors also contribute to an increased risk of developing VAP (see Table 51 -15). Conditions such as advanced age, increased severity of illness, and the postsurgical state are rarely modifi able. However, poor nutritional status, 397 oversedation, 432 transfusion therapy, 433 and exposure to broad-spectrum antimicrobials 424 are associated with an increased risk of VAP and are under the control of the clinician.",

However, randomized trials, admittedly of limited power, have not found signifi cant benefi t with this approach 442 and early tracheostomy is not currently recommended by most authorities. 131, 434 As noted earlier, supine positioning of the mechanically ventilated patient's head has been shown to increase the risk of gastro-esophageal-pharyngeal aspiration. 431 A simple solution to this threat is to elevate the head of the patient's bed 35 to 45 degrees. Drakulovic and colleagues 443 found that patients whose torso and head were kept elevated at 45 degrees had much lower rates of microbiologically confi rmed pneumonia compared with patients cared for in a 0-degree supine position (5% versus 23%, P = .018). 443 In reality, maintaining elevation of the head in excess of 45 degrees on a consistent basis is actually quite diffi cult and uncommonly achieved in practice. A recent randomized study that sought to maintain head elevation above 45 degrees for 85% of the study period found that head elevation in the intervention arm only averaged 28.1 degrees. 444 Perhaps as a result of failure to successfully achieve adequate elevation, no reductions in the rate of VAP were seen.",

            "text": "Although data on the effect that comprehensive oral care has on risk of infection are limited, 445 maintaining adequate dental hygiene is considered an important component of VAP prevention. 131 Binkley and colleagues 446 found that although a majority of nurses caring for patients undergoing mechanical ventilation appreciated the importance of dental hygiene, the methods used to provide this varied considerably. Until more data are available on specifi c dental hygienic practices, it is recommended that mechanically ventilated patients have their teeth brushed daily, undergo oral cleansing every 2 to 4 hours, undergo routine suctioning to reduce accumulation of fl uids in the oropharynx, and have a mouth moisturizer applied to their lips to prevent cracking. 447 The periodic instillation of a topical oral antiseptic solution is an additional promising intervention 447 and is discussed under pharmacologic preventive measures later. The use of a modifi ed endotracheal tube that has a separate ventral drainage tube for continuous or intermittent suctioning of subglottic secretions has been evaluated in a number of studies. 448, 449 Subglottic suctioning reduced the rate of VAP signifi cantly in all but one of these studies. 449 However, in this latter study, the time to onset of VAP was delayed signifi cantly (5.9 days versus 2.9 days, P = .006), 449 and recent evidence-based guidelines have recommended the use of endotracheal tubes that allow for suctioning of subglottic secretions. 131, 434 Nevertheless, the use of an endotracheal tube that allows for subglottic suctioning did not reduce the duration of mechanical ventilation or ICU mortality in the studies done, which, coupled with the increased cost of the tube and propensity of the suction lumen to occlude, has limited wider adoption of this technology in practice. 450 The evidence that heat and moisture exchangers (HMEs) are associated with a reduced risk of VAP is mixed. Only one of six published trials found a statistically signifi cant reduction in VAP with use of HMEs (RR 0.41, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.86, P = .02). 451 However, pooling data from a recent systematic review 452 and a subsequently published randomized trial 453 shows that HMEs reduce the risk of VAP by 38% (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.89, P = .012). The use of HMEs has been recommended by authors of a systematic review 454 and is currently recommended by the Canadian Critical Care Trials Group. 434 However, HICPAC made no recommendation for the use of HMEs because fi ve of six published trials failed to demonstrate a statistically signifi cant reduction in the rate of VAP. 131 Heat exchange moisturizers become readily occluded in patients with airway hemorrhage and can increase airway resistance. As a result, they should not be used in patients with hemoptysis or those requiring a high-minute ventilation. 434 Finally, the membranes of HMEs can become colonized with bacteria and should be replaced weekly, according to current guidelines. 434 The availability of in-line multiuse suction catheters abrogates the need to open and manipulate the endotracheal circuit, theoretically reducing the risk of exogenous contamination. 455 Despite their theoretical benefi t, prospective studies have not consistently showed that in-line suction catheters are associated with a reduced risk of VAP. [456] [457] [458] Although in-line suction catheters do not appear to increase the risk of VAP, they are more time effi cient for nursing personnel and respiratory therapists, and are more cost effective than open suction catheters. 434 Kollef and colleagues 459 found that rates of VAP were identical in patients randomized to as-needed changes of their inline suction catheter versus those who had their catheter changed every 24 hours (14.7% versus 14.8%). As a result, there is no compelling evidence that in-line suction catheters should be periodically changed, unless clinically indicated.",

            "text": "Antacids and H 2 -blockers have been used extensively in the ICU setting to prevent stress ulcer bleeding but have been associated with an increased risk of developing of VAP because they lead to bacterial overgrowth of the gastric contents. 53 Sucralfate prevents stress ulcer bleeding without reducing gastric pH but is more diffi cult to administer and is less effective than acid-reducing agents. 429 The results of clinical trials examining these two competing strategies for preventing gastrointestinal hemorrhage in the ICU have been mixed, with earlier trials favoring the use of sucralfate. 53 However, more recently published trials suggest only a small incremental increased risk of VAP with H 2 -blockers 429, 460, 461 and most experts feel that this risk is more than offset by their superior capacity to prevent stress ulcer bleeding. 131, 434 Selective digestive decontamination (SDD) is one of the most extensively studied preventive interventions in critical care medicine, yet the role for SDD continues to generate vigorous debate as to its overall benefi t. 462, 463 A more detailed discussion on the risks and benefi ts of this intervention is provided later in this chapter. Most U.S. experts believe that SDD has the potential to increase infection caused by multiresistant bacteria, particularly in settings with high rates of endemic antimicrobial resistance. 464, 465 Until well-designed multicenter trials are done, proving that SDD does not adversely effect the ICU ecology, it is likely that North American guidelines will continue to discourage its use. 131, 434 The isolated use of parenteral antimicrobials for prevention of VAP has not met with much success, 464 but selective antimicrobial decontamination of the oropharynx, without the use of enteral or systemic agents, reduced the risk of VAP nearly 70% (RR = 0.33, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.67, P = .001) in a recent trial. 405 This study reemphasized the primary role of oropharyngeal colonization in the pathogenesis of VAP but engenders the same concerns as SDD over its potential for promoting antimicrobial resistance. However, it has facilitated the idea that topical decolonization of the oropharynx with nonantimicrobial agents might be able to materially reduce the risk of VAP without the potential for emergence of antimicrobial resistance. A recent meta-analysis of seven randomized trials that enrolled 914 mechanically ventilated patients found that topical chlorhexidine applied to the oropharynx reduced the risk of VAP by nearly 30% (RR = 0.74, 95% CI 0.56 to 0.96, P = .02), although there was no signifi cant impact on mortality. 407 The benefi cial effects of chlorhexidine appear to be most pronounced in post-cardiac surgery patients, 466, 467 prompting HICPAC to recommend its use in this subpopulation. 131",

Extraluminal contamination may occur early, by direct inoculation when the catheter is inserted, or later, by organisms ascending from the perineum by capillary action in the thin mucous fi lm between the external catheter surface and the urethral wall.

These data suggest that microbial adherence to the catheter surface is important in the pathogenesis of many, but not all, CAUTIs.

By the 1990s, the availability of antibiotics from a variety of distinct classes-aminoglycosides, broad-spectrum penicillins (e.g., piperacillin), monobactams (e.g., aztreonam), carbapenems (e.g., imipenem), \u03b2-lactam-beta-lactamase inhibitors (e.g., piperacillin-tazobactam), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and fl uoroquinolonespromised a respite from concerns about resistance in aerobic gram-negative bacilli. During this period, however, gram-positive cocci gained prominence, and MRSA \u03b2-lactam-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci and VRE became the major problem nosocomial pathogens. Antibiotic pressure, deriving fi rst from the widespread use of third-generation cephalosporin antibiotics in hospitals, is often cited as a major factor in the emergence of MRSA. Co-emerging as nosocomial pathogens with MRSA have been methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci, which have become the leading cause of IVD-related BSI and prosthesis-related surgical site infections.",

For example, use of trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole has been associated statistically with emergence of ceftazidime-resistant E. coli and K. pneumoniae as a result of linkage on a single plasmid of genes that encode production of ESBLs and trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole resistance. A large proportion of extended-spectrum \u03b2-lactamase producing gramnegative bacilli are also resistant to fl uoroquinolones. 482, 483 In epidemiologic and clinical studies of antibiotic resistance, there is always a proportion of patients in whom resistance is found without exposure to the problem antibiotic. These patients usually have other important risk factors, such as increased severity of underlying disease, extremes of age, presence of invasive devices, recent surgery, or proximity to patients who are infected or colonized with antibiotic-resistant bacteria. In these cases the presence of antibiotic-resistant strains is most often the consequence of patient-to-patient spread, usually on the contaminated hands of HCWs; occasionally, spread results from a contaminated common source, such as an inadequately cleaned piece of equipment. Studies of HCW hand hygiene show that rates of handwashing between patient contacts range from 25% to 50%, at best, and are inadequate to control resistance, especially in ICUs, where the staff are extremely busy and less likely to be attentive to hand hygiene. 165 ",

Aggressive hand hygiene campaigns, with adherence monitoring and feedback of ward and even individual results, may achieve compliance rates as high as 70%. For some situations (e.g., when there is a large resistance iceberg and extensive patient colonization by antibiotic resistant bacteria), these levels of adherence may not be suffi cient to control cross-infection. Response to this problem has been to encourage \"universal gloving,\" in addition to wider use of alcohol-based hand rubs (a \"belt-and-suspender\" approach) to bridge the gap left by incomplete attention to hand hygiene even in the best of circumstances. Use of universal gloving has been successful in controlling spread of aminoglycoside-resistant gram-negative bacilli in ICUs and C. diffi cile-related diar-rhea. 224, 241 Because patients' intact skin and the environment in patient rooms may be a source of resistant bacteria, such as VRE, we recommend that disposable examination gloves be worn for all contact with ICU patients or their environment. Because gloves are not a total barrier, they must be removed and hands disinfected by an alcohol hand rub between patient contacts.",

Because antimicrobial use drives antimicrobial resistance, the frequency of inappropriate antimicrobial use can be used as a surrogate marker for antimicrobial resistance. Both antimicrobial stewardship and a comprehensive infection control program are essential to limiting the emergence and transmission of antimicrobial-resistant pathogens.

The two core strategies that provide the foundation for a successful antimicrobial stewardship program are (1) prospective audits, with intervention and feedback; and (2) formulary restriction and preauthorization. 253 Several studies have shown that prospective audits of antimicrobial use with intervention and feedback are an effective means of reducing inappropriate antimicrobial use. 484, 485 In a randomized trial conducted at a 600-bed tertiary teaching hospital, inpatients receiving parenteral antimicrobial therapy were randomized to an intervention group that received suggestions for optimal antimicrobial use from an infectious diseases physician or to no interventions. Physicians in the intervention group implemented 85% of the suggestions they received, which resulted in 1.6 fewer days of parenteral therapy and $400 savings per patient. Similar results have been noted in trials undertaken in community hospitals. 484 If daily review of antimicrobial use is not feasible, review of antimicrobial usage 3 days a week may still have a signifi cant impact. Effective audit with intervention and feedback can be undertaken most easily with automated computer surveillance of antimicrobial use, allowing the targeting of specifi c units where the problems are greatest.",

Antimicrobial restriction is unequivocally the most effective method of controlling antimicrobial use. 486, 487 However, it is unclear whether antimicrobial restriction achieves the more important outcome, reducing antimicrobial resistance. Several studies of outbreaks of C. diffi cile-associated diarrhea have shown abrupt cessation of the outbreak following restriction (and greatly reduced use) of one or more key antimicrobials such as clindamy-cin or third-generation cephalosporins. 486 However, other studies have documented inexorably rising resistance rates in nosocomial pathogens despite a rigorous program of antimicrobial restriction. 488 One explanation for this increase in resistance may be the compensatory increase in usage of broad-spectrum antimicrobials other than the restricted agent, thus counteracting any benefi t of restriction. Furthermore, restricting use of a single drug to reduce antimicrobial resistance may be ineffective because cross-resistance in bacterial species to more than one class of antimicrobials is the rule in nosocomial organisms.",

Guidelines tailored to local antimicrobial resistance patterns and antimicrobial use trends may have more impact than a generic clinical pathway. Interest has been sparked in ICUs by the reborn concept of antibiotic cycling. 490, 491 The most recent experiences have evaluated switch therapy 492 for empiric antibiotic use, rather than actual cycling, and have shown benefi cial reductions in resistance among gram-negative bacilli 493 and in the prevalence of VRE. Such approaches, as well as true cycling through different antimicrobial classes, may be effective over limited periods in closed environments such as ICUs, by transiently reducing selection pressure and thus resistance to the restricted agent. Yet studies have thus far not shown a consistent long-term benefi t with cycling, and mathematical models do not predict that cycling will be an effective measure to reduce antimicrobial resistance. 494 Antimicrobial order forms reduce antimicrobial usage through the use of automatic stop orders and the requirement for physician justifi cation. 495 Streamlining or deescalation of therapy based on culture data is an essential component of appropriate antimicrobial use, with studies showing substantial reductions in days of antimicrobial use and cost savings. 496, 497 Computer order entry provides needed information at the moment in a neutral, nonjudgmental, fact-based format; this system is effi cient, well accepted, and holds the promise to change prescribing behaviors materially. 498, 499 Effective antimicrobial stewardship programs can be fi nancially self-supporting and improve patient care. Studies have shown reductions in antimicrobial usage from 22% to 36%, with annual savings of $200,000 to $900,000 in larger teaching hospitals and community hospitals.

            "text": "SDD consists of four components: (1) a broad-spectrum parenteral antibiotic given for approximately 3 days to treat infections incubating at the time of the admission to the ICU; (2) topical antimicrobials (usually polymyxin E, tobramycin, and amphotericin B) periodically applied to the oropharynx and instilled into the gut for a variable period, usually for the entire duration of ICU stay, to reduce the mucosal burden of gram-negative bacteria and yeasts while preserving the anaerobic fl ora; (3) a reemphasized adherence to hand hygiene to prevent nosocomial transmission of bacteria, in some European centers, empiric barrier isolation; and (4) serial surveillance cultures of the oropharynx and rectum to monitor the efficacy of the treatment. 500, 501 Eleven meta-analyses assessing the effi cacy of SDD for reducing infection and mortality have been published (Table 51-19) . [502] [503] [504] [505] [506] [507] [508] [509] [510] [511] [512] All have found a reduction in pneumonia. Some, but not all, have found reduced mortality. However, a recent review showed that the results of the meta-analyses were inversely related to study design, 513 which in the case of SDD may overestimate its effi cacy. Most studies and meta-analyses of SDD did not make a distinction between parenteral and topical SDD; the few meta-analyses that undertook subgroup analyses found that topical antibiotics alone reduced infection but not mortality. 507 The greatest deterrent to widespread acceptance of SDD is the fear that it will promote the emergence and spread of antimicrobial resistant microorganisms. Antibiotic pressure is without question the single most powerful force driving the selection of resistant microorganisms and any strategy for prevention of infection in the ICU that has the potential to increase infections caused by multiresistant organisms must be approached very cautiously. A number of studies underlie the concern of promoting antimicrobial resistance with SDD. Numerous studies have documented major shifts in the microbial ecology of the ICU with the use of SDD. [514] [515] [516] In a study by Lingnau and colleagues, 514 4.5 years of SDD with ciprofl oxacin led to a marked increase in MRSA infection from 17% to 81% and of ciprofl oxacin-resistant S. aureus from 33% to 80%. The number of infections caused by other multiresistant bacteria such as Acinetobacter was also increased by SDD. 514 A distinction must also be made between the risk to an individual receiving SDD of infection caused by a resistant pathogen and the institutional risk of an increased prevalence of antimicrobial-resistant organisms related to the use of SDD. Although both consequences are undesirable, given the skyrocketing rates of endemic nosocomial MRSA and VRE infections worldwide, any-however small-potential for increased antimicrobial resistance must be taken seriously. In order to better address this issue, well-designed, cluster-randomized trials that employ multilevel modeling and specifi cally address the effects of SDD on antimicrobial resistance across the entire spectrum of microbial pathogens at the institutional level are necessary. Until such data are available, we believe that continued North American concerns about the effects of SDD on antimicrobial resistance are justifi ed, particularly in institutions where MRSA and VRE are endemic, which encompasses virtually all larger hospitals. Given that other effective measures for prevention of nosocomial infection exist, we believe that SDD should be restricted to select patients, such as certain trauma patients, or as a potential adjunctive control measure for a nosocomial outbreak caused by multiply resistant organisms. 517 Recent randomized trials have identifi ed several novel measures for prevention of VAP such as semi-recumbent positioning 443 and subglottic suction endotracheal tubes. 518 We believe that these approaches are ecologically more attractive control measures for ventilated ICU patients than prophylactic topical and systemic antibiotics.",

Nosocomial colonization occurred later among isolated patients (median 12 versus 7 days) and was associated with subsequent infection in 2 patients, as compared with 12 patients given standard care. Among children who were isolated, the interval before the fi rst infection was significantly longer (median, 20 versus 8 days), the daily infection rate was twofold lower (86 versus 44 infections per 1000 ICU days), and there were 50% fewer days with fever. The benefi t of isolation was most notable after 7 days of ICU care. Isolation was well tolerated by patients and their families.

Simple forms of protective isolation as a general control measure would also seem preferable to attempts to suppress nosocomial colonization with SDD. Further studies are necessary to determine the cost effectiveness of prophylactic barrier precautions in the ICU and especially the effi cacy of protective isolation in adult surgical ICUs, where the incidence of nosocomial infection is as high as 35%. Studies should also determine the relative importance of wearing a gown, as compared with wearing gloves alone. Patients with prolonged severe granulocytopenia or those who are receiving high dosages of corticosteroids, usually as part of immunosuppressive regimens to prevent transplant rejection, are at risk for invasive pulmonary infection caused by Aspergillus species, Zygomycetes, and other fi lamentous airborne fungi, which is associated with high mortality. [36] [37] [38] 536 The risk of invasive infection appears to be directly related to the counts of airborne fungi, and numerous outbreaks have been linked to building construction or failure of air-control systems. Studies have shown that the isolation of vulnerable patients in positivepressure rooms with spore-free HEPA-fi ltered air greatly reduces the risk of invasive infection. 36, 38 HEPA-fi ltered ICU rooms should be available for the care of patients who have received bone marrow or solid organ transplants and who require intensive care, especially in the early posttransplant period or during the treatment of rejection, when dosages of immunosuppressive drugs are high.",

A strong institutional commitment to the continuous evaluation and selective adoption of technology-based approaches to prevention of sharps injuries will have the greatest impact. 7. With accidental sharps injuries, unless the injury occurred with a clean sharp not used on a patient, the injury should be immediately reported to the employee health service, where work-related injuries in general can be evaluated and managed most consistently and inexpensively and surveillance of all work-related injuries can be assisted.

Much has been learned over the past 3 decades about the relative risks and especially the pathogenesis and epidemiology of these infections, information that has provided the scientifi c underpinnings for preventive strategies that have proved effective. However, there is an urgent need for better research to prevent nosocomial infection in ICU patients (Box 51-5), 593 particularly with respect to strategies to prevent colonization by multiresistant microorganisms, and to prevent infection even if colonization has already occurred. 28 Most of our understanding of the epidemiology of nosocomial infection, especially in ICUs, is based on studies of epidemics. Well-designed studies are necessary to better defi ne the epidemiology of endemic nosocomial infections, especially those caused by resistant staphylococci, enterococci and gram-negative bacilli, and yeasts. The importance of hand carriage of pathogens by hospital personnel, the role of airborne transmission in the ICU, and the relevance of contamination of the inanimate hospital environment by resistant pathogens all need to be better delineated, as well as the factors infl uencing nosocomial colonization and superinfection by resistant bacteria and yeasts.",

Exactly how should hands be washed for maximal benefi t and with what agents? The question can be posed: Could very frequent handwashing, which approaches 40 times per 8-hour shift in neonatal ICUs, increase the potential for transmission of microorganisms, such as methicillinresistant coagulase-negative staphylococci? Should the frequency of handwashing, as well as the agents used, be critically reexamined? Beyond a certain frequency, more may not necessarily be better. Should handwashing machines, which substantially augment degerming, 594,595 be adopted widely?
