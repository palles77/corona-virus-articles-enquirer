First, the STED far-red channel (Abberior StarRED) was recorded with 633 nm excitation using the pulsed white light laser with 80MHz repetition rate and STED depletion was performed with a synchronized pulsed 775 nm depletion laser. The detection bandpass was set to 650 to 750 nm. The following setting were applied: 16 x line averaging and 2 x frame accumulation as well as detector gating on a HybridDetector (HyD, Leica Microsystems) of 0.3 ns to 6 ns. The second STED channel (Abberior STAR580) was detected with 561 nm excitation and 775 nm depletion using a detection window from 565 to 628 nm. All other settings remained constant. The resolution of the two channels was approximately matched by using different STED depletion laser intensities for the two dyes. Deconvolution of confocal and STED images was carried out using the Huygens Professional Deconvolution software (Scientific Volume Imaging).

After 24 h cells were fixed by adding one volume of 2x fixative buffer containing 1% glutaraldehyde, 8% formaldehyde, 0.1% malachite green in 0.2 M PHEM buffer (120 mM PIPES, 100 mM HEPES, 4 mM MgCl 2 , 20 mM EGTA pH 6.9) directly to the culture media. After 5 min at room temperature, fixative was aspirated and a second fixation was performed for 20 min on ice with 1x fixative buffer. Cells were rinsed twice with 150 mM glycine in 0.1 M PHEM and washed twice for 5 min with the same buffer. Finally, cells were rinsed ten times with 0.1 M PHEM buffer before being subjected to light microscopy. Imaging was perfomed with an Ultraview ERS spinning disc (PerkinElmer) on a Nikon TE2000-E inverted confocal microscope. Images were collected in the YFP channel and in the transmitted light channel using differential interference contrast and several fields of view were acquired with a 40x objective and tiled together. The coordinates of the cells of interest were recorded. After imaging, cells were fixed again on ice for 20 min with 0.05% malachite green, 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M PHEM buffer, washed 4 times for 5 min with 0.1 M PHEM, postfixed on ice for 1 h with 0.8% K 3 Fe(CN) 6 , 1% OsO 4 in 0.1 M PHEM and washed again 4 times for 5 min with 0.1 M PHEM. Samples were treated with 1% tannic acid in water for 20 min on ice, washed twice for 5 min with water, incubated with 0.5% uranyl acetate in water for 1 h at room temperature, washed 5 times for 5 minutes and progressively dehydrated with increasing concentration of ethanol (25% to 100%) on ice before being resin embedded with a mixture of Epon 812/Araldite 502 (Electron Microscopy Sciences). Samples were polymerized for 96 h at 60 \u00b0C. After polymerization, the negative imprint of the coordinate system from the photo-etched gridded coverslip allowed to identify the cells of interest. Samples were mounted and sputter coated as previously described (Chatel-Chaix et al., 2016) and imaged using a Zeiss Crossbeam 540 Focused Ion Beam Scanning Electron Microscope (FIB-SEM; Carl Zeiss). The coordinate system Atlas 3D software package (FIBICS Incorporated) was used for all sample preparation and acquisition parameters. The FIB was used to make a platinum deposition along with the gas injection system using 1.5 nA beam current. Milling procedures used various currents including 15 nA for the trench, 3 nA for the polish and 1.5 nA for the fine milling and imaging. The SEM images were taken at 1.5 kV with 700 pA, ESB grid voltage 1100 V with a pixel size of 5x5nm and z step of 8 nm. All acquired images were analyzed using the ImageJ software package Fiji (http://fiji.sc/wiki/index.php/Fiji) (Schindelin et al., 2012) , aligned with the TrakEM2 plugin and inverted. Three dimensional reconstruction was performed using the software IMOD (Kremer et al., 1996) (bio3d.colorado.edu/imod).",
