HFF cells were infected with T. gondii RH strain for 18 h or uninfected (controls), and then fixed with paraformaldehyde. An indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) was performed. The results of IFA demonstrate that host cell vimentin was rearranged and accumulated around the T. gondii parasitophorous vacuoles (arrowheads). This phenomenon was not observed in uninfected cells. Figure S2. Host cell vimentin had no obvious effect on the proliferation of T. gondii.A. qRT-PCR was performed to verify the knockdown of vimentin in HFF cells treated with siRNA (t test, ***p\u22640.001). B. Knockdown of vimentin was also demonstrated by Western Blot. C. Number of tachyzoites per parasitophorous vacuole (PV) in untreated, ctrl siRNA-treated, and vimentin siRNA treated cells.",
