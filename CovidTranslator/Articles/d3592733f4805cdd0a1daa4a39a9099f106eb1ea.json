Earlier we showed that the ectodomain of the S protein is not involved in this process. Here we further defined the requirements of the S protein for virion incorporation. We show that the cytoplasmic domain, not the transmembrane domain, determines the association with the M protein and suffices to effect the incorporation into viral particles of chimeric spikes as well as of foreign viral glycoproteins. The essential sequence was mapped to the membrane-proximal region of the cytoplasmic domain, which is also known to be of critical importance for the fusion function of the S protein. Consistently, only short C-terminal truncations of the S protein were tolerated when introduced into the virus by targeted recombination. The important role of the about 38-residues cytoplasmic domain in the assembly of and membrane fusion by this approximately 1300 amino acids long protein is discussed. D",

The nucleocapsid protein packages the viral RNA genome into a helical nucleocapsid, which is in turn surrounded by a lipid envelope.

Some coronaviruses contain an additional membrane protein, the hemagglutinin-esterase (HE) protein. Coronaviruses acquire their lipid envelope by budding of the nucleocapsid into the membranes of the intermediate compartment (Corse and Machamer, 2000; Klumperman et al., 1994; Krijnse-Locker et al., 1994; Tooze et al., 1984 Tooze et al., , 1988 .",

            "text": "The mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) spike glycoprotein is responsible for binding of the virus to the host cell receptor and for virus-cell as well as cell-cell fusion (reviewed by Cavanagh, 1995) . It is a 1324 amino acids (aa) type I membrane glycoprotein (Mw 180 kDa) consisting of a large ectodomain (1263 aa), a transmembrane domain (TM;~23 aa), and a short cytoplasmic domain (CD;~38 aa). It is cotranslationally glycosylated in the ER and oligomerizes into trimers (Delmas and Laude, 1990) . A fraction of the spikes is transported to the cell surface where it induces cell-cell fusion. Upon passage through the Golgi compartment, the spike protein is post-translationally cleaved (Luytjes et al., 1987; Sturman et al., 1985) into a soluble -receptor binding -S1 subunit (Suzuki and Taguchi, 1996) and a membrane anchored -membrane fusion -S2 subunit (Yoo et al., 1991) of about equal size (90 kDa). As demonstrated by coimmunoprecipitation assays, the majority of the spike protein in infected cells is retained in the ER where it associates with the M protein via heterotypic affinity interactions . These interactions are virus specific, M and S proteins from different (e.g., feline and murine) coronaviruses do not associate. The spike ectodomain is not responsible for the interaction with the M protein; when the MHV S ectodomain was replaced by that of feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) the chimeric S protein associated with the MHV but not with the FIPV M protein and was incorporated into MHV-based, not FIPV-based VLPs; the reciprocal chimeric protein behaved inversely (Godeke et al., 2000a) . These chimeric spike proteins were functionally incorporated into recombinant MHV and FIPV, respectively, providing the resulting viruses fMHV and mFIPV with opposite targeting specificities (Haijema et al., 2003; Kuo et al., 2000) . The observations imply that sequences in the TM and/or the CD of the spike protein mediate interaction with the M protein and envelope incorporation.",

In the three-letter designation of the constructs the first letter refers to the viral origin of the ectodomain, the second and third letters indicate the origin of TM and CD, respectively. In the chimeric MFF and MFM gene, the transition from the MHV S ectodomain to the FIPV S TM was at the highly conserved KWPW(W/Y) VWL amino acid sequence motif (Fig. 1A) . The junction between the TM and the CD in the MFM and MMF chimeras was at the conserved TGC motif occurring in the cysteine-rich region (Fig. 1) . The proper folding, transport to the plasma membrane, and membrane fusion capacity of the chimeric proteins MFF, MFM, and MMF were confirmed by looking at their acquisition of endoglycosidase H (endoH) resistance, their cell surface expression, and their cell-cell fusion induction, respectively (data not shown). To evaluate the ability of the recombinant S proteins to interact intracellularly with the M protein we employed a previously developed co-immunoprecipitation assay . In addition, assembly of the recombinant spike proteins into VLPs was examined using a VLP affinity-isolation assay (de Haan et al., 2000) . Thus, the MHV M and E protein were co-expressed using the vaccinia virus expression system in OST7-1 cells in combination with either the MHV S protein or the MFF, MFM, or MMF S proteins. Cells were radiolabeled from 6 to 9 h post-infection (pi) after which cell lysates and media were prepared and subjected to coIP and VLP affinity isolation, respectively, with either the anti-MHV serum or the anti-S mAb (Fig. 2) . The intracellular expression of the M protein and the (recombinant) S proteins was confirmed by immunoprecipitation with the anti-MHV serum ( Fig.  2A) . The immunoprecipitation performed on cell lysates expressing the MHV M + E + S proteins using the anti-S mAb not only brought down the S protein but, as anticipated, also the MHV M protein, indicating that the proteins occurred in association (positive control). The chimeric proteins MFF and MMF, both containing the CD of FIPV S, did not interact with the MHV M protein, as judged from the absence of co-precipitation (negative control). In contrast, the M protein was co-precipitated when co-expressed with the MFM chimera, indicating that the CD of MHV S is required for the interaction and that replacement of just the transmembrane domain of MHV S by that of FIPV S does not affect this interaction. The assembly of the MHV-FIPV S chimeric proteins into viral particles was examined by performing affinity-isolations of VLPs present in the culture media (Fig. 2B ). VLPs were formed whenever the MHV M and E protein were coexpressed, as shown by the presence of the M protein in immuno-isolations done with the anti-MHV serum. Copurification of M from the culture media using the anti-S mAb was observed when the M and E proteins were coexpressed with either the MHV S protein or the chimeric protein MFM, but not with the MFF and MMF chimeras.",

Co-immunoprecipitation of FIPV M protein was not seen when MHV S or the MFM chimera were coexpressed, confirming that the S protein's CD is required for the specific interaction with the M protein.

            "text": "S protein cytoplasmic domain is sufficient for particle incorporation Because coronavirus S protein TM domains are sufficiently conserved (65% identity; Fig. 1A ) to potentially explain the lack of effect of their swapping between MHV S and FIPV S on the interaction of the S proteins with the M proteins and on their incorporation into VLPs, we could not conclude that the CD by itself is responsible for these observations. To further study the importance of this domain we investigated whether the MHV S CD is sufficient to mediate the assembly of a foreign viral membrane protein into the MHV envelope. Thus we made vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) G/MHV S chimeras in which the entire carboxy-terminal domain (G-STC) or just the CD (G-SC) of the non-related G protein were replaced by that of MHV S (Fig. 1B) . The chimeric proteins were examined for their ability to interact with MHV M protein and for their incorporation into MHV-based VLPs using again the coimmunoprecipitation and VLP affinity isolation assays. The MHV M and E protein were co-expressed alone or in combination with either the wild-type VSV G protein or one of the chimeric G-STC or G-SC proteins as described before. Co-immunoprecipitation of radiolabeled viral proteins from the cell lysates and VLP affinity isolation from the culture media were performed using the anti-MHV serum or the anti-VSV serum. The SDS-PAGE analyses of Fig. 3A show that the M protein, the VSV G protein, and the VSV G/MHV S chimeras were indeed produced. Where the chimeric proteins were expressed, the anti-VSV serum also precipitated an approximately 62-kDa protein. Most likely this protein corresponds to a soluble form of the VSV G/ MHV S chimeras, as has been observed previously for VSV G in infected cells (Garreis-Wabnitz and Kruppa, 1984; Graeve et al., 1986) . For wt VSV G this protein band was only apparent in the culture media (data not shown) indicating that during the chase the soluble form of VSV G was efficiently secreted. The MHV M protein was coimmunoprecipitated using the anti-VSV serum when coexpressed with G-STC and G-SC, but not with wild-type VSV G. This provides evidence that replacement of just the CD of VSV G by that of MHV S is sufficient for interaction with the MHV M protein. Consistently, VLPs could be affinity isolated from the culture medium using the anti-VSV serum (Fig. 3B ) when the M and E proteins were coexpressed with G-STC and G-SC but not with the wild-type VSV G protein, indicating that the S protein transmembrane domain is not required for interaction with the M protein and for subsequent VLP incorporation.",

The MHV spike protein has a 38-residue CD containing a conserved cysteine-rich region (boxed sequence in Fig. 1B ). This is probably the region where palmitoylation of the S protein occurs, while the region has also been implicated to play a role in membrane fusion (Bos et al., 1995) . Three S protein mutants were constructed in which the CD was truncated by 12, 25, and 35 residues, respectively. When expressed in cells the proteins could be detected at the cell surface by immunofluorescence (data not shown) indicating their proper transport to the plasma membrane. Their membrane fusion capacity was tested in a cell-cell fusion assay (Fig. 4) . Truncation of the spike CD by 12 or 25 residues (SD12 and SD25, respectively) did not abolish cell-cell fusion, although less fusion was observed with the SD25 mutant. No cell-cell fusion was seen with the SD35 mutant supporting the importance of the cysteine-rich region for membrane fusion. The truncated spike proteins were then assessed for their interaction with M protein and for their VLP incorporation by co-expression with the MHV M and E proteins as described before. The resulting cell lysates and culture media were subjected to co-immunoprecipitation and VLP affinity isolation, respectively, using the anti-MHV serum and the anti-S mAb followed by SDS-PAGE analysis. As the co-immunoprecipitation patterns of Fig. 5A demonstrate, the SD12 protein was able to interact with the M protein as efficiently as the wild-type S protein, whereas SD25 and SD35 showed a strong reduction in their ability to associate with the M protein. Consistently, the VLP affinity isolation showed the SD12 to be efficiently incorporated into VLPs whereas VLP inclusion of the spike mutants lacking the C-terminal 25 and 35 amino acids was almost completely abolished (Fig. 5B) .",

To facilitate the selection of recombinant viruses through the sensitive detection of luciferase activity we made use of a transfer vector containing, in addition to the modifications in the S genes, the Renilla luciferase gene inserted between the E and the M gene (MHV-ERLM) (de Haan et al., 2003) . We were able to recover infectious MHV in which the wild-type S gene had been replaced by the SD12 or the SD25 gene. Despite several attempts, replacement of the wt S gene by the SD35 gene was never successful and only yielded recombinants lacking the Renilla luciferase activity, apparently generated through double recombination. The failure to produce infectious MHV-ERLM-SD35 virus was not unexpected, as the truncated SD35 protein had lost the cell-cell fusion activity. The identity of the MHV-ERLM-SD12 and MHV-ERLM-SD25 recombinant viruses was examined by RT-PCR. An RT-PCR was performed on the viral RNA by amplifying a region covering the CD using a forward primer located in the ectodomain encoding part of the S gene and a reverse primer complementary to the ORF 4 gene (Fig. 6B ). For reference purposes, PCRs were also performed on the transfer vectors used to make the recombinant viruses. The RT-PCR products obtained with the MHV-ERLM-SD12 and -SD25 viruses were found to correspond to the sizes of the PCR products obtained with the corresponding transfer vectors. Sequence analysis of the RT-PCR products confirmed the introduction of the intended spike CD truncation.",

            "text": "The replacement of the wild-type spike gene in the virus by the truncated SD12 and SD25 genes allowed us to directly quantitate the effects of CD truncations on virus production. We first assessed their effect on plaque formation. Plaque size of the MHV-ERLM-SD12 and -SD25 was measured in LR7 cells relative to the MHV-ERLM. The plaque size of two independently obtained MHV-ERLM-SD12 recombinant viruses appeared to be reduced to~75%, whereas MHV-ERLM-SD25 recombinant virus showed tiny plaques which were at~35% of the MHV-ERLM plaque size (Fig. 7A) . The effect of the truncation in MHV-ERLM-SD12 on the virus The plasmids pXH 2 ERLM-SD12, -SD25, and -SD35 (see Materials and methods) were used to transcribe the defective RNAs in vitro by using T7 polymerase. The arrow at the left end of the vectors indicates the T7 promoter; the solid circle represents the polylinker between the 5V-end segment of the MHV genome (labeled 5V/1) and the HE gene, which is followed by the structural and group specific genes, the inserted Renilla luciferase gene (RL), the 3V untranslated region (UTR), and the polyadenylate segment (labeled 3V/U). The asterisk indicates the position of the S protein cytoplasmic domain truncations. The lower part shows a scheme for targeted recombination by using the interspecies chimeric fMHV, which grows only in feline cells. Recombinant viruses generated by the indicated crossover event can be selected on the basis of their ability to grow in murine cells and by the acquired yield per cell was analyzed by performing a one-step growth curve. A comparative analysis with the MHV-ERLM-SD25 mutant was not feasible, as its severely impaired growth (maximum titer~2 \u00c2 10 2 PFU/ml) and did not allow production of an amount of virus sufficient for the experiment. LR7 cells were infected in parallel with the MHV-ERLM and the independently obtained MHV-ERLM-SD12 A and B viruses using a high MOI to obtain a synchronous infection in all cells. Unadsorbed virus was washed away and virus release was subsequently measured over time by performing a TCID 50 assay (Fig. 7B ) and a luciferase assay (Fig. 7C) with samples taken at different time points during infection. The luciferase expression levels obtained with the different viruses were indistinguishable, confirming that the same amounts of cells had been infected. However, the release of infectious MHV-ERLM-SD12 recombinant viruses was significantly lower (~1 log) compared to that of the MHV-ERLM virus, indicating a slight effect of the spike cytoplasmic domain truncation on virus reproduction. To try obtaining revertants of the MHV-ERLM-SD25 virus with regained viability we carried out low-multiplicity passaging of the mutant virus. By passage 6, we observed a more severe and faster developing cytopathic effect for two independently passaged viruses. The titers reached with these viruses were indeed increased significantly, i.e., by about 3 logs (from 2 \u00c2 10 2 to 2 \u00c2 10 5 PFU/ml). To determine the sequence changes responsible for this gain in fitness, we sequenced a region of the two MHV-ERLM-SD25 revertants after RT-PCR amplification of genomic viral RNA with the same primers as used for Fig. 6 . Both revertants showed an identical 17-nucleotide deletion in the S gene 3V region that deleted the stop codon and resulted in a predicted 6-residue extension of the cytoplasmic domain (Fig. 7D) . The relative plaque size of the MHV-ERLM-SD25 revertants was increased compared to that of MHV-ERLM-SD25 but their size remained smaller than that of the parental MHV-ERLM. To exclude that other mutations introduced into the viral genome during passaging were responsible for the increased growth of the revertant viruses we introduced the 17-nt deletion into the MHV-ERLM background. The yields of two independently obtained MHV-ERLM-SD25R viruses A and B (max titers 2 \u00c2 10 5 PFU/ml) and the observed plaque sizes of these viruses (Fig. 7A) were indistinguishable from that of the MHV-ERLM-SD25 revertants demonstrating that the cytoplasmic domain extension was responsible for the reversion phenotype (Schnell et al., 1998) .",

            "text": "An intriguing question we have addressed in this paper is how coronaviruses regulate the selective inclusion of the viral spike protein into their envelope against a huge background of host membrane proteins. The stringency of this selection process is likely to be determined by the budding strategy of the viruses, by affinity interactions with the viral membrane protein M, and by the geometrical constraints of the viral envelope and particle. That this is a process of great specificity is illustrated by the fact that coronaviruses cannot be pseudotyped by spike proteins of other coronaviruses as was demonstrated for MHV and FIPV S proteins using VLPs. Only when provided with the proper, i.e., cognate carboxy-terminal sequence could S proteins be swapped (Godeke et al., 2000b; Kuo et al., 2000) , indicating that the TM and/or CD are critical for incorporation into the assembling virion. Here we mapped the essential sequences to the CD of the S protein. First we show, by exchanging domains between the S proteins of MHV and FIPV, that this domain determines its interaction with the M protein, an association that is key to its assembly. Then we show that the MHV S protein CD, not its TM, could confer to the FIPV S protein the ability to become assembled into MHV particles. Finally, to rule out that a coronaviral TM is somehow important, we demonstrate that the MHV S protein CD is sufficient to mediate MHV particle assembly of a foreign viral membrane protein not normally incorporated into coronavirus.",

            "text": "Cytoplasmic domains of viral membrane proteins appear to have important functions in the assembly of many enveloped viruses. These functions vary, depending on the particular virus and its way of budding. For alphaviruses, for instance, where the membrane proteins are unable to effect budding on their own, the cytoplasmic domain of the E2 glycoprotein plays a critical role in the interaction with the capsid protein during particle formation (Suomalainen et al., 1992; Zhao et al., 1994) . Paramyxovirus particle assembly requires the co-expression of the viral matrix protein with one of the two envelope glycoproteins, HN or F, together with the nucleocapsid protein . A critical role for the cytoplasmic tails in this process has been reported for several members including measles virus (Cathomen et al., 1998), Sendai virus (Fouillot-Coriou and Roux, 2000; Takimoto et al., 1998) , and Simian virus 5 (SV5) (Schmitt et al., 1999; Waning et al., 2002) . In Sendai virus the matrix protein was shown to interact independently with the cytoplasmic tails of the HN and F glycoproteins (Ali and Nayak, 2000; Sanderson et al., 1994) . The roles of the cytoplasmic tails in paramyxovirus assembly seem redundant as in SV5 the truncation of either of the two but not of both appeared to be tolerated . Such redundancy was also observed with the orthomyxovirus influenza A where the cytoplasmic tails of the two glycoproteins, HA and NA, determine budding efficiency as well as particle morphology. While their separate removal had only limited effects, the lack of both tails resulted in severely impaired formation of deformed particles (Jin et al., 1994 (Jin et al., , 1997 Mitnaul et al., 1996; Zhang et al., 2000) . For rhabdoviruses and retroviruses (Mebatsion et al., 1996; Wilk et al., 1992) there is no absolute requirement for a cytoplasmic domain of their envelope glycoprotein for assembly. While the G protein tail greatly enhances VSV production, a strict sequence requirement does not exist as a G protein with a foreign cytoplasmic tail of sufficient length could be incorporated efficiently (Schnell et al., 1998) . This G protein tail on the other hand can specifically direct the incorporation of the HIV-1 envelope protein into VSV particles, which the wild-type envelope protein does not (Owens and Rose, 1993) . Coronaviral S proteins generally exhibit little sequence conservation. This is particularly the case for the receptor binding part S1 where hardly any sequence similarities occur between proteins from different groups. Regions of sequence identity of up to approximately 30% are found in the part responsible for membrane fusion, S2 (Cavanagh, 1995) . In the carboxy-terminal domain two areas of conservation occur. One is at the transition of TM and ectodomain, i.e., where the S protein exits the viral membrane. It is characterized by a conspicuous, highly conserved 8-residue sequence (KWPWY/WVWL) supposedly important for membrane fusion but not, as we show here, for S protein incorporation into particles. The other area occurs in the membrane-proximal part of the CD. It does not involve sequence conservation but, rather, the conserved abundance of cysteines (about 24%). Our carboxy-terminal truncations reveal that it is this particular domain that mediates particle assembly of the coronaviral spikes.",

Whether acylation is in some way important for S protein assembly is unknown. Theoretical analysis using the hydrophobicity scale (Eisenberg et al., 1982) predicts this domain to form an amphipathic alpha-helix in which the cysteine residues occur clustered on one side of the helix (data not shown). It is conceivable that hydrophobic acyl chains connected to the cysteines promote membrane association of the alpha-helical domain by inserting into the lipid bilayer. It is of note that an amphipathic region also occurs in the carboxy-terminal domain of the M protein (Rottier, 1995b) . This domain has a strong tendency to associate with membranes by itself (Mayer et al., 1988) . Mutation studies have shown that deletions in this domain severely affect interaction of M with the S protein (de Haan et al., 1999) . It is thus feasible that incorporation of the S protein into the coronaviral envelope is mediated by interactions between the amphipathic domains of the two proteins.",

Though clearly distinct processes, the truncations in the spike CD affected both features similarly, a short truncation having limited effect, longer truncations interfering increasingly both with assembly and with fusion. The importance of the cysteine-rich region for membrane fusion has already been established before (Bos et al., 1995; Chang et al., 2000) . It was shown that a spike mutant from which part of the cysteine-rich region had been deleted, was able to promote hemifusion, but blocked in fusion pore formation. In addition, single cysteine mutations severely impaired membrane fusion activity (Chang et al., 2000) . Whether this effect was due to acylation being prevented is unclear but it is conceivable that the membrane-inserted hydrophobic acyl chains play a role in fusion pore formation. A positive role of palmitoylation in cell fusion has been reported for influenza virus HA protein (Naeve and Williams, 1990; Sakai et al., 2002) , but this role was found to be negative for VSV (Whitt and Rose, 1991) , influenza virus (Naim et al., 1992; Steinhauer et al., 1991) , or the Murine leukemia virus fusion protein (Yang and Compans, 1996) .",

Introduction of the cytoplasmically truncated S constructs into the viral genome by targeted recombination yielded viable viruses except, as expected, for the truncation affecting the fusion function. While the lack of 12 cytoplasmic residues had a quite marginal effect on viral growth, deletion of 25 residues crippled the virus severely. Serial passaging of the latter virus led to the emergence of revertants that had regained fitness by a deletion generating an accidental 6-residue extension of the cytoplasmic tail. That the approximately 3 logs higher titers obtained with these revertants were indeed accounted for by this particular deletion rather than by the occurrence of additional, compensating mutations in other genes, notably in the M or E gene, was confirmed by demonstrating that a recombinant virus carrying only this mutation exhibited the same growth phenotype. The sequence of the 6-amino acid extension appeared to have no similarity to the deleted sequence suggesting that, for some reason, a minimal tail length of about 20 residues is required; shorter tails (i.e., removal of 18 residues or more) are disproportionately detrimental. The observations are reminiscent of findings with the rhabdovirus VSV which, as mentioned above, shows reduced viral titers when the G protein's 29-residues cytoplasmic domain is removed. Upon passaging of the tail-less recombinant virus a revertant growing to wild-type levels was obtained, which encoded a new 8 amino acid tail the sequence of which was unrelated to that of the wild-type VSV G carboxy-terminal tail.",

Capped, run-off donor RNAs transcribed from the PacI-truncated transcription vectors were electroporated into feline FCWF cells that had been infected 4 h earlier by fMHV (Kuo et al., 2000) . These cells were then divided over two T25 flasks containing a monolayer of LR7 cells, to obtain two independent recombinant viruses (clones A and B). Progeny viruses released into the media were harvested and candidate recombinants were selected by two rounds of plaque purification on LR7 cells. RT-PCR was used to amplify regions of cytoplasmic RNA isolated from cells infected with MHV-ERLM or MHV-ERLM-SD12 (clones A and B) and MHV-ERLM-SD25 (clone B). The approximate locations of primers 1036, 1090, and 1261 in the recombinant MHV genomes are shown (Fig. 6B ). RT-PCR was performed on the MHV genomic RNA using primer 1261, whereas the PCR was performed on the RT-PCR product using primers 1036 and 1090. The PCR products obtained were cloned into pGEM-T-Easy and sequenced. The observed 17-nt deletion in the PCR product of the passaged MHV-ERLM-SD25 revertant, which resulted in a 6-aa extension of the S protein cytoplasmic domain, was reintroduced into the MHV-ERLM genome. To this end, the cloned RT-PCR product was digested with AccI and StyI and the 450-bp fragment was cloned into the pBL59 vector resulting in pBL59-SD25R. The transcription vector pXH 2 -ERLM-SD25R, needed to produce donor RNA for the construction of recombinant MHV-ERLM-SD25R via targeted recombination, was created by ligation of the MluI-EcoRV fragment of pBL59-SD25R into the MluI-EcoRV digested pXH 2 -ERLM vector (Kuo et al., 2000) . The final construct was verified by DNA sequencing and recombinant virus (MHV-ERLM-SD25R) was made as described above. Table 1 Primers used for plasmid construction The VSV gene was excised from plasmid pSVGL11, a derivative of pSVGL (Rose and Bergmann, 1982) using XhoI. The DNA fragment was filled in with the Klenow enzyme and ligated into the BamHI digested and Klenow blunted pTUG31 linearized vector (Vennema et al., 1991) yielding the pTUGVG10 plasmid. The fragment encoding the VSV G ectodomain was excised from pSV045R-ts (kindly provided by Dr. J.K. Rose) (Gallione and Rose, 1985) by using XhoI and SstI and cloned into pTUG31 treated with the same enzymes, resulting in the plasmid pTVGtsDTMCD. The vector pTVGts-STC, encoding the hybrid protein G-STC, contains the sequence encoding the ectodomain of VSV G and the TM and CD of MHV S. A DNA fragment specifying the TM and CD of MHV S was PCR amplified from the plasmid pTUMS using the primers 1031 and 1032. The purified PCR product was treated with SstI and BamHI and cloned into the SstI-BamHI digested pTVGts\u00c4 TMCD vector. The vector pTVGts-SC, encoding the hybrid proteins G-SC, contains the sequence for the ectodomain and TM of VSV G fused to that for the Cterminal 38 residues of MHV S. The pTVGts-SC construct was prepared by SOE-PCR. The TM coding region of the VSV G gene and the CD coding region of MHV S were PCR amplified using the inside primers 1073 and 1074 and the external primers 1029 and 1032, respectively.

Purified PCR products were then mixed and a second round of PCR was performed using the external primers 1029 and 1032.

At t = 6 h the radioactivity was chased by incubating the cells with medium containing 2 mM methionine and 2 mM cysteine. At t = 9 h cells were placed on ice, and the media were collected and cleared by centrifugation for 15 min at 4,000 \u00c2 g and 4 8C. The media were prepared for immunoprecipitation in the absence or presence of detergents, by addition of 2.5 volume of TEN buffer (Tris pH 7.6, 1 mM EDTA, 50 mM NaCl) or 1/4 volume of 5\u00c2 concentrated detergent buffer (final concentration 50 mM Tris-Cl pH 8.0, 62.5 mM EDTA, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.5% Nonidet P-40), respectively. Cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing Ca 2+ and Mg 2+ and lysed with 600 Al detergent buffer containing 1 mM PMSF. The cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation for 10 min at 10,000 \u00c2 g at 4 8C and diluted five times with detergent buffer. Viral proteins in the cell lysates and culture media were incubated overnight (O/N) at 4 8C with the polyclonal MHV-A59 antiserum (2 Al), the polyclonal VSV antiserum (2 Al), the mAb WA3.10 (20 Al), and the mAb OKT8 (50 Al). The immune complexes were adsorbed to Pansorbin cells (Calbiochem) for 30 min at 4 8C and were subsequently collected by low-speed centrifugation. Pellets were washed three times by resuspension and centrifugation with either detergent buffer or TEN buffer. Pellets were resuspended and heated in Laemmli sample buffer at 95 8C for 2 min before being analyzed by SDS-PAGE in 15% polyacrylamide gels.",

A 17-nucleotide deletion indicated by a dashed line was observed in the sequence of two MHV-ERLM-SD25 recombinant viruses that had been passaged independently for 6 rounds and had regained fitness. The deletion resulted in an extension of the cytoplasmic domain with 6 amino acids (SD25R) compared to the original MHV-ERLM-SD25 recombinant (SD25).
