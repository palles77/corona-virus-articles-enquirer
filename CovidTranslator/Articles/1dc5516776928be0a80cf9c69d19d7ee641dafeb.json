Graduates of medical schools in Korea are selected and serve as public health doctors (PHDs) for their mandatory military service. The duration of service is 3 years and PHDs comprise general practitioners and specialists. Some PHDs are selected as EIS officers with 3 weeks basic FETP training and work for central and provincial public health authorities to conduct epidemiological investigations. The total number of EIS officers is 31 as of 2012. The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) has 12 specialists, whereas specialists and each province has one or two EIS officers to administer local epidemiological investigations in 253 public health centers. The Korean EIS officers have successfully responded and prevented infectious diseases, but there is a unique limitation: the number of PHDs in Korea is decreasing and PHDs are not allowed to stay outside Korea, which makes it difficult to cope with overseas infectious diseases. Furthermore, after 3 years service, they quit and their experiences are not accumulated. KCDC has hired full-time EIS officers since 2012 to overcome this limitation.",

In major epidemics, joint investigation was conducted with experts in the civil sector. Control was for epidemics only and no epidemiological investigators were available except in central government, therefore, control and surveillance of infectious diseases had limitations [1] . The existing control system has reached its capacity since the 1980s with massive outbreaks of water and food-borne diseases and emergence/outbreaks of various infectious diseases such as leptospirosis, legionella, Vibrio vulnificus septicemia, scrub typhus, hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome, anthrax, and tularemia. Epidemiological investigations on shigellosis were not routinely conducted, with the exception of some outbreaks, which is a huge limitation in establishing disease control policy. Furthermore, there has been a re-emergence and consistent increase in incidence of vivax malaria since 1993, after elimination in 1978, and it has not been systematically investigated [2] .",

The officers comprised existing public health officials and public health doctors (PHDs) who were supposed to take mandatory military service based on the \"Special Act for Public Health and Medicine in Rural Areas\" [3] . They took a 2-week FETP and were dispatched to KNIH and 16 provincial public health authorities, and were involved in epidemiological investigations and research. The pilot program of EIS officers has been successfully established with relative ease of securing qualified experts. The regular EIS and FETP program began in 2000. With a revision of the Communicable Disease Act on January 12, 2000 in which epidemiological investigations were specified, the EIS officers conducted an active investigation with support of the legal system [4] . The EIS officers take 3 weeks basic training and go through two sessions of on-the-job training. About 30 EIS officers are available each year. 2012 saw the 14 th graduation of FETP/EIS officers, and a total of 213 graduates have worked as EIS officers. Most of the PHDs appointed to the EIS officers are specialists who have finished resident training courses. The specialties of EIS officers are varied: internal medicine forms the largest proportion, followed by pediatrics, family medicine, preventive medicine, and neurology (Table 1 ).",

Japan started an FETP and produced five graduates in 1999, focusing on the epidemiological investigation of infectious diseases.

The European Union has the European Programme for Intervention Epidemiology Training (EPIET) in which the medical doctors, nurses, microbiologists, veterinarians, epidemiologists, and public-health-related experts of 26 countries participate. EPIET has a 3-week basic course and field training, and four or five 1-week modules for 2 years. Germany has a 2-year Postgraduate Training for Applied Epidemiology, which is run closely with EPIET and most applicants are medical doctors. The 29 graduate from 1995 to 2006 have worked as EIS officers [20] . Korea has similar 3week basic training courses and four sessions of onthe-job training with other FETP trainees, but the Korean EIS officers take different tracks after completion of FETP. Most Korean graduates work in the clinical field, whereas most FETP graduates go the public health route (Table 3) . This difference might be explained by motivation: the Korean FETP is part of the mandatory military service for male doctors, so specialists can be recruited with a relatively low salary, but they have a corresponding low interest in public health. After their period of duty, they return to their clinical fields.",

This is related to the change in the Korean medical school system, and the proportion of men is decreasing in medical schools. To overcome these limitations, requires a lot of effort from KCDC. One of the most important changes has been for KCDC to select its own EIS official from 2012. Their status is as central government officials. These KCDC EIS officials are expected to complement current PHD EIS officers and to fill the vacuum caused by the lack of PHDs to some extent. KCDC EIS officials play a key role in longterm projects and research, and education of new EIS officers, and can actively cope with the international surveillance of infectious diseases. However, utilization of previous EIS officers' experiences and knowledge is still limited, because they have no obligation and it is hard to draw any motivation from them.

Most male students admitted to the graduate medical schools have already fulfilled their military duties, and the proportion of female students has increased rapidly. As a result, the number of PHDs is sharply decreasing, so it is difficult to secure EIS applicants. Second, efficiency and continuity of work decreases. After 3 years completion of FETP, new EIS officers replace the graduates and need time to become accustomed to the new environment. This has a negative long-term effect on the project or research. Third, the PHDs' official status is as an army officer, so they have restrictions on staying overseas. This hinders international travel and activity of EIS officers[22,23]. Considering the recent trends in most imported emerging/re-emerging infectious diseases, this travel limitation should be cleared for effective international collaboration in epidemiological investigation and infectious disease control. Fourth, PHDs' experiences and knowledge are not smoothly progressed. Few of them work for KCDC, and most of them practice in the community or return to the university hospitals. Some EIS graduates in university hospitals work together with KCDC for research and consultation, but most EIS graduates have no further relationship with KCDC.",
