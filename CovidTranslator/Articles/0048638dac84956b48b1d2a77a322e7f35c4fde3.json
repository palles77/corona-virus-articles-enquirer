Recent studies have investigated how the phenotypic composition of groups or aggregations (e.g., its average phenotype or phenotypic variance) affects ecological and social processes, and how multi-level selection can drive phenotypic covariance among interacting individuals. However, we argue that these questions are rarely studied together. We present a unified framework to address this gap, and discuss how group phenotypic composition (GPC) can impact on processes ranging from individual fitness to population demography. By emphasising the breadth of topics affected, we hope to motivate more integrated empirical studies of the ecological and evolutionary implications of GPC.",

Individuals can aggregate into groups, and the composition of these groups, populations, or communities (herein group phenotypic composition or GPC, see Glossary) can affect group-level dynamics and self-organisation. For example, large groups of highly similar individuals can benefit from lower predation pressure by making it difficult for predators to track individuals (the confusion effect [1,2]). Eventually, this can drive selection operating on individual phenotypes [3, 4] , in this case by selecting against rare phenotypes because individuals who look different will be more likely to be taken by predators (the oddity effect [1]). Selection arising from GPC can lead to an evolutionary response of individual phenotypes. GPC can shape the evolution of behaviours that mediate individual movements between groups, phenotypic plasticity (individuals adjust their phenotype in response to particular GPCs), or phenotypic traits that allow individuals to manipulate the characteristics of their group. Selection from GPC can also directly modify the covariance between individual and group phenotypes through the removal of particular phenotypes within generations. All these evolutionary responses at the individual level are likely to modify GPC itself. Despite extensive theoretical considerations (see [5] ), the role of GPC as an agent of selection shaping individual fitness and as an emergent property of the individual phenotypes have rarely been considered together in empirical studies.",

Beyond the consequences of individual phenotypes on fitness (natural selection), GPC can favour all members (group-level selection) or favour particular phenotypes over others (social selection). Blue (dashed) and black (solid) lines represent two groups with different GPCs. (E) GPC can drive different evolutionary responses. These include traits affecting covariation between individual phenotypes and their GPC (e.g., decisions to join or leave particular groups), the evolution of individual phenotypic plasticity in response to GPC (e.g., individuals change their phenotypes to match the group), or the evolution of individual contributions to GPC (e.g., individuals change the behaviour of group members). These evolutionary responses can then affect the distribution of phenotypes in subsequent generations. framework to draw general predictions about how GPC affects the evolution of individual phenotypes and ecological processes, and how the feedback between the evolution of individual phenotypes and group-level outcomes alters GPC. We then show how this framework can be applied to an array of fields by detailing empirical studies that have investigated the role of GPC in either shaping individual fitness or generating emergent properties of animal groups. We hope that outlining the similarities among topics will help to create an integrated research agenda to begin addressing the effects of GPC on individual fitness (selective consequences) and the response of individuals to the selective consequences of GPC (evolutionary implications) in unison.",

            "text": "Variation in Individual Fitness Resulting from GPC Many studies have investigated how phenotypic variation among individuals is associated with variation in individual fitness, and how GPC affects the relationship between the phenotype of an individual and their fitness. GPC can be a function of the phenotypes of its members (such as the frequency of fast-exploring individuals, or the phenotype of the least-exploratory individual) [11] or an emergent property that is not attributable to any single individual, such as the mating system (see section 2.2 in [12] ). GPC can affect individual fitness by influencing the overall performance of the group on collective tasks, affecting all the members of any given group equally, or by affecting the relative performance of different phenotypes within groups. For instance, a group with more aggressive individuals can be more successful at foraging, but aggressive individuals can have a higher fitness than nonaggressive individuals because they can monopolise a larger share of the total resources. It is interesting to note that the selection acting on individual phenotypes within groups can conflict with the selection acting on the individual phenotypes among groups [13] . Studying fitness in the context of phenotypes and how GPC modulates fitness, both within and across species, provides good insights on the overall potential selective consequences of GPC for the individuals within them.",

            "text": "Net Selection Arising from GPC In addition to requiring phenotypic variation in fitness, net selection strongly depends on the covariance between the phenotype of an individual and the phenotypes of those it associates with [4, 14] . For example, if individual phenotypes experience all possible types of GPCs (i.e., GPC is effectively random) then no net selection will arise from GPC (although other mechanisms, such as genetic drift, may still shape GPC). A key insight is that a range of behavioural traits and ecological processes can determine the covariance pattern in GPC, and hence drive net selection. For example, limited dispersal can result in individuals with similar phenotypes forming groups more often than random. Thus, behaviours can therefore modulate the strength of selection arising from GPC on other traits [4] . For instance, aggressive male water striders (Aquarius remigis) respond to negative fitness effects of aggressiveness within their group by moving between groups [15] . Similarly, many species respond to competition under different ecological conditions by switching between single-species groups and mixed-species groups [16] . 'indirect effects' [5, 14] or the Baldwin effect [17] ). These theoretical tools are applicable to studying the evolutionary implications of GPC (Box 1). Individuals can respond to the effect of GPC by altering the phenotypic composition of the group (for example by controlling access to the group) and/or by changing their own phenotype (phenotypic plasticity in response to the size implies that groups are composed of either all large or all small individuals. Parameter b y : the relationship between the fitness of an individual and GPC. Parameter b yz : the interaction between the effect of GPC and the phenotype of an individual on their fitness. This is the extent to which the selection gradient associated with the phenotype of an individual changes with GPC. Parameter b z : the relationship between the phenotype of an individual and their fitness. Parameter C yz : the effect of an individual with a particular phenotype on GPC. For instance, an aggressive individual can increase the overall number of aggressive interactions in a group. Parameter C zy : the indirect effect of GPC on the expression of the phenotype of an individual. For example, a group can constrain the maximum movement speed of its members.",

            "text": "Applying an Integrated Framework to Study the Evolution of GPC Combining the effect of GPC on individual fitness with an analysis of its selective consequences and evolutionary implications allows us to identify five main ways in which group composition can matter for the evolution of individual phenotypes or for the maintenance of phenotypic variation (Box 1). First, GPC can simply alter the fitness consequences associated with individual phenotypes (i.e., via direct selection, b y , or by selection mediated by the properties of their group, b yz , Box 1). Second, individual phenotypes can co-vary with group composition (high COV zy ) and thus modulate the net selection force exerted on individual phenotypes. Third, GPC can affect the expression, and therefore the heritability, of individual phenotypes. Hence, GPC can amplify or weaken the ability of the population to respond to selective pressures (high or low C zy ). Fourth, if GPC modulates selection, and individual phenotypes can respond to selective pressures, this can drive a feedback between them. A synergy between the effect of the group on individual phenotypes (C zy ) and the contribution of individual phenotypes to the group composition (C yz ) can substantially increase or decrease the pace of evolutionary change in response to selection arising from GPC. Fifth, GPC is also an emergent property of genotypes and their patterns of expression. Hence, GPC or group-level outcomes could also be associated with genetic variation, respond to selection, and be an adaptation. The exact function linking genetic variation (or variation in breeding values) at the individual level to GPC at the group level, f(G z , G y ), will determine how much genetic variation in group composition is available for selection to shape group-level processes. Further, interacting phenotype theory typically considers only the group mean, although indirect genetic effects can make the group mean phenotype very different than a simple mean of the mean of the breeding values. In cases where group variance or extremes are important, linking GPC to individual breeding values remains unclear. Determining the amount of genetic variation in group mean phenotype, in the phenotypic variation, or in the phenotypic range still requires proper mathematical formalisation and is a major gap in this area.",

GPC can only matter when it introduces differences, or equalises existing differences, in fitness across different phenotypes (b y and b yz differ from zero). Assuming this is the case, GPC will have stronger selective consequences when the phenotypes of the members of a group or community are non-random (the covariance COV zy is high). An important prediction here is that net selection has the potential to be stronger in smaller groups (because, by definition, COV zy decreases with group size). Similarly, relatedness among group members leads to a higher covariance (COV zy ), and therefore groups with high relatedness should experience stronger selection arising from GPC. Higher covariance can also arise from habitat preferences, segregation, or local adaptation coupled with limited dispersal. Hence we expect GPC to be associated with stronger selection in these situations. Note that some aspects of GPC (e.g., the average phenotype of a group) can co-vary with the phenotype of its members to a greater extent than other aspects (e.g., the variance, or the highest phenotypic value).",

When individual phenotype is fixed (non-labile), selection resulting from GPC should result in the evolution of behaviours that will affect the covariance between the phenotypes of members of the group or community (COV zy ), such as decision rules for joining or leaving, habitat selection, or manipulation of group composition by individuals (e.g., evicting particular members from the groups). On the other hand, when traits are labile and can be modulated in response to the environment (e.g., individuals can express varying levels of aggressiveness in different contexts), then we expect that selection associated with GPC will affect the evolution of individual phenotypic plasticity in response to their social environment (C zy ) and/or the evolution of the effect that individuals have on the characteristics of their group (C yz , which can eventually lead to niche construction [19, 20] ). These traits (C zy and C yz ) could evolve [21] to differ among individuals [22] and co-vary according to other aspects of individual phenotypes [23] .",

Thus, GPC can affect the fitness of all group members equally by collectively reducing their predation risk (confusion effect, b y ) or favour particular phenotypes (oddity effect, b yz ). For example, predation risk for prey of particular body sizes varies depending on the ratio of small to large individuals [2] , and odd fish are disproportionately likely to leave their shoal (thus affecting COV zy ) [38] . The defensive ability of a given group also varies with group composition: in honey bee Apis mellifera colonies, the proportion of defensive individuals affects the recruitment of workers against intruders, the defensive response of the colony, and the fitness of all the colony members [39] . Disease dynamics and parasite prevalence can also depend on the presence of a few highly social or promiscuous individuals in groups acting as superspreaders [40] [41] [42] . For example, 'Typhoid Mary', or the flight attendant spreading the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus between Asia and America, disproportionately contributed to major disease outbreaks. The consequences of group composition for disease dynamics is usually thought to decrease the fitness of all the group members in a similar way (b y ). However, GPC could also affect disease dynamics that differentially impact on particular phenotypes (b yz ). High levels of kinship could favour disease transmission if kinship promotes physical contact among kin members [43] , and net selection force can be stronger due to higher phenotypic covariance among group members (high COV zy ).

Cooperation among colony members is more common in colonies with high relatedness, either because it is beneficial for individuals to cooperate with kin (increase their C zy ) or because related groups with cooperative individuals outcompete other groups (b y and COV zy ) [45] ). Beyond these well-established effects, overall colony fitness can depend on the personality composition of its members. In North American ants Temnothorax longisinosus, colonies with greater variance in worker aggressiveness and exploration have increased per capita productivity via greater specialisation (b y ) [46, 47] . In the fire ant (Solenopsis invicta), a threshold frequency of 'tolerant workers' determines the acceptance of multiple queens into the colony [48] . This could potentially impact on the reproductive output of the colony. Similarly, in honey bees, workers vary in their responsiveness to queen pheromone (i.e., C zy ), and less-responsive workers are more likely to activate their ovaries and compete with the queen over reproduction [49] . Hence, worker responsiveness can affect the extent of competition over reproduction within the colony (b yz ). GPC can evolve in response to different environments: in social spiders, where all individuals reproduce and have no caste specialisation, colonies with more-docile individuals fair better in communities with less competitors [50] (Box 2). GPC can also become adapted to specific ecological conditions: when perturbed, colonies of social spiders recreate the specific optimal composition of their native environment [51] .",

Complex collective behaviours often arise from simple interaction rules, such as groups pooling information to make accurate decisions [52, 53] . Having a mix of informed and uninformed individuals can promote better decision-making because the latter support consensus via a majority [54] . Informed individuals can also lead groups to resources [55] . In homing pigeons, experienced individuals contribute more to the route of the group back to the coop [56] , while old female matriarch killer whales (Orcinus orca) lead the group to resources when food abundance is low [57] . In great tits (Parus major), phenotypic variance in groups is important because slow-exploring individuals maintain group cohesion, while fast-exploring individuals sample new patches, thus 'leading' the group [8] . Thus, who is in moving groups can affect how well the group makes decisions (through C yz or b y ), and potentially the fitness of group members (z i ). Group composition can even have carry-over effects on behaviour if new individuals acquire the behaviours of group members via conformist or cultural transmission (C zy ) [58] . For example, juvenile whooping cranes (Grus qmericana) learn the migration routes from older individuals [59] , which could lead to consistent and maintained differences in migration costs between groups.",

However, other aspects of GPC, such as the presence or absence of particular phenotypes, can affect mating systems. For example, the presence of aggressive individuals in groups of water striders has a well-known effect on the operational sex ratio and mating activity within mating pools (e.g., [61] ). The presence of aggressive individuals drives other individuals out of the local area and decreases the intensity of scramble competition for females (aggressive individuals exhibit a strong C yz ). This reduces the overall mating rates of the group (b y ), but under these new social conditions more-aggressive males can get a bigger share of the mating (b yz ) (when measured at the individual level [13] ). Similarly, GPC is likely to have strong impact on group reproductive success in family groups, cooperatively breeders, and monogamous species with bi-parental care [62, 63] .",

In some cases, GPC impacts upon individual fitness long after the initial group members are gone (e.g., if behaviours are culturally transmitted), but GPC can also exert selection in populations consisting of highly ephemeral group membership [30] . Considering such group-level dynamics in the context of GPC opens up a range of questions, such as 'do species with fission-fusion exhibit more or less phenotypic variation in groups than socially-stable species?' Further issues are listed in the Outstanding Questions. Notably, the evolutionary implications of GPC are still rarely studied, as is the potential for GPC to shape the patterns of social organisation we observe in animal groups across multiple levels of selection (Box 4 gives a description of the types of data needed to study this). Individual behaviour and ecology not only determine the effects of GPC on individual fitness but also influence to what extent individual phenotypes co-vary with their group composition, and how groups and individuals determine each other's behaviours. Moreover, group-to-individual covariance, the constraints placed on individual phenotypes by the group, and individual contributions to group-level outcomes are thought to have the ability to evolve in response to selection [4, 5] generated by GPC. Nevertheless, no theory or empirical work has investigated the implications of such a claim for the evolution of individual and group phenotypes.",

Individuals can often choose between joining mixed-species flocks or forming single-species flocks (thus affecting COV zy ): mixedspecies flocking is generally hypothesised to reduce predation risk (increasing the fitness of all individuals) by combining individuals with different predator-detection skills and through forming larger groups (which is thought to reduce the overall COV zy , and act via b y , b yz , and C zy ).",

Several studies document the importance of key species in the formation and maintenance of interspecific groups. For example, mixed-species flocking in the Brazilian Atlantic forest depends on the presence of red-crowned ant-tanagers (Habia rubica) [83] . Similarly, birds on New Guinean islands only flock in the presence of particular species [84] . In both these cases, the same species flocked in patches with these key species, and did not flock when in their absence (thus the presence or absence of species affects z i through C zy ). These dynamics have been verified experimentally: removing nuclear species (tufted titmice, Baeolophus bicolor; Carolina chickadees, Poecile carolinensis; and black-capped chickadees, P. atricapillus) from some, but not other (control), isolated patches of woodland affected flocking dynamics in a range of attendant species (including white-breasted nuthatches, Sitta carolinensis; and downy woodpeckers, Picoides pubescens) [85] . At experimental sites, individuals were less likely to forage at exposed food sources, potentially because the flocking reduces perceived predation risk [86] , and individuals had lower body condition [87] than in control sites. Similar patterns where observed in guilds of carrion eaters where particular species facilitate resource discovery and others resource utilisation (through b y [32, 88] ).",

GPC has the potential to shape many attributes of individual phenotypes and/or the distribution of phenotypes in populations. Importantly, understanding what drives the evolutionary implications of GPC requires not only quantifying how GPC affects individual performance (i.e., estimating selection gradients) but also considering the patterns of phenotypic covariance within groups (or aggregations at other levels). Another key aspect to studying the impact of phenotypic variation is to quantify the extent to which individuals and those they interact with modulate each other's behaviours. How this underpins phenotypic covariance is rarely studied. A fascinating area for further theoretical and empirical research is the idea that these parameters can evolve (or coevolve), and this could potentially have profound effects on the dynamics of phenotypic adaptation. We emphasise the urgent need for theory to be expanded to support empirical research, and the need for future research that is tightly focused on the mechanisms determining the formation of groups in terms of individual phenotypes and group composition (for example, do groups reflect the underlying distribution of individuals in the wider population, or do individuals actively choose groups according to phenotypic composition?). We further emphasise the need for theoretical advances in understanding the co-evolution or co-dependence of group composition with the expression or value of individual phenotypes (through indirect effects). The study of the selective consequences and evolutionary outcomes of GPC is an area of increasing interest across a breadth of research areas. It will continue to be an exciting area of research, with potential to contribute to many classical questions in ecology and evolution.",

The behavioural mechanisms generating the covariance between individual phenotypes and group compositions can vary from one system or community to the next (e.g., non-random interaction patterns, habitat preferences [4] ). Hence, it is essential to take the biology of the system into account when designing studies, for example to avoid constraining individual decisions to join or leave groups. Mixed models facilitate analysing such datasets [91] because they can estimate individual phenotypic variation and its co-variation with group composition while accounting for temporal or spatial changes in these aspects and correcting for covariates [92, 93] . Such a dataset could eventually be extended to include repeated measurements of individual phenotypes as they sequentially join multiple groups, or to monitor changes in group structure as individuals join and leave them. Such a dataset can be used to quantify how much the GPC affects the expression of individual phenotypes (C zy ) and how much individuals contribute to group-level outcomes (C yz , [5, 94] ). Finally, when coupled with some knowledge of the pedigree of individuals and of the environmental conditions, such datasets can also be used to quantify how much of the variation in individual phenotypes and group structures is associated with additive genetic variation (G z , G y ), as opposed to how much phenotypic variation arises from environmental factors, to estimate indirect genetic effects, and to compute individual breeding values (a i , a j [71, 95, 96] ).",
