            "text": "Acute respiratory tract infections (ARTI), including the common cold, pharyngitis, sinusitis, otitis media, bronchiolitis and pneumonia are the most common diagnoses among patients seeking medical care in western countries, and account for most antibiotic prescriptions. While a confirmed and fast ARTI diagnosis is key for antibiotic prescribing, empiric antimicrobial treatment remains common, because viral symptoms are often clinically similar and difficult to distinguish from those caused by bacteria. As a result, inappropriate antibiotic prescriptions are high and in certain settings likely higher than the commonly estimated 30%. The QIAstat Respiratory Panel \u00ae assay (QIAstat RP) is a multiplexed in vitro diagnostics test for the rapid simultaneous detection of 21 pathogens directly from respiratory samples, including human mastadenovirus A-G, primate bocaparvovirus 1+2, human coronavirus (HKU1, NL63, OC43, 229E), human metapneumovirus A/B, rhinovirus/enterovirus, influenza A virus (no subtype, subtype H1, H1N1/2009, H3), influenza B virus, human respirovirus 1+3, human orthorubulavirus 2+4, human orthopneumovirus, Bordetella pertussis, Chlamydia pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Legionella pneumophila. We describe the first multicenter study of 445 respiratory samples, collected through the 2016-2017 and 2018 respiratory seasons, with performance compared against BioFire FilmArray RP v1.7 and discrepancy testing by Seegene Allplex RP. The QIAstat RP demonstrated a positive percentage of agreement of 98.0% (95% CI: 96.0-99.1%) and a negative percentage agreement of 99.8% (95% CI: 99.6-99.9%). With use of this comprehensive and rapid test, improved patient outcomes and antimicrobial stewardship may potentially be achieved.",

The QIAstat RP (Catalogue number 691211) is designed to run on the QIAstat DiagCORE Analyzer testing respiratory samples from individuals with signs and symptoms of an acute respiratory tract infection. Each QIAstat RP cartridge contains a full process Internal Control (IC), which is a MS2 bacteriophage that is included in dried format and gets automatically rehydrated upon sample loading. The IC verifies all steps of the analysis process during testing, including sample resuspension/homogenization, lysis, nucleic acid purification, reverse transcription, and PCR. The cartridge has two distinct loading ports and can be inoculated directly with a dry swab or with transport medium. In brief, samples were homogenized by vigorous inversion of the vial and 300 \u03bcL UTM was transferred into the assay cartridge using the provided transfer pipette. The inoculated cartridge was placed on the instrument. The test started automatically and ran for 69 minutes. Upon completing the test and ejecting the cartridge, the analyzer interpreted results and displayed a test summary. The analyzer will also report errors that may occur during processing. Amplification curves and cycle threshold (Ct) values can be viewed for detected pathogens and for the IC. A report can be printed or exported to an external USB storage device. The analyzer can be bidirectionally connected to laboratory information systems.",

The remaining eight single-infection pathogens were confirmed positive by the discrepancy method and thus considered true positives ( It was not possible to assess the sensitivity of the QIAstat RP for Legionella pneumophila or influenza A virus subtype H1N1 as these organisms were not detected by any of the methods.

Brendish et al reported on encouraging findings of PoC testing of respiratory viruses, as their studies showed that this testing was associated with a reduced length of hospital stay, resulted in more single doses or brief courses of antibiotics as well as in an improved influenza detection and antiviral use [15] . However, understanding of the full impact on patient management by the syndromic testing approach for ARTI as well as the cost-benefit will require more prospective outcome studies. Such studies would also provide information regarding which patient population(s) will benefit the most from respiratory tract syndromic testing and what the added benefits of syndromic testing compared to selected target testing (e.g. influenza A/B virus, human orthopneumovirus, hMPV, Bordetella pertussis or combinations hereof).",

The QIAstat RP detects 17 viral and four bacterial pathogens including human mastadenovirus A-G (formerly adenovirus), primate bocaparvovirus 1+2 (formerly bocavirus), human coronavirus (differentiating HKU1, NL63, OC43 or 229E), human metapneumovirus A/B (hMPV), rhinovirus/enterovirus, influenza A virus (as no subtype, subtype H1, H1N1/2009 or H3), influenza B virus, human respirovirus 1 or 3, human orthorubulavirus 2 or 4 (formerly human parainfluenza virus type 1-4), human orthopneumovirus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophilia, Bordetella pertussis and Chlamydia pneumoniae. A QIAstat RP test was considered valid if the test was completed normally and the control passed. Results for influenza A virus were reported as influenza A virus subtype H3N2, influenza A virus subtype H1N1, or influenza A virus A pdm2009 for the pandemic 2009 influenza A strain-in case both the influenza A virus and the respective subtype/strain were detected. In case no subtype was detected, influenza A virus was reported as influenza A virus, no subtype. This study was conducted with an investigational use only (IUO) version of the QIAstat RP. The final CE-marked QIAstat RP is identical to the IUO panel used in this study, with the exception that results for the Chlamydia pneumoniae target are not reported, pending regulatory clearance.",
