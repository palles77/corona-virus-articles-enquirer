To estimate the time at risk of COVID-19 exposure for travelers departing Italy, we obtained data from the United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) for the proportion of international travelers that are non-residents of Italy (63%) 4 and the average length of stay of tourists to Italy (3.4 days) 5 , and assumed the Italian epidemic began one month prior to February 29, 2020 6 .",
