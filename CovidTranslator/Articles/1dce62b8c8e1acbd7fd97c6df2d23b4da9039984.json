Since human beings learned to domesticate cattle about 10,000 years ago, nonhuman mammalian milk also has been used to supplement or replace maternal milk in the human infant. The development and widespread use of commercially prepared infant formula products have been phenomena of the 20th century and notably of the past 6 decades. Additional information acquired during the last several years has reinforced existing concepts on the role of breast-feeding in protecting the infant against infections, in providing an ideal source of infant nutrition, in modulating infectious immune responses, and in suppressing the evolution of neoplasms and autoimmune disease later in life. ' Over the past few decades, the immune responses on intestinal and respiratory mucosal surfaces to local infections have been intensely studied. These investigations have led to the development of concepts of immunity on mucosal surfaces of gastrointestinal, respiratory, and genitourinary tracts and identification of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) and local mechanisms of defense that are distinct from the internal (systemic) immune system.",

These initial phases of development take place in both genders (Table 5 -1). Further development in the male, however, appears to be limited by androgenic or other maleassociated substan~es.4'~ Castration in male rat embryos early in gestation leads to female breast development, whereas ovariectomy in the female does not alter the course of development of the mammary anlage. Toward the end of pregnancy, initial phases of fetal mammary differentiation seem to occur under the influence of placental and transplacentally acquired maternal hormones, with transient development of the excretory and lactiferous ductular systems. Such growth, differentiation, and secretory activities are transient and regress soon after birth. 536 At thelarche, and later on at menarche, true mammary growth and development begin in association with rapidly increasing levels of estrogens, progesterone, growth hormone, insulin, adrenocorticosteroids, and pr~lactin.~,' Estrogens appear to be important for the growth and development of the ductular system, and progestins, for lobuloalveolar development (see Table 5 -1). Final differentiation of the breast associated with growth and proliferation of the acinar lobes and alveoli continues to be influenced by the levels of estrogen and progesterone. Other peptide hormones, such as prolactin, insulin, and placental chorionic somatomammotropin, appear to be far more important for the subsequent induction and maintenance of lactation (see Table 5 -1).",

Initiation and Maintenance of Lactation. Pregnancy is marked by profound hormonal changes reflecting major secretory contributions from the placenta, the hypothalamus, and the pituitary gland, with contributions from a number of other endocrine glands (e.g., the pancreas, thyroid, and parathyroid). Increased estrogen and progesterone levels during pregnancy stimulate secretion of prolactin from the pituitary, whereas placental lactogen appears to inhibit the release of a prolactin-inhibiting factor from the hypothalamus. Prolactin, lactogen, estrogen, and progesterone all aid in preparing the mammary gland for lactation. Initially in gestation, an increased growth of ductule and alveolobular tissue occurs in response to estrogen and progesterone. In the beginning of the second trimester, secretory material begins to appear in the luminal cells. By the middle of the second trimester, mammary development has proceeded sufficiently to permit lactation to occur should parturition take place.",

The stimulation of the nipple by suckling activates a neural pathway that results in release of both prolactin and oxytocin. Prolactin is responsible for stimulating milk production, whereas oxytocin stimulates milk ejection (the combination is known as the let-down reflex).

The sIgA protein constitutes about 75% of the total nitrogen content of human milk.

Levels of IgA are 4 to 5 times greater than those of IgM, 20 to 30 times greater than those of IgG, and 5 to 6 times greater than those of serum As lactation progresses, IgA declines to levels that range from 20 to 27 mg per gram of protein, and IgM levels decline to 3.5 to 4.1 mg/g.

'06 This study found that breast-feeding may reduce the degree of seroconversion for poliovirus antibody in the vaccinated infants. Because antipolio IgA is present in human milk and colostrum, the investigators concluded that specific IgA may bind poliovirus and influence viral replication in the intestinal mucosa. Extensive experience with oral polio immunization worldwide, however, has not found an association between breastfeeding and live vaccine failures. Other studies have clearly shown that the magnitude of poliovirus replication in the intestine is determined by the presence and level of preexisting sIgA antibody. With high levels of intestinal IgA antibody, little or no replication of vaccine virus was observed in the gut. With lower levels, varying degrees of viral replication could be dem~nstrated.\"~ Indirect evidence, obtained from a more clinical perspective, suggests a protective role for milk against a variety of mucosal infections. Breast-feeding has been strongly implicated in supporting gastrointestinal homeostasis in the neonate and in establishing normal gut flora. Observations have shown the absence of diarrheal disease in breast-fed infants, even in the face of contamination of the fed milk with E. coli and Shigella species.'08 A preventive and therapeutic role for breast-feeding also has been suggested in nursery outbreaks of such disease due to enteropathogenic strains of E. coli1O9 and diarrhea associated with rotavirus.\"' Breast-feeding plays an inhibitory role in the appearance of E. coli 0 8 3 agglutinins found in the feces of colonized infants.

In addition, the possible transfer of histocompatibility antigens and T cells to the neonate through breast-feeding has been examined by determining the fate of skin grafts in suckling rats fed by allogeneic mothers.'57 Such foster feeding of milk may result not only in increased allogeneic graft survival but also in development of \"runting\" syndrome, possibly as a result of a graft-versus-host-type reaction in the breast-fed animal. Effects of the transfer may be related to dosage of ingested allogeneic cells, in that increasing cell numbers transferred may prolong skin graft survival but may also increase the likelihood of a graft-versus-host reaction. Of note, the suckling rat gut has a higher degree of permeability to whole proteins than that characteristic of the human intestine. Furthermore, clinical experience in immunodeficient neonates has never supported the development of graftversus-host reaction-like disease in the breast-fed human infant. In humans, possible transfer of maternal T cell reactivity to tuberculin protein from the mother to the neonate throu h the process of breast-feeding has been that maternal cellular products or soluble mediators of cellular reactivity may be transferred passively to the neonate through breast-feeding. Admittedly, however, the occurrence of such phenomena in humans has not been studied carefully. Thus, it must be emphasized that at present, evidence to suggest any T cell-mediated immunologic risks associated with breast-feeding in humans is lacking. On the other hand, it is still unknown whether milk T cells, either TCR-aV or TCR-yF, play a role in the transfer of adoptive immunoprotection to the recipient infant. Although the absolute counts in actively nursing mothers exhibit considerable variability between different samples, highest numbers are generally observed during the first 3 to 4 days of lactation. The numbers of neutrophils decrease significantly after 3 to 4 weeks of lactation, and only rare neutrophils are observed in samples collected after 60 to 80 days post partum. Leukocytes in human milk appear to be metabolically activated. Indeed, although the neutrophils are phagocytic and produce toxic oxygen radicals, they do not respond well to chemoattractants by increasing their adherence, polarity, or directed migration in in vitro systems.Im This diminished response was found to be due to prior activation in that the neutrophils in milk displayed a phenotypic pattern that is typical of activated neutrophils.",

Unfortunately, the specific functional role, collectively or individually, for the epithelial cells, monocytes, neutrophils, or lymphocytes in the mammary gland or the milk remains to be defined. In view of the high degree of selectivity and the differences in the quantitative and functional distribution of cellular elements, it is suggested that the mammary gland, like mucosal surfaces, may function somewhat partitioned from the cellular elements in peripheral blood, in a manner similar to that for other peripheral sites (such as the genital tract) of the common mucosal system. It is, however, not known whether the characteristic proportions of macrophages, T lymphocytes, other cytotoxic cells, or epithelial cells are designed for any specific functions localized to the mammary gland in the lactating mother or to epithelium or lumen of the intestinal or respiratory mucosa of the breast-feeding infant, or both. The observations on the transfer of delayed hypersensitivity reactions in human neonates and of graftversus-host reactivity in the rat raise the possibility that milk cells may function as important vehicles in transfer of maternal immunity to neonates. The potential beneficial and harmful roles of such cell-mediated transfer through the mucosal routes, however, need to be investigated further. The paucity of NK and other cytotoxic cells in the colostrum may have a role for the breast-feeding neonate, especially in influencing the antigen processing and uptake of replicating microorganisms and their immune response at systemic or mucosal levels or both. Although colostral cells await further elucidation of their function in the mammary glands and the suckling neonate, it is likely that their presence in the milk represents a highly selective phenomenon and not a mere contamination with peripheral blood cells.",

Secretory IgA is the predominant immunoglobulin in preterm as well as in term milk, although the sIgA concentration appears to be significantly higher in preterm milk collected during the first 8 to 12 weeks of lactation. Secretory IgA antibody activity against certain organisms (E. coli somatic antigen) in the preterm milk was observed to be somewhat less than, or at best similar to, that found in term milk. In addition, the number of lymphocytes and macrophages in milk appears to be lower at 2 weeks but significantly higher at 12 weeks in milk from mothers with preterm (born at 34 to 38 weeks of gestational age) infants than in milk from those with fullterm infants.311 The authors of these investigations have proposed that some of the observed changes may reflect the lower volume of milk produced by mothers delivered of preterm infants.

Beneficial results of breast-feeding as prophylaxis against atopy have been observed in most of the studies; in others, however, beneficial effects were reported only in infants with a genetically determined risk for atopic disease. Finally, no beneficial effect at all or even an increased risk has been suggested in some breast-fed infants. Kramer, in an extensive meta-analysis of 50 studies published before 1986 that focused on infant feeding and atopic disease, has attempted to shed some light on the c o n t r o~e r s y .~~ Seven of the 13 studies on asthma included in this analysis claimed a protective effect of breast-feeding, whereas 6 claimed no protection. Several serious methodologic drawbacks, however, have been noted in this analysis. In a number of the studies analyzed, early infant feeding history was obtained months or years after the feeding period, ascertainment of the infant feeding history was obtained by interviewers who were aware of the disease outcome, or insufficient duration and exclusivity of breast-feeding were documented; all were confounding variables that considered inappropriate \"exposure standards.\" Nonblind ascertainment of disease outcome was found to be the most common violation of the \"outcome standards.\"",

Indeed, the effect of infant feeding on subsequent asthma may be confounded by other variables that are associated both with infant feeding and with unique investigational conditions. Factors that seem to have the greatest potential for confounding effects include the family history of atopic disease, socioeconomic status, and parental cigarette smoking. Only 1 of 13 studies on asthma included in the meta-analysis adequately controlled for these confounding factors. Moreover, 3 of the studies that did not demonstrate a protective effect of breast-feeding on asthma had inadequate statistical power. The effect of infant feeding on the severity of outcome and on the age at onset of the disease was virtually ignored in most of the Although this extensive meta-analysis may suggest some uncertainty about the prophylactic benefit of breast-feeding, two recent studies strongly support a positive effect of breast-feeding on the development of atopic disease and asthma. The first s t u d y consisted of prospective, longterm evaluation from infancy until the age of 17 years; the prevalence of atopy was significantly higher in those infants with short-duration (less than 1 month) or no breast-feeding, which increased to a demonstrable difference by the age of 17 years, than in the infants with intermediate-duration (1 to 6 months) or prolonged (longer than 6 months) breastfeeding. The differences in the prevalence of atopy persisted when the groups were divided according to positive or negative atopic heredity. Furthermore, the atopy manifestations in the different infant feeding groups did not remain constant with age. In particular, respiratory allergy, including asthma, increased greatly in prevalence up to the age of 17 years, with a prevalence as high as 64% in the group with short-duration or no brea~t-feeding.~~~ In the second study, a prospective, longitudinal study of the prevalence and risk factors for acute and chronic respiratory illness in childhood, the investigators examined the relationship of infant feeding to recurrent wheezing at age 6 years and the association with lower respiratory tract illnesses associated with wheezing early in life?45 Children who were never breastfed had significantly higher rates of recurrent wheezing at 6 years of age. Increasing duration of breast-feeding beyond 1 month was not associated with significantly lower rates of recurrent wheezing. The effect of breast-feeding was apparent for children both with and without wheezing lower respiratory tract illnesses in the first 6 months of life. In contrast with the findings of the first study, however, the effect of breast-feeding was significant only among nonatopic children. 345 The exact mechanisms by which breast-feeding seems to confer long-lasting protection against allergic sensitization are poorly understood. It is likely, however, that multiple synergistic mechanisms may be responsible for this effect, including ( 1) maturation of the recipient gastrointestinal and airway mucosa, promoted by growth factors present in human milk242-244; (2) inhibition of antigen absorption by milk s I~A~~~; (3) reduced incidence of mucosal infections and consequent sensitization to bystander antigens347; (4) changes in the microbial flora of the intestine of breast-fed infants325; and (5) direct immunomodulatory activity of human milk components on the recipient A number of earlier and more recent studies have greatly contributed to the understanding of macromolecular transport across the immature gut and its consequences in terms of the generation of circulating antibody or immune complexes, the processes that are blocked predominantly by sIgA, the glycocalyx, and the intestinal enzymes. These mucosal immunologic events have been the basis for the concept of immune exclusion. Immune exclusion is not absolute, however, because uptake of some antigens across the gut may be enhanced rather than blocked by interaction with antibody at the mucosal surface. Beginning with the observations of IgA-deficient patients, it has become clear that the absence of the IgA barrier in the gut is associated with both an increased incidence of circulating antibodies directed against many food antigens and an increased occurrence of atopicallergic diseases.346 Some studies have noted complement activation in serum after feeding of bovine milk to children with cow's milk allergy. The neonate is similar in some respects to the @-deficient patient,348 and increased transintestinal uptake of food antigen with consequent circulating antibody formation in the premature infant has been reported. 349 Other studies have suggested that early breastfeeding, even of short duration, is associated with a decreased serum antibody response to cow's milk proteins.253 Prolonged breast-feeding not only may partially exclude foreign antigens through immune exclusion but may also, because the mother's milk is the infant's sole food, prevent their ingestion.350 It must, however, be emphasized that intact bovine milk proteins and other food antigens and antibodies have been observed in samples of colostrum and milk.6",

The mechanism responsible for this form of jaundice is unknown but has been suggested to reflect inhibitors of glucuronidation, deficiency of related enzymes, excessive lipid breakdown, and insufficient milk intake.363.364 Recent recommendations suggest that a more laissez-faire approach to this problem is appropriate.365 Increasing milk volume by increasing the number of feedings may be the most appropriate approach to breast milk jaundice; however, severe cases may necessitate phototherapy. Increased intake of fluids in breast-feeding infants appears to be effective in many cases. 366 Several instances of specific nutrient deficiencies in breast-fed infants have been described, specifically related to lack of vitamin K, vitamin D, vitamin B,,, folk acid, vitamin C, and carnitine. In each of these instances, several case reports have appeared warning against deficiencies that have resulted in clinical consequences to the neonate. For example, hemorrhagic disease reported in a few breast-fed infants was successfully treated with vitamin K.367 These infants did not receive vitamin K at birth. Mothers who practice unusual dietary habits, such as strict vegetarianism, may have reduced levels of vitamin B,, and folic acid in their milk, and deficiencies in breast-fed infants of such mothers have been reported.3689369 Cases of rickets in breast-fed infants have been reported, particularly during winter among infants not exposed to the sun.32337o Deficiency of carnitine, a nutrient responsible for modulating fat absorption, also has been reported to result in clinical symptoms in breast-fed infants in mothers ingesting unusual d i e t~. h ' -~~'",

Contaminated milk has been implicated in neonatal infection with S. uureus, group B hemolytic streptococci, mycobacteria, and, possibly, Salmonella species (Table 5-10). Mastitis and breast abscess have been associated with the presence of bacterial pathogens in human milk. Such inflammation of the breast will often resolve even with continued breast-feeding. Resolution of the inflammation may be related to the presence of antisecretory factor (AF), a factor induced in the milk by enterotoxin-producing bacteria that appears to promote recovery from acute bacterial mastititis. In general, feeding an infant from a breast affected by an abscess is not recommended.' Infant feeding on the affected breast may be resumed, however, once the mother has received adequate treatment. Furthermore, breastfeeding may continue on the unaffected breast. Mothers with active tuberculosis should refrain from breast-feeding for at least 2 weeks or longer after institution of appropriate treatment if they are considered contagious.' Viral contaminants of maternal origin in the milk include rubella virus, herpes simplex virus, hepatitis B virus (HBV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), HIV-1, human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-l), and, possibly, HTLV-2 (see Table 5 -10).

Epidemiologic evidence to support such an association is lacking, however. Breast-feeding may in fact be a protective factor relative to maternal risk of such neoplastic disease.375 Therefore, with adherence to reasonable maternal hygiene and in the absence of intense chemical contamination, generally few proven or well-defined contraindications to natural breast-feeding exist.

            "text": "Human Immunodeficiency Virus Infection. Recently, serious concern has been voiced regarding the potential risk of the transmission of HIV from infected mothers to their suckling neonates through the process of breast-feeding. The possibility of postnatal transmission of this virus from mother to child has been considered in a large number of infants breast-fed in the United States and in other parts of the world. In some of these infants, breast-feeding has been implicated as one of the major risk factors for acquisition of HIV infection. Since 1985, small but significant numbers of infants with HIV infection possibly acquired through the process of breast-feeding have been reported. 376 In virtually all reported cases, maternal seroconversion for HIV antibody probably occurred after delivery of the infant. More than 50% of these mothers acquired the infection through heterosexual transmission, and about 30% through blood transfusion. Few of the mothers were judged to be intravenous drug users, Although acquisition of HIV infection before delivery cannot be ruled out with certainty, the likely route of transmission in these infants has been presumed t o be through breast-feeding. The most convincing observations are based on several maternal-infant pairs in whom maternal seroconversion to HIV antibody occurred 4 months or longer after delivery.377",

            "text": "A number of studies have demonstrated HIV in milk.378-382 The findings include isolation of HIV from milk supernatants collected from symptom-free women and from cellular fractions of maternal milk, recovery of HIV virions in the histiocytes and cell-free extracts of milk by electron microscopy, and detection of viral DNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay in greater than 70% of samples from HIV-seropositive lactating women. Limited epidemiologic studies carried out to date, however, have failed to demonstrate the magnitude of risk of HIV infection in breast-fed infants. Cohort st~dies''~ in different populations have suggested increased, reduced, or similar transmission rates in breast-feeding and in non-breast-feeding (bottle-feeding) infants of seropositive mothers ( Table 5-11) . Thus, it appears that although precise epidemiologic data are still lacking, a majority of breast-fed infants born to HIV-seropositive mothers remain uninfected despite the presence of HTV DNA in the milk in a high proportion of such mothers. Nevertheless, the risk of acquisition of HIV infection through breast-feeding must not be ignored. On the basis of meta-analysis of available data, it has been estimated that the additional risk of HIV infection through breast-feeding may be as high as 22%. 384 Some studies have suggested that breastfeeding contributes up to a 50% increase in the overall vertical transmission of HIV infection. 385 Despite the potential risk of HIV infection in infants of HIV-infected breast-feeding mothers, consideration of cessation of breast-feeding must be balanced against other beneficial effects as outlined in this chapter. In a 1990 study, breast-fed HIV-infected children progressed to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) at a slower rate than that noted for bottle-fed ~hildren.\"~ Current estimates indicate the overall risk of acquiring HIV infection from breast-feeding to be about 16%. Of all HIV-infected infants, 47% may be infected by means of breast-feeding. Among those breast-fed for 3 months or longer, the rate of infection was estimated to be approximately 21%, and among those breast-fed for 2 months or less, the rate of infection was approximately 13%.' It is, however, important to realize that a number of other risk factors contribute to the increased transfer of HIV through breast-feeding. Associated maternal factors include younger age, multiple deliveries, high virus load, lower number of CD4+ lymphocytes, and maternal mastitis. Other risk factors associated with the maternal milk include high viral load in the milk, long duration of breast-feeding, especially mixed formula feeding and breast-feeding, low levels of antiviral factor in the milk (low CTL, sIgA, lactoferrin, lysozyme). Evidence of oral candidiasis in the breast-feeding neonate also appears to be a risk factor for development of breastfeeding-associated HIV infection. ' Current recommendations from the American Academy of Pediatrics state that in populations such as that of the United States, in which the risk of death from infectious diseases and malnutrition is low and in which safe and effective alternative sources of feeding are readily available, HIV-infected women should be counseled not to breast-feed their infants nor to donate milk. All pregnant women in the United States should be counseled and encouraged to be tested for HIV infection. Data are not available about the safety of breast-feeding by mothers receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). In geographic areas in which infectious diseases and malnutrition are important causes of death early in life, the feeding decision may be more complex. The World Health Organization (WHO) states that if a mother is infected with HIV, replacement of human milk to decrease the risk of HIV transmission may be preferable to breast-feeding, provided that the risk associated with replacement feeding is less than the potential risk of HIV transmission. Implementation of this suggestion has many obstacles. The WHO policy stresses the need for continued support for breast-feeding by mothers who are HIV negative or of unknown HIV serostatus, improved access to HIV counseling and testing, and government efforts to ensure uninterrupted access to nutritionally adequate human milk substitutes.'",

Clinical observations have demonstrated that milk antibodies protect against a large number of intestinal pathogens such as Campylobacter, Shigella, E. coli, V cholerae, Giardia, rotavirus, and respiratory pathogens such as respiratory syncytial virus. The milk antibodies also effectively neutralize toxins and a variety of human viruses. The role of small amounts of IgG and IgM in milk has not been fully examined. Recently, it has been suggested that milk IgG may hydrolyze nucleotides and DNA.40' In general, milk IgA antibodies induce antimicrobial protection in the absence of any inflammation, a characteristic of other complement-binding immunoglobulins such as IgG and IgM.",

It is possible that their primary task is the defense of the mammary gland itself. The lymphocytes present in the milk transfer immunologic information and may offer significant T cell-mediated immunologic defense to the suckling neonate. Breast-fed infants seem to become tolerant to their mothers' HLA, which may have important implications regarding immune responsiveness and allograft rejection. 402 Lactoferrin, a major milk protein, also may play an important role in antimicrobial defense. It can kill bacteria, fungi, and viruses without causing inflammation. Lactoferrin also has been found to block mechanisms that result in the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-a, IL-6, IL-1 p) by inhibiting nuclear transcription factor (NFKP) activation me~hanisms.4~~",

Such complexes, referred to as human a-lactalbumin made lethal to tumor cells (HAMLET), induce apoptosis of all malignant cells tested to date. These complexes have remarkably little to no effect on normal cells. 4049405 Additional recent studies have suggested that milk contains large numbers of cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors. Although their precise role in the milk remains to be determined, some of these may act as signals for recruitment of pro-inflammatory and or immunoregulatory cells to the mucosal sites. TGF-P may be important in downregulating immune response and induction of tolerance, thereby decreasing the risk of allergic disease. IL-7 may promote development of a yS T cell population in cryptopatches which are small aggregates of lymphocytes in the intestinal crypts, and in the maintenance of thymus It also has been shown that increased levels of IL-1 b, TNF-a, IL-6, and possibly other cytokines increase the level of leptin, an appetite-regulating hormone that is present in significant quantities in mammary epithelial cells, milk fat globules, and milk.407*406 Leptin has several immunologic effects, including differentiation and proliferation of hematopoietic cells and regulation of monocyte-macrophage function. It also influences T cell response by enhancing IL-2 and IFN-y production (for TH1 cells) and IL-4 and IL-10 production (for TH2 cells). Leptin is absorbed by the breast-feeding infant408.409 and may be associated with prevention of obesity observed in breast-fed infants.",

Nevertheless, the passive transfer of the diversity of maternal biologic experiences to the neonate through the process of breast-feeding represents an essential component of the survival mechanism in the mammalian neonate. For millions of years, maternal products of lactation delivered through the process of breast-feeding have been the sole source of nutrition and immunity during the neonatal period and early infancy for all mammals, including the human infant. During the past 150 to 300 years, however, the human societal culture has undergone remarkable changes in rapid succession, which have had a major impact on the basic mechanisms of maternal-neonatal interaction and breast-feeding. Such changes include introduction of sanitation and nonhuman milk and formula feeds for neonatal nutrition, use of antimicrobial agents, introduction of processed foods, and exposure to newer environmental macromolecules and dietary antigens. The introduction of such manmade changes in the neonatal environment has had a profound impact on human homeostatic mechanisms and at the same time allowed new insights into the role of breast-feeding in the developing human neonate.",

Newer evidence suggests a protective role of breast-feeding in modulating many respiratory, intestinal, and urinary tract infections, otitis media, and NEC in the neonate. This information has been recently reviewed by Hanson in an elegant m0nograph.4'~ Despite the overwhelmingly protective role attributed to natural breast-feeding and the evolutionary advantages related to the development of lactation, several infectious agents have acquired, during the course of evolution, the ability to evade immunologic factors in milk and to use milk as the vehicle for maternal-to-infant transmission. The potential for the acquisition of infections such as those due to HIV, HTLV, CMV, and possibly other pathogens highlights potential hazards of breast-feeding in some clinical situations. Thus, it is reasonable to conclude that the development of lactation, the hallmark of mammalian evolution, is designed to enhance the survival of the neonate of the species, and that breast-feeding may have a remarkable spectrum of immediate and long-term protective functions.

HistochemicaUy, the milk macrophage differs from the blood monocyte in demonstrating decreased peroxidase staining, with increased lysosomes and significant amounts of immunoglobulin, especially IgA, in the cytoplasm.'27-'29 The intracellular immunoglobulin in macrophages represents up to 10% of mdk Kinetic studies on the release of IgA by human milk macrophages suggest that immunoglobulin release by macrophages, unlike that by other phagocytic cells, is a time-dependent phenomenon and is not significantly influenced by the use of secretagogues or stimulants, such as phorbol myristate acetate.I3' Active phagocytosis, however, is associated with significant increase Lymphocytes. Milk contains a small number of lymphocytes, 80% of which are T cells and 4% to 6% of which are B cells.Iz6 The small number of B cells reflects the sessile nature of these cells, which enter the lamina propria of the mammary gland to transform into plasma cells. Although several investigators have been unable to show in vitro antibody synthesis by milk lymphocytes, studies performed with colostral B cells transformed by Epstein-Barr virus have shown production of IgG, as well as J-chain-containing IgM and IgA.I4' A small population of CD16' natural killer (NK) cells also can be identified in most milk samples but cannot be accurately quantitated.'26 In functional studies, however, colostral cells exhibit NK cytotoxicity, which is enhanced by interferon and IL-2.",
