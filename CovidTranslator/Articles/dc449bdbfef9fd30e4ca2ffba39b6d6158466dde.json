We used Kulldorff's space-time scan statistical analysis to detect the space-time clusters of SARS and COVID-19 and to verify whether the geographic clustering was caused by random variation. Considering the relatively low incidence rate, we used the discrete Poisson probability model as the scanning statistical model. In Kulldorff's space-time scanning, the radius of the population coverage was used, and the maximum spatial scanning area was set to cover 10% of the risk population. The maximum temporal scanning window was set to cover 50% of the total research time. The scan window was increased gradually from 0 to the maximum, and the log-likelihood ratios (LLRs) were calculated for each window. The window with the maximum likelihood was defined as the most likely cluster area. Other clusters with statistically significant LLRs were defined as the secondary potential clusters. The LLR P-value was estimated through 99,999 Monte Carlo simulations. A P-value < 0.05 indicated a significantly high risk inside of the scan window and a potential high-risk cluster of the disease.

This could be explained by the relatively high infection rate nationally, as well as the different demographic factors and local government containment strategies regionally.
