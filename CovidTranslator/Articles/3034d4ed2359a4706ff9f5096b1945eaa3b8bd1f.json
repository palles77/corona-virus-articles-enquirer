We used the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) Statement 3 to guide the reporting of our rapid overview results; a PRISMA extension for rapid reviews and a reporting guideline on overviews are currently under development.

            "text": "Overall Conclusions chemoprophylaxis for non-ill residents exposed during outbreaks.Oseltamivir, zanamivir and peramivir were the antivirals recommended for the 2017-2018 season. Oseltamivir has been the prescribed antiviral in LTC despite mixed reports of effectiveness in residents. Treatment should begin within 48 hours of symptom onset or exposure. Oseltamivir dosage should be decreased for patients with creatinine clearance less than 60 mL/minute and it's not recommended for end stage renal disease patients not on dialysis. The most common oseltamivir prophylaxis/treatment ADRs reported were nausea, vomiting, headache and pain but neuropsychiatric ADRs of hallucinations, abnormal behavior, confused state, and delirium have occurred, resulting in discontinuation in some cases. Of 10,218 cumulative ADRs reported to the FDA, 2,412 were psychiatric and 2,019 were nervous system; 12% of the cumulative reports involved patients aged 65 and older medication in a timely manner, providing information regarding oseltamivir benefits/risks and dosages, identifying potential ADRs, and suggesting discontinuation when warranted Rainwater-Lovett, 2014; AMSTAR Rating: High, Condition: Influenza Individuals in facilities where chemoprophylaxis was used were significantly less likely to develop influenza A or B than those in facilities with no interventions [odds ratio (OR) 0.48, 95% CI: 0.28, 0.84]. Considered by drug class, amantadine significantly reduced infection risk (OR 0.22, 95% CI: 0.12, 0.42), while neuraminidase inhibitors did not show a significant effect. Although NPI showed no significant effect, the results suggest that personal protective equipment may produce modest protective effects. After adjusting for NPI, use of any antiviral drug halved attack rates among outbreaks consisting of influenza A cases [OR: 0 52 (95% CI: 0.29, 0 93)] and influenza A and B cases [OR: 0 48 (95% CI: 0 28, 0 84)] compared with outbreaks that did not implement influenza control measures. More specifically, the use of amantadine produced statistically significant protective effects among outbreaks with cases of influenza A [OR: 0 33 (95% CI: 0 17, 0 62)] and influenza This analysis provides further evidence that antiviral prophylaxis is one of the most effective ways to control influenza in populations at high risk of complications and where vaccine efficacy is reduced. While antiviral prophylaxis is highly effective, it may fail in the face of a novel, resistant strain. In such a scenario, NPI will be our only option for control and the importance of understanding which measures are most effective, and how effective they are, is paramount. Antiviral prophylaxis significantly reduced influenza attack rates, reducing the odds of developing influenza by 50% among LTCF residents. While our results were consistent with a protective effect of PPE, this effect was not statistically significant. We suspect the lack of statistically significant protective effects of PPE and social distancing was the result of broad definitions as NPI were rarely reported in detail Whereas there were multiple publications related to the difficulties and risk factors LTCFs face in disasters, there were no publications that specifically addressed infection prevention in disasters or planning specific to infection prevention concerns in disasters in long-term care. All health care settings need to have comprehensive emergency operations plans that address all hazards. LTCFs have unique challenges not experienced by other health care settings, and these issues need to be addressed as part of facility emergency management planning. Protocols need to be in place that will minimize infection transmission risk among patients, visitors, and staff during disasters. This article summarizes disaster planning considerations related to infection prevention for LTCFs, including having an infection prevention program, developing and assessing an emergency operations plan that is coordinated with regional and federal plans, creating and implementing an infection prevention education program related to disaster preparedness, and managing supplies. LTCFs should use this article to develop and assess their EOP and staff training as it relates to infection prevention procedures and protocols.",
