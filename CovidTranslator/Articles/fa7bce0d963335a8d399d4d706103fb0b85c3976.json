Cases have also been documented in a growing number of other international locations, including the United States ( https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html ). As a consequence, it is urgent to develop effective measures to control this novel coronavirus on the basis of its pathogenesis.",

During the time of this letter preparation, three works have just been published to explore the receptor usage of 2019-nCoV. A work by Zheng-Li Shi et al. has shown that angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), 3 from human, Rhinolophus sinicus bat, civet, swine but not mouse mediate 2019-nCoV infection in vitro , while the detailed mechanisms are not yet determined. 4 The other two works have reported or predicted human ACE2 usage of 2019-nCoV in a similar way to SARS-CoV mainly based on the coronavirus spike (S) glycoproteins. 5 , 6 Considering the fact that the S proteins mutate and gain capability to recognize host receptors among species, 7 , 8 there is still a lack of analyses on receptor usage of 2019-nCoV from the receptor perspective, which does not evolve as quickly as viruses.",

            "text": "Here, we firstly performed amino acid sequence alignment of ACE2 from different species, including human, five non-human primates (gibbon, green monkey, macaque, orangutan and chimpanzee), two companion animals (cat and dog), six domestic animals (bovine, sheep, goat, swine, horse and chicken), three wild animals (ferret, civet and Chinese horseshoe bat) and two rodents (mouse and rat). The alignment by Clustal W 2.1 shows that they share a high sequence similarity except chicken (data not shown). The result suggests that 2019-nCoV of probable bat origin may not interact with chicken ACE2 and subsequently infect them, which were not considered in the following analyses. In ACE2, the regions at position 30-41, 82-84 and 353-357 are demonstrated to be involved in the interaction with SARS-CoV S protein, where the residues at positions 31, 35, 38, 82 and 353 are critical. 9 Therefore, we took a close comparison in these regions and residues. As shown in Fig. 1 , human and non-human primates share the identity sequences in the regions and residues, implying that ACE2 from non-human primates may recognize 2019-nCoV and medi-ate its infection. As a result, non-human primates may be susceptible to 2019-nCoV and serve as animal models for antiviral research or intermediate hosts for cross-species transmission. In Fig.  1 , the residues of most companion, domestic and wild animals are conserved, especially for the critical ones stated above, while certain ones are variable. For example, Lys31, Glu35, Asp/Glu38 and Lys353 are conserved, which probably form salt bridges. Interestingly, the changes at positions 31, 38 and 82 are observed. These changes suggest steric hindrance and electrostatic interference for host-virus interaction. Taking civet ACE2 as an example, the change of Lys31 to Thr31 is likely to form a hydrogen bond instead of a salt bridge. In addition, the polar side chain of Thr82 may influence the hydrophobic interaction of the original Met82. All these changes may result in a lower binding affinity. However, an additional region covering residues 90-93 has been shown to be involved in civet ACE2 binding to SARS-CoV and enhance their interaction. 10 Consequently, we can't preclude the existence of other regions to compensate for the residue changes. With most residues in human ACE2, the ones from these compaion, domestic and wild animals may be favorable for 2019-nCoV recognition, which is in consistent with the recent work by Zheng-Li Shi et al. In case cross-species transmission, close contact with sick or asymptomatic companion, domestic and wild animals should be cautious, such as for workers in livestock farming and travellers in the wild.",

The Asn31 and Ser82 in mouse ACE2 may not form favorable interactions with 2019-nCoV due to their electrostatic or hydrophilic characteristics. Importantly, the change into His353 in both mouse and rat ACE2 does not form a strong salt bridge as Lys353 does. Since the structural information for mouse and rat ACE2 is unavailable, we carried out homology modeling using human ACE2 (PDB code 2AJF) as template on online ( https://swissmodel.expasy.org ) for further analyses. In Fig. 2 A, the change into Ser82 in mouse ACE2 may interfere with the hydrophobic interaction of the original Met82. Additionally, the changes into Asn31 and His353 definitely affect the salt bridge formation and electrostatic potential. The change into His353 in rat ACE2 is similar in the effect on receptor-virus interaction ( Fig. 2 B) . These analyses partially explain why mouse ACE2 does not mediate 2019-nCoV infection reported by Zheng-Li Shi et al. and assume that rodents are not likely to be the susceptible host.",
