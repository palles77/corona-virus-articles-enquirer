            "text": "Tuberculosis (TB) is caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which is a slow-growing, acid-fast bacillus. It is the second most common cause of infectious disease-related deaths worldwide, after HIV/AIDS [6] , with 8.8 million incident cases per year and 1.7 million deaths per year [7] . In the United States, the disease burden is lower but still significant, with approximately 15 million people infected overall [8] . Although public health preventive measures over the past decade have resulted in a favorable trend in the incidence of TB in the United States (with a peak of 10.5 cases per 100,000 in 1992, to 5.1 cases per 100,000 in 2003), rates of decline have recently slowed [8] . This slowing in the rate of decline, along with the recent emergence of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDRTB) [9] , makes this disease one of the leading public health threats to our nation. TB is spread by tiny 1-to 5-mm airborne droplet nuclei, which can remain airborne for hours after expectoration caused by coughing, sneezing, or talking. The infectious nuclei are inhaled and lodge in the distal alveoli where host defenses are activated. A variety of potential subsequent events follow, based on pathogen load and host responsiveness. In most cases, cell-mediated immunity results in immediate destruction of the organism. In some cases, however, initial infection is established when the organism is transported to regional lymph nodes. Here, further cell-mediated immune response results in containment of infection, or in those with less-effective immune systems, development of immediate disease (ie, primary active TB). For the majority of infected individuals who successfully contain the infection, bacteria remain contained in granulomas or tubercles where replication of the organism is limited. This latent infectious state generally lasts for the life of the infected patient. In others, reactivation of infection occurs when the host's immune response is no longer capable of containment. Those at highest risk for reactivation include the very young, the elderly, and patients with chronic immunocompromising diseases, particularly HIV [10] . For immunocompetent individuals, the overall lifetime risk of reactivation of TB is 10%; for those with HIV the risk of reactivation is significantly higher, estimated to be about 7% per year.",

Furthermore, only 36% of patients reported any pulmonary complaints at triage [12] . TB can involve nearly every organ system but the most common extrapulmonary sites infected are the lymph nodes, central nervous system (CNS), bones, and joints. CNS presentations are usually subacute with findings including indolent headache, fever, and occasionally altered mental status. Although TB can affect nearly every joint, the spine is the most commonly affected site (Pott's disease). Disseminated TB can involve multiple organ systems, including the lungs.

A presumptive diagnosis of TB can be made by Ziehl-Neelson staining, which identifies acid-fast bacilli; sensitivity of this method is only 50% to 80%, however, and requires obtaining multiple positive sputum samples for confirmation. New laboratory-based molecular diagnostics such as polymerase chain reaction hold promise for rapid definitive diagnosis, but are not yet accepted as routine for clinical decision making [13] . Chest radiographs should be obtained on patients with suspected TB. Classic radiographic findings are upper-lobe infiltrates, cavitary infiltrates, and hilar or paratracheal adenopathy. It is critical to keep in mind, however, that radiographic findings with TB are highly variable, with atypical findings more common in those with immunosuppressive states, such as advanced HIV [14] .",

As described above, those groups at highest risk for TB (eg, the homeless, the uninsured, immigrants, IDUs, and HIV/AIDS patients) often use the ED as their principal or sole site of care [18] [19] [20] . Busy inner-city waiting rooms and overcrowded conditions with long wait times and lack of adequate isolation rooms and personal protective equipment further contribute to the potential spread of TB [21] . One recent retrospective study from an urban teaching hospital found that 44 active TB patients made 66 contagious ED visits over a 30-month period that went unrecognized before diagnosis [12] ; a similar retrospective study found that nearly 50% of newly diagnosed TB cases had an antecedent visit within 6 months of diagnosis [22] . Several studies from high-risk urban EDs have demonstrated delayed disease recognition with reports of lengthy ED stays (median 13 hours) [23] , and significant delays in time to isolation (median time of 8 hours from triage to isolation) [24] .",

Risk of TB infection significantly increases when clinical procedures that produce large amounts of aerosol are performed, such as induced sputum or intubation [26] . ED staff reportedly have PPD conversion rates up to six times higher than other hospital workers, with rates of conversion ranging from 1% to 12% [27] .

PPE involves routine use of the N-95 particulate respirator for HCWs who are in close contact with suspected cases. Several studies conducted since 1994 have demonstrated that adherence to these guidelines significantly increases identification of cases and reduces disease transmission in HCWs [16, 23] . For example, the introduction of TB control measures including engineering upgrades and improved access to PPE in one inner-city ED resulted in a nearly sixfold diminution in PPD conversion among HCWs [16] . Similar administrative and facilities improvement in another high-risk ED resulted in decreased wait times and increased rates of appropriate isolation for ED patients with suspected TB [23] .",

Explanations for the relatively low sensitivity of the tool included lack of consistent compliance with guideline implementation and failure of a subset of patients to report key risk factors and symptoms at ED triage (which were elicited later during the ED evaluation). An alternate TB screening tool that was retrospectively derived from a population of culture-positive cases had a much higher sensitivity (96%) [31] . The final decision instrument involved assigning a 1-point score to each of several variables (abnormal chest x-ray, temperature greater than 101 F, homeless/shelter dwelling, and TB history), with a positive screen assigned to any patient with more than 2 points. The principal limitation of this method, which restricts applicability for triage decision making, is the need for chest radiographic findings to assign a score. However, the tool may be appropriate for determining need for isolation.",

''Antigenic drift'' is produced by point mutations in the viral antigen that occur during viral replication and result in slightly different, new strains of influenza for which there is diminished immunologic recognition. ''Antigenic shift'' is a sudden major change in the surface peptides that occurs when two different strains of influenza infect the same individual simultaneously.

The value of diagnostic testing has been well described and includes limiting use of unnecessary antibiotics, more specific use of antivirals, identification of atypical cases of disease, decreased length of ED stay, and improved surveillance by local and state health departments regarding presence, subtype, and strain of influenza [47, 49] . Clinical data supporting routine testing is more compelling in children than adults [50, 51] , although testing is advised by the CDC during suspected influenza outbreaks as part of the broader surveillance and public health strategy aimed at controlling the spread of disease in a health care facility. Laboratory tests currently available include rapid antigen testing, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), immunofluorescence, serology, and viral culture from various types of respiratory specimens (nasopharyngeal swab, throat swab, nasal wash, nasal aspirate, sputum, and bronchial wash) or serum. Commercially available rapid tests can provide results in the ED within 30 minutes. Performance characteristics of the tests are variable, but generally sensitivity is greater than 70% and specificity is greater than 90%. The CDC recognizes the limited sensitivity of the rapid test and recommends that samples should always be sent for viral culture, which is considered gold standard confirmation with viral culture [45] .",

Over the next several months, a surge in cases of pneumonia were reported in the surrounding regions, with a disproportionate number of hospital workers affected and several unexpected deaths [72] . Months 1. Ensure that emergency care and critical providers, including emergency medical services (EMS) personnel, nurses, and ancillary staff involved in direct patient care, are immunized against influenza. 2. Implement rapid screening, identification, and appropriate respiratory infection control interventions for all individuals arriving in the ED. 3. End the practice of boarding admitted patients in the ED when no inpatient beds are available. Hospitals operating at full capacity may be required to distribute boarded patients to inpatient hallways, solariums, admission units, and other spaces outside the ED, but this practice is preferable to packing seriously ill influenza patients together in the hallways of an ED. 4. Implement regional protocols to monitor hospital inpatient and ED capacity, as well as ambulance diversion status. 5. Adopt regional protocols to govern when, how, why, and for how long crowded hospital Eds can divert inbound ambulances. 6. Require hospitals and communities that are severely affected by influenza to postpone elective admissions until the crisis abates. 7. Provide federal and state emergency funding to compensate hospitals and EDs for the unreimbursed costs of meeting this grave public health challenge. after the initial case of this atypical pneumonia, a physician from Guangdong traveled to Hong Kong, infecting up to 16 others during a brief hotel stay. This triggered a global pandemic with outbreaks in Hong Kong, Singapore, Vietnam, and Canada [73, 74] . In spite of early evidence that these illnesses represented an emerging infectious disease (based on number of cases, lack of responsiveness to standard therapy, and high transmissibility), hospitals were generally slow to implement respiratory isolation procedures. It was not until several hundred more cases were reported that the World Health Organization (WHO) issued a global health alert, resulting in establishment of an international laboratory reporting network and standardized protocols for infection containment [75] . These measures contributed to the definitive identification of SARS (a novel previously uncharacterized Coronavirus) as the causative pathogen [73, 76] .",

One study that tracked 322 SARS patients in Beijing, China, found that of all heath care workers, ED staff had the highest attack rate (11.9%) [95] . Another detailed epidemiologic investigation from Toronto found that transmission of SARS to ED staff who had contact with SARS patients ranged from 0% to 22%, with a calculated attack rate of 13.6 per 1000 nursing hours, exceeding that found in the ICU [94] . Factors believed to contribute to the high rates of contagion in the ED included difficulty with early identification and isolation of patients (particularly those with atypical symptoms), use of aerosol treatments for patients with respiratory symptoms in the ED, and poor compliance with basic (ie, hand washing) and other recognized public health control measures for reducing transmission of respiratory infections [96] .

SARS was found to be spread principally by the respiratory droplet route, making PPE use the mainstay of infection control. While use of N95 masks offers theoretical advantages over surgical masks, no studies have documented significant additional benefits in patient care settings. Importantly, consistent compliance with PPE has been proven to decrease risk of disease transmission. Indirect evidence from ''super-spreading'' events in hospitals has suggested that SARS may be aerosolized [101, 102] . Infectious disease experts advise that special care should be taken to decrease aerosol-generating procedures as much as possible and to observe additional precautions when these procedures are necessary. Recommended environmental interventions include placing surgical masks on patients with suspected SARS at triage and during transport, limiting the movement of patients with suspected SARS, and making use of physical isolation measures, including warding and use of negative-pressure isolation rooms when available [103] . Successful policies for containment of SARS in EDs demand strict attention and enforcement of ED operational protocols (including procedures for recycling of supplies and equipment, and guidelines for optimization of patient and staff traffic) [97] . The SARS outbreak exemplified the need for modified ED staffing owing to the increased demands of patient care that occurred during the period of the greatest disease threat and burden [98] .",

The scores were reported to have greater than 90% sensitivity and were found to be highly reliable when validated in a separate cohort [105, 107] . A more recent study from Hong Kong, which included nearly one third of the SARS cases from 2003, reported similar results with key variables including exposure history, symptoms, and laboratory values [104] . Although determination of which prediction rule will be most effective is not known, these studies provide compelling support for integration of ED-based decision guidelines in future respiratory outbreaks. Potential gains include early identification and isolation of high-risk patients, reduction of disease transmission in the ED, and optimization of use of limited resources. Principal limitations of these decision tools include lack of proven reliability in nonendemic areas and the need for validation with each new outbreak, based on potential strain and geographic variation that may alter clinical presentation.",

Category A agents, which can be easily aerosolized for weaponization, include inhalational anthrax, pneumonic plague, inhalational tularemia, and viral hemorrhagic fever. Only a subset of these agents, specifically Y pestis and the viral hemorrhagic fever viruses, have the potential for secondary human-to-human spread through respiratory droplets or airborne transmission. Of note, despite its general lack of prominent respiratory symptoms, smallpox can also be highly contagious via droplet or airborne transmission of the virus. Other significant aerosolizable category B agents with pulmonary manifestations include Coxiella burnetti (Q fever), Brucella species (brucellosis), and Burkholderia mallei (glanders); however, only B mallei has the potential for human-to-human transmission. From the ED perspective, it is critical that patients who are suspected to be infected with such communicable agents be cared for in respiratory isolation for disease containment. Need for isolation should be determined by suspicion before definitive diagnosis.

About half of these deaths occurred in Africa, in which fewer than 50% of children aged 1 year have received at least one dose of measles vaccine. Factors that contribute to the high case-fatality rates in developing countries include crowding, poor nutritional state, occurrence of infection at young age, underlying immune deficiency disorders, and limited access to health care. In 2001, the WHO and United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) established the goal of reducing measles deaths by 50% by 2005 (compared with 1999 estimates) through mass vaccination campaigns worldwide [124] . As a result, global measles mortality decreased by 39% between 1999 and 2003, with the largest gains (46%) occurring in the African regions [125] . In the United States, routine measles vaccination has been part of a childhood immunization program since 1963, resulting in a downward trend in the incidence of disease. However, resurgence occurred between 1989 and 1991 because of low vaccination coverage. Since 1997, the incidence of measles in the United States has been sustained at record low levels of approximately 100 cases per year [126] . Unfortunately, efforts toward measles eradication in the US have been challenged by the continued high prevalence of measles outside our borders, as evidenced by identification of imported viral genotypes among the majority of incident US cases [127] . Efforts to ensure high immunization rates among people in both developed and developing countries must be sustained to control measles worldwide.",

It has only one serotype and can, therefore, be prevented with a single monovalent vaccine. Measles vaccine is one of the safest and most effective of all vaccines [133] . It is a live attenuated vaccine, which is frequently given in a combined product with rubella vaccine (as MR vaccine) or with rubella and mumps vaccine (as MMR vaccine). Immunization produces a nontransmissible, asymptomatic infection. Approximately 5% of children who receive only one dose of MMR vaccine will remain susceptible owing to primary vaccine failure, but after a second immunization, more than 99% of vaccinees develop serologic evidence of measles immunity, which can be lifelong [134] . Recent experience has demonstrated that prevention of endemic outbreaks with single-dose vaccination is not possible even with high vaccination coverage, a two-dose vaccine schedule is thus recommended [135] . The first dose of MMR should be given on or after a child's first birthday, and the second dose may be given as soon as 1 month after the first, but should routinely be given at age 4 to 6 years. Postexposure prophylaxis with vaccination within 72 hours or passive immunization within 6 days of exposure should be given to susceptible contacts (ie, persons exposed and not fully vaccinated). All health care workers are at high risk for exposure and should be adequately vaccinated.",

Several studies have evaluated EDs as potential sites for routine vaccination and for accelerated vaccine delivery during outbreaks, with limited success [136, 137] . Major barriers with measles vaccination have included high costs, lack of continuity, and difficulty in determining the true immunization status of patients [138, 139] . Until these barriers are effectively addressed, ED providers can contribute to measles control by screening and referring underimmunized children to private or public health clinics in the community for vaccination. As with all emerging or reemerging infectious diseases, ED-based surveillance (which relies on early recognition and reporting of suspected cases) plays a key role in outbreak control.",
