This distinctive rash was observed 4-5 days after fever onset, just before defervescence. Elevated aspartate aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase, and ferritin levels were characteristic laboratory findings in the 2 cases, suggesting tissue damage caused by hypercytokinemia. Case 1 was treated with intravenous immunoglobulin, considering the possibility of severe systemic inflammatory responses. The initial ferritin level was 385 ng/mL (range, 0-400 ng/mL); however, the level increased to 2,581 ng/dL on day 5 after fever onset. Case 2 presented with milder clinical symptoms, and the patient recovered spontaneously. HPeV-3 was detected in cerebrospinal fluid and/or blood samples, but no other causative agents were detected. The findings from our cases, in accordance with recent studies, suggest that clinical features such as palmarplantar erythema and/or hyperferritinemia might be indicators of HPeV-3 infection in neonates with sepsis-like illness. In clinical practice, where virology testing is not easily accessible, clinical features such as palmar-plantar erythema and/or hyperferritinemia might be helpful to diagnose HPeV-3 infection.",

Associations between this virus and severe diseases such as sepsis-like illness and meningoencephalitis in neonates and young infants have been widely described 3) . However, the principle features of sepsis-like conditions are also common in severe infectious diseases caused by other pathogens, particularly enteroviruses. A prospective study showed that it was not possible to distinguish neonatal HPeV infection (most are HPeV-3) from enterovirus infection on the basis of clinical signs 5) . Although an association between a distinctive pattern of white matter injury and HPeV-3 encephalitis has been suggested 10) , this pattern is also seen in enterovirus meningoencephalitis 11) . PCR is commonly used to diagnose viral infections; however, PCR for HPeV-3 is not commercially available 6) . Thus, the diagnosis of HPeV-3 infection is difficult in current clinical practice. In Korea, only a few studies have been conducted on clinical features of HPeV-3 infection 9) .",

Although a rash was known to frequently accompany HPeV-3 infection 2) , the characteristics of the rash attracted little attention as a diagnostic clue. Recent studies have described distinctive palmar-plantar erythema or reddening of skin rashes in neonates and infants with an HPeV-3 infection 4, 7) . As observed in our study, the characteristic rash is erythematous and limited to the palms and soles 4, 7) . Yuzurihara et al. 4) reported nine neonates and infants with HPeV-3 infection. The median age of onset in the patients was 31 days 4) . In 5 of 9 patients (55%), palmar-plantar reddening appeared on day 3 after fever onset, on average, and fever persisted for 3-5 days (median, 4 days) 4) . Shoji et al. 7) also reported palmarplantar erythema in 12 of 15 neonates (80%) and young infants with an HPeV-3 infection. The median age of onset was 33 days (range, 10-81 days) 7) . Fever persisted for a median of 3 days (range, 1-4 days), and the distinctive skin rash developed at a mean of 3 days (range, 1-5 days) after fever onset 7) . In our cases, the rash developed at 4-5 days after fever onset. Thus, palmarplantar erythema or reddening seemed to develop just before defervescence, approximately 3-5 days after fever onset. This pattern of fever and rash is also seen in exanthema subitum caused by human herpes virus (HHV)-6 12) . HHV-6 viremia can be detected during the febrile period (after 2 days of illness, before the onset of the rash), and anti-HHV-6 antibodies are first detected around the time of the rash onset (3 days of illness) 12) . The rash in exanthema subitum is thought to result from antigen-antibody complexes 12) . A similar pathogenic mechanism of exanthem subitum might function in the rash observed with HPeV-3 infection. If so, palmarplantar erythema might be a sign of clinical improvement in patients with an HPeV-3 infection. Or, microvascular endothelial cells of the palms and soles might be susceptible to this virus. Compared with other HPeVs, HPeV-3 is known to use a different receptor to enter cells 2) . However, there are no studies about immediate antibody responses after HPeV-3 infection as well as susceptibility of this virus to microvascular endothelial cells of the palm and soles. The pathogenesis of the distinctive rash in HPeV-3 infection is still unknown.",

Ferritin levels were high on days 4-5 after fever onset 6) , consistent with the time of defervescence. That study also found that the WBC and platelet counts were significantly lower in HPeV-3 infection than in other infections 6) . Yuzurihara et al. 4) also showed high level of ferritin (median, 2,307 ng/mL) and LDH (median, 643 U/L) in neonates with HPeV-3 infection. Hyperferritinemia, cytopenia, and/or high LDH are assumed to reflect hypercytokinemia 6) . Based on these findings, they suggested HPeV-3 infection should be considered possible causes of hypercytokinemia 4, 6) . The laboratory findings in our 2 cases were similar to the previous studies 4, 6) and characterized by elevated markers of tissue injury, including AST, LDH, and ferritin. Prolonged fever over than 5 days was observed in both 2 cases. Thus, as suggestion of the previous studies 4, 6) , hypercytokinemia might contribute to clinical and laboratory features of our cases, which can be interpreted with severe systemic inflammatory response to HPeV-3 infection.",
