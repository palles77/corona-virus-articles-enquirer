An enormous amount of information has been posted to the Internet or World Wide Web (WWW or simply the 'web'). It is important to target official and professional sites, which provide reasonably accurate and up-to-date information. The information may assist in developing an information portfolio that will empower the practitioner to better target the health advice and interventions that they provide for the traveler. Some sites also have useful information that the practitioner can provide to the traveler, such as fact sheets. In this report, an annotated list of selected official and professional international websites is provided, together with a small selection of other national websites that may be of value as a starting point for the travel health practitioner. stated to be an unmoderated discussion group, it can be a useful network to source information as well as practical solutions to problems faced in travel medicine. Subscription as an ISTM member is a prerequisite for participation. For full-time and other actively involved travel health practitioners, it is probably useful to belong to an email-based discussion group.",
