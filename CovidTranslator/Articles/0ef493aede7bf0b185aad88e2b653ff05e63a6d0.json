To examine the functional state of the Xenopusexpressed P proteins, the polypeptides were tested for their ability to form stable complexes with each other. As seen in virus-infected cells, all three P proteins associated into an immunoprecipitable complex, suggesting that the system has considerable promise for the reconstruction of an active influenza RNA polymerase. Examination of the ability of paired combinations of the P proteins to associate indicated that PBl contained independent binding sites for PB2 and PA, and so probably formed the backbone of the complex. Sedimentation analysis of free and complexed P proteins indicated that PBl and PB2 did not exist as free monomers, and that similarly, complexes of all three P proteins did not simply consist of one copy of each protein. The heterodisperse sedimentation rate seen for complexes of all three P proteins did not appear to result from their binding to RNA, suggesting the incorporation of additional polypeptides in the pOl)TtlerSSe complex.",

            "text": "Influenza virus gene expression depends on the coordinate transcription and replication of eight segments of negative-sense single-stranded RNA. This is mediated by the three viral polymerase proteins PBl , PB2, and PA in association with the nucleoprotein (lnglis et a/., 1976) and possibly with other viral proteins or unidentified host cell factors. On infection of a permissive cell the ribonucleoprotein-polymerase complexes migrate to the nucleus where viral mRNAs are transcribed (Her-z et a/., 1981) . These mRNAs are initiated by, and contain, 5'-capped RNA fragments generated by a viral cap-dependent endonuclease from host cell mRNAs (Plotch eta/., 1979) . They are also polyadenylated, but lack sequences complementary to the extreme 5'-end of their corresponding genome RNA template (Hay et a/., 1977a) . At later times, dependent on the production of virus specific proteins, full-length, nonpolyadenylated, noncapped copies of the genomic RNAs are made, which then serve as templates for production of more vRNA (Hay et a/., 197713) . The polymerase (P) proteins have been shown to exist and probably function as a complex both in virions (Braam et al., 1983) and in the infected cell (Detjen et a/., 1987; Ak-' To whom requests for reprints should be addressed. kina et a/., 1987), but little is known about the role of the individual proteins, or the precise composition of the (presumably differing) complexes which catalyze the synthesis of the three types of virus RNA.",

It should then be possible to dissect the system to reveal the individual functions of particular proteins. Our approach has been to seek expression of the polymerase-associated polypeptides through transcription of cloned DNA into artificial mRNA analogs using the bacteriophage SP6 RNA polymerase, and translation of these mRNAs in Xenopus oocytes. Such a system offers the advantage that proteins may be produced individually, or in any desired combination, simply by translating the appropriate mRNA mixture. In addition, since the polypeptides can be produced simultaneously in an environment similar to that in the infected cell, the likelihood is that they will display appropriate physiological interactions. Thus, the system offers considerable promise for the reconstitution of enzyme activity.",

High levels of expression were achieved for PBl and PA after prolonged incubation, reaching 100 ng per oocyte. However, PB2 appeared to be unstable, with a half-life of about 3 hr, which meant maximal expression was around 10 ng per oocyte. Other groups have noted the instability of PB2 when expressed in isolation; PB2 expressed in NIH 3T3 cells using an inducible bovine papilloma virus vector has a similar half-life of around 3 hr (Braam-Markson el al., 1985) . Nevertheless, 10 ng of each individual polymerase protein is equivalent to the amount present in about 1 pg of purified virus, and virion transcriptase activity can easily be detected in reactions containing only 5-10 pg of purified virus (Bishop et al., 1971) .

This parallels the situation seen in the infected cell, where similarly, all three proteins associate, and also confirms the observations of other workers that a complex of the P proteins can exist in virus-infected cells independently of virus RNPs (Detjen et al., 1987; Akkina et al., 1987) . It is also the first direct demonstration that all three artficially expressed P proteins can reassociate into a complex, probably a vital preliminary step toward reconstitution of the influenza polymerase. In a previous report, where the influenza P proteins were expressed using baculovirus vectors (St. Angelo eta/., 1987) only PBl and PB2 formed an immunoprecipitable complex. The authors suggested from this that the presence of another influenza gene product was needed for the incorporation of PA into a stable complex. In the light of the results presented here this seems unlikely; an alternative explanation is that amphibian cells provide a more suitable environment for the complex formation than do insect cells. For example some kind of posttranslational modification of the P proteins might be necessary for formation of a full complex and this could be more faithfully carried out in Xenopus oocytes. The factors involved are likely to be quite subtle, because when the P proteins are cotranslated in MDL, no complex formation can be detected (not shown). Akkina et al. (1987) reported that most of the P proteins found in the cytoplasm of virus-infected cells were not in the form of complexes. However, our work would suggest that a functional nucleus is unlikely to be necessary for complex formation, as the P proteins do not localize to the nucleus in Xenopus oocytes, and furthermore, all three proteins associate normally in enucleated oocytes (not shown).",

It is not clear at present whether these structures represent self-aggregation, or the proteins binding to cellular components. This property of a large and heterogeneous sedimentation rate was also a feature of complexes of all three P proteins, as seen in the markedly different migration of PA when expressed alone or in the presence of the other two P proteins. Most of the complexed material sedimented with an apparent molecular weight much greater than 250,000, the expected size for a simple trimolecular complex. Again, this could reflect some kind of association with a cellular component, but it is unlikely to be the result of the complexes binding to RNA present in the lysate, as RNase treatment prior to gradient analysis does not reduce their rate of sedimentation (Fig. 5) or that of PB2 expressed alone (not shown). A second possibility is that the larger complexes contain extra copies of the P proteins. Support for this idea comes from the observation that the faster sedimenting forms of the complex appear to contain an increased ratio of PBl and PB2 to PA, suggesting the existence of different stoichiometric forms of complex, varying in their relative content of PBl and PB2. These might arise from PA binding directly to more than one copy of each protein, but given the heterogeneous size distribution of individually expressed PBl and PB2 (and the lack of any observable direct interaction between PA and PB2), the existence of PA associated multimers of the basic P proteins seems a more likely explanation. It has also been suggested previously that the influenza polymerase is a multimeric structure (Krystal et a/., 1986) . It is possible that PBl and PB2 behave in a manner analogous to that of SV-40 large T antigen, a large multifunctional protein which exists in different oligomeric forms with discrete biochemical activities (reviewed in Rigby and Lane, 1983) .",

Akkina et al.

It is therefore possible that different functions of the influenza RNA polymerase may be attributable to different forms of the complex.",

However, it may be possible to circumvent this problem by partially purifying the complexes from an oocyte lysate before incubating them with the RNA substrate, or alternatively, by providing natural or artificially assembled RNP structures.",

Our approach has the significant advantage that mutant polypeptides can be generated easily by manipulation of the DNA protein coding sequence. Characterization of such altered polypeptides will allow a more detailed analysis of the structure and function of the polymerase proteins.",
