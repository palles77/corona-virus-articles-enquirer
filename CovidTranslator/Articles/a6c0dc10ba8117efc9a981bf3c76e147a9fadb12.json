            "text": "Asthma causes enormous suffering and cost for children in the US and around the world [1-3]. Co-morbid gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) makes asthma management more difficult due to increased symptoms. Proton pump inhibitor (PPI) drugs are effective at improving to GERD symptoms, however they have demonstrated only modest and variable effects on asthma control in the setting of co-morbid GERD. Importantly, PPI metabolism and efficacy depend on CYP2C19 genotype. The Genotype Tailored Treatment of Symptomatic Acid Reflux in Children with Uncontrolled Asthma (GenARA) study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to determine if genotype-tailored PPI dosing improves asthma symptoms among children with inadequately controlled asthma and GERD symptoms. This study has an innovative design to both assess the efficacy of genotype-tailored PPI dosing and perform pharmacokinetic modeling of the oral PPI Lansoprazole. Children ages 6-17 years old with clinician-diagnosed asthma and mild GERD symptoms will submit a saliva sample for CYP2C19 genotyping. Participants will undergo a two-step randomization to: (1) genotype-tailored versus conventional dosing of open-label oral lansoprazole for pharmacokinetic modeling, and (2) genotype-tailored lansoprazole daily versus placebo for 24 weeks to determine the effect of genotype-tailored PPI dosing on asthma control. Measures of asthma control, spirometry, and nasal washes during acute illnesses will be collected at 8-week intervals throughout the study. GenARA will better define the effects of CYP2C19 genotype on the dose response of lansoprazole in children and adolescents and assess if a novel dosing regimen improves GERD and asthma control.",

            "text": "Year after year, asthma is a leading cause of pediatric urgent care visits, ED visits, hospitalizations, and ICU admissions [4] . Asthma also causes chronic symptoms that do not always lead to healthcare utilization but cause diminished quality of life with reduced sleep quality, missed school days, and reduced extracurricular participation. Personalized approaches tailored to at-risk, high morbidity groups hold promise for improving asthma care. Decades of data resulting from animal models [5] [6] [7] [8] , epidemiologic studies [9, 10] , human esophageal acid instillation studies [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] , pH probe asthma symptom correspondence studies [18] , and surgical fundoplication follow-up studies [19] [20] [21] [22] all suggest that GERD contributes to poor asthma control. Past trials studying the effect of proton pump inhibitors on asthma symptoms in children have shown inconsistent results ( Table 1 ). The current literature suggests that anti-GERD medications do not consistently improve asthma outcomes in a diverse cohort of patients with GERD symptoms. Partial or inconsistent response from a drug that is known to have variable clearance within the population (as is the case with PPIs) is consistent with a pharmacogenetic effect.",

            "text": "PPIs inhibit gastric H+/K+ ATPase (the final effector in the acid secretion pathway of gastric parietal cells) and are a first-line for therapy of GERD. Most PPIs are metabolized primarily by the CYP2C19 hepatic enzyme. The CYP2C19 gene is highly polymorphic so the metabolism and pharmacokinetics of PPIs is variable [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] . Depending on the CYP2C19 diplotype, individuals can be classified as poor metabolizers (PM), normal metabolizers (NM), intermediate metabolizers (IM), extensive metabolizers (EM), or ultra-rapid metabolizers (UM) ( Table 2 ) [36] . Little to no PK research among CYP2C19 metabolizer phenotypes has been conducted in children. Currently children is largely extrapolated from adult findings which is a major health and safety concern. Therefore, the GenARA study was designed as a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 24 week intervention study to determine if genotype-tailored PPI dosing improves asthma symptoms among children with inadequately controlled asthma and recent evidence of mild GERD symptoms. GenARA will measure change in the 'Juniper' Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) as the primary outcome, while evaluating asthma and GERD control and lansoprazole safety and pharmacokinetics [37] .",

A value of 80 will be used as a maximum cut-off for mild symptoms as this was 2 SD from the mean GSAS for children without baseline GERD [29, 45] Concentrations for lansoprazole and metabolites will be quantified using liquid chromatography/mass spectroscopy as described [46, 47] . This method is more sensitive than high performance liquid chromatography for metabolites requiring less plasma or blood.",

This PBPK model was developed based on available literature data and used prospectively in sensitivity analyses which showed that peak plasma concentrations is approximately 2 h and shifts later at higher gastric pH. Based on this preliminary analysis, blood will be drawn at 2 and 5 h post open-label genotype-tailored dosing. Using population PK-PD techniques, we will compute the area under the curve of all participants. We will perform an efficacy analysis to develop a pediatric population PK/PD model, which will establish a relationship between dosing conventions and plasma concentrations of lansoprazole by metabolizer phenotype. Plasma concentrations will also be compared to change in GERD symptoms. This model will be developed and qualified in three steps as outlined below.",

Once an appropriate structural model has been selected, the variance structure of the model will be informed using pooled data from the intensive and sparse sampling periods of this study. The significance of covariates, particularly of genetic polymorphisms in CYP2C19, will be assessed using an automated stepwise covariate model building method. This method involves a forward selection and backward elimination of covariates in which one model for each relevant parameter-covariate relationship is prepared and tested in a univariate manner. Statistical criterion such as a p-value < .01 (objective function value (OFV); \u0394OFV of 6.64 for 1 degree of freedom assuming a chi-squared distribution) for the forward selection and a p-value < .001 (\u0394OFV of 10.83 for 1 degree of freedom assuming a chi-squared distribution) for the backward elimination will be used to indicate relations that are of interest for inclusion. The drop in OFV will be used to rank the covariate with the most important parameter-covariate relationship. The model with the largest drop in OFV will be used to include the covariate with the largest parameter-covariate relationship into the model. Goodness-of-fit and appropriateness of the final model from the SCM will be assessed by diagnostic plots, physiological meaningfulness of the obtained parameter estimates, visual predictive checks, and non-parametric bootstraps. C. Development of a population PK/PD model: Various empirical population PK/PD models have been reported for other PPIs in adults but none in children [48, 49] . A population PK/PD model for the efficacy of lansoprazole in children will be established by linking the pop-PK model developed in (b) to an appropriate PD model. In order to identify an appropriate PD model, Emax, sigmoidal Emax and indirect response will be explored and the best model selected based on standard goodness-of-fit plots, reduction in OFV and visual predictive checks [50] . In addition, age-dependent changes in synthesis rates of proton pumps as well as circadian rhythms related to gastric acid secretions and food effects will be considered during model development [14] .",

Numerous studies in adults have shown that CYP2C19 variants markedly influence the PK and PD of PPI [30, 32, 34, [53] [54] [55] [56] . Patients needing acid-suppression who are EM or UM have higher treatment failure rates compared to NM when given conventional dosing [32, 55, 57] . H. pylori cure rates are significantly higher among PM compared to EM [31, 58] and higher doses of PPI are required to eradicate H. pylori in EM [58, 59] . Recent studies in children have also demonstrated the importance of CYP2C19 variants [60] [61] [62] . The clearance of pantoprazole was estimated in pediatric patients from birth to 16 years and was 60% lower in PMs compared to EMs [63] . Our group compared drug levels following a single dose of conventionally dosed lansoprazole with CYP2C19 genotype/metabolizer phenotype in 56 children with GERD and found a direct relationship between CYP2C19 diplotype and lansoprazole concentration [64] . We also recently found that EM children on conventional PPI dosing and undergoing esophageal pH probe testing had inadequate acid blockade compared to NM + PM. In addition, our group recently assessed all children who failed PPI therapy and subsequently underwent surgical gastric fundoplication who also had available endoscopic tissue samples for DNA genotyping. The children who failed PPI and required fundoplication were significantly more likely to have the EM phenotype compared to controls [4] . Significantly fewer children failing PPI and needing fundoplication had the PM phenotype compared to controls. Collectively, these data support our hypothesis that EM and UM children are being underdosed on conventional PPI dosing and will benefit from a higher (genotype-tailored) dose of PPI to achieve optimal antisecretory response.",

Our group showed that PPI use at conventional doses for 6 months in asthmatic children without significant GERD at baseline was associated with significantly greater sinusitis, strep throat and URI [29] . In a subsequent genetic sub-study, we showed that participants with IM or PM had significantly higher lansoprazole levels compared to NM and were significantly more likely to suffer respiratory adverse events related to URI and strep/sore throat [64] . These same PM participants developed worse asthma controlled (triggered by URI) compared to NM after 4 months on conventional PPI dosing [71] . Conventional dosing of PPI in these IM and PM patients is likely to improve GERD symptoms at the cost of greater risk of URIs. Since URIs are the most common trigger for loss of asthma control in children, conventional dosing may not ultimately not help asthma control due to greater URIs. Instead, we propose that these IM or PM patients could be given a genotype-tailored dose providing normal serum concentrations and improved GERD symptoms with the risk of excess URI. We will collect nasal wash samples from participants with URIs to microbiologically confirm URI. These results will have broad applicability because patients possessing significant CYP2C19 variants are a sizeable segment of the population. In fact, only about 40% of the population has the NM phenotype while IM/PM, EM and UM phenotypes make up 24%, 24% and 4% of the population, respectively [36] .",

CYP2C19*17 is a gain of function allele that increases drug clearance. Our prior PK data in children support the use of five distinct metabolizer phenotypes which warrant distinct dosing adjustments from the conventional two-tiered dosing. We have developed an evidencedbased dosing algorithm tailored to Extensive (EM), Ultra-rapid (UM), Intermediate (IM) and Poor metabolizers (PM) that is based on pediatric PK principles after analyzing the limited extant pediatric data.

            "text": "Innovative clinical trial design has been important to combat the lack of pediatric studies and the challenges therein. Our study was designed with a two-step randomization to study both pharmacokinetics and efficacy. Participants will be randomized to: (1) open label conventional or genotype-tailored lansoprazole for PK analysis then (2) genotype-tailored lansoprazole or placebo intervention. The part 2 randomization will not be stratified based on results of the part 1 randomization because we felt the impact on change in ACQ at 6 months would be minimal, though it is theoretically possible. To characterize the effect of PPI on asthma, we also made specific choices to safely and specifically measure efficacy. Lansoprazole has been approved by the FDA down to age 12 months for the indications GERD, duodenal ulcers, H. pylori eradication, benign gastric ulcer, NSAID-associated gastric ulcer, eosinophilic esophagitis, and pathological hypersecretory conditions. It has been used in > 10,000 patients in phase II and III clinical trials involving varying doses and durations and have been found to be well-tolerated in both short-term and long-term trials. Rarely (~1% of cases) patients have reported diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, and nausea with use of lansoprazole. The current FDA label for lansoprazole states that PPI therapy may be associated with increased risk for C. difficile associated diarrhea. Long term and multiple daily dose PPI therapy may be associated with an increase risk of osteoporosis-related fractures of the hip, wrist, or spine, and hypomagnesemia rarely. To include only 'mild' GERD, we chose to exclude children at enrollment with a GSAS > 80. Previous studies in our patient population have shown that children without diagnosed GERD had a GSAS score ranging from 0 to 276 with a mean (SD) = 18.6 (29.5) [45] . This threshold was chosen as it was 2 SD above the mean GSAS for a group of children without reported GERD at baseline [29] . We selected the ACQ as our primary outcome because: (1) it is a sensitive measure of asthma control, (2) it is validated for children and adults in Spanish and English, and (3) its simplicity.",
