            "text": "In RSV-LRTI, CT is more sensitive for detecting pulmonary findings than chest X-ray (6), as a bronchopneumonia pattern is more common in RSV-LRTI than an alveolar pattern (5, 7, 11) , and chest X-ray rarely detects the findings of a bronchopneumonia pattern. The present study showed that a bronchopneumonia pattern was indeed the most common (case 2 and 3), and chest X-ray missed these abnormal findings in most cases. Therefore, chest CT, rather than X-ray, should be performed to confirm LRTI in RSV-infected patients with lower respiratory symptoms. However, chest Xray is appropriate for evaluating pulmonary overexpansion due to bronchiolitis in infants (17) . Although bronchiolitis caused by RSV is relatively common in infants (18), it is not common in adults (11, 19) . In fact, overexpansion due to bronchiolitis was not observed in any of our eight cases. This study shows no trends for abnormal chest findings, even in the outbreak setting, which is consistent with a pre- +20days vious report by Mayer et al. (11) . Several reasons may explain this. First, although the pathophysiology remains unknown, the host's immunological status might affect CT findings. Immune responses by lymphocytes and neutrophils are correlated with disease severity, which may affect the patterns of abnormal CT findings (13) . Indeed, the patients in our study had different primary diseases and received varying immunosuppressive therapies, as shown in the Table. Second, bacterial co-infection might affect the radiological findings. However, bronchioalveolar lavage fluid was collected from only one patient, and most specimens for bacterial culture were sputum; therefore, the possibility of contamination by oral bacteria could not be excluded. In addition, the bacteria detected in our study were uncommon pathogens for causing pneumonia. Indeed, no patient was treated with antibiotics targeting these detected bacteria. Although the influence of these bacteria on CT findings is unknown, it is possible that these pathogens were colonized, rather than co-infection, so their impact on CT might be limited.",

            "text": "Although various findings are seen in patients with RSV-LRTI (9), many reports have shown that nodules and tree-inbud patterns are relatively common (5-8, 10). Kim et al. compared the CT findings among RSV, parainfluenza virus, and influenza virus, demonstrating the frequent observation of bronchial wall thickening while consolidation and GGOs were rarely seen in RSV-LRTI compared to the other two viruses (4). Miller et al. reported that an airway-centric pattern, consisting of tree-in-bud opacities and bronchial wall thickening, was characteristic of RSV-LRTI compared to other respiratory viruses (9) . It has also been reported that nodules and tree-in-bud patterns were seen during the early phase of RSV pneumonia (9, 11) . Thus, although the findings and distributions for chest CT in cases 2, 3, and 4 varied, they were categorized as airway-centric patterns, and differences may exist due to the progression of disease. Case 4, which had tree-in-bud nodular opacities, progressed to respiratory failure after the CT scan, suggesting that these findings had been observed in the early phase of RSV pneumonia. Case 5 was initially diagnosed with idiopathic pulmonary alveolar hemorrhaging due to the hemoptysis and crazy-paving pattern on chest CT. The crazy-paving pattern is uncommon for RSV-LRTI; however, a previous case report showed that RSV infection can present as a crazypaving pattern in patients receiving hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (20) .",
