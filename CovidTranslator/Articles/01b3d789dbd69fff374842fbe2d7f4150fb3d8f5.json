The frameshifting signal consists of a heptanucleotide slippery sequence and a downstream-located 12-base pair pseudoknot. The solution structure of this pseudoknot, previously solved by NMR [Michiels,P.J., Versleijen,A.A., Verlaan,P.W., Pleij,C.W., Hilbers,C.W. and Heus,H.A. (2001) Solution structure of the pseudoknot of SRV-1 RNA, involved in ribosomal frameshifting. J. Mol. Biol., 310, 1109-1123] has a classical H-type fold and forms an extended triple helix by interactions between loop 2 and the minor groove of stem 1 involving base-base and base-sugar contacts. A mutational analysis was performed to test the functional importance of the triple helix for \u00c01 frameshifting in vitro. Changing bases in L2 or base pairs in S1 involved in a base triple resulted in a 2-to 5-fold decrease in frameshifting efficiency. Alterations in the length of L2 had adverse effects on frameshifting. The in vitro effects were well reproduced in vivo, although the effect of enlarging L2 was more dramatic in vivo. The putative role of refolding kinetics of frameshifter pseudoknots is discussed. Overall, the data emphasize the role of the triple helix in \u00c01 frameshifting.",

            "text": "Ribosomal frameshifting is a translational recoding mechanism that allows the synthesis of multiple proteins from a single mRNA. During this process a certain proportion of the ribosomes is forced to move one or two nucleotides backwards (-1 or \u00c02 frameshift) or forwards (+1 or +2 frameshift) whereafter they continue translation in the new reading frame. As a result the stop codon of the first open-reading frame is bypassed and a fusion protein is synthesized [reviewed in (1, 2) ] Frameshifting is frequently used by RNA viruses, in particular by those with a single genome, and is thought to lead to precise ratios of viral proteins, which is crucial for successful infection (3, 4) . Frameshifting is occasionally used by the eukaryotic cell, e.g., to regulate expression of antizyme (5) or by the prokaryotic cell to regulate production of release factor RF2 (6) and synthesis of the gamma subunit of DNA polymerase (7) .",

The current view is that the downstream RNA element forms a physical barrier that causes a fraction of ribosomes to stall in their translocation step and puts tension on the mRNA-tRNA interaction (15) . This tension is relieved by realignment of A-site and P-site tRNAs in the 5 0 -direction, whereafter the ribosome resumes translation in the \u00c01 reading frame. Several data also point to a role for the E-site tRNA in stimulating frameshifting (16, 17) .",

            "text": "In general, a pseudoknot is more efficient in stimulating frameshifting than a hairpin of the same sequence (18, R.C.L. Olsthoorn unpublished data). This difference is likely related to a higher thermodynamic stability of the pseudoknot. Indeed, from thermodynamic analyses it appears that pseudoknots are more stable than their hairpin counterparts (19) (20) (21) . Recent studies employing mechanical 'pulling' of frameshifter pseudoknots have shown a correlation between the mechanical strength of a pseudoknot and its frameshifting capacity (13, 14) and influence of major groove and minor groove triplex structures (22) . The higher strength of a pseudoknot can be primarily attributed to the formation of base triples between the lower stem S1 and loop 2 (Figure 1 ), making it more resistant against unwinding by an elongating ribosome (15, 23) . Base triples in the pseudoknots of Beet western yellows virus (BWYV) (24) , Pea enation mosaic virus (PEMV-1) (21) and Sugarcane yellow leaf virus (ScYLV) (25) have been shown to play an essential role in frameshifting.",

G would be capable of forming the ribose zipper motif though a considerable clash between its N1 and the G4 amino group can be expected.

A28 is a key nucleotide in stabilization of the pseudoknot fold by anchoring L2 to the S1/S2 junction through formation of two hydrogen bonds with the 2 0 -hydroxyl group of G14. Replacement by U (SF108) or G (SF210) resulted in almost 2-fold decrease whereas a C (SF109), though having a similarly positioned N1 and amino groups as an adenosine, resulted in $4-fold drop in frameshifting ( Figure 1C) . Apparently, the relatively small pyrimidine ring is too far away to form interactions with the 2 0 OH of G14. In addition, the lower frameshift activity of the C-mutant could also be caused by formation of a base pair with G14, which could change the overall structure around the S1/S2 junction. In summary, the effect of single-nucleotide mutations in L2 show the functional, critical importance of the A26:G4-C16 and A28:C5-G15 triples that were previously identified by NMR spectroscopy (26) . Base triples at these positions, stabilizing the S1/S2 junction have been recognized to be essential for frameshifting in other pseudoknots as well, be it with different hydrogen bond patterns (21, 24, 25, 29) . To provide additional evidence for the importance of the specific interactions between L2 and S1 in frameshifting, we accumulated a number of the adverse mutations into one construct. Therefore, a construct was designed with a pyrimidine-rich L2 sequence CUCUCGUG (SF229, 'L2-mut') that included the A21U, C24U, A26G and A28G mutations. SF229 showed an 8-fold lower activity in frameshifting (Table 1) , which is approximately the sum of the single-nucleotide changes.",

Of course, when introducing such dramatic changes, one should also consider their effects on the pseudoknot structure and stability. In SF348 most of the base triples are presumably lost and a 3-nt loop crossing the minor groove of stem S1 may not be sterically and thermodynamically favorable.

This is a factor of 3 lower than that reported in vitro (28) . The NMR pseudoknot showed $11% of frameshifting (SF402, data not shown) that increased to $19% in combination with the UUUAAAC slippery sequence (SF404). This 1.7-fold increase is very similar to the previously reported increase from 23 to 40% in vitro for changing the slippery sequence (28) . Mutations were made in the pseudoknot of plasmid SF404. As can be seen in Figure 3 , the substitutions had almost the same effect on frameshifting in vivo as in vitro. The only exception seems to be the effect of enlarging L2, which is consistently more detrimental for frameshifting in vivo than in vitro. This could be due to refolding kinetics of the pseudoknot, what in combination with heavier ribosomal traffic in vivo would result in a lower fraction of properly folded pseudoknots.

This would be in line with the observation that the first three base pairs of a frameshift pseudoknot are usually G-C (30). However, most triples are found near the 3 0 end of L2 close to the junction with S2. Possibly, triples at the junction render the pseudoknot more resistant to forced unwinding by the ribosomal helicase, which would otherwise serve as a pivot.",

            "text": "Because the mere presence of a pseudoknot structure with a certain minimal thermodynamic stability might not be the sole primary determinant of frameshifting a number of alternative models have been proposed in which mechanical resistance of the pseudoknot to forced unwinding is the key (12, 15, 23) . In these models a pseudoknot trapped in the mRNA entry tunnel resists mechanical unwinding, which causes the ribosome to pause. Indeed, recent optical tweezers experiments, in which rupture forces of RNAs are measured by pulling 5 0 and 3 0 ends apart, showed a correlation between frameshifting and mechanical strength of the pseudoknot and confirmed a positive effect of base triple interactions on frame shift efficiency (13, 14, 22) . Frameshifting by the trapped pseudoknot is thought to be either passive, by stalling the ribosome for a sufficient amount of time, or active, by building up tension at the mRNA-tRNA interface by a counteracting ribosome, which can be relieved by a \u00c01 frameshift (15) . Observations that ribosomes can stall for seconds to minutes without frameshifting to occur (35) and pausing appears to be necessary, but not sufficient for frameshifting (36, 37) , rather point to an active role. Although it now seems mechanical resistance to RNA unfolding is the key to ribosomal frameshifting, how the ribosome exactly 'chokes' on such a structure is still far from being understood. Remaining questions are for instance if torsional restraint of the pseudoknot resisting ribosomal unwinding is essential (23) , whether the pseudoknot truly plays an active role in for instance overbending the tRNA in the P-site (12) and at which stage of translational elongation frameshifting actually occurs.",

This possibility has not been investigated in detail but our own data ( Figure 2 ) suggest that this may be a relevant issue. Especially during heavy ribosomal traffic, as may be the case in vivo, fast and correct refolding of pseudoknots could be an important parameter for frameshifting. Under such circumstances it is conceivable that a hairpin is more preferred as it probably refolds faster than a pseudoknot. A recent study on the HIV-1 frameshift signal has shown that a decrease in the translation initiation frequency can lead to an increase in the frequency of frameshifting (38) . Also a previous study in yeast has shown a correlation between frameshifting and translation initiation frequency (36) . Our data with the enlargement of L2 also hint at a possible role for folding kinetics.",
