            "text": "The organized and characteristic elements of the Golgi complex (GC)' are the stacked smooth-surfaced cisternae which are found in the centrosphere of all eukaryotic cells. These cisternae, in conjunction with other associated smoothsurfaced membranes, are responsible for executing net unidirectional intracellular transport (ICT) from the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) toward more distally located structures, e.g., lysosomes and the cell surface (24, 35, 40, 47, 85, 1 1 1, 134) . The present article is not centered on this apparently most primary of Golgi functions, but rather on the broad range of accessory activities which occur during transport, the family of \"posttranslational modifications. \" T k s e I . The pharmacologic approach which makes use of monensin to interrupt ICT. As has been discussed elsewhere (134) (135) (136) (137) , the carboxylic ionophore monensin causes partial equilibration of intra-and extracellular Na+ and K + , rapid (within seconds) dilation of all Golgi cisternae, and an impressive slowing of ICT. The agent is highly selective, at least after brief treatment (1 pJ4 monensin, 1 hour, 37\u00b0C): ATP levels and intracellular pH are little changed, many biosynthetic events continue [protein synthesis, lipid addition to glycoproteins (54) hyaluronic acid synthesis (84) etc.], and the effects of the ionophore are reversible. * Since in the presence of monensin newly synthesized proteins continue to exit from the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER), and gain access to but do not traverse the GC, one may inquire whether given posttranslational modifications occur. If they do, they may be assigned to a relatively early subcompartment. If they do not, given appropriate control experiments, they may be assigned to relatively late sub compartment^.^ The first indications that the site of interruption of ICT by monensin lies only part way across the GC came from study of the progress of N-linked oligosaccharide maturation of Ig (139) ; however, a recent use of monensin should be mentioned since it adds independent support for this idea (37) . When BHK cells are infected with Sindbis or Semliki Forest virus, viral budding is normally observed at the cell surface. If monensin is present, transport of the glycoproteins is interrupted in the GC (37, 54, 56) and viral nucleocapsids are found adhering to and budding across the membranes of dilated vacuoles (\"ICBMs\") in the Golgi region. These nucleocapsids are presum-*In the context of the later discussion, the study of hyaluronic acid biosynthesis is especially important since it strongly suggests that sugar nucleotide metabolism is little perturbed and that the effects of monensin on sugar incorporation (e.g., into glycoproteins) are directly related to intermption of ICT. Hyaluronic acid, since it lacks a protein core, would be free from such effects.",

For example, in the case of Ig carbohydrate maturation although monensin blocks I3H]Gal and [3H]Fuc labeling of Ig, the two isotopes continue to be incorporated into other acid-insoluble material (139) . In the case of the inhibition of acquisition of endo H resistence by transfenin in VSV-infected hepatoma cells, an internal control is provided by the G protein, which does become endo H resistant (133) . Were posttranslation modifications due to enzymes with acid pH optima, inhibition by monensin might be due to alkalinization of the cistemal content resulting from H+-Na+ (or K + ) exchange. However, all oligosaccharide processing enzymes studied have roughly neutral pH optima. Furthermore, there are no indications that they are sensitive to relative N a + / K + levels. To date the investigators who use monensin unfortunately do not all conform to the rather short-term protocols first used. Comparison of data is therefore often difficult. The extent to which ICT is perturbed by monensin is thought to depend on the alterations of cytoplasmic ion levels which it provokes. The impact of the ionophore may therefore reflect the activity of the Na-K-ATPase of the cell under study.",

Preparative Golgi fractions can be obtained free from smooth ER and plasma membrane because of the density perturbation which results from this buoyant content. For analytic isopycnic fractionation one would anticipate a dispersion of density in proportion to variability in the number of lipoprotein particles contained within Golgi fragments produced by homogenization. Moreover, the relative isopycnic density of different subregions of the GC would reflect the degree of maturation of the lipoproteins. If the lipid content-and as a result the density shift-increases monotonically during ICT then the relative densities of Golgi subfractions might correspond inversely to their position along the time axis of transport; however, there is no proof that such a monotonic relation applies. CONFINED FUNCTION MODEL OF THE GOLGI COMPLEX 225 5. A possible means of localizing a Golgi component relative to selected processing enzymes is to inquire whether or not it has undergone proteolytic cleavage, terminal sugar addition to N-linked oligosaccharides, initiation or completion of any O-linked oligosaccharides etc. The degree to which it has undergone posttranslational modifications should reflect its ontogeny and site of residence. 6. A kinetic ordering of processing events can be obtained by performing, for example, an amino acid labeling pulse-chase experiment and inquiring as a function of time, when the product in question undergoes one or another maturation step. Distinct kinetics need not, of course, imply distinct compartmentalization. The resolution of this approach is limited by any dispersion of transport rates of the pulse-labeled molecules.",

In addition, the structurally somewhat removed tubules and cisternae of \"GERL\" are histochemically reactive for acid phosphatase.

In fact, it is clear that selected sugar transferases are highly enriched only in certain tissues. There also must exist a set of altogether constant Golgi components-those which are responsible for its characteristic structure and endow it with the ability to conduct transport. No such components have yet been identified.",

Following the internal tetrasaccharide addition and elongation of the repeating (GlcNAc, GlcUA) disaccharide units, five further enzymes intervene (76, 77) : (1) a deacylase which removes most acetyl groups from GlcNAc (this activity is low in cells synthesizing heparan sulfate and is stimulated by Nsulfation at other residues), (2) an N-sulfotransferase which acts on most of the sites exposed by ( I ) , (3) the epimerase which converts 70-90% of glucuronic acid residues of the polymer to iduronic acid, (4) an 0-sulfotransferase which acts at C-2 of many iduronic acid residues, and (5) an 0-sulfotransferase which acts at C-6 of glucosamine. There are no data indicating whether some or all of these activities are expressed in the same cytologic subcompartment in which disaccharide elongation occurs. Recent studies have indicated the existence of two classes of heparan sulfate. One is released from the cell (e.g., hepatocyte); the other is hydrophobic and membrane-associated. It is thought to have a hydophobic core protein which serves as anchor (66).",

TIII, for example. generates a \"bisected\" (bis) structure by addition of GlcNAc to the most internal (plinked) mannose and as a result blocks the activity of TII, TIV. fucosyl transferase, and mannosidase 11. TI action is a prerequisite for action of several further transferases.

The actual degree of concomitant mannose trimming is progressive but not uniform. Tr, Terminal sugar (fucose, Gal, sialyl) transferases; G , glucosidase; M, mannosidase. such moieties has been rapidly elucidated. The recent reviews of these investigations are too thorough to warrant an exposition of this now well-known sequence of steps which involves both sugar trimming and terminal sugar addition. The processing to a triantennary complex unit, e.g., of the G protein of vesicular stomatitis viruses (VSV) in infected CHO cells, involves nine enzymes and of these only the first two glucosidases and possibly the first mannosidase act at the level of the RER (71, 127, 135) . The rest have been localized to preparative Golgi fractions. The p( 1-4) galactosyltransferase responsible for subterminal Gal addition is, at present, the best characterized Golgi enzyme. Not only have its enzymological properties been investigated in several tissues, but in addition first studies of its trans-membrane orientation (30) and biosynthesis (132) have been reported.

Such a difference is not observed in BHK cells even when they are infected with Semliki Forest virus and treated with monensin so as to increase the density of medial Golgi elements (101). In the case of CHO cells the density differences are small but intriguing since the mannosidase activity is coisopycnic with those vesicles in which the G protein acquires covalently bound lipid (vide infra). Attempts to separate subfractions differentially enriched in the terminal sugar transferases (GlcNAc, Gal, Sialyl) by sucrose gradient analysis have failed (10, 147) or provided only slight differential enrichment (34a).

An immunocytochemical study has localized p( 1-4) galactosyltransferase to the distal (thiamine pyrophosphatase-positive) cisternae of the GC of HeLa cells (1 10). The presumed products of terminal sugar transferases have also been localized. Concanavalin A-gold conjugates (which interact primarily with immature asparagine-linked oligosaccharides) stain the cisternal space of the RER and all Golgi cisternae, whereas ricin 120 (which interacts with nonreducing galactosyl residues) stains only the more distal cisternae of BHK cells (36, 37) . In a methodologically quite different study of IgM-secreting myeloma cells and an Ig-negative mutant, concanavalin A-peroxidase has been shown to stain the cisternal space of both the RER and proximal cisternae while a wheat germ agglutinin-peroxidase conjugate (specific for clustered sialic acid) stains the cisternal space of more distal cisternae and associated vesicles (138). Any such studies must be interpreted in light of what is known of the principle glycoproteins and glycolipids of the cells studied. Especially in the case of the IgM myeloma (and to a lesser extent with the BHK cells when they are infected with Semliki Forest virus) one has reason to consider much of the staining to be due to a single glycoprotein. Nevertheless, the study of the myeloma mutant suggests that the oligosaccharides of underlying Golgi components distribute in roughly the same way as the Ig oligosaccharides. Taken as a whole, the cytologic observations argue strongly that the direction of transport is indeed proximal-todistal and that the terminal sugars are acquired during passage across the stack of Golgi cisternae.",

The asparagine-linked units are donated from the same dolichol-linked intermediates as in mammalian cells, trimmed to a structure containing 2 GlcNAc and 8 Man, and elongated by massive further addition of mannose and phosphate (3) . Studies of yeast temperature-sensitive ICT mutants which overaccumulate RER, Golgi-like cisternae, or vesicles suggest that the polymannosyl elongation of the N-linked oligosaccharides of invertase occurs within the GC (21). The phosphorylation of the secretory protein also occurs within this compartment ( 13 1). (71, 86, 124) In cultured fibroblasts, the proper intracellular targeting of lysosomal enzymes depends on the presence of mannose 6-phosphate on high mannose asparaginelinked oligosaccharides. The phosphorylated structure is the result of the posttranslational addition of one or several GlcNAc-1 -phosphate units to several oligosaccharides per polypeptide, followed by removal of much of the GlcNAc. Biosynthetic labeling studies show that the \"unblocked\" phosphate structure is achieved within 1 hour after a [3H]mannose pulse and that phosphoryl groups are ultimately lost, presumably upon entry into lysosomes (31) . The enzymes responsible both for addition of the blocked phosphate and subsequent removal of the GlcNAc are both enriched in preparative liver Golgi fractions. In attempts at liver Golgi subfractionation, the two activities have been reported to be coisopycnic with mannosidase I, i.e., denser than galactosyltransferase (100) . Sucrose gradient subfractionation of a mouse lymphoma and macrophage cell line has partially resolved the phosphotransferase, phosphodiesterase, and Gal transferase (34a) . There is also a further suggestion that mannosidase I and the phosphotransferase are localized to the same Golgi subcompartment-in 3H-Man pulse-chase studies the degree of trimming to a Man, structure correlates with the progressive addition of blocked phosphates (34) .",

This route of passage is acutely manifest in the I-cell syndrome in which GlcNAc-1 -phosphotransferase activity is missing and many lysosomal enzymes are released from cells. Such molecules contain more sialic acid and are bound to insolubilized rich to a greater extent than in the wild type (124, 134a) . A somewhat analogous situation is also observed for a CHO cell mutant in which lysosomal enzymes bear only complex oligosaccharides (7 1 a). Also consistent with this line of reasoning is a report that the mannose-phosphate receptor-which is thought to mediate the ICT of newly synthesized lysosomal enzymes-bears sialic acid; however, the receptor molecules isolated may largely originate from the cell surface rather than from the GC (129) .",

Data on the influence of monensin on lysosomal enzyme transport are suggestive. In I-cell fibroblasts monensin reduces hexosaminidase secretion ( 143b). In normal cells it may actually stimulate their release (100a). It is striking that chloroquine, which also raises intralysosomal pH, also causes release of newly synthesized lysosomal enzymes (124) . This effect can be attributed to neutralization of lysosomal content by the ionophore and a consequent tying up of the mannose-phosphate receptor: however, the situation has not yet been fully analyzed. The secreted lysosomal enzymes are phosphorylated (100a). Proteins (117, 118) The presence of covalently bound lipid is not restricted to proteins which traverse the secretory pathway; however, a number of plasma membrane glycoproteins have been shown to acquire fatty acids posttranslationally.

Hence acylation is certainly not a cotranslational event ( I 19) .

(3) Subcellular fractionation of VSV-infected CHO cells pulse-labeled with [3H]palmitate shows that acylated G is coisopycnic with mannosidase I activity (20). In a closely related system, however, this isopycnic coincidence is eliminated when the density of \"medial\" Golgi elements containing the acylated viral proteins is increased by infecting the cells with Semliki Forest virus and then treating with monensin (101) . In this situation mannosidose I is unperturbed and remains coisopycnic with galactosyl transferase. (4) The acylation of these glycoproteins is not blocked by monensin (54).",

In higher organisms a partial enzymologic overlap has been noticed between the RER membranes and the GC (49, 53, 11 1) and electron microscopic lectin-binding studies (36, 135, 138) suggest that it is the anatomically proximal Golgi cisternae that resemble the RER.

The secreted particles contain noncovalently bound triglycerides, phospholipids, and free and esterified cholesterol. Recent studies of isolated Golgi fractions suggest that the phospholipids of the contained lipoproteins are in rapid equilibrium with the phospholipids of the membranes of Golgi cisternae (52) . It therefore appears likely that it is within the GC that they acquire most of their lipids. Nevertheless, since lipoprotein particles recovered from rat and chicken liver Golgi fractions do not have the same lipid composition as in serum, further intra-or extracellular maturation events must be involved (4, 52). In murine macrophages the binding of apolipoprotein E to cholesterol occurs only after discharge from the cell (6).",

Only members of the regulated class store their secretory products in granules. This content is released by exocytosis upon physiologic stimulation. The genesis of such secretory granules and lysosomes takes place either within distal Golgi cisternae or in vacuoles (e.g., \"condensing vacuoles\") in their immediate vicinity, according to cell type and physiologic conditions (23, 24). Such impressive condensation of content is in many cases thought to reflect the electrostatic interaction between secretory products, for example, between secretory proteins and proteoglycans (24,77, 142). Presumably the site of visible condensation corresponds to the region of the GC within which the proteoglycan is synthesized (e.g., sulfated) or to a later region. As already mentioned, experiments employing monensin indicate that sulfation of chondroitin sulfate is a rather late Golgi event. The proteoglycans of secretory granules have been reported to be heparin, heparan, dermatan, and chondroitin sulfate (60, 104, 142,  150) .",

A wealth of data demonstrates that the terminal sugar transferases, for example, are restricted to a subregion of the GC. Why do these proteins, synthesized in the RER, exit only as far as this portion of the GC and migrate, if at all, only much more slowly to the cell surface? Several explanations might be invoked: (1) the ionic content of the GC is unlike that the the RER and as a consequence a conformational change is induced in such membrane proteins which reduces their mobility-the possibility that the Golgi content may have unique ionic properties has recently been discussed (136), or (2) the protein encounters, within the membrane of Golgi cisternae, certain stable residents (proteins?) for which it has a high affinity, or (3) a posttranslational covalent modification executed within the GC is responsible. To date, no experimental means have been identified which cause mislocalization of such Golgi markers and no information is available to indicate whether one of the three proposed explanations might be correct.",

The GC must deal with the side products of these reactions-the mono-and dinucleosides which are produced by the transferases-especially since UDP inhibits GalNAc and Gal transferase hyaluronate synthetase (59,95, 100b). Both the UDP and GDP and to a lesser extent CMP are broken down within the cisternal space by nucleoside diphosphatase (9, 95) . Furthermore, the end-products of hydrolysis must exit from the cisternae in order to function in repetitive cycles. Only a single report pertains to this second class of carriers (30) . In the same vein, the ability of the GC to synthesize lactose (in the mammary gland) and the presence of both mannosidase and phosphodiesterase activities suggests that Golgi membranes are impermeable to disaccharides yet permeable to monosaccharides. Experimental observations on the mammary gland and myeloma cells suggest that this is the case (135, 145).",

Autoradiographic data and experiments employing puromycin (33, 87, 140, 149) are clear in implicating the GC as the site of addition of the repeating disaccharides and their sulfation. Moreover, cell-free synthetic studies employing Golgi-rich fractions of a mastocytoma show (by analogy with other studies of disaccharide growth) that chain elongation is the result of alternate addition of the two component sugars from UDP-GalNAc and UDP-GlcUA (123). No information is available concerning determination of the length of the oligosaccharide chains, which are, in fact, not of altogether uniform length (25). Sulfation appears to occur after disaccharide elongation since 2-minute 35S0, pulse-labeled intracellular chains have already acquired their mature hydrodynamic size (64). The half-time for discharge of 35S0, pulse-labeled chains is only -5 minutes (63). Hence sulfation is a very late event.",
