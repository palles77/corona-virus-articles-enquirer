These include use of viral vectors, cationic liposomes, and polymers. several copolymers were designed and synthesized based on blocks of poly(ethylene glycol) PeG, poly(propylene glycol) PPG, and poly(l-lysine). These were designated as P1, P2, and P3. We studied the copolymer self-assembly, siRNa binding, particle size, surface potential, architecture of the complexes, and siRNa delivery. silencing of GFP using copolymer P3 to deliver GFP-specific siRNa to Neuro-2a cells expressing GFP was almost as effective as using Lipofectamine 2000, with minimal cytotoxicity. Thus, we have provided a new copolymer platform for siRNa delivery that we can continue to modify for improved delivery of siRNa in vitro and eventually in vivo. Figure 9 . Gene silencing of GFP protein in Neuro 2a/GFP cells at a final concentration of 80 nM siRNa. cells were treated with complexes of copolymer P1, P2, and P3 with GFP siRNa at N/P ratio of 6, 12, and 24. cells were also treated with naked siRNa or Lipofectamine-complexed siRNas as additional controls.",

            "text": "RNA interference (RNAi) mediated by small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) is an exciting, new technology with many potential biomedical applications. siRNAs are generated by cleavage of long, double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) by the cytoplasmic enzyme Dicer in plants and worms, 1 but can also be synthetically produced and introduced into mammalian cells to achieve gene silencing. 1, 2 Inside the cells, siRNA targets specific mRNA (mRNA) for enzymatic degradation via association with the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). Exploiting this system, siRNAs have been designed as promising therapies to target human diseases including those caused by viruses [3] [4] [5] [6] and cancers. [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] A major challenge of using therapeutic siRNAs in vivo is effective and safe delivery. Typically, siRNAs are 7 nm in length with an approximate molecular weight of 13 KDa 1 and have a high net negative charge. Thus, size and charge make siRNAs unable to readily penetrate cellular membranes. Furthermore, naked siR-NAs are quickly degraded by nucleases in the bloodstream, and have a short half-life of minutes in the plasma. 12 Therefore, different methods have been proposed and examined to protect and deliver siRNAs with varying degrees of success. These include use of viral vectors, cationic liposomes, and polymers.",

            "text": "While viral vectors have proven effective in delivering siR-NAs processed from short hairpin-RNAs or micro-RNA mimics, concerns arise over the immunogenic potential and possibility of mutation of these viruses. 2, 13 Although cationic liposomes can protect siRNA from nucleases and easily penetrate cells membranes, they are considered too toxic for systemic delivery. 1 However, cationic polymers are an appealing alternative for nucleic acid delivery as they can bind and condense nucleic acids into stable nanoparticles. 1 Furthermore, cationic polymers allow for synthetic modification of structures to enhance transfection efficiencies and reduce cytoxicity. [14] [15] [16] Assembly of multiblock copolymer structures is a recent and popular approach for nucleic acid delivery. Common cationic polymers used for this purpose include poly-L-lysine (PLL) 15, [17] [18] [19] [20] and polyethylenimine (PEI). [21] [22] [23] [24] In addition, polyethylene glycol (PEG) 15, [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] 23, 24 is often introduced to improve solubility of the nanoparticle complex, increase biocompatibility, and reduce toxicity to cells. 14, 15 Of note, micelle formation of copolymer blocks with nucleic acids is viewed favorably as it has been met with some success for nucleic acid delivery. 17, 18, 22, 23, 25, 26 In a micelle-siRNA complex, the hydrophobic polymer segments form the particle core, while the cationic polymer segments complex with nucleic acid chains to form the particle shell. 18 Herein, we describe the design, synthesis, and evaluation of several copolymers based on PEG, poly(propylene glycol) PPG, and PLL blocks for siRNA delivery. It was hypothesized that the amphiphilic nature of particles formed by block combinations of these polymers would readily allow for micelle-complex formation with siRNA. We report on the structural and functional characterization of these polymers when complexed with siR-NAs, and the feasibility of using these copolymers for safe and efficient siRNA delivery.",

These block copolymers were tailored for siRNA binding via amine groups in the branched side of the PLL and subsequent delivery. In this study, PEG-NH 2 , H 2 N-PEG-NH 2 , and H 2 N-PPG-PEG-PPG-NH 2 were used as initiators in the synthesis of the P1, P2, and P3 polypeptide copolymers. The synthesis of the P1, P2, and P3 copolymers involved three steps as shown in Figure 1 . First, LL(Z)-NCA was prepared by intramolecular ring closure of LL(Z). The hybrid copolymers, protected by Z groups, were then synthesized using successive ring opening polymerization. After removal of the protective Z-groups on P1-Z, P2-Z, and P3-Z by HBr/HAc, target copolymers P1, P2, and P3 were obtained. 1 HNMR results verified the successful synthesis of P1-Z, P2-Z, and P3-Z as shown in Figure 2 . The peak which appears at \u03b43.50-3.51 ppm in Figure 2 corresponds to the protons of the -O-CH2group in the PEG or PPG unit. The peaks that appear at \u03b4 = 4.98 ppm and 7.22 ppm represent the protons of the -CH2-group and benzene group in the Cbz unit, respectively. The ratio of LL(Z) unit and the PEG or PPG unit can be obtained from 1 HNMR data. As the molecular weights of the commercial PEG-NH2, NH2-PEG-NH2, and NH2-PPG-PEG-PPG-NH2 are known, molecular weights of P1, P2, and P3 can be deduced from 1 HNMR data 18, 27 and are shown in Table 1 .",

The CMC of P1, P2, and P3 copolymers were analyzed by fluorescent spectroscopy using pyrene as a probe. From the plot of fluorescence intensity vs. copolymer concentration (Fig. 3) , the CMC of the P1, P2, and P3 obtained in this study are 556, 459, and 264 mg/l, respectively. The CMC of P3 is much less than that of P1 or P2 because of the highly hydrophobic PPG blocks in P3, and this is in agreement with previously reported research. 24 Self-assembly of cationic copolymers with siRNA The water-soluble and cationic P1, P2, and P3 copolymers formed polyplexes with siRNA via electrostatic interactions as shown by agarose gel electrophoresis. In the gel retardation assay, when siRNA is efficiently bound to its carrier and shielded from the environment, migration through the gel is completely retarded. Polyplexes were formed at N/P ratio of 0 (naked siRNA) to 4. Cationic copolymers P1 and P2 condense siRNA at an N/P ratio of 4. However, complete retardation by cationic copolymer P3 was achieved at N/P ratio of 2, indicating that the hydrophobic PPG blocks improve siRNA-binding (data not shown). The increased condensation associated with the PPG blocks of P3 copolymer can be explained by the increased charge density of the polymer.",

            "text": "Polyplexes were further characterized by size and Zetapotential measurements. Because an N/P ratio of at least 4 was needed to achieve complete siRNA condensation by all of our copolymers, all experiments discussed hereafter were performed using greater N/P ratios of 6, 12, and 24. Size and surface charge measurements are presented in Figure 4 and Figure 5 , respectively. The diameters of P1 complexes were 128 nm, 130 nm, and 150 nm for respective N/P ratios of 6, 12, and 24. The diameters of P2 complexes were 190 nm, 200 nm, and 210 nm for respective N/P ratios of 6, 12, and 24. The diameters of P3 complexes were 160 nm, 152 nm, and 130 nm for respective N/P ratios of 6, 12, and 24 (Fig. 4) . The diameters of P2 complexes were larger than those of P1 and P3.The two sides of PLL may contribute to making P2 complexes less compact by entrapping many water molecules in the complexes and thus, contributing to the larger Figure 1 . synthesis of copolymers P1, P2, and P3.synthesis of the copolymers began with preparation of LL(Z)-Nca by intramolecular ring closure of LL(Z). The hybrid copolymers were then synthesized using successive ring opening polymerization. Finally, Z-groups on P1-Z, P2-Z, and P3-Z were removed using hBr/hac, and target copolymersP1, P2, and P3 were obtained. Reaction temperatures (\u00b0c) and times are indicated at each step shown in the figure. complex sizes measured. It was interesting to find that increasing the N/P ratio of P1 or P2 polymer complexes resulted in larger particles, while increasing the N/P ratio P3 polymer complexes resulted in smaller particles. Because the PPG segments are chemically attached to the PLL segments, formation of a PPG core causes dense packaging of P3-siRNA complexes. The Zeta potential analyses are provided in Figure 5 . The Zeta-potentials of P1 complexes were 28 mv, 29 mv, and 31 mv for respective N/P ratios of 6, 12, and 24. The Zeta-potentials of P2 complexes range were 44 mv, 46 mv, and 52 mv for respective N/P ratios of 6, 12, and 24. Finally, the Zeta-potentials of P3 complexes were 19 mv, 20 mv, and 22 mv for respective N/P ratios of 6, 12, and 24. The Zeta-potentials of P2 complexes were greater than those of P1 and P3. It was interesting that P2 complex has greater potential but lower siRNA binding ability. A possible reason is that the larger surface areas coupled with lower siRNA binding efficiency would induce more charge leave on their surfaces. Taken together, the size and Zeta potential measurements have provided useful information on the architecture of the P1, P2, and P3 complexes: (1) P1 and P2 complexes were less dense, although they still appeared to form micelles, (2) a well-defined boundary between PLL/siRNA complexes and PEG segments was not apparent, (3) PLL segments increasingly localized to the PEG corona, and (4) P3 complex is small in size and has a relatively defined layer structure because of the PPG core. It is possible that the small Zeta potential of P3 (~20 mV) may improve its affinity to the cells and internalization by the cells as compared with the other copolymers tested. The possible micelle architecture of complexes of copolymer with siRNA is shown in Figure 6 . Evaluation of cytotoxicity by P1, P2, and P3 copolymers The cytotoxicity of cationic copolymers P1, P2, and P3 was evaluated by MTT viability assay in Neuro-2a cells. The cells were incubated with various concentrations of copolymers for 48 h. The results in Figure 7 show that P1 copolymers were the least toxic, while P2 copolymers were the most toxic. When treated with any of the copolymers at about 60 \u03bcg/ml, the cells maintained over 80% viability. Cells treated at concentrations of 80 \u03bcg/ml maintained over 85% viability when treated with copolymers P1 and P3, but less than 75% when treated with P2. Toxicity has been shown to be related to charge density of the polymer, 28 and may provide an explanation for the different results observed using the different copolymers. Another explanation is that toxicity might be primarily caused by addition of an excess of polymer. 29 Cellular uptake of copolymer-siRNA complexes Cellular uptake is a key step for siRNA delivery. To assess the ability of the various polymers to facilitate siRNA internalization, green fluorescent protein (GFP)-targeted siRNA labeled with a Cy3 fluorescent tag was used to form polyplexes. Fluorescence microscopy was used to monitor uptake of Cy3-tagged siRNA (red) and knockdown of GFP expression (green) in Neuro-2a/ GFP cells (Fig. 8) . The cells shown were transfected with polyplexes composed of the cationic copolymers P1, P2, and P3 with siRNA at N/P ratios of 6, 12, and 24. At the lowest N/P ratio of 6, red fluorescent signal was not detected inside the Neuro 2a cells and GFP expression was still very strong, indicating poor uptake of polyplexes. However, when the N/P ratio was increased to 24, labeled siRNA was detected inside the cells and GFP expression decreased. Furthermore, Cy3 signal increased while GFP expression decreased in cells treated with P2 and P3 complexes as compared with cells treated with P1 complex. Thus, at a high N/P ratio of 24, copolymers P2 and P3 demonstrated higher efficiencies for cellular uptake and gene silencing than P1.",

Particle size of complexes of copolymer P1, P2, and P3 with GFP siRNa at various N/P ratios. copolymer-siRNa complexes were prepared in aqueous solution using multiple N/P ratios while keeping siRNa (200 pmol) constant. sizes were determined at 25 \u00b0c using the Zetasizer Nano. intracellular release of siRNA. While this higher cationic charge of P2 complex may induce greater gene knockdown, it may also induce greater cytotoxicity. In contrast, for P3-siRNA complex, greater gene knockdown may be attributed to the PPG structure of copolymer P3 and the micelle-complex architecture of their aggregates. In addition, while copolymers P1 and P2 are water soluble block copolymers that can complex with siRNA to form micelle-like aggregates of larger size and lesser density, copolymer P3 has hydrophobic block PPG units. It is possible that the copolymer P3-siRNA complex entered the cells more readily because of its small volume and dense architecture as compared with P1and P2-siRNA complexes.",

Furthermore, P3 was able to complex with siRNA at a low N/P ratio of 2. Compared with P1 and P2, P3 complexes are smaller and denser, and thus, may be internalized via endocytosis more readily than free siRNA, P1, or P2 complexes. P3 complexes are more efficient for siRNA delivery and gene silencing than P1. P3-siRNA complexes decreased GFP expression in GFPexpressing Neuro-2a cells to 28%. In addition to the amount of internalized amount of siRNA, the internalization pathway or endo/lysosomal escape of siRNA can also contribute to an effective RNAi effect. Of interest, siRNA delivery by P3 was similarly efficient as that by Lipofectamine\u2122 2000, making it a viable candidate for siRNA delivery pending further optimization.",
