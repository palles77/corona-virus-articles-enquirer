            "text": "Emerging viral diseases pose a unique risk to public health. Ebola virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and members of the Henipavirus genus of paramyxoviruses are all highly pathogenic viruses that have arisen in the past 40 years and caused, or threaten to cause, major outbreaks. New viral threats continue to emerge, most recently demonstrated by a novel beta-coronavirus, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), which was identified in 2012 (Zaki et al., 2012; Memish et al., 2013; de Groot et al., 2013) . There are currently no approved vaccines or therapeutics for many of the highly pathogenic viruses potentially dependent on cathepsins, including Ebola virus, Nipah virus (NiV), MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. Broadspectrum antiviral drugs, with overlapping therapeutic indications, would facilitate rapid responses to new or changing pandemic threats, potentially even without precise identification of the agent. Targeting host factors involved in viral entry provides an excellent avenue for such drug development, due to the limited number of pathways involved The glycoproteins of corona-, filo-and paramyxoviruses facilitate viral entry into target cells by binding to receptors and by driving fusion of viral and host cell membranes. However, the glycoproteins are synthesized as inactive precursors and depend on activation by host cell proteases to acquire a fusion active form. As a consequence, the respective enzymes are potential targets for broad-spectrum antiviral intervention. Cell culture studies demonstrated that endosomal cysteine proteases, in particular cathepsin B (CTSB) and/or L (CTSL), can activate the glycoproteins of filoviruses, SARS-CoV, other coronaviruses, and NiV and Hendra (HeV) viruses to facilitate entry into certain cell lines. In addition, activation of coronaviruses can also be accomplished by TMPRSS2, or other serine proteases located at the cell surface, or secreted into the extracellular space (Simmons et al., 2013) . However, the respective roles of endosomal and cell surface proteases in viral spread in the infected host is unknown.",

We describe here the discovery of K11777 and its related compounds, as broad-spectrum antivirals targeting endosomal proteases involved in viral entry. K11777, a cysteine protease inhibitor, blocked infection when viral entry did not require activating serine proteases, as is the case with ebolavirus (EBOV). K11777 also fully inhibited coronavirus infection, but only when target cell lines lacking activating serine proteases were used. If cells expressed cell-surface serine proteases known to activate coronaviruses, both K11777 and a serine protease inhibitor, such as camostat were required for full inhibition. Thus, both compounds were deployed to examine which activation pathway is predominant in vivo. Camostat displayed antiviral activity in a pathogenic animal model for SARS-CoV infection, indicating that serine protease inhibitors are suitable for treatment of SARS and potentially MERS. The predicted effect of K11777 and related cysteine protease inhibitors versus Ebola virus in vivo must await studies in approved biocontainment facilities.",

The next day, expression was induced with sodium butyrate (10 mM) for 6 h before washing once. Forty hours after transfection, supernatant was filtered through a 0.45 lmpore-size filter and frozen at \u00c080\u00b0C. Virus was titrated essentially as it would be used in the screening assay. If required, virions were purified and concentrated by ultracentrifugation (28,000 rpm in a SW28 rotor, Beckman) over a 20% sucrose cushion, resuspended in Hank's balanced salt solution (HBSS) and stored at \u00c080\u00b0C as aliquots. Pseudoviruses were normalized for equal infectivity by transduction of target cells with serially diluted stock followed 48 h later by determination of luciferase activity in cell lysates according to the manufacturer's instruction (Promega). VSV-based pseudotypes bearing Junin virus G were produced essentially as described (Steffen et al., 2013) by transfecting 293T cells with 16 lg of Junin G plasmid and then infecting the cells with recombinant VSVDG-GFP(VSV-G). Progeny VSVDG-GFP(Junin-G) virus was then collected, titrated and used for inhibition studies. In the case of NiV, VSVDG-GFP(NiV F/G) viruses were produced via calcium phosphate transfection of 293T cells with 10 ug of NiV F and 10 lg of NiV G. Transfected cells were left for 16 h before an initial medium change; then infected with recombinant VSVDG-GFP(VSV-G) (MOI 0.1-0.3) after five additional hours. Media alone or compound of interest were then added at the desired concentration and cells were incubated overnight before supernatant was harvested and filtered. To assay for inhibition, production of entry-competent virus was examined. Target cells were pre-plated at 25,000 cells/ 50 ll in 96 well plates and allowed to attach overnight. 50 ll of undiluted VSVDG-GFP NiV F/G made in the presence or absence of inhibitor was added. Cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2 for two days, and then washed and fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde and GFP fluorescence determined by flow cytometry using a Becton Dickinson LSRII cytometer and FlowJo software. 100% infection was determined with samples infected with pseudovirons produced from cells with no compound exposure.",

We also tested the ability of K11777 to prevent activation and hence infectivity during production of VSV-based pseudotypes (Salvador et al., 2009) bearing NiV F and G. K11777 was active against all the major enveloped viruses previously known to require cathepsin-mediated proteolysis, including a variety of coronaviruses and filoviruses, especially EBOV ( Fig. 1b; Table 1 ). K11777 inhibited SARS-CoV pseudovirus entry with an IC 50 of 0.68 nM (Fig. 1b , Table 1 ) while no toxicity was observed, CC 50 > 10 lM (data not shown). MERS-CoV and NL63 envelope required higher concentrations of K11777 for inhibition, likely due to less reliance on CTSL Hofmann et al., 2006) . Nevertheless, the IC 50 s were very low: 46 nM for MERS-CoV and <7 nM for NL63. In contrast, 100 nM K11777 did not inhibit infection mediated by envelope glycoproteins from an alphavirus (CHIKV), a rhabdovirus (VSV), a flavivirus (HCV), the retroviruses MLV-A and XMRV or two arenaviruses, Lassa and Junin virus.",

The serine protease inhibitor camostat mesylate (camostat) inhibits the enzymatic activity of TMPRSS2 and other cell-surface proteases involved in coronavirus activation (Kawase et al., 2012) . We therefore assessed whether K11777 displays antiviral activity in TMPRSS2 expressing cells. For this, we incubated target cells with camostat, K11777, or a combination of K11777 and camostat and then infected with pseudoviruses bearing 229E-S. K11777 alone demonstrated up to $70% inhibition of 229E-S-mediated transduction. Simultaneous treatment with camostat and K11777 increased inhibition to $90% (Fig. 2a, left panel) . Similar inhibition patterns were obtained using the human intestinal epithelial cell line Caco-2, which express endogenous TMPRSS2 and cathepsins (Fig. 2b) . In contrast, K11777 alone fully blocked Ebola pseudovirus infection, while camostat had no impact on viral infection (Fig. 2a, middle panel) . Finally, treatment of cells with K11777, camostat or both, had no impact on VSV-G driven viral entry (Fig. 2a, right panel) , which is known to be independent of cysteine and serine protease activity. These results indicate that both serine and cysteine proteases can activate 229E-S for viral entry, as expected, while EBOV-GP exclusively relies on cysteine proteases for activation.",

Given that the piperazine ring in K11777 is basic (pKa $7.8 for the conjugate acid) we considered that the compound might accumulate in the acidic (lysosomal and endosomal) compartments where target proteases such as CTSL and CTSB are abundant. To explore this notion and to more generally evaluate structure-activity trends, we synthesized new vinylsulfone analogs in which the substituent on the piperazine ring nitrogen atom was modified systematically. While the majority of these analogs (Table 2 ) retain a basic piperazine ring, the N-phenyl analog SMDC-256158 is only weakly basic (pKa $3.42 for the conjugate acid) and thus will be neutral at physiological pH and would not be expected to exhibit lysosomotropic behavior. Nearly all of the new analogs possessed potency comparable or superior to K11777 against SARS-CoV and EBOV (Table 2) , the most potent analogs being SMDC256122 (SARS-CoV IC 50 = 0.04 nM; EBOV IC 50 = 0.12 nM), SMDC256159 (SARS-CoV IC 50 = 0.07 nM; EBOV IC 50 = 0.16 nM) and SMDC256160 (SARS-CoV IC 50 = 0.08 nM; EBOV IC 50 = 0.11 nM). Flaviviridae ssRNA(+) Huh7.5 >100 a IC 50 (inhibitory concentration) values are the concentrations required to inhibit the infectivity of the pseudotyped viruses on cells by 50%, which were determined from dose response curves. All envelopes apart from Nipah and Junin were used to make HIV-based pseudotypes. Target cells (293T, 293T expressing ACE2 or CD13, or Vero cells) were then pretreated with serial dilutions of K11777 and exposed to virus. VSV-based pseudotypes were made by transfecting cells with Nipah F and G plasmids, or Junin envelope, and transducing with VSVDG(GFP)-G. Progeny virus was then collected and titered on target cells. A non-linear regression analysis based on the Sigmoidal dose response equation was applied to the percent inhibition and concentration data. Data is shown as means of triplicate measurements \u00b1 standard deviation. Values are representative of at least two independent experiments.",

The reduced potency of SMDC-256158 is likely not related to the size of the phenyl substituent, since even larger, biaryl P3 substituents are known to be well tolerated in cathepsin-L like proteases such as cruzain (Beaulieu et al., 2010) . Also consistent with this interpretation, we find that other bulky tertbutyl and cyclopentyl groups are tolerated in analogs like SMDC-256160 and SMDC-256161. Therefore, the most likely explanation is that as a weak base and the only analog expected not to be protonated at physiological pH, SMDC-256158 does not accumulate in the lysosome to the same extent that the other, more basic, analogs do. Conversely, K11777 and the other basic analogs accumulate in acidic endosomal compartments where target cysteine proteases such as CTSL and CTSB are located.",

A number of additional vinylsulfone analogs were synthesized, some of which exhibited enhanced potency compared to K11777.

In contrast, EBOV infection was effectively inhibited by K11777, but not by camostat. While unidentified additional proteases have been reported to mediate infection by other filoviruses, such as MARV (Gnirss Fig. 3 . Effects of per os administered SMDC256160 and/or camostat on survival of BALB/c mice infected with a lethal SARS-CoV. Ten mice per group were dosed twice a day by oral gavage with SMDC256160 and/or camostat or diluent alone (sterile water) for 9 days beginning 10 h prior to infection with 10,000 pfu of mouseadapted SARS-CoV. et al., 2012) and SUDV (Misasi et al., 2012) , efficient inhibition by the vinylsulfone analogs suggests that the unidentified proteases are cysteine proteases related to CTSB and L. Activation of NiV and HeV appears to be fully dependent on CTSL and/or CTSB (Pager et al., 2006; Diederich et al., 2008 Diederich et al., , 2012 . Thus, vinylsulfones are promising antiviral lead compounds for further optimization as potent inhibitors of these two important groups of pathogenic emerging viruses, including EBOV. Previous reports showed that compound K11777 and analogs have satisfactory safety and pharmacokinetic profiles in rodents, dogs and primates (Abdulla et al., 2007) . The fact that K11777, as a vinylsulfone, is an irreversible and not highly selective cysteine protease inhibitor does not appear to be a liability, at least if it is used as a short course antiviral. Indeed, in the case of filoviruses, the lack of target selectivity is likely a boon -increasing effectiveness by also inhibiting secondary proteases (Gnirss et al., 2012; Misasi et al., 2012) .",

For this, a mouse model for lethal SARS-CoV infection was employed. Notably, only inhibition of serine proteases mitigated SARS-CoV pathogenesis in vivo. Thus, future development of anti-coronavirus therapeutics should focus on inhibiting serine rather than cysteine proteases, with camostat being an excellent starting candidate. Indeed, in Japan camostat is used clinically, particularly to treat chronic pancreatitis (Ikeda et al., 1988; Sai et al., 2010) , with a reasonable safety profile (Fiopan \u00d2 Tablets, 2009 ).",

Although endosomal and cell-surface proteases can facilitate coronavirus entry in cultured cells, only the activity of serine proteases is required for viral spread in the infected host. Nevertheless, the highly potent cysteine protease inhibitors identified here might be excellent starting points for the development of highly effective inhibitors of Ebola virus and Paramyxovirus entry, and constitute excellent research tools for dissecting the molecular mechanisms of viral entry.",
