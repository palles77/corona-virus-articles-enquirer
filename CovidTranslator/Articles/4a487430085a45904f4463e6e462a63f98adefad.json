Fever (> 38\u00b0C) was the earliest symptom (50/53 SARS vs. 5/31 non-SARS, p < 0.0001), preceding cough by a mean of 4.5 days. The initial chest X-ray study was normal in 22/53 SARS cases versus 5/31 non-SARS cases. SARS patients with an initially normal chest X-ray study developed infiltrates at a mean of 5 \u060e 3.44 days after onset of fever (21/22 SARS vs. 0/5 non-SARS). Rapid radiographic progression of unifocal involvement to multifocal infiltrates was seen in 22 of 24 SARS vs. 0 of 26 non-SARS patients (p < 0.0001). Pleural effusion was not present in any SARS patients but was seen in 6 of 26 non-SARS cases (p < 0.0001). Initial lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase were all more common in SARS than non-SARS (p <",

These included 9 who died in the emergency department (ED), 31 who were transferred to other hospitals, 1 who left, and 42 who were discharged from the ED and isolated at home due to resolution of symptoms within a few days in the ED. Of the remaining 84 patients who were admitted, 53 had convincing evidence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) infection and 31 patients had no evidence of SARS-CoV infection. These 31 patients had an alternative diagnosis that fully explained their symptoms (Table 1 ) and all except one who died during hospitalization had two negative anti-SARS CoV. The evidence confirm-ing SARS consisted of either a positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and a typical clinical course or, in the absence of a positive PCR, a typical clinical course with a definite contact history or evidence that the patient transmitted the infection to someone else.

If these features are present along with a positive PCR for SARS-CoV, we can be fairly confident of the diagnosis of SARS. For patients whose initial presentation is not so clear, rapid progression of chest X-ray abnormalities, particularly with changes from uni-to multifocal or uni-to bilateral infiltrates is also strong evidence of SARS. These clinical patterns are particularly important if PCR testing is not available. However, further comparison with other series of patients with confirmed SARS and non-SARS is necessary to ascertain important discriminatory features.",
