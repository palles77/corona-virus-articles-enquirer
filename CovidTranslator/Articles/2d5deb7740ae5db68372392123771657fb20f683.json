Its containment represents a new way of working internationally, and demonstrates how intense collaboration in virology, clinical medicine and epidemiology can rapidly provide the information necessary to create and implement evidence-based control measures. The SARS outbreak serves as a reminder of the need for a strong national surveillance and response to infectious diseases, evidence-based international travel recommendations, and a global alert and response network to serve as a safety net when national surveillance fails.",

The IHR are the only set of international legal rules binding WHO member states concerning the control of infectious diseases with a potential to spread internationally. The IHR, adopted in 1969, are a passive system for the reporting of three communicable diseases thought to be important because of their potential spread internationally-cholera, plague and yellow fever. Once reported to WHO, notification is made in The WHO Weekly Epidemiological Record describing the geographical extent of the infected area(s). At the same time the IHR describe standard, maximally acceptable measures that may be applied by countries to prevent these diseases from spreading internationally, and sets out norms and standards for seaports and airports to prevent the spread of infectious disease vectors from public conveyances that land at these ports.",

            "text": "During the last decade of the twentieth century, after several infectious disease outbreaks, including cholera in Latin America, pneumonic plague in India and Ebola haemorrhagic fever in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, a need was identified for a stronger international coordination of the outbreak response, and more timely and accurate information during the course of an outbreak that threatens global public health security (WHO 1994; Tauxe et al. 1995; Heymann et al. 1999; Khan et al. 1999) . This led, in 1996, to the initiation of a revision process of the IHR to broaden disease coverage, incorporate the use of more up-to-date communication technologies, and use these up-to-date technologies to provide real-time information on which to formulate measures to prevent international spread (WHO 2002a (WHO , 2003a . The revision process itself began with a series of field tests that led to the proactive collection of information about disease outbreaks and the development of protocols for coordinated international response, embodied in GOARN. GOARN is a network with a secretariat within WHO that links individual surveillance and response networks that have been established throughout the world. Initiated in 1997 and formalized in 2000, it now has over 120 surveillance and response partners world-wide (WHO 1998 (WHO , 2000 Heymann & Rodier 2001) . Although GOARN identifies and responds to more than 50 outbreaks in developing countries each year, the SARS outbreak was the first time that GOARN identified and responded to an outbreak that was rapidly spreading internationally.",

At the same time another GOARN partner, the US Global Emerging Infections Surveillance and Response System, picked up similar media reports about a severe outbreak in Beijing and Guangzhou, with influenza B the suspected cause. As GOARN continued to receive media and other reports about influenza outbreaks in China, requests for information to Chinese authorities were made by WHO. On 12 December WHO received a detailed report on data collected at Chinese influenza surveillance sites indicating that investigation of 23 influenza virus isolates had confirmed type B strains in all but one, and that the number of cases was consistent with the seasonal pattern in previous years.",

This first outbreak of atypical pneumonia appears to have continued until a second outbreak, with amplified transmission to health workers, began during the first 10 days of February. On 10 February 2003, the WHO office in Beijing received an email message describing an infectious disease in Guangdong Province, said to have caused more than 100 deaths. On 11 February the Guangzhou Bureau of Health reported to the press more than 100 cases of an infectious atypical pneumonia outbreak that had been occurring in the city for more than a month. That same day the Chinese Ministry of Health officially reported to WHO 300 cases and five deaths in an outbreak of acute respiratory syndrome, and the following day reported that the outbreak dated back to 16 November 2002, that influenza virus had not yet been isolated, and that the outbreak was coming under control (Zhong et al. 2003) .",

After this alert, reports of more than 150 new cases of atypical pneumonia of unidentified cause were received from hospitals in six Asian countries and Canada (Health Canada 2003). The disease did not respond to antibiotics and antivirals known to be effective Phil. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B (2004) against primary atypical pneumonia and other respiratory infections. No patients, including young and previously healthy health workers, had recovered, many were in a critical condition, several required mechanical ventilatory support, and four had died. Equally alarming, the disease was rapidly spreading along the routes of international air travel. The potential for further international spread was clearly demonstrated that same day when a medical doctor, who had treated the first cases of atypical pneumonia in Singapore, reported similar symptoms shortly before boarding a flight from New York to Singapore on 14 March. The airline was alerted and the doctor and his wife disembarked in Frankfurt for immediate hospitalization, becoming the first cases in Europe (WHO 2003f ). On 15 March WHO therefore issued a second and stronger global alert, this time in the form of an emergency travel advisory (WHO 2003g) . The alert provided guidance for travellers, airlines and crew, provided a case definition, and gave the new disease its name: SARS. It also launched a coordinated global outbreak response aimed at preventing this newly identified transmissible disease, of undetermined cause and unknown epidemic potential, from becoming endemic.",

Recommendations were at first non-specific, urging international travellers to have a high level of suspicion if they had travelled to or from areas where the outbreak was occurring. However, as more information became available, airports were asked to screen passengers for a history of contact with SARS and for individuals with a current illness that corresponded with the probable SARS case definition.

Continued national surveillance for SARS has identified two laboratory workers who appear to have been infected in laboratories handling the virus in Singapore and Taiwan, respectively, and China's national surveillance has identified three laboratory-confirmed and one probable case of SARS, all of whom have had a less severe clinical disease, without apparent transmission to health workers or others (WHO 2003j,k, 2004 . With continued national surveillance, and with continued research aimed at identifying the risk factors of transmission of the SARS coronavirus from nature to humans, the answers to the many scientific questions generated by the SARS outbreak will eventually be understood. Continued strengthening of GOARN will provide the safety net that will detect and respond to the next emerging disease event of international public health importance should national surveillance again fail to raise the alarm, be it a new and unrecognized agent-or the next global pandemic of influenza.",
