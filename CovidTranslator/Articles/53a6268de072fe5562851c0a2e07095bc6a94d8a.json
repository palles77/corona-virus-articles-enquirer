Using the daily data from the Taiwan Stock Exchange Capitalization Weighted Stock Index and from the National Health Insurance Research Database during 2001/1/1e2007/12/31, which consist of 2556 observations, we examine the effects of stock market on stroke incidence e the level effect and the daily change effects. In general, we find that both a low stock index level and a daily fall in the stock index are associated with greater incidences of stroke. We further partition the data on sex and age. The level effect is found to be significant for either gender, in the 45e64 and 65! age groups. In addition, two daily change effects are found to be significant for males and the elderly. Although stockholdings can increase wealth, they can also increase stroke incidence, thereby representing a cost to health.",

Firstly, as compared to the outpatient data provided by the NHRI, which are samplingbased, the inpatient records are population-based; thus, the use of inpatient data can help to avoid potential issues of sampling bias. Secondly, we select inpatient care over outpatient care because the former has lower demand elasticity than the latter; thus, hospitalizations are more likely to reflect actual changes in health status (Manning, Newhouse, Duan, Keeler, & Leibowitz, 1987; Ruhm, 2003) .",

The stock price index level measures the overall macroeconomic status and serves as a proxy of the wealth level. The daily percentage change in stock price index captures the wealth variation in the short run. Previous studies have shown that the stock investors are engaged in short-term trading in some emerging markets. Using a complete individual-level stock trading dataset of Taiwan, Barber, Lee, Liu, and Odean (2009) find that day trading is prevalent in Taiwan e the percentage of day trade to all trades was 23.1% during their study period, 1995e1999. Moreover, they show that the average turnover in Taiwan Stock Exchange was 294% annually. In contrast, the annual turnover in the New York Stock Exchange was about 97%. The statistics indicates that short-term stock trading plays an important role in Taiwan. Thus, the daily effect of stock price change is included in our analysis. For those non-transaction days such as weekends and holidays, we set the close index value equal to the previous transaction close index value. It follows that the daily change of stock index for a nontransaction day is zero.",

It indicates that when the stock market index went down by 1 per cent within a single day, there was an increase of approximately 1.581 (\u00bc1.002 \u00fe 0.579) in the number of hospitalizations for occurrences of stroke on that day. Note that the daily change effect was asymmetric due to the second order effect. If the stock market index went up by 1 per cent within a single day, there was a decrease of approximately 0.423 (\u00bc\u00c01.002 \u00fe 0.579) in the number of stroke hospitalizations on that day.

Our analysis exhibits significant weekday variations in occurrences of stroke; indeed, we find a significant Monday effect, similar to the prior studies (Jakovljevic, 2004; Kelly-Hayes et al., 1995) . Using Monday as the reference day, we find that there were approximately 35.106 fewer hospitalizations for stroke on Tuesdays, 37.695 fewer on Wednesdays, 41.456 fewer on Thursdays, 37.122 fewer on Fridays, 74.977 fewer on Saturday, and 113.188 fewer on Sunday.",

It is again readily noticeable that the time trend has significance for the elderly group, but not for the other age groups. Our result suggests that stock index has stronger effects on male and elder people and it urges us to investigate the effects based on the data divided by both gender and age. Table 5 shows that all three effects are significant only in the elderly male group. The level effect is significant in the elderly female group and in the mid-age male group. Comparing Table 3 and Table 5 , we find that the significant effects for male are mainly driven by the elder males. Moreover, we find that the significance of two daily effects of the elderly group (in Table 4 ) is mainly driven by the elder males (in Table 5 ) since both daily effects are insignificant for the elder females.",

Firstly, the level effect of the stock market index on stroke hospitalizations is found to be significantly negative; that is, when the stock market index is at a low level, incidences of cerebrovascular disease are found to be relatively high. In general, a 1000 point fall in the TAIEX increases the number of daily stroke hospitalizations by 4.396. Secondly, daily movements in the stock price are also found to affect incidences of stroke. A fall of 1 per cent in the TAIEX within a single day increases daily hospitalizations for stroke by 1.582; this result is in line with the general view that a reduction in wealth is detrimental to health status. Thirdly, a fall in TAIEX within a day increases daily stroke hospitalizations in a quadratic way. A 2 per cent fall within a single day leads to an increase of approximately 4.32 in the number of hospitalizations due to stroke on that day.",

One possible answer is that a reduction in wealth can often lead to depression, a condition which is already documented as being a high risk factor for stroke (Glymour, Maselko, Gilman, Patton, & Avenda\u00f1o, 2010; Jonas & Mussolino, 2000) . The level effect is found to be significant for both males and females whilst the daily change effects are found to be significant only for males. One potential reason for this significant daily change effect primarily affecting men is the fact that men participate in the stock market much more actively than women. Some researchers have also documented differences between men and women in terms of their attitude towards money; for example, Prince (1993) argued that men were more prone to feelings of greater competence in their management of finances and were therefore likely to take greater risks in order to amass wealth. From their analysis of survey and brokerage records, Lewellen, Lease, and Schlarbaum (1977) found that men spent more time and money on financial analysis, and also engaged in more transactions. Barber and Odean (2001) similarly examined a stock brokerage dataset, comprising of transactions by over 35,000 households, and found that men traded 45 per cent more than women. Thus, both the psychology and health status of men are more likely to be affected by daily stock market movements given that men engage far more actively in stock transactions than women.",

If the stock market performs poorly, there will be a general reduction in their wealth, which could lead to higher stress levels and greater depression, thereby resulting in higher incidences of stroke. There are some inherent limitations of this study which should be taken into consideration. Firstly, the NHIRD contains no information on the socioeconomic variables of patients. Socioeconomic status has consistently been found to be an important factor in health status (Cox et al., 2006) , and it is possible that people of high status may be resistant to stock market volatility since they are more likely to have access to other sources of income.
