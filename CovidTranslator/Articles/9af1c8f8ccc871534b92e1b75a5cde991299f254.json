The genetic diversity of viruses is commensurately enormous and might substantially exceed the diversity of cellular organisms. Unlike cellular organisms with their uniform replication-expression scheme, viruses possess either RNA or DNA genomes and exploit all conceivable replication-expression strategies. Although viruses extensively exchange genes with their hosts, there exists a set of viral hallmark genes that are shared by extremely diverse groups of viruses to the exclusion of cellular life forms. Coevolution of viruses and host defense systems is a key aspect in the evolution of both viruses and cells, and viral genes are often recruited for cellular functions. Together with the fundamental inevitability of the emergence of genomic parasites in any evolving replicator system, these multiple lines of evidence reveal the central role of viruses in the entire evolution of life.",

Since then, the developments in virology and genomics have completely changed the concept of viruses. We now realize that viruses are ubiquitous and enormously abundant, in terms of both infecting all known cellular life forms and being present in all explored environments. Actually, viruses appear to be the most abundant biological entities on the planet, substantially outnumbering cells in most well-studied habitats [1] [2] [3] . The genetic diversity of viruses is enormous as well: the majority of distinct genes in the biosphere seem to reside in viral genomes [4] . Beyond their quantitative dominance, virus genome sizes, gene repertoires and particle sizes and shapes are extremely variable. Moreover, viruses exploit all theoretically conceivable strategies of genome replication and expression, in contrast to the uniform replication-expression cycle of cellular life forms.",

Not only do viruses hijack host genes for counter-defense and other functions, but cellular hosts as well routinely recruit viral genes for diverse roles. Viruses that evolve at high rates might comprise the principal source of novel genes in the biosphere [8] .

In a sharp contrast, viruses exploit effectively all possible combinations of DNA and RNA interconversions: the replicating genome that is incorporated into virions can be represented by either RNA or DNA, and the replicationexpression cycles of RNA viruses can include a DNA intermediate and vice versa ( Figure 1 ) [11, 12] . Furthermore, the selfish elements with the smallest known genomes, the viroids, are autonomously replicating small non-coding RNAs [13] .",

The virus genome sizes is tightly linked to the genome structure and replication-expression strategy: the genomes that are larger than ~30 kb always consist of dsDNA, conceivably due to physical constraints on genome stability and topological malleability.

Thus, the water in the ocean is literally a virus solution with up to 10 9 virions/ml.

In each sequenced virome, the great majority of the sequences represent \"dark matter\", i.e. have no detectable homologs in the current databases, and there is no sign of saturation as sequencing progresses [4, 23, 24] . Although complete viral genomes typically contain a greater fraction of genes with homologs than viromes, these genomes also encompass numerous ORFans, i.e. genes that are restricted to a narrow virus group [25] . Analysis of the phyletic spread of bacteriophage genes using the Phage Orthologous Groups (POGs) has shown that an overwhelming majority of the POGs include a small number of phages and viruses of archaea, whereas none are represented in the majority of the analyzed genomes ( Figure 2 ) [26] . This seemingly unlimited diversity of virus genes contrasts the case of cellular organisms that include a substantial core of common genes [27] . Although precise estimates of the total gene pools of viruses and cellular organisms require better sampling and more sophisticated models of evolution than those currently available, it is almost certain that a majority of the distinct genes in the biosphere reside in viral genomes. Thus, viruses are likely to represent the principal reservoir of genetic diversity on earth.",

These \"viral hallmark genes\" encode the essential viral functions including the capsid protein of icosahedral viruses, RNA and DNA polymerases, distinct helicases involved in genome replication, integrases that catalyze insertion of viral DNA into host genomes, and several others ( Figure  3 ).

The parsimonious explanation of these findings appears to be that the hallmark genes became isolated from the cellular genomes at the earliest stages of evolution and ever since comprised the framework of the temporally and spatially continuous, expanding virus world. By contrast, the confinement of the hallmark genes to the virus world is hardly compatible with the escaped genes scenario. Furthermore, this \"ancient virus world\" hypothesis [12] implies the primordial origin of diverse viral replication-expression strategies as opposed to the derivation of these strategies from elements of cellular information processing systems. Specifically, positive-strand RNA, retrotranscribing, ssDNA and dsDNA virus-like elements all can be inferred to have evolved within the primordial gene pool. The dsRNA and negative-strand RNA viruses that carry their replication machinery within the virions are likely to have evolved later. In particular, negative-strand RNA viruses probably originated in animals, with a subsequent horizontal transfer to plant hosts [29] .",

Under this scenario, positive-strand RNA viruses are indeed direct descendants of the primordial RNA-protein world whereas the reverse-transcribing elements provide the means for the transition to the DNA world. The pre-cellular stage of evolution can be envisaged as a pool of small, virus-like genetic elements in which all the genomic strategies evolved and the separation between viruses and cellular life forms was precipitated by the gradual accretion of small dsDNA elements into large molecules ( Figure 4 ) (the nature of the primordial compartmentalization is beyond the scope of this article; several models have been developed). The capsids might have evolved at this stage of evolution and would protect genomes of the primordial genetic elements and facilitate their dissemination [12] . This model goes beyond the notion that viruses coexisted with cells at all stages of evolution by suggesting that evolution of life actually started with a virus-like stage, with the advent of modern-type cells being a comparatively late event [30].",

It has been argued that the fundamental divide among life forms lies between viruses, the capsidencoding organisms, and cellular, ribosome-encoding organisms [31] . A related concept of the capsid as the viral \"self\" is compatible with the extremely broad presence of the icosahedral virus capsid protein (the jelly roll fold) [32] in diverse viruses infecting bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes although numerous distinct capsid proteins exist as well [33] . Given the autonomy, vastness and diversity of the virus world, and its connectedness through the hallmark genes, the placement of the primary divide among life forms between viruses and cells appears unassailable. However, this division fails to give justice to the virus world that by no means is limited to typical capsid-encoding viruses. On the contrary, each of the major classes of viruses shows clear evolutionary connections to capsid-less genetic elements that are established through shared hallmark genes (and some additional genes) (Figures 3 and  4) .",

The most prominent case of the former direction includes reverse-transcribing elements and viruses. In this class, bona fide infectious viruses (animal retroviruses and hepadnaviruses, and plant pararetroviruses) represent only one of the several branches that were identified by phylogenetic analysis of the reverse transcriptases, the signature gene for this class [34] . Moreover, all prokaryotic reverse-transcribing elements are capsid-less, clearly indicating that retroviruses are derived forms. In addition, through the integrase, these elements are linked to the ubiquitous dsDNA transposons all of which are capsid-less. The rolling circle replicating ssDNA viruses show a clear-cut relationship with numerous plasmids that replicate via the same mechanism and with which they share two hallmark genes [35] . In the case of plant geminiviruses, evidence has been presented in support of a particular direction of evolution: these viruses appear to have emerged via recombination between a bacterial plasmid and a plant RNA virus [36] . The opposite direction of evolution is exemplified by the positive-strand RNA viruses that gave rise to at least three distinct groups of capsid-less RNA elements, the narnaviruses, the endornaviruses and the hypoviruses [37]. Thus, the virus world is not limited to \"capsid-encoding organisms\" but rather encompasses a panoply of diverse selfish genetic elements some of which do not possess a capsid. In full prudence, it would have been more appropriate to speak of the \"world of diverse selfish genetic elements\" but for the sake of brevity and for historical reasons as well, we stick with the original \"virus world\" designation [12] . Within the framework of the virus-like model of the primordial stage of life's evolution, capsid-less genetic elements most likely those capsid-encoding ones (Figure 4 ).",

This coevolution is often described as arms race [7] , and undoubtedly, this description reflects a key aspect of the interaction between the virus world and the cellular life forms. Indeed, all cellular organisms, with the exception of the most degraded intracellular parasitic bacteria, possess multilayered systems of antivirus defense, or more broadly defined, defense against invasion of foreign genetic material. Most if not all cellular organisms employ multiple principles of defense that include i) innate immunity, ii) adaptive immunity, iii) programmed cell death (induction of dormancy). Until recently, the two latter systems were considered eukaryotic innovations. However, the discovery of the prokaryotic system of heritable adaptive immunity, CRISPR-Cas Genes encoding defense system components occupy up to 10% of prokaryotic genomes [43] , and even greater fractions of the eukaryotic protein-coding gene complements. Importantly, the defense genes themselves, especially in prokaryotes, show remarkable mobility and often possess properties of selfish genetic elements. The prokaryotic TA systems are typically encoded in small, compact operons that are transferred on plasmids and show addictive properties, i.e. the toxin kills cells that lack the TA genes [46]. Restriction-modification systems, the principal innate immunity machinery in prokaryotes, similarly show mobile, selfish behavior [47] . Bacterial phage-defense islands, such as Staphylococcal pathogenicity islands (SaPIs), engage in a particularly striking form of selfish behavior. These defective prophage-like elements are excised from bacterial chromosmes, circularized and induced to replicate by helper phage infection with which they then interfere [48, 49] .",

The study of the counter-defense, especially in viruses of prokaryotes, is only starting in earnest, and undoubtedly, numerous novel mechanisms that target specific defense systems of the host remain to be discovered [53, 54] .

Even small viruses often encode dedicated counter-defense genes, such as RNA interference suppressors that were identified in numerous plant RNA viruses [56, 57] , whereas other small viruses encode dual function \"security proteins\" that counteract programmed cell death [58] . Thus, the coevolution of multiple layers of defense and counter-defense is immanent to virus-host interaction and hence to life itself. [59] [60] [61] .",

In both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, such functions involve DNA repair that, similar to defense, employs various nucleases and helicases. Another striking example is the recruitment of CRISPR-Cas for control of bacterial gene expression [62] . The extent of such conversion of defense systems in prokaryotes remains to be elucidated. In eukaryotes, conversion has taken truly dramatic forms. The quintessential eukaryotic regulation system, RNA interference, is thought to have evolved from an ancestral system of defense against RNA viruses [63] . Some of the key nucleases involved in RNA processing and degradation in eukaryotes evolved from prokaryotic toxin nucleases [64, 65] . Most of the proteins involved in DNA and protein (above all, histone) modification and chromatin remodeling in eukaryotes apparently evolved from prokaryotic ancestors that are involved in antivirus defense [66] . Thus, the entire phenomenon of epigenetic inheritance that is central to the eukaryotic life appears to be a derivative of antivirus defense systems. Moreover, under a plausible evolutionary scenario, the nucleus itself evolved as a defense device against prokaryotic self-splicing introns that invaded the proto-eukaryote genome to later give rise to spliceosomal introns [67, 68] . In the same vein, the mechanism of programmed cell death that is essential for normal development in plants and animals [69] originally evolved as a distinct strategy of antivirus defense (see above) that already implies a primitive form of cell differentiation. As generalized by Aravind and colleagues [64] , \"biological conflict systems served as evolutionary \"nurseries\" for innovations in the protein world\", and such innovations were central to major evolutionary transitions, in particular eukaryogenesis.",

Moreover, the majority of the genomic DNA in many animals and plants (up to two-thirds in humans and 90% in maize) appears to derive from mobile elements, primarily retrotransposons [76, 77] . Although most of these elements are non-functional, some are inevitably recruited for various roles, in particular regulatory ones, and given the extreme abundance of retroelements, the overall contribution of such recruitment appears to be quite substantial [9, 76] . Beyond these general trends, striking examples of key gene recruitment from selfish elements include the telomerase, an RT that is required from chromosome end replication in all eukaryotes and apparently was recruited from a bacterial Group II intron [34, 78] , and syncytins, membrane proteins that are essential for placental development in mammals and were derived from retrovirus envelope glycoprotein-encoding genes [79] .",

In a simple, unstructured host-parasite system, the inevitable outcome is stochastic extinction of both viruses and hosts. However, compartmentalization and, perhaps paradoxically, evolution of defense mechanisms stabilize the coevolving system as a whole [83] . Accordingly, cellular life forms evolved elaborate compartmentalization along with multiple defense strategies, embarking on the perennial arms race. Under this scenario, virus-like genomic parasites and the onset of the arms race far antedate the advent of modern-type cells and were key factors in the emergence of the cellular organization of life. Moreover, the first genomic parasites that consisted of RNA might have been the driving force behind the origin of DNA genomes because mathematical modeling suggests that dedicated information storage devices such as DNA can stabilize coevolution in a host-parasite system [86] .",

These findings show that all three major branches of antivirus defense are intrinsic to the survival of all cellular life forms and most likely emerged at the earliest stages of evolution (although innovation and diversification of these systems in multicellular eukaryotes are certainly spectacular). Moreover, comparative analysis of prokaryotic genomic loci encoding defense systems strongly suggests that the three branches of defense intimately interact, with cells \"making decisions\" to proceed either via the route of active immune response or via the route of damage control by programmed cell death, depending on the genotoxic stress level [42, 43]. Animal cells apparently face the same choices [44, 45].",
