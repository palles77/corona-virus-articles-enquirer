It occurs in biological systems such as spherical viruses, which utilize icosahedral symmetry as a guiding principle for the assembly of coat proteins into a capsid shell. In this study, we characterize the self-assembling protein nanoparticle (SAPN) system, which was inspired by such viruses. To facilitate self-assembly, monomeric building blocks have been designed to contain two oligomerization domains. An N-terminal pentameric coiled-coil domain is linked to a C-terminal coiled-coil trimer by two glycine residues. By combining monomers with inherent propensity to form five-and threefold symmetries in higher order agglomerates, the supposition is that nanoparticles will form that exhibit local and global symmetry axes of order 3 and 5. This article explores the principles that govern the assembly of such a system. Specifically, we show that the system predominantly forms according to a spherical core-shell morphology using a combination of scanning transmission electron microscopy and small angle neutron scattering. We introduce a mathematical toolkit to provide a specific description of the possible SAPN morphologies, and we apply it to characterize all particles with maximal symmetry. In particular, we present schematics that define the relative positions of all individual chains in the symmetric SAPN particles, and provide a guide of how this approach can be generalized to nonspherical morphologies, hence providing unprecedented insights into their geometries that can be exploited in future applications.",

Striking examples are spherical viruses, which usually have a protective protein shell (capsid or nucleocapsid) that is formed from its constituent protein building blocks by such a process (1) (2) (3) . An intriguing feature of this assembly mechanism is that some of these viruses do not require more than one type of capsid protein to fully encase their nucleic acid genome. The building blocks arrange themselves according to geometric constraints, and can form stable shapes with a high level of efficiency, maximizing container volume while minimizing the length of the genomic sequence required to code for it. In the design of artificial self-assembling nanoparticles, such as those discussed in this article, the same principle can be exploited, and building blocks engineered to have specific geometric properties can guide the efficient formation of nanoscale structures, allowing a level of control that could otherwise not be achieved with tools developed at the micro level (4) (5) (6) . Using protein oligomers and applying symmetry principles, King et al. (7, 8) have been able to engineer nanocages with atomic precision.",

This self-assembling protein nanoparticle (SAPN) has successfully been utilized as a vaccine for the presentation of epitopes, resulting in high immunogenicity, even in the absence of adjuvants (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) , and also for the design of other tools for nanobiotechnology applications (15, 16) .

The individual coiled-coil domains form long and thin structures that allow protein assembly around fivefold and the threefold local symmetry axes ( Fig. 1 B) . The original idea was that, in analogy to viral capsids, these domains should align along global five-and threefold symmetry axes, forming icosahedrally symmetric structures but maintaining a length that will not sterically hinder the formation of a spherical core-shell particle (Fig. 1 C) . We will consider here, more generally, spherical particles formed with any kind of three-dimensional (3D) symmetry, which exhibit the characteristic local three-and fivefold symmetry axes that SAPN particles are designed to form, and we also discuss how our approach could be generalized to model nonspherical morphologies. The self-assembly of these domains is governed by a combination of hydrophobic and ionic interactions present within the individual coiled-coil domains, as well as the symmetry constraints that determine the growth of the nanoparticle (17) (18) (19) .",

We address the following question: if one were to place single chains of the protein into a buffer, what are the symmetrically spherical relevant possibilities that can occur? Because the SAPN oligomerization domains are limited to those that form pentamers and trimers, the surface structures introduced by Caspar and Klug (2) in the framework of quasi-equivalence theory are not sufficient to model these structures.",

The scattered neutron intensity was obtained as a function of scattering vector, q, defined as \u00f04p=l\u00desin\u00f0q=2\u00de, where l and q are the neutron wavelength and scattering angle, respectively. The l and Dl/l were set to be 6 \u00c5 and 15%, respectively. We chose three sample/detector distances 1, 4, and 13 m to cover the q range from 0.004 to 0.4 \u00c5 \u00c01 . The raw scattering intensity was then normalized by the incident neutron flux and exposed sample volume to yield absolute intensity (23), I(q), which for particulate systems can be mathematically expressed as fDr 2 P(q)S(q), where f, Dr, P(q), and S(q) are the volume fraction of the particles, the neutron scattering length density's difference among the particles and the medium, the form factor, and the structure factor, respectively. Because the scattering lengths of hydrogen and deuterium are drastically different, to enhance contrast without changing the chemical properties, deuterium oxide (D 2 O) is commonly used to replace H 2 O. The form factor, P(q), is the square of the spatial Fourier transform of density function of the particle, containing the morphological information (e.g., size and shape) of the particles. The structure factor, S(q), is contributed by the interactions among particles. In this study, based on the self-assembly mechanism a polydisperse spherical shell (PSS) model derived by Hayter (24) was proposed to be used as P(q), while the SAPN is presumably dilute enough (minimal interparticle interaction), thus S(q) is assumed to be 1.",

The data reported below and less detailed analyses reported in these earlier articles show that the molecular weight of the assembled SAPNs and accompanying polymorphism of the sample varies depending on the sequence and the buffer conditions. Negative-stain TEM gave a visual impression of the SAPN-K heterogeneity ( Fig. 2; Fig. S1 in the Supporting Material). The particle projections vary in size, and although some are circular others are clearly elongated. The irregularly spaced protrusions at the edges of many projections indicate a degree of particle flexibility. A quantitative measure of particle heterogeneity was obtained by STEM. The single molecule mass measurement technique offered by STEM calculates the mass of freezedried unstained single particles (molecules) from their electron scattering power. Each mass value is directly linked to the projected image of the particular particle, allowing the projections to be classified according to the mass histogram and inspected (Figs. 3 A and S2). For SAPN-K the analysis confirmed the presence of different molecular species (Figs. 3 A and S2), allowed the average number of peptide chains present in each to be estimated ( Fig. 3 B) , and showed most particles to have essentially circular projections at the magnification employed (Figs. S2 and 3 B) compatible with, but not exclusive to, a spherical nature. The results in Fig. 3 C show that the measured particles maintain a high degree of circularity until a size of~360 chains, which indicates that they are most likely spherical. The data imply that there is a molecular-weight cutoff for the formation of spherical particles, and set the upper limit of possible symmetrically defined core-shell species to this particle size. This is consistent with viral shell morphologies: up to that number of capsid proteins (e.g., the T \u00bc 7d shell of polyoma virus) such shells appear mostly spherical, while for larger structures buckling leads to the occurrence of flat faces and an overall icosahedral shape, i.e., a change in the qualitative nature of the capsid architecture. In general, larger capsids require auxiliary components (such as scaffold proteins) to aid shell formation; because such additional features are absent here, it is perhaps not surprising that spherical shell morphologies cease to exist for larger chain numbers. The higher mass values (>5.6 MDa) in the histogram arose from some higher order molecularweight malformations and asymmetric aggregates (possibly tubular in nature), as well as simply from the close proximity of two lower mass nanoparticles (Fig. S2 ).",

Moreover, because SAPNs are designed to form clusters of 5 s and 3 s throughout, the geometry of the higher order assemblies cannot be modeled according to Caspar-Klug theory (3). In particular, these structures cannot be quasi-equivalent, and standard approaches for the modeling of higher order protein complexes, such as representations as Buckminster-Fuller architectures, do not apply. Therefore, we introduce here a classification scheme that allows us to determine the architectures of the spherical SAPN particles with more than 60 oligomers, focusing on particles corresponding to the lowest three peaks (Fig. 3 A) . We first study the connectivity of the network of polypeptides, using only the fact that they tend to aggregate in pentamers and trimers. Second, we focus on particles of maximal symmetry (tetrahedral, octahedral, and icosahedral), because these are likely to have almost-spherical shapes, and derive constraints for the number of polypeptides in each case. Strikingly, it turns out that particles with maximal symmetry lie within the first three peaks of the mass distribution function (Fig. 3 B) . Finally, we mimic the Caspar-Klug approach to find the optimal geometry of the high-symmetry particles. It is possible to extend this approach to describe particles with no or low symmetry, and we also discuss a nonspherical example, but the full classification of such nonspherical morphologies lies outside the scope of this article and will be discussed elsewhere.",

Hence, every lattice point (center of hexagon) contributes six proteins, with the exception of the points at the corners of the triangles that, due to the folding requirements, contribute only five proteins. Therefore, if p is the number of lattice points not lying at vertices of the triangles, then 6p is the total number of proteins contributed by hexamers.

To use the Caspar-Klug rule, we multiply this number by 6, thus obtaining the number of protein chains corresponding to the scenario that all pentagonal clusters are replaced by hexamers. Notice now that, in the octahedral and tetrahedral cases, the vertices of the triangles in the planar development are axes of order 4 and 3, respectively. Therefore the putative positions of the proteins have to be counted in multiples of 3 and 4, rather than 5 as in Caspar-Klug theory, around the corners of the triangular faces.

From a geometric perspective, the only factors limiting the assembly of non-epitope-bearing SAPN species are the oligomerization domains. This means that a matching rule exists, restricting the particle formation to include a packing geometry that has to account for the presence of pentameric and trimeric vertices. This connectivity constraint is compatible with a large variety of possible particles, but electron microscopy and small angle neutron scattering show that these species do indeed mainly exist as pseudo-spheres, so that we can restrict the analysis to particles with maximal symmetry, i.e., icosahedral, octahedral, and tetrahedral. In principle, the necessity for symmetry is based on the fact that SAPNs consist of homo-oligomers, which ideally align in an equidistant manner, with no one set of interactions between monomers being favored over another, resulting in a (nearly) uniform distribution of pentamers.",

Some elongation or aggregation occurred at higher molecular weights beyond 360 chains. In agreement, the SANS behavior of the SAPNs could be described by a spherical core-shell model (Fig. 4 A) . The possible spherical core-shell morphologies were determined using symmetry techniques and surface lattices, and it was shown that they are consistent with high-symmetry particles formed from 240, 300, and 360 chains, respectively, in accordance with the STEM data (Fig. 3) . By graph-theoretical techniques and a generalization of the Caspar-Klug construction to the case of SAPNs with different symmetries, the putative locations of the pentameric and trimeric domains on the nanoparticle surfaces were identified, and it was shown that both the 240-and the 300-chain particle are organized with tetrahedral symmetry, while the 360-chain particle displays icosahedral symmetry.",

In these cases the positions of the pentamers were determined with reference to a T \u00bc 7d icosadeltahedral geometry, but in the case of the SAPNs, there are trimeric clusters in addition. This is reflected in the choice of tiles in the surface tessellation; to represent SAPNs, we use rhombs and hexagons with vertices indicating alternatingly pentagonal and trimeric clusters and edges representing the links between them. By contrast, in the applications of viral tiling theory to viruses of that type, rhomb-and kite shapes were used to indicate the positions of individual proteins in the corners meeting at angles sustaining fivefold vertices, akin to protein positions in the corners of triangular faces in Caspar-Klug theory. We illustrate this in Fig. 5 B, where the tiling corresponding to the virus case is shown. Three juxtaposed rhombs highlight a global threefold (trimeric) axis, while five adjacent kites mark the positions of the global fivefold axes (pentamers). Local fivefold symmetry occurs at the intersections of two kites and three rhombs (shown in cyan-green). Hence, the trimer locations can be found at positions equidistant between three adjacent pentamers.",

For example, Pimentel et al. (9) reported a trimeric SARS epitope bearing SAPN species with 120 chains (determined using analytical ultracentrifugation; see Fig. 5 in that reference, which corresponds to a species of~110 monomers), and Yang et al. (28) reported a SAPN-R species with 180 chains (determined using STEM; see Fig. 3 in that reference, which corresponds to a species of~176 monomers). Both of the SAPN species were measured in the presence of 5% glycerol, which was utilized to increase buffer viscosity and reduce the size of aggregates. Therefore, it is hard to determine the influence of confounding factors such as epitopes or cosolutes (e.g., glycerol), on the native self-assembly equilibrium. The SAPN-K species used in this study was measured in the absence of epitope or glycerol, and should be a more accurate reflection of the assembly tendencies of covalently linked pentamer and trimer oligomerization domains.",

(B) A 360-chain SAPN is shown in comparison with the all-pentamer scaffold used in viral tiling theory to model the surface structure of polyomavirus, where five-coordinated vertices in the tiling mark the centers of the fivefold protein clusters. Putative trimer locations of the SAPN are superimposed as blue dots, given by the central positions of three triangulated pentameric vertices. The 12 icosahedral fivefold symmetry axes are shown in gold, while the pentameric vertices proposed by viral tiling theory are in cyan. The middle image demonstrates that the trimeric locations are equivalent to the vertices of a T \u00bc 7d icosadeltahedral particle in Caspar-Klug theory.
