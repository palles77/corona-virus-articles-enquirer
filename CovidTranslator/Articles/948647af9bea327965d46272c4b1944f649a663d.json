            "text": "Mink circovirus (MiCV), a virus that was newly discovered in 2013, has been associated with enteric disease. However, its etiological role in acute gastroenteritis is unclear, and its genetic characteristics are poorly described. In this study, the role of circoviruses (CVs) in mink acute gastroenteritis was investigated, and the MiCV genome was molecularly characterized through sequence analysis. Detection results demonstrated that MiCV was the only pathogen found in this infection. MiCVs and previously characterized CVs shared genome organizational features, including the presence of (i) a potential stem-loop/ nonanucleotide motif that is considered to be the origin of virus DNA replication; (ii) two major inversely arranged open reading frames encoding putative replication-associated proteins (Rep) and a capsid protein; (iii) direct and inverse repeated sequences within the putative 5\u02b9 region; and (iv) motifs in Rep. Pairwise comparisons showed that the capsid proteins of MiCV shared the highest amino acid sequence identity with those of porcine CV (PCV) 2 (45.4%) and bat CV (BatCV) 1 (45.4%). The amino acid sequence identity levels of Rep shared by MiCV with BatCV 1 (79.7%) and dog CV (dogCV) (54.5%) were broadly similar to those with starling CV (51.1%) and PCVs (46.5%). Phylogenetic analysis indicated that MiCVs were more closely related to mammalian CVs, such as BatCV, PCV, and dogCV, than to other animal CVs. Among mammalian CVs, MiCV and BatCV 1 were the most closely related. This study could contribute to understanding the potential pathogenicity of MiCV and the evolutionary and pathogenic characteristics of mammalian CVs.",

Their stool was thin or soft and watery. More than 2000 minks were owned by the cooperative in the reproduction period, and the same feed and immune procedures were used. A 5-year vaccination protocol against mink enteritis virus (MEV) and canine distemper virus (CDV) was completed. Fewer than 10 minks died after 1 week of illness, and most of those that died were malnourished. The other minks completely recovered within 5-7 days after showing clinical signs.

The primers and the PCR and RT-PCR conditions used to detect viral pathogens have been described elsewhere (Table 1) . PCR was performed as described previously to determine the full-length genome sequence of the newly identified MiCV strain, which we have named \"HEB15\" [20, 21] . The PCR product was analyzed via electrophoresis using an agarose gel and visualized by staining with ethidium bromide. The amplified product from the positive sample was 600 bp long. The complete genome was amplified from the positive sample obtained via PCR using the primers CV-3, CV-4, repF, and repL. The target DNA bands were extracted from the gel using a QIAGEN Gel Extraction Kit in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. The purified PCR products were cloned into the pMD18-T Simple vector (Takara, Japan), and the plasmids were introduced into E. coli DH5a using a standard transformation technique.

In the neighbor-joining tree, the MiCV strains were grouped with mammalian CV, which comprised BatCV 1, dogCV, and PCVs, and these were clearly separated from bird CVs. MiCVs were more closely related to PCV 1 and PCV 2 than to dogCV (Fig. 2a) . A phylogenetic analysis based on rep sequences (Fig. 2b) demonstrated that the two MiCV strains were grouped with BatCVs and were more closely related to dogCV than to PCV 1 and PCV 2.

These results were verified using the maximum-likelihood and maximumparsimony methods, which yielded the same tree topology (data not shown). MiCV circulated on mink farms in Dalian City, Liaoning Province, China, in 2013 [11] . Farmers observed disease in MEV-vaccinated minks in 1978. Clinical signs included diarrhea, lethargy, anorexia, pale muzzle, and unkempt fur. On farms with diseased minks, all of the animals were affected, and 70%-80% showed clinical signs. However, most of the animals recovered, and fewer than 10% of the affected minks died. MiCV was found in the liver, digestive tract, and fecal specimens of minks and was shown to be responsible for diarrhea [11] . However, its pathogenic role remains unknown, particularly its infection or coinfection process. In the present study, we investigated a major outbreak in a large population. Samples were tested for other causative agents, including MADV, MEV, CDV, coronavirus, calicivirus, rotavirus, bacterial pathogens, and parasites. After these pathogens were excluded, MiCV was detected alone, and was not found in combination with other key pathogens, such as MADV, MEV, and CDV. Thus, our findings suggested a possible association between MiCV and mink acute enteritis. Consistent with the detection results presented by Lian et al. [11] , our findings showed that the virus was located in the gut and feces. The virus was also found in the heart and kidney, but not in the liver.",

Moreover, the mink breed, disease symptoms, and disease duration differed. As such, the sustained direct transmission of MiCV among minks was excluded, and MiCV HEB15 was considered a new strain. The data gathered in this study expanded the known geographical distribution of MiCV. Unfortunately, the carcass of the MiCV-infected mink was not stored properly by the resident veterinarians and underwent repeated cycles of freezing and thawing, making it unsuitable for histopathological examination. For this reason, valuable information on tissue localization and alterations of MiCV could not be collected.

Only bootstrap support values greater than 60% are shown. The bar indicates the genetic distance. The sequence of the circovirus isolated in this study is indicated by a star. Other sequences were obtained from GenBank; accession numbers of those sequences are included in the tree to our knowledge of the pathogenic potential of MiCV and its association with mink enteritis if our results were corroborated by further reports. The presence of MiCV might help to explain the different disease outcomes and severity often observed in MADV-/MEV-infected animals. Our results indicate that minks with acute gastroenteritis should be screened for MiCV and established pathogens, such as E. coli and MEV. This study was conducted to identify the viral agents associated with acute diarrhea in minks, and no attempt was made to determine the primary cause of death.",

Current surveillance methods are limited to viral detection using molecular assays, and no seroprevalence information is available. As a consequence, the identification and characterization of the virus depends on genetic approaches such as PCR and sequence determination and analysis. In this study, the nucleotide sequence of the MiCV genome was determined and analyzed. Our results showed that the genome sequence of MiCV isolate HEB15 was highly similar to that of MiCV DL13 in terms of size (1753 nt), nucleotide sequence (99.66% identity), and ORF analysis. The examination of other MiCV sequences from different regions will help to assess the level of genetic diversity. In our study, sequence analysis confirmed that MiCV genomes displayed the characteristics of members of the genus Circovirus, and the common features included their genome organization, the presence of a potential stem-loop and conserved nonanucleotide motif postulated to be the origin of viral DNA replication, and major ORFs and repeats [26, 27] . Conserved amino acid motifs, including WWDGY, DDFYGWLP, and DRYP, which have unknown functions, were also recognized within Rep associated with RCR and dNTPase activity. These motifs could be utilized to design primers that could amplify CV-specific DNA for discovery of new CVs in other hosts.",
