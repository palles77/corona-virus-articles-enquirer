Over time, bacteria (good and bad) and many other classes of microbes were discovered, but viruses were too small to be seen even with the most efficient light microscopes. Filters were devised that would retain bacteria and other microbes, but under some circumstances the filtrates were found capable of causing disease. This led to the term filterable virus; 'virus' came from classic Latin for a cause of disease (implicitly more a poison than an infectious agent)it had no plural and no explicit definition, since causes of disease were poorly understood until recently. The first viruses described were the ones that caused mosaic disease of tobacco and another that caused foot-and-mouth disease in animals. Inevitably, viruses of human disease were also detected; but because they could not be cultivated in the laboratory, their incrimination as pathogens required indirect investigations.",

Vectors are living things, often insects: If they propagate the virus, they are biological vectors; if they simply carry the virus from place to place, they are mechanical vectors. A fomes (plural, fomites) is an inanimate object, such as a shared towel. Vehicles are water or food. Environmental virology first focused on insects, fomites, and water. However, some early reports indicated that viruses could also be transmitted by foods.",

We now know that polioviruses do not infect cattle, so the milk was probably contaminated from milkers' hands soiled with their feces. The poliovirus would have been inactivated if the milk had been pasteurized, but machine milking affords a relatively certain means of preventing poliovirus contamination of the milk, whereby this particular foodborne virus risk is now negligible in developed countries. A seminal outbreak report from Sweden showed that oysters subject to human fecal contamination could transmit hepatitis. Much has since been learned regarding the ability of bivalve mollusks to concentrate virus selectively from environmental water as they feed by filtration, retain the virus, and infect people who eat the shellfish raw. Although any food mishandled by an infected person may serve as a vehicle for virus, shellfish are the only vehicle that can selectively concentrate virus.",

Hepatitis A continues as a significant foodborne virus, even though effective vaccines have been available for over a decade; these await full implementation. Some outbreaks previously attributed to hepatitis A virus (HAV) are now known to have been caused by hepatitis E virus (HEV). However, the great gap in foodborne disease recording in developed countries, where such instances are investigated, has long been 'gastroenteritis of unknown etiology.' A possible case in point occurred at an international y Deceased conference of experts, entitled Microbiological Quality of Foods that was held at Franconia, New Hampshire, 27-29 August, 1962 . According to the late Gail M. Dack, PhD, MD, then Director of the University of Chicago's Food Research Institute, a large number of the experts in attendance were stricken with vomiting and diarrhea, with onset times too long for staphylococcal enterotoxin poisoning. Some had onsets of illness while they were on planes going home -Dr Dack described the situation with three or more gastroenteritis victims on a plane with only two washrooms. He managed to bring some samples back to the Food Research Institute, where neither enterotoxin nor virus was detected by the methods available at that time. Since 2000, it has been amply shown that the majority of such outbreaks, and probably the majority of foodborne illnesses in developed countries, are caused by noroviruses, whose detection was hampered by their inability to replicate in laboratory cell cultures.",

Application of detection methods to enhance food safety entails applying them either in surveys to determine the general prevalence of human enteric viruses in specific foods or in monitoring foods to determine their virologic safety. Monitoring presents important problems in that samples are seldom truly representative of the batch from which they are derived, and only a very small quantity of sample is actually tested by a molecular method. Since viruses cannot be enriched from food samples, concentration methods have been developed; these do not increase the quantity of virus obtained from the original sample.

An indicator, in this context, might be any agent (or even substance) whose presence in food samples is easily demonstrated and is correlated with viral contamination. The rationale is that enteric viruses are present only if fecal contamination has occurred, so any indicator of fecal contamination may suggest the presence of viruses. Easiest to detect are fecal pigments or fecal bacteria, but these have very low specific correlation with viruses. Coliphages (viruses that infect enteric bacteria) have what might be a closer ecologic relationship to enteric viruses but have not shown good correlation. Human enteric viruses that can express themselves in cell culture (vaccine polioviruses, adenoviruses, etc.) offer some attractions, but they are likely only to be present in food that has been contaminated with community fecal material, rather than by an individual food worker.

In the case of human enteric viruses, prevention depends ultimately on keeping human feces, in any quantity or dilution, out of food. This would also prevent a great many other foodborne diseases, but human behavior still occasionally results in direct or indirect fecal contamination, so the quest for a valid CCP is likely to lead to efforts to eliminate the contaminant. Physical removal of viral contaminants from shellfish is one of the objectives of depuration and re-laying; the effectiveness of these techniques in removing viruses is still being evaluated.

The nucleic acid contains all the information needed for the virion to enter a susceptible host cell and direct production of progeny virus by the cell. The coat protein (capsid) protects the viral nucleic acid while out in the environment and combines specifically with a receptor on the host cell to induce engulfment of the virion by the cell and initiation of the infectious cycle. The capsid is also the antigen to which hosts respond by producing antibody; although this property has no known function in the viral infectious cycle, antibody evoked by infection or immunization will often limit or prevent infection by the target virus. Replication (especially RNA-dependent RNA replication) is highly error-prone, so that many progeny virions are probably noninfectious by reason of defects in the information the nucleic acid contains. The majority of progeny virions are probably infectious, but they have very little functional redundancy, so that almost any change in any part of the virus is likely to result in inactivation (loss of infectivity). The durability of enteric viruses, which enables their transmission via the environment, resides principally in the capsidsimilar respiratory viruses often have nearly identical nucleic acid organization but much more labile capsids.

Compared to many other viruses, enteric viruses are relatively heat resistant: HAV levels in raw milk were reduced as little as one log by standard pasteurization. However, none of the enteric viruses will withstand boiling, and lesser temperatures are effective over appropriate periods of time. Chemicals and UV are effective against viruses in water or on exposed surfaces, but not in the interior of a food. This means that true CCPs are likely to be based on cooking or thermal processing, which is sometimes precluded by gastronomic considerations. For these reasons, consumption of uncooked foods must always entail some virus risk, unless it can be absolutely proven that fecal contamination has been prevented. On the other hand, thermal processes for most foods (at home or in commerce) that will guarantee inactivation of any virus that may yet be present are still awaiting validation. The fact that the noroviruses and hepatitis viruses do not infect laboratory host systems places a great premium on development of other methods to test these viruses and show whether they have lost infectivity. Some modes of inactivation (e.g., UV) that cause breaks or cross-links in the viral nucleic acid may yield negative tests by molecular methods, but only if the disruption occurs in the segment that is targeted for amplification by the selected primers.",
