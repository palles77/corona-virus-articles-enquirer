Bats are natural reservoirs of a large variety of viruses, including many important zoonotic viruses that cause severe diseases in humans and domestic animals. However, the understanding of the viral population and the ecological diversity residing in bat populations is unclear, which complicates the determination of the origins of certain EIDs. Here, using bats as a typical wildlife reservoir model, virome analysis was conducted based on pharyngeal and anal swab samples of 4440 bat individuals of 40 major bat species throughout China. The purpose of this study was to survey the ecological and biological diversities of viruses residing in these bat species, to investigate the presence of potential bat-borne zoonotic viruses and to evaluate the impacts of these viruses on public health. The data obtained in this study revealed an overview of the viral community present in these bat samples. Many novel bat viruses were reported for the first time and some bat viruses closely related to known human or animal pathogens were identified. This genetic evidence provides new clues in the search for the origin or evolution pattern of certain viruses, such as coronaviruses and noroviruses. These data offer meaningful ecological information for predicting and tracing wildlife-originated EIDs.",

Approximately 60%-80% of human EIDs originate from wildlife, as shown by the typical examples of hemorrhagic fever, avian influenza and henipavirus-related lethal neurologic and respiratory diseases that originated from rodents, wild birds and bats (Jones et al., 2008; Wolfe et al., 2007; Lloyd-Smith et al., 2009; Marsh and Wang, 2012; Smith and Wang, 2013) . The primary issues associated with the prevention and control of EIDs are how to quickly identify the pathogen, determine where it originated and control the chain of transmission. These issues, along with the limited knowledge of the viral population and ecological diversity of wildlife, complicate the study of EIDs. Therefore, meaningful information afforded by the understanding of the viral community present in wildlife, as well as the prevalence, genetic diversity and geographical distribution of these viruses, is very important for the prevention and control of wildlife-borne EIDs Daszak et al., 2000) .",

Metagenomic analysis was then conducted to screen the viromes of these samples. Here we outline the viral spectrum within these bat samples and the basic ecological and genetic characteristics of these novel bat viruses. The identification of novel bat viruses in this study also provides genetic evidence for cross-species transmission between bats or between bats and other mammals.

Briefly, the samples were centrifuged at 10 000 g for 10 min at 4\u00b0C. Supernatant from each sample was filtered through a 0.45-\u03bcm polyvinylidene difluoride filter (Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany), to remove eukaryotic and bacterial-sized particles. The filtered samples were then centrifuged at 100 000 g for 3 h at 4\u00b0C. The pellets were re-suspended in Hank's balanced salt solution. To remove naked DNA and RNA, the re-suspended pellet was digested in a cocktail of DNase and RNase enzymes, including 14 U of Turbo DNase (Ambion, Austin, TX, USA), 20 U of benzonase (Novagen, Darmstadt, Germany) , and 20 U of RNase One (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) at 37\u00b0C for 2 h in 1 \u00d7 DNase buffer (Ambion). The viral nucleic acids were then isolated using a QIAmp MinElute Virus Spin Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA). Viral first-strand cDNA was synthesized using the primer K-8N (5\u2032-GACCATCTAGCGACCT CCAC-NNNNNNNN-3\u2032) and a Superscript III system (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). To convert firststrand cDNA into double-stranded DNA, the cDNA was incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 h in the presence of 5 U of Klenow fragment (NEB, Ipswich, MA, USA) in 1 \u00d7 NEB buffer 2 (final volume of 25 \u03bcl). Sequenceindependent PCR amplification was conducted using 1 \u03bcM primer K (5\u2032-GACCATCTAGCGACCT CCAC-3\u2032) and 0.5 U Phusion DNA polymerase (NEB). The PCR products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. A DNA smear of larger than 500 bp was excised and extracted with a MinElute Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen).",

Reads with no hits in NT or NR were further assembled using the Velvet software (v1.2.10, Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center, Pittsburgh, PA, USA) and the contigs were again aligned with NT and NR to identify any viruses that were present. The taxonomies of the aligned reads with the best BLAST scores (E-value o10 \u2212 5 ) from all lanes were parsed and exported with MEGAN 4-MetaGenome Analyzer . Besides the alignment-first analytical strategy, we also tested assembly-first strategy to analyze the sequence data. The reads were firstly assembled by metagenomics assemblers (for example, MetaVelvet and IDBA-UD) (Namiki et al., 2012; Peng et al., 2012) and the output contigs were then aligned to NT and NR. As the percentage of viral reads was small in the whole data sets and most of the assembled contigs were thus of bacterial and host origins, the assembly-first strategy generally had lower sensitivity than the alignmentfirst strategy in this study.",

One BtCoV, BtHp-BetaCoV/ZJ2013, represented a separate clade related to lineage B. The overall nt identity of this CoV genome with lineage-B CoVs was only 58% and the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and S proteins shared only 78% and 41% aa identities with those of lineage-B CoVs. This CoV contained an unusual putative S-related ORF2 between ORF1ab and the S gene (Supplementary Figure S4 and Supplementary Table S3 ) (Quan et al., 2010) . A signal peptide (1-13 aa) and a transmembrane region (413-435 aa) were identified in the S-related ORF2, suggesting that this protein might be a surface protein. The remaining 15 BtCoVs were all assigned to the genus Alphacoronavirus and formed many novel separate clades. For BtMr-AlphaCoV/SAX2011 and BtNv-AlphaCoV/SC2013, although the phylogenetic tree constructed based on RNA-dependent RNA polymerase indicated that these two viruses were clustered with HKU10, the phylogenetic tree based on the S protein indicated that these two viruses represented two separate clades far from other CoVs, suggesting that recombination may occur in their genomes.

Bat paramyxoviruses (BtParaVs) were separately identified in 9 bat species from 10 provinces of China (Supplementary Table S2 and Supplementary Figure S1 ). The full-length sequence of 3 viruses (BtMf-ParaV/AH2011, BtMl-ParaV/ QH2013 and BtHa-ParaV/GD2012) were almost completely determined (Supplementary Figure S9 and Supplementary Table S6 ) and 11 other viruses were partially or completely sequenced in the L gene. Twelve of the 14 novel BtParaVs identified in the different bat species could be clustered together and formed a separate phylogenetic clade. Alternatively, these BtParaVs could be classified into a potential separate genus, Shaanvirus, with BtMf-ParaV/AH2011 and BtMl-ParaV/QH2013 as prototypes. The genomic organizations of these two viruses were similar to those of three previously reported members of the genus Jeilongvirus. However, the genomes of BtMs-ParaV/Anhui2011 and BtMl-ParaV/QH2013 were shorter in length than those of the three rodent viruses and the sequence identities were low (Supplementary Table S5 ). The remaining two novel BtParaVs could be clustered together with Rubulaviruses as new species (Figure 3c . The central domain of the N protein contained three conserved motifs common to all paramyxoviruses, and the six conserved domains within the L proteins of the order Mononegavirales (Lau et al., 2010) could be found in all three fulllength sequenced viruses.",

Clade 3 contained two sub-clades formed by four BtPicoVs of two bat genera. Clade 2 was formed by two BtPicoVs identified in different bat genera and clustered in a sister relationship with the genus Sapelovirus. Clade 4 contained two BtPicoVs identified in the same bat genus that were closely related to the genus Kobuvirus. The previously reported Miniopterus schreibersii PicoV-1 was closely related to the genera Cardiovirus and Senecavirus. Two BtPicoVs, BtRf-PicoV-2/YN2012 and BtMf-PicoV-1/SAX2011, showed lower aa identities with other known PicoVs. Different BtPicoVs identified from the same bat genus, such as Rhinolophus or Miniopterus, in different locations showed very close genetic relationships.

Bat parvoviruses (BtPVs) and bat bocaviruses were identified in nine bat species from eight provinces (Supplementary   Table S2 and Supplementary Figure S1 ). In addition to viruses in the genera Bocavirus, Parvovirus and Amdovirus, four BtPVs were most similar to the recently reported human Bufavirus members and the bufavirus-related WUHARV parvovirus, with similar NS1 and VP1 proteins (higher than 60% aa identities) (Phan et al., 2012; Yahiro et al., 2014) . BtHp-PV/GD2012, in the genus Parvovirus, was very closely related to a recently identified rat PV, with 89% aa identity (Figure 4b) . The aa identities among the predicted VP1 proteins of these BtPVs and bat bocaviruses, and other known members of the subfamily Parvovirinae, are shown in Supplementary Table S8 . Bat adeno-associated viruses have been described previously (Li et al., 2010b) ; however, considering the nonpathogenic nature of adeno-associated viruses, we did not perform further verification of these viruses.",

Two bat virome analyses conducted by Li et al. (2010a) and Donaldson et al. (2010) have revealed the presence of CoVs, herpesviruses, PicoVs, CVs, adenoviruses, adeno-associated viruses and astroviruses in some bat species of North America. One bat virome analysis conducted by Ge et al. (2012) mainly described insect viruses in some bat species of China. One bat virome analysis conducted by Ng et al. (2013) has revealed the presence of a novel rhabdovirus in big brown bats, and one bat virome analysis conducted by He et al. (2013) has described the spectrum of viruses harbored by several bat species in Myanmar. Different from these previous reports, this study was the first to characterize the pharyngeal and anal virome of representative bat samples in China. We did not perform additional verification of non-mammalian viruses because of the association of the abundance of these viruses (not initially harbored in bats) with their life habits. This report suggests that bats harbor a large spectrum of mammalian viruses. Except for a few viruses, such as BtCalVs, BtCVs and BtPVs, which are closely related to known viruses, most of the bat viruses identified here that were widely distributed . These findings reveal that these three bat genera may act as major reservoirs for diverse mammalian viruses in China. Notably, all bats collected in this study were considered to be apparently healthy and showed no overt signs of disease, further confirming that bats can tolerate diverse viruses through their unique metabolic and immune systems (O'Shea et al., 2014) .",

The diverse BtCoVs were grouped into several novel evolutionary clades that significantly differed from those of all known \u03b1and \u03b2-CoVs, providing additional evidence to support investigations of the evolution of bat-originated CoVs. With regard to BtParaVs, a previous study has revealed that bats host major mammalian ParaVs in the genera Rubulavirus, Morbillivirus, Henipavirus and the subfamily Pneumovirinae (Drexler et al., 2012) . However, in this study, except for 2 viruses assigned to the genus Rubulavirus, the remaining 12 viruses formed a new genus distant from the known genera and the 14 identified BtParaVs showed no direct relationship with the known human or animal pathogens of the family Paramyxoviridae. These results suggest an entirely different distribution of BtParaVs in China than previously reported. Although the classifications of bat herpesviruses, bat papillomaviruses, bat retroviruses, bat astroviruses, bat adenoviruses, BtPicoVs, BtCVs, BtPVs and bat bocaviruses were extended according to the current virus taxonomy file released by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses, the large number of novel viruses grouped into the various evolutionary clades identified in this study further expand the taxa to include many new viral genera and species. Many new clades formed by BtCVs distinct from all known members of the genera Circovirus and Cyclovirus could be candidates for many new genera. Viruses related to henipaviruses, Ebola virus, rabies virus and pathogenic bunyaviruses were not detected in the Chinese bat species examined in this study.",

These phenomena indicate that certain bat-originated DNA and RNA viruses have the potential for intra-or cross-species transmission concomitant with the migration, co-roosting and intra-or inter-species contact of their bat hosts. The identification of some viruses, such as certain rat PV-related BtPV, norovirus-related BtCalVs, human or swine CV-related BtCVs and bat rotavirus in the rotavirus A group, also provides a new understanding of the evolution of these viruses in different mammalian hosts and possible transmission events that occur between bats and other hosts. Furthermore, BtCoVs had more distinctive features than the other bat viruses. Highly diverse S genes or ORF8s were present in particular CoVs carried by bats of the same species from different locations or even the same gathering place. Considering the diversity of CoVs, co-infections may create opportunities for recombination and the emergence of new CoVs that are able to adapt to new hosts. These findings may explain why tracing the potential CoV-related EIDs in insectivorous bats is often complicated by the presence of diverse key genomic segments and no virus with an identical genome sequence related to the pathogens causing human or animal EIDs has been identified in insectivorous bats. Instead, the origin of the Ebola virus and henipaviruses could be relatively easily confirmed by the identification of identical viruses in frugivorous bats (Calisher et al., 2006; Leroy et al., 2005; Smith and Wang, 2013) .",

These data indicate that human SARS-CoVs most likely originated through zoonotic transfer, either directly or indirectly, from Chinese horseshoe bats via a complicated adaptation process and a series of rare recombination events.Although the transmission of MERS-CoV has been confirmed by the detection of identical MERS-CoV sequences in dromedary camels and humans (Azhar et al., 2014; Chu et al., 2014; Meyer et al., 2014) , the zoonotic transmission of this virus from dromedaries to humans is still considered to be rare (Hemida et al., 2015) and the wildlife source of MERS-CoVs remains unknown. The data obtained here and a recently reported lineage-C BtCoV, NeoCoV, identified by another group (Corman et al., 2014a; Yang et al., 2014a) provide new clues about the sources and pathways of human-and camel-derived MERS-CoVs in bats of the family Vespertilionidae. Bat species of this family may have important roles in MERS-CoV evolution (Yang et al., 2014b) . Furthermore, the diverse S genes of these MERSrelated CoVs may provide an opportunity for their recombination to ultimately generate new CoVs.In conclusion, the understanding of the viral community characteristics, genetics and ecological distribution of bat viruses could enable the rapid identification of novel viruses with variant genomes and could thus facilitate the tracing of EIDs in bats. Furthermore, this strategy could be extended to other wildlife or livestock worldwide, ultimately increasing knowledge of the viral population and ecological community, thus minimizing the impact of potential wildlife-originated EIDs on public health by providing meaningful basic data.",
