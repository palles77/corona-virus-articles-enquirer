Mice were killed at intervals up to 18 days after inoculation, and their tissues were examined for the presence of 5{HV antigen by indirect immunofluorescence. Two patterns of infection were apparent. Prototype MHV strains 1, 3, A59, JHM, S and uncharacterized MHV strMns Tettnang and wt-1 produced a respiratory pattern, in which nose and lung were consistently involved with dissemination to other organs in a vascular distribution. Pulmonary vascular endothelium and alveolar septal cells, but not airway epithelium, were infected. An enteric pattern was observed with MHV-Y and wt-2 in which N H V antigen was largely restricted to the nose and bowel, with limited dissemination to other abdominal organs but not lung. Intestinal lesions in these mice were severe compared to those manifesting the respiratory pattern of infection. These results indicate that, like coronaviruses of other species, different, strains of MHV possess different primary and secondary organotropisms following a natural route of inoculation in a susceptible host.",

Different strains of coronavirus from a single host species, such as man, can have either respiratory or enteric tropism (25) . Laboratory mice are commonly infected with mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), a singular name which actually represents many strains that can be partially differentiated biologically or antigenically. MHV has served as a model for the molecular biology of coronaviruses, viral hepatitis, encepha~ litis and demyelination, as well as a model for genetic and age-related resistance to viral disease (2, 21, 23, 25, 31) . MHV can cause significant clinical disease in mice (4) or a number of more subtle but equally significant effects, including modified immune responsiveness (27, 36) , an effect upon tumor kinetics (1, 7, 12, 20, 22) and effects upon macrophage function (6, 34) which can negate the research usefulness of the infected animal.",

Selective organotropism of certain MHV strains, such as neurotropism and hepatotropism, has been demonstrated (23, 25, 31) . However, true differences between MHV strains are difficult to assess, since in most studies, virus has been inoculated by artifical routes, only a few target organs have been examined and mice of different ages, genotypes and microbial status have been used. In the present report, we compare patterns of tissue tropism following intranasal inoculation of pathogen-free mice with several prototype and uncharacterized MHV strains under otherwise identical conditions.

This form of infection was associated with mucosal necrosis, hyperplasia and inflammation. MHV antigen was found in one or more lymphoretieular organs in mice of all groups and bone marrow of many mice. Foci of MttV antigen were evident in the thymic medulla and only rarely cortex, peripheral lymph nodes or lymph nodes draining abdominal organs (hepatic and/or mesenteric). The splenic white pulp and loci of red pulp generally contained few MI-IV antigen-positive cells. Lymphocytic necrosis and occasional syncytia were seen in these organs. Bone marrow involvement was focal but present in many bones. MHV antigen was seen in hematopoeitic cells including megakaryocytes. 1VIHV antigen was not observed in bone marrow of MFIV-Y or wt-2-infeeted mice.",

Hepato-and neurotropism following intraperitoneal and intracranial inoculation of MHV have been emphasized in the literature (21, 23, 25, 31) , providing little insight into pathogenesis following natural routes of infection. This study suggests that strains of MHV produce two basic patterns of infection, respiratory and enteric, following intranasal inoculation. Secondary involvement of other organs, such as liver, brain, bone marrow and lymphoid organs, is common in a susceptible host such as the neonate. Coronaviruses of other species also manifest these two primary patterns, often with secondary invoIvement of other organs (25) .",

Lesions or antigen have also been shown in the nasal mueosa of mice infected with MHV-S and J H M (3, 11, 33) and lungs of mice inoculated with MHV-t, A59, MHV-S and JtIM (3, 9) . Endothelial syncytia have been described in the pulmonary vaseulature of athymie nude (nu/nu) mice (13) . In lungs, MHV antigen is restricted to vascular endothelium and unidentified alveolar septai cells. The lung is therefore probably important in clearance or dissemination of virus within the host, rather than as a route of virus excretion. Weanling Swiss mice inoculated intranasally with MtIV-S have lesions, viral antigen and infectious virus in the nose and lung early in the course of infection, with occasional dissemination to other organs at later intervals (3) . The findings reported here and previously (3) suggest that the bowel pla, ys a minimal role in virus replication and excretion with MHV strains which cause the respiratory syndrome.",

Tropism for any organ, tissue or cell type depends not only on virus strain and passage history, but on route of inoculation, host age and genotype as well. For example, MHV A59 did not infect nervous tissue in this study or as an original isolate (22) , but others have shown A59 neurotropism (19) . Temperaturesensitive mutants of neurotropic JHM may have selective tropisms for glia, while parental (wild type) JHM replicates in both neurons and glia (11). Different patterns of brain lesions occur with MHV-3 in different mouse genotypes (35) . Both MHV-S and JHM were markedly neurotropic in the present study, a feature which was obvious when both of these strains were first isolated (10, 26) . Furthermore, direct extension of MHV from the nose to the olfactory bulbs has been described only with these two strains (3, 14, 33) , an observation which we have reproduced here.",
