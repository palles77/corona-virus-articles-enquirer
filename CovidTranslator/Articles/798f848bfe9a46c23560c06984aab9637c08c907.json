Comparative analysis of the frameshift region reveals a universal shift site U _ UUA _ AAC, followed by a predicted downstream RNA structure in the form of either a pseudoknot or kissing stem loops. Frameshifting in SARS-CoV has been characterized in cultured mammalian cells using a dual luciferase reporter system and mass spectrometry. Mutagenic analysis of the SARS-CoV shift site and mass spectrometry of an affinity tagged frameshift product confirmed tandem tRNA slippage on the sequence U _ UUA _ AAC. Analysis of the downstream pseudoknot stimulator of frameshifting in SARS-CoV shows that a proposed RNA secondary structure in loop II and two unpaired nucleotides at the stem I-stem II junction in SARS-CoV are important for frameshift stimulation. These results demonstrate key sequences required for efficient frameshifting, and the utility of mass spectrometry to study ribosomal frameshifting. D",

This programmed ribosomal frameshifting is an essential mechanism governing expression of a subset of viral and cellular genes (Baranov et al., 2003; Namy et al., 2004; Stahl et al., 2002) . One example is in coronaviruses, where a fixed portion of the ribosomes translating orf1a change reading frame at a specific location to decode information contained in orf1b. This translational event is essential for the synthesis of viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and other replication components, as orf1b lacks its own independent site for translation initiation. This simple mechanism for gene expression ensures that product of orf1b is expressed at specific levels relative to the product of orf1a.",

Significant differences in these key elements suggest that multiple forms of pseudoknots with differences in both secondary and ternary structures can be active frameshift stimulators. For the Mouse Mammary Tumor Virus (MMTV) pseudoknot, there is a single unpaired adenine that separates stem I from stem II. This adenine is reported to be responsible for a bend between the 0042-6822/$ -see front matter D 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. doi:10.1016/j.virol.2004.11.038 two stems and it has been proposed that this adenine and the resulting bent conformation are essential for frameshift stimulation (Chen et al., 1995 (Chen et al., , 1996 Kang and Tinoco, 1997; Kang et al., 1996) . Similarly, there is a single unpaired adenine between stems I and II in simian retrovirus type-1 (SRV-1) pseudoknot. However, unlike MMTV, altering the nucleotide in this position and the corresponding base across the stem to be either paired or unpaired does not have a dramatic effect on the efficiency of frameshifting (Sung and Kang, 1998) . The crystal structure of the Beet Western Yellow Virus (BWYV) frameshift pseudoknot reveals several significant structural features. Notably, adenine-rich loop II forms extensive hydrogen bond interactions with stem I, and a base-triple is formed between an unpaired cytosine in loop II and stem I . Mutagenic studies demonstrated that these interactions are critical for frameshifting efficiency (Kim et al., 1999) .",

The reporter plasmid, containing the Renilla and firefly luciferase genes on either side of a multiple cloning site, can be expressed in transiently transfected tissue culture cells via the SV40 promoter (Grentzmann et al., 1998) . Sequences containing wild type and mutant variants of SARS-CoV frameshift site cassettes ( Fig. 2A) were cloned between the two reporter genes. Constructs were designed such that the downstream firefly luciferase gene is in the \u00c01 reading frame and can be translated only if frameshifting occurs. The dual luciferase reporter constructs were then transiently transfected into cultured HEK293 cells grown in 96-well plates as described in Materials and methods. After 48 h of growth, cell lysates were prepared, and each luciferase activity was sequentially measured using an automated luminometer. Efficiency of frameshifting was calculated as the difference in firefly luciferase activities normalized to Renilla luciferase expression (See Materials and methods). Values are shown as a percentage of the SARS-CoV wildtype frameshifting levels. Frameshifting efficiencies are standardized to wildtype due to our observation that although relative changes in frameshifting levels remain consistent from experiment to experiment, the absolute frameshifting values can vary depending in part on the condition of the cultured cells (one factor is passage number). By standardizing frameshifting values to the absolute wildtype frameshifting levels observed in the same experiment, this experiment to experiment variation is corrected. Absolute values for frameshifting efficiency at the wild type SARS-CoV and IBV recoding sites across all experiments was 15 F 3% and 12 F 3% in HEK293 cells, respectively.",

The difference between IBV and SARS-CoV sequences 5V of canonical shift site suggests that an alternative overlapping frameshift site may be used. In SARS-CoV, the first four nucleotides of the U _ UUA _ AAC heptanucleotide shift site overlaps with a putative shift site G _ UUU _ UUA on which tandem slippage is hypothetically possible. To check whether frameshifting occurs on this second shift site, several mutations of the U _ UUA _ AAC heptanucleotide sequence and 5Vflanking sequences were tested. Changes of the two nucleotides upstream of the standard heptanucleotide motif did not reduce frameshifting efficiency ( Fig. 2B ; FS3-FS6), demonstrating that the G _ UUU _ UUA sequence does not contribute significantly to frameshifting. In fact, changing the nucleotide located 5V of the heptanucleotide shift site from a U to an A increases frameshifting efficiency by 1.6-fold relative to the wildtype levels ( Fig. 2; FS3 ). Bertrand et al. (2002) reported that the identity of the adjacent 3Vnucleotide can significantly impact frameshifting efficiency on the A _ AAA _ AAG shift site in Escherichia coli. In addition, nucleotides within the spacer region have potential to form base pairs with strand I of stem II or nucleotides in strand II of stem II and adjacent 3V nucleotides. Either interaction may disrupt the predicted pseudoknot structure. Interrupting this potential interaction by changing the three nucleotides downstream of the shift site in SARS-CoV had no significant effect on frameshifting levels ( Fig. 2A ; FS7 and FS8), suggesting that the identity of spacer region is not critical for frameshift stimulation.",

Mutagenic analysis of the SARS-CoV stem I and stem II was undertaken to determine critical features for ribosomal frameshifting (Fig. 3A) . Disruption of stem I or II independently reduced frameshifting efficiency 10-to 20fold ( Fig. 3B ; SARSPK1, 3, and 5), equivalent to levels at which ribosomal frameshifting occurs at the \u00c01 slippery sequence in the absence of any stimulators. Restoration of the pseudoknot by bstrand switchingQ, which converts G:C, G:U, and A:U pairing to C:G, U:G, and U:A pairing, respectively ( Fig. 3A ; SARSPK4), of stem I restored frameshift levels to 180% of wildtype (Fig. 3B ). Changing the 5V half of stem I in SARSPK4 to the complementary sequence ( Fig. 3A ; SARSPK4-1) reduced frameshifting levels to 40% of wildtype ( Fig. 3B) suggesting that sequence as well as the structure of this portion of stem I are important. In agreement with this observation, when stem I was restored by bstem inversionQ (SARSPK2), in which the order of the base pairs in the stem are reordered from top to bottom ( Fig. 3A ; SARSPK2), frameshifting levels remained near background levels (Fig. 3B) . A similar result was obtained by a combination of bstrand switchingQ and bstem inversionQ for SARSPK2-1 (Fig. 3) . Each altered sequence was examined using mfold (Mathews et al., 1999; Zuker, 2003) for other possible folding configurations. In each case where base pairing potential was restored mfold predicted the expected pairing of strand I and II of stem I (data not shown).",

For the SARS-CoV pseudoknot, it has recently been proposed that a stem loop structure can be formed within the loop II (Ramos et al., 2004) . To determine the importance of loop II in SARS-CoV, sequence portions of nine nucleotides at a time were deleted from the 3Vend of loop II and frameshift levels were measured in HEK293 cells. The first deletion had no significant effect ( Fig. 4B ; SARSL1). Deleting 18 nucleotides reduced frameshifting efficiency slightly to 80% ( Fig. 4B ; SARSL2) and further reduced to 35% of wildtype levels by deleting 27 nucleotides ( Fig. 4B; SARSL3) . Surprisingly, a dramatic reduction in frameshifting was observed by leaving the length unchanged but altering the sequence of loop II. Nine nucleotides at a time were changed to the complimentary sequence. Frameshifting was reduced to 35% of wildtype when 9 nucleotides located near the 3V end of loop II were changed ( Fig. 4; SARSL4 ). Most strikingly, changes in the middle or near the 5Vend of the loop reduced frameshifting levels to 7% and 8% of wildtype frameshifting levels, respectively ( Fig. 4 ; SARSL5, and SARSL6). There is a potential for RNA stem loop formation in loop II (Ramos et al., 2004) . Its importance for the frameshifting is not supported by the deletion mutants, in SARSL1 and SARSL2 in which a significant part of this structure is removed (Fig. 4) , but frameshifting levels remain high. However, it is possible that this stem loop is important in the context of the wildtype large loop II. To test this, we restored formation of the RNA stem loop in loop II by converting G:C and A:U pairs to C:G and U:A pairs respectively, but this change did not result in restoration of frameshifting levels ( Fig. 4B; SARSL7) . A notable feature of the WT stem loop is the presence of two bulged As. Unpaired or bulged adenosines are known to form A-minor motifs, a very common element of tertiary structure interactions (reviewed in Strobel 2002) . In the SARSL7 construct, the bulged nucleotides in the predicted stems are changed to either C or U. By changing these nucleotides and the 3V U in the apical loop to As ( Fig. 4; SARSL8) , frameshifting levels were restored to nearly wild type levels.",

A common assumption is that P-and A-site tRNAs decoding XXY and YYZ, reposition into the \u00c01 reading frame at the overlapping XXX and YYY codons. However, this is not always the case as frameshifting in decoding an HIV frameshift cassette results in production of two protein products when it is expressed in reticulocyte lysate (Jacks et al., 1988) . While 70% of the product corresponds to a product of tandem slippage of A-and P-site tRNAs, there is an additional product corresponding to frameshifting that involves either slippage of E-and P-site tRNAs (Horsfield et al., 1995) or other tRNA rearrangements inside the ribosome allowing \u00c01 P-site tRNA slippage (Baranov et al., 2004) . To examine whether a similar situation occurs during frameshifting in SARS-CoV, a molecular mass of the frameshifting product(s) was determined. The SARS-CoV frameshift region was cloned into a mammalian expression vector, flanked upstream by Glutathione-S transferase and downstream by a six histidine nickel affinity tag (see Materials and methods). This recombinant construct was expressed in cultured cells and the products of its expression analyzed by electrospray mass spectrometry. Only one significant product was detected ( Fig. 5 ; observed MW = 45703), corresponding to the predicted mass (MW = 45703) of a protein product with leucine and asparagine being incorporated at the shift site. This result clearly indicates that frameshifting in SARS-CoV occurs only due to tandem slippage of the P-site tRNALeu and A-site tRNAAsn which takes place at the standard U _ UUA _ AAC slippery site.",

Mutagenic analysis of the SARS-CoV heptanucleotide frameshift site presented here, suggests that frameshifting occurs at the predicted site and most probably by a tandem tRNA slippage mechanism as frameshifting levels are significantly reduced by changes in either the A-or P-site codons. To confirm the mechanism of frameshifting at this site, we report mass spectrometry of the protein product arising from frameshifting on the coronaviral frameshift site in vivo. The resulting mass indicates that frameshifting occurs after 0-frame decoding of the Asn codon and a single trans-frame product is produced. This result when combined with mutagenic analysis of the SARS-CoV shift site definitively identifies the mechanism of frameshifting as tandem tRNA slippage. This shows the utility of mass spectrometry analysis for determination of the location of recoding events, and for elucidation of the mechanisms involved.",

IBV frameshifting efficiency is lower than what has previously been reported using rabbit reticulocyte lysates (30%) (Brierley et al., 1989) . However, this is not surprising since discrepancies in absolute values of frameshifting measured in different systems are not uncommon and it was observed that, in general, frameshifting efficiency is lower when measured in vivo (Grentzmann et al., 1998; Kim et al., 1999) . The critical difference between in vitro and in vivo assays remains to be identified. A recent report of IBV frameshifting using the dual luciferase reporter system in cultured cells found IBV frameshifting to be even lower at approximately 4% (Ivanov et al., 2004) . The lower level frameshifting reported in that study was found to be due to the exclusion of several nucleotides just downstream from the 3V end of the IBV pseudoknot which are required for the higher level frameshifting observed in this study. Nevertheless, comparable frameshifting efficiencies were observed for the IBV and SARS-CoV reporter constructs containing the larger frameshift window used in the present study (see Materials and methods for the IBV sequence tested).",

Whereas, changing the immediate surrounding sequence had no significant effect on frameshifting with the exception that altering the nucleotide preceding the heptanucleotide motif to an A produced an increase in frameshifting levels. Interestingly, in approximately half of the other coronaviruses with known genomic sequences, an A occurs in this position (See Fig. 1) . A possibility for increased frameshifting in this case could be the change of encoded amino acid and consequent effect from the nascent peptide. However, other mutations leading to amino acid changes do not produce the same effect. More likely, this effect is achieved through interaction between the nucleotide preceding and the first nucleotide of the heptanucleotide motif which affects the P-site tRNA stability. Alternatively, this effect can be achieved through interactions with the E-site tRNA, as it was recently proposed as a general factor influencing \u00c01 frameshifting in eukaryotic viruses (Bekaert and Rousset, 2005) .",

            "text": "The importance of base pairing potential of the sequences forming stem I of the SARS-CoV pseudoknot is demonstrated by alterations which eliminate this potential or reverse the order of base pairing (Fig. 3) . However, when the sequence of stem I was reversed from top to bottom but base pairing maintained, frameshifting was severely impaired. At least three factors may account for this effect. Stem I is shown on Fig. 1 with two G:U pairs at its base. It is unclear whether these base pairs are formed. If the spacer between the pseudoknot and frameshift site is the same in IBV and SARS-CoV, only one G:U pair should be formed. Reversal of stem I from top to bottom (Fig. 3, SARSPK2) potentially changes either the spacer between the frameshift site and pseudoknot or the length of stem I. Spacer length seems unlikely to be responsible for the loss of activity as small changes in spacing do not eliminate frameshifting in IBV but reduce efficiency by only several fold (Brierley et al., 1989 (Brierley et al., , 1992 . Another consideration is that stem I in SARS-CoV is more G:C rich at the bottom than at the top. The majority of viral pseudoknots are G:C rich at the bottom of stem I. The importance of this feature was demonstrated for IBV previously where changes of G:C pairs in the stem I to A:U pairs reduced frameshifting about 6-fold . The stability of this region of frameshift stimulators is likely to be a generally important feature for inducing ribosomal frameshifting. Most \u00c01 frameshift stimulators start 5-9 nt downstream from the end of the heptanucleotide motif. The recent crystal structure of the T. thermophilus ribosome with mRNA diffused into the crystal suggests that the mRNA begins to enter the ribosome 7-9 nt downstream from P-site (Yusupova et al., 2001 ) (placing these \u00c01 stimulatory structures very near the entrance to the ribosome mRNA channel). During elongation, ribosomes must unwind the stem starting from this G:C rich region while the P-and A-sites are decoding the heptanucleotide motif. This observation provides a rationale for the importance of stability in this part of the pseudoknot and its distance from the shift site.",

            "text": "Deletions in the IBV loop (data not shown) corresponding to SARSL1 and SARSL2 did not reduce frameshifting, whereas an IBV deletion corresponding to SARSL3 decreased frameshifting by 4-fold. The large deletion in SARSL3 and the corresponding deletion in IBV reduce the loop size to 5 nt which may be too short to span the distance from stems I and II (Brierley et al., 1991) . More markedly, changing the sequence of the loop II in SARS-CoV dramatically reduced frameshifting efficiency. This suggests that loop II may contribute to important structural features required for frameshift stimulation. An additional stem loop structure within loop II has been proposed recently (Ramos et al., 2004) . This stem loop is not required within loop II to support high efficiency of frameshifting, since deletions in the loop II do not significantly alter frameshifting efficiency. Evolutionary importance of this stem loop is not supported by comparative sequence analysis with other coronaviruses. However, our data suggest that in the WT context of a large loop II, it plays an important role in frameshift stimulation. Most likely, the RNA in loop II (if not properly structured) can interfere with the structure of the stimulating pseudoknot and reduce its efficiency. Our results demonstrate that the bulged As in this proposed stem loop are important for frameshifting efficiency, potentially through interactions with the rest of pseudoknot body (for example, by A-minor motif interactions (Battle and Doudna, 2002; Nissen et al., 2001) . The importance of this stem loop for high efficiency frameshifting in SARS-CoV is further supported by the fact that substitutions of only three nucleotides important for the formation of this stem loop reduce frameshifting efficiency to background levels. An answer to whether loop IIs in other coronoviruses need proper folding and to what extent they can accommodate sequence changes without loss of frameshifting requires more extensive studies of pseudoknots from other coronoviruses. However, it is clear that if such requirements exist they are highly diverse among coronaviruses as evident from the lack of conservation seen in comparative sequence analysis.",

Nucleotides at the equivalent position in IBV are base paired and disrupting the two base pairs at the top of stem I significantly reduced frameshifting efficiency, although the identity of the base pair was less important (Brierley et al., 1991) . Alterations in the SARS-CoV loop I which created base pairing potential with the unpaired GU or changing the unpaired G:U to A:C significantly impaired frameshifting levels, illustrating the importance of these two unpaired nucleotides for the frameshift stimulation by this pseudoknot. These unpaired GU tandem nucleotides exist in about half of the pseudoknots shown in Fig. 1 . Additional structural studies will be required to determine the role these two nucleotides play in obtaining the active pseudoknot conformation.",

In the context of a large loop II, this region needs to form a secondary structure with unpaired As in order to maintain frameshift stimulating activity.
