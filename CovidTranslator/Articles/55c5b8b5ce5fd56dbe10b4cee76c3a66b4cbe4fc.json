By the fourth week of the outbreak, our need for mechanical ventilation will be 200% of our capacity (assuming that the needs of noninfluenza patients do not change). By Week 5, more than 1,800 people will require hospital admission, and almost 200 will die in hospital every day from influenza alone. At times, the number of seriously ill patients denied life-sustaining therapy may actually exceed the number who receive it. According to the plan, all of the former are supposed to receive palliative care. Unfortunately, our palliative care resources are even more limited than our critical care resources, and they would likely be overwhelmed within days.",

We should also aim to maximize the use of existing palliative care units and hospice beds, as past experience with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) demonstrated the potential for such beds to be underutilized. 12 In terms of systems, we need to have a triage system for identifying patients in greatest need of direct specialist care.
