There was no support for the suggestion that entry took place by fusion of viral and plasma membranes. The results of electron microscopy showed that virus attachment occurred both at 4 \u00b0 and at 37 \u00b0 C. Viropcxis was not observed until the preparations were warmed. Similar results were obtained using chicken kidney cells. Quantitative data obtained from a plaque counting system employing chicken kidney cells indicated that attachment was the same at both temperatures and that some virus particles were taken up at 4 \u00b0 C.",

Virus was adsorbed onto monolayers of CKC for 90 minutes vacuoles. An electron dense particle (V) which m a y be a virus particle, can be observed in the cytoplasm a d j a c e n t to the vacuole. The bar represents 100 n m Fig. 6 . Active virus i n c u b a t e d w i t h CAM for 1 hour at 4 \u00b0 C followed b y i n c u b a t i o n at 37 \u00b0 C for 30 minutes. Virus particle (arrow) a t t a c h e d to the vacuolar m e m b r a n e appears to be in the process of being p o c k e t e d b y the m e m b r a n e at either 4 \u00b0 or 37 \u00b0 C, as described previously in Materials and Methods, and then subjected to one of three different procedures. Direct overlay without removal of the inoculation fluid gave the maximum number of plaques obtainable and this was compared with the plaque number obtained when the cell sheet was washed before being overlaid. It may be seen from Table 2 that only about one third of the available virus remained attached after washing the ceil sheet. However, attachment was as efficient at 4 \u00b0 as at 37 \u00b0 C. Other dishes had antiserum added to neutralise extraeellular virus before the overlay was added. There was no significant difference between the plaque numbers obtained for virus adsorbed at 37 \u00b0 C and either washed or neutralised, suggesting that at 37 \u00b0 C virus uptake must have been rapid once attachment had occurred. However, the cell layers to which virus had been adsorbed at 4 \u00b0 C and then neutralised showed a significant drop (P<0.001) in the plaque number compared with both its 37 \u00b0 C equivalent and the 4 \u00b0 C adsorbed and washed cells. Thus although virus attachment is as efficient at 4 \u00b0 as at 37 \u00b0 C, the process of uptake into the cells has been much reduced at 4 \u00b0 C. To a fourth set of cells was added virus which had been previously mixed with the antiserum; this gave a control count of plaques to test the efficiency of neutralisation by the antibody. The plaques were almost totally abolished, and this number was significantly less (P<0.001) than that in the experiment where virus was adsorbed at 4 \u00b0 C and then neutralised. Therefore there was a genuine uptake of virus into cells at 4 \u00b0 C, although at a much lower rate than at 37 \u00b0 C. On examination of CKC by electron microscopy, attached virus was sparsely distributed along the cell membrane both in those preparations warmed to 37 \u00b0 C and in preparations only subject to a cold incubation. Internalized virus was not found in cells that had only been incubated for 1 hour at 4 \u00b0 C. This was exactly parallel to the situation seen in the CAM preparations.",
