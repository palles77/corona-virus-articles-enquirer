Immunopathol., In vitro T cell function by domestic cats and cheetahs to two common pathogens, feline herpesvirusl (FHV-1) and Cryptococcus neoformans, was assessed. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBM) were stimulated with two strains of UV-inactivated FHV-l, whole heat-killed organisms or capsular antigen of Cryptococcus neoformans, and proliferative responses measured. As a group, cheetah PBM responded significantly poorer than domestic cat PBM when cultured with FHV-1. However, individual cheetah responses varied widely. Supplementation of cultures with exogenous interleukin 2 (IL-2 ) significantly increased the level of response of individual cheetahs to both strains of FHV-I. Cheetah sera contained slightly higher neutralizing antibody titers to FHV-1 than did domestic cat sera, suggesting that B cells function adequately in cheetahs. When stimulated with Cryptococcus neoforroans, both species had similar incidences of positive proliferative responses.",

However, a lower group response to FHV-I in cheetahs suggests species differences occur. In addition, level of variability in major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I-like genes, as determined by Southern blot hybridization, does not appear to correlate with a uniform response in in vitro functional assays. Therefore, additional mechanisms influence the final outcome of the immune response.",

This apparent sensitivity has stimulated speculations that this species' immune system is not competent to defend against infections, possibly due to lack of genetic variation (O'Brien et al., 1985) . Previous studies suggest that the cheetah is genetically monomorphic, based on lack of polymorphism at red blood cell, leukocyte isoenzyme, and MHC loci ~To whom correspondence should be addressed. as well as delayed rejection in limited allogeneic skin grafting experiments (O'Brien et al., 1983 (O'Brien et al., , 1985 Yuhki and O'Brien, 1990) . Disease susceptibility/resistance and antigen responsiveness have been associated with particular allotypes in several species such as mouse, chicken, and human (Pazderka et al., 1975; Batchelor and McMichael, 1987; Leist et al., 1989) .

In order to assess the role of IL-2 in FHV-I responses, domestic cat and cheetah PBM were stimulated with virus in the presence or absence of supernatant containing human recombinant IL-2. When cheetahs were ranked according to response to FHV-1, the low responders tended to show the greatest enhancement of proliferation in the presence of IL-2 (Fig. 4) . As a group, exogenous IL-2 significantly increased the mean proliferative responses of cheetah PBM to both strains of virus (P< 0.025). However, mean domestic cat PBM responses did not significantly change with addition of IL-2, except in individual cases, where both enhancement and suppression were observed (data not shown ). These results support the hypothesis that inadequate levels of IL-2 may be at least partially responsible for low proliferative responses by cheetah PBM. Once optimal Fig. 4 .

IL-2 is an antigen-nonspecific lympholine which is necessary for stimulated T cell expansion (Smith, 1988 ) . Supplementation of virus-stimulated cultures with exogenous IL-2 resulted in significant enhancement of certain individual cheetahs' responses. As a group, the mean response of FHV-1stimulated cheetah PBM supplemented with IL-2 was comparable to domestic cat PBM responses, with or without IL-2. Therefore, cheetah PBM appear to have similar potential immunologic competence as that of domestic cats. Interestingly, the individuals with the poorest responses were those that tended to respond most favorably with IL-2 supplementation. This trend has been repeated in other in vitro systems (Miller-Edge and Splitter, 1986) . Our resuits appear to rule out an inability of cheetah PBM to respond to antigen by lack of IL-2 receptor expression, as has been shown to occur in some low responder conditions (Pink and Vainio, 1983; Kierszenbaum et al., 1989) . However, further studies of IL-2 production by stimulated cheetah PBM are required to determine whether insufficient endogenous IL-2 is the underlying cause of poor response. If IL-2 supplementation can augment in vivo responses as well, incorporation of this lymphokine into prophylactic regimens with killed or subunit vaccines may be beneficial, especially in exotic species where data are lacking regarding safety and efficacy of current vaccines. Preliminary investigations using IL-2 in vivo have shown that it may provide an immunological boost in vaccination programs (Weinberg and Merigan, 1988; Kawashima and Platt, 1989; Reddy et al., 1989 ) .",

In order to assess the effect of similar genetic background on immune responses, mitogen-and antigen-stimulated proliferation were compared among cheetah littermates. Differences were observed even between related individuals (Fig. 5 ). Although T cell responses appear to be restricted to epitopes that can bind particular MHC molecules, there is variation in responses even among syngeneic individuals (Gammon et al., 1990 ) . Recent results (Yuhki and O'Brien, 1990; Miller-Edge and Worley, manuscript in preparation) have demonstrated some polymorphism in cheetah MHC class I-like genes. However, attempts to correlate level of mitogen-or antigen-stimulated proliferation with specific RFLP were unsuccessful. Other studies attempting to correlate expression of specific MHC antigens with ability to respond to antigens have given equivocal results (Clerici et al., 1989) . Therefore, mechanisms, in addition to genetic factors, influence the final outcome of the host's response. Selection and proliferation of specific T cell clones depend on in vivo factors such as route, dose, form, and number of exposures to antigen, as well as host factors (Hammerberg et al., 1989 ) .",

Therefore, a direct effect of genetic variation on level of immune response could not be demonstrated. FHV-stimulated cheetah PBM proliferated significantly less than PBM from domestic cats. Further analyses suggested that this species difference was probably mediated by the cellular immune response. Further characterization of the mechanisms resulting in low responses may lead to the use of immunomodulators to supplement in vivo responses.",
