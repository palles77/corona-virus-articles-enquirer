            "text": "In April 2003, a novel coronavims [I,2] which was associated with cases of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) was first isolated and sequenced in Canada. The genome of SARS coronavims (SARS-CoV) is 29727 [3] nucleotides in length and has 11 known open reading frames (ORFs). Although the genome organization of this vims is similar to that of other coronavimses, phylogenetic analyses and sequence alignment show that SARS-CoV is not closely related to any of the previously characterized coronavimses [3, 4] . It shows more homology with the bovine coronavimses and murine hepatitis vims than that of the human strain of the coronavimses, which suggested that it was not originated from a host of the Homo sapiens [5] .",

New cases every day were more than 50 and total cases reported reached 4948 up to May 12,2003. As the incubation period for the disease can last 2 or 3 weeks, early and rapid diagnostic approaches are very important for quarantine of the source of infection and protection of the healthy population. Currently, laboratory examinations were mainly immunological means such as ELISA, colloidal gold indicator paper, or molecular biological methods such as nested RT-PCR [6] or real-time PCR. In this research we designed and manufactured an oligonucleotide microarray, which consisted of thirty 60mer specific oligonucleotides according to the sequence of Strain TR02 to represent the genome of SARS coronavims. Our studies showed that SARS oligo microarrays yielded better diagnostic results. were synthesized by BIOASIA Co. Cy5 labeled universal primer (5' Cy5-UTTGGCTGGTGTGGATC 3 ') was synthesized by Trilink Biotechnologies, Inc. Other reagents were: DEPC and Poly-L-Lysine (Sigma), silanlized slides (DAKO), DMSO and Formamide (Amresco), succinic anhydride (Aldrich), I-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone (Aldrich), sodium borate (Merk-Schuchardt). The oligo probes were synthesized by our institute using an ABI 3900 DNA Synthesizer.",

Immunology methods are often effective in later stages of the diseases, because they all depended on the emerging of antibodies in the serum. Methods based on PCR have a merit of convenience and easy to use, but they are often designed to amplify only one fragment of the SARS genome, which means that the result would be affected if the samples were not well preserved and treated. DNA microarray for diagnosis is based on the high throughput detection of multiple targeting locus. It can help to increase the diagnostic ratio while monitoring the activities of virus genes during the progress of the disease at the same time.",

We can judge from the results of the 7 samples hybridized with the probes on the microarray and there was no signal on the negative and blank probe sites. Although there were some differences among each sample, some common features were shown in the hybridization picture. For example, four samples including (a), (b), (e), (g) were hybridized with the specific probes on site J5-J8, which only belonged to SARS coronavirus and could provide very important clues for final diagnosis. However, the differences between different samples might mainly result from the methods for sample storage and treatment. As an RNA virus, the nucleic acids of SARS coronavirus are very easy to de grade, and the ingredients in sputum are very complicated and may include many enzymes and bacteria. If we stored or treated the samples improperly, some of the targeting sequence would be lost unexpectedly. Furthermore, although the RD technique is a method to amplify the whole genome in theory, there is still some possibility of the fragments, which could not be ligated with the adaptors, especially when there was degradation in the samples. This would cause preferential amplification, with some fragments amplified well while other fragments inhibited. These effects were very significant when we observed Fig.  2 (c) and Fig. 2(d) . That is the reason why the extraction of the virus RNAs from fresh samples and immediately stored in low temperature are very important for improving the accuracy of diagnosis. On the other hand, we had observed some signals in the sites of oligo 12, oligo11 and olig028, which were hybridized with the sample of normal person, this might be due to the defect of stringency. When we checked the oligos, complementation was found between the two oligos with the flourscent labeled primers of 10 and 11 bases correspondingly. As for probe oligo11, although the condition of which satisfied the principles we used to design the oligos, a discontinuous 22-base homology presented between the oligo and human BAC clone RPl1-33301, and these led to the non-specific hybridization. That was why all these three probes should be eliminated when the array was used for diagnosis.",
