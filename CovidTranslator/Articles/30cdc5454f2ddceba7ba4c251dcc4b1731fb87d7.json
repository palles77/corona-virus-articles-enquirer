Although intensivists working in developed countries generally have little experience treating specific illnesses caused by serious bioweapon pathogens, these diseases result in clinical conditions that commonly require treatment in intensive care units (ICUs) (e.g., severe sepsis and septic shock, hypoxemic respiratory failure, and ventilatory failure). Therefore, intensivists will play a key role in the medical response to a bioterrorism event. Usual critical care practices will likely require modification for any event resulting in more than a few critically ill victims, and critical care specialists should participate in planning for such situations. Capabilities to provide medical care, especially critical care, services to large numbers of contagious patients are very limited in most countries. Local hospitals will be expected to care for seriously ill victims of a bioterrorist (BT) attack, and the ability to care for large numbers of critically ill patients will likely be a major determinant of the medical impact of such events.",

Fortunately, none of these prior events produced a large number of casualties because of the nonlethal nature of the pathogens released (e.g., Salmonella typhimurium in Oregon in 1984), the lack of technical expertise to successfully disseminate lethal pathogens (Aum Shinrikyo in Japan in 1994), or relatively limited exposure (the anthrax cases of 2001 in the United States). These limited exposures should not result in predictions of the numbers of potential casualties being reduced; rather, they simply reveal that an increasing number of groups throughout the world are willing to use biologic agents. The scope and effect of prior events could have been much greater if a contagious agent were used or if a lethal pathogen were widely disseminated. Despite the increased attention to biodefense, the risk of subsequent BT events may paradoxically be increasing. Rapid advancements in science are making synthetic and novel biologic agents more accessible and technologies to disseminate agents may no longer be restricted to only a few nations.",

Unlike most mass casualty incidents, releases of bioweapons agents may be covert, thus providing additional security and public health challenges to the medical response beyond the generic burden of scores of casualties. An optimal medical response to a bioweapon attack will require all or most of the following: early diagnosis, rapid case finding, large-scale distribution of countermeasures for postexposure prophylaxis or early treatment, immediate isolation of contagious victims, and enhanced capacity for providing medical care to seriously and critically ill victims. No country is fully prepared to avert illness when thousands of people are covertly exposed to a serious bioweapons agent.

Initial symptoms of inhalational anthrax are nonspecific: fevers, chills, drenching sweats, nonproductive cough, dyspnea, nausea, vomiting, and fatigue.

Antibiotics must be started as soon as possible without waiting for diagnostic confirmation. Treatment recommendations are summarized in Table 64 .2. For adults, combination antimicrobial therapy with intravenous ciprofloxacin and one or two other agents is recommended. Given the potential for meningitis, agents with good central nervous system penetration, such as rifampin, penicillin, or chloramphenicol, are recommended. Clindamycin has been administered for the theoretical benefit of reducing toxin production by the vegetative bacilli, although this has been done in too few instances to critically evaluate its effectiveness. A change to oral therapy is acceptable once the patient is stable. Therapy should continue for 60 days. The concomitant use of an anthrax vaccine in a modified dosing regimen (three doses within the first month) may be limited by availability. There is anecdotal evidence that drainage of pleural effusions carries some benefit. Whether the benefit is simply reduction of pleural fluid volume to improve oxygenation or actually helps to reduce toxin burden remains uncertain. During the 2001 outbreak, pleural drainage was accomplished via serial thoracenteses and tube thoracostomy. Optimal management may require tube thoracostomy due to the hemorrhagic nature of the fluid. Historically, inhalational anthrax had a mortality rate of approximately 90%. In the 2001 attacks, modern critical care interventions and use of multiple antimicrobial agents reduced mortality to 45%.",

In the United States, most cases occur in the rural states of the Southwest. Plague occurs in three forms: bubonic, septicemic, and pneumonic. Naturally occurring bubonic plague occurs when infected fleas bite a human and typically results in enlarged lymph nodes (bubo) and severe sepsis. A smaller percentage of patients may develop sepsis without bubo formation, and this is termed primary septicemic plague. Rarely, patients with bubonic or septicemic plague develop pneumonia, and this is termed secondary pneumonic plague. Patients with pneumonic plague can transmit disease through respiratory droplets.

Exposure is followed 1 to 6 days later by fever, dyspnea, and cough with bloody, watery, or purulent sputum. Gastrointestinal symptoms also occur. Cervical buboes are rare. Pneumonia progresses rapidly with unilateral or bilateral infiltrates or consolidation. Severe sepsis and septic shock develop with leukocytosis, multisystem organ failure, and disseminated intravascular coagulation. In the absence of therapy, irreversible shock and death occur 2 to 6 days after exposure. A bioterrorist attack with aerosolized plague would likely present as an outbreak of severe pneumonia and sepsis. Diagnosis depends on standard microbiologic studies, with confirmatory tests available only at select laboratories. Hence, unless epidemiologic clues alert health care workers that these patients do not have community-acquired pneumonia, the first group of patients will likely be cared for with the hospital's usual infection control policies for this condition. Unless droplet precautions are commonly used and strictly adhered to, a number of health care workers and addi- tional patients may be exposed to plague early in the outbreak.

Loss of airway protection may necessitate intubation, and respiratory muscle paralysis may require mechanical ventilation. The course is variable and may require months of mechanical ventilation. During small outbreaks with sufficient medical resources, serial measurement of vital capacity can help identify patients with respiratory muscle weakness. Elevation of PaCO 2 is a late finding, and positive pressure ventilation should be instituted prior to frank ventilatory failure.

Although these gels are generally effective against bacteria and viruses, they have been shown to be ineffective against bacterial spores such as anthrax.
