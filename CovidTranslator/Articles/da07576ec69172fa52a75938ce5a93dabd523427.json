In this paper, based on the analysis of real epidemic data and simulations, it's found that the risk indicator of recurrent epidemic outbreaks could be determined by the ratio of the epidemic infection rate of the year to the average infected density of the former year. According to the risk indicator, the dynamic vaccination probability of each year can be designed to suppress the epidemic outbreaks. Our simulation results show that the dynamic vaccination strategy could effectively decrease the maximal and average infected density, and meanwhile increase the time intervals of epidemic outbreaks and individuals attacked by epidemic. In addition, our results indicate that to depress the influenza outbreaks, it is not necessary to keep the vaccination probability high every year; and adjusting the vaccination probability at right time could decrease the outbreak risks with lower costs. Our findings may present a theoretical guidance for the government and the public to control the recurrent epidemic outbreaks.",

            "text": "A challenging problem in epidemiology is how to understand epidemic spreading dynamics [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] and design informing prevention strategies so that the outbreaks of epidemics could be suppressed or reduced effectively. This problem has got great attention in statistical physics and many other disciplines [2, 7, 8] . According to the percolation theory, the simplest strategy to suppress the outbreaks is to immunize individuals uniformly or randomly, which the implementation do not require preparation or information at all [9, 10] . However, it was revealed that random immunization is inefficient for heterogeneous networks. And then, many more effective immunization strategies were developed, ranging from global strategies such as targeted immunization based on node degree [10] or betweeness centrality [11] , to local strategies such as acquaintance immunization [12] and (bias) random-walk immunization [13, 14] , and to some others in between [15] . Later, the graph partitioning [16] and optimization of the susceptible size [17] became the new improvements. Besides the degree heterogeneity, community structure has a major influence on disease im-munity [18, 19] . Recently, based on the message-passing approach, an optimal set of nodes for immunization [20] was found, and the immunization was mapped onto the optimal percolation problem [21] . Inspired by the idea of explosive percolation, an \"explosive immunization\" method has been proposed [22] . In contrast to the above approaches, recent research increasingly explored the pivotal implications of individual behavior in populations, such as reducing the risk of infection by adaptive rewiring the links incident to infected individuals [23] , information-driven vaccination [24] , and the dynamical interplay between awareness and epidemic spreading [25] . These strategies can theoretically prevent the prevalence of an epidemic and thus bring us a huge hope of controlling an epidemic.",

However, in realistic situations, the empirical data shows that some epidemics are recurrent, i.e., it will outbreak from time to time [26] [27] [28] [29] , such as SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome), H1N1 (Swine Influenza), H5H1 (Avian Influenza), Ebola, and MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome) etc. If these diseases do not confer immunity, individuals would be infected over and over again. Therefore, an effective dynamic vaccination strategy to suppress the outbreak of recurrent epidemic is called for. As we all know, a large vaccine coverage can greatly reduce the risk of epidemic outbreak, but it increases the health- care costs and the financial burden of the public health authorities greatly. In fact, the outbreak of recurrent epidemic is not always seasonal and there is even no outbreak in some years [26] . Therefore, we are wondering whether the immune coverage can be adjusted according to the outbreak risk every year so that the recurrent epidemic outbreak can be suppressed to the greatest extent at lowest cost. More precisely, is't possible to improve the immune coverage before a higher risk of epidemic outbreak and decrease the immune probability in lower risk case?",

In particular, as is shown in Fig. 1 , susceptible individuals may be infected with the probability \u03b2 by the infected neighbors, and it may also be infected by the virus in the surrounding environment at a certain probability p 0 . Then the infected individuals are recovered to refractory state with the probability \u03bc. And then the refractory individuals will change into susceptible state with the probability of \u03b4. In our simulation, \u03bc and \u03b4 are fixed at 0.20 and 0.02. In this model, when p 0 = 0 . 00 , the infected density will decay to zero, and when p 0 \u2248 0.01 the infected density can be sustained and can reproduce the recurrent behaviors of non-periodic epidemic patterns, thus p 0 is set as 0.01. For the infection rate \u03b2, it will change every 52 time step (corresponding to one year, and one time step represents one week), since the strain of influenza virus change every year. The value of the infection rate in each year is randomly chosen from the truncated Gaussian distribution with average \u03b2 and standard deviation \u03c3 . In this paper, \u03b2 = 0 . 1 , \u03c3 = 0 . 1 are fixed and only positive \u03b2 is reserved.",

It's believed that to prevent the influenza outbreaks the best way is to keep the immune probability as high as possible. However, high probability of immunization will cost greatly and the risk of influenza outbreaks may not be high every year. Then a question is addressed: Is it possible to regulate the immune probability of each year with the outbreak risk? That is to say, when the outbreak risk is high, the immune probability is large, and vice versa. If this strategy is effective, outbreak could be controlled at a lower cost.

Each year, the World Health Organization (WHO) [32] provides formal recommendation for the composition of influenza vaccines based on the information provided by the WHO Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System, which makes the estimation of the basic reproduction number R 0 [33] possible to some extent. It may reflect the infected rate in an indirect way. But in reality, it's hard to count the number (or density) of the susceptible individuals. We believe there must be something else that could indicate the high density of susceptible individuals. For this purpose, we turn to study the time series of the weekly consultation rates of influenza-like illness (per 10 0 0 consultations) from 1999 to 2013 in Hong Kong for the General Out-Patient Clinics (GOPC) and the General Practitioners (GP) [34] , which are shown in Fig. 2 . From the figures we noticed an interesting phenomenon: in a period before most outbreaks (not all) the average consultation rate is lower than the average one, which are marked by the light blue ellipses. The consultation rate could be regarded as the density of infected individuals, and the low infected density in a period means less individuals to be in refractory state in the next period, as a result more individuals are in the susceptible state, i.e., low infected density in a period will make large susceptible density in the next period. This may be the reason for the above phenomenon.",

Fig. 3 (a) and (b) show the evolution of infection rate \u03b2 and the infected density \u03c1 I in our model, respectively. The horizontal black line represents the average infection rate \u03b2 . Arrows 1, 3 and 4 indicate the typical outbreaks and the light blue ellipses indicate the infected density before the outbreaks. The simulation time series can well reflect the non-periodic and persistently outbreak features (see Fig. 2 ). What's more, it's also found that in a period before most outbreaks (not all) the infection density is relatively lower (marked by light blue ellipses), which is similar to the phenomenon in the real data (see Fig. 2 ). However, both the simulations and real data indicate that not all the lower infection density will indicate the emergence of the outbreaks in the coming period. Thus, lower infected density in the It is noting that the infected rate \u03b2 is controllable in the model, which makes the investigation of the relations between \u03b2 and the epidemic outbreaks possible. After carefully studied, it's found that a very large \u03b2 = 0 . 296 does not always induce the epidemic outbreak (example indicated by arrow 2). But sometimes epidemic may outbreak even \u03b2 is rather smaller than 0.296 (see arrow 1, 3 and 4 in Fig. 3 ) . Therefore a large \u03b2 is not the sufficient condition for the outbreak, either.",

The yellow symbols and lines represent the simulation and theoretical results, respectively. The black vertical line marks the starting time of the vaccination. The simulation results show that with the increasing of parameter a (i.e., p ), the outbreak amplitude depresses greatly and the average infected density decreases clearly. When the average vaccination probability is large enough, the epidemic is under control with a lower infected density. Our theoretical analyses also confirm the simulation results very well(see the next section for detail). To investigate the effect of varying vaccination probability strategy on recurrent epidemic spreading, the parameter a is tuned to regulate the average vaccination probability. It's worth noting that the average vaccination probability multiplied by the total individual number is the vaccination number, thus when the total individual number is almost unchanged, the average vaccination probability can be used to represent the vaccination cost to some extent. To quantify the change of epidemic spreading with average vaccination probability p , maximal infected density \u03c1 I, max , average infected density \u03c1 I , outbreak interval \u03c4 and average time interval T n of an individual attacked by the epidemic are calculated in Fig. 6 . It's worth noting that the smaller the \u03c1 I, max and \u03c1 I are, the better the effect of controlling the recurrent epidemic is. As to \u03c4 and T n , the larger values indicate the better controlling effect. For comparison, the strategies that the vaccination probability is constant for each year and the vaccination probabilities are determined only by infection rate \u03b2 or by densities of infectious individuals in the former year I \u2212y (i.e., the p ( y ) is replaced by 1 \u2212 e \u2212a\u03b2 or 1 \u2212 e \u2212 a I \u2212y ) are also studied. From the Fig. 6 (a) and (c) , it can be seen that with the increasing of average vaccination probability, the maximal infected density \u03c1 I, max and average infected density \u03c1 I decrease greatly in all strategies, but it decreases much sharper when the vaccination probability varies year by year with risk indicator. Furthermore, the varying vaccination probability strategy makes the average outbreak interval \u03c4 and average time interval of individual attacked by influenza T n much larger than the case of other vaccination strategies Fig. 6 (b) and (d) .

Under the framework of complex network, this paper studies the dynamic vaccination strategy on recurrent epidemic spreading.

According to the study of these two quantities, we found out the risk indicator and designed a dynamic vaccination strategy. Taking into account the risk indicator, the varying vaccination strategy could depress the recurrent epidemic outbreaks effectively. In particular, the outbreak peaks will be lowered obviously even at very small average vaccination probability, and the outbreak interval will be prolonged notably.",

Thus to study the vaccination strategy in community networks and investigate whether selecting individuals with large connections or in high connected communities to vaccinate is better is needed. In addition, in the disease spread process, both time and space play an important role [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] , and many significant results have been achieved to understand the traveling wave and pattern formation [2, 44] . Therefore, to incorporate the spatial details or realistic population mixing structures to epidemic spreading process and assess the potential impact of different intervention strategies are our future works.",
