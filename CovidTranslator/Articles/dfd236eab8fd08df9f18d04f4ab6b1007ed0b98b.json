These areas are the large vestibule and the three semicircular canals and the cochlea, which arise from the vestibule. Dilation in one end of each of the bony semicircular canals is the ampulla. All three continuous bony components contain perilymph, a fluid similar to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), from which it may be derived. In the bony labyrinth are two openings: the vestibular and cochlear windows, which are named according to the components of the bony labyrinth in which they are located. Each opening is covered by a membrane, and the stapes is inserted in the membrane that covers the vestibular window.",

These compartments are contained within the components of the bony labyrinth and include the saccule and utriculus within the bony vestibule, the three semicircular ducts within the bony semicircular canals, and a cochlear duct within the bony cochlea. The endolymph contained within the membranous labyrinth is thought to be derived from the blood vessels along one wall of the cochlear duct and is absorbed back into the blood through the blood vessels surrounding the endolymphatic sac. The three semicircular ducts are the anterior (vertical), posterior (vertical), and lateral (horizontal). Each semicircular duct is oriented at right angles to the others. Thus rotation of the head around any plane causes endolymph to flow within one or more of the ducts. Each semicircular duct connects at both ends with the utriculus, which, in turn, connects with the saccule by way of the intervening endolymphatic duct and sac. The saccule connects with the cochlea duct by the small ductus reuniens.",

On one side of the membranous ampulla, a proliferation of connective tissue forms a transverse ridge called the crista (see Figs. 12-1 through 12-3). It is lined on its internal surface by columnar neuroepithelial cells. On the surface of the crista is a gelatinous structure that is composed of a protein-polysaccharide material called the cupula, which extends across the lumen of the ampulla. This neuroepithelium is composed of two basic cell types: hair cells and supporting cells. The neurons of the vestibulocochlear nerve are derived from otic placode ectoderm. The dendritic zones of the neurons of the vestibular portion of the vestibulocochlear nerve are in synaptic contact with the base of the hair cells. These hair cells have on their luminal surface 40 to 80 hairs, or modified microvilli (stereocilia), and a single modified cilium (kinocilium). These structures project into the overlying cupula. Movement of fluid in the semicircular ducts causes deflection of the cupula, which is oriented transversely to the direction of flow of the endolymph. This deflection bends the stereocilia, which is the source of the stimulus by way of the hair cells to the dendritic zone of the vestibular neuron that is in synaptic relationship with the plasmalemma of the hair cell.",

Each semicircular duct on one side is paired with a semicircular duct on the opposite side by their common position in a parallel plane. These synergistic pairs are the left and right lateral ducts, the left anterior and right posterior ducts, and the left posterior and right anterior ducts. When movement in the direction of one of these three planes stimulates the vestibular neurons of the crista of one duct, they are inhibited in the opposite duct of the synergistic pair. For example, rotation of the head to the right causes the endolymph to flow in the right lateral duct such that the cupula is deflected toward the utriculus and the cupula of the left lateral duct is deflected away from the utriculus. This action causes increased activity of vestibular neurons on the right side and decreased activity on the left side, resulting in a jerk nystagmus to the right side, which is an involuntary rhythmic oscillation of the eyes. The anatomic orientation of the stereocilia relative to the kinocilium on the surface of the crista is responsible for the difference in activity relative to the direction of the cupula deflection. Deviation of the stereocilia toward the kinocilium increases vestibular neuron activity. These receptors are not affected by a constant velocity of movement but respond to acceleration or deceleration, especially when the head is rotated.",

These maculae are on one surface of each of these saclike structures (see Figs. 12-1 through 12-3). Each macula is an oval-shaped plaque in which the membranous labyrinth has proliferated. The surface of the macula consists of columnar epithelial cells. This neuroepithelium is composed of hair cells and supporting cells. Covering the neuroepithelium is a gelatinous material, the statoconiorum (otolithic) membrane. On the surface of this membrane are calcareous crystalline bodies known as statoconia (otoliths). Similar to the hair cells of the cristae, the macular hair cells have projections of their luminal cell membranes-stereocilia and kinocilia-into the overlying statoconiorum membrane. Movement of the statoconia away from these cells is the initiating factor in bending the stereocilia to stimulate an impulse in the dendritic zones of the vestibular neurons that are in synaptic relationship with the base of the hair cells. The macula in the saccule is oriented in a vertical direction (sagittal plane), whereas the macula of the utriculus is in a horizontal direction (dorsal plane). Thus gravitational forces continually affect the position of the statoconia relative to the hair cells. These structures are responsible for the sensation of the static position of the head and linear acceleration or deceleration. They function in static equilibrium. The macula of the utriculus may be more important as a receptor for sensing changes in head posture, whereas the macula of the saccule may be more sensitive to vibrational stimuli and loud sounds.",

Axons course rostrally in the medial longitudinal fasciculus (MLF) to terminate in the motor nuclei of cranial nerves VI, IV, and III. Their purpose is to provide coordinated conjugate eye movements associated with changes in the position of the head. In most normal animals, this eye movement can be readily elicited by repeatedly moving the head from one side to the other and observing the jerk nystagmus that is produced. When the brainstem is severely contused by a head injury, these pathways may be disrupted, and eyeball movements cannot be elicited by changing the position of the head. This clinical sign usually indicates a poor prognosis because of the severity of the associated lesion. 2. Axons project into the reticular formation. Some of these axons provide afferents to the vomiting center located there. This pathway is involved with motion sickness. 3. We are all readily aware of any loss of our balance. Balance requires a pathway for conscious perception that involves a relay through a thalamic nucleus. This pathway is not well defined for the vestibular system. It may be closely associated with the conscious pathway for the auditory system. Axons of neuronal cell bodies in vestibular nuclei course rostrally through the midbrain to terminate in the contralateral medial geniculate nucleus of the thalamus or some other thalamic nucleus. Synapse occurs here, and the axons of the cell bodies in that thalamic nucleus project by way of the internal capsule to the cerebral cortex, probably the cortex in the temporal lobe. Interference with this conscious pathway would explain the occasional observation of clinical signs of a vestibular system dysfunction after an acute prosencephalic lesion.",

Only minor differences exist in the clinical signs of vestibular system dysfunction between lesions of this system in the petrous portion of the temporal bone (peripheral) or the vestibular nuclei on one side of the medulla or the vestibular components of the cerebellum (central). The determination of whether the vestibular system signs reflect a dysfunction of the peripheral or central components of the vestibular system is more dependent on recognition of clinical signs caused by the dysfunction of other systems located in the brainstem or cerebellum. As a rule, the most common diseases that affect the peripheral components of the vestibular system are less serious than those that affect the central components.

To recognize the mild head tilt, you need to observe the patient's head from in front of the patient and with your head at the level of the head of the patient. The neck and trunk will lean, fall, or even roll toward the side of the lesion. The neck and trunk may be flexed laterally with the concavity directed toward the side of the lesion.

The asymmetry of the ataxia may be explained by the loss of tonic activity in the vestibulospinal tract on the side of the lesion, which removes facilitation of ipsilateral extensor muscles and a source of inhibition of contralateral extensor muscles. The unopposed activity of the contralateral vestibulospinal tract causes the neck and trunk to be forced toward the side of the lesion by excessive unopposed extensor muscle tonus. The entire body will lean, fall, or roll toward the side of the lesion. With peripheral vestibular system disorders, rolling is usually limited to the first 24 to 48 hours after a peracute onset of clinical signs. If the rolling persists longer than that, the lesion more likely involves the central components of the vestibular system. Frequently, the patient falls when it shakes its head. With only the vestibular system affected, these patients will make very rapid and short limb movements in their attempt to maintain their balance. As you evaluate a patient such as this one, you should ask yourself if this patient knows where its limbs are in space. The answer will be definitely yes if only the peripheral vestibular system is affected. Patients with vestibular ataxia use their eyes to help maintain their balance. Therefore blindfolding these patients usually makes their vestibular ataxia worse. This tactic is most helpful when you are not sure if the vestibular system is involved in the patient's clinical signs. Be cautious when you perform this test with large animals so that they do not fall and injure themselves or the observers. For horses and cattle, use a folded towel that is slipped under the halter so that it can be readily removed by pulling on one edge of the towel. Never tie the blindfold onto the halter. Cats often carry their tails elevated straight dorsally when they have a significant balance loss.",

            "text": "Nystagmus is an involuntary rhythmic oscillation of the eyes. Eye movements that are equal in each direction indicate a pendular nystagmus, which is uncommon, usually benign, and is associated with congenital visual system pathway abnormalities. Eye movements that are unequal, with a slow movement (slow phase) in one direction and a fast return (quick phase) of the eye to its starting position, indicate a jerk nystagmus, which can be normal or abnormal and reflect a dysfunction in the vestibular system. The direction of the nystagmus, by convention, is ascribed to the direction of the quick or fast phase of the jerk nystagmus. Both eyes are usually affected and usually in the same direction. This jerk nystagmus is a normal response to any rapid movement of the head. Stand over any normal dog and watch its eyes as you move the head in a horizontal-dorsal plane form side to side. You will observe a horizontal jerk nystagmus. As you move the head to the right, both eyes will repeatedly jerk quickly to the right with a slow return to the left. As you move the head to the left, the opposite will happen; both eyes will repeatedly jerk quickly to the left and slowly return to the right. This procedure is termed normal vestibular or physiologic nystagmus. Some textbooks refer to this response as vestibular-ocular nystagmus, or a doll's eye response. It evaluates not only the vestibular system, which is the sensory arm of this response, but also the medial longitudinal fasciculus in the brainstem and the abducent nerve innervation of the lateral rectus muscle that abducts the eye and the oculomotor nerve innervation of the medial rectus muscle that adducts the eye. If you flex and extend the neck so that the head moves up and down, the same eye movements will occur in a vertical direction. This event is a vertical jerk nystagmus. The quick phase of the nystagmus is always in the direction of the head movement. This response is a normal reflex in which the slow component is initiated by way of the vestibular receptors in the membranous labyrinth and the quick component involves a brainstem center related to the vestibular system. This reflex is important in maintaining visual fixation on stationary points as the body rotates.",

It normally occurs only when you move the head. With dysfunction of the vestibular system, a jerk nystagmus may be observed. If it is observed when the head is held in its normal extended (neutral) position, it is called a resting or spontaneous nystagmus. If it is induced only by holding the head fixed in lateral flexion or full extension, it is called a positional nystagmus. These events are both forms of abnormal nystagmus. If you are suspicious of the possibility of a vestibular system disorder, looking for positional nystagmus when you place the patient on its back with its neck extended may be useful. Remember that it is normal for nystagmus to occur when you move the head! How do you explain this abnormal nystagmus? If you consider the existence of a continual bilateral stimulation of vestibular neurons that constantly reflects the position or movement of the head and that this provides a balanced tonic stimulation of the vestibular nuclei on each side and from there to the nuclei that innervate the extraocular muscles, then any interruption of this balanced tonic stimulation might result in an alteration at the nuclei of the neurons that innervate extraocular muscles that results in nystagmus. With peripheral vestibular diseases, the imbalance represents a loss of tonic stimulation of the vestibular nuclei from the affected side.",

To determine the direction of a rotatory nystagmus, observe the direction that the 12-o'clock position of the pupil moves during the quick phase. This direction does not change when the position of the head is changed. Occasionally, an abnormal positional nystagmus may appear vertical, especially when the patient is in dorsal recumbency. Previous theories suggested that vertical nystagmus only occurred with disorders of the central vestibular system, but we now believe this idea may be incorrect and oversimplified. Some patients with disorders of the peripheral vestibular system have almost a vertical nystagmus, but careful examination will usually reveal a slight rotatory component. We no longer use vertical nystagmus alone to distinguish peripheral from central vestibular system disease. With disorders of the central components of the vestibular system, the nystagmus may be horizontal, rotatory, or vertical. It may be directed toward or away from the side of the lesion, and it may change in direction with the head held in different positions. Thus the presence of a nystagmus that is directed toward the side of the lesion or head tilt or changes direction with changes in the position of the head are the only reliable features of the abnormal nystagmus that indicate a central involvement of the vestibular system. Many patients with central vestibular system disease will have abnormal nystagmus that is horizontal or rotatory and is directed to the side opposite to the side of the lesion and does not change its direction with changes in head position. Therefore, to determine a disorder of the central vestibular system, you must identify clinical signs of the central lesion that involve other neurologic systems, especially the UMN and general proprioception (GP) systems. Resting nystagmus is more common in acute disorders of the peripheral components of the vestibular system, and the rate of either resting or positional nystagmus tends to be more rapid than when the disorder is in the central components of the vestibular system. Some patients with severe resting nystagmus exhibit a slight head rotation that occurs simultaneously with the nystagmus corresponding to its rate and direction. In addition, a simultaneous eyelid blink may be seen concomitant with the nystagmus, which presumably is a reflex action. These latter two findings are very common in rabbits.",

The quick phase is in the direction of the rotation, but this aspect cannot be seen as the animal is moving. In time, the rotation of the endolymph reaches the same speed of rotation of the labyrinth. At this constant velocity, the cupulae are not deflected. Thus no rotatory stimulus reaches the vestibular nerve, and nystagmus does not occur. When the rotation is suddenly stopped, once again, a disparity occurs in the rotation of the labyrinth and the endolymph. The labyrinth is stationary, and the endolymph continues to flow for a short interval during which it deflects the cupulae. Vestibular neurons are stimulated, and nystagmus occurs. However, the direction of flow is opposite to that which occurred during acceleration, and the quick phase of the nystagmus is directed opposite to the direction of the rotation. The speed and duration of this postrotatory nystagmus are variable but should be approximately equal when the response to rotation is compared for both directions.",

As a rule, when the patient is rotated in a direction opposite to the side of a peripheral receptor lesion, postrotatory nystagmus is depressed. This postrotatory test stimulates both labyrinths. However, the labyrinth on the outside of the rotation, on the side of the head opposite to the direction of rotation, is stimulated more because it is farther away from the axis of rotation, which may explain the abnormal postrotatory nystagmus that is observed with unilateral peripheral vestibular disease. On rotating the patient away from the side of the lesion, the diseased labyrinth is farthest from the axis of rotation. It cannot be stimulated properly because of the lesion, and a depressed postrotatory response may be observed. This test can be performed only on patients that are small enough to be picked up and held with your elbows extended. It requires two people, the holder and the examiner. The holder directs the head of the patient away from his or her body and spins in a circle as rapidly as possible for 6 to 7 rotations and stops suddenly. The examiner immediately grasps the head of the patient and observes the eyes for nystagmus. The eyes of the holder will show the same postrotatory response. For some large dogs, you can secure them in a rotating desk chair and spin them with the chair. In most small animals, this postrotatory response can be readily elicited. We perform this test only when the clinical signs of a peripheral vestibular disorder are subtle and a need exists for more supportive information or in a patient that is suspected of having a bilateral peripheral vestibular system disorder in which no normal nystagmus will occur; it is not reliable for determining the side of the lesion.",

An explanation for this paradox in the direction of the clinical signs of vestibular system dysfunction is based on the rule that the direction of the head tilt and balance loss will be toward the side of the least vestibular system activity. When we describe the physiologic anatomy of the cerebellum in Chapter 13, you will learn that the Purkinje neurons that form a single layer of cells in the cerebellar cortex are the only neurons that project their axons from the cerebellar cortex. These neurons are all inhibitory neurons that release gamma-amino butyric acid at their telodendria. Most of these neurons terminate via their telodendria on neuronal cell bodies in the cerebellar nuclei, which are located in the central portion of the cerebellum known as the cerebellar medulla. The neurons in these cerebellar nuclei comprise the majority of the efferent axons that leave the cerebellum to terminate in various brainstem nuclei. An exception to this rule is a small population of Purkinje neurons, most of which are located in the cortex of the folia of the flocculus in the hemisphere and the nodulus in the vermis. The Purkinje neurons of these cortical areas have axons that leave the cerebellum directly as a component of the caudal cerebellar peduncle. They terminate in the vestibular nuclei, where they are inhibitory to the activation of these neuronal cell bodies. A lesion in the caudal cerebellar peduncle interferes with this inhibition, resulting in excessive discharge of vestibular system neurons on that side. The imbalance in vestibular system activation between the two sides is recognized as a head tilt and loss of balance to the side opposite to this lesion because, as a rule, the direction of the head tilt and balance loss will be towards the side with the least activity of the vestibular system. This paradoxical syndrome is in contrast to lesions that cause a loss of activation of the neuronal cell bodies in the vestibular nuclei as seen in disorders of the peripheral components of the vestibular system or within the vestibular nuclei themselves.",

Because this disorder is most prevalent in aged dogs, it is often termed geriatric canine peripheral vestibular disease. The cause of the disorder is unknown. Microscopic study of euthanized patients are uncommon because most dogs will spontaneously recover, the procedure is not routine in most necropsy laboratories, and the process of decalcification that is required makes recognition of subtle abnormalities difficult. The rapid recovery suggests that this disease may be a functional disorder, possibly an alteration in the production and absorption of endolymph that causes increased pressure within the membranous labyrinth. This theory has been proposed for the pathogenesis of Meniere disease in humans, which is an episodic disorder of the inner-ear components. Vestibular neuronitis is described in humans with an acute onset of clinical signs of a peripheral vestibular system dysfunction. Spontaneous recovery occurs. A herpesvirus-induced vestibular ganglionitis and an autoimmune inner-ear inflammation have also been proposed in humans. Paroxysmal positional vertigo (dizziness) in humans has been related to one or more statoconia that detach from the statoconiorum membrane and lodge in one of the semicircular ducts. Recovery is associated with specific head position adjustments to dislodge the statoconia. Many of the acute peripheral vestibular diseases of humans are not well understood. 11, 17 The idiopathic canine disorder is rarely observed before 5 years of age. The clinical signs are usually peracute in onset and rapidly improve to near complete resolution by 1 to 3 weeks from the onset. Residual clinical signs are uncommon. A few dogs may have a persistent head tilt. However, recurrences occasionally occur after a variable period of weeks to months.

In small animals, the postganglionic sympathetic axons that innervate smooth muscle in the orbit course through or adjacent to the tympanic cavity, where they can be affected by the inflammation in middle-ear infections. Unknown is whether the dysfunction of the peripheral vestibular system requires inflammation within the inner ear or whether the alteration in pressure and temperature caused by the inflammation within the tympanic cavity is sufficient to cause these clinical signs. Otitis media is very common in small animals especially cats and young farm animals, which includes calves, C a s e e x a m p l e 1 2 -2 (Continued) lambs, kids, crias, and pigs (Figs. 12-5 through 12-9). Extension of this infection into the cranial cavity is common when this ear infection is not treated vigorously, and the results of the extension can be lethal. Three anatomic routes for infection can be used to obtain access to the tympanic cavity: (1) from otitis externa, (2) from nasopharyngeal infections extending through the auditory tube, and (3) hematogenous from a bacteremia. Clinical signs can be acute or chronic in onset and progressive. The clinical signs of peripheral vestibular dysfunction are usually less severe than in dogs with the benign idiopathic disorder. The otitis can be bilateral but the neurologic signs unilateral. Otoscopic examination may show changes in the middle-ear cavity with the tympanic membrane ruptured or still intact. However, the otitis media is often undetected with this procedure, and imaging is required for the diagnosis. For years, we have relied on radiographs, but both computed tomographic (CT) and MR imaging are more reliable. CT images are better than MR images to show the degree of bone involvement (see Fig. 12-6 ). Ideally, treatment should be based on isolation of the infectious agent and the use of specific antibacterial or antifungal drugs to which the agent is most susceptible. Remember to avoid the aminoglycoside antibiotics that are ototoxic. Surgery may be required for chronic cases.",

They often arise from the tissues of the external ear canal and invade the temporal bone but primary bone neoplasms occur as well (Fig. 12-10) . The anatomic diagnosis might well be identical to that in this dog. As the neoplasm expands medially, brainstem or cerebellar compression (or both) will result with corresponding clinical signs. Diagnosis is dependent on adequate imaging procedures. Squamous cell carcinoma is a common neoplasm that involves the ear of cats. Also note the thin plate of bone-septum bullae-that partially divides the tympanic cavity into a small dorsolateral and larger ventromedial portion. The two portions communicate near the tympanum. This septum only forms a small ridge in dogs. Note the soft tissue density in the left tympanic bulla and its partial destruction along with destruction of portions of the rest of the temporal bone by a sarcoma. signalment: 5.5-year-old female Chesapeake Bay retriever, Splash Chief Complaint: Head tilt, facial deformity and depression history: One year before this examination, the owner noticed that Splash had a slight right head tilt; the dog also tended to drool excessively from the right side of her mouth. One month before this examination, the owner noted that the right eye was sunken, and the head appeared to be deformed. For the 2 to 3 weeks before the examination, Splash was depressed and would occasionally stagger and fall. examination: See Video 12-6. Note the normal gait, and you should have appreciated that the hopping responses on the right side were consistently delayed and lacked the smooth quality seen with the left limbs. Paw replacement was normal. Note the absent right palpebral reflex but intact facial sensation, the elevated right ear with what we thought was increased tone in the right lips, and a very slight deviation of the philtrum to the right. Note the lack of temporal and masseter muscle mass on the right side. Splash resented having her mouth opened, and a mass lesion was palpated on the right side between the transverse process of the atlas and the caudal portion of the mandible. Not seen in the video was a persistent anisocoria with the right pupil always smaller than the left and an abnormal positional nystagmus when she was placed on her back. This nystagmus was vertical or directed to the right side. At the time of this examination, the right facial paralysis observed in this dog is associated with facial tetanus. Presumably the initial clinical signs of vestibular system dysfunction involved the peripheral components, but there is no way to prove this presumption. At the time of this examination, clinical signs of involvement of the UMN and GP systems were noted, most likely in the pons or medulla (or both), which might also affect the vestibular nuclei. The masticatory muscle atrophy implicates the mandibular nerve from the trigeminal nerve or motor nucleus of V in the pons. Otitis media-interna will not affect the trigeminal nerve or its ganglion where it passes through the canal for the trigeminal nerve in the rostral portion of the petrous part of the temporal bone. The thick portion of this bone that separates the tympanic cavity and this nerve prevents this occurrence. However, an erosive neoplasm in the temporal bone knows no boundaries. Presumably, this dog is deaf on her right side, but we cannot determine this loss of function in our physical neurologic examination. differential diagnosis: Neoplasm-intramedullary or extramedullary, abscess-granuloma secondary to otitis media-interna, focal encephalitis-granulomatous meningoencephalitis The quality of the hypermetria represents a cerebellar dysfunction based on the excessive flexion of the limb on protraction. In the overreaching form of hypermetria that was described with cervical C a s e e x a m p l e 1 2 -4 spinal cord disorders, the thoracic limb is in extension when protracted. See Video 12-8 described at the end of this case example. The slow hopping and hemiwalking with the right limbs supports a central nervous system (CNS) lesion involving the right UMN or GP systems (or both) in the caudal brainstem or the right side of the cerebellum. The head tilt and loss of balance are directed to the left, which suggests clinical signs of a paradoxical vestibular system disorder, unless multifocal lesions are present, such as right cerebellum and left vestibular nuclei. The clinical signs of a vestibular system disorder are profound. The quality of the gait abnormality, the deficit in postural reactions, and the abnormal nystagmus that changed direction with different head positions all support that the vestibular system involvement is in its central components. This finding indicates unequivocal central vestibular disease! 46 differential diagnosis: Neoplasm, inflammation, vascular compromise, malformation, toxicity, hypothyroidism neoplasM Based on the progressive nature of the clinical signs, neoplasia and focal inflammation are the two most common clinical disorders for consideration in this patient. Neoplasms in the caudal cranial fossa include intramedullary glioma, medulloblastoma (primitive neuroectodermal tumor), choroid plexus papilloma or carcinoma, ependymoma, and extraparenchymal meningioma.",

An autoimmune disease has also been proposed. GME tends to be more common in young adult smallto medium-sized breeds, but any breed at any age can be affected. The angiocentric lesions predominate in the white matter and can be diffusely distributed through the brain and spinal cord, occur in multifocal sites, or be primarily located at one site where the perivascular and parenchymal proliferation of lymphoplasmacytic cells and macrophages (histiocytes) can be so extensive as to cause a mass lesion. Lesions in the cerebellum, pons, and medulla are common. A localized form is thought to occur in the optic nerves causing an optic neuritis. Optic neuritis is described in Chapter 14 on the visual system. CSF usually reflects the lesion with marked elevation of protein and nonsuppurative inflammatory cells. MR imaging is the preferred procedure to show these lesions, especially when they are focal. These lesions are hyperintense on T2-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion-recovery (FLAIR) images. Contrast enhancement is variable. Immunosuppressive drugs such as prednisone or oral cyclosporine and lomustine may be effective at slowing or stopping the progression of the disease and alleviating some of the clinical signs.

See examples in Chapter 13 on the cerebellum. However, the clinical signs should be acute in onset and not progress over more than 24 hours as a rule. Malformation was included in the differential diagnosis because the caudal cranial fossa is a common site for epidermoid or dermoid cysts to occur. 28 These cysts are thought to be developmental in origin and result from an abnormality when the neural tube folds and closes in this area and separates from the overlying ectoderm. The epithelial lining of these cysts proliferates and secretes, causing the cyst to enlarge and, in time, produce clinical signs from its mass effect. Severe clinical signs of dysfunction in the components of the caudal cranial fossa occur with metronidazole toxicity, but these are usually symmetric and require a history of exposure to this drug. 14 Hypothyroidism has been associated in adult dogs with an acute onset of persistent or progressive clinical signs of a caudal cranial fossa lesion that included involvement of the central components of the vestibular system. 23 In this study, thyroid function evaluations were abnormal and all responded to treatment with levothyroxine.

Remember in cases such as this one to look at the breed and ask yourself if any recognized inherited degenerative disorder is described for this breed that causes similar clinical signs. When you search for this data in your textbooks or on the Internet, your answer will be yes. In 1975, Dr. Jack McGrath at the University of Pennsylvania described a fibrinoid encephalomyelopathy (Alexander disease) in two 8-monthold littermate Labrador retrievers with clinical signs of a diffuse CNS disorder. 33 This degeneration is a disorder of astrocytes. It is associated with a loss of myelin, especially in the cerebral white matter. Thus this disease is also known as leukodystrophy. The abnormal astrocytes are widely distributed in the CNS, but their perivascular density and the myelin loss in the cerebral white matter will appear as a diffuse bilaterally symmetric hyperintensity in T2-weighted and protondensity MR images. In 1985, Dr. Dennis O'Brien described a spongy degeneration of CNS white matter, a leukodystrophy, in Labrador retrievers. 37, 52 The onset of clinical signs for the dogs in this report was 4 to 6 months of age. The lesion consists of a separation of the myelin lamellae, causing a dilation of the myelin sheath caused by the accumulation of fluid between lamellae, known as myelin edema. It is found throughout the CNS and is especially prominent where large bundles of white matter are found, such as the spinal cord, cerebellar medullary and folial white matter, internal capsule, centrum semiovale, and corona radiata. These lesions are hypointense on T1-weighted MR images and hyperintense on the T2-weighted images. An autosomal-recessive gene inheritance is presumed but is not yet proven. Roxy had a littermate that was euthanized at 4 months of age for generalized seizures, but no necropsy was performed. Roxy was euthanized, and a necropsy confirmed the diagnosis of a leukodystrophy similar to that described by O'Brien.",

Reuben was brought to the hospital that day and videoed the next morning. examination: See Video 12-12. Note how alert this cat is. Note also his normal quick limb movements as he attempts to maintain his balance. He staggers to either side but more often to the left, which is the side of his head tilt and head turn. In the first portion of the video, when he looks left, note the brief head rotations. These movements correspond to the resting right nystagmus that is present. When you perform the hopping responses in cats, many of them will simply roll over and not respond at all. To prevent this result, hold the cat up and grasp the three limbs that you are not testing, and suddenly lower the cat to the ground with the limb to be hopped extended. As soon as the limb strikes the ground, move the cat laterally on it, and the normal cat will at least give you a few hops before rolling over.

(See the discussion of the similar benign idiopathic canine disorder.) Because this disease in cats occurs at the same time of year as the acute-onset brain disease caused by the myiasis of the larva of a Cuterebra sp., some neurologists have hypothesized that this peripheral vestibular syndrome is caused by the migration of this larva in the middle and inner ear. No definitive proof has been found of this occurrence whatsoever. No Cuterebra sp. larva have been found in any part of the ear of a cat with or without these clinical signs, and the few necropsies that included study of the innerear structures have not found a recognizable lesion. Investigators have reported that this disease can occur in cats that have no access to the outdoors, but these reports are rare. The high incidence of this disorder from late July through September in outdoor cats implies some environmental factor (e.g., insect toxin, toxic spray, plant pollen) that may cause ototoxicity. This factor is unknown. The clinical signs are peracute in onset and typical for a severe dysfunction of the peripheral vestibular system. Although the clinical signs predominate to one side, a bilateral disturbance is suggested by the occasional wide head excursions to either side and the tendency of the cat to stagger in both directions. Fortunately, most of these cats will recover spontaneously. Their vestibular ataxia will be greatly improved by 7 to 10 days, and the head tilt usually resolves by 2 to 4 weeks. Occasionally, a residual head tilt persists. Even recovered cats may exhibit a slight head tilt and balance loss if they are significantly stressed. Without more knowledge of the cause of the pathogenesis of this disorder and the spontaneous recovery, treatment of these cats is unnecessary. However, the use of antibiotics is rational as a treatment for a possible otitis, which is the other most common cause of these clinical signs. Keep these cats in a protected environment while they recover. Rarely does this disorder recur in cats, which is unlike the canine disorder. Experimental surgical ablation of the inner ear of a cat will cause similar clinical signs, including recovery by cerebellomedullary compensation. 9 This disease represents just another of many reasons to keep cats indoors.",

While still under anesthesia, both ears were flushed despite no indication of any otitis externa. Be aware that ear flushing procedures can cause complications and should be avoided unless absolutely necessary! On recovery from anesthesia, Fractal exhibited the clinical signs that you see on this video. Fractal did not startle even with rigorous banging of pans together behind his head as a source of a loud noise, and electrophysiologic testing (brainstem auditory evoked response [BAER]) showed no ability to stimulate a response in the cochlear nerves bilaterally. Ear flushing of any kind can result in what you have seen here, despite any indication of preexisting otitis externa. You cannot assess the tympanum for its barrier function, and small perforations may not be recognized.",

This video shows a 10-week-old female domestic shorthair with a 1-week history of losing her balance and what the owner described as \"rolling eyes. \" Two days before this video was made, this kitten began to exhibit wide head excursions. Otitis media-interna was diagnosed in each ear. Treatment for otitis requires long-term oral antibiotics. Surgery is sometimes necessary, especially when the otitis is associated with polyp formation. Corticosteroids should definitely be avoided. We have seen numerous cases of otitis that have been treated with long-term corticosteroids that, secondary to immunosuppression, resulted in an abscess of the petrous portion of the temporal bone and eventual compression of the medulla and pons.",

These clinical signs are unilateral or bilateral and often affect both the vestibular nerve and the cochlear nerve or their labyrinthine receptors in the membranous labyrinth. Whether the vestibular system lesions are malformative or an early-onset abiotrophy is unknown. This lesion has been observed in many breeds of small animals with no proof of the presumed inheritance of the disorder. These breeds include the German shepherd, 45 Doberman pinscher, Akita, beagle, English cocker spaniel, 2 and Burmese and Siamese cats. Some of these affected animals improve or even recover in time, presumably from compensation by vestibular system components in the CNS. No microscopic lesions have been recognized in the inner ears of patients that have been studied, but mild lesions of degeneration such as an abiotrophy are difficult to recognize after the process of decalcification of the inner ear that is required to prepare tissue sections for study.",

Otitis media-interna was diagnosed and treated with antibiotics. Despite 1 month of this therapy, her clinical signs worsened. examination: See Video 12-19 . Study the severe clinical signs of vestibular system dysfunction and determine whether the involvement of this system is central or peripheral or both. Anatomic diagnosis: Cerebellum, pons, and medulla, sympathetic innervation to the head You should have recognized the episodes of opisthotonus and extensor muscle rigidity in the limbs and trunk, the UMN paresis and GP ataxia in the limbs that was worse on the left side, the left facial paralysis, left facial hypalgesia, and the left sympathetic paresis. The last of these signs suggests that, in addition to the caudal cranial fossa brain lesion, a left middle-ear lesion is present or that there is one disorder affecting all of these structures. The latter diagnosis is suspected based on the palpable mass shown at the end of the video on the left side in the angle between the mandible and the transverse process of the atlas. Normally, you should be able to place your finger in a groove between these two structures as on the right side in this cat. differential diagnosis: Neoplasm, inflammation-abscess neoplasM Based on the assumption that the palpable mass near the area of the anatomic diagnosis is responsible for the clinical signs, a neoplasm or unusually large abscess or granuloma is the most likely clinical diagnosis. Radiographs suggested an aggressive neoplasm, with involvement of all portions of the left temporal bone that compressed the CNS components in the caudal cranial fossa on the left side (Figs. [12] [13] [14] [15] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] . Pepi was euthanized, and necropsy confirmed this clinical diagnosis. The neoplasm was identified as a squamous cell carcinoma (Figs.

Infection with the corona virus that causes an exudative peritonitis in cats is termed feline infectious peritonitis. Many of these cats that have an exudative peritonitis also have a mild subclinical meningitis. A few cats develop an extensive chronic FIP viral meningoencephalomyelitis with profound neurologic signs and minimal peritonitis. 26, 34, 43 FIP viral meningoencephalomyelitis is by far the most common infectious disease of the CNS in cats, especially young cats. This abnormality is primarily a surface-oriented disease, which means that the leptomeninges on the external surface of the brain and spinal cord are affected, and the internal ependymallined ventricular system is also affected. The latter area includes the choroid plexuses and the central canal of the spinal cord. This disease is an immunopathologic disorder that involves an immune complex-induced vasculitis. The virus can be found in macrophages in the lesion. The degree of accumulation of inflammatory cells can be extensive enough to be seen on gross examination of the CNS, as well as on MR images. Although clinical signs can reflect involvement by this lesion at any level of the CNS, they often relate to the lesions in the area of the cerebellum, pons, and medulla, known as the caudal cranial fossa. One study reported pelvic limb paresis, abnormal nystagmus, and seizures as the most common clinical signs observed with this disease. Uveitis may also accompany the neurologic disorder. Clinical signs are slowly progressive and often include partial anorexia and a fever that are unresponsive to antibiotic therapy. The globulin fraction of serum protein is often elevated, and the CSF often is very abnormal, with protein levels even as high as 0.5 to 1.0 g/dl (normal <20 mg/dl) and hundreds of WBCs/mm 3 that vary from all mononuclear cells to a high percentage of neutrophils. Serum antibodies against this virus are usually, but not always, present in these cats. However, the antibodies are not specific for this virus but rather for the group of corona viruses.",

As a rule, serum antibodies will be present in cats with toxoplasmosis, and an antigen test will detect cryptococcal organisms in the serum or CSF. These fungal organisms are usually evident in the cytologic examination of the CSF. Cats with an extension of infection from the middle and inner ear may produce evidence of this ear infection on your physical examination and should have recognizable temporal bone lesions on imaging studies. Cuterebra myiasis is less likely to cause such a slow progression of neurologic signs or the persistent fever. In addition, Cuterebra myiasis is seasonal. Lymphosarcoma most commonly causes an extradural focal compression of the spinal cord but is occasionally within the parenchyma and diffusely distributed through the CNS, primarily in the meninges and the perivascular spaces within the CNS. CSF changes would be expected to be mild and may include lymphocytes, lymphoblasts, or both. Many forms of neuronal storage diseases have been recognized in cats that cause slowly progressive diffuse neurologic signs of CNS dysfunction. Diffuse whole-body actionrelated repetitive myoclonus (tremor) is often present with storage diseases along with primarily prosencephalic signs of loss of vision, change in behavior, and seizures.

            "text": "A unique bone disorder often accompanies this otitis in horses. This abnormality is a temporohyoid osteopathy, which involves an ankylosis of this joint associated with a proliferation of the long stylohyoid bone and probably the very small tympanohyoid by which it articulates with the petrous portion of the temporal bone. This circumstance results in a fusion of these bones at the level of the tympanic portion of the temporal bone. 5, 16, 47 This bony proliferation envelops the tympanic portion of the temporal bone but does not invade the tympanic cavity (see Fig. 6 -41.) With this loss of mobility of the hyoid apparatus, a risk of fracture of the petrous portion of the temporal bone exists. The assumption is that the otitis precedes and induces the osteopathy, but no proof has been found. The few microscopic studies on the osteopathy have never shown any indication of an osteomyelitis. The cause of this bone lesion remains unknown and has not been observed in other species. The lesion is unrelated to any disease within the guttural pouch. The assumption is that the ankylosis is secondary to the infection, and the extensive enlargement of the stylohyoid bone is secondary to the immobility of this joint, which prevents normal remodeling of the bone. In some horses, the onset of clinical signs of vestibular nerve dysfunction and the facial paralysis are sudden and thought to be caused by the temporal bone fracture, especially in the few horses that exhibit a brief period of partial dysphagia from presumed involvement of cranial nerves IX and X at the jugular foramen. The latter development cannot be caused by the otitis. Whether otitis was present in these horses before the fracture is unknown. Occasionally, the bone lesion is bilateral, but the neurologic signs have always been unilateral. Radiographs will reveal the enlarged stylohyoid bone with fusion to the temporal bone, but this circumstance prevents evaluation of the middle-ear cavity. The ventrodorsal view is the most reliable view to observe this bone lesion but requires general anesthesia. Although CT imaging is the preferred way to diagnose this disorder and may reveal the fracture when it is present, general anesthesia is required. The enlargement of the stylohyoid bone, as well as the lack of movement C a s e e x a m p l e 1 2 -1 2 at the temporohyoid articulation, can be seen through the wall of the guttural pouch on endoscopic examination. See Video 12-23 of an endoscopic examination of the guttural pouch of another adult horse that has a left-side stylohyoidosteopathy. The first portion of the video shows the left guttural pouch with the enlarged caudal portion of the stylohyoid bone and the lack of any movement at its articulation with the temporal bone. The last portion of the video shows the right guttural pouch with a normal stylohyoid bone. Note the movement of this bone at its articulation. You may suspect this abnormality during your physical examination by pressing dorsally on the basihyoid bone and assessing the range of motion of the hyoid apparatus, which depends on a mobile tympanohyoid articulation. You will feel resistance in horses with this bone lesion and fusion at this articulation. To prevent fracture related to this bone fusion, a portion of the affected stylohyoid bone is removed, or, more recently, the entire ceratohyoid bone has been removed. The latter surgery is easier to perform and has fewer complications.",

The only recognized cause of unilateral atrophy of the muscles of mastication in the horse at this time is an infection with S. neurona with loss of these GSE neuronal cell bodies and replacement by astrocytes. No obvious clinical signs of vestibular system dysfunction are noted in this horse. This horse was treated for several weeks with antiprotozoal drugs and recovered his normal gait.

These signs include facial paralysis, tongue paresis, dysphagia, jaw paresis, and dysfunction of the central components of the vestibular system, along with clinical signs of UMN and GP system dysfunction and loss of their normal sensorium. Some patients continually circle. This circling appears more as a propulsive circling than circling caused by a loss of balance with a vestibular system dysfunction. However, this circumstance is poorly correlated with specific lesion location. Prosencephalic lesions are uncommon with listeriosis yet are the most common cause of propulsive movements. The propulsive circling may possibly occur in these ruminants with listeriosis from involvement of the substantia nigra in the mesencephalon. The prominent caudal brainstem location of this disease reflects the likely route of entrance to the brain for this bacterium. The bacterium enters the body through abrasions and lacerations of the oral mucosa and gains access to the dendritic zones of general somatic afferent (GSA) neurons in the branches of the trigeminal nerve. The bacterium travels retrograde over these axons through the trigeminal ganglion and into the pons, where the fifth cranial nerve attaches to the brainstem. Inflammation occurs in these nerve branches and in the caudal brainstem. Small foci of necrosis filled with neutrophils are scattered primarily through the pons and medulla. Adjacent to these necrotic foci is a nonsuppurative inflammation that includes the meninges. The CSF usually reflects the nonsuppurative component of the inflammation. Rigorous treatment with penicillin will usually improve or resolve the clinical signs in cattle that are still standing. The prognosis is less favorable in small ruminants. Recumbent animals have a poor prognosis regardless of the species. Be aware that this bacterium can affect humans; thus you should, at least, wear protective gloves for this examination and administration of therapy. This organism thrives in poorly prepared silage (pH greater than 5.5), and removal of this as a feed source may prevent further affected animals on the same farm.

The right head tilt, abnormal nystagmus, and the rolling episode to the right indicate a paradoxical involvement of the central components of the vestibular system from a lesion in the left cerebellar peduncles or a lesion in the right vestibular nuclei. differential diagnosis: Listeriosis, caprine arthritis encephalitis (CAE) viral encephalitis, Parelaphostrongylus tenuis myiasis, abscess, neoplasm Listeriosis, CAE, and P. tenuis myiasis are all common diseases of goats in the Northeast, which can occur at this anatomic site. This goat came from a CAE-free herd in the state of Washington and had no serum antibodies for this viral agent. White tail deer are not indigenous to the state of Washington, and this goat had been in New York State for only 1 week before clinical signs were observed. This time period is too short for this goat to ingest an infected mollusk or the stage-3 larva of P. tenuis and develop neurologic signs. Experimentally, the earliest that clinical signs were observed after feeding large quantities of stage-3 larvae to sheep and goats was 11 days. The history reveals no sign of otitis media-interna with neurologic signs to suspect an intracranial extension of that suppurative lesion. In addition, no history of any illness was found to cause a bacteremia that might result in a brain abscess. Neoplasia is rare in goats, especially at this age. Medulloblastoma (primitive neuroectodermal tumor) occurs in the cerebellum of young calves. Listeriosis was considered to be the presumptive clinical diagnosis. The CSF contained 35 mg/dl of protein (normal <40) and 15 WBCs/mm 3 , with 67% monocytes and 33% lymphocytes. This buck was treated with antibiotics for 10 days but showed no improvement. He was euthanized, and necropsy showed a large well-encapsulated abscess centered in the left cerebellar peduncles and left cerebellar medulla (Fig. 12-26) . 22 No source of this focal infection was found. This lesion would have been evident on CT scan or MR imaging. See Video 12-35. This video shows a 4-year-old castrated male Pygmy goat that was found one afternoon with a right head tilt and circling to his left. He was worse the next day when the examination seen in the video was made. Note his severe disorientation, his right head tilt, and a tendency to drift right. Also note that his gait shows only a vestibular ataxia, and note the difficulty with holding this goat stable while trying to evaluate the hopping responses. We concluded that the hopping responses in his right limbs were mildly slow. Note his abnormal resting nystagmus. Not shown was the shift in the direction of the nystagmus with changes in the position of his head. The anatomic diagnosis is right cerebellum, pons, and medulla. The differential diagnosis is the same as that in this case example. This animal is a New York State goat, where the white tail deer are plentiful. CAE is unlikely at this age. Listeriosis and myiasis with the larva of P. tenuis are the most presumptive clinical diagnoses for this goat. Listeriosis is the more common cause of these brainstem signs. The CSF contained 170 mg/dl protein (normal <40) and 312 WBCs/mm 3 , with 52% neutrophils, 17% lymphocytes, 31% macrophages, and no eosinophils. This goat was euthanized and a necropsy diagnosed a necrotizing meningoencephalitis associated with L. monocytogenes organisms. cord location of listeriosis. The latter circumstance may be the result of the lack of lesions in the spinal cord or the masking of these UMN and GP system lesions by the pontomedullary lesions that affect the same systems. See Video 11-33 in Case Example 11-10. This is a lamb with profound spinal cord lesions caused by listeriosis.",

In the United States, these dogs are called Belgian sheepdogs. This extreme nystagmus was pendular, which varied in rate but was usually quite rapid. No obvious visual deficiency was noted, and ocular examination was normal. Occasionally, a dog briefly held its head to one side as it was about to jump down from a table level. No ataxia was evident. The head would occasionally oscillate with the nystagmus. Necropsy of the three littermates revealed a complete lack of any optic chiasm (Figs. 12-27 through 12-29). The optic nerve fibers continued into the ipsilateral optic tract uninterrupted and without any indication of decussation. Two of these dogs were 4 years of age at the time of necropsy, and their nystagmus had not changed. On the presumption that this malformation was an inherited disorder, and at the request of a neuroscientist interested in what determines the crossing of axons at the optic chiasm, the owner repeated the mating that produced these three affected dogs, resulting in more achiasmatic puppies with a pendular nystagmus and numerous publications. 24, 48 These studies established that the retina is relatively normal in these dogs, and the effect of the autosomal-recessive inherited mutation is most likely exerted outside the retina.",
