Segment is the basic unit, or building block to interpret DNA. The intron, exon and transcription factor are sections of DNA and play different roles in the transcription process. A gene is also a segment that can be used for making protein. The collection of segmented DNA can be further analyzed to show how the genes regulate each other and how those segments works. However, the reason that the segments can only exist at certain locations and the rules behind them are still unclear.",

The idea behind this technique is that there exist similar patterns in different DNA sequences. In other words, the patterns in a strand of DNA sequence may have high possibility to be found in the strand of other DNA sequences. Researchers have dedicated to locate functional regions for decades. Statisticians try to locate the regions which satisfy the assumption of statistical models. Bernaola-Galvan et al. [1] provide a segmentation algorithm based on the Jensen-Shannon entropic divergence. This algorithm is used to decompose long-range correlated DNA sequences into statistically significant, compositionally homogeneous patches. Fujiwara et al. [2] developed a hidden Markov model that represents known sequence characteristics of mito-chondrial targeting signals to predict the existence of the mitochondrial targeting signals. The signal is the presequence that directs nascent proteins bearing it to mitochondria. Hidden Markov model were also used in extracting motifs for predicting the binding sites of unknown transcription factors, without a priori knowledge, from functionally related DNA sequences [3] . Machine learning methods are capable of building the models automatically and, then, the huge number of combinations of features can be tested [17, 18] . For example, Sonnenburg et al. [4] use the kernel weight to determine the exon start. Garc\u00eda-Pedrajas et al. [5] developed the methods to cope with class imbalance problems for decision tree and support vector machine [6, 7] in the problems of translation initiation site recognition.",

There are also attempts [11, 12] to study the relationship between biological sequences and the Chomsky hierarchy [10] . The simple recurrent network (SRN) [13] is a hyper-Turing machine [14] . It has been shown [13, 15] that it can learn arbitrary underlying grammars and automata from the presentation of sentences. Such automata-like structure is extremely difficult to reach by any statistical ways, for example, hidden Markov model. It is also argued [16] that Elman network can accommodate quasi-regular structure and makes use of this structure for predictions and inferences. Such quasi-grammartical structure cannot be analyzed by any rule-based systems. We expect that the DNA sequence could contain such kind structures. So, this network is a potential candidate to analyze DNA sequence. Specifically, the large prediction errors indicate the segmentation points [13] . We show an example to reveal such quasiregular structures in the end of Section 3. SARS genome is used in the first experiment. Then we employ two types of SRN to analyze influenza A virus. One type uses the perceptrons in the hidden layer and the other type uses self-organizing neurons in the hidden layer. The former can be trained by the back-propagation algorithm (BP). The later can be trained by the self-organizing rule. We did extensive simulations to find suitable parameters for SRN. The reason why we analyze the influenza A virus is that its subtype H1N1 was the cause of human influenza in 2009. Its HA (Hemagglutinin) region is responsible for binding the virus to the cell and causes infection [19] . Since hemagglutinin is the major surface protein of the influenza A virus and is essential to the entry process into a cell, it is the primary target of neutralizing antibodies.",

The four nucleotides are A [1, \u00c01, \u00c01, \u00c01] T , C [\u00c01, 1, \u00c01, \u00c01] T , T [\u00c01, \u00c01, 1, \u00c01] T , and G [\u00c01, \u00c01, \u00c01, 1] T . Each positive bit indicates one nucleotide. The number of dimensions of the context layer, which is the same as that of the hidden layer, is N. The number of dimensions of output layer is the same as that of the input layer. From extensive experiments, we set 20 hidden neurons in the first part of this work.

The learning rate is reduced by (12) during the 1000 epochs. After training, we present the sequence again and record the prediction errors for all nucleotides. We repeat this training procedure for 300 times, hence, we obtain 300 trained SRNs and get 300 different prediction error sequences. Fig. 2 plots the 300 learning curves during the training processes. Each error point in a curve is the average error of all nucleotides in the 11 sequences. The network initially outputs [\u00c01, \u00c01, \u00c01, \u00c01] for each input nucleotide pattern and the training makes the output to fit the next nucleotide in the sequence.

Error magnitude is represented by the gray level, white represents the largest error and black represents no error. These prediction errors are the averaged error values obtained after the 300 training procedures.

We try three different kinds of conditions and each of them changes only one variable. Firstly, Table 4 shows the setting with different number of hidden neurons listed in the column ''# hidden neurons''. Fig. 6(a) plots the results of the training. The learning curves in Fig. 6(a1) shows that when we use dense neurons in the hidden layer we will get small errors. Each learning curve is the average over 50 repeated simulations. Fig. 6(a2) shows the histogram of the converged errors for all 50 repeated simulations. Secondly, we use different number of sequences to train the network and plot their learning curves. Table 5 lists the number of randomly chosen sequences in different simulations and the average lengths. Fig. 6 (b1) plots the learning curves averaged over 50 simulations with different number of sequences. These curves show that when the number of sequences increases, the durations for convergence do not increase much. This phenomenon reveals that most sequences have similar hidden structures. Small group of sequences contain sufficient information to represent the rest sequences. Fig. 6(b2) shows the distribution of the converged errors. We randomly select 50 sequences and cut the rest portions of these sequences from the beginning. Table 6 lists the different lengths of those sequences. Note that the randomly chosen 50 sequences in different simulations are not the same. Fig. 6 (c1) plots the learning curves of different lengths of sequences.

DISOM can sort the sequences and find their distances to the grandmother virus. We select the 1032 sequences sampled from January to May 2009 to simplify the computation.

The learning 50 curves for the SRN with 40 hidden neurons and trained by BP are also plotted in Fig. 8(a) . The BP learning curves show that the SRN tries to find information and rules in time and the rules compete against each other. We see that the curve jumps up and down rapidly.

This method was used in Elman's work [13] to group the meanings of words. It aggregates the clusters, which have minimum distances, and constructs a binary tree by merging clusters. After constructing the tree, one can cut the leaf nodes by setting a threshold distance. In the communication between Plate and Elman, they have noticed that the activation of hidden neurons is affected by the input, ''. . . The hidden unit activation patterns are highly dependent upon preceding inputs. . . '', see line 2 of page 199 in [13] . In Fig. 9 , we generate the dendrogram with no more than eight leaf nodes instead of four in order to visualize more information. Setting eight clusters in this case means each one of the four clusters, corresponding to the four nucleotides, is further divided into two groups. The colors of the 8 leaf nodes are listed on the top of this figure. The cluster intensities are assigned by the levels of the leaf nodes. This is because nodes in the same cluster should have similar intensities. For example, in Fig. 9(a1) , the node 5 has an intensity black which corresponds to grey code 1. Node 7 has an intensity as that of code 2 and node 6 has an intensity code 3 and so on. Similar structures can be found in the two different methods. Group (1, 7, 2) in (a2) is similar to group (5, 4, 6) in (b2). Without considering the link length, (a2) is isomorphic to (b2), this is because there is a bijective mapping from nodes (5, 6, 1, 7, 2, 3, 8, 4) in (a2) to nodes (3, 2, 5, 4, 6, 1, 8, 7) in (b2).

Without any prior biological knowledge and only processing the ATCG sequences, the result is strikingly consistent with the findings from biologists. This implies that we can use this new technology to study more complicated genomes which are still a mystery to biologists. The underlying structures detected by SRN provide new types of features for further biological studies. By ranking the errors, this technology provides the priorities for biologists to choose which part of the genomes is worth to study. The results of the proposed segmentation method can be used in distinguishing an artificial DNA segment from an natural segment, because the nucleotides joined together in the natural environment may be different from the one joined in the laboratory.
