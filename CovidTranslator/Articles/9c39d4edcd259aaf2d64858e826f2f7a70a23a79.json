These forward genetic screens have markedly contributed to our understanding of many fundamental biological processes [1] [2] [3] [4] , but their application to cultured mammalian cells was challenging.

For example, claudin 1 (CLDN1) 18 and occludin (OCLN) 19 were identified as entry receptors for HCV by transducing a non-permissive cell line with a cDNA library derived from hepatocellular carcinoma cells. In addition to discovering receptors, an unbiased expression screen also discovered that SEC14-like protein 2 (SEC14L2), which is a cytosolic lipid-binding protein, enhances the replication of clinical strains of HCV 20 . Furthermore, a library of ~380 interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) was used to identify key proteins that are important for innate immune defences against several DNA and RNA viruses 21, 22 . In addition to these screens, in a continuing effort, comprehensive cDNA libraries that contain all annotated ORFs from humans have been cloned into lentiviral expression vectors 23 , generating an expression vector library that is likely to improve the utility of gain-of-function screens in the study of host-pathogen interactions.",

Initial approaches that used RNAi have provided valuable insights into virus-host relationships 24 . In contrast to RNAi, which leads to the partial depletion of expression for a specific gene, recent technological advances have made it possible to completely disrupt gene expression (TABLE 1) . One approach, termed haploid genetic screening, relies on insertional mutagenesis of genes in cultured haploid cell lines. For example, retroviral gene traps that contain a splice acceptor site can integrate into the host genome, leading to the expression of truncated mRNA transcripts 7 . The complete ablation of gene expression can have marked effects on virus replication and enables the identification of the most crucial host factors for virus infection. Insertional mutagenesis in haploid cells has been used to discover essential receptors for several viruses, including Ebola virus and Lassa virus 25, 26 . Both viruses use abundant lysosomal proteins as receptors. The interaction between the Ebola virus glycoprotein and its receptor Niemann-Pick C1 protein (NPC1) is triggered by cathepsin cleavage 27, 28 , whereas the Lassa virus glycoprotein interacts with its receptor, lysosomeassociated membrane glycoprotein 1 (LAMP1), following acidification of the endosome. Subsequent structural studies defined the binding interface between the viral glycoprotein and NPC1 (REFS 29-31). Interestingly, several mutations arose in the host-binding site of the viral glycoprotein during the 2013-2016 Ebola virus epidemic. These mutations increased the infectivity of the virus in primate cells but not in rodent cells, which suggests that these mutations contributed to adaptation and spread in humans 32, 33 .",

Whether a cell is permissive or nonpermissive to virus infection is determined by the expression of genes that facilitate virus replication and genes that restrict virus infection.

CRISPR-Cas genome editing has been reported for a wide range of cell lines that can be infected with many viruses. However, large-scale genetic screens in which the sgRNAs are introduced into the cells in a pooled manner have some limitations. To ensure the appropriate representation of each of the sgRNAs in the pool, numerous cells are transduced and undergo phenotypic selection. In practice, many transformed cell lines will be suitable for generating a mutagenized cell library; however, primary cells have a limited proliferative capacity, and it is therefore more challenging to transduce and expand these cells in large numbers. Pre-arrayed sgRNA formats, in which wells contain individual synthetic sgRNA constructs for reverse transfection 36 , may therefore be more suitable for primary cells.",

More recently constructed CRISPR-Cas libraries (for example, the Broad Brunello 44 , Toronto KnockOut 13 or Sabatini-Lander libraries 45 ) contain more sgRNAs per gene (up to 12), which increases the likelihood of statistically significant enrichment of candidate genes. However, larger sgRNA libraries also require larger-scale screening, which could be challenging to achieve, especially in cells that have a limited capacity to divide. Notably, a small sgRNA library that contains a subset of sgRNAs from a larger CRISPR-Cas library was still able to identify the majority of the same hits, albeit with less statistical significance 44 . This suggests that when scaling up is unfeasible owing to cost or cell number, sgRNA libraries that contain fewer sgRNAs per gene can be used in an initial screen, which can then be followed by a secondary screen and/or careful validation.",

Approaches that use dCas9 for this purpose are commonly referred to as CRISPR activation (CRISPRa) and CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) 156 . To achieve transcriptional repression (that is, CRISPRi), chromatin-modifying repressor domains, such as the Kr\u00fcppel-associated box (KRAB) domain, are fused to dCas9 and are recruited to transcription start sites. CRISPRi-mediated and RNAi-mediated knockdown both lead to the downregulation of gene expression, albeit through different molecular mechanisms. CRISPRi occurs by inhibiting transcription, whereas RNAi degrades mRNAs in the cytoplasm. CRISPRa relies on the fusion of dCas9 to multiple repeats of the herpes simplex virus VP16 activation domain (VP64 or VP160) to enhance transcription at target sites. Alternatively, in the synergistic activation mediator (SAM) library, MS2 RNA aptamers added to the tetraloop and second stem-loop of the sgRNA additionally recruit a fusion construct of the bacteriophage MS2 coat protein (MCP), the nuclear factor-\u03baB subunit p65 and heat shock factor protein 1 to enhance Cas9-mediated gene expression 157 . CRISPRa and SAM libraries are an alternative approach for gain-offunction screens (FIG. 1) , which traditionally rely on complementary DNA (cDNA) overexpression libraries 23 . The activation of endogenous gene expression has the advantage of not being limited by conventional molecular cloning techniques to generate cDNA constructs and can be used to increase the expression of different isoforms from the same gene. Although Cas9-mediated gene activation has not been used in the context of virus-host studies, it may be used to identify antiviral restriction factors or host factors that are expressed at very low levels and are required for virus replication.",

In a pooled screen, in which mutant cells are cultured together, the selection can be extremely stringent because of the requirement that resistant cells survive multiple rounds of infection. Therefore, this screening method identifies genes for which disruption causes marked phenotypes. Strong selection conditions in which >99% of cells die from infection are preferred. Although this high stringency increases the confidence in the candidate genes identified, other genes that have subtler effects on virus infection may be missed. Decreasing the stringency could help to identify these genes. Strategies to achieve this include the use of naturally attenuated virus strains or the use of antiviral compounds during selection.

The sgRNA integrations are PCR-amplified and sequenced by next-generation sequencing to quantify their relative abundances. The level of sgRNA enrichment in phenotypically selected cells compared with that in unselected cells is determined by comparing the number of reads that map to specific sgRNAs in the different cell populations. To normalize for differences in sequencing depth between populations, the number of reads that map to each specific sgRNA is divided by the total number of reads. Bioinformatic tools can help to determine whether a gene is significantly enriched over background by assessing the level of enrichment of multiple sgRNAs against the same gene.

The OST complex catalyses the N-linked glycosylation of newly synthesized proteins. In mammalian cells, two distinct OST multiprotein complexes are formed, each composed of a catalytic subunit (one of two paralogues, STT3A or STT3B) and accessory subunits 72 . Both isoforms are individually required for the replication of DENV, as knockout of either STT3A or STT3B resulted in complete abrogation of DENV replication. Other mosquito-borne flaviviruses, including ZIKV, are exclusively dependent on the STT3A isoform for viral RNA replication, which indicates a specific but divergent virus-host interaction (FIG. 2) . Surprisingly, the catalytic activity of STT3A and STT3B was dispensable for virus replication, because catalytically inactive mutant proteins were able to restore DENV replication in the knockout cells, which indicates that the OST complex has an unconventional role in DENV replication.

This protein quality control mechanism targets incorrectly folded proteins in the ER lumen for retrotranslocation through the ER membrane to the cytosol, in which proteasomal degradation occurs 74 . Two categories of ERAD components were found in the CRISPR-Cas screens: first, components of the classical ERAD machinery, including SEL1L, derlin 2 (DERL2) and ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 J1 (UBE2J1), which are part of the retrotranslocation complex 75 ; and second, components of the ER membrane complex (EMC), an evolutionarily conserved complex that has less-well-understood roles in ERAD 76 . Knockout of ERAD components led to substantial decreases in viral-RNA accumulation, particle formation and virus-induced cell death for DENV, ZIKV, Japanese encephalitis virus and WNV 61, 69, 70 . However, how ERAD functions promote flavivirus replication remains to be fully understood.",

This is most probably due to redundancy in entry routes, such that knockout of one virus receptor still leaves cells susceptible through a different route. Indeed, several receptors have been reported for DENV 77 . Nevertheless, CRISPR-Cas screens have contributed to our understanding of flavivirus biology, revealing a central role for several ER complexes in promoting flavivirus infection.",

            "text": "Another important pathogen that has been investigated using CRISPR-Cas screens is HCV, which causes chronic liver disease in ~160 million infected individuals worldwide 78 . Whereas mosquito-borne flaviviruses have a dependence on ER proteins, screening with HCV, which is a more distantly related member of the family Flaviviridae, revealed nonoverlapping hits, including entry receptors CD81, OCLN and CLDN1, the liver-specific microRNA miR-122 and several RNA-binding proteins and metabolic enzymes 61 (FIG. 2) . One of the most significant hits was ELAVL1, an RNA-binding protein that is involved in mRNA stabilization 79 . HCV RNA replication was markedly reduced in ELAVL1-knockout cells, whereas RNA replication for other RNA viruses (for example, DENV and polio-virus) was unaffected. The HCV screens also uncovered an unexpected link between intracellular FAD levels and HCV RNA replication. The enzymes riboflavin kinase (RFK) and FAD synthase (FLAD1), which are involved in the conversion of riboflavin (vitamin B 2 ) to FAD, were found to be crucial for the replication of HCV. Lumiflavin, an inhibitor of cellular uptake of riboflavin, potently inhibited viral RNA replication, which indicates that the modulation of intracellular FAD levels could be explored as an antiviral treatment. Hosttargeted antiviral therapeutics may become an effective strategy to control virus replication because they may present a higher genetic barrier for resistant mutants to evolve than virustargeting antivirals, and they have the potential to inhibit a broader range of viruses 65 . For example, cyclophilin A (CYPA) is a host factor that is required for HCV replication and also promotes HIV infection [80] [81] [82] . CYPA inhibitors have advanced to phase II/III clinical trials for the treatment of HCV infection, and their use is also being explored to treat other viral infections 83 .",

CD300LF knockout abolished murine norovirus infection in mouse cell lines and in a mouse model of murine norovirus infection. Moreover, the expression of mouse CD300LF in human cells made them susceptible to murine norovirus infection. The discovery of a key host receptor that is necessary and sufficient for the binding of murine norovirus raises the possibility that human noroviruses also require a specific proteinaceous receptor or receptors. The recent development of a more reliable in vitro infection model for human noroviruses 87 combined with CRISPR-Cas technology could lead to a better understanding of the entry pathway that is used by human noroviruses and to the development of entry inhibitors.",

This new approach is also being used to gain a better understanding of how viruses exploit their host and to develop new antiviral therapeutics. Since its discovery, CRISPR-Cas technology has already advanced our understanding of the life cycles of noroviruses and flaviviruses. Future screens will undoubtedly shed light on commonalities and differences in how viruses have evolved to exploit and subvert host functions, and may provide potential targets for antiviral therapy. Together with advances in the genetic engineering of animal models using CRISPR-Cas and improvements in field applications such as gene drive systems, these new CRISPR-Cas technologies will help us to tackle current and future viral epidemics.",

Moreover, CRISPR-Cas systems can be combined with other technologies to develop more sophisticated screening approaches. Combining CRISPR-Cas technology with advances in single-cell profiling could lead to better measurements of virus replication dynamics [136] [137] [138] [139] [140] . Furthermore, a screening strategy that investigates epistatic relationships (for example by combining haploid and CRISPR-Cas mutagenesis 60 ), will enable the systematic analysis of functional interdependencies between the host genes that are most crucial for virus infection. We expect that refining and expanding the genetic toolbox for manipulating host cells will lead to novel insights into the 'arms race' between viruses and their hosts.",
