Such subcellular structures hold the secrets to normal cellular function, progression of disease, and the universe of interactions among biomolecules that define life. Initially observed in unicellular organisms, these subcellular structures were termed organelles because of the parallel to the organ/body relationship in multicellular organisms. Currently, the term \"organelle\" loosely describes a confined subcellular environment of any cell in which specific functions occur. Thus, organelles comprise large protein complexes (e.g. signalosomes), large protein-RNA complexes (e.g. ribosomes), and membrane bound structures (e.g. mitochondria). The interest in subcellular organization continues to increase as new biological functions, unique molecular features, and therapeutic potential continue being discovered. This interest has fueled recent advances in the bioanalysis of organelles reviewed here.",

Clearly, bulk studies of cell lysates that contain organelle mixtures or when organelles are not clearly identified in imaging-based studies cannot provide the detailed information of subcellular processes. Thus, organelle analysis enables a more specific description of the molecular, biochemical, and physiological processes associated with diseases, embryonic development, tissue differentiation, organism aging, disease treatments, and organism response to pathogens. Subcellular analysis is also a valuable component in species or tissue comparisons, is instrumental in the development of many novel tools and assays, and its use is leading to many advances in biotechnology.",

            "text": "The history of subcellular analysis ( Figure 1 ) began with the discovery of the nucleus in cod and salmon red blood cells by microscopist Antonie Van Leeuwenhoek in 1682. 92 Franz Bauer rediscovered the nucleus in the 1800s. The meaning and significance of the organelle that Van Leeuwenhoek and Bauer discovered were not purposefully investigated for over 150 years from van Leeuwenhoek's original work. In 1833, botanist Robert Brown in orchid cells again identified the nucleus. He identified and coined the term nucleus and his work led to additional studies observing the nucleus in multiple cell types and determining its function in cell division. 94 Another organelle discovered in the 1800s was the mitochondrion. Mitochondria were first discovered using microscopy in the 1850s by Rudolph Albert von Kolliker and were not described again until the 1890s when Richard Altman published his discovery of the \"bioblast\" (mitochondria) in his book Die Elementarorganism. Carl Benda coined the term mitochondria in 1898. The function of mitochondria would not be proposed until the 1910s when Kingbury suggested that mitochondria participated in cell respiration. 95 In addition to the nucleus and m itochondria, other organelles were first discovered with microscopy. The Golgi apparatus was discovered in the 1890s by Camillo Golgi w hen he described an \"internal reticular apparatus\". 96 Andreas Schimper named chloroplasts following their observation in the 1890s. 97 Transmission electron microscopy was first used to observe the subcellular structure of cells in the 1940s and its use led to the discovery of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by Albert Claude in that same period. 98 Peroxisomes were first observed by Johannes Rhodin in the 1950s, also using transmission electron microscopy. 94 In addition to organelle discovery, the first reports describing organelleorganelle interactions were also based on transmission electron microscopy. The first report of that phenomenon we could locate occurred in the late 1960s when Sue Ellen Frederick and Eldon H. Newcomb used transmission electron microscopy to observe interactions between storage vacuoles and mitochondria or chloroplasts. 99 A new era of subcellular discoveries began with the use of cellular fractionation by centrifugation. Differential centrifugation was developed by Albert Claude in the 1940s to determine the distribution of enzymes within the cell. The Claude lab separated rat and guinea p ig liver fractions into a \"large granule fraction\" containing mitochondria, a \"microsome\" fraction containing particulates, and the \"supernate\" which contained particulates that could not be centrifuged. 100 Differential centrifugation was extended by Claude, George Hogeboom, Walter Schneider, and George Palade who used the technique to enrich mitochondria-containing fractions. 101 Christian de Duve first discovered lysosomes in 1955. He observed that in rat liver cell fractions prepared by centrifugation, fractions contained overlapping activities of multiple enzymes including acid phosphatase. Acid phosphatase activity was found to be the most abundant in the mitochondria and homogenate fractions. After refrigerated storage of the fractions for further analysis, reanalysis of the fractions indicated acid phosphatase activity had increased, a surprising result since they were expected to decrease due to storage. These results suggested that the acid phosphatase enzymes were contained within a membranebound body that had likely deteriorated during storage. The body was concluded to be a new type of organelle, the lysosome. 102 By optimizing his centrifugation strategy, de Duve also isolated the lysosome fraction. Alex Novikoff obtained the first e lectron m icrographs of lysosome-enriched fractions shortly thereafter with acid phosphatase used as a marker. De Duve later discovered peroxisomes using a combination of enzymatic analysis of uricase activity and centrifugation fractionation performed in a manner similar to that employed for the study of lysosomes. 103 A closely related organelle to the lysosome, the endosome, was first observed in the 1970s by Ralph M. Steinman using transmission electron microscopy. 104 The role and function of endosomes were first proposed by Ari Helenius, Ira Mellman, Doris Wall, and Ann Hubbard. 105 To use microscopy to visualize organelles, organelle-specific stains and probes had to first be developed and optimized. This technique originated with the use of haematoxylin to observe nuclei in the 1860s by Franz Bohmer. 106 A few decades later, in the 1900s, Leonor Michaelis used the stain Janus Green B to observe mitochondria in living cells. 107 In the 1930s, W.H. Lewis observed Neutral Red-stained vacuoles present in cultured cells from the chicken heart and embryo. 108 Reports on the subcellular localization of synthetic dyes observed by fluorescence microscopy appeared in the 1960s. In that decade, Boris Rotman and Ben W. Papermaster studied the subcellular distribution of fluorescein, 109 Elliott Robbins and Phillip Marcus observed the intracellular accumulation of acridine orange, 110 and Guido Marinetti investigated that of rhodamine B. 111 The simultaneous analysis of organelles, beginning in 1915, has proved to be a powerful tool for observing interacting organelles, minimizing experiment duration, and for tracking organelle functions in response to specific conditions, such as osmotic stress. 112 The introduction of transmission electron microscopy allowed for visualization of organelles. The first image of organelles was captured in 1945 by Keith Porter, Albert Claude, and Ernest Fullam from chicken embryo cells. 98 This image also contained the first simultaneous detection of many organelle types such as the nucleus with Golgi and the nucleus with mitochondria. Many organelles were subsequently observed with transmission electron microscopy including the endoplasmic reticulum, 113 Golgi, 114 and lysosomes. 115 The cristae structure of mitochondria was also first observed using transmission electron microscopy. 116 The use of organelle-specific dyes to enhance visualization by microscopy was first discussed by D. Wittekind 117 who described in his review the simultaneous detection of the Golgi, nuclei and acidic vacuoles using acridine orange for the first two and basic dyes for the latter. Simultaneous organelle detection using fluorescence detection could not be performed prior to technical advances made by Michael R. Loken, David R. Parks, and Leonard A. Herzenberg, who demonstrated the use of a single excitation wavelength to visualize two fluorophores in instrumentation unrelated to microscopy. 118 The first simultaneous colocalization of proteins was demonstrated in baby hamster kidney cells with immunofluorescence by the Goldman lab in 1985. 119 It was n ot until 1 993 that the first simultaneous fluorescent organelle detection appeared. 120 Hyman M. Schipper, Soriba Cisse, and Paul A. Walton investigated the colocalization of peroxisomes with the Golgi, ER, and lysosomes using immunofluorescence and f luorescent dyes in a strocytes.",

            "text": "The next critical advance in organelle visualization was the development and use of fluorescent proteins. In 1962, green fluorescent protein (GFP) was first isolated and characterized from the A. victoria jellyfish by Osamu Shimomura. 121 Cloning and insertion of the GFP gene into an organism occurred three decades later by Martin Chalfie and Roger Tsien. 122 Use of GFP as a marker became attractive because its gene encoded all information necessary to express the protein in an organism and to generate a fusion protein that included GFP as the fluorescent moiety. Modern recombinant DNA technologies allowed researchers to select a given protein, link its gene to that encoding green fluorescent protein, and express the resulting fusion protein. When appended to a protein specific to an organelle, GFP could be used to track specific organelles. GFP was first used to tag nuclei in mammalian cells by creating fusion proteins of two different nuclear glucocorticoid receptors in the 1980s. 123 GFP-tagged organelles appeared in plants in the 1990s, first in the chloroplasts, 124 then in the ER, 125 and the nucleus. 124 Since then, fluorescent protein research and development has focused on the creation of proteins with distinct excitation and emission maxima, optimized FRET pairs, and environmental sensitivity to pH and redox potential (see 3.2.) . Several reviews have been published on the subject of GFPs and their applications alone. [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] A new perspective on subcellular analysis began with the introduction of proteomics. In addition to assessing organelle function through visualization techniques such as microscopy, the ability to define an organelle's contents (e.g. proteins) could be helpful for probing function and physiological effects. The first application of proteomics was accomplished via gel electrophoresis. Patricia O'Farrell, Howard Goodman, and Patrick O'Farrell in 1977 used electrophoresis to analyze a wide range of proteins. 126 An issue of Electrophoresis in 1997 reported the first 2D gel electrophoretic s eparations of proteins specific to enriched organelle fractions. 127 These papers described the analysis of enriched fractions of endosomes, 128 Golgi, 129 late endosomes, e arly endosomes, E R-derived material, 130 plasma membrane, 131 and phagosomes. 132 In addition, bands were excised f or HPLC identification of enriched Golgi p roteins 133 and for nanoelectrospray tandem mass spectrometry identification of enriched phagosome proteins. 132 The importance of mass spectrometry-based (MS-based) proteomics in subcellular profiling and quantification in the analysis of complex samples was realized soon after the development of electrospray ionization (ESI) 134 and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ ionization (MALDI) 135 to volatilize and ionize large biomolecules. In 1997, the Yates lab analyzed soluble proteins in the periplasmic space of E. Coli. 136 Following concentration and collection of the proteins, SDS-PAGE fractionation identified 159 bands and electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry identified 80 proteins. In 2000, the Klaas J. van Wijk lab reported the use of MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and ESI-tandem mass spectrometry to analyze the proteome of the chloroplast. 137 Proteins in enriched organelle fractions were separated by 2D gel electrophoresis (isoelectric focusing followed by SDS-PAGE), select protein spots were digested, and analyzed by peptide mass fingerprinting. Of the 400 spots analyzed with MALDI-TOF MS, 20 were also analyzed with ESI-MS/MS and 55 were analyzed via N-terminal Edman degradation-based sequencing. A total of 61 proteins were identified and 58 of those were classified by function (e.g. growth, transcription, etc.). In 2001, the Ferdinand Hucho lab reported the nuclear envelope proteome analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. 138 Shortly after, Taylor et al. extensively characterized the human heart mitochondrial proteome utilizing metrizamide and sucrose gradients for purification prior to MALDI-mass spectrometry analysis. 139 The concepts of metabolomics and lipidomics were coined in 1998 and 2003, respectively, in response to the appearance of large data sets of either metabolites or lipids defining changes associated with a given genotype or phenotype. 57, 140 However, investigation of the metabolomic composition of organelles was actually performed prior to the emergence of the \"metabolomics\" terminology. R.R. Bensley and N.L. Hoerr investigated the total composition of \"fatty substances\" in enriched mitochondria fraction from guinea pig and rabbit liver mitochondria in 1934. 141 The authors found 43.6% of fatty substances, primarily glycerides, i n the enriched m itochondria and investigated the presence of lecithin and cephalin. C laude in vestigated the phospholipid composition of subcellular f ractions of rat lymphoid cells in 1944 and found the phospholipid composition of lipids from mitochondria to be 75-80% using elemental analysis. 142 In 1956, George Palade and Phillip Siekevitz studied the composition of microsomes and described their RNA and phospholipid phosphorous contents. 143 In the 1964, the George Rouser laboratory analyzed multiple lipids from bovine heart mitochondria using column chromatography coupled with thin layered chromatography. 144 In 1970, Grunwald determined the composition of sterols (such as glycosides, esters, cholesterol and campesterol) in organelle fractions from tobacco leaves using gas chromatography. 145 Excellent reviews were written by Fleischer and Rouser who focused on lipidomics studies from the 1960s 146 and W.C. McMurray on metabolomic and lipidomics studies from the late 1960s and early 1970s. 147 The first reports of mass spectrometry being used for subcellular lipidomics appeared in 1984 and 1985 by Richard W. Gross who analyzed mitochondria and plasma membrane lipids from canine cardiac cells with HPLC separation and gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry. 148 Samples were enriched and analyzed with xenon fast atom bombardment. In the early 1990s, mass spectrometric methods utilizing ESI were introduced for the study of lipids. The Lowell Ericsson lab demonstrated that positive and negative electrospray ionization could be used with tandem mass spectrometry to analyze glycerophospholipids and ceramides. 149 These studies showed ESI could be used for biological lipids. This was followed shortly thereafter, if not concurrently, by Xianlin Han and Richard Gross who studied the plasma membrane phospholipids of human erythrocyte cells using ESI mass spectrometry with a triple quadrupole instrument. 150 The development of subcellular organelle analysis techniques has continued in the late 1990s and 2000s with a focus on the study of individual organelles and b iological heterogeneity. In 1998, the Richard Zare laboratory examined single dense core vesicles from the gastropod mollusk A. californica. 151 Using optical trapping, individual organelles were introduced into a capillary where they were labeled and separated using capillary electrophoresis. While taurine was identified as a major component of the organelles, the organelles manifested a high level of heterogeneity. Single organelle analysis was continued by Jonathan Sweedler and coworkers who, in 2000, analyzed the same sample but with MALDI-TOF-mass spectrometry in order to identify bioactive peptides. 152 The Edgar Arriaga group developed single organelle detection techniques to separate and study tens to thousands of organelles. 153 The first of those papers was published in 2001 which featured the detection of mitochondria with capillary electrophoresis coupled to laser induced fluorescence detection (CE-LIF). 153a Since then, that technique has been applied to monitor organelle properties such as pH of acidic organelles, 154 xenobiotic content, 155 and accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in mitochondria. 156 The literature reviewed in the following sections focuses on labeling and imaging of organelles (3.) , the \"omics\" of organelles (4.) , the interactions of organelles (5.) , the physiological effects of organelles (6.) , and organelle heterogeneity (7.) . The vast majority of the work described below builds upon the key discoveries outlined in this section. Needless to say, these discoveries will continue gaining historical importance and relevance as the interest in organelle analysis expands, new roles of organelles in biological function are elucidated and the classification of organelle into types and subpopulations continues to evolve.",

Because increased DPP1 expression has been associated with pulmonary disease, inhibitors for DPP1 are attractive therapeutic agents. A new assay that can be used for identification of lysosomes in fractions via DPP1 and to investigate the potential inhibitors of normal lysosomal DPP1 activity was recently reported. 169 This assay is based on the ability of DPP1 to cleave either amino-methyl-coumarin or amino-fluorocoumarin dipeptide conjugates. Upon cleavage, these fluorophores are no longer quenched and their fluorescence increases. The optimal conditions for the assay (100\u00b5M per 30,000 cells with a 1h treatment time) were determined in the human acute monocytic leukemia cells, which have high DPP1 activity. As expected, the assay did not show an increase in f luorescence w hen analyzing DPP1 knockdown mouse bone marrow cells. The assay was also suitable for the identification of DPP1 inhibitors.",

The new assay does not require any extraction procedure because the new substrate, chlorophyll para-nitrophenyl ester is not colored, making it possible to monitor directly the enzymatic activity through the formation of the yellow-colored product paranitrophenoxide in the reaction mixture. The results of the new assay were equivalent to those obtained with the extraction-based enzyme assay and had similar responses to changes in pH and the presence of metal ions such as Mg+2 and Fe+2.

Quantum dots are excellent means of visualization because they have narrower fluorescence excitation and emission profiles allowing for less spectral cross-talk and low photobleaching. 176 In the past, their use as intracellular delivery markers has been limited. Because of their size, which is often less than 50 nm in diameter, their limited surface area does not leave sufficient room for their derivatization with either cell penetrating tags or intracellular target tags. A new method to overcome this limitation has been developed. Quantum dots were conjugated to antibodies and encapsulated within a biodegradable polymer delivery vehicle. 177 The encapsulating polymers can be engineered with cell-or organelle-penetrating moieties that cannot be directly connected to the quantum dots. In this study, the polymers were targeted to the late endosome and made use of the acidic nature of this compartment. Here, the cell-penetrating tags were protonated, rendering them uncharged and unable to exit the vacuoles. After protonation, the quantum dots accumulated at the periphery of the acidic vesicle, destabilized the membrane, and broke free inside the cell. This delivered its contents to the subcellular space of the human glioblastoma cell line used in these experiments. From there, the antibody-quantum dot conjugates could proceed to their targeted subcellular location. The pH sensitivity of the polymer capsule could be tuned to control the release of the QD-antibody conjugates, and the biodegradable poly(D,L-lactide-co-glycolide) polymers did not interfere with subcellular labeling.",

Therefore, any advances that can make more efficient use of small quantities of antibodies are essential. Related to this, a microarray capable of transferring 360 primary antibodies to permeabilized cells was used to monitor in parallel the presence of antibody targets (proteins) in the nucleus of nine different human breast cancer cell lines. 179 Each spot in the microarray possessed a unique antibody. Nine different permeabilized breast cancer cell lines were compared. When brought into contact with the cells, the primary antibodies dissociated from their microarray membranes and tagged a corresponding patch of cells. This resulted in a grid-like series of labeled spots o n the layer of cells. Each antibody bound to its antigen was visualized with a fluorescent secondary antibody. In addition, each cell was abeled with 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, (DAPI), which defined the nuclear region. Because the positions of each antibody spot on the original antibody delivery membrane was known and correspond to a cell patch, overlap of immunofluorescence and the DAPI stain was used to identify protein targets localized to the nucleus. In this study, only one protein, Cyclin B1, showed different subcellular localization in different cell lines (nuclear-localized, non-nuclear-localized, and both). While this strategy was employed to examine breast cancer cell lines, this method should be applicable to any cell line as well as any organelles for which there exist known fluorescent markers. The ability to use a single sample of cells and just 50ng of each antibody per microarray is an advantage over other techniques.",

Expression of this concatenated gene results in expression of protein constructs that are fluorescent and that typically retain the subcellular localization properties of the original protein. Because most of the subcellular localization signals are found at the N-terminus, the original protein and the fluorescent protein genes are fused so that the fluorescent protein moiety is located at the C-terminus of the original protein. These genes are delivered encoded in plasmids or viral vectors into the cells under study. Fluorescent proteins can be expressed in cell culture as fusion proteins that target specific organelles. Organelles containing such fluorescent proteins are distinguished as discrete, fluorescent punctuates. These punctuates can be detected to study properties of organelles using techniques such as fluorescence confocal microscopy. Because GFP and GFP-related fusion proteins are relatively stable, and because recently developed proteins have minimal cytotoxicity, observation of fluorescent proteins has provided tremendous insight into the dynamics of subcellular regions that cannot be easily obtained with antibodies or other synthetic probes. There are potential problems with this technique, however, that do not exist when using other fluorescent techniques.

However, monitoring Ca +2 in the various regions of the Golgi has been a major challenge to date. A new genetically encoded FRET-based Ca +2 probe that is more specific for the trans-Golgi than other Golgi regions, Go-D1cpv, has been developed. 190 The probe was designed to have two GFP variants, CFP and YFP, joined through a linker to a calmodulin-binding domain. It was then expressed as a fusion protein in human cervical cancer cells bound to a known trans-Golgi protein sialyl-transferase I. Ca +2 concentrations were monitored by the analysis of the ratio of CFP/YRP fluorescence. While expressing this probe, researchers used a combination of RNAi and gene knockout animals to investigate four important calcium-related channels and receptors known to be unique to the Golgi: sarco-endoplasmic reticulum Ca +2 ATPase (SERCA) and secretory pathway Ca +2 ATPase1 (SPCA1) channels, ryanodine receptors (RyRs), and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors. Using this probe, it was determined that the trans-Golgi relies entirely on SPCA1 channels for Ca +2 uptake and it showed no evidence of the involvement of inositol 1,4,5trisphosphate receptors. However, RyRs receptors were observed instead of the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors in cardiac myocytes. The use of this probe in future studies may provide detailed information about the calcium traffic through the Golgi in various disease states.",

Thus, mRFP-GFP-LC3 allowed for a more efficient screening of vesicle fusion of mouse embryonic fibroblast and human cervical cancer cells during autophagosome maturation than earlier visualization techniques such as transmission electron microscopy.

            "text": "Uses of redox sensitive green-fluorescent proteins (roGFPs) have recently exploded as a source of information on the redox status of various intracellular compartments by their conjugation with proteins of known subcellular localization. These proteins were first developed in 2004. 192 Since then, their application as intracellular compartment redox indicators had been widely applied to many facets of intracellular investigation. A defining characteristic of roGFPs is the inclusion of two cysteine residues on the exposed surface of the expressed protein that modulated the fluorescence of the protein based on whether or not a disfulfide bridge has formed between them. A significant application for these roGFPs was developed by coupling known roGFPs to glutaredoxin, a glutathione redox state sensor, and peroxidase 1, an intracellular peroxide sensor, both known to be expressed exclusively in the mitochondria. 193 Previous intraorganelle redox studies relied on indirect evidence to quantify redox species and effects. Many relied on disruptive methods to collect measurements that could alter the end result of an experiment. The roGFPs developed in this report provided a solution by not requiring invasive methods for detection and offering a direct readout of the redox state within the organelle. This was due to their conjugation to the very enzymes, in this case glutaredoxin, which process the redox species in question. Coupling of the roGFPs in this manner allowed for a more specific quantification of the redox effector by giving instantaneous measurements on the redox state of the mitochondrial compartment as the conjugated enzymes broke down the redox effector in question. Initial studies were conducted in human cervical cancer cells, but the approach was used successfully to examine differing redox potentials at subcellular resolutions across D. melanogaster. This probe allowed simultaneous monitoring of the cytosol and the mitochondria in various tissues over time and under varying conditions, including age and drug treatment.",

For the purpose of this study, luciferase was split into two domains, the Cterminus and the N-terminus. Each half of the complete protein was engineered to contain half of a split intein sequence. This strategy is depicted in Figure 5 . 194 One of the domains was expressed in the cytosol (C-Rluc) and the other (N-Rluc) was fused to the N-terminus of Smac/DIABLO, a mitochondrial protein. The fusion protein did not affect Smac/DIABLO subcellular localization to the mitochondria in human breast cancer cells. Upon treatment with staurosporine to induce apoptosis, the intein-N-Rluc-Smac/DIABLO construct was released from the mitochondria, which resulted in association with the C-Rluc-intein construct present in the cytosol. The association of the two halves of the split intein pieces resulted in the assembly of an intact functional intein that in turn caused excision of the intein and ligation of the two Rluc fragments to produce catalytically activated luciferase. The subsequent conversion of coelenterazine to coelenteramide produced light that can be easily and quickly measured with a photodetector in which the intensity is indicative of the amount of Smac/Diablo protein released from mitochondria.",

Figure 8 shows the schematic involved in FPALM. When individually visualized molecules are separated by a distance that exceeds the Abbe diffraction limit (~250 nm), their positions can be determined after deconvoluting their point spread functions with nanometer resolution (~ 20 nm). 215 This process of localization is repeated many times with different subsets of molecules in stochastic manner to create a super-resolution image. The dramatic improvement in the resolution obtained with FPALM over TIRF microscopy c an be s een in Figure 9 . 199 The fluorophores used vary according to the techniques. PALM and FPALM typically use genetically encoded, photoactive fluorescence proteins. 216 STORM utilizes pairs of photoswitchable organic fluorophores, which are usually bound to antibodies to a specific target of interest. 217 Since the super-resolution techniques permit observations of suborganellar details, they have been extensively used for studying organelle morphology, e.g. mitochondria. 197b, 206, 212 Heterogeneity in mitochondria cristae morphology was visualized w ith STED microscopy. 207 The focal volume was decreased by 3 orders of magnitude when compared to confocal microscopy. This decrease was sufficient to image details of the distribution of F1F0ATPase in the mitochondrial inner membrane. The same approach was used to resolve and observe 28-nm cytochrome c clusters and VDAC 1 clusters ranging from 33 to 88 nm in size in isolated c ardiac mitochondria. 205 A similar approach was used to investigate distributions of mtDNA nucleoids. 218 Using STED microscopy, 60% more nucleoids per cell were detected compared to the confocal microscopy, suggesting that the nucleoid contained on average ~1.4 mtDNA copies. These findings confirm previous theories that many nucleoids must contain only a single mtDNA copy. 218 On the contrary, larger variation in nucleoids size and shape, high packing density, close association with inner membrane, and wrapping around cristae was found by PALM imaging in 3T3 Switch mouse fibroblasts. 209 Super-resolution techniques were used for imaging dynamic processes in living cells including real-time tracking and localization (TALM) of single TOM20 and ATP synthase complexes in mitochondria 210 and ER-network dynamics using STED microscopy. 203 Most organelles have a dynamic, three-dimensional (3D) organization inside the cell, which is tightly connected to their physiological functions. Due to this, a single 2D image inherently limits the information acquired about the distribution of a particular property within the organelle. The concept of super-resolution imaging has been extended to 3D observations achieving 50-150 nm z-axis resolution. 3D STORM was used to observe mitochondrial network in green monkey epithelial cells, 197b microtubule network, 219 clathrin-coated pits in live cells 220 and mapping neural connectivity in brain. 221 Interferometric PALM was applied to visualize 3D opography of both orsal and ventral plasma membranes with the same precision as atomic force microscopy and other endomembrane systems such as integrin receptors within ER. 204 A temporal focusing PALM, which utilizes two-photon activation and one-photon excitation approach, was used to produce 3D images of mitochondrial network with 50 nm lateral resolution over an zrange up to 10 \u00b5m. 211",

ET uses a similar principle as other tomographic imaging methods commonly used in medical imaging, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or X-ray computed axial tomography (CAT). 224 In ET, multiple 2D projections of the same specimen are collected from different angles during a constant tilting of the sample around the axis, which is perpendicular to the imaged plane. The acquired projections are then computationally reconstructed to produce 3D tomograms of the sample with the Z-axis resolution up to 5-10 nm. 225 This results in a more than a 30 -60 fold improvement in the resolution compared to the traditional serial thin sectioning and more than 500 fold improvement than that of confocal fluorescence microscopy. 223 ET was used for the first time to study the mitochondria ultrastructure and organization in the calyx of Held, which is the largest nerve terminal in the central nervous system. 226 The ET observations revealed new features of mitochondrial cristae in the calyx-cytoskeletal anchoring suggesting new aspects of nerve terminal organization. This is shown in Figure  10 . 226 A 3D topological complexity of membrane systems in mouse myocardium was investigated using ET providing new insights in the linkage b etween mitochondrial outer membranes, sarcoplasmic reticulum and their role in controlling cardiac calcium dynamics. 227 Focused ion beam/scanning electron microscopy (FIB/SEM), sometimes called dual beam or ion abrasion electron microscopy, is another approach for providing 3D structural details of cells and tissue. 228 This technique integrates a scanning electron beam and a second, focused ion beam (FIB) in the same microscope. The ion beam, typically using accelerated, ion scan, performs site-specific removal (or milling) of thin layers of resin-embedded or cryo-prepared samples. By serial imaging of the abraded surfaces with SEM, one can produce a 3D map of the particular region of the sample. The subcellular architecture of membrane bound organelles in melanoma cells was imaged using FIB/SEM. 229 The quantitative 3D imaging indicated that mitochondria occupied about 5% of the volume in human melanoma cells with a mean width of individual mitochondrion equal to 450 nm. The images showed tethers between mitochondria and ER.",

One recent study utilizing mass spectrometers with differing scan rates compared affinity purified samples with bait proteins known to be from different subcellular components (cytosol, cytoplasm, mitochondrion, and nucleus) to study the benefit of a multidimensional s eparation of these affinity purified samples coupled to liquidchromatography (LC)-MS/MS. 258 It was found that although t his multidimensional approach d id result in an in crease in spectral counts with the LTQ-Orbitrap XL (Thermo Scientific) (very important when spectral counting is used for quantitation), the slight increase in protein identifications did not outweigh practical considerations such as the drawback of increased sample preparation and mass spectrometer time. The authors also compared these results with 1-D and various 2-D results obtained from an even older generation mass spectrometer, the LTQ (Thermo Scientific). Acquisition of 1 highresolution MS scan followed by 3 data-dependent MS/MS scans of the most abundant ions with a mass accuracy of <2 ppm was used for the LTQ-Orbitrap. The TripleTOF 5600 (AB Sciex) was used with a faster scan rate of 20 data-dependent MS/MS scans per one MS (1.3 second duty cycle). The TripleTOF 5600 operates via information-dependent acquisition (IDA) with high resolution (>30,000) and high mass accuracy (<3 ppm), and the speed in which it can acquire MS/MS spectra allows for the development of a LC-MS/MS platform capable of identifying approximately twice the number of peptides and proteins over a currently optimized LC-MS/MS method (FTMS). 242 The high duty cycle of the TripleTOF allowed for the analysis of the affinity purified samples (without the multidimensional separation step) with similar benefits but without the drawbacks of increased sample preparation and MS time. More specifically, the authors found that the increased scan rate of new mass spectrometers allowed for similar results to be obtained as on older mass spectrometers (i.e. LTQ-Orbitrap XL) using a multidimensional separation. Therefore, in the case of these affinity-purified samples, a faster scan rate allows for more identification in the absence of a multidimensional separation used w ith more complex samples.",

For example, iLoc-Euk can predict single or multiple subcellular locations of eukaryotic proteins. 263 It would be in error to ssign a single organelle location to these proteins.

Cross-contamination between organelle fractions can lead to incorrect protein localization assignments and therefore, mistaken biological conclusions or hypotheses. 267 In addition, it is vital to see protein translocations in response to treatments/stressors or in signaling pathways. Biological insight can be acquired by quantitative determination of protein translocation and abundance changes in many organelles and membrane fractions simultaneously. 268 Complex, tissue-specific differential centrifugation methods (size-based) have been extensively developed to obtain pure organelle fractions (based on Western blot confirmation) for MS-based analyses. 269 Developments in density gradient centrifugation have also improved organelle purity for MS analysis, which can separate organelles based on differing densities. 270 Use of fluorescence-assisted organelle sorting (FAOS) to enrich dense-core secretory granules has recently been reported. 271 Frit-inlet asymmetrical flow field-flow fractionation (FI-AFlFFF) has also been used to size-fractionate and purify a specific type of organelle (i.e. mitochondria) from rat liver for MS/MS analysis. 272 This differs from traditional flow field-flow fractionation in that sample elaxation (equilibrium conditions before the sample components are separated) is achieved hydrodynamically via the frit inlet so that there is no momentary stop of the migration flow. More specifically, the sample is able to quickly reach equilibrium via compression of the frit inlet flow so that there is no stop in the migration flow of the sample while it reaches equilibrium. Stopping the sample flow, as is the case FlFFF applications, can be problematic as the sample can become stuck. There have also been studies using free flow electrophoresis (FFE) for subcellular fractionation and isolation, which eliminates the need for tedious and timeconsuming centrifugation steps. 273 These reports even demonstrate that subpopulations within heterogeneous populations of organelles may be resolved. More specifically, Islinger et al. used free flow-isotachophoresis (FF-ITP) followed by z onal FFE to pre-enrich mitochondria at the anodic side of the instrument and subsequently enrich the s ynaptosome fraction from brain tissue. 273b This is an improvement over isotachophoresis ( ITP), which is a focusing t echnique that separates organelles according to their different electrophoretic mobilities, but results in high mitochondria cross-contamination in the synaptosome fraction.",

In addition, they were able to identify proteins associated with other organelles in the same fraction that were previously assigned to the lysosome using a quadratic discriminant analysis. 275 More specifically, if levels of a given protein change in parallel with the organelle marker(s) (e.g. Lamp2 is a marker for lysosomes), it strongly suggests that the protein is localized with that particular o rganelle. Therefore, proteins that are density-shifted with the lysosomal organelle markers can be assigned lysosomal residence.",

Recent reports on the use of quantitative proteomics for subcellular analysis used mainly iTRAQ labeling. In the iTRAQ and TMT approaches, the lysine residues or N-termini of proteins or peptides are labeled with amine reactive tags. These tags are isobaric, or of the same initial mass, but yield reporter ions of different masses when the tags are fragmented during tandem mass spectrometry analysis. The intensities of these reporter io ns, detected in the second stage of tandem mass spectrometry analysis, are used for quantitation. Chemical labeling approaches are often chosen when metabolic labeling is not feasible (e.g. in tissue) or if a large number of groups or parameters are to be analyzed (i.e. iTRAQ 4-plex can quantify up to 4 different groups of proteins and TMT 6-plex can quantify up to 6 different groups of proteins while SILAC can quantify, at most, 3 groups of proteins). The utility of multiplexing these labeling schemes (that is, labeling proteins both metabolically and chemically) is beginning to be exploited. Recently, SILAC labeling was combined with TMTs to provide up to 18 different conditions (3 SILAC X 6 TMTs) that could be simultaneously analyzed. 288 While this multiplexing study was done in yeast, this labeling scheme could be expanded for use in eukaryotic subcellular analysis.",

They also found a general increase in abundance of nucleolar proteins due to etoposide treatment, but few proteins had changes in expected subcellular localization. Among the proteins that translocated, most of them were categorized as \"proteolysis\" proteins and were being shuttled out of the cytoplasm and into the nucleus. This work also offers evidence that DNA damage may alter the properties of the minichromosome maintenance (MCM) complex, which concentrates in the nucleus in response to DNA damage. 297a Spatial proteomics methods were also applied to study the effects of DNA damage in p53 knockout HCT116 cells on the subcellular proteome. 297b Under normal growth conditions, p53 makes little contribution to subcellular lo calization of proteins. Few proteins relocalized in the p53 knockout cells in the absence of DNA damage. In the presence of DNA damage caused by etoposide treatment, shuttling of proteins between the cytosolic and nuclear components is similar between wild-type and knockout cells. However, p53 appears to halt nucleolar activity, causing proteins to stay put (i.e. ribosomal proteins) in wild-type cells. This effect was observed to a much lesser extent in the knockout cells, as the ribosomal proteins do not accumulate in the nucleolus in response to etoposide treatment. This may suggest that p53 is needed for the release of ribosomal proteins from the nucleolus following DNA damage.",

Area under the curve (AUC)/signal intensity measurement (chromatographic peaks) and spectral counting (number of peptides assigned to a protein) are the two main label-free approaches used. The former assumes that the AUC of the chromatographic peak of a peptide corresponds with its concentration in the sample. Spectral counting asserts that if a peptide is more abundant, it will be selected for fragmentation more often than less abundant peptides and result in more MS/MS spectra. 298 Label-free quantitation was the approach of choice in a proteomic study on the ER of murine liver. 299 There, the authors developed and demonstrated a 3D profiling strategy that combined SDS-PAGE with gas phase fractionation (GPF) just prior to MS/MS analysis. A spectral counting label-free approach was used for semi quantitation using cluster or cocluster analyses 300 with known proteins associated with various organelles (i.e. cytosol, smooth ER, rough ER). The authors were able to identify 4 cytosolic proteins that clustered with ER proteins with high probability. More specifically, they suggested that they identified N-myc interactor (Nmi) as a new candidate in the ER associated degradation (ERAD) pathway. Through the use of 2D liquid chromatography fractionation to create proteome maps of chemosensitive and chemoresistant cell lines, Skalnikova et al. were able to identify differentially expressed proteins. The authors found that Rho GDP-dissociation inhibitor 2 (Rho GDI2) and Y-box binding protein 1 (YB-1) increase and decrease, respectively, in resistant cells relative to sensitive cells. The Rho GDI2 increase observed in resistant cells may have an anti-apoptotic effect, and it may be a good marker for cancer resistance. In addition, the truncation of YB-1 may serve as a marker for multi-drug resistance. Moreover, this truncation is associated with nuclei in human cancer cells. The authors were also able to observe translocation of the protein Hop, an Hsp70/90 organizing protein, from the nuclei to the cytoplasm in chemosensitive cells using immunohistochemistry. This translocation may alter a cell's response to spreading cancer and drug resistance.",

            "text": "The rate of carbon flux during photosynthesis in barley leaf cytosol, chloroplasts, and mitochondria was studied with 14 CO 2 -incubated protoplasts at different incubation times. 324 Three enriched subcellular fractions were prepared with a combination of pressure and filtration. The three fractions consisted of: (1) mitochondria, chloroplasts, cytosol; (2) mitochondria, cytosol; and (3) cytosol markers. Compounds of interest were separated with two-dimensional paper chromatography, extracted, and detected with liquid scintillation counting. The differences in radioactivity between fractions were quantified. The cytosolic fraction contained the largest pool of photosynthetic metabolites. A small, constant amount of the metabolites was found in chloroplasts-enriched (fraction 1) and to a lesser extent in the mitochondrial-enriched (fraction 2) fraction. Examples of the photosynthetic metabolites identified were 3-phosphoglyceric acid, triose phosphate, hexose monophosphate, fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, and ribulose 1,6-bisphosphate. Table 9 describes the localization of all a ccumulated carbon compounds. 324 Changes in the colocalization of invertases in potato tubers led to changes in carbohydrate subcellular localization. 328 Invertases are enzymes responsible for the h ydrolytic degradation of sucrose. By changing the subcellular localization of invertases, their role in carbohydrate subcellular compartmentalization can be studied. The subcellular location of invertases changed when the peptide targeting sequence was changed. Plastid, cytosol, and vacuole fractions were isolated via non-aqueous fractionation (NAQF). Gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry was used to determine subcellular concentrations of 50 confirmed metabolites. Isomaltose and sucrose accumulated in vacuoles and trehalose, maltose, and malitol (a sugar alcohol) were found primarily in the cytosol. Cell lines with modified subcellular distributions of invertases had decreased levels of cytosolic glucose, fructose, and sucrose in the enriched plastid, cytosol, and vacuole subcellular fractions. While carbohydrate subcellular localization was affected by invertases, carbohydrate metabolites (glucose-6-phosphate, fructose-6-phoshphate, and 3-phospho-glycerate) were only slightly increased in concentration in the cytosol. Increases in amino acids in both invertase-modified cells lines were observed, which may represent a regulatory system to maintain amino acid biosynthesis. NAD + has distinct roles in different subcellular compartments. Monitoring the activity of poly-ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP), which uses NAD + as a substrate, allows for the first visualization of free NAD + . 304 PARP was used as an organelle-specific fusion protein for NAD + visualization. Hence, PARP was fused to glutamate dehydrogenase specific for mitochondria NAD + visualization. When free NAD + was available, NAD + was polymerized onto PARP. The polymerized NAD + could then be immunodetected. Figure 15 shows a schematic description of NAD + visualization. 304 Free NAD + was found in mitochondria, peroxisomes, ER, and the Golgi of HeLa cells. Because many processes such as poly-ADPribose protein degradation use NAD + as signaling molecule, the indirect detection of NAD + has significant potential for future investigations of subcellular signaling.",

Enzymatic assays were used to quantitate carbohydrates using sorbitol as an internal standard.

The determination of carbohydrate content in the apoplasts required the infiltration method, a technique optimized for the enrichment of apoplastic fluids. While in a HEPES buffer, pedals were set onto an upper filter in a disposable tube and centrifugated. Soluble apoplastic carbohydrates were released from the pedals into the solution.

A recent study evaluated relationships between ROS and free fatty acid levels in a hypoxic cell m odel. 334 Superoxide levels in mitochondria were estimated using MitoSox Red in whole cells by confocal fluorescence microscopy and in enriched mitochondrial fractions using a fluorescence plate reader. Hydrogen peroxide levels were estimated in enriched mitochondrial fractions using the Amplex red/horseradish peroxidase assay in a plate reader. Hypoxia did not cause any changes in mitochondrial ROS production. This result was different from that observed in whole cell homogenate, where there was an increase in ROS. This suggested that hypoxia affects other parts of the cell more so than it does mitochondria. Surprisingly, treatment with free fatty acids caused increased hydrogen peroxide release from the mitochondrial fraction. Furthermore, mitochondria treated with free fatty acids under hypoxic conditions resulted in higher release of hydrogen peroxide and superoxide compared to similar treatment under normoxic (normal oxygen levels) conditions. Although the findings should be interpreted with caution because of the methodology used to evaluate superoxide levels, this study suggests free fatty acids play a role in elevating mitochondria ROS in concert with hypoxia. ROS levels increase in response to pathogenic invasion in some plants. After infection of P. sativum peas leaves with Plum Plox virus, the levels of hydrogen peroxide, superoxide, lipid peroxidation and protein oxidation were determined in enriched chloroplasts. 335 Chloroplasts displayed increased levels of hydrogen p eroxide in the initiation phase of the p athogen infection. During the disease development phase, there was an additional increase in superoxide, lipid peroxidation, and protein oxidation. These metabolite changes were accompanied with changes in the levels of antioxidant enzyme levels. Oxidative pentose phosphate pathway and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activities were both increased in chloroplasts suggesting increased carbohydrate metabolism and ribonucleotide synthesis. Photosynthesis-associated peptides, such as the oxygen evolution enhancer protein/complex, were decreased in chloroplasts. These results suggest Plum Plox viral infection directly causes an oxidative stress response in cells and chloroplasts.",

The presence of doxorubicin in an organelle was investigated by monitoring the native fluorescence of doxorubicin in a different spectral range. CE-LIF analysis could not specifically identify mitochondria but indicated that 9.3% of organelles contained doxorubicin, 66.6% had 2'7'-dichlorofluorescein, and only 2% of organelles included both.

Micellar electrokinetic chromatography, a form of capillary electrophoresis, was used to assess the relative levels of superoxide released into the mitochondrial matrix or outside the mitochondrial inner membrane. 156 Enriched mitochondrial fractions from human osteosarcoma cells, BALB/c mouse liver tissue, and Fischer 344 rat skeletal muscle were treated with the probe MitoSox Red. After treatment, an organelle-enriched fraction was separated into a pellet and a supernatant by differential centrifugation. The pellet contained the MitoSox Red products formed within mitochondria. The supernatant contained the MitoSox Red products released outside the inner membrane. The pellet and supernatant were analyzed separately by micellar electrokinetic chromatography with laser-induced fluorescence detection to clearly distinguish the superoxide-specific product triphenylphosphonium hydroxyethidium from the non-specific triphenylphosphonium ethidium. An application of this method consisted of evaluating the direction of superoxide release caused by various electron transport chain inhibitors including rotenone, antimycin A, and menadione. Figure 18 shows how these inhibitors affected superoxide accumulation outside and inside the mitochondria. 156 A subsequent report used this method to demonstrate that mitochondrial superoxide released outside mitochondria increases with inactivity in rat fast-twitch skeletal muscle. 339 4.2.3. Subcellular metabolic modeling-Some metabolic models have begun utilizing subcellular organization and dynamics to predict metabolic pathways. Recently, a model of human heart mitochondria, based on the proteomics database Mitominer, was developed to improve knowledge of mitochondria metabolic dysfunction. 340 Previous mitochondria models were restricted by the limited amount of information on the mitochondrial proteome and biochemical pathways. Mitominer allowed for integration of an increased number of metabolic reactions and additional proteomic information. The new model accounts for the most recent stoichiometric information available for ROS production, maximum ATP production, citric acid cycle flux, and glycolysis. As an application, the new model was used to investigate disorders associated with deficiencies in fumarase, succinate dehydrogenase, and \u03b1-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase activities. Several simulations were performed to determine affected mitochondria function in response to decreases in substrates. When fumarase activity was deficient, maximum ATP production was reduced to 95%. Deficiency of succinate dehydrogenase activity led to a similar reduction in ATP to fumarase activity. A deficiency of \u03b1-ketoglutarate activity reduced ATP production by only 5% but an 80% increase in fatty acid synthesis due to an alternative enzymatic route being necessary for maintaining ATP production.",

Lipids included in this section are phosphatidylserines, phosphatidylethanolamines, phosphatidylcholines, cardiolipins, phosphatidylinositols, phosphatidylglycerol, sphingomyelins, and ceramides. Their molecular diversity and high biological significance has been a catalyst for the establishment of lipidomics as a new technological paradigm. Lipid MAPS has captured such diversity as shown in Figure 19 . 322 Because of such diversity, the subcellular analysis of lipids requires an extensive ensemble of subcellular fractionation, lipid extraction, biomolecular separation and detection techniques. This diversity also poses major challenges when the goal is to characterize or quantify the complete set of lipids and their function in a subcellular fraction (i.e. subcellular lipidomics). 57 It is not surprising that complete lipidomic surveys rely on separations accomplished by gas chromatography, reverse phase HPLC, and hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC) to separate volatile, hydrophobic, and polar lipids, respectively. At the same time, structural characterization and quantification uses 1 H, 13 C, 17 O, and 31 P nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) (for simple mixtures) or high mass accuracy mass spectrometry with the caveat that the latter usually requires an internal isotopically labeled standard for quantification. However, the availability and ongoing proliferation of databases with detailed listings of m/z values of lipids make mass spectrometry the method of choice for comprehensive lipid identifications in lipidomics studies.",

In relation to \u03b1-tocopherol metabolites, the abundance of 13'-OH-\u03b1-tocopherol was highest in the microsomal fraction followed by the mitochondrial fraction, and was lowest in the peroxisomal fraction either when \u03b1-tocopherol was dietary only or injected. \u03b1-CEHC was found largely enriched in the mitochondrial fraction and was not detectable in either the microsomal or peroxisomal fractions.

The synaptosomes were subsequently disrupted and the released mitochondria were further purified by sucrose gradient centrifugation. In contrast, the non-synaptic mitochondria were directly purified by sucrose gradient centrifugation. Lipids in each mitochondria type were then extracted and analyzed by ESI-triple quadrupole mass spectrometry. In the second study, 360b the lipid profiles of the two mitochondria types were similar, except for increased phosphatidylserine and ceramide in synaptic mitochondria and increased cardiolipin in non-synaptic mitochondria. Phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylcholines, cholesterol, cardiolipin, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylglycerol, sphingomyelin, phosphatidylserine, and ceramide were all detected. The second study focused on the analysis of lipids extracted from non-synaptic mitochondria isolated from VM and B6 mice; the former has a 210-fold increase in incidence of brain tumors. 360a Relative to B6, the VM mouse model showed higher levels of ethanolamine glycerophospholipid, plasmenylethanolamine, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylserine, and ceramide. However, the VM mouse model manifested lower levels of choline glycerophospholipid and phosphatidylcholine. These results suggest an association of mitochondria lipid composition with brain cancer incidence. The third study compared the lipidomes of mouse mitochondria isolated from cancerous and non cancerous tissue and non-synaptic mouse mitochondria isolated from cultured astrocytes and mouse tumor cells. 360c This allowed for comparisons between both in vivo and in vitro models.",

Analysis of the organelle contents of xenobiotics and their metabolic products is essential to assess their toxicological, therapeutic, agonistic, or antagonistic effects.

The study of xenobiotics usually involves subcellular fractionation followed by compound extraction, and analysis with CE-LIF, HPLC-MS, flow cytometry, scintillation counting, inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES) or inductively coupled plasma -mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). The last two are well suited for elemental analysis without complications from matrix interferences.

To be effective, a compound that penetrates the cell must also reach the organelle that contains the compound's molecular target. In some instances, compound precursors (such as prodrugs) may need activation in a given subcellular environment before they exert their influence on the corresponding molecular target in the same or other subcellular environment. In contrast, localization of therapeutic compounds in non-target subcellular locations (or in non-target tissues) or biotransformations of the compound into other metabolic products may lead to unwanted side effects, cytotoxicity, or reduced potency.

This makes sediment-feeding polychaetes, such as marine worms, at risk for increased toxicity resulting from exposure to arsenite that forms from arsenate in sea water. 379 The association of arsenic exposure with accumulation, distribution, and speciation of arsenic in A. marina worm and its surroundings were examined in a recent study. 380 Arsenate was measured with either scintillation counting for seawater treatments or ICP-AES for sediment treatments. Subcellular fractionation of frozen-thawed A. marina produced three fractions containing: metal rich granules and cellular debris, organelles, and cytosolic components. The latter was further fractionated to produce a heat-sensitive protein fraction containing enzymes and a heat-stable protein fraction containing metalloproteins. Metalloproteins and metal-rich granules contained biologically detoxified arsenic, while organelles, enzymes, and cellular debris contained active arsenic species (likely arsenate and arsenite). The environments of A. marina had a dramatic effect on the subcellular distribution of total arsenic. Polychelates exposed to sediment with low levels of naturally occurring arsenic had 50% of the total arsenic detected in the cell homogenate (control) was in the metalloprotein fraction and 25% in the cellular debris. When worms were exposed to arsenic in the seawater, the metalloprotein and cellular debris levels remained similar to the basal levels, but arsenic appeared at 15% in the metal rich granules, 10% in the enzymes, and 5% in the organelles. With increasing arsenic levels, the cellular debris had 50% of the total arsenic and the relative arsenic levels in organelles and enzymes were lo wer. In the presence of high levels of arsenic in the sediment, arsenic levels reached 50% in the metalloproteins, 25% in the cellular debris, and 10% in the metal rich granules. These results suggest the cytosol is the main arsenic reservoir at basal-levels, but increased exposure leads to arsenic accumulation in the cellular debris, organelles, and enzyme fractions. While storage in the cellular debris is likely temporary, the transient storage of arsenic in both the organelle and enzyme fractions is significant when considering their association with arsenic toxicity.",

            "text": "Another essential component to investigate subcellular interactions has been the ever increasing knowledge of the proteins involved. Despite the multiple types of possible organelle interactions (c.f. Figure 27 ), the majority of these interactions rely on three types of proteins: Soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor activating protein receptors (SNARE), Rab, and proteins that are part of large complexes such as the homotypic fusion and vacuole p rotein-sorting (HOPS) complex. Understanding the role of these proteins in subcellular interactions generally requires genetic alteration of their levels using knockouts, knockdowns or overexpression and the use of techniques such as confocal fluorescence microscopy or transmission electron microscopy. Because of the importance of the function of these proteins in multiple reports included in this section, we explain salient features of these proteins in the next three paragraphs. SNARE proteins are responsible for trafficking, docking and fusion. 383 When SNARE proteins interact with each other they coil, b ringing membranes in different organelles in d irect contact with each other. 383 SNAREs are typically classified into subgroups such as v-SNARE (SNARE present on an interacting vesicle) and t-SNARE (the SNARE residing on the interacting vesicle's targeted membrane). Another common classification is R-SNARE (v-SNARE) and Q-SNARE (t-SNARE). The R and Q designation indicates the presence of either a glutamine or arginine amino acid in the SNARE. 383 When organelles begin to interact and SNARE proteins interact, SNAREs can be classified as trans-SNARE complexes. Once tethering occurs, the two organelle membranes begin to interact with each other and eventually form a single membrane. At this point, the SNARES are classified as cis-SNARE complexes. Interacting organelles will then complete fusion and the individual SNAREs used to form the SNARE complexes can be recycled or degraded. Some of the essential tSNARE proteins that are part of recent reports involving subcellular analysis are synaptosome-associated proteins (SNAP) and syntaxin. Similarly, among the vSNAREs that are relevant to recent reports involving subcellular analysis is the vesicle-associated membrane protein (VAMP). 383 Rab proteins are GTPases that cycle between GTP-bound and GDP-bound states and are believed to regulate SNARE activity. 384 Rabs are able to recruit multiple cytosolic proteins to the membranes. These proteins are capable of regulating SNAREs either directly or indirectly through Rab effector proteins. 385 An excellent review of Rab proteins has been recently published. 384 In addition to Rabs and SNAREs, protein complexes can have either a direct involvement in the formation of the trans-SNARE complex or promote organelle interactions indirectly.",

            "text": "Mitochondrial fusion, fission, and movement along the cytoskeleton are essential processes in cell function. Mitochondrial movement along the cytoskeleton is highly coordinated with their morphology. Two mitochondria moving towards each other may fuse and exchange their contents after contact. Similarly, fission of mitochondria has to involve adjacent mitochondrial regions pulling apart with opposite directionality. The balance between these two processes defines morphology and is influenced by factors such as Ca 2+ , nitric oxide, and protein aggregates. 389 While many proteins involved in these processes have been identified, 390 391 description of mitochondria that are unable to exchange contents, 392 the exchange of respiration complexes due to mitochondria fusion and fission, 393 and the discovery that mitochondria on different cytoskeletal tracks can still interact. 394 Because cytoskeletal polymerization and depolymerization dynamics occur at rates of microns per minute and are ten-fold faster than mitochondrial movement, the interactions between cytoskeleton and mitochondria require speed-matching molecular adaptors. Subcellular imaging facilitated the identification of a new molecular adaptor mmb1p in yeast. 391 The approach to define the role of this adaptor protein required using the proteins atb2p and cox4, which are in the cytoskeleton and mitochondria, respectively, as trackers. Colocalization of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) and red fluorescent protein (RFP) constructs of mmb1p and cox4, respectively, demonstrated that mmb1p interacts with the mitochondrial network. Similarly, colocalization of the fluorescent protein mCherry construct of atb2p with the mmb1p-GFP demonstrated that mmb1p also interacts with cytoskeletal microtubules. Live imaging using these protein constructs demonstrated that mmb1p slows down depolymerization of the cytoskeleton confirming that this protein works as a speed-matching molecular adaptor. Mitochondrial fusion enables the mixing of mitochondrial contents and may help compensate for damage in mitochondrial regions. Fission of a mitochondrion leads to two daughter mitochondria: one polarized and one depolarized, with the depolarized mitochondrion commonly destined for mitophagic degradation. Live track imaging has shown that mitochondria show concerted fusion/fission events as shown in Figure 28 . 395 These events appear in a \"kiss and run\" pattern with fusion lasting for 1 to 2 minutes. However, not all mitochondria appear to fuse or to experience fission. [395] [396] Live track imaging of mitochondria labeled with MTPA-GFP, a photoactivable (PA) fluorescent protein that localizes to the mitochondrial matrix, has shown that the activated GFP redistributes among some but not all mitochondria. In fact, some mitochondria retained their fluorescent load instead of distributing it to other mitochondria. The use of live track imaging of mitochondria with photoactivation of fluorescent proteins has also been applied to other biological systems as shown by a recent report that used this approach to monitor the movement of mitochondria on the cytoskeletal tracks of live BY-2 tobacco cells. 397 Live tracking microscopy has been adapted to monitor exchange of membrane proteins after mitochondrial fusion. A study focused on the distribution of Complex I, tagged with RFP or GFP after fusion of cells induced by polyethylene glycol. 398 After one hour, Complex I in mitochondria from both cells have mixed and Complex I showed a patchy appearance. Similarly, other complexes of the electron transport chain, labeled with either GFP or DsRed, showed mixing and patchy appearance in 10-24h after fusion as seen in Figure  29 . 393 An important discovery based on live track imaging was the transient fusion of mitochondria from adjacent microtubule scaffolds. 394 Using various matrix targeted fluorescent proteins, such as PA-GFP, kindling fluorescent protein (KFP), GFP, yellow fluorescent protein (YFP), and RFP, high resolution confocal imaging showed extremely short exchanges (4 seconds) between two mitochondria, that upon separation preserved their original morphology. Monitoring membrane potential with the dye DiIC 1 (5) and controlling temporal resolution using photoctivable KFP suggested that having a high membrane potential is not required for transient fusion/complete fusion. This report strongly suggests that mitochondrial dynamics are indeed more complex than initially anticipated. In may not be simply a fusion-fission process that uses the cytoskeleton as scaffold. In fact, other forms of communication between mitochondria and peroxisomes that appear budding of 100-nm diameter vesicles from mammalian mitochondria have been recently suggested. 399 ",

In order to elucidate the molecular basis of this process, a previously used in vitro technique combined isolated vacuoles isolated from two separate yeast strands. 407 Each strand has the components needed for activation of alkaline phosphatase upon vacuolar fusion. One strand had Prb1p, a vacuolar serine protease; the second strand had pro-alkaline phosphatase that was activated by Prb1p upon fusion. Fusion was reported as activity of alkaline phosphatase that transforms paranitrophenol phosphate into p-nitrophenol.

Although salt concentration and temperature also play a role in fission, these factors cannot explain the level of fission caused by TORC1.

            "text": "Another study on fission used unillamellar liposomes immobilized onto silica beads as organelle models. An excess of liposomes were deposited onto the silica beads in the presence of a high ionic strength buffer. Addition of dynamin and GTP led to formation of tubules, formation of vesicles and their fission in the form of budding vesicles. Although the dynamics are much slower than those observed in cells, this subcellular model provides evidence that dynamin is a key player in fusion and that it is not removal of GTP that causes fusion. Similar studies on fission using artificial organelle models could be done with other proteins that are involved in the fission of the ER (Sar1 GTPase) or the Golgi (Arf1 GTPase). 411 Fission is also a key feature of transport between the Golgi and the ER, because it is involved in the formation of vesicles where budding begins. Transport from the ER to the Golgi requires GTP hydrolysis and a coating defined as COPII, which includes Sar1p, Sec23/24p, and Sec 13/31p proteins. Using giant unilammelar liposomes that mimic the composition of the ER and that are observable by confocal microscopy, a recent report described that the coat is essential for formation of a tubular structure (bead-on-a-string morphology) that is prominent in the reconstituted liposomes when GTP is replaced by a non-hydrolysable analog. These observations also suggest that other proteins must be participating to regulate the degree of fission and that transport may include structures other than single vesicles such as a fused train of partially joined vesicles. 412 A related study used giant unilammelar liposomes with compositions resembling that of the Golgi to investigate the retrograde transport from the Golgi to the ER. 413 Because of the enlarged size of the liposomes, the resolution of fluorescence microscopy was adequate to observe membrane deformation and track fluorescently labeled species. Resembling conditions in the Golgi (e.g., low membrane tension) the protein Arf1 interacted with the coatamer (complex mixture of coat-related proteins) in the Golgi membrane system inducing regions of extensive membrane deformations with lipid compositions, which are believed to b e different from the parental membrane. In contrast to fission observed in the liposome model of ER to Golgi transport, the retrograde transport model from the Golgi to the ER did not show vesiculation. On the other hand, the clearly defined membrane deformations that were observed suggested that such deformations are critical to the tubovesicular transport between the Golgi and other intracellular compartments.",

In addition to their maturation to late endosomes, early endosomes may interact with recycling endosomes to return endocytosed material back to the extracellular space. Early endosomes may also interact with the Golgi to deliver endocytosed materials. 415 Despite their multiple interactions, the most common fate of early endosomes is their maturation into late endosomes. Late endosomes are more acidic than their precursors, the early endosomes. Due to their structure, they are also known as multivesicular bodies (Table 1 ). In addition to maturation to lysosomes, late endosomes are also able to interact with autophagosomes to form amphiosomes (See 5.7.2).",

This study also used a yeast two-hybrid screen, which is a valuable tool to identify protein binding partners and to assist in determining the specific function of proteins.

Materials such as transferrin and cholera toxin B are then delivered to the Golgi and ER for reuse in the cell and low density lipoprotein and dextran are delivered to the late endosome and lysosome for degradation. Synthetic fluorescent analogues of transferrin, acetylated-low density lipoprotein, cholera toxin subunit, and dextran were used to investigate in vitro fission of early endosomes in rat adrenal medulla cells. 419 The in vitro assay developed is based on confocal fluorescence microscopy imaging of organelles isolated from cells loaded with he fluorescent analogues m entioned above. After endocytosis of transferrin or lowdensity lipoprotein for five minutes, cells were diluted into cargo-free medium for 30 minutes. After the chase, the cells were homogenized and the post-nuclear fraction was imaged. To increase fission of early endosomes, the supernatant was incubated at 37\u00b0C in the presence of ATP and rat brain cytosol. Confocal fluorescent microscopy showed fission of early endosomes characterized by the segregation of cargo consisting of two fluorescent species originally colocalized within the early endosome. Such segregation reflects mechanisms by which the fission process separates cargo trafficking to the Golgi and ER (e.g., AlexaFluor488-transferrin) or to late endosomes and lysosomes (e.g., AlexaFluor594acetylated low density lipoprotein). Initially early endosomes will contain both fluorophores, but as they segregate into vesicles, the fluorophores are no longer colocalized. The assay was used to identify key proteins involved in early endosome fission. Inhibiting the function of early endosomal auto antigen 1 (EEA1), which is used in binding vesicles, by treatment with anti-EEA1 antibody inhibited the fission of early endosomes (i.e. the fluorescent transferrin and low density lipoprotein cargo remained colocalized). Cells possessing a mutated form of the protein N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor, which participates in recycling of cis-SNARE complexes, also inhibited early endosome fission. This suggests both EEA1 and N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor are important for early endosome interactions with other organelles.",

EGF and EGFR are targeted to early endosomes, transferred to the late endosomes, and finally degraded in lysosomes, while the influenza A virus is endocytosed, transferred to the early endosome, then retained in the late endosome, and then finally released into the nucleus and cytosol. A recent study investigated the role of the ubiquitin-complex scaffolding protein Cullin-3 (Cul3) in the endocytosis of three very different cargos in adenocarcinomic human alveolar basal epithelial cells and HeLa cells. 425 Confocal fluorescence microscopy was used to monitor EGFR, EGF, and influenza A virus in organelles and Western blotting was used to track EGFR degradation. Transmission electron microscopy of Cul3 knockdown cells showed an increased size and increase number of vacuoles. These vacuoles were likely late endosomes because LysoTracker staining showed that they were acidic and because immunolabeling revealed that they contained Rab7. In addition, confocal fluorescence microscopy of knockdowns of Cul3 showed an increased colocalization of Influenza A virus with both LAMP1 and cation-independent mannose-6-phosphate receptor positive organelles. This suggests that they were retained in the late endosomes. In the case of EGF and EGFR, knockdowns of Cul3 had twice as many EGF-positive vesicles, which were seemingly late endosomes or lysosomes b ecause they were also immunolabeled with L AMP1 antibodies. Western blotting indicated a 9-fold increase in EGFR signal in the Cul3 knockdown cell suggesting that Cul3 is essential for EGFR degradation after EGF binding. Interestingly, when EGF was bound to EGFR for degradation, the complex was ubiquitinated even in Cul3 knockdown cells. This suggests the EGFR complex was marked for degradation by an ubiquitin ligase (not activity from Cul3) but the absence of Cul3 caused changes in endocytic flux. Figure  32 but also with other non-endocytic organelles as shown in Figure 27 . An example of this is an indirect interaction with autophagosomes. The ability of ubiquilin to be degraded in chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) was recently investigated. 431 Ubiquilin is known to regulate ER-mediated protein degradation but its role it macroautophagy and CMA have not been determined. CMA was examined by treating enriched lysosomes with ubiquilin and assessing CMA-based lysosome internalization with an in vitro assay. This assay used media optimized for CMA either with or without the presence of protease inhibitors. To determine the rate of lysosome internalization, Western blotting of ubiquilin, glyceraldehyde-3phosphate dehydrogenase (known to be internalized by CMA), and ovalbumin (not internalized by CMA) was used. The assay indicated that 10% of ubiquilin was internalized into lysosomes by CMA. When ubiquilin had to compete for CMA internalization with simultaneous treatment with glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, ubiquilin internalization was decreased 50%. This competition was not observed with ovalbumin. When antibodies that bind either hsc70 or LAMP2A were added, both known CMA protein mediators, ubiquilin internalization was eliminated providing further evidence that ubiquilin is internalized into lysosomes with CMA. Enriched autophagosome fractions also contained ubiquilin. The authors proposed that depletion of ubiquilin with CMA could decrease the formation of autophagosomes. Accordingly, the decrease of CMA could increase the formation of autophagosomes.",

When Rabs were inactivated via treatment with a Rab GDP dissociation inhibitor, the amount of interaction between early endosomes and lipid droplets was significantly decreased as determined by Western blotting of lipid droplets after removal of other components. To further strengthen the argument that Rabs were critical to interactions with lipid droplets and early endosomes, lipid droplets were treated with GTP\u03b3S and early endosomes. Due to their GTPase activity, presence of GTP\u03b3S locks Rabs in their active form. When droplets were treated with early endosomes and GTP\u03b3S, there was a significant increase in EEA1 and transferrin (both early endosome markers), which colocalized with Rab5 and Rab11 (lipid droplet markers). Overall, these results confirmed that Rab proteins are needed for lipid droplet-early endosome interaction. To confirm the role of Rab5, a protein known to interact with EEA1, the interaction between immunolabeled EEA1 and either wild type or mutated Myc-tagged-Rab5 was monitored in vivo by confocal fluorescent microscopy.

In comparison, Golgi markers RFP-mannosidase-II, RFP-Rab6, and RFP-Rab2 and ER markers GFP-Sp-12 indicated Golgi and ER morphology were not affected by SNAP29 knockdown.

Confocal fluorescence microscopy showed that a GFP-VAMP7 construct (with GPF at the N-terminus) caused VAMP7 containing exosomes to traffic but not interact with the plasma membrane. GFP-containing exosomes were larger in size as compared to exosomes possessing VAMP7-GFP (with GFP at the C-terminus). This suggests exosomes originating from late endosome interactions were unable to interact with the plasma membrane when VAMP7 was not f unctional. V AMP3 was also shown to regulate autophagosome-late endosome interactions. 435 Transmission electron microscopy revealed that VAMP3 colocalized with LC3. Starvation, which induces autophagy, caused an increase in the colocalization of Rab11, a late endosome protein, and LC3 indicating increased interaction between late endosomes and autophagosomes. Accordingly, the expression of the light chain of the tetanus protein, a protein that cleaves VAMP-3 rendering it non-functional, caused decreased interaction between autophagosomes and late endosomes. The interactions of late endosomes were further assessed to determine if VAMP7 and VAMP3 are able to regulate each other. When VAMP7 function was decreased, autophagosome-late endosome in teractions also decreased. This suggests the VAMP7 in late endosomes is able to regulate autophagosome interactions indirectly.",

The shared distribution of the ESCRT proteins between the two organelles suggested that the organelles had interactions. In wild type Vps2, the Golgi and late endosomes markers Syp61 and Vps2 gradually delocalized over time.

DFCP1-fluorescent areas (punctates) were present in both ER and autophagosomes and were colocalized with LC3 in autophagosomes.

Western blotting of phagosome enriched fractions 'floated' in sucrose density gradient centrifugation revealed 22 and 17 Rab proteins present in phagosomes when cells were infected with S. aureus and M. tuberculosis, respectively. Only Rab8, Rab8b, Rab9, Rab22b, and Rab43 were common in phagosomes after infection with either bacterium. Mutated forms of each Rab made it possible to single out those involved in phagosome-lysosome interactions. Rab7, Rab20, and Rab39 favored phagosome-lysosome interaction in M. tuberculosis-containing phagosomes. Furthermore, Rab7, Rab20, Rab22b, Rab32, Rab34, Rab38, and Rab43 recruited lysosomal cathepsin D to phagosomes indicating that M. tuberculosis-containing phagosomes were able to interact with lysosomes. Further confirmation showed that mutated forms of Rab7, Rab20, Rab22b, Rab32, Rab34, Rab38, and Rab43 prevented phagosome acidification and cathepsin D recruitment. Since both this study 452e and the study mentioned in the previous paragraph 452d used the same cell line, but different pathogens, it is feasible to compare the role of Rab proteins that were studied. Surprisingly, Rab7 was the only protein with equivalent roles in the pathogenic systems that were investigated. Rab32 had several roles: it was involved in the degradation of S. Typhimurium and was used to internalize S. aureus and M. tuberculosis.",

The phagosome-lysosome fusion, i nduced by cholesterol depletion, was observed through transmission electron microscopy. Although M. avium-containing phagosomes fused with lysosomes, the lytic environment of the phagolysosomes was not sufficient to degrade this pathogen. Some protozoa parasites have an amastigotes (intracellular stage of cell cycle) and a promastigotes (extracellular stage of cell cycle). In L. chagasi both parasitic stages display unique interactions with membrane c omponents to maximize their survival. In a recent study the parasitic L. chagasi parasitic cell line was used to investigate the interactions of phagosomes in mouse bone marrow macrophages, containing one of the two stages of L. chagasi, and endocytic organelles. 452h Confocal fluorescence microscopy revealed that disrupting the cholesterol-containing lipid rafts on the plasma membrane decreased promastigote phagocytosis. Despite this decrease, promastigotes transferred to organelles with LAMP1 (late endosomes, lysosomes) earlier than amastigotes; this transfer continued over 24 hours. On the other hand, an entirely different intracellular route was observed for amastigotes. Amastigotes localized longer than promastigotes in vacuoles that displayed early endosome markers Rab5 and EA1 (early endosome-antigen 1). This colocalization was persisted for up to 2 hours and was not affected by disruption in lipid rafts. Overall, these two parasitic forms seem to use two different intracellular routes to avoid degradation: amastigotes extend their survival by retaining early endosome markers. Promastigotes extend their survival by delaying their interaction with late endosomes and lysosomes.",

To monitor the recycling of phagosomal components to the plasma membrane, S. aureus was opsonized with 125 I-mouse anti-DNP IgG and the radioactivity of 125 I-mouse anti-DNP IgG was measured in the extracellular media, which is indicative of phagosome-plasma membrane interactions.

This role was supported in a recent study that investigated the subcellular localization and effects of altering Sec22 levels on the morphology of the ER and the Golgi. 477a Confocal fluorescence microscopy and transmission electron microscopy indicated Myc-Sec22 fusion protein localized to the ER membrane (colocalized with the marker calreticulin) and not in the Golgi in A. thaliana seedlings. Similar results were observed for mouse Sec22 and human Sec22 homologue proteins. Knockdown of Sec22 resulted in changed (narrower) morphology of Golgi stacks. Another effect of knocking down Sec22 was the formation of vesicle aggregates derived from the Golgi as determined from transmission electron microscopy colocalization experiments using the Golgi marker \u03b3-COP immuno-gold.",

Two GAPs were of relevance: TBC1D20 and RN-tre. When RN-tre was knocked down, it had a minimal effect on the appearance ER-Golgi associated vesicles, suggesting that its role may be associated with the interactions of the Golgi with a different organelle. Rab1 was the main TBC1D20 interactor discovered via a yeast two-hybrid screen. There were high rates of GTP hydrolysis when both proteins were present and complete fragmentation of the Golgi when Rab1 was knocked down. On the other hand, Rab1 inactivation through knockdown of TBC1D20 caused an accumulation of ER-derived vesicles containing COPII.

Western blotting of the ER protein BiP, which is upregulated in response to ER stress, was used as an indicator of ER stress. Because, ER stress induced by tunicamycin generates hydrogen sulfide, such stress decreased tyrosine phosphatase 1B activity. This effect was reversible as confirmed by treatment with reducing agents. Liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry indicated the active site cysteine residue was reduced following deactivation with hydrogen sulfide. When cystathionine-\u03b3-lyase, an enzyme that produces hydrogen sulfide, was knocked down and ER stress was triggered with tunicamycin, hydrogen sulfide production was reduced.

XBP1 causes extension of ER size and increased levels of phosphatidylcholine, the most abundant lipid in the ER. Phosphatidylcholine is synthesized through the Kennedy pathway and the rate-limiting enzyme is CCT, which converts phosphocholine to cytidine diphosphocholine. This suggests that XBP1 regulates CCT and CCT could regulate growth of the ER. Increased expression of XBP1 caused increased CCT expression as determined by Western blotting. In agreement, there was an increase in CCT enzymatic activity and increased production of cytidine diphosphocholine and phosphatidylcholine, which were determined from methyl-[ 3 -H]-choline chloride incorporation, detected with scintillation spectroscopy. When CCT expression was increased independently of XBP1, a similar increase in production of cytidine diphosphocholine and phosphatidylcholine was observed. To determine the ability of CCT to regulate ER extension, the surface area of the E R in cells expressing XBP1, CCT, or simply an empty vector were compared by transmission electron microscopy. XBP1 caused a 3-fold increase in surface area and volume, however, CCT expressing cells caused only a modest increase over the empty vector. This suggests that even though CCT does significantly alter phosphatidylcholine concentration in the ER, CCT was not sufficient to account for the significant ER size changes observed.",

The number of organelles and cells that can be analyzed is usually limited to a maximum of t ens of organelles, which limits the available sample size for subsequent data analysis. Isolation, purification and the subsequent analysis of intact organelles have been the method of choice for analyzing organelle function. The benefit is usually a high number of organelles that are analyzed, while the drawback is that the function of organelles may change after their release from the cellular environment. 554 Similarly, flow cytometry is a well-established technique for a high throughput, detection of cell-to-cell heterogeneity. However, its use for the analysis of intact organelles has been quite limited due to its rather poor sensitivity. 555 Capillary electrophoresis with laser induced fluorescence detection (CE-LIF) has been shown to be a powerful method for the analysis of individual organelles. 556 CE separates individual organelles based on the differences in their surface charge density, thus providing information about the surface properties of each organelle. The separation takes place in a narrow bore fused silica capillary attached to an ultra-sensitive laser-induced fluorescence d etector with a zeptomolar limit of detection. In this arrangement, CE-LIF can measure multiple fluorescence parameters of each organelle with a higher sensitivity compared to flow cytometry and provide additional information about the surface properties of each particular organelle. CE-LIF was used to investigate distributions of mtDNA in individual mitochondria released from 143B cells. 396 This method enabled the detection of a single copy of mtDNA in a single mitochondrion. The same approach was used to d etermine the pH heterogeneity within acidic organelles in two human leukemia cell lines. 154 The drugresistant human lymphoblast cell line CEM/C2 contained acidic organelles with a mean pH of 5.1. This was 1 pH unit lower than the mean pH of acidic organelles found in the drug resistant human lymphoblast cell line C CRF-CEM. Cytoskeletal binding to mitochondria was also investigated by CE-LIF. 557 By simultaneous fluorescence labeling of mitochondria and F-actin, it was found that 21% of mitochondria isolated by a standard isolation technique contained cytoskeletal remnants on their surface. The electropherogram showing cytoskeleton binding to mitochondria is shown in Figure 35 . 557 Another major benefit of the narrow capillary of a CE instrument is that it can also be easily u sed as a precise injection device, which allows investigators to sample and characterize properties of mitochondria from single cells 558 and muscle tissue cross-sections. 559 ",

This is particularly relevant when the drug target is localized in an intracellular organelle. Recent reviews describe m ethods of subcellular drug targeting based on molecular designs. 578 These developments clearly rely on our understanding on how membrane proteins, lipids, nutrients and some pathogens are internalized into the cell to be targeted to distinct subcellular compartments via membrane trafficking (reviewed in 5.). A more specialized drug delivery system is gene therapy that aims to regulate gene expression.",

The cytoplasm, nucleus, and mitochondria have been considered primary targets for gene delivery using targeting moieties or environment-responsive materials. 579 The importance of biomedical nanotechnology in modern society is having unprecedented impact on research addressing gene therapies, m olecular imaging devices, and treatments for organelle-specific diseases.

These organelles do not dock to the plasma membrane. Release of enlargeosomes is stimulated by Ca 2+ , some esters, or ATP. Involved in the internalization of extracellular components into the cell and traffics components to the lysosome for degradation. However, endosomes also recycle material to the plasma membrane (recycling endosomes) and transfer material to the Golgi. Early endosomes are a dynamic tubular-vesicular network. Upon maturation to late endosomes they become more acidic and vesicles aooear in the lumen becoming multi-vesicular bodies that lack tubules. Late endosomes fuse with lysosomes. In plants, late endosomes can also be referred to as multivesicular bodies. Recycling endosomes consist mainly of tubular networks that return receptor molecules to the plasma membrane.Network of interconnected tubules and membrane sheets held together through cytoskeletal contacts. Its membrane is continuous with the outer membrane of the nucleus. When associated with ribosomes (rough ER) it is involved in the folding of recently synthesized proteins. When devoid of ribosomes (smooth ER), it is involved in lipid synthesis, carbohydrate processing and metabolism, detoxification, and calcium regulation. Vesicles secreted by mammalian cells when multi-vesicular bodies (late endosomes) fuse with the plasma membrane.
