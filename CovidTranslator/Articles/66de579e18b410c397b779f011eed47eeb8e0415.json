            "text": "Oncolytic virus immunotherapy is a therapeutic approach to cancer treatment that utilizes native or genetically modified viruses that selectively replicate within tumour cells. The ability of viruses to kill cancer cells has been recognized for nearly a century, but only over the past decade have clinical trials documented a therapeutic benefit in patients with cancer [1] [2] [3] . Interest in oncolytic viruses has been increasing, based on a better understanding of viral biology, tumour immunology and molecular genetics. Furthermore, a recent randomized Phase III clinical trial demonstrated an improved durable response rate for patients with advanced melanoma who were treated with a modified herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), encoding granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) 3 . This virus, termed talimogene laherparepvec (T-VEC; Amgen), is widely anticipated to be the first oncolytic virus immuno therapy to be approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of cancer. The success of T-VEC is likely to promote further drug development within this new class of cancer therapeutics.",

            "text": "In normal cells, a variety of signalling pathways operate to detect and clear pathogenic viral particles (FIG. 1) . These pathways can be stimulated by local interferon (IFN) release or through intracellular Toll-like receptors (TLRs), which are activated by viral elements. TLRs are cell surface and intracellular pattern recognition receptors that are activated in response to repeated sequences, so-called pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), which are common to pathogenic bacteria and viruses. PAMPs may include elements of viral capsids, DNA, RNA and viral protein products. TLR signalling activates host cell antiviral responses and systemic innate immunity. Several downstream host cell factors involved in oncolytic virus clearance have been identified, including TNFassociated factor 3 (TRAF3), IFN-related factor 3 (IRF3), IRF7 and retinoic acid-inducible gene 1 (RIG-1). These factors activate the JAK-STAT (Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription) pathway, which coordinates the antiviral machinery in infected cells. The antiviral machinery reinforces local IFN release, which activates PKR activity. PKR is an intracellular protein kinase that recognizes double-stranded RNA and other viral elements 10, 11 . When activated by viral elements, PKR terminates cell protein synthesis and promotes rapid cell death and viral clearance. In cancer cells, IFN pathway signalling and PKR activity may be abnormal, and viral clearance is thwarted 12 . Induction of systemic anti-tumour immunity. The induction of systemic innate and tumour-specific adaptive immune responses appears to be a critical element for tumour eradication with oncolytic viruses. Following oncolytic Figure 1 | Oncolytic viruses can exploit cancer immune evasion pathways. a | Following viral infection, most normal cells activate an antiviral pathway that allows to contain viral infections. The antiviral machinery can be triggered by viral pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) that activate Toll-like receptors (TLRs) or through the detection of viral nucleic acids by retinoic acid-inducible gene 1 (RIG-1). Once a virus is detected, a signalling cascade through several type I interferon (IFN) elements (Janus kinase (JAK), signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT), and interferon regulatory factor 9 (IRF9)) results in a programmed transcriptional pathway that limits viral spread and can target infected cells for apoptosis or necrosis. Local IFN production induced by the innate immune response to viral infections may also promote antiviral activity through the IFN receptor (IFNR). TLRs signal via the myeloid differentiation primary response protein MYD88, TIR-domain-containing adapter-inducing IFN\u03b2 (TRIF), IRF7, IRF3 and nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB), inducing the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and type I IFNs. The type I IFNs signal through the JAK-STAT signalling pathway, resulting in the upregulation of cell cycle regulators, such as protein kinase R (PKR) and IRF7, which limit viral spread by binding to viral particles and triggering type I IFN transcriptional pathways, promoting abortive apoptosis of infected cells and the production of cytokines that alert the immune system to the presence of a viral infection. b | In cancer cells, however, this process is disrupted. Cancer cells may downregulate key signalling components within the innate signalling pathway, including RIG-1, IRF7, and IRF3 (REF. 1 ). This limits detection of viral particles by TLR and RIG-1, making cancer cells more susceptible to viral replication. Furthermore, cancer cells may downregulate key components of the type I IFN signalling pathway 2-7 , thereby limiting the pro-apoptotic and cell cycle regulatory effects of type I IFNs. Although data are limited, the figure depicts individual viruses near the factors and/or pathways that are known to promote viral elimination in normal cells (part a) or that support viral replication owing to factor deficiency in cancer cells (part b). dsRNA, double-stranded RNA; NDV, Newcastle disease virus; TRAF, TNF-associated factor; VSV, vesicular stomatitis virus.",

For example, tumour cells and the microenvironment can express immuneinhibitory surface receptors that inactivate effector immune cells, and secrete factors -such as IL-10, transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF\u03b2) and indoleamine-2,3dioxygenase (IDO) -that facilitate the recruitment of immune-suppressive cells, such as tumour-associated macrophages 19 and myeloid-derived suppressor cells 20 , to sites of tumour growth 21 . Oncolytic viruses modify this suppressive microenvironment through a variety of mechanisms that alter the cytokine milieu and the type of immune cells within the tumour microenvironment 22, 23 . These changes promote immune-mediated tumour cell recognition and eradication, and can trigger tumour-associated antigen and epitope spreading 24,25 . In the presence of danger signals and TLR engagement, the levels of type I IFNs and other inflammatory mediators increase, further potentiating systemic immunity against the cancer.",

Such neo-antigens may be taken up by local APCs in the context of a pro-inflammatory environment, which can trigger an immune response against the neo-antigen. If new T cell clones are generated, they may be able to circulate and kill antigen-expressing cancer cells, including cancer cells that were not infected by the virus. The immune response has also been associated with a 'immune-associated' bystander effect, in which local release of cytotoxic perforins and granzymes may result in the killing of nearby tumour cells, even in the absence of direct antigen expression 28 .

Furthermore, tumours are dense with extracellular matrix and are poorly vascularized. The majority of clinical studies with oncolytic viruses (such as adenovirus, poxvirus, HSV-1, measles, and reovirus) have used intratumoural injections to bypass the tumour architectural barriers. However, intratumoural injections are limited to tumours that are physically accessible through clinical palpation or direct imaging. As discussed above, injection of an oncolytic virus into one tumour lesion can induce a systemic anti-tumour response that can overcome physical limitations, as evidenced in the T-VEC OPTIM Phase III clinical trial 3 . Other viruses, such as Seneca Valley Virus, can be delivered intravenously because of natural resistance to haemagglutination, a process resulting in premature viral clearance and reduced delivery to the tumour site following intravenous delivery 32 .",

This may be overcome by direct injection into central nervous system (CNS) tumours or through the use of external reservoirs that communicate with sites of brain tumours. Parvovirus naturally crosses the blood-brain barrier, allowing for the delivery of this oncolytic virus via the intravascular route. Parvovirus H-1PV has been used in clinical trials of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) 33 likely to be permissive to infection 31, 36, 37 . Stromal cells, such as cancer-associated fibroblasts, may be infected by oncolytic viruses but are non-permissive to viral replication. Thus, fibroblasts may act as a decoy reservoir for oncolytic viruses, reducing the delivery of infectious virions to cancer cells 38 . Another mechanism that may limit the overall effectiveness of oncolytic viruses is the susceptibility of cancer cells to apoptosis, which may be induced by viral infection or other factors 39 . If cells undergo apoptosis too rapidly, this will reduce the time for viral replication and propagation and decrease the amount of active virus in the tumour, ultimately limiting the active intratumoural dose.",

Reovirus and vaccinia virus show natural selectivity for cancer cells with an over-active RAS signalling pathway. In normal healthy cells, reovirus is able to enter the cell and begin producing viral RNAs, which activates the PKR pathway. Activated PKR, in turn, inhibits protein translation, preventing the production of viral particles and stopping the spread of the virus 57 . However, RAS-transformed cancer cells do not initiate the PKR pathway, rendering cancer cells permissive to viral infection and ultimately cell lysis 53 . An attenuated HSV-1 oncolytic virus, in which the viral genes encoding ICP34.5 and unique short 11 glycoprotein (US11) are deleted, results in preferential lysis of tumour cells compared to normal cells 74, 79 . This occurs, in part, because these deletions render HSV-1 unable to block PKR phosphorylation, so it can only replicate in cells with defective PKR signalling 87 . Vaccinia virus, a member of the poxvirus family, depends on epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-induced RAS signalling for viral replication 54 .

This virus does not produce E1A in healthy cells and these cells undergo apoptosis, thereby restricting viral proliferation in healthy tissue. However, in prostate cancer cells the PSA promoter is highly active and E1A is selectively expressed, resulting in proliferation of the adenovirus and virus-mediated cell lysis. In a similar manner, the oncolytic adenovirus KH901 was engineered to express E1A under the control of the human telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) promoter, which is activated in a large number of cancers 64 .

Several oncolytic adenoviruses, including ONYX-015 and H101, have been designed with a deletion in the gene coding for the protein E1B, which can bind to and inactivate the pro-apoptotic protein p53 (REFS 85, 86) . Thus, healthy cells that are infected with these viruses can undergo p53 -mediated abortive apoptosis, whereas cancer cells that commonly inactivate p53 remain susceptible to viral infection. Furthermore, these adenoviruses preferentially proliferate in and lyse p53-deficient cancer cells, which account for nearly 50% of all cancers. Another approach to improve post-entry tumour specificity has been to encode synthetic miRNA targeting sequences (miRTS) into the 3\u0374 untranslated region (UTR) of the fusion gene of the measles virus.

However, attenuation of vaccinia virus through the deletion of VGF makes replication in normal cells difficult and allows viral proliferation only in cells with aberrant EGFR-RAS signalling, as frequently found in cancer cells 64, 75 .

However, cancer cells commonly disrupt the type I IFN pathway to evade the immune system, and thus they are susceptible to infection and subsequent lysis.

The process of tumour clearance by immune stimulation is critical to the anti-tumour activity of oncolytic viruses, and several strategies have been devised to engineer oncolytic viruses so they can more effectively stimulate anti-tumour immune responses.

This strategy has been well described for viruses such as HSV-1, adenovirus, and vaccinia virus. Studies of HSV-1 in mice demonstrated rejection of contralateral, un-injected flank tumours only when GM-CSF, a cytokine that promotes dendritic cell accumulation and maturation, was engineered into the viral genome 74, 79 .

In order to reduce pathogenesis while enhancing selective tumour cell infectivity, T-VEC contains deletions of the neurovirulence gene ICP34.5 and the inhibitor of antigen presentation ICP47 (REFS 74, 79) . As discussed above, ICP34.5 is critical for blocking the host antiviral PKR-IFN response and required for HSV-1 infectivity of neurons 120 . In T-VEC, two ICP34.5 genes are deleted and this improves cancer cell selectivity and prevents infection of neurons, thereby significantly reducing the overall pathogenesis of HSV-1. ICP47 deletion results in the presentation of viral antigens by both healthy and cancer cells, which leads to the containment of the infection in healthy tissues and immune-mediated destruction of cancer cells that selectively propagate oncolytic HSV-1. The deletion of ICP47 also induces the early activation of the US11 promoter. HSV-1 US11 blocks PKR phosphorylation, and thereby prevents cancer cells from undergoing abortive apoptosis when infected 87 . Thus, expression of HSV-1 US11 earlier in the viral infection cycle increases oncolytic therapeutic activity. Finally, the gene encoding GM-CSF has been engineered into the viral genome in place of the ICP34.5 genes to improve the induction of antitumour immunity.",

In this study, 50 participants were enrolled and an objective response rate of 26% was reported with generally low-grade constitutional toxicity including fever, fatigue and local injection site reactions. T-VEC was then evaluated in a prospective, randomized clinical Phase III trial in 436 patients with unresectable stage IIIB, IIIC or IV melanoma 122 . The trial met its primary end point, with a durable response rate (defined as an objective response beginning within 12 months of treatment and lasting for at least 6 months) of 16.3% in patients receiving T-VEC compared to 2.1% in patients given GM-CSF (odds ratio = 8.9; P <0.0001) 3 . This included responses in all lesions, injected and non-injected. An objective response rate of 26.4% was reported (compared to 5.7% for GM-CSF-treated participants), with 10.9% achieving a complete response. In addition, patients given T-VEC had an improved median overall survival (23.3 months versus 18.9 months for GM-CSF-treated patients), although the study was not powered for survival. An especially strong effect was seen in patients with stage III and IV M1a tumours, suggesting that T-VEC might be particularly well suited for the treatment of early-stage patients with less extensive visceral disease. Treatment was well tolerated, with the majority of adverse events related to fever, chills, nausea, fatigue and local injection site reactions. Based on these results, an FDA advisery panel voted to approve T-VEC, and a final ruling is pending.",

Adenoviruses commonly infect both humans and animals and can be transmitted through aerosols and direct contact. This results in the majority of the population being seropositive for adenovirus exposure. Although asymptomatic in immune-competent hosts, adenoviral infections can cause disease in newborns and immunocompromised patients. Adenovirus enters the cell using the coxsackie-adenovirus receptor (CAR). Upon cell entry, adenovirus traffics to the nucleus where it expresses adenoviral early genes (encoding E1A and E1B), which are necessary for viral propagation. Specifically, E1A and E1B target the tumour suppressors p53 and retinoblastoma-associated protein (pRb) to promote cell cycle entry. However, in healthy cells the targeting of host cell cycle regulators p53 and pRb by the adenoviral E1A and E1B proteins results in abortive apoptosis and clearance of the virus 124, 125 .

Therefore, adenoviruses have been engineered to target surface receptors that are more universally upregulated on cancer cells. This concept is being clinically evaluated in ovarian cancer, using a modified Ad5/3-\u039424 virus 128 . Because ovarian cancer has a variable expression pattern of CAR, the Ad5/3-\u039424 virus capsid was modified to incorporate an RGD (Arg-Gly-Asp) motif into the HI loop of the fibre knob (a portion of the outer layer of adenovirus capsids) 48 . This modification permits cell entry through the binding of adenovirus to other receptors, including \u03b1v\u03b23 and \u03b1v\u03b25 integrins 129 , which are highly expressed on ovarian cancer cells 49 . DNX-2401, an adenovirus with this RGD motif, has entered Phase I clinical trials in glioma. To further improve targeting of adenoviruses, mosaics (combined serotypes) are being developed. Specifically, the adenovirus serotype 35 (Ad35) preferentially uses CD46 rather than CAR for cell entry 130 . CD46 expression prevents normal cells from being recognized by complement and subsequently eliminated. Cancer cells have been shown to overexpress CD46 and subvert recognition in this manner. Therefore, a mosaic oncolytic adenovirus has been engineered with the CAR-binding sequence of Ad5 replaced with the CD46-binding sequence of Ad35 A number of oncolytic adenoviruses in clinical development were designed to take advantage of aberrant signalling pathways in cancer cells.

Based on the importance of the immune response and the ability of the vaccinia viral genome to accept large transgenes (25 kb), vaccinia virus has been engineered to express tumour antigens, T cell co-stimulatory molecules, and inflammatory cytokines. Specifically, the expression of tumour antigens PSA, CEA or mucin 1 (MUC1) by vaccinia virus results in the presentation of the tumour antigen in the context of a potent antiviral response, which generates an enhanced antigen-specific antitumour immune response 137, 138 . Furthermore, vaccinia virus expression of the co-stimulatory molecule B7-1 by itself or in combination with ICAM-1 and lymphocyte function-associated antigen 3 (LFA3) (the combination is termed TRICOM) provides the co-stimulatory signalling needed by antitumour CD8 + T cells and has shown clinical activity with an acceptable safety profile in early-phase clinical trials 77 .

Indeed, adenovirus, reovirus, herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) and parvovirus have been clinically evaluated in combination with surgical resection, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy 176-178 .

The NDV protein haemagglutininneuraminidase can act as a potent antigen that augments cytolytic T cell responses against infected tumour cells 148 . Thus, NDV-induced apoptosis of cancer cells results in the conversion of an immune-suppressive tumour microenvironment into a pro-inflammatory environment that supports antitumour immune responses. Interestingly, even low titres of NDV can limit tumour growth, suggesting that a key factor in its therapeutic activity may be the generation of an antitumour immune response 149 . Additionally, despite having a relatively small genome (~15 kb), NDV does allow for the insertion of foreign genes. These can be inserted into non-coding regions without requiring the deletion of NDV viral genes, as demonstrated with GM-CSF expression 150 .

Further studies to evaluate both preexisting antiviral immunity and the induction of posttreatment immune responses against the viral vector and tumour-associated antigens will be important to better understand the dynamics of how oncolytic viruses are cleared and controlled in patients with cancer. Biosafety considerations. Oncolytic viruses have thus far been associated with a relatively tolerable safety profile in numerous clinical trials conducted across a wide range of cancers. Nonetheless, the replicative potential of these agents requires attention to infection control issues, including procedures for the safe storage, preparation, handling and administration of the virus. The true potential for infection depends on the nature of the virus and co-morbid conditions within patients, close household contacts and health-care workers who may be exposed to the virus. In addition, many oncolytic viruses contain recombinant DNA elements, and so the potential impact of such gene segments and the potential for their recombination with wild-type viruses in the environment are theoretical concerns.",

            "text": "In addition, oncolytic viruses represent a challenge with respect to subject eligibility, dosing and biodistribution assessment when designing clinical trials. As many clinical studies have utilized local delivery of the virus to patients, tumours must be accessible for injection. To date, virus dosing has typically been based on the maximum concentration of virus possible, with current purification techniques and the volume of tumour as determined before each virus administration. This can be quite cumbersome and few studies have adequately explored the association between virus dose, therapeutic response and occurrences of adverse events 142, 164, 165 . Nonetheless, because oncolytic viruses can replicate within tumour tissues, even small doses may result in significant clinical activity provided the virus is not rapidly cleared by the immune system. This was observed in clinical trials with oncolytic poliovirus and T-VEC 3 . Finally, individual assays to assess virus distribution are needed to evaluate the pharmacodynamics of virus delivery. Ideally, this should include data on the presence of the virus within targeted cells (for example, cancer cells), lack of viral replication in non-target cells, virus shedding within body fluids, evidence of latent infection, viral clearance, and virus-specific and tumour-specific humoral and cellular immune responses. Although many trials have made progress in establishing such assays, there is no standard agreement within the field on how to validate these correlative end points.",

            "text": "Several strategies for clinical assessment of oncolytic viruses in vivo have been developed. The most common methods for determining tissue uptake have used the expression of fluorescent dyes, such as green fluorescent protein (GFP) or luciferase, in the viral vector to quantitate viral transcription within infected cells 166 . This technique, however, is challenging in patients as it requires the inclusion of a foreign transgene with unknown clinical consequences, potential for immune recognition and difficulty in imaging fluorescent activity from deep tissue layers. By contrast, measles virus and HSV-1 have been engineered to express other proteins or enzymes that do not rely on fluorescence for in vivo monitoring. Measles virus has been engineered to encode the soluble extracellular domain of human CEA upstream of the nucleoprotein gene. This allows quantitative monitoring of viral gene expression through serial peripheral blood measurement of CEA levels 167 . Another interesting strategy utilized a measles virus expressing human thyroidal sodium iodide symporter (NIS) 168 . The NIS concentrates radioactive iodine, which can be monitored using single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) or positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. An HSV-1 encoding viral TK and a mutated dopamine D 2 receptor was used to trap radioactive tracers for monitoring virus location and replication ability 169 . In this system, viral TK phosphorylates injected radioactive 131 I-labelled 2\u0374-fluo ro-2\u0374-deoxy-1-beta-d-arabinofuranosyl-5-iodo-uracil (FIAU), which traps the radioactive signal within the cell 170 . The mutated dopamine D 2 receptor acts in a similar fashion by trapping a radioactive tracer that can be monitored using PET imaging. In addition to imaging, tumour biopsy procedures can be performed, when accessible and appropriate, to determine viral titres in target and nontarget tissues. Tumour biopsy samples can provide both functional data as well as information about the kinetics and propagation of the oncolytic virus. Collection of other body tissues, including blood, saliva and urine, may also provide indicators of viral replication and will be critical to ensure safety by determining the bioshedding dynamics of therapeutic oncolytic viruses.",

            "text": "Regulatory and commercialization issues. The live replicating nature of oncolytic viruses poses unique regulatory and manufacturing issues. Most viruses are propagated in tissue cultures and this requires methods for high-titre virus production, testing for adventitial pathogens, and assessment of virus purity and replication potential. Thus, procedures for laboratory safety during manufacturing and vialing, product validation and purity, and quality of design that results from generating biologics in cell culture must be considered. For some viruses it has been difficult to generate very high titre lysates required for clinical dosing, and this can be a challenge for biotechnology manufacturing. These aspects have been reviewed extensively elsewhere [171] [172] [173] . Viral vaccines have provided the templates for the manufacture and regulation of oncolytic viruses. The FDA has published a draft guidance document titled \"Guidance for Industry: Design and Analysis of Shedding Studies for Virus or Bacteria-Based Gene Therapy and Oncolytic Products\". Other relevant documents include the \"European Directorate for the Quality of Medicines including Cell substrates for the production of vaccines for human use\" (REF. 174) and \"Tests for extraneous agents in viral vaccines for human use\" (REF. 175 ). These provide guidelines for quality control testing of all materials and cells used in the generation of oncolytic viruses. Furthermore, intermediates and viral batches need to be tested for contamination and efficacy. However, removing contaminants, especially microbial or viral contaminants, proves to be more difficult for oncolytic viruses than for recombinant proteins because the methods used to remove these contaminants may also target the oncolytic virus. The quality of oncolytic virus preparation can be tested in control cells with a standard readout, in combination with a virus-specific neutralizing antibody to confirm that the effect is mediated by the virus. This approach has been adapted from the methods used to test human viral vaccines. This infrastructure should provide the additional framework needed for the widespread commercialization of oncolytic viruses for cancer therapy.",

The therapeutic efficacy of oncolytic viruses is determined by a combination of direct cancer cell lysis and indirect activation of anti-tumour immune responses. Upon infection with an oncolytic virus, cancer cells initiate an antiviral response that consists of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and genotoxic stress. This response leads to the upregulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the initiation of antiviral cytokine production. ROS and cytokines, specifically type I interferons (IFNs), are released from the infected cancer cell and stimulate immune cells (antigen presenting cells, CD8 + T cells, and natural killer (NK) cells). Subsequently, the oncolytic virus causes oncolysis, which releases viral progeny, pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), danger-associated molecular pattern signals (DAMPs), and tumour associated antigens (TAAs) including neo-antigens. The release of viral progeny propagates the infection with the oncolytic virus. The PAMPs (consisting of viral particles) and DAMPs (comprising host cell proteins) stimulate the immune system by triggering activating receptors such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs). In the context of the resulting immune-stimulatory environment, TAAs and neo-antigens are released and taken up by antigen presenting cells. Collectively, these events result in the generation of immune responses against virally infected cancer cells, as well as de novo immune responses against TAAs/neo-antigens displayed on un-infected cancer cells.

The expression of oncogenes and other aberrant host cell proteins in cancer cells can promote viral replication and oncolytic activity. a | In healthy cells, regulation of cell cycle entry and proliferation is provided by key factors, such as protein kinase R (PKR), p16, retinoblastoma (Rb), and the tumour suppressor p53. These elements promote abortive apoptosis when the cell cycle is dysregulated. PKR may also help to regulate transcription and induce abortive apoptosis when cells are infected with a virus. b | In cancer cells, cell cycle regulation and cellular proliferation are typically disrupted due to the activity of oncogenes and the loss of tumour suppressor genes. These changes can support viral replication and promote oncolytic virus-induced cell death. For example, activating mutations in the small GTPase RAS increase cell proliferation, which is accompanied by increased protein production. This process can be usurped by oncolytic viruses to replicate more efficiently, as reported for Newcastle disease virus (NDV) and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV). Furthermore, hyperactive RAS blocks PKR, a process that can facilitate the selective replication of oncolytic viruses (such as reovirus, herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), adenovirus, vaccinia virus and influenza virus), in RAS-mutant cancer cells. Some viruses, such as adenovirus, reovirus and parvovirus, preferentially target p53-mutant or p53-null cancer cells because healthy cells with intact p53 undergo abortive apoptosis upon infection. Likewise, aberrant expression of Rb and p16, which regulate cell cycle entry, can render cancer cells susceptible to oncolytic viruses such as adenovirus, HSV-1, vaccinia virus and reovirus. Cancer cells also frequently upregulate the anti-apoptotic protein B cell lymphoma-X L (BCL-X L ).",
