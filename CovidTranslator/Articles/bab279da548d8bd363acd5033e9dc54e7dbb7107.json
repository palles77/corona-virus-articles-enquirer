Both schoolchildren and their caregivers are expected to have a lower risk of infection after school closure by altering social mixing patterns. 2 Several empirical studies have confirmed the effects of school closure on reducing influenza virus transmission after immediate closure of schools at an early stage of a pandemic, including studies from Hong Kong, 3 France, 4 Germany, 5 eight European countries, 6 Canada 7 and USA. 8 However, the assessment of effects of school closure on influenza transmission remains challenging. Reactive school closure during an influenza pandemic was often accompanied by other control measures such as intensive screening, border control measures and improved sanitation, which may confound the assessment of effects of school closure on influenza incidence. To differentiate the effects of school closure from other accompanied interventions and changed health-seeking behaviour, some studies have evaluated the effects of school closure on influenza transmission by focusing on school breaks rather than reactive school closures. As school calendars are usually set at the beginning of each school term, observed changes of influenza incidence before, during and after school breaks are believed to be less confounded than school closures Strengths and limitations of this study \u25aa We assessed the impact of school breaks on influenza activity. \u25aa Age shift of influenza-like illness incidence from schoolchildren to adults during school breaks indicated a reduction of influenza transmission in schoolchildren. \u25aa Serfling-based Poisson model was built to adjust for unmeasured confounders. \u25aa Residual confounding such as population mobility, change of health-seeking behaviour may exist.",

ILI was defined as fever (temperature of 38\u00b0C or greater) and a cough and/or a sore throat in the absence of a known cause other than influenza. The ILI reporting system recorded weekly ILI cases into five age groups (0-4, 5-14, 15-24, 25-59 and 60 years or older). Beijing Children's Hospital, affiliated with Capital Medical University is one of the sentinel hospitals for ILI surveillance, and accounts for more than half of the total paediatric outpatient visits in Beijing.

Winter breaks were often in January and February, which lasts for 4 weeks and covered the 7-day statutory holidays for national Chinese New Year. Summer breaks are in July and August, which last for 7 weeks. The exact starting dates of winter/summer school breaks varied slightly across years and schools.

In this study, we used 25 years of age as the cut-off point for schoolchildren and adults, because the ILI surveillance system in Beijing reported weekly ILI numbers by age groups of 0-4, 5-14, 15-24, 25-59 and 60 years or older, without specific age for each case.

A vector of dummy variables for each year was considered and sinusoidal terms of weeks were added in the Poisson model to adjust for long-term and seasonal trends, respectively. As weekly adjacent ILI visits were temporally correlated, we further added an autocorrelated regression term to adjust for autocorrelation in the Poisson model. 13 Details of the model can be found in online supplementary appendix and tables S1-S2. Model fitting was evaluated by pseudo R 2 values. IRRs of during/after to before winter breaks were used to evaluate the change of ILI incidence before, during and after winter breaks in each age group. IRRs of during/after to before winter breaks smaller than 1 indicated that ILI visits during/after winter breaks were lower than those before winter breaks. We presented the estimates as weekly IRRs, which was calculated by dividing the weekly ILI incidence during/after winter breaks to an average of ILI incidence 2 weeks before winter breaks.

We found a significant reduction in ILI incidence rates for age group of 5-14 when entering winter breaks, compared with those of 2 weeks before (IRR 0.89, 95% CI (0.81 to 0.98)). However, the reduction is less significant when comparing with the rates throughout the entire break for the adults' groups. The phenomenon that reduction of ILI incidence rates for age above 60 was larger than those for age 25-59 and close to those for age [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] (table 2) could be due to age-specific health-seeking behaviour, immune system characteristics and residual confounders of seasonal ILI visits. Although a Serfling model has been adopted, our model is still relatively conservative in controlling seasonal pattern of ILI because timing of peaks of influenza activities had severe overlaps with timing of winter breaks, and the overfitting could underestimate the effect of winter breaks on decrease of IRRs. Therefore, additional analysis that considers high variability in the temporal relationship between winter breaks and weekly ILI rates across influenza seasons are needed and incorporating environmental factors or human behaviour data may better clarify the relationship between age-specific influenza activity and winter breaks.",

Furthermore, the economic cost of school breaks that is mainly due to absenteeism of working parents who have to stay home to take care of their children remains difficult to estimate. 24 Further analysis of the environmental or social factors influencing the transmission of seasonal and pandemic influenza is required in order to provide additional information for policymakers and public health officials to use when considering measures to control pandemic influenza.",
