            "text": "Reports describing severe allergic shock and fatality following treatment of a common cold or upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) with a Chinese herbal injection were collected. Our analysis of the risks associated with this treatment suggested that the potential risk of serious, or even lethal, anaphylaxis should preclude its use in treating common colds and URTIs. In light of our findings herein, we propose the following five suggestions for improving the clinical safety of delivering Chinese herbal injections as medical treatments. First, Chinese herbal injections should not be delivered in the clinic to treat patients in accordance with Bian zheng lun zhi (broad-spectrum application based on holistic Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) theory and methodology), but rather they should be administered to target specific indicated disease processes. Second, Chinese herbal injection indications should be based on the results of double-blind randomized controlled clinical trials. Third, Chinese herbal injections should be used only in cases involving severe disease or to rescue patients in critical condition; they should not be used to treat mild, relatively innocuous diseases, such as common colds and upper respiratory tract infections, given the risk of doing harm. Fourth, Chinese herbal injection formulas should include materials from only a single or a small number of plant sources in known quantities. Fifth, more studies examining the toxicology and allergenic potential of Chinese herbal injections are needed.",

The treatments were used to treat a wide variety of conditions, including cardio-cerebral vascular disease, respiratory disease, tumors, musculoskeletal disorders, and digestive system diseases (Liu et al., 2001; Tang, 2006; Tang et al., 2008) . However, this form of treatment is known to produce some serious adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in some patients, including anaphylactic shock and fatal anaphylaxis (CNARMC Bulletin.31 December, 2007) .",

            "text": "There has been a litany of poor outcomes in recent years following administration of Chinese herbal injections. Yuxingcao herbal injection (YHI), produced from a herbal extract of Houttuynia cordata, caused severe ADRs in four children, two of which were fatal, during the first half of 2006 (Ji et al., 2009) . In response to these tragedies, the SFDA halted YHI use in hospitals in June 2006. After reviewing the manufacturing conditions and quality control parameters for YHI, the SFDA allowed a limited number of manufacturers to resume production (Ji et al., 2009 ). On October 6, 2008, six patients suffered serious adverse reactions to Ciwujia herbal injection, produced from a herbal extract from Acanthopanax senticosus (Rupr.et Maxim.) Harms; the reactions were ultimately fatal in three of these patients (SFDA Bulletin. 7 Nov, 2008) . Less than 1 week later, on October 11, 2008, four neonatal infants suffered serious ADRs to Yinzhihuang herbal injections made by another Chinese pharmaceutical factory; one of the babies died at 9 days old as a result (HDHP Bulletin. 20 Oct, 2008) . This Yinzhihuang herbal injection was made from the extracts of four plants: Artemisia capillaris Thunb., Gardenia jasminoides Ellis, root of Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi, and flower of Flos lonicerae. Following the October 11 incidents, the SFDA called for a halt in the administration of these injections and retracted all remaining products from the marketplace. In February 2009, Shuanghuanglian herbal injections resulted in severe side effects in three patients and one death (SFDA Bulletin. 12 Feb, 2009a monitoring center (CNARMC) posted a bulletin in which it warned of the potential for severe ADRs to Qingkailing injection (SFDA Bulletin. 20 Apr, 2009b) . Qingkailing injection is a complex concoction made from extracts derived from four plant species (Fructus gardeniae, Radix isatidis, Radix scutellaria, and Flos lonicerae), a number of animal products, and several additives. More than a quarter of the people who died due to their ADRs to Qingkailing injection were children under 14 years of age (SFDA Bulletin. 20 Apr, 2009b) .",

Only cases involving patients who were diagnosed with a common cold or an URTI and treated with an herbal injection that resulted in severe non-lethal allergic shock (N = 129) or fatality (N = 21) were included in our analysis. A total of nine different types of herbal injections were described in these reports. Of the 150 patients who suffered severe anaphylactic reactions, 27 were children under the age of 12, and one was a pregnant woman. All 150 of these patients received emergency rescue treatments. Unfortunately, there were also 21 lethal cases, six of which involved children under 12 years of age (Table 1 ). Given that it is improbable that all cases of severe anaphylaxis have been reported, the anaphylactic problems associated with herbal injection treatments for colds and URTIs are likely underrepresented in the literature. This review analyzes the published reports in order to examine whether the use of herbal injections should be continued or considered contra-indicated in cases of the common cold or URTI.",

Hence, the Chinese herbal injection has characteristics that distinguish it from more traditional forms of TCM: they are distilled down to a more potent form and they are injected directly into the patient's system.

In practice, such broad and general descriptions have led clinicians to misuse the injections, and the misuse of Chinese herbal injections has resulted in serious ADRs.

Furthermore, the chemical structures and concentrations of bioactive components within the injections have not been accurately determined. These are nontrivial matters given that some herbal injections have numerous potentially bioactive components. For example, Qingkailing herbal injection is made from the extracts of four species of plants (Fructus gardeniae, Radix isatidis, Radix scutellaria, and Flos lonicerae) in combination with various animal products (cholic acid, hyodesoxycholic acid from pig bile, Concha margaritifera Usta powder extract, and Bubalus bubalis Linnaeus horn powder extract), and additives (i.e., disodium edetate, sodium subsulfite and glycerol). Furthermore, each of the plant ex-tracts themselves may contain a large number of chemical compounds. Elaborating upon our example of Qingkailing, Flos lonicerae extract alone contains chlorogenic acid, isochlorogenic acid, secologanin, sweroside, loganin, loganic acid, hederagenin, disacoside B, fulvotomentoside A, a-hederin, sapindoside B, macranthoidin A and B, macranthoside A and B, linalool, shuang-hua-chun, geraniol, a-terpineol, and eugenol among others.",

Meanwhile, Fructus gardeniae extract constituents include geniposide, gardenoside, shanzhiside, gardoside, geriposidic acid, gardenin, crocin-1, cro-cetin, scandoside and methyl ester . Given the complexity of these mixtures, even the so-called advanced Chinese medicine fingerprint technology cannot provide precise quantization or consistent batch-to-batch quality and component proportion control (Zeng et al., 2006) . Hence, while TCM decoctions and oral suspensions may include dozens of materials from animals and plants, we strongly suggest that the constituents of Chinese herbal injections should be restricted to only one or a few raw materials from plants. This limitation will facilitate quality control and should reduce the likelihood of ADRs, especially allergic reactions to plant and animal products.",

However, none of the evaluated reports described the exact mechanisms by which the herbal injections may have caused anaphylactic shock (Ji et al., 2009) . Whether this deficiency is due to inadequate efforts or to the complexity of the potential mechanisms is not known. Anaphylactic reactions could be due to innate inter-individual differences among patients or to contamination of the injections with allergenic substances, such as chlorogenic acid (Yang et al., 2007) .",

In addition, the safety of Chinese herbal injections would be improved if they were delivered as targeted treatments for indicated disease processes, if their constituent complexity and variability were reduced, and if controlled clinical trials as well as studies examining their toxicology and allergenic potential were conducted. We especially underscore careful application of herbal injections in clinics to avoid any misuse.",
