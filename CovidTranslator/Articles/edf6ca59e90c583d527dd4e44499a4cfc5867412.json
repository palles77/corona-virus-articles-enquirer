Viral and bacterial antigens for recombinant subunit vaccines have been produced in a variety of organisms. Transgenic plants are now recognized as legitimate sources for these proteins, especially in the developing area of oral vaccines, because antigens have been shown to be correctly processed in plants into forms that elicit immune responses when fed to animals or humans. Antigens expressed in maize (Zea mays) are particularly attractive since they can be deposited in the natural storage vessel, the corn seed, and can be conveniently delivered to any organism that consumes grain. We have previously demonstrated high level expression of the B-subunit of Escherichia coli heat-labile enterotoxin and the spike protein of swine transmissible gastroenteritis in corn, and have demonstrated that these antigens delivered in the seed elicit protective immune responses. Here we provide additional data to support the potency, efficacy, and stability of recombinant subunit vaccines delivered in maize seed. \uf6d9",

We further investigated the immunogenicity of [11] . This suggested that oral administration (feed-Lt-B transgenic corn by examining a defatted germ ing) of TGEV corn could result in generation of a fraction, in which the concentration of antigen is protective immune response. Therefore to test increased over whole kernels, and by delivering the whether administration of TGEV corn leads to antigen over a wider dose range, including very generation of virus neutralizing antibody, we exsmall doses. Mice were fed defatted Lt-B corn germ amined serum from piglets that had been fed TGEV meal or defatted wild type corn germ meal, and corn and then exposed to TGE whole virus. Piglets serum and fecal samples were collected and ana-were fed TGEV corn for 7 consecutive days followed lyzed. For all groups except the negative control by normal feed for 7 days, and then finally boosted (receiving wild-type corn germ meal) the serum IgG with a second 7-consecutive-day feeding of TGEV responses were evident after the first dose, or second corn. On day 29 piglets were exposed to an amount dose for the lowest dose level, and increased of TGE whole virus that would result in a subclinical throughout the study (Fig. 3A) . All mice within infection. Serum was collected over the experimental groups fed 3.3 and 33 mg of Lt-B and 8 / 10 mice time course and assayed for its ability to interfere of neutralizing antibody in serum from piglets that had previously eaten TGEV corn. Three out of the four animals in the TGEV corn-fed group responded with titers ranging from 512 to 2048 yielding a geometric mean titer of the four animal group of 768.5. This was in contrast to piglets that had eaten control corn meal prior to exposure to whole virus, which developed low levels of neutralizing antibody suggestive of a subclinical infection with the highest titer from any single animal in either of the control groups of only 64. Therefore, a clear memory response leading to elevated levels of neutralizing prior to challenge with virus on day 12 [11] . Piglets fed TGEV corn showed fewer overall symptoms of with TGE virus infection of a swine testicular cell infection as compared to those fed control corn or a line in vitro. Results of analysis of the neutralization modified live virus vaccine, but recovery of affected titers are shown in Fig. 4 . Although neutralizing piglets was slower in the TGEV corn fed group than antibodies were not detected in the serum of any of in the whole virus administered group. Since dose the piglets prior to virus exposure, administration of amount is a critical factor contributing to the protecwhole virus resulted in rapid induction of high levels tive potential of a vaccine, we examined several doses of TGEV corn for effectiveness at protecting piglets from a subsequent viral challenge. We compared the effect of feeding TGEV corn for 4, 8 or 16 consecutive days with administration of a commercial modified live TGEV vaccine for their ability to protect piglets from a viral challenge on day 18. A negative control group fed nontransgenic corn for 16 days was also included. The percent morbidity incidence shows that 50% of the piglets fed wild type corn developed TGE clinical symptoms (Fig.  5A ). In contrast, none of the piglets that received transgenic corn for 4 days exhibited symptoms. Interestingly, the 8-and 16-day feedings were less effective than the 4-day feeding of TGEV corn with 20 and 36%, respectively, showing symptoms. A total of 9% of the piglets receiving the commercial modified live vaccine still developed symptoms. The percent morbidity incidence and duration as well as the clinical severity index data ( Fig. 5B and C) further reflected the protection of the piglets by TGEV corn, with the greatest level of protection with 2 a 4-day administration. Analysis (x ) was performed using Yates correction for continuity in calculating the statistical test, which indicated that animals fed control corn had a significantly higher rate of morbidity incidence and duration (P,0.001) and severity of infection (P,0.001) compared to animals that received TGEV corn for 4 days. These significant differences were comparable to the differences observed between the control corn and the modified live virus (morbidity incidence and duration (P5 0.004) and severity of infection (P,0.001)). Taken together, these results indicate that feeding TGEV corn vaccine is effective at reducing, and under certain circumstances even eliminating, clinical disease symptoms associated with exposure to TGEV.",

Measurable serum and mucosal anti-Lt-B observed with a 0.33 mg dose of Lt-B contained in 0.7 mg corn germ meal demonstrates the utility of fractionation to enhance vaccine potency. To our knowledge, this is the lowest level of Lt-B expressed in plant material ever reported to show a measurable anti-Lt-B response. This effectiveness at eliciting a response to Lt-B is likely due to the natural bioencapsulation of plant-expressed antigens enhancing antigen survival in the gut [7, 9, 13, 20, 32 ].
