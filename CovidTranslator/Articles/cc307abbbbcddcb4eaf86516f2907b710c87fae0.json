            "text": "NEC is a disease that affects premature infants during their convalescence from other diseases of immaturity. 1, 9 It is unusual to see NEC during the acute phase of respiratory distress syndrome, hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (birth asphyxia), heart failure from a patent ductus arteriosus and other acute neonatal disease processes. 1, 12 Although NEC is noted predominantly in premature neonates, approximately 10% of cases occur in nearly full-term or full-term infants whose preceding risk factors have included polycythemia, cyanotic heart disease or heart disease producing low cardiac output (before or after surgery), chronic diarrhea, endocrine disorders (hypothyroidism, panhypopituitarism, congenital adrenal hyperplasia) or a prior anatomic obstructive gastrointestinal malformation (volvulus or gastroschisis). 1, 2, 13 NEC occurs predominantly in neonates after the onset of enteral alimentation, as 95% of affected infants have been fed for various amounts of time. 1, 12, 14 The condition usually develops during the first 2 weeks of life in relatively well neonates who have been fed enterally, but it may be delayed for 90 days in infants of very low birthweight given nothing by mouth for long periods. 1 NEC tends to develop later among infants whose birthweight was less than 1000 g. Thus, the more immature the infant at birth, the later the possible onset of NEC. Such findings suggest that immaturity of gastrointestinal function is a major risk factor. 1, 12, 14 Many case-control studies have suggested that immaturity is the only readily identifiable risk factor for the development of NEC. 1 Immature function of host defense, gastrointestinal motility, digestion, healing and mucosal integrity (permeability), and intestinal circulation may contribute to the pathogenesis of NEC (see below). 14, 15 The incidence of NEC varies among neonatal intensive care units, and some units have no cases. The overall incidence varies from 3% to 5% of all neonatal intensive care admissions. 1, 9 The incidence among very-low-birthweight (less than 1500 g) infants who survive long enough to be fed approaches 10-15%. The incidence is greatest among infants weighing between 500 and 750 g at birth (13-20%) ; it declines to approximately 1-3% among infants weighing more than 1750 g. 1, 4 The incidence is affected by periodic outbreaks or epidemics of NEC that become superimposed on an endemic case background. Because infants of 500-750 g at birth represent a very small proportion of infants in neonatal intensive care units (less than 2% of all births), the mean birthweight of infants affected with NEC is between 1350 and 1500 g and the mean gestational age is between 30 and 32 weeks.",

Most affected patients are considered 'gainers and growers' who, prior to the onset of NEC, had few if any manifestations of gastrointestinal dysfunction, and few apparent sequelae of the previous diseases of prematurity from which they had been recovering. 12 In many but not all instances, the affected pre-term infants had respiratory distress syndrome days to weeks before the onset of NEC. With the advent of surfactant therapy for respiratory distress syndrome, more infants may survive this disorder and are now at risk for NEC during their convalescence. 12 Because NEC is seen in premature infants, many factors associated with prematurity were thought to be risk factors for NEC. These were related to diseases, procedures or complications that may produce gastrointestinal ischemia, infection or altered digestion. Mucosal injury following a combination of these risk factors was thought to produce NEC. Ischemic risk factors included birth asphyxia, respiratory distress syndrome, hypoxia, hypotension, patent ductus arteriosus, polycythemia, anemia, umbilical artery, catheter placement and exchange transfusion. Because these risk factors were identified as part of a profile among affected infants, they were thought to contribute to the pathogenesis of NEC. Although each may contribute to mucosal injury, case-control studies suggest that these processes are equally prevalent among affected patients and unaffected controls. 1 Therefore, these risk factors merely describe the low-birthweight population and are no longer thought to be direct contributing factors in the pathogenesis of NEC (see below). Epidemiologic investigations emphasize that the predominant risk factor is prematurity, with associated immature host defense and gastrointestinal function.",

NEC often involves the terminal ileum, ileocecal area and ascending colon, and rarely only the rectal mucosa.

            "text": "Interestingly, reparative processes of both acute and chronic types are noted in over 50% of cases. 16 Such reparative changes include focal epithelial regeneration, granulation tissue formation and fibrosis. The latter two processes are usually noted in the mucosal and submucosal layers, but occasionally extend into the muscularis. Such fibrotic processes may later be associated with development of strictures in recovering infants. Early theories of the pathogenesis of NEC proposed a relationship between gastrointestinal ischemia, enteral alimentation and micro-organisms. 1 Although the precise contributions of these variables remain ill defined, a multifactorial pathogenesis involving these risk factors plus immature gastrointestinal function and immature host defense mechanisms seems possible for the initiation and subsequent propagation of NEC (Figs 43.2 and 43.3). 1, 12 Hypoxic-ischemic injury Potential alterations of mesenteric blood flow may occur at the large-vessel arterial level and may be associated with redistribution of systemic blood flow or may be within the gastrointestinal system itself with redistribution of local mucosal blood flow. 1, [20] [21] [22] [23] The possible systemic alterations may be associated with global hypoxia, asphyxia, exchange transfusion, arterial runoff lesions such as patent ductus arteriosus, shock or anemia. Local alterations of the mucosal circulation may be associated with less severe perturbations of these systemic factors plus those local changes occurring during enteral alimentation, polycythemia, intestinal distention or luminal exposure to bacterial toxins or inflammatory mediators. Potential events may be initiated during the prenatal period (cocaine exposure, placental insufficiency with intrauterine growth retardation) or may occur after birth. 20-23 Infants exposed to cocaine prenatally may be at higher risk for the development of NEC. Although they tend to have higher birthweights and greater gestational age than others at risk for NEC, these infants may develop NEC sooner and have fewer traditionally identifiable risk factors. Additional evidence linking prenatal intestinal ischemia and NEC among intrauterine growth-retarded infants may be demonstrated by absent or reversed diastolic blood flow detected by fetal Doppler ultrasonography. 23 The regulation of postnatal mesenteric blood flow is complex. Autoregulation of regional blood flow is determined by responses to luminal nutrients and autocrine effects of locally produced gut hormones. 1, 12 These effects may be modified by disease states, medications, the autonomic and central nervous systems, and systemic processes producing vasoconstriction or hypotensive reduction of local tissue blood flow.",

Malabsorbed carbohydrates contribute to enhanced intestinal bacterial gas production, resulting in abdominal distention. 1, 12, 14 High intraluminal pressure from gaseous distention may reduce mucosal blood flow, producing secondary intestinal ischemia. In addition, dissection of bacterial gas products from the intestinal lumen may produce pneumatosis intestinalis or, if gas enters the portal venous system, hepatic venous gas may be evident. Analysis of gas from the intestinal lumen and cysts of pneumatosis intestinalis reveals a profile typical of intestinal bacterial fermentation of malabsorbed carbohydrates (e.g. hydrogen, methane, carbon dioxide). 1 Earlier hypotheses had suggested that giving patients at risk nothing by mouth might reduce the incidence of NEC. Delayed feeding for asphyxiated infants or those with umbilical arterial or venous catheters and respiratory distress syndrome has not reduced the incidence of NEC. 1, 12, 14 In fact, delayed feeding may do more harm than good by increasing the risk of intestinal mucosal atrophy, cholestatic jaundice, osteopenia of prematurity and hyperalimentation-related complications. 14 Large-volume milk feedings, increased too rapidly during the feeding schedule, may place undue stress on a previously injured or immature intestine. Feeding increments in excess of 20-30 ml/kg per 24 h were associated with an increased risk of NEC in at least two studies. 12, 14 Two other studies have demonstrated the safety of 30-35 ml/kg per 24 h feeding increments. 26, 29 Such information should temper enthusiasm for excessively rapid feeding protocols for low-birthweight infants. It suggests that daily increments should be based on the clinical examination, evidence of feeding intolerance and a recommended volume increment of 20-35 ml/kg per 24 h.",

The suspicion of a transmissible agent is corroborated by the observation that epidemics abate following the institution or reinforcement of specific infectious disease-control measures (gowning, gloving, nurse cohorts and, especially, careful hand-washing). 1, 30 Epidemics have been associated with the recovery of no specific agent, or with the recovery of a single pathogen such as Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, Salmonella, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Clostridium butyricum, coronavirus, rotavirus and enteroviruses. 1, 31 An outbreak of NEC has been associated with Enterobacter sakazakii-contaminated powdered milk formula. 31 Additional evidence suggesting that NEC is due to an infectious agent includes the observation of related infantile diarrheal illnesses within a community or among personnel in the neonatal intensive care unit. 1 Furthermore, there are similarities between NEC (pathology, symptoms, immature susceptibility) and many enterotoxemias of young animals and humans. Such enteric toxin-mediated illnesses may be due to Clostridium, S. epidermidis or other toxin-producing enteric pathogens. [32] [33] [34] Alternatively, endotoxin production by the `normal' Gram-negative enteric flora during enteral alimentation may predispose the immature intestine to mucosal injury if endotoxin production exceeds elimination. 35 In addition transcytosis (crossing of epithelial cells by E. coli, etc.) could initiate this process; E. coli from patients with NEC has this capacity in animal models. 36 Endotoxin stimulates host inflammatory cells to produce various mediators such as tumor necrosis factor and platelet-activating factor. 35 Both of these and other inflammatory cytokines can initiate or propagate the pathologic process characterized by coagulation necrosis, inflammation, increased vascular permeability, edema, hemorrhage, local thrombosis and platelet consumption. Indeed, the immature enterocyte (epithelial cell) tends to react with excessive local production of proinflammatory cytokines when stimulated with endotoxin or interleukin 1\u03b2. The resulting cytokine mediator-induced thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, hypotensive-hypovolemic shock (third-space fluid losses), metabolic acidosis and hemorrhagic diarrhea are quite similar to the clinical manifestations of NEC in human neonates. 37 The blood culture is positive in 20-30% of patients with NEC. 1, 4 Reports of the responsible bacteremic pathogens before 1980 demonstrated a predominance of E. coli and Klebsiella. 1 Current reports of agents producing bacteremia in patients with NEC suggest that S. epidermidis is another common blood isolate. 4 It remains to be determined whether the organisms recovered in blood or peritoneal cultures are the primary pathogens or secondary invading organisms that gain access to the circulation or peritoneum through a compromised intestinal mucosa.",

Ancillary laboratory evaluations may reveal thrombocytopenia with or without evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation, anemia, neutropenia, metabolic acidosis from septic or hypovolemic shock, respiratory acidosis from increased intra-abdominal pressure and poor diaphragm excursion, increased breath hydrogen excretion, raised fecal calprotectin levels and radiographic signs of ileus, an isolated dilated intestinal loop or ascites. 1, 43 The differential diagnosis of NEC is outlined in Table 43 .2. Idiopathic, focal, spontaneous, isolated intestinal perforation is also a common cause of pneumoperitoneum in the pre-term and, less often, full-term neonate. The onset is usually sudden and occurs earlier in life than that of NEC. Prior feeding may not be present and pneumatosis intestinalis is absent. Affected patients usually have respiratory distress syndrome and a lower birthweight and gestational age than patients with NEC. The abdominal wall may appear blue, and radiography shows free air and a gasless abdomen. Overall survival is better than patients with NEC who develop pneumoperitoneum. 44, 45 PREVENTION NEC may not be completely eliminated, but certain interventions have been demonstrated to lower the incidence. Oral administration of an IgA-IgG preparation has been demonstrated to reduce the incidence of NEC; however, intravenous or oral administration of IgG has not affected the incidence. 46 Human milk significantly reduces the incidence of NEC among pre-term infants fed donor or their mother's milk. 14, 47 Prenatal administration of corticosteroids lowers the incidence of NEC. 48 Steroids enhance lung maturation and are thought to accelerate intestinal maturation, thus potentially reducing the 'immaturity' factor in the pathogenesis of NEC.

Significant abdominal distention may reduce the mesenteric arterial perfusion pressure, thus exacerbating a previously compromised intestinal blood flow. Models of the effects of increased intra-abdominal pressure have reported such adverse consequences as increased systemic vascular resistance, decreased cardiac output, decreased urine output and 'apparent' hypovolemia. 53, 54 Surgical decompression of increased intra-abdominal pressure in human adults restores systemic arterial oxygenation, cardiac output and urine production within 15 min of the procedure. 53 Increased intra-abdominal pressure in patients with NEC is due to the development of tense ascites, marked intestinal gas production, stasis (ileus) and inflammatory fluid exudation with hemorrhage into the lumen of the small and large intestines. It is imperative to reduce abdominal distention with nasogastric tube placement and no further formula feeding (NPO -nil per os). The decompression tube should be the largest that the patient can tolerate. Paracentesis with placement of an intra-abdominal drain under local anesthesia has been helpful in stage II or III disease. Finally, if the patient fails to respond to medical management or abdominal drain placement within 24-48 h of the onset of illness, exploratory laparotomy can result in abdominal decompression by removal of necrotic tissue and inflammatory exudate (Table 43. 3).",

Nonetheless, appropriate antimicrobial therapy must be directed against these bacteria, even when the bacteremia is due to bowel injury and secondary bacterial invasion. Patients with both NEC and bacteremia usually have more severe disease and a higher mortality rate. 1 Although the precise antibiotic regimen for the treatment of NEC has not been determined, the clinician must remain flexible, as there are changes in the pathogens recovered in patients with NEC, and each neonatal intensive care unit has different bacteria with different antimicrobial resistent patterns. 1, 4, 30, 50 This may reflect a bacterial shift in the fecal colonization of premature infants. Nonetheless, the changing pattern of the agents recovered during bacteremia requires close scrutiny and appropriate modification of antimicrobial therapy. Traditional antimicrobial treatment of NEC employs systemic administration of a semisynthetic penicillin (ampicillin, ticarcillin) and an aminoglycoside (gentamicin, kanamycin). Evidence suggests a beneficial response with the use of vancomycin and cefotaxime. 55 Many recommend anaerobic coverage with clindamycin or metronidazole. Vigilant attention to the microbiology of blood, fecal and peritoneal cultures in patients with NEC is needed for appropriate modification of antibiotic therapy (see Table 43 .1 for duration of antimicrobial therapy) 56,57 . Perforation with subsequent bacterial peritonitis is managed with abdominal drain placement or surgery. The treatment of severe NEC manifested as SIRS is not unlike that of other causes of bacteremia-associated hypotension. Endotoxin-stimulated production of inflammatory mediators such as bradykinin, tumor necrosis factor or platelet-activating factor results in increased vascular permeability, large transcapillary fluid loss, increased pulmonary artery pressure with hypoxia, lactic acidosis and hypotension. Hypermetabolism increases oxygen requirements. Once stabilized from the septic shock state, all patients require parenteral nutrition while NPO. Fluid losses plus the initial vasodilation increase water and electrolyte requirements. Despite rapid killing of bacteria by antibiotics, the diverse effects of bacterial products (endotoxin, etc.) are still evident. The net result is a markedly reduced cardiopulmonary ability to meet the oxygen requirements of the peripheral tissues. [58] [59] [60] The decreased cardiac output in septic shock (and NEC) may be due to pooling of blood and fluid in the capacitance peripheral vessels and loss of fluid in third spaces as well as a specific myocardial dysfunction characteristic of severe bacteremic states. The myocardial depression is not due to ischemia but rather to various mediators released as a response to inflammation and hypotension. Circulatory failure results in a flow-limited ability to provide the oxygen necessary to support energy metabolism (local tissue oxygen consumption). Circulatory failure causes tissue hypoxia and metabolic (lactic) acidosis. Some of the cellular defects of oxygen utilization may not be due to hypoxia-ischemia alone. Tumor necrosis factor produced during endotoxemia has various metabolic consequences that may interfere with mitochondrial oxygen utilization. 58 Methods used to treat septic shock must take into consideration the linear relationship between oxygen delivery and local tissue oxygen consumption. 58 This flow-dependent relationship can be improved by restoring the circulating blood volume (preload) with fluid resuscitation and by improving myocardial contractility with inotropic sympathomimetic agents.",
