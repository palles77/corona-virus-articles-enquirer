Chimeric VP1-GP33 VLPs were effectively processed in antigen presenting cells in vitro and in vivo and induced antigen-specific CD8+ T cell proliferation. Mice immunized only once with VP1-GP33 VLPs without adjuvant developed an effective GP33-specific memory T cell response: 70% were fully and 30% partially protected from LCMV infection. Moreover, aggressive growth of tumors expressing GP33 was significantly delayed in these mice in vivo. Therefore, HaPyV VP1-derived VLP harboring CTL epitopes are attractive vaccine candidates for the induction of insert-specific CTL immune response.",

In contrast to exogenous antigens, which usually are processed via MHC class II pathway, non-replicating antigens as VLP are able to enter the MHC class I pathway, the main pathway for CD8+ T cell activation, by cross-presentation (Keller et al., 2010; Storni and Bachmann, 2004; Storni et al., 2002) .

The antitumor protective capacity was investigated by time course measurement of tumor progression. The GP33-unspecific response against the MCA102 tumor in all 6 VP1-GP33 VLPs immunized mice (Fig. 4A) was very similar to the response in PBS-treated control mice: the tumor growth was progressive. MCA102-GP33 tumors in all 7 PBS-treated control mice (Fig. 4B ) and parental MCA102 tumors in all 6 mice immunized with VP1-GP33 VLPs (Fig. 4A ) reached the size of 50 mm 2 until day 12 (in VP1-GP33-1 VLPs-treated mice) or day 14 (in VP1-GP33-4 VLPs-treated mice) post tumor injection. In contrast, prophylactic immunization with VLPs partly protected mice from MCA102-GP33 tumor growth: only 1/7 VP1-GP33-4 VLP immunized mice, 0/7 VP1-GP33-1 VLP immunized mice and 3/7 mice immunized with empty carrier VP1 VLP compared to 7/7 control na\u00efve mice developed tumors of 50 mm 2 size until day 12 (Fig. 3B) . The vaccination of mice with chimeric VP1-GP33 VLPs had slightly stronger effect on tumors growth than the immunization with empty VP1 carrier. 10 days later (day 22) tumors in all 7/7 (100%) mice immunized with carrier VP1 VLP were bigger than 50 mm 2 and had reached 100 mm 2 size in 5/7 (71%) mice.

Nevertheless, they induced DC maturation and stimulated GP33-specific P14 mouse splenocytes in vitro as effectively as the GP33 peptide ( Fig. 2A  and B) . Moreover, VP1-GP33-4 VLP pulsed DCs were able to stimulate GP33 CD8+ T cells in vitro much more strongly than GP33 peptide-pulsed DCs or GP33 peptide without DCs (Fig. 2C) . These results clearly demonstrated that the GP33 CTL epitope inserted into HaPyV VP1 VLPs was efficiently processed and cross-presented by DCs like other non-replicating VLPs (Keller et al., 2010; Ruedl et al., 2002; Storni and Bachmann, 2004; Storni et al., 2002) .",

Furthermore, LCMV challenge and MCA102-GP33 tumor experiments allowed us to assess the ability of vaccinated mice to eliminate GP33 expressing cells and to address directly CD8+ T cell function in vivo. As it is known that LCMV infection in vivo is exclusively controlled by CD8+ T cells, an absence of virus elimination reflects an absence of cytotoxic T cell activity (Bachmann, 1997) . Immunization with chimeric VP1-GP33 VLPs without adjuvant induced protective immune response in mice: 7/10 (70%) mice were fully and 3/10 (30%) mice partially protected against LCMV challenge (Fig. 3B) suggesting effective insert-specific CD8+ T cell induction in vivo. Not all VLPs were able to stimulate effective and long lasting CTL response in vivo, especially without additional adjuvant (Ding et al., 2009; Lacasse et al., 2008; Martinez et al., 2003) . Interestingly, immunization with chimeric hepatitis B core Ag VLPs harboring LCMV GP33 peptide fully protected mice from LCMV challenge infection only when they were applied with CpG-rich DNA .",

            "text": "To show effective CTL immune response generated by VP1-GP33 VLPs, we also used the very aggressive MCA102-GP33 tumor model. In LCMV immune mice MCA102-GP33 tumor cells are fully rejected. However, LCMV therapy only temporarily eliminates this tumor and finally tumor escape variants appear (Blohm et al., 2002) . In mice vaccinated with chimeric VP1-GP33 VLPs and challenged with MCA102-GP33 tumor, tumor growth was delayed compared to mice injected with PBS which means that memory CD8+ CTLs were activated (Fig. 4B ). This capability of HaPyV VP1-based VLPs to induce effective CTL response in mice was supported also by a therapeutic effect against MCA102-GP33 tumor (Fig. 4C ). CD8+ T cells activated by VLPs were able to identify and eliminate not only inoculated tumor cell suspensions but also solid tumor cells under in vivo situations. However, the weaker antitumor effect induced by VLPs when compared with the LCMV-induced antitumor effect (Blohm et al., 2002) could be the result of IFN\u2425 production deficiency in splenocytes after stimulation with VLPs because it is known that IFN\u2425 seems to be the only effector molecule in MCA102 tumor model (Blohm et al., 2006) . Surprisingly, immunization with empty VP1 VLPs showed to some extent a protective antitumor effect. CD8+ T cell activation in vivo induced by empty VP1 VLPs was not as efficient as the activation observed for chimeric VP1-GP33 VLPs but clearly detectable. It might be possible that injection of the VP1 VLP induced in mice a non-specific activation of the immune system which in turn was responsible for an antitumor effect. However, it should be noted that VP1-G33 VLPs had a GP33-specific stimulatory effect on GP33-specific CD8+ T cells in vitro ( Fig. 2A and B) . Furthermore, prophylactic immunization with VLPs clearly delayed MCA102-GP33 tumor growth but had no effect on parental MCA102 tumor cell line growth in mice ( Fig. 4A and B) . Thus, it is more likely that VP1 VLPs induced activation of cross-reactive memory CD8+ T cells. It is known that only a few TCR contact residues on the peptide presented by MHC molecules are required for activation and a TCR of CD8+ T cell can tolerate certain amino acid substitutions in the peptide sequence. Therefore antigen specific CD8+ T memory cells can cross-react with different epitopes derived either from the same or a related antigen, or a totally unrelated one. Examples of crossreactive T-cell responses involving completely unrelated viruses such as LCMV and vaccinia virus (Kim et al., 2005) , influenza virus and HIV (Acierno et al., 2003) , human papilloma virus and coronavirus (Nilges et al., 2003) , have been reported.",
