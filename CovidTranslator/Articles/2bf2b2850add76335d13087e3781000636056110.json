            "text": "fast termination of PDE activation observed under similar conditions 20 . More recent work indicates that transducin GTPase can be faster under more physiologial conditions 11,21-23, but the mechanism of GTPase acceleration has remained unclear. The data of Fig. 1 show that PDE itself serves as a GTPase-activating factor. The maximal GTPase rate observed in this reconstitution study (-0.15 S-I) is still about lO-fold slower than the rate of the recovery from a photoresponse. But a more rapid rate (> 0.6 s -I) is observed in suspensions of disrupted rod outer segments l2 for the fast component of GTPase suppressed by micromolar concentrations of cGMP. Our study allows us to conclude that this faster GTPase is a property of that transducin which activates PDE, and thus the extent of PDE-dependent GTPase acceleration is higher in rod outer segment suspensions than in reconstituted membranes. More recent data (V. Y.A. et al., manuscript in preparation) shows that further concentration of rod outer segment suspensions (> 100 fLM rhodopsin) increases GTPase rates by at least twofold, close to the turn-off time of the photoresponse. The data shown in Fig. 2 indicate a feedback mechanism in retinal rods based on cGMP-dependent regulation of the lifetime of activated PDE. Such a mechanism might function during rod background adaptation, when the duration and light sensitivity of the photoresponse is diminished 24 ,25. A reasonable model is that background light depletes intracellular cGMP levels, causing dissociation of cGMP from the non-catalytic binding sites on PDE. This would accelerate the GTPase activity that terminates each PDE activation event, leading to a faster and/or smaller photoresponse. Such a mechanism might work in parallel with the known calcium feedback regulation of adaptation 4 \u2022 The regulation of GTP-binding protein GTPase activity by an effector described here, although not previously described for a heterotrimeric G protein, has been documented extensively for several other classes of GTP-binding proteins (for example ref. 26) . It is observed for elongation and initiation factors whose GTPase activity is enhanced by ribosomes. The class of small GTP-binding proteins including the product of proto-oncogene ras interact with GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) that may also be their effectors 27 . The intrinsic GTPase of the heterotrimeric signal-transducing G proteins is considerably more rapid than that of the small GTP-binding proteins (for example refs 5-7), but still in several systems such as photoreception 2 ,3, 0lfaction 28 and muscarinic receptor-induced potassium channel regulation 29 it has seemed to be too slow to explain the NATURE\u00b7 VOL 357 . 4 JUNE 1992 LETTERS TO NATURE rapid on-off cycle of the relevant effectors. Because acceleration has now been associated with the effector enzyme in the photoreceptor, it is relevant to search for similar mechanisms in other systems using heterotrimeric G proteins. 0 Aminopeptidase N is a major receptor for the enteropathogenic coronavirus TGEV acts as a receptor.

A full-length cDNA copy was . cloned and contained an open reading frame of 2,889 nucleotides encoding a polypeptide 79% identical to human aminopeptidase (data not shown). MDCK cell clones stably transformed with the porcine APN cDNA expressed a polypeptide of 150K which reacted with antibodies against aminopeptidase N (Fig. 4a) . The aminopeptidase activitl of the transfected clones was about 40-fold higher compared with non-transfected clones. On viral challenge, all of the three independent clones tested seemed to be fairly susceptible to TGEV infection, as proved by extensive destruction of the infected monolayers and synthesis of the viral structural polypeptides (Fig. 4b, c) . Earlier incubation with an antibody specific for aminopeptidase N prevented the appearance of viral cytopathic effect. These results show that aminopeptidase N was the only porcine protein necessary to confer susceptibility on canine kidney cells naturally resistant to TGEV.

Human aminopeptidase N is identical to CDB, a surface antigen of many myeloid cells 14 , It is a zinc-binding protease that catalyses the removal of N-terminal, preferentially neutral residues from peptides, It is expressed in many tissues at different levels 15 , the highest activity being found in the small intestinal mucosa, where the aminopeptidase represents about 8% of the protein content of the apical membrane of the differentiated enterocytes, and in the kidney brush border. It is also expressed to a lesser extent in liver, lung and colon, where the virus does replicate, but without causing the specific histopathological damage seen in the small intestine 16 \u2022 In the intestine, the distibution of the receptor and the site of multiplication of TGEV are thus strikingly correlated. This argues for a pivotal role of aminopeptidase N/CD13 in determining the tissue tropism of TGEV, Investigating the nature of the virus interaction with aminopeptidase N could provide a rationale for the design of an antiviral strategy against TGEV and related infections. To develop a monoclonal antibody against the HCV-229E receptor, we produced hybridomas against deoxycholatesolubilized membrane proteins of two HCV-229E-susceptible human cell lines (WI38 lung fibroblasts and HL60 myeloid leukaemia cells).

HCV-229E-resistant murine fibroblasts became susceptible after transfection with complementary DNA encoding human aminopeptidase N. By contrast, infection of human cells with HCV-OC43 was not inhibited by antibody RBS and expression of aminopeptidase N did not enhance HCV-OC43 replication in mouse cells. A mutant aminopeptidase lacking the catalytic site of the enzyme did not bind HCV-229E or RBS and did not render murine cells susceptible to HCV-229E infection, suggesting that the virus-binding site may lie at or near the active site of the human aminopeptidase molecule.",
