Other biological agents, such as Yersinia pestis, the causative agent of pneumonic plague, are highly infectious; hence the risk to the public can spread far beyond the original site of dissemination (9) . Physical harm aside, the psychological impact of bioterrorism is enormous (5, 10) . This is understandable given that human history is peppered with descriptions of disease epidemics that have killed millions of people (e.g., [11] [12] [13] [14] ; plague and smallpox are probably the most notable of all epidemiccausing agents. Not surprisingly, these organisms feature high on government lists of potential biological agents that could be used for acts of bioterrorism (e.g., 15,16, Table 37 .1). History also shows that the conduct of acts of bioterrorism and biocrime is not limited to extremist groups and international terrorist organizations but can equally be perpetrated by disgruntled nationals (17) . Indeed, the anthrax attacks in the United States in 2001 are examples of how a trusted insider was likely responsible for terrorist acts (18) .",

The program spans all aspects of forensic operations from sample collection to the interpretation of results from the laboratory. In this respect the program is multilayered. The AFP has a general capability across all forensic disciplines to conduct investigations and examinations in chemical and biological (CB) contaminated environments. This capability extends to all AFP personnel required to enter a scene that may contain hazardous substances. This practice is applied in a manner in which all hazards are considered-chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and explosives (CBRNE). With that said, the AFP requires the assistance of personnel from the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organization (ANSTO) and the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency (ARPANSA) to conduct investigations and examinations in environments containing radiological and nuclear (RN) hazards and to examine evidence that contains RN hazards. Crime scene personnel and laboratory staff are trained to enter CB contaminated environments in various levels of personal protective equipment to process exhibits and scenes, collect appropriate evidence, and document accordingly. AFP scientists regularly exercise with personnel from other emergency agencies, such as the fire brigade and ambulance, and from ANSTO and ARPANSA to coordinate efforts at the scene and ensure that the scene is processed logically and thoroughly in a manner that will best collect pertinent evidence and thus can withstand strict legal scrutiny. Exhibit packaging, decontamination of packaged exhibits, chain of custody, and exhibit transport, receipt, security, and storage are protocols that are all well established. Where possible these are identical to or closely follow existing practices. This is important, as in a multiagency response situation, procedures are more likely to be followed when they are already normal, embedded best practice. Where the decontamination of exhibits is required prior to laboratory examination, the AFP seeks expertise from other ABLN laboratories that have relevant experience with the decontamination of exhibits.",

This approach provides a higher degree of certainty of identification early in the processing of a scene, thereby allowing scene examiners to process the scene in accordance with the type of agent present. This analytical capability is housed primarily within a mobile laboratory, which can be deployed to a scene or used on base. The detection capabilities used within the Mobilab are also deployable separately.

In comparison, public health laboratories are accredited under the NATA medical testing program, and other laboratories involved in microbiological analysis of forensic evidence are accredited under the NATA veterinary testing or biological testing programs. Some of these laboratories have included the NATA forensic science module to assist with the provision of chain of custody procedures and court testimony capability. Most AFP forensic capabilities have a fundamental need to be mobile. AFP forensic operations provide support to all AFP operational areas, including those in the Australian Capital Territory, the major Australian airports, embassies and consulates within Australia, most Australian embassies, and the Christmas, Cocos, and Norfolk Islands. The AFP also provides police and forensic assistance to countries in southeast Asia, Australasia, and the Pacific. Until recently, forensic services have largely been provided through the deployment of portable detection and analysis equipment, which have been set up in temporary laboratories at, or near, the site of an incident. In 2006 the AFP commissioned a mobile forensic laboratory to complement deployable capability. The ultimate aim of the mobile laboratory is to provide a safe, secure, and clean laboratory that can be deployed by road, rail, or air virtually anywhere in the world.",

With that said, it is also suitably equipped to assist the forensic investigation of other incidents that are chemical in nature, such as those that involve illicit drugs, toxic industrial chemicals, explosives, and accelerants and those that require the analysis of environmental samples. Further, the Mobilab can be equipped according to requirement and hence can enhance the deployment capability of most forensic disciplines.",

Compartments are accessed from the outside by external airtight doors and between compartments with an internal air-tight door. The laboratory is powered through two shore power connections or two onboard diesel generators. Water is supplied via a town water connection through a standard hose fitting or an onboard 110-liter water tank. An identical tank holds waste water for decontamination prior to disposal. Both cabins are fitted with recycled air conditioning units, and an air management system provides the capability to establish air pressure gradients between the compartments and the compartments and the external atmosphere. Variable speed intake and exhaust fans, fitted with high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters, make it possible to create negative or positive atmospheric pressures in each compartment. Positive pressure differentials are created to minimize contamination of the cabins from environmental contaminants. This is useful during investigations such as those for trace levels of explosives and is particularly useful during transport on roads where dust is a problem. Negative pressure differentials are used to contain contaminants within the laboratory. In this manner, PC3 (i.e., BSL3) laboratory-level atmospheric pressure gradients are created for the analysis of samples from possible biological incidents. In this application the rear compartment is used as the PC3 laboratory and the forward cabin is treated as the antechamber.",

The ERTL is a stand-alone laboratory, which, as the name suggests, is used as a triage for exhibits being received into the main forensic laboratory. Triaging may be performed if it is suspected that exhibits contain, or are contaminated with, trace levels of CBRNE. This minimizes the risk of contamination of the main laboratory, ensuring that routine forensic investigations are not disrupted by investigations of this nature. The ERTL is a PC2 laboratory that in the event of a biological incident can be ramped up to mimic a PC3 laboratory level of containment. The ERTL houses a large Class 3 biological safety cabinet in the same format as that in the Mobilab (Figure 37.7) , two large Class 2 biological safety cabinets, and a large fume hood that can accommodate four scientists simultaneously (Figure 37.8) . Fume hood exhaust is passed through two HEPA filters and a charcoal filter prior to release into the atmosphere. When the fume hood is running, the atmospheric pressure within the ERTL is The Australian Federal Police Mobile and Triage Laboratories strongly negative, which assists with the containment of potentially hazardous materials. The ERTL is also used when exhibits require analysis by scientists from a number of disciplines. The simultaneous examination of complex exhibits by multiple scientists is more efficient than consecutive examinations and also provides a forum through which plans can be developed to maximize the recovery of evidence. A third important use of the ERTL is as a surge capacity laboratory. Utilization of the ERTL for investigations that require the processing of large numbers of exhibits allows examinations to be conducted with less impact on the normal operation of the main laboratory.",

Part 3 of the National Health Security Act 2007 (28) introduces a national regulatory scheme for biological agents of security concern. The list of SSBAs regulated under this legislation is shown in Table 37 .1. Agents on the list are derived from the Council of Australian Governments (COAG) Report on the Regulation and Control of Biological Agents, from which the COAG biological agents list was developed in 2006 (29) . In the process of developing the list, nearly 200 biological agents were considered. The review included an assessment of terrorist interest, availability of the agent, ease of production, ease of dissemination for threat, morbidity/ mortality of the agent, transmissibility of the agent, and difficulty to treat for consequence (30) . The list was divided into two tiers-tier 1 agents, which pose the highest security risk to Australia, and tier 2 agents, which pose a high security risk. The regulatory scheme was implemented by the Australian Department of Health and Aging in January 2009 for tier 1 agents and January 2010 for tier 2 agents. An important component of the regulatory scheme is the national register of Australian entities handling SSBAs. The scheme also provides an instrument through which the government can evaluate whether entities have legitimate purpose to handle SSBAs. If approved, entities must comply with the act's regulations and relevant standards, and all entities that handle SSBAs, temporarily or otherwise, must abide by the mandatory reporting requirements.",

            "text": "In developing the capability of the AFP to respond to bioterrorism, it was important for it to be appropriate to the threat and to recognize the existing roles and responsibilities of other agencies. The first responders to most incidents in Australia are the hazard response agencies, usually within fire services. Following the U.S. terrorism incidents in 2001, Emergency Management Australia, the commonwealth government agency tasked with coordinating government responses to emergency events, rolled out off-the-shelf capabilities to such agencies to conduct presumptive field testing of potential biomaterials. In the event of a positive presumptive test, a sample(s) would then go to a laboratory within the Australian health network for confirmatory testing. The policing agencies are primarily responsible for the forensic investigation. In this respect, the AFP approach differs from that followed by most other Australian policing agencies. In broad terms, the AFP fills an important forensic role that sits between the hazard response agency and the health agency but to some extent is overlapping. In this role, the AFP aims to add value to the equation but not replicate. Hence, the AFP has invested in evaluating available field equipment with a view to adding value through these being used by a microbiologist with forensic training or crime scene operatives with appropriate training. It is the view of the AFP that where an incident warrants it, this forensic intervention can play an important role in reducing disruption to normal activities. As such incidents can be in significant transport hubs, the benefit of quick action is obvious. Further, early identification of the biological agent provides a sound basis from which protective strategies can be implemented to minimize risk to personnel and from which appropriate sampling strategies can be formulated. Development of the Mobilab and associated triage center (ERTL) is aimed at balancing the need to sample the potentially active agent while protecting staff and the community from contamination but also protecting potential broader forensic evidence that may be vital in subsequent investigation. The latter is just as important in dealing with hoaxes. Of course, this approach will only be successful if roles are understood and the role of the crime scene officers and forensic microbiologist is fully recognized and incorporated into the whole of agency response plans. It is our view that, in much of the world, this broader role for forensic personnel is still immature or not well recognized. The focus of the AFP forensic response is to continue to improve field testing to provide as full an answer as possible and as quickly as possible, while recognizing the gold standard for identification remains culture.",

A fundamental awareness has been installed across all AFP portfolios. Further, most AFP forensic disciplines have the capability to extend routine examinations to biologically contaminated scenes and exhibits. The safety of AFP personnel is an important consideration behind all AFP activities; hence the implementation of strategies to minimize risk is paramount. This includes ongoing training to maintain skills and knowledge in the use of personal protective equipment and handheld detectors for entry into potentially contaminated sites. It is also one of the primary reasons for establishment of a capacity to detect and identify biological agents at the scene. Early identification of the biological agent provides a sound basis from which protective strategies can be implemented to minimize risk and a sound basis from which strategies can be developed to maximize the evidence gathered from the scene. It also ensures that strategies can be implemented to minimize the risk of loss or contamination of biological evidence. This is particularly important given that the maintenance of the viability of biological agents is often vital for confirmatory identification and subsequent detailed physical, biochemical, metabolic, and genetic analyses.",

A small refrigerator/freezer is located under the bench and is maintained by a bank of onboard batteries when generator power or shore power is not available. Gas lines for helium, hydrogen, nitrogen, and air span the walls of the forward compartment, all of which are plumbed into gas cylinders housed in a cylinder cupboard mounted on the drawbar of the trailer. The only instrument that is mounted permanently within the Mobilab is the combination gas chromatograph, mass spectrometer, and dual flame photometric detector for sulfur and phosphorous (GC-MS/DFPD) (Figure 37.4), which is used for the analysis of organic chemicals, including chemical warfare agents. Other equipment is imported as required.The Mobilab has been accredited by NATA under ISO/IEC 17025:2005 as a static and mobile forensic testing laboratory. The Mobilab is also a member of the recently created Chemical Warfare Analysis Laboratory Network (CWALN). This allows the laboratory to provide presumptive-level identification of chemical warfare agents. Laboratory facilities, ventilation, protocols, and work practices are compliant with the Australian Standard AS/NZS 2243.3:2002 for a PC2 laboratory as a minimum. The laboratory can be deployed within an hour of notification and is fully operational within 2 hours of arrival; this includes cleaning, setting up, initializing, and quality checking of instruments and background checks for contamination. Laboratory procedures are tailored and practiced to return results to investigators within 60-90 minutes of",
