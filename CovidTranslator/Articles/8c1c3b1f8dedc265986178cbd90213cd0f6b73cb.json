We first determined that RSV infection activates PKR which induces the phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1, resulting in the formation of host stress granules. We used RNA interference to decrease endogenous PKR levels. RSV replication was not altered in cells deficient for PKR expression. However, RSV-mediated stress granule formation was significantly reduced in PKR-knockdown cells. As an alternative method to block PKR activation, we used treatment with the kinase inhibitor 2-aminopurine (2-AP). We observed that 2-AP treatment significantly reduced viral replication. We also treated PKR-knockdown cells with 2-AP and inoculated with RSV. Under these conditions, 2-AP treatment diminished viral replication in the absence of PKR expression. These results suggest that PKR activation has a minimal effect on RSV replication and that the antiviral effect of 2-AP during RSV infection likely occurs via a PKR-independent mechanism.",

            "text": "Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection is a leading cause of serious viral lower respiratory tract illness in both infants and the elderly worldwide. RSV is a member of the Paramyxoviridae family and belongs to the Pneumovirinae subfamily. The RSV genome consists of a single-stranded, negative-sense RNA molecule that encodes 11 proteins. The viral nucleoprotein (N), phosphoprotein (P), and the large polymerase protein (L) make up the ribonucleoprotein complex that is necessary for viral transcription and replication. Each of these replication complex proteins is found, along with genomic viral RNA, in discrete cytoplasmic granules often termed viral inclusion bodies (Garcia et al., 1993; Carromeu et al., 2007; Lindquist et al., 2010) . These inclusion bodies are thought to represent sites of viral replication. While transcription of viral proteins likely occurs immediately after entry into host cells, detectable replication of the viral genome appears to begin several hours after inoculation. Following accumulation of sufficient amounts of viral proteins, a transition occurs in the RSV replication program from one dominated by transcription of viral genes to one in which replication of the full-length genome predominates. As is the case for all negative-sense single-stranded RNA viruses, for replication to occur, the virus must first make a full-length antigenome intermediate RNA, which then serves as template for the production of new RNA genomes (Cowton et al., 2006) . PKR is activated by double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) during viral infection and often is associated with antiviral host cell responses. Upon binding to dsRNA, PKR dimerizes and is autophosphorylated, resulting in activation of the protein. Phosphorylated PKR is one of the four known kinases that regulates the activation of the translation initiation factor eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2\u03b1), which also include PKR-like ER-localized eIF2\u03b1 kinase (PERK), heme-regulated inhibitor (HRI) kinase, and general control nonrepressed 2 (GCN2) kinase. Upon binding to eIF2\u03b1, activated PKR phosphorylates eIF2\u03b1 at serine 51. Phosphorylated eIF2\u03b1 is incapable of delivering initiator Met-tRNA to host translation complexes, resulting in a reduction of protein synthesis in virus-infected cells. eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation also leads to the formation of host stress granules, which are host RNA cytoplasmic granules that contain mRNA, translation factors, and mRNA-binding proteins. In addition to activating eIF2\u03b1, PKR also functions in the activation of other proteins such as STAT1, p53, and NF\u03baB (Garcia et al., 2007) .",

            "text": "Many viruses deploy mechanisms to prevent PKR activation, presumably to inhibit the type I interferon response or to ensure that the host translation machinery remains sufficiently active for viral protein synthesis. Viral strategies to prevent PKR activation include expression of viral products that interact directly with PKR and prevent activation, expression of viral proteins that bind and sequester dsRNA, or activation of host proteins that inhibit or counteract PKR activation (Garcia et al., 2007) . In virtually every case studied to date, the activation of PKR in virus-infected cells is associated with induction of an antiviral state. However, activation of PKR during hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection may enhance viral replication because of the resulting lack of synthesis of specific antiviral interferon-stimulated gene products during infection (Garaigorta and Chisari, 2009) .",

PKR and eIF2\u03b1 are phosphorylated during RSV infection. (A) HEp-2 cells were infected with RSV (MOI = 1.0 pfu/cell) for the indicated times, fixed, and processed for immunofluorescence. Anti-RSV P monoclonal antibody was used to localize viral protein and appears green in the merge panel. Anti-TIA-1 antibody was used to detect stress granule formation and appears red in the merge panel. Phosphorylated eIF2\u03b1 (peIF2\u03b1) appears blue in the merge panel. (B) HEp-2 cells were mock-inoculated or inoculated with RSV (MOI = 1.0 pfu/cell) for 24 h. Cell lysates were analyzed by immunoblots for GAPDH, RSV P, phosphorylated PKR, or total PKR. Relative protein densities comparing RSV-infected cells to mock-infected cells were quantified using Li-Cor Odyssey imaging software. RSV initiates this process. Typically, stress granules form following induction of one of many types of stress-related pathways that result in a common downstream event, phosphorylation of the translation initiation factor, eIF2\u03b1 (Kedersha and Anderson, 2007) . Therefore, we examined cells inoculated with RSV (MOI = 1.0 pfu/cell) for the presence of phosphorylated eIF2\u03b1 using indirect immunofluorescence. We observed a striking increase in eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation beginning 12 h post-inoculation that was concomitant with the appearance of stress granules and continued throughout infection (Fig. 1A) .",

We then examined cells for the presence of stress granules using indirect immunofluorescence (Fig. 3A) . In wildtype and shRNA non-targeting cells, we observed robust stress granule formation in infected cells. However, in PKR-knockdown cells, stress granule formation was substantially diminished. We quantified the number of RSV-infected cells that formed stress granules for each cell type. Our results show that while approximately 25-30% of infected wild-type and shRNA non-targeting cells form stress granules, stress granules form in only 2% of infected PKRknockdown cells (Fig. 3B ). When each cell type was treated with sodium arsenite, a drug that induces stress granules via HRI kinase rather than PKR, we observed an equivalent frequency of stress granule formation (data not shown). These results confirm that PKR is required for stress granule formation following RSV infection.",

The nucleotide analog 2-AP prevents PKR activation (Hu and Conway, 1993) . We first tested whether 2-AP treatment alters RSV-mediated PKR activation. HEp-2 epithelial cells were pretreated with 10 mM 2-AP or vehicle for 2 h. We then inoculated cells with RSV (MOI = 1.0 pfu/cell) in the presence of 2-AP or vehicle control for 1 h. The inoculum was removed and replaced with medium containing 2-AP or vehicle, and the infection was allowed to proceed for 24 h. Cell lysates were harvested for immunoblotting to assess the level of total or phosphorylated PKR. The phosphorylation of PKR in RSV-infected cells treated with 2-AP was greatly reduced in comparison to vehicletreated cells (Fig. 4A ). In addition, we did not observe an increase in total PKR levels in the presence of 2-AP that occurs during RSV infection following virus inoculation. As a control, we compared 2-APtreated and vehicle-treated cells in the absence of infection and found no changes in the levels of PKR or phosphorylated PKR. These results indicate that 2-AP inhibits PKR activation during RSV infection. We next assessed the effect of 2-AP treatment on viral protein expression using an immunoblotting assay for RSV P protein as a surrogate marker. Relative amounts of total PKR, phosphorylated PKR, RSV P, and GAPDH were quantified using Odyssey imaging analysis software. Interestingly, we observed a 70% decrease in the amount of RSV P protein in 2-AP-treated cells in comparison to vehicle-treated cells. This result suggests that treatment with 2-AP inhibits viral protein synthesis.",

These results suggest that 2-AP does not affect viral entry but rather a later step in the viral life cycle. To determine whether the effects of 2-AP treatment on RSV were virus-specific, we performed a similar experiment using reovirus. Reovirus replication is unaffected by PKR knockdown (Zhang and Samuel, 2007) . In addition, the reovirus \u03c33 protein inhibits PKR activation by competitively binding dsRNA targets (Sherry, 2009) . In contrast to our results with RSV, 2-AP treatment only affected reovirus replication during the first 24 h after infection. After 24 h, we did not observe a significant difference in viral titers between 2-AP-treated or vehicle-treated cells, indicating that 2-AP treatment is much less inhibitory for reovirus replication in comparison to the effect on RSV (Fig. 5B ).",

            "text": "Our results are unexpected for two main reasons. First, PKR initiates a cascade of events resulting in phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 and stress granule formation. These events are associated with stalled translation initiation complexes, which might be expected to diminish the capacity of host cells to support viral replication. Second, induction of PKR is often associated with an antiviral state. For example, both vesicular stomatitis virus and influenza virus replicate to higher titers in PKR\u2212/\u2212 mice in comparison to wild-type mice (Balachandran et al., 2000) . Similarly, PKR\u2212/\u2212 mice succumb to infection at a higher frequency when infected with Bunyamwera virus in comparison to wild-type mice (Streitenfeld et al., 2003) . However, there are cases, in which PKR has a minimal effect on viral replication. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus replication is Cell lysates were analyzed by immunoblots for GAPDH, RSV P, phosphorylated PKR, or total PKR. Relative protein densities were quantified using Li-Cor Odyssey imaging software. The relative amount of RSV P protein expression was quantified for cells infected with RSV and treated with either vehicle or 2-AP. Protein levels were standardized to RSVinfected and vehicle-treated cells. The relative expression of PKR and phosphorylated PKR were quantified for each condition and compared to that of mock-infected cells treated with vehicle. (B) HEp-2 cells were pretreated with 2-AP or vehicle, inoculated with RSV (MOI = 1.0 pfu/cell) for 24 h in the presence of 2-AP or vehicle, and processed for immunofluorescence. Anti-RSV F antibody was used to detect virus-infected cells. Differential interference contrast (DIC) was used to define the periphery of each cell. (C) The percentage of cells per HPF that stained positively for RSV F protein in images from (B) was determined. Error bars indicate SEM. unaffected in cells treated with phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers specific for PKR mRNA (Krahling et al., 2009) . Similarly, treatment of cells with PKR siRNAs has little effect on adenovirus or reovirus replication (Zhang and Samuel, 2007) or rotavirus protein synthesis (Rojas et al., 2010) . Rift Valley fever virus replication is not altered in PKR\u2212/\u2212 mouse embryo fibroblast cells (Habjan et al., 2009 ). However, PKR effects are not always antagonistic to viral infection. Knockdown of PKR by shRNA results in significantly decreased HCV RNA levels in cells treated with exogenous interferon and infected with HCV (Garaigorta and Chisari, 2009) . Interestingly, levels of other proteins involved in the antiviral response are increased, suggesting that HCV induces PKR activation to inhibit host translation and prevent the expression of interferon-stimulated genes. We predicted a similar function for PKR during RSV infection since previous reports have demonstrated that 2-AP treatment leads to a dose-dependent increase in IFN-\u03b1 production in RSV-infected cells (Hornung et al., 2004) .",

Other studies have reported that RSV induces robust PKR activation during infection, but eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation is limited (Groskreutz et al., 2010) . Phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 may have been dampened by increased activity of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) during infection.

Since phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 frequently precedes stress granule formation (Kedersha and Anderson, 2007) , our results are not surprising given the extensive stress granule formation induced by RSV (Lindquist et al., 2010) .

In the current study, we found that RSV replication is unaffected in PKR-knockdown cells that similarly are deficient for stress granule formation. One possible explanation for this discrepancy is that knockdown of G3BP has effects in addition to inhibiting stress granule formation. Thus, viral replication might be inhibited by an alternative effect of the G3BP knockdown. Another possibility is that in PKR-knockdown cells, PKR signaling does not occur, preventing the activation of intrinsic antiviral responses to the virus. Thus, the potential pro-viral function for which stress granules may normally be required would not be necessary, allowing the virus to replicate efficiently.",

            "text": "The drug 2-AP has been cited as a specific inhibitor of PKR activation (Hu and Conway, 1993; Loving et al., 2006; Silva et al., 2004) and used in a number of studies examining the role of PKR during viral infection. However, 2-AP also may inhibit activation of tumor suppressor p53 during genotoxic stress (Huang et al., 2003) , interfere with cell cycle progression (Andreassen and Margolis, 1994) , and inhibit mitogen-activated protein kinase activation (Thorburn et al., 1994) . Although PKR activation has been implicated in each of these processes (Garcia et al., 2006) , it is possible that 2-AP inhibits multiple kinases. Our results demonstrate that while 2-AP is efficient at blocking PKR activation during RSV infection, its inhibitory effect on RSV replication is PKRindependent. Therefore, the reliability of 2-AP as a PKR-specific inhibitor is suspect, given that the drug mediates non-PKRdependent effects. Defining the other targets of 2-AP might lend insight into the complex perturbations that occur in host gene function during RSV infection. Cell lysates were subjected to immunoblotting for RSV P protein and GAPDH. The relative amount of RSV P protein was quantified for each cell type and compared to that in wild-type cells treated with vehicle. Error bars indicate standard deviations.",
