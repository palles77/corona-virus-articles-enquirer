            "text": "and infertility (SMEDI) in pigs (PPV). Bocaviruses (BoV) are a recently described group of DNA viruses; members are characterised based on their genetic homology to bovine parvovirus and canine minute virus. BoVs were first described in humans (3) and have also been detected in canine, feline, and porcine hosts (4) . They are a genetically diverse group, distinct from the other members of Parvovirinae as they contain three major open reading frame (ORFs), coding for four genes (NS1, NP1, and VP1/2) (5, 6) . The presence of ORF3 is a near exclusive trait of bocavirus species (shared with PPV4), coding for NP1 protein, which is essential in viral propagation (7, 8) . PBoV was first detected by Blomstr\u00f6 m et al. (9) , in piglets suffering from post-weaning multi-systemic failure with porcine circovirus 2 (PCV2) aetiology. There have been many studies to characterise this group of viruses in pigs, and, to date, five putative species of PBoV species have been described, but classification of these isolates is poorly defined (10) . The ninth ICTV report (International Committee of Taxonomy of Viruses) defined a new bocavirus species as any isolate with less than 95% identity in non-structural gene sequences (11) . However, with the surge of sequence data for this virus family, classification of isolates has become confused. For consistency, PBoV isolates will be discussed as the groups as outlined by Yang et al. and Xiao et al. (10, 12) , throughout this report. In addition, recently proposed rationalisation and extension of the taxonomy of the family Parvoviridae (www.ictv online.org/virusTaxonomy.asp) is also used (13) .",

            "text": "The pathogenicity of PBoV remains unclear, with viral isolates being detected in both diseased and healthy animals (14\u00c116). In addition, viral DNA can be detected in a range of tissues, including lymph nodes (17) , serum (18) , lung (19) , saliva (20) , and faecal matter (21) . Furthermore, PBoV can be found in a high percentage of mixed infections leading to the question as to whether it is a true pathogen or opportunistic in nature, requiring activation through co-infection (12, 22\u00c124) . Most studies have used molecular techniques to detect and characterise PBoV (17\u00c119, 21, 25\u00c127), while some limited progress has been made using cell culture and immunological techniques for group 3 PBoV (28, 29) . Other gastroenteritis viruses such as group A rotavirus (RVA), porcine adenovirus (PAdV), and PCV are economically important viruses. PCV and PAdV have been associated with gastroenteritis, respiratory disease, or post-weaning multi-systemic wasting (PWMS) in piglets. RVA in pigs is attributed to severe gastrointestinal disease and accounts for 89% of diarrhoea in commercial pig farms (30, 31) ; in addition RVA in pigs has been recognised to be both enzootic and epizootic, and many of the human RVA gene segments share a common origin with porcine RVA (32, 33) .",

Group 1 and 3 PBoV form distinct monophyletic groups, in comparison to group 2 PBoV, which forms a paraphyletic group within a large monophyly, including other animal and human bocaviruses. Group 2 PBoV 5 were more related to other animal BoV than to HBoV. Subgroups for group 3 PBoV have been proposed in previous publications (10, 12) , but, depending on the gene being investigated, these subgroups do not consistently cluster together. Phylogenies for other viruses were also determined; Figure 3 indicates that the PCV1 isolated in this study is closely related to the Hungarian wild boar isolate WB-H-8, although the corresponding bootstrap value does not support this relationship (B70%). Figure 4 reveals that PAdV from this study is related to PAdV 3, similar to the reference strain IAF and wild-type isolates from Spain. Two RVA isolates were sequenced to determine the G and P types, these isolates were genotyped as G5P [13] and G9P [6] (Figs. 5 and 6 ). Phylogenetic analysis revealed greater genetic diversity of G5P [13] than in the G9P [6] strain. For G9P [6] , the VP7 gene tree shows that G9 has a strong relationship with the Irish porcine RVA from a previous study; clustering within lineage VI, the VP4 gene tree indicates that P [6] is similar to other porcine and human strains within lineage I. For G5P [13] , the tree shows more marked genetic diversity within the VP7 gene tree, G5 clusters within lineage I, a different lineage to previously described Irish isolates, and P [13] also displays greater diversity to previously isolated Irish strains.",

In other animals, there is increasing evidence that BoV is a true pathogen found in respiratory and gastrointestinal disease cases, but the pathology is still unknown (18, 20, 42, 43) . In this study, 48% of PBoVpositive specimens contained more than one group of PBoV, while 48% were positive for other viruses. The most commonly detected additional virus was AdV (48%), followed by PCV and RVA, which were each detected in 4% of PBoV-positive specimens. A mosaic plot representing the frequency of mixed infections including RVA, PAdV, group 2 or 3 PBoV was constructed (Fig. 1) , Pearson residuals suggest that there is a strong correlation between PBoV and PAdV, but further large-scale investigations are necessary to confirm this relationship. As only a subset of the total number of specimens were examined individually using PCR/RT-PCR, these figures are not completely representative but are indicative of the wide diversity of gastrointestinal viruses detected in the samples.",

Members of genus parvovirus have been suggested to have mutation rates similar to that of RNA viruses (44, 45) ; in addition, BoV have been noted to undergo a high incidence of genetic recombination (5, 21) . Considering these factors, a B95% homology value was too low for accurate identification of new species. Recent release of ICTV guidelines stipulate new Parvoviridae species are identified by B85% homology of the NS1 gene. In addition, the nomenclature of taxonomic groups has also been changed and this has also been incorporated in this manuscript. Typically, three major monophyletic groups can be identified as outlined in previous reports 10, 12); group 1 contains isolates from species 1, including original isolate Swebo; group 2 consists mainly of species 2 isolates, and group 3 contains species 3\u00c15; in addition, group 3 contains viruses from the same species that do not cluster together.",

Group 2 PBoV, however, is part of a large monophyletic group which contains other animal and human BoV; in addition, PBoV in this group are more closely related to other animal BoV than to HBoV (Fig. 2) . In general, Irish isolates cluster together with isolates previously described globally, displaying a high degree of diversity. For group 1 PBoV, only one isolate was sequenced; as seen from previous studies, there is very low genetic diversity in this group. CIT-B1.61 has 98.4\u00c199.8% sequence identity to other isolates in group 1 PBoV. Group identity to each other; overall, isolates within this group share 87.8\u00c196% identity. There was greater diversity observed in group 3 PBoV in comparison. Irish strains share 73.3\u00c183.3% sequence identity; overall, group 3 PBoV has 73\u00c198.5% identity to global isolates within this group. Group 3 PBoV has been previously described in Northern Ireland (28) and isolates CIT-B3.98 and CIT-B3.57 appear to be more closely related to these isolates; isolate CIT-B3.98 has 95.4% identity to the Irish isolate 64-1 (Accession no. JF512472), while CIT-B3.57 has 82.2% identity to isolate F41 (Accession no. JF512473).",

There is ongoing debate as to whether BoV is a true pathogen or a passenger in which co-infection is required for replication (12, 22, 23) . The original report of PBoV (group 1) was in the presence of piglets that died from PWMS, with PCV2 aetiology (9). Our study describes PCV1 with group 3 PBoV (CIT-20). Although PCV1 is not considered pathogenic, there is some limited data which suggest that PCV1 may have potential to cause disease (46) . RVA and PBoV have been reported previously in an investigation into co-infection and porcine diarrhoeal disease (24) , but the isolates were not genotyped. In our study, one specimen (CIT-43) was positive for both RVA (G9P [6] ) and group 3 PBoV. RVA isolated from this study was for the most part similar to isolates previously isolated from Ireland (Figs. 5 and 6) Lynda Gunn et al. (47) , except for isolate CIT-53, which is the first report of lineage 1 G5 rotavirus in Ireland. To our knowledge, this is the first report of group 1 and group 2 PBoV in Ireland; additionally, PBoV in the presence PAdV. The majority of PBoV and PAdV 3 co-infections were with group 3 PBoV (44%). The issue of diarrhoeal coinfections in pigs has been investigated previously by Zhang et al. (24) , who reported that 75.1% of clinically diseased animals had co-infections with up to four pathogens. In our study, PBoV was isolated from asymptomatic animals, which has also been noted in previous studies (14\u00c116).",

A clear understanding of viral diversity is still hampered by the fact that enteric viruses are not included routinely in the diagnostic tests of porcine enteritis, and the information is limited. It is likely that porcine enteritis has a multi-factorial nature, with viruses and other micro-organisms acting in synergy, yet under the influence of other factors, such as environmental and social stress due to overcrowding and/or incorrect management.",
