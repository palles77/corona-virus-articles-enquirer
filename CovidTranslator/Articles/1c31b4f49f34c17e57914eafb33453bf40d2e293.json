            "text": "Globalization of health is the growth of international transfer of diseases and cooperation in combating societal conditions that create diseases and their effects on nations and the global community. The concern over communicable diseases goes back throughout history to epidemics and pandemics that cost countless lives. Global health includes cancers and other non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and conditions fostered by lifestyle, poor nutrition, and harmful personal habits, as well as adverse social conditions such as poverty and insecurity. International cooperation is essential to address disease threats and health conditions common to many countries in the world. Globalization of health includes the rapid movement of large numbers of people, foods, drugs, vaccines, medical education, and technology from place to place. It recognizes that health and economic development are interlinked, and that social equity in health is essential to achieve the newly reiterated goals of Health for All. In addition, many new factors including rapid mass travel, global communication, and entertainment promote broadening of the effect of communicable diseases and common risk factors leading to epidemics of chronic diseases. Transportation, colonization, and commerce have been responsible for the dissemination of disease throughout history. With rapid movement of large numbers of people by sailing ships, steamships, rail, and later air, the possibility of disease transmission by travelers has increasingly become a global public health problem.",

The globalization process has intensified since the 1990s with the removal of barriers to international trade and foreign direct investments. At the same time, a combination of economic, technological, environmental, social, cultural, and political forces came into play which increased the commonality of global health concerns and promoted shared attempts to address global warming, poverty, ill-health, and inequities. Globalization has a complex influence on health, both negative and positive. The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) constitute an attempt by the United Nations (UN) to address global inequities of poverty, maternal and child health, communicable and other diseases, environmental degradation, and other markers of an increasingly interactive world (Box 16.1).",

There is a dynamic interaction and interdependence so that a global approach is essential to achieve health targets, even locally. Without restating arguments elaborated throughout the text, current and future generations of public health professionals must be well aware of what is occurring outside their communities and countries. This means not only learning from the news media of outbreaks of exotic diseases, but also recognizing that the political, social, and economic upheavals that define everyday existence, across the street or halfway around the world, affect us all. Even the most remote communities in the world are not immune to the global impacts of distant military coups, civil wars, natural disasters, economic crises, or epidemics. In the spring of 2013, a new avian influenza virus, H7N9, appeared in China, with 131 cases and 36 deaths to the end of May 2013. Over 75 percent of the victims probably contracted the virus from poultry or in markets selling live chickens. Some caught the virus from family members, although no one seems to have been infected by breathing the same air as an infected person (Zhu et al., 2013) . A new coronavirus, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), appeared in 2013 in Saudi Arabia and other countries of the Middle East, as well as among travelers from other countries including France and the UK. MERS-CoV causes severe respiratory illness with high mortality rates and may be transmitted from person to person, with 90 cases with 50 percent case fatality reported as of June 2013. Each of these two new threats raises the possibility of a wide epidemic or pandemic. Either",

This inequality is not only between countries, but within even developed and much more so in the rapidly developing countries, with middle and upper classes living with luxuries and a comfortable lifestyle. Globalization has a complex influence on health. Some components of globalization such as trade liberalization and technology transfer could increase efficiency, welfare, and health. However, under the existing barriers to the international markets, the weaker countries need help to address the stagnation preventing them from improving their market position, thereby increasing wealth and health of the population. Financial aid alone can have destructive effects by creation of dependency and misuse of resources through corruption and promotion of military primacy use of funds, while fundamental poverty and health issues are not a high priority on national agendas.",

The gain in African life expectancy from 1990 to 2011 is estimated to be 6 years (from 50 to 56), some 14 years lower than the global rate and 20 years below life expectancy in the Americas and European Region. For the Americas, the gain from 1990 to 2011 was 5 years (from 71 to 76); for the European Region 4 years (from 72 to 76); South-East Asia 8 years (from 59 to 67); and the Western Pacific 6 years (from 70 to 76) (Table 16 .1). Life expectancy at age 60 shows much smaller differences between the regions and slower rates of improvement. expectancy at birth for boys and girls gained 5 years in both the low-income developing and middle-income countries gained 5 years' life expectancy (from 52 to 57 and from 63 to 68, respectively), upper middle-income countries gained 3 years (from 68 to 71), and high-income countries gained 4 years (from 76 to 80). Between socioeconomic regions, life expectancy varies more widely. In 2011, life expectancy at birth ranged from 55 years in sub-Saharan Africa to over 80 years in industrialized countries. In the European Region, average life expectancy for men varies widely from west to east; for men in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) it is 65 years compared with 79 years in Western Europe. Most of the excess mortality in the CIS was due to cardiovascular disease (CVD) related to high rates of coronary heart disease, strokes, binge drinking, diet, and smoking, and a further 20 percent due to trauma (see Chapter 13). The differences are due to many factors, including quality of water supply and sanitation, housing, education, nutrition, lifestyle, family planning measures, and effective public health measures such as immunizations against infectious diseases and access to health services. Life expectancy has increased in the developed world but also in the low-mortality developing countries. Countries such as China and India have shown great improvements in underfives' mortality in the past 50 years, in contrast to most African countries. The under-five child mortality rate in India declined from 118 in 1990 to 66 per 1000 population in 2009; in China during the same period the mortality rate for this group declined from 46 to 19 (UNICEF, 2010) . Countries now considered developed had in the past disease patterns similar to developing countries today. It should be noted that infant and maternal mortality rates in many developing countries today are similar to those in the USA in the 1920s (Table 16. 2). Furthermore, within industrialized countries, there are social, ethnic, or immigrant groups whose current health status is characteristic of developing countries. In many developing countries, the rising middle-class populations show epidemiological patterns similar to those in developed countries, such as rising rates of heart disease.",

The third target (MDG3), devoted to equality, has been achieved. For MDG2, increased enrollment of boys and girls in primary school has reached 90 percent in developing countries, so this target is also being reached. Box 16.2 indicates 1. Promoting development -During the past decade, health has been recognized as a key driver of socioeconomic progress, and more resources than ever are being invested in health. Yet poverty continues to contribute to poor health, and poor health keeps large populations in poverty. Health development is directed by the ethical principle of equity: access to life-saving or health-promoting interventions should not be denied for economic or social reasons. Activities are aimed at health development with priority to health outcomes in poor and disadvantaged countries or vulnerable groups. The Millennium Development Goals addressing poverty reduction and other programs preventing and treating chronic diseases, and the neglected tropical diseases are cornerstones of the health and development agenda. 2. Fostering health security -Great threats to international health security arise from outbreaks of emerging and epidemic-prone diseases. These are occurring in increasing numbers, fueled by rapid transportation, urbanization, environmental mismanagement, the way food is produced and traded, and the way antibiotics are used and misused. Shared vulnerability to health security threats demands joint action to collectively defend against outbreaks. Collective security is crucial to identify and control potential pandemics. This was strengthened by newly revised International Health Regulations (2007) , and absorption of lessons learned from the HIV, SARS, and subsequent pandemics. 3. Strengthening health systems -For health improvement to help reduce poverty, health services must reach poor and underserved populations, especially those in neglected rural and urban slums. Health systems in many parts of the world are unable to do this, so strengthening of health systems is a high priority. This includes addressing the provision of adequate numbers of appropriately trained staff, sufficient financing, suitable systems for collecting vital statistics, with access to appropriate technology and essential drugs, with priority on local primary care. 4. Harnessing research, information, and evidence -Evidence and awareness of \"best practices\" provides the foundation for setting priorities, policies, defining strategies, and measuring results. WHO generates authoritative health information, in consultation with leading experts, to set norms and standards, articulate evidence-based policy options, and monitor the evolving global health situation. 5. Enhancing partnerships -WHO works with the support and collaboration of many partners, including UN agencies and other international organizations, donors, civil society and the private sectors. The role of donors in advancing health in developing countries must encourage national governments to increase their allocation and commitment to health as a priority. WHO uses the strategic power of evidence to encourage partners implementing programs within countries to align their activities with best technical guidelines and practices, as well as with the priorities established by member countries. 6. Improving performance -WHO participates in reforms to improve its efficiency and effectiveness, both at the international level and within countries. WHO aims to enhance its work in a motivating and rewarding environment at country, regional and global levels. current WHO thinking on the agenda for the post-MDG period, i.e., after 2015.",

Every year, approximately 9 million women suffer some form of injury from pregnancy or childbirth which has lasting effects on their health.

The global maternal mortality ratio in 2008 was 260 per 100,000 live births. There was wide variation among WHO regions and by level of GDP per capita country grouping. Maternal mortality ratios for the regions were: Africa 620, South-East Asia 240, Eastern Mediterranean 320, Western Pacific 51, and the Americas 66 per 100,000 live births.

Increased prevention and control measures have led to a reduction in malaria mortality rates by more than 25 percent globally since 2000 and by 33 percent in the WHO African Region. Factors include the increasing availability of bed nets impregnated with insecticide, indoor spraying with insecticide, greater awareness of the importance of vector control, and improving diagnostic procedures. However, resistance to currently available drugs is a worrying factor in malariology and the long hoped-for vaccine still remains an unfulfilled dream. Genetic modification of mosquitoes to prevent their transmission of the parasite, and biological methods of vector control by larvaeating bacteria are promising but still not game changers in malaria control.",

If TB is detected early and fully treated, people with the disease quickly become non-infectious and are eventually cured. Most are treated with directly observed therapy, short course (DOTS), which has been highly effective in completion of treatment that is needed even after symptoms recede. In 2011, an estimated 5.8 million new cases of TB occurred; there were 1.4 million deaths, including half a million HIV-associated TB deaths. TB is a global phenomenon but is mainly restricted to poor countries where it has been increasing, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, and is compounded by the additional problem of multidrug-resistant organisms. Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) and extremely drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB), HIV-associated TB, and weak health systems are major challenges. TB is high on the agenda of the MDGs, with the goal to reduce the burden of TB, and the target to reduce by half TB deaths and prevalence by 2015 has been achieved with the help of international donor agencies and national governments. New cases of TB have been falling since 2006 and fell at a rate of 2.2 percent in 2011.",

China, with a GNP per capita of US$410 in 1993 rising to US$4940 in 2011, has succeeded in attaining the infant mortality and life expectancy rates of mid-level developing countries by bringing primary care to the vast rural population. Sri Lanka, with a per capita GNP of US$498 in 1993 rising to US$2580 in 2011, has an infant mortality rate of 15 per 1000, comparable to well-advanced developing countries. The Indian state of Kerala is well above Indian national standards in HDI, even though economically poorer than the national average. On the other hand, some countries with high per capita GNP have lower HDIs; for example, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia have large GNP per capita but fewer public health achievements than much poorer countries such as Cuba, Costa Rica, and Jamaica. In some countries, this may be due to the large economic gap between the small, very wealthy ruling class and the large, poor population.",

Asiatic cholera arrived in Europe in 1832 and spread throughout the continent in repeated epidemics during the nineteenth century. This led to a convening of the International Sanitation Conference in Paris in 1851, with follow-up meetings held in 1874, 1881, and 1885. These conferences were held more frequently between 1892 and 1903 regarding maritime quarantine and control of international transmission of cholera, yellow fever, and typhus.

During the latter part of the twentieth century, many industrialized countries developed health reforms that included reduction in hospital bed supply, financial incentives to promote development of community-based services, and a combination of decentralized management and integration of services in those countries with national health services (e.g., the UK). Control of oversupply and excess utilization of hospital beds is also a feature of reforms for cost containment.

During this period, it was estimated that half of the hemophiliacs in the USA were infected with HIV through this route, and an untold number of hemophiliacs were infected worldwide. In some countries, such as Japan, this was probably the primary route of transmission into the population. By the end of the 1990s, there were 400 commercial centers for plasmapheresis operating in the USA. These centers, which employ paid donors, provided 60 percent of the worldwide requirement for plasma. By mid-1982 the possible link between AIDS and the blood supply was reported and became widely known and accepted even though AIDS was seen as primarily a sexually transmitted disease of gay men. In the following year the occurrence of cases in hemophiliacs living in geographically dispersed areas led to epidemiological investigations which identified contaminated blood as the source of infection. The blood factor industry used pooled serum largely from paid donors who were often from groups with high exposure to HIV, such as homosexual men. Self-exclusion was relied on for screening because of fear of potential lawsuits for discrimination by excluding high-risk donors, and the voluntary sector failed to stop blood collection in high-risk areas.",

Such achievements can only be made with major efforts in international commitment and cooperation, working with international and national agencies, donor organizations, and ultimately with the people themselves.",

Therefore, food safety monitoring remains an ongoing problem for the international agricultural and public health authorities, especially as marketdriven agricultural forces become an increasingly important part of world trade, with growing populations and increasing economic power in rapidly developing economies. Traditionally, governmental subsidies on the production of meat, dairy products, and sugar have led to their increased consumption. At the same time, such subsidies penalize fruit and vegetable production and consumption to the health detriment of populations owing to their cost or limited supply. This adversely affects vulnerable groups in the population both within countries and globally. High intakes of fat and sugar with low consumption of fruits and vegetables are associated with obesity, hypertension, stroke, and early coronary heart disease. Domestic and international policies to reduce beef and other saturated fat consumption while increasing fruit and vegetable consumption are vital to a",

In a \"business as usual\" scenario where intervention efforts remain static and rates of NCDs continue to increase, yearly loss to the economy is equivalent to approximately 4 percent of these countries' current annual output. On a per-person basis, the annual losses amount to an average of US$25 in low-income countries, US$50 in lower middle-income countries and US$139 in upper middle-income countries. A World Health Organization study indicates that the price tag for scaled-up implementation of a core set of NCD \"best buy\" intervention strategies is comparatively low.

In both Pakistan and Afghanistan, polio field workers have been murdered by Islamic terrorists who oppose immunization, which has made continued immunization and eradication efforts in those endemic countries problematic. However, polio eradication is within sight with the sustained efforts of the donors and national governments, as well as international organizations such as the WHO, UNICEF, UNDP, GAVI, Rotary International, and the Gates Foundation.",

In 2013, MERS-CoV emerged in Saudi Arabia with 90 cases and 45 fatalities (case fatality rate of 50 percent) in what seems to be animal-to-human transmission and subsequent closecontact human-to-human transmission, with the reservoir likely to be the horseshoe bat (CDC, 25 July 2013) . This virus has similarities to the coronavirus which caused the SARS pandemic of 2003, from which the global health community learned many lessons and has adopted measures to take those lessons into account. MERS-CoV could become a problem associated with the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca in 2013.",

Interventions to reduce poverty and poor nutrition, along with development of health systems that address social inequalities and human behavior, are the major challenges facing countries at all levels of development. These are no less complex and no less important than recognizing the resurgence of infectious diseases, as well as multidrug-resistant and non-communicable diseases, all of which are serious public health problems.

Political priorities in resource allocation are crucial to support for health protection, nutritional security, universal health coverage, and societal commitment to reducing economic gaps in terms of relative and absolute poverty. Global organizations for health and the private sector donors are vital to achieving the current MDGs (by 2015). The global efforts to achieve the MDGs, even if only partly successful, show that political action can achieve major results; although not uniformly and satisfactorily in all countries, many have done well.

It is not a privilege reserved for those with power, money, or social standing. l Health is more than the absence of disease, but includes prevention of illness, development of individual potential, and a positive sense of physical, mental, and social well-being. l Health care should be based on dialogue and collaboration among citizens, professionals, communities, and policy makers. l Health services should emphasize equity, accessibility, community, participation, prevention, and sustainability. l Health begins with healthy development of the child and a positive family environment. Health must be sustained by the active role of men and women in health and development. The role of women and their rights must be recognized, respected, and promoted. l Health care for the elderly should preserve dignity, respect, and concern for quality of life, and not merely extend life. l Health requires a sustainable environment with balanced human population growth and preservation of cultural diversity. l Health depends on more than access to health care. It depends on healthy living conditions and the availability to all people of basic essentials: food, safe water, housing, education, productive employment, protection from pollution, and prevention of social alienation. l Health depends on protection from exploitation and discrimination on account of race, religion, political belief, ethnic group, national origin, gender, sexual preference, or economic or social status.
