Wing and joint material was positive by real-time PCR for a poxvirus with low genomic G + C content (7) . The elbow joint of 1 bat was then processed for poxvirus growth in cell culture. The specimen was emulsified in 500 mL of sterile phosphate-buffered saline by using a tissue grinder. Viral nucleic acid was extracted by using EZ1 Advanced XL (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA, USA). Ten microliters of homogenate was added to 1 mL of RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum, l-glutamine, and penicillin/streptomycin. Growth medium from a T25 flask containing green monkey kidney epithelial cells (BSC40) was removed and the virus mixture added. The flask was incubated for 1 hour at 56\u00b0C, after which 6 mL of RPMI 1640 medium was added to each flask. Cells and supernatant were harvested after 95% of the monolayer was infected. Negative stain electron microscopy was performed by using cell culture supernatant. Two microliters of supernatant was pipetted onto a 300-mesh formvar-carbon-coated nickel grid. After a 10-min incubation, supernatant was blotted and the grid was rinsed. A negative stain composed of 5% ammonium molybdate, pH 6.9, and 0.1% trehalose (wt/vol) was briefly applied to the grid and blotted. The grid contents were visualized by using a Tecnai BioTwin electron microscope (FEI Company, Hillsboro, OR, USA) operating at 120 kV. Digital images were captured by using a 2K \u00b4 2K camera (Advanced Microscopy Techniques). Poxvirus particles were identified in cell culture supernatant ( Figure 1, panel B) .",

In such cases, variola virus particles were detected in joint fluid (9) , and vaccinia virus was isolated from a bone biopsy specimen of an affected limb (10, 11) . It is unclear whether the manifestation of arthritis in bats is a normal or rare result of the infection, or a new development in the evolution of the virus. Likewise, the frequency of poxvirus infection in big brown bats is impossible to estimate at this stage. Because the public is generally cautioned against handling downed bats because of possible rabies infection, underestimation of prevalence is likely. Infectious disease surveys of bats might have missed the infection up to this point because no obvious lesions are apparent on the skin, and swollen joints might have been classified as being arthritis without suspicion of infectious disease involvement.",

No evidence of poxviruses was found in the animals investigated in those studies. The zoonotic potential or host range of the virus described herein is not known, but at a minimum, the virus could pose a newly emergent threat to bat populations. Likewise, it is not clear if the infection seen in bats is a result of spillover or possibly an introduction of the virus into a new area. The isolate does not group with any of the 8 characterized genera of Chordopoxvirus; its nearest neighbor is Cotia virus, an as yet unclassified chordopoxvirus first isolated from sentinel suckling mice in a state reserve in Cotia County, S\u00e3o Paulo State, Brazil, in 1961 (15) .",

We propose that the bat-derived isolate be distinguished as part of a new lineage with the suggested genus designation Chiropoxvirus. Further efforts should be undertaken to determine whether Cotia virus should be included in this genus. The bat-derived virus requires a new species designation for which we propose Eptesipox virus because of its isolation from an Eptesicus fuscus bat specimen.",
