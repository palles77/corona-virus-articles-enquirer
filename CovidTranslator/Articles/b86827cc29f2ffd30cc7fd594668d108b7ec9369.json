            "text": "Over the last several years a wealth of transformative human-virus interaction discoveries have been produced using loss-of-function functional genomics. These insights have greatly expanded our understanding of how human pathogenic viruses exploit our cells to replicate. Two technologies have been at the forefront of this genetic revolution, RNA interference (RNAi) and random retroviral insertional mutagenesis using haploid cell lines (haploid cell screening), with the former technology largely predominating. Now the cutting edge gene editing of the CRISPR/Cas9 system has also been harnessed for large-scale functional genomics and is poised to possibly displace these earlier methods. Here we compare and contrast these three screening approaches for elucidating host-virus interactions, outline their key strengths and weaknesses including a comparison of an arrayed multiple orthologous RNAi reagent screen to a pooled CRISPR/Cas9 human rhinovirus 14-human cell interaction screen, and recount some notable insights made possible by each. We conclude with a brief perspective on what might lie ahead for the fast evolving field of human-virus functional genomics.",

            "text": "The burden imposed upon the health of the world's population by just three of the major pathogenic viruses is staggering, with nearly 300 million people chronically infected by either HIV-1 (36 million) or HBV (250 million), and another 5-6 million severe infections by influenza A virus (IAV) occurring transiently each year (Ortblad, Lozano, & Murray, 2013; Schweitzer, Horn, Mikolajczyk, Krause, & Ott, 2015) (http://www.who. int/immunization/topics/influenza/en/). Collectively these three viruses cause the deaths of over 2.5 million people annually. These infections arise because viruses must find and exploit the host's cellular resources and machinery to produce their progeny. Elucidating human pathogenic viral dependencies has been a longstanding pursuit of health science researchers whose goal is to use this knowledge to treat and cure infections. For decades, mammalian in vitro tissue culture systems have proved tremendously useful for studying host-virus interactions. Over this same period, loss-of-function genetic screening produced an impressive number of discoveries and illuminated gene and pathway function in multiple model systems. While loss-offunction genetic screening proved extremely valuable in model systems, such technologies did not exist for mammalian cells until the discovery and implementation of RNA interference (RNAi) (Fire et al., 1998) . The initial technologic revolution of RNAi, and later the development of haploid cell screening, resulted in a wave of discoveries that shed new light on many vital human viral requirements (Brass et al., 2008; Hao et al., 2008; Krishnan et al., 2008; Randall et al., 2007; Sessions et al., 2009) . The ascendance of CRISPR/Cas9 technologies, which can dramatically alter gene expression, has heralded a new era in mammalian in vitro genetic screening (Shalem, Sanjana, & Zhang, 2015) . This review will discuss the available functional genomics strategies, highlight their strengths and weaknesses including a comparison of matched MORR RNAi and CRISRP/Cas9 screens, and provide some future perspectives on the use of mammalian in vitro genetics to elucidate human host-virus interactions.",

Drosophila cell in vitro RNAi screens were the first to detect novel host factor interactions for several human pathogens with the practical focus being on arboviruses, although an elegant approach using a recombinant virus also made it possible to screen for IAV dependency factors in this system (Arkov, Rosenbaum, Christiansen, Jonsson, & Munchow, 2008; Cherry et al., 2005; Hao et al., 2008) . RNAi screens using human cells have now been done for the majority of major human pathogenic viruses (Table 1) ; these efforts have largely used arrayed siRNA libraries combined with high-throughput imaging or plate reader-based assays as readouts for viral replication. Collectively these works have identified multiple previously unappreciated dependencies for each virus, as well as host cell defense mechanisms. Recent publications covering viruses that have been functionally interrogated by multiple independent groups including HIV-1, IAV, and HCV have been discussed elsewhere in detail (Bushman et al., 2009; Hao et al., 2013; Stertz & Shaw, 2011; Zhu et al., 2014) . In this work, we focus on the functional genomic screening technologies and provide a resource noting many of the published host-virus screens along with some of their key attributes.",

Academia and industry both quickly embraced RNAi and paired it with the contemporaneous completion of the genetic annotation of the entire human genome to create multiple large-scale libraries for functional genomic screening (Paddison et al., 2004; Root, Hacohen, Hahn, Lander, & Sabatini, 2006; Silva et al., 2005) . Because the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) machinery's expression is ubiquitous, virtually all mammalian cell lines can carry out RNAi, permitting host-virus screens to be carried out with any tropic cell line and virus pairing (Elbashir et al., 2001) . Two major types of RNAi libraries, pooled and arrayed, have been constructed and dictate the two methods of screening discussed below. We searched the literature for large-scale genetic screens using human viruses (or components of human viruses) and any of the three functional genomic screening strategies covered in this review. We then provided some of the major characteristics of each individual screen, including the virus, cell line, format, library, screen timelines, selection criteria, any main candidate focused upon, and the assays used for follow up and mechanistic validation if applicable.

            "text": "Retroviral expression of complex cDNA libraries in tissue culture cells predated the arrival of RNAi and was readily adapted to stably express short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) that were subsequently processed into dsRNAs suitable for directing the destruction of target mRNAs by RISC. Three major pooled retroviral shRNA libraries were initially constructed, the Hannon-Elledge Open Biosystems shRNA library (Paddison et al., 2004; Silva et al., 2005) , the RNAi Consortium (TRC) library (Root et al., 2006) , both of which are lentiviral and have whole-genome coverage, and a smaller subgenomic gamma-retroviral library, the Bernards shRNA library (Berns et al., 2004) , with additional libraries following (Boettcher & Hoheisel, 2010) . While differing in their design (Hannon-Elledge-OB being comprised of microRNA-context shRNAs vs. TRC and Bernards being made up of simple shRNAs) these reagents all produce siRNAs resulting in alterations in target gene mRNA expression. Each gene is typically targeted by three or more distinct shRNAs resulting in library complexities of 100K+ unique shRNAs. These pooled shRNA retroviral vectors are then packaged into complex populations of retroviruses ( Fig. 1) . A population of cells is transduced with the retroviral pools and then the cells are placed under selection to identify any modulations in viral replication conferred by the integrated provirus shRNA. For all pooled library screens, a key point is that each distinct shRNA vector should be overrepresented by ! 1000-fold in the selected cell population to minimize bottle neck effects during the screening process; this tenet is also important for the pooled CRISRP/Cas9 screens to be discussed below. Pooled shRNA screens for host-virus interactions include an early effort to identify HIV-1 host factors required for replication in a T cell line, as well as two screens for IAV host factors (Su et al., 2013; Tran et al., 2013; Yeung et al., 2009) . Advantages of pooled screening are its relative low cost and the higher knockdown efficiencies realized using retroviral transduction of cell types that are not readily transfected with siRNAs, e.g., primary cells or suspension cells. In addition longer term screening assays that may require weeks to run are best performed with stably expressed shRNA libraries since transient transfection of siRNAs in dividing cells peaks and falls quickly >7 days posttransfection. The lack of published pooled shRNA screens for virus-host interactions is noticeable and likely stems from the limitations in readout when using a pooled strategy, as well as the issue of phenotypic penetration in the setting of partially decreased gene expression or hypomorphism. Two prevailing readouts have been used for pooled shRNA screening, flow cytometry-based sorting of cell populations, e.g., high and low expression of viral proteins or a fluorescent marker protein, as a surrogate for infection, as well as survival screens where a cytopathic virus destroys all of the cells that it can infect and spares any cells which are missing a critical host factor, with the survivors undergoing expansion and gene enrichment. The complete loss of gene expression (null phenotype) is unlikely to be achieved using RNAi, and in particular in a population of cells stably transduced with complex shRNA library. This stems from each cell in the screened population expressing only a single shRNA-expressing provirus. Even if a cell is transduced by more than one shRNA-expressing virus, it is highly improbable that both shRNAs will have the same target. It is difficult for a single proviral shRNA to have enough expression to efficiently deplete the mRNA for its intended target. Accordingly, a pooled shRNA screen using a cytopathic virus and cell survival as a means of gene enrichment might not find the host receptor for the virus because there will be some low level of receptor expression remaining (hypomorphism) that could render the cell susceptible to infection and death.",

Advantages in using the Drosophila system are that the insect cells take up the siRNAs without the need for transfection reagents and that their simpler genetic repertoire may lack functional redundancies which could resist resolution in the more complex human system. Obvious shortcomings are that the findings in the fly cell screens require confirmation in human cells by targeting homologs and that there are human pathogenic viruses that cannot infect fly cells. Thus, a need arose for arrayed RNAi reagents for investigating human pathogenic cells using a human cell-based in vitro system. This need was addressed by four life sciences companies; Dharmacon, Ambion, Sigma, and Qiagen, which each introduced their own independently designed whole-genome siRNA libraries.",

Briefly, the project begins with optimizations of both siRNA transfection and infection conditions in the plate format chosen for the screen, with 384-well plates being strongly preferred due to lower amounts of siRNA library needed and the decreased costs and work load using this smaller scale. Once optimized the screen begins with the transfection of the arrayed library in either duplicate or triplicate (Fig. 1) ; this is usually done in a reverse transfection format with the siRNAs and lipid mixture added to the well first, followed by the cells added in suspension. Target mRNA depletion and decreased protein expression occurs over 1-4 days depending on assay conditions. The longer knockdown periods prior to viral challenge likely improve the observed phenotypes because of increased levels of target protein decay and the dilution effect of added cell divisions. The siRNA-transfected cells are then infected with virus for typically one or two viral lifecycles followed by an assessment of viral replication using either a microscope or plate reader. After the primary arrayed whole-genome screen, the individual siRNAs in the pools of select candidate genes are then rescreened individually in the validation round and the reagent redundancy principle used to select higher confidence genes for follow up.",

            "text": "Arrayed siRNA screening has several advantages over a pooled shRNA approach. For instance, employing an arrayed siRNA library permits shorter term transient transfection-based screens ( Fig. 1; Table 2 ). Additionally the introduction of large effective concentrations of siRNAs into the cells using high efficiency lipid-mediated transfection improves target mRNA depletion producing enhanced phenotypic penetrance. Moreover, by depleting just one-gene-per-well an arrayed screen permits the selection of candidate genes based on more subtle gradations in phenotypes than when using pooled screening readouts. For instance using this format, readouts of viral protein expression, or the expression of a luciferase reporter gene, can be assessed with great sensitivity using high-throughput microscopes or plate readers. Having each gene targeted in its own designated well also creates a homogenously genetically altered population of cells that can be assessed using high content imaging, thus allowing cell biology phenotypes involved in host virus interactions (i.e., RNA virus replication complex morphology) to be screened for in great detail, something which is not possible using a pooled screening strategy. Last, using arrayed annotated libraries allows the immediately identification of which gene may underlie the observed phenotype. Disadvantages of using such an approach include the increased expense of having to purchase, array and maintain these large-scale resources, the analytical machinery needed to carry out and analyze the great number of plates produced by the screen, and the added costs for transfection and screening reagents. Finally, both the siRNA and shRNA screens have major limitations due to their high rates of false positives and false negatives; this last concern regarding the significant caveats of siRNA screening, as well as some corrective measures, are more fully discussed below. The original Dharmacon arrayed human siRNA library, siGENOME, consists of pools of four 19-mer siRNAs (SMARTpools) designed against each of the 21,141 annotated human genes in RefSeq5-8, one gene per well. A later version, On-target-plus (OTP), was similarly constructed but with selective modification of some of the siRNA's base pairs with the intent of minimizing OTEs created by the first eight base pairs of the antisense, the seed sequence, or the sense-strand pairing with microRNA elements thereby unintentionally altering gene expression. Although useful, the antisense OTP reagents likely have a lower affinity for their intended targets which may explain their loss of efficacy compared to matched siGENOME reagents tested side-by-side for depletion of known positive controls (our unpublished data). An updated SMARTpool siGENOME library based on Refseq27 (Dharmacon 6-16) was constructed in a similar manner and has recently replaced the earlier library. An advantage of the SMARTpool library is that four siRNAs are available for validation round screening. A shortcoming is that the available siRNAs for reorder postscreening are continually changing over making it costly to order the exact siRNAs that scored in the original screen.",

The arrayed library can be readily converted to pools based on the way it is plated, with the same well on three matching plates (A, B, C) containing a different siRNA targeting the same gene. An advantage of individual siRNA arrayed screening is that candidate selection for follow up can be done immediately after the primary screen based on reagent redundancy, the disadvantage is that three times more reagents are needed to screen the individual siRNA arrayed Silencer Select library. Importantly, Silencer Select siRNAs mark a major advancement in siRNA design as they incorporate locked nucleic acids (LNAs) which increase antisense strand binding affinity to designed targets and inhibit sense-strand binding thereby decreasing OTEs (Puri et al., 2008) . As with the SMARTpool library the three individual siRNAs available for the validation round are useful and Ambion maintains a consistent supply of the library oligos that can be reordered, with new potentially improved siRNAs being added without replacing the original library set.",

Using this strategy concentration-dependent OTEs are anticipated to be less than using conventional siRNA pools or individual oligos. Since the pools cannot be deconvoluted into a few known components, validation is carried out using a distinct esiRNA pool against the same gene. While useful this approach is limited in terms of its level of reagent redundancy. Furthermore, although the relative concentrations of the individual esiRNA pools in the library are closely matched, the final sizes of the digested product vary leading to an induction of dsRNA-mediated antiviral response that precludes their use with some viruses which are vulnerable to such a defense, e.g., dengue virus.",

While a consistently low number of exact genes overlap across related siRNA screens, it is nonetheless clear that similar screens find bioinformatically related genes, e.g., genes that cluster in common pathways and complexes like the nuclear pore complex (NPC) with HIV-1 and the vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase) for IAV or HRV (Bushman et al., 2009; Hao et al., 2013; Perreira et al., 2015; Stertz & Shaw, 2011; Zhu et al., 2014) . With closer study it became readily apparent that this low level of saturation within the dataset of each primary screen was due to a high level of false negatives (Hao et al., 2013; Meier et al., 2014; Zhu et al., 2014) . False negatives with RNAi may come about for several reasons including difficulty in targeting a protein (prolonged protein half-life or sufficient remaining catalytic activity), nonspecific toxicity of siRNAs, and plate edge effects. These interscreen comparisons also highlight the importance of a post hoc bioinformatic analysis across multiple related screens (metaanalysis) to provide a systems level understanding of viral dependencies. Additionally, candidate genes that score poorly in reagent redundancy validation assays, e.g., only confirming the phenotype with one of four possible siRNAs, are more likely to represent true positives if they physically or functionally interact with candidate genes that are members of enriched clusters. Consequently, bioinformatics can find useful associations that may save a potentially informative candidate gene from down selection.",

            "text": "RNAi screens have revealed the host cell requirements of many human viruses (Table 1) , however, they are beset by false positives and false negatives. We reasoned that by using multiple orthologous RNAi reagents (MORR) in parallel we could take advantage of each large-scale reagent's best characteristics while minimizing their worst. With this in mind, we used MORR screens (Silencer Select, SMARTpool, and esiRNA libraries) to identify high-confidence HIV-1 dependency factors (HDFs) or HRV host factors (HRV-HFs) (Perreira et al., 2015; Zhu et al., 2014) ; these three libraries are >90% orthologous based on a comparison of siRNA sequences. We then traditionally validated the candidates from each of the primary screens. In addition, we integrated the primary MORR datasets, and those of earlier studies in the case of HIV-1, by adapting an established analysis method, RNAi gene enrichment ranking (RIGER) (Luo et al., 2008) . RIGER uses a weighted likelihood ratio to calculate a gene-specific enrichment score based on the rank distribution of each individual RNAi reagent across all of those screened. The RIGER enrichment score is expressed as a p value assigned to each gene which represents the likelihood that the gene plays a role in viral replication. By integrating the entire primary screen datasets RIGER also decreases false negatives created by the combination of hypomorphism and the use of absolute cutoffs for candidate selection. Both these projects represented two of the most comprehensive siRNA screening efforts to date and produced quantitatively integrated datasets for each virus which highly ranked both known viral dependency factors and previously unappreciated ones. To assess if MORR/RIGER improves the yield from the screen as compared to a more traditional screening approach, we assessed each respective dataset (RIGER (all screens integrated) and each of the individual MORR screens) for their enrichment of a set of annotated gene complexes or pathways. The annotated gene sets were selected because there was significant enrichment of their components across the individual screens (e.g., the NPC for HIV-1 or the 80S ribosome for HRV (Perreira et al., 2015) . These comparative enrichment analyses quantitatively demonstrated that the MORR/RIGER approach produces a data set which is statistically better in its enrichment for expected host factors than any of the individual screens on their own. Since this approach is more sensitive and specific in finding known host factors, we conclude that it would also be the best method for detecting previously unappreciated hostvirus interactions.",

OTEs in siRNA screens are also detected and removed using OTE identification programs, for instance, the genome-wide enrichment of seed sequence matches (GESS) method (Sigoillot et al., 2012) . GESS is premised on the knowledge that OTEs are the result of siRNA seed sequences binding to mRNAs other than the intended target or by siRNAs inadvertently binding to microRNA sites. GESS detects prominent OTEs by searching for matches between the RefSeq mRNAs and the seed sequences of the siRNAs that confirm in the validation round. The negative control consists of a scrambled set of the validation round seed sequences. mRNAs that are more often complementary to the validation round siRNA seed sequences than the scrambled sequences are flagged as suspicious for being an OTE and removed from further evaluation. Collectively, MORR/RIGER screening combined with gene expression filtering, and OTE identification minimizes the caveats of RNAi screening thus improving its efficiency and yield.",

            "text": "The creation of haplo-insufficiencies using retroviral gene trapping has been and continues to be useful for mammalian genetic screening (Dziuba et al., 2012; Evans, Carlton, & Russ, 1997; Organ, Sheng, Ruley, & Rubin, 2004; von Melchner & Ruley, 1989) ; however, this approach is limited due to its inability to produce homozygous null mutations. This shortcoming was overcome through the introduction of a nearhaploid cell line, KBM-7, for use in genetic screens where the remaining allele is inactivated using random retroviral insertion mutagenesis (Carette et al., 2009) . KBM-7 cells originated from a 39-year-old gentleman with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and were first reported by the McCredie lab (Andersson et al., 1987) , with later isolation of a clonal population of near-haploid cells (2 copies of chromosome 8 and partial disomy of chromosome 15) by Kotecki, Reddy, and Cochran (1999) . Haploid cell screens concerned with human-virus interactions have primarily been used in pooled screening approaches involving strong selective pressure by cytopathic viruses, either wild type or recombinant (Table 1) . After transduction and selection for a retrovirally expressed selection marker, the cells are cultured to permit phenotypic penetrance via protein turnover and divisional dilution then infected with a cytopathic virus with the rolling infection leading to the destruction of any permissive cells (Fig. 1) . The surviving cells are then expanded and the respective integration site of the proviruses are determined using PCR and next-gen sequencing. Genes which are found to have multiple independent insertions are selected as high-confidence candidates using a rationale similar to the reagent redundancy principle employed for selecting candidates in RNAi screens. While powerful, an acknowledged shortcoming of this approach is that it can only be done using a haploid cell line, which may not be readily infected by a human pathogen of interest, e.g., HBV. In an effort to overcome this limitation the KBM-7 cells were genetically reprogrammed, and while the result was not the desired induced pluripotent stem cell line, this work nevertheless gave rise to a more fibroblast like cell line, HAP1 (Carette et al., 2010) , that demonstrates adherent growth as compared to the KBM-7 cells, which grow in suspension. The class of host factors predominantly found by the haploid cell screens to date is discussed below.",

            "text": "To defend themselves, bacteria and archaea employ an adaptive immune response using short guide RNAs (sgRNAs) to target and destroy the DNA of invading pathogens (Doudna & Charpentier, 2014) . This protective response, known as the CRISPR/Cas9 system, has been adapted for genome editing and the regulation of gene expression in multiple model systems including genome-wide mammalian in vitro genetic screening (Cong et al., 2013; Doudna & Charpentier, 2014; Shalem et al., 2014; Wang, Wei, Sabatini, & Lander, 2014) . Because Cas9 acts on genomic DNA and not mRNA like RISC, this permits the generation of a permanent homozygous null phenotype. The CRISPR/Cas9 system works in all mammalian cells exogenously expressing Cas9, this combined with its gene targeting specificity make this approach more generalizable than haploid cell screens . Importantly, because Cas9 locates and binds to a determined DNA target via the complementary base pairing of a short guide RNA (sgRNA), a catalytically inactive Cas9 fused to an activation or repressor domain can bind a desired locus and modulate its gene expression, this capability is extremely powerful and has not been possible using RNAi or haploid cell-screening approaches (Gilbert et al., 2014; Qi et al., 2013) ( Table 2) . What's more, because a single integrated provirus expressing a sgRNA can, together with Cas9, permanently extinguish a gene's expression, it avoids the same mass action handicap that confronts a single shRNA-expressing provirus whose task is never completed as it must continually silence the products of ongoing transcription. It follows then that under pooled genetic screening conditions, where only one provirus is present per cell, CRISPR/Cas9 will produce greater phenotypic penetrance (Table 2) . Several studies have found that while OTEs do occur using CRISPR/Cas9 they appear to be less prevalent than the levels of OTEs encountered with RNAi Wang et al., 2015; Wu et al., 2014) . Engineered Cas9 proteins with improved specificity also promise to make false positives even rarer (Slaymaker et al., 2016) . In order to control for OTEs produced by inadvertent gene editing events the standard for validation of CRISPR/Cas9 results has become similar to RNAi's reagent redundancy principle with the results from two or more orthologous sgRNA against the same gene or two or more clones required. As with RNAi the most convincing confirmation is phenotypic restoration via the expression of a resistant cDNA.",

The exogenously expressed Cas9 can be either catalytically active and create null alleles, or a catalytically inactive protein fused to one of several transcription factor domains for activation or repression of the sgRNA-targeted locus (Gilbert et al., 2014; Qi et al., 2013) . Pooled sgRNA retroviral vectors designed to target every human gene are then packaged into retroviruses and used to stably transduce the Cas9-expressing target cells at a high representation (goal of 1000-fold, Fig. 1 ). The transduced cells are placed under selection for two weeks to permit the phenotypic maturation. The gene-edited cells are then challenged with the virus of interest, with either cell survival or protein expression based selection or readout. The selected cells are expanded and the identities of enriched sgRNAs are obtained using next-gen sequencing of PCR products amplified from genomic DNA.",

An early effort used CRISPR/Cas9 strategy to identify host factors that govern West Nile virus' (WNV's) cytopathic effect (Ma et al., 2015) . An earlier WNV host factor arrayed siRNA screen had discovered a few hundred high-confidence candidates using viral protein expression (GFP transgene) as a readout (Krishnan et al., 2008) . This much earlier siRNA screen was also stopped well before any cytopathic effect was appreciated. Not surprisingly the candidate gene overlap between the two efforts was small in part arising from the different endpoints, cell survival versus viral protein expression. Interestingly, the CRISPR/Cas9 screen found that the EMC complex, a conserved set of ER-associated proteins implicated in transmembrane protein expression and lipid trafficking was required for WNV's cytopathic effect but not its replication (Wideman, 2015) .",

            "text": "To date, RNAi screens have been the primary method used for human-virus loss-of-function genetic screens (Table 1) . CRISPR/Cas9 is a newly arrived powerful functional genomic technology which can create homozygous null alleles for each human gene. We wished to compare these two approaches, arrayed MORR RNAi versus pooled CRISPR/Cas9, using the same screening platform involving a fully infectious cytopathic HRV strain, HRV14, and H1-HeLa cells that endogenously express the HRV host receptor, ICAM1. We first performed an image-based MORR/RIGER screen to find HRV14-HFs that modulate replication using viral V1 capsid (CA) expression as determined by an immunofluorescence readout ( Fig. 2A) . For the screens, we transfected a final concentration of each siRNA pool at 50 nM final concentration for 72 h then challenged the cells with HRV14 at an multiplicity of infection (moi) of 0.3 for 12 h at 33\u00b0C. The replication cycle of HRV14 is approximately 8 h. To evaluate cell numbers the HeLa cell nuclear DNA was stained with Hoechst 33342. Magnified images of each well were captured in two wavelengths (FITC and DAPI) using a high-throughput microscope (ImageXpress Micro-XL, Molecular Devices) and the percent infected H1-HeLa cells calculated using image analysis software. These parallel efforts identified >160 highconfidence candidates across the MORR screens using the Silencer Select, SMARTpool, and esiRNA libraries (Perreira et al., 2015) . As seen with ours and others previous siRNA functional genomic screens, the number of exact genes identified across more than one primary screen dataset was low (Fig. 2B) . Of interest is that in this instance the only factor that was different between the compared screens was the different siRNA libraries we used, demonstrating the marked influence of the targeting reagents in the observed lack of interscreen concordance. The primary screen candidates were traditionally validated using their respective deconvoluted individual siRNAs (Silencer Select pools with three siRNAs and SMARTpools with four siRNAs), or by retesting the esiRNA pools, in a manner identical to the primary screen (viral capsid expression). As is outlined above, we addressed the problems with siRNA screening by using these three libraries together with the RIGER analysis method to integrate all of the HRV-HF primary screen data sets; this permitted us to assign a numeric value for the likelihood that each gene was important for HRV replication (p value, Fig. 2C ). KS, SBR, and WS represent three different RIGER methods; we found that the SBR and WS methods performed the best across multiple gene test sets (Fig. 2D ). Our MORR screening approach was validated by the significant enrichment of multiple pathways and protein complexes in the respective screens (e.g., the 80S ribosome), as well as an improvement in these benchmarks when the datasets were integrated using RIGER (Fig. 2D ) (Perreira et al., 2015) . We also used gene expression filtering to remove candidates that were not expressed in the cells used for the screens, e.g., GRXCR1, whose net expression value is highlighted in red (Fig. 2C ). The complete MORR/RIGER work flow extending from the primary screens through to top candidate evaluation is shown (Fig. 2G ).",

            "text": "To compare screening strategies, as well as perform an orthologous investigation of HRV14's human cell requirements, we next carried out a CRISPR/Cas9 screen using the exact same cell line and virus. We report this CRISPR/Cas9 HRV14 screen here for the first time. We stably expressed a human codon-optimized cDNA of S. pyogenes Cas9 in a population of HeLa-H1 cells (Fig. 3A ) . After selection with hygromycin, the cell population was tested for Cas9 expression by immunoblotting as well as the ability to satisfactorily extinguish the expression Figure 2 -Cont'd expression data (Affy net expression) is also given based on a microarray analysis of mRNA from the H1-HeLa cells used in the screen. The filled box indicates a gene, GRXCR1, whose expression was found to be below the lower cutoff for candidate selection and thus represents an OTE. (D) The RIGER analyses (WS, SB, and KS) and the individual MORR screen datasets were assessed by determining their respective levels of enrichment for an annotated list of 80S ribosome protein components. A numeric enrichment score was calculated by determining the area under the curve (AUC) produced by plotting the percent fraction of 80S component proteins (% of all 80S subunits) encountered moving from the lowest to highest p value on the ranked gene lists (rank of all genes targeted in the screen by p value). Numbers represent the percent enrichment of the total gene set at <60% of the ranked gene list (Perreira et al., 2015) . (E) A schematic of the workflow for the MORR/RIGER screening approach with the primary MORR screens, integrative RIGER analysis, and traditional reagent redundancy validation round shown. False positives are decreased using gene expression filtering and OTE identification using GESS (Sigoillot et al., 2012) . This combined strategy minimizes both false positive and false negatives and is useful for identifying highconfidence HRV-HFs. of the endogenous HRV14 receptor, ICAM1, and a provirus expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) using a sgRNA against each respective target (Fig. 3B , data not shown). Next, we stably transduced the H1-HeLa-Cas9 cells at a moi of 0.2 with a complex lentiviral pool expressing the human GeCKO v.2 sgRNA library (Addgene #1000000049), which targets 19,052 genes in the human genome with six sgRNAs per gene across two half-libraries (library A and B) . Libraries A and B each possess three unique sgRNA per gene and we used the two half-libraries to screen for HRV14-HFs independently. For each library, we plated 4 \u00c2 10 7 cells onto two 15-cm dishes to achieve a 600-fold representation of each sgRNA in the final cell population. We empirically determined this level of representation using a series of titration plates that were infected and processed side-by-side with the sgRNA libraryexpressing cells. We then selected the cells in puromycin for 11 days, a period of time which we had empirically determined to result in >80% of cells losing expression of a sgRNA-targeted marker protein (GFP, Fig. 2B ) The selected cells were then infected with HRV14 and cultured at 33\u00b0C for $7 days. To follow the progress of the infection, cytopathic effect (CPE) was monitored by eye using light microscopy. Control plates were run in parallel using the H1-HeLa-Cas9 cell parent population which does not contain the GeCKO library. About 7 days after infection the majority of cells, >95%, had died. The remaining surviving cells were washed extensively and transferred to 37\u00b0C with fresh medium. The surviving cells were expanded and genomic DNA prepared. No surviving cells were recovered from the control parental cell plates. Proviruses containing the sgRNA stably integrated into each of the surviving cells were amplified and identified from genomic DNA using PCR and next-gen sequencing using an Ion Torrent sequencer. Sequencing reads (reads) were trimmed at their sgRNA boundaries and mapped back to the complete sgRNA entries for both library A and B using Cutadapt, Bowtie2, and Samtools. This process allowed us to map and rank the frequency of 1153 unique reads from a total of 3,961,083 total reads. We also tested the expanded surviving cells for their susceptibility to HRV14 infection and found that the postscreen population of cells was highly resistant to viral CPE (Fig. 3C) . Analysis of the resistant cell populations by flow cytometry showed the near complete absence of the HRV14 receptor, ICAM1, on the cell surface, which is in stark contrast to the pre-screen parent cell population (Fig. 3D ). Similar to RNAi screens, we next used the reagent redundancy principle to select for candidate genes which had >6 sequencing reads for two or more independent sgRNAs. Among the unique sgRNAs detected by next-gen sequencing only two genes presented with more than two independent sgRNAs, ICAM1 (five of six total sgRNAs recovered) and EXOC4 (two of six total sgRNAs, Fig. 3E ). Of the 3.9 million total reads >95% mapped to one of the five sgRNAs targeting ICAM1. Of these two candidates only ICAM1 overlapped with the MORR/RIGER screen HRV-HF candidate list (Fig. 4) .",

Therefore, while conventional catalytic CRISPR/Cas9 and haploid cell-screening technologies use different strategies for creating loss-of-function alleles, their shared method of screening complex pools of cells for survival likely leads to similar results. For an illustration, we note the IAV haploid cell screen and two additional haploid cell survival screens which identified the host receptors for Lassa virus and Ebola virus using similar pooled strategies to those being employed with CRISPR/Cas9 screens (Carette et al., 2009 (Carette et al., , 2011 Jae et al., 2013) . Interestingly, the latter two haploid cell screens used identical recombinant vesicular stomatitis viruses (rVSVs) with the exception of their respective envelope proteins, Lassa virus or Ebola virus. Notably there was not a single candidate gene that was found in common between these two pooled screens, arguing that under such conditions only a total block to VSV entry can confer cell survival. A factor which may cause pooled screens to strongly enrich for entry-associated host factors is the intense selective pressure that the cells are subjected to as the levels of virus surge during the course of the screen. It is possible that even with the loss of a reasonably important postentry viral dependency factor that at such a high moi the overwhelming entry of so many viruses alone, even with some diminishment of their Figure 4 MORR and CRISPR/Cas9 HRV-HF screen candidate overlap. We used the RIGER analysis of the HRV-HF MORR screens to produce a speculative model cell showing the HRV lifecycle overlayed with where the top 164 high-confidence candidate HRV-HFs are likely to act based on available published data (Perreira et al., 2015) . A single HRV-HF candidate, ICAM1, shared between the arrayed MORR/RIGER siRNA screen and the matched pooled CRISPR/Cas9 screen, is highlighted with a box.

The VSV-ANDV pp was used to infect an arrayed panel of cells that had been previously transfected in a well by well manner with a first-generation subgenomic Ambion siRNA library targeting 9102 human genes. After VSV-ANDV pp challenge a plate reader was used to quantify pp replication based on relative light units (RLUs). Genes were selected as candidates if they met criteria for significantly decreasing RLUs as compared to the control with two or more unique siRNAs. Follow up involved an identical screen using additional orthologous siRNAs. Thirty three genes were ultimately selected as highconfidence candidates with only one, SREBF2, being shared in common with the companion haploid cell screen. Further mechanistic studies demonstrated that loss of the sterol regulatory element-binding protein pathway prevented ANDV glycoprotein-mediated entry. Given the greater number of high-confidence candidates found in the RNAi screen, it would be interesting to determine if they were also all acting at entry or were instead required for the early postentry replication and expression of the luciferase transgene within the rVSV genome. Therefore, as with the other haploid cell screen noted above, this approach excels at finding entry factors. In this instance the paired RNAi arm of the study showed itself to be more sensitive because it found more high-confidence host factors using viral replication (RLUs) and not survival as a readout.",

Based on our experience using pooled CRISPR/Cas9 to screen for host factors required by cytopathic viruses (HRV and IAV, Fig. 3 and our unpublished data) it appears that this approach will produce similar results to those seen with the pooled haploid cell survival screens, with only very early factors associated with viral entry, or genes need for the expression or activity of such genes, being enriched for in the surviving cell populations. One approach for recovering a deeper set of viral host factors may lie in halting the cytopathic virus pooled screen at intermediate stages of CPE, however, in our experience screening with HRV using shifts to nonpermissive temperatures and incubation with neutralizing antibodies, the practical execution of this idea is difficult. An arrayed haploid cell or CRISPR/Cas9 approach would permit more subtle selection criteria to be used such as those employed with arrayed siRNA screens. With this in mind, recent efforts have resulted in 3396 clonal HAP1 cell populations being characterized and arrayed with each one lacking the expression of a single gene due to retroviral insertion (Petersen et al., 2014) . Unfortunately, because retroviral insertion is a random process it is not possible to selectively inactivate one class of gene or pathway, making the assembly of specialty libraries a matter of hunt and peck. This expanding arrayed HAP1 null allele cell resource would allow detailed investigation of single clones or focused subsets of clones, although the long-term culturing of such large numbers of distinct cell lines simultaneously will present significant challenges. Similar concerns for wholegenome arrayed CRISPR/Cas9 cell lines or lentiviruses would also present similar hurdles. Price permitting, this limitation might be avoided using large-scale arrayed sgRNA oligos or gene blocks that can be introduced into cells in a one-gene-per-well manner via lipid-mediated transfection along with Cas9 mRNA; these are arrayed sgRNA libraries are presently on hand in smaller gene sets but will undoubtedly become available in druggable or whole-genome versions in the near future. Care will need to be taken to allow sufficient time to elapse posttransfection for the generation of biallelic null mutations and phenotypic maturation prior to screening.",

One possibility is the use of less stringent selection criteria such as selecting cells from a pool based on their relative expression of a marker protein. An elegant example of such a strategy for gene enrichment using pooled screening was recently done using flow cytometry to sort cells based on their expression of tumor necrosis factor (Tnf ), which is elaborated in primary dendritic cells (DCs) after exposure to the bacterial product, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (Parnas et al., 2015) . The DCs were transduced so as to express Cas9 together with a complex sgRNA library of 125,793 sgRNAs directed against 21,786 mouse genes (Sanjana, Shalem, & Zhang, 2014 ). The pooled screen was performed three times using >60 million DCs stimulated with LPS. After LPS stimulation, the DCs were fixed, permeabilized, and immunostained for Tnf. Based on anti-Tnf antibody-associated immunofluorescence both high and low expressing Tnf populations were sorted using flow cytometry. The identities of the enriched sgRNAs were determined using PCR amplification of genomic DNA followed by next-gen sequencing. The authors arrived at >100 high-confidence candidates, several of which were previously known to be involved in DC responses to LPS, thus validating their approach and demonstrating its sensitivity.",

As can be seen in many of the arrayed siRNA screens, including our screens for HIV-1, HCV, and HRV14, host receptors and viral entry factors are also found with this approach, however, since these screens yield much greater lists of candidates, which include OTEs, any novel host receptors may not immediately jump to the fore. Therefore, given the currently available functional genomic strategies if the goal is to find viral entry factors (e.g., host receptors) with high specificity its best to use a pooled survival screen, but alternatively if the aim is to obtain with relative ease a more comprehensive set of host factors, albeit with more prevalent false positives, than an arrayed siRNA screen would be the preferred method.",

This concern arises because of the potential for shared long distance OTEs being produced by orthologous sgRNAs designed against the same gene which will be binding relatively close to one another. Arrayed CRISRP/Cas9 screens using oligonucleotides (sgRNA and Cas9 mRNA) introduced into cells via lipid-mediated transfection may also rival or surpass established siRNA arrayed approaches, and while the current offerings of these reagents consist of smaller subgenomic gene sets it is anticipated that whole-genome versions will be commercially available shortly. That said, until the widespread implementation of arrayed CRISPR/Cas9 whole-genome screening, it seems likely that RNAi will continue to be the workhorse of functional genomic screening given its (i) first to market status, (ii) ease of use for arrayed screening, and (iii) high sensitivity and strong yields. However its prominent caveats increase the workload for validation substantially and may help to usher in an arrayed CRISPR/Cas9 screening era. We anticipate that approaches to minimize RNAi's problems, in combination with the expansion and adoption of CRISPR/Cas9 strategies, will continue to accelerate our understanding of human-virus interactions.",
