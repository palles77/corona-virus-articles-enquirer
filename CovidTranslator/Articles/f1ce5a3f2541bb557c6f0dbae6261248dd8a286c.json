These vulnerabilities could be based on unique viral targets, such as the RNA-dependent RNA polymerases, or on dependency on host encoded pro-viral activities. To identify such host pro-viral factors we embarked on genome-scale screens for diverse families of viruses and identified scores of required host factors [1] [2] [3] [4] .

Knockout of TDRD3 in HuH-7 cells led to levels of TOP3B that were almost as low as those obtained with knockout of TOP3B itself (Fig 1C) . Knockout of TOP3B, which does not alter TDRD3 levels, resulted in the same dramatic decrease in DENV-2, YFV and Zika virus (ZIKV) replication as knockout of TDRD3 (Fig 1D & E) , which suggested that the only role of TDRD3 .

Indeed, TOP3B overexpression rescued DENV-2 infection in TDRD3 KO cells (Fig 1F) . The reverse was not true, TDRD3 overexpression was incapable of rescuing virus replication in a TOP3B KO cells. Therefore, we conclude that TOP3B is a proviral host factor for several flaviviruses.",

The understanding of the broad requirement for TOP3B among (+) ss RNA viruses will likely provide important insights into heretofore understudied steps in their lifecycles. While a requirement for human topoisomerase TOP1 in exacerbated inflammation induced by RNA virus infection has been previously documented 10 , the direct action of an RNA topoisomerase in viral replication is unprecedented, and has important biological implications. A requirement for a RNA topoisomerase as a critical cofactor for (+) ss RNA viruses is reasonable since viral genomes, because of their complex structures and size, especially the large coronaviruses, may lend themselves to topological problems (knots and catenanes) 11,12 . In parallel work focused on exploring these implications we have shown that TOP3B is required for a late step in DENV-2 replication, likely during the assembly of the genome into virions (Prasanth et al., manuscript in preparation). Furthermore, this action requires the topoisomerase activity of TOP3B since it is abrogated by a tyrosine to phenylalanine mutation (Y336F) in the active site of the enzyme (Ibid).

It must be clear that we make this suggestion responsibly with full understanding that our work is an early step in what must be a rigorous process to identify effective antivirals. Nonetheless, several facts support this consideration. TOP3B -/mice are viable 13 and humans with a homozygous 240-kb deletion of chromosome 22q11.22 spanning TOP3B gene are also viable 7 . Although both homozygous null mice and humans have abnormal phenotypes, the enzyme is not essential. Topoisomerase inhibitors are well known drugs used to treat cancer (e.g. doxorubicin) 14 and bacterial infections (e.g., ciproflaxin) 15 . Unfortunately, we are not aware of any approved TOP3B drugs and prior to this report there was no evidence that inhibiting TOP3B could be a useful in treating acute viral infections. In fact other than the ACE-2 receptor, and perhaps furin, required for SARS-CoV-2 attachment and entry 16 , TOP3B is the only other known required host factor. We hope this brief communication will spur interactions between individuals studying TOP3B and developing inhibitors of TOP3B, and those working on SARS-CoV-2.",

Zika virus (ZIKV-Cambodian) was derived from infections cDNA clone and propagated in Vero cells as described before 17 . A Renilla luciferase reporter chikungunya virus (CHIKV) was derived from an infectious cDNA clone where the luciferase gene was inserted into a subgenomic regions (Unpublished; Chao Shan, Xuping Xie, and Pei-Yong Shi). The recombinant Ebola virus (EBOV) strain Mayinga expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) from the GFP gene inserted between the NP and VP35 genes was recovered from the EBOV full-length clone which were provided by Jonathan Towner and Stuart Nichol (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC]) and the support plasmids provided by Drs. Y. Kawaoka (University of Wisconsin) and H. Feldmann (Rocky Mountain Laboratories, NIAID) and was identical to the virus described previously 18 .

Other viruses were handled in BSL2 conditions until the proper inactivation and disinfection.Virus titration. To determine virus titer, plaque-forming assays of DENV were performed by using BHK21 cells. And, Plaque forming assay of ZIKV and CVB3 was performed with Vero cells. Cells were seeded at a density of 2 \u00d7 10 5 cells per well in a 24 well plate. 24 hours later, cell monolayers were washed and overlaid with 10-fold serial dilutions of culture supernatant from DENV and ZIKV infections. After one hour, the inoculum was replaced, cells were washed and overlaid with 1% CMC containing DMEM and 2% FBS. Cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 5 days for DENV and 4 days for ZIKV and the overlay media was removed and cells were fixed for 30 minutes with 3% formaldehyde.

For IAV infections, HuH-7 cell monolayers were washed once with DPBS, and IAV (strain Influenza A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 H1N1) was diluted in DPBS with 0.4% (w/v) BSA for infection at multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01 PFU/cell, was incubated on cells at 37\u00b0C for 1 hr. Inoculations were removed, cells were washed twice with DPBS, overlaid with DMEM containing 0.4% (w/v) BSA, 0.1 \u00b5g/mL TPCK-treated trypsin, and incubated at 37\u00b0C. Supernatants were collected for plaque assay at the indicated time points (24h, 48, 72h). Standard confluent monolayers of MDCK cells were washed once with DPBS. The collected supernatants containing virus were diluted in DPBS with 0.4% (w/v) BSA, and incubated on cells at 37\u00b0C for 1 hr. The medium was then removed, cells were washed twice with DPBS and replaced with MEM containing 0.6% oxoid agar, 1 \u00b5g/mL TPCK-treated trypsin and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 2 days. Cells were fixed in 3.7% (v/v) paraformaldehyde (PFA) in DPBS for 1 hr at room temperature, and stained with 1% (w/v) crystal violet, 20% (v/v) methanol in DPBS for 20 minOf the IAV experiment, the supernatant was collected over time (at 24, 48, 72 h.p.i). The virus titer was measured by plaque forming-assay. Immunofluorescence and imaging. IFA of cells infected with DENV, YFV or CVB3 was performed as described previously 21 . Briefly, the cells were stained with 4G2 mAb as a primary antibody, Alexa647-conjugated anti-mouse IgG mAb as a secondary antibody and DAPI. VP1 antibody was used for the primary antibody against CVB3 infected cells. IFA images of the plates were taken with the 10\u00d7 objective on an Opera Phenix High Content Screening System (PerkinElmer) and the images were analyzed using the associated Harmony\u00ae Office Software (PerkinElmer). Four microscopic areas per well were selected, and total and infected cells were counted based on Alexa647 and DAPI signal. The infection rate was obtained from the average of the four areas and shown as % infected cells. Transfections and Rescue experiment. 5 \u00d7 10 4 HuH-7 WT, TDRD3 KO or TOP3B KO cells were seeded on 24 well plates. After 24 h of culture, the cells were transfected with pGFP alone, or pGFP-TDRD3, or pGFP-Top3B and 24 hrs later transfected cells were split into a new plate and infected with DENV-2 at an MOI of 0.2. At 72 hr post-infection, viral titers in culture supernatants were measured by plaque-forming assay. Expression of exogenous GFP-tagged TDRD3 or TOP3B was confirmed by Western-blotting.",
