This step is proteolytic activation by cleavage at specific pairs of basic residues. These enzymes, named pro-protein convertases (PCs), are responsible for generating bioactive peptides and activating several enzymes and growth factors that are implicated in many important physiological events. PCs have roles in several pathologies including viral infections and cancers and, thus, are promising targets for therapeutic applications. Recent structural and homology-modeling studies demonstrate more similarity than expected at the catalytic site of the seven PCs, which makes the development of selective drugs to target individual PCs frustrating. Based on this information, we review the latest strategies to inhibit PCs, which might lead to the development of specific compounds.",

Through their endoproteolytic actions on inactive precursor proteins in the secretory pathway, PCs generate essential bioactive peptides, including hormones and neuropeptides (e.g. adrenocorticotropic hormone and insulin), that have vital roles in homeostatic balance and the regulation of life functions. They also activate growth factors and differentiation factors, proteins in the extracellular matrix and plasma, enzymes, receptors, viral-coat proteins and bacterial toxins. The PC family of enzymes is encoded by seven genes (see Box 1 and Table 1 for nomenclature), of which the archetype furin is the most studied (reviewed in [1, 2] ). Mammalian PCs are related to the yeast kexin and bacterial subtilisins, and Figure 1 presents the structural features of PCs. PCs are Ca 2Cdependent serine proteases that were identified originally based on their ability to cleave precursor proteins at the peptide bond C-terminal to paired basic residues, such as K-RY and R-RY. However, the cleavage-recognition motifs are now known to extend N-terminal to the cleavage site and often include additional arginine residues (e.g. R-x-[K/R]-RY).",

In addition, they have well-defined cellular tasks and are crucial for the initiation and progress of many important diseases, most prominently in several viral infections and cancers. For example, furin and PC7 are required for the activation of HIV-1 viral coat protein glycoprotein 160 (gp160) to gp120 and gp41 to produce virions that are effective in receptor binding and membrane fusion during infection [4] .

This is based on the fact that PCs are highly selective proteinases that cleave an uncommon sequence motif in proteins (e.g. R-x-K-R). However, the most potent inhibitors known to date, which target the catalytic site, are not significantly specific for a single PC. Comparing inhibitors of PCs shows that many Figure 1 . PC architecture. The PCs have a highly homologous architecture that is composed of: (i) an N-terminal signal peptide, which is responsible for directing proteins into the secretory pathway; (ii) a pro-domain, which acts as a putative intramolecular chaperone for facilitated transportation, folding and regulation of enzymatic activity; (iii) a catalytic domain, which contains an active site that is responsible for substrate-specific interactions and cleavage; (iv) a P domain, which is an independent folding moiety with the conformation of a barrel-like roll that is essential for structural cohesion of the enzyme and activity by regulating stability, and Ca 2C -and pH-dependence; and (v) a divergent C-terminal domain that can contain membrane attachment sequences, Cys-rich regions and intracellular sorting signals. Additionally, furin contains two functional groups for internal ionic interactions (Ca 2C -binding sites), one of which is beneath the active site and provides stability. D (aspartate), H (histidine) and S (serine) are part of the catalytic triad. N (asparagine) is located in the oxyanion hole and stabilizes, through its NH 2 group, the negative charge that is developed in the peptide bond as a result of the nucleophilic attack from the catalytic serine. At least two isoforms of PC5/6 (A and B) have been identified, both of which are encoded by the same gene. have high potency but are not specific for one PC ( Figure 2 ). In addition, PCs are often coexpressed within cells, so that all cells express a 'cocktail' of at least two PCs. Thus, poorly selective PC inhibitors will affect multiple cellular functions, and not only the pathological processes that are targeted.",

This has been emphasized recently by studies in transgenic inducible-knockout mice, which lack furin in the liver [24] . Known substrates of furin in the liver (e.g. albumin, a 5 integrin, lipoproteinreceptor-related protein, vitronectin, a 1 -microglobulin and bikunin) are either processed or partially processed in these mice, which indicates redundancy with other PCs in the liver.

The crystal structure of furin provides crucial information on the spatial arrangement of the two domains that are implicated in PC activity: the catalytic domain, which contains the active site that is responsible for substrate-specific recognition and processing; and the P domain, which is responsible for enzyme stability (Figure 3a) . The crystal structure of furin in a covalently bound complex with the suicide inhibitor decanoyl-RVKR-chloromethylketone (dec-RVKR-cmk) [25] has led to the identification of the reactive amino acids that make up the S 1 -S 4 subsite pockets * . This structural information permits modeling and docking analysis [27, 28] , which has led to the extrapolation of further subsites, including the S 5 , S 6 and S 1 0 subsite pockets ( Figure 3b , Table 2 ). Apart from S 3 and S 1 0 , all subsite pockets of the active site of furin contain several protophilic carboxylates and carboxamides, which explains the stringent preference for either arginyl or lysyl functionality groups in substrates and inhibitors ( Table 2) .",

These observations lower expectations for the possible development of short peptide inhibitors of PCs (four-five residues) that are specific for individual PCs. However, the differences observed at the S 6 subsite indicate that specific, short-peptide inhibitors require at least six residues. Beyond the S 6 subsite, further differences might be exploited to design specific inhibitors. As yet, these differences are not well identified but some attempts have been made. For example, a recent study demonstrates that exploiting the catalytic-site proximity of socalled 'adventitious contacts' can lead to more-specific inhibitors [29] . The mapping of proximal sites is also aided by solution-structure studies of the PC1/3 pro-domain [30] and subsequent docking analysis with PCs. Unlike dec-RVKR-cmk, which maps only four subsite positions [28] , pro-domain-docking analysis demonstrates distinctions between furin and the other PCs at the S 5 -subsite and S 6 -subsite pockets ( Table 2 ). Further structural studies of the crystallization of furin and other PCs complexed with different inhibitors are needed to provide a better understanding of the catalytic site of PCs.",

Such combinatorial libraries of degenerate mixtures of small-peptide inhibitors have been used successfully to compile the most potent sequence for inhibiting furin (nona-arginine) [33] , and to identify a previously unknown sequence, LLRVKR, which potently inhibits PC1/3 [31, 34] .

Fug\u00e8re et al., unpublished), which highlights the difficulty in achieving substantial specificity using the active site exclusively. From a therapeutic perspective, D-polyarginines are interesting as lead compounds because they cannot be cleaved by PCs and are thus more stable. D-Peptide therapeutics are also less prone to other proteolytic activities such as carboxypeptidases. D-hexa-arginine blocks the activation of P. aeruginosa exotoxin A [16] and D-nona-arginine partially protects macrophages and mice against anthrax toxemia [17, 27] . L-Hexa-arginine is an efficient inhibitor of the processing of gp160 (env) at the REKR551 sequence in vitro and ex vivo, and effectively suppresses HIV-1 infection of T cells and macrophages [4] . Both furin and PC7, the two principal PCs that are expressed by HIV-host cells, are the best candidates for processing the precursor of HIV-1 gp160 [37] . If polyarginine peptides do not exhibit undesirable interactions with other biological processes they might become key components for a combined therapy that targets furin, PC5/6 and PC7 simultaneously. Conversely, introducing these polyarginine peptide sequences into engineered polypeptides might achieve greater specificity while retaining high potency.",

The first successful example is a1-antitrypsin, which has been transformed into a potent furin inhibitor by the insertion of a furin-like recognition sequence (Arg355-Ile-Pro-Arg358) into its reactive-site loop. This bioengineered protein, named antitrypsinportland (a 1 -AT-PDX), inhibits furin and PC5/6 without altering its serpin-like mechanism of inhibition (reviewed in [32] ). The potential therapeutic value of a 1 -AT-PDX is demonstrated by its ability, following exogenous application, to prevent processing of HIV type 1 gp160 and maturation ex vivo of pro-gB, the precursor of human cytomegalovirus envelope glycoprotein of b-herpesviridae. More recently, a 1 -AT-PDX has been tested in cancerrelated applications. Whereas overexpression of furin and other PCs is associated with a significant increase in metastatic spreading potential and tumor-cell proliferation [8, 38] , a 1 -AT-PDX decreases the invasiveness of head and neck squamous-cell carcinoma by 50% in vitro, and by up to 80% when inoculated in tracheal xenotransplants [15] . Expression of a 1 -AT-PDX from a DNA vector in transfectant tumor xenotransplants of astrocytoma cells also suppresses efficiently tumorigenicity and invasiveness [13] .

Initially, arginine residues were inserted into the reactive site loop of eglin c to target furin and kexin [39] . Then, randomization of strategic eglin c residues that make contact with PC residues outside the catalytic cleft, namely 'adventitious contacts', proved extremely efficient in designing two variants of eglin c that target either furin or PC7 with significant specificity [29] . These two variants, Val33-Arg42-Arg45-Asp49-eglin c (K i Z270 pM for furin and 11 nM for PC7) and Arg42-Arg45-Trp49eglin c (K i Z10 nM for furin and 470 pM for PC7) demonstrate that optimizing flanking contacts by in vitro molecular evolution provides a powerful technique to generate specific inhibitors for each PC. These two derivatives of eglin c show that differences outside but near the active site of PCs favor both binding affinity and specificity of the inhibitor. These eglin c variants might serve as biotechnological tools to dissect the functions of furin and PC7 in the cell and at the membrane, for cocrystalization processes, and as lead compounds to design potent, specific and smaller therapeutic drugs.",

Recently, the inhibitory effects on PCs of two new candidate endogenous inhibitors, the cystatin-related epididymal spermatogenic (CRES) protein [40] and the serine-protease inhibitor 4 SPN4A/4.1 [41] [42] [43] , have been described.",

Thus, pro-domains are dual-function molecules, being the first substrate and first inhibitor encountered by PCs in cells. Evaluation in vitro of the inhibitory capacity of the seven complete pro-domains and of derived, short C-terminal dodecapeptides demonstrates their nanomolar potency and some specificity [44] . However, none is a specific inhibitor of a unique PC. The lack of pro-domain specificity is also observed in inhibition experiments in cell culture. Recently, overexpression in trans in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells of the wild-type PC5/6 prodomain and a selection of key residue mutants efficiently inhibited the processing of an overexpressed substrate, proVEGF-C [45] . However, maturation of proVEGF-C is also decreased significantly by expression of the prodomains of furin, PACE4 and PC7 in CHO cells. To date, there is no indication that specificity of inhibition can be achieved without significant structural modification of pro-domains. Nevertheless, because pro-domains have multiple interactions with PCs outside the catalytic site, bioengineering might result in more specific pro-domains. Co-crystalization of a pro-domain-PC complex might provide the information required to map these interactions.",

In vitro, SPN4A/4.1 inactivates human furin (K i Z13 pM) and PC2 (K i Z 0.92 nM) by a slow-binding mechanism and the formation of a SDS-stable acyl-enzyme complex [41] . This kinetic trapping is typical of the serpin clade. That SPN4A/4.1 exerts potent inhibition on both furin and PC2 indicates a profound lack of selectivity between PCs in general. However, the removal of one amino acid in the RSL (Ala P6 ) generates a reduction of inhibition potency against PC2 (i.e. ID 50 is 27-fold greater) but has no effect on furin. This change in specificity indicates that the RSL of SPN4A/4.1 is more amendable to modifications than other serpins such as a 1 -AT-PDX.",

Because the activity of PCs is affected by metal ions, the first inhibitory chemical compounds investigated were 4 0 -(p-tolyl)-2,2 0 ;6 0 ,2 00 -terpyridine (TTP)-chelated metal salts such as Zn(TTP)Cl 2 and Cu(TTP)Cl 2 . These bind slowly and competitively, and are irreversible inhibitors with low micromolar inhibition constants (IC 50 Z5-10 mM), possibly by a chelate-coordinated interaction of the metal with the catalytic histidine of PCs [46] and Kex2 [47] . Although the free chelate alone is not inhibitory, the chelated metal salts are more potent than the solvated metal ions. Thus, the chelation of metalbased inhibitors to generate a prodrug serves to coordinate the delivery of the drug (either Zn 2C or Cu 2C ) to the active site of PCs. Modification and adjustment of the chelate might lead to greater inhibitory affinity and specificity for PCs. Also, as suggested by the authors, these metallodrugs might be developed further as widespectrum PC blockers for rapid intervention in aggressive viral infections and/or for bacterial detoxification. Improving the specificity of inhibition of small chemical molecules that target the active site might prove difficult given the highly conserved amino acids of PC subsites. However, small chemical molecules, possibly obtained through library screening, might lead to the identification of compounds that can induce allosteric conformational changes that selectively affect PC activity. Presently, the only known PC allosteric sites are Ca 2C -binding sites, but these appear to be unlikely sites for the design of specific PC inhibitors.",
