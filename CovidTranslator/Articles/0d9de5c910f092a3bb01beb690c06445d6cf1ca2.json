In many ways, transmissible gastroenteritis virus of swine and mouse hepatitis virus behave similarly, affecting young animals most severely, spreading very quickly to all animals at risk, and causing major economic losses before control strategies can be put into place. 505 Enteritis a Corona viruses have been associated with infections of the respiratory, enteric, and central nervous systems in monkeys, rats, rabbits, and other species.",

The helical ribonucleoprotein, difficult to discern in electron micrographs, seems to be connected directly to an unusual transmembrane glycoprotein (El) that performs the role normally filled by matrix protein in other enveloped viruses. A second glycoprotein (E2) forms the prominent club-shaped peplomers and is important in cell attachment. The third structural protein is a phosphoprotein (N) which encapsidates the viral RNA to form a long, flexible ribonucleoprotein with helical symmetry (Table 28 -2).",

Other strains, transmitted by the fecal-oral route, cause lesions and disease referable to the intestine. The behavior of the virus in mouse colonies in which it is enzootic has created the impression that infections are chronic and latent, since many experimental manipulations, such as immunosuppression or infection with other agents, will precipitate acute mouse coronavirus disease. However, this is probably because most infections are subclinical, and experimental manipulations that exacerbate disease are applied coincidentally during active infection. Except in the a thy mie nude mouse, infections appear to be acute and self-limited, without viral persistence or a carrier state. Maintenance of infection in a mouse population therefore requires continual exposure of new, susceptible mice, either by introduction from outside or by breeding. If neonatal mice are brought into enzootically infected mouse rooms, they suffer high mortality, but if introduced as weanlings they usually sustain subclinical infections, which maintain the enzootic situation.",
