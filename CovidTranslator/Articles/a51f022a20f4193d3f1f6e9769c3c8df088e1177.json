Despite it has been hypothesized an agreement between lower and upper respiratory specimens for the detection of respiratory pathogens [26] , it is very difficult to formulate assumptions, in some cases, on pathogenicity of detected microorganisms in the upper respiratory tract [27] . This anatomic site is a reservoir of a diverse community of commensal germs which, in a dynamic process and because of individual risk factors or imbalances in the ecosystem, may change their role to pathogens causing respiratory or invasive disease, also in immunocompetent subjects. Furthermore, immunosuppressed subjects or the elderly [19] , who may suffer of pre-existing respiratory tract involvement, pulmonary and cardiac failure, together with low vaccination coverage rates [28] , can lead to hospitalization and intensive care treatment.",
