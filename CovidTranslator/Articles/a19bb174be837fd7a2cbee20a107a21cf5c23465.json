See Table 1 legend for expansion of other abbreviations . a n 5 27. b n 5 23. HAdV has been recognized as an important viral cause of ARDS. The HAdV types most frequently associated with ARDSs include subspecies B1 HAdV-3, HAdV-7, and HAdV-21 and species E HAdV-4. The association of subspecies B2 HAdV (HAdV-11, HAdV-14, HAdV-34, HAdV-35) infection with ARDS has been rarely reported historically, with some of that documentation cover ing military trainees. 15, 18, 19 In China, HAdV-3 and HAdV-7 were the most common types of pathogens. [20] [21] [22] HAdV-11a associated with ARDSs can be traced back to the 1980s 23 and it reemerged as an ARDS pathogen in 2006. 12, 16 HAdV-55 (formerly known as HAdV-11a) was renamed HAdV-55 based on complete genomic sequence data, 13 which clearly showed that HAdV-55 was a recombinant between the HAdV-11 and HAdV-14 ancestral strains.",

Dr Yu: contributed to the care of the adenovirus pneumonia cases, data gathering, analysis of clinical data, and manuscript revision. outbreaks associated with HAdV-14 were reported in other states, such as Oregon, Alaska, and so forth. [27] [28] Today, adenovirus 55, which is related to adenovirus 14, is also emerging as an agent of concern. Because of the absence of cases caused by other HAdV types, Vento et al 29 could only compare pneumonia caused by HAdV-14 with HAdV-14-negative cases. Our study had the advantage of being able to compare the differences in clinical, laboratory, or radiographic abnormalities caused by HAdV-55 and other types of pathogens. We proved that patients with diseases due to HAdV-55 were about 10 years older ( P 5 .027) and had higher PSI scores ( P 5 .030) Our study has several limitations. First, our case series mainly represents the relatively mild and moderate end of the disease. We believe a wider surveillance study is needed to evaluate the spectrum of the disease caused by this emerging pathogen in an affected area in China. In addition, virus isolates were typed only by amplifi cation and sequencing of the hexon gene, and no seroneutralization was performed. More laboratory tests should be carried out to understand the genomics and pathogenic characteristics.",
