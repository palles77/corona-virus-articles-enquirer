Previous research has shown that zirconia nanoparticles can be used as anticancer materials, but their antiviral activity has not been reported. Here, we investigated the antiviral effect of zirconia (ZrO 2 ) nanoparticles (NPs) against a highly pathogenic avian influenza virus. Materials and Methods: In this study, the antiviral effects of ZrO 2 on H5N1 virus were assessed in vivo, and the molecular mechanism responsible for this protection was investigated. Results: Mice treated with 200 nm positively-charged NPs at a dose of 100 mg/kg showed higher survival rates and smaller reductions in weight. 200 nm ZrO 2 activated mature dendritic cells and initially promoted the expression of cytokines associated with the antiviral response and innate immunity. In the lungs of H5N1-infected mice, ZrO 2 treatment led to less pathological lung injury, significant reduction in influenza A virus replication, and overexpression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Conclusion: This antiviral study using zirconia NPs shows protection of mice against highly pathogenic avian influenza virus and suggests strong application potential for this method, introducing a new tool against a wide range of microbial infections.",

Nevertheless, vaccination effectiveness is decreasing as new variants arise through antigenic drifts or shifts. 16 Although some antiviral drugs such as zanamivir (Relenza) and oseltamivir (Tamiflu) are currently in use, the increasing emergence of drug-resistant strains affects their clinical application. 17, 18 Therefore, development of novel broad-spectrum prophylactic and therapeutic agents against IAV is urgently needed.",

            "text": "In recent decades, nanoparticles (NPs) have increasingly been applied as an inexpensive and easy-to-use detection method as well as a promising adjuvant against viral infections due to their unique physical and chemical characteristics and strong activation of the immune system. Due to these structural and chemical properties, nanomaterials have several advantages over bulk materials of the same composition, including small size, high surface area-to-volume ratio, and ease of preparation and modification. NPs can affect immune responses by binding to serum proteins. In previous studies, NPs have shown specific immunomodulatory effects on immune cells, as well as antiviral, antioxidant, and anticancer capabilities. [19] [20] [21] In particular, virus-like particles (alundum and mesoporous silica) have received great attention for potential application as adjuvants. [22] [23] [24] However, because protein or DNA vaccines exhibit poor stability in vivo, most reported NPs have been used only as efficient antigen delivery systems. Although NPs can enhance immunity, few studies to date have focused on the antiviral function of NPs rather than using them only as protein or DNA carriers. 25 The nanomaterial-activated immune response must be overcome when NPs are used as carriers. [26] [27] [28] To date, little attention has been paid to the antiviral effects of NPs without virus-based antigens. Nanoparticles of ZrO 2 , a nano-sized and hollow colloidal metal oxide with controllable thickness, were synthesized using a robust sol-gel process and show superior catalytic activity for many reactions due to the unique physicochemical characteristics of the surface of ZrO 2 . 29,30 ZrO 2 has been widely used as a catalyst in many engineering applications and offers an environmentally-friendly option for chemical and pharmaceutical industries. 30 It is also used as an anticancer agent in the treatment of colon cancer. 31 Despite their potential biomedical applications, few studies have reported on the use of ZrO 2 as an antiviral material.",

The results showed that ZrO 2 with optimal physical and chemical characteristics could reduce mouse mortality, alleviate respiratory pathological changes, and inhibit viral replication in the lungs of H5N1-infected mice. Treatment with ZrO 2 prior to influenza infection caused prompt initiation of the host antiviral response and alleviated the damage induced by cytokine storms during H5N1 infection. This is the first report of an in vivo antiviral effect of ZrO 2 against H5N1 infection, and provides a comprehensive and low-cost method for the protection of humans or animals against various viral infections.",

The hydrolysis of zirconium was triggered in the weakly alkaline environment to induce the growth of small ZrO 2 using SNs as seeds. After 6 h of reaction, a ZrO 2 shell gradually formed on the surface of the SN seeds. The thickness of the shell can be controlled by adjusting the reaction time and the Zr:SN ratio. To remove the SN seed core, NaOH solution (1 mL, 1 M) was added, followed by reaction at 80\u00b0C for approximately 4 h.

ZrO 2 , SNs, and PS NPs with both charges were administered to H5N1-infected mice at 100 mg/kg. As shown in Figure 2B and Figure S1B , compared to the glucose group, in which 4 of 7 mice died, only one mouse died in the group treated with positive NPs. The survival rate of mice in the glucose group was 42.9%, while the P-ZrO 2 and N-ZrO 2 groups had survival rates of 85.7% and 57.1%, respectively. No significant differences were found between glucose and negatively-charged NPs in terms of death rate. These results show that positively-charged NPs confer a higher survival rate and constant body weight, thereby providing enhanced protection against H5N1. Numerous studies have discussed the relationship between NP physicochemical properties and their biological effects. 39, 40 Some reports have shown that particle size plays an important role in the biological effects of NPs, including cellular uptake and toxicity. 41 Size plays a key role in the physiological response, bio-distribution, and elimination of various materials. 42 Furthermore, surface modification of NPs is critical, as it may lead to altered cellular uptake and endosomal escape of NPs. Lin et al reported that particle uptake by cells increased following the same trend as their surface charges. 43 The results of the present study suggest that positively-charged NPs of the appropriate size have a stronger antiviral effect against H5N1 compared to negatively-charged NPs.",

The survival rates of mice in the 25 mg/kg ZrO 2 , 50 mg/kg ZrO 2 , and 100 mg/kg ZrO 2 groups were 100%, 85.7%, and 100%, which were all significantly higher than that in the glucose group (42.9%). Although the survival rates showed modest differences among dosages of NPs, the range of weight loss was reduced with increasing dosage ( Figure 2C and Figure S1C ).

As shown in Figure 3A , we examined histopathological changes in the lungs of mice on day 6. Lung lesions in the glucose group included inflammatory cellular infiltration, necrosis of the mucous epithelium of bronchioles, and interstitial edema. Thickening of alveolar walls and alveolar lumen filled with edema fluid mixed with exfoliated alveolar epithelial cells, erythrocytes, and inflammatory cells was also observed in the control group. However, these symptoms appeared to be mitigated in the ZrO 2 groups. Similar symptoms to those observed in the glucose group were seen in the 25 mg/kg ZrO 2 group, but the lesion severity was lower. Both the 50 mg/kg ZrO 2 and 100 mg/kg ZrO 2 groups showed only interstitial edema; in the surrounding lung tissue, inflammatory cell infiltration was observed in the small blood vessels and bronchi. The lung tissues from mice in the 100 mg/kg ZrO 2 group showed markedly milder symptoms than those from other groups. The control group showed no histopathological changes.

Thus, the proportions of CD40+ CD11c+, CD80+ CD11c+, CD86+ CD11c+, and MHC-II+ CD11c+ cells among mouse T cells on days 1 and 3 after intraperitoneal ZrO 2 administration were determined using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS; Figure 4A ).

Notably, we found that the higher dosage of ZrO 2 resulted in lower expression, which was due to toxicity of ZrO 2 in normal mice.

            "text": "Influenza A virus is one of the most common respiratory pathogens worldwide. In 1997, the first major epidemic of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus H5N1 occurred in Hong Kong. Since then, it has become well known for its potential to cause global pandemics in humans and mammals at all ages with considerable risks of morbidity and high fatality rates; it is now considered a growing threat to public health around the world. 45, 46 To date, it has been classified as a List A disease by the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) and as a Category 1 animal disease in China. A variety of antiviral drugs and vaccines have been adopted to prevent and control influenzainduced illness. However, it remains difficult to limit the spread of these viruses due to their highly contagious nature, frequent mutation of viral genes, and the emergence of resistant influenza strains due to the widespread abuse of antiviral drugs. Therefore, new approaches to fighting influenza virus infection are urgently needed. Due to unique structure and chemical characteristics, including large surface area, strong targeting performance, good biocompatibility, and high adsorption capacity, NPs have many benefits over conventional materials. Therefore, NPs have been widely applied in clinical trials. As carriers of anti-tumor drugs, NPs can significantly improve the curative effects of tumor therapies and reduce toxic drug side effects, making them attractive candidates for cancer therapy. 47, 48 For anti-viral therapy, NPs can be used as adjuvants or carriers to enhance the immune response. 49 However, while NPs are commonly used as efficient antigen delivery systems, their antiviral effects have only been recently reported. Herein, we have demonstrated that NPs alone effectively inhibit viral replication in a mouse model and protect mice from H5N1 infection. Our data further confirm the feasibility of the use of NPs alone as therapeutic agents to control influenza infection. H5N1 influenza virus can cause severe respiratory diseases in humans and mammals. The clinical symptoms include fever, muscle aches, cough, headache, diarrhea, viral pneumonia, encephalitis, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). 50 In the mouse model, it can cause hair thickening, bowed limbs, blindness, trembling, significant weight loss, severe pathological tissue changes, and even death. 51 Previous studies have shown that virusinduced acute lung injury or ARDS is triggered by a cytokine storm and is a serious consequence of inflammation resulting from the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and the recruitment of immune cells to the infected area. 52 Excessive inflammation can cause systemic inflammatory response syndrome, during which the body enters a state of high metabolic activity and energy usage. High levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-6, IFN-\u03b3, MCP-1, and TNF-\u03b1, have been detected in humans and mice infected with highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza virus. 53, 54 In the present study, we investigated the antiviral effects of positively-charged ZrO 2 on IAV in Figure 6 Overview of findings. Positively-charged ZrO 2 of 200 nm size and 100 mg/kg dose conferred protection against H5N1 infection in mice. The mechanisms are related to ZrO 2 -mediated enhancement of innate immunity in the early stage of H5N1 infection. The appropriate nanoparticle treatment could reduce viral load and suppress the inflammatory cytokine storm in the lungs of H5N1-infected mice, thus preventing lung injury and improving the survival rate of the infected mice. a mouse model and the mechanism of action of these NPs. Several studies have shown that positive charges can facilitate retention of NPs in cells for a relatively long time, which is likely related to intracellular agglomeration. The native surface chemistries of NPs also play crucial roles in their exocytosis patterns from cells. Here, we provide the first data that positively-charged ZrO 2 NPs can downregulate the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and thereby alleviate the inflammatory response, making them effective anti-inflammatory agents against highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza virus.",

Previous researches by our team have researched the systemic toxicity of ZrO 2 NPs and demonstrated that dosages of ZrO 2 in the range of 100-350 mg/kg are safe for effectively clinical use. 33 However, we found that 100 mg/kg ZrO 2 NPs seemed to have a mild adverse reaction in H5N1-infected mice, which only showed the slightly low spirits just on day 1 after intraperitoneal administration. Thus, we consider that this clinical phenomenon may lead to the lower expression of immune indicators in spleen of the 100 mg/kg ZrO 2 group. Compared to 25 mg/kg ZrO 2 NPs or 50 mg/kg ZrO 2 NPs, 100 mg/kg ZrO 2 NPs group showed the most dramatic increases with time increasing, indicating its growing powerful immune responses. We suppose that 100 mg/kg ZrO 2 NPs group will show the better immune responses on day 7 or day 9 after intraperitoneal administration, which will be further investigated in future studies. Due to that NPs could be carried into the lung through the circulation, we speculate that 100 mg/kg ZrO 2 NPs can be carried into lung most effectively after viral infection when compared to 25 mg/kg ZrO2 NPs and 50 mg/kg ZrO 2 NPs, and then 100 mg/kg ZrO 2 NPs activate the antiviral responses in lung and eventually provide best protection for mice to fight against virus.",

The well-defined size and shape of 100 (A), 100 (B), and 200 nm (C) ZrO 2 nanoparticles (NPs) allowed for good monodispersity in 5% glucose solution. The scale bar is 100 nm. Positively-charged ZrO 2 at a dosage of 100 mg/kg increased survival of H5N1-infected mice. ZrO 2 of different diameters (100, 150, and 200 nm) (A), with different charges (positive and negative) (B) or at different dosages(25,50, and 100 mg/kg) (C) were administered twice intraperitoneally to mice, one day apart. On the second day of NP administration, the viral challenge was administered, with triple the LD50 of H5N1. Body weights were determined every 2 days. *, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01; ***, P < 0.001 and compared to the glucose group.Positively-charged ZrO 2 NPs of 200 nm reduced lung injury and viral replication in H5N1-infected mice. (A) Representative lung sections from each group were stained with H&E (400\u00d7) and scored in a blind study. The black triangles show alveolar lumen flooded with edema fluid and mixed with exfoliated alveolar epithelial cells, inflammatory cells, and erythrocytes. Arrows represent interstitial edema and inflammatory cellular infiltration around small blood vessels and bronchioles. Empty triangles indicate reduction in the number of mucous epithelial cells in bronchioles. (B) Representative lung sections from each group were stained using IHC (400\u00d7) and scored in a blind study. Arrows indicate positive cells. (C) Expression levels of HA genes were determined via qPCR and their PFU values were determined through plaque assay.These results were obtained from three distinct animals and are representative of three independent experiments. *, P < 0.05;**, P < 0.01 and ***, P < 0.001 compared to the glucose group.",
