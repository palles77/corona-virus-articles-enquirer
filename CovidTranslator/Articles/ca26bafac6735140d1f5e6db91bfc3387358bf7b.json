Specifically, the count of CD4 + and CD8 + lymphocytes were both significantly reduced in the dead group, indicating the suppressed cellular immunity in these patients. At the same time, more severe inflammatory reactions might exist in the dead cases as represented by significant increase of inflammatory markers. In addition, more frequent coagulation disorders, myocardial injuries and bacterial infections were found in the dead group compared to the survival group, as revealed by the related markers. Compared with the survivors, serum concentrations of urea and creatinine were higher in the dead, indicating worse renal functions, although the median values were still within the normal range.",

Dyspnea and high respiration rates were probably manifestations for impaired respiratory function and might reflect the severity of lung lesions caused by infection or inflammation. The impaired oxygenation caused by COVID-19 brings great challenge to the cardiopulmonary function, especially for the elderly. Comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease and COPD could greatly increase the vulnerability of elderly patients when faced with this disease. It is reasonable that these factors could predict poor outcomes. ARDS, the fundamental pathophysiology of severe viral pneumonia, could be a marker of rapid progress of the disease. Once ARDS occurred, the 28-day mortality would be near 50% 10 . Consistent with that, in the present study, the occurrence of ARDS was an extremely strong predictor of fatal outcomes, which could increase the probability of death by a factor of 29.3. In laboratory tests, lymphocytopenia were found in around 60% of the overall patients and in 81.5% of the dead patients, which was similar with previous studies on SARS 11 . It has been reported that lymphocytes could be killed by coronavirus due to the damage of the cytoplasmic components or apoptosis 12, 13 . The degree of lymphocytopenia might reveal either the severity of virus invasion or the condition of the antiviral immunity, thus could predict the outcome.",

Among the vital signs, increased heart rate and respiration rate could increase the likelihood of fatal outcomes. For the laboratory tests, white blood cell count (HR 1.16, CI 1.14-1.20, P < 0.001) and prothrombin time (HR 1.17, CI 1.13-1.24, P < 0.001) were shown to increase the risk of death, and a low level of lymphocytes was a strong predictor of poor outcome (HR 0.10, CI 0.04-0.22, P < 0.001). Significances were also found in other factors such as procalcitonin and hypersensitive troponin I. However, for those factors the HR was around 1.0, which limited their values as predictors.",
