Higher levels of both specific S~Cr release and IFN were obtained in the assays containing PK-15-TGE cells. Co-cultivation of PBL from newborn piglets with PK-15-TGE cells yielded similar levels of IFN to those produced by co-cultivation of adult PBL and PK-15-TGE cells, but lower levels of IFN were produced by co-cultivation with uninfected PK-15 cells. Pretreatment of adult PBL with IFN augmented their SCMC effector activity for both PK-15 and PK-15-TGE cells in the S~Cr release assay. Pretreatment of the PK-15-TGE target cells with IFN did not affect their release of S*Cr in the SCMC reaction, while IFN pretreatment of PK-15 targets protected them against SCMC.",

SCMC by porcine iymphocytes against human myeloid leukemia (K562) cells (Kim et al., 1980; Norley and Wardley, 1983) , against IB.RS.2 cells and GBK cells infected with pseudorabies virus has also been described. We have shown that PBL and IEL from neonatal piglets are incapable of acting as effector cells in SCMC against TGEV-infected targets (Cepica and Derbyshire, 1984a) , as are neonatal PBL against K562 cells (Kim et al., 1980) . The adoptive transfer of PBL from an adult pig to inbred neonatal recipients established SCMC effector activity in the PBL and IEL of the latter (Cepica and Derbyshire, 1984b) , and challenge of the recipient piglets with TGEV indicated that the adoptive transfer of PBL increased their resistance to infection, suggesting that SCMC may be an important defence mechanism against this enteric virus. This finding raised the possibility of activating SCMC effector activity in the newborn, thereby increasing resistance to neonatal viral infection.",

This was conducted with PBL isolated from neonatal piglets, as well as from adults, as effector cells, and with PK-15 and PK-15-TGE target cells. Both IFN pretreated (as above) and untreated target and effector cells were used. Four replicates of the experiment were done, with PBL from different animals. The results are shown in Table II . PBL from newborn piglets bound to either target cell with the same frequency as PBL from SCMC competent adult pigs, and IFN treatment of either effector or target cells had no effect on target-binding frequency. The stimulatory effect of pretreatment with IFN on the SCMC effect/Jr activity of adult PBL for both PK-15-TGE and PK-15 (:ells was confirmed, since the mean percentages of lysed targets were significantly greater (P < 0.05) by the t-test when IFN pretreated PBL were used. Untreated PBL from newborn piglets failed to mediate SCMC against either target cell, but they were rendered cytotoxic by pretreatment with IFN. IFN pretreatment of PK-15-TGE did not influence their susceptibility to SCMC, while, as in the S~Cr release assay, IFN pretreatment of the uninfected PK-15 cells resulted in significant (P < 0.05) protection against SCMC.

More IFN resulted from the mixed cultures containing TGEV-infected target cells than from those containing uninfected PK-15 cells. Similar results were obtained by Trinchieri et al. (1977 Trinchieri et al. ( , 1978 and by Santoli et al. (1978) with human lyre-phocytes and various virus-infected cells. The finding that PBL from newborn piglets, which we have shown previously to be unable to mediate SCMC (Cepica and Derbyshire, 1984a) , bind to target cells with the same relative frequency as those from older SCMC-competent pigs, and respond by IFN production in mixed cultures, suggests that the lack of SCMC effector activity in newborn piglets is not associated with a lack of effector cells or their inability to produce IFN, but possibly with a lack of the stimulation needed for autologous IFN production in vivo.",

Of greater significance was our finding that lymphocytes from newborn piglets, normally inactive as SCMC effectors, could also be stimulated by IFN, though to a lesser degree than lymphocytes from SCMC competent older pigs. This observation suggests that it might be possible to stimulate SCMC incompetent lymphocytes in neonates in vivo by the treatment of piglets with IFN or IFN inducers.",

This was shown to be selective, in that the TGEV-infec~d PK-15 cells were not affected in their susceptibility to SCMC by pretreatment with IFN, whereas the uninfected PK-15 cells were protected against SCMC by IFN pretreatment. It is apparent that the effects of IFN were not mediated at the level of effector-target recognition, since the percentage of target-binding lymphocytes was similar, irrespective of IFN pretreatment of either target or effector cells. It could be speculated that if IFN acts in a similar manner in vivo on target and effector cells, it could be a powerful tool in the regulation of SCMC, by stimulating SCMC against virus-infected cells and protecting uninfected cells against SCMC.",
