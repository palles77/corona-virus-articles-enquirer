            "text": "Word Count: 497 27 28 Data on SARS and MERS in pregnancy are sparse. For SARS, the largest series of 12 71 pregnancies had a case-fatality rate of 25%. Complications included ARDS in four, disseminated 72 intravascular coagulopathy in three, renal failure in three, secondary bacterial pneumonia in two, 73 and sepsis in two patients. Mechanical ventilation was three times more likely among pregnant 74 compared to nonpregnant women. Among seven first-trimester infections, four ended in 75 spontaneous abortion. Four of five women with SARS after 24 weeks gestation delivered 76 preterm. For MERS-CoV, there were 13 case reports in pregnant women, of which two were 77 asymptomatic, identified as part of a contact investigation; three patients (23%) died. Two 78 pregnancies ended in fetal demise and two were born preterm. No evidence of in utero 79 transmission was seen in SARS or MERS. 80 Currently, no coronavirus-specific treatments have been approved by the US Food and 81 Drug Administration. Because COVID-19 might increase the risk for pregnancy complications, 82 management should optimally be in a health care facility with close maternal and fetal 83 monitoring. Principles of management of COVID-19 in pregnancy include early isolation, 84 aggressive infection control procedures, oxygen therapy, avoidance of fluid overload, empiric 85 antibiotics (secondary to bacterial infection risk), SARS-CoV-2 and co-infection testing, fetal 86 and uterine contraction monitoring, early mechanical ventilation for progressive respiratory 87 failure, individualized delivery planning, and a team-based approach with multi-specialty 88 consultations. 89 Information on the COVID-19 is increasing rapidly. Clinicians should continue to follow 90 the CDC website to stay up-to-date with the latest information.",

Limited data 51 are available about COVID-19 during pregnancy; however, information on illnesses associated 52 with other highly pathogenic coronaviruses (i.e., severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and 53 the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)) might provide insights into COVID-19's effects 54 during pregnancy. 55 Coronaviruses cause illness ranging in severity from the common cold to severe 56 respiratory illness and death. Currently the primary epidemiologic risk factors for COVID-19 57 include travel from mainland China (especially Hubei Province) or close contact with infected 58 individuals within 14 days of symptom onset. Data suggest an incubation period of ~5 days 59 (range-2-14 days). Average age of hospitalized patients has been 49-56 years, with a third to half 60 with an underlying illness. Children have been rarely reported. Men were more frequent among 61 hospitalized cases (54-73%) . Frequent manifestations include fever, cough, myalgia, headache, 62 and diarrhea. Abnormal testing includes abnormalities on chest radiographic imaging, 63 lymphopenia, leukopenia and thrombocytopenia. Initial reports suggest that acute respiratory 64 distress syndrome (ARDS) develops in 17-29% of hospitalized patients. Overall case fatality rate 65 appears to be ~1%; however, early data may overestimate this rate. In two reports describing 18 66 pregnancies with COVID-19, all were infected in the third trimester, and clinical findings were 67 similar to those in non-pregnant adults. Fetal distress and preterm delivery were seen in some 68 cases. All but two pregnancies were cesarean deliveries, and testing for SARS-CoV-2 was 69 negative on all babies tested. The emergence of a coronavirus not previously seen in humans, first reported in Wuhan, China, 97 on December 31, 2019, has attracted much interest throughout the world. Since then, the number 98 of reported cases has increased rapidly, with more than 51,800 laboratory-confirmed cases and Coronaviruses are single-stranded RNA, nonsegmented, enveloped viruses, which cause 112 illness ranging in severity from the common cold to severe and fatal illness. The term 113 coronavirus derives from the Latin word \"corona\", which means crown or \"halo\"; that 114 designation arises from the appearance of coronavirus virions viewed by electron microscopy, 115 where the virus particles display a crown-like fringe typically referred to as \"spikes\" (Figure 3 ).",

Previous data on SARS and MERS suggest that clinical findings during pregnancy can 303 range from no symptoms to severe disease and death. The most common symptoms of COVID- 304 19 are fever and cough, with more than 80% of hospitalized patients presenting with these 305 symptoms. 36 In a recent study by Chen et al. 44 , nine women diagnosed with COVID-19 during 306 the third trimester of pregnancy were reported.

Five had lymphopenia. All had pneumonia, but 309 none required mechanical ventilation, and none died. All women had a cesarean delivery, and 310 Apgars were 8-9 at 1 minute and 9-10 at 5 minutes.

Thus, at this time, it is unknown if SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted from mother-390 to-fetus. Given the current lack of information, it seems reasonable to assume that a newborn 391 born to a mother with COVID-19 at delivery could possibly be infected, either in utero or 392 perinatally, and thus should be placed in isolation to avoid exposure to other newborns. Although 393 the ideal setting for a healthy infant is within a healthy mother's room, temporary separation of 394 an ill mother and her infant, as was recommended during pandemic H1N1, 51 seems prudent.",

It is unclear if infection can be transmitted from fomites. Fecal-oral transmission might be 273 possible, given that SARS-CoV-2 has been identified in stool specimens40 and SARS-CoV might274    have been transmitted in this manner.41 The basic reproduction number, R0 (the average number275 of people who will become infected from a single infected person in a population where all 276 persons are susceptible) is affected by factors such as the duration of infectivity, the 277 transmissibility of the pathogen, and the number of susceptible contacts. Measles, which is 278 highly infective, has a R0 of 12-18, while 2009 H1N1 influenza and SARS have an R0 of 1.2-1.6 279 and 2-5, respectively. 42 Current estimates of R0 for SARS-CoV-2 places it at 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 280 3.9) 33 As with SARS and MERS, nosocomial transmission is playing a key role in transmission, 281 presumed to be responsible for infection of 29% of affected health professionals and 12% of 282 hospitalized patients in a recent study. 37 283 284 Implications of COVID-19 for pregnant women 285 In the midst of a rapidly evolving outbreak that could have significant effects on our 286 public health and medical infrastructure, the unique needs of pregnant women should be included 287 in preparedness and response plans. In previous outbreaks, clinicians have at times been reluctant 288 to treat or vaccinate pregnant women because of concerns for fetal safety. 43 It is critical that 289 pregnant women not be denied potentially life-saving interventions in the context of a serious 290 infectious disease threat unless there is a compelling reason to exclude them. As with all 291 decisions regarding treatment during pregnancy, carefully weighing of the benefits of 292 interventions for the mother and fetus with potential risks is necessary. As surveillance systems 293 for cases of COVID-19 are established, it is essential that information on pregnancy status, as 294 well as maternal and fetal outcomes, be collected and reported. 295 Susceptibility to and severity of COVID-19 in pregnancy 296 Although data are limited, there is no evidence from other severe coronavirus infections 297 (SARS or MERS) that pregnant women are more susceptible to infection with coronavirus. Thus 298 far, in this outbreak of novel coronavirus infection, more men have been affected than 299women.32,33,36,37 This observed gender difference could be due to differences in reporting, 300 susceptibility, exposure, or recognition and diagnosis of infection. There are no data to inform 301 whether pregnancy increases susceptibility to COVID-19.",

Clinical 313 presentation of COVID-19 was similar to that seen in nonpregnant patients. Among the nine 314 pregnancies, intrauterine fetal distress was noted in six, seven were cesarean deliveries, and six 315 infants were born preterm. Based on these limited reports, and the available data from other 316 respiratory pathogens such as SARS and influenza, it is unknown whether pregnant women with 317 COVID-19 will experience more severe disease.Travel guidance for pregnant women319    Travel recommendations have been instituted to limit exposure to persons in the United320 States. All persons, including pregnant women, should not travel to China. On February 2, 2020, 321 the U.S. State Department upgraded their travel advisory to level 4, the highest level of travel 322 advisory. Obstetric providers should obtain a detailed travel history for all patients and should 323 specifically ask about travel in the past 14 days to areas experiencing widespread transmission of 324 SARS-CoV-2. Currently this is limited to China, but this situation is rapidly evolving and 325 obstetricians should stay alert to the global situation by consulting the CDC website and 326 following media coverage. 327 Vaccination in pregnancy 328 There is currently no vaccine to prevent COVID-19. Since posting of a SARS-CoV-2 329 virus genetic sequence online on January 10, 2020, multiple organizations, including the 330 National Institutes of Health, have been working to rapidly develop a COVID-19 vaccine. 331 Development of this vaccine builds on and benefits from work on SARS and MERS vaccines. 46 332 However, it is not known how quickly a safe and effective vaccine may be readily available. 333 Infection control measures and diagnostic testing 334 All patients, including pregnant women, should be evaluated for fever and signs and 335 symptoms of a respiratory infection. Ideally, screening procedures begin before arrival on a labor 336 and delivery unit or prenatal care clinic. For example, when scheduling appointments, patients 337 should be instructed what to do if they have respiratory symptoms on the day of their 338 appointment or if a patient calls triage prior to presentation, respiratory signs and symptoms 339 should be assessed over the telephone. Those patients with respiratory symptoms should be 340 separated from other waiting patients and a facemask should be placed on them. Patients who 341 meet criteria for a Person Under Investigation (Box 1) should be immediately placed in an 342 Airborne Infection Isolation Rooms (single-patient rooms at negative pressure). Once in 343 isolation, the patient's facemask may be removed. Health care personnel should adhere to 344 standard, contact and airborne precautions. Infection control personnel and local/state health 345 departments should be notified immediately; local/state health departments can help to arrange 346 testing of relevant specimens (upper and lower respiratory specimens and serum are currently 347 recommended; other specimens [stool and urine] may also be sent). 348 Management of COVID-19 in pregnancy 349 General principles regarding management of COVID-10 during pregnancy include early 350 isolation, aggressive infection control procedures, testing for SARS-CoV-2 and co-infection, 351 oxygen therapy as needed, avoidance of fluid overload, empiric antibiotics (due to secondary 352 bacterial infection risk), fetal and uterine contraction monitoring, early mechanical ventilation 353 for progressive respiratory failure, individualized delivery planning, and a team-based approach 354 with multi-specialty consultations (Box 2). Team-based management is recommended for 355 pregnancies managed in a health care facility and should include a determination of the optimal 356 clinical unit on which to provide care. Ability to provide surveillance for early detection of a 357 worsening maternal course of illness, as well as an ability to monitor for evidence of obstetric 358 complications (e.g., preterm labor or fetal compromise), are needed. 359 Changes in fetal heart rate pattern may be an early indicator of maternal respiratory 360 deterioration. Based on experience with SARS and MERS, severe respiratory failure might occur 361 in pregnant women, and in the most severe cases, mechanical ventilation might not be sufficient 362 to support adequate oxygenation. If that occurs, limited literature suggests a potential role of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in pregnancy; use should only be considered in 364 centers that have experience with this technique. 47 Whether delivery provides benefit to a 365 critically ill mother is unknown; decisions regarding delivery should consider the gestational age 366 of the fetus and should be made in conjunction with the neonatologist. 48 367 There are currently no antiviral medications approved by the US Food and Drug 368 Administration for treatment of COVID-19, although broad-spectrum antivirals used in animal 369 models of MERS are being evaluated for activity against SARS-CoV-2. 46 Corticosteroids for the 370 treatment of coronavirus-associated pneumonia should be avoided unless other indications are 371 present because they were not shown to be beneficial in MERS and could lead to delayed 372 MERS-CoV clearance. 49 Therefore, decisions about the use of corticosteroids for fetal lung 373 maturity should be made in consultation with infectious disease specialists and maternal-fetal 374 medicine consultants. All guidance should be considered subject to revision as additional data on 375 pregnant women with COVID-19 become available. 376 Care of infants born to mothers with COVID-19 377 Although the limited experience with newborn evaluations after delivery with SARS and 378 MERS has not identified cases of maternal-to-fetal transmission, reports have appeared in the 379 media of a 30-hour infant who was diagnosed with COVID-19, suggesting the possibility of in 380 utero transmission. 50 However, insufficient information is included in media reports to rule out 381 perinatal or postnatal modes of transmission. Data from the recent case series published by Chen 382 et al. 44 and Zhu et al. 45 of 18 women (19 infants) infected in the third trimester of pregnancy with 383 SARS-CoV-2 identified no laboratory evidence of vertical transmission. Testing of amniotic 384 fluid, cord blood, and neonatal throat swab samples was negative for SARS-CoV-2 in the six 385 patients reported by Chen et al.",

Much is unknown about the virus and its effects, including its modes of transmission, 410 the basic reproduction number, risk factors for illness, and case fatality rate. Although cases are 411 primarily in China, it is highly likely that there will be additional global spread of the virus. At 412 the present time, limited data are available on pregnant women with COVID-19 on which to base 413 recommendations for pregnancy-specific care; however, early reports and lessons from SARS, 414 MERS, and other respiratory infections suggest that pregnant women could have a severe clinical 415 course. Surveillance systems for cases of COVID-19 need to include information on pregnancy 416 status, as well as maternal and fetal outcomes. It is important to be vigilant about the spread of 417 the disease and be able to provide rapid implementation of outbreak control and management 418 measures once the virus reaches a community. Standard interventions to manage any severe 419 respiratory infection is the foundation of care for any pregnant woman with COVID-19 and 420 should be implemented aggressively in a team-based care model.421 422",
