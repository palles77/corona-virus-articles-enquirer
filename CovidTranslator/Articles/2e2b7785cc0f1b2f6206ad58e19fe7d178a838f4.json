            "text": "The potential role(s) of cytokines in the reduction of infectious virus and persistent viral infection in the central nervous system was examined by determining the kinetics of cytokine mRNA expression following infection with the neurotropic JHM strain of mouse hepatitis virus. Mice were infected with an antibody escape variant which produces a nonlethal encephalomyelitis and compared to a clonal virus population which produces a fulminant fatal encephalomyelitis. Infection with both viruses induced the accumulation of mRNAs associated with Th1-and Th2-type cytokines, including IFN-g, IL-4, and IL-10. Peak mRNA accumulations were coincident with the clearance of virus and there was no obvious differences between lethally and nonlethally infected mice. TNF-a mRNA was induced more rapidly in lethally infected mice compared to mice undergoing a nonfatal encephalomyelitis. Rapid transient increases in the mRNAs encoding IL-12, iNOS, IL-1a, IL-1b, and IL-6 occurred following infection. Nonlethal infections were associated with increased IL-12, IL-1b, and earlier expression of IL-6, while lethal infections were associated with increased iNOS and IL-1a mRNA. These data suggest a rapid but differential response within the central nervous system cells to infection by different JHMV variants. However, neither the accumulation nor kinetics of induction provide evidence to distinguish lethal infections from nonlethal infections leading to a persistent infection. Accumulation of both Th1 and Th2 cytokines in the central nervous system of JHMVinfected mice is consistent with the participation of both cytokines and cell immune effectors during resolution of acute viral-induced encephalomyelitis. \u1b67 1997 Academic Press antibody and a pattern of Th2 cytokines within the CNS 1 To whom correspondence and reprint requests should be addressed.",

Similar to the recent data T cells are activated during infection. IL-4 mRNA accumulation in the CNS corresponds to infiltration of Th2 cells demonstrating low levels of iNOS in the CNS of both nude mice and mice deficient in IFN-g , (Cua et al., 1995) and kinetic analysis suggests that T cells expressing Th2 cytokine profiles are recruited into iNOS mRNA in immunodeficient mice was approximately 50% the levels detected in the CNS of intact mice at Day the CNS with nearly equal kinetics in both lethally and sublethally infected mice (Fig. 5A) .

However, no significant differences ences in mouse strains or the selective tropism of the virus is not known. It is interesting that although IL-10 is were found comparing mRNA levels in immunodeficient mice to intact mice. This may suggest that JHMV infection secreted by activated microglia in vitro (Lodge and Sriram, 1996) , no IL-10 mRNA was detected in sham-induces transcription of IL-12 mRNA in CNS cells. In addition, 2.2v-1 infects predominantly, but not exclu-infected or immunodeficient mice.
