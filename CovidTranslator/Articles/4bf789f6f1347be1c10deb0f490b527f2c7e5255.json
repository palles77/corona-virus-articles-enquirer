In addition to the secretin proteins, 10215 other inner and outer membrane proteins compose the full secretion apparatus, many with as yet unknown function. In some bacteria, certain proteins are shared between the pilus complex and the type II system.

They are multi-subunit transmembrane channels with an aqueous pore around 0.4 nm diameter, with a negatively charged region internally (the 'selectivity filter') that blocks the passage of anions. The alpha subunits form the pore itself, the beta subunits vary between tissues and regulate the sensitivity. The channel opens in response to a small depolarization of the cell (usually caused by an approaching action potential), by a multistep process. Around 1000 sodium ions pass in the next millisecond, before the channel spontaneously closes (an event with single-step kinetics). The channel is then refractory to further depolarizations until returned to near the resting potential. There are around 100 channels per mm 2 in unmyelinated axons; in myelinated axons, they are concentrated at the nodes of Ranvier. Mutations are associated with various forms of epilepsy, muscular disorders (periodic paralysis, myotonia), long QT syndrome, Brugada's syndrome-1, erythromelalgia, congenital insensitivity to pain and paroxysmal extreme pain disorder.

STAT1 (750aa) mediates signalling by interferons alpha and gamma whereas STAT2 (851aa) is only activated by Type 1 interferons. STAT3 (770aa) binds to the interleukin-6 (IL-6)-responsive elements identified in the promoters of various acute-phase protein genes, STAT4 (748aa) is involved in IL12 signalling. Several others are known in humans and in a range of other metazoa. Mutations in STAT1 affect innate immunity, mutations in STAT3 are associated with hyper-IgE syndrome (Job's syndrome).

Synapsis results in the autophosphorylation of DNA-PKcs, which is required to make the DNA ends available for ligation. synaptobrevins Small integral membrane proteins of synaptic vesicles that have v-SNARE coiled-coil homology domains and interact with target-SNARES. Two neuronal isoforms, VAMP1 (118aa) and VAMP2 (116aa) are known that bind SNAPs and syntaxin. Clostridial toxins encoding zinc endopeptidases, such as tetanus toxin and botulinum toxin, block synaptic release by degrading synaptobrevins. Other related proteins occur in other tissues serving a similar role in vesicle targeting through interactions with SNAREs. VAMP3 (100aa) is cellubrevin and involved in protein recycling. VAMP4 (141) is involved in removing an inhibitor (probably synaptotagmin-4) of calcium-triggered exocytosis during the maturation of secretory granules. VAMP5 (myobrevin, 102aa) is found in muscle. VAMP7 (synaptobrevinlike protein 1, 220aa) is ubiquitous and involved in endosome-lysosome transport. VAMP8 (endobrevin, 100aa) is associated with dense-granule secretion in platelets. VAMP-like proteins are found in a wide range of organisms, including protozoa, yeasts and Arabidopsis.",

In plants they are important intermediates in the sulphur cycle.sulphonylurea receptor The sulphonylurea receptor-1 (ABCC8, SUR-1, 1581aa) is an ABC transporter that regulates glucose-induced insulin secretion by controlling K 1 -ATP channel activity of the pancreatic beta-cell membrane. They form a stoichiometric complex with 4 pore-forming inwardly-rectifying Kir6.2 molecules to produce the ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channels in neurons and neuroendocrine cells. SURs have two nucleotide-binding folds that sense changes in the metabolic status (ATP/ADP ratio) of the cell. Glibenclamide, a sulphonyl urea drug, binds to SUR and labelled forms of the drug can be used to show the distribution of the receptors.sulphonylureas Group of drugs which act by augmenting insulin secretion. Used in the treatment of Type II diabetes. Examples include glibenclamide which is the sulphonylurea most commonly used in experimental studies.

SUMO Small ubiquitin-related modifier proteins See sumoylation.sumoylation Post-transcriptional modification of a protein by the conjugation of SUMO (small ubiquitinrelated modifier) proteins: stabilizes some proteins and may alter subcellular localization. Three different SUMO proteins are conjugated to proteins, SUMO-1, SUMO-2 and SUMO-3. The SUMO-2 and SUMO-3 genes are closely related, with 86% sequence identity while SUMO-1 is less closely related with about 50% sequence identity with SUMO-2 and SUMO-3. SUMO-1 (101aa) conjugates as a monomer, while SUMO-2 (95aa) and SUMO-3 (103aa) are conjugated to proteins as higher molecular weight polymers. Targets include p53, ran-Gap and various transcription factors, including C/EBP proteins and c-Myb.of nuclear pore complexes and linkage of the nucleoskeleton with the cytoskeleton (the LINC complex). Interact with lamins and with nesprins. They were originally cloned by homology with C. elegans protein UNC-84 that is involved in nuclear migration/positioning. In S. cerevisiae Sun 4 (septation protein SUN4, 420aa) is involved in the process of septum formation. The NSUN family (NOL1/NOP2/Sun domain family) are S-adenosyl-L-methionine-dependent methyltransferases, for example, Nsun2 (tRNA (cytosine-5-)-methyltransferase NSUN2, EC 2.1.1.29, 767aa).superantigen Antigens, mostly of microbial origin, that activate all those T-lymphocytes that have a T-cell receptor with a particular V\u03b2 sequence; as a consequence superantigens activate large numbers of T-cells and elicit an inappropriately strong immune response. Superantigens are presented on MHC Class II, but are not processed, and bind with high affinity but not in the normal peptide-binding groove of the MHC molecule. Presentation is not MHCrestricted. Staphylococcal enterotoxins are the best known superantigens and are pyrogenic, increase host susceptibility to endotoxic shock, suppress immunoglobulin production and stimulate CD4 1 T-cells. Superantigen diseases include Staphylococcus aureus food poisoning, toxic shock syndrome, and scarlet fever (produced by erythrogenic toxin of Streptococcus pyogenes). The Mls gene product in mice can act as a self-superantigen.supercoiling In circular DNA or closed loops of DNA, twisting of the DNA about its own axis changes the number of turns of the double helix. If twisting is in the opposite direction to the turns of the double helix, i.e. anticlockwise, the DNA strands will either have to unwind or the whole structure will twist or supercoil -termed negative supercoiling. If twisting is in the same direction as the helix, clockwise, which winds the DNA up more tightly, positive supercoiling is generated. DNA that shows no supercoiling is said to be relaxed. Supercoiling in circular DNA can be detected by electrophoresis because supercoiled DNA migrates faster than relaxed DNA. Circular DNA is commonly negatively supercoiled and the DNA of eukaryotes largely exists as supercoils associated with protein in the nucleosome. The degree of supercoiling can be altered by topoisomerases.superhelix A supercoil of a molecule, like DNA, that is already coiled.SUPERMAN A transcriptional regulator (204aa) inArabidopsis that acts indirectly to prevent the B class homeotic proteins APETALA3 and PISTILLATA from acting during flower development.",
