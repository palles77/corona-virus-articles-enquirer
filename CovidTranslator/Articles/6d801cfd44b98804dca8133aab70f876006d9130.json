The virus is highly contagious and affects pigs of all ages and breeds. PEDV has been reported in many countries since it was first identified in Britain and Belgium [3] . In China, PEDV is more prevalent than porcine rotavirus and transmissible gastroenteritis virus, which also cause viral diarrhea in pigs [4] . The most common practice for preventing PEDV infection is transfer of passive immunity from sows to nursing piglets [5] . Pregnant sows are vaccinated with inactivated or attenuated vaccines and antibodies are passively transferred in the colostrum [5] . This transfer of PEDV immunity is affected by the length of time when the piglets are suckling and the antibody titer in the sow colostrum [5] . Inactivated vaccines are relatively expensive and are inefficient at inducing a mucosal immune response. Given the prevalence of PEDV infection, novel preventive measures are urgently needed [6] [7] [8] [9] .",

            "text": "PEDV is a member of the genus Alphacoronavirus, family Coronaviridae, order Nidovirales [10] . It is a pleomorphic enveloped virus containing a positive-stranded RNA genome, which is approximately 28 kb in length and has a 5\u2032 cap and a 3\u2032 polyadenylated tail. The virus contains four structural proteins: spike (S), integral membrane (M), envelope (E), and nucleocapsid (N) [11] . The S protein, a type I membrane glycoprotein, is required for virus entry Abstract Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) causes significant loss to the swine industry. The emergence of novel PEDV strains in recent years has decreased the effectiveness of PEDV vaccines. We have developed a live recombinant vaccine, a swinepox virus vector that expresses a truncated S protein (rSPV-St) from a recent PEDV strain, SQ2014, and evaluated its immunogenicity and effectiveness in a swine model. Vaccination of swine with rSPV-St elicited a robust antibody response specific for the homologous PEDV SQ2014. Serum IgA titers in rSPV-St-vaccinated animals were significantly higher than in those immunized with inactivated vaccines. The effectiveness of antibodies induced by the rSPV-St vaccine in protection against PEDV was tested in a passive-transfer model in which piglets were challenged with the homologous virus SQ2014 and the heterologous strain CV777. When challenged with the homologous virus, sera from rSPV-St vaccination provided complete protection. However, sera from rSPV-St vaccination did not provide any protection against the heterologous virus challenge. Amino acid sequence differences in the S proteins of the two into host cells and binding to the viral receptor porcine amino peptidase. There are two domains in the S protein, S1 (amino acids [aa] 1-735) and S2 (from 736 to the last aa). Previous work has shown that neutralizing epitopes are mainly located in S1 [11] [12] [13] [14] . The antigenic variation in the S protein, especially in the S1 domain, makes prevention of PEDV infection more difficult [15] [16] [17] . However, based on the surface expression and the function of the S protein, S1 is an attractive target for genetically engineering a PEDV vaccine [18] .",

Data are shown as the mean \u00b1 S.D Fig. 4 Efficacy of passively transferred PEDV immunity in piglets. Piglets were fed immune sera from pigs vaccinated with inactivated SQ2014, inactivated CV777, rSPV-Sa, wtSPV or PBS. Survival was followed for 12 days after challenge with either (A) SQ2014 or (B) CV777 rSPV-St fed sera from pigs vaccinated with rSPV-St and inactivated vaccines (inactivated SQ2014, inactivated CV777) were fully protected against the homologous virus challenge, while all animals succumbed to the challenge with the heterologous virus ( Fig. 4A and B , Tables 1 and 2) . As expected, animals fed sera from pigs vaccinated with wtSPV or PBS exhibited clinical signs including diarrhea, loss of appetite, reduced weight gain, and increased mental instability, and all animals died between 8 and 10 days post-challenge. Histological examination revealed no lesions in the intestinal tissues from piglets in the homologous challenge groups. However, evident histological changes were observed in tissues from animals that died from the heterologous virus challenge, as well as those that received sera from wtSPV or PBS vaccination but died from either virus challenge. These changes included degeneration and necrosis of intestinal microvilli and infiltration of inflammatory cells (Fig. 5 , Table 3 ). Taken together, these results show that the sera from the rSPV-St and inactivated-SQ2014-immunized animals provided complete protection against infection with the PEDV SQ2014 strain upon passive transfer.",

The vaccine induced a robust immune response to the S antigen of PEDV in pigs and provided full protection against homologous challenge with wt SQ2014. Our results suggest that rSPV-St is a promising live vaccine candidate against PEDV. It has been reported that some epitopes are conserved among various PEDV strains [35] [36] [37] . However, it is unclear whether these different strains of PEDV can induce a cross-immune response in pigs. Most commercial PED vaccines in China are inactivated vaccines, the protective efficacy of which is weakened due to the different virus genotypes used for vaccine generation [37] . Furthermore, inactivated vaccines do not induce an efficient mucosal immune response, and this is a potential reason why there are many reports about the lack of efficacy of commercial PEDV vaccines from 2010. The S protein is a key component of coronaviruses and contains neutralizing epitopes, but it is genetically variable, which increases the difficulty of generating a vaccine against PEDV. Our results indicated that vaccination with inactivated SQ2014 and inactivated CV777 resulted in effective protection against a homologous virus challenge, but not a heterologous virus challenge. rSPV-St, expressing the truncated S protein from the SQ2014 strain, did not provide any protection against the classical CV777 strain, indicating a lack of cross-protection. These results may also provide insight into why commercial vaccines developed from classical PEDV strains such as CV777 are no longer effective in China due to the emergence of novel PEDV strains.",

The pig immune reactions in our experiments were interesting. Immunization with rSPV-St resulted in the highest IgA antibody titer and cytokine response among the five experimental groups, but the IgG titers were lower than those elicited by inactivated SQ2014. However, rSPV-St vaccine provided efficient protection in newborn pigs that was as effective as that provided by the inactivated SQ2014 vaccine. These findings indicated that the neutralizing antibody titer is not the only criterion for whether a vaccine is effective; the IgA antibody titer and cytokines also contribution to protection.

To address this problem, we collected 2000 random serum samples from reserve and feeder pigs to determine the rate of SPV positivity by agarose gel diffusion assay (data not shown). The SPV positive rate was approximately 1%, and there have been no reports of an SPV outbreak in recent years. Therefore, endemic SPV is unlikely to interfere with vaccination programs using an rSPV vector. Table 3 Evaluation of intestinal lesions in pigs from different treatment groups * Indicates significantly (P < 0.05) higher lesion scores of the wtSPVand PBS-treated groups compared to groups immunized with rSPV-St and inactivated-SQ2014 vaccines a The gross score was obtained by summing I and III according to the following description and lesion scores from 0 (normal) to 10 (severe lesion).
