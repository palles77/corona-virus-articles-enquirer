            "text": "Personal protective equipment (PPE) is used in healthcare settings to protect healthcare workers (HCWs) from exposure to pathogens and to prevent the spread of pathogens to other patients. Proper use of PPE is crucial when HCWs care for patients with highly pathogenic organisms, such as the Ebola virus. To date, studies on PPE effectiveness are uncommon, small, and potentially out of date, and many evaluate PPE types no longer in use. 1 The 2014-2016 Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak revealed the need for better empirical data regarding best practices to safely don and doff PPE. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] Although EVD is a high-visibility, high-impact disease, HCWS are much more likely to encounter pathogens on a daily basis, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus, Clostridium difficile, and carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae. The primary forms of PPE used to protect HCWs and other patients against these important hospital-associated pathogens are associated with contact precautions (CP), which includes gown and gloves. Few data exist regarding whether HCWs follow guidelines for donning and doffing CP PPE and their risk of self-contamination. 6, 7 One of the primary challenges when designing studies to evaluate PPE or donning/doffing procedures is determining how to model pathogen transmission. The most commonly used surrogate marker for the presence of pathogens is fluorescence, and it can be delivered in a variety of forms: powder, liquid, lotion, etc. [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] Fluorescent markers are inexpensive, easy to use, and because the read out is visual, they can provide immediate feedback to HCWs; however, fluorescence may not be an appropriate surrogate for contamination with infectious viral particles. 10 An alternate marker for viral infection is the MS2 bacteriophage, a single-strand RNA bacteriophage that is a biosafety level 1 agent and nonpathogenic to humans. MS2 has been used previously in several studies of PPE transmission and/or disinfection, 10, 11, 15, 16 in a long-term-care facility, 17 a hotel, 18 and an office. 19 Commercial preparations of MS2 are expensive and require significant laboratory expertise to use, but they may provide a more accurate surrogate marker for how pathogens spread in the environment than fluorescence. 3, 10 The purpose of this study was to evaluate HCW risk of selfcontamination when donning and doffing EVD PPE and CP PPE using MS2 bacteriophage and a fluorescent marker as surrogates for pathogen transmission. The frequencies and types of protocol deviations that occurred were documented, and associations between HCW self-contamination after doffing and particular doffing protocol deviations or HCW characteristics were determined.

            "text": "Proper use of PPE is essential to protecting patients and HCWs from infectious diseases. However, our results indicate that protocol deviations were common in both donning and doffing. Notably, we found that 100% of EVD PPE HCWs committed at least 1 protocol deviation during doffing, and 27% while donning. This finding is not surprising, given the complexity of EVD PPE, and it is consistent with previous studies. 8, 14, 22 In a study involving 120 students, Casalino et al 22 found that EVD PPE doffing errors occurred even after a 3-phase training program. While protocol deviations while doffing are a major focus for HCW self-contamination, donning deviations, such as an improperly tied gown (a deviation we observed) may increase the future risk of selfcontamination while doffing. Furthermore, we demonstrated that not all protocol deviations were committed by the donning and doffing HCW. For example, several doffing assistants touched the inside of HCW gowns when undoing the neck Velcro, and trained observers occasionally failed to instruct HCWs to perform hand hygiene. While previous studies have evaluated HCW protocol deviations while doffing PPE, few have evaluated the role of other HCWs in the doffing process. This is an important area for future investigation. Boot-cover removal was particularly problematic. HCWs received varied instructions on the specifics of the boot-cover removal process. HCWs struggled to balance their legs in the air or rest their legs on their scrubs without contaminating themselves, and left-handed HCWs struggled to use righthanded scissors. All 3 left-handed EVD PPE HCWs made \u22651 protocol deviation during boot-cover removal. Many HCWs touched their scrubs with their shoes or gown, both potentially contaminated, during boot-cover removal and shoe disinfection. Herlihey et al 23 also reported difficulties with shoe-cover removal. HCWs caring for EVD patients may be exposed to large amounts of environmental contamination; 3 thus, this component of EVD PPE removal may benefit from process improvement. Notably, the recommendations for boot-cover removal have changed since this study was performed. At BJH, the revised process doffs gowns before boot covers, eliminates the use of scissors, and allows HCWs to keep their feet on the ground. We hypothesize that these changes will decrease protocol deviations, but more studies are needed to confirm this. Hand hygiene and glove removal protocol deviations were common during doffing of both EVD and CP PPE (67% and 39% of HCWs made \u22651 error, respectively). During EVD PPE doffing, common protocol deviations included touching outer gloves with inner gloved hands and touching the outside of gloves with bare hands. Herlihey et al 23 reported similar challenges doffing multiple pairs of gloves. Casanova et al 15 compared HCW self-contamination after doffing PPE with single gloves versus double gloves, using MS2 as a marker, and found that although double gloves reduced viral transfer, MS2 was still recovered from the hands of 23% of HCWs after doffing. These results may not be directly comparable to our study because it is unclear whether those HCWs performed hand hygiene after doffing. Regardless, hand hygiene and glove removal are high-risk opportunities for HCW self-contamination. For both the EVD and CP groups, we found fluorescence on HCW hands more often than any other site. HCWs may benefit from targeted training in the correct method for glove removal during EVD PPE doffing, and training should reinforce the fact that gloves are not a substitute for proper hand hygiene.",

Several previous studies have suggested that, regardless of PPE type, increased training and access to published donning/doffing guidelines improves HCWs' ability to don and doff PPE without protocol deviation. 7, 12, 22, 24, 25 All EVD PPE HCWs in our study previously had received formal EVD PPE training. By contrast, although 72% of CP PPE HCWs reported having previous training in PPE donning/doffing, this training was often informal, \"on the job\" training from other HCWs. Similarly, Turnberg et al 26 reported that 15%-40% of HCWs had not received PPE training during the previous 12 months, and John et al 27 found that \"on the job\" training was the most common method of PPE training for HCWs. Despite the comparative simplicity of the CP PPE donning/doffing process, only half of the HCWs were able to don PPE without protocol deviation, and only approximately onethird were able to doff PPE without protocol deviation. Common CP PPE doffing protocol deviations included touching the front of the gown with bare hands or allowing the contaminated gown to brush against scrubs while disposing. Possibly, HCWs may be unaware that specific guidelines exist for donning/doffing CP precautions. 6 Beam et al 8 demonstrated that simple exposure to a poster showing the correct donning/doffing sequence may not be enough to improve HCW practices. Tomas et al 7 found that a training session on CP PPE doffing techniques led to a significant decrease in HCW self-contamination. Formal, targeted interventions or education programs may be needed to improve CP PPE donning/doffing practices.",

Conversely, Casanova et al 10 found considerable MS2 transfer to HCW hands and scrubs in the absence of fluorescence; thus, fluorescence may not accurately mimic transmission of viral particles. MS2 is not visible to the naked eye, and it is possible in our study that additional areas of MS2 contamination were not detected because, outside of HCW hands, face, and arms, we sampled only those areas that fluoresced.
