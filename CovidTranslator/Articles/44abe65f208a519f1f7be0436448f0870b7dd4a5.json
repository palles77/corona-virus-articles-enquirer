Karanjin has been reported to be hypoglycemic, 9 antifungal, 10 synergist to insecticides, antifeedent 11 and pongamol has antimicro-bial 12 activity and is used commercially in cosmetic and sun-screen preparations. 13 The adequate treatment of mycotic infections is difficult since fungi are eukaryotic organisms with a structure and metabolism that is similar to those of eukaryotic host. For this reason, there is a need to design new compounds with good antifungal activity. Therefore, in order to explore the potential of furanoflavonoid nucleus as antifungal and antibacterial agents we have devised an easy and efficient methodology to introduce novel pyrrole and thiophene anellated mimics to furanoflavonoids as their heterocyclic counterparts.",

Easy and efficient methods are available for synthesis of 2-substitutedtetrahydrobenzofurans, but these methods can only be applied for synthesis of 2,3-dihydro-2-substituted-tetrahydrobenzofurans due to their limitations. 15, 16 Recent studies have shown use of rhodium acetate in dipolar cycloaddition of diazacyclohexane-1,3-diones with vinyl acetates followed by acid catalyzed dehydration to produce 1 in 41-71% yield. 17 Our attempt to synthesize 1, commenced from commercially available cyclohexane-1,3-dione as shown in Scheme 1. Aqueous solution of cyclohexane-1,3-dione was stirred with bromoacetaldehyde in presence of catalytic amount of TBAI and pH 6-7 was maintained by addition of sodium bicarbonate. After 6 h the reaction mixture was subjected to acid catalyzed dehydration to afford 1 in 78% yield. 18 The synthesis of key intermediate 2 (Scheme 1) was achieved in quantitative yields by ammonolysis of tetrahydrobenzofuran (1) with methyl amine in aqueous ethanol contained in a sealed tube at 150\u00b0C for 14 h. 19 As depicted in the retrosynthetic scheme, sulfur can be inserted to the key intermediate while starting our strategy from thiophene. Friedel-Crafts acylation of thiophene with succinic anhydride catalyzed by Lewis acid AlCl 3 and subsequent reduction of carbonyl group by Clemmensen reduction, thereafter conversion of free acid to acid chloride and again Friedel-Crafts acylation afforded 3 in 64% overall yield as shown in Scheme 2. 20 Enolate of 2/3 was generated with NaH and catalytic amount of KH followed by coupling with ethyl acetate and dimethyl carbonate in refluxing DME produced 4-7 (80-94%). Compound 4 and 5 existed as keto-enol tautomers (9:1), as indicated from 1 H NMR spectra. Thereafter, DDQ mediated dehydrogenation of 4-7 in refluxing dioxane, afforded 8-11 (64-85%) (Scheme 3). 14 Compound 16 and 17 were prepared in quantitative yield by methylation of the phenols 10 and 11 with methyl iodide and K 2 CO 3 in acetone (Scheme 5).",

Synthesized compounds were evaluated for antifungal and antibacterial activities. Biological studies of heterocyclic analogues of these compounds have revealed that substitution of the heterocyclic oxygen by sulfur has produced marked increase in the antifungal activity, as indicated by activity profile of the compound 19. Perkin-Elmer RX-1 spectrophotometer using either KBr pallets or in neat. The FAB-MS were recorded using a beam of Argon (2-8 eV) on Jeol SX 102/DA-6000 mass spectrometer. The NMR spectra were run on an AVANCE DPX 200 and Bruker DRX 300 FTNMR spectrometers. The chemical shifts are reported in d (ppm) downfield from TMS, which was used as internal standard. Elemental analyses were obtained in a Carlo-Erba-1108 CHN elemental analyzer. Silica gel (60-120 mesh) was used for column chromatography while silica gel (230-400 mesh) was used for flash chromatography. TLC was run either on precoated silica gel 60F254 and RP-18 F254 (Merck) or hand made plates. Detection of spots was done either by iodine vapour, spraying with 1% cerric sulfate in 1 M H 2 SO 4 followed by heating at 110\u00b0C, or spraying with 10% methanolic sulfuric acid followed by heating at 110\u00b0C. -1-methyl-4-oxo-4,5,6,7-tetrahydroindole (4) To the stirred solution of sodium hydride (1.20 g, 50 mmol) and potassium hydride (100 mg, 2.5 mmol) in dry DME (10 mL) added a solution of 2 (750 mg, 5.0 mmol) in dry DME (2 mL) at 0\u00b0C under nitrogen atmosphere. The reaction mixture was stirred for 30 min and then ethyl acetate (2.40 mL, 25 mmol) was slowly added over 10 min. The ice bath was removed and the reaction mixture was heated to reflux for 2.30 h. Reaction mixture was quenched by dropwise addition of ice cold ammonium chloride solution (5 mL) and then poured over aqueous ammonium chloride solution (30 mL), extracted with ethyl acetate (3 \u00b7 50 mL). The combined organic layers were washed with brine, dried over Na 2 SO 4 and evaporated under re-duced pressure.

The activity of compounds was determined by the NCCLS method for fungus using RPMI-1640 media buffered with MOPS (3-[N-morpholino] propanesulfonic acid) (Sigma Chemical Co.) and Mueller Hinton broth for bacteria. The 96-well tissue culture plates were used for twofold serial dilution. The proper growth control, drug control and the blank were adjusted onto the plate. Compounds were dissolved in DMSO at a concentration of 1 mg/mL and 20 lL of this was added to 96-well tissue culture plate having 180 lL RPMI-1640 so the maximum concentration of the compound became 50 lg/mL. From here the solution was serially diluted resulting into the half of the concentration of test compounds and then inoculum was added and kept for incubation. Micro-titer plates were incubated at 35\u00b0C in a moist, dark chamber and MICs were recorded spectrophotometrically.",
