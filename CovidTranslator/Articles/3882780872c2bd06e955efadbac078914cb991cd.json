There are 20-25 vibrissae in each upper lip. In healthy rabbits, the nostrils constantly twitch at a rate of 2-120 times per minute, unless the rabbit is at rest (Brewer and Cruise, 1994) or is unwell. The nasal cavity is lined with a protective layer of mucus that entraps foreign particles and bacteria. The mucus also prevents water loss and enhances the sense of smell. The nasal glands secrete serous fluid into the nasal cavity. In the rabbit, there is glandular tissue along the nasal septum and a cluster of glands, collectively known as the lateral nasal gland, occupy the entire wall between the nasal cavity and maxillary sinus (Bojsen-Moller, 1964) . The function of these nasal glands is to moisten inspired air, which has a role in thermoregulation. The position of the conchal and maxillary sinuses and the structures of the nasal cavity are illustrated in Figures 1.18 and 5.1. There is no frontal sinus.",

            "text": "Pasteurella multocida is associated with a number of diseases of rabbits (see Section 14.5.1). Pasteurellosis is not a recognized problem in wild rabbits but is a serious disease in colonies of commercial or laboratory rabbits. In pet rabbits, although P. multocida is found as an opportunist pathogen in many secondary infections, primary pasteurellosis is uncommon. It is usually encountered in situations where there has been increased stress and an increased number of interactions with other rabbits: for example, the newly acquired rabbit that has recently been bought from a breeder or pet shop. Respiratory disease is the most common manifestation. Acute infections and septicaemia occur, especially in young animals, but chronic, insidious recurrent infections are more common in the adult pet rabbit. Rhinitis, conjunctivitis, nasolacrimal duct infections, otitis media, tracheitis and bronchopneumonia can all be caused by P. multocida; however, it is wise to remember that other organisms can be involved. The bacteria can spread to other sites from the nasal cavity where it can reside as a commensal organism. Infection often persists despite mucosal and humoral antibody responses in addition to effusive neutrophilic exudation. The deleterious effect of pasteurellosis on laboratory colonies of rabbits and interference with experimental procedures has resulted in the evolution of expensive 'pasteurella-free' rabbits for use in research. The epidemiology of pasteurellosis is discussed in Section 14.5.1. See Figure 11 .1 for the many predisposing factors that trigger disease.",

(1983) surveyed the capsular and somatic serotypes of P. multocida found in healthy and diseased rabbits and concluded that while several major serotypes can be differentiated, one (serotype 12A) was predominant in both healthy and diseased individuals. The development of rhinitis and other respiratory tract problems in the newly acquired young rabbit is likely to be due to pasteurellosis. In the older animal, stress or poor husbandry can result in a flare-up of a latent infection. The possibility of disease being due to pasteurellosis does not replace the need for diagnostic evaluation. Poor air quality, caused by high ammonia levels or dusty hay, irritates the respiratory tract and predisposes secondary infection. Ventilation and good air quality are important in disease prevention. Pasteurellosis can be spread between animals and the disease is endemic in most breeding establishments. It often causes problems in premises such as sanctuaries, where several animals are housed in close proximity. A distance of greater than 1.8 m (6 feet) or 'sneezing distance' is needed to control the spread of infection between individuals (Whittaker, 1989 Repetitive sneezing and upper respiratory tract noise is a feature of rhinitis. Rhinitis and sinusitis can be manifestations of pasteurellosis, although other organisms such as staphylococci or Bordetella can also be involved. The differential diagnosis of upper respiratory tract disease in rabbits includes nasal foreign bodies and periapical abscesses of the maxillary incisors or premolars. Both these conditions are common in the pet rabbit, so it cannot be assumed that all rabbits with a purulent nasal discharge are suffering from pasteurellosis or that all cases of 'snuffles' are due to infectious agents.",

In advanced cases, the nasal discharge is thick, yellow and viscid. Copious amounts of mucopurulent material can be discharged from the nostrils and form crusts on the surrounding skin. Affected rabbits wipe the purulent discharges from their nose with their forepaws, which become matted and discoloured. Coughing is not as common as sneezing and snorting. Respiratory noises may be audible to the owner who may think their rabbit is 'wheezing'. Anorexia can occur, perhaps due to a reduced sense of smell or because it is difficult to chew and breathe at the same time. Grooming difficulties occur because the rabbit finds it difficult to breathe and groom simultaneously. Response to antibiotic therapy is poor in advanced cases and relapse is common. Post-mortem examination of the sinuses and nasal passages of rabbits with chronic rhinitis shows why these cases are so difficult to treat. The nasal cavity is filled with pus, which can spread into the paranasal sinuses (see Figure 5 .1 and Figure 11 .2). The pus becomes thick and inspissated. There is ulceration of the mucous membranes and osteomyelitis of the turbinates, causing severe atrophy and erosion (Deeb, 1997) . The presence of pus in the nasal cavity impedes gas exchange and causes physical discomfort and irritation.",

Young rabbits that have recently been stressed by weaning, change in routine and transport are often exposed to infection at the breeding establishment where they originated. Rabbits housed with several others in sheds and outhouses are susceptible. In older, individual pet rabbits, bacterial infection is less likely to be a cause of rhinitis than dental disease, which is common. Nasal foreign bodies can cause rhinitis (see Section 11.3). Myxomatosis is another possible cause of rhinitis. Myxomatosis in rabbit colonies can present as rhinitis in association with ocular discharge. Aerosol infection is more likely to give respiratory tract signs than insect spread (see Section 14.6.1). Myxomatosis is progressive and almost invariably fatal.",

Culture results do not necessarily illustrate the organism causing the clinical signs; it merely gives an overview of the organisms present. Caution is therefore necessary in their interpretation. Depending on the method of collection of swab samples for culture, contaminants can be present, presenting a false result. Common causes of inaccurate results are failure to clean the external nares prior to sample collection, and failure to insert the swab deeply enough into to nasal cavity.

The presence of exudate in the external ear canal does not signify the presence of otitis media. In many pet rabbits, especially lopeared breeds, it is difficult to visualize the tympanic membrane due to the presence of waxy ear secretion. Post-mortem examination of the ear canal of pet rabbits often reveals the presence of inspissated pus that occludes the external ear canal. The presence of purulent material in the external ear canal does not necessarily signify the presence of pus in the tympanic bulla. Neither does pus in the tympanic bulla always cause otitis interna and vestibular symptoms (see Section 10.4.3).

An antibiotic that is unlikely to cause diarrhoea but is effective against P. multocida should be selected. Examples include enrofloxacin, trimethoprim sulpha combinations, tetracyclines, parenteral cephalexin or penicillin. In vitro, most rabbit isolates of P. multocida are susceptible to penicillin, chloramphenicol, tetracycline, erythromycin, novobiocin and nitrofurans with a variable susceptibility to streptomycin, kanamycin, neomycin and sulphonamides. Pasteurella multocida is usually resistant to clindamycin and lincomycin (Manning et al., 1989) . More recently Sellyei et al. (2009) demonstrated the increasing resistance of P. multocida isolates from swine and poultry to certain antibiotics (namely, sulphonamides, tetracyclines and aminoglycosides); however, they found third-generation quinolones such as enrofloxacin to be effective. The tendency for the fluoroquinolones to concentrate in the mucosa of the maxillary sinus at levels greater than that found in the blood (Dan et al., 1989 ) makes this drug a good first choice for treating Pasteurella. Penicillin has been used widely to treat rhinitis in laboratory rabbits (Gaertner, 1991) . Concurrent infection with other pathogens such as Bordetella bronchiseptica can affect the response to therapy. Tilmicosin is an effective antibiotic in the treatment of acute pasteurellosis in sheep and has been used to treat rabbits despite the possibility of a fatal adverse reaction to the drug.",

The pus is often in inaccessible sites such as the nasal passages, paranasal sinuses, tympanic bullae or even the brain. Surgery, such as trephination, to remove the pus, provide drainage and create a route for local medication, is possible. Bulla osteotomy has been suggested as a treatment for rabbits with severe, refractory, chronic otitis media in association with vestibular signs such as head tilt and anorexia (Redrobe, 2000) . Two surgical techniques have been described (Redrobe, 2000; Swindle and Shealy, 1996) . Chow et al. (2009) and Chow (2011) describe in detail the technique for ventral bulla osteotomy in the rabbit and include a period of follow-up, with encouraging results. This experience has been replicated by the staff of the Exotics Service at the University of Edinburgh. Trephination of sinuses has been widely described in rabbits (Gilbert et al., 2004; Scharf et al., 1994; Watanabe et al., 1999) as they are used as models of maxillary sinusitis in humans; however, clinical reports are less common but the procedure appears to be well tolerated (Kelleher, 2008) . Trephination rarely provides freedom from clinical signs of chronic sinusitis in cats.",

Dehydration leads to dry airways, resulting in increased viscosity of secretions, decreased ciliary function, inflammation and degeneration of the mucosa. The inclusion of fresh leafy vegetables in the diet can increase a rabbit's fluid intake, particularly if they are fed wet (water is left on the vegetables after washing). Water can be added to inspired gases by the use of humidifiers or placing the rabbit in a steamed-up room such as a bathroom, although care must be taken to ensure the rabbit does not overheat. Nebulization is sometimes used as a method of introducing antibiotic, decongestants and other agents directly into the respiratory tract and to loosen secretions and bring relief. Nebulization introduces charged particles into the respiratory tract as an aerosol. In other species, nebulization is used to treat lower respiratory tract disease. Medication introduced by nebulization is unlikely to reach the tympanic bullae or paranasal sinuses or to penetrate thick mucopurulent exudate in rabbits. Mucolytic agents such as bromhexine or N-acetyl-cysteine have been recommended for nebulization in rabbits with rhinitis (Meredith, 2000) . In other species, N-acetylcysteine is irritating to mucosal surfaces and can inactivate certain antibiotics when it is mixed with them (McKiernan, 1983) . Systemic bromhexine (Bisolvon, Boehringer Ingelheim) can be used as a mucolytic in rabbits. In cattle and pigs, when bromhexine is administered simultaneously with oxytetracycline, the antibiotic in the bronchial mucus is considerably increased (product datasheet).",

Rabbits do not sweat and cannot pant effectively. Their ears play an important part in thermoregulation. Signs of heat stroke are similar to other species: anorexia, increased respiratory rate, prostration, pulmonary oedema, cyanosis and death. Some cases can have blood-tinged fluid from the nose and mouth. A high rectal temperature (in excess of 40 C) is suggestive of heat stroke, and temperatures of 42-45 C are associated with a fatal outcome (Adolph, 1947) . The pathological changes in heat stroke include a reduction in blood pressure (secondary to vasodilation), which can result in reduced cerebral perfusion, cerebral ischaemia and oedema (Shih et al., 1984) . Reduced perfusion can also affect renal and hepatic function. A metabolic acidosis and electrolyte abnormalities also occur. Treatment is aimed at reducing body temperature, e.g., bathing in cold water, wetting the ears and blowing them with a cold hair-drier and administration of intravenous fluids. The administration of a vasodilator such as acepromazine may be helpful. Close monitoring of acid-base and electrolyte parameters may help guide treatment. In human medicine, the use of an interleukin-1 receptor antagonist has shown promise in the treatment of heat stroke (Shen et al., 2008) .",

Vitamin E deficiency, coronavirus infection and some bacterial infections such as salmonellosis and pasteurellosis have been recorded as causes of cardiomyopathy in laboratory rabbits (Marini et al., 1999) . Tyzzer's disease not only causes intestinal and hepatic lesions but can also cause a myocarditis resulting in myocardial fibrosis in those animals that survive (Percy and Barthold, 1993) . Encephalitozoon cuniculi has been reported as a cause of myocarditis in rabbits (Pakes and Gerrity, 1994) . Stress and catecholamines are proven causes of cardiomyopathy and experimental models of the human disease can be provided by keeping rabbits in overcrowded conditions (Weber and Van der Walt, 1975) . Myocardial necrosis and fibrosis have been recorded in rabbits anaesthetized with ketamine/ xylazine combinations by continuous infusion. Marini et al. (1999) postulated that hypoxaemia and coronary vasoconstriction result in cell death and necrosis. The rabbit has limited collateral coronary circulation and is therefore predisposed to ischaemia induced by coronary vasoconstriction. The authors draw an analogy with rabbits used as models of catecholamine-induced cardiomyopathy in which a-adrenergic-mediated coronary vasoconstriction occurs. Hypotension and hypoxaemia are further contributory factors.",

Aortic arteriosclerosis occurs in rabbits and can cause seizures or vague symptoms such as inactivity and weight loss.

Mineralization of the aorta is seen radiologically (Shell and Saunders, 1989) and on post-mortem examination. Calcification of the aorta is often associated with calcification of the kidney (see Section 12.5.2). Calcification of soft tissues can be caused by excessive intestinal absorption of calcium, such as in cases of vitamin D toxicity. Figure 11 .10 Cardiomyopathy.

Pulmonary oedema, pleural effusion and dilation of the right ventricle are found at post-mortem. As in feline infectious peritonitis, hypergammaglobulinaemia is a feature of chronic infection that can be manifested by myocardial degeneration, ascites and uveitis.
