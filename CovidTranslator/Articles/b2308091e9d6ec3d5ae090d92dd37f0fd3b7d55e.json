In addition, experimental infection of Mustelidae (domestic ferrets, Mustela putorius furo; Govorkova et al. 2005) and mice (Lu et al. 1999) with some strains of H5N1 viruses has been fatal. Experimental inoculation of Suidae (domestic pigs, Sus scrofa) led to infection and mild non-fatal illness without transmission to contact pigs (Choi et al. 2005) , while infection of longtailed macaques (Macaca fascicularis) led to acute respiratory symptoms and fever associated with a necrotizing interstitial pneumonia (Rimmelzwaan et al. 2001) .

Ten animals were housed individually, six in pairs, one adult female was held with her two offspring and there was one family group comprising four animals. Cage mesh in 12 of the enclosures would permit small mammals, reptiles and birds to enter, and none of the enclosures were roofed.

Autopsy showed pulmonary oedema with mild parenchymal inflammation without evidence of hyaline membrane formation. Moderately severe meningitis was present, together with cerebral oedema and hypoxic change of the neurons. Foci of necrosis were seen in the liver.",

H5N1 virus was detected in the lungs, brain, kidney and intestinal tract by virus isolation, by RT-PCR and by detection of viral antigen using immunohistology on organ impression smears or histological sections (figure 1b,c). Within the lung there was staining of bronchial epithelium and pneumocytes with the monoclonal antibody to influenza nucleoprotein, but no significant areas of necrosis were seen in these regions of infection. Influenza virus antigen was detected in the inflammatory exudates in the meninges and electron microscopy demonstrated viral particles consistent with influenza virus. Prominent staining of the neurons of the cerebral cortex and cerebellum was seen but again this was not accompanied by a significant inflammatory cell infiltrate. Thus, the virus appears to have disseminated to involve multiple organs as was previously seen in felids (Keawcharoen et al. 2004) with neurotropism being a prominent feature of the disease (figure 1c).",

Almost all species of Viverridae present in Vietnam, including the Owston's civet, have been over-hunted for human consumption within the illegal wildlife trade (Bell et al. 2004 ). The ease with which H5N1 virus appears to cross species-barriers suggests that, in addition to poultry exposure, the illegal wildlife trade presents a further potential route for human infection with this virus. This has been vividly demonstrated by the first appearance of H5N1 in Europe and the United Kingdom occurring in illegally smuggled eagles seized in Belgium (Van Borm et al. 2005) and birds imported into the United Kingdom for the pet trade (OIE 2005) .",

The wide range of avian orders affected suggests that HPAI H5N1 may be highly pathogenic in many avian species. In terms of risk of exposure to H5N1-infected poultry, one might predict that those species at greatest risk in the wild are those which: (i) live commensally around domestic poultry; (ii) are occasional visitors to areas containing poultry or poultry excreta; or (iii) include affected poultry and wild bird species in their diet. Those mammalian orders likely to be at highest risk of infection through dietary routes are the Carnivora, Primates, Rodentia, Dasyuromorphia (marsupial carnivores) and Didelphimorphia (American opossums). However, species from a range of other orders are occasional consumers of birds, for example, the greater false vampire bats (order Chiroptera) and armadillos (order Edendata) may also scavenge vertebrate carcasses (Macdonald 2001) . The well-developed olfactory-based communication systems of mammals, often involving close inspection of urine and faeces, may also increase their susceptibility to infection through the oro-nasal route.",
