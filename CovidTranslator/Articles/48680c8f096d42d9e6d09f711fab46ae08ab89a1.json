            "text": "Historically, influenza pandemics have arisen from avian influenza viruses. Avian influenza viruses H5N1 and H9N2 are potential pandemic candidates. Infection of humans with the highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 virus is associated with a mortality in excess of 60%, which has been attributed to dysregulation of the cytokine system. Human macrophages and epithelial cells infected with some genotypes of H5N1 and H9N2 viruses express markedly elevated cytokine and chemokine levels when compared with seasonal influenza A subtype H1N1 virus. The mechanisms underlying this cytokine and chemokine hyperinduction are not fully elucidated. In the present study, we demonstrate that autophagy, a tightly regulated homeostatic process for self-digestion of unwanted cellular subcomponents, plays a role in cytokine induction. Autophagy is induced to a greater extent by H9N2/G1, in association with cytokine hyperinduction, compared with H1N1 and the novel pandemic swine-origin influenza A/H1N1 viruses. Using 3-methyladenine to inhibit autophagy and small interfering RNA to silence the autophagy gene, Atg5, we further show that autophagic responses play a role in influenza virus-induced CXCL10 and interferon-a expression in primary human blood macrophages. Our results provide new insights into the pathogenic mechanisms of avian influenza viruses.",

Human H5N1 disease is associated with mortality in excess of 60%, 1 and is a cause for global public health concerns. In addition, avian influenza H9N2 viruses have become highly prevalent in poultry in many countries and have caused repeated cases of human infections. 2, 3 Studies exploring the mechanism of transmission have shown that many of these H9N2 isolates have the capacity to bind to both sialic acid (SA) a 2-3 and SA a 2-6 receptors found on avian and human cells, respectively. These leucine-226-containing H9N2 viruses with human cell tropism grew efficiently in human airway epithelial cells 4 and were efficiently transmitted in ferrets. 5 Additionally, replication in ferrets and transmission via direct contact were significantly enhanced in an H9N2 avian-human reassortant virus, although no aerosol transmission was detected. 5 Taken together, the high prevalence, wide geographic range, rapid evolution and frequent reassortment of H9N2 viruses in poultry, 6 in combination with the increasing number of avian influenza infections in humans, highlight their pandemic and zoonotic potential.",

            "text": "Due to their potential threat as pandemic pathogens, details of avian virus replication, pathogenesis and host response are subjects of intense investigation. Previous reports, including ours, 7, 8 demonstrated differences in the pattern of cell death in avian H5N1 and human influenza virus-infected cells. In response to insults, cell death processes include necrosis, apoptosis and autophagy. Apoptotic death is an organized process to minimize inflammatory changes, whereas autophagy is a self-controlled program for eliminating damaged organelles. Autophagy was originally characterized as a tightly regulated cellular homeostatic process, which involves the sequestration of parts of the cytosol and intracellular organelles within double-membraned autophagic vacuoles and their subsequent delivery to lysosomes for degradation. In addition to cell survival, autophagy plays an essential role in innate and adaptive immunity to fight against microbial infections. 9 For example, autophagy enhances degradation of HSV-1 viral proteins, 10 as well as recognition of single-stranded RNA viruses and secretion of interferon-a (IFN) in plasmacytoid dendritic cells. 11 Autophagy is also important in lysosomal proteolysis of foreign antigens and their presentation by major histocompatibility complex class II molecules to CD4 1 cells. Autophagosomes have been shown to fuse continuously with multivesicular major histocompatibility complex class II-loading compartments. 12 The role of autophagy in cellular antiviral responses is not well defined. However, various viruses, including poliovirus, rotavirus and parvovirus, can induce autophagy to enhance their own replication. 13 Fatal outcomes of H5N1 virus infections are associated with high viral load and hypercytokinemia. 14 Elevated levels of CXCL10, CXCL9 and CCL2 were found in patients with H5N1 infections when compared to those with human seasonal influenza H3N2 and H1N1 virus infections. In other in vitro studies of primary human macrophages, the highly pathogenic H5N1 (A/Hong Kong/483/1997) and H9N2/G1 (A/Quail/Hong Kong/G1/97) viruses induced significantly higher levels of cytokines and chemokines, including tumor necrosis factor-a, type I IFN, CCL2, CCL3, CCL5 and CXCL10, when compared with the H1N1 virus. 15, 16 These two avian viruses share common internal viral genes. 17 A recent report showed that the novel swineorigin influenza A/H1N1 virus (S-OIV), which caused the recent pandemic, induced cytokine and chemokine levels comparable with the seasonal H1N1 virus in primary human blood macrophages. 18 Because autophagy plays a role in influenza virus-induced cell death, 19 it may also contribute to cytokine dysregulation. Here, we show that while influenza viruses H1N1 (both seasonal and pandemic) and H9N2/G1 induce autophagy in human blood macrophages, H9N2 viruses are far more potent inducers of autophagy. In addition, we demonstrate that S-OIV is a weaker inducer of autophagy than the seasonal H1N1 virus. We also examine the role of autophagy in CXCL10 and IFN-a production upon influenza virus infection.",

Primary blood macrophages were infected with influenza viruses, including H9N2/G1, H1N1 and S-OIV, at a multiplicity of infection of 2. At 19 h post-infection (h.p.i.), whole-cell lysates were prepared and analyzed by western blot using antibodies specific to LC3B. Actin was used as a loading control. LC3B I was converted to LC3B II at a higher efficiency in cells infected with H9N2/G1 virus than with H1N1 virus (Figure 1a ). The intensity ratio of LC3B II to I was determined by measuring the band intensity using Bio-Rad Quantity One imaging software. When compared to mock-treated cells, the ratio of LC3B II to I was increased fivefold upon H1N1 infection and, much more drastically, 90-fold with H9N2/G1. However, when comparing the LC3B II to I ratio in H1N1 versus S-OIV virus-infected cells at 17 h.p.i., the ratio was smaller in the case of S-OIV (Figure 1b) , indicating that S-OIV induced less autophagy than H1N1. Autophagosomes were also examined by immunocytochemistry at Role of autophagy in CXCL10 and interferon-alpha induction A Law et al 264 Figure 1c ). Moreover, more prominent staining was found in cells infected with H9N2/G1 when compared with those infected with H1N1. Additionally, we examined other markers of autophagy, including the level of p62 protein, a polyubiquitin-binding protein and the activity of p70S6K, a marker of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), following influenza virus infections. 23, 24 The p62 protein can bind directly to LC3 proteins that enhance the degradation of ubiquitinated proteins in the lysosome through the autophagic processes. 24 Because the p62 protein itself can also be degraded by autophagy, its expression level indicates the autophagic status of the cells. 25, 26 Our results show that p62 expression decreased by approximately 45% in macrophages with H1N1 infection when compared with mock-treated macrophages (Figure 1d ). Strikingly, p62 protein expression was decreased by about 84% in H9N2/G1-infected cells.",

Elevated serum levels of chemokines were found in patients with H5N1 infections, 14,31 especially in those with fatal outcomes. 14 In vitro studies also showed that H5N1 virus induced significantly higher levels of chemokines in human macrophages than H1N1 virus. 15, 16 The H9N2/G1 virus used in this report, A/Quail/Hong Kong/G1/97, which shares six internal genes with A/Hong Kong/483/1997 (H5N1), 17 was found to induce cytokine and chemokine levels in monocyte-derived macrophages similar to H5N1. In contrast, the novel pandemic S-OIV induced cytokine and chemokine levels similar to the seasonal H1N1 virus in primary human blood macrophages. 18 Consistent with previous studies, CXCL10 and IFN-a levels were increased upon infection with H9N2/G1 (Figure 4) but not with S-OIV (data not shown).

After inhibiting the autophagic pathway by knocking down Atg5, H9N2/G1-induced CXCL10 and IFN-a protein levels were decreased by 50% ( Figure 6 ). However, the detailed mechanisms underlying how H9N2/G1 induces CXCL10 and IFN-a through autophagy need to be further investigated. One possibility is recognition of viral components through TLR3. TLR3 recognizes double-stranded RNA produced by many viruses during replication and triggers downstream pathways leading to the production of IFN and cytokines. 32 For example, TLR3 is important for induction of CXCL10 during respiratory syncytial virus infection, 33 while interactions between TLR3 and its ligand can induce autophagy. 34 Similarly, autophagy is involved in virus recognition and IFN induction 11 via presentation of cytosolic viral replication intermediates into the lysosome for TLR7 recognition. After virus recognition by TLR7, the IFN production cascade is initiated. 35 TLR7 was localized in the same intracellular compartments as TLR3. 36 H9N2/G1-induced CXCL10 and IFN-a production may be dependent on autophagy for recognition of viral components by TLR3. In addition, CXCL10 induction upon virus infection can be triggered by alternative pathways, including IFN-regulatory factor-3. 37 We have previously shown that, when compared to H1N1 virus, the H5N1 viruses are more potent activators of IFN-regulatory factor-3, 38 which may explain why knockdown of Atg5 expression in our system could not completely abrogate induction of CXCL10 and IFN-a by H9N2/G1. However, we provide evidence that autophagy contributes, at least in part, to the hyperinduction of CXCL10 and IFN-a during H9N2/G1 infection.",

In a recent report, it was shown that influenza virus replication is enhanced by autophagy in human lung carcinoma (A549) and canine kidney (Madin-Darby canine kidney) cell lines. 19 In the present study, however, blocking autophagy by knocking down Atg5 had no effect on H9N2/G1 virus replication in primary human blood macrophages (data not shown). These results indicate that H9N2/G1 replication is not affected by autophagy in blood macrophages. This discrepancy between human macrophages and lung cancer cells may be due to cell type-specific differences in the autophagic response. Additionally, transformed cell lines may have altered autophagic processes, causing primary cells and transformed cell lines to respond differently to virus infections or other stimuli. A cell type-specific role of autophagy in virus replication has also been demonstrated in coronavirus infections. Autophagy enhances the replication of coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus in embryonic stem cells, and the replication was decreased by more than 99% in Atg5 knockout cells. 39 On the other hand, another study demonstrated that Atg5 knockdown had no effect on mouse hepatitis virus replication in primary bone marrow-derived macrophages and primary low-passage mouse embryonic fibroblasts. 40 These paradoxical results highlight the importance of tissue origins and cell types in autophagic responses.",
