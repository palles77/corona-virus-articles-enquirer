Working electrodes are made on 5 \u00c2 5 cm 2 supports of 0.125-mm-thick polyimide substrate named Kapton HN s (Goodfellow). The kapton slide is cleaned with ethanol and after drying, it is covered with gold by a sputtering process using an Emitech sputter coater model K550. Gold atoms are deposited (from the cathode) over kapton (placed on the anode) in a vacuum chamber filled with argon. Gold layer thickness is controlled by the time and the intensity of the discharge. For a 100-nm-thick layer a 35 mA discharge is applied over 220 s. After that, a conductor wire is attached to the centre of one of the sides by means of an epoxy resin (CW2400) obtained from RS Components, that is cured at room temperature.",
