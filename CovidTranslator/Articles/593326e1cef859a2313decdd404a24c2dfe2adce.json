One of the most important responsibilities of the ED leaders and managers (senior management) is to foster teamwork. They will also have to ensure that communication between team members is optimal and that there is a structure in place for conflict resolution. ED senior management should be aware of their team dynamics and know the \"movers and shakers\" in their organization. ED systems should be kept simple. One of the core businesses of an ED is contingency planning. ED senior management must plan, prepare, practice, review, analyze, assess and strategize for unexpected events. The ED physical environment has an impact on the flow of care being delivered to her patients. ED senior management must manage change. Change works only if it takes root in the hearts and minds of the organization's people. The quality of the leaders and managers of the ED will determine whether or not, their teams work in an environment where they can deliver the best care to their patients.",

At the first level, practitioners care for patients one at a time: it is a one-to-one relationship when the practitioner is with the patient. However, the ED would grind to a halt if its practitioners were to attend to one patient from entry to exit prior to attending to the next patient. At the second level, practitioners care for many patients simultaneously. They multitask. They have to do this efficiently and effectively to ensure the safety of not only the patient they are caring for at the moment but all of the other ED patients. At any one point in time, the ED will have a lead practitioner (this is the third level) on the \"shop floor\", usually a physician who will direct the activities of the whole team e prioritizing which patients and tasks should be attended to first, and at which times, determining which rules can be bent or ignored.",

This is a skill that ED leaders and managers must master. Pentland and his team 4 at MIT's Human Dynamics Laboratory have identified communication to be critical in building successful teams. They stated that the patterns of communication matter more than what is communicated. 4 The most important and valuable form of communication according to Pentland's team is face-to-face, the next is by phone or videoconference, but these become less effective as more people participate, and the least valuable are e-mail and texting.",

These are at: triage, testing and evaluation, handovers, and admission. Of these, the most interest has been on handovers, i.e., when care is transferred from one practitioner to another. Handovers are known to be a significant contributor to inefficiency and error. 7, 8 The ED senior management may wish to consider developing standardized approaches to communication processes for handovers. This can be a written template or a computerized sign-off. The team should decide how much information is required and what must be included. The use of standard read-back protocols might also minimize the misinterpretation of information transferred between two practitioners during handovers. 9 Awareness of the importance of communication in assuring quality care is an essential step in driving safer processes. 10 ED senior management should be cognizant of the level of \"authority gradient\" in their ED. As leaders and managers, they must work to minimize the negative influence of \"authority gradient\". One way to do this is to provide opportunities for team members to interact under informal circumstances to become familiar with one another. 11, 12 Informal interactions create the opportunity for casual dialogue that tends to flatten out the authority gradients between individuals. 13 Another way to minimize the negative influence of \"authority gradient\" is to introduce protocols for safetycritical moments and potentially significant events. One such is the two challenge rule 14 : a team member should voice his or her concerns first as a question; and if this is ignored, the second time more assertively. If after two attempts the concern is still disregarded and the team member believes that safety may be severely compromised, he or she is mandated to take a stronger course of action, report to a supervisor, or go up the chain of command.",

ED senior management should arrange for \"structured time to talk to the staff individually, to explain changes\". 15 \"The first objective of any change is to define the objectives.\" 32 This should be followed with clear reasons being given as to why the change is necessary. The next is to know your stakeholders and take their concerns into consideration. Communication should be tailored according to the perspective of the stakeholders, and feedback should be sought. The change should be introduced at an appropriate time, as this is vital. 33 When managing change, ED senior managers will have to accept that not all individuals will be won over at the same time.
