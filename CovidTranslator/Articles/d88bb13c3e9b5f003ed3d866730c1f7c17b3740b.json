In adults, the contributions of identified viral etiologies were 8% for influenza viruses, 6% for rhinoviruses, 3% for coronaviruses, and 2% for RSV. In children under 5 with LRTIs, strong causal associations for RSV, influenza viruses, parainfluenza viruses, and metapneumovirus were found in comparison with healthy controls, and less so for adenoviruses, bocaviruses, and coronaviruses. 7,8",

Influenza A viruses are further subtyped based on the two major antigens: haemagglutinin (HA; H1-H18) and neuraminidase (NA; N1-N11), that are responsible for host receptor binding/cell entry and cell exit, respectively. Key amino acids in these proteins, especially in HA, are associated with host specificity and transmissibility in humans. Aquatic birds are the natural reservoir of influenza A viruses, harboring all possible subtypes, except H17, H18, N10, and N11. These were recently identified in bats, suggesting birds are not the only reservoir. A selection of subtypes has established endemicity among land and water mammals (e.g., humans, pigs, horses, seals; Fig. 33 .1). Influenza B and C viruses are mainly human pathogens, with rare reports of influenza B virus infection in dogs, cats, swine, and seals. Influenza C rarely causes human infections, and influenza D viruses mostly infect cattle and will not be further discussed.",

New human viruses have emerged through antigenic drift in avian viruses (1918 Spanish flu: H1N1, 40-100 million deaths) or through reassortment of gene segments in animal hosts infected with two different viruses (antigenic shift; 1957 Asian flu: H2N2, 2 million deaths; 1968 Hong Kong flu: H3N2, 500,000 deaths). After such an introduction, the new virus becomes the dominant circulating lineage. Two notable exceptions were the reintroduction of H1N1 in the human population in 1977, possibly caused by an escape from a research laboratory, and the introduction in 2009 of a novel lineage of H1N1 influenza A virus, most likely from pigs, in North America, causing a relatively mild pandemic (with an estimated 100,000-400,000 deaths) and generating massive attention from both the public health communities and the general public and replacing only the 1977 H1N1 lineage. Currently, H1N1pdm09 and H3N2 influenza A virus are co-circulating with influenza B viruses and continue to cause yearly seasonal epidemics worldwide. The timing, extent, and direction of either \"drift\" or \"shift\" have so far been completely unpredictable. With no animal reservoirs to provide such new antigens, shift does not occur in influenza B and thus major epidemics do not occur (Fig. 33.2 ). 1, 2 Sporadic dead-end human infections of animal viruses are known to occur and have caused concern about the pandemic potential of these viruses.

Efficacious vaccines are available against the two bacteria and the influenza virus. Viruses are more important in mild upper and middle respiratory tract infections (RTIs) and in bronchiolitis in children, whereas bacteria are the main cause of pneumonia, especially in adults. Despite this, RTIs-because of the difficulty of making a rapid diagnosis of the etiologic agent-are often treated with antibiotics and are responsible for a large part of inappropriate and appropriate use of antibiotics in humans. Clinical syndromes overlap considerably, and there is increasing evidence of bacterial-viral co-infections and of bacterial pneumonia being secondary to viral RTI. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] ETIOLOGY A range of different viruses can cause RTIs; the most important are the ortho-and paramyxoviridae, picornaviridae, coronaviruses, and adenoviruses.

Why the SARS epidemic did not continue to spread is subject to much speculation. Explanations include the fact that SARS is most infectious in a later stage of infection, allowing for timely containment, and an extraordinary worldwide effort to control spread. 14, 15 A decade later, another novel coronavirus was found to be associated with acute severe pneumonia in countries in the Middle East. The virus, called Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus, has since caused >2100 infections, 750 of which were fatal, in 27 countries. Most cases originated from countries in the Arabian peninsula with rare travel-related spillovers, including one that caused a large health care facility-related outbreak in South Korea in 2015. More mild and asymptomatic cases are observed with MERS, and mortality is strongly associated with age and co-morbidities. The natural reservoir of MERS coronavirus is dromedary camels, and in Saudi Arabia half of cases are classified as primary, often associated with collection, preparation, and ingestion of milk or meat. The other half results from humanto-human transmission, often associated with health care facilities. Control of MERS coronavirus is difficult because of the stable natural reservoir and the presence of asymptomatic human spreaders. Vaccination of dromedary camels was proposed as an efficient intervention, but unfortunately neutralizing antibodies do not appear to protect against infection or viral shedding. 6,16",

Children may experience repeated episodes of wheezing after recovery. Associations with development of asthma and a causative role of the immune system in pathogenesis have been suggested.",

Viruses reach the small airways either through continuous spread or by inhalation of aerosols. Mucosal infection leads to destruction of epithelial cells, submucosal hyperemia, edema of the airways, and hemorrhaging. Additional cellular infiltration and fibrin depositions may further compromise respiratory volume and gas exchange surface. Viral pneumonia can be part of severe forms of measles and varicella, and may be secondary to generalized infections with EBV or CMV.
