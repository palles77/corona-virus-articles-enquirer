This study analyzed a large collection of the Spike protein coding gene to infer the spatial-temporal diffusion history of PEDV. The studying results suggested that PEDVs in Korea belonged to different genogroups. While classical G1 was continuingly circulating between provinces of Korea, the pandemic G2a were recently introduced from China and USA. By the application of Bayesian phylogeographical analysis, this study demonstrated the spatial-temporal transmission of PEDVs within Korea. Of the recent emerged G2a viruses, J3142 strains showed potential recombination breakpoint (376-2,143nt) of S1 gene between KNU1303 Korea strain G2a (KJ451046) and 45RWVCF0712 Thailand strain G2b (KF724935). The pandemic G2a virus was partial neutralized by the antibodies invoked by the G1-based PED vaccine virus.",

In 2013, PEDV was reported for the first time in North American and now PEDVs are present in all of swine producing countries (Song and Park, 2012; Huang et al., 2013 ; Mole, 2013) .

A Bayesian stochastic search variable selection (BSSVS) approach, which allows the exchange rates in the CTMC to be zero with some prior probability, was used to find a parsimonious set of rates explaining the diffusions in the phylogeny. The analysis was performed using BEAST package v1.8.2 under assumptions of (i) a codon based SRD06 nucleotide substitution model, (ii) a constant population size for the coalescent prior, and (iii) the molecular clock model of uncorrelated lognormal distribution.",

This study tested whether PEDV isolated recently was crossed neutralized by serum of pigs which were vaccinated with Korean PED oral vaccine (Attenuated DR13 strain, Green Cross Veterinary Product Co., Ltd., Yong-In, Korea). The serum neutralizing test (SN test) was conducted using the previous method (Song et al., 2007) , with some modifications. In brief, sera of pigs (n = 25) were heat inactivated at 56 \u2022 C for 30 min and stored at \u221220 \u2022 C until use. The sera were serially two-fold diluted. Subsequently either BM3 (a recent PEDV isolate) or DR13 (PED vaccine strain) of 200 TCID 50 /0.1 ml were mixed at equal volume of the diluted sera. The mixtures were incubated for 1 h at 37 \u2022 C. After incubation, 0.1 ml of each virus-serum mixture was infected to monolayer of Vero cells. The presence/absence of CPE were monitored daily for 5 days. The SN titers were expressed as the reciprocal of the highest serum dilution which resulted in the inhibition of CPE.",

It was obvious that PEDVs are circulating in Korea from the earliest to the latest sequences (years 1997-2015) , the virus were classified into genogroup 1 (G1) and genogroup 2 (subgroups 2a and 2b). For the Korean PEDVs of G1, the viruses were found spanning from 1997 until 2012. Meanwhile, the viruses of G2 (G2b and G2a) were detected from 2008 until 2015. As shown in Fig. 1 , it was clear that the root of Korean G1 and G2b viruses were inferred to be originated from Korea, while the recent Korean PEDVs were derived from China and USA. The result implied that the transmission histories of PEDVs in Korea were diverse, which reflecting both the continuingly circulation of classical G1 and the introduction of the recent pandemic G2a. The detail of spatial-temporal dynamics of PEDVs between provinces of Korea is shown in Figs. 2-4 .",

In this study, J3142 had a variant S1 (Duarte and Laude, 1994; Gallagher and Buchmeier, 2001; Lee et al., 2010) region, suggesting that the recombination between South Korea and Thailand strains had occurred. In Fig. 5 , we used only 411 references for the recombination analysis; thus, it might be possible that in South Korea, there were strains, which are similar to those of Thailand such as 45RWVCF0712, leading to the recombinant event.

The results implied that, the specific antibodies invoked by PED vaccine of G1 inefficiently conferred cross neutralizing activities to the pandemic G2a isolate. Our result was inline with the previous report that suggests that limited cross-reactivity was detected between PED vaccine (of genogroup 1) and field viruses (of genogroup 2). The attenuated PEDV vaccines based on the CV777 strains or DR13-derived strains might be antigenically less related to the newly emergent PEDV strains; thus, the development of new vaccines based on current strains are needed (Chen et al., 2014; Chung et al., 2015; Song and Park, 2012; .",
