Most of these patients arrived in the USA with known EVD and a well-defined plan for transport to biocontainment units (BCUs) selected for their special expertise in managing patients with highly contagious diseases via specially outfitted ambulances. In contrast, one patient traveled from West Africa and presented to a US emergency department (ED) with a febrile illness ultimately determined to be EVD, resulting in transmission of the virus to healthcare providers [1] . The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommended obtaining a travel history and symptom evaluation as a screening regimen for EVD to prepare EDs and other healthcare facilities prepared for these patients to ensure the delivery of quality care that is safe for patients and healthcare providers.",

Epidemiologic risk factors for EVD and exhibiting the signs and symptoms consistent with the disease within 21 days define a patient as a person under investigation (PUI) according to the CDC [3]. Laboratory-confirmed EVD is defined as a patient with a positive test for Ebola virus RNA by a molecular assay. If the PUI presents after having more than 3 days of symptoms, a negative laboratory screen effectively rules out EVD. A PUI with less than 3 days of symptoms and a negative laboratory screen at initial presentation requires follow-up testing 72 h after the onset of symptoms to reliably exclude EVD. In the interim, the PUI must remain in isolation. During this time interval, CDC recommendations require isolation in a single occupancy room with a dedicated bathroom, standard contact and droplet precautions, and the use of appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) by all healthcare personnel [2]. Some hospitals may isolate these patients in inpatient beds or BCUs, but the majority of facilities are likely to hold these patients in the ED or observation areas until the diagnosis of EVD is confirmed or excluded. During the observation period, the PUI may present other signs or symptoms that require further investigation or intervention. The PUI requires ongoing evaluation of their condition with appropriate management to ensure quality patient care [4, 5\u2022\u2022] . During the fall of 2014, the CDC described two PUIs with negative follow-up testing for EVD who ultimately died from the illness that brought them to the hospital and that Befforts to establish alternative diagnoses were reported to have been hampered or delayed because of infection control concerns^ [6] . These reports raise the question of whether some PUIs may receive a different level of care due to their PUI status and the extensive measures necessary to ensure provider safety. To effectively address this challenge, facilities tasked with the care of PUIs must follow a standard process to ensure appropriate and safe care for the PUI. According to the CDC, an Ebola assessment center should Bensure there is no delay in the care for these patients by being prepared to test, manage, and treat alternative etiologies of febrile illness as clinically indicated^[2].",

The described ED processes to provide care for a PUI were developed through an expert review and consensus of healthcare personnel and administrators at the University of Nebraska Medical Center/Nebraska Medicine (UNMC/NM), which is designated as an Ebola treatment center with EVD patient care experience, BCU workflow, ED patient care, and ED workflow. The processes underwent review and modification based on feedback from healthcare providers and experts reviewing instances of patient care when the processes were utilized.

Every patient presenting to the ED is subject to a sequential screening protocol. A positive screen for epidemiologic risk and signs or symptoms consistent with EVD is highlighted in the electronic health record (EHR) and is communicated verbally to initiate immediate minimization of close patient contact, limiting the number of healthcare providers for the PUI, donning of mask and gloves for both the PUI and ED personnel, and escalating PPE requirements for further evaluation and management, if indicated, depending on defined risks. Medical personnel escort the patient to the designated ED isolation area. An ED notification algorithm is initiated by the lead nurse, resulting in immediate notification of all essential personnel, including the ED manager, manager of facilities, BCU executive director, infection control liaison, county health department epidemiologist, public health laboratory technologist on call, and required CDC personnel once evaluation is completed as appropriate.",

Each facility will differ in terms of physical dimensions and layout of the isolation area, but even the smallest EDs must determine the location of a room in a low-traffic area with space nearby that is needed for donning and doffing, equipment storage, and waste management activities. Once a PUI is placed in isolation, construction grade plastic sheeting is applied to effectively screen the area. We use a negative pressure room for the patient care area, while the other two adjacent rooms serve as staging and storage areas for equipment and waste generated by patient care activities. While currently not required by the CDC, a negative pressurized room not only provides additional safety if any body fluids are aerosolized but also allows this protocol to serve as the standard approach to other highly infectious diseases transmitted via the airborne route. The large volume of waste resulting from the care of the PUI requires additional space to allow for safe storage and preparation for disposal. Patient care equipment must remain out of service for a defined time frame prior to disinfection, so it is necessary to plan for storage of this equipment as well in the confined location. The alcove directly outside of the patient care room serves as the space for donning and doffing of PPE [5\u2022\u2022] .",

The nurse also confirms the travel or exposure history with the PUI. A computer with camera and microphone is available in the isolation area, and a second computer in the ED staff station facilitates patient-provider communication. The ED physician then takes the history via video link, focusing on the risk factors for exposure to the Ebola virus and the symptoms consistent with EVD. If the ED physician, in consultation with county public health department officials, determines that the patient does not meet PUI criteria (i.e., confirmed epidemiologic risk factors and presenting symptoms consistent with EVD), the PUI status is discontinued and further evaluation and management proceed in the usual manner. Once PUI status is confirmed, ED leadership must consider the need for additional ED personnel to ensure adequate staffing for the ED [5\u2022\u2022] . After confirmation of PUI status, the physician then must use the previously described PPE to perform the physical examination. Physician donning of PPE follows a sequence that minimizes potential for contamination during patient evaluation and management. Earbuds for a telemedicine stethoscope are inserted prior to placement of the head cover. A digital stethoscope diaphragm is utilized, transmitting heart or lung sounds to the earbuds through wireless technology. Following completion of the examination, a string attached to the earbuds is pulled in a downward motion, disengaging the earbuds from the examiners' external auditory canals. The earbuds are then disposed of in the patient room. The use of this technology alters the standard technique for removal of a stethoscope from a provider's ears by grasping the ear tubes and disengaging the ear tips. As a rule, it is essential to avoid any potential for the provider's hands to touch or come in close proximity to any areas of the face or neck at any time. Following use, the digital stethoscope diaphragm is cleaned and disinfected during room decontamination [5\u2022\u2022] .",

The rRT-PCR assay, which is an approximate 4-h assay, is reliable when testing blood from a PUI who has had more than 3 days of symptoms. A negative result following 3 days of symptoms is considered confirmatory, while a positive result at any point in time related to symptoms onset is considered presumptive and requires confirmatory testing in consultation between the PHL and the CDC. If testing was performed prior to the 3 days of symptoms, a second test is required to exclude EVD. A discussion with the PHL is essential to define the process for transporting specimens to the lab for screening. Under certain circumstances, overnight shipment using a commercial courier is required. When shipping specimens, it is also important to recognize that specimens with the potential to have Ebola virus are handled as Category A infectious substances, as defined by the Department of Transportation (DOT) guidelines.

Any potential for body fluids to aerosolize during a procedure is high risk and requires special consideration. In general, emergent interventions for a PUI are performed in a similar manner as for other ED patients, but the addition of full BCU PPE has proven to be a significant impediment to the standard procedures [16\u2022] . This limitation requires a strategy to prepare the physician performing these procedures and simulation sessions allowing for deliberate practice while in full BCU PPE. Potential emergent interventions for the PUI include the following: central venous access, endotracheal intubation, continuous veno-venous hemodialysis, and mechanical ventilation.",

This constitutes a real risk for contamination and possible transmission of EVD, and, while the recommended PPE for personnel in the patient care area for the PUI provides the protection necessary to prevent aerosolized fluids from contaminating exposed skin of the neck or face, it does not fully address the potential for inhalation of aerosolized body fluids. To mitigate inhalation risk, Powered Air Purifying Respirators (PAPRs) are required during all airway interventions. In addition to the full head and neck hood, PAPRs include a battery-operated blower that draws air into air-purifying elements (i.e., HEPA filter), providing purified air to the user [19] . Personnel engaged in patient care activities that may generate aerosols or splashing of body fluid must don PAPRs. Every effort to prevent aerosolized body fluids is made during the care of the PUI, including specific procedural modifications. To reduce the likelihood of coughing or emesis during airway management, it is desirable to perform rapid sequence induction with full neuromuscular blockade for intubation of PUIs. In addition, video is preferred to direct laryngoscopy, since the direct technique places the provider's face in close proximity to the patient's airway, increasing the risk of contamination if aerosolized fluids are produced [16\u2022] . For ventilated patients, aerosolized sputum may result from both suctioning and off breathing and a closed tubing system including bacterial and viral filters for both expiratory and inspiratory ends of the tubing is necessary to mitigate the risk of aerosol generation and the resultant contamination of the ventilator. In addition to a typical 14 French in-line suction catheter, a safety drain or a closed ventilator circuit drain is included to collect patient secretions. If the patient has hemoptysis, a trap is also added, allowing for the collection of the increased volume of sputum in a safe manner. Any medications delivered via aerosol are administered within this closed system [5\u2022\u2022, 16\u2022] . For the non-intubated patient requiring aerosol treatments, a metered-dose inhaler is preferred, but the potential for coughing and aerosolized secretions is high and PAPRs are recommended for personnel administering these treatments.",

However, at our institution, EVD patients have been intubated and received resuscitative medications [16\u2022] . The physician leading the resuscitation must consider the patient's clinical course and likely etiology of the arrest, but in most cases, a PUI in cardiopulmonary arrest should receive the standard resuscitative measures utilized for any patient, including chest compressions, as the cause of the arrest is most likely due to an etiology other than fulminant EVD [5\u2022\u2022] .

Each hospital must develop their own processes for handling a PUI using the basic principles described in this document. One potential scenario for diagnostic and therapeutic intervention provided by personnel from an area outside of the ED is the PUI with gastrointestinal hemorrhage requiring endoscopy. If at all possible, endoscopy should occur at the bedside in the ED isolation room with the processor fully enclosed in a plastic surgical drape. Following the procedure, the endoscope is cleansed with a quaternary ammonium wipe to remove gross debris and then placed into a sealable plastic biohazard bag. The bag is placed into a hard-sided container with a lid, the outside surfaces are cleaned with a bleach wipe, and the container is held in the contaminated equipment storage area until EVD is confirmed or excluded, at which time a decision on terminal decontamination is defined. In the rare instance when a PUI may require operative management of a condition, the operating room should be secured and left vacant until a negative Ebola virus screen assay is determined in a patient after 72 h of symptoms. Terminal decontamination may then occur according to the final results of EVD testing. Adequate drills to exercise the operative care of a PUI with OR personnel are essential.",

The decontamination process may vary depending on PUI status at the time of transport, allowing the transport service to prestage an ambulance or, preferably, place the patient in a specialized isolation unit during transport. If the PUI was transported within an isolation unit and no spills occurred outside of this unit, then the transport provider may opt to either perform a full decontamination or a limited decontamination according to the transport provider protocol. If the patient was transported in an ambulance with the patient area enclosed in plastic, then the plastic drapes are removed and disposed of after surface decontamination using a hospital grade disinfectant [24] . In addition, the ED and transport provider should have also previously agreed to the proper doffing procedure for the transport personnel, a designated doffing area, and the responsible party for waste disposal.
