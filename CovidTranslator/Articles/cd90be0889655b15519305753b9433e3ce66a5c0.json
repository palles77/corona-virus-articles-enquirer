The TGEV membrane (M) protein is a decisive protein for the proliferation of viral proteins, and is associated with virus assembly and budding. To identify the cellular proteins that interact with the TGEV M protein, yeast two-hybrid screening was employed, and seven cellular proteins were identified M-binding partners. Using the GST pull-down approach and a CO-IP assay, the M protein was found to interact with porcine intestinal cells via eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4-alpha (EIF4A2), an essential component of the cellular translational machinery. Additionally, confocal microscopy revealed that EIF4A2 and M were colocalized in the cytoplasm. Furthermore, the function of EIF4A2 in intestinal cells during TGEV infection was examined. A knockdown of EIF4A2 by siRNA markedly decreased M protein proliferation and TGEV replication in target cells. Thus demonstrating that EIF4A2 plays a significant role in TGEV replication. The present study provides mechanistic insight into the interaction between the TGEV M protein and intestinal cells which contributes to the understanding of coronavirus replication and may be useful for the development of novel therapeutic strategies for TGEV infection.",

The M and E proteins might be thought to be involved in the formation of virus-like particles (VLPs) (Baudoux et al., 1998) . In addition, the gene of M protein is highly conserved and encoded a decisive protein for viral proliferation (ZHENHUI Song et al., 2015) . As an important structural protein of TGEV particles, the M protein is located in the lipid envelop and associates with the Golgi complex in the cell, suggesting that the M protein plays a pivotal role in virus assembly and budding. Additional evidence indicates that the M protein is an indispensable part for the replication of virus particles in host cells, which may also be used for virus-specific diagnostics and treatment (Cologna and Hogue, 1998; De Haan et al., 1998; Zou et al., 2013) . However, there have been few reports regarding the interaction between the TGEV M protein and intestinal cells. The identification of the cellular ligands which interact with viral proteins is likely to provide a better understanding of the dynamics of viral replication, virus-mediated cellular modulation, and pathogenic mechanism.",

The eukaryotic translation initiation factor, EIF4A, is a number of RNA helicase, which is required for the binding of mRNA to 40S ribosomal subunits with function to unwind RNA secondary structures in the 5\u2032-UTR of mRNA. There are three closely related EIF4A proteins in, EIF4A1, EIF4A2, and EIF4A3, which not only participate in initiation and translationare but also https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rvsc.2018.12.005 Received 21 May 2018; Received in revised form 4 December 2018; Accepted 13 December 2018 associated with multiple life processes such as embryogenesis (Lu et al., 2014) . Although both EIF4A1 and EIF4A2 display high protein homology and assemble into the EIF4F complex required for microRNAmediated gene regulation, evidence suggests that EIF4A2, but not EIF4A1, plays a key role in this process of formation of the EIF4F complex (Meijer, 2013) . EIF4A3 is localized in the nucleus, where it plays a role as an mRNA clamp and is related to nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (Chan et al., 2004) .",

Therefore, we aimed to elucidate whether EIF4A2 interacts with the M protein of TGEV and impacts virus replication. In this study, we demonstrate that EIF4A2 in intestinal cells associates with the TGEV M protein and further examined the specific role of EIF4A2 on TGEV replication by knocking down EIF4A2 expression using small interfering RNA (siRNA).",

At 24 h post transfection, the cells were lysed with Trizol and the level of EIF4A2 mRNA expression was detected using RT-qPCR. At 48 h post transfection, the cells were lysed for EIF4A2 protein expression by Western blot. As shown in Fig. 5A , siRNA2 knocked down protein expression more efficiently than the other interference fragment, and quantitative analysis further confirmed a significant inhibitory effect of siRNA2 against EIF4A2 (Fig. 5B) . To investigate the role of EIF4A2 on TGEV replication, EIF4A2 was knocked down in pIECs with siRNA2, which were subsequently infected with TGEV at an MOI of 0.1. The viral loads in the supernatants treated with siRNA2 were significantly lower compared to those of the negative siRNA-and mock-treated groups (P < 0.01 and P < 0.001, respectively) (Fig. 6) . Similarly, compared with the TGEV group, the level of M protein and mRNA expression decreased following the knockdown of EIF4A2 in pIECs and infected with TGEV for 48 h (Fig. 7A and B) . Together, these results suggest that EIF4A2 interacts with the TGEV M protein and impairs TGEV replication. The culture supernatants of the cells and the virus-associated cells infected with TGEV were collected at different points. The viral titers are presented as the averages from three independent samples. **P < 0.01 and ***P < 0.001.",

Thus, identification of host proteins that interact with TGEV viral proteins is a vital for studying the mechanisms of viral pathogenesis. In this study, using a yeast two-hybrid system, we identified seven cellular proteins that can interact with the TGEV M protein. These proteins are primarily related to gene transcription, protein folding, protein degradation and metabolism. Of these, EIF4A2 was identified as a novel M ligand. However, EIF4A2 had not been identified in intestinal cells in previous study, likely due to the different cell types used to construct the cDNA library. In vivo, TGEV replicates in the intestinal epithelial cells of susceptible animals, inducing cell injury, villi atrophy, as well as reduced villous height and crypt depth (Haelterman, 1972; Schwegmann and Herrler, 2006; Xia et al., 2018) . Therefore, it is important to identify host proteins in the natural target cells of TGEV to study viral replication and pathogenesis.",

Our previous research demonstrated that infectious virions entered the intestinal cells by membrane fusion and mature viruses budded into vacuoles, which were gradually to the cell membrane before being released (Song et al., 2016) . Moreover, research into TGEV has established that the M protein as a linker may contribute to initiate the viral particle assembly by interacting with genomic RNA and nucleoproteins in pre-Golgi compartments (Risco et al., 1998) . Therefore, this study provides evidence that host cellular proteins interacting with the TGEV M protein will be serve to futher study of viral replication and pathogenesis. In the present study, EIF4A2 was identified to interact with the TGEV M protein using a GST pull-down assay and Co-IP. EIF4A2 is one of variants (EIF4A1 and EIF4A2) reported in mice and rabbits (Nielsen and Trachsel, 1988) and associates with EIF4A1 to form a complex (Marintchev et al., 2009) . A previous study showed that EIF4A2 acts to limit IBDV replication in infected DF1 cells, which is consistent with our findings that knocking down EIF4A2 expression can inhibit the replication of TGEV in intestinal cells. Furthermore, we identified the mechanism by which EIF4A2 reduced TGEV replication in intestinal cells to be via the down-regulation of M expression.",

For example, EIF4A2 reduces IBDV replication by inhibiting RNA polymerase activity in host cells (Li G et al., 2016) . Similar findings have also been reported that human EIF4A2 was found to interact with the RdRp NS5B of hepatitis C virus by using a yeast two-hybrid system, which may facilitates the genome RNA synthesis of NS5B protein (Kyono et al., 2002) . In the present study, our results suggest that EIF4A2 may be required for TGEV replication. Therefore, EIF4A2 may potentially serve as new therapeutic target for controlling TGEV infection. Elucidating the interactions between host cell and viral components is essential for understanding coronavirus pathogenesis. In this study, the TGEV M protein was shown to interact with the eukaryotic translation initiation factor, EIF4A2. Moreover, the knockdown of EIF4A2 expression with small interfering RNA (siRNA) led to the inhibition of M protein synthesis and decreased viral copy numbers. Since such inhibition occurs during the later stages of the virus replication cycle, inhibition of M protein expression, which plays a key role in the morphological processes of coronaviruses, likely affects the assembly of viral particles, there by leading to decreased TGEV titers released into the supernatant of pIEC. Therefore, EIF4A2 can play a dual role by either forming the EIF4F complex to activate translation or binding to the CCR4-NOT complex to facilitate miRNA-mediated transcription repression (Mathys et al., 2014) . Furthermore, one study showed that cellular miRNAs can inhibit viral infection and that the virus mutates to escape suppression by cellular miRNAs (Zheng et al., 2013) . Therefore, since the underlying mechanism by which EIF4A2/TGEV affects TGEV/ EIF4A2 replication is extremely intricate and may involve cellular miRNAs, further research is required to confirm this mechanism.",
