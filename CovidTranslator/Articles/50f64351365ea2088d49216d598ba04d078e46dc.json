Polyclonal antisera against these 6 viruses were raised in rabbits. No significant differences between viruses were detected by IF. In the HAI test the HCV strain was distinguishable from the 5 BCV strains and serological variation between the BCV strains was shown. HCV could be distinguished by NT test, but all BCV isolates were similar. Two monoclonal antibodies prepared against one of the BCV strains distinguished HCV in all three assays, and detected varying relationships between BCV strains. * Current address: Institute of Virology, Mansfield Road, Oxford OX 1 3 S R, U.K. 242 A.A.

Human coronavirus (HCV-OC43), haemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (HEV) and bovine coronavirus (BCV) form one such group [2, 9, 17] . There has been no extensive serological comparison of BCV strains or investigations into the extent of their relationship with other members of this group. BCV strains M and PQ possessed similar physicochemical and biological properties [3] , but differed by counterimmuno-electrophoresis and immunodiffusion [4] . Four British isolates, 1 from the enteric tract and 3 from the respiratory tract, were compared by a neutralisation (NT) test using pig antisera to three of these isolates. There was complete virus neutralisation with homologous sera and significant cross-reactions with heterologous sera [ 14] . Slight variation in molecular weight of the structural proteins of BCV strains were reported [5, 7, 10, 12] .",

This can be highlighted in the case of BCV by the haemagglutinin and peplomer proteins, both of which elicit neut.ralising activity [6] . In a neutralisation test, if the peplomer protein remained unchanged, differences in the haemagglutinin protein would not be detected using polyclonal antiserum. This also applied in the case of different epitopes on one protein. On the other hand, monoclonal antibodies may be so specific that minor antigenic differences detected by these antibodies may have no biological significance. Alternatively, monoclonal antibodies may be directed against a common antigen and may not detect important differences between strains. For these reasons both monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies were used in three serological tests to determine the extent of differences between isolates.",

It is of interest that the epitope reacting with Mab/S 2/1 allowed a very clear distinction by NT of BCV strains into those possessing this epitope (S 2, M, and PQ), and those without (CK and S 1). By contrast, the IF results showed poor reactivity with M and S 1, and the HAI results showed low reactions only with S 1. It is possible that this is a large epitope containing separate sequences responsible for each serological function accounting for the varying strain relationships. However, the distinction of strain S 1 runs consistently through these results which confirms the findings with polyclonal reagents. There was a marked difference in the relative titres of MAB/S 2/1 for the M strain in the HAI and IF tests. No such difference was detected with any of the other strains.",
