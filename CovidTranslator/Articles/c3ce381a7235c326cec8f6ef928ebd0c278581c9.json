Molecular characterization of infectious samples outside of appropriate biosafety containment can take place only subsequent to pathogen inactivation. Herein, we describe a modified Folch extraction using chloroform/methanol that facilitates the molecular characterization of infectious samples by enabling simultaneous pathogen inactivation and extraction of proteins, metabolites, and lipids for subsequent mass spectrometry-based multi-omics measurements. This single-sample metabolite, protein and lipid extraction (MPLEx) method resulted in complete inactivation of clinically important bacterial and viral pathogens with exposed lipid membranes, including Yersinia pestis, Salmonella Typhimurium, and Campylobacter jejuni in pure culture, and Yersinia pestis, \u2021",

The overall pipeline of inactivation and subsequent proteomic, metabolomic, and lipidomic analyses was evaluated using a human epithelial lung cell line infected with wildtype and mutant influenza H7N9 viruses, thereby demonstrating that MPLEx yields biomaterial of sufficient quality for subsequent multi-omics analyses. Based on these experimental results, we believe that MPLEx will facilitate systems biology studies of infectious samples by enabling simultaneous pathogen inactivation and multi-omics measurements from a single specimen with high success for pathogens with exposed lipid membranes.",

Emerging infectious diseases are often zoonotic and can be transmitted to humans from animals (e.g., Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV); West Nile virus, influenza A viruses, and Ebola) 3 . As recently demonstrated by the 2014 Ebola virus infection diagnoses in the United States, the ease of world travel and increased global interdependence have added complexity to containing these infectious diseases 6 . Similarly, as new infectious diseases evolve and emerge, preexisting infectious diseases re-emerge with new genetic adaptations. For example, novel antigenically distinct subtypes of influenza A viruses that are not recognized by neutralizing antibodies and cause pandemic outbreaks 7 . Overuse of antimicrobial drugs and decreased compliance with vaccination policies has led to the development of resistant pathogens (e.g., drug-resistance Staphylococcus and Campylobacter) 8, 9 and re-emergence of diseases that were previously under control (e.g., Pertussis and Measles) 10, 11 . In addition, uncontrolled neglected tropical diseases such as Dengue fever and West Nile encephalitis that are endemic in developing countries are now emerging in the United States [12] [13] [14] .",

Infectious disease research using a systems biology approach is imperative to understanding host-pathogen relationships and allows for development of new therapies and vaccines [16] [17] [18] . Specifically, proteomics, metabolomics, and lipidomics measurements can assist in unraveling host-pathogen relationships. Proteins are the major effectors of cellular pathways and represent the dynamic expression of information encoded within the genome during infection. Metabolites are intermediates and products of cellular pathways and represent the level at which most pharmaceuticals exert their effects 19 . In addition to having key functions in signaling pathways, energy storage and the structural integrity of cell membranes, lipids also function in host-pathogen interactions and immunomodulation since they act in first line recognition and host cell signaling during pathogen docking, invasion and intracellular trafficking 20 . However, proteomic, metabolomic, and lipidomic characterizations of infectious biological specimens outside of appropriate biosafety level (BSL) containment laboratories can take place only subsequent to pathogen inactivation.",

Pathogens with exposed lipid membranes are more susceptible to disinfectants including detergents and other solvents [23] [24] [25] . Organic solvents render many pathogens non-infectious by solubilizing and disrupting their lipid membranes or envelopes [26] [27] [28] , and inactivation of pathogens by organic solvents has been leveraged for vaccine development [29] [30] [31] [32] , transfusion fluids [33] [34] [35] [36] , and sanitation [37] [38] [39] . In systems biology studies of pathogenic bacteria and viruses, it would be highly efficient to both inactivate pathogens and extract the molecular components needed for proteomic, metabolomic, and lipidomic analyses in a single step. Two of the most highly cited publications for lipid-based extraction methods, Folch et al. 40 and Dyer et al. 41 , use high ratios of organic solvents to sample (e.g., 4:1), illustrating the broad utility of this technique in cell and tissue extraction. Recently, variations of the Folch technique have had broader utility in the extraction of metabolites and proteins [42] [43] [44] [45] .",

During the influenza life cycle, single-stranded viral RNAs migrate to the nucleus where they are copied into mRNA by the viral RNA polymerase complex. Invading viruses do not harbor functional ribosomes in their virions; therefore, viral mRNAs hijack host cell ribosomes and use sophisticated mechanisms 50 to enable selective translation of viral mRNAs. Free fatty acid metabolites myristic acid (14:0) and oleic acid (18:1) significantly increased at 18 h post infection across all 3 viral strains (Fig. 3) . Ceramides (Cer) containing stearic acid (18:0) and tetracosanoic acid (24:0) significantly increased at 18 and 24 h in both AH1 and FM and at 12 h in AH1; likewise, Cer containing stearic acid (18:0) and nervonic acid (24:1) significantly increased at 18 h in both AH1 and FM and at 24 h in FM (Fig. 3) . It has been previously reported that pathogenic avian influenza viruses, such as H7N9, decrease expression of lipid metabolism genes 51 . A NS1 mutation in the FM strain reduces overall pathogenicity; at the early 7 hour time point of infection the wild-type AH1 strain shows over a 30% increase in viral peptide compared to the FM mutant (Fig. 3) . Correspondingly at this 7 h time point ribosome expression is only significantly increased in the AH1 virus and at the late 24 hour time point significant ribosomal expression is increased by over 40% in the AH1 compared to FM.",

Figures 4 and 5 illustrate the bacterial and viral pathogens from this study that contain exposed and embedded lipid membranes; these membranes are denoted with orange color. Of the bacterial pathogens characterized in this study, Y. pestis CO92, S. Typhimurium, and C. jejuni are Gram-negative bacteria, CA-MRSA is a Gram-positive bacterium, and C. difficile 630 is a spore forming Gram-positive bacterium (Fig. 4 ). The exposed walls for Gram-positive bacteria have a higher peptidoglycan (PG) and lower lipid content than Gram-negative bacteria. This bacterial classification is based on the Gram staining method, which differentiates bacteria by the chemical and physical properties of their cell walls; it detects PG, which is present in a thick layer in Gram-positive bacteria 52 . The inner membrane of dormant spores is composed of a bilayer of immobile phospholipids, which has similar phospholipid composition to growing bacteria but exhibits low permeability to small molecules including water 53, 54 . This inner membrane surrounds the spore core which contains the genome. The basic spore architecture is conserved [55] [56] [57] ; outside of the inner membrane is a layer of PG, known as the germ cell wall that is encircled in a thick layer of a modified form of PG, the cortex, which is essential for the acquisition and maintenance of heat resistance. The cortex is surrounded by an outer membrane derived from the mother cell that is essential for spore formation but confers no resistance properties 58 . A proteinaceous coat surrounds the outer membrane. In C. difficile 630 spores, the coat is further enclosed within a structure known as the exosporium. The partial inactivation results presented for CA-MRSA (where only 2 out of 20 experimental replicates still retained a small level of bacterial activity) and C. difficile 630 spores reveals that",

WNV, MERS-CoV, Ebola, and Influenza H7N9 virus all contain lipid bi-layered envelopes (Fig. 5) . WNV virions acquire their lipid envelope by budding into the endoplasmic reticulum of the host cell; Coronaviruses such as MERS-CoV acquire their membranes in the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) and use normal cellular processes to leave the cell; and Ebola and Influenza H7N9 virions acquire their lipid envelopes by budding from host plasma membranes often at lipid raft microdomains that are enriched in sphingomyelin and cholesterol [59] [60] [61] .

Pathogens with internal or protected lipid membranes, such as Gram-positive bacteria and bacterial spores still show a significant decrease in activity (>99% reduction in the number of viable microorganisms after MPLEx treatment) related to both MPLEx solution exposure time and pre-treatment pathogen levels. Even Ad5, a virus without a lipid membrane, showed >99% decreased activity after MPLEx exposure, presumably since non-enveloped viruses can still be susceptible to organic solvent, in particular CHCl 3 , due to the denaturation of proteins that are solvent sensitive 28, 62 . In summary, we believe our MPLEx method for concurrent pathogen inactivation and extraction of samples for multi-omics profiling will be broadly applicable to samples containing clinically important bacterial and viral pathogens with exposed lipid membranes since molecular characterization of infectious samples outside of appropriate biosafety containment can take place only subsequent to complete pathogen inactivation. We note that, for biosafety reasons, this protocol should be evaluated in each investigator's laboratory for efficacy in pathogen inactivation, prior to implementation and particularly for pathogens that were not evaluated in our study.",

Kawaoka, unpublished results).To demonstrate the utility of the MPLEx protocol for both inactivating pathogens and for obtaining high quality metabolite, protein, and lipid fractions for respective omics analyses, we implemented the protocol in a systems biology study of influenza infection in a human lung epithelial cell line. The MPLEx protocol was implemented to extract proteins, metabolites and lipids from Calu-3 cells infected with wild-type (AH1) and mutant (FM) influenza viruses, or mock-infected controls for each of 6 timepoints; 0, 3, 7, 12, 18 and 24 h, and using 5 biological replicates per sample (treatment and timepoint). From this experiment, we quantified 23,688 peptides, 81 metabolites (50 were identified through matching of experimental mass spectra and retention indices to entries in the Agilent Fiehn Metabolomics Retention Time Locked Library)48 , and 251 and 245 lipids from analyses in negative and positive electrospray mode analyses, respectively; therefore as previously reported 46 the number of detected analytes with MPLEx provides comparable or more identifications compared to other methods. To assess reproducibility, we calculated the coefficient of variation (CV) of the 5 biological replicates within each of the datatypes (protein, metabolite, and lipid). For proteomics, metabolomics, and lipidomics, the maximum CV across features within each set of biological replicates was <0.24 (proteomics), < 0.17 (metabolomics), <0.22 (lipidomics data collected under negative electrospray ionization (ESI)), and <0.19 (lipidomics data collected under positive ESI)",
