Up until March 23, 2020, the confirmed cases in 173 12 countries and regions of the globe had surpassed 346,000, and more than 14,700 deaths had resulted. The 13 confirmed cases outside of China had also reached over 81,000, with over 3,200 deaths. In this study, a 14 Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was proposed to analyze and predict the number of confirmed cases. 15 Several cities with the most confirmed cases in China were the focus of this study, and a COVID-19 16 forecasting model, based on the CNN deep neural network method, was proposed. To compare the overall 17 efficacies of different algorithms, the indicators of mean absolute error and root mean square error were 18 applied in the experiment of this study. The experiment results indicated that compared with other deep 19 learning methods, the CNN model proposed in this study has the greatest prediction efficacy. The feasibility 20 and practicality of the model in predicting the cumulative number of COVID-19 confirmed cases were also 21 verified in this study.",

In the following weeks, this disease broke out within China and continued to spread 27 extensively in other countries, causing worldwide panic. The pneumonia caused by this novel coronavirus was 28 officially named the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by the World Health Organization (WHO). The 29 2019 coronavirus epidemic was triggered by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-",

            "text": "73 Moreover, the Galton-Watson branch was used to analogize virus propagation, thus determining the 74 connectivity and transmissibility between China and the destination country. The disadvantage of this method 75 is that the uncertainty regarding the efficacy of control measures against the disease results in difficulties in 76 predicting the development trajectories of the disease. By comparison, Al-Qaness et al. [6] adopted the adaptive 77 neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), an improvement from flower pollination algorithm and salp swarm 78 algorithm, to predict the number of confirmed cases in the next 10 days. The comparison with the ANFIS 79 optimized with GA, PSO, ABC, and FPA indicated that the accuracy of the FPASSA-ANFIS model reached 80 0.97, and the predicted average increase in numbers of new cases in the next 10 days was 10% more than the 81 number of present cases. Jung et al. [7] used the rate of increase together with delayed distribution estimation 82 and statistical induction to establish a mathematical model, based on COVID-2019 case data reported before 83 January 24. The predicted cumulative number of confirmed cases for up until January 24 was 6,924, and the 84 predicted death ratio was 5.3%; these figures were within the 95% confidence interval. Compared with previous 85 methods for establishing mathematical models, Fan et al. [8] adopted a statistical method for predicting the 86 floating population in Wuhan City. The experiment indicated that the floating population in Wuhan region is 87 highly correlated with the number of daily confirmed cases. The residence time of the floating population for 88 local cases was longer than that for non-local cases, which results in a lower predicted number of confirmed 89 cases in the areas around Hubei Province. The prediction results indicate that approximately 80% of the 90 epidemic will be centralized in the top 30 districts. 91 However, applications of deep learning methods have mainly used the genome of the 2019-cCoV virus to 92 predict disease propagation. Yang et al. [9] used the Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed model to 93 integrate the epidemic curve, combining it with the long short-term memory model. The maximum value was 94 reached on February 28, and the curve gradually lowered in late April. Hu et al. [10] used an improved stacked 95 autoencoder and a cluster algorithm to group the instantaneous confirmed cases in every province; they noted 96 a high accuracy in AI-based methods for COVID-19 trajectory prediction. The epidemic was predicted to end 97 in mid-April. Guo et al. [11] used deep learning-based virus host prediction to compare the gene sequence of 98 2019-nCoVs with those of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV), bat SARS corona 99 virus, and Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS-CoV). The bat SARS coronavirus 100 was discovered to have a more similar mode of infection to COVID-19. Metsky et al. [12] used a nucleic acid 101 .",

They discovered that the 109 infectivity of 2019-nCoV may be stronger than SARS, but that disease control efforts are effective.Ming et al.   110    [15] adopted an improved version of the Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) model to predict the actual 111 number of infection cases of 2019-nCoV as well as the actual load on the intensive care units under different 112 diagnosis rates and public health intervention efficacies. They discovered that under a 50% diagnosis rate and 113 no public health intervention, the actual number of cases will be significantly higher than the reported number, 114 whereas under a 70% public health intervention, the load on the health system will decrease substantially. Zhao115 et al. [16] used a probability prediction model to accurately predict the infection nodes from snapshots of 116 spreading. Fountain-Jones et al. [17] used machine learning to establish pathogen-risk models and compared 117 the prediction results of different machine learning methods and explained the results by using game theory. 118 Benvenuto et al. [18] adopted an autoregressive integrated moving average model to predict the epidemic 119 trend and morbidity of 2019-nCoV with a 95% confidence interval. They discovered that if the virus does not 120 mutate, the case number will reach a plateau. Li et al. [19] used a function to separately describe the daily 121 infection and death data of 2019-nCoV in Hubei and outside Hubei. The author thought that the inflection point 122 in the Hubei region was at February 6, 2020, and that the epidemic will end on March 10, 2020, with an 123 estimated infection rate of 39,000 people. However, the data did not include the data after February 12, where 124 such inclusion will increase the predicted figures by 1.4 times. Yang et al. [9] described the clinical 125 characteristics and imaging manifestation of the infected cases of COVID-19 that had been confirmed in the 126 hospitals in Wenzhou area. In addition, the patients with and without travel or residence history in Hubei were 127 compared. Tian et al. [20] analyzed the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 in the Beijing 128 area. The characteristics of severe confirmed cases and common confirmed cases were compared, and the 129 characteristics of COVID-19 and SARS were compared as well. Chen et al. [21] analyzed some cases of 130 pregnant women with COVID-19 and noted no evidence that COVID-19 causes intrauterine infection through 131 vertical transmission among women in late pregnancy. The major contribution of that study is its fast 132 establishment of a prediction model by using deep learning with a small dataset, making it an important 133 reference for other countries in their containment of the COVID-19 epidemic.",

The cumulative number of confirmed cases in the next 345 day is predicted according to the previous five days' total number of confirmed cases, total confirmed new cases, 346 total cured cases, total cured new cases, total deaths, and total new deaths. In the experiment, the datasets of 347 those seven Chinese cities with severe confirmed cases-from Hubei Province, Guangdong Province, and Zhejiang Province-were used for the models' training and prediction. Because the COVID-19 epidemic is 349 ongoing, the algorithm proposed in this study can rapidly use small datasets to establish models with high350 predictive accuracy, different from many other studies. In addition, with the algorithm, a deep learning network 351 prediction model for the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 was established, and the verification and 352 comparison were conducted among different deep learning algorithms. The accuracy and reliability of the deep 353 learning algorithm were verified by having it predict the future trend of COVID-19. Furthermore, experiments 354 for multiple cities with more severe confirmed cases in China indicated that the prediction model of this study 355had the lowest error rate among its counterparts tested. However, at the time of writing, countries other than China have had COVID-19 outbreaks, such as Italy, South Korea, Iran, Spain, France, and Germany. In the 357 future, the establishment of more complete databases will lead to improvements to the proposed prediction 358 model. For example, deep learning networks with a mixed structure can be introduced to establish more accurate 359 models, which can be applied to more countries.
