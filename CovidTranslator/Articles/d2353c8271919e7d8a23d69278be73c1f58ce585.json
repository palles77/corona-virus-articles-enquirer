Up to March 17, 2020 , the virus had resulted in over 190,000 laboratory-confirmed cases of coronavirus disease 2019 and more than 7800 deaths in 163 countries. [2] The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared Covid-19 a public health emergency of international concern and given a \"very high\" risk assessment on global level. [3] A recent report from China showed that the median incubation period of Covid-19 infection was 4 days (interquartile range, 2 to 7). [4] Fever, cough and fatigue are the most common symptoms. [1] Severe cases could rapidly progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and septic shock. The abnormalities on chest computed tomography, particularly the ground-glass opacity and bilateral patchy shadowing, were found in over 80% of patients.

Hence, follow-up antibody testing and monitoring respiratory symptoms for two weeks after de-isolation would be helpful to further reduce the risk of spread. The median incubation period was 5 days (IQR, 2 to 10), very similar as previously reported. [4] The needing time for seroconverting since exposure is significantly longer for patients with long incubation period than for patients with short incubation period (21d v.s. 13d, p<0.001). In contrast, the antibody of patients with longer incubation period appeared on the earlier days post onset (7d.p.o v.s. 10d.p.o, p<0.05). The difference seems not be biased by the competence of host immunity because of the similar age distribution between groups. Hence, it is more likely due to the lower intake dose of virus or less efficiency of virus reproduction in the host. Nevertheless, the longer incubation period does not change the initial viral load when the symptoms onset and also the risk of experiencing critical status. Therefore, in addition to the onset time, the interpretation of the negative findings of antibodies in suspected infections should consider the exposure time as well. The faster seroconversion post onset suggests the longer incubation period.",

It can detect any types of antibodies including IgM, IgG and IgA in principle. Besides, it needs the two Fab arms of the same antibody molecular binding to the coated antigen and the enzyme conjugated antigen, which guarantees the specificity of the test and then allows high concentration of antigens be used for coating and second binding to increase the sensitivity of the assay. Therefore, it is not unexpected that the sensitivity of total antibody detection superiors to that of IgM and IgG detection in our study. Usually, IgM is considered as a marker of current or recent infection, while IgG be a marker of post or recent infection. The implications of total antibody are not so straight and then less being used in clinical practice. However, total antibody test outweighs IgM and IgG if the sensitivity is of the top priority, and has been frequently used in blood transfusion products screening such as human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis C virus. As for current urgently needs of sensitive diagnosis for SARS-CoV-2 infection to contain the spread, Ab test might be a better choice than IgM or IgG, particularly considered the fact that the virus had invaded human society for less than 4 months then the prevalence of antibody induced by post infection is nearly zero.",

LFIA is a rapid point-of-care test, not require special instrument, very convenience and easy to operate but the reading of result is subjective. The establishment of different immunoassays provides flexible choices for the users. The limitations of the study included: 1) only symptomatic infections were enrolled, therefore if the antibody response to asymptomatic infection follows similar features remains to be determined; 2) most blood samples were all collected with one month post onset so the lasting time of antibodies cannot be estimated; 3) the antibody levels had not been exactly titrated. Future studies are needed to better understand the antibody response profile of SARS-CoV-2 infection and to precisely interpret the clinical meaning of serology findings. In conclusion, typical acute antibody response is induced during the SARS-CoV-2 infection. The serology testing provides important complementation to RNA test for pathogenic specific diagnosis and helpful information to evaluate the adapted immunity status of patient. It should be strongly recommended to apply well-validated antibody tests in the clinical management and public health practice to improve the control of Covid-19 infection.
