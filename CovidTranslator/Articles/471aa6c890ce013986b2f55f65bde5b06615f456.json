            "text": "Mis-secreted glycoproteins (LGI1, reelin) are emerging causes of epilepsy. LMAN2L belongs to a glycoprotein secretion chaperone family. One recessive LMAN2L missense mutation predicted to impair the chaperone's interaction with glycoproteins was reported in a family with intellectual disability (ID) and remitting epilepsy. We describe four members of a family with autosomal dominant inheritance of a similar phenotype. We show that they segregate a NM_001142292.1:c.1073delT mutation that eliminates LMAN2L's endoplasmic reticulum retention signal and mislocalizes the protein from that compartment to the plasma membrane. LMAN2L mislocalization, like impaired glycoprotein interaction, disturbs brain development, including generation of developmentally restricted epilepsy.",

            "text": "Lectin mannose-binding (LMAN) is a family of three ubiquitously expressed proteins (LMAN1, LMAN2, and LMAN2L), which, anchored in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) through a C-terminal KRFY sequence interact with glucan chains of select glycoproteins to direct them to extracellular secretion. LMAN1 (ERGIC-53), the best-studied of the group, is so far known to guide five endogenous glycoproteins (Factors V and VIII, Cathepsins C and Z, and a1-antitrypsin) and glycoproteins of five infecting viruses. Complete loss of LMAN1 in humans results in a bleeding disorder and viral resistance, but not a neurological phenotype, indicating that its nervous system function is nonessential. 1 LMAN2 likewise has not been associated with neurological disease. LMAN2L is the least studied of the three; the glycoproteins it processes for secretion are unknown. First evidence that LMAN2L may have a role in brain glycoprotein handling came when genome-wide association studies showed significant association between a polymorphism in LMAN2L and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia. 2,3 Subsequently, a recessively inherited variant, p.R53Q, was found to segregate in affected members of a seven-affected multiplex family with nondysmorphic intellectual disability and remitting epilepsy. The causal nature of this variant was further supported by strong in silico evidence, reviewed below.

However, limited number of patients so far reported with mutations in LMAN2L and lack of evidence from functional assays keeps the issue unsettled. In the present work we identified a second LMAN2L variant associated with a similar phenotype and demonstrated its effect on the protein's critical subcellular localization.",

Their intellectual disability was estimated by the local physician as severe based on language paucity and dependency on relatives. 4 We had the opportunity to perform detailed neuropsychological testing in the present cases at two time points. The degree of intellectual disability is somewhat variable, the father least affected, and the middle boy most affected with complete absence of speech and lowest IQ. All three boys' IQ scores are in the first percentile of the general population, and in the mild range among the intellectually disabled. They all have little to no language and are not capable of independent living.",

The previous mutation being recessively inherited suggests that the present one might operate through a possible dominant-negative mechanism. Alternatively, it is merely happloinsufficient to an extent equivalent to the partial biallelic deficiency of the first mutation. That both mutations are not full loss-of-function suggests that only mutations with particular effects or partial loss of function permit viability. Which brain glycoproteins are processed by LMAN2L is unknown and may include neurotrophins or other secreted glycoproteins involved in neurodevelopment. It may also include secreted glycoproteins associated with epilepsy, for example reelin and LGI1, mutations and non-secretion of which cause lateral temporal lobe epilepsy. 9 Finally, it may include Lgi2, a secreted glycoprotein related to LGI1, mutation, and nonsecretion of which in dogs result in a remitting epilepsy. 10 The neurological syndrome associated with LMAN2L mutation as described in this study and the original report opens a new avenue toward understanding the roles and processing of secreted glycoproteins in brain development and function relevant to epilepsy (including epilepsy remission), intellectual development, and possibly ADHD, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia.",
