Our data indicate that patients with severe COVID-19 exhibited an overall decline of lymphocytes including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, B cells, and NK cells. The number of immunosuppressive regulatory T cells was moderately increased in patients with mild COVID-19. IL-2, IL-6, and IL-10 were remarkably up-regulated in patients with severe COVID-19. The levels of IL-2 and IL-6 relative to the length of hospital stay underwent a similar \" rise-decline\"pattern, probably reflecting the therapeutic effect. In conclusion, our study shows that the comprehensive decrease of lymphocytes, and the elevation of IL-2 and IL-6 are reliable indicators of severe COVID-19.",

In one report, elevation of neutrophil cellularity, serum IL-6, and c-reactive protein was found together with lymphopenia in COVID-19 patients 3 . Other clinical studies indicate that COVID-19 patients develop lymphopenia and high-levels of various cytokines such as G-CSF, IP-10, MCP-1, MIP-1A, and TNF-\u03b1 4, 5 . The surge of proinflammatory cytokines incurred the cytokine storm which might induce viral sepsis and tissue/organ damages to result in shock or even multiple organ failure. SARS-CoV-2specific antibodies seem to be produced in COVID-19 patients, suggesting the mounting of humoral responses 3 . However, the comprehensive status of either innate immunity or adaptive immunity in COVID-19 patients remains largely unknown.",

As indicated in Figure 1A , WBC number was significantly decreased in mild patients as compared with the control group. However, WBC number was not remarkably changed in severe patients. Total lymphocyte number was decreased in severe patients but not in mild patients, suggesting the lymphopenia severe patients ( Figure 1B ). Neutrophils were increased in severe patients but not in mild patients ( Figure 1C ). The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), consistent with the change in lymphocytes, was moderately increased in mild patients and profoundly increased in severe patients, in comparison to the control group ( Figure 1D ). To analyze the adaptive immune cell populations, we conducted flow cytometry analysis on CD45+CD3+ total T cells, CD3+CD4+ T helper cells and CD3+CD8+ cytotoxic T cells ( Figure 1E ). We found a similar decrease in CD45+ lymphocytes in COVID-19 patients ( Figure 1F ). Total T cell number was significantly decreased in COVID-19 patients, but no significant difference was observed between mild and severe patients ( Figure 1G ). Similarly, CD4+ T helper cells and CD8+ cytotoxic T cells were diminished in COVID-19 patients as compared with the control group, but no significant difference was found between mild and severe patients ( Figure 1H & 1I) . The ratio between CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells was not changed ( Figure 1J) .",

As demonstrated in Figure 4B , as compared with controls, IL-2 was considerably increased in severe patients but not in mild patients. IL-4 was remarkably raised in mild patients but not in severe patients ( Figure 4C ). IL-6 was significantly increased in severe patients but not in mild patients ( Figure 4D ). Like IL-2 and IL-6, IL-10 and TNF-\u03b1 were significantly increased in severe patients but not in mild patients ( Figure 4E & 4F) .",

Interestingly, Tregs, which play a crucial role in immunoregulation and anti-inflammatory response 10 , were elevated in mild patients, suggesting a possible immunosuppression. In severe patients, the Tregs cellularity was comparable to that in control individuals, probably due to an overall T cell deficiency.

It is noteworthy that both IL-2 and IL-6 were dramatically up-regulated in severe patients on day 15-20 after inpatient admission and then declined. This similar pattern might suggest the aggravation of the disease and the following remission caused by therapies. However, more data are in demand to accurately explain the changes. Surprisingly, IFN-\u03b3, which is a crucial anti-viral cytokine produced by both CD4+ T cells, CD8+T cells, NK cells and macrophages 17, 18 , remained at a low level in COVID-19 patients. It has been reported that IFN-\u03b3 participated in the cytokine storm in SARS patients 19 . Perhaps serum IFN-\u03b3 remains unchanged while IFN-\u03b3 in the lung tissue is elevated. More investigations are needed to test this hypothesis. Moreover, IFN-\u03b3 can downregulate the expression of the SARS coronavirus receptor ACE2 in a lab study 20 . SARS-CoV-2 seems to bind to the same receptor to infect target cells 21 . Hence, the potential effect of IFN-\u03b3 against SARS-CoV-2 infection needs further research.",
