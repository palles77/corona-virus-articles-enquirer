These messages express despair at the current situation -and also a sense of hopelessness, helplessness, and nervous anticipation at what may yet come to pass. With the permission of the senders, I will quote some of these messages throughout this editorial. Shea and Hurley defined hopelessness as \"the feeling that any effort aimed at constructive change\u2026 is doomed before it is even attempted\" (Shea & Hurley, 1964) . They also defined helplessness as \"the conviction that everything that can be done has been done, which results in an inability to mobilize energy and effort\u2026\" (Shea & Hurley, 1964) . It is hardly surprising that challenging times such as these may induce states of both hopelessness and helplessness in trainees', who may still be finding their feet in the clinical world. Furthermore, extreme life stressors such as this may also cause us to 'rubber band' back to negative emotions from our own pastfurther compromising our mental wellbeing.",

This may add three further stressors/dilemmas -the consideration of which may further tax trainees' mental wellbeing: How do units/departments function with significantly fewer staff on a daily basis? Are junior trainees being provided with adequate supervision and support in these difficult times? And how do we decide between self-isolation and leaving units un-staffed? Self-isolation will likely, by very definition, also reduce individuals' interaction with others. This in itself may put the mental wellbeing of trainees in further jeopardy as they begin to self-isolate, as we know that maintaining relationships with those around us are \"important in supporting people and providing resilience\" (Ivbijaro et al., 2019) .",

These may be reasonable measures to ensure that patient care remains both safe and effective during these difficult times, but they do form a double-edged sword. Research has shown that time off is important (Etzion, 2003) . Holidays may lead to short-term reductions in stress levels, and a more prolonged reduction in the risk of burning out (Etzion, 2003) . Etzion defines burnout as \"a psychological strain caused by continuous Stressors which erode individuals' coping resources over the long term, until they reach the point of physical and emotional and mental exhaustion\" (Etzion, 2003) . To that end, the aforementioned measures may have the potential to prevent recuperation from work-related stress and, subsequently, may lead to staff burnout and more shortages later down the line.",

Put simply, this refers to a mental state of helplessness, which has been induced through repeated (failed) attempts to escape a harmful situation -they have learnt that their fate is out of their control. Whilst the cancellation of leave and rotations may yet prove to be a short-term measure, it still holds the potential to induce helpless states in trainees. The development of learned helplessness, however, may be dependent on our next move, and Trusts' openness to the humanity of the individual circumstances of trainees. We have a duty of care to these trainees and, where possible, should strive to prevent a culture of learned helplessness developing.",

Goodman et al defined resilience as \"the interactive and dynamic process of adapting, managing, and negotiating adversity\" (Goodman, Saunders, & Wolff, 2020) . Various ways of promoting resilience have been suggested throughout the broad, existing literature. For example, Denkova et al found that offering short-term training in mindfulness improved markers of resilience in firefighters (Denkova, Zanesco, Rogers, & Jha, 2020) . Furthermore, some research has suggested that feelings of empowerment and of belonging may help to promote resilience (Oldfield, Stevenson, & Ortiz, 2020) .
