The current terminology is to call this type of infection a health care-associated infection (HAI). In 2002, the estimated number of HAIs in U.S. hospitals was 1.7 million, resulting in about 99,000 deaths. 1 The major source of HAI is likely the patient's endogenous flora, but up to 40% of HAIs can be caused by cross infection via the hands of health care workers. 2 An infectious disease process generally has a primary site of origin; however, it may result in diffuse systemic effects that may limit the patient's functional mobility and activity tolerance. Therefore a basic understanding of these infectious disease processes is useful in designing, implementing, and modifying physical therapy treatment programs. The physical therapist may also provide treatment for patients who have disorders resulting from altered immunity. These disorders are mentioned in this chapter because immune system reactions can be similar to those of infectious disease processes (see Appendix 13-A for a discussion of four common disorders of altered immunity: systemic lupus erythematosus, sarcoidosis, amyloidosis, and rheumatoid arthritis).",

A pleural tap, or thoracentesis, is the process by which a needle is inserted through the chest wall into the pleural cavity to collect pleural fluid for examination of possible malignancy, infection, inflammation, or any combination of these. A thoracentesis may also be performed to drain excessive pleural fluid in large pleural effusions. 16 Pericardiocentesis. Pericardiocentesis is a procedure that involves accessing the pericardial space around the heart with a needle or cannula to aspirate fluid for drainage, analysis, or both. It is primarily used to assist in diagnosing infections, inflammation, and malignancies and to relieve effusions built up by these disorders. 17 Synovial Fluid Analysis. Synovial fluid analysis, or arthrocentesis, involves aspirating synovial fluid from a joint capsule. The fluid is then analyzed and used to assist in diagnosing infections, rheumatic diseases, and osteoarthritis, all of which can produce increased fluid production within the joint. 18 Gastric Lavage. A gastric lavage is the suctioning of gastric contents through a nasogastric tube to examine the contents for the presence of sputum in patients suspected of having tuberculosis. The assumption is that patients swallow sputum while they sleep. If sputum is found in the gastric contents, the appropriate sputum analysis should be performed to help confirm the diagnosis of tuberculosis. 16, 19 Historically, gastric lavage has also been administered as a medical intervention to prevent absorption of ingested toxins in the acutely poisoned patient, although its use for this purpose is now rarely recommended. 20 Peritoneal Fluid Analysis. Peritoneal fluid analysis, or paracentesis, is the aspiration of peritoneal fluid with a needle. It is performed to (1) drain excess fluid, or ascites, from the peritoneal cavity, which can be caused by infectious diseases, such as tuberculosis; (2) assist in the diagnosis of hepatic or systemic malfunctions, diseases, infection such as spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), or malignancies; and (3) help detect the presence of abdominal trauma. 16, 19, 21 process or organism.

Leukocyte, or WBC, count is measured to determine whether an infectious process is present and should range between 5000 and 10,000 cells/mm 3 . 3 An increase in the number of WBCs, termed leukocytosis, is required for phagocytosis (cellular destruction of microorganisms) and can indicate the presence of an acute infectious process. 11 Leukocytosis can also be present with inflammation and may occur after a surgery with postoperative inflammation. 8 A decreased WBC count from baseline, termed leukopenia, can indicate altered immunity or the presence of an infection that exhausts supplies of certain WBCs. 11 A decreased WBC count relative to a previously high count (i.e., becoming more within normal limits) may indicate the resolution of an infectious process. 11 Differential White Blood Cell Count. Five types of WBCs exist: lymphocytes, monocytes, neutrophils, basophils, and eosinophils. Specific types of infectious processes can trigger alterations in the values of one or more of these cells. Detection of these changes can assist in identification of the type of infection present. For example, an infection caused by bacteria can result in a higher percentage of neutrophils, which have a normal range of 2.0 to 7.5 \u00d7 10 9 /liter. In contrast, a parasitic infection will result in increased eosinophils, which have a normal count of 0.0 to 0.45 \u00d7 10 9 /liter. 11 Antibody Measurement. Antibodies develop in response to the invasion of antigens from new infectious agents. Identifying the presence and concentration of specific antibodies helps in determining past and present exposure to infectious organisms. 12 ",

Two types of staining techniques are available: simple staining and the more advanced differential staining.

This separation assists in determining subsequent measures to be taken for eventual identification of the organism. A specimen is placed on a microscope slide, and a series of steps are performed. 13 A red specimen at completion indicates a gramnegative organism, whereas a violet specimen indicates a gram-positive organism. 13 Culture. The purpose of a culture is to identify and produce isolated colonies of organisms found within a collected specimen. Cells of the organism are isolated and mixed with specific media that provide the proper nourishment and environment (e.g., pH level, oxygen content) needed for the organism to reproduce into colonies.

Clinical manifestations and management of HAIs vary according to the type of pathogen and the organ system involved.

It is a gram-negative coccobacillus that has become one of the most important pathogens, particularly in the intensive care unit (ICU). AB infections in the hospital can cause serious complications such as ventilatorassociated pneumonia (VAP), bloodstream infection, wound infections, and nosocomial meningitis. 39, 40 AB is remarkable in that it is ubiquitous, exists in diverse habitats (e.g., human skin), can survive for long periods of time on dry inanimate surfaces (e.g., hospital bed rails) and as already",

The agreed-on definitions are MDR as acquired nonsusceptibility to at least one agent in three or more antimicrobial categories, XDR as nonsusceptibility to at least one agent in all but two or fewer antimicrobial categories (i.e., remaining susceptible to only one or two categories), and PDR as nonsusceptibility to all agents in all antimicrobial categories.",

Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) is a strain of Staphylococcus that is resistant to methicillin or similar agents, such as oxacillin and nafcillin. Methicillin is a synthetic form of penicillin and was developed because S. aureus developed resistance to penicillin, which was originally the treatment choice for S. aureus infection. However, since the early 1980s, this particular strain of S. aureus has become increasingly resistant to methicillin. The contributing factor that is suggested to have a primary role in the increased incidence of this HAI is the indiscriminate use of antibiotic therapy. 30, 33 In addition, patients who are at risk for developing MRSA infection in the hospital are patients who 33-35 : \u2022 Are debilitated, elderly, or both \u2022 Are hospitalized for prolonged time periods \u2022 Have multiple surgical or invasive procedures, an indwelling cannula, or both \u2022 Are taking multiple antibiotics, antimicrobial treatments, or both \u2022 Are undergoing treatment in critical care units MRSA is generally transmitted by person-to-person contact or person-to-object-to-person contact. MRSA can survive for prolonged periods of time on inanimate objects, such as telephones, bed rails, and tray tables, unless such objects are properly sanitized. Hospital personnel can be primary carriers of MRSA, as the bacterium can be colonized in healthy adults. MRSA infections can be diagnosed via nasal swabs. 36 Management of MRSA is difficult and may consist of combining local and systemic antibiotics, increasing antibiotic dosages, and applying whole-body antiseptic solutions. In recent years, vancomycin has become the treatment of choice for MRSA; however, evidence has shown that patients with this strain of S. aureus are also developing resistance to vancomycin (vancomycin intermediate S. aureus-VISA). 30 Therefore prevention of MRSA infection is the primary treatment strategy and includes the following 26,33-35 : ethmoid, sphenoid, and maxillary).

This cycle is then repeated for a variable time frame between 2 and 12 weeks, after which time the individual is considered to be infected with TB and will test positive on tuberculin skin tests, such as the Mantoux test, which uses tuberculin-purified protein derivative,* or the multiple puncture test, which uses tuberculin. At this point, the infection enters a latent period (most common) or develops into active TB. 49, 50 A six-category classification system has been devised by the American Thoracic Society and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to describe the TB status of an individual. 49 ",

It occurs primarily in children who are between the ages of 6 and 15 years. Rheumatic fever is characterized by nonsuppurative inflammatory lesions occurring in any or all of the connective tissues of the heart, joints, subcutaneous tissues, and central nervous system. An altered immune reaction to the infection is suspected as the cause of resultant damage to these areas, but the definitive etiology is unknown. Rheumatic heart disease is the term used to describe the resultant damage to the heart from the inflammatory process of rheumatic fever. 16, 34, 63, 64 Cardiac manifestations can include pericarditis, myocarditis, left-sided endocarditis, and valvular stenosis and insufficiency with resultant organic heart murmurs, as well as congestive heart failure. If not managed properly, all of these conditions can lead to significant morbidity or death. 16, 34, 63 Management of rheumatic fever follows the treatment for streptococcal infection.

If paralysis does occur, it is generally associated with fever and muscle pain. The paralysis is usually asymmetric and involves muscles of respiration, swallowing, and the lower extremities. Paralysis can resolve completely, leave residual deficits, or be fatal. 16, 66 Management of poliomyelitis primarily consists of prevention with inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) given as four doses to children from the ages of 2 to 6 years of age. 66 If a patient does develop active poliomyelitis, then other management strategies may include the following 16 : \u2022 Analgesics and antipyretics \u2022 Bronchopulmonary hygiene \u2022 Bed rest with contracture prevention with positioning and range of motion Postpoliomyelitis Syndrome.

The general treatment course for acute osteomyelitis is early and aggressive administration of the appropriate antibiotics to prevent or limit bone destruction. 3, 56, 72, 73 Chronic osteomyelitis is an extension of the acute cases just discussed. It results in marked bone destruction, draining sinus tracts, pain, deformity, and the potential for limb loss. Chronic osteomyelitis can also result from infected surgical prostheses or infected fractures. Debridement of dense formations (sequestra) may be a necessary adjunct to the antibiotic therapy. If the infection has spread to the surrounding soft tissue and skin regions, then grafting, after debridement, may be necessary.

It is a retrovirus, occurring in pandemic proportions, that primarily affects the function of the immune system. Eventually, however, all systems of the body become affected directly, such as the immune system, or indirectly, as in the cardiac system, or through both methods, as occurs in the nervous system. The virus is transmitted in blood, semen, vaginal secretions, and breast milk through sexual, perinatal, and blood or blood-product contact. Proteins on the surface of the virus attach to CD4+ receptors, found primarily on T4 lymphocytes. 86 Other types of cells found to house the virus include monocytes, macrophages, uterine cervical cells, epithelial cells of the gastrointestinal tract, and microglia cells. 86 On entering the cell, the viral and cellular DNA combine, making the virus a part of the cell. The exact pathogenesis of cellular destruction caused by HIV is not completely understood, and several methods of destruction may be entailed. It is known that immediately after initial infection, HIV enters a latent period, or asymptomatic stage, in which viral replication is minimal, but CD4+ T cell counts begin to decline. 86 Continued reduction results in decreasing immunity, eventually leading to symptomatic HIV, in which diseases associated with the virus begin to appear. 86 This eventually leads to the onset of AIDS, which the CDC defines as occurring when the CD4+ T-lymphocyte count falls below 200 cells/\u00b5l (reference = 1000 cells/\u00b5l) or below 14%; when 1 of 26 specific AIDS-defining disorders is contracted, most of which are opportunistic infections; or a combination of these factors. 87, 88 or Salmonella. However, most cases of gastroenteritis are caused by viruses. Rotavirus and norovirus are by far the most frequent cause of gastroenteritis; adenovirus and astrovirus also commonly cause gastroenteritis, especially in children. Transmission of both bacterial and viral gastroenteritis is usually through the ingestion of contaminated food, water, or both or by direct and indirect fecal-oral transmission.",

Historically, rotavirus has caused 500,000 childhood deaths annually in the world in less-developed countries. In the United States, 50% of gastroenteritis pediatric cases requiring hospitalization or emergency room visits are caused by rotavirus, and the total health and societal costs of rotavirus infections are estimated to exceed $1 billion per year. Fortunately, the annual pediatric death rate in the United States is relatively low (20 to 60 deaths). Rotavirus is very contagious in that the virus can survive on dry surfaces for up to 10 days and on human hands for up to 4 hours. It also has a low infectious dose (10 or fewer particles) and the infected stool can contain up to 10 11 particles per gram that are present before and up to 2 weeks after the onset of symptoms. Because of its highly contagious nature, it is estimated that for every 4 children admitted to the hospital with a rotavirus infection, 1 additional child acquires it as an HAI. Rotavirus infections also may be transmitted to adults who are around infected children, immunocompromised individuals, and older adults in nursing homes. Fortunately, the newly developed secondgeneration rotavirus vaccines have proven to be effective and have fewer serious side effects (e.g., intussusception [intestinal invagination]). [78] [79] [80] [81] Norovirus (formally known as Norwalk virus, calicivirus, or small round-structured viruses) is a single-stranded positive sense RNA virus and is the most common cause of nonbacterial gastroenteritis worldwide. These outbreaks occur where groups of individuals gather, including nursing homes, hospitals, restaurants, and cruise ships. Like the rotavirus, norovirus is very contagious (<10 particles can cause infection) and can survive for up to 4 weeks in a dried state at room temperature. In A major advancement in the medical treatment of HIV has been antiretroviral therapy. This therapy consists of four classes of medications (see Chapter 19,  ",

It can be used to diagnose acute infection, to screen blood for HIV antigens, to determine HIV infection in difficult diagnostic cases, or to evaluate the treatment effects of antiviral agents. 5. PCR for HIV nucleic acid. This highly specific and extremely sensitive test detects viral DNA molecule in lymphocyte nuclei by amplifying the viral DNA. It is used to detect HIV in neonates and when antibody tests are inconclusive. 6. Rapid HIV testing. This highly sensitive and specific test requires a sample of blood, serum, plasma, or oral fluid to detect HIV antibodies. This test can be complete in 20 minutes.",

A false-negative HIV test can occur if an individual has not yet developed HIV antibodies. If an individual has had exposure to HIV, he or she should have a repeat HIV test to ensure a true negative result. 93 Once HIV has been detected, it can be classified in a number of ways. The Walter Reed staging system has six categories grouped according to the quantity of helper T cells and characteristic signs, such as the presence of an HIV antigen or antibody. 94 However, a more commonly used classification system was devised by the CDC and was last updated in 1993. In this system, infection is divided into three categories, depending on CD4+ T-lymphocyte counts: 1. Category 1 consists of CD4+ T-lymphocyte counts greater than or equal to 500 cells/\u00b5l. involvement may occur as rare complications from mononucleosis.

The best modes of preventing the transmission of infectious diseases are to adhere to the standard precautions established by the CDC and to follow proper hand-washing techniques (Box 13-2). a. Facilities' warning or labeling systems for biohazards and infectious materials may vary slightly. b. Be sure to check the patient's medical record or signs posted on doors and doorways for indicated precautions. c. Table 13 -3 provides an outline of the types of personal protective equipment that should be worn with specific precautions. 2. Personally follow and also educate patients concerning proper coughing and sneezing hygiene etiquette in order to prevent the spread of disease and illness. a. Cover the mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing or sneezing. b. Put the used tissue in a waste basket. the infection rate of airborne diseases such as measles, TB, influenza, and SARS. The cross-infection problem of the 2002-2003 SARS epidemic was particularly evident where people congregated, such as in airplanes, buses, and hospitals. This would imply a strong benefit for exposing patients to as much fresh air as medically prudent, which is reminiscent of the philosophy behind the \"open-air treatment\" TB hospitals of the last century. 112, 113 When one obtains the proper balance of exercise and rest, it helps the immune system fight off infection. Exercise and adequate rest are key factors in promoting a healthy psychological state, which also reduces the negative effects of stress (e.g., high levels of cortisol) on the immune system. However, it should be mentioned that the beneficial effects of resistive exercise (as opposed to cardiovascular exercise) on immunity are less clear, though excessive cardiovascular exercise may lead to immunosuppression. The key role that the crucial rest-promoting hormone melatonin plays in influencing our circadian rhythm (sleep-wake cycle) and immune system (specifically T cell populations) is still being unraveled. Melatonin's peak production occurs at night, which is the inverse of another key immunoregulatory hormone, vitamin D. In order to maximize melatonin levels, which promote sleep efficiency and restfulness, one should exercise regularly, be exposed to natural light (sunlight) especially early in the day, minimize exposure to artificial light at night, and go to bed 2 to 3 hours before midnight in a completely dark room. It is important to follow this advice every day because melatonin has a short half-life and thus must be produced every 24 hours. 110, [114] [115] [116] [117] [118] [119] Alcohol exposure has a well-known immunosuppression effect, which includes negative impacts on lymphocyte activation, cytokine production by macrophages and T cells, and neutrophil function. This results in increased susceptibility to infection and reduces the body's ability to heal after injury. People who smoke and those who are exposed (especially children) to passive or environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) are at greater risk of impairing their immune system, which can cause infections such as influenza and TB for adults and serious respiratory tract infection and pneumonia for children. Caffeine is largely antiinflammatory in nature and thus has an overall negative effect on the immune system. Specifically, caffeine suppresses lymphocyte function, antibody production, and neutrophil and monocyte chemotaxis. Illicit drug users also have well-documented higher infection rates involving bacteria, viruses, fungi, and protozoans. These rates are even higher in injection drug users. [120] [121] [122] [123] Finally, obesity has now been associated with increased infection risk. Increased infection has been observed in obese patients with conditions as diverse as urinary tract infection (UTI), influenza, hepatitis C, and a history of total hip arthroplasty. With obesity rates increasing throughout the world, the exact mechanism of the link between obesity and infection warrants more study. [124] [125] [126] [127] Physical Therapy Intervention",

            "text": "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease characterized by uncontrolled proliferation of synovial tissue. 12 It is a chronic disease involving systemic inflammation, with periods of exacerbation and remission. 13 The etiology is not fully understood, but it is believed there is a correlation between environmental and genetic factors. Females have an increased risk of developing RA, as do individuals with a positive family history, silicate exposure, or smoking history. 12 There are two forms of RA: juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) and adult RA. JIA occurs most often during the toddler and early adolescent developmental phases, whereas adult RA has a peak onset in the third and fourth decades of life. Both forms of RA have an inflammatory component in disease development and have similar medical management strategies. 13 With RA, an interaction between autoantibodies (rheumatoid factors) and immunoglobulins initiates the inflammatory process, which involves an increased infiltration of leukocytes from the peripheral circulation into the synovial joint. Pannus-a destructive granulation tissue that dissolves periarticular tissues-can develop, ultimately leading to joint destruction. 13 Clinical manifestations of RA can include articular and extra-articular symptoms. Most body systems may be involved, including pulmonary, cardiovascular, neurologic, and gastrointestinal. 13 The joints most commonly affected by RA are those with the highest ratio of synovium compared to articular cartilage, including the wrist, proximal interphalangeal, and metacarpophalangeal joints. 12 Common deformities associated with RA are ulnar drift, swan-neck, and boutonniere deformities. 13 Other symptoms include anorexia, low-grade fever, fatigue, and malaise. 12 Osteoarthritis (OA), also called degenerative joint disease, may result in joint changes and deformation. Table  13A -1 compares OA and RA. 13 Diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis can be made through the following seven criteria established by the American Rheumatism Association 12 : 1. Morning stiffness 2. Arthritis of three or more joint areas 3. Hand joint involvement 4. Symmetric arthritis 5. Rheumatoid nodules 6. Serum rheumatoid factor positive 7. Radiographic changes of the wrist and hand joints",
