The structural 19 characteristics of the giant panda pMHC-I complex, including the unique pockets in the 20 peptide-binding groove (PBG), were analyzed in detail.

Structural studies of have shown that the complex is generally composed of an MHC-I, \u03b22-microglobulin (\u03b22m), 48 and peptide (pMHC-I) (3). The MHC-I contains \u03b11, \u03b12 and \u03b13 domains in its extracellular 49 region, with the \u03b11 and \u03b12 domains forming the pMHC-I peptide-binding groove (PBG) (4-9). 50 Antigen peptides 8-11 amino acids in length are loaded onto the PBG and subsequently 51 recognized by TCR expressed on the surface of CD8 + T cells (10) . Interactions between the 52 pMHC-I complex and TCR form the first signal for the activation of antigen-specific CD8 + T 53 cells (11). The direct interaction between TCR and pMHC-I demonstrates the MHC-I-54 restriction nature of CD8 + T cell recognition and indicates a close evolutionary relationship 55 between pMHC-I and TCR (12, 13) . It is widely accepted that in addition to direct interaction 56 with TCR, MHC-I engagement of the CD8 coreceptor is required for the functional activation 57 of CD8 + T cells (14). The transmembrane glycoprotein CD8 molecules bind to pMHC-I and 58 recruit the Src tyrosine kinase p65lck (Lck) to the TCR-pMHC-I complex, resulting in the 59 assembly of a TCR-pMHC-I-CD8 ternary complex (15). Therefore, the presentation of various 60 endogenous peptides by the pMHC-I complex is key in determining whether the antiviral CTL 61 immune response is initiated. 62",

The polymorphism of MHC-I molecules causes 65 variation in PBGs in various mammalian pMHC-I complexes, which triggers various types of 66 CTL immune responses. Although there are many reports of mammalian pMHC-I complexes, 67 no study has yet been conducted on the pMHC-I structure in the bear family (Ursidae), which 68 includes the giant panda. The bear family includes 5 genera and 8 species. Classical MHC-I 69 genes and polymorphisms in the giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca), brown bears and the 70 Asiatic black bear have been reported. Phylogenetic studies indicate that although the giant 71 panda belongs to the bear family, divergence between the giant panda and other bears occurred 72 approximately >17 million years ago (21). The giant panda has an estimated population size of 73 approximately 2500 individuals worldwide, and its classical MHC-I/II genes are located on 74 chromosome 9q (22). The large genetic region of MHC-I is believed to play critical roles in 75 CTL immunity.

Extensive comparison of pAime-128 with 199 other pMHC-I structures deposited in the Protein Data Bank showed that the main chain of the 200 CCV-NGY9 peptide has a characteristic conformation similar to that presented by HLA-201 B*0801 (Fig 4B) . Ternary TCR-peptide-HLA-B*0801 structure of epitope HCV-HSK9 202 (HSKKKCDEL, hepatitis C virus-derived) showed that the protruding residue Lys-4 in HCV-203 HSK9 plays important roles in TCR recognition (31, 32). In pAime-128, the side chain of P6-204 Phe pointed upward for solvent exposure, similar to the side chain of Lys-4 in HCV-HSK9 ( Fig  205   4A and B) . 206 With different peptide presentation modes observed for pAime-128, it is necessary to clarify 207 the critical anchors for the peptide bound to Aime-128. Therefore, the stabilities of the CCV-208 NGY9 peptide and its mutants with alanine substitution at each position bound with Aime-128 209 were measured through circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy (Fig 4C and D) . The midpoint 210 transition temperature (Tm) value of the wild-type CCV-NGY9 peptide was determined to be 211 49.3\u00b0C. Compared with the CCV-NGY9 peptide, the CCV-P9A-substituted peptide showed a 212 dramatic decrease in stability with the lowest Tm at 39.4\u00b0C, while the peptide mutants CCV-213 P1A and CCV-P5A had lower Tms of 47.2\u00b0C and 47.4\u00b0C, respectively, indicating a minor 214 decrease in stability. The remaining peptide mutants showed different levels of enhanced 215 stability, with Tms ranging from 49.5\u00b0C to 54.8\u00b0C (Fig 4C and D) . These data indicated that 216 for peptides bound to Aime-128, P\u2126 plays a pivotal role in peptide anchoring since it cannot 217 be replaced by alanine.

Notably, the mutant CCV-P2A displayed the 219 highest Tm of 54.8\u00b0C, suggesting that the mutation of P2-G to comparatively large amino acids 220 might increase the stability of pAime-128 complexes. Based on this finding and the peptide 221 screening results (Table 1) showed that the AB loop of pAime-128 and other mammal pMHC-I structures does not contact 227 \u03b22m (Fig 5A-E) , whereas the AB loop binds \u03b22m via hydrogen bonds only in nonmammals 228 (Fig 5F, G) . Furthermore, the CD and EF loops of mammals are longer than those of 229 nonmammals (Fig 5A) , because mammalian MHC-I contains two more amino acids than 230 nonmammalian MHC-I (Fig 2) . 231 The antigenic peptides presented by pMHC-I complexes are eventually scanned and recognized 232 by TCRs to initiate MHC-I-restricted CD8 T cell immunity. Extensive structural studies have 233 illustrated that the TCR repertoire specific for a certain antigenic peptide is determined by the 234 conformations of both the peptide and the restricted MHC-I element (12, 33). Comparisons 235 with MHC-I structures with known TCR docking strategies revealed that the exposed Aime- Glu 166 and Trp 167 have great potential to interact with TCRs (Fig 6A) . Although most of these 238 residues are highly conserved or preferentially used among different species, rarely used 239 residues were observed in Aime-128, including Ile 66 , Asp 69 , Arg 155 and Asn 158 (Fig 2) . 240",

In this study, the 3D structure of giant panda classical MHC-I 267 complexed with viral peptide derived from CCV spike protein was determined for the first time, 268 and several unique features of panda pMHC-I were identified.. very different from one another (Fig 2) . The results suggest that the antigen-peptide presenting 276 profiles of the panda individuals are different, especially the homology of the \uf0611 region, which 277 can be as low as approximately 57%. This difference may be quite remarkable. Thus, the 278 classical MHC-I binding antigen-peptide profile of pandas is diverse. These findings indicate 279 the high-throughput antiviral CTL immune response potential of Ursidae. 280 A second notable finding is that in the PBG pockets, the 9 residues constituting pocket A can 281 be found in most giant panda MHC-I molecules, though 2 residues, Asn 63 and Glu 163 , are rare 282 among known MHC-I molecules. Due to the presence of the Asn 63 residue, the pAime-128 283 complex pocket A is reasonably tight. The 8 residues that constitute pocket B can be found in 284 almost all classical panda MHC-I molecules, although Asn 63 , Ile 66 , Ala 67 and His 99 are rare 285 among known panda MHC-I molecules. Moreover, 5 residues constitute pocket C, but these 286 residues are not highly conserved in mammalian MHC-I molecules (2). Similarly, 5 residues 287 constitute pocket D, but Glu 152 and Arg 155 are not conserved. Therefore, although some amino 288 acids are highly conserved in the composition of certain pockets, the different amino acids result 289 in distinctive pocket conformations and a unique pAime-128 PBG for presenting viral epitope 290 peptides with specific characteristics. Due to pAime-128, the polymorphism of amino acid 291 sequences is easily reflected in its 3D structure, which is also important for studying pMHC-I 292 complexes. In addition, the amino acid composition of PBGs among other genera and members 293 of the bear family is not completely conservative, so there are some differences in A to F pockets. 294",
