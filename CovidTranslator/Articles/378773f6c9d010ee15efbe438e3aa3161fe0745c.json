Here we report that Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) mutant mice display natural resistance to acid-induced acute lung injury (ALI). We show that TLR4-TRIF-TRAF6 signaling is a key disease pathway that controls the severity of ALI. The oxidized phospholipid (OxPL) OxPAPC was identified to induce lung injury and cytokine production by lung macrophages via TLR4-TRIF. We observed OxPL production in the lungs of humans and animals infected with SARS, Anthrax, or H5N1. Pulmonary challenge with an inactivated H5N1 avian influenza virus rapidly induces ALI and OxPL formation in mice. Loss of TLR4 or TRIF expression protects mice from H5N1-induced ALI. Moreover, deletion of ncf1, which controls ROS production, improves the severity of H5N1-mediated ALI. Our data identify oxidative stress and innate immunity as key lung injury pathways that control the severity of ALI.",

ARDS was also the cause of death in millions of people during the Spanish Influenza pandemic (Tumpey et al., 2005) . Recently, H5N1 avian influenza virus infections have spread through the world primarily infecting poultry and migratory birds.

Moreover, many viruses including H5N1 mutate readily and produce resistant strains that are no longer controlled by vaccines or antiviral drugs. The pathology of ARDS in SARScoronavirus (Lew et al., 2003) and H5N1 avian influenza virus infections (Beigel et al., 2005; Peiris et al., 2004) is characterized by accumulation of inflammatory cells, edema formation, and a marked increase in cytokines. The same clinical syndrome of acute lung failure is observed in multiple other pathogenic conditions including sepsis, gastric acid aspiration, or pulmonary infections with Anthrax spores (Hudson et al., 1995; Guarner et al., 2003) . Similar ARDS symptoms can be observed in multiple species ranging from birds, rodents, tigers, and primates to humans. Given the common pathology, we wondered whether there might be a conserved injury pathway for ARDS.",

Acid aspiration in mice results in rapid impairment of lung function as determined by increased lung elastance, a measure of the change in pressure achieved per unit change in volume, representing the stiffness of the lungs, decreased blood oxygenation, and alveolar wall thickening, bleeding, inflammatory cell infiltration, and formation of hyaline membranes (Figures S1A-S1C available online). The severity of acid-induced ALI was comparable among various inbred mouse strains with one exception: C3H/HeJ mice exhibited reduced lung elastance.

To test whether this TLR4 mutation might be involved in ALI severity, we assessed acid-induced ALI in C3H/HeOuJ mice, a C3H-congenic mouse strain that expresses wild-type (WT) TLR4. The resistance to ALI of C3H/HeJ mice was lost in C3H/HeOuJ mice (Figures S1A-S1D). To confirm that TLR4 determines disease severity, we triggered acid-mediated ALI in tlr4 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice (Hoshino et al., 1999) . Genetic inactivation of tlr4 markedly attenuated ALI as determined by improved lung elastance ( Figure 1A ), reduced edema formation ( Figure 1B) , and ameliorated histological changes ( Figure 1C ). Bone marrow chimeras showed that the severity of ALI is controlled by TLR4 expression on hematopoietic cells ( Figures 1D-1F ). Lung pathology were not affected in tlr3 or tlr9 (Hemmi et al., 2000) mutant mice ( Figures S2A and S2B) . These data identify TLR4 as a susceptibility gene for ALI.",

Surprisingly, genetic deletion of myd88 (Adachi et al., 1998) had no apparent effect on the severity of ALI ( Figures S2C and S2D ). In contrast, trif \u00c0/\u00c0 mice exhibited markedly improved lung function (Figure 2A ), lung pathology ( Figure 2B ), and lung edema ( Figure S3A ). TRIF signals either through IKK-3 and activation of IRF3 or via TRAF6-mediated NF-kB activation . To dissect the TLR4-TRIF activation pathway, we conducted experiments using irf3 and traf6 knockout mice. Deletion of irf3 did not show a significant change in acid-mediated ALI ( Figures S2E and S2F ). We next generated myeloid cell-specific traf6 mutant mice using Lys-Cre-mediated deletion of a TRAF6 flox/flox allele (TRAF6 MC-KO ). Deletion of TRAF6 was confirmed in cultured bone marrowderived macrophages ( Figure 2C ). Inactivation of TRAF6 in TRAF6 MC-KO mice resulted in alleviation of ALI ( Figures 2D, 2E , and S3B). To determine whether mutations of TLR4, TRIF, or TRAF6 affect NF-kB activation, we performed in situ signaling experiments to detect nuclear accumulation of Ser276-phosphorylated NF-kBp65 indicative of NF-kB activation (Vermeulen et al., 2002) . Whereas acid aspiration triggered NF-kBp65 activation in WT and myd88 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice, much less nuclear NF-kBp65 translocation occurred in lungs from tlr4 \u00c0/\u00c0 , trif \u00c0/\u00c0 , or TRAF6 MC-KO mice ( Figure 2F ). NF-kB activation was largely restricted to macrophages. Taken together, our genetic results identify TLR4-TRIF-TRAF6-NF-kB as a key signaling pathway that links acid injury to the severity of ALI.",

The molecular basis of how such cytokine storms are mediated by local injury and whether such injury-released cytokines actually contribute to disease severity of ARDS are still unknown. To examine whether TLR4 signaling may be involved in local cytokine, we performed multiple cytokine arrays from normal lungs and lung tissue following acid aspiration. The cytokines IL-6, IL-1b, and KC (IL-8) were upregulated by acid treatment in WT mice, but we failed to observe upregulation of TNFa, IL-2, IFN-g, IL-1a, IL-12p40, IL-12p70, IL-17, RANTES, IL-9, Eotaxin, or MIP-1b ( Figure S4 and data not shown). IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, G-CSF, GM-CSF, MCP-1, and MIP-1a were below the detection limit of our assay. IL-10 negatively correlated with the severity of ALI ( Figure S4E ). In particular, IL-6 levels closely reflected the severity of ALI in resistant tlr4 \u00c0/\u00c0 , trif \u00c0/\u00c0 , and TRAF6 MC-KO mice and injury-prone mice myd88 \u00c0/\u00c0 and irf3 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice ( Figure 2G ). To test if IL-6 is indeed involved in the pathogenesis of ALI, we studied il-6 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice (Kopf et al., 1994) . In response to acid aspiration, il-6 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice exhibited significant improvement of lung function ( Figure 2H ), lung edema formation ( Figure S3C ), and decreased lung pathologies ( Figure 2I ). Although these data do not exclude the importance of other cytokines, our genetic results show that loss of IL-6 alleviates the severity of ALI ( Figure 2J ).",

To rule out the possibility of LPS contamination, we first treated mice with polymyxin B to neutralize LPS (Jacobs and Morrison, 1977) . Polymyxin B did not alter disease severity in acid-induced ALI ( Figure S5A ). Moreover, in line with previous data from our group (Imai et al., 2005) and others (Nagase et al., 2000) , instillation of LPS alone into lungs does not worsen lung function in our acute lung failure model ( Figure S5B ). We next stimulated alveolar macrophages from WT, tlr4 \u00c0/\u00c0 , myd88 \u00c0/\u00c0 , or trif \u00c0/\u00c0 mice with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid from normal mice (BAL control), BAL fluid from lungs of acid-treated WT mice (BAL acid), or LPS. In line with our genetic data, BAL fluid-induced IL-6 production was mediated via TLR4 and TRIF, but not MyD88 ( Figure 3A ). By contrast, LPS-induced IL-6 production in alveolar macrophages was dependent on TLR4, MyD88, and TRIF ( Figure 3A ). Thus, other TLR4-activating agents rather than LPS are generated during the course of ALI.",

We indeed observed induction of ROS in alveolar macrophages following in vivo acid challenge ( Figure 3B ). Acid treatment also triggered enhanced TLR4 surface expression ( Figure 3C ). To demonstrate the role of OxPLs in vivo we used the well-characterized mAb EO6 (Friedman et al., 2002) .

In situ immunohistochemistry confirmed the generation of EO6-detectable OxPLs in alveolar macrophages as well as inflammatory exudates lining the injured air spaces ( Figure 3D ). In addition, we observed formation of the lipid peroxidation breakdown product malondialdehyde detected by the specific mAb MDA2 (Palinski et al., 1996) (Figure S5D ), further confirming that lipid oxidation does occur in diseased lungs. These data show that acid aspiration triggers the oxidative stress machinery and the generation of OxPLs in lung.",

            "text": "The major source of PLs in the lung is surfactant, which forms a film at the alveolar air-water interface and reduces surface tension. Surfactant contains 80%-90% PLs including unsaturated phosphatidylcholine that can be oxidized (Rodriguez Capote et al., 2003; Veldhuizen et al., 1998) . In vitro-oxidized surfactant PLs contain EO6-detectable OxPLs ( Figure S6D ). Addition of purified synthetically oxidized surfactant PLs induced IL-6 produc-tion in a dose-dependent manner in WT peritoneal macrophages ( Figure 3F ). IL-6 production in response to surfactant OxPLs was decreased by the neutralizing mAb EO6 (data not shown) and dependent on TLR4 expression ( Figure 3F ). In line with previous results (Bailey et al., 2004) , in vivo administration of nonoxidized PLs induces slightly impaired lung function ( Figure 3G ). Intratracheal administration of OxPLs markedly worsened lung function in normal mice ( Figure 3G ). In a second experimental model, we removed endogenous surfactant via saline lavages, which strongly impairs lung function; we followed this with intratracheal replacement with nonoxidized or oxidized surfactant PLs. In this scenario, challenge with OxPLs resulted in much more severe impairment of lung function and all experimental animals died by 2 hr, whereas mice that received control, nonmodified surfactant PLs stabilized their lung function ( Figure S7A ). Lung function was comparable among WT and tlr4 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice following administration of nonoxidized surfactant PLs. Loss of TLR4 expression markedly alleviated the severe lung failure phenotype following OxPLs treatment ( Figure 3H ). Moreover, administration of OxPLs induced increased levels of IL-6 in the lungs of WT control but not in those of tlr4 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice ( Figure S7B ). These data indicate that synthetically oxidized surfactant PLs can trigger cytokine production in macrophages and, importantly, acute lung injury in vivo via TLR4.",

The mAb EO6 we used for the detection of OxPLs has been previously reported to specifically bind PC-containing OxPLs such as oxidized 1-palmitoyl-2-arachidonoyl-phosphatidylcholine (OxPAPC) ( Figure S7C ). We confirmed that the mAB EO6 indeed detects OxPAPC ( Figure S8A ). To directly test whether OxPAPC can trigger cytokine production via TLR4, we stimulated lung tissue macrophages with OxPAPC and nonoxidized PAPC. Compared to PAPC, OxPAPC induced higher IL-6 levels in WT macrophages, and these levels were attenuated by the neutralizing mAb EO6 ( Figure 4A ). OxPAPC-induced IL-6 production was decreased in tlr4 \u00c0/\u00c0 and trif \u00c0/\u00c0 lung macrophages, and this residual IL-6 production was not affected by the mAb EO6 ( Figure 4B ).

LPS-induced IL-6 production in lung macrophages was dependent on TLR4, TRIF, and MyD88 ( Figure 4B ). In addition, OxPAPC induced higher IL-6 production than nonoxidized PAPC in alveolar macrophages isolated by lung lavage (Figure S8B ). OxPAPC-induced IL-6 production was decreased in tlr4 \u00c0/\u00c0 alveolar macrophages ( Figure S8C ). Similar to lung macrophages, OxPAPC triggered IL-6 production in peritoneal macrophages dependent on TLR4 and TRIF but not MyD88 (Figure S8D) . Thus, OxPAPC can trigger IL-6 production in lung and peritoneal macrophages via TLR4-TRIF signaling. Importantly, intratracheal administration of OxPAPC induced marked deterioration of lung function in WT mice ( Figure 4C ). In vivo OxPAPC, but not PAPC, challenges triggered IkBa degradation indicative of an activated NF-kB pathway ( Figure 4D ). Moreover, lung function ( Figure 4E ) and IL-6 production ( Figure S8E ) were markedly alleviated in tlr4 \u00c0/\u00c0 and trif \u00c0/\u00c0 but not myd88 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice. These data indicate that OxPAPC can trigger ALI via TLR4 and TRIF.",

Inactivated influenza A virus (McKinney et al., 2003) or inactivated respiratory syncytial virus (Haeberle et al., 2002) can induce rapid activation of NF-kB and/or proinflammatory cytokine production in macrophages. The virulence of the 1918 Spanish influenza virus was largely determined by its hemaglutinin (HA), and the recombinant viruses expressing the 1918 viral HA induce high IL-6 production and severe ALI in vivo (Kobasa et al., 2004) . Based on these reports, we tested whether an inactivated H5N1 virus where HA activity is conserved might induce OxPL production and ALI in vivo via TLR4. Since H5N1 subtype influenza A viruses are more potent inducers of cytokines in macrophages than H1N1 subtype influenza (Cheung et al., 2002) , we used H1N1 as a control.",

Administration of inactivated H1N1 virus had only very mild effects on lung function and lung histology ( Figures 5A, 5B, and S9A ). In line with a previous study (van Riel et al., 2006) , we observed influenza A virus nuclear protein-positive cells in the lower respiratory tract (LRT) in mice treated with inactivated H5N1 virus ( Figure 5C ). By contrast, we only found very few virus nuclear protein-positive cells in the LRT of H1N1-treated mice ( Figure 5C ). Similar to acid treatment, we found higher production of ROS in alveolar macrophages isolated from mice treated with inactivated H5N1 avian influenza virus ( Figure 5D ). In addition, TLR4 surface expression was increased in alveolar macrophages from mice treated with inactivated H5N1 ( Figure 5E ). In vivo challenge of mice with H1N1 did not result in detectable ROS production or upregulation of TLR4 cell-surface expression (Figures 5D and  5E ). Moreover, we detected OxPLs in the BAL fluid of animals challenged with inactivated H5N1 ( Figure S9B ). Immunohistochemistry confirmed enhanced generation of EO6-detectable OxPLs at the sites of injury ( Figure S9C ). We extended the analysis of OxPLs to live H5N1 infections. Similar to inactivated H5N1 ( Figure 5C ), influenza virus A protein was detected in the LRT of mice infected with live H5N1 avian influenza virus ( Figure 5F ). Importantly, infection with live H5N1 avian influenza virus resulted in the formation of EO6-detectable OxPLs in mouse lung (Figure 5F ). Thus, challenge of mice with H5N1 avian influenza can trigger OxPLs and rapid onset ALI in vivo.",

Moreover, FACS staining showed that TLR4 surface expression was upregulated in PBMCs treated with inactivated H5N1 compared to H1N1 (Figures 7B and S10A ). Whereas TLR4 protein is distributed throughout the cytoplasm in human PBMCs under control conditions, challenge of PBMCs with inactivated H5N1 virus induced relocalization and cell membrane association of TLR4 ( Figure 7C ).

We therefore want to test whether such ROS generation is indeed involved in disease pathogenesis of H5N1 influenza virus-mediated ALI. To address this, we analyzed lung injury in WT and ncf1 (neutrophil cytosolic factor 1) mutant mice (Hultqvist et al., 2004) . Ncf1 is a key component of the NADPH oxidase complex required for oxidative burst and ROS formation (Hultqvist et al., 2004) . This ncf1 mutation affects splicing leading to a near absence of Ncf1 protein (Huang et al., 2000) . Interestingly, the ncf1 mutant mice treated with inactivated H5N1 virus showed significantly improved lung elastance ( Figure 7D ), pulmonary edema formation (Figure S10B), and alleviated lung pathologies ( Figure 7E ) compared with control mice on the same genetic background. Importantly, in H5N1-challenged ncf1 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice we failed to detect oxidized PL formation (Figure 7E) . Thus, genetic impairment of ROS production results in reduced formation of OxPLs and significantly improved lung functions in response to H5N1 challenge.",

In all SARS-infected human cases tested, we observed marked production of OxPLs in the inflammatory exudates lining the injured air spaces, pneumocytes, as well as alveolar macrophages ( Figure 7F and data not shown). To extend these findings to additional species and pathogens, we analyzed lung samples from animals infected with potential bioterrorism agents. We observed formation of OxPLs in Anthrax-infected Rhesus monkeys, Anthrax-infected rabbits, Monkey Pox-infected Cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis), as well as Yersinia pestis-infected Cynomolgus monkeys that developed lung plague ( Figure 7G ). By contrast, we could not detect elevated OxPLs in Smallpox or Marburg virus-infected Cynomolgus monkeys, nor in monkeys infected with Western Equine Encephalitis (WEE) or Eastern Equine Encephalitis (EEE) viruses, diseases that did not cause severe lung injury (data not shown). Thus, in multiple species, infections with various lethal lung pathogens such as H5N1 avian influenza virus, SARS-coronavirus, Anthrax, Y. pestis, or Monkey Pox virus can trigger formation of OxPLs in the lung. These results should be extended to additional pathogens and species.",

In the classical pathway, MyD88 recruits IL-1R-associated kinase (IRAK) and TRAF6 leading to activation of IKKa/b/g complexes. TRIF signals through IKK-3 leading to activation of IRF3 and the expression of IFN-inducible genes. It has been shown that TRAF6 binds to TRIF though TRAF6-binding motifs in the N-terminal portion of TRIF and is involved in TRIF-mediated activation of NF-kB in vitro . Importantly, our study shows that innate immune signaling via TLR4-TRIF-TRAF6 is a key genetic pathway that determines the susceptibility to acute lung failure in vivo. Moreover, our bone marrow transplantation experiments and our LysCre TFAF6 mutant mice show that this pathway operates in myeloid cells, in particular lung macrophages. Since macrophages can utilize both TRIF-and MyD88-dependent pathways for cytokine induction, our data might provide an opportunity to minimize ALI via TRIF inhibition while not affecting MyD88-dependent innate immune functions.",

However, this connection has been controversial (Bochkov et al., 2002) . We therefore used a genetic approach to examine whether TLR4 expression is indeed required for OxPL-induced cytokine production in macrophages in vitro or OxPL-induced ALI in vivo. Our genetic data show that OxPL-mediated cytokine release and OxPL-induced ALI depend on TLR4 expression. Thus, OxPLs can either directly or indirectly activate the TLR4 signaling cascade during the course of lung injury. Consistent with previous reports (Powers et al., 2006; Kurt-Jones et al., 2000) , we also found that chemical injury and inactivated H5N1 virus upregulate TLR4 surface expression in macrophages. Thus, local lung injury not only triggers activation of the oxidative stress machinery but also induces upregulation of TLR4 involved in the OxPL-induced acute lung injury response.",

On the other hand, anti-inflammatory properties of Ox-PAPC have been reported in LPS-induced sepsis or ALI, which may be explained by direct antagonism of LPS recognition (Bochkov et al., 2002; Nonas et al., 2006) . Besides OxPAPC, other OxPLs might also trigger ALI.

Of note, gene expression analysis of mice infected with recombinant viruses expressing the 1918 viral HA revealed a high upregulation of ROS-related genes (Kash et al., 2004) . We therefore tested H5N1-induced lung injury in ncf1 mutant mice. Ncf1 encodes one of the activating proteins in the phagocytic NADPH oxidase complex. Importantly, this genetic defect in ROS production resulted in a significantly reduced lung injury in response to challenge with our inactivated H5N1 virus. Moreover, in H5N1-challenged ncf1 mutant mice we failed to observe EO6-detectable oxidized PLs confirming that Ncf1-regulated oxidative burst is involved in the formation of OxPLs.
