While it is assumed that most of these patients will be treated eventually, the hospital is unable to increase program services to make up the backlog, resulting in longer waiting lists. Although some of these patients may be treated elsewhere and some may be treated in the following fiscal year, this still represents lost hospital revenue this fiscal year.

Salaries for absent staff were included in the analysis because, although they were paid, no patient care was provided. This care may be provided eventually, in which case the hospital will incur a future cost. This assumption seems reasonable given that many of the services provided by the University Health Network are specialized, hence patients cannot easily seek care elsewhere. Furthermore, all hospitals in the Toronto area suffered the same service restrictions during the SARS outbreak, making it difficult for Toronto patients to be treated at other area hospitals. Table I provides an itemized listing of lost revenue, excess service, material, supplies, and renovation costs, labour costs, as well as savings incurred from decreased patient volume as a result of the first SARS outbreak.

Although there were some savings due to decreased clinical activity during the outbreak, these savings were eclipsed by increased expenses and lost revenue. This negative financial impact is particularly notable because it occurred during a time when the hospital was servicing only 10% of its predicted patient volume. Despite this dramatic reduction in service, our findings show that in fact, the cost of staffing increased as existing staff continued to receive salaries even if they were prohibited from coming to work, some existing staff received overtime pay, while additional staff were hired to perform new tasks. In addition, because isolation supplies are not used for every patient during normal operation, the cost of supplies increased dramatically when they were used for every patient encounter, even though there were far fewer patients in the hospital.",

For example, some employees worked overtime hours and were given days off in lieu of overtime pay. Although likely a significant cost, the long-term impact of limiting medical care to our patient population during the outbreak was beyond the scope of the study. Although we have assumed that revenue lost from volume-funded programs is lost forever, this implies that affected patients will never obtain treatment at our hospital for their condition. We believe this to be a largely valid assumption as some of these patients will die prior to receiving care, while others may recover. Some however will join waiting lists and receive care later on. Lost revenue could be recuperated if hospitals were to become more efficient in treating patients. There is evidence, however, that this has not occurred, as waiting lists in Ontario increased substantially as a result of the outbreak. 8 As is the case with many outbreaks, we are unable to comment on which control strategies were the most effective, as all were implemented at once. There is, however, growing evidence that some of the strategies (i.e., airborne control measures) may have played a less-important role in containing this outbreak. 7, 9 Nevertheless, any future respiratory infectious disease outbreak caused by SARS or an unknown respiratory pathogen, will likely require similar control measures.",
