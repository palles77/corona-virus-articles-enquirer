            "text": "The common cold is the most common infectious disease affecting humans. [1] The common cold is a viral upper respiratory tract infection with typical symptoms that include: nasal congestion, rhinorrhoea, sneezing, sore throat, and cough. [2] Many viruses cause the common cold but Human Rhinoviruses (HRVs) are the most frequent pathogen. [3] On average, adults have two to four colds per year. [2] The mean duration of symptoms of the common cold is reported to be between seven and ten days and it is usually a self-limiting disease. [2] However, the common cold can cause significant morbidity and has a substantial economic impact on society. In the USA alone, non-influenza viral respiratory tract infections cause an estimated 20 million lost workdays, 110 million physician visits, and 6 million emergency department visits annually, [4] producing an economic burden of $40 billion each year. [4] Furthermore, HRV infection poses particular risks to those with other comorbidities such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), where they are a major cause of disease exacerbations. [5, 6] No effective treatment has been identified for the common cold and current treatments are mainly symptomatic. There are many cold remedies marketed and, for example, in the USA an estimated $2.9 billion are spent on over-the-counter medications for the common cold annually. [4] Amongst the treatment used are: zinc, vitamin C, nasal decongestants, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), echinacea, antihistamines, antibiotics and heated, humidified air. The evidence for the effectiveness of many of these is inconclusive or, at most, demonstrates limited benefit for symptom reduction. [3] Rhinothermy HRVs cause up to two thirds of colds, and importantly for the hypothesis tested in this research, have temperature-dependent replication. [7] The antiviral effect of temperature on HRVs has been investigated in vitro. [8] [9] [10] [11] Replication of most HRV strains is optimal between 33 and 35\u00b0C, [7] which is the normal physiological temperature of the upper airways. [7] Studies report that raising the nasal mucosal temperature may inhibit viral replication [8] and this may be a treatment strategy to attenuate the severity and duration of common cold symptoms. Forstall and colleagues report that the greatest inhibition of HRV occurs when exposed to a temperature of 43\u00b0C for at least one hour [7] F o r p e e r r e v i e w o n l y and Conti and colleagues report that HRV replication is suppressed when exposed to a temperature of 45\u00b0C for 20 minutes. [9] Rhinothermy is the delivery of heated, humidified air to the upper airways via the nasal passages.",

[8, [13] [14] [15] These delivery systems may be inefficient and inconsistently deliver humidified air to the upper airways at the desired temperatures. A recent Cochrane systematic review of six rhinothermy studies in which participants with the common cold were treated with heated, humidified air did not show any harms or benefits, but advised cautious interpretation of the evidence, concluding that its quality was low grade. [1] The review recommended that further double-blind randomised controlled trials are needed, which provide definitive diagnosis derived from viral cultures and use uniform symptom scores. [1] It is evident that future trials should use standardised treatment modalities which effectively and consistently raise the temperature of the upper airways for the duration of treatment.",

[1] The common cold is a viral upper respiratory tract infection with typical symptoms that include: nasal congestion, rhinorrhoea, sneezing, sore throat, and cough. [2] Many viruses cause the common cold but Human Rhinoviruses (HRVs) are the most frequent pathogen. [3] On average, adults have two to four colds per year. [2] The mean duration of symptoms of the common cold is reported to be between seven and ten days and it is usually a self-limiting disease. [2] However, the common cold can cause significant morbidity and has a substantial economic impact on society. In the USA alone, non-influenza viral respiratory tract infections cause an estimated 20 million lost workdays, 110 million physician visits, and 6 million emergency department visits annually, [4] producing an economic burden of $40 billion each year. [4] Furthermore, HRV infection poses particular risks to those with other comorbidities such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), where they are a major cause of disease exacerbations. [5, 6] No effective treatment has been identified for the common cold and current treatments are mainly symptomatic. There are many cold remedies marketed and, for example, in the USA an estimated $2.9 billion are spent on over-the-counter medications for the common cold annually. [4] Amongst the treatment used are: zinc, vitamin C, nasal decongestants, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), echinacea, antihistamines, antibiotics and heated, humidified air. The evidence for the effectiveness of many of these is inconclusive or, at most, demonstrates limited benefit for symptom reduction. [3] Rhinothermy HRVs cause up to two thirds of colds, and importantly for the hypothesis tested in this research, have temperature-dependent replication. [7] The antiviral effect of temperature on HRVs has been investigated in vitro. [8] [9] [10] [11] Replication of most HRV strains is optimal between 33 and 35\u00b0C, [7] which is the normal physiological temperature of the upper airways. [7] Studies report that raising the nasal mucosal temperature may inhibit viral replication [8] and this may be a treatment strategy to attenuate the severity and duration of common cold symptoms. Forstall and colleagues report that the greatest inhibition of HRV occurs when exposed to a temperature of 43\u00b0C for at least one hour [7] and Conti and colleagues report that HRV replication is suppressed when exposed to a temperature of 45\u00b0C for 20 minutes. [9] Rhinothermy is the delivery of heated, humidified air to the upper airways via the nasal passages.",

[8, [13] [14] [15] These delivery systems may be inefficient and inconsistently deliver humidified air to the upper airways at the desired temperatures. A recent Cochrane systematic review of six rhinothermy studies in which participants with the common cold were treated with heated, humidified air did not show any harms or benefits, but advised cautious interpretation of the evidence, concluding that its quality was low grade. [1] The review recommended that further double-blind randomised controlled trials are needed, which provide definitive diagnosis derived from viral cultures and use uniform symptom scores. [1] It is evident that future trials should use standardised treatment modalities which effectively and consistently raise the temperature of the upper airways for the duration of treatment. A recent feasibility study recruited 30 participants with symptoms of the common cold into a randomised controlled trial (RCT) of five days of rNHF therapy or Vitamin C with the main patient reported outcome measure, the Modified Jackson Score. [17] The rNHF therapy delivered 100% humidified air at 35L/min and 41\u00b0C for two hours daily. Compared to Vitamin C, rNHF treatment caused a clinically significant five unit reduction in the Modified Jackson Score.",

We make sure that you are happy for your usual doctor to be advised that you are enrolled in the cold or flu study if you DO end up in one of them. 4. We ask you to fill in two questionnaires a. One about flu symptoms b. One about common cold symptoms 5. Depending on the answers to the two symptom questionnaires, you may be asked to provide us with a sample from the back of your nose, which we will take with a swab through one nostril. This sample will be tested for the presence or absence of the flu virus. 6. If you have a negative test for the flu from your nose swab, and your cold symptom score meets the entry criteria, you will be advised that you are eligible for the cold study. a. You will receive a separate informed consent form for the cold study that will outline the process specifically for that study 7. If you have a positive test for the flu from your nose swab, and your flu symptom questionnaire meets the entry criteria, you will be advised that you are eligible for the flu study. a. Please note, female participants who reach this point will be asked to undertake a urinary pregnancy test, as pregnant females will be excluded from the flu study. b. All eligible participants will receive a separate informed consent form for the flu study that will outline the process specifically for that study. 8. There may be some people who have the wrong combination of cold or flu symptoms and flu test results, and will not be suitable for either study. If you are not suitable, you will be reimbursed for your time and travel. 9. If you are enrolled in either study, we will ask that for the first five days of the study, while you are taking one of the randomised treatments, you refrain from leaving the greater Wellington region (not beyond Upper Hut or Paraparaumu). If you have existing travel plans that require you to leave the greater Wellington region, you will be advised that you are not eligible for the study.",

This impact includes time off of work, which in the US alone has been estimated to cost the economy $25 billion. Finding different ways of reducing the impact of the common cold, which is usually caused by a virus (there are many, the Human Rhinovirus being the most common), by inhaling steam has become a focus of research. It is thought that breathing in steam through the nose may kill the virus as well as reduce the symptoms and the number of days that people remain unwell.
