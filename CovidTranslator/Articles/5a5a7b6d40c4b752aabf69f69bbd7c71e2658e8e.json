In 2017 China reported no 24 indigenous malaria cases for the first time since malaria became a notifiable disease in 1956 2, 3 . The 25 country has experienced a major decline in the burden of malaria, from an annual incidence of 24 26 million cases (2961 cases per 100,000) in 1970 4 . This reduction has been attributed to a combination 27 of socioeconomic improvements and the scale-up of interventions to control malaria 5 . In 2010, China 28 set out an ambitious plan for the national elimination of malaria by 2020 (the National Malaria 29 Elimination Programme, NMEP). Elements of the plan included improved surveillance, timely 30 response, more effective and sensitive risk assessment tools and improved diagnostics 6 . A key policy 31 change implemented in 2010 as part of the NMEP was the introduction of the 1-3-7 system: aiming 32 for case reporting in one day, which is then investigated within three days, with a focused 33 investigation and action taken in under seven days 7 . 34",

We estimate a decline in the probability of a reproduction number for a P. vivax 96 case being above zero over this period ( Figure 3A and 3B), with the central parts of the province 97 being the first to reach lower risks of non-zero . The border area neighbouring Myanmar, where 98 most cases were observed, had the lowest amount of uncertainty in the estimates. P. falciparum 99 shows a decline in risk of > 0 across the province, with the more isolated areas in the north of the 100 province showing both the highest predicted risk but also the most uncertainty, due to a lack of 101 cases observed there (Supplementary Figure 6) . By 2016 all areas have reached a low risk, although 102 there is more uncertainty in these estimates compared to P. vivax, almost certainly due to the 103 smaller sample size. 104 .

Nevertheless, China's elimination 214 strategy and investment in surveillance provides a useful roadmap for other countries planning for 215 malaria elimination by illustrating how coordinated and timely surveillance and response can be 216 implemented, as well as sustained investment in surveillance, and region-and 2016 in Yunnan Province (N =4390) were obtained from the Chinese Centre for 223 Disease Control (CCDC). For each case, our data included date of symptom onset, GPS coordinates of 224 symptom onset address, health facility address, travel history, and in some cases, the GPS 225 coordinates of presumed location of infection. 226Of these cases, the majority were P. vivax (N = 3469, of which 2858 were classified as imported). Of 227 all recorded P. falciparum cases (N=791), 91% (N=720) were imported. Small numbers of P. malariae 228 (N=8) and P. ovale (N=1) were excluded from our analysis. Cases defined as \"untyped\" (N=67) were 229 also excluded. A small number (N=27) of cases classified as mixed infection were included in the 230 separate analyses of each species. A full breakdown of the cases and species composition across 231China and in Yunnan province between 2011 and 2016 is included in Supplementary Tables 1-4. 232Surveillance system in China233 China has a sophisticated malaria surveillance system, described in detail elsewhere 7,15,16,26,27 and in 234 Supplementary Note 1. Briefly, surveillance is carried out in both a passive and reactive manner, 235 organised and administered at the national, provincial and county level. The centralised China 236 Information System for Disease Control and Prevention (CISDCP) receives daily updates on case 237 reports from health facilities. The \"1-3-7\" strategy introduced in 2010 aiming for case reporting 238 within one day of detection, initial investigation within three days and focused investigation and 239 action taken in under seven days has increasingly been achieved -the proportion of cases 240 investigated within three days increased from roughly 55% in 2011 to almost 100% by 2013. 241 However, the programme took longer to achieve the seven day focal point investigation goals, with 242 just over 50% of foci investigated and treated within seven days by the end of 2013 7 . Nevertheless, 243 by 2015, adherence to the 1-3-7 strategy improved and this figure increased to an estimated 96% 27 . 244 interval is defined as the time between a given case showing symptoms and the 246 subsequent cases they infect showing symptoms 28 . For a given individual at time , showing 247 symptoms before individual at time , the serial interval distribution specifies the normalised 248 likelihood or probability density of case infecting case based on the time between symptom 249 onsets, \u2212 . The serial interval summarises several distributions including the distribution of a) 250 the times between symptom onset and infectiousness onset, b) the time for humans to transmit 251 malaria parasites to mosquito vectors, c) the period of mosquito infectiousness, and d) the human 252 incubation period. 253 Taking a similar approach to our previously developed work 20 , we defined a prior distribution of 254 possible serial interval distributions for malaria. The serial interval distribution of treated, 255 symptomatic P. falciparum malaria, previously characterised using empirical and model based 256 evidence 29,30 was adapted to inform the prior distribution for the relationship between time and 257 likelihood of transmission between cases in China. We analysed P. vivax cases and P. falciparum 258 cases separately. The prior distribution was defined to be flexible enough to reflect both the 259 biology of P. vivax and P. falciparum as well as the dominant vector species in Yunnan (recent 260 surveys in Yunnan province have found Anopheles sinensis to be the dominant vector species in mid-261 elevation areas and rice paddies and Anopheles minimus s.l. the dominant species in low elevation 262 areas 13,31 ) and to allow for possible variation in transmission dynamics, for example due to untyped 263 infections or delays in seeking treatment. In addition, there is a possibility of a small number of 264 asymptomatic or undetected and therefore untreated infections contributing to ongoing 265 transmission, which will typically have a longer serial interval. We use a shifted Rayleigh distribution 266 to describe the serial interval of both species, which can be varied by changing two parameters: 267 and . The parameter governs the overall shape of the distribution, and is the shifting parameter 268 accounting for the incubation period between receiving an infectious bite and the onset of 269 symptoms (Figure 1A). The shifting parameter was fixed at 15 days to account for the extrinsic 270 within the mosquito and the minimum time between infection and suitable 271 numbers of gametocytes in the blood to lead to symptom onset 32 . The prior for the parameter 272 determining the shape of the distribution was given a Normal distribution with mean 0.003 and 273 standard deviation 0.1 (illustrated in figure 5), giving an expected time between symptom onset of 274 one case and symptom onset of the case it infects of 36 days, with the parameter value in the 2.5 275 percentile of prior having an expected serial interval of 21 days and the equivalent parameter from 276 the 97.5 percentile having an expected serial interval of 60 days. By comparison the expected 277 values for treated P. falciparum from existing literature range between 33 and 49.1 days (95%CI = 278 33-69) 29,30 . Depending on how much uncertainty there is in the serial interval of malaria, the prior 279 for \u03b1, the shaping parameter for the SI of malaria, may be varied. We explored the effects of 280 different priors on the likelihood and posterior estimates. We used the same mean value for \u03b1 281 (0.003) but set the \u03b1 prior to standard deviation between 1 and 0.01. The results of considering 282 different priors for \u03b1, the parameter shaping SI distribution on estimated values over time cases were classified correctly from case investigation as imported or locally-acquired 286 based on recent travel history. Following this assumption, locally-acquired cases could have both 287 infected others and been infected themselves. However imported cases could only infect others, as 288 we assume their infection was acquired outside of the country. Given the evidence 7,15,27 2014; Hu et 289 al., 2016; Zhou et al., 2015of strong adherence to the 1-3-7 policy for reporting and response to case 290 detection, and no evidence of relapse within the dataset (as each patient is given a unique 291 identifier), we assume that an individual can only be infected once by a case that has the underlying pathways of transmission and likelihood of cases being linked by 296 infection, we adapt and extend the NetRate algorithm 22 . Our adapted model introduces the ability to 297 model serial interval functions, account for imported vs local infections and provides provision for 298 missing or unobserved sources of infection (called epsilon edges 20,33 ). We also extended the NetRate 299 algorithm from a frequentist to a Bayesian framework to incorporate prior knowledge about the 300 serial interval of malaria. 301 Consider a set of infections/nodes \u2208 ( , \u2026 , ) with associated times = { , \u2026 } \u2208 \u211d and 302 binary yes/no importation status = { , . . , } \u2208 {1,0} .The serial interval distribution of malaria, 303 defining the probability individual infected individual at times > Routledge et al., 2018). For our analysis we fix = 15 days. If we assume that infections 306 are conditionally independent given the parents of infected nodes then the likelihood of a is a parameter matrix. Computing the likelihood of a given transmission chain thus 310 involves computing the conditional likelihood of the infection time of each infection ( ) given all 311other infections ( , \u2026 , \\ ). If we make the assumption that a node gets infected once the probability that infection is not infected by infection by time then we can simplify conditional likelihood the first term computes the probability the infected and the second 318 term computes the probability that was not infected by any other previous infections excluding . 319This likelihood therefore accounts for competing infectors and finds the infector most likely to have 320 infected .
