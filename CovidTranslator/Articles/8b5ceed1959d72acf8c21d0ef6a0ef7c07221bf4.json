These cells can be grown in large numbers and the percentage of defined macrophages increased until day l0 when 100% of the cells represented macrophages. MHV3 replicated within these cells to high titers and caused the formation of multi-nucleated giant cells. This effect was seen with very low virus inocula in BM macrophages of C57BL/6 mice that are highly susceptible to in vivo infection with MHV3 whereas macrophages from resistant A/J mice did not show a cytopathic effect at these virus doses. 1000-fold higher virus doses, however, caused the cytopathic effect in macrophages of both C57BL/6 and A/J mice.",

The appearance of this CPE closely parallels viral replication and thus provides a useful tool for in vitro studies of virus macrophage interactions [3, 4] . However, mouse PEC represent a heterogenous cell population [5] Key words: bone marrow macrophages mouse hepatitis virus type 3 -genetics of resistance and divergent data have been reported on genetic differences between the capacity of PEC from different inbred mouse strains [6 8] . We have therefore used in vitro cultivated bone marrow (BM) macrophages for replication and titration of MHV3. These can be readily grown in large numbers and with a high degree of purity. MHV3 replicated to high titers in these cultures. The purpose of this report is two-fold: (a) we wish to report the usefulness of this tissue culture system for the replication of MHV3, and (b) we have reexamined the differences of in vitro MHV3 replication in macrophages derived from different inbred mouse strains.",
