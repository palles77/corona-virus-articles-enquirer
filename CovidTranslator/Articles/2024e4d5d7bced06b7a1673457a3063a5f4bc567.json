            "text": "The outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease, COVID-19, caused by the new coronavirus 2019-nCoV that is now officially designated as severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, represents a pandemic threat to global public health. 1, 2 Although the epicenter of the COVID-19 outbreak in December of 2019 was located in Wuhan, China, this disease has spread to more than 100 countries ( Figure 1 ) with over 100 000 confirmed cases and over 3,800 confirmed deaths worldwide ( Figure 2 ) as of March 9, 2020 . 3 In addition, millions of people's lives have been affected as a result of mandatory isolations/ quarantines. The ripple effect of the COVID-19 outbreak could potentially bring major challenges to worldwide health systems and have far-reaching consequences on the global economy if the spread of the virus is not effectively controlled. 1, 2, 4 Coronaviruses (CoVs) are relatively large viruses containing a single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome encapsulated within a membrane envelope. The viral membrane is studded with glycoprotein spikes that give coronaviruses their crownlike appearance (Figure 3 ). While coronaviruses infect both humans and animals, certain types of animals such as bats that host the largest variety of coronaviruses appear to be immune to coronavirus-induced illness. 5 There are four classes of coronaviruses designated as alpha, beta, gamma, and delta. The betacoronavirus class includes severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) virus (MERS-CoV), and the COVID-19 causative agent SARS-CoV-2. Similar to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 attacks the lower respiratory system to cause viral pneumonia, but it may also affect the gastrointestinal system, heart, kidney, liver, and central nervous system leading to multiple organ failure. 6, 7 Current information indicates that SARS-CoV-2 is more transmissible/contagious than SARS-CoV. 8 Since the outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease COVID-19, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, this disease has spread rapidly around the globe. Considering the potential threat of a pandemic, scientists and physicians have been racing to understand this new virus and the pathophysiology of this disease to uncover possible treatment regimens and discover effective therapeutic agents and vaccines. To support the current research and development, CAS has produced a special report to provide an overview of published scientific information with an emphasis on patents in the CAS content collection. It highlights antiviral strategies involving small molecules and biologics targeting complex molecular interactions involved in coronavirus infection and replication. The drug-repurposing effort documented herein focuses primarily on agents known to be effective against other RNA viruses including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. The patent analysis of coronavirusrelated biologics includes therapeutic antibodies, cytokines, and nucleic acid-based therapies targeting virus gene expression as well as various types of vaccines. More than 500 patents disclose methodologies of these four biologics with the potential for treating and preventing coronavirus infections, which may be applicable to COVID-19. The information included in this report provides a strong intellectual groundwork for the ongoing development of therapeutic agents and vaccines.",

This S protein mediates host cell invasion by both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 via binding to a receptor protein called angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) located on the surface membrane of host cells. 9\u221211 A recent study also revealed that this invasion process requires S protein priming which is facilitated by the host cellproduced serine protease TMPRSS211. In addition, the viral genome also encodes several nonstructural proteins including RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), coronavirus main protease (3CLpro), and papain-like protease (PLpro). 12, 13 Upon entrance to the host cells, the viral genome is released as a single-stranded positive RNA. Subsequently, it is translated into viral polyproteins using host cell protein translation machinery, which are then cleaved into effector proteins by viral proteinases 3CLpro and PLpro. 12, 13 PLpro also behaves as a deubiquitinase that may deubiquinate certain host cell proteins, including interferon factor 3 and NF-\u03baB, resulting in immune suppression. 13, 14 RdRp synthesizes a full-length negative-strand RNA template to be used by RdRp to make more viral genomic RNA.",

Scientists and physicians worldwide have been conducting a major campaign to understand this new emergent disease and its epidemiology in an effort to uncover possible treatment regimens, discover effective therapeutic agents, and develop vaccines. Figure 4 shows the total number of journal articles related to COVID-19 or SARS-CoV-2 published each week from the last week of 2019 through the week of February 24, 2020. Over 500 journal articles were published electronically or in print during this period, and the number of published articles has increased each week since the week of January 13, 2020. Although a large portion of these articles are about clinical manifestations and treatment options, an increasing number of studies are focused on elucidation of virus structure, virus transmission mechanisms/dynamics, as well as identification of antiviral agents and accurate diagnostics for virus detection. These trends reflect immense interest and desire from the scientific community, including both academic and industrial organizations as well as clinicians, to identify new methods to halt the progression of this epidemic disease and to prevent infection and transmission in the future.",

Viral proteins responsible for SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells and replication are structurally similar to those associated with SARS-CoV. Thus, research and development on SARS and MERS may offer insights that would be beneficial to the development of therapeutic and preventive agents for COVID-19. This report identified pertinent data from patents related to these two coronaviruses. Figure 5 shows the distribution of patents in the CAS content collection related to SARS (A) and MERS (B). The number of patents related to SARS is almost 12 times the number related to MERS, probably because the SARS outbreak occurred about 10 years before the MERS outbreak. Among SARS patents, about 80% are related to the development of therapeutics, 35% are related to vaccines, and 28% are related to diagnostic agents or methods. Because an individual patent may cover any two or more areas, the sum of percentage values is greater than 100%. A similar distribution pattern was also observed for patents related to MERS. Thus, for both diseases, more patents have been devoted to the development of therapeutic agents as opposed to diagnostic methods and vaccines.",

            "text": "Identification of targets is important for identifying drugs with high target specificity and/or uncovering existing drugs that could be repurposed to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection. Table 2 lists potential targets, their roles in viral infection, and representative existing drugs or drug candidates that reportedly act on the corresponding targets in similar viruses and thus are to be assessed for their effects on SARS-CoV-2 infection. 3CLpro and PLpro are two viral proteases responsible for the cleavage of viral peptides into functional units for virus replication and packaging within the host cells. Thus, drugs that target these proteases in other viruses such as HIV drugs, lopinavir and ritonavir, have been explored. 19 RdRp is the RNA polymerase responsible for viral RNA synthesis that may be blocked by existing antiviral drugs or drug candidates, such as remdesivir. 19 Conceivably, the interaction of viral S protein with its receptor ACE2 on host cells, and subsequent viral endocytosis into the cells, may also be a viable drug target. For example, the broadspectrum antiviral drug Arbidol, which functions as a virus-host cell fusion inhibitor to prevent viral entry into host cells against influenza virus, 20 has entered into a clinical trial for treatment of SARS-CoV-2. 21, 22 The protease TMPRSS2 produced by the host cells plays an important role in proteolytic processing of S protein priming to the receptor ACE2 binding in human cells. 11 It has been shown that camostat mesylate, a clinically approved TMPRSS2 inhibitor, was able to block SARS-CoV-2 entry to human cells, indicating its potential as a drug for COVID-19. 11 ACE2 involvement with coronavirus infection is of further interest since ACE2 is a potent negative regulator restraining overactivation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) that may be involved in elicitation of inflammatory lung disease in addition to its well-known role in regulation of blood pressure and balance of body fluid and electrolytes. 23, 24 It catalyzes degradation of angiotensin II to angiotensin (1\u22127). The balance between angiotensin II and angiotensin (1\u22127) is critical since angiotensin II binds to angiotensin AT1 receptor to cause vasoconstriction, whereas angiotensin (1\u22127) elicits vasodilation mediated by AT2. 25\u221227 Although the notion that ACE2 mediates coronavirus invasion is largely accepted, it remains unclear how the levels or activities of ACE2, AT1 receptors, and AT2 receptors are altered in coronavirus-induced diseases due to the limited number of studies. 23, 24 Therefore, it is yet to be determined whether some drugs or compounds that target any of these proteins (e.g., L-163491 as a partial antagonist of AT1 receptor and partial agonist of AT2 receptor) may alleviate coronavirusinduced lung injury. 28 Patents and Potential Drug Candidates Related to Key Protein Targets. The CAS content collection contains patents related to coronavirus key proteins listed above. Table 3 lists the number of patents related to each protein target and associated therapeutic compounds with a CAS Registry Number (CAS RN) reported in these patents. CAS data show that targets 3CLpro and RdRp attracted more attention than other targets, and more compounds with therapeutic potential were identified for these targets, probably due to the work done for SARS-CoV which also contains 3CLpro and RdRp.",

The new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 related to SARS and MERS viruses is causing serious and ongoing epidemiological problems around the world. Since there is limited clinical and basic research information at this time, treatment options for COVID-19 currently comprise investigational drugs and management of symptoms. As biologics have the potential to broaden the spectrum of the treatment options for coronavirusinduced diseases, leveraging prior knowledge and practices used to address the SARS and MERS outbreaks provides a practical strategy for developing new target-specific therapeutic agents for SARS-CoV-2. To this end, an analysis of biologics from patents contained in the CAS content collection was performed. The patent analysis included information related to therapeutic antibodies, cytokines, interfering and other therapeutic RNAs, and vaccines for potential treatment and/or prevention of SARS-related diseases from patents published from 2003 to the present. Figure 6 shows more than 500 patents that disclose the use of these four biologics classes to treat and prevent SARS and MERS. Of these patents, vaccine development was the largest class (363), followed by therapeutic antibodies (99), interfering RNAs (35) , and cytokines (22) . Given the indispensable role of vaccines in viral disease prevention, detailed analysis of vaccines will be presented in a later section.",

RNA interference (RNAi) is a biological process wherein small complementary RNA duplexes target and neutralize specific mRNA molecules, resulting in inhibition of gene expression or genetic translation. Interfering RNAs include microRNAs and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) that are generally about 21\u221225 nucleotides in length. Short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) are artificial synthetic RNA molecules designed to fold into a tight hairpin conformation that allows them to silence their target genes, and can serve as precursors of siRNAs. The expression of shRNAs in cells is typically accomplished by their delivery via plasmids or viral or bacterial vectors. 48 Although microRNAs are noncoding and naturally found in plants, animals, and some viruses, synthetic versions are currently being used to silence a variety of genes. 49 The ability to chemically synthesize modified analogues of microRNAs as well as siRNAs, which are capable of altering disease-related gene expression or inhibiting pathogen gene expression, has created a host of new therapeutic options. 50 In contrast to the microRNAs and siRNAs, antisense RNAs are single-stranded RNAs which are naturally occurring or synthetic and usually around 19\u221223 nucleotides in length with a sequence complementary to that of a protein coding mRNA, allowing it to hybridize and block protein translation. 48 Since the discovery of RNAi in the late 1990s, it has become a well-known method for silencing/suppressing target genes associated with virulence and pathogenesis. Thirty-five patents in the CAS content collection disclose the use of RNAi in treating SARS, with 28 patents using siRNA molecules, three patents using antisense oligonucleotides, two patents using RNA aptamers, one patent using a ribozyme, and one patent using a microRNA inhibitor.

Patent application WO2005081716 discloses compositions and methods for inducing/enhancing immune responses, particularly antigen-specific CD8+ T cellmediated responses, against antigens of the SARS coronavirus. An enhancement of the immune response involving particularly cytotoxic T cell immune responses is induced in vivo by chimeric nucleic acids that encode an endoplasmic reticulum chaperone polypeptide (e.g., calreticulin) linked to at least one antigenic polypeptide or peptide from SARS-CoV. Using gene gun delivery of DNA-coated gold particles, vaccination of mice against a calreticulin\u2212nucleocapsid fusion protein resulted in potent nucleocapsid-specific humoral and T cell-mediated immune responses.

Given the costly and arduous process involved with clinical drug development, the outbreak of COVID-19 further highlights the value of developing relatively broad-spectrum antiviral drugs and the importance of applying innovative approaches such as artificial intelligence to facilitate drug discovery. Given the lengthy process of new drug development, the current strategy of drug repurposing has become one of the chosen solutions for immediate treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals. Long-term drug development goals for the pharmaceutical industry include identification of inhibitors aimed at the replication or infection processes associated with SARS-CoV-2 or other related coronaviruses, as well as the symptomatic results of their infections leading to severe disease and/or death. The summarized lists, contained in this report, of small molecule compounds, and additional descriptions of biologics with properties suitable for inhibiting several key coronavirus proteins, could serve as information starting points for drug development. Since vaccines are crucial for prevention of coronavirus-related epidemic diseases in the future, it is reassuring that a number of innovative strategies are already being deployed. Four MERS coronavirus DNA vaccine candidates began phase 1 clinical trials in September of 2019, 56 and Moderna Inc. released its first batch of mRNA-1273 in February of 2020, which is an mRNA vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 ready for phase 1 study in the United States. 55 Additional collaboration in the areas of antiviral discovery processes and clinical trial performance will enhance patients' access to drug candidates with improved therapeutic potential and ideally reduce the amount of time required to bring these drugs to market. The abundance of publications and the rapid publication rate associated with the SARS-CoV-2 virus-related disease outbreak, as illustrated in this report, are indicative of the intense effort by research institutes and pharmaceutical industries to address both molecular mechanisms and therapeutic routes useful for treating current and future coronavirus outbreaks.",
