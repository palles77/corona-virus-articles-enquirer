There may be no area where this is more clearly demonstrated than in translational diagnostics, a fi eld driven by innovation ( Ratner, 2006 ) . The implementation of genomics and other innovative diagnostics for personalized medicine requires the translation of a vast array of technologies and therapeutic strategies from basic science to clinical application.

Roadmap initiatives sought to improve the development and availability of modern scientifi c tools and information resources, foster novel methods of research collaboration, and enhance the nation's clinical research enterprise. The NIH funded the fi rst 12 Clinical and Translational Science Awards (CTSAs) in 2006 for academic centers conducting projects on translational research ( NCRR, 2006 ) ; additional centers are being named in subsequent years.",

Early laboratory medicine consisted primarily of the direct examination of tissue or the analysis of simple analytes in blood. Molecular biology techniques such as positional DNA cloning, DNA sequencing and nucleic acid hybridization assays led to early molecular diagnostics. Southern blot hybridization assays were used to detect gene deletions in Duchenne muscular dystrophy, repeat expansions in fragile X syndrome, and gene rearrangements diagnostic for B-and T-cell lymphoma ( Tsongalis and Silverman, 2006 ) . The fi rst molecular diagnostic products to reach the market included tests for the detection of viral RNA or DNA, genetic tests for single gene diseases, and tests to determine risk for developing certain cancers, such as breast or colon cancer. Many of the new diagnostic technologies entering the clinical laboratory are part of an evolution from nucleic acid amplifi cation technologies for use in amplifying, identifying, and sequencing target single gene sequences towards a systems biology approach which looks at the expression of multiple genes in response to a variety of stimuli and conditions such as infectious disease, drug therapy, and cancer ( Billings and Brown, 2004 ) . Systems biology is often used as a synonym for functional genomics, a description of the genomic and epigenomic infl uences on a trait and interactions with environmental variants (see Chapter 6).",

            "text": "As with the Human Immunodefi ciency Virus (HIV), quantifying the viral load of a wide variety of viral pathogens is needed to monitor both the progression of the disease and the response to therapy. Pathogen genotyping is also essential in order to identify variants resistant to therapy, and to differentiate closely-related species or viral types. Currently, the gold standard for pathogen detection is growth of the pathogen in culture. This process is time-consuming and in many cases non-informative. Diagnostic methods for viral detection consist primarily of immunological identifi cation of antibodies produced in response to viral infection. Molecular diagnostics utilizing nucleic acid amplifi cation testing (NAAT) have been used for viral load monitoring and genotyping for HIV and screening for HIV1, hepatitis B and C (HBV, HCV), and West Nile virus (WNV) ( Paxton, 2004 ) . In HIV and HCV there is a window between infection and detection of antibody production in which immunological methods fail to detect viral infection. This is a very important issue for blood safety and for the identifi cation of acute infections which may account for a high percentage of new clinical cases. NAAT testing has been implemented for blood screening and has been estimated to prevent about fi ve HIV-1 and 56 HCV infections per year. Another advantage of NAAT testing lies with the fl exibility of the platform in the face of emerging infectious disease threats. When WNV became a public health concern in 2002, these platforms were converted for the detection and monitoring of WNV within 9 months. With the incorporation of DNA microarray technologies, rapid pathogen detection and genotyping may be accomplished simultaneously. Recently, a protein microarray for Coronaviruses, including the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus, has been tested and found to distinguish between SARS and other Corona viruses ( Zhu et al., 2006 ) . Low-density microarray tests are being researched for use in subtyping infl uenza A and avian type H5N1. These types of arrays may soon have clinical utility for monitoring infl uenza worldwide, developing vaccines, and eventually for point of care applications ( Mehlmann et al., 2007 ) . This last application is very important, as determining the presence of infl uenza on solely clinical grounds is very diffi cult due to poor specifi city and sensitivity of clinical fi ndings, the other pathogens that cause similar symptoms, and the infl uenza subtypes that cause different symptoms. For example, up to 70% of patients with infl uenza symptoms are not infected with infl uenza virus, and up to 30% of those are due to Coronaviruses (Montalto, 2003 ; Brown, 2006 ) . CombiMatrix has developed a DNA microarray to detect and type infl uenza strains and Tm Bioscience Corp. (now Luminex) has developed a major human respiratory virus array. Molecular diagnostics can be utilized for sexually transmitted diseases such as Chlamydia trachomitis and Nisseria gonorrhea, as well as other bacterial pathogens such as Legionella pneumophilia (Legionnaire's disease), Borrelia burgdoreri (Lyme disease), Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and Bordetella pertussis and B. parapertussis (whooping cough). Despite effective vaccination programs, Bordetella pertussis remains an important and highly contagious disease due to the fact that newborns do not appear to gain passive maternal protection and vaccine-induced immunity is far less complete than expected. A real-time PCR assay that accurately detects and differentiates the DNA from both agents of pertussis syndromes has been developed ( Vincart et al., 2007) . This real-time PCR assay provides results within 24 h of sample receipt and provides clinicians with more timely and accurate information than that provided by culture, direct fl uorescence antibody, serological testing, or even conventional PCR methods. Additional applications include tissue product testing, bioterrorism monitoring, and characterization of host-pathogen interactions in the search for additional diagnostic biomarkers.",

However, these tests are neither sensitive nor specifi c enough to differentiate patients who will respond to treatment from those who will not. The application of high-throughput DNA array technologies, which provide gene expression profi les, has revolutionized tumor diagnostics and led to the identifi cation of novel tumor subgroups for otherwise indistinguishable tumors ( Dietel and Sers, 2006 ) . Researchers have also identifi ed genes the expression of which can be used to predict the metastatic potential of breast carcinomas. In the future, technologies that take a systems approach will be needed to identify patients who will benefi t from novel therapies. These methods must be capable of detecting multiple oncogenic pathways in tumors both before and during therapy and they must be adaptable to routine clinical diagnostic testing. Possible methods include: tissue microarrays; forward-phase protein microarrays, capable of simultaneously detecting multiple protein interactions with a single sample; and reverse-phase protein microarrays, capable of probing multiple analytes with specifi c antibodies ( Gulmann et al., 2006 ) .

Pharmacogenomics also infl uences the delivery and cost of healthcare ( Phillips et al., 2004 ) . Sensitivity, toxicity, and resistance to medications at standard doses are prime examples of the effect of genotypic heterogeneity within the patient population. Well known, clinically relevant examples include differential responses to warfarin, codeine, thiopurine antileukemic drugs, and succinylcholine. Genetic differences in receptor structure and affi nity, drug metabolism, and drug transport systems are now known to play an important role in both differential responses to drug therapy and adverse drug reactions (ADRs).",

Genetic variation in the genes encoding metabolic enzymes leads to differences in enzyme activity that can be characterized as extensive (standard dosage), intermediate (slower than extensive, altered dosage), poor (enzyme deficiency, do not treat with some drugs), and ultrarapid (break down drugs faster than extensive, no effect or reduced effectiveness from drug therapy). One class of metabolic enzymes is the cytochrome P450 superfamily (CYP) that comprises more than 40 isozymes. These enzymes metabolize a large number of drugs, small molecules, mutagens, and carcinogens by modifying parent molecule functional groups. Polymorphisms in the gene CYP2D6 can result in a homozygous recessive inactive genotype that cannot convert codeine into the active metabolite morphine ( Rabinowitz and Poljak, 2003 ) . In 2005, the FDAapproved Roche Diagnostic's AmpliChip CYP450 test, a P450 molecular array which detects mutations in both the CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 genes, which contribute to the metabolism of about a quarter of all prescribed drugs. The data provided by the AmpliChip aids physicians in determining drug selection and dosage. An example of the potential impact of CYP450 typing is illustrated by the drug warfarin which is metabolized by enzymes encoded by the gene CYP2C9. Polymorphisms in this gene infl uence warfarin dosing requirements and warfarin-associated bleeding ( Wittkowsky, 2002 ) . It has been demonstrated that the maintenance warfarin dose can be estimated from demographic, clinical, and pharmacogenetic factors ( Gage et al., 2004 ) . A second gene, VKORC1 , has been associated with the average weekly warfarin dose required to maintain patients at their desired anticoagulation target. With more information it is expected that predictive models for warfarin dosing can be developed and help the more than one million patients which each year take warfarin at appropriate dosage to avoid thromboembolic events ( Li et al., 2006 ) . Twelve percent of those users currently experience major bleeding episodes and death results in as many as 2%.",

However, by the mid-1990s, pharmaceutical companies had a number of antiviral compounds; some specifi cally tailored to HIV, well into clinical trials and needed an accurate biomarker to analyze effectiveness of the new therapies. This convergence of therapeutics and diagnostics would lead to the birth of the theranostic , a diagnostic test linked to the application of specifi c therapies ( Warner, 2004 ) . In 1996, Roche Diagnostics began the Roche Amplicor\u00ae Access Program to provide two free baseline HIV viral load tests to anyone in the United States with HIV ( James, 1996 ) . Reference laboratories helped execute this program, which began the successful uptake of HIV viral load testing in the marketplace. As with traditional diagnostics, molecular diagnostic tests needed to demonstrate utility and performance before their adoption into practice. First, there must be an unmet clinical need, which was clearly the case with HIV. Secondly, with the development of antiviral therapies, HIV viral load testing provided information that resulted in a therapeutic action, and also provided the means to continually monitor the effi cacy of the treatment.

This made it much simpler to educate physicians in the use of the viral load test for the management of HIV. Highly motivated patients fueled demand for the test. The viral load test had a signifi cant role in early clinical trials of antiviral therapeutics and became an objective measurement tool, even before any protease inhibitors were approved for physician use. Publications on the antiviral therapeutics included the HIV viral load results. Thought leaders who participated in the trials became early adopters of the test, even before the test was FDA approved. The viral load test was put into a kit format and became FDA approved at approximately the same time as the fi rst protease inhibitors became available. Recommendations for viral load testing became part of standard guidelines for treating HIV infection ( Chesebro and Everett, 1998 ) . The theranostic became tied to the use of the drug. Roche's Amplicor Access Program led to rapid test utilization. As volumes increased, manufacturers developed automation. HIV management requires relatively frequent monitoring, as often as four times per year. Therefore, the test was not a \"one off \" test as in constitutional genetic testing. HIV viral load testing also obtained its own CPT code, facilitating reimbursement. Additionally, the kit manufacturer, the national reference labs, patients, and doctors all worked to ensure that the test was reimbursed. These factors helped make HIV viral load testing cost effective and a foundation of HIV prevention efforts. The combination of viral load testing and new therapeutics transformed HIV from a uniformly fatal disease to a chronic treatable disease. Therefore, HIV has become a disease with an \"actionable \" result. Recent Centers for Disease Control (CDC) recommendations now call for general population screening for HIV status. This example of translating a diagnostic into patient care was successful because so many of the hallmarks of successful diagnostic tests were in place. There was an unmet clinical need, an actionable result was obtained from testing, the test was ultimately cost effective, high-throughput analysis became available, and reimbursement issues were rapidly resolved.",

Amplifi cation of the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 gene ( HER2) in primary breast cancer carcinomas had been shown to correlate to poor clinical prognosis for breast cancer patients ( Ferretti et al., 2007 ) . The Her2/neu oncogene is active in 25-37% of breast cancers, and overexpression of the HER2 protein on cell surfaces was found to stimulate uncontrolled tumor growth. Herceptin (trastuzumab) is a recombinant DNA-derived monoclonal antibody that binds with high affi nity and specifi city to the extracellular domain of the HER2 receptor and inhibits the proliferation of HER2 overexpressing tumor cells. Herceptin alone was associated with an objective response in 15% of extensively pretreated patients with metastatic breast cancer overexpressing HER2, and 26% of previously untreated patients ( McKeage and Perry, 2002 ) . Cardiac dysfunction occurred in 13% of patients receiving Herceptin and paclitaxel and in 4.7% of patients receiving only Herceptin. Given the high cost of Herceptin therapy, the signifi cant side effects of Herceptin treatment for some patients, and the targeted nature of the therapeutic, it was necessary to restrict therapy to patients expected to respond to treatment. In 1998, the FDA approved both Herceptin and the HerCepTest for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer. HER2 protein is detected primarily by IHC or FISH methods. HercepTest and PathVysion, a FISH assay for HER2 amplifi cation, are now used to select patients for Herceptin therapy. Uptake of diagnostic testing for HER2 receptor status was greatly accelerated due to safety issues associated with the therapy. Additionally, the assay did not require new tissue samples as in many cases archived samples in paraffi n blocks were already being sent to reference labs for estrogen and progesterone analysis, and physicians could merely check another box on the test order sheet. Randomized clinical trials have recently demonstrated signifi cant differences in survival when comparing chemotherapy to chemotherapy plus Herceptin in women with HER2 overexpressing breast cancer in either the metastatic or adjuvant setting ( Ferretti et al., 2007) . Thus, what was once a prognosticator of poor outcome for the patient has become a predictive marker of response to therapy. Unfortunately, a lack of concordance among detection techniques, different scoring systems used to determine HER2 status, and a lack of lab standardization and quality based on test experience have led to signifi cant variation in HER2 testing (Nelson, 2000 ) . Recent CAP/ASCO guidelines, that include a testing algorithm, QA requirements, lab evaluations, and a scoring system, should help address these issues ( CAP/ASCO, 2007 ) .",

In 2003, the FDA expanded the use of HPV testing in conjunction with the Pap test for routine screening. The test uses hybrid capture technology to directly detect HPV virus DNA and the current system allows high-throughput testing. A woman fi tting the appropriate clinical criteria with both a negative Pap and negative HPV DNA test has less than a one in one thousand chance of developing cervical cancer. In 2006, the FDA-approved Merck and Co's Gardisil, a recombinant vaccine which is designed to prevent the majority of HPV-related clinical diseases, those caused by HPV 6, 11, 16, and 18. HPV types 16 and 18 account for approximately 70% of cases of cervical cancer, while HPV 6 and 11 cause approximately 90% of genital wart cases. In clinical studies, Gardasil prevented 100% of HPV 16-and 18-related cervical cancer in women not previously exposed to the relevant HPV types. These studies were conducted on 21,000 women ages 16-26 and the vaccine was nearly 100% effective in preventing precancerous lesions and genital warts. Gardisil was evaluated and approved in 6 months under the FDA's priority review process, a process for products with potential to provide signifi cant health benefi ts ( FDA, 2006f ) . On June 28, 2006 the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended that all females between the ages of 11-26 receive the HPV vaccine as part of routine primary care.",

However, not all diagnostic tests fi nd their way to application in health care. For some, clinical utility may not be demonstrated due to the lack of an actionable result, cost-effectiveness, high-throughput methods, or adequate reimbursement. For example, early asymptomatic glaucoma testing was widely abandoned because early detection did not affect the outcome. Other tests may not achieve the analytical performance characteristics required of a good diagnostic. Assay sensitivity, specifi city, and predictive value must be high (Gaeta, 2005 ) . Reproducible precision and a clinically reportable range must be demonstrated ( Irwig, et al., 2002 ) . For example, before microarray technology can be translated widely to diagnostic applications, problems with sensitivity and reproducibility will have to solved ( Petrik, 2006 ) . A rigorous evaluation of diagnostic tests prior to their introduction into clinical practice is the goal of the standards for the reporting of diagnostic accuracy (STARD) initiative ( Bossuyt et al., 2003 ) and evaluation of genomic applications in practice and prevention (EGAPP), a CDC project to establish an evidence-based process for assessing applications of genomic technology ( CDC and National Offi ce of Public Health Genomics, 2008 ). Ultimately, the role of diagnostics in clinical care must be balanced with other tools available to the physician, such as patient history and physical exam (Halkin et al., 1997 ) . Additionally, technological advancements must produce an increase in effi cacy of treatment in excess of that produced by improving the delivery of older treatments ( Woolf and Johnson, 2005 ) .",
