Nonspecific complaints and an initially normal plain x-ray of the hip can delay the diagnosis. The diagnosis is established by plain x-ray, computerized tomography, magnetic resonance tomography, and scintigraphy. Conservative treatment alone is not considered adequate. The range of surgical treatments includes joint-preserving and (for more severe necrosis) joint-resecting methods.",

            "text": "Conclusion: Atraumatic femoral head necrosis in adults is a disease that progresses in stages; depending on its stage, it can either be cured or lead to hip arthrosis. adults is an acquired ischemic disease of the femoral head characterized by a multifactorial etiology. The initial manifestation is local, usually partial necrosis but the disease has the potential to progress to complete destruction of the femoral head with development of end-stage coxarthrosis. Although confirmed epidemiological data are lacking, FHN seems to be most common in men between the ages of 30 and 50 years (1) . Together with hip dysplasia and femoroacetabular impingement, FHN represents one of the leading causes of coxarthrosis in middle age. The necrosis is bilateral in 30 to 70% of cases. If left untreated, FHN leads to severe secondary joint destruction in a high proportion of patients. Extrapolation from the published data suggest an incidence of 0.01% in the German-speaking countries, with 5000 to 7000 persons affected each year (2). Despite the low incidence and prevalence compared with primary coxarthrosis, FHN has a significant economic impact because it largely affects persons in the prime of life (peak age 35 years). For these reasons early diagnosis of FHN and appropriate treatment according to disease stage assume special importance, with prevention of primary and secondary damage in the foreground.",

Core decompression is a promising treatment option particularly in the early stages ARCO I and II, provided the necrosis in stage II does not extend around more than 30% of the femoral head circumference and-by definition-no subchondral fractures are present (32) . Superiority of core decompression to conservative treatment alone is described by Mont et al. and supported by two RCTs in their meta-analysis (33) . Restitutio ad integrum cannot reliably be achieved with joint-preserving surgery in ARCO stage II, but decompression leads to alleviation of pain and can slow down the destructive process (33) . In ARCO stage III core decompression may result in short-term pain relief, but is associated with much worse results in terms of progression and prognosis than in stage II.",

If left untreated, it may lead within a few years to severe joint destruction and development of coxarthrosis. Although the causes and mechanisms of atraumatic FHN have not yet been finally clarified, certain risk factors are known to be associated with increased incidence of osteonecrosis of the femoral head. Atraumatic FHN often affects relatively young people with active private and working lives. This underlines the importance of early confirmation of the diagnosis and initiation of the corresponding treatment, with the aim of preserving as much joint function as possible and minimizing later damage. In the early stages the patient's symptom's are frequently unspecific and radiography often reveals no abnormality, so careful evaluation of the risk factors and timely MRI are particularly important. The MRI examination should include the contralateral (asymptomatic) hip joint. The ARCO classification of atraumatic FHN has been widely adopted in the German-speaking countries, permitting assessment of the disease course, comparison of the efficacy of the different treatment methods, and providing assistance in determining the best treatment. Complete recovery can be attained in ARCO stage I, but in stage II joint-preserving procedures often do no more than slow the pace of progression. Stages III and IV of atraumatic FHN are an expression of mechanical failure of the hip joint. The efficacy of conservative treatment alone is a topic of heated debate in the literature. Joint-preserving procedures may be successful in the early stages (ARCO I and II) and are superior to conservative treatment alone. Joint replacement should be considered in late-stage atraumatic FHN and is in many cases the only feasible treatment option. The results of arthroplasty for atraumatic FHN have improved greatly in recent years and are now equivalent to those for primary coxarthrosis.
