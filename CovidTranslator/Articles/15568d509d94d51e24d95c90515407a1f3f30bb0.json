Although SH protein is important for viral infectivity, its exact role during viral infection is not clear. Herein, we have studied the secondary structure, orientation, and oligomerization of the transmembrane domain of SH (SH-TM) in the presence of lipid bilayers. Only one oligomer, a pentamer, was observed in PFO-PAGE. Using polarized attenuated total reflection-Fourier transform infrared (PATR-FTIR) spectroscopy, we show that the SH-TM is a-helical. The rotational orientation of SH-TM was determined by site-specific infrared dichroism (SSID) at two consecutive isotopically labeled residues. This orientation is consistent with that of an evolutionary conserved pentameric model obtained from a global search protocol using 13 homologous sequences of RSV. Conductance studies of SH-TM indicate ion channel activity, which is cation selective, and inactive below the predicted pK a of histidine. Thus, our results provide experimental evidence that the transmembrane domain of SH protein forms pentameric a-helical bundles that form cation-selective ion channels in planar lipid bilayers. We provide a model for this pore, which should be useful in mutagenesis studies to elucidate its role during the virus cycle.",

During infection, the majority of the SH protein accumulates at the lipid-raft structures of the Golgi complex (Rixon et al. 2004) , and also at the cell surface. Only a very low amount of SH protein is associated with the viral envelope (Rixon et al. 2004 ). SH is categorized as an accessory protein of hRSV, as it is not essential for viral replication in vitro (Bukreyev et al. 1997) . However, deletion of the SH gene leads to attenuation in mouse and chimpanzee models, suggesting it is important for infectivity (Bukreyev et al. 1997; Whitehead et al. 1999) .",

Biochemical studies have shown that the SH protein has a single hydrophobic region that spans the membrane, with the more hydrophilic C terminus oriented extracellularly (Collins and Mottet 1993) . Several forms of SH protein are present during infection, which vary in their glycosylation status (Olmsted and Collins 1989) : two not glycosylated forms, full-length 7.5 kDa (SH 0 ) and a truncated 4.5-kDa species (SH t ) , an N-linked glycosylated form (SH g ), and a polylactosaminoglycan-modified form (SH p ). All, except the truncated SH t , are incorporated at the surface of the infected cells, where non-glycosylated SH 0 appears to be the most abundant form (Collins and Mottet 1993) . In addition to these modifications, the tyrosine residues of SH protein are phosphorylated during infection, and this modification affects its cellular distribution (Rixon et al. 2005) .",

This procedure allows us to define not only conserved interactions, but also oligomeric size (Torres et al. 2000 (Torres et al. , 2002 (Torres et al. , 2005 Lin et al. 2006; Gan et al. 2007 ).

            "text": "To determine which one of these two models is correct, we measured the rotational orientation of SH-TM ahelices in model lipid bilayers (DMPC) shown in Figure  3 . Both the frequencies of amide A (Fig. 3A ,C), at 3305 cm \u00c01 , and amide I (Fig. 3B,D) , centered at 1653 cm \u00c01 , are consistent with an a-helical conformation (Byler and Susi 1986) . In the peptide labeled at L30, the band corresponding to the isotopic 13 C\u00bc 18 O label is centered at 1592 cm \u00c01 (Fig. 3B, arrow) , as expected for a residue in an a-helical conformation (Torres et al. 2001b) . For the peptide labeled at residue L31, however, this band appeared at a lower frequency, 1576 cm \u00c01 (Fig. 3D , arrow). As this band is not obscured by either amide I or II, and is well resolved (see Fig. 3D ), this shift did not affect the measurement. The down-shift of the frequency of this band, relative to L30, is explained in the Discussion section. The dichroic ratios obtained for each label in DMPC are listed in Table 1 . Using the equations for SSID described in Materials and Methods (Arkin et al. 1997) , we obtained an average v 30 of 258\u00b0(67.3\u00b0). This orientation is only consistent with that of model 2 (Fig. 2 , lower panel), which is 240\u00b0. The helix tilt obtained from SSID was 21.5\u00b0(61.3\u00b0), which is also similar to that of model 2. The fractional order parameter (Arkin et al. 1997) , f, was around 0.5. Slices through the pentameric model 2 are presented in Figure 4 .",

Therefore, we repeated these infrared measurements in POPC (T m \u00bc \u00c02\u00b0C), which should form a fluid liquid crystal phase. This was indeed observed by a shift of the lipid symmetric methylene stretching vibration, from 2849 cm \u00c01 to 2852 cm \u00c01 , and the anti-symmetric methylene stretching vibration, from 2917 cm \u00c01 to 2922 cm \u00c01 (not shown) (Tamm and Tatulian 1997) .

From the linear current-voltage plots shown in Figure 5B , we calculated a conductance of ;35 pS, and \u00c068.1 mV for the reversal potential, close to the sodium Nernst potential in our experiment (\u00c059.1 mV), indicating that the channel is cation selective. At voltages below and above the reversal potential, the channel activities were similar Histidine is the only protonatable residue in the SH-TM (Fig. 2) . In model 1 (Fig. 2 ) the histidine is facing the lipid acyl chains, whereas in model 2 it is facing the lumen of the pore. To confirm our SSID results that point to model 2, we tested the effect of pH on the conductance observed. Thus, we measured the ion channel activity at a pH below (4.0) and above (7.4) the expected pK a of histidine in these conditions. In the bulk, the expected pK a of histidine imidazole is 6.4 (Cymes et al. 2005) , whereas in the tetrameric pore of M2 from influenza A, this value was determined to be ;5.8 (#5100) (Okada et al. 2001) . Figure 5D shows a much lower conductance at pH 4.0, and the current has the opposite sign. This strong pH dependence confirms that His must be exposed to the lumen of the pore, as in model 2.",

In model 2, H22 is facing the lumen of the pore, which is reminiscent of the orientation of H37 in influenza A M2 (Kovacs and Cross 1997) . However, whereas M2 becomes open at low pH, below the pK a of histidine (Okada et al. 2001) , we observed that conductance of SH-TM is reduced drastically from pH 7.4 to 4. This suggests that histidine protonation stops cation transport due to an electrostatic effect. A small opposite conductance is observed at pH 4.0, which could indicate chloride transport.",

We attribute this shift to the presence of an extra hydrogen bond with another side chain group or solvent, which has the effect of weakening the C\u00bcO bond. Indeed, the ahelical model of SH-TM is compatible with an intrahelical hydrogen bond between the side chain of S35 and the backbone carbonyl oxygen of L31 (Fig. 6 ). There is a high tendency for serine and threonine residues to form intrahelix hydrogen bonds to carbonyl oxygen at position i-4 (Baker and Hubbard 1984) , and to our knowledge, this is the first instance of such spectral effect observed. Statistical studies of high resolution structures of several membrane proteins and soluble proteins have suggested that intrahelical hydrogen bonding between the side chain of serine or threonine to the carbonyl oxygen in the preceding turn could induce a kink in the a-helix that may be important for function (Ballesteros et al. 2000) .

Henceforth, the simulation was repeated by increasing the helix tilt in discrete steps of 10\u00b0, up to 45\u00b0. We must note that the restraint for the helix tilt is not completely strict, i.e., at the end of the simulation a drift of up to 65\u00b0from the initial restrained value could be observed in some cases. Three trials were carried out for each starting configuration using different initial random velocities, for right-and left-handed configurations, and only for pentamers, for all 13 sequences, totaling 13,650 structures. Clusters were identified for each tilt with a minimum number of similar structures. Any structure belonging to a certain cluster was within 1.0 \u00c5 RMSD from any other structure within the same cluster.

A bilayer membrane was formed on a 250mm (or 150-mm) septum of a Delrin cup with a working volume of 1 mL in each cis and trans chamber. Single channel experiments were carried out in asymmetric ionic conditions. The cis and trans chambers consist of 500 mM NaCl, 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.2, and 50 mM NaCl and 50 mM of HEPES, pH 7.2, respectively. A lipid cocktail of POPE:POPS:POPC (5:3:2, v/v/v) and a lipid concentration of 50 mg/mL were used to form the artificial lipid bilayer. The lipid cocktail was painted onto the hole of the Delrin cup. Usually the bilayer could be formed quickly in the presence of asymmetric solution. The bilayer formation was examined electrically by the current amplitude when a voltage pulse was applied.",

After the formation of the bilayer across the aperture of the septum, small aliquots of SH-TM (;5-10 mg) reconstituted in liposome were added to the cis chamber with continuous stirring to facilitate the insertion of the peptide into the planar lipid bilayer. Stirring of the solution was stopped when channel activity was detected. Electrical currents were recorded using a Bilayer Clamp BC-525D amplifier (Warner Instruments) in capacitive feedback configuration via Ag/AgCl electrodes linked via agar salt bridges (2% of agarose in 1 M NaCl). The trans chamber was set as reference and the cis chamber was held at different potentials ranging from \u00c0100 mV to +20 mV in 20-mV increments. Data were filtered at 50 Hz with an 8-pole Bessel filter, and analog output signal was digitized at a sampling rate of 1 kHz by using an A/D converter (Digidata 1322A, Axon Instruments). Data processing was performed using pClamp 9.2 software (Axon Instruments). Single channel conductance was calculated from the corresponding Gaussian fits using SigmaPlot 9.0 software (Systat Software, Inc.) to current histograms by using data from segments of continuous recordings lasting longer than 10 s. Openings shorter than 0.5 ms were ignored. To avoid electrostatic interference during recording, the recording cells were placed in a Faraday cage set on a mechanically isolated table to obtain low-noise recording of single channel currents. Data were recorded at room temperature. Voltages were corrected for calculated liquid junction potential using pClamp 9.2 software (Axon Instruments).",
