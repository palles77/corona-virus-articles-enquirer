            "text": "Cats have the ability to control posture and movements of the body and eyes relative to their external environment. The vestibular system mediates these activities through a network of receptors and neural elements. This system integrates peripheral sensory information from vestibular, somatosensory, and visual receptors, in addition to motor information from the cerebellum and cerebral cortex. Central processing of these inputs occurs rapidly and provides coordinated relevant muscle movements. Although the vestibular system is considered as a special sense, most vestibular activity is conducted at a subconscious level. Disease leading to dysfunction of the vestibular system can lead to dramatic signs of dysequilibrium. Treatment and prognosis for causes of dysequilibrium differ, depending on whether the peripheral or central components of the system are affected. This chapter outlines relevant anatomy of the vestibular system with emphasis on the clinical signs of vestibular dysfunction. Additionally, an overview of the diseases responsible for vestibular dysfunction in cats is provided.",

            "text": "The location for the first-order neuron is within the vestibular ganglion of cranial nerve VIII or the vestibulocochlear nerve. The axon projects to the ipsilateral vestibular nuclei. These neurons receive input from the vestibular receptors contained within the membranous labyrinth that is surrounded by a bony labyrinth located in the petrous temporal bone. The membranous labyrinth consists of four fluid-filled, communicating compartments; these include the saccule and utriculus, three semicircular ducts, and a cochlear duct (Figure 56 -2). [1] [2] [3] [4] Specifically, the vestibular portion of the eighth cranial nerve innervates five sites: the crista of the ampulla of each of the three semicircular ducts and the maculae of the utricle and saccule. Each semicircular duct is orientated at right angles to the others and connects at both ends with the utriculus, which in turn communicates with the saccule. Movement of endolymph contained within the membranous labyrinth is responsible for stimulation of the receptors; the endolymph is thought to be derived from blood. 5 The crista detects head movement. Neuroepithelial cells are stimulated by the movement of the crista's gelatinous cupula secondary to the flow of endolymph as the head turns; any movement deflects the cupula and cilia, which leads to their depolarization and propagation of nerve impulses to the vestibular neurons. Primary function of the crista involves dynamic equilibrium with regard to acceleration and deceleration. [1] [2] [3] [4] 6, 7 The maculae detect head orientation; the macula of the utricle is parallel to the ground with its \"hairs\" pointing dorsally, and the macula of the saccule is vertical with its \"hairs\" pointing laterally. Constant input from gravity acts upon the neuroepithelial cells of each macula, subsequently causing them to fire. These slow-adapting receptors are responsible for sensing static position of the head and linear acceleration and deceleration. [2] [3] [4] 6, 7 The sensory neurons of the vestibulocochlear nerve consist of cell bodies in the spiral ganglion located within the modiolus of the cochlea. The vestibulocochlear nerve and the facial nerve exit the petrous temporal bone through the internal acoustic meatus. The nerve enters the medulla of the brainstem at the ventrolateral margin of the trapezoid body. A branch of the vestibulocochlear nerve enters the medulla directly, and a branch travels within the acoustic stria on the dorsal surface of the medulla and caudal cerebellar peduncle before entering the brainstem. The course of the vestibulocochlear nerve stays within the cranium. 1, 3, 5, 7 ",

The lateral and the rostral nuclei are juxtapositioned dorsally to the cerebellar peduncles. 1, 3, 5, 6 Similar to the auditory pathway, axons from the vestibular nuclei have ipsilateral and contralateral projections. Some axons course within the medial longitudinal fasciculus and project to the contralateral medial geniculate nucleus of the thalamus. Ascending fibers within the fasciculus give off numerous branches to the motor nuclei of cranial nerves III, IV, and VI before synapsing in the medial geniculate nucleus. This pathway coordinates conjugate eye movements associated with changes in position of the head. The medial longitudinal fasciculus also contains fibers that descend to the spinal cord.

Essential determination of whether these signs are due to a peripheral or central disease may be possible by the identification of associated neurological signs that are associated only with central disease. 1, 3 Signs of central vestibular syndrome suggest brainstem involvement and are not present in patients with inner ear disease except in cases of direct extension of the disease process, 8 such as can be seen with otitis media/interna 9 and neoplasia. 8",

A loss of cerebellar inhibition over intact vestibular nuclei could result in hyperactivity of the latter, which simulates a relative loss of function on the other side. 1 Cats with bilateral peripheral vestibular disease do not have asymmetrical lesions such as a head tilt, but have a characteristic \"side-to-side\" head movement (Figure 56-6) .",

If nystagmus of any direction is induced only when the head is placed in an unusual position, it is known as positional nystagmus ( Figure 56-10) , which may be more common with, but not specific for, central disease; this term also may refer to nystagmus that changes its predominant direction with altered head positions. A reliable way to induce positional nystagmus is to decompensate the cat by quickly positioning the cat on its back. Eye movements typically are described to have a slow and fast phase. Damage to the vestibular system on one side impedes the resting baseline activity on this side, with the normal side continuing to emit baseline activity, now interpreted as head rotation to the normal side. 3, 5, 7, 12 Therefore, the nystagmus occurs with the fast phase away from the damaged side and with the slow phase directed commonly toward the affected side; the exception is in the case of paradoxical disease (see section on head tilt above). The direction also can depend on whether the lesion is irritative or destructive to the vestibular system. 1 With acute onset nystagmus, the eyelids may be seen to contract at a rate corresponding to that of the nystagmus. Nystagmus may disappear in chronic lesions as a result of adaptation, particularly with peripheral disease; however, its presence usually indicates an active disease process within the vestibular apparatus. Cats with bilateral vestibular disease do not have pathological or physiological nystagmus.",

Because of the level of patient \"cooperation\" with cats, sedation or a light plane of general anesthesia often is needed for this test to be performed and interpreted properly. Small (27-gauge) needle electrodes are placed subcutaneously in the scalp and connected to sensitive amplifiers that can record signals in the microvolt range. 30 The electrodes are arranged with the positive electrode over the bregma on the dorsum of the skull, the negative electrode just rostral to the base of the pinna of the ear to be tested, and the reference electrode in the same position relative to the untested ear (Figure 56-14) . The brain activity, resulting from broad-spectrum sounds, such as clicks delivered at 10 to 20 Hz through earphones inserted into the external ear canal, usually is averaged for 10 milliseconds (ms) for the early latency or brainstem potentials Averaging for 50 ms includes a record of middle latency responses, but these are not as well documented in cats. 31 The BAEP recording consists of six to seven positive time-locked peaks (I through VII) beginning at approximately 1 ms after the stimulation (Figure 56-15 ). Wave I represents acoustic nerve activity, and subsequent waves mark peak activities as sound is being processed through ascending portions of the auditory pathway ( Figure 56 ",

The same interpretive principles used for the radiographic diagnosis of peripheral vestibular diseases apply to CT. Findings are more apparent on transverse CT images, however, because of reduced superimposition of structures in comparison to radiographs. CT can allow for an earlier diagnosis of subtle lesions. On a well-positioned study, both bullae should appear symmetrical, although subtle variations occur. Lumina of the tympanic bulla and the external ear canals are gas filled (see Figure 38 -16).

Organisms isolated commonly from the bullae include Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus spp., Pasteurella spp., Proteus spp., Escherichia coli, Enterococcus spp., Pseudomonas spp., and obligate anaerobes. Yeast infections are an uncommon cause of otitis media. 44 Diagnosis is based on otoscopic examination, myringotomy, and imaging. Otitis externa may be evident but is not necessarily the origin of the bacterial infection. Bulging and discoloration of the tympanum may be identified if the bulla contains fluid or an exudate. Fluid within the middle ear can be collected by myringotomy for cytological examination and anaerobic and aerobic culture/sensitivity. 36 The external ear canal also is cultured. Skull radiography is performed with the cat under general anesthesia. The latero-20-degree ventrolaterodorsal oblique and rostral-30-degree ventral-caudodorsal open-mouth oblique views are best for evaluation of the tympanic bullae. 41 Common radiographic findings associated with otitis media/interna include soft tissue opacity in the bulla and/or petrous temporal bone and bony proliferation of the petrous temporal bone (Figure 56-18) . 26 If the infection is severe enough, lysis of the tympanic bullae also can be visible.",

A study that compared CT with radiography for diagnosis of otitis media/interna found CT to have 11 per cent false-positives and 17 per cent false-negatives for diagnosis confirmed by surgical findings. CT was a more sensitive but less specific technique than skull radiography. 45, 46 Neither radiography nor CT was able to detect early lesions associated with otitis media/interna when no osseous involvement occurred. Otitis interna is difficult to assess with CT except in cases of severe destruction of the inner ear. MRI findings that are compatible with otitis media include mediumsignal intensity material in the tympanic bulla on a T1W sequence and hyperintense on a T2W sequence. 25 The inner margin of the tympanic bulla also may enhance after gadolinium administration. 42 Osseous lesions of the tympanic bulla are more difficult to assess with MRI. An MRI finding of otitis interna is a lack of signal intensity of the labyrinthine fluid on T2W sequences. 42 This may represent replacement of the fluid with fibrous tissue; however, similar findings are seen in normal ears. Meningeal enhancement on post-contrast T1W sequences also has been described secondary to otitis interna. 47 Treatment consists of long-term (6 to 8 weeks) antibiotic therapy and prognosis usually is good. Improvement often occurs within 1 to 2 weeks of therapy. Refractory cases may require surgical drainage of the tympanic bulla. 36, 48 Cryptococcosis more often causes central vestibular dysfunction. However, three cats have been reported with peripheral vestibular disease referable to otitis media/interna because of cryptococcosis. 49 The infection was isolated from the tympanic bulla in two cats and the eustachian tube in one cat. All cats responded well to surgical drainage and medical therapy. 49 Nasopharyngeal polyps are pedunculated masses that can arise from the epithelial lining of the tympanic cavity, eustachian tube, or nasopharynx. 44, 50, 51 Nonseptic otitis media/ interna may occur secondary to occlusion of the eustachian tube because of a nasopharyngeal polyp, and polyps may occur as a result of chronic middle ear infection or from ascending infection from the nasopharynx. 44, 52 Polyps are especially common in young adult to middle-age cats, with no apparent gender or breed predisposition. Clinical signs include peripheral vestibular dysfunction, head-shaking, aural discharge, facial nerve paralysis, and Horner's syndrome. 44 Clinical signs of nasopharyngeal involvement include dysphagia, stertorous respiration, respiratory distress, and change in phonation. A secondary suppurative meningoencephalitis has been documented in a young cat with lesion extension of an inflammatory polyp within the tympanic bulla. 53 Inflammatory polyps of the middle ear can be visualized using otoscopy or by inspection of the oropharynx with the cat under general anesthesia. A lateral skull radiograph can reveal a soft tissue mass in the nasopharyngeal area and assist with the identification of nasopharyngeal polyps (Figure 56-19) . 25 Other radiographic findings associated with polyps include unilateral or bilateral soft tissue opacity within the tympanic bulla and sclerosis of the osseous bulla. 26, 41 Transverse, sagittal, and parasagittal CT images of nasopharyngeal polyps in cats have been described. 53, 54 CT can lateralize the lesion and assess the lesion extent.",

No specific treatment exists for IFVS besides managing the clinical signs such as anorexia, which may accompany this condition. Prognosis for spontaneous recovery is good although this may take 2 to 4 weeks, and 25 per cent of affected cats may have residual deficits such as a head tilt. 58 I have seen recurrence of signs with IFVS to be more common in cats than dogs with idiopathic vestibular disease.",

This is the most common nutritional deficiency affecting the CNS, usually resulting in lesions of the oculomotor and vestibular nuclei, the caudal colliculus, and lateral geniculate nucleus. 44 The earliest neurological sign is vestibular ataxia, progressing to seizures, dilated nonresponsive pupils, and ultimately coma. 36 Treatment is administration of thiamine, parenterally (100 to 250 mg q12h) or intravenously. 36, 44 Neoplasms Neoplasms can affect the medulla of the brainstem or vestibular pathways associated with the cerebellum directly (parenchymal compression or invasion) or indirectly to cause central vestibular dysfunction. Neoplasms can affect these regions indirectly by (1) causing an obstructive hydrocephalus affecting the fourth ventricle and/or (2) increasing intracranial pressure, causing a rostrocaudal shift of the forebrain and/or hindbrain with subsequent cerebellar herniation through the foramen magnum. Space-occupying lesions in the region of the cerebellomedullary pontine angle often can be responsible for paradoxical vestibular syndrome. 10, 19 Rarely, middle ear tumors in cats may extend medially to involve the brainstem. 37 The most common neoplasms in cats that affect this region are meningioma and lymphoma, but a cerebellar oligodendroglioma causing paradoxical signs also has been described in the cat. 19, [70] [71] [72] In a study of 137 intracranial tumors in cats, five meningiomas, 12 lymphomas, and three glial cell tumors were documented to occur in the region of the cerebellomedullary angle and the region of the fourth ventricle.

Seven such cats with otitis media/interna have been documented, in one study, with CNS dysfunction that included central vestibular signs. 78 MRI was extremely effective in demonstrating the location, extent, and relationship to normal structures of inflammation of the middle ear and brainstem in all cases. A mild to severe neutrophilic pleocytosis was present in the CSF of four of five cats tested. Marked neurological improvement was seen in all the cats, which underwent surgical drainage in addition to prolonged antibiotic therapy. 78 Extension of bacterial infection into the CNS also has been documented in a 15-month-old male Maine Coon cat with an inflammatory polyp of the middle ear. 53 The cat required a ventral bulla osteotomy to remove the polyp in addition to broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy for the secondary suppurative meningoencephalitis but made a good recovery with a residual head tilt. MRI is useful in detecting brain abscessation secondary to otitis media/interna. 25 Abscessation with extension of an inner ear infection can affect the brainstem and has a heterogenous signal intensity on T1W and T2W images (Figure 56-23) . A ring-enhancing lesion with extension into the tympanic bulla can be seen after intravenous contrast administration. 79 FELINE INFECTIOUS PERITONITIS. Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) results from infection with a mutated form of feline enteric coronavirus and represents the most common cause of inflammatory brain disease in cats. 77 Neurological disease usually is seen with the noneffusive form of FIP, and up to a third of cats with this form of disease develop neurological disease. 80 Some affected cats have evidence of disease only localized to the CNS. Insidious multifocal or diffuse CNS clinical signs are seen, which commonly include vestibular dysfunction. Analysis of CSF is the most useful antemortem diagnostic test, which often reveals a neutrophilic pleocytosis with a marked protein elevation (more than 200 mg/dL). 77 However, this test cannot be relied upon to be either sensitive or specific for FIP. Positive coronavirus antibody titers in the CSF are the most reliable indicator of the disease, 80 but only if an albumin quotient and IgG index rule out serum protein translocation across a disrupted blood-brain barrier. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing of the CSF recently has become available; unfortunately, only a third of cats with neurological FIP have positive CSF PCR results, and only two thirds of brain tissue specimens actually are PCR-positive. 80 Advanced imaging reveals the presence of hydrocephalus in the majority of affected cats. 77 No documented effective treatment exists, and the prognosis is poor.",

Cryptococcosis is the most common systemic mycosis of cats. Feline cryptococcosis has been reviewed extensively. 81 More than 80 per cent of cats present with signs of nasal cavity disease, including sneezing, nasal discharge, respiratory stridor, and subcutaneous masses at the nostrils (see Figure 38 -5). The CNS occasionally is involved, manifesting with multifocal neurological signs, including central vestibular dysfunction. CSF analysis is the most helpful diagnostic test in cats with CNS cryptococcosis. The organism may be identified cytologically or cultured from the CSF. A positive capsular antigen test can provide a definitive diagnosis. 77 Treatment consists of triazole drugs (fluconazole, itraconazole) for at least 2 months beyond resolution of the clinical signs. 77 Fluconazole crosses the blood-brain-barrier readily and is the preferred antifungal agent. The decision to discontinue therapy is based upon repeat CSF analysis results, serology, and resolution of clinical signs. Often patients require long-term antifungal therapy.

FIE affects cats of all ages and most commonly in the months of July and August. The main clinical signs are acute in onset, focal, and lateralizing; these include depression, blindness, circling, and central vestibular dysfunction. 84 This has been associated with Cuterebra spp. migration. Although central vestibular signs have been reported with this abnormality, other neurological signs supportive of forebrain disease are more common. 85 Diagnosis is based on focal lesions identified by advanced imaging and CSF analysis. Treatment is supportive care. Gradual improvement of clinical signs can occur over several months, but residual signs are likely. Severe cases can be fatal.",
