            "text": "An epidemic is a chain reaction of disease spread within a population. Epidemics can be described and sometimes predicted by mathematical models because they involve relatively simple processes occurring within large populations of individuals. 'Simple' means that infection and disease progression can be characterized by the transition of an individual from one state to another; for example, from a state of being uninfected and susceptible to infection, or to an infected state following contact with an infectious individual, or from the infected to the recovered state following recovery from infection and the acquisition of immunity. Defining a model therefore involves classifying the possible infection states of an individual and the processes causing movement between those states. The aim then is to predict changes through time in the proportions of the population in different infection states, and the incidence of disease-related events. This contribution discusses the modelling of epidemics, but similar techniques can be used to study the pathogenesis of viral or bacterial infections within an infected individual.",

This process can crudely be divided into three phases (Figure 1) , Establishment -the epidemic grows from the first infected t individual to a point at which sufficient individuals are infected that random extinction of the disease is unlikely. Many epidemics can die out after infection of only one or two individuals, if the last infected individual recovers (or dies) before infecting anyone else. This randomness means that the establishment phase can be relatively long and is variable in duration -a possible explanation for the several decades that passed between HIV entering the human population before 1950 and the recognition of a large-scale epidemic in the early 1980s.",

Hence, the number infected by one individual is now reduced by the proportion of the population that is no longer susceptible. This causes the incidence of new infections to decline, and when the susceptible population is exhausted, the primary epidemic is over. Disease extinction is again possible by chance, particularly in small populations. Otherwise, infection continues, with new births replenishing the susceptible population, and eventually an endemic equilibrium is reached in which every infected person infects one other individual on average. From the definition of R 0 , this occurs when 1/R 0 of an individual's contacts are susceptible at any point in time, and thus R 0 not only determines the epidemic growth rate, but also the proportion of the population that are infected by the disease, and the steady-state incidence of infection.",

Biostatistical techniques for such estimations are developing rapidly, but many problems remain, largely caused by the non-linear nature of transmission models and the extremely complex dynamics that they sometimes produce; this can include chaotic behaviour and stochastically induced intermittency in epidemic timing. Dynamic complexity can also place fundamental limits on the predictability of trends in the incidence of infectious disease. In some cases, short-term prediction of the course of an epidemic may be possible. In others, models may be predictive only in a probabilistic sense; for example, it might be possible to predict the number of epidemics of a certain size likely to occur in the next 10 years, but impossible to precisely predict weekly disease incidence over the next few months. Distinguishing these situations is a key challenge in epidemic modelling.",
