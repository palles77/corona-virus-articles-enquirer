            "text": "Background: Croup is a common respiratory illness in children. It presents with a barky cough, stridor and hoarseness occurring secondary to inflammation of the subglottis and larynx. The clinical course of croup is welldescribed, however atypical presentations pose a diagnostic and management challenge. Objectives: This case report and systematic review aims to synthesize the published literature on the definition, diagnosis and treatment of atypical croup. Study selection: Peer-reviewed journal publications in Ovid MEDLINE\u00ae and EMBASE from inception to January 1, 2019 in English, focusing on pediatric patients (< 18 years of age) with diagnoses of atypical croup. Data extraction: Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Results: Twelve studies involving 670 patients ranging from 6 months to 11 years of age presenting with atypical croup were selected. A variety of definitions of atypical croup were identified based on recurrence, duration of symptoms, severity, and etiology. Data on the incidence of atypical croup, the overall rates of intubation and tracheostomy, and patient characteristics leading to definitive airway management were not clearly characterized. Limitations: All studies were case series, case reports or retrospective chart reviews. Conclusions: Atypical croup is a poorly defined clinical entity that is used to describe recurrent, refractory, or croup-like illness that follows an uncharacteristic natural history. Our case presentation and accompanying literature review highlights the variable, but limited, information available on the diagnosis of atypical croup. Given the commonality of its use in clinical practice, we propose some guidelines around the use of the term 'atypical croup' as well as a management algorithm.",

            "text": "Croup develops in more than 80,000 Canadian children annually and accounts for 5% of emergency hospital admissions in children under 6 years of age [1] . In its current use, a diagnosis of croup encompasses a number of respiratory illnesses characterized by varying degrees of inspiratory stridor, cough, and hoarseness resulting from inflammation and narrowing of the larynx. Viral croup (acute laryngotracheitits) refers to the typical croup syndrome that occurs in children at the peak ages of six months to three years [2] . It is characterized by hoarseness, stridor, and a barky cough that occurs after a viral prodrome of low-grade fever and coryza lasting 12-72 h. Symptoms tend to worsen at night, and when the child is agitated or crying. Viral croup is most commonly caused by parainfluenza virus type 1, as well as parainfluenza type 2 and 3, rhinovirus, coronavirus, adenovirus, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) [3, 4] . This results in erythema and swelling of the lateral walls of the trachea and larynx, leading to epithelial necrosis and laryngeal and subglottic narrowing secondary to inflammation [3, 5] . The disease process is self-limited with resolution typically within one week [6, 7] . In mild cases, a single dose of oral dexamethasone may be administered. In moderate to severe cases, dexamethasone and nebulized epinephrine are the mainstay of therapy. In cases of failure of medical treatment, progression to exhaustion from increased work of breathing, hypercapnic or hypoxic respiratory failure, or imminent airway obstruction, treatment with endotracheal intubation is warranted. The incidence of intubation is approximately 3% for all patients admitted for croup [8] [9] [10] .",

Patients with uncharacteristic presentations or abnormal natural history are commonly diagnosed with atypical croup. The use of this term leads to several difficulties in the management of these patients in the acute care setting. Given there is no definitive diagnostic or management pathway for atypical croup, patients are often subject to radiographic studies and operative assessments that require a general anesthetic. The primary objective of this case report and systematic review is to evaluate the published definitions of atypical croup.

He was subsequently transferred to the Alberta Children's Hospital (ACH) pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) due to airway concerns. Although he remained non-toxic and playful, his biphasic stridor only improved briefly with medical therapy.

(1998) [13] , [16] , [17] , [20] . In a retrospective chart review, Hatherill et al. (2001) assessed the presence of ulcerative lesions on microlaryngoscopy in children with croup who were admitted to the PICU [15] . Laryngeal ulcerations were identified in 10% of children admitted while 18% had gingivostomatitis consistent with HSV infection. Furthermore, in a review performed by Cooper et al. (2012) of 80 children diagnosed with atypical croup, 33 had large airway lesions, which included subglottic stenosis, laryngeal clefts, subglottic hemangiomas, tracheomalacia, and laryngomalacia [11] . In addition, the authors reported associations between atypical croup and atopic conditions such as eosinophilic esophagitis. The authors recommended that endoscopy be coupled with allergy and gastrointestinal investigations in children with atypical croup. Barnes et al. (1999) described a case where laryngoscopy revealed two large subglottic cysts in addition to subglottic stenosis [21] . Finally, Waki et al. (1995) noted an association between gastoesophageal reflex disease (GERD) and recurrent croup [12] . Patients with GERD had shorter time periods between episodes of croup and younger age of presentation. Findings associated with GERD, including edema and erythema of the arytenoid and tracheal mucosa, were identified in 47% of children assessed for recurrent croup and 25% showed anatomical airway narrowing with direct laryngoscopy and bronchoscopy.",

Steroid administration was also discouraged with additional causes of atypical laryngitis including inflammatory processes, such as GERD and alternate viral processes, such as recurrent respiratory papillomatosis. Inglis Jr. (1993) proposed that prolonged use of corticosteroids resulted in susceptibility to herpetic croup and suggested that corticosteroid use be limited to 48 h [16] . Acyclovir was given following cessation of corticosteroid medication in their case report. Atypical croup often necessitated definitive airway management in the studies reviewed. Hatherill et al. (2001) reported that 9 out of 148 children (6%) admitted to the PICU for croup needed intubation with a median duration of 4 days [15] . Five children required tracheostomy to prevent mucosal damage secondary to the mechanical trauma. The clinical decision to proceed to tracheostomy was based on severe subglottic ulceration and narrowing such that a size 3.0 endotracheal tube could not be passed. Intubation was deemed necessary due to subglottic edema in HSV laryngitis reported by Chauhan [13] , [16] , [17] . Barnes et al. (1999) reported a case in which marsupialization of subglottic cysts lead to resolution of symptoms [21] .",

This case offers insight into the diagnostic challenges of atypical croup and highlights the role of surgical airway management in cases unresponsive to medical therapy. Typical croup syndromes are usually self-limited in nature and responsive to medical therapy [6] . In unusual cases of croup presentations, a different approach to diagnosis and management may be necessary. However, there is no commonly accepted definition of atypical croup. Thus, we performed a systematic review on atypical croup to identify definitions available in the literature. Furthermore, we sought to identify diagnostic approaches used to investigate these atypical presentations and reported management strategies.",

Our search revealed several infectious etiologies associated with atypical croup, the most common of which was HSV. This association may be linked to immunosuppressive effects of corticosteroid administration due to treatment of an initial typical croup presentation [13, 15, 16, 20] . In one immunosuppressed child, the fungus Curvularia was isolated [18] . This suggests that immune modulation plays a role in determining croup presentation and severity. Bacterial causes such as Staphylococcus and Chlamydiae species were also reported although distinctions made between bacterial tracheitis and atypical croup were unclear in those studies [15, 19] . Moreover, the clinical presentations reported varied in duration and severity. Prolonged duration was a defining factor in assigning the definition of atypical croup in several reports reviewed. Two studies outlined a time period of presentation beyond 7 days as atypical [16, 17] . However, several studies noted prolonged duration as a factor without specifying a specific period of time [15, [20] [21] [22] . Severity was defined very broadly or not at all in most studies, with the most common definition being PICU admission. In studies where mean or median ages were reported, age of presentation was often older than 3 years of age, with the oldest being 11 years of age, or younger than 6 months of age. No cases were reported beyond that lower boundary.",

Rather, it is a term most often used as catch-all diagnosis for presentations that lie outside the common definition of croup. Some studies have proposed more strict definitions of atypical croup, mostly based on recurrent presentations with consideration of age at presentation; however, there remains a gap in knowledge on the incidence of these atypical episodes [11] . This discordance suggests that it may be beneficial to present a broader definition of atypical croup. We therefore propose that atypical croup may be defined as a child who presents with croup that is either: a) severe, necessitating definitive airway management, b) prolonged, symptoms persisting for 7 or more days despite medical therapy, c) untimely, presenting at an age younger than 6 months or older than 6 years, d) associated with an atypical pathogen, or e) presenting with an airway lesion other than the classically described steeple sign on x-ray imaging. Several of these features were present in this case study, in particular symptoms refractory to maximal medical therapy, prolonged duration, a pseudotumour, and airway narrowing persisting for 6 months after initial presentation.",

We sought to clarify the patient characteristics that place children at risk of intubation or tracheostomy. In one review by O'Niel et al. (2013) of HSV laryngitis, 50% of patients required intubation [17] . The rate of intubation in other forms of atypical croup was not well studied. Furthermore, specific characteristics associated with intubation were not reported. However, Hatherill et al. (2001) described the decision to proceed with tracheostomy based on the prevention of further mucosal damage due to severe ulceration and subglottic narrowing from prolonged intubation [15] . The study noted that 5 children of the 263 reviewed required tracheostomy. In our case the decision to proceed with tracheostomy was based on persistence of airway narrowing following intubation. Overall tracheostomy was only reported in one of the twelve studies reviewed. Thus, other than herpetic croup, there remains a question of the risk factors and patient characteristics that may result in intubation and tracheostomy. Future investigation is warranted to clarify this issue. The atypical presentation of croup is a common problem faced by emergency physicians, pediatricians and otolaryngologists, and it provides several diagnostic and management challenges. Given the findings from our literature review, we propose a management pathway for atypical cases of croup. We reviewed the Canadian Pediatric Society Position Statement on the \"Acute management of croup in the emergency department\", the Seattle Children's Hospital Croup Pathway, and the \"Towards Optimized Practice (TOP) Guidelines on the Diagnosis and Management of Croup\" [24] [25] [26] . We then adapted our institutional croup pathway, and integrated recommendations from the practice guidelines listed and the conclusions from our literature review on atypical croup to formulate a pathway for atypical croup (Fig. 2 ).",

(2012) defined croup as atypical if a child had more than 4 recurrent episodes, howeverWaki et al. (1995) suggested 2 or more episodes necessitating inpatient care[11,12]. Several studies also noted an atypical age of presentation as part of their definition. Chauhan et al.(2007) defined an age of presentation less than 6 months as atypical while Cooper et al. (2012) added an upper limit of greater than 3 years of age [11,13]. Several authors included the severity of presentation and unresponsiveness to medical therapy as defining features. Farmer and Wohl (2001) defined severity based on the need for any inpatient admission while Hatherill et al. (2001) defined severity based on the need for PICU admission due to severe subglottic stenosis [14,15]. Furthermore, prolonged duration of symptoms was a common criterion listed in definitions of croup in the literature search. Inglis Jr. (1993) and O'Niel et al. (",
