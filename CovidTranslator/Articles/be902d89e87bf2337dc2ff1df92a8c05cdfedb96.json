However, the mechanisms by which viruses induce exacerbations of chronic airways disease are not well understood. In response to viral infection, the airway epithelium, and to a lesser extent immune cells such as monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells [4] [5] [6] [7] , release pro-inflammatory cytokines, interferons (IFNs), and antimicrobial substances, which in turn, promote clearance of microorganisms, and activation of the adaptive immune system. However, in patients with chronic respiratory illnesses, the innate immune response may also be responsible for disease exacerbation [8] .",

Increases in respiratory tract CXCL8/IL-8, CCL5/RANTES, CCL19/ MIP-1a, IL-10, CCL7/MCP-3, and CCL13/MCP-4 have been detected [15] [16] [17] [18] . To further examine the innate immune response to viral infection in children with asthma, we measured nasal aspirate cytokine levels in 16 asthmatic children before and after upper respiratory tract infections. In contrast to the previous studies, we examined at least three time points before and in association with symptomatic illness. We evaluated the associations between viral infection and cytokine expression, and between cytokine expression and symptom score. We also examined the effects of upper respiratory tract infection on mRNA levels of selected markers of viral infection, including IFNs. Finally, we evaluated a new method of virus detection using a single polymerase chain reaction-ligation detection reaction (PCR-LDR) multiplex assay. We hypothesized that respiratory viral infection of children with asthma causes robust elaboration of pro-inflammatory cytokines and IFNs, and that the level of pro-inflammatory cytokines correlates with symptom severity.",

Families were given a calendar and a simple respiratory symptom scale and asked to mark the level of their symptoms. We used a modified version of the respiratory symptom score developed by the Child Origins of Asthma Study [21] , which assessed fever, cough, nasal symptoms, wheezing, difficulty breathing, waking up at night with cough, and interference with usual activities. When the patient experienced a symptomatic respiratory illness, as defined by a symptom score of two or higher on a scale of 0-13, the family notified the study staff and scheduled a visit within 48 h of the beginning of symptoms (defined as day 1 of the illness). Information regarding impact of respiratory symptoms on daily activities and recent use of asthma medicines was also collected. As noted above, study technicians visited the home every 2-3 days to retrieve additional nasal washing samples, for a total of three visits during the week following reporting of symptoms. The three specific days of the week selected for analysis were based on the convenience of the subjects and laboratory technician. Although specimens were most often collected on days 1, 4, and 7 of a given week, specimen collection was sometimes compressed into a 5 or 6-day period.",

In general, samples were collected in the presence of study staff and were transported from homes to the laboratory within 3 h of collection in a cooler with ice packs. However, due to logistical issues scheduling home visits, families were also provided with kits for independent collection of nasal washings specimens at home. If a visit could not be scheduled within 48 h, families were instructed to collect the sample, double bag the sample, place in a tightly sealed collection box, and to keep it in the refrigerator until the staff could collect the sample.

            "text": "Our results expand upon prior work characterizing cytokine responses detectable in respiratory secretions of asthmatics in association with viral illnesses. Pizzichini et al. [15] found that, compared to 21 days after infection, sputum levels of CXCL8, eosinophil cationic protein and fibrinogen from six adult asthmatics were significantly elevated 4 days after the start of a coldinduced exacerbation. Furthermore, CXCL8 levels correlated with the number of sputum neutrophils. Teran et al. asthma [16] found that, compared to asymptomatic periods, levels of major basic protein, CCL5 and CCL19 were increased in the nasal aspirates of 26 children during acute viral-induced exacerbations. Grissell et al. asthma [17] found that compared to a group of stable asthmatics, levels of CCL5 and IL-10 were significantly elevated in the induced sputa of older children and adults suffering from acute viral-induced asthma exacerbations, along with neutrophils and eosinophils. CXCL8 and CCL19 were also increased, although not significantly. Finally, Santiago et al. [18] found that compared to control samples, CCL7 and CCL13 were increased in the nasal aspirates of asthmatic children 12 -24 h after upper respiratory tract infections. Chemokine levels correlated with macrophages in the nasal aspirate and upper respiratory symptoms scores. In the present study, in which patients were used as their own controls, we confirmed the above changes in CXCL8, CCL5, CCL19, and CCL7, and provide new data showing significant increases in CXCL10, CCL11, CCL2, and CCL4. Importantly, we found that increases in these chemokines were sustained throughout the week following viral infection. We also examined the relationship between cytokines and respiratory symptom score. Interestingly, we found that some cytokines correlated with symptom score (IFN-c, CXCL8, CCL5 , CCL20, CCL2, and CCL4) whereas others did not (CXCL10, CCL11, CCL19 or CCL7). Although we did not examine lower airway cytokine levels, it is tempting to speculate that the former set of cytokines is responsible for the acute asthmatic response to viral infection, whereas the latter set may modulate future immune responses. Based on differences in IFN-b and IFN-k production between cells isolated from controls and asthmatic subjects [31] [32] [33] , it has been proposed that patients with asthma are prone to rhinovirus-induced exacerbations due to deficient IFN production On the other hand, other in vitro studies showed no differences in rhinovirus-induced gene expression in epithelial cells isolated from asthmatic and healthy subjects [34, 35] , and con-trol and asthmatic subjects experimentally infected with rhinovirus show no difference in respiratory tract viral titre or copy number [14] . We found that viral infection during natural colds significantly increased the levels of IFN-c protein and IFN-k mRNA in the nasal aspirates. Viral infection also significantly increased the expression level of RIG-I and IRF-7, each of which are inducible by type I IFNs [36, 37] . Together, these data suggest that asthmatic children are capable of a functional IFN response. On the other hand, we failed to detect IFN-a or IFN-b protein in nasal aspirates, and there was no significant change in mRNA levels during natural colds. Detection of type I IFNs in respiratory secretions is made difficult by the low sensitivity of commercially available assays, physiologically low levels of these cytokines in biological fluids (particularly in fluids without sufficient numbers of plasmacytoid dendritic cells) and presence of natural inhibitors (e.g. soluble receptors). Also, we could not compare the results from our experimental subjects to children without asthma. Our finding that IRF7 mRNA is elevated after respiratory viral infection in children with asthma is validated by a recent study analysing patterns of gene expression in nasal lavage samples from children experiencing picornavirus-induced asthma exacerbations [38] . Consistent with our previous work examining the requirement of IRF7 for rhinovirus-induced gene expression in cultured airway epithelial cells [39] , coexpression analysis demonstrated IRF7 to be a major hub connecting IFN-mediated responses in virus-induced asthma exacerbations.",

First, although nasal sampling has the advantage of increased safety and decreased participant burden, sputum speci-mens more closely reflect the response of the lower airways to viral infection. However, as noted above, levels of IFN-c, CXCL8, CCL5, CCL20, CCL2, and CCL4 significantly correlated with respiratory symptoms, including lower respiratory tract symptoms such as cough, wheeze, chest tightness, and shortness of breath, each of which are indicative of asthma exacerbation. In addition, previous studies have found similar changes in nasal aspirate and sputum cytokine concentrations following viral exacerbations of asthma [16, 17] .

We did not adjust measurements by total protein content, as vascular leakage due to inflammation may alter protein concentrations in children with upper respiratory infections [51] .
