The acid production that accompanies rigor mortis in carcasses and meat inactivates the virus. However, the alteration in pH is not dependable and the virus survives in offal, viscera, lymph nodes, and bone marrow for an indefinite period under refrigeration. Next to the movement of infected animals, contaminated animal products are likely the most common mechanism of spread. It may survive on hay and other fomites for several weeks.",

The importance of a carrier state in the epidemiology of FMD is uncertain. The carrier state has been observed in cattle, sheep, goats, and African buffalo (Syncerus caffer), but not in pigs. The carrier state may persist for up to 2 years postinfection in cattle, even in animals with a significant level of serum-neutralizing antibody. Sheep and goats are considered to be a frequent inapparent source of dissemination of the virus.African buffalo can carry FMDV for at least 5 years. Field outbreaks have been associated with buffalo-cattle contact in Africa, but these appear to be rare. Although Asian water buffaloes (Bubalus arnee) may be affected in FMD outbreaks, it is not known whether they remain carriers.",

There are seven principal antigenic serotypes, namely, the classical A, O, and C types, and SAT-l, SAT-2, SAT-3, and Asia-1. These can be distinguished by serologic tests. Six of the seven serotypes (O,A, C, SAT-l, SAT-2, SAT-3) are known to occur in Africa, four (O,A, C, Asia 1) in Asia, and three (O,A, C) in Europe and South America, although recent pandemics are blurring these geographic distinctions. These serotypes are sufficiently different immunologically that infection with one type does not confer resistance to the other six. Within these seven major types there are antigenic subtypes, each different, to variable degrees, from the parent type. Generally, the subtypes cross-immunize to a useful degree, but exceptions do arise and become recognizable, especially when vaccination fails. Antigenic drift can also be demonstrated experimentally; new subtypes can be produced by passing the virus in immune or partially immune animals, or by growing the virus in vitro in the presence of immune serum.There are presently over 70 distinct antigenic strains of the virus of natural origin.",

Biting insects most likely become infected from feeding on lesions rather than blood, since viremia is transient, if present. Nonbiting insects act as mechanical carriers of the virus.

Clinically, the disease is characterized by lethargy, anorexia, mild oculonasal discharge, and occasional mild oral erosions and shallow ulcers. Diarrhea may occur. In dairy herds there is a transient drop in milk production. Affected animals develop neutralizing antibodies that peak in 10-12 weeks, and probably are immune for life.",

Sometimes termed \"BVD type 2,\" since it is caused mainly, though not exclusively, by primary infections with type 2 virus, this syndrome usually has a peracute to acute course, with fever, sudden death, diarrhea, or pneumonia. It should be noted that not all BVDV-2 isolates are highly virulent. In some cases a thrombocytopenic syndrome, characterized clinically by epistaxis, hyphema, mucosal hemorrhages, bleeding at injection sites, and bloody diarrhea, is superimposed on the alimentary syndrome caused by type 2 BVDV, or occurs independently. The pathogenesis of BVD type 2 is most frequently linked to increased strain virulence. However, production of inflammatory cytokines, in response to widespread infection ofmononuclear phagocytes, has also been postulated as a cause for the severe disease seen clinically. The mechanism of thrombocytopenia is not completely defined, although infected megakaryocytes in the bone marrow undergo necrosis.",

Microscopically, there is mild multifocal tracheitis, bronchitis and necrotizing bronchiolitis, and diffuse proliferative interstitial pneumonia, with formation of alveolar syncytial cells. Eosinophilic cytoplasmic and nuclear inclusions are present in the epithelial cells of the air passages, type II pneumocytes, and syncytial cells.

The blue, brindled, or white-bearded wildebeest (Connochaetes taurinus) carries AIHV-1. Wildebeest calves become infected during the first 2-3 months of life, when they are also viremic and shed cell-free AlHV-1 in nasal and ocular secretions. Most wildebeest older than 7 months are serologically positive for AlHV-1. In utero infections have also been reported.Wildebeest are infected for life and transmit A1HV-1 to their calves without showing clinical signs. Wildebeest calves are considered to be the main source of infection for cattle in East Africa. They may shed infective cell-free virus, in nasal and ocular secretions, for several days. Transmission to cattle may occur even without intimate contact, suggesting aerosol spread. Viremia apparently ceases with the development of active neutralizing antibodies in animals >6 months old. It may be reactivated during late pregnancy or periods of stress, e.g., transportation.Although AlHV-1 produces MCF in many captive exotic species of ruminants, apparently most species that are exposed in their native habitat do not develop disease. AlHV-1 has been transmitted and adapted to domestic rabbits, hamsters, rats, and guinea pigs, in which it produces MCF-like lesions.",

The mottling of liver and the focal nephritis seen grossly are due to the perivascular accumulation ofmononuclear cells in the portal triads of the liver ( Fig. 1.103 ) and in the cortices of the kidney. In the fiver, these cuffs may be very large and invest the branches of the hepatic artery, which may undergo fibrinoid necrosis. Microscopic lesions are frequently present in the kidneys, even though gross lesions are not; they consist of vasculitis involving the smaller arteries and afferent arterioles. Extensive diffuse lymphocytic infiltrates disrupt the normal renal cortical architecture, and in some cases, infarcts appear to be associated with vasculitis involving arcuate arteries.",

Peripheral blood mononuclear leukocytes may exhibit apoptosis in response to BoHV-1, but the significance of this is unknown. Experimental infection of calves with noncytopathic Bovine viral diarrhea virus (NCP-BVDV) followed by BoHV-1 inoculation results in dissemination of the latter to a variety of tissues. BVDV impairs cellmediated immunity, and this may allow BoHV-1 to escape from the respiratory tract and lead to a systemic infection.

In the former, inclusions were found predominantly in the lamina propria whereas in the latter they were mostly epithelial. Goat adenovirus (GAdV) serotypes 1 and 2 can cause enteritis and diarrhea in goat kids; GAdV-1 is a serotype of Ovine adenovirus D, which also includes serotype 7 and isolate 287.",

The serosal hemorrhages in the gastrointestinal tract and possibly the diarrhea may be related to vascular damage in the serosa and mucosa respectively (see Vol. 2, Liver and biliary system). CAdV-2 is usually associated with upper respiratory infections in dogs (see Vol. 2, Respiratory system). Viruses serologically similar to CAdV-2 have been isolated from feces of diarrheic dogs. DNA fingerprinting of two of these isolates indicated that they are distinct from CAdV-2.

Diarrhea may be produced in calves by rotaviral infection alone, but the condition is usually considered to be relatively mild or transient in comparison with that induced by enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli or Bovine cownavirus. Combinations of agents, including Rotavirus, are frequently involved in outbreaks of diarrhea in neonatal calves. Rotavirus may be implicated in animals developing signs at any time over the period up to about 2-3 weeks of age, and it is more commonly encountered in animals over 4-5 days of age. 1Kotaviral diarrhea is most severe in calves that have slower enterocyte regeneration times.",

LTI is antigenically similar to cholera toxin, while LTII toxins have B subunits that differ from LTI. The B subunits bind to ganglioside receptors on the enterocyte surface; the toxin complex then dissociates, and the A1 subunit is internalized into the cell. It operates via an adenylate cyclase pathway to cause chloride secretion by enterocytes, sodium, and water following osmotically from the mucosa. Co-transport of sodium chloride by enterocytes, and associated water uptake, is probably also shut down at the same time. LT may also promote mucosal secretion by stimulation of local prostaglandin production, the enteric nervous system, and cytokine activation. LT has a latent period prior to the development of secretion, but the effects on the cell are irreversible. Heat-stable toxin is classified as STa and STb based on biological properties, and is plasmid-encoded. STa causes an increase in cyclic guanosine monophosphate, which inhibits Na/C1 co-transport and therefore water absorption by surface enterocytes, while in crypt epithelium it promotes C1-and water secretion. STb, mainly produced by ETEC associated with pigs, may cause secretion by stimulation of prostaglandin E2 and 5-hydroxytryptamine production. In pigs, STb can cause exfoliation of surface enterocytes, resulting in mild atrophy of villi.",

Control of attaching-effacing activity resides in the locus for enterocyte effacement (LEE), a chromosomal pathogenicity island. EPEC have a complicated and sequential relationship with host cells. Long polar fimbriae may mediate initial bacterial interaction with the enterocyte. Secretion of bacterial proteins ensues, including intimin, which is an adhesin. A second protein, the translocated intimin receptor, is transported via a type III secretion system into the enterocyte cytoplasm, emerging on the cell membrane as the intimin receptor. In response to translocated EPEC proteins, the cell's cytoskeleton is reorganized, resulting in formation of cupped pedestal-like structures beneath the attached bacteria, and the subsequent loss of microvilli (Figs 1.119, 1.120, 1.131, and 1.132).

Shigatoxin 1 is structurally identical to the Shiga toxin produced by Shigella dysenteriae, which has a profound cytopathic effect. Due to their effect onVero cells in culture, these E. coli are also referred to as verotoxin-producing E. coli (VTEC). Shiga toxins, encoded in the genome of bacteriophages, are composed of an A subunit that has enzymatic activity and a B subunit that binds the toxin to the glycolipid receptor globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) on the cell surface. Once endocytosed and transferred via the Golgi apparatus to the rough endoplasmic reticulum, the toxin inhibits protein synthesis, which may be lethal to the target cell, and via separate mechanisms may induce apoptosis. The presence or absence of Gb3 on cell surfaces is a major determinant of the distribution of tissue susceptibility to Shiga toxins, which mainly affect intestinal epithelium and vascular endothelium.

Choleraesuis, require intact LPS or O-side chains.The lipid A portion of LPS is responsible for the endotoxin-mediated effects of Salmonella infection that are seen in systemic disease. Septicemia (endotoxemia) typically causes fever, leukopenia, hemoconcentration, lactic acidosis, coagulopathies, hypotension, and death. Diarrhea in salmonellosis is not mediated by enterotoxins such as those involved in cholera and E. coli infections. Rather, effector proteins associated with SPI-1 induce secretory diarrhea by blocking chloride channel closure, while others attract neutrophils, and induce apoptosis of enterocytes. Proteins encoded in SPI-5 also promote neutrophil recruitment and electrolyte secretion. Mucosal inflammation leads to the accumulation of a number of mediators, including prostaglandin E2, capable of causing hypersecretion of chloride by enterocytes, and consequent passive osmotic movement of water into the lumen. Loss of enterocytes, dying as a sequel to Salmonella invasion and neutrophil-induced tissue injury, results in a reduction in absorptive surface area, and causes defects in mucosal integrity, through which the protein-and neutrophil-rich exudate leaking from permeable vessels effuses.",

This capacity is conferred by components coded in SPI-2, perhaps largely through inhibition of NADPH oxidase-mediated oxidative killing of Salmonella in cytoplasmic vacuoles, and in some species by factors encoded in SPI-2 and SPI-3.The virulence of several serotypes commonly associated with systemic infections in animals, including S.

Other less frequent findings are caseous lymphadenitis of the mesenteric lymph nodes, interstitial pneumonia, hepatitis, and pericarditis. ",

Abortion of pregnant mares has been associated with S. Abortusequi. Salmonella Infantum has been associated with disseminated infection localizing in a variety of tissues, including muscle, in a horse. Treatment with antibiotics, especially orally, increases the risk of salmonellosis. Resistance to certain antibiotics is associated with the presence of resistance (R) plasmids that may be transferred to other bacteria, of the same or different species, by conjugation or transduction. Antibiotic-resistant Salmonella may not respond to treatment, and antimicrobial therapy may increase the potential for infection and disease, due to the suppression of the normal flora. Antibiotic-resistant strains have been associated with outbreaks of salmonellosis at veterinary teaching hospitals.",

They often attain the lamina propria, inhabiting inflammatory cells there, from which organisms ultimately reach the systemic circulation. Many human infections are acquired by drinking raw milk, or from other animal foodstut~, especially poultry products. Chickens are common asymptomatic shedders of C.jejuni; C. coli comes more commonly from swine. C. jejuni has been associated with diarrhea characterized by the presence of blood and mucus in some dogs, despite the fact that it can often be isolated from a high proportion of asymptomatic animals. It has also been isolated from dogs with parvoviral enteritis and other viral infections; pre-existing infections may predispose to the development of pathologic effects of C.jejuni. The role of Campylobacter as a significant primary pathogen in dogs has been demonstrated in a few cases.These usually involve communal housing situations and often young dogs. C. jejuni can be implicated as the cause of lymphoplasmacytic inflammation centered on ileum and colon by ruling out other known etiologies, and demonstrating the organism in large numbers in association with the lesion. Mild to moderate enteritis and colitis has been described in naturally infected dogs, while in experimentally infected gnotobiotic and conventional dogs, lesions are limited to mild mucosal colitis. Erosive colitis has been associated with C.jejuni infection in mink, and was reproduced experimentally.

The disease occurs as epizootics in affected herds and regions, and may then remain enzootic. Poor hygienic conditions, overcrowding, and antibiotic treatment are thought to be predisposing factors in some outbreaks.Affected animals pass bloodstained feces in the terminal stages and there is marked hyperemia of the anus just prior to death. The predominant lesions occur in the small intestine, especially the jejunum, but the cecum and spiral colon are often involved, and occasionally lesions are confined to the large intestine. Lesions are similar in all areas, and in acute cases consist of intestinal and mesenteric hyperemia, extensive necrosis of the intestinal mucosa, and blood-staining of the contents (Fig. 1.164 ). There may be emphysema of the intestinal wall, which becomes fragile. Mesenteric lymph nodes are red, and sanguineous peritoneal and pleural fluid is present. Fibrinous intestinal adhesions may develop. Microscopically, the necrotic process extends deeply and sometimes penetrates the muscularis mucosae. Numerous typical bacilli line up along the margin of involved villi and inhabit the necrotic tissue. Older pigs may not show intestinal hemorrhage but do have mucosal necrosis, and peritoneal and pericardial effusion. The disease due to C. pe~ingens type C in foals has been reported from the USA, Canada, and Australia. It usually occurs in foals <4 days of age. Typical clinical signs include weakness, yellow to brown watery diarrhea or dysentery, colic, and dehydration. Affected foals usually die in <24 hours. Macroscopic lesions are those of acute hemorrhagic necrotizing enteritis, usually in the distal two-thiMs of the small intestine, although in some cases most of the small and large intestine may be affected. The microscopic lesions are similar to those described previously in the other species. In foals, the lesions must be differentiated from those seen with other clostridia. ",

The principal macroscopic lesions in the acute and chronic disease are mild to severe hyperemia of the mucosa, especially of the distal small intestine, cecum, and spiral colon.The affected areas may be covered by a thin layer of fibrin. The intestinal contents are olive-green to red and mucoid.The mesenteric lymph nodes are enlarged and edematous. Hydropericardium, pulmonary edema, and \"pulpy\" kidneys may be seen, but are inconsistent, and brain lesions are absent. In natural cases, the microscopic lesions in the small intestine vary from a mild pleocellular leukocytic reaction in the lamina propria to a mild fibrinous, or, rarely, hemorrhagic enteritis. In the latter, the tips of the villi are necrotic, eroded, and covered by fibrinocellular exudates or blood.Villus atrophy may follow. The leukocytic reaction in the lamina propria extends into the edematous submucosa. The proprial and submucosal vessels are congested. EssentiaUy similar lesions occur in the large intestine, bearing in mind the anatomic differences. There is lymphocytolysis in the centers of the lymphoid follicles of the mesenteric lymph nodes. Lesions in the lungs and kidneys may be similar to, but are less consistent than, those seen in lambs. Cerebral edema may be present, but FSE has not been reported in goats with enterotoxemia, except after experimentally induced disease.",

However, in some clinical cases, especially the paucibacillary form in sheep, an extensive search may have to be made for individual macrophages or giant cells bearing a few acid-fast bacilli. Johne's disease in sheep, and especially in goats and deer, may resemble tuberculosis, on account of caseation and mineralization in granulomatous loci, and for such cases, and in any other situation where there is uncertainty about the acid-fast organism involved, positive identification of the etiologic agent is necessary. Antibodies with well-defined specificity for M. a. paratuberculosis have allowed the development ofimmunohistochemical tests, but these are not helpful when there are very few organisms. Polymerase chain reaction techniques are useful for confirming the diagnosis in individual cases. For isolation, the ileocecal lymph node, and affected segments of gut, are candidate sites for culture to confirm a diagnosis. Isolation may be difficult to accomplish, especially from sheep. where disease due to R. equi is endemic, there is a much higher proportion of virulent forms.Virulence factors may not be necessary for production of disease in an immunocompromised host. R. equi is usually associated with suppurative bronchopneumonia of foals. About half the pneumonic foals also have ulcerative colitis, and in some foals intestinal lesions alone occur. The development of intestinal lesions appears to be dose-related, in that reproduction of the disease requires repeated oral infection. In natural disease, continual exposure to bacteria in swallowed respiratory exudate is probably an important source of infection in those animals with pneumonia.",

The presence of fungal hyphae in mesenteric lymph node granulomas of many clinically normal cattle indicates that, contrary to general impressions, invasion by these ag, ents across the intestinal mucosa does not lead invariably to systemic disease. Fungi may produce a localized granulomatous lesion in specialized lymphoid tissue of the Peyer's patch or may be carried to the regional lymph node, while the mucosal lesion, if any, heals. In the lymph nodes, a granulomatous response, with giant cells that contain hyphal fragments, often develops; asteroid bodies may form around Aspergillus spp. Usually the granulomatous lesions produce little or moderate enlargement of lymph nodes, but sometimes a massive, caseating lymphadenitis results, with adhesions to adjacent structures. Pythiosis (oomycosis), caused by the aquatic oomycete Pythium insidiosum, occurs most commonly in tropical and subtropical areas, but on occasion can be found in more temperate climates. It is best recognized as a cause of cutaneous lesions in horses (seeVol. 1, Skin and appendages). However, it causes enteric disease in dogs, and, less commonly, horses. There is segmental thickening and ulceration of the stomach and small intestine, with transmural granulomatous inflammation, and sometimes granulomatous peritonitis, with adhesions of the omentum. Obstruction may occur. Lymphovascular channels on the intestinal serosa are thickened, and the mesenteric lymph nodes are greatly enlarged and frequently embedded in a granulomatous mass. Small firm or caseous yellow loci, known as \"leeches\" or\"kunkers,\" may be embedded in the firm fibrotic reactive tissue. Segments of bowel may be infarcted. Granulomatous inflammation is evident in the mucosa, and especially the submucosa; it extends along lymphatics transmurally. Granulomas, with a local mixed inflammatory infiltrate, often including eosinophils, may have liquefactive or caseous necrotic centers.

Disseminated histoplasmosis is a disease predominantly of young dogs that are usually presented with weight loss, generalized lymphadenopathy, and often diarrhea with blood, and tenesmus. Intestinal histoplasmosis is reported as part of disseminated disease in cats, and as an isolated lesion in a horse. At postmortem there may be hemorrhagic enteritis involving small and large intestine, or granulomatous thickening of the mucosa and intestinal wall with ulceration ( Fig. 1.176) , or no apparent lesions. Mesenteric lymph nodes are often markedly enlarged. Histologically, lesions, characteristically transmural granulomatous inflammation, may occur in stomach and small or large intestine. The nonulcerated areas of the mucosa contain focal to diffuse infiltrations of macrophages laden with H. capsulatum organisms within cytoplasmic vacuoles.The mucosa may be grossly thickened by the infiltrate, causing necrosis and ulceration. The cellular reaction may extend through the muscularis to the serosa. Macrophages filled with organisms are particularly prominent in the lymphoid tissue of the gut and the mesenteric nodes.

This may cause malabsorption of nutrients, electrolytes, and water. But probably more important is the loss of endogenous protein into the gut, mainly related to chronic mucosal inflammation. In hea W infestations with Trichuris spp., erosion results in loss of absorptive function, and effusion of tissue fluids, or, in severe cases, hemorrhagic exudate. 4. The fourth group causes physical trauma to the intestinal wall by burrowing into or inciting inflammatory foci in the submucosa or deeper layers. In the stomach, various species of spirurids embed in the mucosa, or establish in cystic spaces in the submucosa. In the intestine, acanthocephala cause local ulceration by their thorny hold-fast organ; larval stages of equine cyathostomes and Oesophagostomum spp. become encapsulated in the submucosa. Protein loss may occur from ulcerated areas, or when larvae emerge from the submucosa. The potential exists for perforation of the stomach or bowel, or for complications due to sepsis of submucosal nodules. Adhesion of inflamed serosal surfaces associated with nodules or perforations may impair motility. 5. Finally, some intestinal helminths, among them a few in the categories above, have effects at sites distant from the gut.

In cattle with O. ostertagi (Fig. 1.177A) , only glands infected with larvae undergo significant mucous change until about the time larvae leave the glands for the surface of the mucosa (Fig. 1.177B ). Mucous change then becomes more widespread, involving uninfected glands in the vicinity of those that contained larvae. In both species, affected glands are lined by mucous neck cells that proliferate, displacing parietal cells. Affected areas of mucosa thicken. In infected glands, in many cases the lining is flattened adjacent to worms (Fig. 1.177C ), but is composed of tall columnar mucous cells elsewhere in the gland. The undifferentiated mucous cells lining uninfected glands also eventually differentiate into tall columnar mucous cells. If infection is not heavy, lesions are limited to a radius of a few millimeters around infected or previously infected glands. These form raised nodular pale areas in the mucosa, often with a slightly depressed center.

            "text": "Coccidiosis is typically a disease of intensively managed animals. It is especially important in naive young animals exposed to a high level of infection. This is predisposed by high contamination rates associated with crowding, yarding, or high stocking rates on pasture. A damp substrate promotes oocyst sporulation and survival, and practices such as feeding on the ground, or the natural propensity of young animals to nibble or perhaps indulge in coprophagy, may promote infection. Although infections may not proceed to patency, chronic ingestion of oocysts may cause an intestinal immune response, villus atrophy, and perhaps ill-thrift, in some situations. Immune reactions may only halt development of, but not kill, endogenous asexual stages. Epizootiologic evidence suggests that under some circumstances there may be relaxation of resistance and resumption of development of the organisms, ultimately expressed in disease.This seems the likely explanation for outbreaks of bovine coccidiosis occurring during midwinter in freezing climates, or in postparturient stabled dairy cattle. and it usually comprises several species. Almost half the calves and yearlings in confinement operations shed oocysts, with calves shedding high numbers, while a much smaller proportion of cows shed low numbers of oocysts.",

In one survey of foals in Germany, it was found in 100%. It may also occur in older animals. Its reputation for pathogenicity rests largely on the distinctive large gamonts found by pathologists in the lamina propria of the small intestine in animals dead of obscure enteric disease. However, implication of E. leuckarti in the disease process is rarely, if ever, convincing, and it is encountered incidentally in the intestine of horses dead of other clearly defined conditions. Furthermore, heavy experimental inoculations, producing many gamonts in the gut and heavy oocyst passage, have failed to elicit clinical signs. The stages present in the lamina propria of villi are giant microgametocytes and macrogametes, developing in markedly hypertrophic host cells, probably of epithelial origin (Fig. 1.201) . The microgametocvtes are uD to ---250 lxm in diameter, and when mature thev contain swirling masses of microgametes. Immature microgametocytes very much resemble some of the giant schizonts of other species of coccidia, and have frequently been referred to as such; this stimulated the application of the term Globidium to the organism. However, the only schizont containing merozoites that has been recognized in horses was very small (12.5 txm in diameter), and in the epithelium of the ileum. The macrogametes have distinctive large eosinophilic or Schiff-positive granules that may be individual or confluent. The host cells are markedly hypertrophic with a fibrillar periphery, and the enlarged nucleus forms a crescent along one side of the parasitophorous vacuole.There is no inflammatory response to the gamonts, and only a mild reaction to degenerate stages in the lamina propria.

Heavier inocula, within limits, produce more cellular damage and villus atrophy; fibrinonecrotic enteritis indicates ingestion of a large dose of oocysts. However, severe lesions may not be associated with heavy shedding of oocysts, since relatively few gamonts are able to develop in the reduced population of epithelial cells remaining on villi.The severity of lesions and signs is much greater in piglets a few days old in comparison with those 2 weeks of age.This partly relates to the lower rate of replication of epithelium in the crypts of young piglets, and therefore the development of more severe villus atrophy. The smaller size of young piglets also makes them more susceptible to the effects of malabsorption and diarrhea. Animals previously exposed to L suis have relatively strong resistance to challenge. A diagnosis of coccidiosis must be considered in scouring neonatal piglets, and is strongly suggested by the presence offibrinonecrotic enteritis in the distal small bowel.Atrophy of villi may be recognized at autopsy using a hand lens or stereomicroscope, or in tissue section. Asexual or sexual stages may be found in smears of mucosal scrapings. The distinctive binucleate type I meronts and pairs of large (12-18 p~m in smears, 8-13 I~m in sections) type I merozoites may be found in jejunal mucosa in the early phase of diarrheal disease. Multinucleate type II meronts and numerous small type II merozoites are the predominant stage during the clinical phase of disease.

Although villus atrophy may occur in humans with giardiosis, this mainly occurs in a subgroup of patients with hypogammaglobulinemia. Marked histologic abnormality is not found in many cases of giardiosis in humans, and this also seems to be true for dogs, cats, and calves. In experimental murine giardiosis, infection is associated with hypertrophy of crypts and increased production of cells, combined with an increased rate of movement of enterocytes along villi, with an increased crypt:villus ratio. Deficiencies in brush border form and function may be attributable to incomplete differentiation of enterocytes in this circumstance, or perhaps to damage mediated by mucosal T cells. Intraepithelial lymphocytes are common in infected intestine, and altered epithelial kinetics may be related to cell-mediated immune reactions in the mucosa.Atrophy of villi has been associated with restoration of cell-mediated immune competence in Giardiainfected athymic mice, reinforcing the notion that immune phenomena may be involved in the pathogenesis of giardiosis.",

            "text": "Subsequent to ingestion, the organisms invade through the intestinal epithelium or M cells overlying Peyer's patches and attain the lamina propria or submucosal lymphoid follicles. Enormous recruitment of neutrophils and ensuing destruction of cytoarchitecture of the Peyer's patch and overlying epithelium result in formation of suppurative loci in place of follicles in Peyer's patches, and microabscesses in the lamina propria of the small or large intestine if invasion occurs elsewhere. Yersinia disseminates via lymphatics and hepatic portal venous drainage to mesenteric lymph nodes or to liver and the systemic circulation.A number of virulence factors are recognized; all are related to the ability to invade cells or to evade the inflammatory response. These include expression of an adhesin termed invasin, which binds to beta-1 integrins expressed on the surface of intestinal M cells, promoting uptake of Yersinia by these and normally nonphagocytic cells, and causing epithelial cells to produce cytokines chemotactic for inflammatory phagocytes.A plasmid-encoded type III secretion system translocates effector proteins termed \"yops\" from bacteria into host cells. These enable invasive Yersinia to remain extracellular, evading phagocytosis and killing by neutrophils and macrophages by a variety of mechanisms.Although Yersinia reside extracellularly as microcolonies in suppurative loci in the lamina propria and lymph nodes, at least some appear to reside intracellularly, since a Tcell-mediated immune response is required to clear infection. Giant cells wall off loci of infection in subacute to chronic lesions, hence the specific name pseudotuberculosis.Infectious and parasitic diseases of the atimentary tract",

Curr Top IVlicrobiot Immuno[ 1990;162:119-141. Papular stomatitis of cattle occurs worldwide. It is generally an insignificant infection, but needs to be differentiated from other more serious diseases affecting the oral cavity and skin. It is caused by Bovine papular stomatitis virus (BPSV), a member of the family Poxviridae, genus Parapoxvirus, that is closely related to Pseudocowpox virus that causes pseudocowpox in cattle and milker's nodules in humans. It is morphologically similar to, and shares antigens with, O~ virus of sheep and goats (see Vol. 1, Skin and appendages). However, analysis of the genome indicates that these viruses are distinct.",

Swine dysentery can be reproduced by feeding pure cultures of B. hyodysenteriae to specific-pathogen-free and conventionally reared swine. Experimental reproduction of the disease in gnotobiotic pigs requires the presence of anaerobic bacteria indigenous to the normal colon, along with B. hyodysenteriae. There is apparently a synergistic action between the spirochete and other anaerobes, mainly Bacteroides and Fusobacterium. Several studies have documented the importance of a diet low in fiber and high in rapidly fermentable carbohydrates for the successful establishment and pathogenicity of B. hyodysenteriae. The pathogenesis of swine dysentery is still incompletely understood. The only virulence factor consistently associated with B. hyodysenteriae colonizes the mucus on the mucosal surface, in the lumen of colonic glands, and in goblet cells. Lesions, including exfoliation of surface epithelium, are associated with the presence of large numbers of spirochetes and other anaerobic bacteria on the mucosa. By in situ hybridization, large numbers of B. hyodysenteriae can be seen colonizing the mucus layer, the surface epithelium, and the crypts.",

Vet Parasito[ 1997:73: Carnivores Dogs may be parasitized by DiphyUobothrium spp., as may be humans, cats, swine, and many other fish-eating mammals. The adults can be large, attaining lengths of up to 12-15 meters in humans, though those in animals tend to be shorter. The worm is \"--2 cm across, and marked centrally by the uterus containing dark eggs, which are operculate. Intermediate stages occur in copepods and fish.The adult worm matures in the intestine ofpiscivorous mammals. Infection by Diphyllobothrium spp. is rarely, if ever, associated with clinical disease in animals. Spirometra species are, like Diphytlobothrium, members of the subclass Cotyloda, and their life cycle is similar. The taxonomy of the genus is difficult, but among recognized species are S. mansonoides, infecting dogs, cats, and raccoons in North and South America, S. mansoni in dogs and cats in East Asia and South America, and S. erinacei found in cats and dogs in Australia and the Far East. Prospective hosts must have the opportunity for predation, since they are infected by the plerocercoid or \"sparganum\" found in the body cavity of the second intermediate host, usually an amphibian or reptile, or in another transport host. Spargana can also occur in carnivores, swine, or even humans, if the procercoid in the first intermediate host, the Cyclops, is ingested, usually while drinking. Spargana are white, ribbon-like, but otherwise structureless worms up to several centimeters long.They may be found free or encysted in a thin, noninflammatory fibrous capsule, in the peritoneal cavity and intermuscular or subcutaneous tissue. A chronic inflammatory reaction may occur about dead spargana. The adult worms are nonpathogenic. Plerocercoids are of significance in humans, where they migrate mainly in subcutaneous tissues. Mesocestoides spp. occasionally infect dogs, as well as other mammals and some birds, in North America, Europe, Asia, and Africa. These members of the subclass Eucestoda have a life cycle involving an insect or mite, and a vertebrate as second intermediate host. In the latter, infective tetrathyridia, \"-\" 1-2 cm long, flat, narrow, and bearing an invaginated scolex with four suckers, are found in the body cavities, liver, and lung. Tetrathyridia have the capacity for asexual multiplication, resulting in massive infections of intermediate hosts such as amphibia and reptiles, as well as dogs, cats, and other mammals. In the intestine of definitive hosts, Mesocestoides adults may also replicate asexually, and heavy infections may occur as a result of this, or from the consumption of large numbers of tetrathyridia in an intermediate host. Animals infected with intestinal Mesocestoides may develop diarrhea.Tetrathyridia replicating in the intestine of the dog may also penetrate the gut wall, and proliferate in the peritoneal cavity. Tetrathyridia in the abdominal cavity of dogs and cats may cause peritoneal effusion (parasitic ascites), perhaps with the development of pyogranulomatous peritonitis and adhesions. Tetrathyridia 1-2 mm in diameter are scattered in the thick creamy exudate, along with similarly-sized \"white bodies\" comprised of necrotic parasite and host cellular debris. Mild infections may be discovered incidentally at necropsy. Mesocestoides infection of the abdominal cavity must be differentiated from peritoneal infections by cysticerci of several Taenia spp., which occur very rarely in carnivores. caninum occurs in the dog, cat, fox, and, occasionally, children. It is ubiquitous. The narrow worms, up to 0.5 meters long, have distinctive cucumber-seed-like segments, and are often encountered incidentally in the small intestine at autopsy. They are of no pathologic significance. Cysticercoids develop in fleas and perhaps in the dog louse Trichodectes canis. Infection in the normal definitive hosts, or in accidental ones such as humans, is by ingestion of fleas containing cysticercoids. Taeniid cestodes are the most important tapeworms in domestic animals, not because of the effects of the adult worm in the carnivorous definitive host, but rather due to the metacestodes, or larval forms, in intermediate hosts. Single oncospheres hatch from the egg in the upper small intestine, penetrate the epithelium, and are carried in the portal blood to the liver. Some species of metacestodes migrate in the liver, eventually to enter the peritoneal cavity. Others persist to develop in the liver, while still others pass on to the heart, lungs, and systemic circulation, establishing in muscle or a variety of other sites and tissues. Metacestodes may occasionally be found in organs other than the site of predilection.Taeniid metacestodes assume four basic forms. The cysticercus is a fluid-filled, thin-walled, but muscular cyst, into which the scolex and neck of a single larval tapeworm are invaginated. The strobilicercus is a modification of this theme; late in larval development the scolex evaginates and is connected to the terminal bladder by a segmented strobila, so that it resembles a tapeworm, several centimeters long. The coenurus is a single or loculated fluid-filled cyst, in which up to several hundred nodular invaginated scolices are present in clusters on the inner wall. Each scolex is capable of developing into a single adult cestode in the intestine of the definitive host. The hydatid cyst is a uni-or multilocular structure, on the inner germinal membrane of which brood capsules develop. Within the brood capsules, invaginated protoscolices form. Brood capsules may float free in the cyst fluid, where they are termed \"hydatid sand.\" Internal daughter cysts can develop. Release of brood capsules or protoscolices into tissues, as a result of rupture of the hydatid cyst, may lead to development of new cysts. The alveolar hydatid cyst proliferates by budding externally.",

Infection may be maintained in lines of cattle in this manner, while some subclinically infected bitches have given birth to successive litters of pups that became affected within the first few months of life.Transmission may also occur by ingestion of infected tissue, as in toxoplasmosis.Dogs of all ages may be affected, but disease seems most characteristic as encephalomyelitis, polyradiculoneuritis, and polymyositis in puppies over \"-5 weeks of age, and perhaps involving several animals in a litter.

In adult dogs, there are signs of widespread involvement of the central nervous system, and disseminated disease may be evident, with polymyositis, myocarditis, and dermatitis associated with parasite infection.Though disease may be precipitated or exacerbated by glucocorticoid administration, Neospora is regarded as a primary pathogen. Circulating levels of T-interferon may be related to immune resistance.In acute systemic infections there may be hepatic enlargement with coalescing areas of pallor, related to widespread necrosis ofhepatocytes; streaky pallor of muscles due to myonecrosis, mineralization, and nonsuppurative myositis; and pulmonary congestion and edema, due to subacute alveolitis.Tachyzoites are common in affected tissues.Nonsuppurative encephalomyelitis is associated with the presence of tachyzoites and tissue cysts in neurons and neuropil; the Infectious and parasitic diseases of the atimentary tract degree of necrosis, gliosis, neovascularization, and demyelination presumably depends to some extent on the duration of the lesion.Retinitis is also reported in association with Neospora, as is pyogranulomatous ulcerative dermatitis, occasionally.In ruminant abortion, Neospora may be associated with necrotizing placentitis, and with myositis and nonsuppurative encephalomyelitis of the fetus after about 90 days' gestation.While a well-documented etiologic agent of abortion in cattle, the extent of natural Neosporainduced abortions in sheep and goats is unknown. Experimentally, sheep and pigs experience placental infection and necrotizing encephalitis in the fetuses. N. caninum has also been reported from a case of equine protozoal myelitis.Tachyzoites are approximately ovoid, \"--'5-7 txm long, and are found in small groups or large clusters, free in the cytoplasm or in parasitophorous vacuoles in many types of cells throughout the body. Tissue cysts are found in only the brain and spinal cord. They are spherical or slightly elongate, up to ---110 txm in greatest dimension. The cyst wall is \"~ 1-4 txm thick, usually greater than the width of the bradyzoites, which are slender (1.5 X 7 txm), slightly curved, with an obvious nucleus; they stain weakly periodic acid-Schiff-positive.Neospora must be distinguished from Toxoplasma in all species, and from Sarcocystis in aborted fetuses. Neospora tachyzoites resemble those of Toxoplasma in tissue section. Ultrastructurally, Neospora tachyzoites have over 11 rhoptries, whereas there are few in Toxoplasma. Toxoplasma is always found in a membrane-bound vacuole in the cytoplasm; Neospora tachyzoites are often not within a parasitophorous vacuole. Neospora tissue cysts are relatively uncommonly encountered, especially in acute cases. They are distinguished from Toxoplasma by the thicker wall (thinner than 0.5 Ixm in Toxoplasma). Perhaps the most common method of distinction is by immunohistochemistry using specific antibodies, while polymerase chain reaction is also useful. Sarcocystis meronts divide by endopolygony in endothelium in domestic animals; they are not in a parasitophorous vacuole; and merozoites lack rhoptries. Sarcocysts in muscle cells are within a parasitophorous vacuole; they have a distinct wall; and they are usually subdivided internally by septa. ",

            "text": "Sarcocystis is comprised of about 200 obligatorily heteroxenous species. Inconspicuous sexual stages occur in the epithelium at the tips of villi in the small intestine, and oocysts sporulate in the subepithelial lamina propria, producing two sporocysts within a thin oocyst wall. Sporocysts containing four sporozoites are shed in feces.These are infective to intermediate hosts, in which three generations of merogony occur in vascular endothelium, and a final cyst containing first metrocytes (mother cells), which produce mewzoites (bradyzoites), is formed in myocytes and occasionally other cells. Ingestion of tissue cysts containing bradyzoites initiates gametogony in the definitive host. There is apparently no resistance to the development of gamonts, and no disease is associated with them in the definitive host.Many species of Sarcocystis are recognized, based on prey-predator cycles. Sporogony of a given species usually occurs in only one or a few genera of carnivores. However, studies have shown that unaffected muscle often harbors more of these organisms than the inflamed portions. Sarcocystis infection in cattle (S. cruzi), sheep (S. tenella), and swine (S. miescheriana), and, experimentally, in goats (S. capracanis), may cause acute fatal disease characterized by anemia and widespread hemorrhage, which is associated with clotting disorders.As the disease progresses, cattle may develop inappetence, weight loss, reduced milk yield, hyperexcitability, hair loss, and in some animals, nervous signs. Illthrift associated with Sarcocystis infection may also occur in other species. Both syndromes are initiated during the endothelial phase of the infection. As well, abortion occurs during this phase in some species.Abortion associated with the acute disease is the result of the systemic illness, and the fetus is usually not infected. However, in cattle, some abortions, seen in otherwise clinically normal animals, are associated with meronts of Sarcocystis in the placenta and in vascular endothelium of the fetus, especially in the brain, and with nonsuppurative encephalitis. Encephalitis is occasionally associated with Sarcocystis infection in sheep, and in horses S. neurona is the cause of protozoal myeloencephalitis. Details of these syndromes are discussed in Vol. 1, Muscle and tendon; Vol. 3, Female genital system; and Vol. 1, Nervous system.",

            "text": "Entamoeba histolytica is the cause of amebiasis in humans, nonhuman primates, and, rarely, in other species, including dogs and cattle; cats are susceptible to experimental infection. Infection in dogs is sporadic, probably acquired by exposure to cysts in feces from infected humans. Dogs tend not to pass encysted amebae; hence it has been suggested that they present little public health hazard, and are unlikely to support spread from dog to dog. However, under some circumstances, cysts may be shed, and fecal material containing motile trophozoites has been used to transmit infection orally to other dogs.Amebae are usually nonpathogenic inhabitants of the lumen of the large bowel, but sometimes they cause colitis. The diet and immune status of the host, and virulence attributes of various strains of the organism, seem to influence pathogenicity. Adhesion to mucus by specific lectins, enzymatic degradation of mucus, and lectin-mediated adherence of amebae to host epithelium, are essential steps leading to tissue damage. Cysteine proteinases produced by E. histolytica contribute to epithelial cell damage and to induction of inflammation, both of which are involved in initiation of mucosal lesions. Cytolysis is induced by in-contact amebae.Amebiasis in dogs is associated with diarrheic or mucoid feces, perhaps with some blood, or with dysentery. Erosive mucosal colitis or ulcerative colitis occurs in dogs with amebiasis, and disease seems more common or severe in animals with concomitant Trichuris or Ancylostoma infection.Early lesions in human amebiasis seem to be diffuse acute mucosal colitis, with focal erosions or ulcerations.Amebae, though scarce, may be found in mucus on the colonic surface, but are most numerous in the fibrinocellular exudate over erosions or superficial ulcers. Ulcers advance as an area of necrosis and predominantly neutrophilic infiltrate, causing loss of glands, and extending for the full depth of the mucosa. Initial lesions consist of tiny erosions of the surface epithelium that evolve to deeper, more extensive ulcers. Established ulcerative amebic colitis classically has a flask-shaped ulcer, the narrow neck through the mucosa, and the broad base in the submucosa. There amebae, and necrosis, expand laterally, apparently less constrained by the architecture of the tissue. Intestinal perforations and intramural abscesses may form.Amebae may be present, commonly in small clusters, in necrotic debris or in adjacent viable tissue, frequently not involved in an inflammatory reaction. Amebae in tissue, often surrounded by a clear halo, may be spherical or irregular, with extended pseudopodia, and are \"6-50 Ixm in diameter.The nucleus has a central dense karyosome and peripheral chromatin clumps. The cytoplasm may appear foamy, can contain remnants of erythrocytes in phagolysosomes, and contains glycogen, which makes the cytoplasm periodic acid-Schiff-positive.The lesions of established amebiasis in the colon of dogs resemble those in humans; the early lesions may as well.Although dissemination of amebae, with abscessation in other organs, especially liver, lung, and brain, is a relatively common complication in humans, it seems rare in dogs. One such case occurred in an animal with canine distemper. ",

            "text": "Giardia spp. are flagellate protists that inhabit the small intestine of a wide range of vertebrates. The taxonomy of the genus is difficult. It appears that four or five morphologically distinct \"species\" exist, each with a relatively wide host range within amphibians, birds, rodents, and other mammals. Giardia duodenalis (--G. lamblia) infection is common in humans, and it also occurs in a wide array of mammals. Molecular genetic investigations have identified at least seven genotypes within G. duodenalis, several of which (assemblages A,B) infect humans. Hoofed animals are infected by assemblages A and E, the former being potentially zoonotic, dogs by assemblage C, and cats by assemblage F. Giardia infection has been associated with disease, with various degrees of credibility, in most of these hosts.Giardia trophozoites are pyriform in outline, ---10-20 Izm long by 5-15 Ixm wide and 2-4 txm thick, and convex on the dorsal surface. The concave ventral surface is modified by the presence of a Peritoneum and retroperitoneum of pyriform or crescent-shaped organisms, about 5 X 7 txm in size, with a faint nucleus and eosinophilic cytoplasm, applied to the surface epithelium, or in the lumen of colonic glands, usually in large numbers. However, the organisms are present in only a little over half the sections examined from infected cats, and multiple samples may be necessary in order to have a high probability of detecting them. In some cases, trichomonads appear to disrupt the epithelium, attaining the subepithelial lamina propria around crypts, or they are associated with ulceration and loci of necrosis and pyogranulomatous inflammation that are distributed transmurally in affected areas of colon, and in draining lymph nodes.",

B. coil occurs in the large bowel of swine, humans, and nonhuman primates. It is very common in pigs, and many infected humans live in close contact with swine. It has also been reported from several dogs with access to swine yards, as a complication of trichurosis.Balantidium is normally present as a commensal in the lumen of the cecum and colon, but is capable of opportunistic invasion of tissues injured by other diseases. On rare occasions, it may be a primary pathogen. In swine, where the organisms are most commonly encountered by veterinary pathologists, Balantidium may be found at the leading edge of the crateriform necrotizing or ulcerative lesions of the large intestine that develop secondary to intestinal adenomatosis ( Fig. 1.208 ), swine dysentery, or perhaps salmonellosis. Balantidium is recognized in tissue by large size, ovoid shape, the dense curved or kidney-shaped macronucleus, and the presence of cilia (which may be accentuated by silver stains) in rows on the surface.

The peritoneal cavity is incompletely divided into compartments by the mesentery, omenturn, and ligaments covered by the peritoneum. Its surface area is greater than that of the skin. The normal peritoneum is a smooth, shiny membrane that is semipermeable to the movement of water and small solute molecules. There is normally just enough fluid present in the cavity to keep it moist. Peritoneal fluid is clear and watery, but in neonatal pigs and lambs, fluid may contain strands of mucinous coagulum lying on the intact serosal surfaces of abdominal viscera. Normal peritoneal fluid is in osmotic equilibrium with plasma, but does not contain fibrinogen or other high-molecular-weight proteins, and generally does not clot, except in pigs. The peritoneal cavity has a dynamic circulation driven by intestinal motility and respiratory excursions, which can disperse fluid (and particles) completely throughout the abdominal and pelvic cavities within minutes to hours.During organogenesis, the coelomic cavity develops and becomes partitioned into pleural, pericardial, and peritoneal cavities.
