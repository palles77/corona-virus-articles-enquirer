The titres of virus in the medium increased logarithmically until 12--14 hours after inoculation reaching the maximum 14--16 hours after inoculation (Fig. 1 Variations in the pH of media between pH 6.0 and 9.0 maintained by HEPES buffer produced marked effects on the growth of IBV ( Fig. 2a---b) , pl4 values outside this range tended to cause early death even in control cells. The onset of virus growth and rate of release of infective virus was directly related to pH between pH 6.0--8.0,at pH 9.0 titres tended to be slightly lower than at pig 8.0. At pH 8,0 the :maximum titre of released virus (I06.s PFU)/ml) was obtained between 10--15 hours after inoculation but fell off rapidly after this time. At acid pH similar maximum titres were only achieved 20--30 hours after inoculation. More noticeable was the maintenance of released virus titres at pH 6.0 or 6.5. By 49 hours after inoculation virus grown at pt{ 8.0 had fallen in titre from 10 ms to 101.s PFU/ml whereas the drop in titre at pH 6.0 was from the maximum, i06.6s PFU/ml (at 30 hours alter inoculation) to 10 ~.~2 at 49 hours post inoculation.

Ceils maintained at the same pH values following the one hour adsorption period produced relatively constant yields at 20 hours post inoculation regardless of the pH of the inoculation media (Table 1 ). The effect of pH on the stability of virus was estimated by measuring the infective titre before and after incubation for 24 hours at 4 \u00b0, 23 \u00b0 and 37 \u00b0 C over the range pH 6.0--8.0 ( Table 2) . The virus was relatively stable at all pH values at 4 \u00b0 C. At 23 \u00b0 C the virus showed least loss in infectivity at the acid pH values, at pH 8.0 there was a decrease from 10 s-o to 105.~ PFU/ml after 24 hours. The lack of stability of the virus was most marked at 37 \u00b0 C and was directly related to pH--there was a decrease in infectivity at pI-I 6.0 from 10 s-16 to 104.ss compared to a drop in titre from 10 me PFU/ml to less than 5 PFU/ml at pK 8.0.

Uptake of (aH)-leucine into both control and infected CK cells occurred only at relatively low levels. However, the results obtained (Fig. 6b) indicate that, like (3H)-nridine incorporation, TCA-soluble and TCA-insolubte uptake of (3H)teueine was inhibited in parallel, with virus release following infection.",

            "text": "These results suggest that inhibition of protein and I~NA synthesis occurs in infected cells as a result of the onset of CPE and cell death and there is no specific mechanism by which IBV inhibits host cell synthesis. In this context it can be seen that increase in cell fusion and inhibition of (SH)-uridine incorporation occur at identical rates. Further evidence that host macromolecule synthesis inhibition was related directly to CPE was the relationship between inhibition of (3I-I). uridine and (3H)-lencine incorporation at 20 hours post infection and the pH of the media between pH values 6.0--9.0 (Fig. 7) . Our studies on the stabihty of IBV in tissue culture media produced similar results to those obtained by POCOCK and GARW~S with TGEV (personal communication). However other studies on I:BV stability have produced conflicting results. Virus in cell culture fluid has been reported to be more labile at pit 2.9--3.1 than pit 7.1--7.3 following incubation for 4 hours at room temperature (11) but more labile at pH 11.0 than pit 3.0 following 30 minutes incubation at 4\u00b0C (21) . CV~'L~G~A~ and STrAiT (9) reported an optimum of pH 8.5 for survival of IBV in phosphate buffer at 4 \u00b0 C and Jo~DA~ and NAss~ (16) who investigated the stability of IBV in water showed values of pH 5--9 had little affect on IBV stability but that least fall in titre occurred at pH 9. These apparent discrepancies are difficult to explain but may relate to the different conditions used or differences in the IBV strains used.",

However GALLAH:]~R and B!aA~T (14) have reported a marked pH optimum of pH 8.2 for fusion of CE cells from within by NDV, whereas CK cells infected with IBV showed a linear increase in the degree of fusion between pH 5.0 and 8.0, which levelled off from pH 8.0 to 9.0. It would seem likely from our results with IBV that increase in syncytial formation at high pI-I is directly related to the increase in virus growth. However GALLAI~ and BnATT (14) report that an increase in syncytial formation at high pH is not, necessarily related to an increase in the growth rate of NDV. Caution should be used in making direct comparisons of IBV with other cell fusing viruses since different mechanisms may be involved. For example, it has been suggested (11) that virus-induced cell fusion occurs following the modification of the cell surface membranes by incorporation of virus specified products, but morphogenesis studies with IBV (4) have failed to show any budding from the surface of infected cells and with other coronaviruses no viral antigens could be deteeted in the membrane with ferritin-labelled antibodies (18) .",
