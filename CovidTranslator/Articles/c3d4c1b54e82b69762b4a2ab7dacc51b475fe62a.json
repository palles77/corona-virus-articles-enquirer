A total of 30 rabbits were randomly divided into 5 groups (n=6): A control, ANFH, ANFH + antler (250 mg/kg), ANFH + antler (500 mg/kg) and ANFH + antler (1,000 mg/kg) group. Rabbits in the experimental groups were injected with methylprednisolone and horse serum to establish a steroid-induced ANFH (SANFH) model. Rabbits in the ANFH + antler (250 mg/kg), ANFH + antler (500 mg/kg) and ANFH + antler (1,000 mg/kg) groups were treated with intraperitoneal injection of 250, 500 or 1,000 mg/kg antler extract/day, respectively, for 60 days. Serum samples were then extracted to determine total cholesterol (CT) and triglyceride levels, treat osteoblasts, measure 11\u03b2-HSD (11\u03b2-HSD1) and 11\u03b2-HSD2 and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels and cellular apoptosis, and determine the proportion of osteoblasts in each phase of the cell cycle. Serum CT and triglyceride levels in SANFH rabbits significantly decreased as the concentration of antler increased (P<0.05). 11\u03b2-HSD1 levels in the femoral heads of SANFH rabbits and osteoblasts following treatment with antler-containing serum decreased as the concentration of antler used increased, whereas levels of 11\u03b2-HSD1 increased significantly (P<0.05). The proliferation of osteoblasts and ALP levels in osteoblasts increased as the antler concentration increased, whereas the number of osteoblasts in the G0/G1 phase decreased significantly (P<0.05). The current study demonstrated that treatment with antler extract has a therapeutic effect on ANFH induced by steroids in rabbits and may regulate the expression of 11\u03b2-HSD in femoral heads and osteoblasts, as well as promoting the proliferation of osteoblasts.",

Steroid-induced avascular necrosis of the femoral head (SANFH) is a type of non-traumatic ANFH and the most common type of femoral head necrosis. It occurs following the long-term use of adrenocorticotropic hormones (ACTH) or the use of high doses of ACTHs (3) (4) (5) . The major clinical characteristics of ANFH include hip pain, limited mobility, lameness and a high disability rate, which negatively impact patient health and quality of life (6) (7) (8) . It is estimated that ~50% of all ONFH cases are induced by ACTH (5, 9, 10) . In China, there are 5-7.5 million patients with ONFH requiring treatment and the number of new ONFH cases was 150,000-200,000 in 1998, with the majority of cases diagnosed in young adults (11) .",

Relative expression of 11\u03b2-HSD1 and 11\u03b2-HSD2 in the rabbit femoral heads and osteoblasts. Previous studies have demonstrated that the number of cases of ANFH that occur following the use of steroids is increasing (47) (48) (49) . Without therapy or intervention, femoral head necrosis may become an irreversible process (50, 51) . Previously, the majority of treatments for hip arthroplasty (52), prosthesis and reconstructive surgery (53) were surgical. However, few cases could not undergo surgical treatment. The current study used the steroid methylprednisolone to induce and establish a model of SANFH in rabbits. Following successful establishment of the model, different concentrations of antler extract were used to treat rabbits to determine the therapeutic effect of antler extract on SANFH. Subsequently, serum CT and triglyceride levels in the rabbits were measured and it was observed that CT and triglyceride levels increased following the establishment of SANFH. However, CT and triglyceride levels decreased in the serum following treatment with antler extract. Serum CT levels of the rabbits in the SANFH, SANFH + antler (250 mg/kg), SANFH + antler (500 mg/kg) and SANFH + antler (1,000 mg/kg) groups were all higher than that of the control, indicating the successful establishment of the SANFH model and the presence of metabolic disorder. Serum CT levels in the SANFH + antler (250 mg/kg), SANFH + antler (500 mg/kg) and SANFH + antler (1,000 mg/kg) groups were lower than those of the SANFH group. Furthermore, serum CT levels in the SANFH + antler (500 mg/kg) and SANFH + antler (1,000 mg/kg) groups were significantly lower than in the SANFH + antler (250 mg/kg) group (P<0.05). Similar results were observed regarding triglyceride levels. This may be explained by the fact that SANFH induces fat embolism in the peripheral vessels, leading to intravascular coagulation (54) (55) (56) . The results of the current study therefore indicate that antler extract induces a therapeutic effect on metabolic disorders in SANFH.",

The current study detected and compared 11\u03b2-HSD1 and 11\u03b2-HSD2 expression in femoral head tissue and osteoblasts with or without treatment with different concentrations of antler extract or antler-containing serum. The results demonstrated that in the femoral head tissues of SANFH model rabbits and osteoblasts treated with different concentrations of antler extract, 11\u03b2-HSD1 levels significantly decreased, whereas levels of 11\u03b2-HSD2 significantly increased (P<0.05). In the femoral head tissue, 11\u03b2-HSD1 levels in the experimental groups, apart from in the SANFH + antler (1,000 mg/kg) group, were significantly higher than in the control (P<0.05). Levels of 11\u03b2-HSD1 in the SANFH + antler (250 mg/kg), SANFH + antler (500 mg/kg) and SANFH + antler (1,000 mg/kg) groups were all significantly lower than that in SANFH group (P<0.05). 11\u03b2-HSD2 levels in the experimental groups were lower compared with the control, significantly (P<0.05).

Similar results were found regarding in osteoblasts treated with different concentrations of antler extract, with decreasing 11\u03b2-HSD1 and increasing 11\u03b2-HSD2 levels. This phenomenon indicates that 11\u03b2-HSD1 is upregulated, whereas 11\u03b2-HSD2 is downregulated in SANFH. Antler induced therapeutic effects in SANFH by downregulating 11\u03b2-HSD1 and upregulating 11\u03b2-HSD2. Following treatment with higher concentrations of antler extract, this therapeutic effect became more marked.",

As well as the detection of 11\u03b2-HSD expression, levels of ALP, which is an indicator of early osteoblastic differentiation (59), were measured and cell proliferation and the proportion of cells in each phase of the cell cycle were determined. The proliferation rates of the osteoblasts in all experimental groups were all significantly lower than that of the control (P<0.05), indicating that SANFH inhibits the proliferation of osteoblasts. The proliferation rate in the SANFH + antler (250 mg/kg), SANFH + antler (500 mg/kg) and SANFH + antler (1,000 mg/kg) groups were significantly higher than that of the SANFH group (P<0.05) and increased as the concentration of antler extract increased, indicating that antler treatment may promote the proliferation of osteoblasts. ALP levels in all experimental groups were significantly lower than that of the control (P<0.05), indicating that SANFH decreases ALP levels. However, ALP levels in the SANFH + antler (250 mg/kg), SANFH + antler (500 mg/kg) and SANFH + antler (1,000 mg/kg) groups were all significantly higher than that of the SANFH group (P<0.05) and increased as the concentration of antler extract increased, indicating that treatment with antler extract may increase ALP levels following SANFH. The proportion of osteoblasts in the G0/G1 phase (%) in the experimental groups were higher than that in the control and the proportion of osteoblasts in the SANFH + antler (250 mg/kg), SANFH + antler (500 mg/kg) and SANFH + antler (1,000 mg/kg) groups were all significantly lower than that of the SANFH group (P<0.05). This phenomenon demonstrates that SANFH may inhibit the proliferation of osteoblasts proliferation and attenuate the cell cycle at the G0/G1 phase. Antler extract, as a therapeutic drug, may promote the proliferation of osteoblasts and induce cellular differentiation.",
