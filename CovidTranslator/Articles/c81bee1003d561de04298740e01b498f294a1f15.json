The rapid diagnosis allows for a better clinical management of the patient, for adopting public health measures and for controlling possible outbreaks. The main etiologic agents can be diagnosed within the first hours after the onset of symptoms with antigen detection techniques, primarily immunochromatography. Results are obtained in 15-30 min, with 70-90% sensitivity and >95% specificity for the diagnosis of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Legionella pneumophila serogroup O1 infections from urine, Streptococcus pyogenes from throat swabs and respiratory syncytial virus from nasopharyngeal aspirates. Worse results are obtained for influenza viruses and Pneumocystis jirovecii with these techniques; however, other easy-to-perform molecular techniques are available for the rapid diagnosis of these microorganisms. In general, these techniques should not be used for monitoring the outcome or response to treatment. (J.M. Marim\u00f3n).",

The relatively low sensitivity means that the majority of authors continue to recommend taking a culture in case the test is negative, in order to detect a greater number of cases. 6 The great advantage of ICTs is that they can be performed in the presence of the patient, which, along with the high specificity, means that after a positive result no confirmatory culture is required, and specific antibody treatments can be recommended on the spot.

ICT tests for detecting the L. pneumophila serogroup O1 urinary antigen are considered POCTs since the qualitative results are obtained in minutes, without the need for specialised personnel to take the samples or perform the tests. A fluorescent ICT test has recently emerged which provides greater sensitivity in detection, while eliminating the possible bias attributable to the visual reading of the result. 16 The lower specificity observed, particularly in concentrated urine, improves when repeating positive tests after boiling the urine.

These sensitivities normally vary between 60 and 75%, and are generally higher in bacteraemic pneumococcal pneumonia studies.

They also make it possible to detect non-viable viruses, or those which it has not been possible to isolate in traditional cell cultures. They generally have a response time in excess of 24 h and require specific infrastructure and equipment as well as specialised personnel, limiting their use for rapid diagnosis or in emergency situations. 37 Nonetheless, in recent years NAATs have been developed in different quick and easy formats, with no loss of efficiency compared to classic molecular procedures. With minimal sample handling and after dispensing the sample into individual devices, the extraction, application and detection of RVs is performed on one single piece of equipment. [38] [39] [40] As is true of viral antigen detection tests, they have been developed commercially from tests aimed at detecting one specific virus (RSV and/or influenza) evolving into \"multiplexes\" capable of simultaneously detecting the majority of possible viruses involved in these processes. All this with a result obtention time of between 15 and 90 min, with a minimal work load (around 2 min), Fig. 1 .

Modified by Navarro-Mar\u00ed et al. 45 meaning that it is currently possible to use them as POCTs, with results that are much more reliable than those obtained with viral antigen detection tests. 31, 35, 41 In general, these devices make it possible to process a limited number of samples at the same time (between 1 and 8, depending on the platform). Other systems using Luminex technology make it possible to process up to 96 samples and simultaneously detect 22 different pathogens (19 viruses and 3 bacteria), obtaining results in 4-5 h; but the need to use three different items of equipment in the processing hinders their use as rapid tests.",

It has only been possible to associate the use of these tests in emergencies to lower consumption of antibiotics, but only once patients return to the outpatient setting. 42 In the specific case of viral antigen detection tests for the influenza virus, they generally demonstrate a highly deficient sensitivity and a negative predictive value, owing to which their use in emergency healthcare, beyond specific high-risk cases and if the patient does not need to be admitted, has been called into question. Fig. 1 shows a proposed algorithm for the use of influenza diagnostic tests during epidemic periods. Generally speaking, if it is considered necessary to rule out influenza virus owing to the patient's clinical situation, in order to start the treatment early or to implement preventive measures for nosocomial outbreaks of influenza, it is better to implement a NAAT directly, just as if the patient required hospital admission. 43 Although performing influenza diagnosis tests is recommended in hospitalised patients with compatible clinical symptoms, in these cases, empirical anti-viral treatment must be initiated as soon as possible, without the need to await the result of diagnostic tests.",

Depending on the monoclonal antibody selected, it is possible to specifically stain the cysts or all forms of the microorganism. Given that there are more trophic forms, the sensitivity of those kits which stain both forms is greater. Antibodies are usually marked with fluorescein isothiocyanate, which means that under the ultraviolet light of the microscope, the walls of the cysts and trophozoites show up fluorescent green. While the specificity of all microscopic techniques is similar, the most sensitive is DIF. 47, 51, 52 The most widely used molecular technique is PCR, which is considered to be around 100 times more sensitive than microscopy in the diagnosis of pneumonia caused by P. jirovecii. 53 The sensitivity of PCR can be enhanced when using targets present in multiple copies of the Pneumocystis genome, such as the codified gene of the 23S subunit of the mitochondrial rRNA (mitochondrial large subunit rRNA) or the major surface glycoprotein or by performing a nested PCR. Other targets used in the detection of Pneumocystis include the internal transcribed spacer of ribosomal genes, the 5S cytoplasmic rRNA, dihydrofolate reductase and thymidylate synthase. 54, 55 The high sensitivity of PCRs, capable of detecting quantities lower than 3.5 copies/l of sample, mean that a negative PCR text in a pulmonary sample (BAL, biopsy) serves to rule out the involvement of P. jirovecii in the infection. 56 In fact, the high sensitivity of PCR has led some authors to propose it as a diagnostic technique in respiratory samples in which a low quantity of Pneumocystis can be expected, such as samples from immunodepressed patients not infected by HIV or non-invasive respiratory samples (induced sputum, nasal swabs, etc.), since a negative result will avoid the need to resort to invasive techniques. The problem is that in these non-invasive samples, a positive result may detect a sub-clinical colonisation instead of an acute infection. The joint conduct of PCR and microscopy in induced sputum or in samples from the upper respiratory tract has been suggested, such that a positive PCR with a positive microscopy would be a sign of infection, while a positive PCR with negative microscopy would represent colonisation. A negative PCR result would exclude infection and colonisation by Pneumocystis. 57 The drawback of the conventional PCR and of the nested PCR is the lack of quantification, the determination of which would be a reflection of the fungal load present and could thus help to differentiate between colonisation and acute infection. This problem can be overcome with real-time quantitative PCR; nonetheless, clear cut-off points for distinguishing between colonisation and illness have yet to be established. In general, a threshold cycle, or an elevated initiation cycle for the exponential phase of the amplification, represents a low fungal load and is possibly more suggestive of a colonisation than an infection. 57 In these situations of a positive PCR, serological tests can be added (such as the detection in serum of 1-3 beta-d-glucan), which, even without being specific to Pneumocystis, increases in fungal infections and can supplement a positive PCR result in a non-invasive respiratory sample (sputum or even saliva). 58 The negative predictive value of the beta-d-glucan assay is extremely high, and it can be employed in patients on whom bronchoscopy cannot be performed or for whom there is a slight suspicion of infection by Pneumocystis. Reduction in the DNA load of Pneumocystis by means of real-time PCR has also been used as a treatment response control. It is not uncommon for a patient to be infected with more than one specific genotype of P. jirovecii, which may hinder the detection of a specific genotype or quantification in a quantitative PCR. Molecular techniques also offer other \"alternatives\" to the study of infection by Pneumocystis, including epidemiological and person-to-person transmission studies through \"multilocus genotyping\", and even an approximation to resistance to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole by analysing mutations in the codifying genes of dihydropteroate synthase and dihydrofolate reductase. 59 The serological tests for detecting antibodies to P. jirovecii are useful for performing epidemiological studies, but not in the diagnosis of acute infection.",

Currently, RDTs for detecting antigens can be used as POCTs, which is not the case for the majority of nucleic acid amplification tests, which, in turn, show higher percentages of specificity, but above all sensitivity. Improvements in terms of the simplicity of sample processing and in the interpretation of results would seem to make it likely that in the near future the use of nucleic acid amplification tests as POCT for the diagnosis of RIs will become more widespread.",
