Visual perception is the ability to interpret the surrounding environment by processing information contained in the visible light, and for that to be accomplished the whole visual system (eye, optic nerve, and cerebral cortex) needs to be involved. It is reported that humans obtain over 80% of all external information from vision. Visual impairment can have devastating health and socio-economic consequences, so risk assessment for toxicity of new chemicals and drugs with respect to the visual system is extremely important.",

            "text": "The evaluation of ocular tissues for efficacious or toxic effects has many challenges that are shared with nonocular tissues while others are eye-specific. One must understand the special requirements for tissue sampling, trimming, fixation, and histologic processing for eye specimens in general, and for the eyes of different species in particular, in order to obtain histologic sections of suitable quality. From the biologic and anatomic perspectives, one needs to be aware of the differences in ocular anatomy among species in order to differentiate toxicant-induced changes from normal anatomical variations. Because of the accessibility of the intraocular structures to clinical examination and detection of lesions in vivo, the accurate identification and diagnosis of microscopic findings requires an awareness and understanding of clinical ocular findings. On the same note, there is an almost complete overlap between the terminology in clinical ophthalmology and ocular pathology, so familiarization with clinical and diagnostic terms is essential for accurate communication. Once identified, ocular findings need to be proper classified as treatment-related, spontaneous, or iatrogenic. A multinational effort involving the Society of Toxicologic Pathology (STP), British Society of Toxicological Pathology (BSTP), European Society of Toxicologic Pathology (ESTP), the Japanese Society of Toxicologic Pathology (JSTP), and the Registry of Industrial Toxicology Animal data (RITA) in Europe is developing standardized nomenclature for classifying microscopic lesions observed in laboratory rats and mice in toxicity and carcinogenicity studies. This project, referred to as the International Harmonization of Nomenclature and Diagnostic (INHAND) Criteria for Lesions in Rats and Mice, has resulted in a list of accepted terms for \"Nonproliferative and Proliferative Lesions of the Rat and Mouse Special Sense Organs (Ocular [eye and glands], Olfactory and Otic),\" which may be accessed at https://www.toxpath.org/inhand. asp. These terms now are required in product registration packages submitted to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to ensure compliance with the \"Standard for Exchange of Nonclinical Data\" (SEND) guidance recently implemented by this agency.",

            "text": "The eye is a highly specialized organ that originates from multiple embryological layers, especially the neural crest, mesoderm, neuroectoderm, and surface ectoderm. This embryological tissue diversity becomes evident in the large spectrum of cellular differentiation as well as the complexity and specialization of the ocular tissues (Figure 22a .1). Table 22a .1 offers timelines for the comparative embryological development of the dog, mouse, and human eyes. The main function of the eye is through the cone and rod photoreceptors located in the retina, which transform light energy into electrical impulses (phototransduction) that are transmitted via the optic nerve to the optical centers of the brain. In order for impulses to be generated in the eye, the light needs to be effectively focused on the retina; proper focusing depends on structural characteristics like size and rigidity of the globe, corneal surface and lens curvature, and locations and optical clarities of the various risk of accidental trauma. The lids also have important functions in tear film formation and distribution (see later). In rodents, rabbits, and dogs, the upper and lower lids are fused at birth and separate only after retinal development is adequate for vision (between 12 and 15 days of age in the mouse and rat). In the species commonly used in toxicity studies, the eyelid presents a palpebral (inner) surface lined by conjunctiva, a specialized lid margin that contains openings for multiple meibomian (sebaceous) glands, and haired skin on the outer surface. Carnivores, rabbits, and humans present an almond-shaped eye fissure, while most rodents and nonhuman primates have a round one. Lid closure is moderated by the orbicularis oculi (Figure 22a .2) and levator palpebrae muscles.",

Dogs and cats have both an extraocular lacrimal gland and a gland of the third eyelid. Rodents and rabbits have lacrimal gland systems consisting of extraorbital (i.e., the exorbital lacrimal gland) and intraorbital (i.e., Harderian gland) components (Figure 22a .3). The intraorbital component is located behind the globe, and generally in a medial (nasal) location. The lacrimal gland is a seromucinous gland that contributes mainly to the aqueous component of the tears. However, significant quantities of lipid are present in the secretion of Harderian glands, particularly in rabbits. The continual formation of tears that moistens the ocular surface is largely done by the small (minor) lacrimal glands of the conjunctival fornix, with the major lacrimal glands mainly producing the excess tear formation (crying) that results from ocular discomfort. In all species, the glands' secretions contain enzymes and cytokines as well as antimicrobial substances (peptides and proteins) that protect the ocular surfaces.",

The mammalian cornea is covered on the surface by several layers of nonkeratinizing, stratified squamous epithelium organized into three layers: a deep layer of basal cells resting on a basal lamina, an intermediate layer of \"wing\" cells, and a surface layer composed of multiple layers of squamous cells, the number of which depends on the species (mice, rats, and rabbits, 3\u00c05 layers, and dogs, cats, and primates, 5\u00c07) . This epithelium has a remarkably uniform thickness and structural consistency across the entire surface of the cornea. A modified acellular region of stroma (Bowman's layer) composed of fine, randomly arranged collagen fibers is present posterior to the epithelial basal lamina in humans and nonhuman primates. Although Bowman's layer is not visible by light microscopy in the mouse, a thin layer of randomly arranged collagen fibrils can be seen immediately underneath the corneal epithelium by electron microscopy. The function of Bowman's membrane is not known. The bulk of the cornea is the stroma, which is located deep to Bowman's membrane (if one is present) or to the corneal epithelium (Figure 22a.4) . Optical transparency of the cornea stroma is dependent on a precise spatial relationship between stromal collagen fibers, noncollagenous matrix, and the functional stromal cells (keratocytes). A monolayer of low cuboidal epithelial cells (corneal endothelium) separates the cornea from the aqueous humor of the anterior chamber. The corneal endothelium secretes Descemet's membrane, a thick basement membrane positioned between the endothelium and the inner surface of the corneal stroma. Descemet's membrane is composed mainly of laminin, fibronectin, and type IV collagen, which gives it elastic properties. The morphology of corneal endothelium is similar across mammalian species, but cellular density can vary from 2211 cells/mm 2 in the rat to 4450 cells/mm 2 in nonhuman primates and humans. The endothelium actively moves water and electrolytes between the corneal stroma and anterior chamber, thus supplying the cornea with nutritional support from the aqueous while maintaining corneal transparency (Figure 22a .5).",

The choroid supplies oxygen and nutrients to the retina primarily through the choriocapillaris, an extensive interconnected capillary network located posterior to the retinal pigmented epithelial (RPE) cells (Figure 22a .6F). The choriocapillaris is separated from the RPE layer by Bruch's membrane, a structure formed by five layers: the RPE basal lamina, an inner collagenous zone, a middle elastic layer, outer collagenous zone, and the basement membrane of the endothelial cells of the choriocapillaris (Figure 22a .8). Bruch's membrane selectively filters the passage of macromolecules between the retina and choriocapillaris. Vessels of the choriocapillaris have a fenestrated endothelium through which macromolecules leak into the extracellular space of the choroid; this vascular network has the highest perfusion rate of any capillary bed in the body, which is reflective of the high metabolic demands of the ocular tissues.

Structurally the lens is composed of three parts: the lens capsule, the lens epithelium, and the lens fibers.

The anterior face of the vitreous closest to the lens has a more robust collagen structure.

Vertebrate vision is initiated through the transduction of light energy to neural impulses by the retinal photoreceptors. The retina can be roughly divided into an inner and outer neural retina. The outer neural layer is supported by the retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE). The retina and RPE are not physically attached to one another, but are separated by a potential space. The outer neural retina, particularly the photoreceptor cells, consumes oxygen and nutrients at a higher rate than any other tissue in the body. For this reason, the choroidal blood supply to the RPE is designed to deliver oxygenated blood and remove metabolic wastes for the retina through high-volume, fast-flow rates. The metabolic needs of the inner retina are less than that of the outer retina, and are supplied by an endogenous retinal vasculature, which has a more conventional blood flow rate. Mice, rats, dogs, and nonhuman primates all have an extensive intrinsic retinal vascular bed (i.e., a holangiotic pattern) in addition to the choroidal system ( Figure 22a .11). In contrast, rabbits have a limited retinal vascular system (i.e., a merangiotic pattern), and most of the retina lacks an endogenous blood supply. Vessels in the rabbit are located internal to the surface of the medullary rays, and are attached to the retinal surface by glial cell processes. The metabolic needs of the rabbit retina are largely met through diffusion from the medullary ray vasculature.",

The layers of the neural retina are listed in the following order, from the inner to the outer layer of the retina (Figure 22a .12). While the circuitry and function of the retina is remarkably conserved in vertebrates, marked morphological variation in the retina does exist for among species. Perhaps the most important differences to be considered in toxicologic studies are the vascular pattern (described earlier) and distinctive distribution of photoreceptors (rods and cones). As a rule, the cones (which are specialized in the discrimination of color and detail) are concentrated in the central retina, while the rods [adapted for performance in dim light (i.e., for low resolution)] are more common at the peripheral retina. Most primates, including humans, possess a fovea (also termed the fovea centralis), which is a small circular region characterized by a higher concentration of cones. The fovea is located in the temporal retina near the optic nerve and is responsible for sharp vision. The fovea in primates in turn is surrounded by the macula, a larger retinal region that exhibits an increased ganglion cell density. In contrast, other laboratory animal species have an area centralis, a specialized region that has both more cones and greater retinal ganglion cell density. With the exception of rabbits, the area centralis often is located in the central retina temporal to the optic nerves. Rabbits possess a visual streak, which is a linear, horizontal band (2\u00c03 mm wide) of increased cone and ganglion cell density. This visual streak is located B3 mm ventral to the optic disc, and runs parallel and below the ventral margin of the medullary ray.",

The basal surface of the RPE cells is characterized by extensive infolding. The basal lamina of the RPE cell forms the innermost layer of the five-layered Bruch's membrane, which separates the retina from its rich vascular supply in the choriocapillaris.

The optic nerve is composed primarily of the axons from retina ganglion cells (RGC), which extend from the inner retina, coursing posterior, and centripetally within the inner nerve fiber layer to converge into bundles at the optic nerve head (also known as the optic disc) and form the nerve. The position of the optic disc demonstrates some species variation. In dogs, primates, and rodents, it tends to be positioned in the equatorial region, in the rabbit, and in the dorsal posterior pole. The central area of the optic disc is depressed and is supported by a thickening of the retinal inner limiting membrane (called the supporting meniscus of Kuhnt). Before exiting the eye, the RGC axons are arranged into bundles surrounded by retinal astrocytes. As the axon bundles exit the eye posterior to the choroid, they transverse an open meshwork of horizontally oriented collagenous beams or plates continuous with the sclera (lamina cribrosa). The lamina cribrosa (LC) contains elastin and provides structural support for the nerve. In glaucoma, physical distortion of the globe resulting from elevated IOP causes outward bowing of the LC; the physical distortion and misalignment of the laminar plates results in axon compression, atrophy, and subsequent ganglion cell death. The composition of the LC is similar across species, but there are structural differences. Nonhuman primates, pigs, dogs, cats, and rabbits have a robust LC comparable to humans; in rats, single bundles of collagen form the trabeculae, resulting in a delicate LC (Figure 22a .13). Mice do not have a distinct LC. The axons of the optic nerve are myelinated by oligodendrocytes; the extent of myelination varies across species. In dogs, myelination occurs within the optic disc, with variable extension within the peripapillary nerve fiber layer. The rabbit presents a unique arrangement in that it has a medullary ray, a myelinated and vascularized region on either side of the optic nerve. In other species (nonhuman primates, cats, pigs, and rodents), myelination commences at the outer margins of the LC similar to humans. The optic nerve proper is surrounded by extensions of the three meningeal sheaths of the CNS.",

Impulses arising in the retina travel via the axons of the ganglion cells through the optic nerves, where they undergo a variable degree of crossing (decussation) before entering the optic tract. Axon crossing is an adaptive feature that allows the brain optical centers to view the same hemispheric visual field from both eyes. Generally, fibers from the temporal retina project to the ipsilateral hemisphere while fibers from the nasal retina cross to the contralateral side. The amount of decussation, however, varies among species. The percentage of axonal crossover is approximately 50% in humans and most primates, 25% in dogs, 33% in cats, and up to 99% in rodents and rabbits. After leaving the optic chiasm and entering the optic tract, signals from the retina reach the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), a relay center in the thalamus that exerts dynamic control over the amount and nature of information that is transmitted to the visual processing centers of the brain. Primates and carnivores have a laminated dorsal LGN due to the large number of axons arriving from the contralateral retina, while rodents and rabbits (which have almost no decussation) do not exhibit LGN lamination. Axons from the LGN neurons form the optic radiations that relay visual signals to their final destination in the visual (occipital) cortex, where impulses will be integrated to produce images. In most mammals, the optic radiations also contain reciprocal fiber tracts of axons from neurons in the visual cortex that descend to the LGN and rostral (superior) colliculus (a midbrain structure, often termed the \"optic tectum,\" that helps direct certain visual-related behaviors), thus enabling feedback control of the visual signal processing.",

The excess soft tissues including eyelids, muscles, orbital tissues, and (in rodents) the Harderian glands typically should be removed before fixation. However, there are special circumstances where tissues adjacent to the globe should be kept intact and sampled along with the globe. These might include cases where a surgical field is important (e.g., to define where a glaucoma device was oriented, when analyzing the effects of subconjunctival injections, or to evaluate the invasiveness of a tumors adjacent to the eye). Many options exist for suitable fixation of ocular tissue, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. Regardless of the fixative used, the volume of tissue to be fixed should be kept to a minimum, without sacrificing the integrity of the tissue's anatomic orientation. In most cases, not less than 10 volumes of fixative should be used for one volume of tissue (e.g., 10 mL of solution per 1 gram of tissue).

Rodent eyes are positioned in the vertical plane, and a central section through the pupil and the optic nerve is obtained by serial sectioning. For best results over time, select a standard technique for trimming globes of each species.

Another advantage is that the globe is cut close to the anatomic center, which is appealing for the purpose of macroscopic photography.

To maximize the chances of preserving good lens morphology when trimming, make an initial off-center cut that avoids the lens.

Because of the widespread acceptance of this method, it was later adopted for testing eye care products and drugs designed specifically for topical ophthalmic use prior to marketing. The current Draize method involves the instillation of 10 \u03bcL of a test liquid (or 10 mg of a test solid) into the lower conjunctival cul-de-sac, followed by a saline rinse. Observations of various criteria (i.e., corneal opacity and area of corneal involvement, conjunctival hyperemia, chemosis, ocular discharges, and iris abnormalities) are taken at predefined intervals: 1 hour, 24 hours, 48 hours, 72 hours, 7 days, and 21 days after administration. The test is usually performed in rabbits due to their large eyes, welldescribed anatomy, ease of handling, relatively low cost, and ready availability. A slit-lamp examination has been added to allow better assessment of corneal lesions, and topical fluorescein is applied routinely to reveal any cornel ulceration. Optical or ultrasonic pachymetry now is implemented to measure the extent of corneal thickening. Although the Draize test is still the official model for eye irritation and toxicology studies worldwide, it has suffered major criticism in recent years due to the lack of objective quantification within its grading system, its unreliability in predicting chronic toxic reactions, and marked opposition by animal welfare groups.",

The type of leukocyte response varies with the inciting cause, but usually neutrophils predominate in acute and subacute processes while the number of lymphocytes and macrophages increases with chronicity. The corneal endothelium in most mammalian species presents a very limited proliferative capacity. That said, although rare, the corneal endothelium can respond to injury by proliferating. In such instances, the corneal endothelium migrates over the ICA and anterior aspect of the iris and sometimes produces a Descemet's membrane-like material. This phenomenon is known as endothelialization and is associated with iridocorneal endothelial (ICE) syndrome and some forms of glaucoma in humans. In mice, ICE syndrome occurs in the DBA/2J and AKXD-28/Ty strains and can lead to progressive angle closure glaucoma.",

Microscopically, corneal endothelium attenuation presents as flattened and enlarged cells with an overall decrease in cell numbers and possibly associated corneal stromal edema (Figure 22a .17). Doubling and breaks in Descemet's membrane are usually seen secondary to traumatic events. These lesions can be accompanied by a fibrovascular formation on Descemet's surface (retrocorneal membranes) and/or fibroplasia of the deep corneal stroma. Multiple small breaks in Descemet's membranes can be seen in conjunction with globe enlargement secondary to glaucoma (buphthalmos).

These membranes are seldom actually within the uveal tissue but rather extend out along the surfaces of the iris, ciliary body, and/or choroid, sometimes extending into the anterior and posterior chambers, vitreous and subretinal spaces. Such fibrovascular membranes can lead to synechiae [i.e., adherence of the iris to either the cornea (anterior synechia) or lens (posterior synechia)], ICA closure, and/or hemorrhage. When severe, the membranes block the aqueous outflow, increase IOP, and initiate glaucoma. Retinal hypoxia as a result of restricted perfusion or retinal detachment and subsequent release of pro-angiogenic factors [e.g., vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)] in the ocular chambers is a common cause of fibrovascular membrane formation; two diseases resulting from production of such factors are neovascular glaucoma and choroidal neovascularization in the \"wet\" form of AMD. Intraocular inflammation, deep ocular trauma, and intraocular tumors are other possible causes.

Microscopically, focal to occasionally multifocal rosette-like and tubular structures that expand and distort the INL and/or ONL are observed.

Increased pressure within the cranium can result in clinically apparent swelling and rostral displacement of the optic nerve head into the eye, a protrusion known as papilledema. Gliosis is a common but nonspecific reaction of the optic nerve neuropil to many different insults and can be a sign of early disease. Liquefactive necrosis (malacia) of the optic nerve occurs in association with ischemic (e.g., retrobulbar hemorrhage secondary to blood collection) or inflammatory insults. Necrosis is one of the initial optic nerve alterations seen in acute cases of glaucoma and also is very common in suppurative intraocular inflammation that involves the retina and extends into the optic nerve. As in other parts of the CNS, liquefaction of the optic nerve leads to infiltration with macrophages (gitter cells), many of which may contain eosinophilic intracytoplasmic debris believed to be digested myelin. As a consequence of optic nerve head necrosis in association with high IOP seen in glaucoma, the optic nerve collapses at the lamina cribrosa and the residual nerve tissue is displaced caudally into the sclera (an effect called \"optic nerve cupping\"). In some cases, a focal loss of optic nerve neuropil allows the vitreous to prolapse into the optic nerve trunk to form a cavitated lesion (termed \"Schnabel's cavernous atrophy\").

Rather, glaucoma is a diverse group of diseases united by a common theme in which IOP is too high for the retina/optic nerve to function normally, thus resulting in progressive vision loss. The loss of vision is specific and characterized by atrophy of the optic disc (manifested as cupping) and (in humans) characteristic patterns of visual field dysfunction. Increased IOP is almost always related to an obstruction (partial or complete) of the aqueous drainage pathways. This obstruction can affect the structures of the iridocorneal angle (ICA) directly or adjacent outflow pathway structures like the pupillary space, anterior chamber, and scleral drainage vessels. A primary obstruction of the ICA is usually seen with congenital malformations [goniodysgenesis (abnormal development of the intraocular channels for fluid egress) in dogs and anterior segment dysgenesis/congenital glaucoma in multiple species]. Secondary obstructions can affect all levels of the aqueous drainage pathways and are associated with ocular or systemic diseases. The most common ocular lesions that can obstruct the aqueous pathways and cause glaucoma are intraocular hemorrhage, endophthalmitis, uveitis, anterior uveal fibrovascular membranes and synechiae (iris adhesions), melanin pigment deposition in the trabecular meshwork (TM) (pigment dispersion), anterior lens luxation, and intraocular tumors. Regardless of the cause, the increased IOP can cause global enlargement of the eye (buphthalmos). A number of secondary changes develop subsequently, including corneal stromal edema and neovascularization; multiple breaks in Descemet's membrane (termed \"Haab's striae\"); scleral atrophy at the limbus, which can evolve to a staphyloma (i.e., outward bulging of the thin atrophic sclera); collapse of the ciliary cleft; and atrophy of the iris, ciliary body and TM. In some cases, animals can develop cataracts and lens luxation due to stretching and breaking of the lens zonular ligaments. One of the central histological features of glaucoma is the loss of ganglion cells in the inner retina and atrophy of the optic nerve. The mechanisms of glaucomatous optic nerve and retinal damage remain subject to debate. Of the many proposed mechanisms, the most popular hypotheses are given here:",

In dogs, the retinal atrophy can affect all retinal layers and is usually more prominent in the nontapetal (ventral) than in the tapetal (dorsal) retina. This phenomenon is called \"tapetal sparing,\" and it is a typical feature of glaucoma in the dog. Necrosis of the optic nerve is an early feature of glaucoma, and it often is followed by malacia, gliosis, and the formation of a deep optic nerve cup. In species other than the dog, the development of gliosis and optic nerve cupping follows a less precipitous course.

Ocular developmental abnormalities are common in humans, domestic animals, and laboratory animals. They can be a part of hereditary disease processes, or they can be induced by exposure to teratogenic compounds that affect development of the eye in utero without affecting the genome. In either case, ocular abnormalities can be limited to the eye or periocular tissues, but they are often part of systemic syndromes where the effect on ocular tissues is but one of many lesions induced in multiple organ systems sharing a common critical period of development (see Chapter 25: Embryo, Fetus, and Placenta). Toxicity studies often need to evaluate for either genotoxic or teratogenic potential, and evaluation of the developing eye in treated conceptuses has a role in modern toxicologic pathology. Although the mouse model is most often used for this assessment, the zebrafish model has many potential advantages including the rapid pace of embryonic development, the transparency of fish embryos throughout the period of ocular embryogenesis, and the large numbers of offspring. The most common ocular developmental problems encountered in both the teratogenic and genetic scenarios are lesions that involve inductive phenomena such as closure of the optic fissure, separation of the lens vesicle, or replacement of the primary vitreous. Congenital cataract or abnormalities of lens size or position are other frequent problems that may be observed in developmental toxicity studies.

Subconjunctival administration of drugs associated with biodegradable drug implants designed for sustainable drug delivery also is common practice in nonclinical toxicology studies. Poly[D,L-lactide-coglycolide] (PLGA) or poly[D,L-lactide-co-caprolactone] are among the most common biodegradable polymers used for this purpose; in particular, PLGA has been used extensively in studies to deliver a wide variety of drugs using various forms such as microparticles, emulsions, implants, and hydrogels. These polymers degrade through hydrolysis of their ester bonds into lactic acids, glycolic acids, and caproic acid-and eventually into water and carbon dioxide. In most instances, these subconjunctival implants cause minimal to no tissue reaction, and when one does develop local conjunctival hyperemia and edema are the most common responses. In the rare instances where substantial toxic reactions are observed, they are usually related to failed degradation of the polymer with secondary conjunctival fibrosis of the substantia propria to encapsulate the implants. When subconjunctival injections are part of the study design, the conjunctiva should be evaluated microscopically, especially in the area of the injection.",

An acid burn to the conjunctiva and cornea will coagulate the proteins from the epithelium, conjunctival substantia propria, and corneal stroma. The precipitation of the protein of the more superficial tissues from the epithelium or substantia propria/stroma prevents acid substances, especially weak acids, from infiltrating more deeply into the tissues, which lessens the severity of the final lesions. This effect does not occur with alkaline substances as they will deeply penetrate the conjunctival and corneal tissues at once, causing more severe damage. The most severe base injuries to the eye are caused by alkalis with pH values greater than 12. On the corneoconjunctival epithelium, alkalis cause saponification of fatty acids, cell membrane dissociation, and acute cell death leading to destruction and penetration of the epithelial layers. In the corneal stroma, alkalis cause hydrolysis of proteoglycans and render the stromal matrix susceptible to enzymatic degradation from neutrophil collagenases and plasmin from damaged epithelial cells and fibroblasts, leading to lysis of the stroma (i.e., stromal collagenolysis or keratomalacia). Interestingly, in contrast to acids and surfactants, alkalis tend to produce multifocal to focally extensive injuries presenting as a pattern of almost normal areas intermingled with deeply affected ones.",

In this fashion corneal epithelial cells might be able to activate or detoxify xenobiotics applied to their apical surfaces. Some substances can cause thickening of the corneal epithelium. This increase may be reflective of different pathological processes. For example, corneal epithelial hyperplasia has been observed with systemically administered high doses of recombinant epithelial growth factor. Similarly, long-term topical treatment with an immunosuppressive drug like tacrolimus or cyclosporine is correlated with the development of corneal squamous cell carcinoma in dogs, although since these dogs usually also present with chronic keratitis, the degree of risk attributable to the drug treatment relative to persistent inflammation is unknown.

The corneal endothelium is typically exposed to high concentrations of a substance when the material is introduced into the anterior chamber by either intracameral injections (i.e., directly into the anterior chamber) or introduction during surgical procedures. That said, the flow of the aqueous humor in the anterior chamber normally protects the endothelial cells by quickly removing these substances and preventing its accumulation to high concentration in the aqueous humor. The corneal endothelium has a very limited regenerative capacity, so any toxicity that compromises endothelial function or reduces the total number of corneal endothelial cells seriously impairs corneal integrity. The endothelial cells do not tolerate any sort of contact. In many species, anterior lens luxation leading to contact of the lens capsule with the corneal endothelium will cause attenuation or spindle cell metaplasia of the axial endothelial cells. Similarly, intraocular surgeons go to great lengths to avoid touching the endothelium and to protect these cells by using viscoelastic materials to coat their surfaces. Antimetabolite drugs such as mitomycin C are commonly used as postsurgical treatment in glaucoma surgery in humans and animal models to avoid fibrosis and blockage of implanted aqueous drainage devices.

These substances are associated with dose-related corneal thickening and ultrastructural damage to the corneal endothelium in humans and rabbits. Intracameral implementation of medical devices can cause mechanical loss of corneal endothelial cells, leading to focal areas of corneal opacity. The opacity is a consequence of increased water entry and retention in the corneal stroma due to loss of the endothelial barrier. Functional impairment of the corneal endothelial cells with minimal to no anatomical changes is a phenomenon that must be taken into account whenever a toxic substance is injected directly into the anterior chamber.

Numerous toxic pathways can manifest as cataract. For example, if the chemical environment in the lens differs from the normal state, the lens epithelial cells can undergo an epithelial-tomesenchymal transformation (EMT) or alter the differentiation path by which lens epithelium transforms to lens fibers. If the external pressure of the zonular ligament is altered, this mechanical change also can cause cataract. The proliferating and differentiating lens epithelium is very sensitive to UV light and to a large number of toxic substances and disease states. Changes in the lens proteins during toxic cataract formation are similar to the changes that occur during aging. The appearance of cataract varies among species, as does the sensitivity to toxic cataract development; these differences are thought to be related to age and different lenticular metabolism profiles among species, and even breed/strains. In addition, cataract features also depend on the nature of the toxicant. For example, glutathione (GSH) is an important lens antioxidant. Chronic corticosteroid exposure can lower GSH levels in the lens and, therefore, increase the risk of cataract associated with oxidative stress. Substances that affect cell mitosis such as radiation or radiomimetic drugs interfere with the organized stepwise differentiation of the lens cortex and can lead to cortical cataract, usually at the nuclear bow. Many photosensitizing agents are thought to cause cataracts. Among them, UV light is the most cited. Some believe UV light exposure alone is not enough to produce lesions and that another photosensitizing agent must also be present simultaneously.",

Because sorbitol does not readily diffuse out of cells and its further oxidation (to fructose via the action of sorbital dehydrogenase) is slow, the accumulation of sorbitol in the hyperglycemic state increases the intracellular osmotic pressure within the lens, leading to water retention and eventual rupture of the lens fiber cells. Similarly, rats and dogs also develop galactose-induced osmotic cataracts, this time by the fast buildup of galactol from galactose reduction by AR. It is also important to recognize that some drugs, including opiates, opioids, and phenothiazine, can induce acute reversible white clouding of the lens in rodents within 1 to 2 hours of administration.

This toxic reaction is rare in animals. Transient elevation of IOP was reported in rabbits treated with almost lethal systemic doses of corticosteroids, and there is one report of increased IOP in a cat treated with dexamethasone. Viscoelastic substances injected into the anterior chamber during intraocular surgeries (to protect the corneal endothelium) have been implicated in the induction of significant postoperative increase in IOP in humans and dogs.

Many of the middle ear reactions to directly instilled vehicles and test articles are similar to those described earlier for the spontaneous otitides. As with the external ear, treatment with isotonic saline will cause some changes in the middle ear including minimal to mild hyperplasia and hypertrophy of the mucosal epithelium as well as minimal edema of the lamina propria (Figures 22b.14 and 22b.15) . With more irritating substances, heterophilic/ neutrophilic infiltrates will develop within the lamina propria and in most cases initiate a suppurative cellular exudate in the tympanic bulla lumen (Figure 22b.16) .

Combinations of ototoxicants and chronically high levels of ambient noise exacerbate the hearing loss that develops following either source of damage alone. Outer hair cells generally are more sensitive to ototoxicants than are inner hair cells. Ototoxic agents typically produce patterns of damage that mimic agerelated hearing loss in that the basal (high frequency) areas of the cochlea are affected before the apical (low frequency) areas.

This can be surmised in some instances from the loss of spiral ganglion neurons in the absence of inner hair cell loss. Further evidence of this effect may be provided by functional testing.

Dying spiral ganglion neurons will be morphologically identical to the \"red dead\" neurons observed in other degenerating neural tissues (for example, see Chapter 21, Nervous System, Figure 21 .5), appearing as shrunken cells with small, dense nuclei, and bright eosinophilic cytoplasm (Figure 22b .28). The normal cellularity of the spiral ganglion varies highly from apex to base; therefore, a diagnosis of hypocellularity should be made with caution on routine microscopic sections unless the loss of ganglion tissue is marked. Given the appropriate timing of the evaluation after hair cell loss, the \"dying back\" phenomenon of axons in the nervous system due to loss of functional synapses in the periphery can be readily apparent in the cochlear nerve. With sufficient time and extensive depletion of spiral ganglion neurons, changes in the cochlear nerve trunk may be apparent as pallor of the nerve at low magnification with swelling of axons or their glial sheaths, formation of digestion chambers, and empty spaces on higher magnification.",

Gentamicin and tobramicin equally affect both the auditory and vestibular systems. In the organ of Corti, aminoglycosides tend to affect outer hair cells before inner hair cells.

However, ototoxicity can be produced in mice when local or systemic aminoglycoside administration is combined with systemic delivery of a loop diuretic. The toxicity of aminoglycosides is due to generation of reactive oxygen species, with iron being a key player. The basal turn of the ear generally has lower levels of glutathione and other antioxidants, which makes it more susceptible to oxidative damage.

The uptake into the inner ear is dose-dependent and has rapid saturation kinetics. However, aminoglycosides are cleared very slowly from the fluids of the cochlea, so even widely spaced doses will result in a long exposure half-life. Aminoglycosides are known to block a variety of ion channels, including Ca 11 -activated K 1 channels and transducer channels. At low doses the mechano-electrical transducer channels on hair cell bundles are thought to be permanently blocked by aminoglycosides. These ports may also be one route of antibiotic entry into the outer hair cell; selective pharmacological blockade of these channels prior to dosing with aminoglycosides reduces the extent of ototoxicity. Aminoglycosides are also taken up by hair cells via endocytotic activity at the apical membrane.

The reason for this mid-frequency sensitivity is unknown. Styrene causes injury to the outer hair cells and spiral ganglion neurons by independent means. Interestingly the toxicity is limited to the mid-frequency range for both, but the frequencies affected only partially overlap. The spiral ganglion cell loss is not secondary to hair cell loss as lower doses of styrene can produce toxicity with only outer hair cell loss but still elicit spiral ganglion cell loss (90%\u00c095% of which innervate inner hair cells, not outer hair cells). In contrast, aminoglycosides induce spiral ganglion cell loss by damaging inner hair cells, leading to a \"dying back\" effect on the ganglionic neurons. With styrene and other solvents, the third (most lateral) row of outer hair cells is lost first, then the second row, followed by the first (most medial) row. Although relatively resistant to styrene, inner hair cells can be lost with high doses. The solvent-induced loss of hair cells proceeds from the middle turn of the cochlea into the apical turns, with the basal turns lost last. Although reports are conflicting, some authors have identified injury to the cells of Hensen, an outer hair cell support cell, as preceding the outer hair cell loss. In contrast to styrene, p-xylene only affects the outer hair cells; spiral ganglion cell injury has not been identified. On the other end of the solvent spectrum, trichloroethylene decreased numbers of spiral ganglion cells, without changes in the hair cells. For both of these latter agents the injury is limited to the middle turns of the cochlea as the initial insult.",

A common clinical complaint is tinnitus, but there are also notable threshold shifts for sound sensation across all frequencies. The stria vascularis is notably edematous; characteristic features include swelling of marginal cells, shrinkage of intermediate cells, and dilation of the intercellular spaces rapidly following intravenous dosing. The loop diuretics directly affect the stria vascularis from the vasculature, resulting in rapid onset. The edema is due to inhibition of ion transport by Na 1 /K 1 -ATPases at the basolateral membranes of marginal cells, resulting in osmotic expansion of those cells and the intercellular spaces. The toxicologic mechanism of hearing loss related to loop diuretics is due to attenuation of the endocochlear potential and not from injury of the hair cells. Macrolide antibiotics, such as erythromycin, produce similar but less severe changes. The mechanism for erythromycin's effects has not been elucidated.",

The concentration of salicylates in the perilymph is directly proportional to serum levels. Salicylates have been shown to produce threshold shifts across all frequencies. The threshold shifts are temporary and reversible and will occur during the dosing phase. Quinine behaves similarly, but is thought to have a different mechanism of action. Salicylates are thought to inhibit the ability of outer hair cells to lengthen. On the other hand, quinine is thought to block Ca 11 or K 1 channels and thereby also prevent outer hair cell motility.

The primary sites of toxicity for these compounds are the outer hair cells, the stria vascularis, and the spiral ganglion cells. Dosing with cisplatin will result in a diminished or absent endocochlear potential, likely the result of the strial toxicity. The stria will have morphologic changes that include edema, bulging, rupture, and, eventually, atrophy of the tissue. The outer hair cells are preferentially lost except for the chinchilla, where inner hair cells are preferentially lost at low doses followed by outer hair cells at higher doses. The spiral ganglion cells undergo changes in parallel with the outer hair cell loss, which, like the solvent styrene, suggests two independent mechanisms of ototoxicity. Spiral ganglion cells and their processes will detach from their myelin, appearing as pericellular clear spaces in histologic sections. The toxicity of cisplatins is thought to be due either to reactive oxygen species triggering cell death, as coadministration with antioxidants and free radical scavengers will ameliorate ototoxicity, or to blockade of outer hair cell transduction channels. Whether due to oxidative damage by reactive oxygen species or the cisplatin itself, single-strand DNA breaks have been identified in the stria vascularis.",

Trimethyltin produces a frequencyspecific and dose-dependent auditory impairment. It preferentially affects the outer hair cells of the basal cochlea. Trimethyltin will produce morphologic changes in as little as 12 hours, with vacuolation of the outer hair cells visible by transmission electron microscopy. The guinea pig has swollen spiral ganglion neurons with separation of the myelin from cell bodies by 24 hours. However, there is no correlating inner hair cell damage, indicating that the spiral ganglion cell change occurs independently of hair cell injury. In contrast, rats have loss of spiral ganglion cells only after complete ablation of the cochlea, indicating that neuronal loss is a \"dying back\" phenomenon in this species.

The target of cyanide is the stria vascularis as there is loss of the endocochlear potential with dosing. The stria vascularis is a highly metabolically active site due to the ion transfer that it performs to maintain this potential. In contrast, carbon monoxide likely acts via a direct effect on the inner hair cells, causing glutamate release from this population, and does not affect endocochlear potential. This release leads to excitotoxic death of auditory neurons. However, excitotoxicity will often not manifest in the spiral ganglion as neuronal degeneration or loss, but instead as rupture of the neuronal processes (which is detectable only by electron microscopy).",
