The potential results in terms of profitability and financial realization, called 'product value proposition' play a crucial role in establishing incentives for investment during and after development. With this review, our goal is to summarize the challenges in taking vaccines against neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) from development through licensure and provide a perspective that these vaccines can have measurable public health and economic profitability and market success. Understanding these processes and its challenges would open the opportunity to accelerate and advance these essential NTD vaccines through the last mile towards licensure and for the delivery to afflicted populations in low-and middle-income countries.",

Recently, due to the competitive, high-risk/high-reward markets, private biopharmaceutical corporations have been relying more on universities as a place to not only to capture the next generation of entrepreneurs but as incubator spaces to facilitate the inception of innovative ideas leading to the discoveries that merit further development. In addition, organizations such as WIPO Re:Search, which is administered by the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) in collaboration with BIO Ventures for Global Health (BVGH), collaborates with a consortium of partners to broker the access of intellectual property (IP) and make it accessible to academic researchers and therefore catalyze the development of new technologies. 2 Even though the translational process or science is similar regardless of the intended intervention (drug, vaccine, device or diagnostic), the decision-making process changes and depends on the 'business case' of the product or intervention. Such business cases are driven by complex scientific, technical, logistical and operational elements ultimately determining the feasibility of crossing the well-known \"valley of death\", the introduction or post-licensure phase, and the effects on profitability and financial realization, also called 'the product value proposition'. 1, 3 For the development of global health technologies needed to prevent, treat or diagnose chronic and debilitating infectious diseases (also known as the neglected tropical diseases or NTDs) mostly affecting people living in extreme poverty, the business cases and value propositions are driven by much different and sometimes unique factors when compared to technologies or interventions with clear profitability and potential for market success.",

However, there are also some viral NTDs, including rabies and the major arbovirus infections, such as dengue and yellow fever. A universal feature of the NTDs is their disproportionate impact on populations living in extreme poverty (Box 1). In addition, all of the NTDs also cause poverty through their adverse health and economic effects, and many of them exhibiting long-term effects on the development of children, productive work capacity, and the success of girls and women. 6 Still another aspect of the NTDs is that they are not generally major causes of mortality. The fact that NTDs do not typically kill means we need to evaluate alternative methods to express their global public health importance. 6 There are several approaches used currently to measure impact. First, most of the major NTDs are widely prevalent including some parasitic helminth infections such as hookworm and schistosomiasis that affects hundreds of millions of people. However, the viral NTDs are an exceptionfor these diseases, the incidence figures are more relevant. Overall, when combined the NTDs may comprise the most common afflictions of the poor. A second metric commonly used to report on the NTDs are disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) referring to years a combination of years lived with disability (YLDs) together with years of life lost (YLLs). Because of their disabling features, the YLDs component of the NTDs DALYs calculations predominates.",

According to the GBD 2017, together they result in 8.5 million DALYs annually, a value that exceeds the DALYs from global cervical cancers. 8 However, many investigators in the community of NTDs scientists and researchers feel that even 8.5 million DALYs is a \"low-ball\" estimate. For example, the current disease burden estimates for hookworm infection may not adequately encompass the cases of severe and moderate anemia resulting from this helminthiasis, 9 while current DALYs estimates for schistosomiasis fail to consider all of the chronic morbidities and end-organ pathologies, as well as increased susceptibility to HIV/AIDs among adolescent girls and women. 10 Thus, a full consideration of all of these aspects of NTDs morbidities could result in at least a tripling of GBD disease burden estimates.",

[21] [22] [23] In addition, the studies have focused on health-care costs, and the impact on human capacity, especially for agricultural workers and women and children, 18, 24 while others look at cost-effectiveness in the context of the PDP ecosystem. [25] [26] [27] Additional efforts have modeled the cost-effectiveness of NTD vaccines, 19, 20 or vaccines linked to chemotherapy. 28, 29 For example, a modeling study to evaluate a hookworm vaccine delivered with preventive chemotherapy has the potential for positive societal benefits, while at the same time be cost-effective. 29 Therefore, more cost-economic studies are needed to investigate the mechanisms by which NTD or \"antipoverty\" vaccines could prevent debilitating disease and improve long-term economic outcomes.

However, while modeling and other evidence support the economic dominance of NTD and antipoverty vaccines, these aspects by themselves have not yet been sufficient to promote substantial and timely global investments. In the end, the long-time horizons, risk of failure, and absence of robust commercial markets make vaccines daunting financial investment prospects. Fueling investor hesitancy are the recent shortcomings and public reactions to newly introduced vaccines for malaria and dengue despite billion-dollar investments from Glaxo Smith Kline (GSK) and Sanofi Pasteur, respectively, 30,31 on top of an accelerating global antivaccine movement. Still another factor is the fact that recent financial \"pull mechanisms\" such as advanced market commitments and priority review vouchers so far benefit only larger for-profit organizations that have the ability to use internal resources in order to advance development of products. These realities have left the remaining vaccine PDPs, often on the outside-lookingin in terms of the investment ecosystem. Despite the hurdles, some efforts are underway to sustain an NTD vaccine framework. As part of the global governance for neglected disease vaccines, the Initiative for Vaccine Research (IVR) of the World Health Organization (WHO), was established in 2010 through a Decade of Vaccines Collaboration (DoVC) 32 to coordinate the development of a Global Vaccine Action Plan (GVAP). 33 The GVAP provides a framework that embraces an R&D and translational science component mostly facilitated by the Product Development for Vaccines Advisory Committee \u2022 Achieving improved health outcomes in the most cost-effective manner possible \u2022 Early inclusion and understanding of LMICs needs and preference \u2022 Incentivizing disease-endemic country ownership \u2022 Building self-reliance and sustainability (PDVAC) 34 and which also takes into consideration a few vaccine initiatives for NTDs.

            "text": "Based on the 2017 assessment report of the GVAP, however, progress continues to be slow and likely most of its 2020 goals may be challenging to reach. 36, 37 For instance, indicator data suggest that vaccine coverage levels are not increasing and diseases outbreaks such as measles and others continue to occur. These challenges are due to multiple global, regional and national issues which will require increased global efforts to promote more R&D, increase immunization campaigns, reduce vaccine hesitancy and address the systemic weaknesses that are limiting equitable vaccine access. 30, 31 Furthermore, and to enhance the knowledge-sharing and the collaborations for the R&D and translational science agenda of the GVAP, WHO, in partnership with the US National Institutes of Health-National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIH-NIAID) and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF) have launched the Global Vaccine & Immunization Research Forum (GVIRF) held every two years. 38 The latest forum, held in 2018, included a special focus on the GVAP goal to develop and introduce new and improved vaccines and technologies with an emphasis on the thought-processes to develop robust business cases with full public health value propositions (FPHVP), which are needed to make decisions for an end to end development, integration and delivery. This initiative, supported by the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) on Immunization, 39 provides the framework starting during the early stages of vaccine product development to ensure a clear definition of the global value of vaccines, allowing accurate prioritization and eventually avoid delays in the uptake especially in (LMICs). 40 Gavi, The Vaccine Alliance, has also made significant progress in support of making vaccines more equitable, affordable and accessible. 41 As an example of these organizations working together, we point to the development, licensure and introduction of MenAfriVac, the vaccine for meningococcal A disease in Africa's meningitis belt that has reduced the incidence of suspected meningitis and epidemic risk, and its effect on confirmed group A meningococcal meningitis. 42, 43 Understanding the FPHVP of NTD vaccines is a necessary step when building the business case primarily because it provides information on the need and the geograhic and population burden. It also assists in setting the appropriate target product profile, product development and regulatory strategy and ultimately proposes the advocacy, policy and public health activities needed to ensure demand, adoption, and implementation practices. 44 In recent years, the scientific and vaccine community of thought-leaders have advocated that a FPHVP should not only include assessments related to individual benefit-risks or individually randomized clinical trials but that the translational science for a public health intervention should be more comprehensive and include the evaluation of the population impact and community benefits-risks. As elegantly described by Gessner et al., the FPHVP of vaccination should include a wider scope of vaccine benefits and not limit the assessment based solely on economic vaccination-set health benefits but rather include the non-health benefits including productivity, health-risk reduction, equity/fairness and fiscal impacts. 44 For the NTDs and emerging or emergent infectious diseases, these processes and decisions have been hampered by the perception that the development costs are substantial and that there is an implicit market failure leading to no or limited financial returns on investments.",

            "text": "For example, for epidemic infectious diseases, a recent study by Gouglas, D. et al. 45 highlighted how for pandemic diseases requiring vaccine stockpiling, the model should include parallel development of multiple candidates for multiple diseases and focus on platforms that have known success through the regulatory pathways. However, even with this approach, the cost to bring a discovery up to Phase 2 could be between $31-68 million. In addition, if consideration is to be given to the logistics and ability of doing efficacy trials the cost estimates to bring these discoveries trough licensure could amount up to $2.5 billion. Furthermore, the probability of success of a vaccine candidate to advance from preclinical to clinical usually ranges between 40% and 50% but to be successful through phase 2 the probability goes down to only 10-13%. 46 The roadmap to assess translational success for a human hookworm and schistosomiasis vaccine requires an in-depth analysis of the technical, operational and profitability drivers. Generally, and for vaccine development programs related to NTDs, these roadmaps have been perceived as fragmented, slow, expensive, and poorly coordinated with important stakeholders such as governments, non-profit and academic entities and sometimes even lacking the engagement of the public. In recent publications, we highlight the technical steps, prospects and lessons learned, used by Texas Children's CVD, in an effort to follow the critical path for the development of human hookworm and schistosomiasis vaccines. [47] [48] [49] Among the greatest challenges of developing vaccines (and other biologics) for neglected and emerging infectious diseases, the mechanisms to secure the funding for the development stages rank high. Multiple attempts have been made to generate \"blueprints\", mostly led by the WHO, on what would be an ideal model to bring new biologics through preclinical and clinical development and through the last mile towards licensure or registration. However, even with many consultations or substantial financial supporting mechanisms provided by organizations such as BMGF, Wellcome Trust, multilateral governments and/or pharmaceutical companies, no ideal model has proven successful to fill all the shortcomings and have certainly not been designed to be a fit-for neglected and emerging infectious diseases nor have been able to bring any targeted vaccines to the eventual objective of successful licensure.",

Their emphasis is on laboratory discoveries that remain stuck within the \"valley of death\". 50 Even if such a discovery arrives into a clinical application, there is no set path towards advanced development. There are substantial NIH funds through the Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) pathway, but these funds are not generally available for non-profit PDPs. More recently, the NIH through the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) has made selective gap funding available to PDPs through their contracting mechanisms. Such funds have it possible to participate in the NIAID-NIH network of Vaccine Trial Evaluation Units (VTEUs), and Good Laboratory Practices (GLP) toxicology contractors, which were critical path elements of advancing our schistosomiasis vaccine. NIAID-NIH has also directly supported the early clinical trials of the hookworm and schistosomiasis vaccines. Outside of NIH, the Department of Defense (DOD) has provided some needed support for earlystage vaccine development through its Congressionally Directed Medical Research Program (CDMRP), which was instrumental in advancing our leishmaniasis vaccine. In the United Kingdom and Europe, promising research into vaccines has been supported through organizations such as the Innovative Medicines Initiative with European Commission funds such as those coming from the Horizon 2020 mechanism, but similarly, as in the US, these mechanisms do not typically bring innovative discoveries into a commercialization path. The new Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) Alliance has chosen to focus mostly on perceived viral pandemic threats, such as Lassa fever, MERS coronavirus infection, and Nipah virus infection rather than the poverty-promoting and debilitating NTDs.",
