A survey of the demographic variables of recrudescent cases was performed (i.e., age and sex), and the most likely source of infection and the dates of illness onset and confirmation were also obtained. By examining the date of confirmation of the purported last case (i.e., the case before the recrudescent case) and the date on which the outbreak was declared to have ended, the following were calculated: (1) the time interval between successive confirmations, (2) the number of days from burial or the second negative testing result of the last case, and (3) the number of days in heightened surveillance.",

Two were male and three were female ( Table 1) . One of the three cases in Liberia was caused by inter-country migration, and therefore may be better stated as recurrence rather than recrudescence (World Health Organization, 2016; Dakaractu, 2016) . That case was associated with viral exposure at a funeral in Guinea (Dakaractu, 2016) . Sexual transmission involving survivors was suspected for three cases (World Health Organization, 2016; Sheri, 2015; Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy, 2016) . Of these, one in Liberia was documented as linked to a survivor who had recovered 164 days before confirmation of the recrudescent case (Dahl et al., 2016) . Similarly, the recrudescent female case in Sierra Leone is believed to have been due to sexual transmission (World Health Organization, 2016; Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy, 2016). In Guinea, three probable unconfirmed deaths considered as consistent with EVD were observed in advance of the confirmed recrudescence on March 17, 2016 (World Health Organization, 2016 Dahl et al., 2016; Dakaractu, 2016) . Virologically, the causative virus of the recrudescence event was demonstrated to be closely related to the virus isolated previously in the same country (Dahl et al., 2016; Dakaractu, 2016) . The route of transmission in a 15-year-old male in Liberia remains unknown, but intra-household transmission during the mother's pregnancy from the immunocompromised mother to the 15-year-old boy was suspected (World Health Organization, 2016; Farge and Giahyue, 2015) .",

While use of a 42-day waiting period posed practical difficulties from 2014 to 2016, the present exercise was not intended to criticize that fixed, transparent criterion. Even with the use of a more objective approach, including serial interval distribution (e.g., as applied for Middle East respiratory syndrome in South Korea (Nishiura et al., 2016) ), this may not have sufficiently captured the involvement of sexual transmission and other reasons for recrudescence.",

For instance, the restriction of movement for cases and exposed individuals-i.e., socially 'costly' interventions-could be ceased through use of a 42-day waiting period. This may not necessarily ensure a long enough waiting time for an uncommon route of infection. Meanwhile, heightened surveillance and the avoidance of risky sexual intercourse should be set at >180 days, i.e. the observed maximum in this study, echoing a study on the transmission network (Mate et al., 2015) ; ideally this duration should be set at 9 months considering the persistence of the virus in semen (Deen et al., 2015) . These are essential to monitor and prevent recrudescence through uncommon routes of transmission. It is intended to investigate the objective determination of the outbreak in a more explicit manner using mathematical modeling techniques.",
