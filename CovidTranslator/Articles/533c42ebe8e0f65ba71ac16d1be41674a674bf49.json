They have been reduced by heterogeneous catalytic hydrogenation in the presence of palladium on charcoal, or with sodium borohydride/palladium on charcoal mixture; unfortunately yields of the reaction products have not been given. 14g Considering the presence of the 4-nitrobenzenesulfonamido function in a molecule, the reduction conditions of 5 0 -deoxy-5 0 -(4-nitrobenzenesulfonamido)thymidine (i.e., sodium dithionite in alkaline medium) has attracted our considerable attention. 4b To the best of our knowledge, this reducing agent has not been employed for the reduction of nucleoside nitro analogs being derivatives of uracil or 5-fluorouracil so far. Therefore, we decided to examine this method for the transformation of the nitro derivatives 5, 6, and 7 into the amino azanucleosides B. Initially, the reduction of the thymine derivatives 5a-c was examined (Scheme 2). Taking into account the NO 2 -isomerism of 5a-c, the reaction was found to be not general. The reduction of 5a (4-NO 2 ) or 5b (3-NO 2 ) with sodium dithionite in alkaline solution at 90\u00b0C was accompanied by hydrolysis of the ester group to give the hydroxy derivatives 8a (59%) or 8b (52%), respectively (Scheme 2, conditions (i). Reduction of the 2-NO 2 isomer 5c under the same conditions afforded a complex mixture, from which the amino derivative 8c was isolated in 5% yield. Modification of the literature procedure by the use of aqueous sodium dithionite at 90\u00b0C resulted in the formation of all isomers 9a-c as pivaloyl esters in yields exceeding 50% (Scheme 2, conditions (ii). The 2-NH 2 isomer 9c was treated with ammonium hydroxide at 70\u00b0C to obtain 8c in 79% yield (Scheme 2, conditions (iii)). Taking into account a kind of nucleobase present in the nitro compounds tested, the dithionite reduction was not general as well. In contrast to the thymine derivatives 5a-c, treating of the nitro derivatives of uracil or 5-fluorouracil, that is, 6a or 7a, respectively, with sodium dithionite in alkaline medium or in aqueous solution did not afford the corresponding amino azanucleosides at all.",

The studies showed that nitro analogs sensitive to reduction conditions, such as 5-fluorouracil derivatives, could be transformed into the corresponding amines by the palladium-catalysed transfer hydrogenation with good yields. Generally, our findings on the reduction of the nucleoside nitro analogs by the heterogeneous transfer hydrogenation may be of help in synthesizing of many amino nucleosides from nitro precursors. ",

High Resolution Mass Spectra (Electrospray Ionisation, ESI) were performed on a Mariner \u00d2 spectrometer in positive ionization mode. The IR spectra were recorded on a Perkin-Elmer System 2000 spectrometer in KBr disc; resolution was 2 cm \u00c01 ; absorption maxima (m max ) are given in cm \u00c01 and quoted as 's' strong, 'm' medium, 'br' broad. In the case of highly overlapped IR bands deconvolution with Grams Research software was preformed. The methodology used for measuring the antiviral activity has been described previously. 22",

The remaining compounds showed no cytotoxicity for Vero cells at concentrations up to 100 lM. The nitro azanucleosides, and among them mainly derivatives of 5-fluorouracil, proved cytotoxic for MDCK cells and CRFK cells.
