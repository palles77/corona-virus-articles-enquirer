First, we show that in the presence of right censoring, when the right end-point of the support of the censoring time is strictly less than the right end-point of the support of the semi-Markov kernel, the transition probability of the semi-Markov process is nonidentifiable, and the estimators proposed in the literature are inconsistent in general. We derive the set of all attainable values for the transition probability based on the censored data, and we propose a nonparametric inference procedure for the transition probability using this set. Second, the conventional approach to constructing confidence bands is not applicable for the semi-Markov kernel and the sojourn time distribution. We propose new perturbation resampling methods to construct these confidence bands. Different weights and transformations are explored in the construction. We use simulation to examine our proposals and illustrate them with hospitalization data from a recent cancer survivor study.",

When h is not absorbing, the sojourn time between h and j has the cumulative distribution function (3) It is often of interest to estimate the semi-Markov transition probability P hj defined in (2) and the sojourn time distribution F hj ( ) in (3). Lagakos et al. (1978) propose two estimators for P hj : a plug-in estimator based on the nonparametric MLE of the semi-Markov kernel, and its normalized version. However, the large sample properties of their estimators have not been carefully studied. In Section 2, we show that the convergent limits (in probability) of the two estimators are different from P hj when the right end-point of the support of the censoring time is strictly less than the right end-point of the support of Q hj (\u00b7). Phelan (1990) proposes an estimator for P hj using the proportion of completely observed \"h j\" transitions among all the uncensored transitions starting from state h. His estimator discards all the incompletely observed transitions due to censoring. He establishes the consistency and asymptotic normality of his estimator under the assumption that all the sojourn times in each of the states have the same distribution regardless of the next state that the process transits to, i.e., (4) where (5) is the distribution of the sojourn time in state h regardless of the next state. However, when assumption (4) is violated, the sojourn time distributions F hj (\u00b7) depend on the next states, and transitions associated with longer sojourn times are more likely to be censored. Discarding the information contained in censored transitions may thus result in a biased estimator for the transition probabilities P hj . This is confirmed by the simulation study reported in Section 4.",

In addition, assumption (4) can be inappropriate because the sojourn time distributions F hj (\u00b7) likely depend on j. This can be exemplified by the study of childhood cancer survivors reported inMcBride et al. (2010) . The CAYACS (Childhood, Adolescent, and Young Adult Survivors) study database includes hospitalization records and death information for its subjects from 1986 to 2000. If we model the hospitalization process by a semi-Markov model with the states \"health\", \"in hospital\", and \"death\", it is unlikely that the sojourn times for transitions from \"health\" to \"in hospital\" have the same distribution as those for transitions from \"health\" to \"death\". In fact, a preliminary analysis of these data under assumption (4) yielded some rather counterintuitive results; see Section 5 for details. Thus, for this example, the existing estimators for transition probabilities can be inconsistent and misleading. This partly motivates this research. In Section 2, we develop a new estimation procedure for the transition probabilities P hj that is valid even when assumption (4) is violated.",

It follows that the LSZ plug-in estimator P hj is not consistent for P hj . For the LSZ normalized estimator P hj , it is easy to verify that the condition in (ii) above holds, provided F hj ( h ) = H h ( h ) for j \u2130.

The weight determines the shape of the bands. By the functional deltamethod (e.g., Andersen et al., 1993) , the process G hj (\u00b7) is asymptotically equivalent to In practice, one often uses a transformation with positive \u03d5\u2032(\u00b7). A natural transformation function is the identity function \u03d5(x) = x. We also consider another transformation function, \u03d5(x) = log(\u2212log(1 \u2212 x)). This is analogous to the function widely used in the literature to improve the coverage probabilities of confidence intervals and confidence bands for a survival function with the Kaplan-Meier estimator. Another advantage of the transformation is that it ensures that the bounds are between 0 and 1, as required for a survival function. We consider two choices for the weight function for the identity transformation function : (10) for the identity transformation function \u03d5(x) = x, and (11) for the transformation function \u03d5(x) = log(\u2212log(1 \u2212 x)), where is a consistent estimator for the asymptotic variance of n 1/2 {Q hj ( ) \u2212 Q hj ( )}.

We used a three-state semi-Markov process with state 1 for \"health\", 2 for \"in hospital\", and 3 for \"death\". We viewed the available hospitalization records as independent realizations of the process subject to right-censoring. We assumed that the censoring was noninformative. Our modelling avoids the potential informative censoring caused by death under the alternating two-state process model. In addition, the formulation allows us to make inferences on the two important transitions: \"health\" to \"death\" and \"in hospital\" to \"death\". There were 60 deaths, 29 of which occurred when the subjects were \"in hospital\". We aimed to estimate the probabilities of transitions between different states and the sojourn time distributions associated with transitions. This may provide important insights into the dynamics of the hospitalization process.",

In fact, the estimates of P 21 and P 23 are the empirical proportions since no subject's data collection was censored when he/she was \"in hospital\". This was mostly because of the relatively short hospital duration (i.e., short sojourn times in state 2 relative to the other sojourn times). Another cause could be a delay in the reporting of hospitalizations, which could lead to informative censoring. There is only a small difference between the hospitalization data and the corresponding portion of the hospitalization data collected until 2004 by the CAYACS team.

The LSZ normalized estimates P 12 and P 13 are close to the corresponding Phelan estimates P 12 and P 13 . However, they may be biased since it is unlikely that the distributions of the sojourn times in the \"health\" state are the same regardless of the next state, which is either \"in hospital\" or \"death\". The possible violation of assumption (4) is shown by Figure 1 , which presents the estimates and confidence bands for the sojourn time distributions starting from \"health\"; these results are obtained from a preliminary analysis using the LSZ normalized estimator. The construction in general gives valid confidence bands, provided assumption (4) holds. However, the confidence bands in Figure 1 indicate an observable difference between distributions F 12 (\u00b7) and F 13 (\u00b7), suggesting that assumption (4) is violated. This explains the discrepancy between the LSZ normalized and the Phelan estimates on one hand, and the estimates obtained by the proposed approach. In fact, Figure 1 indicates that F 12 (\u00b7) \u2264 F 13 (\u00b7), i.e., the transtion from \"health\" to \"death\" is shorter than that to \"in hospital\". This is rather counterintuitive.

The Q 12 (\u00b7) and Q 13 (\u00b7) estimates show that about 50% of subjects survive more than 2.5 years without hospitalization, and less than 1% of the subjects die out of hospital within a year of discharge without further hospitalization. Figure 3 presents the confidence bands for the sojourn time distributions based on our approach. The band for F 12 (\u00b7) is rather wide compared with that for F 21 (\u00b7). This is due to the heavy censoring, which likely results in a rather wide interval [ ]. The wide confidence band for F 13 (\u00b7) reflects the relatively little information in the data on the transition to death. On the other hand, the estimates of F 21 (\u00b7) suggest that about 95% of the hospital durations (i.e., the sojourn time from \"in hospital\" to \"health\") are shorter than 15 days.",

An extension of the HSM model is the modulated semi-Markov model (Cox, 1973) , which handles nonhomogeneity by incorporating a time-dependent covariate in the Cox regression form. A further generalization, the nonhomogeneous semi-Markov process (Iosifescu Manu, 1972) , assumes that its transition intensity involves two time scales, the individual study time since the onset of the process and the duration in the current state.
