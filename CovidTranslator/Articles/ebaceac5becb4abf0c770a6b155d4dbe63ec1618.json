(1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) Despite advances made in therapies such as the use of lung protective ventilation, ARDS continues to be associated with high morbidity and mortality. While long-term outcomes have been studied in patients with mild and moderate ARDS, patients who develop severe ARDS are typically under-represented in clinical trials, and to our knowledge, the long-term outcomes of these patients, including those treated with rescue therapies, have never been studied. (6) (7) (8) (9) Patients with severe ARDS may develop life-threatening refractory hypoxemia that persists despite use of conventional lung protective ventilation strategies. (3) In clinical practice, as an effort to improve oxygenation in these patients, several different \"rescue therapies\" are often used, including inhaled nitric oxide, inhaled epoprostenol and prone position ventilation. (3, 10-12) However, randomized control trials conducted to date utilized rescue therapies as an adjunctive modality to treat ARDS, not as a \"last resort\" intervention for treatment of critical hypoxemia in patients unlikely to survive.

(5) All medical records for patients ages 18 and older, admitted to a HMC ICU between 1/1/2008 and 12/31/2011, who were mechanically ventilated and met criteria for severe ARDS were screened. To reduce heterogeneity in the study population with regard to ARDS risk factors among early or late onset ARDS, criteria were further narrowed to development of a PaO 2 /FIO 2 ratio \u2264 100 within 72 hours of ICU admission. Patients were excluded if their radiographic criteria were not consistent with a diagnosis of ARDS. The radiographic criteria used for diagnosis of ARDS were the presence of bilateral opacities that are not fully explained by effusions, fluid overload, cardiac failure, lung/lobar collapse or nodules. (5) To verify radiographic criteria, screened patients meeting our inclusion criteria were linked to the HMC Acute Lung Injury Registry, a registry that is maintained by the on-site ARDS network study coordinator. Among patients who matched, we randomly reviewed 25% of the chest x-rays to ensure greater than 95% agreement. We reviewed chest x-rays of subjects identified via the electronic search who were not included in the ALI registry, starting with 8 hours prior and up to 24 hours after the study qualifying first PaO 2 /FIO 2 ratio \u2264 100. When needed, manual record review of the patient's chart was used to verify the diagnosis of ARDS by ensuring radiographic findings were not a result of congestive heart failure, pulmonary edema or chronic lung disease. Patients placed on inhaled nitric oxide, inhaled epoprostenol or ventilated in the prone position for the treatment of critical hypoxemia were identified within this cohort.",

Censored data were assumed to be independent of the survival times and censored patients included patients who neither died in the hospital nor were located in the WA State death registry and had a primary residential address outside WA State. Because we only linked with the WA State Death Registry, we conservatively considered non-WA State residents to be lost to followup ( Figure 1 ).
