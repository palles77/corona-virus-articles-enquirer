Briefly, swabs from these samples were inoculated in peptone water broth and Rappaport Vassiliadis broth (Difco) and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 18 h. Then, subcultured on MacConky, XLD (xylose lysine deoxycholate) and EMB (eosin methylene blue) agar plates and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 24-48 h. Regarding to isolation of E. coli, three blue-black colonies (presumptive E. coli) with metallic sheen growing on EMB agar plates were randomly selected from each plate. Regarding to Salmonella spp. all isolates was identified as Salmonella spp. based on their colony morphology on selective media, and the biochemical testing using TSI agar, Urea agar (Christensen), L-lysine decarboxylase, b-galactosidase (ONPG), Voges Proskauer and Indole tests (Edwards and Ewing, 1986) . Also, both E. coli and Salmonella spp. were confirmed biochemically by using API 20E system (BioM\u00e9rieux, Marcy-l'\u00c9toile, France).",

Infection with rotavirus recorded significant association with infection by ETEC K99 (P < 0.001; OR: 2.220; CI 95%: 0.273-1.251). Thus, 13 infected calves with ETEC K99 were also found to be infected by rotavirus.

The prevalence of ETEC K99 was 10.36%. Similar result was reported previously by Wang et al. (2006) . However, higher prevalence was reported by Bendali et al. (1999) and Ach\u00e1 et al. (2004) who reported a prevalence rate of 20.3% and 16%, respectively. Moreover, in India, PCR could identify higher prevalence (20%) in buffalo calves (Singh et al., 2007) . On the contrary, lower prevalence (4.7%, 3.86% and 5.8%) of ETEC K99 was recorded by Akam et al. (2004) , Kanwar et al. (2007) and Oliveira Filho et al. (2007) , respectively. In a study carried out in Egypt and Israel, higher prevalence (23%) was also recorded (Perka et al., 2000) . The differences in the prevalence from those previ-ously recorded may be due to variations in region, management conditions and hygienic measures. Diarrhea caused by ETEC is considered the main infectious disease of newborn calves (Mart\u00edn et al., 2003) ; however, bovine E. coli F5 (K99) seemed to be of minor importance in the investigated population compared with cryptosporidiosis and rotavirus infection (Luginb\u00fchl et al., 2005) . Multivariate logistic regression model enabled to identify the significant risk factors associated with examined bacteria. Age, vaccination of the pregnant dams with Scour Guard 3, colostrum feeding practice, rotavirus infection, and administration of vitamin E/selenium to pregnant dams were found to affect significantly the prevalence of ETEC K99 in diarrheic calves. Calf age significantly affect the prevalence (P < 0.01; OR: 1.812; CI 95%: 0.566-1.769). Thus first week of life is the main age for occurrence. This finding came in accordance with those previously recorded (Bendali et al., 1999; Radostits et al., 2007; Wieler et al., 2007; G\u00fcler et al., 2008) . This finding was also supported by the result recorded by Akam et al. (2004) who found that the susceptibility was higher during the first week of life to E. coli K99 (66.6%). It is suggested that the age-dependent shedding dynamic of the ETEC has to be considered regarding prophylaxis as well as planning intervention studies for calves.",

This result was in agreement with those described by Ganaba et al. (1995) and Crouch et al. (2001) who found that there was a significant increase in the mean specific antibody titre against all three K99, rotavirus, and coronavirus antigens in the serum of the vaccinated animals (even in the presence of pre-existing antibody) which was accompanied by increased levels of protective antibodies to rotavirus, coronavirus and E. coli F5 (K99) in their colostrum and milk for at least 28 days. In a field study, the results of application of Nobi-vac vaccine containing K99 adhesive antigen denoted a significant decrease in the percentage of diarrhea to 5.05% in calves born from vaccinated dams. Furthermore, the K99 antibody titres in the sera of newborn calves differed significantly (P < 0.05) and mean antibody titres increased (Farid et al., 2001) . It was evident that calves in farms, which received colostrum directly from their dames were less frequent to be infected with ETEC (P < 0.01; OR: 5.525; CI 95%: 2.025-15.076) than those hand fed calves. This result coincided with that previously recorded by Barrington et al. (2002) who reported that passively acquired immunity through colostrum, is the major risk factor related to the calf and the occurrence of diarrhea. It was also found that colostral leukocytes obviously contribute to the passive immunity and resistance of the newborn calf against experimental infection by ETEC (Riedel-Caspari, 1993) . The sera of the colostrums fed calves had significantly higher concentrations of antibodies against ETEC mainly of IgG1 specificity on the second day of life as compared to those of the milk substitutes. The sera of the colostrums fed calves contained significantly more IgM on days 2 and 5, and slightly more IgA during the first week . However, colostral leukocytes in the absence of humoral components of the colostrum were not able to prevent fatal losses in the calves due to natural infection, although their influence on immune responses of the calves was detectable in vitro . Moreover, the antibody independent complement activities of serum can be increased substantially by feeding colostral whey concentrate to calves during their first days of life (Rokka et al., 2001) .",

There was a controversy about the association of mastitis and season with the infection. In the present study, the prevalence of ETEC K99 in calves with mastitic dams did not significantly differ from those with non mastitic ones (P = 0.12). This result is supported by Riedel-Caspari (1993) who reported that in calves experimentally infected with ETEC, colostral leukocytes obtained from cows which developed clinical mastitis, showed a marked reduction in the number of shed bacteria. On the other hand, calves directly fed colostrum of mother cows, which had shown infectious mastitis during the dry period before delivery, suffered from diarrhea possibly induced by a pathogenic strain of E. coli (K99). Also, season was not found to be significantly associated with ETEC K99. This finding may be due to presence of narrow variations in the climatic conditions in the examined areas. On contrary, December and March were recorded to have the highest prevalence (Bendali et al., 1999) .",
