However, no single data type may capture influenza activity with optimal sensitivity, specificity, and timeliness, and it is unknown which data types could be most useful for surveillance. We compared the performance of ten types of electronic clinical data for timely detection of influenza clusters throughout the 2007/08 influenza season in northern California. Kaiser Permanente Northern California generated zip code-specific daily episode counts for: influenza-like illness (ILI) diagnoses in ambulatory care (AC) and emergency departments (ED), both with and without regard to fever; hospital admissions and discharges for pneumonia and influenza; antiviral drugs dispensed (Rx); influenza laboratory tests ordered (Tests); and tests positive for influenza type A (FluA) and type B (FluB). Four credible events of localized excess illness were identified. Prospective surveillance was mimicked within each data stream using a space-time permutation scan statistic, analyzing only data available as of each day, to evaluate the ability and timeliness to detect the credible events. AC without fever and Tests signaled during all four events and, along with Rx, had the most timely signals. FluA had less timely signals. ED, hospitalizations, and FluB did not signal reliably. When fever was included in the ILI definition, signals were either delayed or missed. Although limited to one health plan, location, and year, these results can inform the choice of data streams for public health surveillance of influenza.",

If public health officials and health systems can conduct near real-time surveillance to quickly identify clusters of localized excess activity above background seasonal levels, they could improve their situational awareness. During an influenza pandemic, it can be particularly important to identify localized \"hot spots\" of elevated incidence, which can occur before, during, or after a pandemic's national peak [2] . Another potential benefit of routine near real-time surveillance is the early detection of serious respiratory illnesses other than influenza, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Apparent clusters could be evaluated for their potential public health importance, considering data quality, magnitude of effect, and distribution of cases by person, place, and time [3] . Officials might decide to consult with health care providers in affected areas, initiate a traditional public health investigation, reallocate healthcare resources, or target interventions (e.g., vaccination) to reduce disease spread.",

In an integrated health care system with a well-developed electronic health record, there are several other data streams generated in the course of treating patients or billing for services that could potentially be exploited for ILI surveillance. These data typically become available for analysis within about one day. In addition, data can be received from all locations within a catchment area, not just sentinel sites, improving coverage, sample size, and geographical precision. Using automated electronic data can be less labor-intensive than using sentinel provider reports. Syndromic surveillance for ILI has been implemented previously using routinely collected data, most commonly in the emergency department setting [5] [6] [7] [8] , but also using data sources as varied as Internet searches [9, 10] , telephone triage service calls [11] , medication sales [12, 13] , ambulatory care visits [14] , ambulance dispatch data [15] , general practitioner house calls [16] , hospital admissions [17] , and mortality records [18] . It is unknown which of these or other data types could be most useful for identifying localized excess clusters of influenza (in contrast with non-localized seasonal increases).",

Antiviral medications may be dispensed for either treatment or prophylaxis, and while amantadine may be dispensed to treat influenza, it is also used to treat Parkinson's disease. Compared with hospital discharge diagnoses, hospital admissions may be a more timely but less specific indicator of severe influenza-associated illness; however, there are fewer hospitalizations than ambulatory care and emergency department visits for ILI, and the smaller sample size may make it more difficult to detect a localized elevation in influenza activity.",

In brief, a variable-sized cylinder, where the circular base represents space and the height represents time, scans across the study setting and period. The observed number of cases within the cylinders is compared with what would be expected if the spatial and temporal locations of all cases were independent of each other so that there is no space-time interaction. A likelihood ratio statistic identifies the most unusual cylinder. The space-time permutation scan statistic is a non-parametric method that adjusts for purely spatial and purely temporal variation. Of note, the adjustment for purely temporal variation ensures that global (non-localized) seasonal increases, which are emblematic of influenza transmission, are not identified as clusters. Analyses using this scan statistic can be run retrospectively (once, using all data available at the end of the study) or prospectively (e.g., daily, using only data that would have been available as of each surveillance day). The space-time permutation scan statistic has been applied previously to describe the geographical origin and diffusion of calls related to fever as a proxy for influenza in school-age children in the United Kingdom [30] and sentinel data on ILI in Japan [31] .",

A substantial proportion of the population covered by each cluster for a data stream was also covered by one or more clusters for other data streams (results not shown), indicating a high degree of overlap across data streams. All clusters coalesced into six geographically and temporally overlapping events ( Table 3) . Four of these events seemed credible for true excess influenza illness activity, having the following three characteristics: (1) occurrence during a period when >5% of collected specimens statewide tested positive for influenza, according to the California Influenza Surveillance Project [34], (2) detection at p \u2264 0.003 by at least three data streams (consistent evidence across data streams can support the accurate inference of a disease event [22] ), and (3) excess risk of cases in at least six data streams. Two other non-credible events occurred at the beginning and end of the surveillance period (when influenza was not widely circulating) and were detected at higher p-values by fewer data streams. The first credible event of localized excess activity was in the general Bay Area (event #1), followed by Fresno (event #2). Event #3 in Sacramento began while event #2 was ongoing. Finally the Bay Area had a second event (#4). The observed/expected value for the significant clusters within these events were mostly in the range of 1.2-1.5. Three of the ten data streams had no or minimal involvement in these events: FluB, Admissions, and Discharges. Table 4 summarizes the performance of each data stream in the prospective detection of the four credible events of localized excess activity, and Figure 2 displays the first signals in each data stream for each event. The radii for some detected clusters were large (Fig. 2) , encompassing national parks or other areas with low population density. This may happen when the true cluster shape is, for instance, a half moon; in order to expand to include an area in one direction with excess activity, the circle must also extend equally in the other direction.",

Improved understanding of how multiple data streams perform in prospective surveillance can be useful in prioritizing investment of public health resources for developing data types for seasonal and pandemic influenza surveillance. To this end, we compared the performance of ten data streams from one health system in the prospective detection of localized excess activity in part of one state during one year and found that by using only three (AC\u2212F, Tests, and Rx) of the available data streams, timely prospective detection for all four credible events of localized excess influenza activity would have been feasible.",

AC+F and ED\u2212F only detected one event (#3) in a timely manner, while ED +F, FluB, and both inpatient data streams did not detect any. Previous studies have explored whether AC or ED data may be more useful for syndromic surveillance [35] ; in our setting, AC data appeared to be more useful, since the AC data streams yielded signals during credible events while the ED data streams did not or had delayed signals. Tests had the same high sensitivity for all four events as did AC\u2212F, even though the frequency of episodes was much lower for Tests. When fever was included in the ILI syndromic surveillance definition for AC and ED, events were not detected prospectively at all (events #1, 2, and 4) or had a delay to detection (event #3). Other health systems may have the capacity to track ICD-9 codes but not patient temperatures recorded during visits; this study shows that recording temperature may not be necessary for localized excess illness detection. FluB may have been less useful because influenza virus type B was less prevalent or caused less severe illness than type A. ED+F, ED\u2212F, and both inpatient data streams may have been less useful because the relative magnitude of the excess illness event was smaller in these data streams, or healthcare-seeking behavior during times of excess illness events had a smaller effect on these streams.",
