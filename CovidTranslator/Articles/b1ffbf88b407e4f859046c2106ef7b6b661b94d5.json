            "text": "Comorbidities that promote the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD) remain to be uncovered and evaluated in animal models. Because elderly individuals are vulnerable to viral and bacterial infections, these microbial agents may be considered important comorbidities that could potentiate an already existing and tenuous inflammatory condition in the brain, accelerating cognitive decline, particularly if the cellular and molecular mechanisms can be defined. Researchers have recently demonstrated that triggering inflammation in the brain exacerbates tau pathological characteristics in animal models. Herein, we explore whether inflammation induced via viral infection, compared with inflammation induced via bacterial lipopolysaccharide, modulates ADlike pathological features in the 3xTg-AD mouse model and provide evidence to support the hypothesis that infectious agents may act as a comorbidity for AD. Our study shows that infection-induced acute or chronic inflammation significantly exacerbates tau pathological characteristics, with chronic inflammation leading to impairments in spatial memory. Tau phosphorylation was increased via a glycogen synthase kinase-3\u2424-dependent mechanism, and there was a prominent shift of tau from the detergentsoluble to the detergent-insoluble fraction. During chronic inflammation, we found that inhibiting glycogen synthase kinase-3\u2424 activity with lithium reduced tau phosphorylation and the accumulation of insoluble tau and reversed memory impairments. Taken together, infectious agents that trigger central nervous system inflammation may serve as a comorbidity for AD, leading to cognitive impairments by a mechanism that involves exacerbation of tau pathological characteristics.",

            "text": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder and the leading cause of dementia, afflicting \u03fe35 million individuals worldwide. The AD brain displays several characteristic pathological features, including the buildup of amyloid plaques composed of amyloid-\u2424 (A\u2424), which can also accumulate intracellularly, and neurofibrillary tangles composed of hyperphosphorylated tau protein. 1 Neuronal loss, dystrophic neurites, and dendritic spine loss are other critical changes that are well documented in AD. In addition, inflammation, as evidenced by reactive glial cells surrounding amyloid plaques, is consistently observed in the AD brain. [2] [3] [4] The factors and molecular mechanisms that affect the pathogenesis of AD still remain largely unknown, although it is widely accepted that this disorder is multifactorial. Certain factors and insults, such as hypoxia, brain ischemia, and stress, that dysregulate brain homeostasis and physiological functions may increase the susceptibility of developing AD (as comorbid factors). 5, 6 Thus, decades of research in epidemiology and postmortem AD brains has suggested that viral or bacterial infections may contribute to the onset of AD. 7, 8 With improved quantitative and analytical methods, several viral and bacterial genes, including herpes simplex virus, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Helicobacter pylori, have been isolated from AD brains; in some reports, 9 -11 the presence of these genes in AD brains is statistically significantly higher than in non-AD brains. Evidence from both in vivo and in vitro studies indicates that infections significantly exacerbate AD-like pathological changes, sug-gesting that infection-mediated alterations (ie, altered immune response) in the brain may increase the susceptibility of developing AD later in life. 12, 13 Brain inflammatory responses may contribute to this pathogenic process. 14 -16 Neuroinflammation in the AD brain likely plays both beneficial and harmful roles. 17 For example, chronic inflammation and cytokine up-regulation induce tau hyperphosphorylation in prepathological 3xTg-AD mice. 15 In addition, studies 18 -21 indicate that inflammatory processes are involved in clearing or degrading A\u2424 depositions. The deficiency of CCR2, a chemokine receptor, impairs microglia accumulation and increases A\u2424 deposition in amyloid precursor protein (APP)-transgenic mice, indicating a role for microglia in regulating A\u2424 accumulation. 22, 23 On the other hand, chronic lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced neuroinflammation increases intraneuronal A\u2424 load in transgenic mice, 16, 24 possibly through the release of proinflammatory cytokines and other toxic species 25, 26 and the subsequent exacerbation of AD-related pathological features. 27, 28 Collectively, infection and neuroinflammation may well be linked to AD and may play key roles in the accelerated onset and development of the disease.",

Viral infection by mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) or LPS to mimic a bacterial infection induced robust, but transient, neuroinflammation; exacerbated tau pathological characteristics; and compromised cognitive function in aged 3xTg-AD mice. LPS injection caused an increase in tau phosphorylation and its partition to the detergent-insoluble fraction, indicating a buildup of aggregated tau in neurons; the aberrant activation of glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3\u2424 was concomitantly detected in these mice. GSK-3\u2424 appears to be one of the main cellular mediators that is activated by infection-induced inflammation, underlying the increased tau pathological characteristics. To determine whether GSK-3\u2424 was a necessary mediator of the inflammation-induced changes in tau, we treated mice with lithium, a potent GSK-3\u2424 inhibitor, and found that its inhibition reversed both the tau hyperphosphorylation and its shift into the insoluble fraction. Significantly, treatment with lithium also led to an improvement in the cognitive phenotype. Together, our data strongly suggest that viral-or bacterial-mediated infections may act as critical comorbid factors and that tau pathological features are accelerated.",

The maze was located in a room containing several simple visual extramaze cues. To reduce stress, mice were placed on the platform for 10 seconds before the first training trial. Mice were trained to swim to a 14-cm diameter circular clear Plexiglas platform submerged 1.5 cm beneath the surface of the water and invisible to the mice while swimming. The platform location was selected randomly for each mouse but was kept constant for each individual mouse throughout training. For each trial, the mouse was placed into the tank at one of four designated starting points in a pseudorandom order. Mice were allowed to find and escape onto the submerged platform. If a mouse failed to find the platform within 60 seconds, the mouse was manually guided to the platform and allowed to remain there for 10 seconds. Afterward, each mouse was placed into a holding cage under a warming lamp for 25 seconds until the start of the next trial. To ensure that memory differences were not because of lack of task learning, mice were given four trials a day for as many days as were required to train the lithium-untreated and lithium-treated 3xTg-AD mice to criterion (\u03fd20 seconds mean escape latency before the first probe trial was run). To control for overtraining, probe trials were run for each group, both as soon as they reached group criterion and after all groups had reached criterion. Retention of the spatial training was assessed 1.5 hours and again 24 hours after the last training trial. In the probe trials, the platform was removed from the pool and mice were monitored by a ceiling-mounted camera directly above the pool during the 60-second period. All trials were recorded for subsequent analysis. The parameters measured during the probe trial included the following: i) time spent in the target quadrant (the quadrant where the platform was located), ii) latency to cross the platform location, and iii) number of platform location crosses. Target quadrants varied between mice within a group to control for potential differences in the salience of extramaze cues.",

Both NonTg and 3xTg-AD mice were infected with MHV via a single unilateral injec-tion into the hippocampus, and this induced a robust neuroinflammatory response characterized by increased infiltration of macrophages (CD45 High or F4/80 \u03e9 ), activation of microglia (CD45 Low , F4/80 \u03e9 , or major histocompatibility complex class II positive), and infiltration of T cells (CD4 \u03e9 or CD8 \u03e9 ) (see Supplemental Figure S1 , A-C, at http://ajp.amjpathol.org). There was no significant difference in mortality between infected 3xTg-AD (25.4%) and NonTg (20.6%) mice. These infected mice successfully controlled viral replication, and viral titers within the brains were reduced to lower than detectable levels (approximately 100 plaque-forming units per gram of tissue) by day 12 p.i. (see Supplemental Figure S1D at http:// ajp.amjpathol.org). These findings indicate that no differences exist between aged 3xTg-AD and age-matched NonTg mice in limiting viral replication within the CNS. In support of this observation, no differences were detected in interferon-\u2425 secretion by resident cells within the CNS, as measured by major histocompatibility complex class II staining on resident microglia (see Supplemental Figure  S1B at http://ajp.amjpathol.org), and in virus-specific T cell infiltration in the CNS, as measured by interferon-\u2425 secretion by peptide-stimulated T cells (see Supplemental Figure S1E at http://ajp.amjpathol.org).",

Based on a previous study 15 in which LPS was injected into prepathological 3xTg-AD mice, and the results previously described, including use of a single MHV infection or long-term LPS injections into aged 3xTg-AD mice, we found that chronic inflammation does not appear to significantly affect the onset or progression of A\u2424 pathological characteristics.",

Specifically, phosphorylation at the AT100 (Thr212/Ser214) site was significantly increased twofold compared with saline controls. In the LPS-treated mice, phosphorylation at Ser214 was significantly increased by 30%, whereas phosphorylation at Thr212 was decreased. Studies 35 have indicated that phosphorylation at Ser214 may inhibit further phosphorylation at Thr212, producing the pattern of phosphorylation observed herein. Favoring phosphorylation at Ser214 is also consistent with an increase in reactivity with the AT100 epitope because phosphorylation at Ser214 is required for formation of the AT100 epitope. 35 In addition, AT8 \u03e9 neurons were markedly increased (\u03fe10 times) in mice exposed to chronic inflammation (Figure 3, C and D) .",

On the other hand, we detected a significant decrease in levels of GSK-3\u2424 phosphorylated at Ser9 in LPS-treated mice ( Figure 5, A and B) . Radioactive kinase assays further confirmed that GSK-3\u2424 activity was significantly increased by 25.2% in mice exposed to chronic inflammation, whereas there was no significant difference in cdk5 activity between saline-and LPS-treated mice ( Figure 5C ). This discrepancy between young and aged 3xTg-AD mice may be the result of a different temporal activation pattern of cdk5 and GSK-3\u2424 in the brain. At least in the 3xTg-AD mouse model, cdk5/ p25 activation was detected at a younger age, peaked at approximately 12 months, and then decreased during aging, whereas GSK-3\u2424 activity increased in an agedependent manner up to the age of 15 months (see Supplemental Figure S5 , A and B, at http://ajp.amjpathol. org). Our findings collectively show that infection-induced inflammatory responses in the brain play a key role in exacerbating tau pathological features through dysregulated kinase activity, particularly mediated by GSK-3\u2424.",

In comparison, age-matched NonTg mice that received LPS in the same manner also exhibited a delayed latency to cross the platform location at the 24-hour probe trial, yet to a much lower degree than that in LPS-treated 3xTg-AD mice (see Supplemental Figure  S6A at http://ajp.amjpathol.org). The number of platform crosses was, unlike 3xTg-AD mice, not different between sham and LPS treatments in NonTg mice (see Supplemental Figure S6B at http://ajp.amjpathol.org). Endogenous tau phosphorylation and insoluble tau levels were concomitantly increased in LPS-treated NonTg mice (see Supplemental Figure S6C at http://ajp.amjpathol.org). Our data suggested that cognition was much more affected in 3xTg-AD mice, possibly because of the presence of pathological mutant tau and the exacerbation of tau pathological characteristics. These results were, in part, confirmed by the fact that lithium treatment reversed the behavioral impairments induced by chronic inflammation. Mice treated with both lithium and LPS performed comparably to salinetreated animals in the MWM. In contrast, LPS-treated mice perform significantly worse than saline controls. In addition, mice treated with both lithium and LPS have significantly less latency to cross the platform compared with LPStreated mice in the probe trials (Figure 8 , B and C).",

The present study provides novel evidence that chronic inflammation, as triggered by viral infection or LPS injection, initiates and contributes to the progression of tau pathological features and cognitive impairment in aged 3xTg-AD mice. We observed increased tau phosphorylation at several epitopes, including Ser202/ Thr205 (AT8) and Ser396/Ser404 (PHF-1), and increased detergent-insoluble tau accumulation in LPS-injected mice. Interestingly, however, we were not able to detect tanglelike pathological features of tau in these mice at this age. The increase in detergent-insoluble tau or somatodendritic tau accumulation after the administration of infectious agents may be mediated by increased formation of pretangle tau, such as protofibrillar or oligomeric tau intermediates, that may play an important role in neuronal loss, synaptic dysfunction, and cognitive impairments. 38 These changes in tau pathological characteristics were associated with dysregulation of GSK-3\u2424 kinase activity, consistent with numerous mouse models that show that GSK-3\u2424 becomes the primary modulator of tau phosphorylation as mice age. 39 -41 Interestingly, in contrast to previous observations in young prepathological 3xTg-AD mice, we find a significant decrease in p35, a coregulator of cdk5, without an increase in the generation of p25; cdk5 activity was decreased in older mice with chronic inflammation. As mice age, cdk5 becomes a regulator of GSK-3\u2424 activity, with studies 39, 41 showing that increased cdk5 activity can induce phosphorylation of GSK-3\u2424 at the Ser9 site, leading to inhibition of GSK-3\u2424 activity. GSK-3\u2424 is not considered a direct substrate for cdk5, but cdk5 may mediate its actions through either up-regulation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt pathway or inhibition of protein phosphatases. 41, 42 Thus, the decreased cdk5 activity observed in older mice with chronic inflammation may be partly responsible for the significant increase in GSK-3\u2424 activity observed.",

            "text": "Dysregulation of kinase activity and subsequent tau hyperphosphorylation have been implicated to be important in the development of tau aggregates and ultimately the classic tangles observed in the AD brain. 43 We demonstrate that inflammation is, in part, responsible for altered kinase activity in the brain, further exacerbating tau pathological features in neurons. The inhibition of GSK-3\u2424 by lithium and subsequent blockade of tau phosphorylation attenuated detergent-insoluble tau and improved cognitive function in these mice. Previously, no significant rescue effect of lithium was found on cognition of aged (16 months) 3xTg-AD mice. 44 The discrepancy with our present study may be, in part, because of the ages of mice, which significantly affect both AD-like neuropathological and cognitive impairments. The age we used in this study (11 to 13 months) may still be young enough so that cognitive impairments can be reversed by modulating pathological changes. Thus, our data indicate that tau phosphorylation is an important process for the formation of pretangle tau intermediates and tau aggregation or neurofibrillary tangles. In addition, our data suggest that GSK-3\u2424 hyperactivity and the subsequent increase in phospho-tau accumulation may partly contribute to the early cognitive impairment in 3xTg-AD mice. Hyperphosphorylation of tau is known to reduce its stability, which can, in turn, cause axonal transport deficits. 45, 46 The integrity of the axonal transport system is crucial for maintaining proper synapse function. 47 Deficits in synapse function secondary to the hyperphosphorylation of tau may underlie the cognitive dysfunction observed in mice with chronic inflammation. A recent study 48 showed that inhibiting GSK-3\u2424 activity or genetically reducing GSK-3\u2424 levels prevents memory reconsolidation. In contrast, our data show that long-lasting elevated GSK-3\u2424 activity impairs learning and memory, consistent with a study 49 showing memory impairments on short-term hyperactivation of GSK-3\u2424. Thus, although normal activity of GSK-3\u2424 may be necessary for memory consolidation, hyperactive or long-lasting active GSK-3\u2424 and consequent hyperphosphorylation of tau is likely detrimental to learning and memory.",

The immune responses are altered and become dysfunctional during aging. 55 Therefore, infectious agents may not be as detrimental in young individuals when the immune responses can be properly regulated, but this becomes more deleterious in older individuals. However, the LPS injection used in our study does not completely mimic bacterial infections, and some of its course of action may be different. For example, the course of duration is much shorter compared with typical bacterial infections, and the lack of bacterial foci may influence the host immune responses. Despite these differences, LPS is still widely used as a surrogate for bacterial infection, and its actions on inflammatory responses are robust and comparable to bacterial infections. Overall, we believe this work is significant because it shows that certain microbial infections may act as comorbid factors for AD, which, based on the evidence we observed herein, appear to act mainly by affecting tau pathological features and exacerbating cognitive decline.",
