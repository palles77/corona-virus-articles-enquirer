            "text": "Alveolar Type II (ATII) cells are important targets for seasonal and pandemic influenza. To investigate the influenza-induced innate immune response in those cells, we measured the global gene expression profile of highly differentiated ATII cells infected with the influenza A virus at a multiplicity of infection of 0.5 at 4 hours and 24 hours after inoculation. Infection with influenza stimulated a significant increase in the mRNA concentrations of many host defense-related genes, including pattern/pathogen recognition receptors, IFN, and IFN-induced genes, chemokines, and suppressors of cytokine signaling. We verified these changes by quantitative real-time RT-PCR. At the protein level, we detected a robust virusinduced secretion of the three glutamic acid-leucine-arginine (ELR)negative chemokines CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11, according to ELISA. The ultraviolet inactivation of virus abolished the chemokine and cytokine response. Viral infection did not appear to alter the differentiation of ATII cells, as measured by cellular mRNA and concentrations of surfactant proteins. However, viral infection significantly reduced the secretion of surfactant protein (SP)-A and SP-D. In addition, influenza A virus triggered a time-dependent activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signaling in ATII cells. The inhibition of this pathway significantly decreased the release of infectious virus and the chemokine response, but did not alter virusinduced cell death. This study provides insights into influenzainduced innate immunity in differentiated human ATII cells, and demonstrates that the alveolar epithelium is a critical part of the initial innate immune response to influenza.",

However, we recently developed a system to study respiratory viruses with primary cultures of adult human alveolar type II (ATII) cells (5) . These cells produce surfactant, transport sodium from the apical surface into the interstitium to keep the alveoli relatively free of fluid, restore the epithelium after injury, and participate in the innate immune response. Our initial study with influenza infection in human ATII cells (6) showed that these cells secrete proinflammatory chemokines such as IL-8, IL-6, CCL5, and IFN-l1 (IL-29), a Type III IFN, in response to infection with influenza (6) . However, this approach was narrowly focused, and did not examine many other components of the innate immune response.",

Of these, the PI3k/Akt pathway may be the most specific for influenza, and is the most controversial (7) . During infection with influenza, the PI3k/Akt pathway was initially described as an antiviral pathway, activated by IFN and participating in the regulation of mRNA translation in response to IFNs (7, 8) . However, PI3k/Akt also favors the virus and promotes viral replication. For example, in A549 cells, a lung cancer cell line, the activation of PI3k/Akt was reported to promote viral entry and propagation (9) . In the early stage of viral infection, PI3k interacts with viral nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) to prevent premature apoptosis, and in the late stage of infection, PI3k promotes apoptosis to facilitate the release of virus from infected cells (7, 10) . Little is known about the role of the PI3k/Akt pathway in the response by human ATII cells to influenza.",

We verified changes in mRNA concentrations of pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs), IFN, IFN responsive genes, chemokines, cytokines, suppressors of cytokine signaling (SOCS), and surfactant genes. We found that IAV induced an extensive innate immune response in human ATII cells as early as 4 hours post inoculation (PI), which indicates that these cells play an important role in the early response to infection. Interestingly, infection with IAV did not alter mRNA and protein concentrations of surfactant proteins. However, the infection significantly reduced the secretion of surfactant protein (SP)-A and SP-D from virus-infected cells. To our knowledge, this is the first report of genome-wide changes induced by IAV in differentiated human ATII cells, which are important targets for both seasonal and pandemic flu. Because of the specific interaction of NS1 with the PI3k pathway, we further determined the effects of inhibiting the PI3k pathway on viral infection. PI3k signaling was found to be important for the production of chemokines and for the release of infectious virus, but not for IAV-induced cell death.",

Among these, CXCL11 and CXCL10 were the two genes with a more than 1,000-fold induction at both time points, as depicted in Figure 3A . An increase was also evident in cytokines IL-6, IL-32, and IL-15 (Figures 2A and B) . Infection with IAV also significantly increased the mRNA concentrations of three SOCS genes (SOCS1, SOCS2, and SOCS3) in ATII cells. However, the degree of increase was much lower than in the chemokine and IFN genes (Figures 2 and 3B ). Moreover, infection with IAV increased IFN gene expression, as shown by IFNB1 (IFN-b) and three IFN-l family genes (IL-29, IL-28A, and IL-28B) (Figures 2A, 2B, and 3D ). Consistent with our previous results (6), infection with IAV did not induce any IFN-g or IFN-a genes in ATII cells. As reported previously (6), we detected a significant amount of IL-29, but were unable to detect IFN-b protein in IAV-infected ATII cells with commercially available ELISAs (Figure 4 and data not shown). In contrast, we detected a specific increase in the IFN-a group genes in AMs from the same patient (data not shown). These results further demonstrate that IFN-l is the main IFN protein produced by ATII cells in response to infection with IAV (6) . As shown in Figures 2C and 2D , infection with IAV stimulated the high transcription of genes related to IFN signaling (which include PRRs) and IFN-induced genes such as IFN-induced protein with tetrotricopeptide repeats (IFITs), guanylate binding protein, and the well-known antiviral genes myxovirus (influenza virus) resistance 1 (MX1) and 2959 Oligoadenylates (OASs). Among three well known PRRs, the mRNA of retinoic-acid-inducible gene 1 (RIG-I), also termed DDX58, was increased the most, with a more than 100-fold increase after viral infection. Melanoma differentiation associated gene-5 (MDA-5), also termed IFIH1, and Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) were significantly increased ( Figure 3C ). Among antiviral genes, IFIT1, also named ISG56, was increased more than 1,000-fold by infection with IAV at 4 hours PI, and the increase continued to 24 hours PI ( Figure 3E) . We also detected a significant increase of ISG56 protein according to Western blotting and immunofluorescent staining as early as 4 hours PI (data not shown).",

As shown in Figure 5 , IAV (MOI 5 5) increased the phosphorylation of Akt as early as 15 minutes after inoculation at both serine 473 and threonine 308, and the activation reached a peak at 24 hours PI. At MOI of 0.5, we observed similar effects (data not shown). IAV also induced the phosphorylation of ERK in ATII cells. However, we did not detect a significant activation of stress-activated protein kinase/ c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase signaling (data not shown). Treatment with the PI3k-specific inhibitor LY294002 significantly decreased the secretion of ELR-negative chemokines CXCLs 9-11, but not IL-29 ( Figure 6A ). The inhibition of PI3k also significantly decreased the release of infectious virus from infected ATII cells at 24 hours PI ( Figure 6B ). The ERK inhibitor PD98059 decreased the secretion of three ELR-negative chemokines to a lesser degree than the PI3k inhibitor, but did not reduce viral release (Figures 6A and 6B) . We did not find any effects of either inhibitor on the percentage of cells infected with influenza (data not shown). However, as indicated in Figure 6C , more nuclear accumulation of viral nucleoprotein (NP) may occur in PI3k inhibitor-treated cells than in cells inoculated with PR/8 alone or in ERK inhibitor-treated ATII cells.",

Therefore, we evaluated the activation of caspase-3 and its downstream molecule PARP in IAV-infected human ATII cells at 24 hours PI by Western blotting. As shown in Figure 7A , we detected a consistently active form of caspase-3 (cCasp3) in live virus-infected cells only, although we did not see a change of caspase-3 mRNA attributable to viral infection (data not shown). Significant variation was evident in the activation of PARP between patients. However, the ratio of cleaved/ uncleaved forms of PARP (cPARP/PARP) was much higher in live virus-infected wells than in control wells ( Figure 7B) . No difference was evident between UV-inactivated virus-infected cells and control cells, and we did not see any difference with or without treatment using the PI3k inhibitor. These results suggest that infection with IAV activated caspase-3-involved cell death, independent of the activation of PI3k signaling. In addition, UV-inactivation abolished viral NP expression, but the PI3k inhibitor did not (Figure 7) , further supporting the conclusion that PI3k inhibition did not alter the rate of infection, as shown in Figure 6C .",

In addition, alveolar and bronchial epithelial cells provide an important part of the innate immune system in the lung.

            "text": "In the pesent study, we slightly modified the system described previously (5, 6) , so that cells formed an intact monolayer but retained their Type II phenotype. We used a genome-wide approach to define more completely the innate immune response of ATII cells to IAV. To our knowledge, this is the first report to investigate global gene expression in differentiated human ATII cells in response to a viral infection. At this level of infection (MOI 5 0.5), IAV does not appear to alter the differentiation of ATII cells, as evidenced by the absence of change in mRNA and protein levels of surfactant genes, ABCA3, and pepsinogen II at 24 hours PI. However, infection decreased the secretion of SP-A and SP-D ( Figure E1 ), which are important pulmonary collectins (16) . Because of the well-known functions of SP-A and SP-D against diverse microbes (16, 17) , this result suggests that lowdose infection with IAV may weaken the host defense of the lung to other pathogens, and perhaps promote secondary infections. The secretion of chemokines and cytokines to recruit circulating neutrophils, mononuclear cells, and lymphocytes into the lung comprises an important strategy by the host to clear lung infection. Chemokines constitute a superfamily of small proteins, and can be divided into four functionally distinct groups: CC, CXC, C, and CX3C. CXC chemokines can be further subdivided into ELR-positive and ELR-negative, according to the existence of a specific amino-acid sequence of glutamic acid-leucine-arginine. ELR-positive chemokines, such as IL-8, specifically induce the migration of neutrophils. ELR-negative CXC chemokines, such as CXCL10, tend to be chemoattractants for lymphocytes. We and other researchers reported that alveolar epithelial cells secrete CCL5, IL-8, IL-6, CCL2, macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1, and CXCL10 in response to infection with IAV (18, 19) . In this study, infection with IAV significantly increased or induced the expression of many genes from all four chemokine groups in human ATII cells, and the effect was dependent on viral replication. Specifically, infection with IAV induced all three ELR-negative CXC chemokines, CXCL9-11, at both the mRNA and protein levels. These three CXC chemokines bind to a common receptor chemokine (C-X-C motif) receptor 3 (CXCR3), and activate multiple functions of CD8 1 T cells. Recently, the importance of CXCR3 signaling was shown in the pathogenesis of several viral infections, including influenza (20) (21) (22) (23) (24) . Among those chemokines, CXCL10 was highly expressed in avian flu virus H5N1-infected ferrets, macaques, monkeys, and human cells (19) (20) (21) , and is viewed as a prognostic marker for several viral infections (23) (24) (25) (26) . The actual role of CXCL11 in viral infections remains unclear. In mice during infection with IAV, the peak level of CXCL11 mRNA coincides with the peak of viremia, and the CXCL11 protein was reported to inhibit viral growth (27) . CXCL11 also directly inhibits respiratory adenovirus serotypes Ad3 and Ad5 (28) . The induction of CXCL9 was also reported in similar viral infections (21) (22) (23) 25) . Interestingly, recent investigations indicate a differential regulation of CXCL9-11 chemokines in hepatitis C virus in-fection, and the differential expression of CXCL9-11 correlates with different disease phenotypes (21, 25) . Therefore, the role of each CXCR3 chemokine in IAV infection in human ATII cells deserves further study. In addition, human fetal ATII cells express the ELR-negative chemokine receptor CXCR3. All three CXCR3 ligands, and especially CXCL11, can induce epithelial cell chemotaxis and proliferation and perhaps epithelial wound repair during the resolution of viral infections (29) . CXCL11 also stimulates re-epithelization of the skin during wound repair (30) . In addition, recent reports showed that ELR-negative chemokines have antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria (31, 32) . Taken together, the high induction of ELR-negative chemokines in ATII cells suggests that this family of proteins may play an important role in viral infection, secondary bacterial infection after influenza, and epithelial repair in the human lung.",

ELR-negative chemokines are known to be induced by IFN, and infection with IAV induces an abundant IFN response, especially by IFN-l1 (IL-29) (6) (Figures 3 and 4) . Treatment with IL-29 also induces the secretion of CXCL10 in human Type II cells (data not shown). To investigate the possible mechanism of the PI3k inhibitor in virus-induced chemokine regulation, we measured the mRNA expression of IFN and SOCS genes in inhibitor-treated cells, and did not find significant differences between inhibitortreated cells and control cells. These results suggest that the inhibition of CXCL9-11 production in IAV-infected ATII cells by the PI3k inhibitor may be more attributable to the direct decrease of viral propagation, and independent of IFN signaling in human ATII cells.",

TLR3 and TLR7 and RNA helicases RIG-I and MDA-5 are the bestcharacterized sensors of RNA viruses, including influenza (33). We compared the expression of these four PRRs in ATII cells and AMs from the same patient. In ATII cells, infection with IAV increased the mRNA of three PRRs: RIG-I, MDA-5, and TLR3 (Figures 2 and 3) . The increase of RIG-I was most prominent compared with MDA-5 and TLR3, suggesting that RIG-I may be the main PRR responsible for stimulating the production of IFN in ATII cells. TLR7 was increased by viral infection in AMs, but not ATII cells (data not shown). Consistent with our previous study (6) , IAV stimulated the production of predominant Type III IFN, as also observed in human ATI-like cells (34) . Infection also upregulated many IFN-stimulated genes, including the well-known antiviral MX1, OAS, and ISG genes (Figures 2 and 3) . Among those IFN-stimulated genes, ISG56 showed the largest increase at the mRNA level after infection with IAV in ATII cells ( Figure 3E ). We also detected the induction of ISG56 protein as early as 4 hours after infection with IAV or treatment with IFN-l1 (IL-29) (data not shown). Although ISG56 is one of the first identified proteins induced by viruses and Type I IFN (35) , the function of ISG56 remains unclear. ISG56 was implicated in antiviral actions against hepatitis C virus, West Nile virus, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, and human papillomavirus (36) (37) (38) . However, a recent study by Li and colleagues (39) suggests that ISG56 is a negative regulator of IFN production and antiviral response.",

            "text": "NS1 is a critical protein that IAV uses to hijack host defense factors (45) . NS1 suppresses the IFN response by interfering with signaling inducers and mediators (42, 46, 47) . Although PI3k/Akt is an important pathway involved in the regulation of cell growth, proliferation, and survival (7), during infection with influenza, this pathway is used by NS1 to promote infection (7, 45, 48) . To investigate whether PI3k plays an important role in influenza infection in differentiated ATII cells, we measured the phosphorylation of Akt, a commonly used marker for the activation of PI3k, in virus-infected cells. Consistent with other studies (8, 48) , we detected a time-dependent activation of PI3k signaling in IAV-infected ATII cells ( Figure 5 ). The inhibition of PI3k by chemical inhibitor LY294002 significantly decreased the release of infectious viral particles ( Figure 6B ), suggesting that the activation of PI3k is required for the release of progeny virus. However, the inhibition of PI3k did not inhibit viral infection or viral NP protein expression ( Figures 6C and 7) , implying that PI3k may not be important for viral entry into human ATII cells. This result differs from that in a previous report on IAV-infected A549 cells, where the inhibition of PI3k decreased the expression of NP (8) . In addition, infection with IAV induced the activation of caspase-3 and the cleavage of its downstream protein PARP in ATII cells. In contrast with previous reports that NS1 activates PI3k to prevent cell apoptosis (49) , our results ( Figure 7) suggest that PI3k may not be involved in IAV-induced cell death in ATII cells, a finding supported by Shin and colleagues (8) and Jackson and colleagues (50) . The controversial finding of PI3k signaling in IAV infection in our study and elsewhere suggests the complexity of the influenza-induced innate immune response. Although the precise role of PI3k/Akt signaling needs to be determined further, our results from highly differentiated human ATII cells shed light on the mechanism of human lung alveolar epithelium in response to infection with IAV.",

Infection with IAV induced a robust innate immune response, with a predominant induction of ELR-negative CXC chemokines in human ATII cells. Infection with IAV at MOI of 0.5 did not appear to alter the differentiation of ATII cells, but it reduced the secretion of SP-A and SP-D. The PI3k/Akt pathway appears to play a critical role in virus-induced chemokines response and virus release, but may not involve virusinduced cell death in ATII cells.",
