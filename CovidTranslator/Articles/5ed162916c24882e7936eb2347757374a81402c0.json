There are specific IBC guidelines promulgated by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) involving work with recombinant DNA [1] . There have also been recent guidelines issued by the National Biodefense working groups and others on \"gain of function\" (GoF) experiments and the NIH on Dual use Research of Concern (DURC) [2] . The IBC may be directly involved in approving or referring these experiments to the NIH for approval. Other traditional roles for the IBC include review and approval of all work with infectious agents, work with biologics including nanoparticles, infection Ensuring National Biosecurity 170 of animals or plants and/or microbiological work including projects in the classroom laboratory. Broadly, the IBC serves to ensure that biological experiments conducted within their Institute are within regulatory guidelines to protect the Institute from financial and/or legal liabilities and also that laboratory workers conduct these activities as safely as is reasonable in line with current safety recommendations. In other words the primary questions the IBC should ask when reviewing protocols are \"Is it safe?\" and \"Is it legal?\" A review of the regulatory requirements of the IBC is covered in Chapters 2, 4, and 5 of this text.",

            "text": "Beginning in 2003 with the expansion of the national biocontainment capabilities in both facilities and personnel, more IBCs had to address new regulations on the socalled select agents [3, 4] . Select agents are those bacteria, viruses, and toxins deemed dangerous enough that they require special biosafety and biosecurity precautions and facilities. For instance, they require extra safety training and procedures and background checks to vet the persons working with or with access to these agents. Because of these additional requirements, IBC committees had to expand their capabilities and expertise to adequately address review of protocols involving select agent research. Not all biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) or 4 (BSL-4) pathogens or toxins are select agents but in most cases all select agents require containment in the appropriate BSL3/4 laboratory. When infectious work involves animal models of disease, most select agent studies must be performed in animal biosafety level 3, 3-Ag, or 4 facilities (ABSL-3/3-Ag/4). These studies pose a challenge for IBC oversight as they are not strictly the purview of the Institute of Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC/ACUC). The purpose of this chapter is to highlight approaches and strategies the IBC can employ to best meets its obligation to review select agent, GoF, and DURC research and ensure the work is properly reviewed so that it is both safe and legal.",

            "text": "A current area of emphasis for IBCs is to identify and closely monitor biological GoF research. There is interest at the highest levels of government in controlling or regulating this type of research activity. The National Academy of Sciences has recently published a report on GoF research. This report was issued following at least two federally directed research stoppages on GoF agents of concern [6] . Categorically, one could debate the wisdom of these moratoriums on on-going research. However, clearly this needs to be resolved quickly as the negative impacts on acquiring knowledge during a time when these emerging viruses are causing human infections are substantial. While it is important to maintain oversight on this type of research, many believe that the benefits outweigh the risks. While this debate is outside the scope of this chapter, it is clear that IBCs will be increasingly drawn in on the subject of managing GoF research. Currently, the GoF agents of concern include respiratory viruses such as highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), and the corona viruses that cause Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Although there is currently no specific regulatory requirement for the IBC to report GoF research activities, other than those experiments which are classified under current NIH guidelines as \"Major Actions,\" there is an institutional interest in identifying GoF research, in particular for respiratory pathogens. Additionally, specific regulatory guidelines on influenza, SARS, and MERS will likely be promulgated by the federal government in the near future and the list of gain-of-function restricted agents may expand [6] . The underlying concern is that GoF research needs unique biosafety and biosecurity solutions because it leads to the creation of specific pathogens with increased virulence, capability to thwart the immune response or defeat medical countermeasures or that the published knowledge from these studies will enable a terrorist or nation to create biological weapons transmissible through aerosols. Obviously, not all GoF experiments involve this subset of respiratory viruses or other select agents but those that do pose difficult issues for the IBC to manage. Most GoF research in select agents requires approval by not only the institution IBC but also the NIH Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee (RAC). The regulatory concerns may become more complex when a GoF project is also Dual Use Research of Concern (DURC) such as those involving certain noncontemporary or HPAI strains of influenza virus. For a more complete discussion of research that qualifies as DURC, the reader is referred to Chapter 6. The IBC can best serve its institution, the research staff, and itself by articulating clear policies for identifying and reviewing GoF/DURC projects early and streamlining their review. This is optimally done during grant preparation. The PI and IBC would first identify whether a grant contains GoF or DURC research, and develop a risk-mitigation strategy which would be included in both the grant and the IBC protocol. A rubric to illustrate this review process is included in Figure 10 ",

            "text": "In 2001, a paper was published as a result of studies with an altered ectromelia virus, which is the causative agent of mouse pox [7] . Mouse pox is not a select agent or Ensuring National Biosecurity 172 DURC agent, however because it is a model for human pox virus in the mouse, research with this agent might raise scientific concerns, especially GoF concerns [8] . The intended purpose of the research was to develop and study a virally vectored contraceptive vaccine construct including the gene for targeted zaona pellucida glycoprotein 3 (ZP3) which had been previously developed with the addition of the mouse IL-4 gene. The concept was that IL-4 expression would delay viral clearance and thus enhance the formation of antibodies and memory cells to the ZP3, leading to an extension of the period of infertility previously observed in ectromelia-ZP3 vaccine studies. However, the observed effect was to make the construct lethal in susceptible mice, and in previously ectromelia-resistant mice. Therefore, this was an unintended GoF experiment. The authors attributed these results to the immunosuppressive effects on cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) and natural killer (NK) cells. Following publication of this manuscript, there was concern that this paper was a road map to creation of weaponized smallpox virus (Variola major). While there is ample room to debate this conclusion, the bigger issue is whether either the authors or their IBC should have predicted this result. There was previously published work similar to the Jackson study using vaccinia virus [9, 10, 11] . These studies did generate data that indicated IL-4 coexpression led to measurable reduction in Th1 cytokines, which are critical for antiviral CTL and NK cell responses. Therefore, a case could be made that the results reported by Jackson should have been foreseen. However, given the differences in pathogenesis of vaccinia and ectromelia in the mouse model, a counter-argument could be made that the highly immunosuppressive results could not have been predicted in the ectromelia study. For the purposes of this discussion it is not important to find fault or assign blame. What is important is to determine what, if any, actions an average IBC could or should take when presented with a similar proposal. Looking at Figure 10 .2 we can determine that the Jackson study is not DURC. However, it does appear to fall under what we would now call GoF. Therefore the PI and the IBC would likely need to address these concerns formally before the studies are approved. The authors would then need to create a rationale of why the benefits of the proposed study outweigh the perceived risks. The IBC should be able to articulate their specific concerns perhaps citing the previous studies in vaccinia. Finally, a risk mitigation plan that includes the anticipated results of the study should be proposed, given the legitimate concern over how the information could be misused for altering other pox viruses. The IBC should communicate with the NIH-OBA to determine whether the risk mitigation plan adequately addresses any perceived risk in the proposed studies. This case study may or may not be covered explicitly in new federal GoF regulations but it likely represents the more common type of GoF problem for IBCs. Each institution will likely need to develop its own policy on what constitutes a GoF concern and communicate this policy to their investigators. Additional examples of case studies of this type can be found on the websites for the Federation of American Scientists (FAS) [12] and National Institutes of Health (NIH) [5, 13] .",

            "text": "Future GoF research efforts on influenza virus, particularly highly pathogenic influenza virus, are likely to be affected by new federal oversight, select agent and DURC regulations. Highly pathogenic avian influenza strains are select agents, DURC agents and in some cases GoF agents if they are noncontemporary strains. The initial concern about influenza virus in particular was a result of a published study on creation of an H5NI virus that gained the ability to become transmissible by air between ferrets [15] . The observed increased transmissibility did not lead to increased pathogenicity (though the latter could not have been precisely predicted).

It appears that the authors of this paper and their respective IBCs exerted more than due diligence in reviewing, approving and monitoring this research project [2] . The concerns raised as a result of this research were initially focused on the inadvertent creation of an influenza strain with pandemic potential. This concern then became more global: creating pathogens that are transmissible via the aerosol route and thus more contagious or able to infect new hosts. The IBC must weigh the value of the information derived from the research study against these and other potential risks. In the case of the Imai study the balance of the equation of risk versus reward seems tilted towards support for the research. The information gained from the Imai study does improve our basic understanding of the influenza virus and in particular key amino acids that affect transmissibility. This information may actually help the public health community better respond to a potential future high-pathogenic avian influenza epidemic. In cases such as this, where the IBC lacks sufficient in-house expertise to address the risk-benefit ratio of a specific protocol or study, they should identify and consult with pathogen-specific experts outside the committee and/or seek additional guidance from NIH-OBA [16] .",

Because many recombinant strains are constructed using antibiotic resistance as a selectable marker, the IBC must pay close attention to protocols that propose such developmental experiments. Sometimes the IBC's role in studies is to help avoid having a proposal fall in the Major Action category. Two common methods include demonstration that the antibiotic resistance marker is already present in environmental isolates, or with qualified help, make the argument that a resistance marker is not clinically relevant. In the first case, if a researcher or the IBC can demonstrate that a strain can naturally acquire a resistance marker, then the proposed work may be deemed to not be a \"major action.\" In the latter case the IBC may work with the researcher to prove that there is no resistance to clinically useful drugs. As an example, if a researcher proposes to use kanamycin as a marker in Burkholderia studies, a current tier 1 select agent, they could demonstrate that the aminoglycoside kanamycin does not confer resistance to commonly employed aminoglycoside drugs such as gentamicin or streptomycin. This evidence could be obtained from the literature or de novo research. If such evidence could be provided for this proposal the research would not be classified as a major action. If, however, the research is deemed to be a major action, the IBC must refer the protocol to NIH-OBA for review and approval.",

Their primary function during the review is to identify specific issues for consideration by the IBC that are unique to select agent research. These issues may include compliance of laboratory facilities, security concerns, or safety concerns for the intended research. These roles may also be performed by other experienced and knowledgeable IBC members when the RO or BSO are not present or lack the requisite knowledge. The IBC should not rely on an appointed BSO/RO who does not have relevant biosafety experience, including containment laboratory operations and regulatory compliance for select agent research.",

Thus, input from OHP can be a valuable part of the IBC protocol review process. A medical monitoring program, if appropriate, can also help establish inclusion and exclusion criteria for lab staff based on perceived risks and medical conditions of employees for potentially hazardous research. The IBC should work closely with OHP at their institute to recommend specific medical countermeasures matched to the risk involved in each procedure/laboratory. These countermeasures may include vaccinations or plans for provision of therapeutic treatments, such as oseltamivir or ciprofloxacin, should there be a high level of suspicion of the possibility of exposure. This committee may also be charged with helping to prepare agent-specific information documents for the PI, the biocontainment lab's biosafety and incidence response plans and/or for institute or private clinicians or healthcare providers. Finally, this committee can also develop recommendations for initial and/or on-going assessment (physical and/ or emotional) of select agent workers in concert with the RO.

An example of a common issue in the nonbiocontainment space that affects safety includes issues such as access to autoclaves. If a laboratory worker has to travel through heavily trafficked public corridors, up or down public elevators, and then has to stage waste outside of the autoclave in a public area, this represents a potential increased biosafety and biosecurity risk as compared to an inlab autoclave. IBC members unfamiliar with the laboratory layout may not perceive this risk. The same is true for biocontainment operations. Interestingly, a retrospective study which examined the effect of NIH site visits on improving oversight and regulatory compliance for rDNA research by IBCs [22] has not yet been extended to work on biocontainment operations. The IBC can seek one of many outside experts to evaluate their containment laboratory operations and facilities and provide feedback to the IBC. Often IBCs may be hesitant to pursue this route through government regulatory agencies as findings can impact on-going laboratory operations and/or be construed as punitive, given the nature of the findings. There are also professional consultants available for hire to perform this type of assessment but this may be cost-prohibitive. The American Biological Safety Association (ABSA) has proposed a site-visit-based accreditation program [23] . The role of the IBC in the accreditation program is not specified but it would be reasonable to assume they should play a role in compliance and problem resolution following accreditation visits. Because ABSA is not a government regulatory agency and their findings are confidential, this may be a reasonable way to educate the IBC, identify and remedy shortcomings and improve the safety and security of biocontainment laboratories, especially those which conduct select agent research.",

The IBC should develop a pathogen road map to ensure that all biosafety and biosecurity concerns involving select agents are addressed by the PI. An example of this road map is shown in Figure 10 .3. In this figure we see the traditional roles of the IBC and IACUC and the areas of new or expanded emphasis the IBC should expect to evaluate for new research proposals involving select agents or select agent studies in animals. The IBC should use the roadmap or a similar template or checklist to determine whether the PI has addressed all critical steps in their protocol. The CDC and USDA often request this type of information from the PI at the time application is made for permission to work with a select agent. Often, the BSO or RO can bring this information directly to the IBC and the IBC should then ascertain whether those procedures are present in sufficient detail to mitigate the identified risks. The institutional Biosafety Officer can help identify and address biosafety and biosecurity gaps for both select and nonselect agents.

Both the IBC and the IACUC committees may only perceive portions of the risks associated with such work. Members who have served on both the IBC and IACUC are invaluable in identifying these overlap risks. Risks include biosafety-related procedures for propagating and manipulating select agent cultures, security of select agents, sharps management, animal exposure methods, animal-to-human transmission risks, and overall waste management. A risk commonly overlooked by the IBC and IACUC is management of animal waste and bedding. If infectious agents are present in the animal waste they pose a biosafety risk that the IBC and/or IACUC may not perceive or address as they may think the other committee will address the hazard. The IACUC considers allergens a primary exposure of concern, and the issue of animal bedding is often neglected altogether by the IBC. When an animal is infected with a select agent that animal, its biological samples, and often animal waste are classified as select agents. If a select agent can be shed in animal secretions the disposition of contaminated materials must be addressed in the IBC protocol and should also be addressed in the IACUC protocol. Figure 10 .3 also highlights additional risk mitigation tools. First, is the role of an effective occupational health program, enrollment in this program is not required for work with non-tier 1 select agents but is required for tier 1 select agents. Often, the best practice is to enroll all select agent research staff in the occupational health program to fully cover management of occupational exposure to select agents. A second useful tool is the development of a hazards communication plan or tools. Essentially, this tool can be tailored to include the entire laboratory, separate research spaces, or even individuals. The components of this tool/plan include hazard identification methods (e.g., labels, room placards), communications methods (e.g., in person meetings or text messages such as \"Anthrax in use in room XX on these dates\"), and what needs to happen if something goes wrong (e.g., Incident Response Plan). Finally, it is important to note that it is not the primary role of the IBC to dictate how the PI establishes proper safety and security protocols per se but rather to evaluate the adequacy of the procedures to meet the intended purpose, the guidelines established by NIH or the BMBL [17] or other specific institutional regulation or best practice. In general, the PI and IBC should work together to identify areas of risk in the research proposal, define appropriate methods and evaluate these methods for adequacy in terms of both biosafety and biosecurity and, finally, propose risk mitigation strategies in cases where the hazard may not be fully understood.",

However, they often overlook the burdens, sometimes unnecessary, that these procedures place on the research community. Often the retort to complaints by PIs about overly onerous requirements is \"that's the policy,\" a response that may create frustration and tension amongst the research staff that in turn may lead to noncompliance. When the IBC takes a different approach and seeks to improve and streamline application procedures, there is often more buy-in from researchers and better compliance. An important factor in compliance is protocol turnaround times. Many laboratory protocols are time-consuming to write and researchers frequently find themselves facing deadlines. Anything the IBC can do to reduce turnaround times on reviews is highly valued and appreciated by the research staff. Recognizing this key item, the Biohazard Compliance Office (BHC) at the University of New Mexico implemented internal procedural changes that reduced their turnaround times from 14.3 to 0.9 days [24] . Almost any IBC can reduce review and turnaround times for IBC protocols with Ensuring National Biosecurity 182 such an introspective approach that values the PI as their customer versus someone who needs to be \"regulated.\" The IBC itself, or the Institute Official, may also wish to use processing times as a measure of efficiency or responsiveness or an indirect measure of workload for the IBC.

Therefore, the IBC must have a detailed understanding of their biocontainment facility design and operation. When the IBC is not involved in design or modification discussions a knowledge gap is created. No two biocontainment laboratories are the same in layout though many are similar in function or capabilities. This happens for a number of reasons including architectural design, budget, user input, building restrictions and most importantly the various interpretation of standards for construction. Standards affecting construction of the facilities themselves are often drawn from multiple sources including local building codes, state building codes, and guidelines such as those in the NIH Guidelines for construction [25] , USDA facility design guidelines [26] , Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories (BMBL) [17] or American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRE) [27] . Another recent standard that affects air handling within biocontainment facilities is ANZI Z9.14 [28] and the IBC can rely on the results of the tests as set forth in this standard as proof that the facility design is safe. As an example of design variations two different architects will read the BMBL requirement \"Floors must be slip resistant, impervious to liquids and resistant to chemicals. Consideration should be given to the installation of seamless, sealed, resilient or poured floors, with integral cove bases.\" These two architects will in turn design two different solutions after consideration of a number of variable factors including cost, durability, and maintenance. This same scenario plays out for all aspects of the laboratories' design including but not limited to doors, anterooms, autoclaves, shower facilities, etc. Consequently, this poses unique challenges and opportunities to managing risk in the facility both for the staff and the IBC. The IBC should add the Biocontainment Facility Director or Manager to the membership of the committee to address facility-related questions. This person can best address the capabilities and limitations of the facility in general or as it pertains to a particular research proposal. This subject is addressed in greater detail in Chapter 4.",

This experience provides insights into both risk areas as well as reasonable solutions to biocontainment research. If biocontainment researchers have a positive perception of the IBC process and can be convinced of the need for their expertise they are often more willing to participate as an IBC member. These select agent PI members often know and are familiar with other select agent research occurring in the biocontainment lab and can mentor new or junior faculty in meeting IBC expectations for protocols and procedures.",

A knowledgeable and well-run IBC is a key asset in allaying worries about research conducted with select agents. In particular, the IBC can institute sound reviews and implement policies that mitigate risk both to the research staff and the community. Additionally, with capable community members as part of the IBC more effective communication with the public can help educate the community on the benefits of select agent research. Staffing the IBC with the \"correct\" persons can dramatically streamline select agent research, improve biological safety and security and ensure regulatory compliance by answering the two basic questions: Is it safe? And is it legal?",
