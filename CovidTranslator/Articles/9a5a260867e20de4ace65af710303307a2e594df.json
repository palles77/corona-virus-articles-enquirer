            "text": "The 3C-like main proteinase of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, SARS-CoV M pro , is widely considered to be a major drug target for the development of anti-SARS treatment. Based on the chemical structure of a lead compound from a previous screening, we have designed and synthesized a number of non-peptidyl inhibitors, some of which have shown significantly improved inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV M pro with IC 50 values of $60 nM. In the absence of SARS-CoV M pro crystal structures in complex with these synthetic inhibitors, molecular docking tools have been employed to study possible interactions between these inhibitors and SARS-CoV M pro . The docking results suggest two major modes for the initial binding of these inhibitors to the active site of SARS-CoV M pro . They also establish a structural basis for the 'core design' of these inhibitors by showing that the 3-chloropyridine functions common to all of the present inhibitors tend to cluster in the S1 specificity pocket. In addition, intrinsic flexibility in the S4 pocket allows for the accommodation of bulky groups such as benzene rings, suggesting that this structural plasticity can be further exploited for optimizing inhibitor-enzyme interactions that should promote a tighter binding mode. Most importantly, our results provide the structural basis for rational design of wide-spectrum antiviral drugs targeting the chymotrypsin-like cysteine proteinases from coronaviruses and picornaviruses.",

            "text": "In the winter of 2002, a form of atypical pneumonia, later termed the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), broke out in southern China and rapidly spread to 32 countries and regions on five continents. Approximately 8098 people were infected and of these, 774 deaths were reported in the ensuing months. 1 The causative agent of SARS is a novel human coronavirus (SARS-CoV). [2] [3] [4] [5] Similar to other coronaviruses, the RNA genome of SARS-CoV encodes at least two viral proteinases, one of which is the main proteinase (M pro ). M pro , a highly conserved proteinase among coronaviruses, is responsible for the majority of the proteolytic processing of two large viral polyproteins, replicases pp1a and pp1ab. All of the cleavage products from these replicases are required for the assembly of membranous complexes in infected cells where the viral RNA genome is replicated. Interruption of either viral RNA translation or polyprotein proteolytic processing abolishes viral RNA replication. 6, 7 Because the indispensable involvement in polyprotein processing of SARS-CoV M pro is upstream of many replicative events in the viral life cycle, reducing or blocking the peptidase function of M pro could have a profound impact on lowering progeny virus yield and enhancing cell survival. Therefore, SARS-CoV M pro is an attractive target for the development of anti-SARS drugs. 8 The functional quaternary assembly of SARS-CoV M pro is believed to be a dimer. 9 The two protomers are oriented almost perpendicular to one another and each protomer consists of three domains: I (residues 1-101), II (residues 102-184), and III (residues 201-306). Domains I and II are made of b-barrel motifs similar to the domains in the chymotrypsin-type serine proteases and in the 3C proteinases of picornaviruses. The substrate binding sites, and the nearby catalytic dyad consisting of residues Cys145 and His41, are located in a cleft between domains I and II. Domain III contains five a-helices connected to domain II via an extended loop (residues 185-200); it plays an essential role for the proteolytic activity of SARS-CoV M pro by maintaining the proper conformation of the dimer. [9] [10] [11] The substrate binding sites of SARS-CoV M pro have been probed using several classes of inhibitors. 9, 12, 13 Chloromethyl ketones, epoxides, and Michael acceptors are among the functional groups known to form a covalent bond with the nucleophilic sulfur atom of Cys145, thereby leading to the inactivation of SARS-CoV M pro 's enzymatic activity. Similar to the main proteinases of transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and human coronavirus strain 229E, SARS-CoV M pro exhibits well-defined S1, S2, and S4 pockets that seem to be highly structurally conserved among coronaviruses. 8, 12, 13 Both in vitro and in vivo studies show that the residues at the P1, P2, and P4 positions of the substrate are involved in substrate binding, recognition, and cleavage. 8, 14, 15 Consequently, the S pockets of SARS-CoV M pro have been the principal targeting sites for anti-SARS (or wide-spectrum anticoronavirus) drugs.",

Interestingly, the positions of the electron-withdrawing substituents on their terminal aromatic rings seem to influence the inhibitory efficacy of these compounds dramatically. For example, the difference in the position of the nitrogen atom of the pyridine moiety relative to the carbonyl function in compounds 6 and 7 is associated with a fourfold disparity in their IC 50 values. The best group I inhibitors, compounds 1-3, contain either a chloride or a nitro group at the para position relative to the furan function. Moving the nitro group of compound 2 to either the ortho (compound 4) or the meta (compound 5) position led to a threefold and eightfold increase in their IC 50 values, respectively. In a similar manner to compounds 2, 4, and 5, compounds 8-10 of group II bear a chloro-or a nitro-substituent on the benzene ring directly connected to the central ester function at the para, ortho, and meta position relative to the ester bond, respectively.

The first binding mode (the S2-S1 mode) of the group I compounds occupies primarily the volume extending from the S2 to the S1 substrate binding sites (Fig. 1a) . Figure 1b shows the predicted interactions between the enzyme and compound 1 in the active site as an example. The chloropyridine moieties of these inhibitors bind inside the S1 pocket in an orientation wherein the pyridine plane is parallel to the two 'walls' of the S1 sites formed by residues Phe140, Leu141, Asn142, Ser144, and residues Glu166, His172, respectively. In the docked complexes of compounds 1, 2, and 5, the common nitrogen atom of the chloropyridine moieties receives a hydrogen bond from N e2 of His163, which is the P1 specificity-determining residue (Fig. 1b) . Similarly, the furan moieties of group I inhibitors occupy the same volume between the S1 and S2 pockets and form a few van der Waals interactions with Met165 (not shown). In contrast, the benzene rings of the group I inhibitors in the S2-S1 mode show relatively larger conformational variations. Compounds 1 and 2, which contain para-substituted benzene rings, can fit into the S2 pocket well. Compounds 3-5 all contain ortho-or meta-orienting groups on their benzene rings. This causes the benzene moieties in these compounds to be pushed outward from S2 site so as to avoid steric hindrance between the benzyl substituents and the side chains of His41 and Met49. The docking models suggest that hydrophobic interactions are formed between residues His41, Met49, and Gln189 and the benzene ring moieties, whereas the main chain NH of Gln189 forms a hydrogen bond with the ortho-orienting nitro substituent on the benzene rings.",

The m-chlorine on the pyridine ring points into the solvent channel at the back side of the S1 pocket, occupying a volume very close to that of a chloride ion observed in the crystal structure of an unliganded SARS-CoV M pro35 (PDB code 2A5A). In the docked complexes containing compounds 1, 4, and 5, this chlorine is hydrogen bonded to O c of Ser144 (Fig. 2b) . Residues Cys145 and Met165 form hydrophobic interactions with the pyridine rings of these inhibitors. The furan rings in the S4-S1 binding mode are situated on top of Met165 and Glu166, making a few van der Waals interactions with these residues. The S4 pocket is large enough to accommodate the benzene rings of the group I inhibitors despite the presence of various substituents at different positions on the rings. Residues Met165, Glu166, Leu167, and Gln189 contribute mostly hydrophobic interactions with the benzene rings. The main chain NH of Glu166 forms two hydrogen bonds with the oxygen atom on the furan and the carbonyl oxygen at the b-position of the central ester bond of group I compounds. In addition, the nitro function of compound 5 forms a hydrogen bond with N e2 of Gln192 (Fig. 2b) . In the S4-S1 binding mode, the distances between the carbonyl carbons of the ester func-tions of the inhibitors and S c of Cys145 range from 6.5 to 7.2 \u00c5 (Table 1 column 8). The inhibitors bound in this mode are very unlikely to be attacked by the sulfur nucleophile of Cys145 due to this long distance constraint. Therefore, the S4-S1 binding mode likely represents a mechanism of competitive inhibition in which the inhibitors block the activity of SARS-CoV M pro by denying entry of substrates into the active site. Most significantly, this binding hypothesis suggests a way to improve the design of more potent non-covalent SARS-CoV M pro inhibitors that promote tighter S4-S1 binding (discussed in later section).",

For group I compounds, there are no significant differences in the binding free energies between the S2-S1 mode (DG 1st) and the S4-S1 binding mode (DG 2nd) ( Table 1 ). This suggests that group I compounds have comparable tendencies to adopt either the S4-S1 or the S2-S1 conformation prior to their possible covalent modification of SARS-CoV M pro enzyme. The binding free energies for group II compounds are significantly higher than those of group I compounds, with the exception of compounds 11 and 12. This is in agreement with the general trend that SARS-CoV M pro is more strongly inhibited by group I than group II compounds. Compounds 11 and 12 show binding free energies closer to those exhibited by the group I compounds, probably because the larger aromatic stabilization effects of the naphthalene moiety of compound 11 and the coumarin moiety of compound 12 make their central ester bonds less susceptible to nucleophilic attack by S c of Cys145.

Our docking results clearly show that the 3-chloropyridine moieties of the ester-based non-peptidyl inhibitors have a strong propensity to enter the S1 specificity pocket of SARS-CoV M pro . Accordingly, the residues forming the S1 pocket play a major part in the interactions between the inhibitors and SARS-CoV M pro . This is significant, as the chloropyridine function does not resemble the cognate P1-Gln residue in terms of chemical properties. Consequently, some interactions between SARS-CoV M pro and chloropyridine moiety likely differ from those between P1-Gln and SARS-CoV M pro . Further derivatization of the chloropyridine group has yielded only marginal improvement on the efficacy of the resultant inhibitors, indicating that our design may have its maximal potential concerning the S1 pocket of SARS-CoV M pro . Since the S1 pockets of all coronaviral M pro are structurally conserved and are similar to those of the picornaviral 3C pro , the inhibitors described in this study or at least their basic designs should prove useful in developing wide-spectrum antiviral compounds. An early indication of that came from the observation that the parent compound MAC-5576 showed very good inhibitory activity against both the SARS-CoV M pro and the HAV 3C pro with corresponding IC 50 values in the high nanomolar range. 22 A second 'hotspot' that could be targeted by anti-SARS-CoV M pro compounds is residue His41. His41 plays the dual role of activating S c of Cys145 during the catalytic cycle as a general base as well as forming part of the S2 specificity pocket. In the S2-S1 binding mode, His41, together with Met165 and Glu166, forms more than half of the total hydrophobic interactions with the group I inhibitors (Table 3 ). Met165 and Glu166 form the 'wall' of the S2 pocket opposite to that of His41; these residues are also major contributors of hydrophobic interactions in the S4-S1 and the Cys-S1 binding modes (Tables 4  and 5 ).",

It is worth mentioning that the model structure used in docking is that of a SARS-CoV M pro covalently modified at S c of Cys145. The position of the nucleophilic sulfur atom, relative to the other active site residues, has shifted significantly from that of S c in the unliganded enzyme structures (PDB codes, e.g., 1UK4 or 2A5A) (Fig. 4a) . Our recent X-ray crystallographic analyses of SARS-CoV M pro in complex with some peptidyl inhibitors indicate that the formation of tetrahedral intermediates during substrate hydrolysis can take place without the requirement of the previously observed conformational changes in Cys145. 37 Consequently, we aligned the 1UK4 structure onto the docking molecule 2A5K to obtain the alternate coordinates of the nucleophilic sulfur, which should represent the position of S c in its resting state and when the substrate/inhibitor first approaches. The distances involving S c of Cys145 were recalculated. It is clear that the carbonyl carbon atoms of the group II compounds are closer to S c of Cys145 than those of the group I compounds (Table 2 column 6). Note that some of the calculated distances (for group II compounds and for compounds 3 and 4 in the S2-S1 binding mode) are shorter than the sum of van der Waals radii of carbonyl oxygen and thiol sulfur atoms, suggesting a strong pro-pensity for the covalent attachment of these inhibitors to S c of Cys145.",

It suggests that a chloropyridine function in the context of an ester compound specifically binds to the S1 substrate binding site of SARS-CoV M pro . The interactions between the S1 site of SARS-CoV M pro and the chloropyridine functions likely play an important role in the initial binding of our inhibitors to the enzyme in vitro, whereas the rate of subsequent water-mediated hydrolysis of the resultant acyl enzyme depends on the chemical properties of the leaving groups on the carbonyl side of the ester bond. It is worth mentioning that additional docking studies indicate that the chloropyridine function of these compounds likely targets the S1 site of HAV 3C pro as well (data not shown).

The conformations of the S2 and S4 pockets clearly showed structural variations among these structures (Fig. 4a , for clarity, only two models were overlaid). The depths of the S2 and S4 pockets could affect docking results dramatically simply because larger inhibitors will not be docked into the smaller pockets. The crystal structure of SARS-CoV M pro in complex with an aza-peptide epoxide (APE) 35 (PDB code: 2A5K, chain A) was chosen to construct the predictive model for this series of inhibitors. The benzene rings in the P2 and P4 positions of APE were accommodated cozily in the S2 and S4 pockets as a result of the relatively larger size of these pockets in available crystal structures of SARS-CoV M pro (Fig. 4a and b) . Therefore, using this structure of the enzyme is, in principle, to allow the inhibitors to adopt conformations that would maximize the interactions between the inhibitors and the S2 and S4 sites of the enzyme. The coordinates of the inhibitor, APE and the solvent molecules were first removed from the corresponding PDB file. Then essential hydrogen atoms and Kollman united atom charges were added to the protein structure using the molecular modeling software, Sybyl version 7.1 (Tripos Inc., St. Louis, USA).
