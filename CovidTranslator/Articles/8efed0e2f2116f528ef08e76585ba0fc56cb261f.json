            "text": "Amanda M Walmsley \u00c3 and Charles J Arntzen y Many advances continue to be made in the field of plant-derived vaccines. Plants have been shown capable of expressing a multicomponent vaccine that when orally delivered induces a T-helper cell subset 1 response and enables passive immunization. Furthermore, a plant-derived vaccine has been shown to protect against challenge in the target host. Increased antigen expression levels (up to 4.1% total soluble protein) have been obtained through transformation of the chloroplast genome. In view of these findings, plant-derived vaccines have been proved as valuable commodities to the world's health system; however, before their application, studies need to focus on optimization of immunization strategies and to investigate antigen stability.",

There are many effective avenues for the production of recombinant pharmaceutical proteins; however, the main challenge lies in achieving cost-effective production on a large scale. Over the past five years the potential for using plants as bioreactors has become well established. Plant systems offer several advantages: they are economical, using low-cost inputs such as light, water and miner-als; they are easily adaptable to large-scale operations (by growing more plants); they possess minimal risk of contamination with potential human pathogens; the products may not require purification and pharmaceuticals produced this way can be given mucosally, hence simplifying delivery and decreasing overall cost.",

The use of plants to express antigens for use as vaccines has seen continued interest over the past few years, as witnessed by an increasing number of reports of transgenic plant expression of new antigens and the altered expression of previously reported antigens. A range of different plant and vector systems for the expression of antigens have been investigated and some are summarized in Table 2 [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] . Seed-specific production of the B subunit of heat-labile toxin (LTB) by Streatfield et al. [19] achieved LTB expression levels reaching 1.8% total soluble protein (TSP) and two separate maize breeding programs have increased antigen production by fivefold [19] and tenfold [20] . The investigations of Chikwamba et al. [20] regarding expression of LTB in maize are also the first to report the use of particle bombardment for the production of plant-derived vaccines. Immunogenicity was demonstrated for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) [12, 21] , the S protein of transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV) [13, 14] and a human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) epitope [16] , while successful challenge trials resulted after immunization with P. aeruginosa epitopes [15] , the FP1 epitope of foot and mouth disease virus (FMDV) [17] and LTB [20] .",

Studies have proven plants capable of expression of many different antigens, all of which have demonstrated immunogenicity when tested and some have been shown to provide protection in model and target animals. It has often been stated that there is a need for increased antigen expression levels in plants; however, targeted expression and plant breeding have alleviated this problem. Preliminary investigations into antigen stability, processing and optimal immunization strategies have been performed. However, there is a need for further in-depth studies of individual antigens before plantderived vaccines can be used as a commodity. Recently, concerns have been raised regarding the regulation of plant-derived vaccines and the safety of the food chain from contamination with these pharmaceuticals. For this reason the initial concept of edible, food-delivered vaccines needs to be developed into inexpensive, plantderived, mucosal vaccines that are regulated through prescription and not released like other transgenic plants used for modern agricultural products. Within the United States, two entities currently regulate plant-derived pharmaceuticals, the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The USDA currently regulates the location and containment of transgenic plants expressing pharmaceuticals, whereas the FDA ensures quality assurance and quality control. The FDA guarantees that quality assurance and quality control standards are maintained during production and preparation of the materials to ensure safety and efficacy of the materials before human administration. The FDA also determines the relative risk of progressing plantderived pharmaceuticals to licensure through phased clinical trial monitoring. Recently, the FDA released the first draft regulations for the production of plantderived pharmaceuticals [45 ] . The regulatory environment in the US is evolving to encourage the safe yet rapid commercialization of plant-derived pharmaceuticals. The recent developments in plant-derived vaccine production reported here bring this technology ever closer to graduating from the research and development phase. The coevolution of plant-derived vaccine technology and production regulations is ensuring these prototype vaccines are close to becoming useful commodities.",

Transgenic spinach expressing epitopes from the rabies virus glycoprotein (G protein) and nucleoprotein (N protein) fused to the coat protein (CP) of alfalfa mosaic virus (AlMV) was orally delivered to 14 human volunteers. Five of the volunteers had been previously immunized with the conventional rabies vaccine. Three of the five volunteers who had previously been immunized with the conventional vaccine and five of the nine initially naive individuals showed significant specific antibody responses to the rabies virus while none of the control volunteer samples showed significant elevation in rabies-specific antibodies. Seven days after completing the feeding regime, the nine initially naive volunteers were given a dose of the conventional rabies virus vaccine. Three of these individuals showed rabies virus neutralizing antibodies, but none of the five controls showed these antibodies. Although no neutralizing antibody was detected before immunization with the commercial vaccine, there was a clear indication of the potential of the plant-derived rabies vaccine to act as a supplementary oral booster for rabies vaccinations.

Biotechnol Prog 2002, 18:538-550. This paper describes an in depth investigation into the stability of HBsAg. Detergent concentration, sodium ascorbate concentration, the presence of skimmed milk (or its protein) and buffer pH were found to be important factors in antigen stability. 44.
