I should be able to do this for two reasons. Like everyone else I have suffered from colds, but in addition I have been studying the problem from the virological and clinical point of view for over 35 years -for the last 31 at the Common Cold Unit, Salisbury. As a result I may have problems with perspective -it is not possible to give a personal view and at the same time to describe something from every possible angle, and quite impossible to be comprehensive, but I have done my best and readers will make their own judgements and corrections.",

            "text": "Soon after starting research I learnt for myself how difficult it might be to detect a 'new' cold virus. In the early 1950s in the laboratories of the Rockefeller Institute in New York, I had just found out how to make roller tube tissue cultures which would support the growth of influenza viruses. I took some of these cultures and inoculated washings from a patient with a cold. After a few days a cytopathic effect appeared and I was all excitement, only to discover shortly afterwards that the cultures had a low grade infection with a cytotoxic bacterium. I discarded the experiment and got on with other work. In due course I returned to the UK, was appointed to the staff of the Medical Research Council (MRC) and worked in Sheffield on respiratory viruses, such as adenoviruses and infuenza; but circumstances led me to join the work on poliovirus vaccines and on the role of recently cultivated enteroviruses, all of which seemed to take me further and further from respiratory viruses. But I was then asked to work at the Common Cold Unit, Salisbury. In one way this meant that my outlook had to be much narrower, but in another it broadened greatly the possible approaches. I could now prepare pools of filtered nasal washings from individuals infected with clinical material, and thus had a documented stock of viruses which could not be propagated in the laboratory. We could also use the volunteers as a specific and sensitive test for the presence of a common cold virus. Thus we systematically tested for the growth of viruses in tissue cultures by inoculating culture medium as nasal drops into groups of volunteers living in isolation and observing whether they developed colds or not.",

            "text": "But how did it come to pass that there was a Common Cold Unit at all, and was it really a good idea to have one? Colds and minor respiratory catarrhal illnesses must have been occurring for centuries, and are mentioned in diaries and literature. Late in the 19th century, with the rise of bacteriology, colds were actively investigated with the newly developed methods. Indeed by the 1930s it took a volume of 710 pages to summarize the published investigations but the virus theory was dismissed in only nine of them (Thomson and Thomson, 1932) . Some of the results reported seem bizarre these days but it is possible to guess at how some of them were obtained. For instance it seems that some workers did not distinguish clearly between the early acute illness and subsequent catarrh, sinusitis and secondary bacterial infections. Of course, good methods were available to culture and characterize common organisms such as pneumococci, haemophilus species and streptococcus haemolyticus, but there was much confusion with other organisms such as Neisseria and, as we would now call them, Branhamella. Anaerobic bacteriology was also beginning and gram-negative filter-passing anaerobes were alleged to exist. As a result a wealth of possible causative organisms were cultured. Even when it was realised that some bacteria might be harmless symbionts, it was possible to convince oneself that certain organisms appeared in the pharynx more frequently in colds than in good health. One study tackled this problem with really careful bacterial assessment, and a careful and impartial experimental design for collecting clinical records and bacterial specimens (Mills et al., 1928) . This concluded that although these anaerobic bacteria came and went in the airways they were a heterogeneous group and their presence was not related in time or quantity to the occurrence of cold symptoms. It is easy to look back at those studies with the confidence engendered by a view down the 'retrospectoscope' and see them clearly as a decisive observation. However, in the context of the time one can imagine how much authors might be influenced by confusion over whether filtrates transmitted colds and if they did what it meant. Powerful evidence was also being collected at the same time to show that haemolytic streptococci were associated with pharyngitis and many of its complications and that certain serotypes of pneumococci were unquestionably linked to pneumonia. After all it is less than ten years since we lived through a similar but brief period of confusion, claims and counter-claims until the HIV virus was cultured and its relationship to AIDS was documented.",

            "text": "In fact specific evidence that viruses caused colds had been obtained long before the 1930s by the appropriate methods of the time. Kruse published in 1914 in the Munich Medical Weekly the results of an experiment in which he passed nasal washings through a bacteria-tight filter, inoculated it into volunteers and observed colds. This result was overlooked, possibly in part because of the outbreak of war, but it was also discredited because his volunteers were not isolated and so a few who were given uninfected material nevertheless developed colds; there was also the question of whether filtration through Seitz filters or Berkefield candles would remove all bacteria. These needed to be carefully checked to ensure that they did hold back all bacteria and this could be done as a control test. Indeed it may be because these tests were not properly done or interpreted, that it was believed by many that anaerobic organisms could exist in a filterable form.",

However, further problems lay ahead. Having shown that colds really could be due to viruses the same group then set out to culture the virus using the technology of the day, namely cultures of chopped chick embryo tissue, held under a layer of paraffin (Dochez et al., 1931) : they believed they could produce colds with such material. C.H. Andrewes (personal communication) tried to repeat this experiment in England, and even brought cultures from New York by ship, but failed to get convincing data, and concluded that the results were due to irritation produced by autolysed tissue. However, the studies on the viral nature of colds were well designed and executed and although they did not immediately convince all those in the field they stood the tests of time and repetition and caused the edifice of studies of bacterial 'causes' of colds to be weakened and eventually to crumble.",

            "text": "It would be an interesting piece of social and historical research to define the thoughts and beliefs and the social background which led to the founding of the Common Cold Unit at Salisbury, UK in 1946. We know that there were unanswered scientific questions and that C.H. Andrewes, already known for passing human influenza virus to ferrets (Smith et al., 1933) , was anxious to do more experiments on colds using human volunteers in a similar way. Furthermore the old American Red Cross/Harvard Hospital site had lain vacant since the US Army had left it empty when they moved their pathology laboratory to Paris. But there were very few virologists in the UK, the country had desperate economic problems in the rebuilding of millions of damaged homes, repairing and re-equipping factories and generally developing an effective peacetime economy. Yet at the same time there was a general hope for a better country and a better life in the post-war years. Perhaps it was also believed that the task was simpler than it really was: that some months or years of research would reveal 'the' common cold virus against which a vaccine would be made (Andrewes, 1949) . War-time experience had also given rise to the belief that so-called 'minor' infections could significantly reduce production, and it was perceived that this would be important in peacetime too. Whatever the truth may have been, a joint plan was formulated in early 1946 -the Ministry of Health would support the accommodation of the volunteers, up to 20 or 30 each two weeks, the Medical Research Council would fund the laboratory work and staff, and the Ministry of Works would look after the buildings and the basic services. In a matter of a few months the buildings were converted, a small staff was assembled and in July of the same year the first group of seven student volunteers arrived to be the subjects for the first of a series of trials which continued without a break for 43 years and involved almost 20000 visits to the Unit, and over 18 000 individuals.",

Of course rhinovirus 1 a was grown away from the Unit by applying to respiratory specimens other techniques developed from those of Enders, i.e. roller tube cultures of monkey kidney cell cultures and observation of a cytopathic effect (Price, 1956; Pelon et al., 1957) .",

We first found a method for propagating many different 'cold' (actually rhino-)-viruses in roller tube cultures of human embryo kidney cells at 33\u00b0C for two passages, without a cytopathic effect (CPE) . The medium was modified, first to allow serial passage and the development of interference, and then to allow a rapid CPE to occur (Tyrrell and Parsons, 1960; Hitchcock and Tyrrell, 1960) . Others later found more convenient susceptible cells. Once fully developed, these methods could be used in any laboratory, the biology and drug sensitivity of viruses could be studied anywhere and their presence in clinical material and their relationship to disease either in volunteers or in the community could be determined.",

Once we had even small amounts of human interferon (Sutton and Tyrrell, 1961) we could show in vitro that it would render human cells resistant to a wide range of viruses capable of causing colds, but there was a general view that such treatment would never protect the respiratory epithelial cells, defended as they are by the mucociliary apparatus. Furthermore the first interferon preparations were of very low potency. Later chemically synthesized antivirals were also disappointing, but interferon experiments continued with purer and more potent preparations until 1973 when the idea of antivirais for the treatment of colds finally came of age and rhinovirus-induced colds were prevented at the Unit by spraying human leucocyte interferon intranasally (Merigan et al., 1973) . This result was confirmed and shown to be due to interferon itself when colds were prevented with leucocyte interferon which had been purified by means of monoclonal antibody (Scott et al., 1982a) or synthesized in E. coli by recombinant DNA technology (Scott et al., 1982b) .

In the absence of an animal model and in the face of the multiplicity of causative viruses, it is important to have a 'half-way house' between the test tube and studies of natural colds to identify promising drugs and find out how to use them clinically (Beare and Reed, 1977) . Important elements of this are the willingness of the public to help, a place where they like to come for the experiments and the invisible relationships built up with the experimental team. It will be essential to reproduce these if successful experiments of this sort are to be done in the future.",

Psychological factors, such as personality and 'stress' were also found to be important. It was possible to use volunteers with colds as a mild but definable 'organic' disease in which one could document quite rigorously (Totman et al., 1980; Cohen et al., 1991) effects which very probably occur in other less common but more serious diseases, but which could not be studied experimentally for ethical and practical reasons. Other experiments showed that human performance is impaired by colds and influenza (e.g. Smith et al., 1988a ) and a start was made in looking for the role of virus-induced humoral factors such as interferon as mediators of these changes (Smith et al., 1988b) . These findings were not intended to lead to new treatments directly but complemented work done elsewhere to provide a fuller understanding of the disease, which in turn could open up new forms of treatment.

Although it was very likely from the circumstances that they caused the diseases affecting the patients in which they were found, it was desirable to try and fulfil 'Koch's postulates' and show that the cultured virus would cause respiratory disease in man. Thus they were led to inoculate adults in room isolation and showed that they were infected and developed a disease which resembled a common cold, rather than the more severe lower respiratory disease which they found in children . The group also worked on rhinovirus colds, and used volunteers to do important early studies on the role of antibody in immunity to infection (Cate et al., 1964) . Another group at the NIH was able to exploit the technology developed as a result of concern with biological warfare. They generated accurately defined aerosols of various respiratory viruses and developed equipment to enable volunteers to inhale known amounts of these (see Knight, 1964) . Thus they could calculate the amount of virus delivered as an aerosol which was required to initiate an infection: furthermore they showed that when given as a fine aerosol, viruses which otherwise invade the upper airways and cause colds would invade the lower airways and cause lesions in the lungs and bronchi. When some of the group transferred to Baylor University in Texas they performed volunteer experiments in local prisons, for instance on live influenza vaccines.",

Effects were sometimes modest and although they were apparently significant most of us felt much more comfortable about our conclusions when experiments had been repeated elsewhere with similar results. It was in fact remarkable how closely the results agreed at times, for instance on the clinical effects of para-influenza viruses or the protective effect of interferons. On other occasions hopeful results of trials with candidate drugs could not be repeated and so work moved on to others. Finally the existence of these groups created a sort of loosely-knit club.

Work in the Unit and elsewhere suggested that colds had been transmitted from children to volunteers by the airborne route (Lovelock et al., 1952) but no techniques were available to detect virus in the air or to quantitate virus in the mixture of droplets ejected into the air by a sneeze. However, the nose collects particles from air during inspiration at the rate of about 10 litres per minute, but nevertheless transmission of infection is relatively infrequent (e.g. Hendley et al., 1969) . If each infection is initiated by the inhalation of one infectious unit, it is clear that a low concentration of such units in the air would be sufficient to explain the epidemiological findings. In volunteer studies with coxsackievirus A21 it was shown that colds could be transmitted from one end of a long room to the other when only air contact was possible (Couch et al., 1970) . We demonstrated how Coxsackie A21 virus, which is very like a rhinovirus, is shed as drops and droplets into the air by a subject with a cold and that similar droplets infect the nose efficiently when inhaled (Buckland et al., 1965) . However, there was very little virus in saliva and so little became airborne when talking.",

Nevertheless in an earlier experiment they showed that viricidal tissues prevented transmission during an experimental poker game (Dick et al., 1986) . However, in order to test whether finger transmission was important in families, Gwaltney's group set up a placebo-controlled household study to block the transmission of rhinovirus colds through the fingers. This turned out to be a difficult experiment to conduct and although there was a trend in favour of the treated group there was no large or statistically significant overall effect (Farr et al., 1987) . Early work on the use of UV light in school classrooms showed that the transmission of measles could be slowed down by impeding airborne transmission, but neither this nor the use of viricidal tissues seem practical methods of preventing a substantial amount of transmission. Water treatment and food hygiene have had a profound effect on water and food-borne diseases. It seems unlikely that anything as successful can be developed for respiratory virus infections but, nevertheless, good ventilation and hand hygiene should be encouraged and are likely to do some good.",

            "text": "(2) Host resistance Soon after the first rhinoviruses were cultured, a collaboration was set up to produce an inactivated vaccine against RV2. This was given intramuscularly to volunteers before they came to the Unit and they proved to be resistant to colds produced by intranasal challenge with live virus of the same serotype (Scientific Committee, 1965) . Although others believed secretory antibody to be of particular importance, we have done recent studies which show that circulating antibody (which was stimulated by the vaccine) is long-lasting and protects significantly against illness, although secretory antibody is effective in preventing infection (Rossen et al., 1966; Barclay et al., 1989) . Now that the sequence and structure of rhinoviruses is becoming better known, it is possible to identify possible linear peptide epitopes on the virus surface. This in turn suggests the possibility of searching for peptides which could be given as a killed vaccine to produce neutralising antibody (Francis et al., 1987) . Of course, there are many difficulties along the way, such as antigenicity, the need for Tcell epitopes, the variability of the human immune responsiveness etc., but the possibility of vaccination against rhinoviruses is worth exploring further. Indeed we have entered a new era in which the antigenic sites of two representative rhinoviruses types, 14 and la, have been mapped onto 3dimensional models of the virus particles (Rossman et al., 1985; Rossman0 1989; Appleyard et al., 1990) . They turn out to be located on the edges of the 'canyon' around the 5-fold symmetry axis of the particle. We have determined that human volunteers make antibodies against at least 3 such sites on rhinovirus type 2 identified by mouse monoclonal antibodies. Challenging the volunteers shows that the presence of such antibodies is associated with resistance to virus infection (Carey et al., 1992) . Many sites seem to be conformational, and a specific amino acid may be involved in the sites seen by more than one monoclonal antibody, so the problem is undoubtedly complex and more basic work is needed before sites on the edge of the 'canyon' can be fully identified and mimicked synthetically for one serotype, let alone for the 100-odd types now known. It has however already been suggested that it may be possible to generate neutralising antibody against the conserved sequences deeper in the 'canyon' which is the suspected site of interaction between the virus and the cell receptor (Rossman, 1989) . There has been more success in applying the discovery of interferons. The alpha and beta interferons (IFN~ and -fl) are produced by virus-infected cells and protect cells with which they come in contact by triggering the development of a state of resistance to virus infection. It is now well known that exogenous interferon, delivered as a nasal spray, protects the human from both experimental and naturally acquired common colds (see Scott and Tyrrell, 1985 which includes references to all other groups, in particular those at Charlottesville). However, in family studies it was effective only against rhinoviruses, and prolonged administration in doses big enough to protect gave rise to nasal symptoms such as mild nose bleeding, stuffiness, etc. Thus interferon cannot be used for continuous prophylaxis. This was found with IFN~2a, but there was some hope that IFNfl might show a different ratio between the concentrations giving protective and adverse effects, but this has not proved to be so. IFN gamma (IFN~) has also been tried at doses with equivalent antiviral effects in vitro. However, it had no beneficial prophylactic effects, indeed it seemed to make symptoms worse (Higgins et al., 1988) , possibly because it enhanced the production of virus receptors (ICAM-1) on the cell surface (see below). Nevertheless there are many more interferons and others can be generated by gene manipulation or synthesis. Some are being studied in the laboratory, and perhaps one will be found that is relatively less 'toxic' and so could be used for prophylaxis. One of the problems, however, is that there is no satisfactory laboratory test for the local inflammatory effect which is the 'toxic' effect that limits clinical use.",

Recently we have tried again with colds induced by RSV because it had been reported that RSV infections in children did not induce endogenous interferon, so that in this case added interferon might be expected to have an effect: unfortunately although IFN~ given prophylactically was highly effective, when given in maximum practicable doses immediately after symptoms appeared it conferred no benefit.",

These might be effective irrespective of the biological or serological type of virus, and might be free of the local adverse effects of interferons. We have recently investigated two of these. One was a muramyl dipeptide derivative which protected mice and guinea pigs when given in small doses intranasally prior to large doses of influenza viruses. However, when given in the maximum acceptable dose to volunteers it did not improve the clinical or laboratory parameters of experimental influenza, even though the strain used was partly attenuated and the dose given was not large . A thioguanosine derivative has been found which protects mice against coronavirus infection by enhancing their resistance (rather than by a direct antiviral effect) and this has also been studied in volunteers using colds induced by a coronavirus; analysis indicates that either it was given in too low a dose, or that it does not enhance the primate response in the same way as that of the rodent (Higgins et al., 1991) . In this field we are at a similar stage to that of work on interferons between 1957 and 1973 -we know that there are attractive theoretical possibilities but we do not know whether any such method can be made to work in man or what the 'benchmarks' for the properties of a candidate drug should be.",

For another thing more treatment regimes must be tried, in order to avoid return of symptoms and the appearance of drug-resistant viruses. Molecules with different antiviral spectra should be synthesized and investigated; they might be used in combination in order to produce a preparation which is active against a full range of serotypes, or it might be possible to exploit the synergism between different molecules which has been detected in vitro.",

A receptor molecule for the major group has now been identified and purified (Tomassini and Colonno, 1976 ) and recently has been cloned and sequenced by three groups and identified as ICAM-1 (intercellular adhesion molecule-l) (e.g. Staunton et al., 1989) which was previously known as a surface component of many cells including endothelium, is involved in interactions with lymphocytes, and is expressed in response to various cytokines including IFNT. Antibodies against ICAM-1 inhibit virus growth. Thus antibodies or other molecules that bind to virus or soluble ICAM-1 might be used to prevent and treat infections with major receptor group rhinoviruses. There will no doubt be vigorous research to find useful products of this type and also corresponding blockers for minor receptor group infections.",

It would be ideal to treat the infection by attacking the infectious agent, but it would be practical to commence this treatment only after symptoms and signs have developed. Such treatment might prevent the virus leading to more widespread disease, but this is uncommon and nasal symptoms will only subside gradually even if the infection is 'stopped in its tracks'. It is therefore arguable that in the case of infections like coronavirus or rhinovirus colds, which are normally quickly self-limited, the best approach would be to relieve the patient's discomfort and disability and leave their immune system to take care of the virus. Furthermore in the case of viral and bacterial infections of the gastrointestinal tract, most of those that lead to diarrhoea are best handled by managing their physiological effects, usually by oral rehydration, while the immune system controls the infection.",

We know, however, that antihistamines prevent specifically the symptoms of hay fever and allergic rhinitis because histamine is a key mediator in the pathogenic chain of these diseases. We do not have equally precise information for colds. Rather low amounts of leukotrines, prostaglandins and histamine have been found in nasal secretions in colds (Callow et al., 1988) and blocking cholinergic transmission has limited effect on cold symptoms (Gaffey et al., 1988) . On the other hand an inhibitor of mast cell degranulation, which impedes mediator release, has some beneficial effect on colds -even though this has not been proved to be due to an effect on mediators (Barrow et al., 1990a) . It is important to do such studies carefully and objectively -for menthol which has long been used because it relieves the symptoms of nasal obstruction apparently does so by blocking the sensory pathway from the nose and leaving the patency of the airway unchanged. Methods are available to measure blood flow, mucosal temperature as well as patency and nasal secretion but these are only occasionally used to document the effects of virus infection on the nose (Bende et al., 1989) or the anticipated benefits of treatment.",

It would be interesting to determine what changes glucocorticoids or heat induce in the nasal mucosa and try to identify those that are associated with reduced symptoms.

Nevertheless it is interesting that members of the first group of drugs shown to be effective against respiratory viruses in man, namely amantadine and its successors, are active when given therapeutically and by mouth. This seems to be because they have very advantageous pharrnacokinetics -they are well-absorbed and secreted actively into the respiratory tract (e.g. A1-Nakib et al., 1986) . On the other hand the particle-binding antirhinovirus drugs are very hydrophobic, which is probably the reason for their effectiveness, but it may also explain why they are not secreted with the mucus. As a result such molecules have to be given locally and the schedules of drug administration have to be quite demanding in order to keep the drug concentration high enough -they do not induce a long-lasting change like the antiviral state produced by interferon once it has attached to a cell. This indicates that antirhinovirus drugs with better pharmacokinetics, drug distribution and other properties might be more satisfactory clinically.",

However, we know that coronaviruses as well as paramyxoviruses or enteroviruses also make a small but significant contribution, and there is a substantial fraction due to as yet unidentified organisms (Larson et al., 1980) . This means that even if a highly effective specific rhinovirus treatment were developed it would provide no benefit for many colds. Nevertheless the human coronaviruses are now being explored at the molecular level, and infection with one serotype can already be diagnosed by the use of a nucleic acid probe (Myint et al., 1990) . For this reason we should keep our options open and be prepared to study not only the antimediator treatments mentioned above but also ill-understood empirical treatments, such as local zinc treatment or nasal hyperthermia, both of which were presented originally as antiviral treatments. The former was administered as oral lozenges and seemed to produce some symptomatic benefit but had no effect on the virus infection in studies at our Unit; but good studies done elsewhere, using a slightly different virus and experimental design, showed no benefit. Local hyperthermia with air at 43\u00b0C and 100% relative humidity was originally suggested as a way to inhibit the replication of rhinoviruses. In a study in volunteers no inhibition was detected but in a study in general practice it seemed to produce symptomatic improvement as mentioned above.",
