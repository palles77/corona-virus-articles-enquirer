            "text": "The three primary body cavities are (1) thoracic (pleural), (2) abdominal (peritoneal), and (3) pericardial. In health, these potential cavities contain a small amount of serous fluid that acts as a lubricant allowing the free motion of internal organs against one another and body cavity walls. The body cavities are lined by mesothelial cells, which are specialized cells that play an active role in the homeostasis of these potential spaces. The abnormal accumulation of fluid within a body cavity is called effusion. Effusion is not a disease in itself; rather, it results from alterations in fluid production, lymphatic drainage, or a combination of both. Some of the major factors that affect production and resorption of fluid include changes in capillary hydrostatic pressure, plasma osmotic pressure, and capillary permeability.",

Cyanosis may be present. With milder effusions, lethargy and lack of stamina may be the only clinical signs. Animals, especially cats, with mild to moderately severe effusions often adapt by decreasing their activity, thus concealing their illness until it is severe.

It is best to contact the laboratory for specific information regarding submission protocol, types of transport containers, and media, as many laboratories will provide special transport tubes and, in the case of anaerobic bacterial culture, special anaerobic tubes or media. In general, if the cytological evaluation of an effusion suggests bacterial infection caused by the presence of large numbers of neutrophils or if definitive bacteria are identified, the fluid should be cultured for both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. Fluid samples for aerobic and anaerobic cultures should be collected by using aseptic technique to avoid contamination. Fluid should be placed into a sterile tube (i.e., sterile red-top tube) without EDTA, which may be bacteriostatic or bactericidal. Note that some transport systems support both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. Submission of fluid for fungal culture should be performed as in the case of fluid submitted for aerobic bacterial culture.

Modified transudates often are the least specific categorization from a diagnostic standpoint. Various other classification schemes have been proposed, such as those based on etiology, septic versus nonseptic exudate, vascular or lymphatic disruption, internal organ rupture, or by the presence of particular cells exfoliated into the effusion. 16 Additionally, some schemes classify transudative effusions as protein-poor or protein-rich, addressing the general pathological mechanism of the effusions. 10 Classifying the effusion helps direct the clinician to the general mechanism of fluid accumulation and may provide a preliminary list of differential diagnoses. However, whatever schema is used, the effusion should always be interpreted in light of clinical signs, history, physical examination findings, laboratory data, imaging information, and importantly, results of cytological examination of the fluid. The results of the effusion fluid examination may be diagnostic for specific conditions, such as neoplasia or infection, or may simply indicate a process.

Cells found in transudative effusions consist primarily of mononuclear cells (macrophages and small lymphocytes), mesothelial cells, and low numbers of neutrophils. The general mechanism is fluid shifts caused by changes in oncotic and/or hydraulic pressure or impaired lymphatic drainage. Conditions associated with these mechanisms include severe hypoproteinemia (primarily hypoalbuminemia) (<1.0 g/dL) secondary to protein-losing nephropathy, hepatic insufficiency, protein-losing enteropathy, malnutrition, malabsorption, portal hypertension, and early myocardial insufficiency (more common in cats). Early bladder rupture may result in a fluid classified as a transudate; however, the nature of the effusion will change rapidly because uroperitoneum often induces a rapid chemical peritonitis. Intravenous fluid administration after marked blood loss may result in an acute and marked hypoproteinemia, which, in turn, may cause a transudative process triggered by an acute disruption in oncotic pressures and insufficient lymphatic drainage. 10 Modified transudates (also known as protein-rich transudates) occur because of increased hydraulic pressure caused by venous congestion in the lungs or liver. 10 TP concentration is greater than 2 g/dL, and the effusion often contains less than 5000 cells/\u03bcL. Effusion fluid color and turbidity may vary. Cells found in this effusion are reactive mesothelial cells, neutrophils, macrophages, and few small lymphocytes. Common conditions associated with modified transudates are congestive heart failure and portal hypertension. Dogs develop abdominal effusion secondary to right-sided heart failure, and cats often develop pleural effusion. Effusions caused by congestive heart failure are multifactorial and result from changes in vascular pressure, poor cardiac output, and retention of excess water. With portal hypertension, there is increased intrahepatic pressure and decreased lymphatic drainage, causing congestion and subsequent leakage of high-protein hepatic lymph into the abdominal cavity. No cytological finding in these effusions is pathognomonic for these conditions. Physical examination findings and imaging studies often help confirm functional abnormalities.

Clinical FIP may occur in cats of all ages, but the proportion of cats with FIP between ages 6 months and 2 years is significantly higher compared with the control cats in similar age groups. 19 In effusive FIP, fluid may accumulate in the abdomen, thorax, or pericardium or in all cavities. Evaluation of fluid may lend significant support to a diagnosis of FIP. The effusion is odorless, straw colored to golden, may contain flecks or fibrin strands, and foams upon agitation because of the high protein content, which is often greater than 4 g/dL. Cell counts may be variable but are typically 2000 to 6000 cells/\u03bcL, and typically hemodilution is minimal. Cytologically, the typical FIP effusion has a prominent stippled proteinaceous basophilic background (Fig. 15 .34) and consists primarily (60%-80%) of nondegenerate to mildly degenerate neutrophils and lesser numbers of macrophages, small lymphocytes, and occasionally plasma cells. Effusions consisting primarily of neutrophils but with large numbers of macrophages are referred to as pyogranulomatous and are also common in effusions associated with FIP. Although these findings are not diagnostic of FIP, when correlated with clinical findings, a presumptive diagnosis of FIP may be made. Other diagnostic tests are often used collaboratively to diagnose FIP. These include determining the albumin-to-globulin (A:G) ratio in serum and fluid. A serum A:G ratio less than 0.8 g/dL and effusion A:G ratio less than 0.9 g/ dL are often present with FIP. Anti-feline corona virus (FCoV) antibodies in serum should be interpreted with caution because many healthy cats are FCoV antibody positive. 19, 20 Low to medium titers (1:25, 1:100, 1:400) of FCoV antibodies are of no diagnostic value in determining FIP infection; however, antibody titers of 1:1600 increased the probability of FIP. 20 A negative test result does not rule out the possibility of FIP infection. In one study, the anti-FCoV antibody test was negative in 10% of the cats, which did, in fact, have FIP. 20 Tests that show promise include reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) performed on effusion fluids and an RT-PCR for the detection of FCoV messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Thus far, histological examination of affected tissue samples remains the gold standard for diagnosing FIP. ",

Macrophages may have small, punctate clear cytoplasmic vacuoles, and plasma cells may also present ( Fig. 15.40) .

Although small lymphocytes are typically thought of as the predominant cell type, chylous effusions may occur with predominantly neutrophils, lipid-containing macrophages, or both. 24 Increased neutrophils may occur secondary to inflammation induced by repeated thoracocentesis or merely the presence of chyle in the pleural cavity.

True pseudochylous effusions are a debated entity; however, they are opaque effusions that do not contain chyle. Instead, the white color is classically thought to be the result of cellular debris, lecithin globulin complex, cholesterol from cell membranes, or all of these. Pseudochylous effusions described in humans are most commonly the result of long-standing pleural effusions caused by tuberculosis, rheumatoid pleuritis, and malignant effusions, with resultant cell breakdown within the fluid. Despite much discussion about differentiating these two types of fluids, pseudochylous effusions are not well described in veterinary medicine and are rare in dogs and cats. 2, 24 Cytologically, the presence of cellular breakdown material, such as cholesterol crystals, and the lack of a significant lymphocytic cellular component may suggest a pseudochylous effusion (Fig. 15.41) .

Hemorrhagic effusions secondary to neoplasia may not contain neoplastic cells, or neoplastic cells may be present in low, moderate, or high numbers. The presence or absence of neoplastic cells in a hemorrhagic effusion is often dependent on the type of neoplasm. For example, mesenchymal neoplasms such as hemangiosarcoma (splenic, hepatic, cardiac) often lack neoplastic cells or contain low numbers of neoplastic cells within the hemorrhagic effusion. In comparison, if mesothelioma is associated with a hemorrhagic effusion, moderate to high numbers of atypical mesothelial cells may be evident. However, it should be kept in mind that reactive mesothelial cells may have significant atypia and that differentiating a reactive population from a malignant population is often difficult, even for experienced cytopathologists. Determining the etiology of a hemorrhagic effusion, just as in the case of other effusion categories, requires not only cytological assessment of the fluid but also correlation with clinical signs, history, laboratory data, imaging studies, and often fine-needle aspiration (FNA) of abnormalities found in the respective body cavity. Distinguishing hemorrhagic effusions from iatrogenic blood contamination or inadvertent aspiration of an organ (i.e., liver, spleen) is of diagnostic importance. Differentiating blood contamination from per-acute or acute hemorrhage may be difficult; however, assessment of clinical signs, physical examination findings, and laboratory data are helpful. Hemorrhage of greater than 24 hours' duration may be differentiated from blood contamination by identifying erythrophagocytosis in the sample (Fig. 15.43) and by noting the presence or absence of platelets and the RBC breakdown products, hemosiderin, and hematoidin ( Fig. 15.44) . When blood enters a body cavity, the platelets quickly aggregate, degranulate, and disappear. Also, RBCs are phagocytized and digested by macrophages. Therefore the presence of platelets and lack of erythrophagocytosis or heme breakdown products suggests either per-acute hemorrhage or iatrogenic blood contamination. Concurrent identification of platelets and erythrophagocytosis, with or without heme breakdown products, suggests either chronic hemorrhage or previous hemorrhage with iatrogenic contamination. The absence of platelets, with evidence of erythrophagocytosis, heme breakdown products, or a combination of both, supports chronic or previous hemorrhage.",

In one study, the sensitivity of cytological examination of effusions to detect malignant neoplasms was 64% in dogs and 61% in cats. 26 Poorly exfoliating tumors may have effusions in the modified transudate to exudative range if there is concurrent inflammation. Many tumors do not exfoliate neoplastic cells, and the absence of neoplastic cells within effusions does not rule out neoplasia. Similar to tissue aspirates, neoplastic cells in an effusion must be distinguished from dysplastic cells secondary to inflammation or reactive mesothelial cells. Thus the presence of concurrent inflammation in the fluid may confound the diagnosis of neoplasia, especially if neoplastic cells are not present in high numbers, do not exhibit significant cytological criteria of malignancy, or both. Distinguishing neoplastic epithelial cells (exfoliative carcinoma or adenocarcinoma) from mesothelioma, and mesothelioma from hyperplastic and reactive mesothelial cells, which are frequently found in both neoplastic and nonneoplastic fluids, is a particular challenge. This dilemma is discussed further in the section on mesothelioma below. Neoplastic effusions are inherently difficult samples to interpret for many of the reasons outlined above, and therefore in-house samples interpreted as neoplastic, or suspected of being neoplastic, should be confirmed by a veterinary clinical pathologist.",

Subtypes are based on histological evaluation of growth patterns (epithelioid, biphasic, sarcomatoid, and undifferentiated). Mesothelioma is often difficult to diagnose cytologically because of the moderate to marked pleomorphism exhibited by reactive mesothelial cells. Thus, when an effusion contains significant numbers of mesothelial cells where marked cytological criteria of malignancy is not evident, it is often impossible to differentiate mesothelial reactivity or hyperplasia from mesothelioma. When an effusion contains large numbers of mesothelial cells, and the cells exhibit marked criteria of malignancy-extreme macrocytosis, marked anisokaryosis, large variably shaped nucleoli, large numbers of mitotic figures, and aberrant mitoses-although diagnostic on cytology for a malignant exfoliative neoplasm, it may be nearly impossible to differentiate between mesothelioma, carcinoma, or adenocarcinoma (Figs. 15 .46 and 15.47). 26 Identification of a primary carcinoma/adenocarcinoma is helpful. If a primary tumor is not identified, histopathology of the affected mesothelium may be necessary. Often, a combination of history, imaging findings, cytology, and histopathology is needed to diagnose mesothelioma or to distinguish mesothelioma from epithelial neoplasia. Histological differentiation of reactive or hyperplastic mesothelial cells from neoplastic mesothelial cells may also be challenging, particularly if the biopsy sample is small and not representative of the lesion. Histologically, no single defined criterion to diagnose mesothelioma exists; however, assessment for neoplastic invasion into the submesothelial tissues and immunohistochemistry may be helpful. 27 Fig. 15 .48 demonstrates the histopathology of mesothelioma.",

When thymomas are associated with a thoracic effusion, the effusion may be inconclusive or suggestive of thymoma. An effusion associated with thymoma may contain large numbers of small lymphocytes, which are often a significant and predominant nonneoplastic cell population in thymomas. The presence of a prominent population of small lymphocytes, together with low to moderate numbers of well-differentiated mast cells (also a prominent cell population in thymomas), helps lend support to a diagnosis of thymoma if a cranial mediastinal mass is evident. It is uncommon for the neoplastic epithelial component to exfoliate, and if epithelial cells are present, it may be difficult to differentiate them from reactive mesothelial cells. The neoplastic epithelial cells have somewhat ill-defined borders, are found in aggregates and sheets, and contain small to moderate amounts of pale blue cytoplasm, round central nuclei, and indistinct nucleoli.

Direct aspiration, tissue biopsy and histopathology, or flow cytometry of either the mass or effusion fluid may be used to differentiate thymoma from thymic small cell lymphoma.
