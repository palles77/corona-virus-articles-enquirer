We report for the first time the identification of CRCoV in Italy, together with serological evidence that the virus has been circulating in the Italian dog population as from 2005. Serological investigations on 216 dog sera, carried out by an ELISA test using the strictly related bovine coronavirus (BCoV) as antigen, revealed an overall CRCoV seroprevalence of 32.06% in the last 2 years. RT-PCR targeting the S-gene of CRCoV was carried out on 109 lung samples collected from carcasses of dogs submitted for diagnostic investigations. Positive results were obtained from the lungs of a dog of the Apulia region that was co-infected with canine parvovirus type 2. Sequence analysis of the S-gene fragment amplified by RT-PCR (595 bp) showed similarity to group II coronaviruses, with the highest nucleotide identity (98%) to the only CRCoV strain currently available in the GenBank database (strain T101). The results of the present study show that CRCoV is present also in continental Europe, although further studies are required to determine the real pathogenic potential of the virus. #",

By means of serological testing, the prevalence of CRCoV in Italy was found to be similar to those assessed in UK (36%) and Republic of Ireland (30%) (Priestnall et al., 2006) rather than those observed in Japan (17.8%) (Kaneshima et al., 2006) and North America (54.7%) (Priestnall et al., 2006) . The BCoVbased ELISA test suggested that a group II coronavirus has been circulating in the Italian dog population not before 2005, whereas the first report of CRCoV identification in UK dates to 3 years ago (Erles et al., 2003) . However, due to the absence of representativity of the samples examined, it should be taken into account that these data are only indicative of the real circulation of the virus. The seropositivity increased with the age of the dogs, since CRCoV antibodies were detected at higher frequency in dogs over 6 months of age with respect to younger dogs.",

However, assuming the ELISA test as the 'gold standard', the HI test was proven to be poorly specific and sensitive, therefore not recommendable as an extensive diagnostic test. The poor specificity may be related to aspecific inhibitions of the haemagglutinating activity by substances present in the sera, whereas the lack in sensitivity may be a consequence of the high antibody titres probably required to prevent haemagglutination.",

(2003) . Despite the wide distribution of the virus in the organism, as determined by the RT-PCR positive results obtained from several tissues, attempts to isolate the virus on HRT-18 cells were unsuccessful. This finding could be explained with low amounts of virus present in the tissues or, alternatively, with virus inactivation during transportation or storage. A poor sensitivity of HRT-18 cells could be ruled out as this cell line has proved to be highly permissive for CRCoV growth . Although the dog was not reported to have respiratory signs, at necropsy some lesions were observed in the lungs. However, the involvement of CRCoV in the death of the infected dog could not be demonstrated, since a co-infection by CPV-2 was detected.",
