Particularly, the Chinese health-care system faces substantial challenges in its transformation from a profi t-driven public hospital-centred system to an integrated primary care-based delivery system that is cost eff ective and of better quality to respond to the changing population needs. An additional challenge is the government's latest strategy to promote private investment for hospitals. In this Review, we discuss how China's health-care system would perform if hospital privatisation combined with hospital-centred fragmented delivery were to prevail-population health outcomes would suff er; health-care expenditures would escalate, with patients bearing increasing costs; and a two-tiered system would emerge in which access and quality of care are decided by ability to pay. We then propose an alternative pathway that includes the reform of public hospitals to pursue the public interest and be more accountable, with public hospitals as the benchmarks against which private hospitals would have to compete, with performance-based purchasing, and with population-based capitation payment to catalyse coordinated care. Any decision to further expand the for-profi t private hospital market should not be made without objective assessment of its eff ect on China's health-policy goals.",

To achieve this goal, China launched a nationwide systemic reform in 2009, supported by infusions of substantial public funding. The reform marked a departure from the market-oriented strategy used after the liberalisation of the economy in 1978, and re-instated the government's role in the fi nancing of health care and provision of public goods. In only 4 years, the reform produced substantial positive results in expansion of insurance coverage and strengthening of the infrastructure of primary health-care facilities, but much still needs to be done to reform China's health-care delivery. Particularly, China faces major challenges in transformation of its underperforming hospital-centric, fragmented system into one that delivers high-quality and effi cient care to meet the emerging health needs and rising patient expectations associated with rapid ageing, environmental deterioration, urbanisation, and other socioeconomic transformations.",

The government decided that most additional fi nance should be used to subsidise rural and urban residents not already covered by the Urban Employee Basic Medical Insurance (UEBMI) programme to enrol in the New Cooperative Medical Scheme (NCMS) or the Urban Resident Basic Medical Insurance programme (URBMI), respectively. The government also directly paid primary health-care providers to deliver a defi ned package of public health services. This, together with the services covered by these three health insurance programmes (hereafter referred to as social health insurance [SHI] ), constitutes the basic health care fi nanced by the government. To strengthen the primary health-care networks, the reform invested in infrastructure and provider training, and established the Essential Medicine Program to improve the safety, quality, and effi ciency of primary health-care services.

The government is moving towards integration of all three existing insurance programmes, starting with the NCMS and URBMI schemes initially, to increase risk pooling and equalise benefi t packages. 3 Table 1 describes the 2009 reform, its progress and challenges, and the government's short-term plans. [2] [3] [4] [5] At present, 96% of the population is covered by one of the three insurance schemes. However, progress in service delivery reform has been slow. Despite substantial investment in infrastructure and training at the primary health-care level, visits and admissions continue to take place mainly at secondary and tertiary hospitals. 6 Primary health-care facilities have not been able to perform a gate-keeping function, and health-care delivery remains hospital-centred and fragmented. Public hospital reform has been stymied. Pilots in 17 cities yielded few lessons for guiding policy formulation. Premier Li Keqiang described China's health-care reform as having entered the \"deep water zone\", especially in reference to the diffi culties of reformation of profi t-driven public hospitals. 7 Between 2007 and 2012, real per capita total health expenditure and gross domestic product increased at annual rates of 14\u00b79% and 10\u00b72%, respectively. 1 Subsequently, although expansion of health insurance coverage has led to increases in insurance reimbursement, it has neither reduced illness-related fi nancial burdens faced by households nor improved quality of care. 2, 8 If health expenditure continues to grow unabated, the sustainability of the insurance programmes will be at risk, with patients ultimately bearing the cost.",

The rationale of the 20% target and whether the government intends further market expansion beyond 2015 remains unknown. Companion policies putting private hospitals on equal footing with public hospitals are being introduced-eg, the three insurance schemes would contract with private hospitals, and physicians working in the private hospitals would qualify for promotion within the medical professional ranking system. 11 At the same time, no new building projects or expansion of public hospital beds will be approved. How the government plans to regulate the private hospitals and, more importantly, can regulations be eff ectively enforced in the Chinese context, are both open questions at the moment.

They can range from fully integrated models that combine primary health care and hospital services into one delivery system that includes all aspects of care for a defi ned population, to the more common disease management programmes, which are narrower approaches to co ordinated care with a focus on population groups with specifi c health conditions. Unlike fully integrated models, disease management programmes do not usually include major structural changes to the health-care system. Instead, they integrate care decisions usually through a care coordinator (for the purpose of this Review, we do not diff erentiate integrated and coordinated care). 17, 18 There are also attempts to integrate medical and social care for an ageing population with multimorbidities. 19 Panel 1 describes existing evidence on the eff ects of integrated care. The scientifi c literature shows that See Online for appendix integrated care encompasses a wide range of interventions whose eff ects are dependent on the specifi c design of the programme and the contexts in which they are implemented. A synthesis of evidence from 19 systematic reviews suggests that available evidence \"points to a positive impact of integrated care programmes on the quality of patient care and improved health or patient satisfaction outcomes but uncertainty remains about the relative eff ectiveness of diff erent approaches and their impacts on costs\". 31 However, it remains \"challenging to interpret the evidence from existing primary studies, which tend to be characterised by heterogeneity in the defi nition and description of the intervention and components of care under study\". 31 The authors also emphasise the importance of assessment of integrated care as a complex strategy to innovate and implement long standing change in service delivery that includes several changes at many levels, rather than one intervention. 31 The state of knowledge on integrated care is still in its early stages. In practice, there is no single model of the primary health-care-centred integrated delivery model that would fi t all nations. Many countries (even those with advanced economies) still experiment with models that suit their contexts best. However, a primary health-care-centred integrated delivery model, that focuses on population-based prevention and care coordination off ers a rational course for China to pursue given the changing needs of its population. Similar to other nations that have embarked on this course, China would have to innovate and discover its own model,",

Ofman and colleagues 26 reviewed 102 studies representing 11 chronic conditions to assess the clinical and economic eff ects of disease management. They identifi ed that in patients with depression, high cholesterol, cardiac insuffi ciency, high blood pressure, and type 2 diabetes, those who received coordinated care were more likely to see improvements than were patients in control groups who received normal care. 26 Gohler and colleagues 27 did a meta-analysis of 36 studies spanning 13 countries that compared the coordinated management with care of congestive heart failure and identifi ed a 3% reduction in mortality and an 8% reduction in re-hospitalisations, compared with regular care. Kruis and colleagues 28 reviewed randomised controlled trials assessing integrated disease management programmes for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and noted that integrated programmes reduced hospital admissions and length of stay but had no eff ect on mortality between comparison and control groups. However, another Cochrane review 29 on integration of services that are usually delivered through vertical programmes, such as HIV/AIDS, family planning, and maternal child health into primary health services in low-income and middle-income countries, showed no evidence of improved health-care delivery or health status. This Review diff ers from others in looking at integration of several services for diff erent health conditions in one health-care provider, rather than coordination of diff erent providers involved in treating one health condition. Similarly, the Medicare Coordinated Care Demonstration-a systematic assessment of disease management and care coordinationidentifi ed no diff erence in hospital admissions in 13 of 15 randomised controlled studies and no eff ect on Medicare expenditures overall between 2002 and 2006. However, the 15 selected host programmes diff ered widely in their organisational structure, target populations, and approach to coordination. The authors note the potential of replication of results from the two successful programmes by promotion of key programme features. These features included frequent in-person patient contact with coordinators, close ties between care coordinators and physicians, and links with local hospitals to ease the transition after hospital admission. 30 Examples of integrated care for elderly people include the North American Programme for All-inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE) in the USA and the Torbay Care Trust in the UK. Although the fi rst targets elderly people who live in communities within a set service area, Torbay focuses on high-risk patients who need intensive ongoing support from community nurses and wider integrated teams. Both programmes experienced a decrease in inpatient and nursing home use, especially emergency visits, and an increase in home and community-based services. PACE also decreased Medicare costs in comparison to non-enrolees, whererase Torbay delivered improved system performance at no additional cost. 19 Generally, rigorous assessments of integrated care for the elderly population are scarce because many of them are relatively new.",

Furthermore, admission rates for complications from diabetes in China are more than fi ve times the rate in countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries, a sign of poor primary health care. 14 A major challenge is how to transform primary health care delivery from an approach based on patients and episodes to a population-based approach. Increased funding and infrastructure, building are necessary, but not suffi cient to bring about this transformation. A reformed medical education curriculum and other innovative programmes to train a new cadre of modern primary health-care providers are needed. 36 However, how long this will take is unclear.",

            "text": "Primary health-care centres and hospitals in China operate independently and compete for patients. We predict that this situation will persist for several reasons. First, providers of all facility levels are mainly paid by fee-for-service, creating incentives to increase activities rather than improve patient health. Providers have no incentive to coordinate care with other health-care professionals because their fi nancial interest is to keep rather than refer patients to an appropriate site of treatment. The government has announced a shift from fee-for-service to other forms of provider payment, such as case-based payments, capitation, and global budget. However, they have so far been implemented as facility-specifi c rather than population-based payments, and therefore, do not provide incentives for several providers to coordinate care decisions. Second, fragmentation in fi nance creates barriers for the integration of services. Although primary health-care providers are mostly fi nanced by government subsidies to provide primary care, hospitals are paid by SHIs and patient out-of-pocket payments. Primary health-care facilities have no fi nancial leverage over hospitals. Third, in many cases SHI coverage is more generous for inpatient than outpatient services, incentivising patients to seek hospital care fi rst because, generally, patients do not trust the quality of primary health-care facilities. All these factors make it diffi cult for primary health care to have a gatekeeping role. Exacerbation of this situation means that, within the medical profession, specialists are held in high esteem, whereas primary health-care providers are not well respected, creating further barriers for them to have the care-coordinator role. Perhaps the greatest barrier to a primary health-care-centred integrated delivery model approach is the dominant profi t-driven hospital sector, irrespective of whether the hospital is public or private.",

Although these pilots score well in movement towards an integrated health information system, they generally do not have appropriate providers and patient incentives and dedicated care coordinators.

            "text": "Unlike most public hospitals in the world, Chinese public hospitals are an embodiment of both government and market failures. On the one hand, they are governed by bureaucratic rules and subject to confl icting policies from the many ministries that govern them. 2 Hospital directors and managerial staff are mostly government-appointed offi cials who are accountable to the government. 53 They do not have any autonomy over hiring and fi ring decisions, which are restricted by rigid Civil Service Rules. 54 On the other hand, public hospitals are motivated by profi ts and behave similarly to any other for-profi t organisation. They have built-in incentives to prescribe excessive diagnostic tests and pharmaceuticals to earn profi ts for distribution to physicians and fi nance hospital expansion. Most public hospitals have to earn 90% of their revenue from services provided, with government direct subsidies making up the rest. Meanwhile, the government sets fee schedules with prices for offi ce visits and hospital bed-days set below cost and the latest diagnostic and medical technologies set above cost. Providers are allowed to charge a 15% mark-up on drugs. Physicians are incentivised to prescribe drugs and tests that are not clinically needed because their bonuses are frequently tied to these revenues. [55] [56] [57] [58] [59] For these same reasons, hospital managers race to introduce high-tech services and expensive imported drugs to boost revenues. In this way, many public facilities act as private entities, putting profi t above patient welfare. 60, 61 To compound the problem, pharmaceutical and medical equipment companies provide hospitals and physicians with benefi ts for prescription of their products. All these have resulted in the large share of health expenditure spent on drugs in China. In 2011, expenditure on drugs as a share of total health expenditure was 43% percent compared with an OECD average of 16%, 62 and drug revenues accounted for 41\u00b74% of total hospital revenues. 6 Because physician staff are the residual claimants of profi ts in public hospitals, they are de facto shareholders of the public hospitals. Hence, public hospitals have neither the motivation nor the incentive to integrate care with primary health-care providers or make treatment decisions based on cost-eff ectiveness or population health maximisation criteria.",

There are no explicit care coordination functions in these models. This model was piloted by two medical groups in Shanghai in 2011-Ruijin-Luwan and Xinhua-Chongming. Ruijing Hospital and the Xinhua Hospital Chongming Branch are the tertiary hospitals at the core of this three-tiered integrated delivery system. 38 They are supported by two secondary hospitals and several primary facilities.

However, problems are emerging, particularly because of the bi-directional nature of referrals-in practice, only referrals to higher level hospitals work because of the relatively low-quality of care in primary hospitals. and that competition can lead to improvements in manage ment effi ciency gains. 77, 78 However, in the case of China, if public hospitals continue to be subject to bureaucratic governance, competition will unlikely translate to improvements in management.",

If the parent company of a private hospital were a pharmaceutical or medical device fi rm, incentives to overprescribe would be even more reinforced. 79 As the 12th FYP has identifi ed the biomedical industry as one of the seven strategic industries for stimulation of the economy, both pharmaceutical and medical device companies are making aggressive moves into China's market. 80 Although the government introduced a Certifi cate of Need policy in 2005 to regulate the purchase of expensive medical equipment, 81 it has not been enforced eff ectively. A study in four Chinese cities showed that the number of CTs and MRIs increased by 50% on average between 2006 and 2009. [82] [83] [84] [85] [86] Overall, our assessment suggests that China's prospect of provision of aff ordable and equitable access to health care with a primary health-care-centred integrated delivery model approach would be relatively dismal. The for-profi t motive of large public hospitals would result in escalation of health-care cost, ineffi cient use of pharmaceutical and high-tech diagnostic tests, and an absence of incentives for public hospitals to integrate care with primary health-care facilities. Entrance of private investment will further exacerbate these trends. To remain solvent, insurance programmes might limit payments, reduce resources for primary health-care services, and pass the higher costs on to patients as out-of-pocket costs. A two-tier system would emerge, with rich people serviced by the for-profi t private hospitals and another tier for the rest of the population, leading to unequal access to and quality of care. In the long term, population health outcomes would suff er while the burden of rising health-care expenditures continues to increase.",

In this section, we propose a way forward, taking into account what China has already embarked on, what is feasible in view of existing institutional constraints, and supplemented by international experience. We take as a starting point that the government will continue to fund basic health care, mainly through SHI, with some direct funding to primary health-care facilities and that it is highly unlikely that the government will reverse course to directly pay hospitals from government budgets; and that the for-profi t private hospital market share will continue to grow as a result of government policies and increased demand from a population with rising income. Therefore, the question is how to introduce systemic changes that would make the best use of these conditions, bearing in mind ongoing reform eff orts described in table 1. Figure 1 shows the systemic framework followed in our proposal. We fi rst discuss what the government might do to improve the organisation of health-care delivery and then how fi nancing and provider payment incentives could be used to further enhance improvements of delivery. Figure 1 provides a schematic representation of the various policy levers that could aff ect health-care delivery decisions, either independently or in combination with one another. The organisational features of the health sector-such as ownership, governance, market competition, level of integration, and norms of practice-all aff ect health-care delivery practices. Additionally, how health care is fi nanced and how providers are paid substantially aff ects treatment decisions because they create diff erent incentives for providers. Regulation could also be used, but its eff ect is often dampened by poor enforcement. Table 3 provides a brief description of the fi nancing, key organisational features, and provider payment methods used by selected Asian countries to put our proposal in the global context.",

This is consistent with already announced government directives clarifying the role and objective of public hospitals to pursue the public interest 93,94 defi ned as \"making the most effi cient use of available public resources to maximize the benefi ts for the people-providing equal, accessible and quality healthcare to everyone\". 95 To achieve this objective, a new accountability system needs to be established to hold public hospitals accountable for delivery of cost-eff ective services on an equitable basis. To promote public hospitals to coordinate with primary health care, assessment can be based on a set of indicators that emphasises population-based prevention and management, quality of care, service provision to poor people, and patient satisfaction. Similar to the Hospital Foundation Trusts in England [96] [97] [98] and public hospitals in Hong Kong, 99 a board should be set up to which public hospitals are accountable to. Unlike existing boards in China, which mainly consist of government offi cials, they should be made up of representatives from local communities. Public",

According to Shanghai's government guidance, social insurance is supposed to pay an integrated delivery network a global budget that covers all the providers within the network. To what extent it has been implemented is unclear 38, 39, [42] [43] [44] [45] Patient incentives Tiered reimbursement structures, referrals for specialist services, approvals for expensive diagnostic tests, and insurance discounts for engagement in health promotion activities or registering with accredited integrated delivery organisations motivate consumers to access the health-care system in the most cost-eff ective way 21, 41, 47 For most pilots, there is no diff erential tiered reimbursement schedule from SHI specifi cally developed to incentivise patients to use primary health care In some models, reimbursement rates for referred cases are higher than for non-referred cases In most models, obtaining referrals from community health centres fast tracks patients for appointments at higher-level hospitals 38, 39, [42] [43] [44] [45] Role of primary health care In several countries, registration with general practitioners is compulsory or highly incentivised fi nancially with primary care providers acting as gatekeepers to the wider health-care system Multispecialty medical groups are made up of doctors from a number of specialties who take on a budget to provide all or some of the services needed by the population that they serve Transitional care models redirect care from hospital settings back towards the community, shifting care from physicians towards more multidisciplinary teams that include nurses, therapists, and social care workers All service delivery setups include some kind of case management with primary health care at the centre 17, 41, 47 Most pilots are set up with the purpose of reduction of overcrowding at tertiary hospitals by redirecting patients to a lower level of facilities. They are not set up for care-coordination according to clinical protocols In most cases, community centres are supposed to play the gatekeeping role. Whether this has been successfully implemented is not known Primary health-care providers do not seem to play a core role in carecoordination. In fact, most of the networks are led by tertiary hospitals 38, 39, [42] [43] [44] [45] Decision support for providers Peer review, standardised care protocols, cross-disciplinary interactions, and training increasingly broadens the scope of various health-care professionals to act as patient care coordinators 26, 41, 46, 50 There is no explicitly defi ned care coordinator for the full continuum of services for a patient and period of time across the health facilities within the group Higher-level facilities second experts to the next lower level for training Whether there are multidisciplinary team based practice is unclear 38, 39, [42] [43] [44] [45] Health information system The use of standardised electronic health records that are interoperable across provider institutions is common in high performance integrated systems 21, 22, 25, 41 All have realised the essential role of health information technology in integrated care systems. Some integrated care groups (eg, Ruijin-Luwan), have established medical information exchange platforms and participated in information exchange across providers and care settings 38, 39, [42] [43] [44] [45] Enabling regulations Regulation and changes in organisational infrastructure facilitating the clinical integration of providers are less common and need strong government leadership and support from health-care professionals. Often what is necessary is a relaxation of regulations that impede clinical integration 41, 46, 48 The integration between providers has been impeded by some nationwide regulations. For instance, the number of health facilities where a doctor can practice is regulated (eg, three affi liations per doctor), which means that doctors cannot practice in all health facilities within a network. Also, there are regulations about what drugs each level of facility can dispense. If a patient is referred down to a community centre for rehabilitation, the community centre might not have the medicine that the patient needs. Some pilots are attempting to relax these restrictions 51, 52 SHI=social health insurance. General description Two-tiered system with the government directly funding public hospitals or clinics and the private sector fi nanced by a mix of direct out-of-pocket payment and private insurance and primarily serving the higher-income and middle-income groups. A hospital sector dominated by public providers and a primary care sector dominated by private clinics creates a barrier for service integration. Quality of care in the private sector is poorly regulated and highly variable",

Hospitals that perform well would be publicly honoured and receive bonuses for their dedication to serving patient interests. Additionally, to improve effi ciency, the government should revamp the governance of public hospitals by giving hospital directors the autonomy to hire and fi re staff based on performance and to set up compensation and incentive schemes within their hospitals to align the staff 's incentives to pursue the public interest. Physicians should be paid a reasonable salary with the ability to earn extra bonuses based on the quality of care provided rather than the revenue generated, thus removing compensation from behaviour in prescription of drugs. This new scheme must be accompanied by a revision of the fee schedule that covers the cost of health services, removing the need to use profi t-making drugs and high-tech diagnostic tests as compensation for lost revenue. To do this, China needs to establish a standardised cost accounting system in all public hospitals.",

The Chinese Government is already advancing some of these policies and if further developed and appropriately implemented, we predict that in 10-15 years China would be able to establish at least one fl agship public hospital as a benchmark in each geographical market against which both public and private hospitals could compete. In the future, when not-for-profi t private hospitals enter with the objective to pursue the public interest, the government could also work with them to establish them as fl agships.",

We anticipate that this market would increase over time with continuous technological advancements, rising consumer expectations for higher-end services, and a possibly slower rate of increase of government funding for health care as growth in GDP moderates. Public and private provision would coexist, although the private sector would largely be concentrated in urban areas providing hospital services.",

International experience has shown that the more integrated the payers (or SHI schemes in this case), the more leverage they have to make changes in the delivery system. Canada, Japan, Taiwan, and South Korea all have single-payer systems that have shown their ability to control health expenditure growth (table 3 ). In addition to integration, SHI would gradually become a more strategic purchaser. Chinese SHI's main objective is to balance costs with little concern for quality of care. The Ministry of Finance, as the fi nancier, should hold the purchaser accountable for the quality of care that they purchase for their enrolees.",

In the long-term when primary health-care facilities have developed their capacity, they could act as a budget holder and take primary responsibility as care coordinators. However, secondary level hospitals (equivalent to district hospitals elsewhere) could initially play this part because most primary health-care facilities in China might not have the necessary technical or managerial capacities initially.

Similar to the Singaporean model, class A wards off ering more conveniences (eg, a private room) would be charged at cost, whereas class C wards off ering less comforts would be subsidised at a much higher percentage of cost to assure equal clinical quality of treatment. 108, 109 Continue to strengthen primary health care Needless to say, the government should continue its ongoing reform to strengthen primary health care, and fund and provide traditional public goods such as clean water, sanitation, and vector control, for which the private sector will neither fund nor provide. Additionally, for eff ective prevention and control of non-communicable diseases, the government should develop a multisectoral strategy that includes both targeted high-risk group identifi cation and population-wide interventions aimed at reduction of risk factors such as obesity, tobacco use, and sedentariness.",

However, substantial challenges in the reform of its delivery system, together with a new policy to promote private hospitals could derail China from achievement of its goals. The challenges that it faces are complex and there is no stand-alone policy that would provide the magic bullet. We suggest a systemic approach that integrates benchmark competition, improved public hospital accountability, stronger coordination across levels of care, and increased performance-based purchasing to leverage changes in health-care delivery towards a more cost-eff ective and high-quality system that serves the changing needs of China's population.",

Particularly, China should assess how the entry of private hospitals aff ects its health-care system before it makes any decision to further expand their market share. Otherwise, China might not be able to rein in a runaway delivery system plagued with inequity and cost escalation.",

We undertook three main scientifi c literature searches for on the eff ect of hospital competition, ownership, and integrated or coordinated care.

We limited results to articles, book chapters, or reports classifi ed as reviews. We excluded earlier reviews that were included in more recent papers. For subjects of which no reviews exist, we also reviewed individual studies. Database searches include PubMed, journal storage (JSTOR), Wiley Online Library, and Google Scholar. For coordinated or integrated care, we also searched the websites of organisations such as the King's Fund, the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development, the European Observatory, and the Commonwealth Fund. We further refi ned the results to chronic disease treatment or management. For descriptive reviews, we excluded reviews that included only one country. The search was complemented by references cited in relevant studies and suggestions from peer-reviewers. We included studies published between Jan 1, 1999 and June 17, 2014. For the examples of Chinese pilots of integrated care, we searched China National Knowledge Infrastructure and Wanfang for Chinese language papers using key words \"yi lian ti\" or \"yi liao lian he ti\" (in Chinese). Only papers in English and Chinese were used.",
