            "text": "Molecular mechanisms of RNA recombination were studied in turnip crinkle carmovirus (TCV), which has a uniquely high recombination frequency and nonrandom crossover site distribution among the recombining TCV-associated satellite RNAs. To test the previously proposed replicase-driven template-switching mechanism for recombination, a partially purified TCV replicase preparation (RdRp) was programed with RNAs resembling the putative in vivo recombination intermediates. Analysis of the in vitro RdRp products revealed efficient generation of 3\u0408-terminal extension products. Initiation of 3\u0408-terminal extension occurred at or close to the base of a hairpin that was a recombination hotspot in vivo. Efficient generation of the 3\u0408-terminal extension products depended on two factors: (i) a hairpin structure in the acceptor RNA region and (ii) a short base-paired region formed between the acceptor RNA and the nascent RNA synthesized from the donor RNA template. The hairpin structure bound to the RdRp, and thus is probably involved in its recruitment. The probable role of the base-paired region is to hold the 3\u0408 terminus near the RdRp bound to the hairpin structure to facilitate 3\u0408terminal extension. These regions were also required for in vivo RNA recombination between TCV-associated sat-RNA C and sat-RNA D, giving crucial and direct support for a replicase-driven template-switching mechanism of RNA recombination.",

RNA recombination is well documented for a large number of viruses, and is believed to have affected viral evolution and adaptation (King, 1988; Strauss and Strauss, 1988; Lai, 1992; Dolja and Carrington, 1992; Simon and Bujarski, 1994) .

For the tricomponent BMV, inserting a short RNA1-derived sequence into an RNA3 derivative in the complementary orientation induced the generation of nonhomologous RNA1-RNA3 recombinants (Nagy and Bujarski, 1993) . In addition, insertion of a short RNA2derived region in the direct orientation into an RNA3 derivative facilitated RNA2-RNA3 crossovers that were of the homologous type, since the junctions were located precisely within the common regions . A replicase-driven template-switching mechanism for both homologous and non-homologous recombination was supported by the distribution of recombinant junctions on the RNAs and the observation that mutations within the two virus-encoded components of the replicase influenced the frequency of recombinant accumulation and the distribution of junction sites Bujarski, 1993, 1997; Figlerowitz et al., 1997) . Using chimeric tombusviruses, White and Morris (1995) found that preferred junction sites were the 5\u0408 termini and strong hairpin structures in the donor templates. Hairpin structures that were proposed to facilitate the re-initiation of RNA synthesis during the template-switching events were also involved in generating TCV recombinants (Cascone et al., 1990 (Cascone et al., , 1993 Carpenter et al., 1995) .",

RNA species in the latter two groups are the products of natural recombination. For example, the chimeric sat-RNA C (356 nucleotides) is composed of sequences similar to a satellite RNA 194 nucleotides) at its 5\u0408 end and two 3\u0408-proximal regions from TCV genomic RNA at its 3\u0408 end (Simon and Howell, 1986) . High frequency recombination was observed in vivo between sat-RNA D and sat-RNA C, with the recombination junctions clustered close to or at the 3\u0408 end of sat-RNA D and at the base of a hairpin (designated motif1hairpin) in the center portion of sat-RNA C (Cascone et al., 1990 (Cascone et al., , 1993 . Non-compensatory mutations in the stem of the motif1-hairpin eliminated detectable recombinants in vivo. In addition, part of the sequence of the motif1-hairpin contains similarity with the 5\u0408-end region of the TCV genomic RNA that probably contains the promoter for positive strand synthesis. These results suggested that the motif1-hairpin is involved in recruitment of the RdRp during re-initiation of synthesis following the template switch. The model predicted that the viral replicase (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, RdRp) uses the nascent, positive-stranded sat-RNA D as a primer to resume RNA elongation on the acceptor sat-RNA C template during the recombination events (Cascone et al., 1993; Simon and Nagy, 1996) .",

In this report, two questions relevant to the strand transfer and primer elongation steps have been studied: (i) how a promoter-dependent RdRp, such as the TCV RdRp, associates with the acceptor RNAs and (ii) how the RdRp is capable of primer extension, a process fundamentally different from de novo initiation. We report the development of a cell-free (in vitro) system that uses hybrid RNAs that resembled putative recombination intermediates to program partially purified TCV RdRp preparations. These hybrid RNAs supported 3\u0408-terminal extension (3\u0408-TX), which is analogous to primer extension proposed to occur in vivo by the TCV RdRp (Cascone et al., 1993; Simon and Nagy, 1996) . Comparison of the in vitro and in vivo results demonstrates that the in vitro system can faithfully copy most of the aspects of the in vivo system, giving direct support for a replicase-driven template-switching mechanism for RNA recombination.",

In addition, the TCV RdRp is capable of primer elongation, but only from the 3\u0408 end of the plus strand and only in the presence of a functional promoter (i.e. the TCV RdRp was unable to extend primers hybridizing randomly at internal positions) ; C.Song and A.E. Simon, unpublished) . However, according to the model of RNA recombination in TCV, the RdRp must be able to extend on the nascent strand at internal positions on the template RNA using the nascent RNA strand as a primer during the crossover events. To determine whether the TCV RdRp is capable of primer extension when supplied with putative recombination intermediates, we have used an in vitro system that includes the putative recombination intermediates of a previously defined RNA recombination system between sat-RNA C and sat-RNA D: the negative-stranded sat-RNA C, TCV RdRp, and positive-stranded, nearly full-length nascent strand of sat-RNA D ( Figure 1A ). The model also predicts that the nascent positive strand of sat-RNA D is used by the TCV RdRp as a primer to extend RNA synthesis on the acceptor sat-RNA C from the base of the motif1-hairpin (Cascone et al., 1990) . Sequence comparison of junction regions revealed complementarity between the 3\u0408-end region of the nascent sat-RNA D positive strand and a region 3\u0408 of the motif1-hairpin in the negative strand of sat-RNA C ( Figure 1A) , with the sequences predicted to form a stable base-paired structure (priming stem).",

The TCV RdRp preparation was programed with RNA templates that were designed to resemble the above-described putative recombination intermediates ( Figure 1B ). One of these constructs, designated CD-13mini, consisted of sequences corresponding to the central portion of the negative strand of sat-RNA C (total of 84 nucleotides, including the in vivo recombination hotspot region and the motif1-hairpin, plus short 5\u0408-and 3\u0408-flanking sequences) and a 28 nucleotide segment of the positive-stranded sat-RNA D with the 3\u0408 terminus representing the in vivo recombination hotspot position -13 (relative to the 3\u0408 end) ( Figure 1B ). This hybrid construct was designed to avoid known transcriptional promoters in sat-RNA C minus strands and sat-RNA D plus strands. A six-nucleotide artificial loop sequence was used to covalently link the sat-RNA D plus strand fragment to the sat-RNA C minus strand fragment, as depicted in Figure 1B , to ensure that an optimal 1:1 molar ratio of interacting sequences were in proximity and in the correct orientation. If the model for recombination between sat-RNAs D and C is correct, then the TCV RdRp should start 3\u0408-TX, analogously to recombination in vivo, at the base of the motif1-hairpin in the hybrid construct ( Figure 1C ). This 'self-primed' 3\u0408-TX reaction is expected to generate a product that has a hairpin-like structure with a long double-stranded region and short loop sequence (schematically shown in Figure 1C ).",

Treatment of the 3\u0408-TX product with single strandspecific S1 nuclease resulted in degradation of the 3\u0408-TX product into two new radiolabeled RNA species, one migrating at a position of~80 nucleotides, and the second at~65 nucleotides ( Figure 1D ). The occurrence of two S1 nuclease-resistant products is probably due to partial digestion at the mismatched region in the priming stem Fig. 1 . An in vitro system to study RNA recombination in TCV. (A) The in vivo system. Model for RNA recombination between sat-RNA D and sat-RNA C by a replicase-driven template-switching mechanism. The recombination intermediates are depicted, showing the possible RNA-RNA interaction between the nascent sat-RNA D plus strand, truncated at position -13 at the 3\u0408 end (in in vivo experiments, the junctions were located most frequently at positions -13 to -15, as counted from the 3\u0408 end), and sequence 3\u0408 of the motif1-hairpin of sat-RNA C minus strand (the acceptor RNA strand). Sat-RNA D sequence is boxed in black. Underlined nucleotides at the base of the motif1-hairpin indicate the location of the in vivo junction site hotspot in sat-RNA C. In the rectangles representing the sat-RNAs, similar regions are shaded alike. (B) In vitro system that mimics the putative in vivo recombination intermediate. Top construct (CD-13mini) contains 28 nucleotides from sat-RNA D plus strand (boxed in black), extending from position -13 at the 3\u0408 end, joined by a six-base artificial sequence (5\u0408-GAAUUC-3\u0408) to sat-RNA C minus strand sequence that includes 33 nucleotides 3\u0408 of the motif1-hairpin, the motif1-hairpin, and 18 nucleotides 5\u0408 of the hairpin (plus two non-viral G residues at the 5\u0408 end). Bottom construct (CD-27mini), same as CD-13mini except that the sat-RNA D sequence terminates at the -27 position and two mismatches in the priming stem are mutated such that base pairing can occur throughout the priming stem.

Addition of partially purified TCV RdRp, ribonucleotides and radioactive UTP results in an intramolecular extension from the 3\u0408-terminal sat-RNA D sequence for CD-13mini and CD-27mini using sat-RNA C sequence as template. The radiolabeled portion of the product is shown by a thick dotted line. S1 nuclease-sensitive and RNase H-sensitive (following hybridization of loop1 oligo DNA to the loop region, depicted by a solid line) sites are indicated. (D) Efficient 3\u0408-TX by the TCV RdRp.

Lanes depicted by -, S1 and H denote products that were untreated, or treated with either S1 nuclease or RNase H, respectively. M, single-stranded RNA markers (in bases). The template RNAs were CD-13mini (B), CD-14mini (one base 3\u0408-end truncation derivative of CD-13mini) and CD-27mini (B).

Specific digestion of the loop region of the 3\u0408-TX products obtained with CD-13mini template by RNase H in the presence of an oligodeoxyribonucleotide (loop1 oligo, complementary to the loop region of CD-13mini) ( Figure 1C ) resulted in a single radiolabeled RNA product migrating at a position of~85 nucleotides ( Figure 1D ). In combination with the S1 analysis, the data indicate that initiation of 3\u0408-TX occurred at the base of the motif1hairpin on the CD-13mini template (schematically shown in Figure 1C ).",

While the -14 position was a frequent junction in in vivo recombinants, the -27 position has never been found (Cascone et al., 1990 (Cascone et al., , 1993 Carpenter et al., 1995) . In addition, CD-27mini contained two mutations that allowed for complete hybridization between sat-RNA D and the region 3\u0408 of the sat-RNA C motif1-hairpin ( Figure 1B ). CD-14mini and CD-27mini generated the hairpin-sized 3\u0408-TX products that migrated similarly to the 3\u0408-TX product obtained with CD-13mini ( Figure 1D ). The sizes of the S1 nucleasedigested products were also similar for CD-13mini and CD-14mini, while CD-27mini had only a single S1 nuclease-resistant product that co-migrated with the~80 nucleotide product for CD-13mini ( Figure 1D ). The existence of a single S1 nuclease-resistant radiolabeled 3\u0408-TX product for CD-27mini was consistent with the lack of mismatched bases in the primer stem region of CD-27mini eliminating the S1 nuclease-sensitive site present in CD-13mini and CD-14mini. Since CD-13mini, CD-14mini and CD-27mini generated single RNase H-resistant radiolabeled products of similar size, 3\u0408-TX for CD-14mini and CD-27mini must have initiated~1 and~13 nucleotides, respectively, 3\u0408 of the initiation site for CD-13mini, which was at the base of the motif1-hairpin. Quantitation of the 3\u0408-TX products by densitometric scanning of exposed films followed by normalization for the number of adenylate residues on the template portion of the respective RNA revealed that CD-14mini was 27.9 \u03ee 2.3% less active in generating hairpin-sized 3\u0408-TX products when compared with CD-13mini. Surprisingly, CD-27mini was~6-fold (603.3 \u03ee 39.5%) more active than CD-13mini (100%) in the 3\u0408-TX reactions. The elevated activity of CD-27mini was probably due to a spacer region (see Figure 1B ) located between the priming stem and motif1-hairpin and not the mutations that eliminated the mismatched bases from the priming stem, since introduction of two similar mutations to the priming stem of CD-27mini did not reduce the level of 3\u0408-TX (data not shown). This CD-27mini with a mutated priming stem generated 3\u0408-TX products that resulted in two radiolabeled RNA species following S1 nuclease treatment, which co-migrated with those obtained with CD-13mini (data not shown).",

The data were normalized based on the amount of template-directed radioactive UTP incorporated. The standard error was calculated from three separate experiments. (B) A representative experiment showing denaturing gel analysis of radiolabeled and S1-treated 3\u0408-TX products synthesized by in vitro transcription with TCV RdRp using CD-27mini, CD-27mini/mot1, GC12mini, GC12mini/mot1, AU/GCmini and AU/GCmini/mot1 (see Figure 5 ) as templates. M, single-stranded RNA markers (in bases). sequence and/or structure in vivo (Cascone et al., 1990 (Cascone et al., , 1993 ; reviewed by Simon and Nagy, 1996) . To test for involvement of the motif1-hairpin in the 3\u0408-TX with our chimeric constructs in vitro, CD-27mini/mot1, which contained only the 3\u0408-half of the motif1-hairpin and the priming stem, was constructed ( Figure 2A ). The 3\u0408-TX product for CD-27mini/mot1 was reduced by~30-fold from the level obtained using CD-27mini ( Figure 2B ). This result demonstrates that the priming stem alone cannot support efficient 3\u0408-TX and that the motif1-hairpin is required for efficient 3\u0408-TX from the priming stem in vitro. Thus, as predicted by the RdRp-mediated template-switching model of recombination, 3\u0408-TX (and possibly the analogous in vivo recombination reaction) is a more complex phenomenon than a simple primer extension reaction (see Discussion). In addition, the requirement for the entire motif1-hairpin in vitro suggests that the role of the motif1-hairpin may be similar in the in vitro 3\u0408-TX system and the in vivo sat-RNA C-sat-RNA D recombination system.",

In this assay, the template was CD-27 that contains sequences similar to CD-27mini and, in addition, a 147 nucleotide sequence representing the 5\u0408 segment of sat-RNA C (located 5\u0408 of the motif1-hairpin, as shown in Figure 4 ). The competing RNAs were derived from a variant of CD-27mini that lacked the sat-RNA D sequence, eliminating the priming stem ( Figure 4 ). The resulting Cmini series of constructs retained the wild-type motif1-hairpin (designated Cmini) or contained modifications in the motif1-hairpin. Programing the RdRp reactions with a constant amount of template (CD-27) and increasing amounts of competing RNAs (2-, 10-and 40-fold the level of template) revealed that Cmini reduced 3\u0408-TX of CD-27 by 7.3% when present in 2-fold excess, by 48.0% when in 10-fold excess, and by 83.8% when in 40-fold excess (Table II) . Construct Cmini/mot1 with a partial truncation within the motif1hairpin did not compete as efficiently as Cmini, reducing 3\u0408-TX of CD-27 by 5.5, 11.7 and 26.9% when present in 2-, 10-and 40-fold excess, respectively (Table II) . A derivative of Cmini with a single base alteration in the stem of the motif1-hairpin (designated Cmini/U183G) was also an inefficient competitor when compared with Cmini, reducing 3\u0408-TX of CD-27 by 5.3, 21.2 and 36.1% when present in 2-, 10-and 40-fold excess. This result is consistent with the debilitating effect of U183G mutation on 3\u0408-TX when present in CD-14B (see above). Addition of tRNA into the RdRp reaction in 5-, 10-and 40-fold excess, respectively, reduced 3\u0408-TX of CD-27 by not more than 7% (Table II) . Overall, these data demonstrate that Cmini RNA with the wild-type motif1-hairpin, but without the priming stem, can reduce 3\u0408-TX on template RNA with the primer stem. Mutated or truncated derivatives of the motif1-hairpin and the unrelated tRNA did not compete efficiently with the 3\u0408-TX of the template RNA. The simplest interpretation of these results is that the wildtype motif1-hairpin competes for the RdRp, thus making less RdRp available for the 3\u0408-TX reaction.",

A 12 bp GCrich stem and seven nucleotide loop (GC12mini) was 73% as efficient at 3\u0408-TX as CD-27mini. The site of initiation was at the base of the GC-rich stem, based on S1 nuclease digestion followed by size determination on denaturing gels ( Figure 5B) . A 17 bp AU-rich priming stem with one bulged nucleotide and terminating with three C residues at the 3\u0408 end and a seven nucleotide loop (AU/GCmini) was more efficient (129%) than CD-27mini in 3\u0408-TX reactions. Constructs AU5mini and AU17mini containing only AU base-paired priming stems showed reduced 3\u0408-TX activity (30.4 and 63.4%) when compared with CD-27mini ( Figure 5A ). The hairpin-like 3\u0408-TX products for AU/GCmini, AU17mini and AU5mini migrated more slowly in 5% polyacrylamide-8 M urea gels, and S1 nuclease digestion revealed resistant RNA bands 12 nucleotides shorter than that obtained with CD-27mini ( Figure 5B ). Although the exact sites of initiation were not determined for these constructs, the altered migration of the 3\u0408-TX products for AU/GCmini, AU5mini and AU17mini when compared with CD-27mini and GC12mini is consistent with the high AU-rich content of the priming stem, which may not be base paired during electrophoresis. In addition, the AU-rich priming stem may be cleaved by the single strand-specific S1 nuclease due to 'breathing' within the less stable AU-rich region. Alternatively, the AU-rich sequences within the priming stem may misalign, causing aberrant migration and sensitivity to S1 nuclease.

The available in vivo and in vitro RNA recombination systems are inefficient; thus, characterizing the recombinants requires one or more amplification steps (Lai, 1992; Nagy and Bujarski, 1992; Chetverin et al., 1997; Duggal et al., 1997; Qiao et al., 1997; Tang et al., 1997) . These post-recombination amplification steps, regardless of whether they are occurring in vivo or in vitro, have disadvantages, since they can favor amplification of some recombinants over others. For example, in most in vivo and in vitro systems (Banner and Lai, 1991; Jarvis and Kirkegaard, 1992; Nagy and Bujarski, 1992; Chetverin et al., 1997; Tang et al., 1997) , only the viable or replication-competent recombinants can be detected. In addition, the sequence of some recombinants can be modified further by mutations, deletions and rearrangements during the amplification step. Altogether, amplification can lead to misrepresentation of some recombinants in the obtained 'recombinant pool', making difficult or even excluding the possibility of drawing conclusions about the mechanism of their generation. The amplification steps can also produce artifactual recombinants and those must be discriminated carefully from 'true' recombinants. Moreover, the requirement for amplification does not allow the direct examination of recombination intermediates whose structure would be important in unraveling the mechanism of RNA recombination. The efficiency of 3\u0408-TX on the template RNAs was measured as described in the legend to Figure 2. (B) Autoradiogram of denaturing PAGE of 3\u0408-TX products.

            "text": "We have developed an in vitro TCV system that does not require amplification of RNA molecules. To avoid the need for amplification of the products, the in vitro system was optimized by favoring the interaction between putative RNA recombination intermediates by covalently linking the putative RNA intermediates with a short linker region. The sequence and structure of recombination intermediates were delineated from previous in vivo experiments that also resulted in a testable recombination model. This model predicted that RNA recombinants in the sat-RNA D-sat-RNA C system of TCV are formed by a replicasemediated strand transfer mechanism where the nascent strand, made on the negative-stranded donor sat-RNA D by the replicase, serves as a primer during re-initiation of RNA synthesis on the negative-stranded sat-RNA C. According to the model, this process leads to a chimeric 2399 (recombinant) sat-RNA D-sat-RNA C molecule if a putative RdRp-binding sequence (termed the motif1-hairpin) is present on the acceptor sat-RNA C. The threecomponent primer extension reaction predicted to occur in infected cells in vivo during RNA recombination should be similar to a simplified two-component 3\u0408-TX reaction in vitro if the correct intermediates are in proximity in the test tube. This prediction was supported by nearly all of the data presented herein. For example, the motif1-hairpin of sat-RNA C was required for sat-RNA D-sat-RNA C recombination in vivo (Cascone et al., 1990 (Cascone et al., , 1993 this work) and also greatly facilitated 3\u0408-TX in vitro. Also, the junction sites of in vivo recombinants and the initiation of 3\u0408-TX products in vitro were mapped to the same region on sat-RNA C, at or close to the base of the motif1hairpin. In addition, minus strand sequences 3\u0408 of the motif1-hairpin of sat-RNA C greatly influenced the frequency of in vivo recombination (Cascone et al., 1993;  this work) and the efficiency of 3\u0408-TX in vitro. These similarities between the in vivo and in vitro data give crucial support for the replicase-mediated template-switching model of recombination in TCV. In addition, the in vitro system allowed for defining RNA-RNA and protein-RNA interactions that probably influence template-switching events in vivo as well (see below).",

When compared with the corresponding hairpin-destabilizing mutants, mutants with compensatory mutations in the motif1-hairpin (U183G/ A206C and U185G/A202C, Table I ) restored the efficiency of 3\u0408-TX only partially, while restoring the efficiency of in vivo recombination to the wild-type level. It is possible that the mutated motif1-hairpin has a slightly different structure in vitro than in vivo. The other difference between the in vitro 3\u0408-TX and the in vivo recombination systems was that the latter can be abolished completely by mutations within the motif1-hairpin, while 3\u0408-TX can only be reduced to a low level, but cannot be abolished. This 'background' level of 3\u0408-TX may be the consequence of inefficient interaction between the RdRp and the template RNA in the two-component 3\u0408-TX system, while the possibility for interaction is reduced below the level of detection in the three-component in vivo recombination system. The amount of primer RNA (the aborted nascent sat-RNA strands) is not known in vivo, but is probably less than in the in vitro 3\u0408-TX reaction. In addition, the rate of amplification or the stability of the de novo sat-RNA C-sat-RNA D recombinants can be influenced by the motif1-hairpin mutations in the in vivo recombination system, but not in our in vitro system where there is no amplification step and the RdRp products are stable hairpin-like RNAs. Other possible explanations include loss of a component by the RdRp preparations resulting in lower specificity in vitro. Finally, in the replicasedriven, strand-switching model, it is not clear whether the nascent strand together with the RdRp simply falls off the donor template and is then available for capture by the acceptor, or if the acceptor can assist in removing (i.e. can displace) the nascent strand and the RdRp from the donor. If the latter, one might expect the in vivo situation to have more stringent requirements, because the in vitro system only tests the former.",

Mutagenesis experiments revealed that both the sequence and the secondary structure of the motif1-hairpin can influence 3\u0408-TX and in vivo recombination. Stem-destabilizing mutations in both the lower and upper stems reduced 3\u0408-TX greatly and eliminated in vivo recombination.

The proposed binding of motif1-hairpin to the RdRp, however, is not strong or stable, since a 10-fold excess of competing RNA was required to produce a 50% reduction in 3\u0408-TX. It is possible that the priming stem stabilizes RdRp binding to the motif1-hairpin. Alternatively, RNA synthesis (due to the 3\u0408-TX) keeps the RdRp on the CD-27 template RNA for a longer period than the 'non-productive' binding to the competing RNAs that have less efficient 3\u0408-TX due to the lack of a priming stem. The above experiments also demonstrated that the motif1-hairpin is not a promoter element in the strict sense, since no efficient de novo initiation was detected in the absence of the natural RdRp promoters. Accordingly, we propose that the motif1hairpin is important in recruiting the RdRp, and the complex supports efficient 3\u0408-TX only if the appropriate priming stem is available.",

The reduced level of 3\u0408-TX obtained with the above constructs was not due to changes in the primary RNA sequences, since several templates with different artificial sequences capable of priming stem formation supported efficient 3\u0408-TX ( Figure 5A ). Analogously to the requirement for the priming stem for efficient 3\u0408-TX, the requirement for RNA-RNA interaction is also supported by data obtained for RNA recombination in vivo between sat-RNA C and sat-RNA D, since extensive mutations (e.g. C7, Table I ) and deletions (Cascone et al., 1993) 3\u0408 of the motif1-hairpin on negative strands of sat-RNA C reduced the efficiency of recombination.

            "text": "The priming stem in the absence of the motif1-hairpin cannot drive efficient 3\u0408-TX with the TCV RdRp. Thus, the TCV RdRp, which is naturally promoter dependent and capable of de novo initiation Simon, 1994, 1995) , is different from most of the DNA-dependent DNA polymerases, reverse transcriptases and T7 DNAdependent RNA polymerase (Konarska and Sharp, 1989; Cazenave and Uhlenbeck, 1994) that only require base pairing of the very 3\u0408-end bases between the primer and the template for strand elongation. In contrast, the promoter-dependent RdRps may require or favor the proximity of a promoter or promoter-like element in order to use primers efficiently. For example, both BMV and TCV RdRps were capable of primer elongation from their 3\u0408-terminal negative strand initiation promoters, but they were incapable of primer elongation from primers hybridizing randomly at internal positions (Kao and Sun, 1996; . Also, the influenza virus and Thogoto virus RdRps can only initiate mRNA synthesis from their 3\u0408-terminal promoters using dinucleotide or oligonucleotide primers, but not from internal sites (Seong and Brownlee, 1992; Leahy et al., 1997) . Base pairing between the primers and the template is not absolutely required in the Thogoto virus system, but influences the efficiency and site of initiation (Leahy et al., 1997) . Another example of promoter-dependent priming at the 3\u0408 end of plus strands has been proposed for poliovirus (Harris et al., 1994) . This model predicts that a protein cleavage product, termed Vpg, is uridylylated and then used to initiate minus strand synthesis by the poliovirus RdRp complex bound to the 3\u0408-terminal promoter. In contrast to the multisubunit RdRps, the polymerase subunit of the poliovirus and the related hepatitis C virus RdRps are capable of nonsequence-specific primer extensions regardless of the presence of promoter sequences (Neufeld et al., 1991; Behrens et al., 1996) . The leader-primed RNA transcription in coronaviruses requires both short sequence complementarity between the primer and the template and the presence of a putative RdRp-binding sequence on the template RNA (Baker and Lai, 1990; Zhang and Lai, 1995) . In addition, the reverse transcriptase of the Mauriceville plasmid, which normally initiates DNA synthesis de novo at its 3\u0408-terminal promoter, is capable of primer extension from its 3\u0408-terminal promoter, even if the primer is not base paired with the template (Wang and Lambowitz, 1993) . Similarly to the above RdRps, the reverse transcriptase of the Mauriceville plasmid cannot efficiently use primers hybridizing randomly at internal positions (Chen and Lambowitz, 1997) . All these data suggest that primer-initiated strand elongation by a promoter-dependent RdRp or reverse transcriptase of the Mauriceville plasmid may be facilitated by a proximal promoter or promoterlike element. This is a novel phenomenon that may be characteristic of several promoter-dependent RdRps.",

Subgenomic RNA promoter-like elements may also have played a role in reshuffling functional 'modules' and in inter(intra-)viral recombination that facilitated viral evolution (Gibbs, 1987; Allison et al., 1989; Miller et al., 1995) . In addition, many crossover events in BMV (Nagy and Bujarski, 1992; Rao and Hall, 1993) , Sindbis virus (Hajjou et al., 1996) , tobraviruses (Goulden et al., 1991) , cucumoviruses (Fernandez-Cuartero et al., 1994) , alfalfa mosaic virus (Huisman et al., 1989) and barley stripe mosaic virus (Edwards et al., 1992) are located within 3\u0408-or 5\u0408-terminal promoter sequences. These promoter sequences, similarly to the subgenomic promoters, may have played a role in recombination events by recruiting the RdRp-nascent strand complex.",
