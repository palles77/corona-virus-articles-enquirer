For all these sera the ratios of postinoculation to preinoculation serum absorbance values at the same antigen and serum dilutions were sigTfficantly over 2, indicating that specific antibodies had developed (9, 10, 14) . Thus, both virus particles and subcomponents elicited a significant antibody response. ELISAs using heterologous combinations of subcomponents and sera produced no antigenic reactions.

Significant antibody rises, as measured by ELISA ratios, were observed in all sera from mice inoculated with denatured virus particles, although not in those from mice inoculated with subcomponent fractions. The antibody rises detected against purified subviral components were dose dependent and in all eases tested the membrane and R N P components were less immunogenic in mice than the surface projection components, even after repeated immunisation.",

The mice were then observed daily for 20 days and the numbers surviving on each day noted. Between 5 and 8 out of 10 mice immunised with denatured virus particles, and between 5 and 7 out of 10 mice immunised with surface projections survived up to 20 days after challenge with MHV 3. All non-immunised mice were killed by 7 days after virus challenge by the MHV 3 dilutions tested, with the first deaths occurring by day 5. However, non-immunised mice challenged with PBSA showed no signs of illness. Mice immunised with purified membrane and R N P fractions were not protected against MHV 3 challenge --all of them died within 6 days. Diseussion In this paper we report the isolation and purification of MHV 3 subviral components and have shown the role of each subcomponent in the protection of immnnised mice against challenge with infectious MHV 3. I t was difficult to ensure that mice immunised with different virus subcomponent preparations all produced comparable amounts of antibody, as there was considerable variation in the immunogenieity of the subeomponents. The highest antibody rises detected by ELISA were directed against surface projections, while lower antibody rises were observed against membrane and RNP, suggesting that the most immunogenic part of the virus is an antigen(s) associated with the surface projections. Similar results have been obtained previously with human eoronaviruses (14) and the porcine coronavirus transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) (5) .",

Similar properties have been observed for the surface projections of other lipid-containing, enveloped RNA viruses (3, 8, 24) . Our results with MHV 3 membrane and R N P subcomponents suggest, that although antibody was induced by these subeomponents in mice, this antibody was produced in relatively low amounts and had no deteetable protective effect against infection. Repeated immunisation of mice with membrane and R N P subeomponents did not lead to increased amounts of antibody or to any protection against MHV 3 infection. Thus, it is unlikely that these subeomponents were protective and this protection was missed due to the poor immunogenieity of these components.",
