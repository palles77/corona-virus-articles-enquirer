Outbreaks occur frequently in hospitals and healthcare centers and pose a serious risk of colonization or illness to susceptible patients and healthcare staff. It was stated in a recent report that only six (three high-income and three low-income) countries are equipped to deal with a pandemic [1] . Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae outbreaks occur in hospitals when the healthcare environment is compromised [2] . Outbreak control must be well planned, fast, and effective. The primary components of a management plan are risk assessment, case findings, patient evaluation and risk mitigation. The Rapid Isolation and Treatment of Infection strategy (RITE strategy) was recommended for the Ebola outbreak in Africa [3] . Infection control personnel expend considerable effort investigating outbreaks, leading to unexpectedly high costs for the affected hospital. Approximately 2-10% of all nosocomial infections are acquired during a nosocomial outbreak [4] . This review describes the major and minor components, and special measures for outbreak control in low-and middleincome countries.",

Unexpected environmental reservoirs are sometimes identified, suggesting that environmental screening should be considered, especially when control cannot effectively be accomplished using basic infection prevention and control (IPC) practices. The increased use of antibiotics is associated with the resistance profiles of organisms on floors and other surfaces within a defined local environment, such as a hospital ward, and previous room occupancy by a Gram-negative bacilli-colonized or Gram-negative bacteria-infected patient has been shown to be a risk for the acquisition of Gram-negative [11] . Methods to assess cleanliness are needed. Such methods can be classified within two main categories, namely a process evaluation, where the cleaning process is monitored by visual inspection or with a fluorescent gel marker, and an outcome evaluation, where it is assessed using an adenosine triphosphate (ATP) bioluminescence system or via the identification of microbial cultures. The use of ATP monitoring has been demonstrated to have a pronounced effect on the behavior of cleaners after they have received concomitant educational guidance [12] .

In addition, antibiotics have long been established as a crucial risk factor for Clostridium difficile infection. In patients colonized by C. difficile, antibiotics may promote C. difficile proliferation and the number of C. difficile spores that are shed in the local environment. Antibiotic use in C. difficile-infected patients can have a potentially negative effect on any other patient in the same environment who is not receiving them.
