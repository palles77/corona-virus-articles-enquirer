            "text": "To the Editor: Widespread outbreaks of influenza A (H5N1) in poultry and severe infections in humans have raised the possibility of an influenza pandemic. The 3 influenza A pandemics of the 20th century (1) were associated with considerable socioeconomic disruption as well as many deaths and pressure on health services. Experiences in the United States during the 1918-1920 pandemic (2) suggest that government advice that conflicts with personal or societal beliefs may not be followed, thus jeopardizing public health measures. Experience from the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome has highlighted some pitfalls in achieving public understanding (3) and compliance (4) in the era of mass communication. Even if initial compliance is achieved, previous behavior patterns may reemerge during a pandemic as people begin to perceive that they have little control over the threat (5) or reduce their estimation of the risk (6) .",

            "text": "As far as we know, this is the first population-based study of knowledge and understanding of pandemic influenza. Public understanding of this threat and its potential effect in the United Kingdom appears to be limited. Our findings that older adults are more aware than younger persons has also been found in other settings (8) as has the increased public health awareness in more educated groups (9,10). Economic considerations retain high importance even with a potentially fatal threat, a phenomenon that has been previously noted with regard to self-quarantine (4). Our study did not address whether reluctance to take time off from work was more likely to be associated with public or private sector employment or self-employment. Further study in this area would help preparedness strategy. This study was limited by a relatively small sample size, and its setting in 1 region of London may have implications regarding the extent to which the findings are applicable elsewhere. Further, larger assessments are needed both before and after specific pandemic influenza awareness programs as part of the ongoing process of pandemic preparedness. To the Editor: Influenza viruses cause serious respiratory illness, particularly in infants <24 months of age (1) . Despite serologic studies of French adults that showed an influenza virus seroprevalence of 60%-70%, influenza C infections have rarely been described (2) . Given the technical difficulties involved in isolating influenza C virus in cell cultures, diagnosis is made only in certain laboratories. Detection of viral genome by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR in nasopharyngeal aspirates allows etiologic diagnosis of these infections (3). Mild upper respiratory infections in adults and adolescents are attributed to this virus (4, 5) . Some cases of lower respiratory infections have also been described in children (6) .",
