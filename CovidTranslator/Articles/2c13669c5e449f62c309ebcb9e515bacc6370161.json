Even though some level of automation has been achieved in the recent years, ELISAs remain laborious, time-consuming and expensive, when multiple targets need to be screened for, so there is a growing need for new multi-analyte screening methods, which will enable rapid, simultaneous detection of contaminants in numerous samples.",

It is composed of three parts: an array of immobilized molecular recognition elements (usually antibodies), an image capturing and processing system, and a fluidics handling unit. Array sensor optics comprise a patterned glass slide, which is placed on a support and is illuminated by launching 635 nm light from a diode laser into one end, a GRIN lens array, which focus the fluorescent patterns, an emission filter, which rejects unwanted laser light and a Peltier-cooled CCD camera which images the array.",

This approach in combination with fluorescent dyes, which are excited at longer wavelengths (e.g., Cy5 and Alexa-Fluor 647), significantly reduces interference from the bulk fluid, offering better reproducibility and sensitivity when used for analysis in complex sample matrixes. Optical properties of such fluorophores also allow a small, lightweight source of excitation (e.g., diode laser) and a compact optical detection system (e.g., CCD camera). Multi-analyte detection is achieved through the ''bar-code'' approach. Biotinylated capture antibodies are immobilized on the avidin-coated waveguide surface in columns, using a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) block with several channels. The PDMS block is then oriented perpendicularly and several different samples are passed through the channels. The array biosensor is portable and automated, and thus is very well suited to in-field measurements. Also, its detection principles allow analysis of crude matrixes with minimal sample preparation. Commercial versions of the array biosensor have recently become available [6] . The array biosensor has been used for the detection of small molecules, toxins, proteins, bacteria and viruses in numerous applications in food safety, diagnostics, homeland security and environmental monitoring.",

Conventional microscope glass slides, modified with (3-glycidyl-oxypropyl)trimethoxysilane, were used as a solid-phase support for the microarray.

Formation of the immunocomplex is detected by light emission in the presence of a luminol-based POD substrate. The direct immunoassay format was also demonstrated in this system. The microarrays are for multiple uses, and are regenerated between sequential measurement cycles.

SPR biosensors do not require the use of reporter elements to generate a signal, which is convenient during assay development and during application by saving labeling steps and washing steps. SPR biosensors are based on optical phenomenon which occurs when the evanescent wave, generated by light, interacts with free electrons in a thin metal film. The intensity of the reflected light at a specific angle is thus reduced. The light angle at which this reduction occurs is called the SPR angle, and it varies with the refractive index of the dielectric medium (usually buffer) close to the metal film (usually gold). When molecules are immobilized on and/or bound to the gold surface, the SPR angle changes, allowing label-free and real-time monitoring [11] .",

[17] recently reported the development of cross-linked PDA liposome-based chips for multiplex pathogen detection. PDA supramolecules undergo a color change from blue to red under various stimuli (e.g., temperature, pH and mechanical stress), including binding events that take place on the surface. The red state of the PDA also produces fluorescence. For chip production, the PDA liposomes are arrayed using ethylenediamine as an interlinker on amine-covered glass slides by an array spotter and conjugated with different antibodies. Binding to target bacteria can be monitored by the naked eye, due to chromatic transition, or by measuring the fluorescent output ( Fig. 2A) . Further research is needed to evaluate the analytical performance of this technology and its applicability to analysis of real samples. Electrical microarrays employ an electrical signal readout from an array of microelectrodes. For example, Elsholz et al. [18] described an electrical oligonucleotide microarray for identification and detection of multiple pathogens via RNA hybridization. The signal was generated by alkaline-phosphatase-mediated conversion of p-aminophenol to its electrically-active phosphate derivative and enhanced by redox cycling. This system was reported to be fast and easy to use, and did not require PCR amplification, but it has not yet been applied to analysis of food or environmental samples. Additional examples of analytical microarray systems, which have not yet been applied to food and environmental monitoring, can be found in the review by Seidel et al. [9] .",

In general, they are sensitive and easy to use, have high specificity, require minimal sample preparations, and are therefore suitable for the screening of a large number of samples in a short time (about 2-3 h). These tests can be used within food-producing facilities. The use of generic structures for the development of group-specific antibodies enables detection of groups of compounds, widening the screening range [52, 53] . Penicillin-binding protein was also used for the detection of the antibiotics from the beta-lactam group in different food matrices [54] . It was immobilized to a microplate and the amount of a bifunctional reagent (with ampicillin and digoxigenin as functional groups), measured with anti-digoxigenin conjugated with horseradish peroxidase, was used to quantify the amount of beta-lactams present in the sample extracts. A multi-analyte screening ELISA for sulfonamides, fluoroquinolones and beta-lactam antibiotics in milk, using three class-selective bioreceptors in a planar microarray configuration, was also recently described [5] .",
