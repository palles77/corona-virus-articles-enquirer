            "text": "a 1 -Acid glycoprotein (AGP) is an acute-phase protein (APP) that modulates immune responses, probably -at least in humans -owing to the modification of its glycosylation pattern. On this perspective, feline AGP can be a useful comparative model, as it has different concentrations in cats susceptible or resistant to some disease. As a preliminary approach to the study of feline AGP (fAGP) we have purified this protein from feline serum by HPLC using human AGP (hAGP) as a model. Immunoblotting with a polyclonal antibody against fAGP and with a monoclonal antibody against hAGP was performed on serum from healthy cats, from cats exposed to feline coronavirus (FCoV) infection and from cats with purulent inflammations, such as feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) and feline leukemia virus (FeLV). Immunohistochemistry on tissues from healthy cats and from cats with different diseases (FIP, FIV, FeLV, locally extensive inflammation) was also performed with the same antibodies. Both hAGP and fAGP have been purified to homogenity as determined by SDS-PAGE. fAGP did not react with the anti-hAGP antibody which, in contrast, detected in feline serum a low MW protein that we called fAGP-related protein (fAGPrP). This protein was underexpressed in cats with FeLV and FIP. Both fAGP and fAGPrP were immunohistochemically detected in plasma and hepatocytes with a stronger intensity in cats with FIP and some inflammatory conditions. Moreover, fAGPrP was detected in the cytoplasm of tissue cells, most likely identifiable with plasma cells. These cells were rarely detectable in cats with FIV and FeLV, and numerous in cats with FIP and with locally extensive inflammation. In conclusion, purified fAGP has physicochemical characteristics similar to those of hAGP, but does not cross-react with anti-hAGP antibodies. In contrast, the anti-hAGP detected an AGP-related protein whose blood concentration and tissue distribution was not related to that of fAGP. Moreover, both fAGP and fAGPrP were differently expressed in cats with pathologic conditions compared to controls. Further study of these proteins by analysing their structural characteristics is required.",

AGP belongs to the lipocalin family, a group of extracellular binding proteins specific for small hydrophobic molecules. Together with a 1 -microglobulin and glycodelin, it forms the immunocalin subfamily (Logdberg and Wester 2000) . Human AGP (hAGP) contains 183 aminoacids and is characterised by low molecular weight (41-43 kDa), high solubility, very low pH (2.8-3.8) and a high percentage of carbohydrates (45%). Its glycosylation pattern is very variable (12-20 glycoforms in humans), depending on the physiological or pathological conditions, such as pregnancy, inflammation or cancer (Biou et al. 1991; Kim and Varky 1997) .",

            "text": "In cats, AGP is one of the most examined APPs. It has been studied in different viral and neoplastic diseases (Duthie et al. 1997; Selting et al. 2000) . In particular, the serum levels of AGP during feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) are very high (Duthie et al 97) , but this increase is only transient in FCoV-exposed cats (Giordano et al. 2003) . This could be due to the protective role of some AGP glycoforms similar to humans. Although diagnostic kits to quantitate feline AGP (fAGP) are commercially available, there is currently no information about fAGP sequence, structure and tissue distribution, or commercial anti-fAGP antibodies. We thus decided to design a research project focused on the structural characteristics of fAGP. In this paper we describe the results of the first step of this project, during which fAGP was purified from feline blood using hAGP purification protocol as a model. fAGP distribution in blood and tissues of healthy cats and of cats with different diseases was then assessed using a polyclonal anti-fAGP antibody. During the fAGP purification a second, different protein was identified. This was named fAGPrelated protein (fAGPrP), only because it cross-reacts with a monoclonal antibody directed against hAGP. To date, it is not known what this small protein (about 29 kDa) is. Before studying the fAGPrP further, however, it was decided to evaluate its possible pathophysiological role by assessing its blood and tissue distribution and its relationship with fAGP.",

From this perspective it is not possible to know whether this protein is structurally related to AGP. Moreover, the protein disappears when AGP is purified to homogeneity, both in human and cat. On the other hand, we may not rule out the possibility that the antibody cross-reacts with a partially deglycosylated form of fAGP, which has no equivalent in human serum. Because the low isoelectric point of AGP is due largely to the glycan moiety of the protein, it is possible that a partial deglycosylated isoform of 29 kDa is not copurified with the completely glycosylated AGP.",

The latter finding was in agreement with previous results obtained on the same cats using a commercially available radial immunodiffusion kit (Giordano et al. 2003) .

We ruled out experimentally that feline albumin cross-reacts with polyclonal anti-fAGP: it is probable that an aliquot of fAGP conjugates with albumin during SDS-PAGE of sera, and therefore the crossreaction at 66 kDa might be considered as an electrophoretical artefact.
