The various formats of nucleic acid amplification are the most frequently used molecular tests in the diagnosis of infectious diseases. In many clinical settings, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is clearly the method of choice due to its exquisite sensitivity and specificity. Today, many conventional PCR methods are being replaced by real-time PCR, which allows more rapid detection and quantification of the PCR product, as well as detection of different strains of the pathogen by melting curve analysis. The ability to measure the quantity of microbe by quantitative PCR has become increasingly important, providing information on the progression and prognosis of disease, and effectiveness of treatment. Other widely used molecular diagnostic techniques are isothermal amplification methods and nucleic acid hybridization techniques. Microarray is a technique which holds promise and has an exceptional sensitivity and the capacity to detect several pathogens simultaneously. However, microarrays are currently too expensive to be adapted for routine diagnostics, and their diagnostic use requires broad-based nucleic acid amplification prior to analysis which is not well established. Several molecular methods can be used for genotyping, which allows the identification of different subtypes of the pathogen; genotyping plays a role in the risk assessment and management of infections. Clinicians need to recognize the enhanced accuracy and speed of the molecular diagnostic techniques for the diagnosis of infections, but also to understand their limitations. Laboratory results should always be interpreted in the context of the clinical presentation of the patient, and appropriate site, quality, and timing of specimen collection are required for reliable test results.",

Two broad approaches to diagnosis are used. The gold standard is the direct detection of the pathogen itself in clinical samples collected from the cases. A range of methods such as culture, electron microscopy, and pathogen genome detection by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) are used. Key performance issues are summarized in Table 1 . Infection is often diagnosed indirectly by the detection of the patient's immune response to infection. The detection of pathogen specific IgM is a commonly used method for confirming acute infection. Today, clinical microbiology diagnostics increasingly rely on molecular techniques. This brief review will focus on the key features influencing the clinical use of molecular tests. The most widely used techniques are described.

In certain clinical situations, such as diagnosis of viral encephalitis or monitoring of cytomegalovirus (CMV) and EpsteineBarr virus (EBV) in organ transplant patients, PCR has transformed laboratory investigations because of its exquisite sensitivity and specificity, and is clearly the method of choice. PCR allows the amplification of millions of identical DNA copies from an originally small amount of pathogen genome in a clinical sample. In principal, the target DNA is first extracted then denatured at high temperature. Specific oligonucleotide primers are annealed to the DNA in a lower temperature, followed by an extension phase during which the DNA polymerase enzyme copies the template strand. This cycle is repeated, usually 30e40 times, resulting in millions of identical DNA copies. For the principles of PCR see Figure 1 .",

Clinical examples of multiplex PCR are screening of positive blood cultures for bacterial pathogens causing sepsis, 1 and screening of respiratory viruses from nasopharyngeal swabs. 2 Ligase chain reaction (LCR): LCR is a modification of PCR. In this method, two adjacent probes hybridize to one strand of the target DNA. The small gap between the two adjacent primers is recognized by a highly specific thermostable DNA ligase, and ligated to form a single probe. The ligated products then serve as templates for the amplification process. LCR allows the detection of only single base pair mutations, and it is very specific. The most common application of LCR is in the diagnostics of Chlamydia trachomatis in cervical and urine samples. 3 ",

            "text": "Nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (NASBA): In NASBA analysis (Figure 2 ), which is performed in isothermal conditions, the target RNA is converted to double-stranded DNA by using T7 RNA polymerase, RNaseH, and a primer with a T7 promoter. The DNA acts as a template to produce multiple copies of RNA with a polarity opposite that of the target, which can be used for the production of additional DNA templates. NASBA is also suitable for DNA, with slight modifications in the early steps of the process. A recent example of NASBA technology in clinical diagnostics is a real-time multiplex NASBA assay for the detection of Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, and Legionella spp. in respiratory specimens. 4 Transcription-mediated amplification (TMA): The principle of TMA is similar to NASBA, except that it uses the RNaseH activity of reverse transcriptase, whereas NASBA uses a separate enzyme for that. Due to the introduction of West Nile virus (WNV) in to the US since 1999, screening of primary WNV infection in blood donors was initiated. Currently, TMA is referred to as the most sensitive nucleic acid test commercially available for WNV infection, 5 and is used on a large scale for blood donor screening in the US. Another clinical example of a large-scale and worldwide use of TMA technology is in the detection of Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae in urine and urogenital swab specimens. 6 Strand displacement amplification (SDA): SDA is another isothermal amplification method. The first set of primers containing a restriction site is annealed to DNA template. Second primers are then annealed adjacent to the first ones and start amplification, after which restriction enzyme HincII is introduced in order to nick the synthesized DNA. An exonucleasedeficient form of the Klenow fragment of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I starts the amplification again, displacing the newly synthesized strands. Similar to other isothermal amplification techniques, the amplification process of SDA is very efficient. SDA is used, for example, in the diagnosis of N. gonorrhoeae infection from female endocervical swabs and male first-void urine samples.",

Microarrays can detect both nucleic acids and antibodies, which attach to the immobilized biomolecule, which can be, e.g., an oligonucleotide or a protein. Positive reaction can be detected with highly advanced scanners by use of target labelling with fluorescent probes or antibodies. A schematic illustration on one of the microarray modifications (by Baek et al., 2008 12 ) is shown in Figure 3 . The variety of microarray modifications is vast, varying from immobilization of DNA probes in three-dimensional gel drops to electrochemical detection of hybridization without preceding PCR amplification. It is foreseen that both DNA and serological microarrays will play an important role in the future technologies applied in clinical microbiology laboratories. Several applications have already been proposed and introduced, including detection of rifampicin-and isoniazid-resistant M. tuberculosis, 13 detection of chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium falciparum, 14 and herpesvirus detection from CSF. 15 Genotyping Genotyping refers to the identification of variations of different strains or subtypes of the pathogen at nucleic acid level. Genotyping of PCR amplicons can be performed by direct sequencing, by reverse hybridization to genotype-specific probes, by restriction fragment length polymorphism, or by detection of single nucleotide polymorphisms with mass spectrometry. Direct sequencing is usually considered as the gold standard as it provides accurate and extensive data. Genotyping plays an important role in the management of HCV infection, as response to treatment considerably varies between different genotypes; patients with HCV genotype 2 or 3 infection respond better to treatment than those with genotype 1 infection. Both direct sequencing and probe hybridization approaches are widely used for HCV genotyping. 16 An example of genotyping currently moving into routine practice is human papilloma virus (HPV) typing. Eight oncogenic HPV types (16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 45 , 52, and 58) are responsible for 80% of cervical cancers and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia worldwide; distinct patterns are seen in different regions. Genotyping for the oncogenic HPV types enables risk assessment, personalized clinical management and early intervention in women with mildly abnormal Pap results. Genotyping is also widely used for molecular epidemiology and in identifying antimicrobial resistance and high-risk strains.",

In this technique, the sample is first ionized, the ions are separated according to their mass-to-charge ratios, and finally the separated ions are detected according to the ion current. Ionization of the sample can be done in various ways, of which matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) is widely used in the genotyping of single nucleotide polymorphisms. MALDI mass spectrometry is an important tool in typing of bacteria and viruses, which is useful, e.g. in detecting hypervirulent or antimicrobial drug resistant strains. The technique has been introduced, e.g. for genotyping of HCV and monitoring of quasispecies (a cloud of variant RNA viruses that arise from mutations over time within a viral isolate) in chronic HCV infection. 17 It is also used in the detection of hypervirulent N. meningitidis strains 18 ; only five of the 13 serogroups are frequently associated with invasive disease. 19 Recently, a method based on broad-range RT-PCR followed by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry has been applied for monitoring of global spread of novel influenza virus genotypes. 20 ",

Molecular diagnostic techniques are no exception to this rule. Indeed the exquisite sensitivity of PCR adds new issues of clinical interpretation of laboratory results. Many infectious agents cause clinical and asymptomatic infection; for example, norovirus, a cause of gastroenteritis, has a high rate of asymptomatic infections. Systematic application of the PCR to both respiratory and enteric illness has revealed that mixed infections are common (5e10%), which means attributing causality to a single agent is difficult.",

The sensitivity of the assay refers to its ability to correctly identify affected individuals, whereas specificity refers to its ability to correctly identify non-affected individuals. False-positive and/or false-negative results in molecular diagnostic techniques can occur either due to suboptimal assay performance, sample contamination, wrong specimen material, or wrong timing of the sample collection. In addition, a positive result may be without clinical significance, sometimes due to the low detection threshold of these techniques. The positive and negative predictive values of the assay refer to the performance of the test at a population level, i.e. the probability that an individual testing positive is truly affected and that an individual testing negative is truly non-affected. The predictive values of the test are not only dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay, but also on the prevalence of the disease in the population. For example, the performance of any given HIV antibody test is different when used in high-risk groups as compared to general population; the positive predictive value will fall as the prevalence of the disease falls.",

For PCR the main issue is avoiding contamination from the products of PCR which have a high concentration after amplification. This was a major issue when PCR was first introduced, and has led to laboratory work areas for different steps of PCR being physically separated to avoid contamination. In optimal conditions, the same personnel will never work with both amplified products and clean reagents. Aseptic and meticulous working techniques are required to avoid specimen-to-specimen contamination. The introduction of realtime PCR has reduced the potential for contamination by reducing handling. Regular quality control of the assays is vital, including negative and internal positive controls, as well as continual trend analyses, which must be reflected in the epidemiology of the pathogen in question.",

This blocks light irradiated from above, which can be measured, allowing detection and quantitative analysis of the target DNA. and timing of sample collection are of high importance. A fine example of this is PCR testing of C. trachomatis in urine. Too early post-treatment testing may result in clinically false-positive results due to detectable traces of nucleic acid by PCR without presence of infectious pathogen, since shedding can be detected for much longer by PCR than culture. Wrong timing may also lead to false-negative results, such as PCR testing of respiratory and stool samples collected late in the disease process, when the viral nucleic acid has already cleared. In this case, serological investigation may help in the diagnosis.",
