            "text": "Nitric oxide is an important molecule playing a key role in a broad range of biological process such as neurotransmission, vasodilatation and immune responses. While the anti-microbiological properties of nitric oxide-derived reactive nitrogen intermediates (RNI) such as peroxynitrite, are known, the mechanism of these effects are as yet poorly studied. Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) belongs to the family Coronaviridae, was first identified during 2002-2003. Mortality in SARS patients ranges from between 6 to 55%. We have previously shown that nitric oxide inhibits the replication cycle of SARS-CoV in vitro by an unknown mechanism. In this study, we have further investigated the mechanism of the inhibition process of nitric oxide against SARS-CoV. We found that peroxynitrite, an intermediate product of nitric oxide in solution formed by the reaction of NO with superoxide, has no effect on the replication cycle of SARS-CoV, suggesting that the inhibition is either directly effected by NO or a derivative other than peroxynitrite. Most interestingly, we found that NO inhibits the replication of SARS-CoV by two distinct mechanisms. Firstly, NO or its derivatives cause a reduction in the palmitoylation of nascently expressed spike (S) protein which affects the fusion between the S protein and its cognate receptor, angiotensin converting enzyme 2. Secondly, NO or its derivatives cause a reduction in viral RNA production in the early steps of viral replication, and this could possibly be due to an effect on one or both of the cysteine proteases encoded in Orf1a of SARS-CoV.",

SARS-CoV is a positive-sense RNA virus with a genome of \u223c30 kb in length that forms a distinct group within the Coronaviridae family. Common to all known coronaviruses are the four structural proteins: spike (S), membrane (M), envelope (E) and nucleocapsid (N) protein (Marra et al., 2003; Rota et al., 2003) . The S protein protrudes from the envelope of the virus, which results in its characteristic crown-like appearance. The S protein binds to specific receptors on the cell surface; in the case of SARS-CoV, it is the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The S protein has two regions, S1 and S2, where S1 is involved in receptor binding and S2 in membrane fusion (Li et al., 2005 .",

(2007) recently showed the importance of S-palmitoylation of the endodomain of the spike protein for the mediation of cell fusion. Palmitoylation involves the addition of palmitate, which is a 16-carbon saturated fatty acid, and a wide range of proteins have been shown to carry this specific modification (Resh, 2006) . The addition of palmitate can influence the interaction between protein and membrane, protein trafficking, and protein-protein interactions (Resh, 2006; Smotrys and Linder, 2004; Thorp et al., 2006) . In Spalmitoylation, the fatty acids are linked through thioester linkages to thiol groups on cysteine residues (Greaves and Chamberlain, 2007; Resh, 2006; Smotrys and Linder, 2004) .",

We clearly showed that the progeny viruses were inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner, using the exogenous NO donor S-nitroso-N-acetyl-penicillamine (SNAP) . We also demonstrated that endogenously generated NO can inhibit the replication cycle of SARS-CoV. Another host defence against microbes is superoxide (O 2 \u2212 ) which can be induced when cells are stressed, for example during an infection (Akaike and Maeda, 2000) . If NO and O 2 \u2212 are elevated at the same time, they will react rapidly to form peroxynitrite (ONOO \u2212 ), which has also been shown to have an inhibitory effect on viruses (Akaike, 2001) . Hantaviruses are one group of viruses known to be adversely affected by peroxynitrite (Klingstrom et al., 2006) . Hence, it is unclear if the effect of NO on SARS-CoV replication is caused by peroxynitrite or another derivative of nitric oxide. In this study we show that peroxynitrite does not play a significant role in the NO-mediated inhibition of the SARS-CoV replication cycle. Most interestingly, our data suggest that the effect of NO or its derivatives on the replication cycle of SARS-CoV is twofold: Firstly, NO or its derivatives causes a reduction in the palmitoylation of the S protein which results in the inhibition of membrane fusion mediated by the interaction between S protein and the ACE2 receptor. Secondly, NO or its derivatives have an inhibitory effect on the production of viral RNA, which can be observed as early as 3 h post-infection.",

The results in Fig. 1B clearly demonstrate that with increasing amount of MnTBAP in presence of SIN-1 (400 \u03bcM), there is an inhibition in the production of progeny virus in a concentration-dependent manner. Although a slight reduction on the production of progeny virus was observed when the cells were treated with the highest concentration of MnTBAP used in this study (800 \u03bcM, Fig. 1C ), the reduction of virus replication in cells treated with both SIN-1 and MnTBAP is significantly higher than those treated with MnTBAP alone. This slight reduction might be explained by the possibility that the use of the superoxide scavenger would have resulted in an increase in intracellular free NO, which could then, directly or through an intermediary compound, exert an inhibitory effect.",

            "text": "In order to determine if the effect of nitric oxide on SARS-CoV was limited to the post-translational modification of the S protein, we examined the production of viral RNA by realtime PCR analysis. RNA isolated from SARS-CoV infected Vero E6 cells at different time points post-infection in the presence of SNAP, NAP or mock treatment was reverse transcribed and quantitated using primers specific for the N gene of SARS-CoV. An identical amount of each RNA sample was also reverse transcribed and quantitated using primers specific for GAPDH, which served as a housekeeping control. The results showed that SNAP treatment of Vero E6 cells resulted in a reduction in the amount of total positive-stranded viral RNA produced. This effect was observed as early as 3 h post-infection and viral RNA levels remained low at 24 h post-infection (Fig. 5) . In order to determine if this observed effect could be exaggerated by pretreating Vero E6 cells with nitric oxide, another experiment was run in parallel which included an additional SNAP treatment step an hour before infection. The effect observed was approximately the same as in cells treated post-infection, suggesting that the pretreatment of Vero E6 cells with nitric oxide did not significantly increase the effects of nitric oxide on the production of viral RNA (Fig. 5) . The possibility that the pretreatment had an effect on SARS-CoV particles before infection was excluded by titrating SARS-CoV that had been incubated in SNAP-containing media, which showed that the TCID50 of the virus was unchanged (data not shown). It has been previously shown by others that nitric oxide or its derivatives can exert an effect on the activity of cysteine proteases (Cao et al., 2003; Saura et al., 1999) . As SARS-CoV encodes two different cysteine proteases, PL pro and 3C pro , we tried to determine if the effect seen on production of positive/stranded viral RNA might involve a loss or reduction of the function of one or both of these proteases, which serve to cleave the different replicase proteins from the pp1ab polyprotein expressed from Orfs 1a and 1b of the viral genome (Thiel et al., 2003) . One simple way to study this effect would be to look at the cleavage of replicase proteins by Western blotting. A previously described monoclonal antibody (Kumar et al., 2007) targeting the nsp8 protein was used against SDS-PAGE-separated lysates from SARS-CoV infected Vero E6 cells which had been treated with either SNAP, NAP or untreated. Surprisingly, there was no significant difference in nsp8 levels at 24 h post-infection (Fig. 6) . Interestingly though, two other peptide species, detected by the nsp8 antibody in infected cells, showed differences in their respective expression levels in SNAP-treated lysates. These high molecular weight species could possibly represent cleavage intermediates of the ORF1a replicase polyprotein from which nsp8 is cleaved. In order to ascertain that NO was acting in these cells, the same lysates were probed for the SARS N protein using a monoclonal antibody against N (Zymed Laboratories). It was observed that N expression was significantly reduced in the same lysates. This was consistent with earlier work (Akerstrom et al., 2005) and showed that the SNAP treatment was working within the Vero E6 cells.",

However, there are only a few reports demonstrating the inhibition mechanism of NO. NO has been shown to affect Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) by downregulation of the Zta protein, an immediate early transactivator. The downregulation of Zta helps to maintain latency of the virus. In the same study, it was also shown that apoptosis in B cell lines were L-arginine dependent and that NO can inhibit apoptosis in B cells (Mannick et al., 1994) . In a previous study we have shown that NO inhibits the replication cycle of SARS-CoV. are produced simultaneously and peroxynitrite is rapidly formed. Our results show that unlike SNAP, treatment of SARS-CoV infected Vero E6 cells with SIN-1 has no significant effect on the production of progeny virus (Fig. 1A) , suggesting that peroxynitrite does not inhibit SARS-CoV replication. Moreover, if a superoxide scavenger (MnTBAP) is used to remove the O 2 \u2212 and allow more NO to accumulate inside the SIN-1treated cells, a significant inhibition of the virus replication was observed (Fig. 1B) . These results clearly demonstrate that peroxynitrite has no effect on the replication of SARS-CoV and that it is NO, or a derivative of NO, that inhibits the virus. Palmitoylation is an important post-translational modification of proteins. Petit et al. (2007) have demonstrated that palmitoylation of the SARS-CoV S protein plays a role in S-mediated cell-cell fusion. By substituting select cysteine clusters at the carboxyl terminus of the S protein for alanines, it was shown that palmitoylation of at least two cysteine clusters at the C-terminus was important in membrane fusion that occurred after binding of the S protein to its cognate ACE2 receptor, critical to the infectivity of SARS-CoV. It has also been previously shown that NO or its derivatives have an effect on the palmitoylation of the rat myelin protein (Bizzozero et al., 2001) . In agreement with both of these findings, our results in this work indicate that NO or its derivatives reduce the palmitoylation of the S protein and consequently exerts an effect downstream of the S protein binding to ACE2, which is shown by the cell-cell fusion assay. While cell-cell fusion remains an unobserved phenomenon in SARS-CoV infection, in this paper the cell-cell fusion assay has proved useful in examining the interaction of the S protein and its cognate ACE2 receptor. However, the cell-cell fusion assay does not address the question of whether the underpalmitoylation of the S protein affects its expression, folding or incorporation into the mature virus particle. To this end we have created a pseudotyped virus based on HIV which incorporates the S protein and shown that SNAP treatment of cells does not affect the expression or incorporation of the S protein and it is only the infectivity of the pseudovirus, as shown by the luciferase assay, that is affected. It is known that treatment of mammalian cells with NO donors results in at least two different types of posttranslational modifications-nitration of tyrosine residues (Ischiropoulos et al., 1992) and S-nitrosylation of cysteine residues (Stamler et al., 1992) . We demonstrate that nitric oxide or a derivative compound is interacting with the S protein by means of the tyrosine nitration assay. However, as tyrosine nitration depends on the presence of peroxynitrite (Ischiropoulos et al., 1992) , which has been excluded from having an effect on the replication cycle of SARS-CoV in this work, this indicates that either (a) the tyrosine residues which have been nitrated have little or no role to play in the binding between the S protein and ACE2, or (b) that the nitration of these tyrosine residues do not impair their role in the S-protein. The true effect of NO on the binding process might then manifest itself at the cysteine residues on the S protein which may have been palmitoylated, in particular the clusters at the carboxy terminal that have been demonstrated to play a role in cell-cell fusion. But what needs to be determined is whether these residues have simply been underpalmitoylated as a result of an effect on palmitoyl-acyl transferases in the host cell or whether, given that these are cysteine residues, competitively nitrosylated. S-nitrosylation motifs have been previously described as an acid-base motif flanking cysteine residues (Ascenzi et al., 2000 , Stamler et al., 1997 , and a search of the S-protein amino acid sequence for previously described motifs yielded no results. Further studies will have to be done to answer these questions.",

            "text": "While the palmitoylation of the S protein has been shown to be affected by the administration of SNAP as an NO donor, this is an effect that is seen in the later steps of infection, after the expression of viral proteins. However, nitric oxide and its derivatives have been shown in the case of several micro-organisms to have an effect on the early steps of replication, in both bacterial and viral infections. The work done by several groups has demonstrated that cysteine proteases are particularly susceptible to nitric oxide, as has been described for coxsackieviruses (Saura et al., 1999) and adenoviruses (Cao et al., 2003) . The use of realtime PCR directed against positive-stranded RNA species encoded by SARS-CoV showed that SNAP treatment of Vero E6 cells caused a significant decrease in viral RNA production which could be observed as early as 3 h post-infection compared to NAPtreated and mock-treated controls. This observation is interesting as SARS-CoV encodes 2 cysteine proteases, the papain-like protease (PL2 pro ) and the 3C-like protease(3CL pro ) (Thiel et al., 2003) . These cleave the pp1ab replicase polyprotein at non-overlapping sites to yield 15 replicase proteins, termed nsp1 to nsp15. PL2 pro is predicted to cleave the polyprotein at 3 sites, and the rest of the non-structural proteins have been predicted to be cleaved by 3CL pro . Hence, in order to examine a possible effect of NO on the activity of these proteases, a monoclonal antibody directed against the nsp8 protein was used to look at the relative amounts of cleavage products being formed in SARS-CoV infected Vero E6 cells treated with either SNAP, NAP or in mock-treated cells. If NO or its derivatives exerted a discrete effect on the activity of 3CL pro , one might expect to see a reduction in the amount of nsp8 protein as determined by Western blotting. Surprisingly, no difference was seen in the levels of cleaved nsp8 amongst the different treatments. However, 2 bands of higher molecular weight (of around 60 kDa and 130 kDa) was seen to exhibit altered intensities in SARS-CoV infected cells treated with SNAP. As these bands are specific to infection and are detected by the nsp8 antibody, they might represent cleavage intermediates of the replicase polyprotein. In a 2004 study, Fan and coworkers expressed and purified the SARS-CoV 3CL pro in order to study its activity. Using an HPLC-based peptide cleavage assay, they found that the 11 unique 3CL pro cleavage sites on the pp1ab replicase polyprotein were cleaved with different efficiencies (Fan et al., 2005) . In light of this information, the differences seen in the amounts of cleavage products might make more sense to the observer. It could be possible that the effect of NO or its derivatives on 3CL pro might have altered its substrate specificities, resulting in a different pattern of cleavage efficiencies from that previously observed. This might account, then, for the lack of a difference in nsp8 levels while an accumulation is observed for a different intermediate cleavage product which might have had its cleavage efficiency altered more detrimentally. In order to confirm that NO was actually working in these samples, we performed a Western blot using a monoclonal antibody specific to the N protein of SARS-CoV (Fig. 6) . It was observed that the expression of the N protein was reduced, in agreement with previous findings (Akerstrom et al., 2005) . This showed the intended effect of SNAP treatment and therefore that the observed differences in cleavage product intensities was being observed in cells which were being affected by SNAP treatment. Fig. 6 . SNAP treatment causes a difference in observed levels of replicase polyprotein cleavage products. Lysates from either uninfected or SARS-CoV infected Vero E6 cells which had either been treated with SNAP, NAP or mock-treated harvested 24 h postinfection were subjected to Western blot analysis using a monoclonal antibody targeting the nsp8 protein.",

For the negative control, the cells were transfected with pNL4-3.Luc.R-E-alone. The construction of the plasmids has been described previously (Connor et al., 1995; He et al., 1995; Tan et al., 2004) . The virus-containing medium was harvested after 72 h of incubation and centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 5 min to remove any cell debris. Virus in the supernatant was subsequently concentrated through a 20% sucrose cushion for 3 h at 30,000 rpm and 4\u00b0C by using an SW41 rotor, and subsequently resuspended in DMEM. In order to normalize the amount of pseudotyped virus used, 10 \u03bcl of each sample was used to measure p24 content using a p24 ELISA kit (Perkin Elmer), according to the manufacturer's protocol. Absorbance readings were made at 492 nm in a plate reader (Tecan) and sample concentrations were determined from a standard graph. Appropriate volumes corresponding to 16 ng of pseudotyped virus were then used to infect CHO-ACE2 cells . At 72 hpi, supernatant was removed and the cells were washed and harvested in trypsin and washed again in PBS. Cell pellet was lysed using the Promega lysis buffer and luciferase activity was determined using a luciferase assay kit, following manufacturer's instructions (Promega). Luciferase readings were measured using a Veritus microplate luminometer (Turner Biosystems).",
