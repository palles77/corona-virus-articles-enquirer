In addition, the recombinant receptor-binding domain (RBD) was used to raise polyclonal antibodies in mice. All of the antibodies raised by S-peptide immunisation were specific and sensitive for S protein expressed in transfected cells in the indirect immunofluorescence assay or Western blotting. The RBD efficiently elicited neutralizing antibodies against MERS-CoV by blocking viral entry at the binding step. Furthermore, we found that the SP3 peptide, corresponding to amino-acid residues 736-761 of the S protein, elicited robust neutralizing activities by blocking viral entry at the postbinding and membrane fusion steps. We conclude that amino-acid residues 736-761 of the S protein carry neutralizing epitopes that may be used in the development of vaccines and antiviral agents against MERS-CoV.",

            "text": "M iddle East respiratory syndrome coronavvirus (MERS-CoV), a novel b coronavirus, was recently identified as the causative agent of a severe acute respiratory illness in humans in the Middle East (24) . This finding has raised serious concerns about the possibility of a pandemic infection similar to that caused by severe acute respiratory syndromecoronavirus (SARS-CoV) (2, 20) . As of 4 July 2014, there have been 827 confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, and 287 of the affected people died (www.who.org). Cases have been linked to many regions of Asia, Africa, Europe, and America. According to recent data, people with a mild respiratory illness may be infected with MERS-CoV; in some cases, the infected people have no respiratory symptoms (5, 20, 21, 23) . Patients with a chronic disease or compromised immune system have a higher risk of becoming infected and/or developing complications (2, 5, 20, 21, 26) . There have been small clusters of infection in several countries, suggesting that person-to-person transmission is possible when close contact occurs (16, 21) . The rapid identification of effective therapeutics is a high priority, because there is currently no specific therapy or vaccine for MERS-CoV and the resulting disease is severe with a high case-fatality rate.",

            "text": "MERS-CoV belongs to the genus Betacoronavirus, in the Family Coronaviridae, as SARS-CoV does. However, they do not use the same host cell receptor for infection (14, 19) . Complete genome sequencing indicated that this new virus is the first lineage C Betacoronavirus species known to infect humans (22) . CoVs are positive-strand RNA viruses (4) . The virion comprises a nucleocapsid (N) core surrounded by an envelope containing three membrane proteins: spike (S), membrane, and envelope. The S protein of MERS-CoV, a 1353-amino-acid type I membrane glycoprotein, is known to be responsible for receptor binding (9, 15, 19, 22) , membrane fusion (9a) , and the induction of neutralising antibodies (7) (8) (9) 18) . Although the S protein of MERS-CoV shares little amino-acid identity with that of other CoVs ( < 30%) (22) , it shares common structural features with the S proteins of other CoVs (11,15,22,23a) . Its two components are S1, which contains the receptor-binding domain (RBD) (7) (8) (9) 15, 18) , and S2, which contains the fusion peptide (9a). Dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (also known as CD26) was identified as a functional receptor for MERS-CoV, and the structural basis of S/receptor engagement has been explored (15,19,20,21,23a) . A recent report, indeed, showed the presence of S-specific neutralizing antibodies in MERS-CoV-infected patients (20, 21, 26) . Therefore, the S protein is recognized as the primary target of neutralizing antibodies. Knowledge of the antigenic determinants that can elicit neutralizing antibodies could be beneficial for the development of a protective vaccine.",

Although a properly folded RBD could be the most import target for neutralizing antibodies, as demonstrated for SARS-CoV (6, 10, 13) , the identification of other neutralizing epitopes in the S could assist in the development of a vaccine and therapeutics against MERS-CoV infection. We synthesized peptides from different regions of the MERS-CoV S protein based on a bioinformatics analysis and used them to raise antibodies in rabbits. Recombinant RBD (rRBD) was used to raise polyclonal antibodies in mice. The antisera were then tested in terms of their ability to bind S protein derived from the transfection of the codon-optimized S gene and their capacity to neutralize MERS-CoV using an in vitro neutralizing assay based on lentiviral pseudotyped particles expressing fulllength MERS-CoV S protein. We confirmed that the RBD could efficiently elicit neutralizing antibodies against MERS-CoV and is an essential target for vaccine development. A novel neutralizing epitope corresponding to aminoacid residues 736-761 of the S protein was also identified.",

We suggest that the lack of neutralizing activity of the antiserum against SP2 could be due to the linear conformation of these immunogens. These data also suggest that the conformation of the RBD is essential for the induction of neutralizing activity, and that non-neutralizing immunodominant epitopes exist in the RBD of the MERS-CoV S protein. This is the first linear neutralizing epitope located outside of the RBD in the S protein of MERS-CoV to be reported. This novel epitope targeting residues 736-761 is located at a possible proteocleavage site on the MERS-CoV S protein (15, 20, 22) . We further demonstrated that the neutralizing activity induced by the SP3 peptide was specific for the postbinding and membrane fusion steps of MERS infection. Our data are consistent with a previous report on SARS-CoV (17) , which indicated that human monoclonal antibody (5H10) directed to proteolytic cleavage site (791-805 amino acid) in S neutralized the virus in a rhesus macaque SARS model. Since multiple neutralizing epitopes have been identified on the S protein of SARS-CoV and envelope of HIV-1 (3, 10, 13, 17) , it is not unusual to find more than one neutralizing epitope on the MERS-CoV S protein.",

The RBD of the S protein of MERS-CoV could efficiently elicit neutralizing antibodies that targeted viral binding. Furthermore, we found a novel linear epitope that targeted amino-acid residues 736-761 of the S protein and which elicited robust neutralization by blocking viral entry at the postbinding and membrane fusion steps. We conclude that the amino-acid residues 736-761 of the S protein carry neutralizing epitopes that may be used to develop vaccines and antiviral agents against MERS-CoV.",
