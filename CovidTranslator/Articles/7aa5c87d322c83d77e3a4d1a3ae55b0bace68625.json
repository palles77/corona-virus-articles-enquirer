            "text": "The perception of the spectrum of viral disease has expanded markedly owing to a recognition of the role of viruses in such diverse states as juvenile diarrhea, congenital mental impairment, death after transplantation, cancer, and chronic neurological dysfunction. The transmission of viral disease has been enormously facilitated by widespread air travel which has placed even such exotic horrors as the lassa fever on the doorstep of potentially any physician. Meanwhile, the isolation of interferons and the prospect of effective chemotherapy have further accentuated the need for prompt and effective viral diagnostic measures. Fortunately, this requirement has been accompanied by the growth of an increasingly sophisticated methodology of immunoassay.",

The assay of antigen is familiar for hepatitis. It may prove equally familiar for cytomegalovirus, herpesvirus 2, and others with the development of effective measures for the control of the viruses. The assays for humoral and cellular immunity are becoming increasingly valuable as the significance of the various modalities of the immune response is recognized for its diagnostic and prognostic implications. The assays are also likely to become important for monitoring the efficacy of vaccination and chemotherapy.",

            "text": "Consideration of viral immunodiagnosis can be undertaken under three headings: the virus as an antigen, the immune response to the viral antigen, and the methods of assay. This synopsis will deal principally with the last of the three topics. Table 1 lists the types of viral antigen. Identification of an infecting virus in the cells of the host, or in culture, generally depends on external antigens of the virus or on cell-associated antigens. Immunodiagnostic identification requires the availability of suitable, specific antisera. Subsequent characterization of the antigenic composition of a virus can utilize disrupted viruses or cells and employ internal antigens. The presence of the antigens can be assayed by general methods, such as complement fixation (CF), radioimmunoassay (RIA), or enzyme linked immunoassay (EIA), but an initial identification of antigens in a mixture is often best accomplished by precipitation techniques (for example, double immunodiffusion, immunoelectrophoresis, or crossed immunoelectrophoresis). External or cell-associated antigens are generally detected by methods such as immunofluorescence (IF) or EIA. Functional antigens responsible for viral attachment to cells are tested in neutralization assays, while adventitious attachment is assayed by hemagglutination. Glycoproteins, in addition to being identifiable by the various procedures used for structural antigens, may also be detected by specific reactivity with lectins. Inhibition of a viral infection by lectins has been described [1] . A systematic use of lectins for viral identification has not been attempted but seems to offer interesting possibilities.",

Local immunity is characterized by an IgA antibody response which occurs typically within one to two weeks, varies in duration, but does not manifest a recall (secondary, booster, or memory) component. A variable amount of the antibody in secretion is derived from serum. This fraction can be increased if there is local bleeding, ulceration, or other cause for increased exudation.

It was the first immune response to have been described, \"a change produced in the constitution [which] is not affected by time\" [6] . Recently, it has been shown that the ability of lymphocytes to respond to a viral infection depends on the recognition of a histocompatibility antigen [7] modified in the course of the infection, or co-present on the cell surface with a closely juxtaposed, virally determined antigen. Quantification of cell-mediated immunity is, however, subject to technical difficulties which have prevented its routine exploitation. Nevertheless, in vitro tests can provide substantial information about an individual's ability to respond to viral infection [8, 9] . Further development of these tests may assist in the clinical analysis of virally induced, cell-associated antigens and be useful in the detection of recent or current infection [10], or differentiation of an infectious syndrome (e.g., mumps meningitis [11] ). In vivo challenge (skin testing) with viral antigens is limited in usefulness. Its primary role is in the detection of an individual's ability to respond to common viral antigens as a measure of the retention of a competent cell-mediated immune response (delayed hypersensitivity) rather than as a diagnostic tool in infection [12] .",

Generally, an IgM response is observed within one to two weeks (e.g., with CMV, EBV, measles, rubella, mumps) and an IgG response a few days later [16] . A maximal 1gM response is typically seen in three to six weeks, with subsequent decline in two to three months, while an IgG response becomes maximal in four to twelve weeks and persists for months or years before declining. Determination of the IgM response is therefore more useful in primary or current infection [17, 18] and that of IgG for the assessment of immunity (e.g., to poliomyelitis) or epidemiological study, as well as in acute infection. However, an IgM response may not be apparent, may be intermittent or prolonged, or may occur later. It may recur with subsequent infection. Similarly, indirect hemagglutination, or hemagglutination-inhibition), while others depend on IgG (e.g., IgG-specific immunofluorescence), so that diverse results can be obtained. The lapse of time between infection and the appearance of measurable antibody also varies with the virus ( Table 2 ) and even the viral antigen: e.g., with EBV the antibody to viral capsid antigen appears within days, to nuclear antigen after several weeks or months, but to soluble antibody (by complement fixation) after months to years [20] . Systemic antibody of the IgA or IgD class [15] has undetermined biological significance. Antibody of the IgE class [21] has also received little attention, possibly because viral disease is generally unassociated with immediate hypersensitivity to the virus, though allergy to vaccines can occur, especially to contaminants such as egg protein.",

It is useable whenever a virus can be cultivated and its results probably relate more closely to the protective capability of the antibody than the results of any other test. However, it is laborious, expensive, rather insensitive, and its results are typically unavailable for several days or weeks. The neutralizing antibody can combine directly with the receptor, which is responsible for viral attachment to cells, or it can act indirectly. In the latter case, the antibody reacts with a nearby site where it sterically hinders the attachment of the virus. Steric hindrance is increased by a subsequent attachment of a second antibody, directed against the specific antibody, or of the early components of complement (factors C1-C3). Direct damage to the virus occurs with the addition of the later factors (C5-C9). These features can be used to obtain a manyfold increase in the sensitivity of the neutralization test: e.g., by the addition of a heterologous antiimmunoglobulin [24] and complement [23] . Neutralizing antibody is frequently more Togavirus specific for the strain or type of the infecting virus than antibody assessed by other methods. Neutralization can therefore be used not only to assay the antibody but frequently also to characterize the virus. Modifications of the test have been employed to obtain quicker results or to derive more information about the reactants (for example, the number of neutralized sites on a virus). Such modifications include the plaque reduction assay [25] , the use of an immunofluorescent antibody to identify infected cells, and kinetic neutralization assay [26] . The complement fixation assay depends on the addition of a standardized amount of complement (fresh guinea pig serum) to the viral antigen-antibody mixture [27] . The added complement is consumed and therefore is no longer available to lyse an indicator system which consists of sheep red cells bearing a complement-fixing (lytic) antibody (rabbit anti-sheep red cell hemolysin). Fixation of complement occurs chiefly with antibody of the IgM and IgG class (but not subclass 4), which induce the classical pathway of complement activation. Other antibody may activate the alternate pathway. In practice, IgM antibody is sometimes (M. August and A. Baumgarten, unpublished) detected by the test, but not always, owing to its low sensitivity and the small amount of IgM found in circulation (compared to the typically high IgG antibody level).",

Inhibition of the agglutination detects the antibody to the viral receptor for the erythrocyte. In reverse hemagglutination an antibody is used to coat red cells, which are then agglutinated by the virus, a process which can again be inhibited by antibody in a tested fluid. Alternatively, a viral antigen is used to coat the erythrocytes which are then agglutinated by the antibody (passive or indirect hemagglutination). In this case, viral antigen is assessed by its ability to inhibit the agglutination. The hemagglutination reaction for antibody while simple in principle and potentially very sensitive, especially for IgM antibody where its sensitivity can be several thousandfold greater than for IgG antibody, requires a careful (and often elusive) preparation of reagents. The conditions for the preparation of coated red cells include attention to the pH, type, and concentration of buffer, duration of incubation, the temperature, suitable concentration (usually high) of viral antigen (which requires at least partial purification), and an appropriate preparation of the erythrocye surface. The last may range from simple washing, through the use of tannic acid (at an appropriate concentration) to the addition of stabilizing agents (e.g., formaldehyde) and protein coupling agents [35, 36] (gluteraldehyde, chromic chloride, dinitrodifluorobenzene, carbodiimide, etc).

The sensitivity of IF is intermediate between that of unlabelled tests (such as CF), and other methods which use labelled reagents (e.g., EIA or RIA). More sophisticated techniques, such as fluorescence polarization [49] , may further extend the application of the methodology.",
