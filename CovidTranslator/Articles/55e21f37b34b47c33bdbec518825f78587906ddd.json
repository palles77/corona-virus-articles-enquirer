This work aims to describe the epidemiological, clinical, and virological pattern of ARI that tested negative for influenza virus, in children under five years old. Materials and Methods: one thousand and fifty nine samples of patients presenting influenza Like Illness (ILI) or Severe Acute Respiratory Infections (SARI) symptoms were tested for other respiratory viruses using multiplex RT-PCR assays targeting 10 respiratory viruses. Results: The following pathogens were detected as follows, hRV 31,92% (98/307), hRSV 24.4% (75/329), PIV 20.5% (63/307), HCoV 229E 12,05% (37/307), hMPV 6.2% (19/307), HCoVOC43 1.0% (3/307) and EnV 1.0% (3/307). Among the 1,059 specimens analyzed, 917 (86.6%) were ILI samples and 142 (23.4%) were SARI samples. The proportion of children infected with at least one virus was 29.8% (273/917) in ILI cases and 23.9% (34/142) in SARI cases. The most prevalent viruses, responsible for ILI cases were hRV with 35.89% (98/273) and hRSV in SARI cases with 41.2% (14/34) of cases. Among the 1,059 patients, only 22 (2.1%) children presented risk factors related to the severity of influenza virus infection. Conclusion: This study showed that respiratory viruses play an important role in the etiology of ARI in children. For a better understanding of the epidemiology of ARI and improved case management, it would be interesting in this context to expand the surveillance of influenza to other respiratory viruses.",

The World Health Organization (WHO) classifies respiratory infections as the second leading cause of death worldwide in children under the age of five (Bryce et al., 2005) . Approximately 2.2 million children worldwide die each year of ARI and nearly 40% of these deaths occur in Africa because of limited diagnostic capacities (Williams et al., 2002) . It has been shown that viral infections play a major role in the occurrence of ARI in developed countries. In sub-Saharan Africa some work on specific viruses such as influenza (Inf) and human respiratory syncytial viruses (hRSV) have been realized but data on the occurrence of ARI remain insufficient (Tiveljung-Lindell et al., 2009 , Brittain-Long et al., 2008 . Indeed, the responsibility of viruses other than influenza in the occurrence of ARI is not yet sufficiently documented.",

Recent studies done in Kenya, Cameroon and Senegal have highlighted the high prevalence of these pathogens in ARI (Berkley et al., 2010 , Njouom et al., 2012 , Niang et al., 2010 especially in children. Respiratory viruses frequently associated with ARI include Inf A and B, hRSV, Enteroviruses (EnV), human Metapneumovirus (hMPV), Rhinovirus (hRV), Adenovirus, Parainfluenza virus (PIV) type 1-3 (Pretorius et al., 2012 , Razanajatovo et al., 2011 . These viruses are responsible for severe clinical forms of common viral infections (bronchiolitis, pneumonia, laryngitis, asthma) (Puzelli et al., 2009 ). However these etiologic pathogens are not sought in practice due to the underestimation of their involvement in ARI, the lack of an adapted laboratory diagnosis capacities, and limited treatment options. The control of children morbidity and mortality is based on a better understanding of the epidemiology of the disease and the availability of adequate laboratory diagnosis capacity.",

This surveillance has helped to identify and characterize circulating seasonal influenza A(H1N1), A(H3N2), A(H1N1) pdm09 and influenza B viruses. These viruses circulate throughout the year with a peak that varies according to the occurrence of the rainy season between the months of May and June. This surveillance system has contributed to identify age groups at high risk of severe influenza disease (Kadjo et al., 2013) . Along with the circulation of influenza viruses, other respiratory viruses were detected in patients presenting with ILI. Given the limited resources of the laboratory, the diagnosis of other respiratory viruses was retrospective and limited to children under five years old. From 2006, as part of the preparation for influenza pandemic, the technical capacities of the laboratory have been strengthened by the tools for molecular diagnosis, staff training and regular supply of reagents and consumables through a cooperative agreement with the U.S. CDC Influenza Division in Atlanta and the Institut Pasteur in Paris. Therefore, it seemed appropriate in this context to add the surveillance of other respiratory viruses to the influenza surveillance network. This study aims to describe the epidemiological and virological patterns of ARI due to non-influenza respiratory viruses in children under five years of age in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire.",

Patients who did not meet the case definitions or for which the verbal consent of the parent or legal guardian was not obtained were excluded from the study. A structured and standardized questionnaire to collect socio-demographic, epidemiological and clinical data was developed and used. The questionnaire also included the collection of outcome data, risk factors related to the severity of the influenza virus infection such as asthma, chronic lung disease, hepatitis, diabetes, malnutrition, obesity, heart disease, chronic kidney disease, blood disorders, and immune deficiencies (e.g. HIV infection) (Mertz et al., 2013 , Gill et al., 2015 . Samples from each patient included in the study were collected using sterile nasopharyngeal swabs that were then placed in a viral transport medium, VTM (MEM, Gibco-BRL, life Technologies, Paisley, Scotland, Penicillin 200 U / ml, streptomycin 200 mg / ml, BioWhittaker, MA; mycostatin 200U/ml, Sigma, bovine serum albumin 0.25%, Merck, Darmstadt, Germany). Once collected, samples were placed into coolers and transported immediatly to the national influenza center (NIC) located at the Institut Pasteur of C\u00f4te d'Ivoire for sites located in Abidjan or stored in a refrigerator at the sentinel site between 2\u00b0C -8\u00b0C until they're transported to the NIC twice a week. The maximum storage period at each site did not exceed 3 days. ",

The present study targeted eleven respiratory viruses involved in human respiratory infections. The global detection rate of viruses in our study was 29.1%. This result is consistent with the results of several previous studies that found percentages between 27-35% (Yang et al . When conducting this study, conventional PCR was the only method available in the laboratory for the screening of other respiratory viruses. In 10 recent years the sensitivity of diagnostic tests for the detection of respiratory viruses has been greatly improved with the development of multiplex real time PCR protocols with high sensitivity and targeting major respiratory viruses involved in human pathology (Barratt et al., 2017 , Zhao et al., 2017 , Malhotra et al., 2016 . The use of conventional PCR could thus be one of the main limitations of our study and explain to a large extent the overall virus detection rate reported in our study. However, it should be noted that for a better understanding of the involvement of respiratory viruses in the respiratory infections of children, it would be interesting to have standardized study protocols.",

The HCoV229E was with a rate of 12, 05 % of detection. Some studies have found low rates of detection of coronaviruses. According to McIntosh et al (2004) , the global incidence of LRTIs due to HCoV was not higher than 3.8% However some studies have shown that the prevalence of these coronavirus in pediatric patients can be significantly higher, varying from about 5% to more than 30% and these discrepancies could be attributed to differences in the research methodologies. Parainfluenza viruses were the most frequent pathogen detected in dual detection cases. These data do not corroborate the assertion that the viruses most commonly involved in codetection were the viruses with the highest incidence (O'Grady et al., 2016). From the clinical point of view, our study showed that respiratory viruses were found in both cases of ILI and SARI in Children with high proportions (23.4% -29.8%). Search for respiratory viruses in cases of acute respiratory infections is not systematic in our tropics. The diagnostic approach is empirically oriented on bacterial etiologies. Today with the accessibility and widespread of PCR, this research should be integrated into the clinicians' diagnostic approach particularly in infants in whom the viral infection can lead to a severe form of respiratory infection especially in the presence of risk factors. Indeed as attested by our study, over 68.0% of children with risk factors presented with severe acute respiratory infections related to viral infection. The most predominant viruses in these cases were hRSV with a rate of 50.0%. The hRSV were also the most involved viruses in SARI cases with 41.2% of cases. This correlated well with the results of several studies showing hRSV as a common cause of lower respiratory tract infection in children admitted to the hospital (Nair H et al., 2010) Our study showed a high proportion of asthma (63.4%) in patients with history of risk factors in According to recent systematic review, using molecular techniques, respiratory viruses are detected in around 80.0% of asthma exacerbation with highest prevalence in children (Papadopoulos and Johnston, 1998) . It is obvious that preventive measures and timely management of viral infections in children including children with a history of asthma reduce exacerbation of seizures and progression to severe forms of viral infection.",

The differents primers used for amplification are listed on thetable 1. For master mix reagents, QIAGEN OneStep RT-PCR Cat No.210212 has been used according to the manufacturer's recommendation. All heminested have been done with Amplitaq Recombinant + 10x buffer (Applied Biosystem/Applera Ref 8080152) and dNTPs 2mM (Set deoxynucleotides PCR grade -Roche -Ref 11969064). For each multiplex, positive controls provided by the virology laboratory of Clemenceau University Teaching Hospital (Caen, France) were used. The RT-PCR cycling condition were 30 min at 50\u00b0C and 15 min at 94\u00b0C followed by 40 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 30 sec at 94\u00b0C, 30 sec at 55\u00b0C and 1mn at 72\u00b0C following by 72\u00b0C for 10mn and final at 4) \u00b0C in GeneAmp\u00ae PCR System 9700 (Applied Biosystems).",

However, the individual trends of the viruses were not the same. Cases of HRV infection occurred throughout the year. The months of January to May demonstrated the highest number of HRV infections (72,44% of detected virus). A pic was observed in the month of March. A similar trend occurred for Parainfluenza virus with 85,71% of virus detected between the months January to June. High circulation of hRSV and hMPV occurred during the months of June to December. Circulation of other viruses (coronavirus OC43 and enterovirus) occurred in the months of March, May, June and November. Distribution of viruses detected by month",

The difference observed in rate of viral etiology could be explained by several factors related to the different study population, geographical catchment area, inclusion criteria, targeted viruses and diagnostic techniques and primers used (Choudhary et al., 2016, Ali et al., 2011)",
