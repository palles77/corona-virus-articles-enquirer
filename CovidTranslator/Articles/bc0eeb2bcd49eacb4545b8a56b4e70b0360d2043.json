Clay minerals are, in general, hydrated alumino-silicates containing alkaline and alkaline earth metals. Among the layered clay minerals (phyllosilicates), only some of them, including kaolin, talc (sensu lato), smectites, and fibrous clays can be used as excipients in the formulation of different dosage forms such as solid, liquid, or semisolid. The application of each clay mineral is determined by the individual intrinsic properties derived from the structure type (1:1 or 2:1 layer type) and chemical composition.",

            "text": "The kaolin group of minerals, including kaolinite (Kln) and halloysite, has a 1:1 layer-type structure, in which the layer is composed of a tetrahedral silica sheet and an octahedral alumina sheet combined in a unit, and the layers are stacked along the c axis by hydrogen bonding interaction. Although Kln also has a relatively small specific surface area (SSA) compared to other types of clay minerals, some reports have dealt with its rapid rate of exchange reaction and good adsorption properties on the surface for small molecules such as proteins, bacteria, and viruses (Barral et al., 2008; Rutkai and Krist\u00f3 f, 2008) . Talc (Tlc) is a 2:1 phyllosilicate composed of an edge-linked MgO 4 (OH) 2 octahedral sheet located between two corner-linked tetrahedral silica sheets through sharing of oxygen atoms. Talc is an excellent adsorbent due to its large adsorption capacity for hydrophilic and hydrophobic substances (L\u00f3 pez- Galindo et al., 2007; Rotenberg et al., 2011; Jadhav et al., 2013) . Smectite (Sme) is an expandable 2:1 phyllosilicate with a layer charge of \u00c00.2 to \u00c00.6 per formula unit. Each individual layer is composed of a sheet of octahedrally coordinated aluminum, magnesium, or iron atoms with oxygen ligands and hydroxyl groups, which is sandwiched between two sheets of tetrahedral silicons coordinated with oxygen atoms. Smectite is subdivided into dioctahedral and trioctahedral Sme, depending on the number and the nature of octahedral cations. When the octahedrally and/or tetrahedrally coordinated elements are substituted by cations of lower valence such as Mg 2+ and/or Al 3+ , respectively, a cation exchange capacity (CEC) develops due to the formation of a negative layer charge and its distribution upon substitution. Not only because of its large CEC, surface area, and swellability, but also because of its biocompatibility, Sme has been recommended frequently for biomedical applications, especially pharmaceutics (Gamiz et al., 1992; Aguzzi et al., 2007; Park et al., 2008) . Palygorskite and sepiolite are 2:1 phyllosilicates and, unlike other clay minerals, have a fibrous morphology. They contain a continuous twodimensional tetrahedral sheet, but differ from other layer silicates in that they lack continuous octahedral sheets, which can be considered as ribbons of 2:1 phyllosilicate structure. Each ribbon is linked to the next ribbon by inversion of SiO 4 tetrahedra along a set of Si\u00c0O bonds. Such micron-sized needle-like fibrous clays have been used widely as an adsorbent because their structures contain micropores and they have a large SSA (40\u00c0180 m 2 /g) compared to that of the kaolinite (5\u00c040 m 2 /g). Palygorskite and sepiolite are also amenable to assembly with a polymer matrix through hydrogen bonding, making them suitable for pharmaceutical formulations (Viseras and L\u00f3 pez-Galindo, 1999; Lop\u00e9z-Galindo and Viseras, 2004) . The properties of these various types of clay minerals make them suitable for biomedical applications because they are abundant and have plentiful surface space which is reactive with many biological, organic, and inorganic substances.",

For example, peloid, mud used therapeutically, is administered locally to alleviate joint pain and recover bone-muscle damage, by slowly elevating the local temperature of the underlying tissues without causing damage (Ferrand and Yvon, 1991; Cara et al., 2000a Cara et al., , 2000b . Medicinal clays have also been used in curing ulcers, preventing infections, and even treating some allergies in the body (Poensin et al., 2003; Veniale et al., 2004) . Moreover, clay minerals have been adjusted to improve pharmaceutical properties depending on the medical application required. The hydrophilic surface can be rendered hydrophobic by different treatments, including ion exchange with quaternary ammonium compounds; the resulting organoclays are compatible with polymers and can be used to prepare organoclaypolymer composites. Such organoclays, either individually or in combination with polymers, have been used widely in the formulation of biomedical applications (Ghadiri et al., 2015) .",

Because clay minerals are efficient and safe transporters, they may provide a new paradigm in the field of drug delivery systems (DDS) compared to other inorganic materials (Aguzzi et al., 2007; Suresh et al., 2010; Viseras et al., 2010; de Sousa Rodrigues et al., 2013) . Drug delivery systems have many advantages, e.g. reduced side effects from the drug due to sustained release and better patient compliance through reduced dose frequency. For many types of controlled-release formulations, immediately upon placement in the release medium a large initial bolus of drug is released uncontrollably before it can reach a stable release rate (i.e. 'initial burst' or 'burst release'), which can result in toxicity. Drug formulations for controlling the release rate of the drug (i.e. delayed release, extended release, or sustained release) can achieve the dual target of reduced toxicity and better compliance along with enhanced drug efficacy.",

For example, the Na forms of Sme are effective in laxatives, stimulating defecation through osmosis, and their Ca forms can be used as anti-diarrhea agents, via oral administration, due to strong adsorbent properties (Alestig et al., 1979; Ippoliti, 1998; Carretero, 2002) . In addition, clay minerals are well known as emulsifying, gelling, and thickening agents in pharmaceutical formulations for oral medication (Bolger, 1995; Viseras and L\u00f3 pez-Galindo, 1999; Abend and Lagaly, 2000) , because those clay minerals can absorb water or oils and modulate the viscosity of formulations. When used as ingredients for improved organoleptic qualities in pharmacological formulations, clay minerals can mask unpleasant tastes or smells of drugs and prevent unwanted changes in their intrinsic colors and physicochemical properties through the stabilization effects of the inorganic matrix and modulation of drug-release properties (Lee et al., 2012; Oh et al., 2013; Ambrogi et al., 2014) .",

On the other hand, the diffraction peaks for other composites containing 5, 7, and 9 wt.% O-Mnt were all located at 2.3\u00ba2y corresponding to a d value of 3.8 nm. The entangled polymer chain of PMMA was inserted into the interlayer space of the O-Mnt, resulting in an expansion of the d spacing by >25% compared to that of the unaltered O-Mnt. As the blending time increased from 10 to 20 min, a pronounced exfoliation of O-Mnt occurred gradually with rather flat and very small humps at the same position ( Figure 1d ). As nanoscale mixing was established, the degree of interactions between organic and inorganic increased as a result of extensive interfacial contacts. The O-Mnt/PMMA composites prepared showed not only a significant enhancement in terms of thermal stability without degradation of PMMA, but also significant improvement in the mechanical properties such as impact strength, which are, in general, very desirable in typical formulations for bone cements. In particular, the thermal degradation temperature and impact strength of O-Mnt/PMMA composites were increased by 1.13 and 1.66 times, respectively, compared to those of pure PMMA. In addition, the O-Mnt/PMMA composites showed an improved cell growth on the bone-cement surface, as confirmed by colorimetric assay for assessing cell metabolic activity.

In a similar study, halloysite, a naturally occurring microtubular aluminosilicate, could encapsulate a highly water-soluble drug (diltiazem HCl) in order to induce a sustained drug-release property. The release of diltiazem HCl was examined by dissolution testing in pH 6.8 buffer media, simulating conditions in the small intestine. The drug release by halloysite was retarded only slightly with an evident 'large burst' effect compared to that of unaltered diltiazem HCl. The highly watersoluble nature of the drug and simple entrapment in halloysite meant that the clay did not have an adequate sustained-release property. In an attempt to prolong the release of diltazem HCl from the halloysite, in situ polymerization with various alkylcyanoacrylate monomers and drug-loaded halloysite hybrids in a nonaqueous solvent was carried out for 8 h. Among three different formulations, the diltiazem HCl-halloysite hybrid coated with poly-iso-butyl cyanoacrylate was found to be most effective, showing a reduced 'initial burst' effect and achieving sustained release, where the release kinetics was best fitted by a 'square-root of time' dependence. The poly-iso-butyl cyanoacrylate was added as a coating to the surface of the drugencapsulated halloysite by in situ polymerization, and this retarded drug release significantly.",

The drug molecules loaded in the pellets exhibited a prolonged-release profile following an 'initial burst' release due to entrapment within the porous architecture of the pellets. The pelletized porous clays in an oral dosage form could lead to extended drug release, which depends not only on the pH of the release medium, but also on the design of the porous architecture including the porosity and the pore size.

            "text": "A new concept related to an organoleptic development with clay minerals has emerged in pharmaceutics. Specifically, taste-masking formulations with clay minerals to block the unpleasant taste of drugs have been studied intensively because such drugs often face limitations in terms of formulation design, and have poor patient compliance. Sildenafil (SDN) and Aripiprazole (APZ) were intercalated into Mnt by cation exchange reaction to yield clay-drug hybrids, and subsequently coated with a cationic polymer, polyvinylacetal diethylamino acetate (AEA), by a spray-drying process to further improve the taste-blocking efficiency and also control the drug-release kinetics (Lee et al., 2012; Oh et al., 2013) . Both AEA-coated SDN-Mnt and APZ-Mnt hybrids suppressed the drug-release rate to a significant extent (4.70 \u00d4 0.53% for SDN and <1% for APZ) at neutral pH after 2 min, suggesting that they have potential to mask the bitter or unpleasant taste of drugs in the buccal cavity. Under simulated gastric-fluid conditions (pH 1.2), the release profiles of SDN from the SDN-Mnt and AEA-coated SDN-Mnt were examined and compared with those of intact SDN and the clinically used drug, Viagra 1 (Figure 3a) . Predictably, intact SDN and Viagra 1 displayed substantial initial burst release of 90% SDN within 10 min and their cumulative release amounts reached 99% in 2 h due to the high solubility of SDN in the acidic conditions. On the other hand, SDN could not be released effectively from the SDN-Mnt (<3%) because of strong ionic interaction between the intercalated SDN and Mnt in the acidic conditions. Remarkably,~75% of SDN was discharged from AEA-coated SDN-Mnt within 10 min and reached 90% by 2 h because dissolved cationic AEA at low pH was exchanged with SDN in the interlayer space of Mnt and enlarged the interlayer spacing to facilitate drug diffusion toward the release media. With regard to APZ, the drug-release rate for AEA-coated APZ-Mnt increased significantly with the help of AEA, compared to the APZ-Mnt (Figure 3b ). The drug-release patterns revealed that both AEA-coated drug-Mnt hybrids were considered as good formulations for preventing the unpleasant taste of drugs and had similar drug efficacy to alternatives used in clinical environments. In addition, these pharmaceutical formulations proved useful for improving in vivo pharmacokinetics and bioavailability, as verified by comparison with the drugs currently in clinical use (Figure 3c\u00c0e ). For the AEA-coated SDN\u00c0Mnt hybrid, the maximum concentration (C max ) and area under the curve from 0 h to infinity (AUC 0-? ) were 1.16 and 1.26 larger than those obtained with Viagra 1 (AUC 0-? = 69.2 \u00d4 3.19 mg h/mL; C max = 10.5 \u00d4 0.64 mg/mL). In the case of the AEA-coated APZ\u00c0Mnt hybrid, a~20% increase of in vivo drug bioavailability was shown as compared to Vol. 64, No. 2, 2016 Clay-drug hybrid materials for biomedical applications Abilify 1 . The clay-drug hybrid coated with a cationic macromolecule demonstrated, therefore, potential for blocking the unpleasant taste of the drug, as well as for enhancing the bioavailability of the drug.",

The molecular arrangement of poorly soluble IDM in the IDM-Mnt complex prevented the recrystallization of IDM itself, and the hydrophilic surface of the complex also resulted in an enhancement of dispersibility of the complex in aqueous solution.

In this transdermal patch system, the solubility and physicochemical stability, as well as the dispersibility of the PR, were greatly enhanced by combining with magnesium aluminum silicate (MAS), which consequently prevented recrystallization of the drug. For stability test, the patches containing MAS-PR hybrid were stored under accelerating conditions at 40\u00baC and 75% relative humidity in a light-blocked state. The permeability of PR in the patches was maintained in stable fashion without recrystallization even after 6 months of the storage. In addition, the permeability of PR in the patches was enhanced by a factor of two or more in comparison with that of commercially available Trast 2 patches, even though the clay-drug hybrid patch contained only half of the amount of PR. The clay-drug hybrid materials are expected to be more prominent in terms of TDDS because they could not only overcome various intrinsic demerits of intact drugs, but could also confer excellent skin permeability to drug molecules.",

            "text": "To control the chemical stability and release behavior of drug molecules, a similar approach was carried out by changing the pH of the synthetic medium (Pongjanyakul et al., 2009) . Depending on the pH value, some drugs can be in a cationic, anionic, or neutral form. In the case of the protonated cationic drug, ion exchange can occur with negatively charged clay minerals. For example, nicotine (NCT), a volatile and alkaline liquid used widely in smoking-cessation therapy and which possesses two pk a values (pk a1 = 3.04 and pk a2 = 7.84), results in differently charged NCT under different pH conditions. When the protonated NCT was incorporated into MAS, a mixture of Mnt and saponite (Sap), under acidic (pH 4) and neutral (pH 7) conditions, NCT encased in NCT-MAS hybrid became thermodynamically more stable than the intact form of NCT, giving rise to a reduction in evaporation. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis showed that a broad endothermic peak for the evaporation of NCT was shifted from 147\u00baC to 215\u00baC after intercalation of NCT into MAS. In addition, a broad exothermic peak at 300\u00baC was observed in the MAS-NCT hybrid due to a decomposition of intercalated NCT, which was not Vol. 64, No. 2, 2016 Clay-drug hybrid materials for biomedical applications observed in the DSC thermogram of intact NCT. In addition, NCT molecules stabilized in MAS were released biphasically, in which an 'initial burst' release occurred, followed by a slow release; the release profile was well fitted to both the particle diffusion-controlled model and Higuchi's model (Singhvi and Singh, 2011) . Specifically, while 54% NCT was released rapidly from a physical mixture of NCT and MAS within 2 min, the release of NCT from MAS-NCT hybrid was reduced significantly to 36%. The T 60% (time to reach 60% NCT release) value of NCT release from the MAS-NCT hybrid was eight times greater than that of the physical mixture. The MAS-NCT hybrid may be a good model case for transdermal drug delivery due to its enhanced thermal stability and sustained release behavior. A new TDDS, by Shaikh et al. (2007) , suggested incorporating organomodified clay (OC) hybrids into polydimethyl siloxane (PDMS) to attain OC-based pressure sensitive adhesive (PSA) formulations (OC-PDMS). The hydrophobic surface property of organomodified clay minerals can facilitate the formation of clay-polymer composites and eventually improve mechanical properties such as the shear strength of the polymer composites. Moreover, the hydrophilic surface property of PDMS adhesives, terminated with \u00c0OH groups, could result in strong hydrogen bonding with the clay platelets, giving rise to an enhanced dispersion in an aqueous matrix. Based on the strategy above, an optimized level of OC additives to the polymer matrix for a transdermal PSA formulation was found by Shaikh et al. (2007) to realize controlled drug-release kinetics, enhanced adhesive properties, and reinforced shear strength. By adding 2% and 5% of OC, the 'initial burst' of drug release was suppressed reasonably well, and as a consequence, the total drug release decreased b\u1ef9 50 and 75% after 10 days, respectively. This was surely due to the fact that the clay platelets were well dispersed in the PSA composites, resulting in controlled release of drug molecules. In addition, measurement of the shear adhesion failure temperature (SAFT) and shear strength presented significant improvements in the adhesion properties of OC-PDMS composites. The SAFT (21%) and shear strength (265%) were determined to be enhanced for the 1% OC-loaded PSA composite due to the reinforcement effect of homogeneously dispersed clay minerals. Such OC-PSA formulations would be applicable for TDDS, because they could not only provide a steady and extended penetration of the drug in blood, leading to the minimization of the adverse side effects such as toxicity, but also improve adhesive property and mechanical strength.",

            "text": "The NCT-absorbed sodium alginate-magnesium aluminum silicate (SA-MAS)-based film was suggested by Pongjanyakul and Suksri (2009) to have significant potential for use as a buccal delivery system. The SA-MAS films were prepared for loading large amounts of NCT and achieving a sustained permeation rate, as compared to native SA film. At acidic and neutral pH, the protonated NCT molecules could be strongly bound with the negatively charged film through electrostatic interaction. The incorporation of MAS, a mixture of Mnt and Sap, into the SA films at pH 10 increased the NCT content in the film from 4.5 to 6.9% (w/w) and decreased the NCT permeation rate from 5.61 \u00d4 1.17 to 1.64 \u00d4 0.33% cm \u00c02 min \u00c00.5 , compared to those of the SA film. The NCT-loaded SA-MAS films fabricated at pH 5 and pH 7 showed greater loading of NCT (10.5% and 8.4%, respectively) and smaller permeation rates (1.23 and 1.45% cm \u00c02 min \u00c00.5 , respectively) than those of NCTloaded SA-MAS film prepared at pH 10. On the other hand, the detachment force of all NCT-loaded SA-MAS films was reduced significantly regardless of the preparation pH, compared to that of the SA film. The interaction between the MAS and hydroxyl and/or carboxyl groups of SA resulted in low water uptake and swelling of the composite films and decreased mobility and flexibility of SA molecules, which eventually reduced physical entanglements of SA and mucus. Although the NCT-loaded SA-MAS film showed a weaker bioadhesive property than the NCT-loaded SA film, the clay mineral-loaded film was still bioadhesive enough for adhesion on the mucosal membrane. Given these results, the buccal drug delivery formulation with clay minerals could be expected to suppress the intrinsic volatility of NCT and enhance bioavailability of NCT when applied to mucosal membranes.",

Such an implant material could deliver active ingredients to specific organs, such as teeth, bone, subcutaneous fat, eye, vagina, and blood vessel. A local drug-delivery formulation was envisioned by Kelly et al. (2004) for periodontal disease using two components. The chitosantetracycline-halloysite hybrid prepared was formulated with thermo-responsive polymer (poloxamer 407), tissue adhesives (polyethylene glycol (PEG) and octyl cyanoacrylate (OCA)), and water for further improvement of retention in the gingival and periodontal pocket, defined as the presence of an abnormal depth of the gingival sulcus at which the gingival tissue contacts the tooth. The optimized formulation (Poloxamer 407 20% (w/w), PEG 20,000 0.5% (w/w), OCA 1% (w/w), and 200 mg/mL chitosan-tetracycline-halloysite hybrid) was determined after careful denaturalization tests of the syringeability to facilitate ease of administration to the periodontal pocket, as well as the thermal stability to maintain a high storage modulus upon achieving body temperature. This formulation was very stable in vitro for at least 9 months at room temperature (20\u00baC) with no changes in syringeability (45.53 N) or gelling temperature (24.9\u00baC). Preliminary in vivo tests using a wound pocket creation model in dogs were carried out to estimate the amount of drug release and the retentive ability of the formulation. The drug was found to be delivered easily to the target site at a locally effective level (average drug concentration = 21.24 mg/100 mg) and retained in the pocket for up to 6 weeks.",

            "text": "In order to treat chronic inflammatory diseases, claydrug hybrid-based polyurethane (PU) implants have been developed (Da Silva et al., 2009; Pinto et al., 2011) . Biodegradable PU has been investigated extensively due to its great biocompatibility, chemical versatility, and superior mechanical properties. Da Silva et al. (2009) incorporated 5 wt.% of Mnt into aqueous polyurethane dispersions (PUD) in order to control the biodegradability of PUD and the release rate of the drug incorporated. Disc-type implantable devices, 1 mm thick and 4.5 mm in diameter, were fabricated successfully by casting PUD composites containing dexamethasone acetate (ACT) and Mnt, and then implanted into the subcutaneous fat on the back of mice to examine in vivo drug release rate and biocompatibility. Prior to in vivo evaluations, in vitro degradation of PUD and PUD-Mnt composite and in vitro release profiles of ACT from ACT-loaded PUD and PUD-Mnt composite were analyzed. The increased mass loss of PUD-Mnt composite was associated with its greater hydrophilicity than PUD because of the clay mineral incorporated. Hydrophilic Mnt effectively allowed the penetration and diffusion of water in the polymer chains, which increased the hydrolysis rate of the ester bonds in PCL segments in the PUD composite. In vitro drugrelease tests showed that~18% and 29% of ACT were released during the first 10 weeks by PUD and the PUD-Mnt composite, respectively, by a diffusion process through pre-existent channels and pores. Then, their release rates were enhanced significantly by hydrolytic degradation of the PUD and PUD-Mnt composites between the 10 th and 20 th weeks of the dissolution test. In the final stage of release, a slower release rate of ACT was observed for both PUD and PUD-Mnt composites as a consequence of reduced drug concentrations in the implantable discs. Given those positive results, the incorporation of the clay mineral appears to be advantageous in terms of achieving controlled long-term drug delivery with implantable devices. Moreover, any mild inflammatory response observed in the tissues adjacent to the implants in the initial state was resolved completely within a 2-week period. The extent of neutrophil accumulation, assessed by myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, decreased substantially during the first week of the implantation period, which indicated that the inflammatory response was resolved quickly. The PU implants fabricated with the clay-drug hybrid thus seemed feasible as local drug delivery devices for the treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases.",

This kind of disease cannot be cured easily by means of topical eye drops or oral drug medication because the administration of such medications does not allow effective penetration of the drugs through the natural barriers of the body. An attempt was made to immobilize dexamethasone acetate, a type of corticoid used for the treatment of uveitis, into biodegradable PU composites Vol. 64, No. 2, 2016 Clay-drug hybrid materials for biomedical applications containing clay minerals, which were obtained by delaminating Mnt within a PU aqueous dispersion. The Mnt was employed to adjust the mechanical properties of PU to match the ocular soft tissues. The elastic modulus of intact PU was improved by a factor of~10 by the addition of Mnt, which could not be achieved easily by simply changing the ratio between the soft and hard segments of PU. In addition, well distributed Mnt in the PU composites played an important role as a reservoir and transporter of the therapeutic ingredient at the desired site, which may contribute greatly to overcoming the low permeability of the drug. Thus, the drug was released constantly from PU-containing Mnt for 371 days by diffusion, together with the degradation mechanism of PU. Finally, to evaluate in vitro cytotoxicity of the composites, human retinal pigment epithelial cells were cultured directly with PU and PU-Mnt implants for 7 days. Then, MTT (3-(4,5-Dimethyl-2thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide) tetrazolium assay was conducted for assessing cell metabolic activity. The cellular oxidoreductase enzymes of viable cells are able to reduce or convert MTT to a purple- Tablets, ointments, cream Singer and Gal\u00e1n, (2011) colored formazan, which is a marker of only the viable cells. The viability of the cells upon culturing with PU and PU-Mnt was confirmed to be 95.23 \u00d4 6.41% and 96.24 \u00d4 5.09, respectively, compared to the negative control. All experimental results indicated that the biocompatible dexamethasone acetate-loaded PU-Mnt composite could be applicable as a suitable substrate for ocular implant devices. The synthesis and characterization of a hydrogel containing polyacrylamide/sodium carboxymethyl cellulose/Mnt nanocomposite was attempted by Sharifzadeh (2013) in order to fabricate a vaginal ring for LDDS. By adding sodium carboxymethyl cellulose to a hydrogel, the swelling behavior was improved gradually, but the mechanical strength was reduced. To resolve this defect, Mnt was added to the hydrogel for its rigid structure with optimum swelling property. With the aid of Mnt, extended drug release was achieved for~15 days under simulated local conditions by reducing the 'initial burst' of the drug. This composite, containing clay minerals, may be a possible candidate for vaginal DDS.",

Depending on the routes of administration of clay minerals for biomedical applications, clay minerals can be selected in order to control key parameters including size, swellability, CEC, SSA, mucoadhesiveness, dispersibility, and drug-release rate. In addition, the hybridization reaction of the drug with clay minerals, whatever the physical adsorption or intercalation, results not only in enhanced solubility and physicochemical stability of drug molecules, but also offers a controlled and sustained drug-release rate, and eventually achieves improved bioavailability due to efficient drug delivery. The advanced developments of clay-drug hybrid systems via various routes of administration will allow medication to be deployed to specifically targeted parts of the body (organs or cells). Although the field of clay-drug hybrid systems has experienced significant growth over the past decade, many challenges remain. From general prospects, clay-drug hybrid systems seemed to be very effective and to work well in vitro, but some fail in in vivo due to complications involved in real biological conditions. Also, toxicology studies are required to determine whether the clay-drug hybrid or polymer-claydrug composites can be applied in clinical environments. The gene delivery and programed DDS, i.e. targetability and/or environmental stimuli responsiveness, with clay minerals are further challenges. Innovative design in terms of formulations with clay-drug hybrids advance clinical use and consequently open new drug-delivery markets. Finally, research on clay minerals will expand their applications in biomedical fields, such as regenerative tissue engineering, theranosis, personalized medicine, pharmaceutics, implants, etc.",
