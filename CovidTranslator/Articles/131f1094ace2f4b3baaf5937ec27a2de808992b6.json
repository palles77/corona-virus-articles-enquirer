            "text": "One of the main goals of community ecology is to measure the relative importance of environmental filters to understand patterns of species distribution at different temporal and spatial scales. Likewise, the identification of factors that shape symbiont metacommunity structures is important in disease ecology because resulting structures drive disease transmission. We tested the hypothesis that distributions of virus species and viral families from rodents and bats are defined by shared responses to host phylogeny and host functional characteristics, shaping the viral metacommunity structures at four spatial scales (Continental, Biogeographical, Zoogeographical, and Regional). The contribution of host phylogeny and host traits to the metacommunity of viruses at each spatial scale was calculated using a redundant analysis of canonical ordering (RDA). For rodents, at American Continental scale the coherence of viral species metacommunity increased while the spatial scale decreased and Quasi-Clementsian structures were observed. This pattern suggests a restricted distribution of viruses through their hosts, while in the Big Mass (Europe, Africa, and Asia), the coherence decreased as spatial scale decreased. Viral species metacommunities associated with bats was dominated by random structures along all spatial scales. We suggest that this random pattern is a result of the presence of viruses with high occupancy range such as rabies (73%) and coronavirus (27%), that disrupt such structures. At viral family scale, viral metacommunities associated with bats showed coherent structures, with the emergence of Quasi-Clementsian and Checkerboard structures. RDA analysis indicates that the assemblage of viral diversity associated with rodents and bats responds to phylogenetic and functional characteristics, which alternate between spatial scales. Several of these variations could be subject to the spatial scale, in spite of this, we could identify patterns at macro ecological scale. The application of metacommunity theory at symbiont scales is particularly useful for large-scale ecological analysis. Understanding the rules of host-virus association can be useful to take better decisions in epidemiological surveillance, control and even predictions of viral distribution and dissemination.",

            "text": "However, species distributions are influenced by the spatial and temporal contexts in which they occur, thus, neutral theory and niche theory should be tested across a different scale of analysis. There is evidence for the influence of different abiotic factors like temperature and elevation that can determine the organized distribution of species diversity, depending on the spatial scale studied (Rahbek and Graves 2001) . The differences in species distributions between scales depend on three factors: physical barriers, the ability to co-occur, and their ability to disperse (Chase and Myers 2011) . The diversity of symbionts has not been excluded from this type of analysis (Guernier et al. 2004) . A large body of evidence suggest that the distribution of symbionts, defined as all organisms that must infect or inhabit hosts for at least part of their life cycle (Mihaljevic 2012) , also responds to environmental filters determined by their hosts (Morand and Krasnov 2010 , Mihaljevic 2012 , Dallas and Presley 2014 . Host phylogeny can act as an environmental filter to symbionts communites due to their interaction in the evolutionary history, co-adaptation and ecosystem process in the community (Streicker et al. 2010 , Krasnov et al. 2014 , C\u00f3rdova-Tapia and Zambrano 2015 . Similarly, the host functional characteristics can play a role as an environmental filter due to shared life histories or by spillover events Pedersen 2008, Morand and Krasnov 2010) .",

            "text": "We used viral communities associated with rodents and bats to analyse the effect of environmental filters. Rodents and bats are the most diverse orders of mammals thus they constitute suitable model taxa to explore the viral diversity providing relevant information to understand the dynamics of virus-host distribution (Lorencio 2007) . These taxa have been recognized as the main reservoirs of a high number of zoonotic viruses, some of them with an enormous impact in public and animal health (Luis et al. 2013 (Luis et al. , 2015 . Besides the individual approach, the study of the association between Viral metacommunities associated to bats and rodents at different spatial scales F. Nieto-Rabiela 1 , G. Suz\u00e1n 1 , A. Wiratsudakul 2 and O. Rico-Ch\u00e1vez 1,3 host and virus requires a clear understanding of the ecological context of infection and transmission be required (Woolhouse 2001 , Suz\u00e1n et al. 2015 , Johnson et al. 2016 . Because the host-virus system is intimately embedded within the communities, it is possible to recognize the existence of an organization in the distribution of viral diversity and later recognize the filters that allow or not to associate with a host (Suz\u00e1n et al. 2015) . The dispersion of a virus within a host community is accomplished through transmission events and may depend on the viral richness present in the community, so it is common to have multi-pathogen systems that can be considered as metacommunity (Suz\u00e1n et al. 2015) . Metacommunity theory implemented in viral communities at different spatial scales in combination with a redundancy analysis allows identifying the factors that facilitate virus distribution among hosts (Mihaljevic 2012 , Dallas and Presley 2014 , Suz\u00e1n et al. 2015 . Based on the metacommunity structures proposed by Leibold and Mikkelson (2002) , and mechanisms for infection and prevalence proposed by Suzan et al. (2015) , we can expect Random, Checkerboard and Clemenstian viral structures. A widespread distribution of abundant reservoir species are related with random structures while a limited viral distribution or a high viral specificity are related with Checkerboard or Clementsian structures (Suz\u00e1n et al. 2015) . The factors that shape viral communities and their distribution through their host at different spatial scales have not been studied. To measure the influence of the host phylogeny and functional characteristics of the host on viral community structure we hypothesized that both the expression of Clementsian structures based on the Niche Theory would prevail at different macroecological scales, and the host phylogeny will explain the viral metacommunity distribution as response of the shared host evolutionary histories and ecological relationships. We analyzed the contribution of phylogenetic and functional factors to the structure of viral metacommunities associated with rodents and bats. In our model, the viral community is defined as all viruses detected in each host species inside the geographic scale to analyze. In this analysis, the metacommunities are composed by viral communities linked by processes of dispersion and transmission between hosts.",

The registered information was collected from years 1956 to 2015 and only studies with molecular techniques were considered. The geographic location was registered and classified into four spatial scales ( Afrotropical, Indomalayan and Australian (Cox 2001) 3) Zoogeographical scale: Nearctic, Panamian, Neotropical, Palearctic, Afrotropical, Oriental, Saharo-Arabian, Sino-Japaness, Madagascan and Australian (Holt et al. 2013) . 4) Regional scales: North American, Mexican, Panamian, South American, Amazonian, Palearctic, African, Guine-Congolian, Madagascan, Indomalayan, Oriental, Saharo-Arabian, Sino-Japaness, Novozelandic, and Australian (Holt et al. 2013 ).",

To evaluate the metacommunity structure of virus-host species form each matrix, we measure three properties. The coherence as the degree to which pattern can be collapsed into a single dimension, turnover counting the number of species replacements along the matrix and boundary cumpling measuring how the edges of species boundaries are distributed along this dimension (Leibold and Mikkelson 2002) .

We include the body mass, litter size, number of litters per year and trophic guild, as host functional characteristics that may explain variation among hosts in viral community composition and their influence on the viral transmission. The variables were obtained from PanTHERIA database (Jones et al. 2009 ), Animal Diversity Web (http://animaldiversity.org) and Encyclopedia of Life (http://eol.org/). A redundant analysis of canonical ordination (RDA) has been performed to detect the relationship between the host phylogenetic component and host functional characteristics in the metacommunities from each spatial scale to obtain the explaining percentage on each one of detected metacommunity structures.

For example, in the American Continent the coherence increases as the geographic scale decreases, as shown in regional scales. Contrarily, in the Big Mass an opposite pattern was found; the coherence decrease with a decreasing geographic scale (Fig. 2) . In the American continent these pat- terns may be explaining by the high influence of the latitudinal gradient on the host distribution and by the island biogeography and the edge effect because the American Continent has a higher border surface (Lovejoy et al. 1986 ). Instead, the Big Mass surface allows a homogeneous host distribution (Buckley et al. 2010) . At the Big Mass scale there are not strict physical barriers between bioregions and viruses are widely shared at the edges, mainly at the Palearctic-Afrotropical edge. These boundaries merged many years ago, forming a large area that allowed this exchange of viral diversity, so they are now arbitrary limits (Morand and Krasnov 2010) . Therefore, it was possible to detect a Clementsian structure in the Big Mass metacommunity, but when the spatial scale decreased we observed a dominance of Random structures. At smaller communities, the characteristics of the host species are more widely shared without delimiting niches, and therefore the viral distribution depends on its capacity of dispersion rather than local filters.",

Meanwhile, the host migration between African and Guineo-Congolian Regions could be possible, explaining the decreases of coherence and the random structures detected in these two regions.",

In spite of random spatial structures, host-virus relationships can still be highly specific, suggesting coevolution between hosts and viruses (Drexler et al. 2010) including coronaviruses (CoV, however our framework addressed to community scale cannot measure these events. Even so, the rules of community assembly are not a law, and they are only one of several mechanisms that alternate, so it proposes the predominance of Clements superorganism at macroecological level (Jaisson 2000) . Thus, the study of such viral community assembly rules must be deepened to understand these processes. Clarifying the influence of these environmental host filters, enables us to address the effect of differential study efforts and also to plan surveillance systems and responds to situations like emergent diseases. To understand and predict viral transmission dynamics it is important to identify those variables that explain viral distribution through their hosts. If the viral distribution is explained by the phylogenetic component we will be able to predict new hosts based on the phylogenetic similarity. Instead, if viral distribution is explained by the functional component we could predict new hosts based on functional traits similarity. We must not forget that multiple factors interact and affect the direction of changes in viral metacommunities so that their dynamism must be monitored and understood by multidisciplinary approaches.",

Unfortunately, the present data set is insufficient to analyze the virus assemblages of small regions like the Australian and Madagascan due to the scarcity of data. Our data set is also likely to be biased because synanthropic species and viruses of public health relevance were sampled heavily, and this likely interferes with the influence of natural structures. However, at the macroecological level, viral metacommunities associated with Rodentia and Chiropterans showed Clementsian structures or at least tended to them (quasi-Clementsians). The viral metacommunities mainly respond to spatial abiotic constraints, and secondarily to host environmental filters, which offer us an approach for the understanding of these clusters that explain a part of the set.",
