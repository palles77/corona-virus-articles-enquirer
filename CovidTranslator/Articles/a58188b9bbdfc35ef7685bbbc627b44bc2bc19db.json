The affected animals, aged 2 months to 7 years, had a clinical history of intestinal symptoms, including diarrhoea or vomiting, or both. They exhibited variable histological changes in the epithelium of the small intestine, ranging from degeneration of single cells and detachment of groups of cells from the villous tips to regenerative processes of the crypt epithelia. Post-mortem diagnosis was based on the immunohistochemical demonstration of coronavirus antigen within intestinal epithelial cells and on the electron microscopical demonstration of coronavirus particles in the faeces. In addition, one animal was immunohistochemically positive for antigens of feline leukaemia virus (FeLV) and exhibited intestinal changes consistent with FeLVassociated enteritis. Two cats were tested serologically for feline immunodeficiency antibodies, with negative results. The findings indicate that natural coronavirus infection is a potential cause of severe enteritis in juvenile and adult cats.",

At the villous tips, fusion of adjacent epithelial cells as well as separation and sloughing of epithelial cells from the underlying basement membrane occur, the latter resulting in villous retraction. Focal fusion of adjacent villi is also observed. Regenerative processes are represented by deepening of crypts in some areas and covering of denuded villous tips by immature epithelium. Mild focal inflammatory reactions were observed by Pedersen \u00ab< a/. (1981a) and Pedersen (1987a) . Expression of coronavirus antigen, demonstrated by immunofluorescence, was restricted to mature columnar epithelial cells and single monocytic cells in the mesenteric lymph node (Pedersen et al, 1981a) . In recovered cats, a few small foci of infected epithelial cells were often detected in small intestine and caecum (Pedersen, 1983 (Pedersen, , 1987a . McKeirnan et al. (1981) isolated cytopathogenic coronavirus from the mesenteric lymph nodes and intestinal washings of a cat that had died with clinical signs of intermittent haemorrhagic diarrhoea and exhibited histological changes compatible with feline parvovirus infection. Dea et al. (1982) demonstrated coronavirus particles by electron microscopy in the diarrhoeic faeces of a cat which subsequently died. Hayashi et al.

The indirect peroxidase and the peroxidase anti-peroxidase (PAP) tests were made as described previously (Sternberger et ai, 1971; Kovacevic et al., 1997) . Briefly, sections were dewaxed in xylene and rehydrated through graded alcohols. Endogenous peroxidase was blocked by incubation with hydrogen peroxide 0-3% in methanol at room temperature for 30 min. Sections were washed with Tris-buffered saline (TBS; 0-lM Tris-HCl, NaCl 0-8%, pH 7-6) and treated with \"target unmasking fluid\" (TUF; Dianova GmbH, Hamburg, Germany) for 10 min at 96\u00b0C. Rat serum 10% (or for FeLV antigen demonstration, swine serum 50%) in TBS was applied for 10 min at room temperature before treatment with the primary antibodies. Specimens were then incubated for 12 to 16 h at 4\u00b0C with the following primary antisera: To demonstrate antigens other than those of FeLV, rat anti-mouse IgG (Dianova; 1 in 100 in TBS) and mouse PAP complex (Dianova; 1 in 500 in TBS) were applied. FeLV antigens were detected by incubation with peroxidase-labelled rabbit anti-mouse IgG (Dako Diagnostika GmbH, Hamburg, Germany; 1 in 100 in TBS). Between each 30-min incubation step, slides were washed with TBS. Sections were incubated for 10 min with 3,3'-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (DAB; Serva, Heidelberg, Germany) 0-05% in 0-lM buffered imidazole/HCl (pH 7-1) and counterstained with Papanicolaou's haematoxylin (E.

Like previous reports of single cases of natural coronavirus enteritis in cats (McKeirnan et al., 1981; Dea et al., 1982; Hayashi et al., 1982) , it contrasts with experimental studies, in which severe enteritis and intestinal changes could be induced only in 6week-old kittens (Pedersen et al., 1981a, b) . Jejunal lesions (degeneration and sloughing of villous-tip epithelial cells) were consistently observed. Two cats exhibited signs of epithelial regeneration (hyperplasia of crypt epithelia). In one cat, enteroblasts were present; this animal was the only one with a presumptive diagnosis of feline panleukopenia. The histological changes observed in our cases resembled those previously reported in a 6-week-old kitten which developed severe enteritis 3 days after the oral administration of a cellfree ileal extract from an FECV-infected cat; in that report, deepened crypts and immature epithelium at the villous tips were interpreted as signs of regeneration (Pedersen et al., 1981b; Pedersen, 1987a) . Identical changes, however, can be induced even in older cats by some FIPV strains (Hayashi et al., 1982; Stoddart etai, 1988) . Hayashi et al. (1982) described slight shortening of villi, oedema in the lamina propria, and infiltration of neutrophils and mononuclear cells, within 24 h of intragastric infection of kittens with a liver emulsion from an FlPV-infected cat (Yayoi strain). From day 3 post-infection (pi) onwards, changes consistent with those described for coronavirus enteritis (Pedersen et al., 1981b) were observed, and regenerative processes first occurred on day 5. Animals that died on day 5 or 6 pi exhibited severe erosion, haemorrhage and inflammation of the lamina propria. From day 0-5 to day 12 pi, FIPV antigen-positive enterocytes were detected by immunofluorescence. All animals had diarrhoea. Stoddart et al. (1988) orally infected five 9-monthold cats with the \"Wellcome\" strain, cultured on a feline embryonic lung cell line. Animals were killed at days 1, 2, 3, 7 or 14 pi without having developed diarrhoea. Intestinal changes (blunting and fusion of villi in the distal small intestine) were seen only at day 14 pi, in an animal in which FIPV antigen was restricted to the caecum and colon; cats killed from days 1-7 pi showed viral antigen in addition in the small intestine. In contrast, we found coronavirus antigen-positive cells in the jejunum of all animals, but the colonic epithelium was negative in the one cat in which it was examined.",

Parvovirus infection was excluded immunohistochemically in all cases. Cats without enteritis showed no positive reaction for coronavirus antigen, but those with enteritis showed coronavirus antigen-positive cells at the villous tips or detached from the villi. Furthermore, the cat with distinct regenerative changes exhibited a positive reaction in flattened and hypertrophic crypt epithehal cells as well as in enteroblasts, indicating that immature intestinal epithelial cells can be infected by coronaviruses. These results differed from those of a previous study in cats experimentally infected with FECV, in which coronavirus antigen was demonstrated only in mature columnar epithelia (Pedersen et al, 1981b (Pedersen et al, , 1984 Pedersen, 1983) . However, Hoshino and Scott (1980a, b) demonstrated in specific pathogen-free kittens infected with FIPV that coronavirus replicates in the cytoplasm of villous epithelial cells. Three cats examined in the present study had shown diarrhoea lasting for 3 to 6 months. Bearing in mind the relatively short period in which coronavirus antigen was detectable after experimental FIPV infection (Hayashi et al., 1982; Stoddart et al., 1988) , the question arises as to whether the diarrhoea in the present study was due to a persistent coronavirus infection of intestinal epithelia.",

The precise genetic basis for the differences in virulence between FIPV and FECV is not yet known (Vennema et al., 1995; Poland et ai, 1996) . However, the demonstration of closely related FECV and FIPV strains in the same geographical region or cattery, together with the greater genetic differences that appear to result from geographical and temporal separation, suggests that FIPV arises from FECV and that the two viruses do not arise from separate lineages (Vennema et al., 1995) . FIPV mutants have been isolated from FIVpositive cats with FIP that had been experimentally infected with FECV (Poland et al., 1996) , and, moreover, coronaviruses have a high degree of inherent mutability (Horzinek et ai, 1995) . It would seem possible that FIPV represents the outcome of continuous mutation from FECV (Pedersen et ai, 1981b; Pedersen, 1995) .",

The widespread distribution of coronavirus infection in cat populations may lead to the sporadic occurrence of enteritis (Addie and Jarrett, 1992) . As the immunohistochemical results showed, coronavirus antigen is almost exclusively confined to epithelial cells at, or detached from, the villous tips. This limits immunohistochemical diagnosis of coronavirus enteritis to carcasses that are fresh enough to be free of abundant post-mortem sloughing of intestinal epithelial cells at the villous tips.",
