Indeed, hosts have developed effective strategies to achieve this goal. The ideal scenario would be that the peptide epitopes stimulate a broad spectrum of CTL responses with diversified T-cell receptor (TCR) usage (the TCR repertoire). It is believed that a diversified TCR repertoire requires a \"featured\" peptide to be presented by the host major histocompatibility complex (MHC). A featured peptide can be processed and presented in a number of ways. Here, using the X-ray diffraction method, the crystal structures of an antigenic peptide derived from rinderpest virus presented by bovine MHC class I N*01801 (BoLA-A11) have been solved, and two distinct conformations of the presented peptide are clearly displayed. A detailed analysis of the structure and comparative sequences revealed that the polymorphic amino acid isoleucine 73 (Ile73) is extremely flexible, allowing the MHC groove to adopt different conformations to accommodate the rinderpest virus peptide. This makes the peptide more featured by exposing different amino acids for T-cell recognition. The crystal structures also demonstrated that the N*01801 molecule has an unusually large A pocket, resulting in the special conformation of the P1 residue at the N terminus of the peptide. We propose that this strategy of host peptide presentation might be beneficial for creating a diversified TCR repertoire, which is important for a moreeffective CTL response.",

In the past several decades, rinderpest virus (RPV) (23, 40), foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) (7), and bovine tuberculosis infection (62) have brought disastrous consequences, including social panic and even a threat to human health. Nearly 6 decades ago, most countries were committed to developing more-effective vaccines (46), and remarkable achievements were made in controlling threatening bovine viral infectious diseases and other zoonoses (23, 46). In the 1960s, British virologist Walter Plowright developed a live attenuated vaccine against rinderpest virus, which was widely used in rinderpest eradication efforts (40). However, it still remains extremely challenging for humans to completely eradicate a virus. The questions of how the bovine attenuated vaccine induces immune responses and how the viral peptides are presented and recognized by host immune molecules are still largely unanswered. Therefore, studies on bovine immunity against the rinderpest virus may provide clues for our battle against other viral infections.",

MHC class I (MHC I) molecules form a heterotrimer complex composed of the heavy chain of MHC, the antigenic peptide, and \u2424 2 -microglobulin (\u2424 2 m). Generally, MHC I loads endogenous peptides, including the virus-derived peptides. Briefly, at the initial stage of virus infection, antigenic proteins are processed in a proteasome-dependent or -independent manner. The resultant short peptides are then transported to the endoplasmic reticulum and are loaded onto the peptidebinding grooves of MHC I molecules. Consequently, the peptide-loading MHC I complexes are translocated to the cell surface and are recognized by cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) with specific T-cell receptors (TCRs) (49, 63). This immune recognition induces an MHC-restricted CD8 \u03e9 T-cell response that is characterized by the killing and elimination of the infected cells by effector T cells.

            "text": "Based on structural studies, the antigenicity of a peptide is partially dependent on the characteristics of the peptide related to its presentation by MHC molecules (31, 33, 34, 53, 55) . Generally, peptides are divided into featured, featureless, and bulged peptides according to their presentation properties (25, 57) . Featured peptides are those with solvent-exposed, prominent side chains or harmonious bulged conformations, which always correspond to a diverse repertoire of TCRs (32, 37, 38, 58) . In contrast, featureless peptides have fewer or no solventexposed residues with prominent side chains. Bulged peptides are usually long peptides (\u03fe12 amino acids) that contain an extreme bend in the middle of the peptide chain binding to the MHC I molecule. The structural landscapes of featureless and bulged peptides result in an immune T-cell repertoire of limited diversity (58) (59) (60) . Therefore, investigation of the structural characteristics of a peptide presented by MHC I molecules can improve the understanding of the antigenicity of that peptide and aid in the rational development and modification of peptide-based vaccines (33) .",

In the 1970s, BoLA-I protein was first identified and genotyped by use of a specific serum antibody. BoLA-I was first cloned in 1988 (20) , and since then, BoLA-I related research has entered the gene era. Thus far, hundreds of BoLA-I cDNA sequences have been registered at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/), and 58 complete BoLA-A sequences have been uploaded to the Immuno Polymorphism Database (IPD) (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ipd/) (5) . BoLA is located on the 23rd bovine chromosome (22) , including at least six expressed gene loci (29) . Further research has demonstrated that there are one to three gene loci that can be transcribed and expressed in one BoLA haplotype (16, 17) . The fact that a breed of BoLA haplotypes expresses only one BoLA-A gene locus (6, 15) provides an important experimental model for controlling bovine viral diseases in cattle with a single MHC I gene locus.",

            "text": "Due to polymorphisms in BoLA-I, there are more than 50 serotypes of one BoLA-I allele locus (4, 13) . The BoLA-A11 serotype specifically indicates that the BoLA-A11/pBoLA-19 (D18.3) gene product N*01801 is expressed (18, 28, 47, 48) . Hegde and colleagues obtained the N*01801 peptide binding motif by monoclonal antibody purification of MHC molecules and subsequent acid elution of peptides (28) . The majority of the peptides that occupied the binding groove of N*01801 were nonamers. There was clear evidence that position 2 of the peptides was occupied by Pro, and the C-terminal amino acid anchor was Ile/Val. Among the alleles whose motifs have been reported, the peptide motif of N*01801 is similar to those of H-2L d , HLA-B7, HLA-B*3501, HLA-B*5101, HLA-B*5102, HLA-B*5103, HLA-B*7801, and HLA-Cw*0401 (21, 45) . Sequence comparison of the bovine MHC I allele N*01801 to these MHC I molecules demonstrates that key residues share similar characteristics (and are conserved in some cases), which are involved in accommodating the similar anchor residues in P2 and P9. This was the first report of a BoLA allelespecific peptide motif (ASPM; 28). To identify bovine-restricted CTL epitopes derived from pathogens, according to N*01801 ASPMs, dozens of potential bovine CTL epitopes have been synthesized, and their antigenicity was preliminarily analyzed by CTL assays (27) . In 2004, one of the CTL epitopes with a typical N*01801 ASPM (peptide IPA) was identified in rinderpest virus hemagglutinin (H) protein amino acids 408 to 416 (IPAYGVLTI) (51) . Recently, Guzman et al. confirmed that there is an MHC-restricted CD8 \u03e9 T-cell response after FMDV infection (26) . However, the mechanism of bovine antiviral-specific T-cell immunity remains unclear, partially due to the lack of clues as to the binding and presentation of the antigenic peptides by BoLA-I.",

A series of bovine MHC I allele N*01801-restricted CD8 \u03e9 T-cell epitopes derived from different pathogens have recently been screened and characterized (14, 27, 51) ; from these epitopes, the peptide motif of this MHC I molecule was defined. However, no rapid and efficient methods to evaluate the ability of a peptide with a given motif to bind to bovine MHC I molecules in vitro have been developed yet. As indicated in previous studies (31) (32) (33) 55) , the refolding experiments can semiquantitatively reflect the binding capability of peptides for MHCs. Four previously identified N*01801-restricted CD8 \u03e9 T-cell epitopes (Table 1) were synthesized and used in refolding assays to evaluate their abilities to bind to N*01801 molecules and to define the candidates used for determination of the N*01801 structure. These four N*01801-restricted peptides helped the heavy chain of N*01801 and bovine \u2424 2 m refold in vitro, as evidenced by the absorbance peaks of the complexes (Fig. 1 ). All four peptides contain a proline at position P2, while the Pc (C terminus of the peptide) positions were occupied by either isoleucine or valine.

The overall structure of N*01801 consists of the characteristic \u24231 and \u24232 domains of a heavy chain underpinned by \u24233 domains and \u2424 2 m ( Fig. 2A) . The peptide lies along the peptide binding groove formed by the \u24231 and \u24232 domains (Fig. 2B) . Within one asymmetric unit, there are two N*01801 molecules (referred to below as molecule 1 and molecule 2) that have similar overall conformations, with a root mean square difference (RMSD) of 0.300 \u00c5 (0.267 and 0.137 \u00c5 for the heavy chain and \u2424 2 m, respectively) ( . Among all human MHC I molecules, HLA-B*5101 is sequentially the most similar to N*01801, displaying 80.29% identity (Fig. 3) .

This may indicate that the structure of the peptide loaded in the groove formed by the \u24231 and \u24232 domains of N*01801 was not affected by the substitution of the \u2424 2 m subunit. In the consideration of a higher resolution of N*01801-M\u2424 (with murine \u2424 2 m), we use this structure together with the structure of N*01801 (with bovine \u2424 2 m) to analyze peptide presentation by bovine MHC I.",

The B factors of the peptides in molecule 1 and N*01801-M\u2424 are 39.1 and 25.2, respectively, indicating the structural accuracy of these two distinct conformations. The structure of N*01801-M\u2424 has a higher resolution (1.9 \u00c5) than that of N*01801. Thus, we describe only the differences between the peptide conformations of molecule 1 and N*01801-M\u2424 in detail here. The residues at both ends of the peptides (Ile1, Pro2, and Ala3 at the N terminus and Thr8 and Ile9 at the C terminus) remain the same. In contrast, the major differences between the two peptides occur in the central region (Tyr4, Gly5, Val6, and Leu7) of the peptides (Fig. 5D) . Within the groove of molecule 1, the main chain of IPA-M1 turns sharply into the floor of the groove at the P5 (Gly5) position and then rises at P6 (Val6). In position P7, the C\u2423 of Leu7 again falls into the binding groove, while Thr8 in position P8 lifts upward. The tortuous main chain of the peptide presents a \"double-M\" conformation, which we believe to be unique among the MHC I structures solved thus far. Gly5 and Leu7 of IPA-M1 are located deep in the groove of molecule 1 as two secondary anchor residues. Conversely, the side chain of Val6 is solvent exposed and may function in TCR docking. However, IPA-M1 and IPA-M\u2424 display a totally different conformation in this region. The main chain of the peptide falls only once in the middle, with the side chain of Val6 protruding into the groove of the \u24231\u24232 \"bed\" as a secondary anchor in the M-shaped peptide. The M-shaped conformation of IPA-M\u2424 is more common among the structures of mammalian MHC I molecules (12, 35) .",

Superposition of all of the residues making up the peptide binding groove of molecule 1 and N*01801-M\u2424 shows that only Ile73 in the \u24231-helix of the heavy chain differs (Fig. 5E) . In molecule 1, the side chain of Ile73 points up into the solvent and leaves enough space for the raised conformation of the P6 valine in IPA-M1. Inversely, the side chain of Ile73 in N*01801-M\u2424 protrudes toward the \u24232-helix and occupies the space above the middle region of IPA-M\u2424. In this sense, the distinct conformations of Ile73 may contribute to the two different presentation conformations of the IPA peptide. Indeed, residues at position 73 that locate in the flanking side of the peptide binding groove are a key factor for the peptide conformation in other MHC I molecules (11, 34) . For different MHC molecules, residues have diverse polymorphism in position 73 (Fig. 3) . Therefore, the residues in this position have different impacts on peptide presentation. In a recently solved structure of the bovine MHC I N*01301 molecule, peptide Tp1 214-224 displays an unusual bulged C-terminal conformation, which is affected by Trp73 beneath the peptide (34) . Another factor may also influence the flexibility of the IPA peptide. Both of the bovine MHCs possess E97 in the bottom of the peptide binding groove. While the secondary anchor residue of K5 of Tp1 214-224 forms a stable salt bridge with E97 (34), IPA does not interact with E97 due to the hydrophobicity of the middle residues of the peptide (Gly5, Val6, and Leu7). Thus, the lack of a salt bridge may partially contribute to the flexibility of IPA.",

            "text": "Different exposed areas and buried residues formed by the two IPA conformations. The two distinct conformations of IPA in the two molecules of the asymmetric unit of the bovine MHC I N*01801 structures may contribute to the exposure of different surfaces of the peptides to the solvent (Fig. 6) . With the \"double-M\" conformation, IPA-M1 protrudes from the side chains of all of the even-numbered residues (Tyr4, Val6, and Thr8) of the C-terminal portion of the peptide (P3 to P9), which conspicuously presents their side chains for potential TCR docking (Fig. 6A) . The side chain of Ile73 protrudes into the solvent, leaving enough space for the exposure of the middle region of IPA-M1 (Fig. 6C) . Calculation of the accessible areas shows that the exposed surface of the three residues occupies most (87.7%) of the total exposed area of IPA-M1. The odd-numbered residues in this portion of the peptide (Ala3, Gly5, Leu7, and Ile9) bury themselves deeply into the groove. In the structure of N*01801-M\u2424, P4 Tyr, P7 Leu, and P8 Thr are the most prominent residues and are likely important for TCR interaction (Fig. 6B ). The exposed surface of these three residues (Tyr4, Leu7, and Thr8) accounts for 81.0% of the total exposed surface of IPA-M\u2424 (Fig. 6D ). In addition, the main chains of P5 Gly and P6 Val also partially contribute to the exposed area of IPA-M\u2424. However, the side chain of Ile73 extends over the middle region of IPA-M\u2424, which may affect the direct docking of the TCR to the main chain of P5 Gly and P6 Val. These distinct characteristics of the exposed area of the peptide presented by N*01801 may be involved in recognition by a greater range of the TCR repertoire. Figure 7A shows the C\u2423 backbone of IPA-M1 with other MHC I-presented nonameric peptides (excluding the 13-mer peptide presented by N*01301). Compared to the nonamer presented by HLA-B*5101, the main chain of the N-terminal portion (P1 to P4) of the peptide IPA has a similar conformation. In P5 of the nonamer, valine acts as a secondary anchor residue with its side chain inserted deep into the groove of HLA-B*5101. In N*01801, P5 is a glycine and thus lacks a side chain. However, the highly buried area of Gly5 indicates that this residue also acts as a secondary anchor for the peptide N*01801. Together with Leu7, whose side chain protrudes into the E pocket of the groove, we can conclude that peptide IPA contains two secondary anchor residues including Gly5 in the C-terminal portion of the IPA-M1 peptide (P4 to Pc). This \"double-M\" conformation is seldom observed among the nonameric peptides presented by MHC I molecules. The IPA-M2 (Fig. 7B) and IPA-M\u2424 (Fig. 7C) peptides have similar \"M-shaped\" conformations, which are common among peptides presented by other MHC molecules. The peptides within other MHC grooves possess either the M-shaped conformation with one secondary anchor residue (HLA-B*5101, HLA-A*0201, Mamu-A*01, and H-2K b ) or a bulged conformation without any secondary anchor in the P5-to-Pc region (for HLA-A*2402 and N*01301).",

Scrutinizing the available MHC I structures, we found that the main chain of the nonameric peptide presented by H-2K b is also buried deep in the groove. However, as shown in Fig. 7A , the C\u2423 atoms of the most exposed residues (Tyr4 and Val6) of IPA-M1 are still below the C\u2423 of P5 of the nonamer presented by H-2K b . In the other conformation of peptide IPA (IPA-M1 and IPA-M\u2424), the entire peptide is also located deep in the groove (Fig. 7B and C). Moreover, the highest C\u2423 atom in the backbone of the peptide is still lower than the C\u2423 atom of P5 of the nonamer presented by H-2K b .

The P1 Ile of the peptide is located in the A pocket and points its side chain out of the groove. Considering MHC I molecules from different species (Fig. 3) , Gly167 of N*01801 is rare among all of the MHC I molecules (i.e., it is found only in certain alleles, such as HLA-A*2402). In the N*01801 structure, the A pocket has the small residue Gly in position 167, making the space in the A pocket larger ( Fig. 8B and C) , which is also seen in the structure of HLA-A*2402 (Fig. 8D) (32) . The side chain of Ile1 of the IPA-M1 peptide in molecule 1 points toward the N terminus (or toward the right side if observed from the \u24232 domain of the MHC). The different conformation of the side chain of Ile1 in molecule 2 compared to molecule 1 reveals the flexibility of Ile1 in the N*01801 structure (Fig. 5A, B, and D) , which reflects the large space of the A pocket. The most common residue at position 167 in other MHC alleles (in human, monkey, mouse, chicken, and bovine BoLA-A18) is Trp (Fig. 3) , which forms the right side of the A pocket (observed from the \u24232 domain of the MHC). Trp167 of these MHC I alleles reduces the size of the A on March 19, 2020 by guest http://jvi.asm.org/ pocket and acts as a wall to prevent the side chain of the P1 residue of the peptide from pointing toward the N terminus ( Fig. 8B and E) . Further, this characteristic of the N*01801 A pocket may influence the recognition of the P1 residue by TCRs (61) . The structure of N*01801 (Fig. 6 ) reveals Pro2 as a primary anchor residue fitted into a small B pocket surrounded by Ile66, Tyr67, and Tyr8. These residues are similar to the corresponding residues (Ile66, Phe67, and Tyr8) of HLA-B*5101 (Fig. 3) , which also accommodates Pro (or other small residues, such as Gly or Ala) as the P2 anchor. Structural comparison of these residues demonstrated very similar conformations, with an RMSD of 0.099 \u00c5. This may lead to the common preference of N*01801 and HLA-B*5101 for Pro as the P2 anchor. In the F pocket of N*01801, the peptide Ile9 is surrounded by hydrophobic amino acids: Ala81, Tyr84, Phe95, Phe116, and Try147 ( Fig. 6 ; see also Fig. S1 in the supplemental material). However, the space in the F pocket is larger than the side chain of Ile9, which indicates that the F pocket may be able to accommodate larger residues. Aside from small aliphatic residues (e.g., Val, Ile, and Leu), in previous studies on the peptide motif of N*01801, aromatic residues (e.g., Tyr) were also defined as the C-terminal residues of N*01801-re-stricted peptides. The structure of N*01801 complexed with IPA clearly confirmed the peptide motifs of N*01801 that were defined by pool sequencing of eluted peptides in previous reports (14, 27, 51) .",

Additionally, we also determined the structure of N*01801 complexed with the same peptide but with murine \u2424 2 m instead of bovine \u2424 2 m. Interspecies \u2424 2 m replacement of MHC complexes has been widely exploited in structural studies of MHC molecules. The \u2424 2 m does not directly interact with the peptide and has no observable effect on peptide binding and presentation (1, 10, 43, 50) . Here, the peptide binding grooves formed by the N*01801 \u24231\u24232 domains were similar in the two structures determined (Fig. 4) . The interspecies structure may also veritably reflect the peptide binding of N*01801 (at a higher resolution) in addition to the structure of N*01801 complexed with bovine \u2424 2 m.",

Proline is found almost exclusively at the P2 position of these peptides, and as shown in the N*01801 structure, the relatively small, bowl-shaped, hydrophobic B pocket perfectly accommodates a proline at this position. The B pocket of N*01801 is formed by residues similar to those in the B pocket of HLA-B*5101, which may explain the same preference for proline as the prevalent anchor residue in the P2 position. In the C-terminal position of the IPA peptide, isoleucine and valine act as the primary anchor residues, inserting into the hydrophobic F pocket of N*01801, as indicated in the structure of N*01801 and the refolding assays. The space within the F pocket appears larger than the side chain of isoleucine, which may indicate that larger hydrophobic and even aromatic side chains can be accommodated. This is coincident with the peptide motif studies of N*01801, which indicated that Ile/Val and a small proportion of Leu/Tyr occupied the C termini of the naturally processed peptides of N*01801 (28) .",

Recent studies have also demonstrated that even minor modification of an epitope can lead to a profound effect on the antigenicity of the peptide (37, 58) . Peptides with a relatively rigid conformation may result in limited types of TCR docking, leading to a specific T-cell repertoire with limited diversity. Recently, this has been thoroughly investigated by Macdonald and colleagues in structural and function studies of bovine MHC I N*01301 (34) . Hence, a peptide with a flexible structure presented in the binding groove of an MHC molecule may lead to a diverse TCR profile. In a number of reported cases, a broader T-cell repertoire for the pathogenspecific epitope may facilitate a more effective host immune response against the invading pathogen and may prevent the emergence of immune escape mutants (39, 44, 52) . The IPA peptide in our structure unexpectedly appears to be presented by N*01801 in two distinct conformations. The completely different exposed areas in the middle of the peptide may indicate different manners of TCR docking. Further study should focus on whether the two distinct conformations of the IPA peptide correspond to different T-cell repertoires. The contribution of the uncommon peptide presentation strategy of N*01801 to the CTL-specific responses of N*01801 \u03e9 cattle to pathogens also needs further exploration.",

First, epitopes with characteristic long side chain residues, which are solvent exposed, may act as featured peptides to elicit diverse T-cell repertoires (58) . Second, moderately bulged peptides help the short side chains rise to a suitable level for TCR docking (32) . In the structure of bovine MHC I N*01801 complexed with IPA, N*01801 presents the same peptide in two distinct conformations, which is associated with the flexibility of Ile73 in the peptide binding groove. Different exposed residues and secondary anchor residues result from these conformational changes. This adjustable strategy of host antigen presentation may represent a novel type of featured peptide and may expand our understanding of the crucial role of T-cell epitopes in antipathogen immunity.",
