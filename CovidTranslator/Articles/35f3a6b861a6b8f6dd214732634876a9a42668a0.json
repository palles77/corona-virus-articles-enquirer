            "text": "During May 2016, we collected swabs (from nasal, urogenital, and rectal areas) and blood samples from camels at two locations in Jordan. Two camel herds were identified to study (1) a traditional bedouin camel herd, in which camels are allowed to graze and browse freely (Azraq, Zarqa) and (2) a more conventional mixed farm setting, where camels were kept in pens on one farm (Ramtha) (Fig. 1A) . In Ramtha, blood samples from adult sheep and cattle were additionally collected. Swab samples were collected in virus transport medium. RNA was extracted from samples using the QiaAmp Viral RNA kit (Qiagen). Five microliters of RNA was used in a one-step real-time RT-PCR UpE assay for MERS-CoV using the Rotor-Gene\u00d4 probe kit (Qiagen). Positive samples (cycle threshold [Ct] < 37) were tested using the ORF1A assay (Corman et al. 2012) , and samples were excluded from further analysis when ORF1A testing was negative. cDNA was synthesized using random hexamer and used to PCR amplify the MERS-CoV spike S2 domain (nucleotides 23781-24395 of HCoV-EMC/2012) as described previously (Smits et al. 2015) . Sequences were assembled on SeqMan Pro and analyzed on MegAlign (DNASTAR). Phylogenetic trees of the S2 domain were generated using Mega 6.0.6 with the maximum likelihood statistical method based on the GTR+G+I model with 1000 bootstraps replicates. Sera were analyzed by MERS-CoV spike protein (S) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA); Maxisorp (Nunc) plates were coated overnight with S1 protein (Sino Biological) and blocked with 1% milk. Sera (400\u00b7 dilution) were added to the plate in duplicate. MERS-CoV S1specific antibodies were detected using anti-llama (Agrisera), anti-bovine, or anti-sheep ( Jackson) IgG (H&L) HRP-conjugated antibody on development with peroxidasesubstrate reagent (KPL); optical density (OD) was measured at 405 nm. The threshold of positivity was mean OD + 10\u00b7 standard deviation of negative sera obtained from camels raised in captivity in the United States.",

            "text": "To better assess the potential significance of ELISA values as a correlate of MERS-CoV susceptibility, we calculated the ratio of the ELISA value of each sample to that obtained from an included camel reference serum on each plate in the assay. By this approach, we show that camels <3 years old exhibited an average ELISA ratio of 0.5-0.65, whereas older animals exhibited an average ELISA ratio of 1.63. This difference was significant as tested via a twotailed Mann-Whitney test (Fig. 1D) . Spike S2 partial domain sequences were obtained from 16/28 samples (accession numbers KX443663-KX443678). We were unable to obtain sequences of 12 positive samples with a lower viral load (Ct >33). We performed phylogenetic analysis with a selection of MERS-CoV S2 sequences using representatives of known clades, as performed previously (Smits et al. 2015) . The phylogenetic analysis of the partial S2 sequences placed the novel Jordanian viruses within the B1 cluster representing contemporary camel and human MERS-CoVs. Three sequences were identical to spike S2 sequences of human isolates of MERS-CoV obtained in Jordan in 2015 (Lamers et al. 2016 ). Twelve samples differed by two synonymous mutations (C23837T, T24074G), whereas the remaining samples contained a mixture of 24074T and 24074G combined with 23837T. Importantly, all novel sequences were found in cluster B1, containing the most recent MERS-CoV sequences originating from camel and human viruses (Fig. 2) . Thus, the circulating MERS-CoV strains in the Jordan dromedary camel population are closely related to virus strains known to be capable of zoonotic transmission and to cause disease in the human population.

            "text": "We observed shedding of MERS-CoV in the presence of antibodies, which suggests either reinfection of seropositive animals or shedding of virus/viral RNA during early stages of seroconversion. Previously, a lack of correlation was observed between virus/viral RNA shedding and the presence of neutralizing antibodies; these data highlight the potential for reinfection of seropositive animals (Farag et al. 2015) . The ELISA ratio might be a better predictor of MERS-CoV susceptibility than seropositivity; 24/29 animals with an ELISA ratio of <1.1 were MERS-CoV positive, whereas only 4/16 animals with an ELISA ratio of \u2021 1.1 were positive for viral RNA in nasal swabs. In contrast, 20/34 seropositive dromedary camels were MERS-CoV viral RNA positive versus all (8/8) seronegative dromedary camels. This might indicate that sterile immunity is only reached at high levels of antibody titers, in line with a previous study conducted in the United Arab Emirates (Meyer et al. 2016) .",
