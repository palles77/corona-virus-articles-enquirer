Avian coronavirus). Five pooled tissue suspensions of 50 layer birds and one reference Massachusetts vaccine strain were inoculated into specific pathogen free (SPF) chicken egg for isolation of IBV. Reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was carried out using post inoculated allontoic fluid to amplify the spike (S) glycoprotein of S1 subunit of IBV. All the eggs inoculated with five pooled tissue samples and vaccine sample showed dwarfing and curling of SPF embryos indicative of IBV. All the five samples and the vaccine sample produced the expected amplicons of 466 bp by RT-PCR. The sequencing of five isolates revealed that all the five sequences were 99.09-100 % similar among themselves and showed 99.10-100 % nucleotide identity with the vaccine strain. On multiple sequence alignment it was found that our isolates were more similar at S1 subunit nucleotide level with the reference Ma5 and H120 vaccine strains than the reference Mass41 strain. The sequences of Anand isolates revealed further genetic changes in the circulating IBV in comparison to previous isolate of Gujarat as well as higher differences with the strains isolated in other states showing substantial changes at genetic level in Indian IBV isolates, which may partially explain the increasing incidences of IB in the country in spite of the vaccination.",

Recently, different IBV variants have emerged causing nephropathogenic and reproductive problems which demands a dramatic change in vaccination programmes [17] . IB vaccine has been produced by passage of the virus in embryonated eggs. The main barriers to producing recombinant vaccines against IBV appear to be reproduction of the conformationally dependent epitopes on the spike glycoprotein that induces neutralizing antibodies and a protective local immune response in the upper respiratory tract of the bird [8] .",

There is no detailed information available on the genetic makeup of any of the IBV strains used in the commercial vaccines. Since the IBV vaccines or the vaccine strains used in Indian poultry population are usually imported from abroad, it is always advisable to use an indigenous IBV vaccine strain as the immuno-prophylactic agent against prevailing field strains. Isolation of IBV by passaging the tissue samples in embryonated SPF eggs is a simple method. Dwarfing and curling signs were suggestive of presence of IBV [3, 16] .

The deduced amino acid sequences of Anand isolates and vaccine virus were also aligned using the ClustalW programme. The amino acid sequences of the Anand isolates and vaccine virus showed no variation. Multiple amino acid sequence alignment revealed that all the strains under comparison had similar amino acid sequences except the reference vaccine virus strain Mass41, which showed I (isoleucine) and S (serine) at position 246 and 379, while all the other strains including Anand isolates showed T (threonine) and L (leucine) at the same positions. This again substantiates the earlier observation that our isolates were more similar to the reference vaccine strains Ma5 and H120 than Mass41 strain. The nucleotide/aminoacid differences between IBV Anand isolates and other reported sequences were based on the Clustal Alignment of the Nucleotide sequences of S1 subunit fragment of Anand isolates, vaccine strain and reference strains as mentioned in Table 3 . The three reference vaccine strains i.e. Ma 5, H120 and Mass41 showed SNVs at positions 708, 1143 and 1146 with 'C', 'T' and 'A' respectively, while the Anand isolates including the vaccine strain showed 'T', 'C' and 'G' at the same positions. Mass41 (AY851295) showed additional seven SNVs at positions 737, 846, 861, 1017, 1104, 1119 and 1136 with T, T, T, C, T, T, and C nucleotide respectively, while all other strains showed C, A, C, T, C, C and T at the respective positions. Thus, Mass41 strain showed maximum variation of ten nucleotides at different positions, which also showed the least percent nucleotide identity with our isolates. This indicates that our isolates were more similar at S1 subunit nucleotide level with the reference Ma5 and H120 vaccine strains than the reference Mass41 strain (Table 3) .",

However, the Anand isolates were of genetic distance with the Arkansas and Connecticut reference strains, which grouped into cluster IV. Nephropathogenic reference isolates also formed well defined separate clusters II and III with nucleotide identity of 63.27-69.59 and 77.59-87.05 % respectively with Anand isolates. Grouping of Anand isolates in a separate cluster I at a genetic distance with the nephropathogenic strains further indicate the fast emergence of variants in IBV. The Anand isolates showed similarities in the range of 77.59-78.08 % with earlier reported isolate of Gujarat and 78.64-79.19 % with the Tamil Nadu (India/NMK/72/IVRI/10) isolate. The sequence of Gujarat IBV isolate was reported in the year 2009 and the lower similarity as observed in the current study indicates further genetic changes in the circulating IBV in Gujarat, which may partially explain the increasing incidences of IB in the country in spite of the vaccination programme.",

The results of present study revealed that different strain variants of IBV may be circulating among chicken populations in India and recent outbreaks of nephropathogenic IB were due to this reason. The finding of IBV strains in field samples and its crucial genetic distance with other reported IBV isolates demands a continuous scientific effort in the country to monitor and characterize the circulating IBV so as to get rid off this important disease menace faced by poultry population.
