            "text": "Tropical sprue is a primary malabsorption syndrome affecting residents of and visitors to several tropical regions [15, 27] . Patients usually present with a history of chronic diarrhoea and on investigation are found to have malabsorption of a variety of nutrients and consequent multiple nutritional deficiencies. The aetiology of tropical sprue is not known, but the basic lesion is persistent damage to enterocytes, probably in the stem cell compartment [26] . The enterocytes and colonocytes are a single layer of epithelial cells, separating the external environment in the lumen of the gastrointestinal tract from the internal environment of the body. They act as the first pass organ for a variety of substances, nutrients, drugs, ingested toxins etc., and are in intimate contact with the luminal contents of the gastrointestinal tract, especially unabsorbed food residue and the resident microbial flora [6, 7, 13, 34] . The enterocytes turn over rapidly with a short half life. The intestinal mucosa also has a large population of immunocytes, as well as cells specialised in antigen sampling, the 'M' cells [43] . The complex organization of this primary barrier suggests that a variety of factors may compromise its integrity. The diet and the flora of the intestinal lumen in tropical residents are different compared to residents of temperate zones and there are several gastrointestinal diseases, including tropical sprue, which are more prevalent in tropical climates [28] . Are there any identifiable structural or functional differences between the gastrointestinal mucosa of healthy residents of tropical and temperate regions?",

Increase in the thickness of the crypt (stem cell) layer with accelerated cell turnover, an increase in epithelial lymphocytes and lamina propria mononuclear cells and enterocyte abnormalities on ultrastructural examination characterised these morphological alterations [24] . The changes were not confined to the small intestine, ultrastructural abnormalities being present also in colonocytes [23] . Intestinal absorption tests in a stratified random sample of the rural population in southern India showed that up to 40 % of asymptomatic adults had D-xylose malabsorption, 10% mild steatorrhoea ad about 3 % vitamin B12 malabsorption [3] . The faecal wet weight was high and there was an increased loss of nutrient energy and nitrogen in the faeces [8] . This combination of morphological and functional alterations in the intestine of apparently healthy residents of several tropical regions has been termed \"Tropical enteropathy\" [3] .",

Expatriates from temperate climates to tropics developed this change in about 3 months of residence and the pattern reverted to the temperate zone \"normal\" about 1 year after return [20] . Residents of tropical countries who migrate to temperate zone countries gradually assume the temperate zone mucosal pattern over a period of 3 to 5 years [21] . The foetal intestine in southern India is morphologically identical to that in temperate climates and the changes of tropical enteropathy only appear within 2-12 weeks of birth [11] . In animal experiments, it has been shown that contact with luminal contents is essential for the development of the lesion and that isolation of loops of bowel in Thiry-Vella fistulae prevent or revert the changes [10] . The morphological changes involved not only the epithelium but also structural changes in the lamina propria, including immunocytes [37, 39] . Tropical enteropathy, therefore, is an adaptive change of the intestinal mucosa to a variety of luminal factors and is the background on which gut pathology develops in residents of many tropical countries [36] .",

Both adults and children are affected, although the latter appear to be less susceptible [31] . In the marginally nourished population of rural southern India, where access to medical facilities is limited, the epidemics were associated with a high mortality, although with symptomatic therapy for control of diarrhoea, correction of dehydration and nutritional supplementation, spontaneous remissions are possible. In southern India, therapy with antibiotics on folic acid did not appear to be curative [2] , in contrast to results of such therapy in patients in the Caribbean or in expatriates from the temperate zones [14, 17] . These differences in the response to therapy in addition to epidemiological and clinical differences suggested that tropical sprue is a 'syndrome' of possibly multiple aetiology in which damage to enterocytes manifests as chronic diarrhoea and malabsorption [27] .",

This lesion in the stem cell compartment has been found as early as 48 h from the onset of diarrhoea in patients affected in epidemics of tropical sprne.

Mitotic counts were also increased indicating a more rapid turnover of enterocytes. It was not possible to differentiate between turnover of different populations of stem cells, damaged or apparently normal, in these studies. These changes may be due to the primary agent responsible for tropical sprue in southern India itself altering the cell turnover. The lesion responsible for this may be morphologically occult in the stem cell compartment and may manifest only in the villi. Alternatively, the increased cell turnover may only be a response to the loss of damaged cells from the functional compartment, the villi.",

Both serum-and cell-mediated changes in immune parameters should ideally be evaluated in enteric diseases but the difficulties of adequate sampling of gut mucosa and the necessity for including appropriate controls have been limiting factors. Many of the earlier reports of serum immunoglobulin changes in tropical sprue were on a limited number of patients, for a few parameters and, when controls were studied, they included only healthy controls. The results obtained were not sufficient to decide whether immunological changes were primary events in the pathogenesis or were secondary to structural or functional changes in the intestine. Appropriate controls for a group of tropical sprue patients should include two groups, healthy asymptomatic individuals and patients with other gastrointestinal illnesses with no malabsorption. While both the control groups would have tropical enteropathy, the latter group may also indicate immunological changes which are primarily related to altered gut structure or function without malabsorption.",

Serum immunoglobulins, functional antibodies to enterobacterial common antigens and rotavirus, autoantibodies, complement, orosomucoid, peripheral blood lymphocyte estimation and blast transformation were tested. Intraepithelial lymphocytes were quantitated and the presence of functional secreted antibodies tested in jejunal luminal fluid. Serum concentration of IgG, IgE, complement C4 and orosomucoid were significantly different, the prevalence of gastric parietal cell antibodies was significantly higher and peripheral blood lymphopaenia was present, in patients with tropical sprue. While all these differences were significant when compared to the group of normal volunteers, none of these were significantly different from the group of control subjects with gastrointestinal illnesses without malabsorption. The parameters were also not significantly different between the two groups of controls. This suggested that abnormalities in the integrity of the gastrointestinal barrier can give rise to non-specific changes in serum immunological parameters and that none of the observed changes were likely to be either causal or secondary to tropical sprue. The only exception to this was significantly elevated epithelial lymphocyte (EL) counts in the jejunal mucosal biopsies of the tropical sprue patients.",

The EL were focally distributed in the upper crypt and crypt-villous interphase and were often adjacent to severely damaged enterocytes. In patients affected in an epidemic of tropical sprue, while enterocyte damage was visible at electron microscopic examination as early as 48 h from the onset of diarrhoea, EL changes were only detectable 3 weeks later. The presence of activated EL suggests a local cell-mediated immune reaction but the sequence of appearance of EL suggests that this is secondary to enterocyte damage.",
