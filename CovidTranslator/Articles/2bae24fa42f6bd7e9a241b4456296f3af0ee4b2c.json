The damage caused by the disease and our treatments for the patients often leave them physically and cognitively debilitated. Generally, GBMs appear after very short clinical histories and are discovered by imaging (using magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]), and the diagnosis is validated by pathology, following surgical resection. The treatment response and diagnosis of tumor recurrence are also tracked by MRI, but there are numerous problems encountered with these monitoring modalities, such as ambiguous interpretation and forms of pseudoprogression. Diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive biomarkers would be an immense boon in following treatment schemes and in determining recurrence, which often requires an invasive intracranial biopsy to verify imaging data. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are stable, membrane-enclosed, virussized particles released from either the cell surface or from endosomal pathways that lead to the systemic release of EVs into accessible biofluids, such as serum/plasma, urine, cerebrospinal fluid, and saliva. EVs carry a wide variety of proteins, nucleic acids, lipids, and other metabolites, with many common features but with enough individuality to be able to identify the cell of origin of the vesicles. These components, if properly interrogated, could allow for the identification of tumor-derived EVs in biofluids, indicating tumor progression, relapse, or treatment failure. That knowledge would allow clinicians to continue with treatment regimens that were actually effective or to change course if the therapies were failing. Here, we review the features of GBM EVs, in terms of EV content and activities that may lead to the use of EVs as serially accessible biomarkers for diagnosis and treatment response in neuro-oncology.",

Neurosurgical resection of GBMs has failed to offer patients with a curative option as even radiological imaging with contrast enhancement of disease inadequately correlates with actual neoplastic disease burden ( Figure 1A) . Thus, gross total resection, using the radiological image of the apparent tumor margins, fails to address the microinfiltrative disease beyond the borders of the radiological depiction (which can be identified upon histological representation). 6\u22128 Histologic characterization of GBMs commonly shows small areas of central necrosis, with a distinct pseudopalisading rim of anaplastic glial cells and a hyperplastic, hyperpermeable vasculature, which differentiates these tumors from lower-grade astrocytomas ( Figure 1B and C) . Examination of the pseudopalisading network of neoplastic glial cells is remarkable for disease heterogeneity. The neoplastic heterogeneity observed in GBM poses significant challenges in disease treatment as well-known oncological therapeutics fail to target the entire disease burden and may actually select for inherently resistant neoplastic cells. 9\u221212 Further histological investigation of the brain parenchyma beyond the location of the radiographical depiction of the disease often reveals significant microinfiltrative tumor cells, which are thought to be a major contributor to the dismal prognosis of GBM. 6, 9 The inability to cure GBM via neurosurgical resection and the failure of our current therapeutics contribute to the urgent need for further GBM tumor characterization.",

Typically a biomarker refers to \"a characteristic that is objectively measured and evaluated as an indicator of normal biological processes, pathogenic processes, or pharmacologic responses to a therapeutic intervention.\" 22 This is a broad statement but encompasses most aspects. There are three recognized subcategories of biomarkers: 1) diagnostic markers that identify the presence of and specific type of disease; 2) prognostic markers used to imply outcomes independently of therapy; and 3) predictive markers that can inform in the context of particular treatment response. For gliomas, we currently know of nothing truly useful as an early-stage diagnostic biomarker as most GBMs present as full-blown tumors with little or no prior clinical evidence of their existence. 23 There are certain molecular features of GBMs that aid in and verify diagnoses, and some of those are also prognostic and may be predictive (study of this is ongoing). 24 The current line of thought in this area is that recurrent genetic abnormalities are able to subcategorize GBMs into groups, defined as Classical, Mesenychmal, Proneural, and Neural. 25 The main features of these designations are shown in Table 1 . The gene expression patterns and genomic alterations associated with the GBM categories may eventually lead to better therapeutic strategy design, but for now, the most disturbing correlation is that only patients with the Proneural subtype show any trend towards longer survival compared with patients in the other three categories. Nonetheless, that prolonged survival is not statistically significantly different compared with the other groups and in general, it is still less than 2 years postdiagnosis.",

Also, these techniques are extremely expensive, as is the entire brain tumor affliction. 28 Such imaging modalities generally offer little histologic or prognostic information without employing specialized technologies such as various forms of positron emission tomagraphy, vessel architectural imaging, or stimulated Raman scattering. Beyond that, the only acceptable diagnoses are made, intra-or postoperatively, by pathology, which offers prognostic evaluations using immunohistochemistry or genetic techniques. 29, 30 Obviously, those tests require tumor access from surgery or biopsy, both intracranially invasive procedures. This is especially true for recurrent tumors (which occur with nearly all patients with high-grade gliomas), where imaging distinctions for remnant tumor, regrowth, or postradiation necrosis are difficult, 31 and \"pseudoprogression\" (radiographic indications -usually, gadolinium enhancement -that appear as progressively growing tumor following radiation but later resolve or devolve into radiation necrosis) is another common problem. 32, 33 Tumor diagnostic/biomarker capabilities from an accessible compartment (blood/sera, urine, or saliva) would be a major advance for neuro-oncology, especially since there seem to be no circulating exfoliated brain tumor cells 34 (cerebral spinal fluid offers mixed results 35, 36 ). Thus, most biomarker efforts for GBM are geared towards the determination of recurrent disease, either in the context of standard of care treatment or in a clinical trial setting, with an emphasis on clinical-level assessments.",

However, some potential biomarker candidates have been proposed. The circulating nucleic acid content in the serum or plasma of GBM patients consists of both deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid (RNA) species and was summarized in a review by Holdhoff et al. 34 Briefly, the potential circulating tumor DNA biomarkers include methylated promoter regions of O-6-methyl-guanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT), cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A (p16), death-associated protein kinase 1 (DAPK), and Ras association (RalGDS/ AF-6) domain family member 1 (RASSF1A). Others have also shown methylation of promoter regions in MGMT and phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN); however, detection rates of these epigenetic changes were low in serum samples, or not detectable in the case of PTEN, compared with the astrocytic tumor samples. 41 Additionally, the authors analyzed the loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of chromosomes 10q, 19q, and 1p in oligodendroglial tumors and reported a higher percentage of LOH in the tumor tissue compared with the serum samples. Different RNA species have also been detected in the circulation. EGFRvIII message was detected in platelets isolated from glioma patients. 42 Circulating tumor microRNA (miRNA) has also been detected in the blood of GBM patients. 34, 43 In these studies, miRNA 21 (miR-21) and miRNA 128 (miR-128) were shown to be upregulated in the blood of GBM patients. The cohorts in these studies were relatively small, less than 20 patients at most, and an analysis for these molecules should be performed on a higher number of patients to provide more evidence of the use of these molecules as biomarkers. Additionally, it is unclear how small miRNAs are present in serum without some form of proteinaceous or membrane-enclosed protection. EVs may provide that protection.",

In those and other earlier studies 45, 46 it is unclear whether any controls were used for the fetal calf serum supplementing the cell culture medium as it is now known that the fetal bovine sera frequently used in cell culture contain extracellular vesicles. 47 Those vesicles may be cleared by centrifugation (ie, .100,000\u00d7 g) prior to inclusion of the sera in culture medium. We may have been the first to describe exosomes in brain tumor cell lines from both human and murine sources, 48 and our studies were soon followed by important publications from Al-Nedawi et al 49 and Skog et al. 50 The former demonstrated the presence of glioma-specific mutant EGFR variant III (EGFRvIII) in EVs from both cell lines transfected with the mutant construct and from EVs in the sera of mice growing those EGFRvIII-expressing tumors. Incubation of glioma cells that did not express the mutant receptor with EVs from cells that did express it showed the transfer of EGFRvIII to the nonexpressing cells, with the concomitant activation of tumor-promoting signaling pathways associated with EGFRvIII signaling (extracellular signal-regulated kinase [ERK]/protein kinase B [AKT] phosphorylation, VEGF release). The latter paper demonstrated the presence of mRNAs and miRNAs in the sera of patients with GBMs that may be of diagnostic utility. A major advantage of nucleic acid technologies in regard to EVs is that they have standard preparation/handling conditions, and one has the ability to amplify signals from small amounts of starting material, which is not possible with other biologics (eg, proteins and lipids). The paper also showed that there was a differential distribution of specific messenger (m)RNAs in EVs compared with the relative amounts in the cells of origin and that a model mRNA could be passaged from cell to cell by EVs, resulting in translation of the mRNA to protein in the recipient cells. Among the mRNAs found in at least some patient serum EVs, was that encoding EGFRvIII as a tumor-specific marker. Finally, the EVs had angiogenic-promoting activities in human brain microvascular endothelial cells.",

This involved paracrine signaling via tissue factor associated with EVs. Thus, exosomes/EVs can serve as transfer mechanisms for tumor survival and progression. 56, 57 Curiously, coagulopathies are part of the comorbidities associated with brain tumors, and tissue factor likely plays a significant part. While its presence on EVs is well known, the role of tissue factor in the context of EVs remains unclear 56, 58 and may represent an area into which therapeutic intervention can expand. 59 There have been some extremely interesting publications describing the role of EVs in the biology of GBM, but the attempts to find clear and utilizable biomarkers are at early stages, and the field faces the same (lack of) outcomes that have plagued the cancer biomarker field for years -ie, large numbers of putative biomarkers on input, few approved entities on output. 60, 61 The development of useful, robust, and clinically viable biomarkers follows a complex, multiphase pathway with harsh go/no-go decisions and is fraught with difficulties that involve biology, bioinformatics, and current plus developing (and currently unforeseen) biotechnologies. 62 However, as biomarkers are tied to clinical drug development platforms in the form of companion diagnostics, and as multiplexed systems may be necessary to validate drug efficacy, 63 EVs will likely play vital roles as reservoirs of multiple types of biologic materials suitable for biomarker assays.",

As EVs are present in (and purifiable from) essentially all routinely obtainable biofluids, a distinct advantage in this scenario is that EVs bundle multiple potential biomarkers in one package. Thus, multiplexed assays that evaluate more than one biomaterial (eg, RNA and protein) could theoretically be performed on the same sample. The concept of \"liquid biopsy\" is often applied to circulating tumor cells 64 and more recently to circulating cell-free (cf)-DNA, 65 but the numbers of circulating tumor cells are often low (or even nonexistent, in the cases of patients with GBM), and cf-DNA is largely nontumor in origin. EVs overcome these barriers in liquid biopsy -EVs are known to occur in elevated quantities in the blood of cancer patients, 66\u221268 and the protein and nucleic acid contents can be tumor-specific. 50, 51, 55, 69, 70 With this background, we will explore what is known and what may be possible concerning the use of EVs as biomarkers for GBM.",

Thus, EGFRvIII seems to be an excellent putative biomarker from a diagnostic perspective, and its loss of expression may be a predictive biomarker if the protein is directly targeted. 74 However, it is likely that evaluation of the protein status would be the most direct assessment, but access to antibody reagents is limited, resulting in the use of nucleic acid techniques for detection. 75 There remains concern over the lack of correlation between polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based detection of EGFRvIII and the actual protein expression levels, 71 so specificity and sensitivity issues may depend on the techniques employed. Gene amplification of EGFR is common in GBMs, as is overexpression of the protein (and with EGFRvIII expression in a subset of the EGFR-amplified tumors). 76 We 51 and others 49, 77 have identified EGFR in EVs from GBM cells and patient sera, but it also appears to be in EVs from healthy donors 51 and from nontumor cell lines, 78, 79 which begs the question of specificity. However, it may be a valuable biomarker tool as part of a multiparameter screening assay. 77 In a very limited study, we also identified EGFR2/v-erb-b2 avian erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog 2 (ErbB2)/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) as a relatively specific marker for EVs, from patients with medulloblastoma. 55 Perhaps 17% (or more) of GBMs probed express HER2, 80,81 so this protein may also be a useful biomarker, but it is unclear whether it is incorporated into EVs from healthy donors; much larger sample sizes are necessary to establish that correlation.",

Balaj et al found that EVs from different types of CNS tumors contained single-stranded DNA, and both complementary (c)DNA and genomic DNA as well as retrotransposable elements. 69 Redzic et al RNAs are packaged in glioma EVs. 83 miRNAs may be very useful sources of biomarker potential in GBMs, given the differences in the miRNA signature for healthy subjects and GBM patients. 83, 96, 97 Although the nucleic acid content of EVs is diverse, there are only a few potential biomarkers that have been suggested to date. As with the protein content of GBMderived EVs, the EGFRvIII mRNA is also one of the most specific and well-known markers that has been detected in EVs. In their work, Skog et al 50 purified EVs from the serum of GBM patients and detected EGFRvIII mRNA in 28% of samples tested using PCR-based methods. The percentage of EGFRvIII mRNA compared with total RNA in EVs is consistent with the percentage of GBM patients who are positive for this particular mutation, ie, about 30% of GBM patients have the EGFRvIII mutation. The detection of EGFRvIII RNA in glioma EVs was also reported by Nilsson et al, and they found that EVs are used to transfer the message to recipient cells. 42 The work of Chen et al is promising in its potential to use the detection of the IDH1 mutation in CSF as a biomarker, especially considering the sensitivity of this technique. 70 The authors used very sensitive PCR methods to detect and quantify wild-type and mutant IDH1 transcripts in EVs isolated from the CSF of glioma patients and found higher levels of mutant IDH1 in the CSF of patients with gliomas compared with healthy controls. The sensitivity of the technique is evident considering that IDH1 mutants are relatively rare in patients with GBM. 98 However, the source of material (CSF) is not a prime candidate for serial evaluation of biomarker status.",

Newer technologies, such as nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) with fluorescent (usually antibody) staining, allows for the specific quantification of labeled vesicles within the overall population of vesicles present, thus allowing for both the detection and enumeration of putative tumor or pathologic EVs in a mixed field of vesicles (eg, such as from serum 111 or from urine 112 ). Another use of antibody detection for both surface and internal EV content was mentioned previously, where using a microfluidic NMR chip, GBM EVs were labeled (or lysed and internal materials labeled) with targeted magnetic nanoparticles against a four-protein signature (EGFR, EGFRvIII, podoplanin [PDPN] , and IDH1 mutant). 77 This rendered the EVs superparamagnetic and yielded faster proton decay rates for enhanced NMR signal. While none of the markers individually had high sensitivity (but overall good specificity), the combination of the four markers resulted in both high sensitivity and specificity, and the ability to quantify EVs at several logs better than current technologies.

From a predictive perspective, one issue would be our lack of knowledge of the clearance or half-lives of such antibodies, so there may be more value in them from an initial diagnostic perspective.",

One could imagine a standard cell line assay, where EVs from patient body fluids were incubated with the model cell line, which was then lysed and assayed for specific (ie, limited) changes in phosphoprotein status indicative of tumor EV-driven phenotypic alterations. It is conceivable that EVs themselves could be lysed and exposed to phosphoantibody arrays that might reveal the presence of high levels of tumor-associated phosphoproteins. Other EV protein posttranslational modifications that may indicate tumor presence may include glycosylation (see above), ubiquitination, 124 citrullination, 125 acylation, 126 and other lipid modifications.

The presence of EVs in every biofluid allows for theoretically easy access in minimally or noninvasive fashion, and the assortment of biomolecules surely provides a signature for the presence of disease or of change in the disease state. In few cases are the components of that signature truly tumor-specific (in the cases of GBMs, perhaps EGFRvIII and IDH mutants are tumor-restricted). Thus, we may need to quantify potential (combinations of) biomarkers, and possibly their locations in or on EVs, to distinguish the signature as distinct from normal tissue EVs. That signature may be only readable through a translation via bioassays rather than by the direct identification of \"letters\" or \"words\" in the signature. There is a great need for biomarker development in neuro-oncology since our current imaging systems often fail to provide adequate information concerning recurrent tumor growth or current biological status of either the primary or recurrent tumor. This paucity of information tends to drive a fairly uniform treatment regimen for every patient and thus, fails to account for a personalized approach to monitoring disease and individual responses to therapy. It may be that these circulating \"fat balls\" can provide that window into the presence and status of the tumor that will give us a therapeutic edge in the treatment of these devastating diseases.",
