Detection of the virus by RT-PCR in clinical specimens offers the option of diagnosis in the early stage of the disease. In this outbreak, we developed several conventional and real-time quantitative PCR assays for SARS diagnosis [1,9 -11] . Quantitative analysis of viral RNA in NPA specimens indicated that the viral loads at the early disease onset are low and peak at day 10 of the illness [15] . The presence of low copy numbers of a viral genome in early clinical samples is a major limiting factor for achieving a sensitive molecular test for SARS diagnosis. Recently, we demonstrated that this problem could be overcome by increasing the volume of clinical samples for RNA extraction. By using a modified RNA extraction method and applying quantitative real-time RT-PCR technologies, 80% of specimens collected at days 1-3 of the onset were positive in RT-PCR assays [10] .",

In the case of H5N1, chickens were the immediate source of virus for humans [17] . The detection of SARS Cov-like viruses in small wild mammals found in live retail markets supplying the restaurant trade in Guangdong indicates how this virus may have crossed from its animal reservoir to humans. Surveillance of SARS Cov in animals is important for public health and may provide clues to understanding the interspecies transmission events relevant to the genesis of novel, emerging diseases.",
