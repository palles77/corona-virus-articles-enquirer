It has no homology with known proteins and its function in SARS CoV replication has not been determined. The N-terminal part of the 9b protein was used to raise polyclonal antibodies in rabbits, and these antibodies could detect 9b protein in infected cells. We analyzed the sub-cellular localization of recombinant 9b protein using fluorescence microscopy of live transfected cells and indirect immunofluorescence of transfected fixed cells. Our findings indicate that the 9b protein is exported outside of a cell nucleus and localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum. Our data also suggest that the 46-LRLGSQLSL-54 amino acid sequence of 9b functions as a nuclear export signal (NES).",

Next, a 196-bp fragment of the gene was amplified by PCR (primers are listed in the Table 1) , digested with EcoRI and XhoI and subcloned in frame with the glutathione-S-transferase (GST) gene in EcoRI and XhoI sites of the vector pGEX5X2 (Amersham Biosciences) to create pGEX-9bN. Expression of the recombinant GST-9b fusion protein in bacteria was induced in the presence of 0.1 mM isopropyl beta-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Proteins from the induced bacterial cultures were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and the GST-9b fusion protein was eluted from the gel by the \"crush and soak\" method (Sambrook et al., 1989) . This gel-purified protein was used to immunize New Zealand White rabbits in order to generate anti-9b serum. The generated rabbit polyclonal antibodies were used for detection of expression of ORF 9b gene in cultured cells infected with SARS CoV. Near-confluent monolayer of cultured Vero E6 cells was inoculated with SARS-CoV at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1 plaque forming units per cell. Forty-eight hours post infection the cells were harvested and lysed in 1% SDS. The expression of the 9b protein in African green monkey kidney cells of Vero E6 lineage (derivative of the ATCC line CCL-81) was demonstrated by Western blot analysis. Total proteins from infected cells were separated by 15% polyacrylamide SDS gel electrophoresis in Tris-Tricine buffer, immobilized on a nitrocellulose membrane and probed with polyclonal rabbit serum raised as described above against recombinant 9b protein ( Fig. 1) . A unique protein band was detected in the extracts from infected Vero E6 cells (Fig. 1, Panel B , lane 1) while such a band was not present in protein extracts from non-infected cells (Panel B, lane 2), which indicated that ORF 9b was expressed during SARS-CoV infection and could be detected by specific rabbit polyclonal antibodies. Using these antibodies, the protein of a similar electrophoretic mobility was detected in HEK 293 cells infected with recombinant adenovirus expressing the 9b protein ( Fig. 1 , Panel A, lane 1). Adenovirus expressing the 9b protein was constructed using AdenoEasy Ad5 homologous recombination kit (CLONTECH). The observed electrophoretic mobility of the protein extracted from the infected cells was between 10 and 15 kDa which is close to the 11 kDa calculated molecular weight of the 9b protein. To our knowledge, this is the first Western blot analysis of the 9b protein.",

It would be interesting to study the subcellular localization of the 9b protein in the SARS-CoV-infected cells using anti-9b antibodies for immunofluorescence. Unfortunately, anti-9b rabbit serum we developed in this study appeared to show a background cross-reactivity with proteins in uninfected cultured cells (data not shown), which made it unsuitable for conclusive demonstration of the cellular localization of the 9b in the SARS-CoV infected cells. Therefore, we examined cellular localization of recombinant 9b tagged with enhanced yellow-green variant of the Aequorea victoria green fluorescent protein (EYFP) protein or with FLAG epitope by fluorescence microscopy in transfected Vero E6 cells.",

Forty eight hours post transfection, the cellular distribution of the green fluorescence was examined using a ZEISS model Axiovert 200M microscope and photographed ( Fig. 2a and d) using a 520 nm filter. Cell nuclei were counter-stained with Hoechst 33342 (Sigma) (Fig. 2b and e) and the images of the same view fields were taken using a 370 nm filter. Comparison of the images and intensity of green fluorescence indicated that the 9b-EYFP fusion protein was distributed predominantly in the cytoplasm with the highest fluorescence intensity being observed in a perinuclear space, while the amount of the fusion protein in the nuclei of Vero E6 cells was substantially reduced (Fig. 2d-g) . In contrast, unmodified EYFP was distributed evenly throughout the cell, with slightly higher fluorescence in the nucleus of transfected Vero E6 cells (Fig. 2a-c) .

Second, we generated a mutant 9b in which codons for leuicine residues L46, L48, L52 and L54 were replaced by codons for glycine. In order to generate this mutant, a synthesis of the 297 bp ORF 9b gene with mutated codons was ordered from EZBiolab Inc.

Essentially, it was similar to the distribution of the green fluorescence in cells transfected with the pEYFP-N1 vector (Fig. 2a) . Similarly, the character of distribution of the green fluorescence in cells transfected with p9bDeltaNES-EYFP ( Fig. 3d-f ), repeated that of the cells transfected with pEYFP (Fig. 2a) . In addition, confocal microscopy of Vero E6 cells transfected with p9bDeltaNES-EYFP ( Fig. 3g-i) indicated that the alteration of the NES of the 9b aborted predominantly extranuclear localization of green fluorescence. Taken together, these data suggest that cytoplasmic localization of 9b results from its transport from the nucleus to the cytoplasm by interaction with exportin 1 via a leucine-rich NES.",
