As an example, two RT-RPA assays were established for the detection of hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N) genes of the novel avian influenza (H7N9) virus. Results: The sensitivities of the H7 and the N9 RT-RPA assays were 10 and 100 RNA molecules, respectively. The assays were performed at a single temperature (42 \u2022 C). The results were obtained within 2-7 min. The H7N9 RT-RPA assays did not show a cross-detection either of any other respiratory viruses affecting humans and/or birds or of the human or chicken genomes. All reagents were used, stored, and transported at ambient temperature, that is, cold chain independent. In addition, the Diagnostics-in-a-Suitcase was operated by a solar-powered battery. Conclusions: The developed assay protocol and mobile setup performed well. Moreover, it can be easily implemented to perform diagnoses at airports, quarantine stations, or farms for rapid on-site viral nucleic acid detection.",

All RT-RPA reagents and oligonucleotides can be stored at ambient temperature for up to 3 months.

Six samples can be tested at the same time, in addition to negative and positive controls. Kits for up to 98 samples can be stored in the DiaS. The DiaS storage box can be refilled whenever needed. Results are displayed as positive or negative on the screen of the tube scanner without the need of a laptop. Overall, nine pipetting steps are needed. Further improvements to reduce the pipetting steps could be to include lyophilized RPA primers and probe into the RPA pellet, to employ a multiplex RT-RPA assay, and to apply simple non-purification lysis.
