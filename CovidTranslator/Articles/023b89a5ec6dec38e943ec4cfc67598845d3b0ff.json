As an example, a random sample of seawater near Bermuda yielded DNA sequences never known before. The most accepted definition of an emerging and re-emerging infectious disease is \" a disease that has newly appeared in the population or has existed previously, but is rapidly increasing in incidence and geographic range. \" Another widely cited definition is a \" new emerging or drug resistant infection whose incidence in humans has increased within the last two decades, or whose incidence threatens to increase in the near future. \" Strictly speaking all infectious diseases have \" emerged \" at one time or another. Thus, the definitions are rather arbitrary. The emergence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Plasmodium falciparum as human pathogens probably occurred within the last few tens of thousands of years. Other pathogens required rather large human populations interacting closely so that human -human transmission would occur such as with measles and smallpox viruses. HIV probably made the jump to humans 60 -75 years ago. Emerging infections are further classified by others as newly emerging, re-emerging/resurging, and deliberately emerging. The factors involved in the process of emergence and re-emergence are extremely complex and have to do with the microbes themselves, the environment, and the hosts, a triad well known to any scientist who works in the field of infectious agents. The Convergence Model tries to explain all factors that affect the host -microbe interaction. This interaction is affected by interlocking domains, namely genetic and biologic factors, ecologic factors, physical environmental factors, and social, political and economic factors.",

            "text": "These viruses belong to the family Orthomyxoviridae and are enveloped, negative sense, single-stranded, segmented, RNA viruses responsible for recurrent epidemics of febrile respiratory disease every 1 -2 years. Influenza viruses are further classified as A, B, and C based on antigenic characteristics. Influenza B and C viruses only undergo antigenic drift as compared with influenza A viruses that can undergo antigenic shift in addition to antigenic drift. Antigenic shifts are responsible for the major pandemics seen with influenza A viruses, three of which occurred in the 20th century, including the highly lethal 1918/1919 pandemic that killed tens of millions of people around the world. Pandemics do not occur with influenza B and C viruses. In fact influenza C causes a mild disease without seasonality, and influenza B causes severe disease confined to the elderly and other persons at high risk. Influenza A viruses are divided into subtypes based on the presence of different hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N) molecules on their surface. Sixteen distinct hemagglutinins and nine different neuraminidases have been described to date. Influenza viruses are among the most contagious human viruses with attack rates of 10 -40% during epidemics. Epidemics are seasonal (winter) in temperate regions and can occur year round in tropical areas. Since the last influenza pandemic in 1968, the predominant virus circulating around the world is the H3N2 subtype that undergoes minor mutations in the H and N proteins and is responsible for yearly outbreaks. In 1977, the H1N1 virus (the same subtype that was responsible for the 1918 pandemic) was reintroduced and is currently co-circulating with H3N2 virus. However, isolated cases of human influenza due to avian viruses such as H5N1 are cause for concern among health professionals around the world because of the high lethality and the possibility that development of efficient person-to-person transmission could trigger another pandemic. The first case of human influenza due to H5N1 was described in 1997, and the infection re-emerged in Southeast Asia in 2004. Death rates in domestic birds in Southeast Asia are staggering. Other avian influenza viruses have also emerged in other parts of the world such as H7N7 in the Netherlands causing an outbreak of hemorrhagic conjunctivitis in humans. Influenza A viruses are capable of infecting a wide variety of animals including birds, horses, marine mammals, swine, and humans. The most important reservoir is wild aquatic birds (water fowl, ducks, and shorebirds). These animals can carry different subtypes in their gut, and some viruses are capable of infecting domestic poultry. The ability of avian influenza viruses to infect humans is rather restricted as is the ability for transmission from person-toperson. Because of their segmented genomes, influenza A viruses have the potential to swap or reassort genes when present in the same host or \" mixing vessel \" such as pigs (these animals have cell surface receptors that allow cellular entry of both bird and human influenza viruses). If the favorable environmental conditions are present, human influenza viruses can coexist with avian viruses in pigs, and new reassortants may be produced with potentially enhanced ability to infect humans. Clinically, the human disease manifests as a severe febrile illness with abrupt onset, myalgias, severe malaise, dry cough, arthralgias and nasal discharge. Most patients recover from the acute phase of the disease in 3 -5 days. Complications include primary influenza viral pneumonitis, which was first well documented in the 1957 -1958 pandemic. However, it is widely accepted that this and bacterial superinfections were the causes of death of millions of persons in the 1918 pandemic. These patients progress to acute respiratory failure rapidly, and the main pathologic finding is that of diffuse alveolar damage with a hemorrhagic component. Other complications include secondary bacterial pneumonias.",

However, tuberculosis did not become a major public health problem until the 17th and 18th centuries during the Industrial Revolution. Tuberculosis also ravaged (and still does) the native American populations after Columbus ' voyages to the Americas. In the United States, tuberculosis saw a steady decline in the middle part of the 20th century until 1985 when the incidence climbed again principally due to the appearance of HIV. Other factors included deterioration of living conditions, intravenous drug abuse, and underfunding of tuberculosis control programs. However, since the mid-1990s rates have declined and in 2002 reached the lowest incidence in history from the time statistics became available. This control is the result of better anti-HIV therapies, intensified diagnosis, aggressive and monitored anti-TB treatment and prevention efforts. However, not all is good news in infection and can account for up to 10% of acute upper respiratory tract infections in which another etiologic agent has not been identified.

At least 300 species of birds and 62 species of mosquitoes can be infected by WNV. Most susceptible birds are the Corvidae (blue jays and crows), and the most important mosquito in the enzootic cycle is Culex pipiens . Humans and horses are dead-end hosts, both developing febrile and/or encephalitic syndromes. Other forms of transmission are through transplanted organs, transfusion, and breast milk. In fact, blood testing by PCR is now a component of the screening process for donated blood.",

In humans two genotypes cause infection: bovine and human genotypes. The name Crysptosporidium hominis has been proposed for the human genotype. The first human case was described in 1976, and the first outbreak of cryptosporidiosis in the US was documented in 1987 in Carroll County, GA where an estimated 13,000 cases of gastroenteritis were diagnosed. The largest reported outbreak occurred in Milwaukee, WI where there were an estimated 403,000 cases in 1993. Cryptosporidium has been described throughout the world. Infection occurs via the fecal -oral route mostly by ingestion of contaminated water. The infectious thick walled oocysts are resistant to chlorination and survive in moist environments for long periods of time. The cycle is completed in the same host, and multiplication is both sexual and asexual. Once inside the host, Cryptosporidium organisms invade the microvillous surface of the epithelial cells in the terminal ileum and proximal colon leading to self-limited watery diarrhea in immunocompetent patients and chronic/persistent diarrhea in immunocompromised patients (especially with AIDS).",

Even when the pharmaceutical industry recognizes the market potential of a vaccine against an emerging pathogen, such as HIV or hepatitis C virus, there are many difficult steps between the desire to develop the vaccine and its availability for purchase. There are more steps from the discovery of a newly EID agent to the availability of a vaccine against it than for a pathogen that has been studied for decades or more than a century. First, the pathogen must be characterized at the levels of biology, molecular composition, and its genome. Even well into the contemporary molecular, proteomic, and genomic era, knowledge of the proteome and genetic sequence provides no more complete understanding of the agent than possession of an encyclopedia, which written in a language that has been translated only partly, would impart omniscience . Second, appropriate animal models that adequately mimic the pathology of the human disease, anatomic distribution of the agent, and the human immune response to the infection must be developed. There are numerous agents that are so highly adapted to humans that no adequate animal model exists. Other models utilize animal species that do not permit effective analysis of the protective immune response owing to lack of reagents to evaluate the immune cells and proteins and absence of animals that are genetically inbred or have knockout of specific genes. Third, studies of animal models and of humans and their cells, cytokines, and antibodies are employed to elucidate the mechanisms of protective immunity. Development of a vaccine that stimulates the presence of memory cells that generate the immune components required to kill the invading pathogen rapidly requires determining which elements (e.g., antibodies, CD4, and/or CD8 T lymphocytes) are critical. Fourth, the antigens of the particular infectious agent that stimulate the protective memory immune components must be identified. For subunit vaccines, some antigens stimulate protective responses, and others suppress protective immunity. Fifth, the animal models are utilized to develop and test vaccine candidates that stimulate protective memory immune responses without harmful side effects. At the point of the primary identification of the etiology of the emerging infection, it would be unlikely that any of these five steps would have been addressed.",

            "text": "Because many emerging infections are zoonotic diseases that have naturally occurring animal counterparts, a strategy of developing related veterinary vaccines on the pathway toward future development of a vaccine for humans may be feasible owing to financial and regulatory considerations. Imagine how much better off we would be today if an effective vaccine against a simian immunodeficiency virus had been produced in the 1970s or a changeable molecular cassette subunit vaccine had been approved for avian influenza viruses a decade ago. The crucial message regarding vaccines for emerging infections diseases is that it is never too early to support research to achieve the five steps outlined above .",
