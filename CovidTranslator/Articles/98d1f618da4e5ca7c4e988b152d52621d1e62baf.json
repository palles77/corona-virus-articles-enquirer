The more important mechanism is the functional immaturity of villus epithelial cells; the other involves a reduction in total absorptive area resulting from shortening and clumping of villi. Immature epithelial cells are generated in the crypts. These cells are 'secretory' in that there is a net flow of water and electrolytes from the extracellular fluid compartment (ECFC) to the lumen. Mature cells at the villus tips produce a net flow of water and electrolytes from the lumen to the ECFC. Virus infection of the mature epithelial cells leads to a premature shedding of these cells resulting in a migration of immature 'secretory' cells to the distal villi. Hence the expanded luminal contents of both water and electrolytes. Vomiting is thought to be mediated by the stimulation of vagal and sympathetic afferent nerves that are connected to the vomiting centre in the medulla oblongata. In viral diarrhea there are profuse watery stools containing increased concentrations of electrolytes. Characteristically leucocytes and erythrocytes are not seen. This stands in sharp contrast to feline, canine and mink parvovirus enteritis. These viruses cause an intense inflammatory change in the crypts and a hemorrhagic enteritis results. The pathogenesis of CMV enteritis, which may be bloody, is described later.",

Fever is generally ~< 38.5\u00b0C; vomiting, when present, is of shorter duration (~< 3 days) than diarrhea (3-7 days). Virus is shed in the stool for 3-7 days or more.

Rotavirus eventually became established as the leading worldwide cause of serious viral enteritis in infants and young children. Rotaviruses are non-enveloped, and have a double-stranded, segmented RNA genome (there are 11 segments). These segments code for the structural and non-structural viral proteins (VP). Thus, VP1, VP2, VP3 form the core of the virion; VP6 is the subgroup antigen and determines if the virus is subgroup A-F. All A subgroup strains have a common antigen. There are two neutralization antigens, namely VP4 and VP7. These antigens are expressed on the outer surface of the virion. There are 11 serotypes determined by VP7 (Sherlock et al., 1989) .",

Nosocomial infections may be a substantial problem in pediatric institutions. Waterborne outbreaks can occur. The virus is robust and is not readily inactivated in the environment. Fortsas et al. (1993) recently reported that enteric adenoviruses (Ad) are important agents of pediatric gastroenteritis. This group succeeded in producing a monoclonal antibody (MAb) which recognises a distinct epitope on protein VI. Their Ad MAb recognises an epitope shared by subgroup A (Ad 12, 18, 31) and subgroup F (Ad 40, 41) adenoviruses, but not representatives of subgroups B, C, D or E. Krajden et al. (1990) reviewed the clinical features of 127 cases of pediatric adenovirus enteritis. Serotyping results obtained by microneutralization tests and restriction endonuclease analysis were available in 105 of the 127 cases. Ad 40 and Ad 41 accounted for 56% of established serotypes. Ad 31 was associated with 17% of the 105 cases. This work establishes the primacy of adenovirus serotypes 31, 40 and 41 as a cause of enteritis. It furthermore reveals that these three serotypes rank second only to rotaviruses in causing viral diarrhea as witnessed in a tertiary care pediatric hospital in a temperate climate.",

Oral immune globulin, however, has been shown to ameliorate or prevent rotavirus infection in infants and neonates (Barnes et al., 1982) . Immunity to infection at a mucosal surface, whether it be respiratory or gastrointestinal, is generally short lived: Thus, throughout life we are infected by various respiratory viruses and viruses that are associated with enteric disease. It is in our middle years that enteric viruses have little impact. However, early in life and in our senior years these pathogens exact their toll. The status of rotavirus vaccines has recently been addressed by Kapikian and Chanock (1990) . Preventive measures like hand washing, pathogen-free water supply, patient isolation and breast feeding reduces the burden of disease from the various viruses associated with enteritis.",
