            "text": "Nowadays vaccination is considered the most economical strategy for handling various diseases, such as microbial infections, autoimmune relevant disorders, and even certain types of cancer [1] . Annually, millions of human lives are saved from lethal infections as a result of prompt immunization with vaccines, which are also playing roles in conquering other life-threatening diseases such as autoimmune disorders, allergic reactions. Notably, in the past years, some refractory cancers are also included in the scope of vaccination targets as they are subject to immunotherapy, which achieves great therapeutic effects in certain patients, thanks to advances made in immunology, biotechnology and relevant fields [2] . However, today there is still a long list of infections in urgent need of effective vaccines, which unfortunately, may not exist yet in at least a foreseeable future. The reason is that many microbial pathogens, such as HIV (human immunodeficiency virus), HCV (hepatitis C virus) and HSV (herpes simplex virus), are showing an elusive or ever-changing immunogenic feature on their appearance to continuously challenge the currently available vaccine strategies while dismantling a variety of potential arsenals. Meanwhile, some pathogens, such as Ebola virus and SARS virus (severe acute respiratory syndrome virus), may emerge abruptly in an uncertain place to make a ravage in people and then disappear before an effective strategy having been drawn up for the trial of battling them, leaving even no trace as a hint for developing an efficacious product able to tame them [3, 4] . Nevertheless, the past few decades have witnessed a range of lethal infectious pathogens, such as smallpox, HPV, HBV and VZV (varicella zoster virus), that have been, or nearly, conquered by the newly developed medications including, especially, vaccines [5, 6] . In particular, in the past few years immunotherapy has been established as a promising strategy in treating some refractory diseases, including certain lethal cancers, inherited disease, anaphylaxis, and disorders of autoimmunity, such as rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis and lupus, which, though are still torturing numerous patients, also wane in intensity and mortality due to the kind of vaccination treatment [7] .",

            "text": "Vaccination as well as immunotherapy acts to battle diseases through making use of host immune system, which can be activated by the antigenic components (called antigens) of disease-causing subjects (called pathogens) to set up immunity capable of erasing the pathogens bearing the identical antigens (Ags). These processes involved in immunity establishment present the principle for developing vaccines, which however can be made with different formulations and display diverse dosage forms. Conventional vaccines are made of whole microbes that have been inactivated or attenuated and usually possess a potent power to induce the Ag-specific immunoresponses in hosts, but they are also linked to safety issues resulted mainly from reversion of administered strain to virulent mutants, as supported by the outcomes of gene sequencing in the vaccinated sufferers [8] . Notably, in the past decades, great achievements in immunology, cell biology, as well as bioengineering technology allow rapid identification and purification of novel Ags. The refined Ags are capable of being formulated with definitive ingredients to constitute subunit vaccines that can elicit the immunity to accurately target the highly matched objects while maintaining an excellent safety profile. Thus, subunit vaccines are now more and more employed to fight various diseases, including not only infections but also intractable autoimmunity and malicious cancer [9] . Compared to classical vaccines, subunit vaccines possess many distinct benefits, such as high safety, needing no dangerous microorganisms in production; very few redundant components relevant to reactogenicity; diverse therapy scope including infections, autoimmunity and cancer; feasibility of engaging several peptide epitopes in one product targeting different subtypes or life cycle stages of a pathogen [10] . However, subunit vaccines just made of highly purified Ags are often showing poor immunogenicity and therefore can hardly induce effective immunoresponses in the absence of an adjuvant, a substance that, when included in the formulation, enables a vaccine to efficiently elicit the Ag-specific immunity with a high level and long duration ensuring a reliable anti-Ag protection [11] . Moreover, subunit vaccines lack most microbial constituents including, especially, those that are in fact the adjuvanticity-bearing substances conservatively displayed on microbe surfaces while manifesting certain distinctive structural features, defined as the pathogen/damage/danger-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs/DAMPs). PAMPs or DAMPs can strongly activate the innate immunoresponses through binding to and stimulate the corresponding pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), including mainly TLRs (Toll-like receptors), CLRs (C-type lectin receptors), RLRs (retinoic-acid-inducible gene-I-like receptor), NLRs (The nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptors), and the newly identified cGAS (cGMP-AMP synthase, a cytosolic DNA sensor [12] ). PRRs are, in response to detection of pathogenic microbes, evolutionarily expressed by immune cells, especially, the professional APCs (antigen presentation cells), including mainly DCs (dendritic cells) and MPs (macrophages). As such, due to lack of PAMPs/DAMPs subunit vaccines usually have a low capacity in activating the innate immune system, which is a precursor and sponsor responsible for initiating the adaptive immune system for setting up the anti-Ag immunity. Therefore, to conquer this drawback, subunit vaccines are often additionally combined with an adjuvant or incorporated in a carrier to enhance their immunostimulatory effects [13] . Notably, at present subunit vaccines are frequently constituted with various nanocarriers, such as liposomes, emulsions, cochleates, VLPs (virus-like particles), polymeric and inorganic nanoparticles (NPs), which can be further incorporated diversely with adjuvants or the adjuvanticity-bearing substances, such as different PRRas (PRR agonists), squalene, saponin as well as insoluble aluminium salts (alums), thus forming a vaccine adjuvant-delivery system (VADS) to enhance efficacy [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] . In fact, in as early as 1926, significant enhancement of efficacy of subunit vaccines, such as the one composed of diphtheria toxoid, was successfully achieved by Glenny and colleagues through precipitation of the Ag onto alum, which has ever since been widely adopted as an efficient strategy to improve vaccine effectiveness. As a result, alum has been employed as a classical VADS to produce various types of vaccines for clinical prophylaxis of a range of pathogens and today is still given to millions of people each year [19] .",

Among different categories of nanocarriers, liposomes since their discovery in 1960s [20] have fervently been exploited for constructing a DDS (drug delivery systems) or VADS owing to their many advantages, such as excellent biocompatibility, diverse loading mode, big loading capacity, easy preparation and surface modification to generate desired functions [21, 22] . Also, as a VADS, liposomes are suitable for making the vaccines that are adaptive to various administration routes, such as intramuscular and subcutaneous injection, oral uptake, intranasal and other topical ways [23] . Moreover, liposomes have long been confirmed of the intrinsic adjuvanticities and, unlike other adjuvants, have showed minimal reactogenicity, therefore rarely causing hypersensitivity-associated reactions in immunized subjects [24] [25] [26] . In addition, it is argued that liposomes can always play well the role of an adjuvant regardless of the Ag loading mode of being entrapped within, attached onto, or even simply admixed with the vesicles, thus greatly simplifying the product manufacturing procedure owing to omitting a tedious step of removing free Ags [27, 28] . Also, liposomes have been extensively explored to be combined with a variety of functional molecules, such as the ones bearing a PAMP/ DAMP feature able to binding to certain PRRs, and the ones matching the receptors expressed on APCs to facilitate APC uptake of vaccines [16, 17, [29] [30] [31] . Notably, after decades of development, several type of liposomes designed as a VADS have already been successfully employed to make vaccines that have been approved for clinical immunization against different infections, including even those that are caused by the most intractable pathogens, such as malaria and shingles [5] .",

By doing so, Jenner preliminarily laid the primary principle for developing modern vaccines, which contain antigens (Ags) and after administration will trigger host immune system to set up a defensive network against the Ag-exhibiting pathogens. The supportive basis under establishing this defence lies in that in vertebrates and higher organisms including human beings, the complex immune system is well formed by long time survival evolution under pressure from pathogens and thus, consisting of several orders of differentiated structures and compositions, including lymphoid organs and tissues, diverse immune cells, and various chemokines and cytokines, which orchestrate to engender protective immunity [33] .",

As one of the main defensive components, the immune system possesses the abilities to discern, from numerous contacting subjects, the abnormal pathogens as a detrimental factor to the body through interacting with the subjects' surface structures. These structures on pathogens are usually composed of glycoproteins and may show, depending on the type of species, certain unique conserved features falling just within the range of \"antigens\" or \"PAMPs/DAMPs\", which are evolutionarily \"defined\" by the host immune system as a result of the long term fights repeatedly occurred between the opposite sides of host and pathogens. Gradually, the immune system builds up the power of defence against the detrimental invaders, including various infectious microorganisms such as bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites, and even cancerous neoplasms arising from the body itself [32, 34] .",

Also, a fraction of the Ags (with the vaccine/pathogen) may traffic directly into draining lymph nodes (dLNs) wherein to be captured and endocytosed by the within APCs, including DCs, MPs and follicular B cells (FBCs). Then, the internalized Ags will be processed by APCs into smaller pieces including the epitopes (the antigenic determinants) that will be loaded onto MHC (major histocompatibility complex) molecules and then together displayed on cell surface for presentation to T lymphocytes which takes place within dLNs (Fig. 1 ). In the case of direct blood entrance caused by, e.g., injection vaccination, blood infusion contamination, external bleeding and insect bite, Ags are then rapidly filtered and captured by splenic APCs, also including mainly MPs, DCs and FBCs. Spleen has the anatomical organization of white pulp resembling that of the LNs, particularly with regard to the specialized compartments for B cell and T cell populations. As such, spleen and numerous LNs together present the main arenas where the innate and adaptive immunoresponses proceed to establish the anti-Ag immunity [37] .",

Both CTLs may migrate to circulation system and peripheral tissues and are able to recognize and bind via TCRs to the identical MHC-I-Ag epitopes presented on the encountered pathogen-hidden or diseased cells. The problematic cells targeted by CTLs are then induced to undergo a series of intracellular caspase cascade followed by apoptosis or lysis due to receiving the cytokines or chemicals such as perforin, granzyme, cytotoxin and granulysin secreted by the bound CTLs, leading to dumping of the pathogens for full eradication. MCTLs are responsible for providing the long-term protection to host, since they can survive for long time to lyse the emerging infected cells displaying MHC-I-Ag-epitopes identical to the initial triggers, thus erasing the relevant pathogens (Fig. 1) .",

Meanwhile, partial Ags are to traffic to dLNs wherein they may be captured by LN-resident DCs and MPs either for surface presentation to activate T cells or for transition to FDCs (follicular DCs). FDCs are able to retain Ags for long time in a non-degradative form for periodical display, allowing the Ags to bind to the highly diverse BCRs (B cell receptors). Otherwise, the Ags that have arrived in dLNs may directly enter the follicles where they will directly bind to BCRs (known as signal 1). Subsequently, the BCR-Ags are endocytosed and processed by follicular B cells (FBCs) for presentation as the MHC-II-Ag-epitopes, which, at the border of the T-cell zones and B cell follicles in LNs, are recognized and bound by TCRs of the differentiated Th2 cells (a process known as cognate T-B cell cooperation, signal 2). Meanwhile CD40 on B cells is bound for co-stimulation by CD40L (CD40 ligand) on the differentiated Th2 cells, which are thus fully activated to secrete cytokines (signal 3) such as IL-4, \u22125 and \u2212 10, triggering B cells to seed in germinal centers, differentiate and proliferate into plasma cells (including short-lived and long-lived plasma cells) as well as memory B cells (MBCs) [39] . Plasma cells are producing the Ag-specific Abs which are able to neutralize the pathogenetic subjects into non-infectious organisms prior to their settlement in the host ( Fig. 1 ) [40] . Notably, longterm production of Abs may be maintained by a combination of the short-lived plasma cells, which usually have a life of 3-5 days, and the long-lived plasma cells (PC), which acquire the long-living property through migrating to survival niches within the bone marrow ( Fig. 1 ), wherein they receive survival factors such as APRIL (a proliferationinducing ligand) and IL-6 and thus may exist even for the life-time of hosts depending partially on the stimulatory Ags. Alternatively, high levels of Abs may be rapidly produced as a result of prompt proliferation and differentiation of MBCs into the short-lived plasma cells upon re-encountering the identical Ags, which are usually carried by pathogens ( Fig. 1 ) [41] .",

Acquiring the competence after experience by host immune system in defeating pathogens annotates the basic concept of immunity and the main principles underlying vaccination, of which a deep understanding will undoubtedly accelerate the development of novel vaccines as well as a VADS to cope with the aggressive pathogens [32] . However, at present, though it is thought that vaccine or VADS design should aim at stimulating a robust response to generate a substantial number of effector cells, from which memory cell populations might be expected to arise, the best condition that can efficiently promote formation of memory immune cells remains still to be fully defined [44] .",

Usually, the live attenuated pathogen-based vaccines possess the capability to elicit robust and longlasting immunity in recipients, however, they also have the potential to cause detrimental infections in recipients, as a result of occurrence of the unpredictable mutation in the engineered organisms. For example, in recent years, immunization of oral polio vaccines consisting of the live attenuated polioviruses was astonishingly found by gene sequencing to be the cause for several pandemics of polio, due to the reversion of the vaccine strains to the neurovirulent and transmissible state of wild polioviruses [47] . By comparison, the vaccines made of inactivated microorganisms are relatively safe, but they stimulate rather weak and even target-deviated immunoresponses, as a result of both the inactivation process, which may alter the sequence of authentic Ags, and the comprehensive components, which are likely to induce the irrelevant immunoresponses and even trigger unwanted inflammations due to existence of reactogenicity [48] .",

The most frequently included adjuvant in human vaccines is alum (aluminium salt), which was first used as a vaccine adjuvant in the early 1920s by Glenny and colleagues, and is now still widely used in various vaccines against numerous infections, contributing greatly to human health [49, 50] . Though alum in vaccines may cause stimulatory inflammations giving rise to certain adverse effects after administration, it has in general the acceptable safety profile and possesses the abilities to enhance the efficacy of many vaccines against the corresponding pathogens. In fact, the mechanisms underlying the adjuvant actions that are not relevant to PRR stimulation remain mostly still an elusive secrete, full unveiling of which will, undoubtedly, pave the way to discovering novel adjuvants. At present, it is thought that a vaccine adjuvant, e.g., alum, may act by a combination of various mechanisms, such as forming depot, recruiting immune cells, enhancing Ag uptake and presentation, inducing production of cytokines and chemokines, and promoting Ag and APC traffic to dLNs [51] . By and large, an adjuvant improves the immunoresponses, in some cases, as a result of: (1) recruiting immune cells such as DCs, MPs and neutrophils to vaccination site; (2) facilitating APC uptake of Ags; and (3) activating innate immune cells such as neutrophils, natural killer cells (NKCs), and especially, professional APCs (mainly DCs and MPs) (Fig. 2) . These aspects promote not only the release of a specific myriad of cytokines and chemokines promoting generation of specialized T lymphocyte subsets such as Th1 and Th2 cells, but also the presentation of Ags in MHC-I and/or -II mode, resulting in enhanced humoral and/or cellular immunity against pathogens (Fig. 2) [52] . Also, it is argued that a classical adjuvant exerts only the short-lived effects on the adaptive immunoresponses, which may arise from the influence of a specific collection of cytokines and chemokines released by immunocytes under stimulation of the adjuvant-activated APCs with just a short life.",

            "text": "The safety concern on conventional vaccines promotes scientists to develop novel subunit vaccines that are not based on a whole microorganism but its antigenic parts, such as proteins, DNA, RNA, and the synthetic carrier-vectored Ags [53] . However, lack of other components of a pathogen, which may not only play a role in protection of antigens but also act as a type of PAMP/DAMP, often makes subunit vaccines vulnerable to environmental damages and ineffective in triggering immunoresponses toward Ags [54, 55] . To enhance the potency of subunit vaccines, researchers have developed various types of particulate carriers, such as liposomes, cochleates, virosomes, emulsions, lipid and polymeric NPs, some of which are constructed in just the manner of mimicking the structure of pathogenic organisms to carry, protect and deliver vaccines, thus promoting their immunostimulatory activities [14, 17, 29, 53, 56] . Also, these particulate carriers are often additionally incorporated with functional molecules, such as TLRas (toll-like receptor agonists/ligands), CLRas (C-type lectin receptor agonist/ligands), NLRas (NOD-like receptor agonists/ligands), saponin and squalene and their derivatives, and various environmental stimulussensitive molecules, to further expand their functions [57, 58] . As such, these carriers can play roles of not only an adjuvant in boosting immunostimulatory effects, but also of a delivery vehicle for targeting immunocytes as well as for the sustained or signal-triggered release, engendering a multifunctional vaccine adjuvant-delivery system (VADS) [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] 28, 30, [59] [60] [61] . The best illumination of this concept of VADS may perhaps be presented by citing the FDA (Food and Drug Administration of USA) approved novel adjuvant entities, such as nanoemulsion/squalene-based MF59, liposome/TLR4a-based AS01, liposome/TLR4a/saponin-based AS01b, and aluminium aggregate/TLR4a-based AS04, which are used in several vaccines serving as both an adjuvant and a vehicle for delivering bioactive ingredients [5, 62] .",

CPP was defined as the equation of CPP = v/a o l c , where v, l c and a o are, respectively, the volume and length of the lipophilic chain, and the cross-section area of the hydrophilic core of the phospholipid expressed per molecule in the aggregates [66] . And the amphiphilic molecules with a CPP value falling out of the range will assemble into other shapes [67] , as shown in Fig. 3 . Generally, liposomes may be made of different types of amphiphilic phospholipids, such as PC (phosphatidylcholine), PS (phosphatidylserine) and SM (sphingomyelin), which may also be combined with other lipids, such as CHO (cholesterol) for membrane stabilization, and the negatively or positively charged lipids to modulate liposome structure and surface properties, thus forming a suitable carrier to be used as a DDS (drug delivery system) or a VADS. Some of the materials that are most frequently used for preparation of liposomes are shown with molecular structure in Fig. 4 .",

            "text": "Notably, at ambient temperature, liposomes will display their bilayer membranes in a \"fluid\" or \"rigid\" fluidity state, which is determined by the phospholipid category and its hydrocarbon chain length (usually longer than 12C) as well as saturation (Fig. 5) . These parameters together with the location of unsaturated carbon bond remarkably influence the van de Waals force, and other the interactions, among adjacent chains of phospholipids thus governing membranes to manifest the corresponding fluidity. As such, liposomes with membranes consisting of just a type of phospholipids will show a specific gel to liquid crystalline phase transition temperature (T c ), which, however, may be blurred when a mixture of lipids, such as egg PC, soy PC, or combined with CHO, is used. Thus, when liposomes are made of a phospholipid with T c above or below the ambient temperature, their membranes will correspondingly be in the rigid gel or fluid liquid crystalline phase [26] . However, when liposomes are made of a phospholipid with T c just equivalent to the ambient temperature, their membranes will manifest a maximal permeability and may abruptly release all loaded cargos, and this phenomenon is sometimes employed to engineer a temperature-sensitive carrier. At room temperature, whilst liposome lipids with long and saturated hydrocarbon chains have a high T c and tend to form rigid ordered bilayer structures which may be in a gel phase, liposome lipids with short and unsaturated chains have a low T c and will generate fluid and disorganised bilayers which may be in a liquid-crystalline phase (Fig. 5) . Interestingly, incorporation of CHO may significantly influence the fluidity of membranes and, at high concentration (CHO/PC > 1/3 mol), may smear out the gel-liquid crystalline transition phenomenon in liposomes. Particularly, CHO may remarkably decrease permeability of membranes and thus, is often employed for preventing leakage of liposomes, especially, when lyophilization or elevation of temperature for remote drug loading is involved [68, 69] .",

PEGylation not only can prevent liposomes from coagulation and fusion, but also might allow liposomes to avoid being bound by plasma proteins, or to be bound by certain specific types of plasma proteins which recently were surprisingly reported able to enormously prolong NP (nanoparticle) circulation time in vivo [70] , thus generating the socalled stealth effects on liposomes [71] . In addition, liposomes can be enhanced in stability by charging with cationic or anionic lipids to generate a repulsive electrostatic force repelling each other to avoid aggregation. Also, freeze-drying of liposomes in the presence of sugar as lyoprotectant to form a dry cake fixing individual liposomes in a solid matrix provides a feasible strategy to increase product stability as high as enough to meet the clinical application needs [72] .",

However, they are based on the conventional liposomes, which may be designed to fit well the function of a VADS [27] , thanks to their distinctive structures classifying liposomes into three basic types. (1) Small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs) with a size < 200 nm or large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs) with a size < 500 nm but > 200 nm, which are spheres with a single phospholipid bilayer and are frequently used as a targeting DDS or VADS. (2) Microsized multilamellar vesicles (MLVs), which have numerous concentric phospholipid bilayers and are usually used as a sustained release carrier. (3) Micro-sized multivesicular liposomes (MVLs), which are featured with multiple water-filled cavities separated by continuously connected lipid bilayers and are used as a reservoir for long sustained release ( Fig. 6 ) [74] .",

Meanwhile, the vaccinated mice showed at injection sites no signs of granulomas, a common side effect associated with conventional adjuvants, nor the symptoms of hypersensitivity reaction, after receiving intravenous or intra-foot pad immunization [24] [25] [26] 75] . These early investigations paved the way for exploring liposomes as a VADS and were immediately followed by numerous studies, which further revealed that the immunostimulatory activity of liposomes as a VADS is significantly influenced by their physicochemical properties and even vaccination routes [18, 76, 77] . Now, liposomes have firmly proven a safe and effective VADS with low reactogenicity and able to carry multiple Ags, other adjuvants and/ or functional molecules, such as PRRas and even aluminium NPs, to further enhance immune-boosting effects or dictate immunoresponses toward Th1 and/or Th2 pathways for establishing desired immunity [15, 28, 78] .",

            "text": "Cationic liposomes are usually made (by additionally incorporating) of lipids with quaternary ammonium head groups that are positively charged in normal physiological conditions (Fig. 4) . This kind of liposomes when injected intravenously into mice may generate the celldisrupting and haemolysis effects, rendering them reduced practical applications in vessel vaccination [79] . By contrast, with local administration, the cationic liposomes may cause tissue damage at the injection site, leading to the release of endogenous materials such as nucleic acids, which may likely act as a DAMP to activate immune cells, forming the basis for the use as a VADS [80] . In addition, cationic liposomes can carry via entrapment and/or adsorption the negatively charged Ags, which after administration will not be immediately released due to electrostatic attraction, thus forming a depot effect to recruit APCs. Interestingly, APCs are usually negatively charged and therefore prone to adhesion by cationic liposomes, which thus are subjected to the accelerated cellular phagocytosis, making an enhanced contribution to APC activation via, perhaps, the intracellular FcR\u03b3-Syk-Card9 pathway [81, 82] . For example, the cationic liposomes made of DDA/TDB of 5: 1 (w/w) (DDA, dimethyl dioctadecyl-ammonium bromide; TDB, \u03b1,\u03b1'-trehalose 6,6\u2032-dibehenate), have been successfully developed as a clinical trial VADS for delivering different Ags, such as tuberculosis (TB) antigen of Ag85B-ESAT-6 and hepatitis B virus (HBV) surface antigen (HBsAg). And the available data demonstrated that the cationic liposomes could safely induce robust cellular and humoral immunoresponses via either subcutaneous (s.c.) or intramuscular (i.m.) vaccination [83] . These outcomes strongly suggest cationic liposomes a promising VADS able to effectively deliver vaccines for eliciting the anti-pathogen immunity.",

By intuition, anionic surface charge can hardly offer benefits to delivering vaccines to APCs given the anionic nature of the latter, which due to electrostatic repulsion may repel the negatively charged particles from access to cellular uptake. However, a recent study reported that, in the presence of adjuvant GLA (glucopyranosyl lipid adjuvant, a TLR4a), the anionic liposomes made of CHO/DPPC/DPPG were more potent in enhancing Th1 responses in mice than the cationic liposomes made of CHO/DPPC/DPTAP, in the case of delivering Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) Ag of ID93. Moreover, this effect of cationic liposomes was also correlated well with the VADS in protection against Mtb challenge [85] . Notably, for mucosal vaccination, the anionic or neutral particles may be an advantageous VADS, because they will not bind to and be trapped in the negatively charged mucus gel layer, thus allowing them to easily approach the follicle-associated epithelia whereby to be endocytosed by M cells [86] . Also, in a previous report researchers confirmed in mice that both anionic and neutral NPs showed a higher affinity to the Peyer's patches than cationic particles [87] , suggesting the negatively charged carriers may favour oral and, possibly, other mucosal vaccination.",

However, during apoptosis under mediation of scramblase which acts to bidirectionally transport phospholipids in membranes in an ATP-independent manner, PS will flip to the outer leaflet so as to be instantly exposed for recognition through binding to a number of specific PS receptors that are expressed on immune cells, mainly MPs and immature DCs [91] . Then, these immune cells are subsequently triggered to devour timely the apoptotic cells leaving them no chance to release noxious materials for inducing deleterious autoimmune reactions [92] . Thus, PS in vivo acts in fact as a crucial danger or \"eat me\" signal to immune cells, mainly APCs, providing, probably, an ideal component that may be incorporated in liposomes to facilitate APC uptake of the carried Ags and sponsoring the downstream immunoresponses. It should be noted that different PS receptors on different immune cells (not only APCs), upon PS ligation, will manifest different functions, including, particularly, the anti-inflammatory and even tolerogenic effects. These effects, on one hand, are in good accommodation to PS role in inducing rapid phagocytic clearance of dying cells in silence to avoid autoimmunity, but, on the other hand, count obviously against establishing the anti-pathogen immunity [93, 94] .",

This inhibitory effect exerted through in vivo activating PS receptors was reversed by administration of the Abs against TGF-\u03b2 (transforming growth factor-\u03b2), which showed an increased expression in PS-treated mice, implying its potential role in mediating the inhibitory function of PS. Moreover, PS-containing liposomes neither directly inhibited DC maturation in vitro in response to different stimuli, nor prevented DC migration to dLNs in vivo, hinting the complicated interactions among various immunocytes involved in the suppressive process sponsored by PS. Recently, Balu-lyer's group prepared Factor VIII-loaded liposomes with PS/PC (3:7 mol ratio), which when incubated with DCs in vitro caused increased secretion of TGF-\u03b2, and, when immunized to mice, due to PS incorporation, not only lowered the Ag-specific Ab response but also induced the hypo-responsiveness to the Ag re-challenge [96] . These outcomes suggest that PS-containing liposomes may function to exert the immune regulatory effects capable of converting an immunogen to a tolerogen, opposing the use as a VADS against pathogens.",

Also, Cauvi et al revealed in murine model that anionic empty PS liposomes triggered peritoneal MPs to have about 4700 genes specifically modified, resulting in changed protein expressions by peritoneal cells, including increased secretion of several chemokines (CXCL1, CXCL2, CSF-2, and CSF-3) and cytokines (TNF-a, IL-6, IL-10). And consequently, massive neutrophil infiltration into the peritoneum succeeded and proved capable of neutralizing a septic polymicrobial insult [98] . However, such neutralization of pathogens was also obtained by intraperitoneal administration of PG liposomes, suggesting that these effects might be just caused by the negative charge property of phospholipids, through possibly increasing the absolute value of the negative potential of MP plasma internal membranes. The membrane potential change may ignite the intracellular signalling cascade involved in activating the innate immunoresponses responsible for controlling infections. Obviously, these immunostimulatory effects of empty PS liposomes can hardly be directly translated into an Ag-loaded VADS, which functions well only when both the innate and adaptive immune systems are sufficiently activated.",

For instance, Arigita et al recently reported that vaccines delivered by the PS liposomes resulted in an improved Ag uptake by DCs and an increase of the anti-bacterial antibody response compared to those delivered by PG liposomes [99] . Cui's group also observed that, when simply admixed with model Ags, anionic liposomes prepared with DOPS or DOPA (1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoric acid) showed comparable and even strong adjuvant activities on both humoral and cellular responses and elicited stronger Ag-specific antibody immunity than alum admixed with Ags, compared to DOPG liposomes which showed only a weak adjuvanticity [84] . However, other researchers observed that only PS-, but not PA-, containing liposomes with encapsulated Ags were noticed of the ability to enhance the Ag-specific immunoresponses. This was evidenced by the observation that, cocultured with the Ag-specific Th1 clone 42-6A cells in the presence of APCs, PS liposomes triggered the Ag-specific production of IFN-\u03b3. And in mice only co-administration with the Ag-specific Th1 cells plus Ag-loaded PS liposomes could induce secretion of high levels of serum and splenic IFN-\u03b3 [100] . In another study, PS liposomes were demonstrated capable of promoting APC uptake of their carried Ags, as a result of liposome binding to PS-specific receptors on APCs. This conclusion was reinforced by the work from Chiantia's group, which showed that the anti-HIV Env Ab-decorated PS liposomes were bound by HIV VLPs (virus-like particles), which were facilitated, for MP internalization, in a liposome PS-dependent manner [101] .",

For instance, it was demonstrated that rigid liposomes made of DDA (dimethyl dioctadecylammonium, Tc of 47\u00b0C) triggered more robust immune reactions than did fluid liposomes composed of unsaturated DODA (dimethyl dioleoylammonium) [103] . Further investigation revealed that the DDA rigid liposomes presented a larger amount of Ags at the injection site, thus attracting more APCs with elevated CD40 and CD86 to engender higher Th1 responses than did the fluid DODA liposomes. Also, DODA liposomes were found to readily release the Ags at the injection site, leading to formation of a population of Ag-positive but adjuvant-negative APCs which were thus less activated. However, an earlier paper reported that the haptenated liposomes made of DOPC (dioleoyl L-\u03b1-phosphatidylcholine, Tc of \u221217\u00b0C) or DSPC (Tc of 55\u00b0C) showed a low immunogenicity than liposomes made of DPPC (Tc of 41\u00b0C) or sphingomyelin (Tc of 30-38\u00b0C), either of which has an intermediate Tc relevant to DPPC and DOPC, suggesting the immunostimulatory activity of liposome may have little direct relevance to their membrane fluidity [104] .",

However, in terms of the influence of CHO on the immunostimulatory effect of a liposome VADS, the conclusion is rather elusive. Whilst in some studies inclusion of CHO in liposomes was observed to enhance immunoresponses [104] , other investigations also demonstrated that liposomes containing CHO with an elevated membrane fluidity showed decreased adjuvant effects [105] . Nevertheless, inclusion of CHO seems to have a distinct impact on immunostimulatory activity of a liposomal VADS, although the available investigations reported inconsistent results [105, 106] . Recent work by Jiskoot et al demonstrated that the presence of CHO significantly contributed to the adjuvant effect of the influenza HA (hemagglutinin)loaded cationic liposomes composed of eDPPC (1,2-diacyl-sn-glycero-3ethylphosphocholine)/CHO. In comparison to the liposomes containing no CHO, eDPPC/CHO liposomes facilitated HA uptake by DCs in vitro and enhanced anti-HA immunity in mice. However, for cationic liposomes, incorporation of CHO exerted only a moderate impact on immunoresponses triggered by the VADS [107] . Luis et al using a HIV-1 gp41 MPER (membrane proximal external region) engrafted with tetanus toxoid (TT) as Ags, and POPC (1-palmitoyl-2-oleoylphosphatidylcholine) as the matrix material, prepared the Ag-loaded liposomes as a VADS against HIV. To enhance efficacy, the liposomes were further incorporated with other lipids, including PS (phosphatidylserine), GM3, or combinatory CHO/SM (sphingomyelin) which are enriched in HIV viral membrane lipid rafts, where MPER is embedded for maintaining peptide conformation [97] . In mice, the gp41-TTloaded POPC liposomes when combined with PS/GM3 or CHO/SM induced significantly increased anti-gp41 immune reactions which was further enhanced by the addition of MPLA. By contrast, insertion of PS or MG3 alone to the gp41-TT-loaded POPC liposomes made no contribution to enhancement of immunoresponses. These outcomes imply that CHO plays roles in a liposome VADS, as embodied not only in constructing a stable VADS but also in maintaining the specific carrier structure for displaying Ags in a distinctive/natural way, thus making an impact on immunization effects.",

For example, it is reported that when administered to mice by either subcutaneous injection or oral uptake, smaller lipid vesicles (< 150 nm) enhanced the development of Th2 response, whereas larger lipid vesicles (> 200 nm) promoted IFN-\u03b3 and typical Th1 response [108, 109] .

These liposomes exhibited a similar slow drainage from the injection site in mice, but a size-dependent movement to popliteal dLNs, wherein large vesicles were detected at a remarkably elevated level in comparison to small vesicles [111] . The results suggest that, in contrast to neutral liposomes, cationic liposomes with a large size may tend to from a depot at injection site due to binding to cells or tissue components via electrostatic attraction, and thus be picked up more efficiently by local APCs for trafficking to LNs. The group also found cationic liposomes with a large size (2 \u03bcm) triggered high splenocyte proliferation but low IL-10 secretion, while the positively charged vesicles of 500 nm promoted production of IFN-\u03b3 from splenocytes and secretion of IL-1\u03b2 at the injection site favouring Th1 responses [111] . When the cationic liposomes were PEGylated, the passive drainage was observed to cause in mouse dLNs an enhanced proportion of smaller, rather than larger, vesicles. And the PEGylated small liposomes exerted lowered depot effects and induced deceased production of IgG2b and IFN-\u03b3 but increased IL-5, in comparison to their un-PEGylated counterparts, suggesting PEGylated cationic liposomes with a small size may be in favour of Th2 response [71] .",

The results revealed that Ags carried by the vesicles with a large size (560 nm) were delivered into the early endosome-like, immature phagosomes, which are responsible for recruiting the Agprocessing apparatus, leading to efficient Ag presentation. By contrast, soluble or small vesicle (155 nm)-carried Ags rapidly localized to the late endolysosomes wherein they were degraded, leading to a reduced Ag-presentation efficiency [112] . Seeing that frequent occurrence of lysosomal degradation of Ags into useless pieces will invalidate vaccination, researchers are focusing efforts on developing liposomes as a multifunctional VADS that is capable of not only delivering Ags into APCs but also rendering the intracellular Ags lysosome escape [28] . Lysosome escape proves a feasible strategy allowing Ags to avoid lysosomal degradation and to be processed by immunoproteasomes (specialized proteasomes in immunocytes) within APCs. Cellular immunoproteasomes, owing to their distinct beta subunits of \u03b2-1, \u22122, \u22125i with special activity, have a low caspase-like proteolytic activity but a high chymotrypsin-like activity, and thus, during antigen process, can contribute to creating small fragments that are more likely to bind to MHC-I molecules for presentation, as such enhancing Th1 responses [113] .",

With the lipid bilayer-enclosed structure, liposomes can be loaded with Ags through several modes: adsorption on or linkage by covalent bonds onto surfaces, entrapment in interiors, intercalation between adjacent bilayers (particularly for MLVs or special lipid structures, such as cochleates), and combination of these ways. Recently, Perrie's group constructed DDA/TDB cationic liposomes as a VADS and loaded the cationic vesicles with Ags by two modes: adsorption on surface of MLVs and encapsulation within DRVs (dehydration-rehydration vesicles). The researchers showed that Ag location in liposomes did not make a difference in several aspects including vaccine biodistribution, APC recruitment and antibody response. However, when bearing 10% PEGylation, MLVs induced significantly higher IFN-\u03b3 responses than did DRV counterparts. But this effect was dramatically reversed by 25% PEGylation of the vesicles, when the DRV formulation promoted higher IFN-\u03b3 responses [71] . Previously, this group fabricated the Ag-encapsulated or -adsorbed microspheres with poly(lactide-coglycolide) (PLGA), chitosan and DDA, and showed that whilst the Ags bound to carrier surface favoured humoral responses, the entrapped Ags were more likely to trigger a N.

The authors proved that small NPs preferentially augmented CTLs, as a result of instant cleavage of the disulfide linkage to release Ags in early endosomes, thus rendering Ags lysosome escape for proteasome processing and MHC-I presentation. In contrast, HPSs were better at activating CD4+ T cells, enhancing follicular CD4+ T helper (fTh) cell response to activate follicular B lymphocytes for antibody production. The reason was argued as that the Ags were protectively delivered by HPSs into lysosomes wherein to be released from the oxidative catalysis-disrupted HPSs and thus were subjected to lysosomal process and MHC-II presentation. The authors also revealed that, though HPSs travelled to dLNs at a slower speed than did NPs due to an increased interstitial resistance to larger particles, an equivalent amount of Ags was drained to dLNs after immunization with either carriers at long time point (36 h) . However, at early time point (2 h), HPSs were mainly retained in lymphatic sinuses allowing Ags to be sampled by CD11b + DCs, which are residing close to LN cortex and relevant to MHC-II presentation; by contrast, NPs smoothly reached LN paracortical area wherein to be picked up by CD11c mid MHC-II hi migratory DCs, which processed Ags via proteasomes for MHC-I presentation [115] .",

By contrast, the gentle adsorption process may be accomplished by just mixing of ingredients and possesses a good chance to maintain Ag activities [116] . However, Ags adsorbed on a carrier surface may be released at a relatively high rate, leaving a limited time window for APC recruitment, and this may cause inefficient and unsynchronized cellular uptake of Ags and adjuvants to form a population of APCs that are Ag-positive but adjuvant-negative and unable to properly present Ags, as mentioned above [103] . Recent studies also reported that whilst encapsulation of Ags within a carrier engendered more efficient lysosomal escape and cross-presentation of Ags in DCs than did absorption on a carrier [117] , whereas the combination of Ag encapsulation and absorption of Ags with PLGA NPs induced more potent anti-Ag immunoresponses than each mode alone did, due, perhaps, to both adequate initial and persistent Ag exposure [118] .",

For examples, as mentioned above, the work by Cui's group proved that anionic liposomes also displayed robust adjuvant activity when simply admixed with Ags [84] .

This means that a liposome VADS can be captured by immune cells including APCs that are patrolling and searching the alien materials throughout the body while performing their defensive missions. This also means that the Ags delivered by liposomes possess a great chance to be picked up by immune cells, whether they are still carried by the VADS or not. As a result of this, the Ag release or leakage from liposomes seems to make less sense in vaccination and thus, may not receive the concern during the VADS development as enough as that of a DDS does, as reflected by many reports wherein the Ag release test was completely neglected [123] [124] [125] . Further, this situation may be exacerbated by the notice that the licensed vaccines based on a VADS are functioning to elicit immunity against pathogens without loading Ags to carriers via encapsulation or adsorption. And they are manufactured mostly through admixing Ags with liposomes, or other NPs, even just before immunization, as exemplified by Shingrix\u00ae vaccines which are supplied with separated packages of Ag and VADS [126] .",

In addition, certain adjuvants are compounds with a low molecular weight (MW), and incorporation in liposomes or other VADSs can guarantee their co-delivery with Ags to the same population of APCs, while avoiding a systemic distribution and off-target cellular uptake. For example, resiquimod, a small water-soluble agonist of the endosome-located TLR7/8, will rapidly distribute throughout the body after injection in an aqueous solution and, when conjugated to cationic liposomes composed of DDA/TDB, has achieved co-delivery with Ags in mouse models, though this bound combination did not significantly elevate the already strong adjuvanticity of the cationic liposomes [127] .",

Moreover, these investigations on Ag release were mostly conducted with in vitro experiments, which can hardly reflect the real profile that liposomes will manifest under in vivo circumstances. In vivo, liposomes will encounter numerous chemicals, proteins and enzymes, which may selectively bind to the carrier, possibly catalyse its components to degrade, and even make the carrier broken. Indeed, many types of liposomes (especially, the cationic ones) designed as a VADS are loaded with Ags via electrostatic attraction, and when injected into the body they are likely to be neutralized to lose the carried cargos. In studies relevant to the in vivo characteristics, fluorescent materials are often employed as a label for tracking the behaviour of liposomes in the body [128] . However, this hardly provides a strong evidence to verify the carrier integrity, since fluorescent materials may aggregate to emit light even after carrier collapse. It should be pointed out that even the theoretical analyses sound reasonable, the experimental data on the in vivo characteristics of carriers are yet in shortage and are needed to provide a solid support for the rational design of liposome VADSs.",

Also, Wang's group showed that administration of a multifunctional liposome VADS with microneedle arrays (MAs) to mouse oral cavity mucosa induced robust immunity in oral and gastrointestinal mucosa, favouring prophylaxis of pathogens transmitted via ingesting route [60] . By comparison, when a similar liposome VADS delivered by MAs were administered to mice via vaginal mucosa, it elicited strong immunity in reproductive duct and intestinal lumen, which is of peculiar significance for defending against sexually transmitted infections [28] . More recently, Fox et al. developed LecA Ag-loaded PEGylated liposomes containing two TLRas: GLA (TLR4a) and 3 M-052 (TLR7/8a), which after administered intranasally to mice elicited efficiently both intestinal mucosal and Th1 responses. Compared to s.c. administration, intranasal vaccination induced mice to produce elevated levels of fecal IgA, serum IgG2a, IFN-\u03b3 and IL-17A, and finally provided > 80% protection of mice from disease challenge [133] .

Thus, a liposome VADS may show a depot effect, targeted biodistribution and specific intracellular trafficking, which act in combination to dictate the outcomes of the adaptive immunoresponses. As a result, liposome formulations should be optimized with full consideration on the vast array of lipids and combinations, vesicle structures, and their physicochemical characteristics. These issues may well be regarded as a multi-factorial impact and should be optimally combined in constituting an effective VADS, which is capable of not only delivering Ags but also promoting APC activation and its interaction with the downstream immunocytes to elicit the desired immunity. Though some NPs exemplified here are, in a strict sense, not liposomes, it is known that despite of the carrier type, it is the size, structure, surface properties, and Ag release feature that are the main decisive factors that define the function of a VADS. Therefore, their investigation outcomes and conclusions may provide a useful reference to developing a liposome VADS as well [27] .",

As discussed above, modulation of liposomes on their physicochemical properties such as size and surface charge, can also improve their immunostimulatory effects [27] . However, in more cases, liposomes are specifically engineered in a certain way to engender special functions enabling them to efficiently activate host immune system. Vertebrate immune system according to its function includes two subtypes: the innate immune system, with NK (natural killer) cells, monocytes and, especially, APCs (MPs and DCs) as the main participants; and the adaptive immune system, with T and B cells as the main participants [134] . Whilst the adaptive immune system has evolved for around 500 million years and is confined to vertebrates, the innate immune system has been established for a much longer time and acts as the main defensive strategy among vertebrates, invertebrates, as well as in plants, under modulation by rather conserved mechanisms [135] . Innate immune system plays an important role in constructing the antipathogen immunity, because its activation is a precursor and prerequisite to sponsoring the Ag-specific adaptive immunoresponses. Therefore, innate immunoresponses usually occur in advance upon detection of the PAMPs/DAMPs via various PRRs, such as TLRs, CLRs, RLRs and NLRs, commonly expressed on immunocytes, especially, APCs. Notably, these PRRs are providing a collection of targets for designing a VADS to boost immunoresponses toward Ags and thus are now widely employed for engineering functional liposomes, and also other NPs, as a vaccine carrier [136] .",

Vaginal administration of proSMMA to mice by mucosal patching elicited robust anti-Ag humoral as well as cellular immunity at both systemic and mucosal levels, especially, in the reproductive and intestinal tissues. Deep dissection disclosed that the novel VADS engendered the liposome-carried Ags to be phagocytosed by both mucosal and dLN-resident APCs and, thereafter, be substantially cross-presented for MHC-I exposure as a result of lysosome escape and ROS (reactive oxygen species) irritation, which were caused by the functional liposomes, leading to establishing the ultimate comprehensive and intensive immunity. These results proved that liposomes are such a versatile carrier that can be incorporated with the immune-boosting molecules, and they can be further fabricated into the administrationfitted device, like a microneedle array, to form the multifunctional VADS, which is able to elicit strong immunity at mucosa to set up the first line of defence against pathogens [27] .",

In vivo experiments demonstrated that, administered to the Rha-preimmunized C57BL/6 mice, the Rha epitope-and Ag-anchored liposomes remarkably enhanced production of the MUC1-specific CTLs as well as Abs. In particular, this kind of anti-MUC1 Abs might possess a big potential to bind to and kill tumour cells through ADCC (Ab dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity) via Fc\u03b3Rs (Fc\u03b3 receptors) expressed on certain myeloid cells, such as NK cells, MPs, neutrophils and eosinophils [143] . Further, the authors showed that in vivo Rha-modified liposomes were bound by anti-Rha Abs to form the immune complexes, which facilitated APC uptake and (cross) presentation of MUC1 Ags. These results suggest the possibility of using a liposome VADS to enhance APC cross presentation of Ag epitopes on MHC-I through Ab-mediated phagocytosis via formation of anti-Rha-FcR (Fc receptor) (Fig. 8) , which occurs owing to the presence of natural anti-Rha Abs. Notably, in humans the natural anti-Rha Abs exist abundantly as IgM and IgG2 (IgG3 in mice) [144] , which generally bind poorly to Fc\u03b3R and thus, will exert trivial inhibitory effects on the ADCC-based anticancer activities.",

Recently, Irvine's group created a novel VADS bearing such a concept and fabricated with poly-l-lactide-constructed microneedle array (MA), of which microneedle projections were coated with a mixture of the Ag/CpG (an adjuvant of TLR9a)loaded liposomes (interbilayer cross-linked multilamellar vesicles, ICMVs) and the Ca 2+ cross-linked alginate polymers, to form the stimulatory sampling microneedles (SSMNs) [145] . After insertion into skin, SSMN polymers swelled due to hydration into a porous matrix capable of longitudinal sampling of the interstitial fluid and the infiltrated local leukocytes, enabling parallel monitoring of immune reactions while causing trivial injury (Fig. 9 ). In mice, even after the anti-Ag T cells in systemic circulation could not be detected by conventional protocol, SSMNs still successfully sampled the tissue-resident memory T cells in the skin, while exerting no influence on the immune status of na\u00efve or antigen-exposed animal models. Could this liposome-constructed SSMNs be successfully adapted to accomplish the vaccination regime while temporally monitoring immunocytes and collecting immunological information from the skin and mucosal tissues in a noninvasive manner, would it represent a superior functional VADS.",

Modulation of each of the individual components may significantly affect the whole community of signalling pathways that are involved in immunoresponses or other biological processes.

However, it took a rather long time to make the first drug-loaded liposomes ever come out as a clinical product. This is a bit of discouraging and far beyond the commitment of some liposome scientists, especially, in the middle of 1980s, when some researchers even doubted the feasibility of liposome DDS [146] . Fortunately, just at that time, certain liposome-based cosmetic products were successfully brought to markets by several giant fashion-focused companies. It was hopeful and never helpless for pharmaceutical scientists to see that the first batch of liposomal products were flamboyantly marketed as an anti-aging cream with an exaggerated name of 'Capture' introduced by Dior in 1986, followed immediately by 'Niosome' marketed in 1987 by Lancome, a L'Oreal company [147] . Encouraged by this, combined with great achievements in optimization of liposome formulations, such as control of vesicle size, and lyophilisation of stable dry products with disaccharides as a lyoprotectant, scientists eventually brought to European markets in 1990 the first therapeutic liposomal product, Ambisome\u00ae. It is amphotericin B-loaded SUVs with the optimized formulation of HSPC/CHO/DSPG/amphotericin B (5:2.5:2:1, mole ratio) and a size of around 40 nm, and was later authorized in USA in 1997, to treat systemic fungal infections and certain protozoan infections such as visceral leishmaniasis and primary amoebic meningoencephalitis [148, 149] . Meanwhile, two breakthrough techniques, remote loading drugs into liposomes and PEGylation of liposome surfaces, were achieved and matured to clear, in the development of liposomal products, the longstanding crucial barriers, including poor encapsulation of drugs, instability of an aqueous suspension of liposomes, and very short circulation time of in vivo liposomes due to rapid removal conducted by mononuclear phagocytic system (MPS) after systemic injection. As a consequence of these achievements, the first anticancer liposomal drug Doxil\u00ae, which is the Stealth\u00ae (pegylated) liposomes composed of HSPC/CHO/DSPE-mPEG 2000 (3:1:1, mass ratio), having a size of about 100 nm, and loaded by ammonium sulfate-gradient procedure with doxorubicin (total lipid/drug = 8:1, mass ratio), came ultimately into markets after final approval by FDA in 1995 for the treatment of AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma, and later expanded for therapy of ovarian cancer in 1999, and for multiple myeloma in 2007 [72] .",

Shingles is caused by reactivation of the dormant DNA VZV (varicella zoster virus, a member of the herpesvirus family) that has resided in sensory dorsal root ganglia after its first infection of hosts, likely, causing relatively mild varicella (also called chickenpox) (Fig. 10 ) [62] . The primary infection triggers response to VZV leading to the release of antiviral cytokines and activation of NK cells usually able to control viral replication in the mucosa. Also, the primary infection stimulates the hosts to establish the adaptive and memory immunity forming persistence of anti-VZV IgG and VZV-specific CD4+ T cells and, particularly, CD8+ CTLs. This kind of immunity correlates best with the severity of primary infection and preventing reactivation of latent VZV residing in ganglionic cells, but, unfortunately, naturally wanes over time, allowing possible occurrence of shingles in late life [153] . Shingles may be caused by risk factors including old age, weakened cellular immunity, illness, female gender, genetic susceptibility, mechanical trauma, recent psychological stress and white race. Shingles usually manifests the prodrome of acute neuralgia for 2-100 days preceding the rash, accompanied by potentially devastating complications of secondary bacterial infection and sepsis, meningoencephalitis, visual and hearing impairment [154] .",

However, the vaccine efficacy decreases rapidly with time and the incidence of shingles may return to around baseline levels around year 8 post vaccination. Moreover, there are certain contra-indications to the live-attenuated microbe-based vaccines, e.g., in VZV naive or immunosuppressed patients, the vaccination may cause diseases [155] . This suggests that it is desirable to develop an alternative that should be a subunit vaccine with a good safety profile and high efficacy. And these issues represent the guidance and impetus to the design and development of novel vaccines against shingles, and thus comes Shin-grix\u00ae.",

AS01b is a VADS consisting of an aqueous suspension of DOPC/CHO/MPLA liposomes with a size of 50-100 nm [156] bound by QS21 to liposome CHO (Fig. 11 ) [157] . The Ag of gE is the most abundant glycoprotein on both VZV virions and cells infected with VZV and plays a crucial role in virus replication and cell-to-cell spread, while it can elicit a greater immune response than other glycoprotein antigens [158] . The accomplished clinical trials confirmed that the vaccine efficacy to prevent the development of shingles for up to 4 years follow up was 97% overall in subjects older than 50 years of age, and around 90% in participants older than 70 years old. More importantly, the anti-Ag response appears preserved with age since protective efficacy waned minimally over 4 years and was well maintained in adults aged over 70 years [159] . The rational design of Shingrix\u00ae can be attributed to several aspects: the strong background study results in the right choice of the proper Ag of gE; the component QS21 guarantees effective activation of innate immunoresponses, while MPLA-liposomes direct the response toward Th1 pathway via triggering TLR4 leading to robust cellular immunity, and the liposome VADS has a high stability [160] . The significance of success of Shingrix\u00ae to the both vaccine and liposome fields lies in that it firmly demonstrates that a subunit vaccine not only possesses a good safety profile but also has the potential to elicit the anti-pathogen immunity stronger than that by the whole microbe-based traditional vaccines, as long as it is rationally formulated as a suitable VADS based on an appropriate nanocarrier, such as, liposomes.",

An emulsion-based VADS, MF59, approved to Novartis for delivery of influenza vaccines, is a defined formulation consisting of o/w emulsion of squalene/Span85 /Tween80/water [162] , which was later reformulated by GSK as an emulsion of squalene/\u03b1-tocopherol/ Tween 80/water, known as AS03 [126] . However, unlike liposomes, emulsions are in fact a very fragile carrier having a limited capacity to allow surface modification with functional materials, such as targeting molecules, to form a diverse VADS for delivering subunit vaccines. Alum is another strong VADS that has been used for nearly a century in enhancing antibody immunity [50] ; unfortunately, it often fails in eliciting an effective cellular immunity while showing drawback of reactogenicity associated with unwanted inflammatory side effects. Moreover, alum is not always providing a shelter to labile ingredients but may undermine the quaternary or tertiary structure of proteins due to its potent phosphophilicity exerting strong binding to protein phosphorus groups [163] . By contrast, liposomes can be easily engineered to possess beneficial features of an effective VADS in delivery of Ags, while showing good biocompatibility and minimal side effects.",

For this, in future, liposomes may be developed to play roles of a versatile VADS that can mimic the way whereby the Ags are maintained and exposed to APCs by a pathogen during a natural infection to trigger strong immunoresponses [166] . Achieving this requires liposomes in structure to keep the Ags natural for presentation through, possibly, embedding with multiple copies of the same peptide Ags, while rendering Ags resistance to environmental violation. Other aspects that may be emphasized to improve the immunostimulatory function of liposomes may involve: acting as a depot to increase the exposure time of Ags to immune cells and enhance APC uptake of vaccines; targeting immunocytes or lymph nodes to save Ags; fitting mucosal vaccination to set up both systemic and mucosal immunity; rendering Ags lysosome escape to facilitate cross-presentation of Ags via MHC-I presentation to establish cellular immunity for erasing cell-hidden pathogens or tumour cells [53] . Notably, some functions such as engendering lysosome escape, enhancing Ag cross presentation, and controlling immunological expression in a specific pathway, can hardly be obtained unless the related intracellular biological features are fully understood and able to be explored to test the activity of a VADS that is tailored with the corresponding functions, such as response to environmental stimulus, sensing of physiological factor, and targeting intracellular structures [167] .",

At present, various types of the liposome VADSs have been elaborately designed and presented with promising outcomes of immune-boosting activities in, unfortunately, just murine and other small animal models, which may be yet the inappropriate one for a specific vaccine [26] . In most cases, it is yet impractical to directly interpret the results from such studies as documented only in rodents to a clinical reference, whereas solid conclusions drawn from investigations using different animal models, such as pigs, rhesus monkeys, and even chimpanzees, are often lacking in studying a novel liposome VADS.",

Notably, the unreproducible results not only cause a substantial waste of valuable resources but also badly discourage industrial partners to devote to translation of the findings by researchers from the academia circle [170] . Although the reproducibility of the published results on liposome VADSs remains unclear, the reality can hardly be optimistic based on the disappointed outcomes from such investigations as performed in drug development and other fields. This concern is also indirectly reflected by the professional comments on certain publications complaining the difficulty in interpreting the reported results and also by the disturbance arising from the observations in contradiction to the printed outcomes [171, 172] . Obviously, these are a kind of \"side effects\" arising from the development of vaccines, even when they are based on a liposome VADS claimed of high safety profiles.",
