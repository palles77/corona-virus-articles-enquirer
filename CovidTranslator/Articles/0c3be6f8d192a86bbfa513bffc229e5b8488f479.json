It examines the patterns of crisis communication and the use of Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) during the first month of the crisis. Primary data collected from 24 faceto-face interviews and 12 online surveys are analyzed. The research identifies elements contributing to organizational failures, which by their very nature gain public and media attention, and also explicates the less mentioned successful decisions made by response agencies in the DFW region. It is important to investigate both failures and successes to help inform organizational learning for better preparedness to future health crises. Findings suggest that, although there was a breakdown in communication between small city governments/ municipalities and higher levels of government at the State and Federal levels, prior training and collaborative relationships helped in improvised decision-making. Takeaways for practitioners include reiterating the importance of establishing SOPs, merits of flexibility, and improvisational decisions for shared learning.",

However, less attention has been received from public administration and crisis management scholars. From the first confirmed case of the Ebola virus on September 30th, 2014 in Mr. Eric Duncan, a Liberian national visiting Dallas, Texas, various response agencies in the Dallas Fort Worth (DFW) Metropolitan region came under heavy scrutiny from the world. The likelihood of an American case escalating to an epidemic state and expectations of high mortality rates, made it so. Despite this attention there appears to be no research published to date on how emergency managers in the USA responded to this perceived transboundary health crisis and the adaptive learning and improvised decision making that resulted following the \"communication crisis chaos\" [20] .",

First, it crosses geographical borders, threatening multiple cities, regions, countries and continents --e.g. the Ebola virus which originated in West Africa and crossed international borders and reached the US. Second, it jumps functional boundaries -e.g. the Ebola crisis affected not only health systems but safety and security systems, and the travel and tourism industry globally. Third, it transcends traditional time boundaries such that a clear beginning and ending cannot be pinpointed easily in time-e.g. the March 2014 Ebola outbreak declared as a PHEIC took over two years to clear globally.",

In other words whether the onus of response is on local (e.g. city or county offices of emergency management or county health departments), state (e.g. the State's Department of Emergency Management or the State's Department of Health and Human Services) or federal agencies (e.g. Department of Homeland Security or Centers for Disease Control and Prevention).

The response system (formal or informal) shapes individuals and organizations strategic actions to the extent that they adapt to the unintended consequences of actions that are performed by other agencies. Such an approach notes the challenges of emergency response by examining the conditions or circumstances under which first responders are likely to act/behave contrary to bureaucratic norms. Examining adaptive learning of first responders is important in explaining the value of emergency planning and standard operating procedures (SOPs) as well as improvised decision making and changes in governing procedures for crisis response.",

They suggested encouraging improvisation and learning from it by using a computer based system to log all improvised decision-making in dealing with contingencies and using this to understand cognitive processes and mental models of team members to support training for better preparedness [27, 28, 29] . Morgan et al. [28] further emphasize the need for a deeper understanding of the mental models or cognitive structures of both decision makers and the publics. Getting the priorities and uncertainties of both sides clarified will help streamline the risk communication process such that it is simple, meaningful and helpful to the public in making complex decisions.",

However relevant information collected from appropriate sources, needs to be verified and then shared with response agencies [21] . This requires effective coordination between multiple agencies to ensure resources are used wisely [23] and duplication of efforts are minimized. Smith [42] observed that public agencies typically adopt one of two crisis communication approaches for infectious diseases. Firstly, they issue warnings about what protective actions to take to reduce possible contact with the disease through regular screening, washing hands, wearing a mask, maintaining hygiene and disinfection. Secondly, for greater perceived threats they issue health warnings advising the public to restrict contact with those infected through quarantine measures, travel restrictions, or isolation of the infected person. Instituting these control measures and proper dissemination of such information is important to gain public trust and minimize fear, helplessness, and anxiety among the general public ( [7] , p.1488).",

The onset of a communicable disease has a profound effect on the public, leading to a heightened perceptions of risk especially if it is perceived as likely to spread quickly and result in high mortality rates. For example the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003, which spread rapidly from China to some 37 countries infected approximately 10,000 and killed around 1000. It demonstrated that when there is substantial scientific uncertainty about the cause of an outbreak, and the effectiveness of protective measures called to question, it creates widespread public anxiety ( [42] , pg.3115). This anxiety is further heightened when dreaded consequences are manufactured by the mass media leading to unwarranted public fear and loss of trust in government response mechanisms (pg. 3117).",

Public agencies responding to communicable diseases were 'bureaucratized' [3] , where local government agencies had an expectation that the bulk of response activities was to be shouldered by a higher level government agency. Specifically, the expectation that information related to Ebola should be provided by the national public health agency the CDC; and that, this information was vetted and guided by experts and scientific knowledge. Writing about the pandemic response, [3] argue that \"in their roles as experts of disease outbreak control, the agencies are likely to be called on to guide and publicly legitimate their governments' pandemic responses.\" The Ebola response also highlights the importance of trust in the context of risk communication. According to [26] , much of the failure in emergency response is related to \"the failure of risk communication initiatives\" in particular the reaction of the public to the content of messages as well as the sources of these messages. Under conditions of uncertainty the credibility of the information and \"trust in those providing the information\" ( [26] , p.4) is immediately called to question. If local agencies are to preserve their reputation and legitimacy among their constituents, they have to acknowledge that although command and control structures are important, there is value in \"flexibility and nimble processes to ensure adjusting to changing situations\" as demonstrated by the early days of the Ebola crisis response. Such \"adaptive management -the process that encourages sharing of information and collaboration would foster organizational learning and facilitate adaptation and improvisation ( [50] , p.136).",

First, is the issue of low response rate despite concerted efforts by the research team to contact key informants multiple times. However, this is not unusual for research studies collecting ephemeral data immediately following the occurrence of a crisis. Scholars have argued that such research is often perceived as opportunistic (Wenger 1989; [17] ), by the respondents and this perceived lack of trust is likely to have impacted response rates. Moreover, as Bertrand and Lajtha (2002) suggest, \"many organizations are reluctant to publish/broadcast evidence of structural or management weaknessreal or apparent. There are real life sanctionsfor example, legal and market\u2026.\" (p.188). Secondly, this research is limited to emergency management officials from city, county, schools, universities, hospitals and health departments in the DFW metropolitan area. Thus the findings on the preferences of information sources and the merits or inadequacies of SOPs for communicable and infectious diseases may not be generalizable to other parts of the US. These need further investigation. Despite these limitations, we believe that this research makes a significant contribution to health crisis response planning and management in the USA.",

Furthermore, as noted by Rolison and Hanoch [38] in their study of US residents perceptions of the Ebola virus, those with greater knowledge of the virus perceived less risk of contracting the virus and were more serious about taking protective actions compared to those with lesser knowledge.

On the other hand, leadership roles assumed at the local level were consistently applauded [45] .
