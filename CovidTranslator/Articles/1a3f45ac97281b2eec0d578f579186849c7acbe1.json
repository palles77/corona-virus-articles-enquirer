            "text": "Assessing the risk of infection from emerging viruses or of existing viruses jumping the species barrier into novel hosts is limited by the lack of dose response data. The initial stages of the infection of a host by a virus involve a series of specific contact interactions between molecules in the host and on the virus surface. The strength of the interaction is quantified in the literature by the dissociation constant (K d ) which is determined experimentally and is specific for a given virus molecule/host molecule combination. Here, two stages of the initial infection process of host intestinal cells are modelled, namely escape of the virus in the oral challenge dose from the innate host defenses (e.g. mucin proteins in mucus) and the subsequent binding of any surviving virus to receptor molecules on the surface of the host epithelial cells. The strength of virus binding to host cells and to mucins may be quantified by the association constants, K a and K mucin , respectively. Here, a mechanistic dose-response model for the probability of infection of a host by a given virus dose is constructed using K a and K mucin which may be derived from published K d values taking into account the number of specific molecular interactions. It is shown that the effectiveness of the mucus barrier is determined not only by the amount of mucin but also by the magnitude of K mucin . At very high K mucin values, slight excesses of mucin over virus are sufficient to remove all the virus according to the model. At lower K mucin values, high numbers of virus may escape even with large excesses of mucin. The output from the mechanistic model is the probability (p 1 ) of infection by a single virion which is the parameter used in conventional dose-response models to predict the risk of infection of the host from the ingested dose. It is shown here how differences in K a (due to molecular differences in an emerging virus strain or new host) affect p 1 , and how these differences in K a may be quantified in terms of two thermodynamic parameters, namely enthalpy and entropy. This provides the theoretical link between sequencing data and risk of infection. Lack of data on entropy is a limitation at present and may also affect our interpretation of K d in terms of infectivity. It is concluded that thermodynamic approaches have a major contribution to make in developing dose-response models for emerging viruses.",

            "text": "Microbiological risk assessment (MRA) requires a dose-response relationship to translate the exposure (i.e. number of pathogen particles entering the host through a given route) into the probability of infection. Infection by an oral pathogen is defined as the multiplication of organisms within the host, followed by excretion (Haas et al., 1999) and, for the purpose of the work here does not include progression of disease or the host acquired immune response. Obtaining dose-response data for humans has generally relied on volunteer challenge experiments e.g. Cryptosporidium parvum in students (Okhuysen et al., 1998) or using outbreak data to back-calculate the relationship between measured exposures and infection rates (Teunis et al., 2004) . There are limitations to both approaches particularly with emerging pathogens for which the exposure routes may not be fully elucidated, and for pathogens with serious clinical outcomes, e.g. Zaire ebolavirus (EBOV). Furthermore zoonotic viruses emerge through jumping the species barrier from an animal source to humans, e.g. Nipah virus (NiV) and EBOV, and in this respect the dose response would be for a one-off event that may be inefficient and difficult to reproduce without large numbers of animals. An additional complication is that the pathogen may adapt to the new host, such that its infectivity increases. This is well established for filoviruses in laboratory animals where the infectivity per plaque-forming unit (pfu) may change by several orders of magnitude with passaging (Gale et al., 2016) , and has recently been demonstrated for EBOV Makona adapting to humans through an amino acid substitution in its glycoprotein during the recent catastrophic outbreak in West Africa (Diehl et al., 2016; Urbanowicz et al., 2016) . That outbreak also raised many questions regarding the unknown potential for companion animals (cats and dogs) to serve either as a reservoir or vector for the virus and so be involved in transmission of EBOV to humans and other animals. The absence of dose-response data for EBOV in humans limits development of MRAs for the risk of infection of citizens in the EU for example from EBOV in illegally imported bushmeat. Indeed, it has been proposed that the infectivity to humans of an EBOV pfu may differ not only from bushmeat samples from different wildlife species (e.g. fruits bats and nonhuman primates) but also from different individuals of the same species depending on the degree of host adaptation (Gale et al., 2016) . In effect no two pieces of bushmeat from EBOVinfected wildlife may be the same in terms of infectivity to humans, although this remains to be proved. There is clearly a need for novel approaches to calibrate dose-response relationships for the purposes of MRA for emerging pathogens.",

            "text": "The infection process of a host cell can be broken down into the component steps and modelled mathematically (Handel et al., 2014) and the probability of infection can be expressed as a function of the combined probabilities of each step (Gale et al., 2014) . These steps include overcoming the initial host defenses, binding of the virion to its host cell receptor, entry to the host cell (i.e. internalisation and uncoating of the virion), and replication, capsid assembly and budding (Gale et al., 2014) . Previously it was demonstrated that a dose-response model could, in part, be parameterized using thermodynamic data for some of the key molecular interactions in the infection process (Gale, 2017) . The beauty of thermodynamic data is that they can be measured experimentally by biochemists (in some cases just using molecular components e.g. cloned virus protein and host receptor protein (Wang et al., 2016) ) and do not involve live animal or human volunteer studies, which is a major advantage for dangerous pathogens. Furthermore the effect of amino acid substitutions in the host receptors on binding affinity can be measured directly (Yuan et al., 2015) . The possibility of applying thermodynamics is further developed here for two of the key steps in the infection process of a host by a virus. The first step modelled is the probability of the virus overcoming the innate host defenses posed by mucin protein molecules and the pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs) produced by the host. Mucins have sugar units on their surface which bind to components on the surface of the virus, for example the haemagglutinnin (HA) glycoprotein molecules of influenza virus (de Graaf and Fouchier, 2014) or the VP1 of norovirus (NoV) (de Rougemont et al., 2011) . Mucus present in the respiratory tract hampers influenza virus infection and in the case of humans predominantly contains \u03b12,3-sialic acid receptors. Indeed influenza viruses with \u03b12,3 specificity were inhibited by human mucins (de Graaf and Fouchier, 2014) . The PRRs include the mannose binding protein (MBP) which has carbohydrate-recognition domains (CRD) which bind to regularly repeating sugar units on pathogen surface (Taylor and Drickamer, 2006) . The second step modelled here is the binding of the virus to its specific receptors on the host cell surface. The approach here is developed for a generic faecal/oral virus such as NoV and rotavirus which infects epithelial cells lining the intestine (Boshuizen et al., 2005; de Rougemont et al., 2011) , but could be applied to influenza A viruses which are inhaled and infect cells of the trachea and lung (de Graaf and Fouchier, 2014) . This paper first gives an overview of a mechanistic dose response model to introduce two probability parameters, namely the fraction, F v , of virus escaping the mucin defense barrier and the fraction, F c , of host cells with bound virus. The Methods section sets out a difference equation method to model F v and F c as a function of the mucin: virus ratio and virus dose in the intestine, respectively. Central to determining F v and F c is the strength of binding of the virus to the mucin and host cell as defined by the equilibrium constants K mucin and K a respectively. In the Theory section, the application of published data on the binding of the virus surface envelop glycoprotein (GP) to host cell receptor (Cr) molecules or to mucin molecules is reviewed in terms of determining K mucin and K a in order to parameterize the dose-response. Particular reference is made to using the dissociation constant K d which is routinely determined experimentally for virus GPs binding to Cr molecules (Gambaryan et al., 2005; Raman et al., 2014; Yuan et al., 2016) . It is then shown how the strength of virus/host cell binding (i.e. the magnitude of K a ) may be predicted from changes in two thermodynamic parameters, namely enthalpy (H) and entropy (S). The effects of amino acid changes at the contact surfaces of the virus GP and Cr on the enthalpy are considered with a view to the future parameterization of dose-response models based on genetic sequencing data. Entropy changes are also considered both in terms of virus binding and also in the interpretation of K d data.",

(7) may be used with [V free ] representing [V intestine ] when the total number of virus particles, V intestine , greatly exceeds the number of host cells (C total ) such that [V free ] is relatively unaffected by virus binding and therefore [V free ] approximates [V intestine ]. This is also acceptable for low binding affinity viruses as in the species barrier model of Gale (2017) such that very little virus is bound even at high virus doses. However, in many natural infection processes (e.g. through drinking water), the host may be challenged by very low numbers of pathogen which bind with high affinity to host cells such that [V free ] is greatly diminished compared to [V intestine ] and tends to zero as all the virus is bound. The problem is that Eq. (7) cannot be expressed mathematically in terms of [V intestine ]. The solution adopted here to model F c in terms of [V intestine ] comprises three steps. The first step involves setting up a model for a host intestine so that the concentrations of virus and host cells may be defined in order to calculate K a using Eq. (5). In the second step, a difference equation approach is used to produce a range of [V free ], [C free ] and [C.V] combinations at six different total virus (V intestine ) doses. From these concentrations, K a values and F c values are calculated and are plotted in Fig. 3 . In the third step, for each of the six V intestine doses, the F c is read off Fig. 3 for given K a values. F c is then plotted against V intestine for each K a in Fig. 2 .",

This is needed to convert particle numbers in moles into concentrations for use in Eq. (5). The volume into which the pathogen enters within the host is for example the lumen of the intestine or even a drop of body fluid (e.g. blood) on a mucosal surface in the case of EBOV. For the purpose of the model, a 100 cm length of host intestine with a radius of 1 cm is simulated. The total surface area is therefore 628.3 cm 2 and the volume inside the intestinal lumen is 0.314 dm 3 (1 dm 3 = 1000 cm 3 ). According to Rosen and Misfeldt (1980) the density of cells in dog kidney epithelia is 6.6 \u00d7 10 5 cells per cm 2 . The total number, C total , of epithelial cells over the 628.3 cm 2 surface of the model intestine is thus 4.15 \u00d7 10 8 , and the density of cells by volume is 1.32 \u00d7 10 9 per dm 3 . Dividing by the Avogadro number, L, of 6.02 \u00d7 10 23 particles per mole (Price and Dwek, 1979) gives a mole concentration by volume [C total ] of total host cells of 2.19 \u00d7 10 \u221215 M. It is reassuring to note that this is similar to the cell concentration of 4.1 \u00d7 10 \u221215 M reported for the canine kidney cells in the avian influenza virus binding experiments of Nunes-Correia et al. (1999) . Handel et al. (2014) in their simulation for influenza virus infection use a concentration which is \u223c100-fold higher although they simply assumed a packed collection of cells each with a volume of 20 \u00b5m 3 . The model here therefore takes into account the large void volume of the intestine within which a faecal-oral pathogen is diluted.",

(11) with [Muc free ] representing the total concentration of mucin in the intestine, [Muc total ], which can be measured in a host experimentally. As discussed below, this fails at mucin: virus ratios of <1:1. Therefore a difference equation approach was used. For this, the challenge dose, V initial , in the host intestine was fixed at 4.15 \u00d7 10 8 virions and the fraction of virus not bound to mucin, F v was then calculated for ten values of Muc total ranging from 10 3 mucin molecules to 4.15 \u00d7 10 12 mucin molecules, representing mucin: virus ratios ranging from 2.4 \u00d7 10 \u22126 :1 to 10,000:1.

The horizontal dotted line in Fig. 1 represents just one free virus remaining in the 0.314 dm 3 volume of the simulated intestine. At values of F v below this line there is < 1 free virus in the simulated intestine and in effect all of the 4.15 \u00d7 10 8 virions in the initial challenge dose (V initial ) are bound to mucin. Thus, the effectiveness of the mucin barrier can be assessed simply in terms of K mucin and the mucin: virus ratio required to bring F v to below this line in Fig. 1 . At the very high K mucin value of 10 22 M \u22121 all of the virus is bound as the mucin: virus ratio exceeds 1:1. However, at progressively lower K mucin values, less and less of the virus is bound at a given mucin: virus ratio. Thus even at K mucin values as high as 10 18 and 10 20 M \u22121 large numbers of viruses (20,330 and 180 respectively) are still free at mucin: virus ratios of 10:1. According to the model in Fig. 1 , in the 0.314 dm 3 volume of simulated intestine, large excesses of mucin over virus are needed to make a significant impact on the fraction of free virus at the lower K mucin values. For example, at K mucin values of 10 13 M \u22121 and 10 11.7 M \u22121 4% and 50% of the virus is free, respectively, at mucin: virus ratios of 1000:1. Thus mopping up virus is relatively inefficient and, except at very high K mucin values, large numbers of virus may break through. This reflects the dilution in the large volume of the simulated intestine. The main conclusion from Fig. 1 is that as the mucin: virus ratio increases from < 1:1 through 1:1 to > 1:1 (i.e. going from left to right along the x-axis) for high K mucin values ( > 10 15 M \u22121 ), then the fraction of free virus falls dramatically and non-linearly, with all of the virus being mopped up at K mucin of \u223c10 22 M \u22121 .",

(11) to model F v in MRA The total mucin: total virus ratio is also expressed as the concentration of total mucin, [Muc total ], on the x-axis scale of Fig. 1 . This is relative to the virus concentration in the intestine which is fixed at 2.2 \u00d7 10 \u221215 M. Thus 4.15 \u00d7 10 8 virus particles in a volume of 0.314 dm 3 on dividing by L represent a concentration of 2.2 \u00d7 10 \u221215 M. The dashed lines in Fig. 1 show F v as calculated by Eq. (11) for each K mucin value using [Muc total ] as an approximation for [Muc free ]. This is an appropriate approximation at high mucin to virus ratios. However, at mucin: virus ratios of < 1:1, [Muc free ] becomes much less than [Muc total ] as all the mucin is bound, particularly at high K mucin values, and Eq. (11) is not applicable. As an example, the arrow in Fig. 1 shows that Eq. (11) predicts that 4.4% of virus is free (i.e. 95.6% of virus is bound) when there is 10,000-fold more virus particles than mucin molecules. This is clearly not possible. At lower K mucin values, F v decreases linearly with increasing mucin: virus ratio and may be modelled by Eq. (11) in good agreement with F v calculated by the difference equation approach (symbols in Fig. 1 ). Thus Eq. (11) holds at low K mucin values or at high mucin: virus ratios (irrespective of K mucin ). This is important because high mucin: virus ratios might be expected in a natural infection situation even with the high virus challenge dose used in the simulation here. From the practical point of developing MRA methodology, applying Eq. (11) is easier than the complicated difference equation approach developed for the symbols in Fig. 1 . Thus understanding the limitations of Eq. (11) is important. In summary Eq. (11) fails at mucin: virus ratios of < 1:1 at the higher K mucin values, as represented by the arrow, but is generally applicable at lower K mucin values particularly at higher mucin: virus ratios. The results show that the value of K mucin is critical not only in determining whether Eq. (11) can be used in MRA but also in assessing how effective the mucin barrier is in mopping up viruses.",

At low K a values (<10 13 M \u22121 ) unrealistically high virus doses (>10 12 ) are required for saturation of the host cells. From Fig. 3 , F c increases linearly with K a at a given virus dose but, not surprisingly, is limited by the virus dose at V intestine : C total ratios of < 1:1. Thus, there are 4.15 \u00d7 10 8 cells in the simulated intestine, and for the virus doses of 10 3 and 10 6 virions, the maximum values achievable for F c are 2.4 \u00d7 10 \u22126 and 2.4 \u00d7 10 \u22123 respectively when all those virions are bound. At K a values of > 10 15 M \u22121 , the binding is so strong that all the virions in the dose are bound (Fig. 3) and F c reaches its plateau. At V intestine : C total ratios > 1 (i.e. the 4.15 \u00d7 10 10 and 4.15 \u00d7 10 11 doses in Fig. 3 representing V intestine : C total ratios of 100:1 and 1000:1, respectively) saturation of the host cells occurs at high K a values with progressively lower K a values required for saturation of the host cells as the virus dose increases. Thus increasing K a above certain values has no effect on F c either because all the viruses are bound at low virus doses (i.e. V intestine : C total ratios < 1) or because all the host cells are saturated at high virus doses (i.e. V intestine : C total ratios > 1). This is borne out in Fig. 2 which shows that for K a values > 10 15 M \u22121 , the dose-response curves are superimposed such that F c is limited by available dose and not by K a . The main conclusion of Figs 2 and 3 is that the value of K a over the range 10 5 to 10 15 M \u22121 is critical in affecting F c .",

Thus the K a is 10 10 M \u22121 for the low affinity binding virus and 10 13 M \u22121 for the high affinity binding virus. These broadly reflect those measured experimentally (Nunes-Correia et al., 1999) for low binding and high affinity binding sites for influenza A virus H5N1 binding to canine kidney cells (Table 3) . Also as discussed below, this difference of 1000-fold in K a could reflect the result of a single amino acid change in the GP or Cr molecule affecting a salt bridge at the GP/Cr interface. For the purpose of the demonstration, p cell is assumed to be 0.1, i.e. a cell with bound virus has a 10% chance of successful infection. For these scenarios, the predicted probability of the host being infected, p host , ranges from 4.4 \u00d7 10 \u22125 to 0.988. F v is constant at 0.19 (Table 2 ) and is calculated using Eq. (11) with a K mucin of 10 9 M \u22121 (at which Eq. (11) is appropriate) and a [Muc free ] of 4.25 \u00d7 10 \u22129 M. This value of [Muc free ] is calculated using a mucin mass concentration of 1.7 mg/ml for saliva (Kejriwal et al., 2014) , a dilution factor of 100-fold in the food or water matrix and a mucin protein molecular weight of 4000,000 Daltons (Kesimer and Sheehan 2012) . It is solely calculated for demonstration purposes in Table 2 in the absence of published data. F c in Table 2 varies for each scenario and is calculated using Eq. (7) with [V free ] calculated from V intestine (in the 0.314 dm 3 volume of the simulated intestine) and L. The values of K a used in these scenarios are low enough such that Eq. (7) is applicable (see above) as can be seen for the K a = 10 13 M \u22121 line from the difference equation approach in Fig. 2 where F c \u223c 1.0 \u00d7 10 \u22127 for a V intestine of 1904 virions in agreement with Table 2 .",

Thus, Yuan et al. (2015) immobilized EBOV-GP to a chip and used SPR to measure a K d of 2.67 \u00d7 10 \u22125 (M) for binding of soluble human TIM-1 from solution. EBOV entry involves a second GP/Cr binding step within the endosome in which the GP binds to the host Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1) protein. Using SPR, Wang et al. (2016) reported a K d of 1.58 \u00d7 10 \u22124 (M) for EBOV GP binding to human NPC1. These binding affinities for EBOV GP are much weaker than that for MERS-CoV binding to its cellular receptor CD26 for which the K d was 1.67 \u00d7 10 \u22128 (M) as measured by SPR (Lu et al., 2013) . Raman et al. (2014) summarise K d s for influenza virus HA binding to host cell glycans on human tracheal and alveolar sections. Some HAs bind to human receptors with K d s in the 10 \u221212 M range, while others show K d s of \u223c10 \u22129 M. Gambaryan et al. (2005) present K d s for binding of H1 and H3 influenza viruses to glycans, typically in the range of 10 -100 \u00d7 10 \u22129 M.",

However, the reciprocal K d values measured by SPR for the GP/Cr interaction cannot directly be used as the K a values in Figs. 2 and 3. This is because K d as measured by SPR does not take into account the number of GP/Cr contacts per virus/cell interaction and also does not allow for any changes in the entropy (S) on the binding and immobilization of a whole virus particle to a cell (discussed below). For example, Beniac et al. (2012) calculated that an EBOV virion filament of 982 nm in length would have about 1888 copies of the GP spike protein and could therefore make multiple contacts with Cr molecules on the host cell surface. The change in Gibbs free energy (\u0394G d ) for dissociation of one mole of GP/Cr contacts is related to K d (Price and Dwek, 1979; Kastrits and Bonvin, 2013) ",

Therefore in principle knowing \u0394H a and \u0394S a would enable calculation of K a and hence F c for a given dose of virus from Fig. 2 . Bostrom et al. (2011) demonstrated how the binding affinity of an antibody could be broken down into the enthalpy and entropy terms. How this approach could be applied to a virus during infection with the aim of calibrating dose-response models is summarized as Approach 3 in Table 3 . To the author's knowledge there are no data for \u0394H a and \u0394S a for viruses binding to host cells. However, Carneiro et al. (2002) measured the forces between vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and an artificial phospholipid (PL) bilayer (as opposed to a host cell) and obtained values for \u0394H a and \u0394S a of \u22124958 kJ/mol and = \u221216,062 J/ mol/K respectively. Carneiro et al. (2002) Approaches 2 and 3 in Table 3 are dependent on estimating \u0394S a . As shown by Carneiro et al. (2002) for VSV binding to PL bilayers, the decrease in entropy is huge (Table 3) , demonstrating the importance of understanding \u0394S a in estimating K a . Unlike \u0394H a which is based on molecular contacts at the binding faces, \u0394S a involves changes in order and mobility and is difficult to visualise, but may be broken down into a number of components which act additively (Bostrom et al., 2011) .

Viral proteins are rich in intrinsic disorder (Dolan et al., 2015) and intrinsically disordered proteins serve as host cell receptors for viruses. An example is the ephrin receptor ligand binding domain (Fong et al., 2009 ) which also serves as receptor for Hendra virus (HeV) and NiV (Xu et al., 2012) . Thus the unbound ephrin receptor contains partially disordered loops. In the complex (bound to ephrin) these loops are ordered to form the ligand-binding channel (Fong et al., 2009) . This raises the question of whether the ephrin receptor undergoes a disorder-to-order transition on HeV/NiV binding. Interestingly Xu et al. (2012) show from the X-ray crystal structure that the binding of HeV G protein involves the movement of a tryptophan \"latch\" on the ephrin-B2 receptor. There would be a change in the conformational entropy \u0394S conf associated with this during formation of the HeV G protein/ephrin-B2 receptor complex.",

            "text": "According to Eq. (17), increasing the number of GP/Cr contacts during virus binding increases K a and hence the infectivity according to Fig. 3 . Counterintuitively, in the case of EBOV GP pseudoviruses, increasing the surface density of GP actually decreases the infectivity by about 10-fold, perhaps reflecting steric hindrance from tightly packed GP proteins (Mohan et al., 2015) blocking a conformational change that gives an increase in \u0394S conf required for binding of GP to TIM-1 (Gale, 2017) . This is consistent with the observation that EBOV GPs are well separated in space on the EBOV filament surface (Beniac et al., 2012) thus allowing plenty of space for conformational changes without steric hindrance. A demonstration of how changes in \u0394S conf could explain the 10-fold increase in infectivity reported by Mohan et al. (2015) on decreasing the GP density may be explored with Eq. (19) . Thus increasing \u0394S a by 20 J/mol/K (irrespective of the values of \u0394H a and T) increases K a by 11-fold. A decrease in conformational entropy (\u0394S conf ) due to steric hindrance of 20 J/mol/K represents the ordering of just four amino acid residues on the basis of the \u22126.1 J/ mol/K per residue proposed by Rajasekaran et al. (2016) for disordered proteins. Therefore blocking the disordering of just four amino acids in the EBOV GP could explain the 10-fold decrease in infectivity of EBOV GP pseudoviruses with high GP densities. Booth et al. (2013) show that filovirus filaments are very flexible, more flexible than filamentous paramyxoviruses and much more flexible than rhabdoviruses. Thus a flexible filament, making multiple GP/ Cr contacts, can adopt many more conformations in 2D-space when bound to a host cell surface than a rigid rod of the same length. A bound filament will therefore have a higher entropy than a stiff rod, and will have a higher K a . A flexible filament can also test out multiple GP/Cr contacts, thus maximising contacts and making \u0394H a more negative in magnitude which increases K a according to Eq. (19). Indeed Booth et al. (2013) suggest that the extreme aspect ratio of filaments may be an adaptation that enhances cellular attachment.",

Consideration of \u0394S rt may be of particular importance for binding of filoviruses (Gale, 2017) which comprise repeating modular units linked together into single very long filaments (Beniac et al., 2012; Booth et al., 2013) . Thus Gale (2017) argued that the prior immobilisation of multiple virus units through linking together into a polyploid filament enhanced cell binding compared to that of single virus units in the case of filoviruses through a less unfavourable \u0394S rt term. Furthermore for this reason, natural polyploid filovirus filaments may bind more strongly to cells than suggested by results from experiments to determine filovirus infectivity using EBOV GP-expressing pseudoviruses, which are spherical and single.",

            "text": "4.3. Using enthalpy to relate changes in amino acid sequence at the binding faces of the virus GP and host receptor protein to a change in K a While lack of data on \u0394H a limits the use of Approach 3 in Table 3 to determine K a , Eq. (19) may be applied to determine the impact of amino acid changes in GP and Cr on K a and hence link genetic sequencing data to the risk of infection. The ultimate aim would be to predict how such sequence changes affect infectivity, host range and jumping the species barrier from the perspective of the dose-response. This could include assessing the relative risk of novel strains of virus with mutations in the GP and also assessing the risk of a \"standard\" virus jumping the species barrier into a novel host which may have amino acid differences in its Cr relative to the \"standard\" host. The starting point is having information on the infectivity of the \"standard\" virus in the \"standard\" host and also crystal structure data of the \"standard\" virus GP bound to the \"standard\" host Cr. Crystal structure data are available for a number of viral GPs docked to their human host cell Cr at atomic detail including EBOV and MERS-CoV (Zhao et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2016; Lu et al., 2013) . Knowing the crystal structure of the GP/Cr protein complex assists in understanding how changes in amino acids at the binding interface of GP and Cr affect \u0394H a and hence K a through Eq. (19). Thus although \u0394H a itself may not be known, it may be possible to predict the change in \u0394H a (i.e. \u0394\u0394H a ) for an amino acid substitution from basic biophysics knowledge of the energies of the intermolecular forces that hold proteins together. These are typically salt bridges and hydrogen bonds as shown for MERS-CoV bound to its Cr (Lu et al., 2013) . An example of how this could be applied is demonstrated in Table 5 for changing amino acids involved in salt bridges. In a salt bridge a negatively charged amino acid residue on one protein interacts electrostatically with a positively charged residue on the other protein resulting in a strong attraction. Salt bridges, e.g. between histidine 30 (positively charged) and aspartate (Asp) 70 (negatively charged) in bacteriophage T4 lysozyme contribute \u221211 to \u221221 kJ/mol to \u0394G (Anderson et al., 1990; Dong and Zhou, 2002) . For the purpose of the demonstration in Table 5 it is assumed that the \u0394H a for a salt bridge formation is \u221217.8 kJ/mol as this gives a 1000-fold change in K a (Price and Dwek 1979) for each salt bridge removed or added through mutation. Proximity of two residues of the same charge results in electrostatic repulsion as in Scenarios A and B which represent viruses with very weak affinities for the host. Scenarios D and E represent viruses which have adapted to the host with hugely increased affinities. Scenarios A and E are only two mutations away from each other. Thus changing two positively charged amino acids (Scenario A) into negatively charged amino acids (Scenario E) could increase K a by 10 12 -fold.",

Thus, EBOV Makona in the 2013 West Africa outbreak adapted to humans (and in doing so became less infectious to bats) through substituting alanine (A) with valine (V) at residue 82 of the GP (Diehl et al., 2016; Urbanowicz et al., 2016) . This is referred to as the A82V substitution. However, the changes in infectivity to humans (as measured by EBOV GP pseudoviruses infecting human cell lines) appear to be relatively small and in the range of 2-fold to 4-fold. A 4-fold increase in infectivity due to a 4-fold increase in F c in Fig. 3 would reflect a 4-fold increase in K a , and a change in \u0394G a according to Eq. (18) of \u22123.6 kJ/mol. This would probably reflect changes in \u0394H a (and not the T.\u0394S a term) since residue 82 on the EBOV GP is between residues 80 and 83 which make multiple atom contacts directly with six surface residues on the NPC1 protein (Wang et al., 2016) . Thus, the A82V substitution in the GP may change \u0394H a by \u223c\u22123.6 kJ/mol on the basis of measured changes in infectivity. This relatively small change (compared to the \u221211 to \u221221 kJ/mol for a salt bridge) is consistent with the chemical similarity of alanine and valine.",

The natural presence of phenylalanine (Phe) at residue 502 (instead of Asp) in the NPC1 of the African Straw-coloured fruit bat (Eidolon helvum) appears to protect this species from EBOV (Ng et al., 2015) . Indeed, replacing Phe at residue 502 of E. helvum NPC1 with Asp completely restored its binding to EBOV GP (Ng et al., 2015) . From the X-ray structure, the presence of Phe at residue 502 of the NPC1 in E. helvum would cause severe clashes on binding EBOV GP (Zhao et al., 2016) such that \u0394H a in the E. helvum NPC1/EBOV GP complex would be significantly less negative than that for binding to human NPC1 and perhaps even positive (reflecting a repulsion). Indeed, determining \u0394\u0394H a would enable the effect of the Asp to Phe substitution at residue 502 on K a and hence on the infectivity of EBOV to E. helvum to be assessed through Eq.

(2016) demonstrated that the efficiency of entry of EBOV-GP VSV pseudovirus into E. helvum cell lines was markedly reduced compared to that with GPs from other filoviruses and at standard virus levels no infection was detected. However, at high levels of (i.e. undiluted) virus, EBOV-GP VSV pseudovirus did show significantly increased infection compared to the negative controls. Thus EBOV GP is capable of mediating entry into E. helvum cells, albeit with low efficiency. This is entirely consistent with the dose-response model simulated in Fig. 2 which predicts for low K a s (10 5 -10 7 M \u22121 ) that very small fractions (10 \u22127 to 10 \u22125 ) of the host cells have bound virus at very high virus doses, i.e. 10 11 to 10 12 . Thus some infection would be expected in E. helvum on the basis of Eqs. (2) and (3) and the probability of infection which, although low at low K a values, would never be zero because there is no threshold K a below which binding does not occur (Fig. 3) . Supporting this, Hayman et al. (2010) reported EBOV antibodies in one of 256 E. helvum bats tested in Ghana and suggested this resulted from EBOV infection.",

Lectins are proteins which bind selective glycan groups (Taylor and Drickamer, 2006) . Viruses such as influenza virus, NoV and rotavirus behave as lectins by binding selectively to glycans. Indeed, K mucin is related to the number of lectin/glycan interactions and their respective K d s in the same way as K a according to Eq. (17). Dam and Brewer (2010) report K d s of 2.0 \u00d7 10 \u221210 M for the lectin soy bean agglutinin binding to porcine submaxillary mucin which has multiple GalNAc sugars to bind. Similarly Vataira macrocarpa lectin has a K d of 1.0 \u00d7 10 \u221210 M with porcine submaxillary mucin. Acting singly (i.e. using n = 1 in Eq.

(17), a three way interaction involving three binding sites with K d s of 1.0 \u00d7 10 \u22123 M can result in an overall K a of up to 1.0 \u00d7 10 9 M \u22121 for a multivalent ligand (i.e. pathogen surface) with appropriately spaced terminal sugar residues (Taylor and Drickamer, 2006) . In the case of influenza virus A, the binding site of each HA polypeptide is relatively shallow and interacts primarily with the terminal sialic acid residues linked to galactose (Taylor and Drickamer, 2006) . The affinity for monomeric sialosides is weak (K d \u223c10 \u22123 M), but binding to cell surfaces is enhanced by the simultaneous interaction of multiple HA-binding sites with multiple sialic acid residues on the target host cell (Taylor and Drickamer, 2006) . The cumulative effect of n binding sites each with the same K d is given by the n th power (Eq. (17)). Thus seven interactions with K d \u223c10 \u22123 M, for example, would give a K a \u223c10 21 M \u22121 . It is concluded that mucins and MBP PRRs of the innate immune system could bind virus with sufficient affinity such that slight mucin excesses could remove all the virus (Fig. 1) . Furthermore, K mucin could become higher if the virus were irreversibly bound for example by being \"folded in\" to the inside of mucous droplets such that it can no longer exchange with free virus on the outside. In effect k off would tend to 0 in Eq. (6) and hence K mucin would tend to infinity. It should be noted that the magnitude of K d (and hence K a and K mucin ) is constant for a given molecular interaction at a given temperature. However, the magnitude of K mucin may change during the infection process through both host mechanisms and virus mechanisms as is now discussed.",

(2014) use differential equations to model how sticky an influenza virus should be to maximize fitness, with stickiness representing the balance between attachment and detachment. Shanker et al.

The work here appears to demonstrate that stochasticity in the mechanistic model is not an issue.

Approach 3 (Table 3 ) which uses Eq. (19) to calculate K a is limited by the current lack of data for \u0394H a and \u0394S a for the virus/host cell interaction and Approach 2 using published K d data should therefore be pursued in the absence of experimental K a data from Approach 1. While data are available for K d for GP/Cr binding for several viruses, Approach 2 using Eq. (17) to estimate K a is also limited by lack of information on \u0394S a for binding of the whole virus to cells. This is important because the magnitude of \u0394S a for immobilization of a whole virus is likely to be huge as demonstrated for VSV binding to artificial PL bilayers (Table 3) . Lack of information on \u0394S a is therefore a major data gap, and furthermore may also have wider implications in affecting our ability to interpret measured K d values in terms of the actual infectivity of the virus. Thus it is the K a as determined by Eq. (17) taking into account \u0394S a for whole virus binding which defines infectivity (see results from Table 2 ) and not the K d alone. This is because \u0394S a for binding of the whole virus to cells will be much greater than the \u0394S a for binding of a soluble protein fragment as in K d determinations by SPR. Indeed the \u0394S a for binding of VSV is a huge \u221216,062 J/mol/K compared to the \u0394S rt and \u0394S conf terms for binding of an antibody to its antigen (Table 3) which is comparable to GP binding to its Cr in terms of molecular sizes.",

            "text": "The model developed here based on Eq. (4) does not allow for multiple virus particles to bind to a single host cell. However, the cell membrane of the host cell typically contains many copies of Cr and in theory each host cell could therefore bind multiple copies of the virus. Furthermore, the virus particles themselves could be ingested as a clump. Indeed in the case of EBOV, many genome copies may be linked together into long polyploid filaments (Beniac et al., 2012) which could affect the thermodynamics of binding (Gale 2017) . Eq. (4) could be modified to accommodate multiple viruses binding to a single host cell (as described for ligands binding to a protein by Price and Dwek (1979) ) if the number of Crs per host cell is known. It should be stressed that homogeneity in both the mucin and pathogen is assumed here for simplicity. In further developing this mechanistic model, data would be needed not only on the heterogeneity of the mucin concentration but also on the statistical distribution for the number of viruses bound per cell. For example the distribution could be Poisson such that for a ratio of 1 virus bound per host cell (representing a high V intestine ), some host cells have zero, most have one while a few have two, three or even four viruses bound. Alternatively the distribution could be over-dispersed, such that a few host cells have thousands of bound virus while most have none. Clearly, over-dispersion would decrease C.V compared to the Poisson distribution. In the model presented here for demonstrating proof of principle, the modelling of F c as function of V intestine assumes each host cell binds just one virus through Eq. (4). This is appropriate for two reasons. First, exposure to faecal/oral pathogens through routes such as water may involve very low numbers of pathogen per person (see Gale 2017) , such that it would be unlikely that more than one pathogen would bind to the same host cell. Second, it maximises C.V and hence p host . Thus, the binding of more than one virus to a host cell may be waste of virus resource because C.V in Eq. 2 is not maximised. Binding of two viruses to the same cell will not affect p cell , unless there is co-operation between the two viruses in some way, such that one facilitates infection by the other. In this sense, the value of p host predicted through the mechanistic dose-response here is worst case. It should be noted that Gale (2017) proposed that formation of polyploid filaments in the case of EBOV did indeed enhance cell binding by optimising \u0394S a , in effect representing a co-operation between viral particles in the infection process. This demonstrates the importance of not only considering the statistical distribution aspects of virus clumps but also the thermodynamic implications on their binding.",

The range for which K mucin is biologically significant is < 10 22 (M \u22121 ); 10 22 being the K mucin value at which there is no free virus at mucin: virus ratios > 1:1 according to the simulation in Fig. 1 . Values for K mucin could be high due to multiple contacts with repeating units and \"folding in\" of bound virus into the interior of the mucus. Reading the x-axis from right to left in Fig. 1 suggests a threshold effect for virus dose, as the binding capacity of the mucin is exceeded at high virus doses. This is not considered further here, but is of interest for the development of MRA which generally assumes there is no threshold dose. The approach developed here in Fig. 1 for mucins could also be applied to modelling the probability of the virus being inactivated by other components of the host innate immune system such as the PRRs, which include the MBP, which recognize repeating units on the pathogen surface. Once bound to the MBP, the virus would be taken up (phagocytosis) through the complement system by macrophages and destroyed (Taylor and Drickamer, 2006) .",

            "text": "The probability of a host cell having bound virus (as represented by F c ) increases linearly with dose (Fig. 2) . The biologically significant range for K a is \u232910 15 (M \u22121 ) within which F c increases linearly with increasing K a (Fig. 3) . K d values measured by SPR are in the 10 \u22129 M-10 \u221212 M range for GP/Cr interactions for MERS-CoV and influenza virus suggesting very strong binding (Lu et al., 2013; Raman et al., 2014) . Even for EBOV GP with K d s in the 10 \u22124 to 10 \u22125 M range (Yuan et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2016) , high K a values could be achieved through multiple contacts (Eq. (17)) although this may be offset by the \u0394S a term (as discussed above). Increasing the K a above 10 15 M \u22121 does not further increase the fraction (F c ) of host cells with bound virus (Fig. 3) such that F c versus virus dose curves are superimposed in Fig. 2 at K a \u232a 10 15 M \u22121 . At such high K a s, receptor binding is not likely to be rate-limiting in the infection process. Thus Xu et al. (2012) found that the stability of the HeV-G/ephrin-B2 association does not strongly correlate with the efficiency of viral entry, suggesting that, for ephrin-B2-expressing cells, viral attachment is not the rate limiting step in the viral entry process. This is consistent with highly efficient binding (i.e. large K a ) such that further increasing K a does not increase the fraction of cells with bound virus, F c , according to Fig. 3 . Hence C.V (through Eq. (3)) is constant and not rate-limiting, while a subsequent part of the infection process accommodated in p cell is less efficient than F c , such that p cell is very small and controls the overall value of p host according to Eq. (2). Indeed, the magnitude of K a is much more important when receptor binding is inefficient such as in the jumping of the species barrier into a novel host by an emerging virus as suggested by Gale (2017) . This is confirmed by Fig. 3 with F c increasing linearly with K a at lower K a values. Gale (2017) demonstrated that virus binding to its receptor is only important in controlling the probability of infection of a host cell if it is a major barrier, i.e. relatively inefficient. The K a for a virus jumping the species barrier into a novel host species would be expected to be very low perhaps due to electrostatic repulsion as for Scenarios A and B in Table 5 . The subsequent adaptation of the virus to its new host through mutation would increase K a as suggested here in Table 5 and reported for EBOV in humans (Diehl et al., 2016; Urbanowicz et al., 2016) .",

As shown in Table 5 , changes in \u0394H a (\u0394\u0394H a ) may be used to predict changes in K a providing the molecular basis of the GP/Cr interaction is available at atomic detail to enable some assessment of \u0394\u0394H a . The infectivity of the new virus/ host combination relative to the \"standard\" virus/host would be directly proportional to the change in K a (as demonstrated from results in Table 2 ). Thus, thermodynamics provides the link between changes in the virus/host identified through sequencing data and the risk of infection. This in theory allows predictions of the infectivity of emerging virus strains or the susceptibility of novel hosts to be assessed on the basis of the effects of changes in sequence data. It is concluded that thermodynamic approaches have a major contribution to make in developing dose-response models for emerging viruses.",
