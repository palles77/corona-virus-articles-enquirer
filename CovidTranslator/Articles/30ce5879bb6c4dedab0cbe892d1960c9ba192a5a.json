The potential of intracellular antibodies for the systematic study of the proteome has been made possible by the development of new experimental strategies that allow the selection of antibodies under conditions of intracellular expression. The Intracellular Antibody Capture Technology (IACT) is an in vivo two-hybrid-based method originally developed for the selection of antibodies readily folded for ectopic expression. IACT has been used for the rapid and effective identification of novel antigen -antibody pairs in intracellular compartments and for the in vivo identification of epitopes recognized by selected intracellular antibodies. IACT opens the way to the use of intracellular antibody technology for large-scale applications in proteomics. In its present format, its use is however somewhat limited by the need of a preselection of the input phage antibody libraries on protein antigens or by the construction of an antibody library from mice immunized against the target protein(s), to provide an enriched input library to compensate for the suboptimal efficiency of transformation of the yeast cells. These enrichment steps require expressing the corresponding proteins, which represents a severe bottleneck for the scaling up of the technology.",

As intrabodies are derived from the virtually unlimited repertoire of antibodies, there are basically no limitations on the choice of target molecule. Other strategies for the inactivation of specific intracellular proteins are being developed. Among these, RNA interference (RNAi) is generating growing interest. The RNAi approach, however, is limited by incomplete RNA cleavage, inaccessible RNA sequences and proteins with a long half-life. In addition, RNAi cannot be used to target specifically individual protein -protein interactions or post-translational modifications of proteins. With intracellular antibodies, it is possible to develop a reagent that prevents particular associations but spares others. Last but not least, once an intrabody has been developed, able to inhibit a cellular function, it provides a direct biochemical handle on the recognized protein and its binding partners. Intrabodies have therefore a great added value for functional proteomics and the study of proteinprotein interactions.",

Moreover, it became clear that being a ''good intracellular antibody'' requires the concomitant optimization of a complex list of properties, including stability, in vivo half-life, solubility, propensity to aggregate, affinity and specificity (Cattaneo and Biocca, 1999) . A ''good intracellular antibody'' is defined as an antibody that is able to fold tolerating the conditions found in the cell cytoplasm and to have an affinity high enough to interact effectively with its target antigen. Rather than attempting to rationally engineer antibodies with these properties, we showed recently that in vivo selection processes can be applied to rapidly and effectively select intrabodies against several targets (Visintin et al., 1999 (Visintin et al., , 2002 Tse et al., 2002) . This yeast twohybrid-based technology named Intracellular Antibody Capture Technology (IACT) (Visintin et al., 2002) proved to be a valuable method for the selection of intracellular antibodies on the basis of their ability to bind antigen intracellularly. Most importantly, we and others showed that the selection of an antibody by IACT is a good and reliable predictor for being a reliable intrabody in mammalian cells (Visintin et al., 1999 (Visintin et al., , 2002 Tse et al., 2002) .",

It is therefore very important to further optimize the selection procedure to isolate validated intracellular antibodies and to remove residual limitations to the present selection technologies. In its present implementation, IACT uses sources of antibody variable regions genes that have been independently generated (Fig. 1 ). In these repertoires, ''good intracellular antibodies'' are a subset of the total antibody repertoire. The large size of these libraries, together with the limited efficiency of DNA transformation in yeast cells (required for the intracellular selection step), requires necessarily some preselection or enrichment step, in order to reduce the size of the input library to a complexity compatible with its downstream expression in yeast cells. Indeed when making intracellular antibody libraries for IACT selection, V genes might be derived from lymphocytes which may have undergone antigen stimulation (Vascotto et al., submitted for publication) or from the results of a phage antibody library selection (Visintin et al., 2002) . In the former case, antigen immunization represent the enrichment step (Vascotto et al., submitted for publication) while in the latter case one cycle of in vitro panning on antigen columns is required (Visintin et al., 2002) . High-throughput ''from gene to intrabody'' approaches would require immunization or preselection to be bypassed.",

It is also obvious that the real diversity of a library must take into account the number of correctly assembled scFv, the number of frame shift, deletions or stop codons present in the V gene sequences and other quality related factors (Knappik et al., 2000) . Therefore the important parameter is the diversity of functional antibodies in the library, rather than the nominal diversity of the library. This parameter must be evaluated for all the libraries constructed. Indeed non-functional antibody fragments drastically lower the true size of the library, normally evaluated by counting the number of colonies after DNA transformation.",

For example, the affinity of Pro-rich peptide sequences for the SH3 domain is relatively weak (5 -100 AM) (Dalgarno et al., 1997; Zucconi et al., 2001) , suggesting that an intracellular inhibitor would not need a very high affinity to compete with the ligand -SH3 interaction motifs. We demonstrated that intracellular antibodies with affinities in the range of 100 nM could effectively divert their target antigens from their natural intracellular environments thereby inhibiting it (Visintin et al., 2002) . In general, intracellular antibodies with affinity in the micromolar/nanomolar range have been shown to be effective intracellular inhibitors (Cattaneo and Biocca, 1997) . In fact, choosing an antibody based on a higher affinity in vitro alone is a poor predictor of its function as an intrabody in vivo and half-life and stability of intracellular antibodies have been shown to be more relevant for good intracellular inhibition than affinity per se (Zhu et al., 1999) , (Rajpal and Turi, 2001; Arafat et al., 2000) . In addition, the precise subcellular targeting of antibodies increases the local concentration of the two interactors, compensating for lower affinity.",

By virtue of its PTB and SH2 domains, Shc proteins link receptor and nonreceptor tyrosine kinase activation to downstream cytoplasmic effectors and can bind to activated receptors that have been tyrosine-phosphorylated. This protein is implicated in pathways activated by environmental stress and regulation of life-span. Human K-Ras is a monomeric membrane-localized small 21 kDa G protein that functions as a molecular switch for cytoplasm to nuclear signalling (Ehrhardt et al., 2002) . The ras-signalling pathway is an attractive target for anticancer therapy because of its important role in carcinogenesis. Syk protein-tyrosine kinase has been implicated in a variety of haematopoietic cell responses, in particular immunoreceptor signalling events that mediate diverse cellular responses including proliferation, differentiation, and phagocytosis. Syk appears also to play a general physiological function in a wide variety of cells including neuronal cells in which it is suggested to play an important role in signalling steps to neurite extension (Yanagi et al., 2001) . Thymosin h4 encodes both an ubiquitous actinbinding protein (UTh4) with demonstrated capacity to inhibit neutrophilic infiltration, and a splicevariant limited to lymphoid tissue (LTh4) that was shown to be expressed in activated dendritic epidermal T cells, and other intraepithelial lymphocytes, to down-regulate local inflammation (Girardi et al., 2003) . Fig. 2 . Construction of SPLINT. Mouse V genes were amplified with degenerated primers from total cDNA. A second PCR generated products with common 5Vand 3Vf 30-nucleotide tails. The common 3Vf 30-nucleotide ends allow assembly of full scFv genes and the common 5Vends allow the cloning into linearized pLinker220 vectors into BssHII and NheI restriction sites. Fig. 3 . SPLINT vectors. pLinker220 vector used for expression of SPLINT library as fusion to the VP16 activation domain. The LEU2 gene permits maintenance of the plasmid and selection on media lacking leucine in yeast strain L40. The bla gene permits the selection of plasmid in E.coli. pMIC-BD 1 and 2 vectors are derivative of pBTM116. They use the strong alcohol dehydrogenase promoter (ADH1) to express bait proteins as fusions to the DNA-binding protein lexA. The plasmids contain the TRP1 selectable marker and the 2 Am origin of replication to allow propagation in yeast, and the chloramphenicol resistance gene (Cam) to allow the selection in E. coli. Codons CGC and AAA of lexA within pMIC-BD1 were mutated to GGC and GAA, respectively, generating mutlexA and converting pMIC-BD1 in pMIC-BD2.",

The procedure has been experimentally optimized and refined and is very robust, rapid and efficient. In some situations, it may be useful to push the selection conditions further, to fish out very strong binders and to improve the stringency of selections. To this aim, we engineered a modified LexA bait: the bacterial LexA protein of pMIC-BD1 vector was modified (mLexA) to abolish its intrinsic NLS, as previously described (Rhee et al., 2000) (Fig.  3) . In this modified format, the NLS is provided only by the antibody ''prey'' vector. To verify whether it would be possible to screen SPLINT also with antigen expressed only in the yeast cytoplasm (as in the case with the pMIC-BD2 vector), we chose the protein K-RAS as target antigen. The choice of RAS was also due to the apparent difficulty of isolating intracellular antibodies in the standard selection procedure (Table  2 ). In this modified selection procedure, the interaction between the antigen and the scFv must occur in the cytoplasm, because the antigen is expressed in yeast cells without the intrinsic nuclear localization signal of lexA. ScFv and antigen interact in the cell cytoplasm before the complex is translocated into the nucleus and activates transcription (Fig. 7) . We tried in parallel the selection of anti K-RAS antibodies as lexA-bait fusion protein with or without nuclear localization signal. In both cases, we obtained the same number of functional anti K-RAS intracellular antibodies.",

            "text": "Contrary to previous expectations, there are enough well-behaved intracellularly stable antibodies in a small na\u00efve library of 10 7 transformants, grown in this format, to select functional binders under the relatively low affinity selection conditions which yeast twohybrid provides. This certainly contrasts with the well-established observation (Visintin et al., 2002; Tse et al., 2002 ) that a very high proportion of ELISA-positive antigen-specific scFv fragments isolated from phage display libraries fail to pass the in vivo IACT selection against the same antigen. How can we interpret these results? First of all, it is possible (although unlikely) that phage display selects antibodies that are particularly unsuitable for intracellular expression, as opposed to antibodies that are directly derived from natural repertoires, with no intermediate selection. Second, unfolded or aggregating antibodies certainly provide a growth disadvantage to cells, and this is likely to contribute a background of antigenindependent selection that provides an enrichment for functional intrabodies in the SPLINT library, which are then selected in an antigen-dependent way. Third, the relatively lower affinity requirement for intrabodies reduce the size of the library necessary to isolate intracellular binders. Fourth, it is well established that half the antibodies expressed in human early B cell compartments are polyreactive, and a high proportion of the polyreactive antibodies are counterselected during B cell differentiation (Wardemann et al., 2003) . A high frequency of polyreactive clones in the na\u00efve antibody population used to construct the present SPLINT could in part explain the success in isolating antibodies against all antigens, although our secondary screening results (see Fig. 5 ) show that specific antibodies can indeed be readily found from SPLINT. Last but not least, it is possible that the effective diversity of the library is actually higher than the initial number of yeast transformants, if more than one scFv is expressed in any given cell, and this may or may not result in further recombination events and in segregation of different scFvs in daughter cells. The latter point, presently being carefully evaluated, could easily contribute to an increase of the effective diversity by a factor 10 or more, and under the selective pressure of IACT this may then lead to the selective isolation of one antigen-specific scFv fragment.",

Spleens were teased apart using forceps and sterile needle to produce a single cell suspension. Lymphocytes were used immediately for RNA preparation (Qiagen). cDNA was synthesized using random hexamers and reverse transcriptase following standard protocols. VE, VK and VH regions from random-primed cDNA were amplified using a modified version of primers described (Orlandi et al., 1992) . VH and VL genes were re-amplified to add a region of overlap in the scFv linker as well as long tails to facilitate restriction enzyme digestion. The scFv were assembled by mixing equimolar amount of VH and VL genes and performing assembly as previously described (Krebber et al., 1997) . The scFv obtained were cloned into BssHII/NheI-digested pLinker220 to obtain a library of f 10 7 different clones in L40 yeast cells. SPLINT library was transformed into L40 yeast strain by using a rearranged lithium acetate transformation protocol (Visintin and Cattaneo, 2001) . SPLINT library and a panel of baits were cotransformed into yeast cells as described (Visintin and Cattaneo, 2001; Visintin et al., 2002) .
