In infected cells, the CoV RNA-23 synthesizing machinery associates with modified endoplasmic reticulum membranes that are 24 transformed into the viral replication organelle (RO). While double-membrane vesicles 25 (DMVs) appear to be a pan-coronavirus RO element, studies to date describe an assortment The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.24.005298 doi: bioRxiv preprint 4 DMVs would pose the conundrum of how metabolites and newly made genomic and 64 subgenomic mRNAs could be transported across the double-lipid bilayer. Nevertheless, 65 experimental evidence for the location of vRNA synthesis within the RO was lacking. 66 Importantly, dsRNA is not a bona fide marker for vRNA synthesis as it may no longer be 67 associated with the active enzymatic replication complexes in which most of the 16 viral non-68 structural proteins (nsps) come together. Thus, the possibility of vRNA synthesis taking place 69 in alternative locations, like the convoluted membranes (CM) that are also prominent 70 elements of the beta-CoV RO [15, 20, 21] , was entirely possible and started to attract 71 attention. Notably, DMVs can be also formed in the absence of vRNA synthesis by 72 expression of key transmembrane nsps [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] . Moreover, several studies suggested a lack of 73 direct correlation between the number of DMVs and the level of CoV replication in the 74 infected cell [27, 28] . 75 The interpretation of the CoV RO structure and function was further compounded by the 76 discovery of different RO elements, never reported in beta-CoV infections, that set apart 77 other distantly-related CoVs genera. In particular, zippered ER (instead of CM) and double-78 membrane spherules (DMSs) were detected for the avian gamma-CoV infectious bronchitis 79 virus (IBV) [29] and, recently, for the porcine deltacoronavirus [30] . The size and topology 80 of these DMSs, invaginations in the zippered ER, were remarkably similar to those of the 81 spherular invaginations induced by other +RNA viruses and, consequently, DMSs were 82 suggested to be sites of vRNA synthesis [29, 31] . 83 In this work, we provide an in-depth analysis of the structure and function of the RO induced 84 by members of different CoV genera, with a special focus on beta-CoVs like SARS-CoV and 85 MERS-CoV (Middle East respiratory syndrome-CoV) [32, 33] ",

Strikingly, in addition to the DMVs and CM that are well established hallmarks of 110 beta-CoV infections, the presence of small spherules, occasionally in large numbers, was 111 readily apparent (Fig 1A and 1B) . These spherules were notably similar to the DMSs 112 previously described for the gamma-CoV IBV [29] . Their remarkably regular size of ~80 nm 113 (average diameter 79.8 \u00b1 2.5 nm, n=58), a delimiting double membrane and their electron-114 dense content, made these spherules clearly distinct from other structures, including progeny 115 virions, which had comparable diameter (Fig 1C and 1D ). The double-membrane spherules 116 (DMSs) generated during IBV infection were previously described as invaginations of the 117 zippered ER that remain open to the cytosol [29] . In MERS-CoV-infected cells, the DMSs 118 were connected to the CM from which they seemed to derive ( Fig 1E) . Clear openings to the 119 cytosol could not be detected for the large majority (~80%, n=54) of the fully reconstructed 120 DMSs, which suggests that the original invagination may eventually transform into a sealed 121 compartment. This type of apparently closed DMSs were also present, though in a lower 122 proportion (~50%, n=39), in IBV-infected cell samples processed in an identical manner (S1 The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.24.005298 doi: bioRxiv preprint (right) of a representative area containing the different types of MERS-CoV-induced membrane 130 modifications: DMSs (orange), convoluted membranes (CM, blue) and DMVs (yellow and lilac, outer 131 and inner membranes).

Similarly, 358 nsp3 mapped to the CM induced in MERS-CoV infection, but also to the DMSs to a 359 comparable extent (Fig 6G) . Our attempts to combine dsRNA antibody labelling with thawed 360 cryo-sections were unsuccessful, which made us resort to HPF-FS samples. In these, 361 however, while DMVs were easily detected, the morphology of CM and DMSs was less 362 clearly defined. Nevertheless, dsRNA signal was clearly associated with DMVs, while the 363 dark membranous regions between DMVs that we interpreted as CM and DMSs clusters 364 appeared devoid of signal (Fig 6H and 6I ). 365 In summary, for the antibodies tested (recognizing N, M, S, nsp3, and dsRNA), the labelling 366 pattern in MERS-CoV-induced DMSs closely resembled that of the CM, from which they 367 seem to derive. The absence of labelling for key proteins in virus assembly, like the M and S 368 proteins, strongly suggest that DMSs do not represent (spurious) virus assembly events. [15, 20, 21, 29, 30, 47] , the unifying model that emerges from our study is that thus be a by-product of viral protein overexpression. Although DMSs seem to be derived 408 from CM, it is harder to imagine that these highly-regular structures would also lack a 409 specific function. However, their possible role remains elusive. The idea that DMSs could be 410 DMV precursors seems unlikely, considering that no intermediate structures between the two 411 were found, and that DMV formation precedes the appearance of CM, from which DMSs 412 seem to originate. A suggestive possibility was that DMSs represented non-productive virus 413 assembly events, but the lack of DMS labelling for key structural proteins seems to rule out 414 this option. In fact, no differences were apparent in the labelling patterns of CM Our results add to studies that, in the last years and after much speculation, have started to 419 provide experimental evidence that the DMVs induced by +RNA viruses are active sites of 420 vRNA synthesis [11, [58] [59] [60] . However, it is not clear that DMVs always play the primary role 421 in virus replication that we demonstrate here for CoV.

The most 444 appealing scenario is that in which vRNA synthesis only takes place inside the DMVs.

For each 609 CoV, different conditions (infected and mock-infected cells, plus different labelling times) 610 were compared using only samples developed after the same period of time. The analysis of 611 the signal in different subcellular regions was carried out using home-built software. Areas of 612 4 \u00b5m 2 were randomly selected from the mosaic EM maps and the autoradiography grains 613 present in those areas were manually assigned to the underlying cellular structures. The 614 abundance of the different types of subcellular structures was estimated through virtual points 615 in a 5\u00d75 lattice superimposed to each selected area, which were also assigned to the different 616 subcellular classes. Regularly along the process, the annotated data per condition was split 617 into two random groups and the Kendall and Spearman coefficients, which measure the 618 concordance between two data sets [73], were calculated. New random regions were added 619 until the average Kendall and Spearman coefficients resulting from 10 random splits were 620 higher than 0.8 and 0.9, respectively (maximum value, 1).

Tritiated uridine, for example, can be used to locate active RNA synthesis 5 [3] [4] [5] , as shown also in this study. A clear advantage over the use of alternatives for metabolic 6 labelling of newly-synthesized RNA (e.g. Br-uridine, Br-UTP, 5-ethynil uridine) is that the 7 radioactive precursor is chemically identical to the natural substrate. 8 After labelling, the samples are immediately fixed and processed for EM. The location of the 9 radioactive marker can then be made apparent by applying a highly-sensitive photographic 10 emulsion (a nuclear emulsion) on top of the cell sections and exposing it for several weeks to 11 months. The beta particles that are emitted as a result of tritium disintegrations generate 12 electrons that get trapped in the silver halide emulsion and create a \"latent image\". When the 13 emulsion is developed, these negative charges promote the reduction to metallic silver, 14 generating electron-dense grains that are visible by EM. In principle, given enough time to 15 accumulate enough radioactive disintegrations, even low levels of the radioactive marker 16 could be detected. In practice, other factors (e.g. background radiation, emulsion aging) set 17 some limits to autoradiography, which is nonetheless a very sensitive technique. 18 The resolution of EM autoradiography is limited by the fact that radioactive disintegrations 19 generate beta particles that are emitted in random directions. Importantly, the probability of 20 giving rise to signal degreases with the distance from the radioactive source; however, some 21 beta particles may travel up to a few hundred nanometers before striking the photographic 22 emulsion [2] . Therefore, it is important to keep in mind that the silver grains may not directly 23 overlay the structure containing the radioactive source. Quantitative analyses of the signal 24 .

Here we provide detailed 28 2D and 3D analyses of CoV ROs and show that diverse CoVs essentially induce the same 29 membrane modifications, including the small open double-membrane spherules (DMSs) 30 previously thought to be restricted to gamma-and delta-CoV infections and proposed as sites 31 of replication. Metabolic labelling of newly-synthesized viral RNA followed by quantitative 32 EM autoradiography revealed abundant viral RNA synthesis associated with DMVs in cells 33 infected with the beta-CoVs MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, and the gamma-CoV infectious 34 bronchitis virus. RNA synthesis could not be linked to DMSs or any other cellular or virus-35 induced structure. Our results provide a unifying model of the CoV RO and clearly establish 36 DMVs as the central hub for viral RNA synthesis and a potential drug target in as viral replication organelles (ROs) [1-3]. ROs are generally believed to provide 42 tailored platforms that facilitate viral replication by concentrating relevant factors and 43 spatially organizing distinct steps in the viral cycle. Additionally, ROs may contribute to the 44 evasion of cellular innate immune defences that detect viral RNA (vRNA) [4]. 45 Two main RO prototypes have been discriminated: small spherular invaginations and large(r) 46 vesiculotubular clusters consisting of single-and/or double-membrane structures, to which 47 viral replicative proteins and specific host factors can be recruited. The formation of 48 invaginations can occur at the membrane of various organelles, including endoplasmic 49 reticulum (ER), endolysosomes, and mitochondria [5-9]. The lumen of the resulting micro-50 compartment is connected with the cytosol by a 'neck-like' channel that can mediate 51 transport of metabolites and export of newly made positive-sense vRNAs to the cytosol for 52 translation and packaging. In general, the morphological and functional characterization of 53 ROs of the second, vesiculotubular type is lagging behind. Such structures, which always 54 include double-membrane vesicles (DMVs), commonly derive from membranes of the 55 secretory pathway and have been found in cells infected with e.g. picornaviruses [10, 11], 56 noroviruses [12], hepatitis C virus (HCV) [13], and different nidoviruses, including the 57 arterivirus and coronavirus (CoV) families [14-18]. 58 The first electron tomography analysis of a coronavirus-induced RO, that of the severe acute 59 respiratory syndrome-CoV [15] (SARS-CoV, genus Betacoronavirus), raised a variety of 60 functional considerations. Intriguingly, while double-stranded (ds) RNA, a presumed 61 intermediate and marker for vRNA synthesis [19], was found inside the virus-induced DMVs, 62 these lacked visible connections to the cytosol [15].

In fact, both bore a striking resemblance 149 under the same sample preparation conditions: MERS-CoV-induced CM noticeably consisted 150 of zippered smooth membranes that were connected to the rough ER and branched and 151 curved in intricate arrangements. Although unbranched zippered ER was most common in 152 IBV-infected cells, as described [29], we also detected zippered ER morphologically closer to 153 CM (S1B Fig).

This prompted us to revisit those samples for a closer examination. A 167 targeted search for DMSs in MERS-CoV-infected Vero cells [21] and SARS-CoV-infected 168 Vero E6 cells [15] readily revealed similar DMSs, embedded and somewhat concealed in CM 169 with a denser and more tangled appearance that can be attributed to sample preparation 170 differences (S2 Fig, compare to Fig 1 and Fig 2A). To further explore whether these 171 observations could be extended to other coronaviruses, we analysed a third beta-CoV (murine 172 hepatitis virus, MHV) as well as a member of the genus Alphacoronavirus (human 173 coronavirus 229E, HCoV-229E). Both in MHV-infected 17Cl1 cells and in HCoV-229E-174 infected Huh7 cells, virus-induced DMSs could be detected, with their characteristic size, 175 appearance, and spatial association with CM (Fig 2B and 2C).

A key advantage of 189 this approach over the use of modified precursors (e.g. Br-uridine), is that detection of the 190 label does not rely on immunolabelling. This makes autoradiography compatible with high-191 contrast EM sample preparation protocols that provide excellent morphology at the price of 192 epitope integrity. Moreover, as the signal derives from radioactive disintegrations, EM 193 autoradiography is a very sensitive technique, which in principle should allow for short 194 labelling pulses, essential to minimize the chance of migration of labelled vRNA products 195 from their site of synthesis. Nevertheless, the pulse should be long enough to enable the 196 internalization of the tritiated uridine, its conversion into 3 H-UTP in the cell, and its 197 incorporation into vRNA. In order to explore the practical limits of the approach, we tested 198 different labelling pulses in Vero E6 cells infected with SARS-CoV, measuring the amount of 199 radioactive label incorporated into RNA (Fig 3A). While minimal labelling occurred within 200 the first 10 minutes, a sharp increase in signal was observed between 10 and 20 min after 201 label administration. Consequently, only samples labelled for 20 min or longer were CoV RNA synthesis is confined to RO regions. Newly-synthesized vRNA was metabolically 205 labelled by providing tritiated uridine to CoV-infected cells pre-treated with actinomycin D to limit 206 the labelling time in SARS-CoV-infected Vero E6 cells (MOI 10), as measured by 208 scintillation counting on the RNA isolated from the cells.

This largely accepted notion, however, does not formally 226 exclude the possibility vRNA synthesis could also be associated with other cellular 227 membranes, albeit to a lower extent. Such an association with morphologically intact 228 membranes could be important, for example, in the first stages of infection, when the levels 229 of the viral membrane-remodelling proteins are still low. 230 Importantly, establishing the association of autoradiography signal with specific subcellular 231 structures requires a detailed quantitative analysis, as the autoradiography signal can",

An increase in labelling 245 densities in some subcellular regions was observed in infected cells when the labelling time 246 was extended to 60 min. This could be explained by signal leakage in combination with the 247 migration of vRNA from its site of synthesis, possibly towards the site of virus assembly on 248 membranes of the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) [40-42]. Indeed, virion-249 containing regions showed the sharpest increase in labelling density when extending the 250 labelling time. Similar results followed from the analysis of MERS-CoV-infected Huh7 cells 251 (Fig 3D), although no clear signs of RNA migration were observed in this case.

Interestingly, not all the DMV 261 clusters in a sample, and sometimes even within a cell, appeared equally densely labelled, 262 which suggests that the levels of vRNA synthesis in DMVs are variable and could change in 263 time. The active role of DMVs in vRNA synthesis in MERS-CoV-infected cells was further 264 corroborated by a detailed analysis of the distribution of autoradiography signal around 265 isolated DMVs (Fig 4C). In case of a random distribution (i.e. if the DMVs were not a true 266 radioactive source), the number of autoradiography grains around the DMVs would simply 267 increase with the distance, as the perimeter of the screened area also increases and with it the 268 chances of detecting background signal. The signal around DMVs was clearly not random, 269 showing maximum levels in the proximity of these structures (Fig 4C). Moreover, the 270 distribution normalized by the distance made apparent a maximum around the average radius 271 of the DMVs analysed (133 \u00b1 28 nm, n=36) (Fig 4E), aligning with the idea that vRNA 272 synthesis takes place in membrane-bound enzymatic complexes. 273 DMVs are sites of vRNA synthesis.

IBV-induced DMSs are particularly 310 abundant and a large proportion of them have an open configuration, which contributed to the 311 hypothesis that these open DMSs could be engaged in vRNA synthesis [29, 31]. However, no 312 evidence supporting this hypothesis could be derived from our detailed analysis of the 313 autoradiography signal in IBV-infected cells, which essentially produced the same results as 314 for MERS-CoV (S3 Fig). Taken together, our observations clearly point at coronaviral DMVs 315 as the active site of vRNA synthesis and seem to indicate that neither CM/zippered ER nor 316 DMSs are effectively involved in this process, at least not to a significant level above the 317 detection limits of our method. 318 319 DMSs do not label for viral envelope proteins or dsRNA 320 If CM and DMSs are not involved in vRNA synthesis, what is the role (if any) of these RO 321 structural elements in coronavirus replication?

Revealing DMSs in IEM samples, however, was 337 challenging and, in our hands, required a modified protocol for the preparation of thawed 338 cryo-sections [43] that, unfortunately, failed to make DMVs apparent (see Materials and 339 Methods). Given the similar size of DMSs and virus particles, we first considered the 340 possibility that the DMSs would represent some kind of non-productive virus assembly event 341 on the CM. While new CoV particles typically assemble in the ERGIC [40-42, 44, 45], virus 342 budding from ER membranes, from which CM originate, can also occur [40, 46, 47], and we 343 regularly observed it in MERS-CoV-and IBV-infected cells (e.g. S1 Fig).To investigate this 344 possibility, we used antibodies against several of the structural proteins, namely, the 345 nucleocapsid protein N, the envelope membrane protein M and the spike protein S.

An early study using Br-383 UTP and IEM to detect newly-synthesized vRNA mapped signal in DMV regions of MHV-384 infected cells [14], but the poor preservation of IEM samples did not allow the recognition of 385 CM and DMSs, typically present in these regions. Later, a light microscopy study using 5-386 ethynil uridine labelling and click chemistry suggested that vRNA synthesis could take place, 387 at least partially, in a different location than the DMVs [55]. Alternative interpretations of 388 those results, like migration of vRNA from the DMVs during the relatively long labelling 389 times used (60 min) appear now more plausible. Several other studies further contributed to 390 undermine the idea of DMVs being the sites of vRNA synthesis by showing that higher 391 numbers of DMVs did not necessarily translate into larger amounts of vRNA or provide a 392 competitive advantage [27, 28].

By clearly pointing to DMVs as the key sites for CoV replication, our 425 results also bring back to centre stage some of the challenges that CoV-induced DMVs pose,426 which extend to the distantly-related arterivirus family, and probably also to other members 427 of the order Nidovirales. In contrast with the DMVs induced by other +RNA viruses [10, 11, 428 13, 60], the DMVs in nidovirus-infected cells appear to lack membrane openings that would 429 connect their inner compartment with the cytosol to allow import of precursors and export of 430 genomic and subgenomic viral mRNAs [15, 16, 29]. This topological conundrum, however, 431 starts with the assumption that vRNA synthesis takes place inside the DMVs, yet the 432 evidence so far is insufficient to ascertain this point. Shielding of vRNA inside DMVs 433 arguably provides the most straightforward explanation for the observation that intact 434 membranes protected vRNA from nuclease treatment [61]. However, protection of vRNA 435could also be achieved in the outer DMV membrane through protein complexes that would 436 rely on membranes for assembly/stability.437    While a definitive answer to this issue is still missing, our results allow narrowing down the 438 possible scenarios. If the DMVs are closed structures lacking an import/export mechanism, 439 vRNA synthesis on the outer DMV membrane appears as a necessity to provide vRNA for 440 translation and encapsidation. Then, vRNA synthesis inside the DMVs would also be 441 required to explain the observed accumulation of (presumably viral) dsRNA.

The openings of DMV may be 453 extremely short-lived, and therefore they may have eluded detection by EM. This may 454 become apparent in the future, if mutant CoV inducing DMVs with slower dynamics are 455found. An appealing alternative is the existence of molecular pores that may well be 456 undetectable in conventional EM samples. Precedents of molecular complexes bridging 457 double membranes include the large nuclear pore complex, but also small transporters 458 through the mitochondrial or chloroplast membranes. Visualizing such a putative small 459 molecular pore on DMVs is a formidable challenge that would likely require the use of cryo-460 EM to preserve macromolecular components.

All the infection experiments were 478 carried out at 37 o C, except for HCoV-229E infections which were performed at 33 o C. Cells 479 were infected at high multiplicity of infection (MOI 5-10), with the exception of IBV 480 (MOI<1). In this case, the time post-infection chosen (~16 hpi) allowed for two cycles of 481 IBV replication to maximize the number of infected cells. For MHV infections, 1 \u00b5M HR2 482 peptide was added to the cell medium to prevent syncytia formation [66]. Control mock-483 infected cells were included in all the experiments. Infections were routinely assessed by 484 immunofluorescence assays on parallel samples, essentially processed as previously 485 described [51]. All work with live SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV was verified by Western blot analysis and immunofluorescence microscopy using 497 samples from MERS-CoV-infected Vero or Huh7 cells, as described previously [21], whilst 498 using pre-immune serum and mock-infected cell lysates as negative controls. The human 499 monoclonal antibody used against MERS-CoV spike protein was kindly provided by Dr. 500 Berend Jan Bosch (Utrecht University) and has been described elsewhere as 1.6f9 [69]. 501 502 Metabolic labelling and label incorporation measurements 503 To label newly-synthesized RNA, CoV-infected cells and control mock-infected cells were 504 incubated for different periods of time with tritiated uridine ([5-3 H]uridine, 1 mCi/ml, Perkin 505 Elmer), which was mixed in a 1:1 ratio with double-concentrated medium. Cellular 506 transcription was blocked by providing the cells with 10 \u00b5g/ml actinomycin D both during 507 labelling and in a pre-incubation step of 1-2 h, depending on the specific set of samples. 508 Directly after labelling, the cells were extensively washed with phosphate-buffered saline 509 (PBS) and immediately fixed for EM autoradiography. A parallel set of samples was included 510 in every experiment for label incorporation measurements. These cells were lysed using 511 TriPure Isolation Reagend (Roche) and the RNA isolated following the manufacturer'analysis, autoradiography and tomography, EM samples of CoV-infected 517 cells were prepared by chemical fixation. Chemical fixation was chosen over the alternative 518 of high-pressure freezing (HPF) and freeze-substitution (FS) to increase the yield of cells per 519 EM grid and thus facilitate the autoradiography quantitative analysis, as it was observed that 520 infected cells were easily washed away and lost during FS. At the desired times post 521 infection, the cells were fixed for 30 min with 1.5% (vol/vol) glutaraldehyde (GA) in 0.1 M 522 cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4). Cells infected with SARS-or MERS-CoV were further 523 maintained in the fixative overnight. After fixation, the samples were washed with 0.1 M 524 cacodylate buffer either once or, in samples destined to autoradiography, 3 times (5 min each) 525 to favour the elimination of unincorporated [5-3 H]uridine. Next, the samples were treated 526 with 1% (wt/vol) OsO 4 at 4 o C for 1 hour, washed with 0.1 M cacodylate buffer and Milli-Q 527 water, and stained at room temperature for 1 hour with 1% (wt/vol) low-molecular weight 528 tannic acid (Electron Microscopy Science) in 01. M cacodylate buffer (SARS-CoV 529 autoradiography experiments), or with 1% (wt/vol) uranyl acetate in Milli-Q (rest of the 530 samples). Following a new washing step with Milli-Q water, the samples were dehydrated in 531 increasing concentrations of ethanol (70%, 80%, 90%, 100%), embedded in epoxy resin (LX-532 112, Ladd Research), and polymerized at 60 o C. Sections were collected on mesh-100 copper 533 EM grids covered with a carbon-coated Pioloform layer, and post-stained with against a line of double-sided sticky tape applied along the length of the slide. 539 Each glass slide included a grid for every condition tested within a given experiment, to be 540 later developed simultaneously. A thin layer of carbon was then evaporated onto the grids to 541 prevent direct contact between the stained section and the photographic emulsion that could 542 lead to undesired chemical changes in the emulsion. Samples were transferred to a dark room, 543 and a thin layer of nuclear emulsion ILFORD L4 was placed on top of the grids with the help 544 of a wire loop [36].

The progress in the exposure 546 of the nuclear emulsion to radioactive disintegrations was evaluated regularly by EM until the 547 number of autoradiography grains was sufficient for analysis (~6 weeks for SARS-CoV-548 infected cells, ~21 weeks for MERS-CoV-infected cells, and ~12-13 weeks for IBVof MERS-CoV-infected cell samples were prepared for IEM. The labelling of 552 viral proteins was performed on thawed cryo-sections, which are optimal for epitope 553 preservation. To this end, at 12 hpi, infected and mock-infected cells were first chemically 554 fixed for 1 hour at room temperature with 3% (wt/vol) paraformaldehyde (PFA) and 0.25% 555 (vol/vol) GA in 0.1 M PHEM buffer (60 mM PIPES, 25 mM HEPES, 10 mM EGTA, buffer until transfer from the biosafety level 3 facility for further 558 processing.

However, virus-induced membrane modifications were not discernible 564 in these samples, and clear signs of membrane extraction were present. To tackle this issue, 565 we used a previously described modification of the protocol that includes sequential post-566 staining steps with 1% 1% (wt/vol) OsO4, 2% (wt/vol) uranyl acetate and Reynold's lead 567 citrate after immunogold labelling and prior to the final embedding in a thin layer of 1.8% 568 methyl cellulose [43]. Both CM and DMSs were clearly recognizable in these samples, while 569 DMVs were still not apparent and may have been extracted, as empty areas were often found 570 in the vicinity of CM regions. 571 The detection of dsRNA required the preparation of HPF-FS samples. For biosafety 572 considerations, Huh7 cells grown on sapphire disks and infected with MERS-CoV, were first 573 fixed overnight at 13 hpi with 3% (wt/vol) paraformaldehyde and 0.25% (vol/vol) GA in 0.1 574 M PHEM buffer. Then, the samples were frozen with a Leica EM PACT2, after which they 575were freeze-substituted in a Leica AFS2 system with 0.1% (wt/vol) uranyl acetate as 576 previously described[71], with the only modification that acetone was replaced by ethanol 577 from the last washing step before Lowycril infiltration onwards.

Mosaic EM images of large grid areas were generated for the 588 quantitative analysis of autoradiography samples, using overlapping automatically-collected 589 images (pixel size 2 nm, Tecnai 12 BioTwin) that were subsequently combined in a 590 composite image as described in[38].",

Only large CM (> 0.6 \u00b5m across) were selected in order to 632 make more apparent (if present) any decay of the autoradiography signal as the distance to 633 the surrounding DMVs increased. For each autoradiography grain, both the distance to the 634 closest CM boundary (d 1 ) and the distance to the opposite CM edge (d 2 ) were measured. The 635 relative distance to the CM edge was then calculated as d 1 /(d 1 +d 2 ) and expressed in 636 percentages. All the measurements in different DMVs, DMSs and CM were made using Aperio Imagescope software (Leica) and pooled together into three single data sets.
