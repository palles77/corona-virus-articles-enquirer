            "text": "This case report offers some interesting and controversial data: (a) an unusual clinical feature of ATL with atypical infiltrated sarcoid-like papules in the facial region following a lymphatic trajectory (Figure 1D ) from the glabella to the right perioral region. We cannot consider the leg ulcers as the primary local ATL infection since they were not biopsied and they were initially considered as vascular stasis-related lesions, emphasizing the difficulty in diagnosing ATL, even for experienced specialists 1 . (b) Immunological local features indicated a deficiency in innate response, but a strong Th1 response with an intense pro-inflammatory activity. Furthermore, the lack of regulatory response leads to severe local damage, which explains the atypical skin lesion. Regulation deficiency may be explained not only by the immunosuppressed patient conditions (chronic hepatopathy) but also by Leishmania sp. local immunomodulation 6, 7 . On the contrary, parasite exposure and a deficient cellular activity lead to an intense humoral response with high titers of anti-Leishmania circulating antibodies, confirmed by great titers of IFI and ELISA. (c) Following the Brazilian Ministry of Health VL guidelines 4 , this patient met the criteria to confirm the diagnosis of VL; however, with the patient's comorbidities (cirrhosis with portal hypertension) and ATL, the clinico-laboratory interpretation was significantly harder. Moreover, rK39 false-positive test supported the misdiagnosis, ruling out postmortem VL. The rK39 test is a valuable tool for VL diagnosis 8 , showing a good accuracy depending on the test brand and the global region used 9 . However, some rK39 rapid test brand had shown excellent performance in the blood from Brazilian patients 10 ; its results should be carefully analyzed in co-prevalent regions with ATL due to an eventual cross-reactivity 3 , as observed here, even in bone marrow samples. Regarding surveillance, VL notification had to be removed. (d) Otherwise, considering the patient's immunosuppression and the high incidence of VL in Southeastern Brazil, these atypical lesions may also be explained due to the cutaneous involvement by viscerotropic Leishmania strains 11 .",
