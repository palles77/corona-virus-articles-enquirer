Viruses account for most ARIs in children younger than 5 years, and they are the leading cause of community-acquired pneumonia in this age group [3] . Children experience approximately 3-6 ARIs per year, and the spectrum of illness ranges from mild to life-threatening [4] . Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza are 2 pathogens that cause serious illness and account for a substantial proportion of viral respiratory infections in children. Respiratory syncytial virus is a major cause of bronchiolitis in infants, and approximately 22% of lower respiratory infections have been attributed to RSV [5] . A population-based study of children younger than 5 years found that 8% of all primary care visits and 18% of all emergency department visits for ARI were attributed to RSV [6] . Influenza is a major cause of hospitalization among children under 24 months of age [7] , and approximately 10%-25% of outpatient ARI visits are related to influenza during seasonal epidemics [8] .",

Nearly all MESA residents receive their medical care from Marshfield Clinic, an integrated, multispecialty healthcare system serving the MESA population. The Marshfield Clinic electronic medical record captures approximately 93% of outpatient visits, 93% of hospital discharges, and 99% of deaths for the MESA population [13, 14] . This study focused on children living in MESA who were 6-59 months old at the start of each influenza season. Although data on race and ethnicity were not collected during all study seasons, US Census data from 2010 indicate that 94% of Marshfield residents are white, non-Hispanic.",

This multiplex panel tested for RSV A and B, human rhinovirus, human metapneumovirus, parainfluenza viruses 1-4, influenza A and B (including subtypes of influenza A), coronaviruses OC43, NL63, HKU1, and 229E, and adenoviruses B and E. Nucleic acid was extracted from the swabs using the Roche MagnaPure 2.0 system and was then amplified using RT-PCR with target-specific primers. Target-specific signals were determined by voltammetry, a process that generates electrical signals from ferrocene-labeled signal probes. We validated the GenMark multiplex assay RSV A and B against singleplex assays developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The sensitivity and specificity was 98% and 99%, respectively, for RSV (unpublished data, 2012). Other investigators have reported 99% overall agreement between the GenMark multiplex assay and corresponding singleplex RT-PCR for respiratory viruses in children [15] .",

Incidence calculations were based on 2 assumptions. First, we assumed that test results from enrolled patients with MAARI can be extrapolated to nonenrolled cohort members with a respiratory illness visit during the enrollment period. Visits for ARI were based on ICD-9 codes (specific codes available on request). Although rare, some study participants did not receive a diagnosis code for ARI because enrollment eligibility was based on presenting symptoms rather than ICD-9 codes that were assigned after the visit. Test results for these participants were not extrapolated to nonenrolled cohort members.",

Otherwise, analytic weights equal to the inverse of the proportion of cohort members with MAARI that were enrolled were assigned within strata defined by age group (6-11, 12-23, and 24-59 months) and season.

The outcome in the regression models was the dichotomous virus test result (coded 1 = positive, 0 = negative). The offset terms were stratified by season and age group.

The incidence of RSV was highest among children 6-11 months old, but the 6-11 month and 12-23 month age groups had similar RSV incidence. We were unable to estimate incidence in younger children because they were not eligible for enrollment in the vaccine effectiveness study from which our data were obtained. The incidence among children 6-23 months old was approximately double the incidence in those 24-59 months old. In contrast, the incidence of medically attended influenza was highest among children 24-59 months old. The seasonal incidence of both RSV and influenza was highest during the 2007-2008 season when A/H3N2 was the dominant circulating influenza virus. The overall incidence of influenza was similar in 2007-2008 and during 2009-2010, which included the pandemic. In the latter season, the vast majority of influenza cases occurred in the pandemic wave that affected the community in October and November 2009. The lowest incidence of both viruses occurred in 2006-2007 when seasonal A/H1N1 accounted for the majority of influenza cases. These findings add to the evidence that the burden of RSV is high during the first 24 months of life, and they emphasize the need for a safe and effective intervention to prevent RSV in infants and toddlers. Two other published studies estimated the population incidence of RSV illness in the outpatient setting. The first study was conducted by the New Vaccine Surveillance Network (NVSN) from 2000 to 2004 and estimated the incidence of outpatient RSV illness among children under 5 years old near 3 cities: Nashville, Tennessee, Cincinnati, Ohio, and Rochester, New York [6] . Children with ARI were enrolled and tested for RSV 1-2 days per week from emergency departments, hospitals, and a small number of pediatric practices. Incidence rates were estimated by multiplying RSV-attributable illness among enrolled children by rates of ARI in children from the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS). Investigators estimated the incidence of RSV to be from 610 to 990 cases per 10 000.",

Surveillance, active recruitment, and testing occurred during the months when RSV and influenza activity were highest, and we used data from the Wisconsin State Laboratory of Hygiene to estimate the number of additional cases that would have been captured if we had enrolled continuously from week 40 through week 18. This approach created a high level of internal validity. In the NVSN study, results from participating children were applied to national survey data (NAMCS), and the lower RSV incidence may reflect differences in healthcare utilization for ARI at the national level compared with the communities where studies were conducted. The IISP used a convenience sample to obtain viral diagnostic test results, and there was a potential for selection bias with the use of clinical diagnostic testing. It is also unclear whether all respiratory illness visits were captured, because the analysis included only visits to the primary medical provider.",

The length of the enrollment period was relatively short-only 10-12 weeks during each season except the 2009-2010 season, which had an extended enrollment period due to the pandemic. We addressed this by using state surveillance data to estimate the proportion of cases occurring outside our enrollment window, but we do not know whether state surveillance data are a valid measure of RSV activity in the community outside the enrollment period. We did not enroll children <6 months of age when serious RSV infections may occur. As a result, we were unable to estimate RSV and influenza incidence in this age group. Rhinoviruses along with RSV and influenza were the majority of viruses detected. However, statewide data combines enterovirus and rhinovirus groups due to genetic similarity. Therefore, we were unable to estimate the proportion of rhinovirus cases occurring outside our enrollment period and did not estimate the incidence of medically attended rhinovirus infections. Finally, we did not detect human bocavirus because the multiplex PCR array did not include it.
