            "text": "The term \"Geographic Information Systems\" (GIS) has been added to MeSH in 2003, a step reflecting the importance and growing use of GIS in health and healthcare research and practices. GIS have much more to offer than the obvious digital cartography (map) functions. From a community health perspective, GIS could potentially act as powerful evidence-based practice tools for early problem detection and solving. When properly used, GIS can: inform and educate (professionals and the public); empower decision-making at all levels; help in planning and tweaking clinically and cost-effective actions, in predicting outcomes before making any financial commitments and ascribing priorities in a climate of finite resources; change practices; and continually monitor and analyse changes, as well as sentinel events. Yet despite all these potentials for GIS, they remain under-utilised in the UK National Health Service (NHS). This paper has the following objectives: (1) to illustrate with practical, real-world scenarios and examples from the literature the different GIS methods and uses to improve community health and healthcare practices, e.g., for improving hospital bed availability, in community health and bioterrorism surveillance services, and in the latest SARS outbreak; (2) to discuss challenges and problems currently hindering the wide-scale adoption of GIS across the NHS; and (3) to identify the most important requirements and ingredients for addressing these challenges, and realising GIS potential within the NHS, guided by related initiatives worldwide. The ultimate goal is to illuminate the road towards implementing a comprehensive national, multi-agency spatio-temporal health information infrastructure functioning proactively in real time. The concepts and principles presented in this paper can be also applied in other countries, and on regional (e.g., European Union) and global levels.",

In the next section on \"GIS methods and technologies\", we cast some light on the richness of GIS toolbox, which goes far beyond the mere production of simple maps (or digital cartography). The section that comes after, titled \"GIS applications in health and healthcare\", examines with examples the main uses of GIS in the health sector (apart from real-time GIS applications, which are covered in a separate section near the end). We then discuss the current state of GIS affairs in the UK NHS in the section titled \"On the under utilisation of geo-information and GIS in the UK NHS: problems and challenges\". This is followed by a section on \"Geo-information and real-time GIS infrastructure requirements\" in which we review the most important technical and organisational elements that are required for a successful implementation of a national geo-information infrastructure that can also support real-time GIS applications in public health. The section that follows, titled \"Problematic issues and solutions\", is a direct continuation of the one preceding it, and discusses tricky issues like data confidentiality and data/analysis errors, together with solutions that can address them. We next present examples of Spatial Data Infrastructures (SDIs) at different levels of development from around the world in the section on \"Existing SDIs and SDI initiatives worldwide\". Then in the section on \"Proactive, real-time, GIS-enabled health and environmental surveillance services\", we describe a wide-scale vision for, and some early real-world applications of, realtime GIS in emergency management, and in health and environmental surveillance. Such applications currently involve limited SDI-like arrangements, and would certainly benefit from the development of mature SDIs in their respective regions. The final section titled \"Discussion, recommendations and concluding remarks\" very briefly reiterates and wraps up the main points made in this paper, and provides some final recommendations and directions for future work.",

GIS also enable multi-dimensional surface images to be drawn to scale, a feature important in studies involving elevation or subsurface shape. The mathematical treatment of topographic or surface statistical values can be used as a filter against other variables or other surfaces.

Moreover, values among contiguous areas (polygons) in a choropleth map can differ abruptly at adjoining borders, while in reality disease incidence and most other spatio-temporal events and phenomena such as deprivation levels are continuous variables distributed continuously across space and do not change abruptly at arbitrarily defined administrative, census and political boundaries (Figure 1 ).

The principal reason to filter disease data spatially is to examine the spatial pattern of disease at different levels of spatial resolution and to compute disease rates that are not dependent on the specific boundaries of the areas used in spatially aggregated data [14] . A spatial filter can be applied to individual point data, as well as to data aggregated into small census areas. In its simplest form, the estimated rate at a particular location, or grid point, is defined as the observed rate within a fixed distance from the grid point. The circles of neighbouring grid points are set to overlap to allow neighbouring grid points to share observations. After assigning estimated rates to each grid point, contouring software is used to create isarithmic maps in which regions with a constant range of values can be recognised.

For such applications to be truly integrated into the strategic decision-making process, they should incorporate task-appropriate statistical and modelling techniques, e.g., spatial interaction models (allowing proposed health services/centres to be added interactively to assess their impact), and location-allocation models in order to forecast and evaluate the implication of modifying the configuration of existing services (i.e., \"what if\" scenarios), and thus play a proactive role in the healthcare planning process. GIS have been used in a number of studies to estimate the best/optimal location for a new clinic, hospital or GP surgery to minimise distances potential patients need to travel taking into account existing facilities, transport provision, hourly variations in traffic volumes, and population density. A number of these studies using the networking capabilities of GIS have been concerned with the concept of potential accessibility. Others, who have had access to spatially disaggregated data, have been concerned with (actual) revealed accessibility patterns of service utilisation [28] .",

Access block (hospital bed shortage) occurs when a patient in the emergency department (ED) requiring inpatient care is unable to gain access to an appropriate bed within a reasonable time. It is measured by the percentage of all patients admitted, transferred to another hospital for admission, or dying in the ED whose total ED time exceeds eight hours. Access block is the prime symptom of supply/demand mismatch in hospital bed stock in Australia. This is also true in many other parts of the world today, including the UK. Access block may result in ambulance bypass, increased ED waiting time and casualty queues, increased frequency of adverse events, increased patient complaints, and adverse media attention. Ashby describes a number of ameliorating strategies to avoid access block that have been implemented by the Royal Brisbane Hospital in Queensland, Australia where he works as Executive Director of Medical Services. Among these strategies is a method to improve hospital bed availability through precision bed management using integrated demand, utilisation and PAS (Patient Administration System) data, flow models and advanced GIS to map the geography of the hospital against variables such as patient numbers, staff numbers, and nurse dependency. GIS are used in patient flow modelling to look firstly at opportunities for flow reversal of ED, outpatients and secondary level inpatients, and secondly to improve efficiency through optimum distribution of patients according to a number of variables including nurse dependency, projected length of stay, projected time of discharge and infection status. GIS are proving superior to conventional patient activity systems in informing the organisation about bed management opportunities on an hour-by-hour basis [32, 33] .",

As outlined in this key strategy document, data-rich records kept by GPs remain a relatively untapped resource particularly in the areas of local health surveillance, service audit and resource targeting. Information for Health also calls for data sharing between NHS and non-NHS organisations in order to tackle health issues. Linkages between, for example, poor health and unemployment, housing, crime, and education are major drivers for partnership approaches between such organisations. The Acheson Report published in 1998 also recognised the need to adopt cross-governmental approaches to address health concerns [37] . Considering all of this, and given the recent media attention to geographical variations in healthcare service provision, which often revolve around the so-called \"postcode lottery\" in treatment levels, the fact that a considerable majority of the datasets used in UK primary and secondary care are geo-referenced, and the recent increase in the number of articles (e.g., [10] ), books (e.g., [38] [39] [40] [41] ), and conferences (e.g., [42] ) about the potentials and use of GIS in health applications, it is surprising there has been no mention in Information for Health or other more recent follow-up documents (e.g., \"Building the Information Core: Implementing the NHS Plan\" published in 2001 -[43]) of the role that spatial data and GIS could play in the new NHS [28, 35] .",

This was attributed to a lack of spatial data-handling skills within the NHS and the failure to realise the value of geographical information, which was often being collected as part of existing operational tasks. Cummins and Rathwell also found that there was little in the way of infrastructure to enable staff, training, resource management, and financial budgets to implement GIS. The small size of many IT departments and high staff turnover, attributed to the higher wage levels of staff with spatial handling skills in the private sector, also hindered the effective implementation of GIS.",

Moreover, they noted a particular lack of collaboration between GIS academics and healthcare practitioners/managers.

Two thirds of the surveyed health authorities stated that GIS was being underutilised and cited the main reasons as the high costs of digital geographical data and the lack of resources for training and work-time constraints for NHS personnel, because of the low priority given to GIS within the organisations by senior management. Staff turnover, especially in organisations where only one member of staff is responsible for GIS work (this was the case in 30% of surveyed organisations), left such organisations vulnerable in terms of their GIS capabilities. Cooper advocates the setting up of regional health GIS centres, integrated with the newly formed public health observatories to provide GIS support for local health services and to coordinate training programmes to improve the GIS skills base. These regional services could be responsible for coordinating data collection at the regional level, and preventing any duplication of efforts in spatial data collection or processing [50] .",

It is essential that all users are involved when defining (user) requirements and testing the associated products and services. NSDI policy must be flexible to address rapidly changing user needs and adapt to changing technologies. NSDI Steering Groups (with end-user representation) should be formed to formulate appropriate policy and institutional frameworks and facilitate multi-stakeholder cooperation.

Once data were acquired, they were integrated into the GIS using the developed data model and the spatial unit of the enumeration area, a Canadian census sampling area with a median population of 400 in the study area (Southeast Toronto) to relate datasets to one another (in this case the enumeration area acted as a common high resolution geographical unit for linkage -the data model facilitated data integration around the common geographical unit of the enumeration area).

The ultimate system will be one that is fault-tolerant and capable of analysing and presenting assembled data in ways that facilitate only appropriate interpretations of integrated data. This can be achieved by using some form of user friendly, \"intelligent\", goal-oriented health GIS wizards (based on robust statistical methods where appropriate), so that only valid results and maps are produced, even when users attempt to select inappropriate settings or datasets for a particular analysis.

Traditional ecological analysis based on choropleth mapping and the analysis of aggregate data for administrative areas has been heavily criticised. It is increasingly becoming clear in the field of public health that individual-level health information aggregated to pre-existing political or other administrative areas to protect individual privacy often destroys information needed for geographical analyses making it impossible to address many important public health concerns, e.g., accident risk of particular environments, hazards of living close to hazardous waste sites, exposure risk from lead associated with urban highways, etc. Such concerns can only be addressed using micro-data.

Another technique is random perturbation, in which each point is displaced (within the range of a constant maximum magnitude of displacement) by a randomly determined amount, and in a randomly determined direction, specific to its original location. A third class of geographic masks is aggregation. Areal aggregation involves enumerating the total that exists within a region. Point aggregation uses a single, surrogate location to represent the location of several individual-level events. In the latter case, regions could be represented by their geographic centroids, or surrogate locations could be computed that are optimised regarding some defined relationship to the original locations (location-allocation methods). Other point aggregation methods include microaggregation and blurring. It is also possible to aggregate for non-conterminous \"regions\" of interest like releasing health data for all areas within a given distance of a specified hazard, e.g., all children's accidents within 20 metres of stop signs. Another possible approach to limiting disclosure is to remove all explicit geographic identifiers from the health record and replace them with contextual information of specific interest to the data user [83] .",

Health organisations are always looking for finer levels of boundary geography to aggregate their data to. The US South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control (SCDHEC) used to aggregate spatial health information at county level. While county-level data provide a wealth of information, information at this macro scale does not allow local health officials to adequately identify, analyse, and monitor health problems at the community level. Laymon describes SCDHEC's more recent approach to managing geo-referenced vital health records by geocoding them, then aggregating them at census tract level instead of county level. A US census tract is a small statistical subdivision of a county designed to be relatively homogenous with respect to demographics, socio-economic characteristics, and living conditions, and to contain between 2,500 and 8,000 residents. SCDHEC chose census tracts because they contain useful socio-economic data that could be combined with the aggregated vital records. Census tracts were also chosen because these geographic boundaries are updated once every decade (stable) [84] .",

By joining aggregate vital records health data with existing socio-economic census data, the system provides a good tool for developing surveillance and intervention strategies while preserving residents' confidentiality. The point data resulting from the geocoding process (before aggregation) is treated with all the confidentiality of paper certificate data, and stored for future use in very high-resolution studies [84] In England, Wales and Northern Ireland, Output Areas (OAs) have been introduced at the 2001 Census. OAs form a new level of boundary geography for reporting purposes. From April 2004 they will also be used as the finest level of reporting geography for Neighbourhood Statistics http://www.neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/, which includes crime, education, economic deprivation, work deprivation, and health. Output Areas are built from postcodes, and have been designed for homogeneity and to be static. Each OA contains approximately 125 households. Due to their smaller size (compared to Enumeration Districts), OAs allow for a finer resolution of data analysis while still ensuring data confidentiality [85] .",

The cartographer's paradox is that to avoid hiding critical information in a fog of detail, the map must offer a selective, incomplete view of reality [95] . Public health practitioners need to be alert for \"lies\" that can range from legitimate and appropriate suppression of some details selectively to help the user focus on what needs to be seen to more serious distortions in which the visual image suggests conclusions that would not be supported by careful epidemiological analysis. For example, when some geographic units of analysis have small denominators, disease rates computed for these areas may appear extremely high if any cases have occurred in these areas (the \"small numbers\" problem). When the rates for these geographic locations are displayed on a map, readers may incorrectly conclude that these are \"hot spots\", high priority locations for targeted interventions. More appropriately, these areas should be labelled to indicate that rates are statistically unstable due to small numbers and therefore not shown [7] .",

According to Jacquez, these approaches play a role in both confirmatory and exploratory analyses. He continues: \"Especially within the exploratory framework, one must be able to discriminate true patterns from apparent patterns that could be explained by chance. In the absence of such capability, both confirmatory and exploratory analyses spin their wheels because they lack an objective mechanism for identifying and quantifying relationships in the data.\" (Geoffrey M. Jacquez, personal communication -July 2003) Jacquez also mentioned in his e-mail to this author that they have several initiatives underway in the development of surveillance systems at BioMedware http:// www.biomedware.com/, the company he leads. One of these projects, NetSurv, will link diverse databases in real time, will support dynamic visualisation (linked windows and cartographic and statistical brushing), and will include surveillance and pattern recognition statistics for separating true signal from noise. This will enable prospective analysis of incoming health data (the continuous monitoring of health data, combining historical data with new information as it is received). The ultimate aim of the NetSurv project is to provide decision support and monitoring tools that will enhance existing disease surveillance systems and support timely analysis, policy formulation, and public health actions. An early version of the architecture, but one that is linked only to static cancer mortality outcomes has been developed for the US NCI and may be downloaded from https://www.terraseer.com/atlas viewer.html ( Figure 6 ). They also have Rogerson's spatial pattern surveillance method in their ClusterSeer software (see also \"Testing for spatio-temporal disease clustering\" above). Help for the method, as well as for the entire Clus-terSeer software project is available online at https:// www.terraseer.com/csr/clusterseer_help.html (Geoffrey M.

The askGIraffe Data Locator was then launched in July 2000, and has now become superseded by GIgateway http://www.gigateway.org/ moreinformation/history.html. GIgateway is an information service providing access to spatial metadata in the UK. At the heart of the service is the Data Locator http:// www.gigateway.org.uk/datalocator/default.html - Figure  7) , which is capable of carrying real-time searches across a number of distributed metadata-bases (held at their respective data providers' local sites that have registered with GIgateway), in addition to querying GIgateway's own catalogue. A query of the Data Locator using the keyword \"health\" yielded 426 records (on 26 November 2003). However, many of the returned metadata records had incomplete/empty fields, and no instant access over the Internet to the actual datasets they are describing, or to a license agreement/payment form to access these datasets, as one would expect from a comprehensive \"onestop\" Web-based clearinghouse (e-mail contact details are usually provided instead). Moreover, the returned records did not include the latest Census 2001 Key Statistics for health areas in England and Wales http://www.statis tics.gov.uk/census2001/cn_61.asp, which was a notable deficiency. GIgateway's metadata creation tool, a JAVAbased application called MetaGenie http://www.gigate way.org.uk/datalocator/metadatatool.html, enables the creation of geographic metadata compliant with GIgateway's Discovery Metadata Specifications. MetaGenie will be rewritten to be fully compliant with the new international standards, ISO 19115/19139, in the near future. GIgateway is funded by the UK Government and run by the UK Association for Geographic Information -AGI (Judith Jerome, GIgateway Information Services Manager, personal communication -October 2003).",

An interesting point raised by Mandl and his colleagues is the need for truly unique person identifier, so that individuals are not double-counted as they move between healthcare institutions (sometimes during the same day). Mandl et al also suggest using data already collected for other purposes whenever this is possible, since implementing new data collection processes can have prohibitive costs, and healthcare workers have repeatedly demonstrated poor compliance with additional data collection and administrative tasks. They also recommend designing \"dual use\" systems and not only focusing on the detection of bioterrorism or very rare outbreaks in order to boost the sustainability and long-term funding viability of such systems [109] .

MAC can produce GIS maps from important prediction model outputs, e.g., a hurricane wind model, a toxic plume model or an earthquake model, coupled with real-time data to provide estimates for projected damages in affected regions. It can also generate maps from damage assessment data after a disaster has occurred to visualise actual damages by analysing collected aerial reconnaissance and ground truth data. This can help emergency managers appreciate the spatial extent of damage, learn who was affected by the disaster and which resources were affected, and make timely, informed decision accordingly (e.g., a plume model can help determine those areas requiring evacuation; early informed interventions almost always result in mitigation of disaster effects) [111, 112] .",

By the time someone is admitted to an acute care hospital with a communicable disease, that person may have been symptomatic for days or weeks and may have already been seen by healthcare professionals repeatedly, and would have already spread the disease to large numbers of persons. For example, smallpox, which begins with a rash that becomes more painful and extensive, is often initially treated with an anti-inflammatory antihistamine drug such as Diphenhydramine HCL (Benadryl). When this treatment proves ineffective, laboratory work is ordered and the diagnosis then made. From a community health perspective, a spike in the number of prescriptions for Benadryl in one area could be used as an indicator of a possible smallpox outbreak. A CHSS should be able to automatically detect such spike and raise an alarm early enough to contain the outbreak [2] .",

RODS processes sales of over-the-counter (OTC) healthcare products in a similar manner, but currently receives such data in batch mode on a daily basis.

People often engage in self-care with OTC medications such as cough syrups before seeking professional medical care. RODS' National Retail Data Monitor (NRDM) receives data daily from 10,000 stores/pharmacies that sell healthcare products. These stores belong to national chains that process sales data centrally and utilise Universal Product Bar Codes (UPC codes) and scanners to collect sales information at the cash register. The high degree of retail sales data automation enables NRDM to collect information from thousands of store locations in near real time for use in public health surveillance. Algorithms monitor the data automatically every day to detect unusual sales patterns. The current niche for NRDM is early detection of a mass exposure of a large number of people through air, food, or water contamination (a cohort exposure). Soon after such an exposure, the cohort will become symptomatic, and, depending on the symptoms, may begin self-treatment and then either recover or seek medical care. If the cohort is large enough, sales of OTC healthcare products will increase significantly above the normal, background sales level. The announced longerterm project plans include the expansion of monitoring to the level of selected prescription medications based on another standard coding system that is used in industry data systems [56] .",

RODS also has a Web-based user interface that supports temporal and spatial analyses. RODS' password-protected, encrypted Web site allows users to review healthcare registration and sales of OTC healthcare products on epidemic plots and maps. When a user logs in, RODS will check the user's profile and will display data only for his or her health department's jurisdiction [55, 56] . Because populations and market share coverage for sales of OTC healthcare products differ between Zip Codes, plotting raw sales counts is uninformative. NRDM maps represent a novel approach to presenting surveillance data. They plot for each Zip Code -using the colours green, blue, yellow, orange, and red to indicate increasing levels of concern -how \"unusual\" sales were for the day in question relative to historical patterns of sales for that Zip Code. In particular, the colours represent the number of standard deviations by which the observed sales of a product category in a Zip Code deviate from the expected counts. In presenting the data in this fashion, the map serves as a device to focus the user's attention on the degree(s) of anomaly. A user can quickly spot whether the map is predominantly green with a scattering of blue Zip Codes as would be expected, or whether there are confluent or linear patterns of blue, yellow, orange, or red indicating \"unusual\" sales activities. The map monitor computes the number of standard deviations relative to a residual signal that has zero mean and constant variation after removal of weekly and longer trends in the data by wavelet transformation. This procedure is intended to produce a \"normalised\" map that is very sensitive to sudden increases in product counts as would be the case in a medium-to large-scale air, food, or water contamination. Alternative data transformations are possible using differ-ent signal processing approaches focused on detecting more gradual increases. RODS researchers plan in the near future to screen the maps automatically with spatial scan statistics to identify those with anomalies suggesting a need for human review [56] .",

From a community health perspective, GIS could potentially act as powerful evidence-based practice tools for early problem detection and solving. When properly used, GIS can: inform and educate (professionals and the public); empower decision-making at all levels; help in planning and tweaking clinically and cost-effective actions, in predicting outcomes before making any financial commitments and ascribing priorities in a climate of finite resources; change practices; and continually monitor and analyse changes, as well as sentinel events.",

A critical review is needed of the evidence for GIS for specific preventable, mitigable and treatable health conditions. A good starting point may be the CDC \"Guide to Community Preventive Services\" http://www.thecommunityguide.org/. Topics identified in this guide (e.g., alcohol abuse, cancer, diabetes, mental health, motor vehicle occupant injury, oral health, physical activity, sexual behaviour, social environment, tobacco product use, vaccine preventable diseases, violence) could be addressed one by one by conducting a focused review of GIS literature on each topic, and then categorising the \"nature of the scientific evidence\" documenting whether GIS add any value to our understanding and management of the reviewed topic and/or the evidence that it would be feasible and cost-effective for the respective public health programmes tackling the reviewed topic to adopt GIS. This could inform the development of successful GIS business plans for the health conditions under consideration. A good example that comes to mind in this context is the 73-page \"GIS for cancer\" handbook titled \"Using Geographic Information Systems Technology in the Collection, Analysis, and Presentation of Cancer Registry Data: A Handbook of Basic Practices\" that was published by the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries [118] . (However, as is the case with any country-specific GIS research and publications, care should be exercised when extending findings and recommendations to other countries with different health and healthcare system settings.)",

Also organising focus groups that bring together programme administrators, practitioners and the public is required to complement the expected gaps and deficiencies in current GIS literature, and to define the key questions that decision makers would want to be able to answer with GIS for any health condition under review, and think explicitly about what data and methods should be used to answer those questions.",

Spatial data and GIS are still not mentioned in any main UK health information strategy or policy document (the US seems to be somewhat ahead of the UK in this respect). Table 1 summarises the main factors hindering the wider use of GIS within NHS organisations, and precluding adequate spatial data exchange and collaboration between the NHS and other organisations and local authorities. Researchers have come to the conclusion that more networking is needed of people, skills, expertise and data. This can be achieved by establishing networks of GIS users from both the NHS and local authorities at local and higher levels to encourage more joined-up working, share expertise and experiences, as well as establish contacts and trust, and raise the awareness of the types of data that are held by different organisations. A dedicated Web site acting as forum or virtual network on the Web is one way to realise these networks of GIS users. However, this author thinks that a common coherent UK initiative is urgently needed to build a comprehensive national, multi-agency spatio-temporal health information infrastructure functioning proactively in real time.",

But soon it became clear that the pure technical approach had to be replaced by a more holistic approach comprising organisational, political and technical matters at the different local, national, regional, and global levels. The concept of \"Spatial Data Infrastructure\" (SDI) became a reality. SDI principles originated in two US National Research Council reports in the early 1990s [124, 125] . SDIs first developed outside the health sector, and then belatedly health began to discover their importance in many applications. SDIs contain the people and institutions that make, maintain, and make accessible, the foundation data layers that permit the custodians of other data layers to attach their data to the foundation layers. It must be stressed that the contents of a national health spatial data infrastructure are not just any georeferenced health data but, in addition, the foundation spatial data to which health data can be attached. The foundation layers for a health spatial data and information infrastructure are best exemplified in the US by PCSAs and Hospital Service Area data layers provided by the Dartmouth Project (see above). In a personal e-mail communication with Professor Gerard Rushton, he argues PCSAs and Hospital Service Area data layers are spatial data foundation layers because other US health data often collected and maintained locally, are more valuable after they have been linked to these layers (Gerard Rushton, Department of Geography, University of Iowa, personal communication -December 2003).",

Users must develop increased sensitivity to and awareness of the various types of data errors and uncertainty, as well as competency in techniques for recognising and reducing their negative impact on conclusions drawn from spatial analysis. There is also a need for intelligent tools specifically designed for public health, and seamlessly weaved into everyday public health workflows and decision-making processes to enable users to focus and spend the larger part of their work time on what they want to achieve rather than on learning and overcoming the limitations of tools they are supposed to use to achieve their goals. The tools must be able to convey meaningful, bottom-line conclusions that can support the decision maker rather than just outputting bunches of facts. The ideal tools also need to be fault-tolerant and capable of analysing and presenting assembled data in ways that facilitate only appropriate interpretations of integrated data. This can be achieved by using some form of user friendly, \"intelligent\", goal-oriented health GIS wizards (based on robust statistical and epidemiological methods where appropriate), so that only valid results and maps are produced, even when users attempt to select inappropriate settings for a particular analysis.",

According to Openshaw, the ideal spatial analysis methods should be safe and user friendly for use by people with no higher degrees in statistical or spatial sciences. The methods should also respond to user needs on the ground, be highly automated, explicitly handle spatial data imprecision, and produce self-evident results that can be mapped and communicated to non-experts. Openshaw's proposed typology of methods includes among others \"pattern spotters and testers\" and \"relationship seekers and provers\" [130] .",

Data have to be collected uniformly and include specifications for update frequency and allowed dissemination in different emergency and non-emergency situations, and for purposes other than those for which they were originally collected. It is recommended that a combined top-down and bottom-up incremental (phased) implementation approach be adopted. Longerterm solutions usually require a series of small successes, carefully built upon in incremental fashion over time. In fact, much of the wider vision of a national/regional/global public health spatial data and information infrastructure can be gradually and incrementally achieved through disparately funded and managed short-term projects, as long as we can ensure that these short-term projects make a useful and lasting contribution towards this wider vision. Short-term bottom-up projects can feed valuable experience into the formulation and revision of the relevant policies and strategies. Moreover, by creating \"proof of concept and benefits applications\", these projects can be also used to gain and continue political support for the wider vision, and secure further funding towards achieving it.",
