The newly developed MAC-ELISA had a specificity and sensitivity of 100% as evaluated by using sera from healthy volunteers and patients with laboratoryconfirmed SARS. Using serial serum samples collected from SARS patients, the times to seroconversion were determined by IgM antibody detection after SARS-CoV infection. The median time to seroconversion detection was 8 days (range, 5 to 17 days) after disease onset, and the seroconversion rates after the onset of illness were 33% by the first week, 97% by the second week, and 100% by the third week. Compared with the results of our previous report on the detection of IgG, the median seroconversion time by IgM detection was 3 days earlier and the seroconversion rate by the second week after the illness for IgM was significantly higher than by IgG assay. Our results indicating that the IgM response appears earlier than IgG after SARS-CoV infection in consistent with those for other pathogens. Our newly developed MAC-ELISA system offers a new alternative for the confirmation of SARS-CoV infection.",

            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a human disease associated with pneumonia that has emerged recently (5, 7, 10, 15) . After the emergence of the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), there were several reports dealing with the detection of specific immunoglobulin M (IgM) by indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or indirect immunofluorescent assay (IFA) (1, 3, 13) . In these studies, IgM antibodies became detectable later than IgG antibodies, which is in contrast to the phenomena described for most known pathogens. The reason for an earlier IgG response is unclear. It may be due to the earlier development of IgG antibodies than IgM antibodies, or alternatively, the observation may just reflect the low sensitivity of the assays for the detection of IgM. It is known that the detection of IgM without the separation of IgG yields higher rates of false-positive and false-negative results (3) . Therefore, the serological response of SARS-CoVinfected patients should be examined using more-sensitive methods.",

A SARS-CoV-specific IgM test was done by coating the wells of immunoplates with goat anti-human IgM antibody, adding patient or control sera to the anti-IgM-coated wells, and then allowing the captured IgM to react with the recombinant SARS-CoV N\u232c121 protein. Captured SARS-CoV N\u232c121 protein was detected with SARS-CoV virus hyperimmune mouse ascitic fluid. Bound anti-N\u232c121 protein antibody was detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG, followed by H 2 O 2 -ABTS (2,2\u0408-azino-diethylbenzothiazolinesulfonic acid) substrate. Optimal dilutions of all reagents were determined by checkerboard titration with reference sera. The reference sera were selected according to our preliminary experimental results and serum availability. The reference sera were used for inner control of the assay. The actual procedures were as follows. Ninety-six-well Falcon immunoplates (Becton Dickinson) were coated with 100 l of a 1:250 dilution of goat anti-human IgM (BioSource International) diluted in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (pH 7.4), and plate coating was conducted at 4\u00b0C overnight. The plates were then washed five times with PBS-T (PBS plus 0.1% Tween 20) before they were allowed to react with the patient serum. The patient serum samples were diluted at a 1:100 dilution in assay diluent (PBS-T plus 5% skim milk). Each patient serum was added to four wells of the plate. The patient samples were incubated on the plates for 1 h at 37\u00b0C, followed by washing. Antigen (purified recombinant truncated SARS-CoV N\u232c121 protein) was then added at a concentration of 0.2 g (in assay diluent) to the upper two wells, while assay diluent only was added to the lower two wells as a negative control, and the plate was incubated for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. The plates were washed, and a 1:4,000 dilution of an anti-SARS CoV N\u232c121 protein hyperimmune mouse polyclonal ascitic fluid was added and incubated for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. The plates were washed, a 1:5,000 dilution of goat anti-mouse IgG-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Biosource, CA) was added, and the mixture was incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. The plates were washed, 100 l of an ABTS-peroxidase substrate (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories) was added, and the plates were incubated in the dark for 30 min at 37\u00b0C. Optical densities (OD) were measured at 405 nm. The specific activity of each serum (net OD) was calculated by subtracting the nonspecific background OD in the wells without antigen from the specific OD in the wells with SARS-CoV N\u232c121 protein antigen. The values reported represent the averages of results from duplicate wells for each sample. On all test plates, 1:100 dilutions of negative control, weakly positive control (the OD of the positive samples over the OD of the negative control [P/N] was approximately equal to 5), and strongly positive control (P/N \u0425 20) serum samples were run simultaneously. The negative control was one of the blood samples from the 175 healthy subjects. The OD value for this control was established from the mean OD for the 175 SARS-negative subjects plus 2 standard deviations. Each sample was tested in duplicate, and the mean OD for each sample was calculated. The cutoff for the assay was twice the mean OD for the negative control serum sample (P/N \u0546 2).",

            "text": "IgM antibody is produced early in the immune response and rises rapidly during the disease course, and hence the detection of IgM antibody is a valuable tool for the rapid diagnosis of acute viral infections (6) . The MAC-ELISA was designed specifically for IgM. The capture format of the MAC-ELISA eliminates any potential background caused by extraneous antibody, which in turn results in less frequent nonspecific reactions as well as in the absence of false-positive results on March 24, 2020 by guest http://cvi.asm.org/ caused by rheumatoid factor. Competition between IgM and IgG for antigen binding is minimized, reducing the occurrence of false-negative results, thus allowing more-reliable and -sensitive detection of IgM antibody against the antigen (8, 9, 11) . After the emergence of SARS-CoV, several studies dealing with the detection of specific IgM antibody by using indirect ELISA or the IFA method have been reported. Woo et al. reported that IgM antibodies became detectable later than IgG antibodies in both the indirect ELISA and the IFA (13). Hsueh et al. reported that IgG seroconversion occurred simultaneously, or 1 day earlier, than IgM seroconversion by IFA. They absorbed IgG before the detection of IgM to avoid the interference of IgG antibody (3). Chang et al. also reported a similar IgG IgM subclass response after SARS-CoV infection (1) . In all these studies, IgM antibodies became detectable later than or simultaneously with IgG antibodies, which is in contrast to the phenomena described for most of the known pathogens, against which IgM antibodies often appear a few days earlier than IgG antibodies. It is known that the detection of IgM antibodies without separating IgG antibodies yields higher rates of false-positive and false-negative results. Hence, the reason for the earlier IgG response observed in the studies mentioned above may be because of the low sensitivity of their assay systems for the detection of IgM, rather than the biology of the host immune response.",

In our newly developed system, the use of infectious virus for antigen production, which requires a high level of microbiological security and a proper way to inactivate and to monitor the inactivation process of the virus, is not required. Hence, it is a safer method for diagnosis. The advantages of using a prokaryotic host to produce recombinant protein would be considerable due to the ease of scale-up and the low costs involved in growing bacteria. The recombinant product can be obtained within a relatively short time (within 1 week after cloning), and the expression and purification procedures are simple and easy to perform. From 1 liter of cultured bacterial medium, we obtained more than 10 mg of purified N\u232c121 protein. Our method would be much less expensive for the preparation of antigen than using virus-infected cell culture or the eukaryotic expression systems. It would be especially useful in developing countries as well as in cases of large-scale epidemiological investigations.",
