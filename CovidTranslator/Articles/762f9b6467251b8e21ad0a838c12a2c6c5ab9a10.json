            "text": "As one of the first replicase proteins to be translated and processed, the precise mechanism of action of nsp2 is an attractive target for virological studies. Site-directed mutations in either the nsp1/nsp2 or nsp2/nsp3 cleavage sites allowed virus replication, as did mutations in the papain-like proteinase (PLP) domain of nsp3. Moreover, deletion of nsp2 in MHV and SARS-CoV resulted in viable mutant viruses, albeit with a slight attenuation of viral growth and RNA synthesis (Denison et al., 2004; Graham et al., 2005; Graham & Denison, 2006) . Although it has been reported that nsp2 is not necessary for coronavirus replication and transcription, its low similarity in sequence and structure implies that it might function in host interplay. When tested by yeast two-hybrid matrix analysis, a large number of interactions between SARS-CoV nsp2 and other viral proteins were discovered in SARS-CoV (Pan et al., 2008; von Brunn et al., 2007) . Furthermore, expression of MHV nsp2 from alternative locations could not complement the modest growth defects caused by nsp2 deletion, indicating that the timing and/or interactions resulting from expression between nsp1 and nsp3 might be crucial for the function of nsp2 and for optimal replication (Gadlage et al., 2008) . In the work of Marne and coworkers, MHV nsp2 appeared to be more efficiently recruited to the replication-transcription complex (RTC) than other nsps and to be contained in rigid protein-protein interaction networks in the RTC (Hagemeijer et al., 2010) . In addition, prohibitin 1 (PHB1) and PHB2, two proteins involved in mitochondrial biogenesis and intracellular signalling, have been identified to interact with SARS nsp2 in vitro (Cornillez-Ty et al., 2009) . To gain a better understanding of the structural details and functional mechanism of coronavirus nsp2, we have determined the crystal structures of the N-terminal domain of IBV nsp2 (Yang et al., 2009) and SARS-CoV nsp2 (unpublished work). Here, we report the successful cloning, overexpression, purification and crystallization of IBV nsp2 and the preliminary characterization of selenomethionylderivative IBV nsp2 crystals by X-ray analysis.",

The PCR conditions were 30 cycles of 30 s at 367 K, 30 s at 328 K and 2 min at 345 K. Digested PCR products were inserted into a BamHI/XhoI-digested pGEX-6p-1 vector (Amersham Biosciences). After transformation into Escherichia coli Top10, positive clones were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The final protein product contained five additional residues (GPLGS) at the N-terminus and a 6\u00c2His tag at the C-terminus, with a theoretical molecular mass of 76 180 Da.",
