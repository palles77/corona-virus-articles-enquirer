MS liquid medium supplemented with 0.01 mg l -1 of NAA was most effective for stolon proliferation. Extensive proliferation of stolon and shoot regeneration was achieved on medium containing 3 % sucrose with 0.01 mg l -1 NAA. Stolons with nodes showing growth was transferred under light for plantlet regeneration in the same medium. This paper is the first report in G. glabra describing a complete regeneration procedure via in vitro stolon proliferation along with quantitative data for glycyrrhizin and genetic fidelity of plant regenerated in vitro there from. In vitro stolon proliferation described here would be an efficient way for regeneration of plants for functional genomics studies and better understanding of glycyrrhizin (GA) metabolism.",

            "text": "Roots and stolons of Glycyrrhiza plants (G. uralensis Fisch. and G. glabra L., Fabaceae) are highly valued commercial products used in oriental medicine (Anonymous 2005) . In modern medicine it is considered an important crude drug for its various pharmacological activities (Jatav et al. 2011) including anti-diabetic, anti-inflammatory (Finney and Somers 1958) , hepato-protective, anti-ulcer and anti-allergic (Park et al. 2004) . Glycyrrhizin also has antiviral activity (Fiore et al. 2008 ) against various DNA and RNA viruses, including HIV (Ito et al. 1988 ) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-associated corona virus (Cinatl et al. 2003) . In recent studies it is shown to selectively block the tumor COX-2 pathway and suppress colon carcinogenesis in mice and humans (Zhang et al. 2009 ). Glycyrrhizin, an oleanane type terpenoid saponin, and its derivative compounds are exclusively obtained from the dried roots and stolons of licorice. Chemical analyses have failed to detect them in the aerial part (Hayashi et al. 1988 ); the plants have been indiscriminately exploited to meet the high demand, resulting in desertification of the habitat. The plant is naturally found in areas restricted to Central and South China, Russia and Mediterranean regions. Under cultivation, the plant is rarely propagated by seeds due to its hard testa (Gupta et al. 1997) .Vegetative propagation of the plant is annual and germination percentage is low, being highly under the influence of environmental conditions. Developing in vitro regeneration methods of Glycyrrhiza glabra utilizing different explants viz, stem segments (Thengane et al. 1998 ) and axillary bud (Shah and Dalal 1980) to produce multiple shoots (Henry et al. 1991) , shoot regeneration from callus (Wongwicha et al. 2008) shoots differentiation and clonal propagation (Mousa et al. 2006) has been the subject of several studies. Recent study by Mehrotra et al. (2012) has demonstrated the potential of encapsulated in vitro-grown axillary micro-shoots of Glycyrrhiza glabra in long-term storage and year round availability of germplasm for commercial cultivation. Hairy root induction using Agrobacterium rhizogenes have been recently developed in G. glabra (Li et al. 2000; Shirazi et al. 2012) showing the feasibility to cultivate these transformed roots in air lift bioreactors (Mehrotra et al. 2008) . Tissue culture techniques have raised expectation regarding possibility of their application for propagation and understanding of glycyrrhizin biosynthesis. Tissue culture method to propagate G. glabra on commercial scale has also been reported by Shah and Dalal (1980) . Recent studies regarding glycyrrhizin production by in vitro cultures have shown contrasting and conflicting results. Most of the attempts to detect glycyrrhizin from cultured tissues of G. glabra have been unsuccessful (Hayashi et al. 1988; Saito et al. 1990; Ayabe et al. 1990; Toivonen and Rosenqvist 1995) . Callus and cell suspension cultures of selected G. glabra clones have shown production of glycyrrhizin, detected using TLC-tentative analysis (Nagat et al. 2007) . Similarly, Wongwicha et al. (2008) reported glycyrrhizin production in callus cultures of G. uralensis (36.52 mg g -1 ), G. glabra (14.39 mg g -1 ), and G. inflata (16.14 mg g -1 ).",

Roots mostly induced at the proximal end of the whole leaf cultured on medium containing combination of Kn (1.0 mg l -1 ) with NAA or IBA (1.0 mg l -1 ) and IAA (1.0 mg l -1 ) alone (Fig. 1a, b) . Addition of cytokinin or BAP along with IAA or NAA resulted in synergistic influence on evoking response on the leaf segments. The root culture proliferates very rapidly on transferring roots in liquid medium with 0.01 mg l -1 NAA, with the passage of time roots transferred to liquid medium assumed a mat like appearance within a period of 3 weeks. (Table 1) . With the passage of time elongated roots slowly got transformed into thick and stout pale white or light brown stolons in medium under dark conditions. Several shoot primordial could be observed on stolons within 3 weeks on MS medium containing 3 % sucrose with 1.0 mg l -1 NAA. Medium supplemented with NAA ( Fig. 1c) was found most suitable for shoot differentiation. Root differentiation and whole plantlet regeneration was observed after 2 subculture passages within 3 weeks when kept under light (Fig. 1c, d) . Cultured stolons retained characteristic color similar to field grown stolons. Shoot bud and its differentiation in well developed shoots occurred mostly on middle portion of in vitro stolon which indicated that certain degree of maturity of stolon is required prior to shoot differentiation. On transferring, segments of cultured stolons to MS media treatment containing NAA (0.01 mg l -1) resulted in[8 shoots from each stolon segment (3 cm). The shoots obtained were found to root efficiently and resulted in complete plantlets. These were further maintained on the same medium under illumination. Plantlets were successfully acclimatized to soil in pots with 70 % survival, plants grew normal and vigorously under green house conditions (Fig. 1e, f ; Table 2 ).The present described procedure is being reported for the first time for G. glabra where root cultures established in vitro could be effectively utilized to retrieve high-frequency plant regeneration via stolon proliferation. The present results provide protocol for complete in vitro regeneration utilizing excised in vitro regenerated roots leading to stolon proliferation and subsequent in vitro regeneration in G. glabra. Using present procedure 20-25 plants/stolon could be produced within 3 months. The root cultures are advantageous over other explants in terms of their easy manipulation and high regenerative potential (Franklin et al. 2004) . However, such report in other species of Glycyrrhiza (G. uralensis) is available (Kojoma et al. 2010) . The present described method holds promise in being simple, reproducible and high throughput for mass cloning of 'elite' genotypes of G. glabra. The application of developed procedure could be in providing large number of G. glabra plants in comparison to earlier published reports (Shah and Dalal 1980; Henry et al. 1991; Mousa et al. 2006 ). Regenerated plantlets derived through stolon proliferation were subjected to molecular analysis in order to evaluate their genetic uniformity and/or detect likely existing variations among in vitro-derived plantlets. Ten ISSR primers were used for evaluating ISSR fingerprinting successfully validated true-to-type of in vitro raised regenerates (Fig. 1g ). As such the described method could be used for mass cloning with minimum possibility of any in vitro-induced variability.",
