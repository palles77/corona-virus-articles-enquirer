The typical BOD 5 of raw sewage ranges from 110 to 440 mg/l (see Example Calculation 24.1). Conventional sewage treatment will reduce this by 95%. Chemical oxygen demand (COD) is the amount of oxygen necessary to oxidize all of the organic carbon completely to CO 2 and H 2 O. COD is measured by oxidation with potassium dichromate (K 2 Cr 2 O 7 ) in the presence of sulfuric acid and silver, and is expressed in milligrams per liter. In general, 1 g of carbohydrate or 1 g of protein is approximately equivalent to 1 g of COD. Normally, the ratio BOD/COD is approximately 0.5. When this ratio falls below 0.3, it means that the sample contains large amounts of organic compounds that are not easily biodegraded.",

The peak incidence of many enteric infections is seasonal in temperate climates. Thus, the highest incidence of enterovirus infection is during the late summer and early fall. Rotavirus infections tend to peak in the early winter, and Cryptosporidium infections peak in the early spring and fall. The reason for the seasonality of enteric infections is not completely understood, but several factors may play a role. It may be associated with the survival of different agents in the environment during the different seasons. Giardia , for example, can survive winter temperatures very well. Alternatively, excretion differences among animal reservoirs may be involved, as is the case with Cryptosporidium . Finally, it may well be that greater exposure to contaminated water, as in swimming, is the explanation for increased incidence in the summer months.",

The biofilm that forms on the surface of the filter medium is called a zooleal film. It is composed of bacteria, fungi, algae, and protozoa. Over time, the increase in biofilm thickness leads to limited oxygen diffusion to the deeper layers of the biofilm, creating an anaerobic environment near the filter medium surface. As a result, the organisms eventually slough from the surface and a new biofilm is formed. BOD removal by trickling filters is approximately 85% for low-rate filters (U. S. EPA, 1977) . Effluent from the trickling filter usually passes into a final clarifier to further separate solids from effluent ( Fig. 24 .6 ). ",

            "text": "Aeration-tank digestion is also known as the activated sludge process. In the United States, wastewater is most commonly treated by this process. Effluent from primary treatment is pumped into a tank and mixed with a bacteria-rich slurry known as activated sludge. Air or pure oxygen pumped through the mixture encourages bacterial growth and decomposition of the organic material. The material then goes to a secondary settling tank, where water is siphoned off the top of the tank and sludge is removed from the bottom. Some of the sludge is used as an inoculum for primary effluent. The remainder of the sludge, known as secondary sludge, is removed. This secondary sludge is added to primary sludge from primary treatment, and subsequently indigenous anaerobic digestion occurs ( Fig. 24 .6 ). The end product of this process is known as biosolids (see Section 24.8). The concentration of pathogens is reduced in the activated sludge process by antagonistic microorganisms as well as by adsorption to or incorporation in the secondary sludge.

FIGURE 24.8 Secondary treatment: an aeration basin. From Pepper, Gerba, and Brusseau, 2006. An important characteristic of the activated sludge process is the recycling of a large proportion of the biomass. This results in a large number of microorganisms that oxidize organic matter in a relatively short time ( Bitton, 2005 ) . The detention time in the aeration basin varies from four to eight hours. The content of the aeration tank is referred to as the mixed-liquor suspended solids (MLSS). The organic part of the MLSS is called the mixed-liquor volatile suspended solids (MLVSS), which is the nonmicrobial organic matter as well as dead and living microorganisms and cell debris. The activated sludge process must be controlled to maintain a proper ratio of substrate (organic load) to microorganisms or food-to-microorganism ratio (F/M) ( Bitton, 2005 ) . This is expressed as BOD per kilogram per day and is calculated as",

This tank has two functions: clarification and thickening. For routine operation, sludge settleability is determined by use of the sludge volume index (SVI) ( Bitton, 2005 ) . SVI is determined by the following formula: Eq. 24.4) where V \u03ed volume of settled sludge after 30 minutes (ml/l). The microbial biomass produced in the aeration tank must settle properly from suspension so that it may be wasted or returned to the aeration tank. Good settling occurs when the sludge microorganisms are in the endogenous phase, which occurs when carbon and energy sources are limited, and the microbial specific growth rate is local (Bitton, 2005) . A mean cell residence time of three to four days is necessary for effective settling (Metcalf and Eddy, 2003) . Poor settling may also be caused by sudden changes in temperature, pH, absence of nutrients, and presence of toxic metals and organics. A common problem in the activated sludge process is filamentous bulking, which consists of slow settling and poor compaction of solids in the clarifier. Filamentous bulking is usually caused by the excessive growth of filamentous microorganisms. The filaments produced by these bacteria interfere with sludge settling and compaction. A high SVI ( \u03fe 150 ml/g) indicates bulking conditions. Filamentous bacteria are able to predominate under conditions of low dissolved oxygen, low F/M, low nutrients, and high sulfide levels. Filamentous bacteria can be controlled by treating the return sludge with chlorine or hydrogen peroxide to kill filamentous microorganisms selectively. ",

            "text": "Compared with other biological treatment methods (i.e., trickling filters), activated sludge is relatively efficient in reducing the numbers of pathogens in raw wastewater. Both sedimentation and aeration play a role in pathogen reduction. Primary sedimentation is more effective for the removal of the larger pathogens such as helminth eggs, but solid-associated bacteria and even viruses are also removed. During aeration, pathogens are inactivated by antagonistic microorganisms and by environmental factors such as temperature. The greatest removal probably occurs by adsorption or entrapment of the organisms within the biological floc that forms. The ability of activated sludge to remove viruses is related to the ability to remove solids. This is because viruses tend to be solid associated, and are subject to removal along with the floc. Activated sludge typically removes 90% of the enteric bacteria and 90-99% of the enteroviruses and rotaviruses ( Rao et al. , 1986 ) . Ninety percent of Giardia and Cryptosporidium can also be removed ( Rose and Carnahan, 1992 ) , being largely concentrated in the sludge. Because of their large size, helminth eggs are effectively removed by sedimentation and are rarely found in sewage effluent in the United States, although they may be detected in the sludge. However, although the removal of the enteric pathogens may seem large, it is important to remember that initial concentrations are also large (i.e., the concentration of all enteric viruses in 1 liter of raw sewage may be as high as 100,000 in some parts of the world). Tertiary treatment processes involving physicochemical processes can be effective in further reducing the concentration of pathogens and enhancing the effectiveness of disinfection processes by the removal of soluble and particulate organic matter ( Table 24 .6 ). Filtration is probably the most common tertiary treatment process. Mixed-media filtration is most effective in the reduction of protozoan parasites. Usually, greater removal of Giardia cysts occurs than of Cryptosporidium oocysts because of the larger size of the cysts ( Rose and Carnahan, 1992 ) . Removal of enteroviruses and indicator bacteria is usually 90% or less. Addition of coagulant can increase the removal of poliovirus to 99% (U. S. EPA, 1992a) .",

In rural areas of developing countries these are still used. These pit toilets, however, often allowed untreated wastes to seep into the groundwater, allowing pathogens to contaminate drinking water supplies. This risk to public health led to the development of septic tanks and properly constructed drain fields. Primarily, septic tanks serve as repositories where solids are separated from incoming wastewater and biological digestion of the waste organic matter can take place under anaerobic conditions. In 1997, 25% of the homes in the United States depended on septic tanks. Approximately 33% of all new homes constructed use septic tanks. Most septic tanks are located in the eastern United States ( Fig. 24.17 ) . In a typical septic tank system ( Fig. 24.18 ) , the wastewater and sewage enter a tank made of concrete, metal, or fiberglass. There, grease and oils rise to the top as scum, and solids settle to the bottom. The wastewater and sewage then undergo anaerobic bacterial decomposition, resulting in the production of a sludge. The wastewater usually remains in the septic tank for just 24-72 h, after which it is channeled out to a drain field. This drain field or leach field is composed of small perforated pipes that are embedded in gravel below the surface of the soil.

As suburban population densities increase, however, groundwater and surface water pollution may arise, indicating a need to shift to a commercial municipal sewage system. (In fact, private septic systems are sometimes banned in many suburban areas.) Moreover, septic tanks are not appropriate for every area of the country. They do not work well, for example, in cold, rainy climates, where the drain field may be too wet for proper evaporation, or in areas where the water table is shallow.

The three basic methods used in the application of sewage effluents to land include low-rate irrigation, overland flow, and high-rate infiltration. Characteristics of each of these are listed in Table 24 . 8 . The choice of a given method depends on the conditions prevailing at the site under consideration (loading rates, methods of irrigation, crops, and expected treatment). With low-rate irrigation ( Fig. 24.19A ), sewage effluents are applied by sprinkling or by surface application at a rate of 1.5 to 10 cm per week. Two-thirds of the water is taken up by crops or lost by evaporation, and the remainder percolates through the soil matrix. The system must be designed to maximize denitrification in order to avoid pollution of groundwater by nitrates. Phosphorus is immobilized within the soil matrix by fixation or precipitation. The irrigation method is used primarily by small communities and requires large areas, generally on the order of 5-6 hectares per 1000 people. In the overland flow method ( Fig. 24.19B ), wastewater effluents are allowed to flow for a distance of 50-100 m along a 2-8% vegetated slope and are collected in a ditch. The loading rate of wastewater ranges from 5 to 14 cm a week. Only about 10% of the water percolates through the soil, compared with 60% that runs off into the ditch. The remainder is lost as evapotranspiration. This system requires clay soils with low permeability and infiltration.",

Because of limited water resources in the western United States, reuse is considered essential. Usually, stricter treatment and microbial standards must be met before land application. The highest degree of treatment is required when wastewater will be used for food crop irrigation, with lesser treatment for landscape irrigation or fiber crops. For example, the state of California requires no disinfection of wastewater for irrigation and no limits on coliform bacteria. However, if the reclaimed wastewater is used for surface irrigation of food crops and open landscaped areas, chemical coagulation (to precipitate suspended matter), followed by filtration and disinfection to reduce the coliform concentration to 2.2/100 ml is required.

However, as some removal of pathogens can be expected, treatment requirements may be less. The degree of treatment needed may be influenced by the amount or time it takes the reclaimed water to travel from the infiltration site to the point of extraction, and the depth of the unsaturated zone. The greatest concern has been with the transport of viruses, which, because of their small size, have the greatest chance of traveling large distances within the subsurface. Factors that influence the transport of viruses are discussed in Chapter 19. Generally, several meters of moderately fine-textured, continuous soil is necessary for virus reductions of 99.9% or more ( Yates, 1994 ) .",

The system is composed of several components that allows for various treatments and storage of tertiary effluent ( Figure 24 .23 ). A tertiary treatment plant filters the secondary effluent (to reduce turbidity and microorganisms) and provides additional disinfection. The backwash from the filters is then discharged into an artificial wetland for treatment. When the water exits the wetland it is discharged into infiltration basins, where it is further treated. In times of low reclaimed water demand (winter) the tertiary effluent may be discharged directly into the infiltration basins. The subsurface aquifer is then used as a storage facility, the water being pumped to the surface (extraction) when needed during periods of peak demand.",

Thickening is usually done to increase the solids content of the sludge. This can be achieved via centrifugation, which increases the solids content to approximately 12%. Dewatering can further concentrate the solids content to 20-40%. This is normally achieved via filtration or by the use of drying beds. Conditioning enhances the separation of solids from the liquid phase.

By 1875 about 50 farms were utilizing land treatment in England, as were many others close to other major cities in Europe. In the United States, sewage farms were established by about 1900. At this same time, primary sedimentation and secondary biological treatment were introduced as a rudimentary form of wastewater treatment, and land application of sludges began. It is interesting to note that prior to wastewater treatment, \" sludge \" per se did not exist. Municipal sludge in Ohio was used as a fertilizer as early as 1907.

When confronted with an antibiotic, there need only be one bacterial cell with a genetic or mutational change, which confers resistance to that antibiotic, that subsequently allows for the proliferation of antibiotic resistant bacteria. Thus the more that antibiotics are used, the greater the likelihood of antibiotic resistant strains developing. The greatest concern with antibiotic resistance is the potential for human pathogenic strains to become resistant to overused antibiotics, which subsequently cannot contain the infectious agent. The widespread sometimes indiscriminant use of antibiotics has raised the question: \" Can antibiotic resistance genes be transferred from nonpathogenic bacteria to human pathogenic strains in the environment? \" Brooks et al. (2006) evaluated the incidence of antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARB) in biosolids and a variety of other environmental samples and foodstuffs. Table 24 .10 shows that Class B biosolids did not contain unusually high numbers of ARB; in fact, the relative incidence was less than that found in pristine soil. Interestingly, ARB concentrations were also lower than those found in common foodstuffs such as lettuce. Therefore, food itself could be an important route of exposure to ARB. Gene transfer events in soil are thought to be relatively infrequent without selective pressure ( Neilson et al. , 1994 ) , which reduces the risk of antibiotic resistance gene transfer to human pathogenic bacteria. Finally, note that soil itself is the original source of human antibiotics.",

For example, swine barns were found to have mean concentrations of endotoxin of 4385 EU/m 3 ( Duchaine et al. , 2001 ) , while composting plants ranged from 10 to 400 EU/m 3 . Since the relevance of endotoxin to human health is via inhalation, the potential for aerosolization of endotoxin during land application of biosolids has also recently caused concern. One study shows that endotoxin values measured during biosolids application are comparable to those found in untreated agricultural soils ( Table 24 .11 ). Therefore, aerosolization of soil particles can result in endotoxin aerosolization, regardless of whether biosolids are involved . This is not surprising since bacterial concentrations in soil routinely exceed 10 8 per gram, with a majority of bacteria being gram negative. Soil particles containing sorbed microbes can be aerosolized and hence act as a source of endotoxin. What levels of endotoxin are considered safe? It has been suggested that no more than a maximum air concentration of 1000 EU/m 3 should be considered safe until additional studies have been conducted . Most of the samples from wastewater treatment plants, land application of biosolids, and composting sites contain endotoxin levels less than this maximum concentration. Further, it can be noted that despite the presence of endotoxin within these operations, there is no evidence linking residential impact to these operations. This is likely because beyond these site boundaries endotoxin levels drop quickly to background concentrations.",

Animal manure would have no or low concentrations of BSE prions except possibly for wastes from slaughterhouses ( Ward et al. , 1984 ) .

This is not an easy question to answer partly because there are many different types of pathogens and partly because each environment that biosolids are incorporated into is different. That said, Class B biosolids routinely contain human pathogens (principal pathogens of concern in biosolids are identified in Chapter 26). The pathogens found in a particular source of biosolids reflect the incidence of disease in the community from which the biosolids are derived. Little is currently known about emerging pathogens such as the SARS virus (causing severe acute respiratory syndrome) in biosolids. However, regardless of the pathogen of concern, the major routes of potential human exposure to pathogens in biosolids remain the same, specifically via air, soil, and water. Exposure can also occur via vectors, such as flies, and to prevent this, so-called vector-attraction reduction requirements are enforced (NRC, 2002) . These involve specific biosolid treatment and rapid incorporation of land applied biosolids ( \u03fd 6 h).",

Viruses have the greater possibility to migrate through soil; however, they have been found to tightly bind to biosolids, and little leaching appears to occur. No direct cause and effect has been identified in surface or groundwater near land where biosolids has been applied. Pathogen survival in and transport through soil are considered together in this section. Human pathogens that are routinely found in domestic sewage sludge include viruses, bacteria, protozoan parasites, and helminths. Of those pathogens, viruses are the smallest and least complex, generally have a short survival period in soil, and have the greatest potential for transport in soil. Survival of viruses has been shown to be temperaturedependent and decreases as temperature increases. Soil type affects virus survival, with longer survival occurring on clay loam biosolids-amended soils than on sandy loam biosolids-amended soil.

Larger numbers of animals are being raised in concentrated animal feeding operations or CAFOsprincipally, feedlots, dairies, swine operations, poultry houses, and intensive aquaculture. The number of CAFOs more than doubled from 1982 to 1997, increasing from 5,000 to 11,200. Almost every county in the United States has a CAFO with more than 10,000 animals. This shift in production methods has changed the age-old method of reincorporation of animal wastes as manure on the farm where it was produced.
