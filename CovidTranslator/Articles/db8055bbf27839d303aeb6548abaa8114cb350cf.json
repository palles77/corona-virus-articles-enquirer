'RNA viruses', as used here, refers to viruses which have an RNA-only replication strategy, hence excluding the retrovimses. Because of the limited genetic stability of self-replicating RNAs, as a result of both error-prone replication and RNA recombination, it is likely that these RNA-based systems will be most useful for transient expression of RNAs and proteins. This review focuses on systems utilizing alphaviruses and influenza virus as examples of expression systems based upon virus groups with positive-sense and negative-sense replication strategies.

            "text": "The use of RNA virus replication machinery to express heterologous sequences depends on the ability to engineer recombinant RNA molecules. Although recombinant RNA techniques have been used in studies of the RNA bacteriophage Q[3, the methodology for amplification, in vitro cleavage, and ligation of RNA molecules to produce replication-competent viral RNAs remains cumbersome when compared to recombinant DNA technology. Therefore, most studies have relied upon cDNA intermediates that can be used to produce biologically active RNA molecules after either in vivo or in vitro transcription. As first shown for bromegrass mosaic virus [2] , in vitro transcription of cDNA templates by Escherichia coli, SP6, T7, or T3 DNA-dependent RNA polymerases can generate RNAs with precise 5' and 3' termini and specific infectivities that approach those of authentic virion RNAs. RNAs produced in vitro can be introduced into cells by microinjection, electroporation, or encapsulation in liposomes. A variety of compounds, such as diethylaminoethyl (DEAE) dextran or cationic lipid micelles, can enhance transfection efficiency. The transfection efficiencies of the different methods vary greatly among cell types, thus limiting the utility of RNA-based expression systems. In some cases, this has been circumvented by devising systems that allow amplification and packaging of recombinant RNAs into infectious virus particles or by expressing replication-competent RNA virus transcripts in vivo using recombinant DNA viruses, such as vaccinia (JA Lemm and CM Rice, unpublished data). Alternatively, bacteriophage transcription systems have also been used in vivo to produce replication-competent RNA transcripts [3,4\" ] which allow the use of DNA transfection methodologies.",

            "text": "RNA viruses can be viewed simplistically as consisting of cis-acting RNA elements that are necessary for replication, transcription, and packaging, together with genes encoding the viral proteins necessary for these processes. In this review several kinds of recombinant RNA molecules are described. 'Self-replicating RNAs' or 'replicons' will be used to describe RNAs that encode the viral proteins necessary for replication and that also contain the cis signals required for replication. RNAs containing the cis signals for replication (and in some cases for transcription and packaging) but requiring viral replicase functions to be supplied in trans will be referred to as 'defective RNAs'. A common property shared by all positive-strand viruses, which has been the key to their development as gene expression vectors, is the ability of naked virion RNA to initiate a productive infection after transfection of an appropriate host cell. The viral genome functions directly as an mRNA for production of all viral proteins necessary for synthesis of a genomelength complementary negative-strand RNA. Once synthesized, this negative-strand template is copied to produce additional genome-length positive strands and, for some viruses, and one or more subgenomic mR-NAs. RNA replication and transcription mechanisms are diverse for different positive-strand virus families. For the purpose of discussing the development of these viruses as vectors, two groups can be distinguished based on whether or not subgenomic mRNAs are synthesized. In the group employing the simplest strategy, which includes the picornavirus and flavivirus families, only genome-length positive strands are synthesized. Picornaviruses have been widely used for constructing chimeric viruses expressing short heterologous epitopes [5] and have found more limited use in the production of larger proteins [1, 6] . In the other group, which includes the togavirus and coronavirus families, negative strands also function as templates for high level transcription of one or more 3' co-terminal subgenomic mRNAs. As reviewed below, it is this expression strategy that has facilitated the use of alphaviruses for heterologous gene expression.",

For example, possible unpredictable and deleterious effects of nuclear splicing on expression of heterologous RNAs are eliminated as RNA amplification and transcription occurs in the cytoplasm. In addition, with the exception of the coronaviruses, the genomes of these viruses are small, varying in size between 7.5-14kb, which facilitates construction and manipulation of cDNA clones, but may also impose size limitations on engineered RNAs when viral packaging systems are utilized.",

The alphavirus genome consists of a single-strand RNA molecule, about 12 kb in length, which is capped at the 5' terminus and polyadenylated at the 3' terminus. The 5' two-thirds of the infecting genome RNA is translated to produce polyproteins that are processed by cotranslational and/or post-translational cleavage into four non-structural proteins [8] that are required for RNA replication and transcription. Figure 1 shows the alphavirus RNA replication and transcription strategy. A full-length neg-ative strand is synthesized, which then serves as a template for synthesis of new genomic RNA molecules. The structural proteins are encoded in the 3' onethird of the genome and are translated from a 3' coterminal subgenomic mRNA of about 4.1 kb, which is capped and polyadenylated. This subgenomic mRNA is transcribed from the negative strand at an internal site and is not itself a template for negative-strand synthesis, nor is it packaged into mature virions. Virus budding usually occurs at the cell surface and mature virions are released into the culture fluid.",

Comparison of several alphavirus nucleotide sequences [9] and more recent mutagenesis studies using Sindbis virus, have defined at least five important cis-acting RNA elements in the alphavirus genome. Elements believed to play a role in the synthesis of negative and positive strands, include the 5' terminal 44 nucleotides [10] , a conserved RNA sequence/structure of 51 nucleotides located in the nsP1 coding region [11] , and 19 nucleotides immediately adjacent to the 3' terminal poly (A) tract [12, 13] . The signal for specific encapsidation of Sindbis RNAs, as shown by in vitro and in vivo studies [14] , resides in the nsP1 coding region (between nucleotides 746-1226). Finally, a conserved sequence of 24 bases, which overlaps with the end of the non-structural coding region and the subgenomic mRNA start site (sometimes referred to as the 'junction region'), has been shown to function as the core promoter for subgenomic mRNA synthesis in the negative strand [15, 16] . Although the core promoter is sufficient for subgenomic mRNA synthesis [16] , transcription can be enhanced [17\",18] or depressed [19] by including additional flanking sequences.",

Recently, an efficient helper system has been developed for packaging SFV replicons [31\" '] that, in contrast to the ones just described, does not contain the region important for alphavirus packaging (Fig. 2b) . Packaging of the SFV replicon is achieved by efficient cotransfection of baby hamster kidney cells with both RNAs by electroporation [31\"'] . Replicase and transcriptase functions supplied by the vector RNA lead not only to its own amplification but also act in trans to allow replication and transcription of the helper RNA. This results in synthesis of SFV structural proteins that package the replicon but not the helper, with > 108 infectious particles per ml (5x 109 infectious particles per electropotation) being produced after only 24 hours. Such helper-free stocks can be used, without further phenotypic selection, to infect cells for expression studies or high level protein production. The human transferrin receptor, mouse dihydrofolate reductase, chicken lysozyme, and E. coli ~-galactosidase have been synthesized successfully using this system with expression levels ranging up to 25% of the total cell protein for ~-galactosidase [31\"'] .

For many applications, it will be important for the biology of alphavirus replication to be compatible with the functional expression of the heterologous product in a given host cell. In this regard, it should be noted that alphavirus infection of different cells types can have varied effects on host DNA replication, RNA transcription and mRNA translation [36] . Moreover, recovery of infectious particle stocks may depend on the length or structure of the particular heterologous RNA sequence or an encoded protein product. Interference with alphavirus replication, at any stage in the replication cycle, could preclude the recovery of the desired recombinant. In our experience, packaging constraints on the length of the genomic RNA appear to affect rescue and stability of double subgenomic Sindbis recombinants [1] . Preliminary experiments suggest that double subgenomic vectors with heterologous inserts positioned upstream from the structural protein open reading frame may be more stable, although these constructs produce somewhat lower expression levels (CS Hahn, A Grakoui, C Xiong, H Huang, and CM Rice, unpublished data).",

The original distinction between negative-strand and positive-strand RNA viruses [38] , relevant to design of expression systems, is that deproteinized genome RNAs of negative-strand viruses cannot initiate a complete infectious cycle after transfection. This observation is due to the negativesense polarity of their genome RNA(s), that necessitates primary transcription of mRNAs to produce the viral proteins required for subsequent steps in virus RNA replication and virion assembly.

            "text": "Details of the influenza virus life cycle relevant to its use for heterologous gene expression are summarized briefly here; a more comprehensive treatment is presented in a recent review by Krug and coworkers [43] . The influenza A virus genome consists of eight RNA segments. Each segment shares common 5' and 3' terminal sequences of 15 bases which are complementary and capable of base-pairing to form panhandle structures. The infectious influenza RNP complex consists of these genomic RNAs complexed with nucleocapsid protein and three larger replicase/transcriptase components, PA, PB1, and PB2. A diagram depicting replication and transcription of an influenza segment is shown in Fig. 3a . After entry of the virus, RNA transcription and replication occur in the host cell nucleus. Messenger RNA transcripts are initiated using 10-13base 5'-capped oligonucleotide primers derived by endonucleolytic cleavage of host RNA polymerase II transcripts. Influenza mRNAs terminate with a 3' terminal poly (A) tract derived from a short poly (U) template [44] . Transcripts therefore lack the 3' terminal conserved element found on genome-length RNAs and are transported to the cytoplasm for translation and are not packaged into nucleocapsid structures or virions. Expression of influenza A proteins from segments 7 and 8 involves synthesis of multiple spliced mRNAs suggesting that heterologous RNAs expressed using the influenza virus transcriptase may be targets for the host splicing machinery. Influenza mRNAs are preferentially translated relative to host mRNAs, resulting in a dramatic decrease in host protein synthesis in infected ceils [43] .",

In the first successful experiments, an engineered RNA segment containing the bacterial CATcoding region flanked by 22 5'-terminal and 26 3'-terminal bases was synthesized by in vitro transcription of a linearized cDNA template using T7 RNA polymerase [40] . These RNA transcripts could be reconstituted into RNPs, which were functional for influenza transcription 4n vitro. When such RNPs were used to transfect influenza-infected MDCK or MDBK cells, CAT activity was detected, indicating that the influenza helper virus was able to replicate and transcribe the engineered RNA segment. Passaging experiments demonstrated that the engineered segment also contained the c~s elements necessary for packaging. By coupling in vitro RNA transcription and RNP formation, the efficiency of this RNP transfection system has recently been improved more than 100-fold [45\" ]. ",

In theory this could be circumvented by the recovery of pure influenza transfectant stocks which would then allow expression of the heterologous gene at levels similar to those observed for influenza virus gene products. Alternative strategies will need to be employed, however, that allow either substantial increases in rescue efficiency (like in vivo transcription/RNP reconstitution) or positive selections for transfectants carrying the heterologous sequence. One possible approach, similar to that used for poliovirus and Sindbis virus, would be to incorporate heterologous segments into non-essential regions of essential influenza gene products, such as the influenza hemagglutinin or neuraminidase. A more generally useful strategy may be to utilize engineered gene segments that are dicistronic, expressing both an essential influenza gene or a dominant selectable marker in addition to the heterologous sequence. As discussed for the alphaviruses, RNA sequences allowing internal translation initiation might allow efficient expression of two polypeptides from a single mRNA transcript. Although the packaging capacity of influenza virions has not been established, a recent study has shown that transfectants with at least nine segments can be recovered, albeit with lower efficiency [48\"], suggesting that it may be possible to engineer stable transfectants expressing additional gene products.",

Future expression systems may include not only the ability to regulate RNA synthesis, but also cis RNA regulatory elements which will enable conditional control of translational efficiency and modulation of mRNA stability [49] . An exciting prospect is the possibility of engineered packaging systems that allow encapsidation of RNA free of size constraints and delivery of replication competent recombinant RNAs to specific cell types. One could envisage the use of either defined packaging signals and their cognate viral proteins, or designs based on other protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions. In any case, it is likely that both current and future RNA-based expression systems will prove to be valuable for transient expression of proteins and peptides, as well as antisense RNAs, RNA decoys [50], and ribozymes.

The two RNAs shown below are packaging helpers which supply the alphavirus structural proteins after cotransfection with a replicon producing a functional replicase/transcriptase. The first helper construct contains the cis-acting signals necessary for replication and transcription, as well as a packaging signal. This results in the production of infectious virus stocks with a bipartite genome structure. The second helper does not contain the packaging signal, allowing the production of helper-free virus stocks of the packaged expression replicon.

See the text for further discussion of the influenza replication strategy. (b) Methodology for recovery of influenza A virus transfectants. A plasmid construct is made which contains the T7 RNA polymerase promoter upstream from cDNA corresponding to the 5' and 3' terminal sequences of the influenza negative-sense virion RNA, denoted as in (a). The cDNA encoding the heterologous sequence or foreign gene (darkly shaded box) is positioned between these cis elements in the antisense orientation with respect to the virion RNA transcript. Open triangles and solid diamonds indicate initiation and termination codons, respectively. Run-off RNA transcripts are produced by T7 RNA polymerase after digestion of template DNA at a unique restriction enzyme cleavage site (indicated by an arrow) which immediately follows the 3' terminus of the virion negative-sense cDNA. Infectious ribonucleoprotein particles (RNPs) are reconstituted from in vitro transcribed RNAs and nucleocapsid components are purified either using a two-step procedure[40,41] or a more efficient method where transcription and RNP assembly are coupled[45\"]. Reconstituted RNPs are then used to transfect appropriate host cells which have been previously infected with helper influenza virus. This procedure allows replication, expression and packaging of some engineered segments. From[1].influenza strains (called 'transfectants')[45\"] with impaired replication and an attenuated phenotype[46\"]   or carrying epitopes from different influenza subtypes [47\"'], have already been reported. CAT remains the only reported example of heterologous gene expression by influenza, and from the published literature it is difficult to determine the actual expression levels on a per-cell basis.",
