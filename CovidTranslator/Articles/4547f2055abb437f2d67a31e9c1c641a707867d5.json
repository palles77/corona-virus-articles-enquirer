Previous methods for retrospective analysis of epidemics, in which alternative interventions are compared, do not make full use of the information; by using only partial information on the historical trajectory, augmentation of control may lead to predictions of a paradoxical increase in disease. Here we introduce a novel statistical approach that takes full account of the available information in constructing the effect of alternative intervention strategies in historic epidemics. The key to the method lies in identifying a suitable mapping between the historic and notional outbreaks, under alternative control strategies. We do this by using the Sellke construction as a latent process linking epidemics. We illustrate the application of the method with two examples. First, using temporal data for the common human cold, we show the improvement under the new method in the precision of predictions for different control strategies. Second, we show the generality of the method for retrospective analysis of epidemics by applying it to a spatially extended arboreal epidemic in which we demonstrate the relative effectiveness of host culling strategies that differ in frequency and spatial extent. Some of the inferential and philosophical issues that arise are discussed along with the scope of potential application of the new method.",

The time scale in which a decision must be taken and the paucity of information on key epidemiological parameters early in the epidemic make the choice of intervention or control difficult (Ferguson et al. 2001a,b) . The decision is often controversial (Cunningham et al. 2002; Kitching et al. 2006; Wingfield et al. 2006) , particularly so if the control strategy effected involves pro-active culling of non-symptomatic animals or crops or, for human diseases, travel restrictions. Following the cessation of the outbreak, one question that naturally arises is: was the right choice of control made? To answer this, we need to determine what would have occurred had an alternative, mooted choice of control been implemented. Moreover, we need to do this while taking account of uncertainty in both the parameters governing the process and the underlying, partially observed trajectory of the outbreak (definitions of terminology used in the paper are provided in table 1).",

Was the best choice made given what was known at the time of the decision? Was the best choice made in the light of what is known now? We call these prospective and retrospective questions of the appropriateness of the choice of control, respectively. The prospective situation is the common one that confronts epidemiologists and decision makers in an emerging epidemic. Since there is little information to inform choices made at an early stage, though, the prospective question amounts merely to querying the professional competence of the person or persons who made the decision.",

It is the retrospective question, too, that interests those who have been personally affected by an intervention.

            "text": "In assessing the retrospective question, it is imperative that full use is made of the information provided by the historic epidemic, of which there are two types: parametric, i.e. information about the process, and trajectory based, i.e. information encapsulated in the epidemic's trajectory (figure 1 for schematic). Until now, however, it has seemed to many researchers that studying populations of outcomes independent from reality is the only way to address notional controls. This semi-retrospective approach was taken by Riley et al. (2003) for the SARS epidemic of 2003 and by Keeling et al. (2001) for the foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) outbreak in the UK in 2001. Riley et al. (2003) noted the difficulty in interpreting the results, describing the notional epidemics of SARS generated with parameters estimated from Hong Kong cases as representing cities with 'Hong Kong-like characteristics' rather than Hong Kong per se. One of the authors of the foot-and-mouth paper later pointed out a paradox of the approach, namely that implementing control measures more swiftly than happened in reality leaves 'a significant probability of a worse outcome than was actually observed' (Woolhouse 2003) . The cause of this paradox is illustrated by analogy to the following example. Suppose that one mooted intervention during the 2001 FMD epidemic in Great Britain (Ferguson et al. 2001a,b) , in addition to the controls implemented in reality, was to vaccinate all livestock on the Isle of Man (itself unaffected by the epidemic despite its proximity to the heavily affected areas of Dumfries, Galloway and Cumbria). It is reasonable to believe that there would be no effect of this alternative intervention strategy on the actual outbreak. This should be reflected in predictions that the notional epidemic be the same as the actual one. Ignoring the information content of the observed trajectory of the epidemic, however, leads to a distribution of possible outcomes following the spurious vaccination, some of which have greater and some less disease than the true outbreak, and which is not necessarily centred on the actual outcome. This paradox and the awkwardness of interpretation can be rectified by incorporating trajectory-based information in analyses to compare alternative control strategies. an intervention strategy is any action that may change the way an epidemic invades a population. Non-intervention is also considered to be an intervention strategy the actual or historic epidemic is the one that did occur in a given place and time under the actual or historic intervention strategy a mooted or alternative intervention strategy is one that may differ from the actual intervention strategy (it may also be the same) a notional epidemic is one that did not occur but might have occurred had a mooted intervention strategy been effected rather than the actual one parametric information encapsulates the uncertainty in the parameters of a model. A single vector of parameter values is capable of generating multiple epidemic trajectories or realizations (though not all are equally likely), of which only one occurs in one temporal and spatial locality trajectory information encapsulates the uncertainty in a single epidemic trajectory. A single trajectory could have been generated by multiple parameter values, though again not all are equally likely. Note that this information does not have to provide a complete representation of the outbreak a prospective analysis of the effect of a mooted intervention strategy uses current parametric and trajectory-based information to determine what the possible future effects would be, and often is undertaken while the outbreak is at an early stage a retrospective analysis of the effect of a mooted intervention strategy uses current parametric and trajectory-based information to determine what the possible past effects would have been, and might be carried out once the outbreak has ceased a semi-retrospective analysis of the effect of a mooted intervention strategy uses up-to-date parametric information and partial trajectory information to determine what the possible past effects would have been in an ensemble of realizations of alternative realities, which have trajectories that, once the first change in the intervention occurs, are independent of the historic trajectory. Such an analysis also might be carried out once the outbreak has ceased infection actual epidemic (X) notional epidemic (X\u2032) time mooted actual actual control: mooted control:",

This involves constructing an epidemic tree to summarize the course of infection by linking each infected farm to the donor that infected it. Contact tracing was used to identify some links, while other links were unknown and were constructed using ad hoc data-driven rules, such as the nearest potential donor, or a randomly selected farm from the set of potential donors weighted by a function of distance to the recipient. The notional effect of mooted interventions, such as swifter implementation of the national movement ban, could then be considered by removing branches of the tree. The approach enabled Haydon et al. (2003) to obtain estimates of disease levels under mooted interventions. Haydon et al. (2003) recognized these to be underestimates, reflecting an inherent bias in their methods, which allows only a single incoming branch to any recipient, so that when a mooted intervention results in the removal of a branch, the notionally non-infected host unit is considered safe from further infection, regardless of the infective pressure exerted upon it by other farms. Note that although the approach of Haydon et al. (2003) does eliminate the paradox of potential increase in disease levels under greater control, this is partly due to the inherent restriction that branches are capable of being removed but not of being inserted.",

(2003) by introducing and testing a novel framework for evaluating mooted interventions on historic outbreaks. The new method makes full use of all information available in a statistically coherent fashion that overcomes the bias of previous work and is applicable to a very broad class of models. The framework treats mooted interventions consistently regardless of whether the difference between them and the actual intervention be slight or major. Section 2 introduces the background for the approach and the way it differs from the standard method for prospective analysis. We follow this by introducing the methodology that allows historic and notional epidemics to be coupled. This is done by matching the latent processes generating epidemics that differ only through the effect of the intervention strategies used. The new methodology is illustrated with two examples-one simple, the other more complex-based on historic data: the general SIR model applied to common cold data and a spatio-temporal SI model applied to data on a spatially extended arboreal disease. In the latter, interventions take the form of physical removal of symptomatic and, possibly, also asymptomatic hosts. In the concluding discussion, we compare the approach with previous attempts and discuss some of the inferential issues that arise.",

The model has infection as in equation (3.5), i.e. infection occurs at rate b per S-I pair in the absence of intervention. The control strategies whose effectiveness we wish to investigate take the form of reductions to b 3 days after the first removal, perhaps due to warnings issued by the island's physician to reduce contact with other islanders. Letting bx be the rate after 3 days, the two strategies we consider are r 1 : xZ0.5 and r 2 : xZ0.9. Infected individuals recover, leaving I (t) and entering the set of removed individuals, R(t), at rate g. The data are fR\u00f0t\u00deZ jR\u00f0t\u00dej : tZ 0; .; 19g, the population size of NZ262 and the fact that no subsequent infections occurred in the outbreak.

Under our fully retrospective approach, however, we would instead predict a small decrease in the numbers of infections (figure 4b).

Note that the epidemic was ultimately interrupted by a prolonged period of dry conditions; prior to that, infected trees were effectively continuously infectious. During this year, removal efforts focused on clearing a backlog from elsewhere in the state and so no trees were removed from the epidemic from the population in question. We investigate the effect of notional removal strategies in which, at intervals of D days, all trees are assessed for infection.

The more frequent the surveying and removal, the less disease would have resulted, although losses depend nonlinearly upon surveying frequency. These results seem to suggest that pro-active removal of asymptomatic trees in the vicinity of a known infective is not an effective strategy, since it is predicted to increase total losses; indeed, the broadest removal radius considered by us was predicted to result in almost all trees being removed. We consider this ostensible inefficacy to be an artefact of analysing a non-isolated population. The study area considered here forms part of a greater population of citrus statewide (Gottwald et al. 2002) and pro-actively culling trees only in some areas allows disease to be reintroduced from elsewhere. However, this and the other study areas were unusual in that disease was allowed to increase without intervention by the regulatory agencies specifically so that the epidemic could be studied to aid the development of intervention strategies. Within all other locations throughout the state intense culling of symptomatic and surrounding trees was practised. From a statewide perspective, culling is desirable, for although culling results in heavy to complete losses of tree populations locally, the practice effectively lowers e at the geographic scale.",

Our fully retrospective approach is a natural alternative that preserves patterns and pathologies in the data. It preserves patterns wholly when the mooted intervention has effects identical to the actual one, and partly and decreasingly so when the mooted intervention changes more and more from the actual one.

This is not a new issue in modelling: in making any predictions based on a model, we implicitly trust that the model provides a reasonable description of reality and may be extrapolated to future or alternative conditions. Indeed, non-verifiability of cause and effect is an old philosophical issue dating back to Hume. The theory of causal inference (e.g. Rubin 1974 Rubin , 2007 Holland 1986; Cox 1992; Greenland & Brumback 2002) has been developed to overcome (at least partially) this obstacle and is frequently used in medicine, the social sciences and econometrics when randomization of sampling units is not possible. Most of the causal inference literature focuses on scenarios in which treatments are applied to a sample of units that respond independently. Clearly this is inappropriate for contagious infections since the infectious status of individuals in the population are not independent (Halloran & Struchiner 1995) . Our approach differs in that we are interested in the effect of 'treatment' on a population rather than an individual, and only one 'treated' population is observed. We therefore tackled the problem by using the Sellke construction to decompose the epidemic into simpler components and then again to reconstruct the notional outbreak under a mooted intervention. As in causal inference (see Cox 1992 ) the assumptions we make can be justified from first principles but cannot be independently tested.",

            "text": "The scope of potential applications is broad. Vital questions about the effectiveness of varying the timing and intensity of control may be evaluated in diseases of humans (e.g. SARS (Riley et al. 2003; Wallinga & Teunis 2004) , Spanish influenza (Chowell et al. 2006a,b) and Ebola (Lekone & Finkenst\u00e4dt 2006) ) and other animals (e.g. FMD) as well as plants. We note, in particular, that a very nice aspect of the approach of Haydon et al. (2003) -their incorporation of known infectious contacts-could easily and consistently be incorporated within our framework also. By using an appropriate latent process such as the Sellke, our method also allows assessments to be made of the risk of inaction following outbreaks in which control measures were actually deployed. The method described in this . Colours distinguish three notional control strategies: r 0 1 : sample the population every 60 days and remove all infected trees (corresponding to (b)); r 0 2 : sample every 120 days and remove all infected trees (c); and r 0 3 : sample every 120 days but only detect and remove infection with probability 40% (d ). The three lower panels show maps of the areas, with coloured symbols indicating the posterior mean probability that the corresponding tree would have been infected by time 360 had the intervention taken place (legend in top panel). Table 2 . Posterior effect of various intervention strategies on the number of trees infected or removed during a period of 360 days. (The removal efficacy is labelled q, the removal frequency D and the radius of removal r (38.1 mZ125 ft being the original radius around detected infections used to determine asymptomatic trees for removal elsewhere in the state, later extended to 579 mZ1900 ft): if no entry is present in the r column this indicates only the tree with infection detected is removed. The mean ratio of notional to actual losses as well as 95% credible bounds are tabulated.) Alternative intervention strategies A. R. Cook et al. 1211 paper allows such important issues to be tackled taking full account of all available sources of information.",

(a) Retrospective: Poisson and (b) retrospective: Sellke. Also shown is the joint distribution taking realizations under the two interventions to be independent after times tZ0 and 3, corresponding to what we termed the semi-retrospective approach. (c) Semi-retrospective: fully independent and (d ) semiretrospective: independent post intervention. Marginal distributions are shown in the margins of the plots. These have the same distribution regardless of the method used to generate them.",

Predictions take the form of credible regions.",
