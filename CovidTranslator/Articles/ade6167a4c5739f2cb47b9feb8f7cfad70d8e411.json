To facilitate the genetic manipulation of the viral genome, genes were separated by duplication of transcription regulating sequences (TRSs) and introduction of unique restriction endonuclease sites at the 5\u0408 end of each gene using an infectious cDNA clone. The recombinant TGEV (rTGEV) replicated in cell culture with similar efficiency to the wild-type virus and stably maintained the modifications introduced into the genome. In contrast, the rTGEV replication level in the lungs and gut of infected piglets and virulence were significantly reduced. rTGEV in which gene 7 expression was abrogated (rTGEV-\u232c7) were recovered from cDNA constructs, indicating that TGEV gene 7 was a nonessential gene for virus replication. Interestingly, in vivo infections with rTGEV-\u232c7 showed an additional reduction in virus replication in the lung and gut, and in virulence, indicating that TGEV gene 7 influences virus pathogenesis.",

TGEV replicates in both the villous epithelial cells of the small intestine and the lung cells of newborn piglets, resulting in a mortality of nearly 100% (Saif and Wesley, 1992) . The TGEV genome contains a leader sequence at the 5\u0408 end and a poly(A) tail at the 3\u0408 end. Genes are arranged in the order 5\u0408-Rep-S-3a-3b-E-M-N-7-3\u0408 (Enjuanes et al., 2000b; Penzes et al., 2001) . The 3\u0408 end of the majority of TGEV genes overlaps with the 5\u0408 terminus of the next gene (Enjuanes et al., 2000b) , complicating insertion of heterologous genes into the viral genome and deletion of different genes to determine whether they are essential.",

We used a genomic TGEV cDNA clone assembled as a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) (Almaz\u00e1n et al., 2000; Gonz\u00e1lez et al., 2002) to separate the overlapping genes by duplicating sequences at the 5\u0408 flank of each gene and by introducing unique restriction endonuclease sites between each gene pair. Gene separation allowed the deletion of gene 7, showing that it is nonessential for virus replication. Furthermore, we show that the accumulation of modifications in gene domains where the TRSs are located and insertion of restriction sites led to the generation of a collection of recombinant TGEVs (rTGEVs) with variable virulence, including a highly attenuated recombinant. These viruses could be the basis for coronavirus vector development.",

After the fourth passage, viruses were cloned by three plaque-isolation steps, and their genomes were partially sequenced.

Nevertheless, in coronavirus we have generated viable and stable rTGEV viruses in which genes have been separated by the insertion of unique restriction endonuclease sites and modification of the domains where the transcription-regulating sequences (TRSs) map. Maximum titers of mutant rTGEV viruses in cell culture were similar to those obtained for the parental virus, indicating that changes in the sequences between TGEV genes had little effect on viral yield. In contrast, in vivo assays showed lower TGEV mutant virus replication in the lungs and gut, and attenuation of virulence in viruses in which a TRS duplication was introduced between genes. In arteriviruses, mutants that had the overlap between ORFs 4 and 5, or between ORFs 5 and 6 removed, were also viable (de Vries et al., 2000) . Taken together, these data demonstrate that gene overlapping is not an obligatory requirement for Nidovirales viability. Viral attenuation resulting from gene separation was possibly due to modification of the TRSs affecting mRNA transcription levels. In the case of nonsegmented negativestrand RNA viruses it has also been shown that sequence alterations, such as restriction endonuclease site or heterologous gene insertion, and gene rearrangement may affect virus replication (Wertz et al., 2002) .",
