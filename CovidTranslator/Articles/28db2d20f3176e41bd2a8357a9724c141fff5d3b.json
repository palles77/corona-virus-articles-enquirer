A cross-sectional, computer-assisted telephone interview was conducted between July 11 and September 12, 2009. A total of 1,050 respondents were interviewed. Fear about the pandemic was high, with 73.2% of respondents reporting themselves as Slightly fearful/Fearful. High risk avoidance and health protective behavior were reported, with 78.0 and 99.0% reporting at least one avoidance and protective behavior respectively. Knowledge was a significant predictor for practice of healthprotective behavior across the three ethnic groups. Level of fear was significantly correlated with number of protective and avoidance behaviors. The study highlights the need for provision of accurate information that increases risk avoidance and health protective behaviors, while at the same time decreases fear or panic in the general public.",

Numerous psychobehavioral studies and investigation of psychosocial impact of infectious disease outbreaks such as SARS and avian influenza have been carried out. Panic and distress were prevalent in the event of human avian influenza outbreak (Lau et al. 2007a) . It was found that the psychosocial impact of SARS outbreak was positively associated with public protective behaviors against infection (Seto et al. 2003; Leung et al. 2005) . It has also been reported that compliance with precautionary behaviors among the population at risk is important for prevention of further disease spread, and to promote psychological preparedness for future outbreaks (Brug et al. 2009 ). Additionally, preparedness for a pandemic requires the understanding and monitoring of disease-related perceptions and psychological responses in the general public (Lau et al. 2007a) .",

The survey commenced on July 11, 2009, a month after WHO increased the pandemic level to phase 6. On July 23, 2009, the nation's first case of death from the influenza A(H1N1) was reported. There was a sharp increase of number of deaths in the entire month of August (Ministry of Health Malaysia Press Release 2009). The study was conducted when the pandemic was very active and spreading in the community, and most importantly, it was carried out over a period of escalating reported deaths. The findings on knowledge and attitudes have been documented (Wong and Sam, submitted) . In this paper, we explored the findings of four behavioral and psychosocial aspects of influenza A(H1N1): fear of the A(H1N1) pandemic, risk avoidance behavior, health-protective behavior, and psychosocial impact. The purpose of this investigation was to explore factors predicting risk avoidance, health-protective behavior and psychosocial impact of the newly emerging pandemic across various ethnic and socio-demographic groups, which may help in future pandemic preparedness planning. The study also describes the behavioral responses to the pandemic in the context of established health behavioral models.",

            "text": "This survey was carried out during a period of escalating reported deaths in July-August 2009, when media coverage and public concern were particularly intense. The fear about the pandemic was high, with 73.2% of respondents Slightly fearful/Fearful of the pandemic. Although the level of knowledge was slightly higher in those who were Slightly/Not at all fearful, knowledge was not a significant predictor of level of fear among our study respondents. Our results clearly show that risk avoidance among our study respondents were high, with 78.0% reporting at least one avoidance behavior, and 50.6% reported at least three risk avoidance behavior changes. Females, those with higher education, the employed, and those living in urban areas reported higher number of risk avoidances. This suggests that risk perception and adherence to protective measures could be lower among males, those with less education, the non-employed and those living in rural areas. Those who perceive a low risk of contact with infected persons may believe that they are personally unaffected by the pandemic. Likewise, health protective behavior changes was also high among the study respondents, with 99.0% reporting at least one protective behavior, and 64.9% reporting at least three health protective behavior changes. Only 28.7% reported ever using face masks to protect against A(H1NI) infection. Multivariate analyses indicated that knowledge predicts the practice of health-protective behavior across the three ethnic groups. The results are in accord with Leventhal's CSM, where beliefs and knowing about the causes of illness, and personal control over the illness progression play a role in individual's strategies to control the illness (Leventhal et al. 2003) . This suggests that provision of education and clear information is essential to enhance health-protective behaviors (Wray et al. 2008; Goodwin et al. 2009; Lau et al. 2009 ). There were some notable differences across ethnic and other sociodemographic groups with respect to perception of fear, risk avoidance, health-protective behaviors and impact of A(H1N1). Moreover, there were also notable ethnic differences in association between behavioral responses. Therefore, in the provision of behavioral and prevention information to the public, ethnic differences in perceptions and behavioral responses should be considered. Previous studies have also shown marked sociodemographic disparities in risk perception of disease outbreaks and its associations with health outcomes, disease incidence and mortality (Lau et al. 2006; Lauet al. 2007b; Raude and Setbon 2009) . The findings suggest further indepth qualitative exploration on cultural values and beliefs related to each ethnic group and national studies with a larger number of respondents. According to Leventhal's CSM, anxiety or fear induced by the illness can motivate individual to engage in health care activities (Diefenbach and Leventhal 1996) . Our study also supports this hypothesis, where a high level of fear was associated with higher number of health-protective and avoidance behaviors. This suggests that information communication should attempt to evoke a sense of fear or perceived susceptibility so that a person will adopt recommended health-protective behaviors. Moderate fear has been shown as very effective in motivating changes in behavior. Janis' fear-as acquired drive model proposed that the behavioral response to fear would depend on its intensity-that low levels of fear would lead to inaction, moderate levels would produce self-protective behavior, and high levels would result in counterproductive defensive responses (Janis 1967) . Additionally, it should be noted that excessive avoidance behavior may negatively impact on physical and social functioning, and may have considerable economic consequences. Appropriate healthprotective behaviors, therefore, may be more likely when fear is at a moderate level. As such a moderate amount of fear along with the provision of accurate information and a realistic view of associated risks is warranted to encourage people to take precautions.",

The low Cronbach's alpha scores of\\0.7 achieved for the knowledge and health protective behavior items may affect the reliability of the scores (Pallant 2007) . This may be due to limited number of items used in the scales. Despite the low alpha values, the scales measure important elements of knowledge and behavior related to A(H1N1). According to Moss et al. (1998) , a low alpha value does not necessarily mean that the scale will not work well as measurement or screening tool, where the aim is to indicate the possible presence of a disorder, not to give a specific diagnosis. Another limitation is that the study only included households with fixedline telephones, therefore, those with a mobile telephone only and household without fixed-line telephone (which are more likely to be from socio-economically disadvantaged groups) were under-represented (Boland et al. 2006 ). Additionally, the study was conducted in one state and one federal territory, respectively, out of a total of 13 states and three federal territories in the country. As such, the sample may not be representative of the whole country. Finally, all information obtained from the interview was self-reported and reporting bias due to socially desirable attitudes and behaviors might exist. Further, attitudes do not necessarily predict actual behaviors (Ajzen and Fishbein 1980) . Despite these methodological caveats, the study has the advantages of a high response rate of 60.0%, was carried out during the peak of the A(H1N1) pandemic, and was performed on a wide spectrum of sociodemographic groups.",
