            "text": "In the present study, the regulatory effect of cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractant (CINC) and epithelial neutrophil-activating peptide 78 (ENA-78) on pulmonary neutrophil (PMN) accumulation in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) mice, and the therapeutic effect of pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC), was investigated. BALB/c mice were divided into control, LPS and PDTC + LPS groups using a random number table. The phosphorylation of nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) was detected using a western blot, and the mRNA expression levels of CINC were evaluated using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The expression of NF-\u03baB, CINC and ENA-78 was detected using immunohistochemistry. The production of interleukin (IL)-8 and IL-10 in serum and broncho-alveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was analyzed using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The total number of leukocytes and proportion of PMNs in BALF was also determined. Following injection with LPS (20 mg/kg), the expression levels of p-NF-\u03baB, CINC and ENA-78 were increased in lung tissue, and the expression levels of IL-8, IL-10 and the number of PMNs increased in serum and BALF. However, in comparison with the LPS group, the degree of lung injury was reduced in ARDS mice that were treated with PDTC. In addition, the expression level of p-NF-\u03baB and the production of chemokines in lung tissue decreased in ARDS mice that were treated with PDTC, and the number of PMNs in BALF also decreased. In conclusion, the results of the present study suggest that the LPS-induced phosphorylation of NF-\u03baB may result in the synthesis and release of CINC and ENA-78, which induce the accumulation of PMNs in the lung. Therefore, PDTC may be used to reduce the production of chemokines and cytokines, thereby decreasing the activation of PMNs in lung tissue and reducing the damage of lung tissue in ARDS.",

            "text": "The main sites of cell injury in ARDS are the vascular endothelium and alveolar epithelium (4) . Polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) contribute towards lung inflammation and serve important roles in the pathogenesis and progression of ARDS (3) . Lung injures may result in the infiltration and activation of PMNs, involving a complex process including the recruitment, adhesion and chemotaxis of PMNs (3, 4) . Bhatia and Moochhala (5) have demonstrated that a large number of PMNs can accumulate in lung tissue and release inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-8, IL-10 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1), Regulatory effect of cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractant, epithelial neutrophil-activating peptide 78 and pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate on pulmonary neutrophil aggregation mediated by nuclear factor-\u03baB in lipopolysaccharide-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome mice which serve important roles in activating and maintaining the inflammatory response (6) . IL-8 and the epithelial neutrophil activating peptide (ENA-78) are critical for the accumulation of PMNs in lung tissue (7) ; the expression of adhesion molecules on the surface of PMNs increases with appearance of these chemokines (5) . Adhesion molecules and their ligands provide a strong adhesion between PMNs and endothelial cells, allowing PMNs to migrate to the vessel wall (8, 9) . Cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractant (CINC), a member of the IL-8 family, is a specific PMN chemokine that serves a crucial function in the aggregation of PMNs in lung tissue (10, 11) . Nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) is a critical nuclear transcription factor, able to activate the transcription of a number of inflammatory cytokine genes and regulate the inflammatory response and immunoreaction (12) . Typically, NF-\u03baB exists as an inactive dimer in the cytoplasm and directly combines with an inhibitor of nuclear-factor \u03baB (I\u03baB) to produce a trimeric complex (13) . The P50/P65 heterodimer serves an important physiological function during inflammation, and NF-\u03baB P65 is the principal subunit (14) .",

In addition, PDTC reduces the expression of chemokines, such as CINC and ENA-78, and the accumulation of inflammatory cells in lung tissue in order to alleviate the pathological changes in the lung tissue of ARDS (11, 19) . It is therefore important to reduce the expression of CINC and ENA-78, and the accumulation of PMNs in lung tissue, by regulating NF-\u03baB phosphorylation and hindering NF-\u03baB activation. The present study aimed to investigate the regulatory effect of CINC and ENA-78 on PMN aggregation mediated by NF-\u03baB, and the direct protective effects of PDTC on lung tissue in LPS-induced ARDS mice.",

The association between NF-\u03baB, cytokines and chemokines has become a topic of interest with regards to the pathogenesis of ARDS (12) . The expression of inflammatory mediators can be downregulated by delaying the activation of the NF-\u03baB signal pathway, thereby suppressing PMN accumulation in the lungs, effectively repressing the excessive activation of the inflammatory response and reducing the damage inflicted on lung tissue (23) . A previous study observed that the activation of NF-\u03baB in ARDS could increase the production of inflammatory cytokines, including adhesion molecules (such as CD11b/CD18, ICAM-1), chemokines (such as IL-8), TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2, involving a number of downstream gene transcriptions (5) . NF-\u03baB was demonstrated to be a central transcription factor that promotes the production of cytokines, adhesion molecules and chemokines by specifically binding to \u03baB promoters in the nucleus (24, 25) . The P50/P65 NF-\u03baB heterodimer serves a primary physiological function during inflammation (12, 13) . As the principal subunit, NF-\u03baB P65 exists in an inactive dimer form in the cytoplasm and directly combines with the inhibitory protein I\u03baB to form a trimeric complex (26, 27) . Previous studies have demonstrated that when NF-\u03baB is excessively activated, IL-8 and TNF-\u03b1 are overexpressed, whereas the expression of IL-10 is decreased, in ARDS (20) . An imbalance of the inflammatory response is the principal feature in ARDS (28, 29) . Therefore, inhibiting the activation of the NF-\u03baB signal pathway and reducing the expression of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines may inhibit the inflammatory response at the source, leading to novel strategies in treating ARDS.",

In patients with ARDS, the body can prevent excessive activation of the inflammatory response by activating an anti-inflammatory response and releasing anti-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-10, in order to attenuate the extent of tissue damage (31) . IL-10 is a crucial anti-inflammatory cytokine in the immune response and can inhibit the production of IL-8 and TNF-\u03b1 in monocytes and macrophages, and repair injured tissue by regulating the immune response; however, overexpression can aggravate the immune response (17, 32) . Previous studies demonstrated that the genes of cytokines such as IL-8 and IL-10 encode the binding site for NF-\u03baB (20) , and that LPS-activated NF-\u03baB binds to these genes, resulting in their expression (5, 33) . In the present study, it was observed that the production of IL-8 was rapidly increased after 2 h in the serum and BALF of ARDS mice; however, the expression of IL-10 was not significantly increased during the first 6 h following injection of LPS. This indicates that there is an imbalance of proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory molecules during the early stage of ARDS. Although the level of IL-8 and IL-10 were increased simultaneously over time, the pro-and anti-inflammatory cytokines were imbalanced, and a large number of proinflammatory cytokines released from inflammatory cells further aggravated lung tissue damage. Thus, a cascade of inflammatory responses commenced.",

(A and B) The expression of p-NF-\u03baB was significantly increased in the LPS group (P<0.01) and significantly decreased in the PDTC + LPS group (P<0.05), demonstrating that PDTC can inhibit the activation of NF-\u03baB. (C and D) NF-\u03baB P65 protein expression was reduced in the cytoplasm of the LPS group (P<0.01); the production of P65 was significantly increased in nuclei of the LPS group in comparison with the NS group (P<0.01). (E and F) P65 expression was significantly increased in the cytoplasm (P<0.05), and significantly decreased in the nucleus, of the PDTC + LPS group in comparison with the LPS group (P<0.01).

CINC, cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractant; NS, normal saline; L, lipopolysaccharide; P, pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate; qPCR, quantitative polymerase chain reaction. PDTC, a specific inhibitor of NF-\u03baB, can reduce the release of chemokines and cytokines via the NF-\u03baB signal pathway, thereby decreasing PMN accumulation in lung tissue, lung tissue damage and improved oxygenation. These results indicate that strategies to regulate the expression of chemokines, cytokines and the NF-\u03baB signal pathway in ARDS should focus on restricting the duration of PMN infiltration and the subsequent effects at inflammatory sites in ARDS. Expression of nuclear factor (NF)-\u03baB in lung tissue determined by immunohistochemistry (stain, hematoxylin and eosin; magnification, x400). (A) In the normal saline group, the positive NF-\u03baB cells were not observed; (B) in the 2 h lipopolysaccharide (LPS) group, low expression levels of NF-\u03baB were detected; (C) in the 12 h LPS group, the appearance of NF-\u03baB positive cells was enhanced in comparison with the 2 h LPS group; and (D) in the 12 h pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate + LPS group, NF-\u03baB expression was reduced in comparison with the 12 h LPS group. Cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractant (CINC) expression in the lung tissue of mice detected by immunohistochemistry (stain, hematoxylin and eosin; magnification, x400). (A) Normal saline group, (B) 2 h lipopolysaccharide (LPS) group, (C) 12 h LPS group and (D) 12 h pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC) + LPS group. The expression of CINC was aggravatingly expressed in lung tissue of mice with LPS-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome. The number of positive cells stained with CINC in the PDTC + LPS group was markedly decreased in comparison with the 12 h LPS group. Expression of epithelial-derived neutrophil-activating protein 78 (ENA-78) in lung tissue, detected using immunohistochemstry (stain, hematoxylin and eosin; magnification, x400).
