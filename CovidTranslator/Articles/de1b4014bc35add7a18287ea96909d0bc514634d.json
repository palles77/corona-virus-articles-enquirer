            "text": "During the lifecycle of many enveloped viruses, a nucleocapsid core buds through the cell membrane to acquire an outer envelope of lipid membrane and viral glycoproteins. However, the presence of a nucleocapsid core is not required for assembly of infectious particles. To determine the role of the nucleocapsid core, we develop a coarse-grained computational model with which we investigate budding dynamics as a function of glycoprotein and nucleocapsid interactions, as well as budding in the absence of a nucleocapsid. We find that there is a transition between glycoprotein-directed budding and nucleocapsid-directed budding that occurs above a threshold strength of nucleocapsid interactions. The simulations predict that glycoprotein-directed budding leads to significantly increased size polydispersity and particle polymorphism. This polydispersity can be explained by a theoretical model accounting for the competition between bending energy of the membrane and the glycoprotein shell. The simulations also show that the geometry of a budding particle leads to a barrier to subunit diffusion, which can result in a stalled, partially budded state. We present a phase diagram for this and other morphologies of budded particles. Comparison of these structures against experiments could establish bounds on whether budding is directed by glycoprotein or nucleocapsid interactions. Although our model is motivated by alphaviruses, we discuss implications of our results for other enveloped viruses.",

Viruses and other pathogens also reshape cellular membranes during different stages of their lifecycles including entry into the host cell, formation of replication complexes, construction of assembly factories, and exit (also called ''egress'' or ''budding''). Understanding the mechanisms of viral budding and the forces that drive this process would advance our fundamental understanding of viral lifecycles, and shed light on analogous cellular processes in which membrane remodeling and vesicle formation are essential for function. In parallel, understanding fundamental determinants of budding and membrane dynamics would facilitate the design of viral nanoparticles. There is keen interest in reengineering enveloped viral nanoparticles to be used as targeted transport vehicles capable of crossing cell membranes through viral fusion (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) .",

In enveloped viruses, the internal capsid is surrounded by a host-derived lipid bilayer and viral glycoproteins (GPs) embedded in this membrane. Enveloped viruses can be subdivided into two groups based on their sequence of virion assembly and budding. For the first group (e.g., alphaviruses, hepatitis B, herpes), budding requires the assembly of a preformed nucleocapsid core (NC), which may be ordered or disordered depending on the virus. The core then binds to membrane-bound GPs and initiates budding (6) (7) (8) (9) . For the second group (e.g. influenza, type C retroviruses (HIV)), capsid assembly occurs concomitant with budding (6, 8, 10) . The advantage of one assembly mechanism over another is not obvious; particle infectivity, morphology, and stability may all influence the preferred budding process.",

            "text": "The importance of preformed capsids in alphavirus assembly is of particular interest because the presence of a capsid in the particle is not necessary for production of infectious particles. The traditional view is that alphaviruses follow the preassembled NC budding pathway (11) (12) (13) (14) , based on the observation of high concentrations of NCs in the cytoplasm (15) , and evidence that GP-GP and NC-GP interactions are required for virion formation (16, 17) . However, several studies have challenged this conclusion. In particular, Forsell et al. (18) reported successful assembly and budding of alphavirus despite mutations that inhibited NC assembly by impairing interactions between NC proteins, whereas Ruiz-Guillen et al. (19) observed budding of infectious alphavirus particles from cells that did not express the capsid gene. In both cases, infectious particles were assembled and released or budded from the cell. These observations suggest that GP interactions may be sufficient for alphavirus budding. This begs the question: Why do enveloped viruses have internal nucleocapsid cores? Is there an advantage to having an NC during budding?",

Computational studies have already provided insightful information about virus NC assembly (20) , as well as the interactions between proteins and lipid membranes (21) (22) (23) . Previous simulations on budding of nanoscale particles led to important insights but did not consider the effect of GPs (24) (25) (26) (27) (28) (29) (30) (31) , although budding directed by GP adsorption or capsid assembly have been the subject of continuum theoretical modeling (32) (33) (34) . The formation of clathrin cages during vesicle secretion, a process that bears similarities to viral budding, has also been the subject of modeling studies (35) (36) (37) (38) . Most closely related to our work are previous simulations on the assembly and budding of 12-subunit capsids, which found that membrane adsorption can lower entropic barriers to assembly (39, 40) and that membrane microdomains can facilitate assembly and budding (41) . In contrast to these earlier works, we consider the presence of a nucleocapsid, a larger shell (80 trimer subunits), and a different subunit geometry. We find that these modifications lead to qualitatively different assembly pathways and outcomes in some parameter ranges.",

Our model is motivated by the alphavirus structure and experimental observations on alphavirus budding (12, 18, 19) , but we consider our results in the broader context of enveloped viruses. To evaluate the relative roles of a preassembled NC compared to the assembly of transmembrane glycoproteins in driving budding, we perform two sets of simulations. The first focuses entirely on glycoprotein-directed budding ( Fig. 1 a) by including only the membrane and model GPs, whose geometry and interactions drive formation of an icosahedral shell with the geometry of the alphavirus envelope. This model directly applies to experiments on budding from cells in which capsid assembly was eliminated (18, 19) . The second set of simulations includes model GPs and a preassembled NC, thus allowing for NC-directed budding (Fig. 1 b) .",

The results demonstrate that the competition between the elastic energy of membrane deformations and deviations from preferred protein curvature can lead to polymorphic morphologies, and that templating by the NC can significantly decrease the resulting polydispersity. In the presence of a preassembled NC, there is a threshold strength of NC-GP interactions above which pathways transition from GP-directed to NC-directed budding. Our simulations enable visualization of the intermediates along each of these pathways. In both pathways, assembly proceeds rapidly until budding is $2/3 complete, after which negative Gaussian curvature of the membrane at the neck of the bud imposes a barrier to subunit diffusion that significantly slows subsequent assembly and budding. We discuss possible implications of this slowdown for enveloped viruses such as HIV that bud with incompletely formed capsids (42, 43) .",

Our GP trimer subunit comprises three cones, which are fused together and simulated as a rigid body. Each cone is represented by an array of six beads of increasing diameter, following the model described by Chen and Glotzer (51) . However, our cones are truncated, so that they form a shell with an empty interior, as shown in Fig. 2 . The cones experience lateral interactions, which in the absence of a membrane drive assembly into capsids containing 80 subunits, consistent with the 80 trimers in the alphavirus glycoprotein shell. Each cone consists of a linear array of six beads of increasing diameter. Two nearby cones experience repulsive interactions, mediated by a repulsive Lennard-Jones potential between all pairs of beads, with size parameter s equal to the bead diameter. In addition, each of the four inner beads experiences an attractive interaction with its counterpart (the bead with the same diameter) in the neighboring subunit, modeled by a Morse potential. The Morse potential depth \u03b5 gg determines the subunit-subunit interaction strength, which is related to the GP-GP binding affinity. The equilibrium distance of the Morse potential r e , and the Lennard-Jones diameter s for each interacting pair, is chosen to drive binding toward a preferred trimer-trimer angle. We set the preferred angle so that in bulk simulations (in the absence of membrane) the subunits predominantly assemble into aggregates with the target size, 80 subunits. In our simulations the GPs are embedded within the membrane, where they freely tilt and diffuse but cannot escape on simulation timescales.",

To model NC-directed budding, we studied the same system, but initialized with an NC placed 7 nm below the membrane (Fig. 3, bottom) . We chose this initialization because within the NC-directed hypothesis the NC assembles completely in the endoplasmic reticulum and is then transported by the secretory pathway to the budding site at the plasma membrane.

In both cases, assembly and membrane deformation proceed rapidly until the GP shell is $2/3 complete (the second time point in each row in Fig. 3 ), when the budding region is connected to the rest of the membrane by a narrow neck. Subunits within the neck experience restricted configurations due to the high negative Gaussian membrane curvature. Thus, the neck acts as a barrier that impedes subunit diffusion to the growing shell, causing the assembly rate to slow dramatically as the shell nears completion (Fig. 7) . The neck continues to narrow as additional GPs assemble until it becomes a tether connecting the bud and membrane. In this article, we do not consider endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT) or related scission-inducing proteins, and thus the bud separates from the membrane only when a large thermal fluctuation induces membrane fission leading to scission of the tether.",

We observe complete assembly and budding for \u03b5 ng > 0.9 and 1 % \u03b5 gg % 6 ( Fig. 5 , blue region), low to moderate GP-GP interactions. Compared to the GP-directed pathway, the presence of an NC allows assembly to occur at a lower \u03b5 gg as evidenced by obtaining complete shells even for \u03b5 gg as low as 0.9. These particles are usually not perfectly symmetric, containing 81-83 GP subunits. Outside of this range, several other end-products arise. For \u03b5 ng < 0.4 (Fig. 5 , pink region), the NC interactions are sufficiently weak that budding is entirely GP-directed (i.e., GP shells assemble and bud, but not around the NC). In the range 0.4 < \u03b5 ng < 0.9 (Fig. 5, brown region) , we observe an intermediate regime in which the NC promotes nucleation but fails to act as a perfect template. The GP shell initially starts assembling on the NC surface, but eventually separates from the surface to form a larger shell due to the effect of membrane rigidity (see next section). The result is an asymmetric shell that is partially attached to the NC; with a typical size of 95 subunits, it is smaller than a GP-particle but considerably larger than the intrinsic preferred shell size. These two assembly outcomes (GP shells partially attached or unattached to the NC) demonstrate that the presence of a NC does not necessarily imply NC-directed budding; there is a minimum NC-GP interaction strength required for the NC to direct the assembly and budding pathway.",

For the weakest interaction strength \u03b5 gg \u00bc 1.75, this corresponds to an increase in diameter of d/d native z 1.6, with d native the diameter of particles assembled in bulk. As \u03b5 gg increases, particles become smaller and more spherical, more closely resembling the shells that assemble in bulk simulations. We show snapshots of typical GP-shells assembled at weak and strong interactions. On the contrary, the size of GPNCparticles is nearly constant with \u03b5 gg and only slightly larger (81-83 subunits) than the preferred size in bulk simulations.",

As noted above, assembly can be divided into two stages. In the initial stage, the shell grows rapidly until $2/3 completion; then in the second stage, neck curvature significantly slows subunit association (Fig. 7) . The timescale for the second stage depends on the interaction parameters and whether an NC is present-for the small GPNC-particles assembly is completed quickly at $450t 0 , whereas in the large GP-particles with the broadest necks it may require up to 3000t 0 . In contrast, the timescale for the first stage is almost independent of interaction strengths and the NC, and depends only weakly on the membrane bending modulus.

For most interaction strengths, the simulated densities of GPs led to multiple small aggregates that failed to drive significant membrane deformation. This behavior is indicative of kinetic trapping, known to occur in assembly reactions at high concentrations or binding affinities (73, 74) . The ability of an inactive conformation to avoid this trap is consistent with simulations of bulk assembly (59, 60) , and the ability of budding to proceed in the presence of high subunit concentrations (when conformational changes are accounted for), which is consistent with the observation of high densities of GPs in the membranes of cells infected with Sindbis virus (75) .",

The presence of the core directs the morphology of the particle, which may have direct consequences on particle stability during transmission and the conformational changes that occur during particle entry into a new host cell. The number of GPs in GP-particles (containing no NC) varies by >50% over the range of interaction parameters in which we observe successful budding, in comparison to a variation of <5% for GPNC-particles (containing an NC). A simple equilibrium model accounting for the competition between the energy costs associated with membrane deformation and deviation of the GP shell from its preferred curvature was qualitatively consistent with the simulation results. The membrane bending energy favors formation of larger particles, whereas a higher bending rigidity of the GP shell favors smaller particles.

Several experimental studies have reported GP-directed budding from cells in which the NC proteins are impaired (18, 19) . In particular, Ruiz-Guillen et al. (19) recently showed that cells expressing the genome and GPs, but not the capsid protein, for Sindbis and Semliki Forest virus generate infectious viral particles that can propagate in mammalian cells. For the wild-type virus, in which the GPs assemble around the NC, they estimated a virion diameter of 60-70 nm, whereas the GP-only particles were typically 100-150 nm. This size increase corresponds to the range d/d native $ 1.5-2.15, consistent with our simulations and theoretical model, suggesting that the relatively low rigidity of the GP shell leads to the formation of large particles. However, there are two important caveats to this interpretation. First, the bending rigidity of the alphavirus GP shell has not been measured, so we cannot directly predict the increase in particle size. Second, our model assumes that the preferred curvature of the GP shell is commensurate with its size in a wild-type virion, for which there is no direct evidence. A recent study of herpes simplex virus nuclear egress complex (NEC), which consists of two viral envelope proteins, found that NEC particles budded in the absence of capsid are smaller than native viral particles (76) . In our model, this observation would require that the intrinsic spontaneous curvature radius of the NEC complex is smaller than that of the capsid, as suggested by the authors (76) .",

For weak interactions, this leads to a long-lived partially budded state. For stronger interactions budding eventually completes, but completion of the shell can be preempted by scission. Because spontaneous scission is a rare event, most viruses actively drive scission by either recruiting host cell machinery, such as the ESCRT protein complex in the case of HIV (79), or encoding their own machinery, such as the M2 protein in Influenza (80) . In alphaviruses specifically, the scission machinery has not been identified, though it is known that alphavirus budding is independent of ESCRT proteins (81) . Although in this article we do not consider the action of these scissioninducing mechanisms, our observation of a slowdown of assembly rates due to neck curvature could be relevant to HIV budding. If the association rate becomes sufficiently slow, ESCRT-directed scission will occur before assembly completes, leaving up to 40% of the shell incomplete, as is observed for immature HIV virions (42, 43) . In support of this possibility, we note that although scission is a rare event in our simulations because there is no ESCRT, it usually occurs before the final 1-3 subunits assemble, causing the budded particle to have a small hole at the scission site.",

            "text": "Virus elasticity and GP spontaneous curvature affect budding morphology Because Fig. 4 suggests that the elastic properties of the different viral components are key determinants of the assembly product, it is worth considering the validity of the model parameters. The mechanical properties of viruses have been extensively studied using AFM indentation (68, 69) and fluctuation spectrum analysis (70) . Typical estimates lie within the range k \u00bc 30-400 k B T, with considerable variation depending on the specific virus and experimental technique. A recent work by Schaap et al. (54) explicitly compared the stiffness of the capsid protein coat of influenza virus with that of a lipid membrane, by AFM indentation of similarly sized particles, with the goal of identifying the contribution of the matrix proteins to the virus stiffness. They found that matrix coats are $10 times stiffer than bare membranes, k mem /k shell $ 0.1. This value lies within the range explored in our simulations. Similarly, Kol et al. (55) investigated the effect of HIV maturation on its mechanical properties. The immature HIV particle consists of a gag polyprotein capsid surrounded by a lipid bilayer containing viral envelope proteins. During maturation, the NC and capsid portions of gag are cleaved, leaving only a thin matrix layer and the envelope proteins in contact with the bilayer. Kol et al. (55) found that this cleavage softens the particles by an order of magnitude, suggesting that interprotein contacts of the underlying capsid layer are necessary for the high rigidity of immature virions.",

            "text": "Finally, we note that the membrane elasticity properties also play a role in determining particle morphology. Depending on the virus family and host cell type, enveloped viral particles bud through different cellular membranes (the plasma membrane, the ER, the ERGIC, or the nuclear membrane), all of which have different lipid compositions and thus different bending properties. Moreover, many viruses create and/or exploit membrane microdomains with different compositions (such as lipid rafts) as preferential locations for budding (8, 82, 83) . The effect of inhomogeneous membrane elastic properties on particle morphology thus deserves further exploration. Although these ingredients can be incorporated into the model, the results described here demonstrate that the interplay among the elastic properties of membranes and viral proteins and the presence of an interior core can shape the morphology of a budding particle.",
