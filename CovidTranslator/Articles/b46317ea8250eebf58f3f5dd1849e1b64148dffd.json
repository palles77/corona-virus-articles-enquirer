However, knowledge regarding whether negative-strand RNA viruses take advantage of intracellular membranes for replication is limited. Here we show that a negative-strand RNA virus, human parainfluenza virus type 3 (HPIV3), remodels the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane to form inclusion bodies (IBs), whereby the phosphoprotein (P) of HPIV3 recruits phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase beta (PI4KB) to IBs to generate PI4P, creating a PI4P-enriched microenvironment to promote HPIV3 replication. In addition, we find that human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) also takes advantage of the ER to form IBs and that these IBs are also enriched with PI4P. The nucleoprotein of HRSV recruits PI4KB to IBs. These results suggest that paramyxoviruses also exploit the host endomembrane to form IBs and that PI4KB is recruited by viral proteins to enrich IBs with PI4P to facilitate viral replication.",

Positive-strand RNA viruses and even some DNA viruses, such as vaccinia virus, remodel intracellular membranes to form their replication organelles (ROs) (Miller and Krijnse-Locker, 2008; Salonen et al., 2005; Schwartz et al., 2004) . Different viruses rely on different organelles, and the appearance of ROs is manifold. For example, during infection, hepatitis C virus (HCV), dengue virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, and arterivirus induce positive curvature of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane, forming discrete membrane vesicles (Knoops et al., 2008 (Knoops et al., , 2012 Romero-Brey et al., 2012; Welsch et al., 2009) . Cells infected with poliovirus, coxsackie virus B3 (CVB3), and rhinovirus contain many complex and dynamic structures that originate from the cis-Golgi membrane (Belov and Sztul, 2014; Roulin et al., 2014) . Flock House virus (FHV) induces formation of spherules with negative curvature on the mitochondrial membrane (Kopek et al., 2007) . Electron microscopy of the replication structure of tomato bushy stunt virus showed that ROs were generated from the peroxisome membrane (McCartney et al., 2005) .",

PI4K contains four isoforms: PI4KA, PI4KB, PI4K2A, and PI4K2B (Roulin et al., 2014) . In general, PI4K is recruited to replication sites via its interaction with viral proteins directly or with the help of cytokines, such as GBF1/ARF1 or ACBD3 (Hsu et al., 2010; Lei et al., 2017; Sasaki et al., 2012; Xiao et al., 2017) . Then, PI4K yields phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate (PI4P) on ROs to bind and induce conformational changes in the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) to modulate RdRp activity (Hsu et al., 2010) . Moreover, PI4P locally changes the RO membrane curvature during viral infection to generate a high-curvature membrane pocket to shield viral components from host defense (Belov and van Kuppeveld, 2012; Miller and Krijnse-Locker, 2008 ). In addition, PI4P is exchanged with cholesterol to maintain essential membrane properties that determine the shape and function of ROs (Roulin et al., 2014) . However, whether PI4K is required for negative-strand RNA viral replication has not been explored, possibly because the existence of ROs in negative-strand RNA viruses has not been confirmed.",

Recent studies of double-strand RNA viruses (e.g., wheat yellow mosaic virus and reovirus) showed that these viruses take advantage of the ER membrane to form IBs, and IBs are thought to derive from the ER (Fern\u00e1 ndez de Castro et al., 2014; Sun et al., 2014) . In addition, a few reports have suggested that negative-strand RNA viruses may also remodel the endomembrane to form IBs. For example, ribosomes have been found close to Ebola virus IBs, suggesting that IBs of Ebola virus may form near rough ER, although the ER structure was not clearly detected (Nelson et al., 2016) . Negri body-like structures (NBLs) are sites of rabies for 24 h to form IBs and analyzed for colocalization of the Golgi protein TGN46 (A), the mitochondrial protein Tom20 (B), the ER protein Calnexin (C), the ER protein PDI (D), and IBs. The fluorescence intensity profile of IBs (green) and organelle proteins (red) was measured along the line drawn on a 23 zoom panel by Leica Application Suite Advanced Fluorescence Lite. (E and F) HeLa cells stably expressing GFP-tagged P were infected with HPIV3 (MOI = 0.1) for consecutive times (0 h, 12 h, 24 h, 30 h, and 36 h) and analyzed for distribution of the ER proteins Calnexin (E) and PDI (F). Yellow arrows indicate representative colocalization of ER proteins and IBs.",

We found that Calnexin and PDI still formed aggregates but that the distribution of TGN46 and Tom20 remained unchanged (Figures S1C-S1F). Next we sought to determine how ER marker proteins are recruited to IBs, and we were not able to show interaction of either N or P with Calnexin or PDI (Figures S1G-S1J), suggesting that the distribution changes and colocalization of Calnexin or PDI with IBs were not achieved through their interaction with N or P. To determine whether HPIV3 infection induces ER marker proteins to form aggregates, we infected HeLa cells stably expressing GFP-tagged P with HPIV3 (MOI = 0.1) for up to 36 h and analyzed the distribution of Calnexin and PDI at different time points post-infection (p.i.). As infection progressed, small IBs were observed at the early stage of infection (24 h p.i.) and gradually became larger at 30 h and 36 h p.i. At the same time, the aggregates of Calnexin and PDI also gradually became larger and colocalized with IBs ( Figures 1E and 1F ).

Through Airyscan super-resolution microscopy, we found that Calnexin colocalized with IBs, and surface projections of three-dimensional reconstructions showed that ER membrane fragments existed near IBs ( Figure 2B ), which suggests that IBs were surrounded by a fragmented ER membrane. To confirm whether IBs contained membrane structures derived from the ER, HeLa cells were treated with a hypotonic solution and lysed with a Dounce homogenizer. The homogenate was left untreated or treated with Triton X-100, trypsin, or Triton X-100 plus trypsin. In the homogenate treated with trypsin, N and P were not completely digested (Figures 2C, lane 3, and 2D), but N L478A and P were completely digested (Figures 2C, lane 7, and 2D), suggesting that the fragmented ER membrane around IBs protected N and P from degradation by trypsin.",

When HeLa cells were treated with Tg for 3 h or Tu for 6 h, proteolytic cleavage of ATF6 (an ER stress-regulated transmembrane transcription factor) was induced, and XBP1s protein was expressed ( Figure S2A ), which demonstrates that Tg and Tu can induce classic ER stress. Of note, Tg and Tu had no effects on the metabolic activity of cells ( Figure S2B ). HeLa cells were transfected with plasmids encoding N-Myc and HA-P and then treated with Tu. We calculated the average number of IBs per cell and the average diameter of IBs and found that, although Calnexin and PDI were still distributed to IBs, the size of IBs in Tu-treated cells was significantly smaller and the number of IBs was lower than that in untreated cells , and a comparable result was reached when cells were treated with Tg (data not shown). HPIV3 replication was also significantly suppressed ( Figures 2H-2J ), suggesting that formation of HPIV3 IBs and HPIV3 replication rely on the ER. Of note, expression of N and P was not influenced by treatment with Tg and Tu ( Figure S2D ), which demonstrates that the inhibition of IB formation by Tg and Tu is not due to expression of N and P. In contrast, EV71 replication was not inhibited by Tg or Tu treatment (Figures S2E and S2F) , which indicates that EV71 replication site formation does not mainly rely on the ER. Furthermore, we found that the components of IBs, N and P, were enriched in purified ER (Figures 2K, lane 3, 2L, and 2M). Because of their inability to induce IB formation, N L478A and P were not enriched in purified ER (Figures 2K, lane 4, 2L, and 2M ). In addition, N and P were not enriched in purified mitochondria ( Figure S2G ).

First, we found that abundant PI4P localized on IBs in transfected and HPIV3-infected cells ( Figures 3A and 3B ). In addition, to exclude bleed-through from the green channel into the red channel, we only stained for PI4P, using the same acquisition parameters for the red channel as used for imaging of PI4P, and we found that PI4P still formed aggregates ( Figure S3 ), suggesting that HPIV3 also takes advantage of lipid synthesis pathways to replenish ROs with PI4P.",

            "text": "To confirm the relationship between PI4KB and HPIV3 replication, we employed the PI4KB-specific inhibitor PIK93 at a concentration of 2-4 mM ( Figure S5A ), which had minimal effects on the metabolic activity of cells ( Figure S5B ). When cells were treated with PIK93, PI4P generation on IBs declined significantly compared with DMSO-treated cells ( Figure 5A ). Simultaneously, HPIV3 replication was apparently decreased (Figures 5B-5D ). Of note, PIK93 did not influence the expression of PI4KB and its colocalization on IBs (Figures S5C and S5D) . Furthermore, we carried out a recovery experiment and found that HPIV3 replication was strongly inhibited when cells were treated with shRNA targeting PI4KB and was rescued by expression of wild-type PI4KB, but HPIV3 replication was not rescued by expression of a functionally inactivated mutant of PI4KB, KD-PI4KB ( Figures 5E-5G) . Correspondingly, generation of PI4P on IBs was also reduced, and expression of wild-type PI4KB, but not KD-PI4KB, restored the levels of PI4P on IBs in PI4KB knockdown cells ( Figure S5E ). Of note, KD-PI4KB was also recruited to IBs but lost the ability to generate PI4P (Figure S5F ). Next, to determine whether PI4KB or PI4P directly supports viral genome replication, an HPIV3 minigenome assay was performed with increasing amounts of FLAG-tagged PI4KB. The results showed that PI4KB increased the minigenome-encoded reporter activity in a dose-dependent manner ( Figure 5H ). In our experiment, HPIV3 minigenome-encoded reporter expression was driven by vTF7-3 (a recombinant vaccinia virus expressing T7 RNA polymerase), whereas it has been reported that the H7 protein of vaccinia virus binds PI4P, which is essential for poxvirus replication (Kolli et al., 2015) . To exclude the possibility that the increase in minigenome reporter activity was due to the effect of PI4KB on vTF7-3, a control plasmid that encodes Renilla luciferase under control of the T7 promoter was constructed. The activity of Renilla luciferase was adjusted to a level comparable with that of the minigenome firefly luciferase ( Figure 5I, lanes  1 and 3) . Then, plasmids expressing PI4KB were co-transfected (G and H) HeLa cells were transfected with N-Myc (0.5 mg) and HA-P (2 mg) for 24 h, and the ER was extracted to detect PI4KB in RER when expressing IBs (N and P) or non-IBs (N L478A and P) via WB. Representative images are shown (G). Also shown is quantitative analysis of the PI4KB content in RER when expressing IBs (N and P) or non-IBs (N L478A and P) (H). Images are representative of experiments carried out at least three times. Error bars, mean \u00b1 SD of three experiments (n = 3).

(legend continued on next page) with pGBKT7-Renilla luciferase and the minigenome assay components, respectively. We found a significant increase in the activity of minigenome-encoded firefly luciferase and almost no increase in the activity of Renilla luciferase ( Figure 5I, lanes 2  and 4) . Taken together, these results show that PI4KB facilitates HPIV3 genome replication directly by producing PI4P on IBs.",

Given that the HPIV3 proteins N and P are major components of IBs, we first determined whether N or P was involved in PI4KB recruitment, and we found that FLAG-PI4KB strongly interacted with HA-P ( Figure 6A ). Likewise, HA-P significantly interacted with FLAG-PI4KB ( Figure 6B ), and HA-P interacted with endogenous PI4KB ( Figure 6C ). These results confirm that P and PI4KB physically interact on IBs.

To confirm that P but not N was associated with PI4KB, we performed co-immunoprecipitation (coIP) in HeLa cells, and a comparable conclusion was reached ( Figures  S6A and S6B ).

Next, we sought to determine whether other paramyxoviruses, such as HRSV, use similar mechanisms to generate PI4P on IBs. First, we found that the ER marker protein Calnexin neither aggregated nor colocalized with HRSV IBs ( Figure 7A ). However, another ER marker protein, PDI, formed aggregates and colocalized with IBs ( Figure 7B ). Furthermore, PDI did not aggregate when N or P of HRSV was expressed alone ( Figure S7A ), suggesting that HRSV may also take advantage of the ER membrane to form IBs; however, the components absorbed and utilized are different from those utilized by HPIV3. Second, we found that PI4P lipids and PI4KB were also rich in HRSV IBs (Figures 7C and 7D ) and that PI4KB did not aggregate when N or P of HRSV was expressed alone ( Figure S7B ), suggesting that HRSV also recruited PI4KB to produce PI4P on IBs. Finally, we found that N, but not P, of HRSV strongly interacted with FLAG-PI4KB ( Figures 7E and  7F) . Furthermore, PI4KB interacted with P of HRSV via the N-P complex ( Figure 7G ). Taken together, these data demonstrate that HRSV also takes advantage of the ER and that PI4P lipids are enriched in IBs. The HRSV N protein recruits PI4KB to generate PI4P on IBs.",

The PI4P lipid microenvironment is an important facilitator of HPIV3 replication, and cellular PI4KB is a key player in this process ( Figure 5 ). These findings highlight the dependence on the endomembrane and PI4P among negative-strand RNA viruses and should prompt related studies to determine the mechanism by which PI4P lipids modulate viral RNA replication. Furthermore, our findings may provide a basis for the design of a class of therapeutic agents that target the negative-strand RNA viral replication platform.",

In infected cells, HPIV3 translates mRNA into N and P, and increasing amounts of N and P result in ER membrane fragmentation. ER ingredients (such as Calnexin and PDI) and N and P form IBs together. Meanwhile, ER debris is loosely distributed around IBs. Subsequently, P recruits PI4KB to IBs, where it catalyzes the production of PI4P lipids, leading to biogenesis of a PI4P-enriched microenvironment, which facilitates HPIV3 replication.",

Furthermore, we found that PI4P was enriched on the IBs of paramyxoviruses just as it was enriched in the ROs of positive-strand RNA viruses. Therefore, we concluded that both positive-and negative-strand RNA viruses can remodel the endomembrane to form ROs and that they take advantage of lipid synthesis pathways to replenish ROs with PI4P to facilitate replication. In addition, we have a deeper understanding of paramyxovirus IB organization. IBs are not only the protein aggregates but also structures composed of ER ingredients and surrounded by a fragmented ER membrane. We found that the ER marker proteins Calnexin and PDI both colocalized with HPIV3 IBs (Figures 1C and 1D) ; however, only PDI colocalized with HRSV IBs (Figures 7A and 7B) . In other words, although HPIV3 and HRSV both take advantage of the ER membrane to form IBs, different viruses absorb different components of the ER, which implies the complexity of paramyxovirus IB organization. Similarly, previous studies considered the ER membrane to be the main membrane source of HCV ROs (Romero-Brey et al., 2012; Welsch et al., 2009 ). However, a recent study showed that the Golgi and autophagosome membrane are important for HCV replication and highlighted the complexity of the cellular membrane structures of positive-strand viruses (Hansen et al., 2017) . Interestingly, the autophagy marker LC3 was also found on HPIV3 IBs (data not shown), suggesting that autophagy may also play a role in IB formation. Consistent with this, our previous results showed that HPIV3 P blocks autophagosome-lysosome fusion to increase virus production (Ding et al., 2014) . Thus, we assume that P blocks autophagosome-lysosome fusion to increase the abundance of autophagosomes, and then HPIV3 takes advantage of autophagosomes other than the ER to form IBs. Moreover, a recent report showed that HRSV IBs contain subcompartments that were termed ''IB-associated granules'' (IBAGs), and that newly synthetized viral mRNA and the viral transcription anti-terminator M2-1 concentrate in IBAGs. In contrast, viral genome RNA, N, L, and its cofactor P are excluded from IBAGs (Rincheval et al., 2017) . Whether IBAGs are separated with other space of IBs by membrane structures is worth exploring. These findings provide substantial insights into the organization of IBs, which were previously thought to be aggregates of proteins. These findings suggest that IBs are extremely complex and elaborate structures, and understanding their composition could greatly help us understand the mechanisms of viral replication.",

Our results strongly suggest that the IBs of paramyxoviruses consist of membranous ingredients and that fragmented ER membranes loosely surround the core of HPIV3 IBs. On one hand, this membrane structure protects IBs from degradation to ensure viral replication (Figures 2C and 2D) . On the other hand, many cytokines are involved in viral replication, and the gaps between incompact ER debris ensure communication between IBs and the cytosol. Most importantly, our previous results showed that HPIV3 IBs escape the antiviral effect of stress granules by concealing their own newly synthesized viral RNAs (Hu et al., 2018) . Subsequently, loose ER membranes around IBs may create a favorable environment to transport synthesized viral RNA to the cytoplasm and escape the alarm system of host cells in a sustained-release manner.",

OSBP exchanges cholesterol with PI4P on membrane contact sites between ROs and other organelles (Nchoutmboube et al., 2015; Roulin et al., 2014) , which generate and maintain essential membrane properties that drive the shape and function of ROs. However, we did not detect enriched cholesterol around IBs (data not shown), which suggests that HPIV3 replication and transcription do not rely on cholesterol. In addition, RdRp 3D pol of enterovirus preferentially binds PI4P lipids over other cellular lipid components (Hsu et al., 2010) , indicating that PI4P serves as a protein docking site on the RO membrane. Furthermore, PI4P lipid binding may also induce conformational changes and modulate RdRp enzymatic activity (Hsu et al., 2010) . The mechanism whereby PI4P facilitates HPIV3 replication is not clear.",
