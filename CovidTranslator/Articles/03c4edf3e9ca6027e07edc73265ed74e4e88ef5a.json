[6] [7] [8] Among health care practitioners, there was evidence of heightened concern as well. Transmission of the Ebola virus occurs only by direct contact with the bodily fluids of symptomatic individuals, and the typical incubation period ranges from 2 to 21 days-evidence that is the basis for guidelines issued by the CDC. 9 Yet of the 650 inquiries to the CDC about suspected Ebola cases between July and mid-November 2014, 75 % referenced individuals who had not recently traveled to a country with Ebola or been in contact with an Ebola patient. Furthermore, only 18 % were deemed potential cases based on initial signs, symptoms, and risk factors. 10 In several instances, pursuing Ebola pathways may have delayed clinicians' efforts to confirm the true diagnosis.",

The West African Ebola outbreak offers a unique opportunity to investigate how communication infrastructure and personal factors affect the ability of frontline health care providers to respond appropriately to global health crises. Our goal was to measure how the risks of Ebola were perceived and acted upon by health professionals, particularly in ambulatory care settings, where preparedness is uniquely challenging. 12 In addition, we wanted to explore the role that different information sources and regional context played in shaping provider attitudes and knowledge. To address these aims, we conducted a national survey of U.S. internists, examining self-reported preparedness among physicians and whether their potential for clinical exposure to Ebola was predictive of their management approach in hypothetical clinical scenarios.",

The third section asked respondents to rate the personal importance of information sources and their level of preparation in order to identify and manage possible cases. The fourth section measured how physicians assessed the risk of Ebola versus influenza in a series of clinical scenarios, which were written such that influenza was more likely in each case while the probability of Ebola varied. Finally, the survey posed clinical vignettes testing knowledge of appropriate management of suspected Ebola, transmission methods, and incubation period based on CDC guidelines circulating at the time of survey distribution. 9 The survey was field-tested by primary care physicians at two adult internal medicine clinics affiliated with Massachusetts General Hospital; insights from the field testers' survey responses and oral comments were incorporated into the final instrument (eSurvey).",

Almost all respondents gave the guideline-concordant answer on obtaining a travel history, but there was considerable variation in responses regarding incubation period and transmission risk. When we looked at management intensity of these responses, we found that the only significantly associated factor was the possibility of encountering Ebola: physicians who practiced outside metropolitan areas associated with Ebola cases or designated airports, or who did not report patients with recent West African travel, were more likely to endorse overly aggressive management. This may be because these physicians were less motivated to stay abreast of Ebola clinical guidelines or due to a lack of institutional or community infrastructure to support the physicians in management-although we found no association between the possibility of encountering Ebola and the presence of an institutional protocol. It is not clear whether this is a physician-or institution-level phenomenon, though there was no association with practice setting or type.",

Notably, recent contact with an asymptomatic Ebola patient, the presence of vomiting and diarrhea, and even travel to South Africa swayed many respondents toward Ebola as the more likely pathogen. Reassuringly, a Medscape survey of health professionals found that 69 % ranked influenza as a high threat to public health, while only 17 % had this view of Ebola. 16 Despite variation among respondents in Ebola guideline knowledge, we found that almost all physicians felt at least somewhat prepared to communicate the risk of acquiring Ebola and to identify possible cases-especially if they used informational sources other than the lay press or had a possibility of encountering Ebola. In addition, most reported a There were no missing data protocol in place at their practice site, though only 39 % of solo practitioners reported such a protocol, and many had personally changed their practice accordingly. These results are consistent with those of the Medscape survey, in which 63 % of health professionals reported that they were prepared to treat Ebola and 97 % reported confidence in their knowledge of Ebola. 16 Finally, while few respondents reported a fear of contracting Ebola, a greater number reported such a fear among their physician colleagues, and nearly half reported the fear among non-physician staff members-which may reflect differences in education level 17 or the effect of physicians choosing more socially desirable opinions for themselves. Overall, despite most respondents reporting that they had reviewed CDC guidelines, our results confirm a disconnect between physicians' confidence in Ebola preparedness and their knowledge of appropriate diagnosis and management. 10 . This raises important questions about how to engage doctors in providing appropriate care beyond guideline distribution-perhaps through outreach by professional groups, electronic decision support, or government-mandated training. Given the popularity of lay press sources ( Table 2) , it will also be critical to address limitations in the quality of health journalism. 18, 19 This investigation had several limitations. We achieved a 46 % response rate, suggesting the possibility of response bias, though demographic characteristics were similar between respondents and non-respondents. Physicians who self-selected to participate may have had greater knowledge about Ebola or were more comfortable with Ebola preparedness activities, so our study may overestimate physician confidence, knowledge, and preparedness. While the study population was representative of membership in the nation's largest internal medicine organization, it may not represent all U.S. internists. We do not know whether physicians would act in real life as they reported in hypothetical scenarios. This is a cross-sectional survey, so we cannot show causality. We acknowledge that the constructs used for possibility of encountering Ebola and fear were not externally validated, though they had face validity and were based on literature regarding similar epidemics.",
