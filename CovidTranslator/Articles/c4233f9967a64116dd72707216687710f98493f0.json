            "text": "Mitochondria are increasingly recognized as drivers of inflammatory responses. MAP kinase kinase 3 (MKK3), a dual-specificity protein kinase, is activated in inflammation and in turn activates p38 MAP kinase signaling. Here we show that MKK3 influences mitochondrial function and acts as a critical mediator of inflammation. MKK3 deficient (MKK3 \u2212/\u2212 ) mice and bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDMs) secreted less cytokines than wild type (WT) after LPS exposure. There was improved mitochondrial function, as measured by basal oxygen consumption rate, mitochondrial membrane potential, and ATP production, in MKK3 \u2212/\u2212 BMDMs. After LPS exposure, MKK3 \u2212/\u2212 BMDM did not show significant increase in cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production as well as mitochondrial superoxide (MitoSOX) compared to WT. Activation of two important inflammatory mediators i.e. the nuclear translocation of NF-\u03baB and caspase-1 activity (a key component of the inflammasome), were lower in MKK3 \u2212/\u2212 BMDMs. p-38 and JNK activation were lower in MKK3 \u2212/\u2212 BMDMs compared to WT after exposure to LPS. Knockdown of MKK3 by siRNA in wild type BMDMs improved mitochondrial membrane potential, reduced LPS induced caspase-1 activation and attenuated cytokine secretion. Our studies establish MKK3 as a regulator of mitochondrial function and inflammatory responses to LPS and suggest that MKK3 may be a therapeutic target in inflammatory disorders like sepsis.",

            "text": "Mitochondria are considered central hubs of inflammation [1] and new paradigm shifts show that mitochondria are capable of inducing multiple inflammatory pathways, reflecting their origins as primitive archaebacteria [2] . Mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been implicated in the activation of major inflammatory transcription factors such as NF-kB (Nuclear Factor kappa B) and AP-1 (Activator Protein -1) [3] . In addition, mitochondrial ROS, membrane potential, and the release of oxidized mitochondrial DNA activate another important inflammatory pathway, the inflammasome and caspase-1 [4] . Mitochondrial metabolism and innate immunity are intimately linked. Metabolic switching from OXPHOS (oxidative phosphorylation) to glycolytic for ATP generation likely determines the magnitude of an inflammatory response. For example, OXPHOS deficiency is associated with increased inflammatory responses in adipocytes [5] . In macrophages and dendritic cells, stimulation of the toll like receptor 4 (TLR4) by LPS inhibits mitochondrial activity and induces a change in the metabolism from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis, which is more inflammatory in nature [6, 7] . Thus it is speculated that maintenance of adequate OXPHOS metabolism will enable reduced inflammatory response to stimulants such as LPS, however the factors affecting mitochondrial function are not well known. Here we investigate the role of MKK3 in regulation of inflammation through the modulation of mitochondrial function.",

MKK3 (MAP Kinase Kinase 3) is a major upstream kinase of the p38 MAP kinase and phosphorylates p38 in response to LPS. MKK3 and p38 MAP kinase are ancient and evolutionarily conserved components of metazoan defense against pathogen attack which predated the canonical Toll-like-receptors [9] . We have previously described the role of MKK3 in sepsis, a syndrome of excessive and inappropriate inflammatory response to infection. We also found that MKK3 deficiency leads to less lung inflammation and better survival in various models of sepsis such as cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) and LPS exposure [10] . Additionally, we found that MKK3 deficient endothelial cells have a larger pool of healthy mitochondria as shown by higher mitophagy, clearance of dysfunctional mitochondria, and increased mitochondrial biogenesis [11] . It has been reported that mitochondrial ROS regulates MKK3 and p38 but MKK3 regulation of mitochondrial function has not been reported, to the best of our knowledge [12] . Thus, we hypothesized that MKK3 deficiency will have specific effects on mitochondria and this in turn potently modulates inflammation.",

            "text": "Sepsis is an acute systemic inflammatory condition [15] . This life-threatening condition leads to more than 200,000 deaths in US, making it the leading cause of mortality in ICU patients. The hallmark of sepsis is a dysregulated and overwhelming inflammatory response, characterized by massive cytokine release, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction [16] . Several lines of evidence, genetic and functional, suggest that the mitochondrial function is the primary target during acute inflammation and that it is a central determinant of clinical outcome. It is proposed that inflammatory signaling leads to the phosphorylation of cytochrome oxidase (COX) and other mitochondrial targets followed by the suppression of mitochondrial function, reduced mitochondrial membrane potentials (MMP), and energy failure [17] [18] [19] . It has been shown that in animal models of severe inflammation ATP levels were significantly reduced compared with controls [20] . Similar results were reported in septic patients where reduced ATP levels were found in the \"non-survivors\" group compared to \"survivors\" group [21] . In addition organ failure in sepsis is linked to ATP depletion, as LPS induced lung injury is associated with reduced ATP [20, 22] . In a recently published study on gene expression profiling to identify genes associated with sepsis in human patients found that components of mitochondrial respiratory complex I (NDUFB8, NDUFC2, and NDUFS6) and ATP synthase (ATP5I) are down regulated in septic patients with a concomitant increase in the components of chemokine signaling pathway i.e. Forkhead box 3, Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3, and v-raf-1 murine leukemia viral oncogene homolog 1 [23] . In this context, we have earlier shown that MKK3 \u2212/\u2212 mice are resistant to septic injury [10] . Moreover the MKK3 \u2212/\u2212 cells and tissues showed higher mitochondrial biogenesis and mitophagy leading to a larger pool of healthy mitochondria [11] . In this study we show that MKK3 negatively affects mitochondrial function, which could be the driver of inflammatory outcome under septic conditions. The MKK3 \u2212/\u2212 BMDMs showed higher oxygen consumption at baseline and also had higher ATP production. The MMP and ATP levels were higher in MKK3 \u2212/\u2212 BMDMs, indicative of better mitochondrial function. This could be an important reason for the attenuated cytokine response against LPS-induced inflammation.",

            "text": "ROS contribute to inflammatory responses by activating key signaling pathways including the redox sensitive transcription factor pathway of nuclear factor \u03baB (NF-\u03baB) and the inflammasome [24] . Mitochondria produce more than 90% of the body's energy needs in the form of ATP, via oxidative phosphorylation. The majority of ROS production occurs within mitochondria during ATP generation. Also, being the major source of intracellular ROS, mitochondria are a major target of ROS-mediated damage. Mitochondrial ROS (mtROS) are important for cellular signaling but can also cause cell damage, and so are tightly regulated by endogenous antioxidant scavenging systems that limit damage [25] . Under conditions of stress or disease, ROS production is increased, antioxidant protection is decreased, mitochondrial damage occurs, and inflammation increases, creating a vicious cycle [26] . This self-sustaining and amplifying cycle between ROS generation, inflammatory responses, and mitochondrial impairment contributes to organ failure in patients with sepsis [19] . The MKK3 \u2212/\u2212 BMDMs showed lower levels of ROS and MitoSOX at baseline as well as after LPS treatment which could be due to either better ROS scavenging mechanisms or higher efficiency of respiratory complexes leading to reduced ROS production. Although ROS are clearly part of the septic sequence their specific role and importance relative to the energy crisis component has to be further examined. Based on our data it is apparent that MKK3 has dual effects on mitochondrial function and ROS generation as well as activation of MAP kinases, p-38 and JNK, affecting the inflammatory outcome.",

            "text": "Our study shows that MKK3 deficiency significantly reduced inflammatory responses by down regulating two major inflammatory pathways i.e. the NF-\u03baB and the inflammasome. Inflammatory responses to stimuli can be seen as a two-step process. First, the pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPS) (including LPS, a prototypical PAMP) induce a transcriptional response with production of cytokine mRNA and proteins which is mediated by transcription factors such as NF-\u03baB. The other step is, inflammasome activation, mediated by damage associated molecular patterns (DAMPS), which helps secretion of mature cytokines. Mitochondria are central to inflammatory responses by affecting both these steps [27] . It is known that the inflammatory transcription factors such as NF-\u03baB are redox sensitive and are activated by mitochondrial ROS. We observed reduced activation of NF-\u03baB after LPS exposure in MKK3 \u2212/\u2212 BMDMs which could be due to insufficient increase in ROS. Damaged mitochondria release DAMPS such as oxidized mitochondrial DNA into the cytoplasm that revs up the inflammatory response by activation of inflammasome [28] . The inflammasome is a caspase-1-activating multi-protein complex that promotes cleavage of many pro-cytokines to their biologically active forms [29] [30] . In addition, active caspase-1 cleaves other substrates like caspase-7 and sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBP), therefore playing an important role in cell death and survival [31] . Our data suggests that improved mitochondrial function in MKK3 \u2212/\u2212 BMDMs prevents the activation of caspase-1, which is instrumental in inflammatory cytokine release after LPS exposure. There are reports supporting this argument where it has been shown that in the presence of activated NF-\u03baB, mitochondrial ROS and oxidized mtDNA are important players in activation of inflammasome [32, 33] .",

            "text": "Given the important role mitochondria have in generating inflammation, modulators of mitochondrial function could be potential anti-inflammatory agents. Several mitochondriatargeted therapies have been tested including treatment with mitochondrial substrates (e.g., carnitine, succinate, and MgCl 2 -ATP), cofactors (e.g., coenzyme Q and \u03b1-lipoic acid), antioxidants and ROS scavengers (e.g., MitoQ, SkQ, phenyl-tert-butylnitrone, Nacetylcysteine, and Tempol), and membrane stabilizers (e.g., cyclosporine A and melatonin), which restore mitochondrial function to some extent [34, 35] . However, interfering with inflammatory signaling along with mitochondrial function might result in better outcomes. For example, the synthetic cortisol homologue dexamethasone, which affects several signaling pathways including Wnt/\u03b2-cateninin, NF\u03baB, MAPK/Erk, and PI3K signaling, was shown to partially rescue COX function 24 h after cecal ligation and puncture in the cortex and outer stripe of the outer medulla of mouse kidneys [36] . Based on our results it is apparent that MKK3 can be a potential target for reducing inflammation under septic conditions. Kinases are well known and druggable targets with many kinase inhibitors currently being developed [37] . Mitogen activated protein kinases (MAP kinases, MAPKs and p38), have been the focus of intense but ultimately unsuccessful search for inhibitors for anti-inflammatory and anti-sepsis applications. A limiting factor is that p38 inhibitors have significant side effects that restrict their clinical use [38] . MKK3 inhibition does not show any side effects associated with p38 inhibition because downstream signaling is tuned differently between the two kinases [39] .",
