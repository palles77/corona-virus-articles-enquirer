When caring for him, staff were advised to use personal protective equipment as recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Unfortunately, the patient died on October 8, and 2 nurses who had cared for him contracted EVD (1). This failure of infection control contributed to the public spread of panic, served as a wake-up call to the public health community, and helped convince the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that EVD should be treated only in specialized hospitals with highly trained personnel (2) .",

It is for these emerging experts that Lautenbach and colleagues have updated their book, Practical Healthcare Epidemiology, to a fourth edition.
