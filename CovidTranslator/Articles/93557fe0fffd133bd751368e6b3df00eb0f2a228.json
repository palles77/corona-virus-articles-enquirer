Since the introduction of variolation from the Near East in the early eighteenth century and the use of cowpox virus against Variola, there has been public concern about the safety and efficacy of vaccines. The concept of \"safety\" has changed with time, for reactions that were common when the risks of a serious disease were great are no longer acceptable. Although often exaggerated by individual passions, or groups who champion their own doctrines, several of today's concerns seem justified, especially when recognized problems with vaccines are not addressed in the light of existing knowledge or experience.",

This is illustrated by the full-day session devoted to vaccination practices at the July 1996 annual meeting of the AVMA at Cornell's Feline Practitioner's Seminar and at a recent symposium, European Symposium on Pet Vaccinology, held in France in September 1996. In an ideal world, real or presumed problems with companion animal vaccines would be addressed quickly and responsibly by industry, government regulatory officials, and the veterinary profession as soon as they are identified. Unfortunately, problems often are neglected or avoided. This circumstance contributes to confusion and the creation of myths, which often are enhanced by differing views of \"experts\" who have sometimes formed their own conclusions with limited data or biased sampling designs.",

They have often become elevated to catastrophes, however, especially by those who advocate a radical philosophy but ignore the benefits provided by vaccines. Concerns have sometimes led to the senseless conclusion that all vaccines are dangerous and are a direct or indirect cause of chronic illness (\"vaccinosis\"). '~Vaccinoses\" are claimed to range from \"devastated immune systems, laziness, bowel disease, bloat, stained teeth, ulcers, chronic gastroenteritis, autoimmune hemolytic anaemia, and seizures,\" to list but a few conditions that have been cited (Duval and Giger, 1996; Pitcairn, 1995; Priest, 1996; Starita-Mehan, 1997; Yarnall, 1995) . However, there are truths between the passion of some and indifference of others. Advocates of holistic vaccination practices, as inane as they may seem, may actually be doing a service to pet fanciers by bringing issues to the fore which have largely been ignored. Unfortunately, legitimate safety or efficacy problems have sometimes been disregarded until major misfortunes occurred. Nevertheless, those who experienced the rampant distemper outbreaks prior to the mid-1960s are amazed by the arguments presented by some critics, especially holistic believers. Within 2-3 years of the advent of efficacious distemper vaccines, the disease practically disappeared in vaccinated populations, but it has reappeared whenever vaccination had diminished. Undeniable progress has been made in the suppression of canine distemper and infectious hepatitis and, more recently, in controlling the canine parvovirus pandemic in a remarkably short period of time. However, the recent outbreaks of distemper in Scandinavia, and this year's epizootic in Alaska and northern Quebec, illustrate what may occur when distemper vaccine efficacy, or vaccine use, diminishes. Veterinarians and the public have become more sophisticated~and litigious; they want to know the facts about treatments they use. Unfortunately, many essential facts regarding vaccines are lacking and myths continue to flourish.",

How effective are they in preventing disease? Do both live and inactivated vaccines produce a sterilizing immunity so as to interrupt transmission? How soon does immunity occur after vaccination and how long does it endure? Why do vaccines continue to be developed against diseases that are still poorly understood? Are too many agents packaged as multicomponent vaccines, and what are the consequences? It has been well established that the immune system can respond normally to several different antigens--an issue that seem to persist; however, some combined vaccines that had inadequate field trial data prior to release have given rise to serious consequences in regard to safety. Unfortunately, answers to the questions above often reflect individual experiences, vested interests, or a disinclination to state that true answers are not known.",

Questions are often based on the perception that valid data are available. Also, many individuals do not accept the reality that vaccination, as other medical practices, sustain some risk.

Because \"attenuation\" means reduction, not absolute loss of the capacity to produce disease, safety problems may not be revealed until extensive field tests have been conducted; unfortunately, this has occurred after a product has been licensed and marketed. A conspicuous example of such failure was the large number of dogs that died or suffered serious illness following the introduction of a live canine coronavirus vaccine in 1983 (Martin, 1985; Wilson et al., 1986) . Also a vaccine judged harmless for one species may provoke illness in another one (Appel, 1987; Carmichael, 1997; Tizzard, 1990) . Because of the uncertainty of absolute safety with certain vaccines, for example, distemper vaccinal strains propagated in canine cell cultures, live viral vaccines are not recommended for most wildlife species, pregnant animals, unweaned pups, or pups that are ill. Yet, breeders and some veterinarians continue to vaccinate pregnant dams, pups as early as 2 weeks of age, or use vaccines for pet species where safety information in limited (e.g., ferrets).",

The majority are produced from the egg-adapted or avian cell culture-adapted Onderstepoort strain or the \"Rockborn strain,\" which is propagated in canine cell cultures (Rockborn et al., 1965) . The Rockborn strain is produced legitimately only by the Eu-ropean company authorized by Professor Gunnar Rockborn (G. Rockborn, personal communication, 1996) . That virus had undergone -<56 passages in cell cultures, whereas virus in several U.S. vaccines is used at lower passage levels. Thus, the designation \"Rockborn CD vaccine strain\" has been misrepresented by several authors in the past, including myself. Certain products also are claimed to contain the attenuated \"Snyder Hill\" strain, also grown in canine cell cultures, or a ferretorigin strain cultivated in avian cell cultures. It is difficult to determine the origin of those viral strains in a CD vaccine because some strains have been given novel designations by manufacturers and there are few genetic markers. Regardless of the viral strain employed, attenuated CD vaccines have proved highly effective when administered to dogs lacking maternal immunity, but they are variably effective in dogs with low levels of maternal antibodies.",

            "text": "As noted earlier, a recognized problem with certain CD vaccines, especially those propagated in canine cell cultures, is the variable occurrence of postvaccinal (PV) encephalitis, but actual risks are unknown (Appel, 1978 (Appel, , 1987 Appel and Gillespie, 1972; Carmichael, 1983) . Some CD vaccines are virulent for several zoo or wildlife species, some of which are now considered pets (e.g., ferrets, skunks, raccoons). Also, reversion to virulence of the attenuated Rockborn CD strain was demonstrated after serial passage in dogs, or in dog lung macrophages (Appel, 1978) . The canine cell-adapted vaccines are not recommended for pups less than 6 weeks of age, or for wildlife species, because of the greater risk of postvaccinal encephalitis. Field experience has demonstrated enhanced virulence of CD vaccines produced in canine cell cultures when administered in combination with certain other viruses. The most conspicuous have been canine adenovirus type 1 (CAV-1, ICH) and live CCV vaccines (Carmichael, 1983; Martin, 1985; Wilson et al., 1986) . Notwithstanding the risks noted earlier, the Rockborn strain (at passage level -~55-60) has been used as our laboratory's principal experimental vaccine for >40 years. The vaccine is adjusted to --103 TCDDo/dose, since the minimal immunizing dose (MID) of the \"Rockborn strain\" is -~20 TCD5o. In such instances, no cases of postvaccinal encephalitis have been observed in field use. However, in laboratory experiments, when the vaccine dose was more than 10 .5.5 TCD5o/ml, or when vaccine was given together with live CAV-1, encephalitis was a frequent occurrence about 10-12 days postvaccination. Field reports indicated that the frequency of postvaccinal CD encephalitis diminished greatly after the substitution of CAV-2 for CAV-1 in combined vaccines. This was one reason for advocating the substitution of CAV-2 for CAV-1 in canine vaccines, in addition to the marked, but not total, reduction in postvaccinal \"blue eyes\" that occurred frequently after vaccination with CAV-1. Manufacturers who utilize canine cell-grown CDV should, therefore, determine optimal safe doses. My personal view is that each vaccine should have the MID indicated on the package insert; this seems important with both CD and CPV-2 vaccines, but for different reasons (see below). If CD vaccinal titers were kept low (<-103-O/dose), the excellent immunity provided by CD vaccines grown in canine cells would probably be attended by a more acceptable risk of PV reactions.",

Although inactivated vaccines for CPV-2 provide only limited protection against infection, dogs may be exempt from disease for several months (Carmichael, 1983; Pollock and Carmichael, 1990) . Like distemper, reports of the actual duration of immunity to inactivated CPV-2 vaccines are very limited. It is not known whether immunologic memory provides immunity beyond the period when antibody has declined below detectable levels; it also is not known whether all killed vaccines perform in a similar manner since the magnitude of the antibody responses is related to the amount of viral antigen administered. Because inactivated vaccines do not interrupt transmission of virulent virus, except for belief periods of time (~2-3 months), they are not recommended where large numbers of dogs are raised, that is, breeding kennels, pet shops, and animal shelters or where dogs are at high risk of exposure, such as at shows or field trials. It should be obvious that inactivated vaccines should not be followed by MLV vaccines, or the reverse, because antibodies engendered by the killed vaccine will neutralize the live virus; in the latter instance, the killed vaccine would be wasted if the MLV vaccine had immunized.",

In recent tests, 5 male dogs that had received a commercial product (combined vaccine), and were maintained in a commercial specific pathogen-free colony, had titers > 1:320 more than 6.5 years later. Similar studies with other CPV-2 vaccines have not been published, but tests done in our laboratory in 1987-1990 revealed that serum HI antibody titers in dogs that had received certain commercial vaccines had declined to -1:10 within 2-2.5 years.

One study of possible benefit by an inactivated CCV vaccine to prevent the serious consequences attending infection by CPV-2 and CCV failed to demonstrate protection (M. Appel, unpublished results, 1985) . Also, dual infections now appear to be rare in vaccinated dogs as the result of the extensive use of CPV-2 vaccines.",

The history of CCV vaccines is convoluted and not without misfortune. The first licensed modified live CCV vaccine was rescinded shortly after its introduction in 1983 because of severe adverse reactions with lesions that resembled those of FIP (Martin, 1985) . Those reactions occurred in an estimated 5% of vaccinated pups, generally ones <12 weeks of age. An inactivated CCV vaccine that had been licensed also was withdrawn from the market shortly after it was issued because of inadequate efficacy. In addition, a second licensed modified live CCV product which was combined with a canine cell-grown CD vaccine was withdrawn because of a high frequency of post vaccinal CD encepha-litis. That vaccine has since been reformulated to exclude the distemper component, which appears to have contributed to the problem. Interestingly, the latter CCV vaccine strain had been licensed for use in California, where it had been marketed for more than 10 years in combination with CPV-2 and distemper vaccine, and the manufacturer affirmed that there had been no adverse reactions. The most recently licensed CCV vaccine comprises a killed FECV product, but information on that vaccine, as well as with most others, is limited mainly to promotional information.",
