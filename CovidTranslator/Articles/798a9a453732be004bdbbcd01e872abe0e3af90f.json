We propose a model derived from well-known models in epidemic to estimate the needed number of places in intensive care units. The model will help decision-makers to plan resources in the short and medium-term in order to guarantee appropriate treatments to all patients needing it. We analyse Italian data at regional level up to March 15th aiming to: (i) support health and government decision-makers in gathering rapid and efficient decisions on increasing health structures capacities (in terms of ICU slots) and (ii) define a scalable geographic model to plan emergency and future COVID-19 patients management using reallocating them among health structures. Finally, the here proposed model can be useful in countries where COVID-19 is not yet strongly diffused.",

A fraction of patients do not need hospitalisation, and 27 the symptoms disappear in a short time (around 1-2 weeks). In some cases, 28 COVID-19 causes severe pneumonia, which requires respiratory support and 29 can lead to death, especially in the presence of co-morbidities such as diabetes 30 or hypertension [3] .

The lesson learned in China has been used in other countries such as Singapore for preparing a correct strategy for managing people. As noted in [8], preparing ICUs for COVID-19 patients has special requirements such as controlling infection diffusion from patient to medical staff and among patients avoiding the use of ICUs occupied by other patients. Moreover, the evolving scenario related to COVID-19 has required more frequent communication among clinicians. In Italy 1 on March 15, we report 24, 747 total cases, 20, 603 people currently affected, 1, 809 deaths and 2, 335 recovered patients. Regarding infected people: 9, 268 are treated in their homes since they do not have severe ill, 9, 663 patients have been hospitalised, and 1, 672 patients have been admitted to ICUs. To react to the exponential growth of infected patients requiring hospital-53 1 http://www.salute.gov.it/portale/nuovocoronavirus/ dettaglioContenutiNuovoCoronavirus.jsp isation, the Chinese government decided to build a large emergency hospital dedicated to COVID-19 patients in a few days. In Italy, the plan is to improve existing structures by extending the number of ICU resources and beds, as well as using dedicated health structures.
