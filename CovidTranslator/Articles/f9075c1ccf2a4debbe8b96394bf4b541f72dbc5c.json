In this study, the effects of lipopolysaccharides with different structures on lycopene biosynthesis were investigated. Firstly, the heterogenous crtEBI operon were overexpressed in 10 LPS mutant strains of E. coli W3110 (\u0394waaC, \u0394waaF, \u0394waaY, \u0394waaG, \u0394waaR, \u0394waaO, \u0394waaU, \u0394waaP, \u0394waaY and \u0394waaB), and their ability to produce lycopene were compared. \u0394waaC/pWSK29-crtEBI, \u0394waaF/pWSK29-crtEBI and \u0394waaY/pWSK29-crtEBI produced 4.19, 4.20, and 3.81 mg/g lycopene, respectively, while the control W3110/pWSK29-crtEBI produced 3.71 mg/g lycopene; the other strains produced less lycopene than the control. In order to enhance lycopene production, genes dxr, dxr, ispA, and idi were overexpressed in \u0394waaC/pWSK29-crtEBI, \u0394waaF/pWSK29-crtEBI individually or in combination, and the lycopene production in each strain was analyzed. The maximum yield of 5.39 mg/g was achieved in \u0394waaC/pWSK29-crtEBI-SRA, which is 142% higher than that in W3110/pWSK29-crtEBI. The results indicate that the length of lipopolysaccharide affects lycopene biosynthesis in E. coli, and the shorter lipopolysaccharide and higher outer membrane permeability might be beneficial to lycopene biosynthesis.",

We have constructed E. coli mutants that could synthesize different length of lipopolysaccharides (LPS), the major molecules in the outer membrane, and found that the structure of LPS is closely relevant to the outer membrane permeability [4] .",

            "text": "Lycopene is a bright red carotenoid pigment with 11 conjugated double bonds, and is an efficient singlet oxygen quencher. Recent advance in metabolic engineering has provided a very promising route for the heterologous production of lycopene within various microorganisms. E. coli has been widely utilized as microbial cell factory for the synthesis of various carotenoids [5] . E. coli can naturally synthesize (2E, 6E)-farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) from 3-phospho-D-glycerate and pyruvate through a series of catalytic reactions; expressing heterologous crtE, crtB and crtI in E. coli can convert FPP into lycopene (Fig. 1 ). Different types of plasmids have been used to carry the genes crtE, crtB and crtI to synthesize lycopene in E. coli [6] . Isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) and dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP), are synthesized via MEP pathway in E. coli [7] . In the MEP pathway, isopentenyl diphosphate isomerase encoded by idi, 1-deoxyxylulose-5-phosphate synthase encoded by dxs, 4-diphosphocytidyl-2C-methyl-D-erythritol synthase encoded by ispD, and 2C-methyl-D-erythritol 2,4-cyclodiphosphate synthase encoded by ispF play important roles; therefore, over-expressing these genes has been used to elevate isoprenoid accumulation [5, 8, 9] . For example, overexpressing idi could significantly stimulate carotenoid synthesis [10] [11] [12] [13] . Enhancing the gene expression by chromosomal promoter replacement [14] or introduction of a heterologous mevalonate pathway to increase IPP and DMAPP supply [15] have also been used for carotenoid synthesis.",

            "text": "Biocatalysis employing the whole cell had been increasingly developed as a green technology in the synthesis of various valuable products, while low permeability of cell membrane always lead to the low productivities [3] . The outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria provided the cell with an effective permeability barrier against external noxious agents [18] , and at the same time to allow the influx of nutrient molecules [19] . In the previous publications, lpp deletion was developed as a general permeabilization method. The lpp mutant had higher permeability of outer membrane and higher ability to synthesize Lcarnitine [3] . Besides, expression of SCVE viroporins in E. coli also improved the diffusivity of small molecules across outer membrane through introducing additional pores within the outer membrane. As expected, the biocatalysts efficiency of E. coli was enhanced [2] . LPS, as the major molecule in outer membrane, played important roles on membrane behavior. In E. coli, LPS typically consists of a hydrophobic domain known as lipid A, a nonrepeating core oligosaccharide, and a distal polysaccharide known as O-antigen repeats. The core oligosaccharide is assembled on lipid A via sequential glycosyl transfer from nucleotide sugar precursors. In E. coli, the chromosomal waa locus encodes enzymes required for biosynthesis of the core oligosaccharide [20] . Mutations in LPS could alter outer membrane stability, giving rise to pleiotropic phenotype [21, 22] . Among 10 W3110 \u0394waa mutant strains, W3110 \u0394waaC has the simplest LPS structure. In compared to W3110, W3110 \u0394waaC had four-fold higher membrane permeability, and this likely benefited for lycopene accumulation. Comparative transcriptome showed that mRNA levels of dxr and ispA in \u0394waaC and \u0394waaF were up-regulated, compared to W3110 (data not shown). The over-expression of the dxr gene provided more IPP precursors in the MEP pathway in tobacco, which consequently stimulated synthesis efficiency of isoprenoid downstream [23] . IPP and DMAPP supply likely limited lycopene biosynthesis [9] . Besides, the accumulation of metabolites in the MEP pathway stimulated the transcription of dxs and dxr in Arabidopsis cell culture [24] . In the current study, therefore, the genes dxs, dxr and idi were overexpressed individually or in combination, to increase these precursors supply. As expected, the overexpression of genes in MEP pathway stimulated lycopene synthesis [25] .",
