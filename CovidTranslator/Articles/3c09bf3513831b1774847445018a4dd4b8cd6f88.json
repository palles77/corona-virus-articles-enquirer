Major glycans were high-mannose (Man 5-9 GlcNAc 2 ), hybrid and bi-, tri-and tetra-antennary complex with and without bisecting GlcNAc and core fucose. Complex glycans with fewer than the full complement of galactose residues were present and sialylation was negligible. Treatment with the glucosidase inhibitor Nbutyl-deoxynojirimycin (NB-DNJ) inhibited N-glycan processing as evidenced by the appearance of glycans of composition Glc 3 Man 7-9 GlcNAc 2 . However, some complex glycans remained suggesting the presence of an \u03b1-endomannosidase. Our data in tissue culture indicate that inhibition of N-glycan processing may be considered as a therapeutic strategy against SARS CoV infections.",

During this time, there were approximately 8100 probable SARS cases and approximately 800 recorded fatalities (http://www.wpro.who.int/sars/). Rapid identification of individuals presenting with the disease as well as appropriate nursing techniques and quarantine procedures allowed the outbreak to be controlled by July of 2003. There have since been smaller outbreaks of the disease, but these have been contained with minimal secondary transmission. In the clinic, SARS-CoV infection presents as atypical pneumonia, with patients reporting symptoms of high fever (N38\u00b0C), dry cough, shortness of breath (dyspnea) and/or more severe breathing difficulties, which may occasionally require mechanical ventilation. The viral reservoirs are presumed to be bats (Wang and Eaton, 2007; Wang et al., 2006) and the palm civet cat has been implicated as a carrier of the virus, though there may also be other asymptomatic animal carriers (Shi and Hu, 2008) .",

The C-type lectins DC-SIGN and L-SIGN (DC/ L-SIGN) can enhance viral entry (Marzi et al., 2004; Yang et al., 2004) . Site-directed mutagenesis analyses have identified seven glycosylation sites on the S protein critical for DC/L-SIGN-mediated virus entry. They include asparagine residues 109, 118, 119, 158, 227, 589, and 699 , which are distinct from residues of the ACE2binding domain (amino acids 318-510) (Han et al., 2007) . Recently, L-SIGN (DC-SIGNR) has been shown to act as an entry receptor for SARS-CoV infection (Jeffers et al., 2004) , and its expression in lung alveolar and liver cells correlates with the disease pathogenesis observed in these organs in many SARS patients.",

Traces obtained before and after digestion with Arthrobacter ureafaciens sialidase (Fig. 2b) were virtually identical showing negligible incorporation of sialic acid in these glycans. Previous work (Feldmann et al., 1994) has also shown a lack of sialylated N-glycans in Marburg virus grown in Vero E6 cells. The positive ion MALDI (Fig. 3) and negative ion nanoelectrospray spectra were similar to each other and to the HPLC trace although more glycans were resolved by mass spectrometry. Table 1 lists the identified glycans and their percentage of the total glycan pool as measured by MALDI-TOF MS and Table 2 lists the percentage of various compound glycan types.

The HPLC traces obtained after ABS and bovine testis \u03b2-galactosidase (BTG) treatment ( Fig. 2c ) confirmed attachment of galactose at the non-reducing termini of the glycan antenna. Further incubation with hexosaminidase ( Fig. 2d ) reduced the profile to Man 3 GlcNAc 2 , Man 3 GlcNAc 2 Fuc 1 and a series of unaffected high-mannose glycans. A few compounds were present at concentrations that were too weak to permit acquisition of informative MS/MS spectra. However, their structures could be deduced from the structures of related compounds, e.g., complex glycans with different numbers of galactose residues. Such compounds are identified in Table 1 . Ion nomenclature in the following discussion follows that introduced by Domon and Costello (1988) as modified by Harvey et al. (2004) by the use of the subscript \"R\" to specify cleavages adjacent to the reducing-terminal GlcNAc residue and \"R-1\" to specify cleavages adjacent to the penultimate GlcNAc in order to avoid confusion by the subscript number changing as a function of antenna length.",

Incubation with Aspergillus saitoi a-mannosidase (data not shown) reduced the larger compounds to Man 5 GlcNAc 2 (compound 3, Table 1 ) confirming the \u03b1mannose linkages. The negative ion MS/MS spectra of the highmannose glycans Man 5-9 GlcNAc 2 (phosphate adducts) are shown in Fig. 4 . The cross-ring 2,4 A R and 2,4 A R-1 fragments together with the B R-1 ion at the high-mass end of the spectra define the 1\u21924-linked chitobiose core (Harvey, 2005b; Harvey et al., 2008b) and the single C 1 fragment at m/z 179 confirmed hexose (mannose) as the only nonreducing end residue. The ions towards the centre of the spectrum were mainly derived from the 6-antenna and allowed the distribution of the mannose residues between the two antennae to be determined. Predominant among these ions were the D-ion (formal loss of the 3antenna from the C R-1 ion), the [D-18] \u2212 ion and the O,3 A R-2 cross-ring cleavage fragment (core mannose residue) (Harvey, 2005b) . Thus, Man 5 GlcNAc 2 (3) produced a spectrum with these ions at m/z 647, 629 and 575, respectively. Further confirmation of the substitution pattern was provided by the C 2 ion at m/z 503 (three mannose residues). In the spectrum of Man 6 GlcNAc 2 (7, Fig. 4b ) the D, [D-18] \u2212 and O,3 A R-2 ions were in the same position as in the spectrum of Man 5 GlcNAc 2 showing that the sixth mannose was attached to the 3antenna. These three diagnostic ions all shifted by 162 mass units to higher mass in the spectrum of Man 7 GlcNAc 2 (12, Fig. 4c ) showing that the seventh mannose was attached to the 6-antenna and the high abundance of the ion at m/z 485 was consistent with its location on the 6-branch of this antenna. This ion, termed D\u2032, is thought to be equivalent to ion D as the result of the same substitution pattern of the branched mannose of the 6-antenna to that at the mannose of the core. This same pattern of D, [D-18] \u2212 , O,3 A R-2 and D\u2032 ions was present in the spectrum of Man 8 GlcNAc 2 (19, Fig. 4d ) confirming attachment of the 8 th mannose to the 3-antenna and indicating that this compound had the classical d1,d3-substitution pattern. Finally, in the spectrum of Man 9 GlcNAc 2 (25, Fig. 4e ), the three 6-antennaderived diagnostic ions shifted upwards by another 162 mass units to m/z 971, 953 and 899 as the result of the extra mannose residue in the 6-antenna. The presence of a second set of the D, [D-18] \u2212 , O,3 A R-2 ions at m/z 647, 629 and 575 in the spectrum of Man 7 GlcNAc 2 (12) indicated the presence of a second isomer with three mannose residues in the 3-antenna. A fragmentation spectrum was not obtained for Man 4 GlcNAc 2 (1).",

No antenna-substituted fucose was detected in these or in the spectra of the complex glycans. The composition of the 3-antenna was specified by the mass of an Etype cross-ring fragment ion (substituents plus 101 mass units from the mannose residue (Harvey, 2005c; Harvey et al., 2008b) ). These ions were of low abundance but were present at m/z 304 and 466 in the spectrum shown in Fig. 5a and at m/z 466 in Fig. 5b confirming the presence of GlcNAc and Gal-GlcNAc antennae respectively. The 3antenna composition was further defined by an O,3 A cross-ring cleavage ion formed by fragmentation of the mannose residue and which appeared at 59 mass units above the mass of the substituents linked to the mannose (m/z 262 for a GlcNAc-containing antenna and m/z 424 for Gal-GlcNAc, see Fig. 5 ).",

Exoglycosidase digestion with ABS, BTG and GUH (Fig. 2) showed that the antennae consisted of galactose and GlcNAc only. Their negative ion MS/MS spectra were identical to those from reference standards. The branching structure of the triantennary glycan (29, Fig. 6c ) was revealed by the mass of the E 3 ion (m/z 831, the subscript \"3\" indicates its origin from the 3antenna) (Harvey, 2005c; Harvey et al., 2008a) . This ion was also present in the spectrum of the tetra-antennary glycan (34, Fig. 6d ) but, whereas the D and [D-18] \u2212 ions from the 6-antenna in the spectrum of the triantennary glycan were at the same m/z values (688 and 670 respectively) as in the spectrum of the biantennary glycan (Fig. 6a) , they moved to m/z 1053 and 1035 in the spectrum of the tetra-antennary glycan reflecting the presence of the additional Gal-GlcNAc moiety in the 6-antenna. An additional [D-36] \u2212 ion at m/z 1017 was also characteristic of this branched structure on the 6antenna. The fucose substitution pattern on the core GlcNAc residue was defined by the masses of the 2,4 A R , 2,4 A R-1 and B R-1 ions as described above. The occurrence of a bisecting GlcNAc residue was determined by the presence of an abundant [D-221] \u2212 ion (e.g., m/z 670 in Fig. 6b) , equivalent in mass to the [M-18] \u2212 ion from the corresponding compound that did not contain a bisecting GlcNAc residue, as described earlier (Harvey et al., 2008b) .",

However, the high abundance of the peak labelled as 29 in Fig. 8b is accounted for by the isomer of Man 8 GlcNAc 2 that has lost a mannose residue from the 3-antenna (same GU value as the fucosylated triantennary glycan) supporting this proposal. Although the postulated endomannosidase activity permits extensive N-glycan processing with the production of complex glycans and a nearly normal profile in the presence of NB-DNJ, the drug prevents formation of the mono-glucosylated N-glycans that are necessary for binding to the chaperones calnexin and calreticulin that are essential for correct protein folding. Viral surface glycoproteins are dependent on such an interaction for correct folding (Vigerust and Shepherd, 2007) . Thus, \u03b1-glucosidase inhibition will prevent this interaction and potentially lead to regional or global glycoprotein misfolding. Therefore, the observation that the SARS-CoV S glycoprotein can undergo extensive N-glycan processing to complex structures in the presence of NB-DNJ does not necessarily correlate with proper glycoprotein folding. Unfortunately, the necessary conformationally sensitive anti-SARS-CoV S antibodies for testing this conclusion were not available at the time this study was performed. Improper folding induced by NB-DNJ could explain the protective effect of the drug towards viral infection but the ability to retain complex N-glycan processing could contribute to the drug's low cytotoxicity.",
