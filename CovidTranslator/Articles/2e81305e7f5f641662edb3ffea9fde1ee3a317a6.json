Methods: Patients with unexplained fever and thrombocytopenia were enrolled. Viruses were detected using real-time PCR, and bacteria were measured by culturing methods. Serum cytokines, platelet antibody IgG (PA-IgG) and Helicobacter pylori (HP) were detected using ELISA. Results: Pathogens were detected in 74.68% of patients, which included single fungal/viral/bacterial infection and multiple infection. The pathogens could not be unidentified in 25.32% of cases. Cytokines including Interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, interferon-\u03b3(IFN-\u03b3), platelet activating factor (PAF) and PA-IgG were significantly higher in patients as compared to healthy controls (P < .01 or P < .05). Principal component analyses extracted four groups of parameters that have a strong positive predicting value, revealing that disease status evaluation would be more accurate if we combined the platelet parameters and inflammatory biomarkers. While event-free survival (EFS) that indicates the time of platelet elevated after therapy was the highest in patients with single bacterial or fungal infection, EFS was affected by the levels of cytokines and PA-IgG. Conclusions: Differences in immune function may be the main factors affecting the prognosis of patients with fever and thrombocytopenia, while treatment based on precise etiological diagnosis is important for therapeutic efficacy.",

            "text": "Fever and thrombocytopenia are frequent symptoms in patients with viral infection. Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS), caused by a novel bunyavirus, was initially identified in 2009. SFTS produces a broad spectrum of clinical manifestations that range from acute self-limited febrile illness to severe disease, with a reported fatality rate varying between 12% and 30% [1] . Due to its poor prognosis and higher mortality, SFTS has quickly become an emerging infectious disease that has aroused extensive surveillance in public health. Currently, SFTS, together with meningitis syndrome and respiratory syndrome, are the primary three syndromes that are monitored in clinic. Unlike other inflammatory disease, the etiology of fever and thrombocytopenia is quite complicated; thrombocytopenia may arise due to a lack of platelet production, retention of platelets (PLTs) in the spleen, platelet destruction, or increased use and dilution of PLTs. In clinic, most thrombocytopenia patients are diagnosed as primary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) that is defined as a peripheral blood platelet count < 100 \u00d7 10 9 /l in the absence of any obvious cause of thrombocytopenia [2] . Because the etiology of ITP is so complicated that physicians seldom relies on its etiology to formulate treatment plans, then, it is difficult to explain why some patients have poor therapeutic efficacy.",

Evidence regarding the cross-reactivity of virus-specific antibodies with normal platelet antigens was firstly obtained in patients developing ITP after contracting human immune deficiency virus [3] and varicella-zoster virus infection [4] . Since then, it has been discovered that thrombocytopenia and viral infections occur in succession. Thrombocytopenia as a major clinical sign is found in some viral infectious diseases including Zika virus, HIV-1, hepatitis B/hepatitis C virus, dengue virus, Epstein-Barr virus, B19 virus, and novel bunyavirus [1, [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] . A previous study showed that patients with influenza virus A/B or parainfluenza virus 1 infections tend to have a lower PLT count than patients who did not have respiratory viral infection, while patients with human metapneumovirus, parainfluenza virus 2, coronavirus 229, or adenovirus infections did not show significant changes in the PLT count [13] . In some patients, thrombocytopenia caused by viral infection was transient without serious bleeding and spontaneously resolved within a few weeks without treatment [14] ; however, other patients have a severe bleeding syndrome and worse prognosis. The mechanism remains to be elucidated.",

Additionally, it was observed that salmonella survived and replicated in macrophages that spread to the lymphatic vessels, spleen, and bone marrow, and thrombocytopenia may be associated with hemophagocytic histiocytes in the bone marrow [16] . Fecal microbial transplantation may also lead to thrombocytopenia during inflammation [17] . Staphylococcus aureus activates platelets through several surface-expressed proteins, and binds to adhered platelets to cause platelet activation and aggregation, resulting in thrombocytopenia [18] .

Platelets with bound autoantibodies are subsequently recognized by phagocytes bearing Fc\u03b3 -receptors (Fc\u03b3Rs), which results in enhanced antibodymediated platelet phagocytosis and destruction primarily in the spleen [21] . In patients with ITP autoantibodies targeting platelet surface glycoproteins, primarily GPIIb-IIIa and GPIb-IX, lead to Fc-dependent clearance via macrophages [22] . Platelets express FccRIIA, an IgG receptor used to identify immune complexes (ICs). FccRIIA is involved in the initiation of strong effectors functions in leukocytes, including cytokine release, antibody-dependent cell-mediated pathogen killing, and ICs internalization, which is critical for immune and inflammatory responses. Virus or bacteria can activate platelets via FccRIIA that plays an important role in the interaction of platelet and pathogen infection, and the polymorphism of FccRIIA-131 directly affects the susceptibility and severity of infection [23] . However, the relationship among the platelet autoantibodies, cytokines, and other parameters associated infection is still not clear.",

The obscure etiology and mechanisms of thrombocytopenia greatly affect its therapeutic efficacy. First-line therapy for ITP consists of corticosteroids with or without intravenous immunoglobulin [2] , and some patients respond to this while others do not. Nowadays, there are no valuable biomarkers to predict the therapeutic efficacy. Etiologic diagnosis of thrombocytopenia may be beneficial for treatment, to some ITP caused by viral infections, accurate etiologic diagnosis can reduce the amount of antibiotics used. Unfortunately, the diagnosis of ITP is still based on exclusion [26] . The relationships among the etiology of fever and thrombocytopenia, the intrinsic immune mechanism, and therapeutic efficacy remain to be elucidated. To clarify the above issues, patients with unexplained fever and thrombocytopenia were enrolled in this study. The associations among the etiology, platelet autoantibody, cytokine expression, and therapeutic efficacy were investigated with the aim of determining valuable parameters that mirror the pathogenesis and predict therapeutic efficacy of thrombocytopenia.",

Pathogenic microbiome may cause thrombocytopenia by autoimmunity mechanisms, mainly through molecules or epitopes that mimic autoantigens, the immunological recognition of previously unexposed auto-antigens, or via bystanders that activate their own responses to lymphocytes and super-antigen-mediated polyclonal T cell activation with exaggerated cytokine release [29] . Studies have shown that an imbalance of T helper cell (Th) and regulatory T cell (Treg) cytokines may mediate the pathogenesis of thrombocytopenia, which is closely related to the expression of Th1 cytokines (i.e., IFN-\u03b3, IL-2), Th2 cytokines (i.e., IL-4, IL-10), Th17 cytokines (IL-17), and Treg cytokines (TGF-\u03b21) [30] . Consistent with previous studies, up-regulated cytokines were found in our patients with fever and thrombocytopenia, especially IL-6, IL-10, and IFN-\u03b3, indicating that cytokine disorders may be involved in the pathogenesis of newly diagnosed ITPs [31, 32] . Notably, IL-6 in thrombocytopenia patients was significantly higher as compared to healthy controls, and IL-6 in the viral group was the highest among all groups. Moreover, our results revealed that IL-6, together with CRP and PCT, has a strong positive loading in mirroring the pathogenesis of thrombocytopenia. PAF is a potent and versatile mediator of pro-inflammation secreted by WBCs [33] , which triggers platelet aggregation and activation. Monocytes that encounter dengue virus begin to generate PAF [34] , and this leads to enhanced apoptosis of platelets and accelerates platelets clearance in secondary dengue infection [35] . The PAF concentration in our patients with fever and thrombocytopenia was significantly higher as compared to the healthy controls, revealing that PAF may involve in the platelet's apoptosis and clearance in infectious thrombocytopenia. The dose-dependent effect of PAF may induce the release of cytokines and affect the host immune response. A previous study showed that PAF can stimulate mononuclear cells of peripheral blood leading to the release of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 in viral infection [36] . PAF itself or combined with LPS can promote platelet activation and recruitment and worsen endotoxin-induced injury [37, 38] . Therefore, PAF and cytokines potentiate each other's effects in vivo to modulate the immune response [39] . The strong associations were found between PAF and IL-6, between PAF and IL-10, between PAF and CRP, revealing the PAF, interacting with IL-6 and IL-10, are jointly responsible for thrombocytopenia [25] .",

Through antibody-induced immune-mediated phagocytosis and complement activation, alloantibodies destroy platelets and eliminate them from the circulation [41] . In as many as 30% to 40% of the patients, no detectible antibodies can be found, however, studies have shown that antibodies can cause thrombocytopenia even if the platelet-associated antibody levels in humans are lower than the detection limits of conventional methods. Therefore, the detection of the relevant antibodies is the primary condition for diagnosis and treatment [42] as the presence of autoantibodies targeting GPIb-IX is an effective predictor for refractoriness to steroid or IVIG therapy [43] . In this study, only 2 patients were negative in the PA-IgG test in 79 selected patients, indicating that antibody-mediated clearance maybe the main reason for our patients with fever and thrombocytopenia.",

The curative effects of anti-H. pylori therapy on improved blood platelet quantity in chronic immune thrombocytopenia is inconsistent [45, 46] . In this study, H. pylori has caused the highest morbidity among bacteria inducing thrombocytopenia. There may be a cross-reaction between H. pylori cytotoxin-related gene (CagA) antibodies and platelet antigens, causing platelet-accelerated clearance. In H. pylori-positive patients, significantly higher levels of IL-6, IL-10, and PAF were found when compared with those in the H. pylori-negative group. Because of the involvement of cytokines, the pathogenesis of H. pylori-induced thrombocytopenia is more complex than initially believed. Unfortunately, the mechanism of H. pylori-induced thrombocytopenia is obscure. Revealing the interaction between H. pylori and thrombocytopenia will greatly expand the choices of therapeutic options.",

Our data showed that best therapeutic efficacy occurred in the single f/b infectious group, and patients in this group had the highest EFS. The worst therapeutic efficacy was found in the multiple infectious group. Platelet-virus interaction can occur via a variety of receptors expressed on platelets, which are mainly mediated by toll like receptors (TLRs) [47] . Accordingly, different pathogens may interact with its special TLRs on platelets. It is postulated that pathogens recognized by TLRs increase platelet destruction, which is multiplied in the presence of anti-platelet antibodies due to the synergy with TLRs, and then increases R-Fc-mediated phagocytosis [48] . The TLRs activate different signaling pathways and affect cells producing inflammatory cytokines [49] . Therefore, the cytokine production may vary due to the different types of microbiomes. As cytokines involved in immune function adjustment and modulation of the anti-platelet antibody response by B Table 3 The spearman correlation coefficients of six cytokines in patients with fever and thrombocytopenia. IL-6 (pg/ml) IL-10 (pg/ml) IL-12/23P40 (pg/ml) The level of statistical significance (P) was set at 5%. \u204e and \u204e\u204e indicate the statistically significant spearman correlation at the 0.05 level and 0.01 level, respectively. Abbreviations: AUC, areas under curve. [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] cells [50, 51] , they may closely related to the platelet destruction. Therefore, we used the levels of cytokines as a stratification variable for EFS, the results showed that cytokine play a significant role in EFS. Patients with lower levels of IL-6, IL-10, IL-17A, and IFN-\u03b3 tended to have longer EFS than in patients with higher levels of cytokines. Previous study revealed that IL-22 is elevated in active phases of disease, and decreases in patients responsive to dexamethasone [52] . These results indicate that cytokines could reflect the disease status and the therapeutic effect. The etiology of thrombocytopenia with a viral/bacterial infection may also be due to non-immunological mechanisms. The virus-induced pro-inflammatory environment itself often leads to further platelet activation in viremic patients [53] . Viruses can trigger a decrease in platelet production by infection of megakaryocytes and hematopoietic stem cells to decrease platelet formation; additionally, virus-infected platelets can expose P-selectin or phosphatidylserine, promoting their phagocytosis by macrophages [35] . Another viable mechanism is the formation of mixed platelet-leukocyte aggregates in adenovirus infection [54] that rapidly reduce platelet counts [55] .",
