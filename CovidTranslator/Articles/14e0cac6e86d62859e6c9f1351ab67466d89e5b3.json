In the present study, we demonstrate that hnRNP A1 also participates in the transcription and replication of a cytoplasmic RNA virus, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV). Overexpression of hnRNP A1 accelerated the kinetics of viral RNA synthesis, whereas the expression in the cytoplasm of a dominant-negative hnRNP A1 mutant that lacks the nuclear transport domain signi\u00aecantly delayed it. The hnRNP A1 mutant caused a global inhibition of viral mRNA transcription and genomic replication, and also a preferential inhibition of the replication of defective-interfering RNAs. Similar to the wild-type hnRNP A1, the hnRNP A1 mutant complexed with an MHV polymerase gene product, the nucleocapsid protein and the viral RNA. However, in contrast to the wild-type hnRNP A1, the mutant protein failed to bind a 250 kDa cellular protein, suggesting that the recruitment of cellular proteins by hnRNP A1 is important for MHV RNA synthesis. Our \u00aendings establish the importance of cellular factors in viral RNA-dependent RNA synthesis.",

            "text": "Introduction hnRNP A1 is an RNA-binding protein that contains two RNA-binding domains (RBDs) and a glycine-rich domain responsible for protein\u00b1protein interaction. It is involved in pre-mRNA splicing and transport of cellular RNAs (reviewed by Dreyfuss et al., 1993) . It is predominantly located in the nucleus, but also shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm (Pin \u00c4ol-Roma and Dreyfuss, 1992) . The signal that mediates shuttling has been identi\u00aeed as a 38 amino acid sequence, termed M9, located near the C-terminus of hnRNP A1 between amino acids 268 and 305 (Michael et al., 1995; Siomi and Dreyfuss, 1995; Weighardt et al., 1995) . Yeast two-hybrid screening with M9 as bait resulted in the discovery of a novel transportin-mediated pathway for nuclear import of hnRNP A1 (Pollard et al., 1996; Fridell et al., 1997; Siomi et al., 1997) . The function of the cytoplasmic hnRNP A1 has not been well de\u00aened. Studies have shown that cytoplasmic and nuclear hnRNP A1 exhibit different RNA-binding pro\u00aeles. Cytoplasmic hnRNP A1 is capable of high-af\u00aenity binding to AU-rich elements that modulate mRNA turnover and translation (Hamilton et al., 1993 (Hamilton et al., , 1997 Henics et al., 1994) . It has also been shown to promote ribosome binding to mRNAs by a cap-mediated mechanism, and prevent spurious initiation at aberrant translation start sites (Svitkin et al., 1996) .",

            "text": "MHV belongs to the Coronaviridae family of positivesense, single-stranded RNA viruses. MHV replication and transcription occur exclusively in the cytoplasm of infected cells via the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) (reviewed by Lai and Cavanagh, 1997) . Initially, the 5\u00a2-most gene 1 of the viral genome is translated into the viral RdRp, which then replicates the viral genomic RNAs into negative-strand RNAs. Subsequently, the negative-strand RNAs are used as templates to transcribe mRNAs, which include a genomic-sized RNA and a nested set of subgenomic mRNA transcripts, all with an identical 5\u00a2 non-translated leader sequence of 72\u00b177 nucleotides and 3\u00a2 co-terminal polyadenylated ends. The subgenomic mRNA transcription of MHV utilizes a unique discontinuous mechanism in which the leader sequence, often derived from a different molecule, is fused to RNAs at the intergenic (IG) sites (i.e. transcription initiation site) to generate subgenomic mRNAs (Jeong and Makino, 1994; Liao and Lai, 1994; Zhang et al., 1994) . The exact mechanism of how these mRNAs are made is still controversial. However, it has been shown that the process of discontinuous RNA transcription is regulated by several viral RNA elements, including the cis-and trans-acting leader RNA Zhang et al., 1994) , IG sequence (Makino et al., 1991) and 3\u00a2-end untranslated sequence (Lin et al., 1996) . There is considerable biochemical evidence suggesting possible direct or indirect interactions between the various RNA regulatory elements. hnRNP A1 binds MHV negative (\u00b1)-strand leader and IG sequences (Furuya and Lai, 1993; Li et al., 1997) . Site-directed mutagenesis of the IG sequences demonstrated that the extent of binding of hnRNP A1 to the IG sequences correlated with the ef\u00aeciency of transcription from the IG site (Zhang and Lai, 1995; Li et al., 1997) . Immunostaining of hnRNP A1 showed that hnRNP A1 relocated to the cytoplasm of MHV-infected cells, where viral RNA synthesis occurs (Li et al., 1997) . hnRNP A1 also mediates the formation of a ribonucleoprotein complex containing the MHV (\u00b1)-strand leader and IG sequences . These results suggest that hnRNP A1 may serve as a protein mediator for distant RNA regions to interact with each other. Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 regulates RNA synthesis of a cytoplasmic virus The EMBO Journal Vol. 19 No. 17 pp. 4701\u00b14711, 2000 \u00e3 European Molecular Biology Organization Many cellular proteins, including calreticulin (Singh et al., 1994) , polypyrimidine tract-binding protein (PTB) (Hellen et al., 1994; Wu-Baer et al., 1996) , La protein (Pardigon and Strauss, 1996), Sam68 (McBride et al., 1996) , poly(rC)-binding protein (Parsley et al., 1997) and nucleolin (Waggoner and Sarnow, 1998) , have been implicated to be involved in viral RNA transcription or replication. In addition to MHV, hnRNP A1 has also been reported to interact with human cytomegalovirus immediate-early gene 2 protein, which plays an important role in the regulation of virus replication (Wang et al., 1997) . Furthermore, a yeast protein related to human core RNA splicing factors, Lsm1p, has been shown to be required for the ef\u00aecient replication of brome mosaic virus RNA (Diez et al., 2000) . Recently, Reddy and colleagues demonstrated an inhibition of HIV replication by dominant-negative mutants of Sam68 (Reddy et al., 1999) . However, none of these cellular proteins has been shown experimentally to participate directly in RNA-dependent RNA synthesis.",

We showed that the mutant hnRNP A1, which was localized predominantly in the cytoplasm, exhibited dominant-negative effects on viral genomic RNA replication and subgenomic mRNA transcription. In contrast, overexpression of the wt hnRNP A1 accelerated the synthesis of all viral RNAs. Our results provide strong evidence that hnRNP A1 is directly or indirectly involved in MHV RNA synthesis in the cytoplasm and that the C-terminal part of the protein is important for its function.

This mutant lacks part of the glycine-rich domain and the M9 sequence responsible for shuttling hnRNP A1 between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Immunoblot of the whole-cell lysates with an anti-Flag antibody detected a 34 kDa protein in DBT-A1 cells and a 27 kDa protein in three independent clones of DBT-A1DC cells ( Figure 1B ), whereas no protein was cross-reactive to the anti-Flag antibody in the control cell line stably transfected with the pcDNA3.1 vector (DBT-VEC). The amounts of the Flagtagged wt and truncated hnRNP A1 were comparable in these cell lines. A chicken polyclonal antibody against hnRNP A1 detected two endogenous hnRNP A1 isoforms or hnRNP A1-related proteins in the whole-cell lysates of all of the cell lines. The bottom band (34 kDa) overlaps the Flag-tagged wt hnRNP A1 in DBT-A1 cells. There was only a slight increase in the overall amount of hnRNP A1 in DBT-A1 cells as compared with DBT-VEC cells, indicating that the exogenous hnRNP A1 constituted a small fraction of the total hnRNP A1 in the cells. In DBT-A1DC cells, an additional band of smaller size (27 kDa) corresponding to the mutant hnRNP A1 was detected. The overall expression levels of the exogenous hnRNP A1 and hnRNP A1DC were~3-fold lower than that of the endogenous hnRNP A1 in whole-cell lysates ( Figure 1B ). Similar to the endogenous hnRNP A1 protein (Pin \u00c4ol-Roma and Dreyfuss, 1992) , the Flag-tagged wt hnRNP A1 was localized almost exclusively in the nucleus ( Figure 1C ). The mutant hnRNP A1, however, was localized predominantly in the cytoplasm ( Figure 1C) , consistent with the previous \u00aending that the M9 nuclear localization signal is necessary to localize hnRNP A1 to the nucleus Weighardt et al., 1995) . Thus, hnRNP A1DC was much more abundant than the endogenous hnRNP A1 in the cytoplasm. The expression levels of the wt or mutant hnRNP A1 varied among individual cells based on immuno\u00afuorescent staining ( Figure 1C ). The growth rate ( Figure 1D ) and cell morphology (data not shown) were similar among the different cell lines.",

Virus infection was performed at a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 0.5 to detect the subtle morphological differences among the different cell lines. Syncytia appeared at~7 h post-infection (p.i.) in DBT-VEC cells and~1 h earlier in DBT-A1 cells. At both 8 and 14 h p.i., syncytia were signi\u00aecantly larger and more spread out in DBT-A1 cells than those in DBT-VEC cells ( Figure 2A ). Similar differences were observed with two additional clones of DBT-A1 cells (data not shown). In contrast, no syncytium was observed in three different clones of DBT-A1DC cells, even at 14 h p.i. At 24 h p.i., almost all DBT-A1 cells detached from the plate, but~10\u00b120% of DBT-VEC cells still remained on the plate (data not shown). Remarkably, there was no sign of syncytium formation in DBT-A1DC cells until 24 h after virus infection, when the overall morphology of the cells was similar to that of DBT-VEC cells at 7 h p.i. (data not shown). All of the DBT-A1DC cells were eventually killed at~48 h p.i., suggesting that the inhibition of viral replication was not a result of the disruption of the MHV receptor. Correspondingly, virus production from these cell lines was signi\u00aecantly different. Between 6 and 14 h p.i., virus production from DBT-A1DC cells was 100-to 1000-fold less than that from DBT-VEC and DBT-A1 cells ( Figure 2B ). DBT-A1 cells produced twice as many viruses as those from DBT-VEC cells during that time period.",

In order for hnRNP A1 to participate directly in viral transcription, it has to be recruited to the site of RNA synthesis. Although hnRNP A1 shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm in normal cells (Pin \u00c4ol-Roma and Dreyfuss, 1992) , the level of cytoplasmic hnRNP A1 is very low. We have demonstrated previously that hnRNP A1 relocates from the nucleus to the cytoplasm of MHV-infected cells (Li et al., 1997) . To determine whether the overexpressed hnRNP A1 may participate in MHV RNA synthesis, we performed immunostaining experiments using an anti-Flag antibody to localize Flag-tagged hnRNP A1. In DBT-A1 cells, a signi\u00aecant increase in the cytoplasmic level of hnRNP A1 and a corresponding decrease of nuclear hnRNP A1 were observed in virus-infected cell syncytia at 7 h p.i.",

            "text": "( Figure 3B ); these cells express the MHV nucleocapsid (N) protein in the cytoplasm ( Figure 3A ). By comparison, in the uninfected cells, which did not have N protein staining, hnRNP A1 was predominantly localized to the nucleus (arrow in Figure 3B ). In DBT-A1DC cells, very few cells were stained positive for the MHV N protein at 7 h p.i. ( Figure 3C ). Signi\u00aecantly, the viral N protein was detected only in the cells that were stained weakly or not at all for Flag-hnRNP A1 ( Figure 3D ), suggesting that the expression of a high level of hnRNP A1DC interfered with viral replication. The effects of wt and mutant hnRNP A1 on MHV protein production We further investigated the effects of the wt and mutant hnRNP A1 on the production of MHV structural and nonstructural proteins. Cytoplasmic protein was extracted from infected cell lines at different time points after infection for immunoblot analysis to detect an open reading frame (ORF) 1a product, p22 (Lu et al., 1998) and the N protein. p22 expression in DBT-VEC cells was clearly detected at 6 h p.i. and peaked at~16 h p.i. ( Figure 4A ). In DBT-A1 cells, p22 appeared at 5 h p.i. and peaked at~8 h p.i. In DBT-A1DC cells, no p22 protein was detected until 16 h p.i. Similar patterns of differences were observed for the N protein in these three cell lines. Actin levels in different cell lines remained relatively constant throughout the infection, except that, in DBT-A1 cells, actin was not detected at 16 and 24 h p.i. due to the loss of the dead cells ( Figure 4A ). These results clearly demonstrated that overexpression of the wt hnRNP A1 accelerated viral protein production, whereas expression of the mutant hnRNP A1 delayed it. We also performed immuno\u00afuorescent staining of the N protein at 7 h p.i. to further con\u00aerm the western blot results. As represented by images shown in Figure 4B , there were more DBT-A1 cells stained positive for the N protein than DBT-VEC cells. Very few cells were found to express the N protein in DBT-A1DC cells. The p22 and N proteins appeared as doublets in some of the lanes of Figure 4A , but the results varied from experiment to experiment. The N protein is known to be phosphorylated (Stohlman and Lai, 1979) . Whether p22 is post-translationally modi\u00aeed is not known. Figure 5A ). DBT-A1 cells showed a signi\u00aecantly higher level of [ 3 H]uridine incorporation, which peaked at~8 h p.i. DBT-A1DC cells did not show any detectable level of incorporation of the radioactivity. These results suggest that hnRNP A1 regulates MHV RNA synthesis. We further assessed the production of genomic and subgenomic MHV RNAs in these cell lines by northern blot analysis. The genomic and the six subgenomic RNA species were detected at 8 h p.i. in both DBT-VEC and DBT-A1 cells; there were signi\u00aecantly higher steady-state levels of all of the RNA species in DBT-A1 cells ( Figure 5B ). In contrast, no viral RNA was detected in DBT-A1DC cells at that time point. At 16 h p.i., MHV RNA levels in DBT-VEC and DBT-A1 cells decreased generally because of the loss of the dead cells, while the smaller subgenomic RNAs became detectable in DBT-A1DC cells. By 24 h p.i., most viral RNA species became detectable in DBT-A1DC cells ( Figure 5B , lane 10), while most of the DBT-A1 cells were dead (lane 9). These results con\u00aermed that the synthesis of all of the viral RNA species is accelerated by overexpression of the wt hnRNP A1 and delayed by a dominant-negative mutant of hnRNP A1.",

On the other hand, CAT activity was very low in DBT-A1DC cells. At 24 h p.i., CAT activity in DBT-A1 cells became slightly lower than that in DBT-VEC cells because of the loss of the dead DBT-A1 cells. The CAT activity in DBT-A1DC was still signi\u00aecantly lower than that in DBT-VEC or DBT-A1 cells.

To con\u00aerm this result, we further studied replication of another DI RNA during serial virus passages. DBT cells were infected with MHV-A59 and transfected with DIssE RNA derived from JHM virus (Makino and Lai, 1989) ; the virus released (P0) was passaged twice in DBT cells to generate P1 and P2 viruses. DBT cells were infected with these viruses, and cytoplasmic RNA was extracted for northern blot analysis using glyoxalated RNA for a better resolution of smaller RNAs. For DBT-A1DC cells, RNA was extracted at 36 h p.i. since viral RNA synthesis was delayed in this cell line. Cells infected with P0 viruses did not yield detectable amounts of DIssE, but contained the naturally occurring A59 DI RNA, whose replication was inhibited more strongly than the synthesis of MHV genomic and subgenomic RNAs in DBT-A1DC cells ( Figures 5B, lanes 8\u00b110 and 6B, lanes 1\u00b1 3). However, this A59 DI RNA was not detectable in cells infected with P1 and P2 viruses ( Figure 6B , lanes 4\u00b19). In contrast, DIssE appeared in cells infected with P1 viruses and further increased in cells infected with P2 viruses, indicating that the replication of the smaller DIssE may have an inhibitory effect on the replication of the larger A59 DI RNA (Jeong and Makino, 1992) . Similar to the A59 DI RNA, the replication of DIssE RNA was much more strongly inhibited than that of MHV genomic and subgenomic RNAs in DBT-A1DC cells ( Figure 6B , lanes 6 and 9). Our results thus suggest that MHV DI RNA replication is more dependent on the function of cytoplasmic hnRNP A1.",

            "text": "The effects of the expression of the wt and mutant hnRNP A1 on virus production ( Figure 2B ), viral protein synthesis ( Figure 4A ) and viral RNA synthesis ( Figure 5A ) correlated with each other. Furthermore, hnRNP A1DC caused not only a global inhibition of genomic RNA replication and subgenomic mRNA transcription, but also a preferential inhibition of at least two DI RNA species. These results suggest that the inhibition of MHV replication by the hnRNP A1 mutant was most likely a direct effect on viral RNA synthesis rather than an indirect effect on other aspects of cellular or viral functions. Since hnRNP A1 binds directly to the cis-acting MHV RNA sequences critical for MHV RNA transcription (Li et al., 1997) and replication (P. Huang and M.M.C.Lai, unpublished results) , it is most likely that hnRNP A1 may participate in the formation of the transcription/replication complex. Indeed, our data show that hnRNP A1 interacts directly or indirectly with the N protein and a gene 1 product, p22, both of which are probably associated with the viral transcription/replication complex (Compton et al., 1987; Wang and Zhang, 1999; Gibson Bost et al., 2000) . hnRNP A1 may participate directly in viral RNA synthesis in a similar role to that of transcription factors in DNAdependent RNA synthesis, e.g. by maintaining favorable RNA conformation for RNA synthesis. Alternatively, hnRNP A1 may modulate MHV RNA transcription or replication by participating in the processing, transport and controlling the stability of viral RNAs. It has been reported that RNA processing of retroviruses, human T-cell leukemia virus type 2 (Black et al., 1995) and HIV-1 (Black et al., 1996) , is altered by the binding of hnRNP A1 to the viral RNA regulatory elements. It is also possible that hnRNP A1 may participate in MHV RNA synthesis indirectly by affecting the production of other host cell proteins, which may, in turn, regulate MHV RNA synthesis. Since hnRNP A1 is a dose-dependent altern-ative splicing factor (Caceres et al., 1994) , even small changes in the intracellular level of hnRNP A1 can alter the splicing of other cellular proteins. Regardless of the mechanism, our study established the importance of cellular factors in viral RNA-dependent RNA synthesis.",

In addition, the replication of the naturally occurring A59 DI RNA and the arti\u00aecial DIssE RNA was completely abolished ( Figure 6B) . Surprisingly, the replication of MHV DI RNAs suffered a stronger inhibition by the dominantnegative mutant of hnRNP A1 than the synthesis of MHV genomic and subgenomic RNAs, suggesting that DI RNA replication may be more dependent on hnRNP A1. Although DI RNAs contain all of the cis-acting replication signals that are essential for their replication in normal cells (Kim and Makino, 1995) , the small size of DI RNA may cause it to require more hnRNP A1 to maintain a critical RNA structure. It has been shown that different DI RNAs require different cis-acting signals for RNA replication (Kim and Makino, 1995) .",

It is possible that hnRNP A1DC is not productive due to its inability to interact with other viral or cellular proteins that are involved in MHV RNA synthesis. We have found a protein of~250 kDa that binds only the wt, but not the mutant hnRNP A1 ( Figure 7D ). It remains to be shown whether this cellular protein is involved in MHV RNA synthesis.",

Since hnRNP A1 protein is involved in a variety of important cellular functions, including RNA splicing, transport, turnover and translation, it is conceivable that other redundant gene products may substitute for the function of hnRNP A1 in CB3 cells. Indeed, UV-crosslinking assays using CB3 cell extracts detected two proteins comparable to hnRNP A1 in size that could interact with the MHV negative-strand leader RNA (data not shown). These proteins may represent hnRNP A1-related proteins, since many of such hnRNPs exist in the cells (Buvoli et al., 1988; Burd et al., 1989) . Therefore, multiple cellular proteins may have the capacity to be involved in MHV RNA synthesis.",

We hypothesize that hnRNP A1 is one of the components of the MHV RNA transcription or replication complex, and the crosstalk between hnRNP A1 and another viral or cellular RNA-binding protein (designated X in Figure 8 ) is essential for MHV replication and transcription. The X protein binds to the C-terminus of hnRNP A1 and cooperates with hnRNP A1 to recruit more proteins to form the transcription or replication complex. The C-terminaldeletion mutant of hnRNP A1 loses the ability to interact with the X protein and to bring it into the initiation complex, resulting in an inhibition of MHV RNA transcription and replication. The residual replication and transcription activities of MHV RNA in the absence of functional hnRNP A1 may be due to a limited af\u00aenity of the X protein to a cis-acting signal that is only present in MHV genomic RNA (site B). On the other hand, DI RNAs may lack this cis-acting signal. When the crosstalk between the X protein and hnRNP A1 is abolished by the dominant-negative mutant of hnRNP A1, the X protein can no longer participate in the formation of the initiation complex, resulting in a complete loss of DI RNA replication.",

Approximately 10 mg of RNA were separated by electrophoresis on a 1.2% formaldehyde-containing agarose gel and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. For a better resolution of the DIssE RNA ( Figure 6B ), RNA was glyoxalated before being electrophoresed on a 1% agarose gel. An in vitro transcribed, 32 P-labeled negative-strand mRNA 7 of MHV-JHM was used as a probe to detect MHV genomic and subgenomic RNAs. For detecting DI RNA species, RNA blots were probed with an RNA representing a sequence complementary to the sequence of the 5\u00a2-untranslated region of MHV-JHM RNA, but excluding the leader sequence.",

Increasing amounts of GST (0, 0.5, 1.5, 5 ng) and GST\u00b1hnRNP A1DC proteins (0, 1, 3, 10 ng) were added to the reaction mixture to compete for the binding. (B) GST pull-down assay of the interaction between hnRNP A1 and the N protein. Escherichia coli-expressed GST fusion hnRNP A1 proteins (wt and truncation mutants) were incubated with the in vitro translated, 35 S-labeled N protein. The complexes were pulled down by glutathione beads and analyzed on a 10% polyacrylamide gel. (C) Co-immunoprecipitation of the wt and mutant hnRNP A1 with an MHV ORF 1a product, p22. Cytoplasmic protein extracts were prepared from MHV-A59-infected DBT-VEC, DBT-A1 and DBT-A1DC cells and immunoprecipitated with anti-Flag antibody-conjugated beads.
