Infecting C57BL/6 mice with Plasmodium berghei K173 strain (PbK) resulted in pulmonary oedema, capillaries congested with leukocytes and infected red blood cells (iRBCs), and leukocyte infiltration into the lungs. This new model of malaria-associated lung pathology, without any accompanying cerebral complications, allows the investigation of mechanisms leading to the lung disease. The activity of the amiloride-sensitive epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) in alveolar epithelial cells is decreased by several respiratory tract pathogens and this is suggested to contribute to pulmonary oedema. We show that PbK, a pathogen that remains in the circulation, also decreased the activity and expression of ENaC, suggesting that infectious agents can have indirect effects on ENaC activity in lung epithelial cells. The reduced ENaC activity may contribute to the pulmonary oedema induced by PbK malaria.",

Most cases of severe malaria are caused by Plasmodium falciparum infection, although ARDS occasionally occurs during Plasmodium vivax infection (reviewed in Tan et al., 2008) . Cerebral malaria, malaria-associated ARDS and severe anaemia can occur simultaneously, but many patients do not develop all three of the complications or may manifest them at different times during infection. ARDS may occur at the time of presentation (Charoenpan et al., 1990) or after the commencement of treatment when the parasitaemia is falling (Brooks et al., 1968 ).",

Animal models provide a useful tool for studying pathogenesis and the experimental cerebral malaria (ECM) model of Plasmodium berghei ANKA strain (PbA) infection has been used for many years to provide insights into human cerebral malaria (reviewed in de Souza et al., 2010) . Infection of susceptible mouse strains with PbA results in pulmonary oedema (Senaldi et al., 1994; Chang et al., 2001; Schofield et al., 2002; Lovegrove et al., 2008) , but the development 0020-7519/$36.00 \u00d3 2010 Published by Elsevier Ltd. on behalf of Australian Society for Parasitology Inc. doi:10.1016/j.ijpara.2010.07.013 and rapid progression of cerebral malaria in these mice makes it difficult to study mechanisms leading to lung complications. This has been circumvented by using an inbred strain of mice, DBA/2, which is resistant to ECM but susceptible to lung complications (Epiphanio et al., 2010) . In addition, infection of C57BL/6 mice with P. berghei NK65 strain produced pathology resembling malaria-associated ARDS in humans but without any cerebral symptoms (Van den Steen et al., 2010) . In this study we describe a model of malaria-associated lung pathology with a comparatively mild disease phenotype. Mice infected with P. berghei K173 strain (PbK) develop pulmonary oedema associated with an inflammatory interstitial infiltrate, in the absence of signs of cerebral malaria. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that the activity of amiloride-sensitive epithelial sodium channels (ENaC) decreases during infection and this may contribute to the development of oedema.",

Rabbit anti-ENaC antibody (courtesy of S. Townley, Institute of Medical and Veterinary Science, South Australia) was used for the detection of b-ENaC in the mouse lung at a dilution of 1:5000 in TNB blocking buffer for 30 min. After washing, secondary detection used a biotinylated anti-rabbit antibody with the EnVision detection system (DAKO). Staining was visualised by incubating the sections in 3,3 0 -diaminobenzidine and then counterstaining the sections with haematoxylin. The sections were then dehydrated and coverslipped.

The AnalySIS Five program (Olympus) was used to designate an area around the epithelial cells of the bronchiole. A second area was defined within the lumen. The signal corresponding to the wavelength of the brown staining was measured and converted into a grey scale. The intensity of these signals was used to calculate the pixels in each square micron. The intensity of the second defined area was subtracted from the first area to determine the expression within the cells. The values obtained from each bronchiole were averaged over the section.",

Alveolar fluid is reabsorbed across the epithelium by the resulting osmotic gradient generated by Na + absorption (Matalon et al., 1991) . ENaC is formed from three subunit proteins, a-, b-and c-ENaC, and levels of ENaC expression have been found to correlate with Na + and fluid reabsorption in the lung (Li and Folkesson, 2006) . Expression of the ENaC subunits in the lung was measured by qRT-PCR. We found that PbK infection did not significantly alter expression of the ENaC subunit mRNAs (Table 1) . We used quantitative immunohistochemistry to measure expression of the b subunit protein of ENaC in the epithelium of the bronchioles ( Fig. 4A and B) . Expression of b-ENaC was significantly decreased in the lung epithelia of PbK-infected mice at day 10 p.i. to approximately two-thirds of the level observed in uninfected mice (Fig. 4C) . To investigate an effect of PbK infection on Na + transport in the respiratory epithelium, we determined the amiloride-sensitive current, which represents activity of ENaC, in isolated mouse trachea. Tracheas dissected from uninfected and infected mice were mounted in a modified Ussing chamber and the equivalent short-circuit current was measured under open-circuit conditions. We found that the amiloride-sensitive equivalent short-circuit current of the trachea of PbK-infected mice, 5.3 \u00b1 3.3 lA/cm 2 , was significantly lower that that of the uninfected mice, 16.9 \u00b1 3.6 lA/cm 2 (Fig. 4D) .",

Following infection, mice progressively accumulated leukocytes, including neutrophils and CD8 + T cells, in the interstitial spaces of their lungs and the alveolar septa became swollen. Fibrinogen leakage into the interstitium suggests increased permeability of the endothelium to plasma proteins. The fluid content of the lung also increased significantly as the mice developed pulmonary oedema. These features of PbK infection in mice are also found in humans with malaria-associated ARDS (Brooks et al., 1968) as well as mouse models of malaria-associated ARDS (Epiphanio et al., 2010; Van den Steen et al., 2010) .",

            "text": "PbK infection resulted in large numbers of myeloid cells (monocytes and neutrophils) being recruited to the lungs and transmigrating across the endothelium. Mediators released by neutrophils, such as proteases and oxidants, have the potential to damage host cells as well as control infections. Mice deficient in chemoattractants for neutrophils have reduced lung injury and neutrophil sequestration in a non-malarial ARDS model (Belperio et al., 2002) . Additional cell types sequestered in the lungs during PbK infection include CD4 + and CD8 + T cells. Cytotoxic CD8 + T cells localise to the brain during PbA infection (Belnoue et al., 2002) and damage the brain endothelium in a perforin-dependent manner (Potter et al., 2006) . These cells are also required for PbA-induced respiratory distress (Chang et al., 2001) . Furthermore, in PbNK65 infection, treatment with dexamethasone decreases numbers of CD8 + T cells, CD4 + T cells and macrophages in the lung and prevents disease progression, as measured by changes in lung weight, suggesting that infiltrating cells may play a pathogenic role in malaria-associated lung pathology (Van den Steen et al., 2010) . Other features of ARDS include an exudate of proteinaceous fluid and leukocytes within the alveoli and hyaline-membrane formation. These signs are observed in autopsies of patients with malaria-associated lung pathology (Brooks et al., 1968 ) and in mouse models of malaria-associated ARDS (Epiphanio et al., 2010; Van den Steen et al., 2010) . In contrast, damage or dysfunction of the alveolar epithelial layer during PbK infection appears minimal as the fluid in the alveoli does not significantly increase in protein content and the alveolar spaces are mostly free of leukocytes. In addition, there is no evidence of intra-alveolar haemorrhage and hyaline-membrane formation. During infection with PbNK65 the dry weight of the lung increases approximately 100% (Van den Steen et al., 2010) compared with approximately 30% in PbK infection. This difference is likely due to the proteinaceous fluid and cells infiltrating the alveolar spaces observed in the PbNK65 model. This suggests that whilst there is disruption or damage to the endothelium in the PbK model, there is little damage to the alveolar epithelium. Therefore, the model described here does not represent a model of malaria-associated ARDS but a milder form of lung injury, similar to that seen in many human malaria infections (Anstey et al., 2002 (Anstey et al., , 2007 . The amiloride-sensitive current due to epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) activity was measured in control and PHZ-treated mice (C). Data are expressed as mean \u00b1 S.E.M., n = 7-9. ns Denotes not statistically significant (P < 0.05). The presence of circulating antigen and immune mediators suggests that the pathophysiology of malaria infection has parallels to sepsis (Clark and Cowden, 2003) . One of the most common causes of acute lung injury and ARDS is sepsis and this is often modelled in rodents by administration of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS). An ultrastructural study comparing lung pathology in mice inoculated with LPS either directly into their respiratory tract or into their circulation revealed different pathological features (Menezes et al., 2005) . All of the LPS-treated mice showed increased tissue cellularity and collapse of the alveoli spaces; however, the mice with LPS instilled directly into their respiratory tract also showed greater infiltration of neutrophils into the alveoli and damage to the epithelial layer. Thus the PbK model of malaria-associated lung pathology has greater similarity to models where lung injury is induced by systemic injection of LPS to mimic sepsis. The pathogenesis of PbK-associated lung pathology likely begins with damage to the endothelium, by this sepsis-like process, allowing proteins to enter the interstitium. These could include malaria antigens, as well as plasma proteins. Subsequently leukocytes enter the interstitium in response to the abnormal presence of these proteins. An increase in interstitial pressure can lead to fluid being forced into the alveolar spaces.",

These observations include coughing, chest crackles and impairments in gas transfer (Anstey et al., 2002 (Anstey et al., , 2007 . In P. vivax infection, gas transfer deteriorated and phagocytic activity increased after the initiation of anti-malaria treatment and this effect was postulated to be due to an increased inflammatory response to killed parasites (Anstey et al., 2002 (Anstey et al., , 2007 .

Some of these pathogens have been shown to reduce expression of the ENaC subunit protein (Hickman-Davis et al., 2006; Chen et al., 2009; Ji et al., 2009) . We found that PbK infection reduced ENaC activity and expression in the lung, which is likely to contribute to the formation or maintenance of pulmonary oedema by inhibiting fluid re-uptake from the alveolar space. The mechanisms by which pathogens affect ENaC expression and activity are still being elucidated; however, it is probable that the processes are different in a malaria infection compared with the respiratory tract infections. Infectious agents that are transmitted through the respiratory tract can interact directly with the alveolar cell. This direct effect of pathogens on ENaC activity in alveolar cells has been demonstrated in vitro by incubating infectious agents with alveolar epithelial cell lines (Chen et al., 2009; Ji et al., 2009) . In contrast, PbK is a blood-borne infection and even when the vessels become congested and leaky, the iRBCs remain in the circulation and do not extravasate into the interstitium or alveoli space. Therefore, the changes in ENaC activity cannot be due to direct interactions of the malaria parasite or iRBC with alveolar cells.",

            "text": "Hypoxia has been shown to lead to reduced ENac activity (Vivona et al., 2001) . However, modulation of ENaC activity was not simply due to hypoxia resulting from infection-associated anaemia, as induction of comparable levels of anaemia by administration of PHZ failed to modulate ENaC activity (Fig. 5) . Another mechanism for inhibition of ENaC activity is signalling through purinergic receptors. ATP and UTP activate the P2Y2 receptor resulting in phospholipase-C dependent inhibition of ENaC activity (Boncoeur et al., 2010) . The cytokines TNF, transforming growth factor (TGF)b and IL1b were shown to decrease expression and activity of ENaC in alveolar epithelial cells (Frank et al., 2003; Dagenais et al., 2004; Roux et al., 2005) . However the role of TNF in alveolar fluid clearance (AFC) is complex, as the cytokine was associated with increased amiloride-sensitive AFC in a model of bacterial pneumonia (Rezaiguia et al., 1997) . Direct instillation of TNF into the respiratory tract also leads to increased AFC (Fukuda et al., 2001) . The effects of TNF on AFC and ENaC activity might depend on the concentration reached, interactions with other cell types and temporal expression. Elevated levels of TNF are found in the circulation during human (Perkins et al., 2000) and rodent (Grau et al., 1987) malaria and are associated with severity of disease. Circulating TGFb levels are inversely related to severity of disease in human (Perkins et al., 2000) and rodent (Omer and Riley, 1998) malaria. As the iRBCs remain within the circulation, it is likely that soluble molecules, such as cytokines or parasite-secreted factors, are interacting with the alveolar cells to reduce ENaC activity.",

            "text": "Lung pathology in malaria has been a neglected area in the study of malaria complications. The recent development of three rodent models of malaria-associated lung pathology provides useful tools to study pathogenesis. As they differ in the severity of pathology, comparisons might be useful to investigate the events and factors that determine whether a lung injury progresses to ARDS. The PbK and PbNK65 models use C57BL/6 mice, a genetic background that is common for strains of gene knockout mice, so these models might be useful in identifying molecules involved in pathogenesis. The PbNK65 model provides a severe disease model to look at intervention in malaria-associated ARDS, and dexamethasone has been found to be therapeutic in this system (Van den Steen et al., 2010) . PbA infection of DBA/2 mice has revealed that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels are associated with development of the severe lung pathology (Epiphanio et al., 2010 ). The PbK model may be useful for investigating the interactions of anti-malarial drugs with lung pathology. Here, to our knowledge for the first time, we use the model to show that a pathogen in the bloodstream can regulate ENaC activity in the epithelial cell, potentially contributing to pulmonary oedema formation. This suggests that other agents and inflammatory re-sponses in the circulation, such as sepsis, also have the potential to modulate ENaC activity.",
