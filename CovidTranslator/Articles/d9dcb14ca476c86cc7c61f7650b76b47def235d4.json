To date, the clinical characteristics of COVID-19-infected cancer patients are largely unknown. Patients and methods\uff1a \uff1a \uff1a \uff1aIn this retrospective cohort study, we included cancer patients with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 from three designated hospitals in Wuhan, China. The clinical data were collected from medical records from Jan 13, 2020, to Feb 26, 2020. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to assess the risk factors associated with severe events defined as a condition requiring admission to an intensive care unit, the use of mechanical ventilation, or death. Results: 28 COVID-19-infected cancer patients were included; 17 (60.7%) patients were male. Median age was 65.0 years (IQR:56.0-70.0). Lung cancer was the most frequent cancer type (7, 25.0%). 8 (28.6%) patients were suspected to be from hospital-associated transmission. The following clinical features were shown in our cohort: fever (23, 82.1%), dry cough (22, 81%) and dyspnoea (14, 50.0%), along with lymphopaenia (23, 82.1%), high level of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (23, 82.1%), anaemia (21, 75.0%) and hypoproteinaemia (25, 89.3%). The common chest CT findings were ground-glass opacity (21, 75.0%) and patchy consolidation (13, 46.3%). 15 (53.6%) patients had severe events and mortality was 28.6%. If the last anti-tumour treatment was within 14 days, it significantly increased the risk of developing severe events (HR=4.079, 95%CI 1.086-15.322, P=0.037). Furthermore, patchy consolidation on CT on admission was associated with a higher risk for developing severe events (HR=5.438, 95%CI",

Earlier cases were linked to a large seafood and live animal market for selling different wild animal species 3 . The causative agent of the pneumonia was identified as a novel coronavirus and named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) 2 . Genetic analysis of the full-length genome sequences revealed SARS-CoV-2 to be most closely related to a known bat coronavirus termed BatCoV RaTG13, indicating bats as the likely origin 3 . This suggested the high possibility of animal-to-human transmission. Afterwards, human-to-human transmission was confirmed by a cluster of 15 health-care workers, who were all infected by one patient with the novel coronavirus infection 4 Prior to December 2019, 6 coronaviruses strains were known to infect humans, including two highly pathogenic strains, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, causing the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and four other strains causing respiratory illnesses ranging from a self-resolving cold to severe pneumonia 5 anti-tumour treatments as usual in epidemic areas. Therefore, we aimed to explore these issues by conducting an urgent retrospective case study on critical COVID-19-infected cancer patients. ",

They found that ground-glass opacity appeared first, even before symptom onset, then increased during the following two weeks, and decreasing gradually in the third week. Patchy consolidation usually appeared in first to second weeks after symptom onset. It can rapidly evolve into bilateral extensive consolidation, with a white lung appearance on CT, leading to poor prognosis. Therefore, CT on admission showing patchy consolidation may imply that admission time of these cases would be at least 1 to 2 weeks after the onset of illness. The delayed admission time for cancer patients may be a reasonable explanation for the poor outcome of some cases in our cohort.",

Usage of steroids has been considered to slow virus clearance due to its immunosuppressive effect, which was often associated with an increased risk of opportunistic infections, especially in patients who required mechanical ventilation.

Cancer patients present with similar clinical features to general population, except for anaemia and hypoproteinaemia, which were frequently found in this cohort. Anaemia and hypoproteinaemia were considered to be a major consequence of nutritional deterioration in cancer patients, which may adversely affect immunocompetence and increase the susceptibility to respiratory pathogens. In our cohort, the symptom of dyspnoea was found to occur much earlier from the onset of COVID-19 infection in lung cancer patients as compared to the days). Patients with lung cancer, with worse baseline lung function and endurance, are more likely to develop more severe anoxia and progress more rapidly with COVID-19.

Therefore, healthcare facilities need to re-emphasize the importance of basic infection control measures to combat the spread of contagious pathogen via respiratory droplets. Some cancer patients are also shown to have acquired COVID-19 infection on receiving anti-tumour treatment during hospitalization. However, delaying anti-tumour treatment cannot be recommended as a reasonable choice to reduce the infection risk in the ongoing pandemic. Cancer patients should receive anti-tumour treatment in the setting of vigorous screening for COVID-19, including chest CT scan and nucleic acid testing, and the same should be extended to their companions. Treatment strategies likely to cause immunosuppression should be avoided or have dosages decreased, and patients who are generally in poor condition should not receive such treatments. In addition, at least 7 days prior to anti-tumour treatment, cancer patients should stay in the observation ward and in isolation from other patients. Stronger personal protection, including protection mechanisms for their families should be made for cancer patients.",
