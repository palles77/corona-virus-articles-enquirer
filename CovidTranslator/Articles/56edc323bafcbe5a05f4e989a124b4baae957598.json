            "text": "Two types of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) have been reported, the European type (EU PRRSV) and the North American type (US PRRSV). We developed a dual enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the simultaneous detection and differentiation of serum antibodies directed against either of the two PRRSV types. This tandem PRRS ELISA is based on affinity-purified recombinant nucleocapsid protein expressed in Escherichia coli. Sensitivity and specificity were assessed by using the IDEXX HerdChek PRRS ELISA and the indirect immunofluorescence assay as reference tests. A total of 1,571 sera originating from the United States, Europe, and two PRRS-free countries, i.e., Switzerland and New Zealand, were used for validation of the tandem PRRS ELISA. The new test performed at least as well as the reference tests in regard to sensitivity (0.94 for the US PRRS ELISA and 0.93 for the EU PRRS ELISA) and specificity (0.96 for the US PRRS ELISA and 0.99 for the EU PRRS ELISA). Positive sera were correctly differentiated in 582 of 591 cases, indicating a high differentiation capability of this dual ELISA. The robustness and repeatability of the test were assessed and found to be appropriate for diagnostic applications. Taken together, the data indicate that the tandem PRRS ELISA described here is the first differentiation ELISA for PRRSV serology based on recombinant antigen. It is convenient with respect to antigen production, and it is reliable, economical, and highly sensitive and specific. Thus, it is considered to be a powerful tool for routine diagnostics, epidemiological surveys, and outbreak investigations.",

            "text": "Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) causes major economic losses in the pig industry worldwide. It was first reported in 1987 in the United States, where animals of affected herds showed reproductive failure and respiratory distress. In 1990 and 1991 a similar disease emerged in Europe and spread very quickly through almost the whole continent (1) . The viral etiology of PRRS was first shown in The Netherlands in 1991 by Wensvoort and coworkers (29) , who isolated Lelystad virus (LV), which is considered the prototype of the European PRRS virus (EU PRRSV). In 1992 the first isolate of PRRSV was identified in the United States and designated ATCC VR-2332 (3) . This virus is referred to as the prototype of North American PRRSV (US PRRSV). During the early 1990s it was supposed that each of the two virus types occurred only in the region from where it originated, namely, either Europe or the United States. This changed in 1996, when the use of a live attenuated US PRRSV-based vaccine was registered in several European countries. In 1997 Danish researchers reported the spread of vaccine virus from vaccinated to PRRS-free herds, which was accompanied by occasional clinical disease (4) . To date, both PRRSV types can be found in European swine herds as a result of either infection, vaccination, or both. In addition, EU PRRSV was recently reported to circulate in North American swine herds (11) , although in the United States only vaccines derived from US PRRSV are allowed. Interestingly, until now there has been no evidence for PRRSV infections in Switzerland (5) , and therefore, Switzerland is considered free from PRRS. To maintain this status, reliable tools for monitoring, import controls, outbreak investigations, and follow-up studies are necessary. Furthermore, for epidemiological reasons it is highly desirable to differentiate antibodies against EU and US PRRSVs in any case of seropositivity.",

            "text": "Several serological tests for routine diagnostics of PRRS have been developed. The immunoperoxidase monolayer assay (IPMA) (28) and the indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) (31) are based on the specific binding of antibodies to viral antigens present in infected porcine alveolar macrophages or MA104-derived cells. Additional tests that have been described represent either indirect (2, 7, 27) or blocking (24) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) for which antigen derived from infectious virus is used. Further development of the blocking ELISA to permit differentiation of antibodies against the two types of PRRSV has also been reported (25) . The common disadvantage of these tests is the need to propagate PRRSV in cell culture, which is time-consuming and expensive. Furthermore, handling of infectious virus in PRRSfree countries such as Switzerland is restricted to containment facilities. These drawbacks can be overcome by using recombinant antigen. Thus, in 1997 we reported an indirect ELISA for the detection of antibodies against EU PRRSV which is based on viral N-protein expressed in insect cells (10) . The performance of this test, which has a sensitivity of 1 and a specificity of 0.96, was superior to that of any other test available at that time. However, it has three limitations: (i) it is not appropriate for the detection of antibodies against US PRRSV, as it is based on antigen derived from EU PRRSV only; (ii) the recombinant N-protein is unstable upon longterm storage; and (iii) high background reactivity frequently is observed, particularly with field sera derived from sows. ELISAs based on bacterially expressed recombinant N-protein of US PRRSV have been developed recently (9, 30) . Also, an indirect ELISA (Checkit-PRRS) including recombinant N-protein of both EU and US PRRSVs is commercially available (Dr. Bommeli AG, Bern, Switzerland). It is considered to allow detection of antibodies against both types of PRRSV. This is also the case for the HerdChek PRRS antibody ELISA (IDEXX, Westbrook, Maine), which presumably contains one or more antigens specific for both virus types. However, these two commercial tests do not allow discrimination between US and EU PRRSV-derived antibodies.",

Bacterial cells were disrupted by sonication, and both the soluble and insoluble fractions were analyzed for the content of native recombinant N-protein. For both rUS-N-protein and rEU-N-protein, approximately 90% of the protein was found in the insoluble fraction, whereas only about 10% was soluble (data not shown). By lysing the cells with guanidine hydrochloride before sonication, a high con- Affinity purification of recombinant protein on nickel-chelate Sepharose was carried out under either native or denaturing conditions in the presence of 6 M guanidine hydrochloride. As shown in Fig. 2 , for purification of denatured protein, a well-defined peak was obtained shortly after the onset of the elution gradient for both types of Nprotein ( Fig. 2B and C) . For mock antigen, a peak was observed at the same position, but the amount of protein reflected by the area under the curve was approximately three times smaller ( Fig. 2A) . Bacterial lysates as well as peak fractions obtained after elution were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 3A for both PRRSV types, SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie blue staining revealed the presence of a protein slightly below 21 kDa in size. This is in good agreement with the calculated molecular mass of approximately 17 kDa for both N-proteins. Corresponding bands were not visible for mock antigen, which is expected to be a polypeptide of approximately 3.5 kDa and thus not in the resolution range of the 15% polyacrylamide gel used. Western blot analysis with pig serum US364/d42 (Fig. 3B ) or EU8787/ d42 (Fig. 3C) or monoclonal anti-His antibody (data not shown) proved the identity of the respective protein bands. Additional proteins of approximately 38 and 35 kDa were detected by the pig sera in bacterial lysates but not in the eluate. Interestingly, US364/d42 detected not only the homologous antigen rUS-N-protein (Fig. 3B, lanes 3 and 4) but also the heterologous rEU-N-protein (Fig. 3B, lanes 5 and 6) .

Peak fractions of the eluates were pooled and stored at 4\u00b0C in elution buffer. Based on photometric measurement of protein concentrations in the eluted fractions, it was calculated that at least 640 g of purified recombinant N-protein could be obtained per ml of bacterial culture.

Comparison of IPMA-IFA and the IDEXX ELISA with the tandem PRRS ELISA as a reference resulted in sensitivities of at least 0.93 for both tests, but the specificities, particularly that of the IPMA-IFA, were low (0.50 and 0.64).",

Histidine-tagged recombinant N-protein containing additional vector-derived amino acid res-idues ( Fig. 1) at both ends was expressed very efficiently. Isolation of soluble protein under nondenaturing conditions was possible, but the yields obtained under denaturing conditions were about 10 times higher. Native as well as denatured protein was affinity purified (Fig. 2) , and the suitability for detection and differentiation of PRRSV antibodies was evaluated. Both forms worked similarly well for detection, but differentiation was more specific with denatured proteins. Four distinct antigenic sites (A, B, C, and D) have been identified for Nprotein of PRRSV (19) . Antigenic sites A to C are predicted to represent linear epitopes, whereas site D is thought to be conformation dependent. As the amino acid compositions of epitopes B and D are identical for the two virus types, these sites can be considered to be responsible for the observed cross-reactivity. Hence, the conformational epitope D likely accounts for the higher cross-reactivity observed when native N-protein is used. In contrast, epitopes A and C differ between the two types and thus could be responsible for type-specific reactivity of the antibodies. The observed reactivity of serum US364/d42 with rEU-N-protein in Western blot analysis ( Fig.  3) but not in the ELISA could be due to renaturation of the D epitope during transfer of the protein from the gel to the nitrocellulose membrane. Antigen purified and stored under denaturing conditions also resulted in long-term stability of the N-protein, in contrast to native antigen, which rapidly lost its activity after purification (data not shown).",

Based on the selected cutoff value of 5% reactivity, both ELISAs showed a sensitivity and specificity of higher than 0.92. These values are considered to be excellent (13) for a diagnostic test. As shown in Fig. 6 , calculation of r values for double-positive samples allowed a clear differentiation of the US PRRSVpositive sera from the EU PRRSV-positive sera. Only one of the American sera and six of the European sera reacted more strongly with the heterologous antigen than with the homologous antigen. Interestingly, all of the European sera which reacted more strongly with the heterologous antigen (r value of \u03fe0) originated from the United Kingdom and were collected in 1995. At that time, the US PRRSV-based live attenuated vaccine was already widely used in North America, whereas in the European Union it was admitted only in 1996. Whether the nonconsistent result is due to a particular virus strain with unexpected antigenic properties or to illegal use of PRRSV vaccine from the United States remains an open question. We also identified four sera originating from Germany (1991) which were considered positive based on the IDEXX ELISA but which reacted only in the US ELISA, although very weakly. Again, the occurrence of virus strains for which the respective antibodies are not differentiated in the tandem PRRS ELISA cannot be excluded, although the weak reactivity argues rather for an unspecific reaction. It is assumed that US PRRSV was not present in Germany in the early 1990s, although it has occasionally been speculated that US PRRSV has been intro- . False-negative results could also be due to the fact that the tandem PRRS ELISA is based on a single viral structural protein as the antigen, whereas IPMA-IFA and allegedly also the IDEXX ELISA apply complete virus as the antigen. Some animals may mainly produce antibodies to other viral proteins or to the conformational antigenic site D and, consequently, would not be recognized in the tandem PRRS ELISA. Finally, the possibility that false-negative results are due to PRRSV strains with N-proteins differing in their antigenic structure from those used here cannot be excluded. When sera experimentally raised against eight different strains of US PRRSV were examined, differences in the ability to detect PRRSV antibodies between the tandem PRRS ELISA and the two reference tests were observed only for the US PRRSV strain VR-2332 (data not shown). The route of virus inoculation used in this experiment is unknown, but we assume that it was by injection. In contrast, sera from pig US364, which was infected oronasally with the same vaccine strain, scored positive as early as day 14 in both the tandem PRRS and the IDEXX ELISA (Fig. 7) . Possibly, the route of inoculation modulates the immune response in a way such that early antibodies are not detected by the tandem PRRS ELISA in some cases. Based on the two reference tests used, false-positive results occurred in the tandem ELISA at frequencies of 4.8% of the sera tested in the US ELISA and 3.3% of the sera tested in the EU ELISA. Seven these sera originated from European PRRSV-positive herds and therefore are very likely to be positive. The negative result in the reference tests would then presumably be due to lower sensitivity of these tests. However, the remaining sera reacting only in the tandem ELISA are derived from New Zealand and Switzerland, where PRRSV has never been reported so far. Therefore, the reactivity observed in these cases is likely to be unspecific.",

The IPMA-IFA was highly sensitive but had a very poor specificity. This was even more pronounced when IDEXX ELISA and IPMA-IFA were compared to the US and EU ELISAs as reference tests. Interestingly, in this setup the IDEXX ELISA showed a very poor specificity, particularly in detection of European sera. Finally, comparison of the tandem PRRS ELISA with the IDEXX ELISA using the IPMA-IFA as a reference resulted in almost equal performance concerning sensitivity but clearly superior specificity of the EU ELISA. The high sensitivity of the tandem ELISA is additionally supported by the results obtained for the sera from experimentally infected pigs EU8787 and US364 (Fig. 7) . The tandem PRRS ELISA detected antibodies against EU PRRSV significantly earlier after infection than did both reference tests.",
