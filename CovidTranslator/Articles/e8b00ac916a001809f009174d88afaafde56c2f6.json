In this Communication, we first analyzed two recent studies that concluded that snakes are the intermediate hosts of 2019-nCoV and that the 2019-nCoV spike protein insertions share a unique similarity to HIV-1. However, the reimplementation of the analyses, built on larger scale data sets using state-of-theart bioinformatics methods and databases, presents clear evidence that rebuts these conclusions. Next, using metagenomic samples from Manis javanica, we assembled a draft genome of the 2019-nCoV-like coronavirus, which shows 73% coverage and 91% sequence identity to the 2019-nCoV genome. In particular, the alignments of the spike surface glycoprotein receptor binding domain revealed four times more variations in the bat coronavirus RaTG13 than in the Manis coronavirus compared with 2019-nCoV, suggesting the pangolin as a missing link in the transmission of 2019-nCoV from bats to human.",

The rapid transmission across country borders and the large number of confirmed cases prompted the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare COVID-19 as a global pandemic on March 11, 2020. As of March 23, there are at least 332 930 and 14 510 patients who have been diagnosed with and have died of COVID-19 worldwide, respectively. Among the affected countries, China has the largest population of confirmed cases (81 610) and the second highest death toll (3276). Meanwhile, Europe and North America have also been hit hard: 59 138 and 31 573 cases were confirmed in Italy and the United States, which are the nations with the highest number of 2019-nCoV infected patients in their respective continents, with the number of deaths in Italy (5476) surpassing that of China. Understanding the viral infection mechanisms and animal hosts is of high urgency for the control and treatment of the 2019-nCoV virus. Whereas it is now commonly recognized that bats such as Rhinolophus aff inis may serve as the natural reservoir of 2019-nCoV, 3 it is still unclear which animal served as the intermediate host that brought the bat coronavirus to human hosts. Whereas multiple studies suggest the Malayan pangolin (Manis javanica) as another host, 4\u22126 some studies have proposed that the pangolin may be a natural host rather than an intermediate host. 7, 8 During 2019-nCoV's infection of host cells, a critical virion component is the spike surface glycoprotein, also known as the S protein. Spike proteins constitute the outermost component in a coronavirus virion particle and are responsible for the recognition of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a transmembrane receptor on mammalian hosts that is utilized by the coronavirus to enter the host cells. 3, 9 Therefore, the spike protein largely determines the host specificity and infectivity of a coronavirus.",

To further examine the animal hosts of the 2019-nCoV spread, we next assembled the draft genome of a highly related coronavirus using metagenomic samples from Manis javanica.

This database was therefore much more recent than the Codon Usage Database, 20 which was last We noted that these fragments are not bona f ide \"insertions\"; in fact, at least three out of the four fragments are also shared with bat coronavirus RaTG13 spike glycoprotein (NCBI accession: QHR63300.1), as shown in Table 1 . Nevertheless, we still refer to these fragments as \"insertions\" in this Communication for consistency with the original report. The receptor binding domain of the spike is marked by the solid box, which corresponds to residue positions 323\u2212545 in the above alignment. A pair of arrows immediately following IS4 indicates the protease cleavage site by which spike proteins are cut into S1 and S2 isoforms. updated in 2007, that was used in the previous research. 11 To obtain the codon usage of coronaviruses, we imported the GenBank annotations of the three coronavirus genomes to SnapGene (GSL Biotech) to export the codon usage In a recent manuscript entitled \"Uncanny Similarity of Unique Inserts in the 2019-nCoV Spike Protein to HIV-1 gp120 and Gag\", 10 Pradhan et al. presented a discovery of four novel insertions unique to 2019-nCoV spike protein ( Figure 1 ). They further concluded that these four insertions are part of the receptor binding site of 2019-nCoV and that these insertions shared \"uncanny similarity\" to human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) proteins but not to other coronaviruses. These claims resulted in considerable public panic and controversy in the community, 12 even after the manuscript was withdrawn. To investigate whether the conclusions by Pradhan et al. are scientifically precise, we reanalyzed the structural location and sequence homology of the four spike protein insertions discussed therein. Because the full-length structure of the spike protein in 2019-nCoV was not available at the beginning of this study, we used C-I-TASSER 15 to model its tertiary structure as part of our If there are multiple redundant hits for the same gene from different strains of the same species removed, then only one hit is shown. The sequence identity is calculated as the number of identical residues divided by the query length. Only the sequence portion aligned to the query is shown. In this table, we also list the closest BLAST hit from bat coronavirus RaTG13, which is known to be closely related to 2019-nCoV. 3 . efforts in the full genome structure and function analyses of 2019-nCoV, which are available at https://zhanglab.ccmb.med. umich.edu/C-I-TASSER/2019-nCoV/. The 2019-nCoV spike model was then assembled with the human ACE2 structure (PDB ID: 6ACJ) 22 by DEMO 18 to form a spike\u2212ACE2 complex. In Figure 2A , we present a cartoon superposition of the C-I-TASSER model with a recently solved spike structure, 23 where the C-I-TASSER model shares a high structure similarity, with a TM score of 0.95, 24, 25 to the cryo-EM structure. Because the experimental structure covers only 75% of the residues in the full-length sequence, with several important residues on the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein missing, our following analysis will mainly be built on the C-I-TASSER reconstructed full-length model. We note that C-I-TASSER, also known as \"Zhang-Server\", is the top ranked automated server for protein structure prediction in the Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction round 13 (CASP13) challenge (http://www.predictioncenter.org/casp13/zscores_final. cgi?model_type=best&gr_type=server_only) among all 39 servers from the community.

For IS4, although the local sequence alignment by BLAST did not hit the bat coronavirus in Table 1 , it has a close evolutionary relation to the bat coronavirus in the MSA.

Among these vertebrates, snakes have the smallest codon usage difference (squared Euclidean distance of RSCU) from 2019-nCoV and were therefore proposed by Ji This conclusion is, however, controversial among virologists due to the lack of prior biological evidence that zoonotic coronavirus can infect animals other than mammals and birds. 35 Moreover, recent studies showed preliminary evidence that pangolins are the likely hosts of 2019-nCoV-like coronaviruses, 4\u22126 further invalidating Ji et al.'s conclusion. Whereas the conclusion of snakes being intermediate hosts has been commonly questioned by the scientific community, it is still important to carefully examine the base and reliability of the RSCU approach, which should help prevent such biased analyses from misleading the community and the general public.

These CDSs represent <2% of all protein coding genes in a typical snake genome; the genome of the king cobra (Naja hannah), for example, encodes 18 387 proteins according to UniProt (https://www.uniprot.org/proteomes/UP000018936). The limited numbers of known CDSs in Bungarus multicinctus and Naja atra mean that the RSCU statistics may not reflect the actual RSCU distribution in the whole genome. Second, the Codon Usage Database 20 used in the analysis of Ji et al. has not been updated since 2007; a reanalysis using a more recent codon usage database such as CoCoPUTs 19 is therefore needed. Third, only 8 vertebrates were analyzed in their study, whereas there are >100 000 vertebrates with at least one CDS in the NCBI GenBank database.

More importantly, the data in Figure 4 show that animals unrelated to coronavirus transmission, such as frogs and snakes, consistently have smaller RSCU distances to known hosts of all three coronaviruses. For example, the top-ranking vertebrates with the lowest RSCU distances to the three different coronaviruses are two kinds of frogs (Megophrys feae and Liophryne schlaginhaufeni), whereas another frog (Xenopus laevis) has the smallest RSCU distances among all vertebrates with sufficient sequences. Part of the reason for the failure of RSCU in intermediate host identification, as shown in Supplementary Table S1, is that different coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, that are known to utilize different intermediate hosts (Paguma larvata and Camelus dromedarius, respectively), have almost no difference in RSCU (squared RSCU distance = 0.12). These data suggest that the RSCU analysis on its own is not specific enough to discriminate coronaviruses from different vertebrate hosts. In this regard, the failure is not merely due to the use of outdated databases or the small number of species included in the original analysis but is, in fact, caused by the incorrect biological assumption that coronaviruses will evolve their RSCU to resemble that of their hosts.",

Meanwhile, the nucleotide-level search selected samples where more than one pair of sequencing reads could be mapped to the 2019-nCoV genome (NCBI accession: MN908947.3) by bowtie. Both searches consistently reported that only the lung samples (SRA accessions: SRR10168376, SRR10168377, and SRR10168378) contain 2019-nCoV-like sequences. Therefore, the sequences were assembled into nucleotide and protein contigs by MEGAHIT and Plass, respectively. The assembled nucleotide and protein sequences were then aligned by BLASTn and BLASTp to the whole genome and the spike protein of 2019-nCoV, respectively, at an E-value cutoff of <0.01. Finally, we separately merged all nucleotide and protein alignments into a single pairwise alignment between 2019-nCoV and the Manis coronavirus (Manis-CoV); when multiple Manis-CoV hits cover the same 2019-nCoV region, the hit with the highest sequence identity to 2019-nCoV is used in the merged alignment. Figure 5A presents a sketch of the draft genome for the Manis-CoV as compared with the released 2019-nCoV genome. 45 Overall, the assembled sequences cover 73% of the 2019-nCoV genome with 91% sequence identity. More importantly, the protein sequences assembled from these Manis lung samples include a partial pangolin coronavirus spike protein that is 92% identical to the 2019-nCoV spike protein ( Figure 5B ). This sequence identity is relatively high, considering that spike proteins are critical for the coronaviruses to invade into host cells and have the largest diversity in coronavirus genomes due to evolutionary pressure to adapt to receptors on different hosts. Notably, there are only 5 residue positions in the Manis coronavirus that are different from 2019-nCoV on the spike receptor binding domain compared with 19 different residue positions between 2019-nCoV and bat coronavirus RaTG13 for the same domain ( Figure 5B, black box) . These data imply that pangolins such as Manis javanica can either be the intermediate hosts of 2019-nCoV for the transmission of bat coronaviruses to humans or serve as alternative natural hosts, together with bats, to provide the genetic material for the origin of 2019-nCoV. Nevertheless, considering that Manis javanica individuals with coronavirus infections are usually in poor or even critical health condition 37 and previously known natural coronavirus hosts (such as bats) are usually asymptotic after infection, thus allowing long-term virus\u2212host coexistence and coevolution, we believe that it is more likely that Manis javanica is an intermediate host rather than a natural host.",

Indeed, within less than 1 month of the publication of the 2019-nCoV genome in January 2020, multiple bioinformatics analyses regarding 2019-nCoV have been either published or posted as preprints. Whereas such expeditious analyses provide much needed insights into the biology of the 2019-nCoV virus, there is a caution to avoid overinterpretation of the data in the absence of comprehensive benchmarks or follow-up experimental validations.",

In both cases, we found that the conclusions proposed by the original studies do not hold in the face of more comprehensive replications of these analyses. In particular, we found that the unique sequence \"inserts\" found by Pradhan et al. are, in fact, shared by multiple viruses, especially with the segments from the bat coronavirus RaTG13, revealing the close evolutionary relation to the latter species. In addition, our benchmark results showed that the data based on RSCU are not specific enough to discriminate the relation between coronaviruses and vertebrates, which contradicts the conclusion by Ji et al. regarding snakes as an immediate host of the 2019-nCoV.",

In particular, the spike protein in the assembled genome, which is critical for the virus to recognize host receptors and therefore bears a high speed of variation, shares a high sequence identity with 2019-nCoV, with only 5 residue position differences compared with 19 differences between 2019-nCoV and bat coronavirus RaTG13. These data provide evidence of the possible evolutionary relations among RaTG13, the Manis coronavirus, and 2019-nCoV.",

            "text": "Whereas the current evidence mainly points to the pangolin as the most likely intermediate host, it is possible for other animals to also serve as intermediate hosts for the following two reasons. First, coronaviruses are known to have multiple intermediate hosts. For example, SARS-CoV, of which the palm civet (Paguma larvata) is the most well-known intermediate host, is also reported to use a raccoon dog (Nyctereutes procyonoides) and a ferret badger (Melogale moschata) as intermediate hosts. 46 Second, the 91% sequence identity between the Manis coronavirus and 2019-nCoV is high enough to confirm an evolutionary relation between the two viruses but not high enough to consider them as the same viral species. To put this into perspective, the viral sequence from intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are 99. 8 The Supporting Information is available free of charge at https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jproteome.0c00129.

These data show not only that snakes are not the vertebrates with the lowest RSCU distances to 2019-nCoV but also that unrelated species such as frogs and snakes have smaller RSCU distances to known hosts of all three coronaviruses.
