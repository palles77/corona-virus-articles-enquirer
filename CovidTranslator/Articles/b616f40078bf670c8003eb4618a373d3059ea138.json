The deduced amino acid sequence of the HE protein was most similar to that of MHV-S strain (94% identity), and the S protein sequence was most similar to that of MHV-Y strain (90% identity). The DVIM HE protein has a unique N-linked glycosylation site in addition to other glycosylation sites common to many MHV strains. Unlike in some typical MHV strain, such as MHV-A59 and MHV-JHM, the vast majority of the S glycoprotein molecules in DVIM exist an uncleaved form probably due to several amino acid substitutions around the cleavage site.",

Among these proteins, the S and HE glycoproteins form projections anchored in the virus envelope, and these projections are major determinants for neutralizing antibodies (3) . It has been shown that the S glycoprotein for MHV-A59 or MHV-JHM plays an important role in attachment of the virus to the cellular receptor and that it induces membrane fusion for virus penetration (10) . In addition, the S glycoproteins of these strains cause cell fusion between the target cells infected by viruses (3, 10) . The HE glycoprotein of DVIM possesses a hemagglutinating activity for binding to sialic acids on erythrocytes and an acetylesterase activity as a receptor-destroying enzyme as in the case of the HEF glycoprotein of in\u00afuenza C virus (13) . However, the role of the HE glycoprotein in virus infection is not yet known. Some strains of MHVs, such as DVIM and MHV-S, express HE glycoproteins (HE positive), while others, such as MHV-A59 and MHV-2, do not (HE negative) (1, 2) . It has been shown that both HE positive and negative strains use a common CEA (carcino embryonic antigen) family protein as a functional receptor on the target cells (17, 18) .",

As shown in Fig. 4 , four major bands, which correspond in size to the uncleaved S (180 kDa), HE monomer (69 kDa) in the reduced or HE dimer (140 kDa) in the unreduced preparation, N (58 kDa) and M (25\u00b130 kDa), were detected. Several faint bands were also observed. One of them is the band of about 90 kDa in the reduced preparation, which corresponds in size to the cleaved S glycoprotein. Using a densitymeter, we were able to estimate the intensity of the 90 kDa band was less than 5% of that of the 180 kDa band. These results suggest that a small portion of DVIM S glycoproteins exists as a cleaved form in the virion, although the vast majority as an uncleaved form. Gagneten et al. also detected a 90-kDa band from DVIM virion proteins in their gel electrophoresis which interacts with the antibody raised against the S glycoprotein of MHV-A59 (17) .",

For example, MHV-2, in which the S glycoprotein is not cleaved, has no fusion activity and an MHV-2 mutant, in which the S glycoprotein is changed to be cleaved, acquires fusogenic activity (15) . On the other hand, MHV-Y as well as some mutants of MHV-A59 and MHV-JHM, in which the S protein is not cleaved, although the virus is fusogenic (16, 19, 20) . DVIM is apparently in a similar situation, although there remains a possibility that a small portion of the cleaved S glycoprotein may cause the fusogenic activity of DVIM. The relationship between cleavage of the S glycoprotein and fusogenic activity in MHVs remains to be clari\u00aeed, and DVIM would provide a good system for studying this. ]methionine (Amersham), as described previously (11, 12) .
