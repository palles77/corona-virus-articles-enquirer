It was reported that the average cost for a patient with an acute exacerbation is 3.5 times higher than that for a patient without one (2) . Although multiple factors, such as allergen exposure, infection, air pollution, medication, and weather change, have been reported to be involved in asthma exacerbations, viral respiratory tract infection is considered a very common trigger (3) (4) (5) . One study detected respiratory viruses in 50% of adult asthma patients having an acute exacerbation (3) . A study of non-hospitalized asthma exacerbations in children reported that the presence of a viral respiratory illness was associated with more severe asthma symptoms, but had no impact on the recovery time (6) . However, there are inconsistencies between different study reports (7) . Corne (8) reported in a study that people with atopic asthma had more severe and longer-lasting lower-respiratory-tract symptoms than healthy individuals. The purpose of the current study was to explore the prevalence and potential roles of viral respiratory tract infection as a trigger of asthma exacerbations using subjects from out-patient clinics.",

Therefore, we used PCR for respiratory virus detection in this study.

(27) reported that the co-existence of high IgE levels and rhinovirus infection increased the risk of asthma exacerbation with an odds ratio of 10.8. Allergen exposure may increase the expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1, which is the cell surface receptor for rhinovirus and facilitates its entry (28, 29) . However, rhinovirus infection has been shown to promote airway hypersensitivity and eosinophil, neutrophil, and lymphocyte inflammation in an ovalbumin-sensitized mouse model (30) . A study by Message et al. (31) found that rhinovirus infection in an asthma patient increased both his asthma symptoms and airway eosinophil inflammation. However, in our study, which agrees with a similar report from Hongkong (6), there were no significant differences between the viral-positive and viral-negative asthma exacerbation subgroups in their overall asthma severity, CAT score, or respiratory symptoms at the first visit during acute exacerbation.",
