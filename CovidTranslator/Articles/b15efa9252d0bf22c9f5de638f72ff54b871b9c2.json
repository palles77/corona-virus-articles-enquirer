High-quality correctly folded Envs may therefore be critical for developing a vaccine that induces broadly neutralizing antibodies. Moreover, the high variability of Env may require immunizations with multiple Envs. Here, we report a universal strategy that provides for correctly folded Env trimers of high quality and yield through a repair-and-stabilize approach. In the repair stage, we utilized a consensus strategy that substituted rare strain-specific residues with more prevalent ones. The stabilization stage involved structure-based design and experimental assessment confirmed by crystallographic feedback. Regions important for the refolding of Env were targeted for stabilization. Notably, the a9-helix and an intersubunit b sheet proved to be critical for trimer stability.",

The gp120 subunit initiates fusion by binding to CD4 receptors and CCR5/CXCR4 coreceptors and transmitting this binding through conformational changes to the transmembrane gp41 subunit. The HIV-1 fusion machinery is sequestered in the prefusion conformation of gp41, which refolds into a postfusion conformation (Melikyan et al., 2000) . In the prefusion conformation, Env trimers spontaneously sample distinct conformational states (Munro et al., 2014) . Ligands can alter the proportion of molecules in these conformational states, with broadly neutralizing antibodies generally stabilizing a closed state and with CD4 stabilizing an open state (Liu et al., 2008; Munro et al., 2014; Ozorowski et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2016) .",

Moreover, low expression levels decrease prospects for successful protein subunit development or for the application of a vector based approach. Therefore, stable Env trimers are needed that fold efficiently into a prefusion-closed state and that fully arrest conformational changes to more open states. The introduction of the so-called SOSIP substitutions was an important step to obtain native trimers (Binley et al., 2000; Sanders et al., 2002) , but the fraction of prefusion-closed trimer remains less than optimal and/or the resultant trimers open in the presence of CD4 . Although elucidation of the trimer structure facilitated substantial progress in recent years to stabilize the conformation of Env based on disfavoring the postfusion conformation and to prevent breathing by introducing disulfide bridges, optimizing packing, utilizing stabilizing substitutions known from other Envs (Binley et al., 2000; Chuang et al., 2017; de Taeye et al., 2015; Dey et al., 2009; Garces et al., 2015; Guenaga et al., 2015 Guenaga et al., , 2017 Julien et al., 2013; Kesavardhana and Varadarajan, 2014; Kong et al., 2016; Kulp et al., 2017; Kwon et al., 2015; Lyumkis et al., 2013; Pancera et al., 2014; Sanders et al., 2002; Steichen et al., 2016; Stewart-Jones et al., 2016; Sullivan et al., 2017; Torrents de la Pe\u00f1 a et al., 2017) or by using of a chimeric strategy (Joyce et al., 2017) , a general approach to produce prefusion-closed Env trimers of high quality and yield, universally applicable to most HIV-1 strains, would be an important advancement for the field.",

At a critical point in the successive conformational changes, a tipping point is reached in which folding to the postfusion state is irreversible. In refolding region 1 of gp41 (Figure 2A ), the loop between prefusion a6-a7 helices refolds into a single helix, which is assembled on the base helix a7 together with a6 and the N-terminal fusion peptide making one long extended trimeric helical coiled coil with the other protomers of the trimer. Subsequently, additional gp41:gp120 interactions are lost and helices a8 and a9 refold and dock against the coiled coil region to complete the six-helix bundle of the postfusion gp41.",

Here, we observed that mutations Q590E and K601E did indeed decrease Env stability ( Figure S1A ). Residue Q590 in the base of the a7 helix is directed toward the trimer axis between three a7 chains; if mutated to a Glu, it likely causes charge repulsion between trimer protomers. In most published crystal structures, no side chain density is visible for residue 601, but in PDB: 5FYJ (Stewart-Jones et al., 2016) clear side chain density is visible for R601, which makes ionic interactions with E654 and E657 in a9 of a neighboring protomer. The large reduction in trimer formation upon replacing K601 with Glu is likely due to charge repulsion and concomitant loss of (A) Schematic definition of regions of HIV-1 Env that move more than 5 \u00c5 between prefusion closed and CD4-bound forms are shown blue for gp120, green for gp41, and black if not defined in either conformation.

By inspecting the ConC_base0 crystal structure, we observed clear density for all 7 stabilizing mutations as well as the introduced glycan at V295N ( Figure S3 ). The local interactions verified the stabilizing effect of these mutations. For example, F651 and I655 located in a9 strengthened the trimer interface by interacting with L537, I603, and L602 of a neighboring gp41 ( Figure 4B ). N535, located in a6 on the other side of the a6/a9 trimer interface, was exposed so a hydrophilic residue was likely more favorable.

The trimer peak is indicated with an asterisk and gp140 monomer peak is indicated with a degree symbol. See also Table S1 . I573F mutation at the N-terminal top of a7, close to the trimeric axis, stabilized the trimer through increased hydrophobic interaction. In addition to the stabilization between three protomers, stabilization between gp120 and gp41 within one protomer was also observed. Residue K588, D589, R585, E490, and K492 formed a cluster of charged residues in the gp120-gp41 interface that was balanced in the metastable structure but could harbor potential repulsions as a result of small local movements. The positive charge at position 588 could be partly compensated by D589, but in most crystal structures, the charged D589 is partly buried in the hydrophobic interface of gp120-gp41 (Lee et al., 2016; Pancera et al., 2014; Stewart-Jones et al., 2016) . The D589V mutation on gp41 has hydrophobic interactions with Y40, P493, and L494 on gp120 while the K588E has electrostatic interactions with K46 and K492 on gp120 as well as R585 on gp41. Interestingly, R585H was recently shown to stabilize the BG505 trimer (Kulp et al., 2017; Steichen et al., 2016) . From the ConC_base0 crystal structure, we calculated the difference in energy for each of the stabilizing mutants ( Figure S4A ) as well as the difference in energy for the mutation in the CD4bound prefusion structure ( Figure S4B ). In the prefusion closed structure, the most stabilizing mutation appeared to be from the hydrophobic interactions gained by N651F. In addition, A204I, I535N, I573F, and D589V also showed favorable DDG.",

In specific, we hypothesized that a consensus sequence might possess characteristics of founder virus Envs, which have higher fitness and more optimal folding than chronic virus Envs (Carlson et al., 2014; Tully et al., 2016) . This study showed that a consensus clade C sequence and repair of selected accumulated mutations of wild-type to consensus, yields superior expression, trimer formation, and antigenicity compared with the closest wild-type Env sequences. Because the prefusion spike is a highly dynamic and metastable fusion machine, the repaired sequence was further stabilized by modifications that arrest conformational changes needed for the fusion process. We therefore systematically searched for conserved weak interactions between the protomer interface and subunit interface based on the known X-ray and electron microscopy (EM) structures (Lee et al., 2016; Pancera et al., 2014; Stewart-Jones et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2016) .",

Several stabilizing substitutions (i.e., E647F, N651F, K655I, and D658V) in a9 improved the interaction at the trimer interface with a6 and b27, locking refolding region 1 and 2 and preventing the dissociation of a9 with a6 and b27 (Figures 4B and 4C) . Stabilization of the closed conformation was supported by the observation that CD4 induction leading to 17b binding was reduced in the stabilized ConC_base0 ( Figure 3C ). b27 is part of refolding region 2 and is the only structural element that is part of a secondary structure that also involves gp120. This intersubunit gp120/gp41 b sheet (b4, b26, b27) connects gp41 with the N and C terminus of gp120 and stabilizes the prefusion conformation of refolding region 2, preventing it from unfolding. This intersubunit b sheet has a pivotal role in Env stability, and we found stabilizing substitutions on both sides of the b sheet that keep b27 in place: the aforementioned stabilizing substitutions in a9 on one side and stabilizing substitutions in the highly charged region on the other side. Substitutions 588E and 589V improved the interaction of gp41 with the gp120 termini, stabilizing Y40 ensuring the intersubunit b4b26b27 sheet to not be disrupted ( Figures 4A and 4C) . The stabilizing substitutions we identified in the base are in line with the structure of the CD4bound prefusion state of Env Wang et al., 2016) , which shows that both the apex and the base are able to breathe and that, when the gp120 termini and the a6-b27 loop are pulled upward, the interaction between a9 and b27 and interactions in the charged network are lost. Therefore, substitutions may prevent breathing of the base that may also reduce breathing of the apex.",

We envision extreme motions of gp120 to provide freedom for the loop between a6 and a7 to hinge: when b27 contacts are lost, the gp120 N and C termini would be pulled from the gp41 clamp, and refolding regions 1 and 2 would be liberated. Because the hinge loop preceding the base helix is a common element of refolding region 1 in all type I fusion proteins, it had previously been suggested that stabilizing the hinge loop by introduction of prolines may be a general solution to stabilize this metastable element (Krarup et al., 2015) , which also has been successfully applied to other type I fusion proteins (Hastie et al., 2017; Pallesen et al., 2017) . The current study thus draws attention to a conserved structural element essential for the stability of refolding region 2, which comprises the intersubunit b sheet composed of b strands of the head and the fusion domain. Detachment or ''splaying'' of the head of the type I fusion proteins is expected ultimately to disrupt the intersubunit sheet and to destabilize contacts with refolding region 2 ( Figure 6 ). Therefore, stabilizing the intersubunit sheet may be a general strategy for conformationally fixing the prefusion state of other metastable type I fusion proteins, a potentially important step in their use as vaccine immunogens.",

For the consensus C (based on clade C) an alignment was downloaded (HIV Sequence Alignments. 3,434 sequences in total 7DEC14) from the Los Alamos database (https://www.hiv.lanl.gov/content/index). From this alignment, we selected C-clade ENVs (1,252 sequences), and these were used in the consensus maker in the Los Alamos HIV database website. Because the consensus contains a few question marks, the consensus sequence was used to Blast the closest wild-type homologs, which was then also used to substitute the amino acids that have a question mark in the consensus sequence. The resulting sequence was designated ConC (Langedijk, 2017) . Furthermore, two wild-type sequences with the highest homology to C4 and two wild-type sequences with the highest homology to ConC were identified with BLAST. The two sequences with the highest homology to C4 are the sequences with GenBank: AAS98045.1 and AAW57669.1. They are 93% and 84% identical to C4, respectively. The two sequences with the highest homology to ConC are the sequences with GenBank: ADM30337.1 and ADM30340.1, both having 90% sequence identity to ConC. The sequences were further modified by addition of the so-called SOSIP substitutions, optimization of the furin site by replacing the furin site (positions 508-511) by 6 Arg residues (R6), a C-terminal truncation of gp160 at residue 664, and a V295N mutation to introduce a PNGS that is present in more than 50% of all HIV-1",

The input trimer structure was first repaired using FoldX's RepairPDB command in order to optimize the structure by fixing steric clashes and lowering the global energy. Mutagenesis was performed using FoldX's BuildModel command. Number of runs was set to five to insure convergence based on optimal rotamer positions. The average DDG over the five runs were reported for each mutation.",
