She was treated for influenza, which was isolated repeatedly from ororpharynx and bronchoalveolar lavage fluids, and later empirically for lupus pneumonitis, but expired 6 months after transplant. Autopsy findings failed to show influenza in the lungs or lupus pneumonitis. A novel generic PCR-based assay using degenerate primers identified human coronavirus HKU1 RNA in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid at autopsy. Coronavirus was confirmed by virus-specific PCRs of lung tissue at autopsy. Electron microscopy showed viral particles consistent with coronavirus HKU1 in lung tissue both at autopsy and from a previous biopsy. While human coronavirus HKU1 infection is not usually severe, in highly immunocompromised patients, it can be associated with fatal pneumonia.",

Oseltamivir was discontinued after 21 days (16 weeks after transplant). Initially, her oxygenation improved and the dose of methylprednisolone was decreased; however, her hypoxemia subsequently worsened. Since repeat nasopharyngeal washes and BAL fluid continued to grow influenza, oseltamivir was reinstituted at 150 mg twice daily on the 29 th hospital day (17 weeks after transplant). Intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) was administered and steroids were continued; because an antiviral sensitivity test subsequently showed high level (IC 50 =770 nM, 14,000-fold increase) oseltamivir resistance, oseltamivir was discontinued and inhaled zanamivir was begun. A CD4 count obtained 20 weeks after transplant was 135 (normal range 385-1259). The patient was discharged from the hospital on zanamivir and a tapering dose of steroids at week 21 after transplant. The steroids were reinstituted when her infiltrates worsened and her pulmonary effusions returned. After improvement of her pulmonary status, steroids were again tapered. Sequencing of the oseltamivir-resistant H3N2 influenza virus isolate A/Bethesda/956/2006 showed an arginine to lysine mutation in the neuraminidase at amino acid 292, a mutation previously shown to be associated with oseltamivir resistance (2) and with diminished viral fitness in animal experiments and instability in vitro (3).",

Of these 63 sequences, 53 represented human sequences, 8 represented bacterial or yeast sequences, and 1 showed greatest homology to an insect sequence. The bacterial and fungal sequences detected in DOP-PCR were judged likely to be unrelated to her illness, because bacterial and fungal cultures at autopsy were negative. The 63rd sequence matched human CoV-HKU1 genotype A with 410 of 412 identical nucleotides, overlapping the M and N genes. There were two nucleotide changes (G28236A; A28384G) from the reference sequence (accession number DQ415914). All CoV-HKU1 genotype A sequences available in GenBank have the same sequence in this genome region, none has the nucleotide changes found in the CoV from the HSCT recipient.",

Two fatal cases of CoV-HKU1associated community acquired pneumonia were reported in which virus was detected in nasopharyngeal aspirates by RT-PCR (16) . Both patients had lymphopenia and were suffering from diabetes mellitus; one patient was 66 years old and had gastric lymphoma, while the other was 72 years old and had prostate carcinoma.

This universal virus detection tool can provide sequence information of the pathogen present in a given samples without any prior information about the genome. DOP-PCR is unbiased and has a detection limit that is close to that of nucleic acid testing techniques that use virus-specific primers (1) . Subtractive techniques that might be used in order to identify a pathogen require an uninfected but otherwise genetically identical control, which may be difficult to obtain for clinical samples. We previously showed that the detection limit of the DOP-PCR is several orders of magnitude more sensitive than that of other generic detection techniques (1). Isolation of nucleic acids from purified nucleocapsids in the DOP-PCR protocol is more likely to detect intact, infectious particles than PCR of the whole sample which has large amounts of contaminating cellular nucleic acids. DOP-PCR, in which viral nucleic acid sequences are highly enriched before PCR is performed, may be especially useful for finding pathogens that cannot be readily identified by standard methods. Nonetheless, results from non-specific screening techniques like the DOP-PCR must be independently verified, as exemplified by the detection by DOP-PCR of non-viral sequences in the autopsy specimen.",
