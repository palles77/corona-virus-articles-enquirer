            "text": "Background: The removal of personal protective equipment (PPE) after patient care may result in transfer of virus to hands and clothing of health care workers (HCWs). The risk of transfer can be modeled using harmless viruses to obtain quantitative data. To determine whether double-gloving reduces virus transfer to HCWs' hands and clothing during removal of contaminated PPE, we conducted a human challenge study using bacteriophages to compare the frequency and quantity of virus transfer to hands and clothes during PPE removal with single-gloving and double-gloving technique. Methods: Each experiment had a double-gloving phase and a single-gloving phase. Participants donned PPE (ie, contact isolation gown, N95 respirator, eye protection, latex gloves). The gown, respirator, eye protection, and dominant glove were contaminated with bacteriophage. Participants then removed the PPE, and their hands, face, and scrubs were sampled for virus. Results: Transfer of virus to hands during PPE removal was significantly more frequent with singlegloving than with double-gloving. Transfer to scrubs was similar during single-gloving and doublegloving. The amount of virus transfer to hands ranged from 0.15 to 2.5 log 10 most probable number. Significantly more virus was transferred to participants' hands after single-gloving than after doublegloving. Conclusions: Our comparison of double-gloving and single-gloving using a simulation system with MS2 and a most-probable number method suggests that double gloving can reduce the risk of viral contamination of HCWs' hands during PPE removal. If incorporated into practice when full PPE is worn, this practice may reduce the risk of viral contamination of HCWs' hands during PPE removal. The use of double gloves should be explored in larger controlled studies.",

PPE must be removed after each patient encounter, and transfer of organisms from contaminated PPE to hands or clothing could be a source of infection for HCWs as well as others. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) responded by asking experts to design a protocol to minimize contamination of the wearer's hands and clothing during PPE removal. 1 This protocol was based on expert opinion and knowledge, but was not empirically validated when it was designed. Whether these PPE removal practices effectively protect HCWs is an empirical question that is not easily answered in real-world health care settings, especially in the context of an ongoing outbreak. Data may be affected by problems with recall and variations in PPE use among health care facilities and among HCWs within the same facility. Outbreak settings do not allow for rigorous comparisons of PPE use practices, because obviously staff cannot be assigned or randomized to practices that might expose them to infection.",

            "text": "Empirical data on the effectiveness of PPE removal protocols and other aspects of PPE use can be objectively improved by using model systems with human volunteers and surrogate microorganisms. Modeling viral contamination and transfer events using harmless viruses in controlled settings allow investigators to obtain quantitative data on virus transfer events and risks to HCWs without exposing participants to the risk of infection. Bacteriophages are candidate surrogates for human viral pathogens. They are nonpathogenic, posing no risk to study participants. They are structurally similar to nonenveloped human viruses, including norovirus and hepatitis A, 7, 8 and because of these similarities have been previously used as surrogates to examine aspects of health care hand hygiene 9 and virus transfer 10 with human volunteers. A model system with human volunteers and the MS2 bacteriophage has been used to evaluate the CDC's PPE removal protocol. That study found that removing contaminated PPE according to the protocol still resulted in virus transfer to the wearer's hands and clothing. 11 The results of the previous volunteer study indicate the need for alternative PPE removal protocols to reduce the risk of wearer contamination during removal. Using the same model system as used in that study, we can empirically test such alternatives. One such alternative is double-gloving, in which 2 pairs of gloves are worn one on top of the other. When removing PPE, the outer pair of gloves is removed first, followed by the rest of the PPE items, and the inner pair of gloves is removed last. The HCW never actually touches any contaminated PPE item with bare hands. To examine whether double-gloving reduces the probability of virus transfer to HCWs' hands and clothing during the removal of contaminated PPE, we conducted a human challenge study using the bacteriophage MS2. This study compared the frequency and quantity of virus transfer to hands and clothes during PPE removal using single-gloving and double-gloving techniques.",

However, observations of participants' actions in this simulation of PPE use and removal suggest that a multistep removal protocol might not be an optimal approach. Although the participants in this study were given an opportunity to read the CDC PPE removal protocol poster and ask questions, and the poster was in front of them at all times for reference, most participants still made some type of error during removal. These errors, including handing PPE by touching the front areas (eg, handling N95 respirator by the front instead of the straps), are targeted by the CDC protocol because they are likely to result in hand contamination. In practice, HCWs are unlikely to have the protocol in front of them each time they need to remove PPE. Achieving adherence to the protocol may require multiple educational messages and feedback techniques targeting each item of PPE, making it a complex undertaking and not necessarily an efficient use of resources if some elements of the protocol are not actually protective.",

Double-gloving has some drawbacks, including greater cost due to the use of twice as many gloves, the extra time required to don extra gloves, and issues with HCWs' perception of impaired sensitivity and dexterity during double-gloving. 16, 17 An alternative targeted measure might be to encourage HCWs to double-glove during certain high-risk situations that are likely to result in heavily contaminated PPE, such as droplet-and aerosol-generating procedures like intubation that require gowns and respirators and have previously been observed to carry infection risks. 4 Although targeted measures such as the aforementioned may protect HCWs from hand contamination, the need to emphasize hand hygiene after PPE removal remains. According to the CDC protocol, hand hygiene should immediately follow each incidence of PPE removal. Little data are available on hand hygiene compliance specifically after removal of PPE. No study has found that glove use reduces hand hygiene compliance compared with situations in which gloves are not worn, 18 but research has shown that HCWs' general hand hygiene compliance is suboptimal. One multicenter study found a compliance rate of 36% in non-ICU settings, which increased to only 50% after intervention 19 ; another study found a rate of 32% before interventions designed to increase compliance, increasing to 63% after these interventions. 20 The risk of hand contamination during PPE removal underscores the crucial need to reinforce messages about the importance of hand hygiene when PPE is worn. Analyses of factors that contribute to the success of hand hygiene interventions suggest that incorporating \"vicarious experience\" and \"introduction of experiential elements\" as part of educational efforts can improve compliance. 21 Simulations such as the one used in the present study demonstrate how these types of virus transfers can occur during real-world use. Presenting information from and encouraging HCWs to participate in such simulations can help reinforce the importance of hand hygiene after PPE removal and thereby improve compliance.",

The amount of virus transferred to scrubs did not differ significantly in the 2 study phases, and transfer to scrubs occurred in the absence of detectable hand contamination (data not shown). Contamination of the clothing worn under PPE may occur when an item of PPE, such as the gown, contacts the scrubs during removal. This can occur even in the absence of transfer of virus to hands. Our findings suggest that double-gloving did not affect the transfer of virus to scrubs. In this study, the most likely cause of the greater contamination of scrub shirts was accidental contact between shirts and hands or gowns. Although according to protocol, the gown should be grasped by the neckline and pulled off inside out, this still provides an opportunity for the hands or gloves to come in contact with the gown's fabric, especially near the neck and shoulders. This study was not designed to determine whether penetration of viruses through gown material, in contrast to direct contact with the outside of contaminated PPE items, might be a factor in the contamination of scrubs. The contamination of scrubs observed here suggests that the potential risks posed by handling scrubs that have been worn during patient care, as well as wearing them outside the health care facility after work, merit further examination. Further research is needed to explore the need for measures to prevent the transmission of viruses via contaminated clothing after PPE use.",

Whether or not double-gloving is used, reinforcing the importance of hand hygiene after PPE removal is vital. Even if effective removal protocols can be formulated, the errors in adhering to the removal protocol observed in this study suggest that a single behavioral change message, such as the wearing of a second pair of gloves in high-risk situations, or a message targeting the importance of hand hygiene specifically after PPE removal, may be simpler than trying to achieve universal adherence to a multistep removal protocol that is then followed by hand hygiene.",

The double-gloving technique is a promising alternative that should be explored in larger controlled studies of PPE removal and virus transfer risks.",
