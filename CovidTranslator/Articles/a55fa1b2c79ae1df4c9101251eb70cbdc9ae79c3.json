Increased understanding of the molecular mechanisms of viral infection has provided great potential for the discovery of new antiviral agents that target viral proteins or host factors. Virus-targeting antivirals can function directly or indirectly to inhibit the biological functions of viral proteins, mostly enzymatic activities, or to block viral replication machinery. Host-targeting antivirals target the host proteins that are involved in the viral life cycle, regulating the function of the immune system or other cellular processes in host cells. Here we review key targets and considerations for the development of both antiviral strategies.",

Over the past 30 years, antiviral agents that target viral proteins or host factors have been successfully developed. Based on their inhibitory mechanisms, antiviral reagents can be divided into two groups: (i) inhibitors that target the viruses themselves or (ii) inhibitors that target host cell factors. Virus-targeting antivirals (VTAs) can function directly (DVTAs) or indirectly (InDVTAs) to inhibit biological functions of viral proteins, mostly enzymatic activities, or they block the correct formation of the viral replication machinery (Table 1) . Host-targeting antivirals (HTAs) include reagents that target the host proteins that are involved in the viral life cycle (Figure 1 ), regulating the function of the immune system or other cellular processes in host cells. With increased knowledge of viral protein and host factors, the scientific community has achieved great progress in mechanism-based antiviral discovery against chronic viral infectious diseases, and in understanding of the emergence of new viral diseases and of the resistance to traditional antivirals. This review will highlight recent achievements in antiviral development and discuss various strategies for preventing virus attachment and entry into the host cell, as well as strategies for preventing virus replication and transcription within the host cell.",

For enveloped viruses, the viral proteins located on the outer envelope of the virion are responsible for the recognition of receptors and the attachment to host cells. HIV (a member of the Retroviridae family) is a typical enveloped virus, and its invasion is mediated by the envelope proteins gp120 and gp41, which are arranged on the viral membrane as a trimer of three trans-membrane gp41 and three noncovalently attached gp120 surface subunits [1] (Figure 2 ). gp120 recognizes the CD4 receptor and launches the conformational changes that expose the binding sites for the binding of a co-receptor, (i.e., CCR5 and CXCR4 [2] ). Antagonists that block the interactions between HIV and its receptor and co-receptors have therefore been developed as anti-HIV therapeutics. Attempts to find specific inhibitors that block the interaction between HIV-1 and CD4 were initiated using a soluble extracellular domain of CD4 protein that retained the ability to bind gp120. Although the preliminary results revealed that either soluble CD4 protein or a CD4-immunoglobulin fusion protein showed good in vitro anti-HIV activity, all failed in clinical trials due to poor pharmacokinetic features (e.g., the half-life of CD4-immunoglobulin fusion protein in mice is only 2.4 h) [3] [4] [5] . Small molecule inhibitors that occupy a specific region within the CD4-binding pocket of gp120 were subsequently developed to block the gp120-CD4 interaction (Figure 2A ). For example, BMS488043 [6] and BMS663068 [7] were found to significantly reduce HIV-1 proliferation and have good pharmaceutical characteristics.",

            "text": "Another success is influenza neuraminidase (NA) inhibitor (NAI). Influenza NA is a surface glycoprotein and functions at two steps of the viral life cycle: (i) cleaves the cell receptor sialic acid residues, which bind to influenza hemagglutinin (HA), and allows the release of the progeny virus; and (ii) cleaves the sialic acid moieties on the mucin that bathes the airway epithelial cells or cobinds the receptor with HA [8] . In line with the structure of NA [9, 10] , several NAIs have been successfully developed to competitively occupy the sialic acid-binding pocket of NA. Among these NAIs, oseltamivir and zanamivir were first used clinically as an anti-flu therapy [11] . Oseltamivir is a prodrug that is readily absorbed by the gastrointestinal tract and is converted by hepatic esterases to the active compound (oseltamivir carboxylate). Zanamivir has poor oral bioavailability and is currently available as a dry powder mixed with lactose. Moreover, laninamivir and peramivir were also approved in North Asia recently. Laninamivir has excellent in vitro activity against wild type, as well as oseltamivir-resistant, influenza viruses currently circulating [12] . Additionally, peramivir is another NAI that differs structurally from other inhibitors through novel substitutions that result in multiple binding interactions with the active site and allows the antiviral to be active against NAI-resistant viruses [13] . Non-enveloped viruses, such as the picornavirus (Picornaviridae family) and human papillomavirus (HPV) (Papillomaviridae family), interact with their functional receptors through viral capsid proteins. Picornaviruses are typical non-enveloped viruses, and some members, including enterovirus 71 (EV71) and human rhinoviruses (HRVs), are responsible for causing severe human infection diseases. The non-enveloped capsids of picornaviruses are icosahedral structures comprising 60 copies of viral structural proteins VP1-4 [14, 15] . VP1-3 each adopt a b-barrel configuration and are arranged with icosahedral symmetry such that VP1 surrounds the 5-fold axes and VP2 and VP3 alternate around the 2-and 3-fold axes [16] . Although the receptor-binding sites on the surface of picornavirus capsids are not conserved [17] , these sites have been used to discover inhibitors that block virus-receptor interactions. For example, the canyon structure on the surface of the HRV capsid serves to bind to the HRV receptor, and the soluble portion of the intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) [18] and numerous compounds that compete with the putative HRV receptor binding site have been shown to bind in a nearby hydrophobic pocket to inhibit virus attachment to the receptor [19] . However, none of these compounds have been clinical successes to date.",

            "text": "After attaching to host cells, a virus will release its genome into the cytoplasm through endocytosis or direct membrane fusion. Because this viral entry is one of the key early steps in the viral life cycle (Figure 1 ), entry inhibitors have been successfully developed for antiviral therapies. As an enveloped virus, HIV-1 uses gp41 to facilitate its entry process after gp41 is activated by the binding of gp120 to the receptor. The extracellular portion of gp41 contains two heptad repeat domains (HR1 and HR2) separated by a loop region and a hydrophobic fusion peptide (FP) at the N terminus. During the fusion process, the FP of gp41 is inserted into the host cell membrane, and HR1 adopts a triple-stranded coiled-coil structure, forming a meta-stable prefusion intermediate. HR2 subsequently folds into the hydrophobic grooves of the HR1 coiled-coil to form a stable six-helix bundle that juxtaposes the viral and cellular membranes for fusion ( Figure 2C ). Fusion inhibitors are designed to block the conformational changes that are required for membrane fusion. The T20 peptide (Enfuvirtide), which is a peptidic mimic of HR2 and acts by competitively binding to HR1, is the first and the only clinically approved fusion inhibitor [20, 21] . T20 can inhibit a broad range of HIV strains at the nanomolar level, but the poor bioavailability of the drug (it has a plasma half-life of 4 h) make the clinical application of this drug difficult [22, 23] . To overcome this pharmacokinetic disadvantage, a series of modified peptides including Cp32M [24] , Sifuvirtide [25] , and T2635 [26] have been generated to stabilize the helical structure of the HR2-like peptide by incorporating intrahelical salt bridges between the helix turns. In particular, the plasma half-life of sifuvirtide is 5-fold greater than that of T20 [27] . Moreover, chemical modifications including the PEGylation [28] , glycosylation [29] , and more have also been introduced to improve the pharmacokinetics of HR2-based fusion inhibitors.",

After attaching to their receptors, a non-enveloped virus releases its genome into the host cell through a conformational shift of its capsid protein(s). For example, the capsid of EV71 harbors 60 copies of a hydrophobic 'pocket factor', a natural lipid (sphingosine), at the base of the canyon in the capsid protein VP1 [35] (Figure 3 ). The expulsion of sphingosine following the binding of the virus to its receptor triggers the opening of the capsid to release the viral genome. Pleconaril [36] and BTA798 are two examples of hydrophobic compounds that can replace the natural pocket factor and inhibit picornaviral uncoating by generating resistance to the expulsion of pocket factor [37] [38] [39] . Using the skeletons of pleconaril and related molecules, a novel class of imidazolidinones has been further synthesized with significant anti-EV71 activity (IC 50 in the range of 0.001-25 mM) [40] .",

The viral proteases carry out the proteolysis of a polyprotein precursor and release functional viral proteins, allowing them to function correctly and individually in replication/transcription and maturation [41, 42] . Viral proteases also effectively protect viral proteins by modulating host cell pathways, including ubiquitination and ISGylation [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] [48] . In contrast to the diversity of viral protease functions and structures, the catalytic active site of viral proteases generates stringent substrate specificity in protein cleavage. Synthetic substrate peptides, which can be designed according to the natural substrates of individual viral proteases, usually generate high-affinity binding and thus provide potent candidates for further drug discovery. One of the great successes is the HIV-1 protease inhibitors (PIs). There are ten PIs currently approved to treat HIV-1 infection: amprenavir (APV), atazanavir (ATZ), darunavir (TMC114), fosamprenavir (Lexiva), indinavir (IDV), lopinavir (LPV), nelfinavir (NFV), ritonavir (RTV), saquinavir (SQV), and tipranavir (TPV) [49] . All HIV-1 PIs share relatively similar chemical structures derived from its natural peptidic substrate and, therefore, the cross-resistance to PIs occurs at the active site of HIV-1 protease [50] . As a result, PIs are commonly used as the combination with other anti-HIV drugs to avoid drug resistance. Because most of the pharmaceutical disadvantages have been overcome, PIs have become the most potent types of antiviral drugs. Current progress in generating antiviral PIs has been systematically reviewed elsewhere [51, 52] .",

Thus, polymerases are becoming the most attractive and suitable targets for antiviral development. Based on the function and structure of viral polymerases, there are two major types of polymerase inhibitors: (i) nucleoside and nucleotide substrate analogs and (ii) allosteric inhibitors. Nucleoside/ nucleotide analogs play a dominant role in antiviral drugs targeting viral polymerases. Nucleoside analogs are first triphosphated by the host cell to produce the active inhibitor and then act as an inhibitor by competing with the natural nucleoside triphosphates and terminating the growing viral nucleic acids. The disadvantage of nucleoside analogs is that the initial phosphorylation step, that is, production of the monophosphorylated form, required for activation to a triphosphate may not correctly occur in the host cell [53] . Therefore, monophosphate nucleotide analogs were developed as polymerase inhibitors to avoid this problem. To date, most of the approved antiviral drugs for anti-HIV therapy utilize this mechanism, including Zidovudine (AZT,",

Therefore, compounds that bind to the allosteric site could conceivably block the structural movement of polymerase domains and thus inhibit the function of viral polymerases. Antiviral inhibitors that work by this mechanism are known as 'allosteric inhibitors'. The allosteric inhibitors of HIV reverse transcriptase (RT) are also known as nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs). NNRTIs and the hydrophobic binding site on HIV RT were first identified by screening compound libraries against HIV-1 RT combined with structural biological analysis [58] [59] [60] [61] . The binding of NNRTI to HIV-1 RT prevents the flexibility and movement of RT required for the elongation of the nucleic acid. To date, there are five NNRTIs, that is, nevirapine, delavirdine, efavirenz, etravirine, and rilpivirine, that have been approved by the FDA for clinical use to treat HIV-1 infection. Furthermore, the development of NNRTIs against other viral polymerases, such as that of HCV, is ongoing, and other polymerases are likely to have suitable sites for allosteric inhibitors [62] .",

Dolutegravir is the most advanced second generation INSTI, and it possess good tolerability, once-daily dosing with no need for a pharmacological enhancer, and relatively little cross-resistance with raltegravir [64] . Another INSTI, elvitegravir, was recently approved for the treatment of HIV infection as part of a fixed dose combination known as Stribild [65] . Furthermore, inhibitors of the lens epithelium-derived growth factor (LEDGF)/p75 binding site of integrase (LED-GINs) have also been developed, but these are still in a very early stage. Each of these drugs contributes a new benefit to the class and will extend the treatment options for patients with HIV-1 infection.",

In the latter cases, a cap structure is generated by a series of enzymes and attached to the first nucleotide of the genome RNA via a 5 0 -5 0 triphosphate linker. For example, the genome of flavivirus is capped by a type 1 cap structure (m 7 GpppAm), which is methylated at the N-7 position of the guanine (m 7 G) and on the 2 0 OH of the ribose of the first nucleotide (Am) of the genome RNA [66] . Three enzymatic steps are required to form the cap structure, including an RNA triphosphatase (NS3), a guanylyl transferase (GTase), and a methyltransferase (MTase), provided by the N terminus of NS5 protein. Based on the structure of MTase and its complex with different substrates, three key ligand-binding sites were identified ( Figure 5 ). The binding site for S-adenosyl methionine (SAM), which acts as the methyl donor, is located at the core domain of MTase, whereas the binding site for the receiver GTP molecule and the guanine moiety of the RNA cap is formed by the core domain and the N-terminal extension. Moreover, there is another site that binds RNA between the SAM and GTP pockets; this site is known to be a second, lower affinity binding site that is formed by the core domain and by a channel between two helices of the Nterminal extension.",

Through structure-based drug design, aurintricarboxylic acid was found to inhibit the 2 0 -O activity of DENV MTase with an IC 50 of 2 mM by binding to the lower affinity site [68] . Another inhibitor, sinefungin, which is an analog of SAM with the methylated sulfur of SAM replaced by a carbon and amine, can inhibit flavivirus activity with an IC 50 as low as 0.7 mM [69] . Recently, the compound BG323 has been discovered using high-throughput screening (HTS) methods as an in vitro inhibitor of the guanylyltransferase activity of DENV MTase (and thus DENV replication) [70] . However, these inhibitors must be used at a high concentration to outcompete the high-affinity endogenous ligand, and it is necessary to solve this problem before this mechanism can be clinically exploited.",

SARS-CoV (nsp13 protein), Simian virus 40 (SV40) (Polyomaviridae family) (TAg protein), and HPV (E1 protein) are also known to encode helicases for their replication [71] . The inhibitors of helicase-catalyzed ATP hydrolysis are the most straightforward class, and several nucleotide and nucleobase analogs have been discovered targeting this mechanism. Biphenyls and triphenylmethanes have been studied as inhibitors of SV40 TAg [72] , HPV E1 [73] , and HCV NS3 helicase [74] . Biphenyls and biphenysulfonacetic acid were found to inhibit HPV growth, an inhibitor of HPV E1-catalyzed ATP hydrolysis with an IC 50 value >2 mM [75] . Compounds similar to triclocarban (CID7547) and Bisphenol A (BPA; CID6623) were found to inhibit the helicase activity of SV40 TAg. Based on the complex structure of the HCV NS3 helicase domain and soluble blue HT (PDB code 2ZJO), triphenylmethanes, a more potent triphenylmethane [76] , and aurintricarboxylic acid (ATA) [77] were developed to inhibit the helicase activity of HCV NS3.",

Gao et al. identified a potent HCV inhibitor, BMS790052, that targets NS5A and produced few side effects in a Phase I clinical study [81] . Although the exact mechanism by which BMS790052 exerts its effects is yet to be defined, the resistance profile reveals that inhibitor sensitivity maps to the N terminus of domain 1 of NS5A. This inhibitor is further shown to block the hyperphosphorylation of NS5A, which is believed to play an essential role in the viral life cycle.

Kao et al. first identified a compound, nucleozin, that triggers the aggregation of and inhibits the nuclear accumulation of NP; this compound can inhibit the replication of influenza virus with a nanomolar median effective concentration (EC 50 ) [97] . In a parallel effort, Gerritz et al. discovered a series of influenza replication inhibitors and showed that they interfere with NP-dependent processes via the formation of higher order NP ",

Notably, the structure of the NP in complex with a representative compound from this class of inhibitors revealed that two molecules of an inhibitor in an antiparallel orientation lock two adjacent NP protomers. This unexpected quaternary complex explained the viral inhibition via ligand-induced formation of stable NP oligomers [98] . In addition to inhibiting NP, the disruption of the polymerase complex of influenza virus has been proposed for antiviral strategies. Based on the complex structure of the PA C-terminal domain (PA C ) and the first 25 amino acids of PB1 [99] , a subset of modifications on N-terminal peptide of PB1 was shown to diminish the binding affinity of PA and PB1, inhibit polymerase activity, and attenuate the replication of influenza virus [100] [101] [102] . Moreover, the structure of SFTSV NP in complex with Suramin, an antiviral inhibitor, revealed that the blockers bind to the RNA-binding cavity and can attenuate SFTSV replication; this indicated that targeting RNP formation may be a new therapeutic antiviral approach [103, 104] . Because both the polymerase complex and NP show significant conservation between different influenza viruses, these results demonstrated that targeting the formation of viral RNP is a valid approach to the development of small molecule therapies against serious antiviral resistance to currently available drugs, such as adamantanes or neuraminidase inhibitors.",

Among these ISGs, IFN-inducible transmembrane (IFITM) proteins restrict the entry of influenza virus, West Nile virus (WNV), and DENV.

However, the precise mechanisms of these co-receptor antagonists are still not clear. Recently, the crystal structures of CCR5 [141] and CXCR4 [142] have been reported. These two structures provided the atomic information of the ligand-binding pocket and the sites for co-receptor oligomerization. Further structural study on the complex of CCR5 and CXCR4 with their antagonists will promote the investigation into the inhibitory mechanisms of these inhibitors and help us to increase their anti-HIV efficacy.",

This is because we still do not have very precise knowledge on the mechanisms underlying alternative strategies, and this requires further investigations on their mechanism before these strategies can be widely used for antiviral development, in particular those targeting drug-resistant viral infections. In our opinion, protease and polymerase inhibitors will still be the first, and probably the major, choice in the development of therapies against emerging novel viruses.",

For some viruses, currently available drugs can effectively eliminate the virus in the host, but genetic components are left behind. Thus, the host still suffers from the infection because the virus can integrate its genetics into the host cell. For example, treatment with the combination of INF and adefovir (or other antivirals) can effectively, if not completely, reduce HBV titer in human liver. However, the covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) cannot be removed and still exists in the nuclei of infected liver cells, where it continuously coordinates the expression of HBV antigens. Therefore, new mechanisms and strategies to completely remove viral components integrated in host cells, as well as to kill the virus itself, are required in future antiviral development.",
