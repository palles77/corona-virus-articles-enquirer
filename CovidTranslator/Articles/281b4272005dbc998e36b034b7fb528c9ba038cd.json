Here we describe s-RT-MELT, a novel technology that enables highly expanded enzymatic mutation scanning in human samples for germline or low-level somatic mutations, or for SNP discovery. GC-clamp-containing PCR products from interrogated and wild-type samples are hybridized to generate mismatches at the positions of mutations over one or multiple sequences in-parallel. Mismatches are converted to double-strand breaks using a DNA endonuclease (Surveyor TM ) and oligonucleotide tails are enzymatically attached at the position of mutations. A novel application of PCR enables selective amplification of mutationcontaining DNA fragments. Subsequently, melting curve analysis, on conventional or nano-technology real-time PCR platforms, detects the samples that contain mutations in a high-throughput and closed-tube manner. We apply s-RT-MELT in the screening of p53 and EGFR mutations in cell lines and clinical samples and demonstrate its advantages for rapid, multiplexed mutation scanning in cancer and for genetic variation screening in biology and medicine.",

For example, mutations in genes like EGFR can profoundly influence chemotherapeutic response in lung cancer (2) (3) (4) (5) and the response is modulated by mutations in other genes of the same signaling pathway [e.g. K-ras, HER2, ErbB-3 (1, 6) ]. Therefore there is a need for efficient and high-throughput mutation screening of multiple genes along identified signal transduction pathways in tumor samples. Because a large portion of cancer-causing genetic changes remains unknown and can occur in numerous positions along tumor suppressor genes (e.g. p53, ATM, PTEN) mutation scanning rather than detection of specific mutations is frequently required for molecular cancer profiling.",

However, the expense associated with these techniques is currently high both for instrumentation and for runningcosts. Since somatic mutations for most genes are relatively rare events it can be inefficient to scan for mutations using expensive approaches that in several cases provide unnecessary data (14, 15) .

As a less expensive alternative, rapid pre-screening methods such as SSCP, DGGE, dHPLC, CCM, CDCE or HR-melting are widely utilized to identify DNA fragments that contain mutations prior to performing full sequencing (14, (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) . Enzymatic mutation detection based on mismatch scanning enzymes like MutY, TDG or T4 endonuclease VII for mutation pre-screening has also been employed (21) (22) (23) (24) (25) , albeit with modest success since these enzymes cannot detect all possible mutations and deletions (22) and some of them have substantial activity on homoduplex DNA (16) . Recently an enzymatic mutation scanning method based on the Surveyor TM (CELI/II) nuclease (26, 27) combined with dHPLC or gel electrophoresis detection was introduced that shows satisfactory selectivity and reliability (1% mutant to wild-type alleles is detectable) while it also identifies all base substitutions and small deletions that are important to cancer (17, 28) or to biotechnology and plant genetic applications [TILLING method (29) (30) (31) (32) (33) (34) ]. While reliable, the use of dHPLC for examining Surveyor TM -generated DNA fragments is a slow endpoint detection method restricted to examining a single DNA fragment at a time and the resulting DNA fragments cannot be sequenced. This limits analysis of cancer specimens when numerous samples or genetic regions need to be screened.",

By selectively amplifying mutationcontaining DNA from wild-type fragments, the present approach de-couples enzymatic mutation scanning from the endpoint detection step. As a result, following enzymatic action on mismatches any chosen DNA detection method (real-time PCR, gel/capillary electrophoresis, microarray-based detection) can potentially be used to identify the mutated DNA fragments in a simplex or multiplex fashion. Here we utilize real-time PCR coupled with melting curve analysis (Surveyor TMmediated Real Time Melting, s-RT-MELT) to validate the new technology. We demonstrate that this approach increases the mutation scanning throughput by 1-2 orders of magnitude when several (4100) samples are to be pre-scanned for mutations, enables mutation scanning over several PCR fragments simultaneously and mutationpositive samples can be directly sequenced when somatic mutations are at a low-level ($1-10% mutantto-wild-type ratio) in surgical cancer specimens.",

The real-time PCR reaction was again performed at 888C and mutant-to wild-type ratios of $1-10% were distinguished from the wild-type using either dHPLC ( Figure 2D ) or melting curve analysis ( Figure 2E ). In these samples, direct di-deoxy-sequencing could not identify a mutation if the ratio of mutant-towild-type was 5$30-40% (data not shown). On the other hand, sequencing of s-RT-MELT products was possible including the lower dilutions ( Figure 2F ). sRT-MELT sequencing generated traces with poly-A tails depicting the presence and the position of the mutation, although the exact nucleotide change was less clear than the one in exon 5 (i.e. the position AE1 base from the mutation might also be confused to be a mutation). The reason for this AE1 base ambiguity of the exact position of the mutation can be probably understood. The PCR performed following poly-A tail addition contains an equimolar mixture of three reverse primers (3 0 ending in V = G, A or C). Depending on the exact nucleotide at the mutation, the correct primer should in theory be preferred, while the other two primers should not allow efficient polymerase extension due to the mismatched 3 0 -end. However, in practice this 'allele-specific PCR' step occasionally allows 3 0 -mismatched primer extension, enabling more than one version of the primer to amplify over the position of the mutation, or alternatively the incorporation of the poly-A tail may occur AE1 base from the exact position of the mutation. We conclude that in certain cases sRT-MELT indicates the position of the mutation to within 1 base, while in others (e.g. p53 exon 5) it indicates the position 'and' the actual nucleotide change.",

            "text": "Next, p53 exon 8 was amplified using DNA from a group of 48 surgical lung adenocarcinoma samples and s-RT-MELT was used for the screening of unknown mutations via melting curve analysis. Mutations at different positions along exon 8 were present in several of these clinical samples, as indicated by the shift in melting profiles obtained ( Figure 2H ) and subsequently verified via sequencing. In this set of samples, sRT-MELT-sequencing detected a low-level mutation on a colon cancer specimen (CT20) that direct sequencing failed to identify ( Figure 2I ). As with Figure 2F , sequencing of sample CT20 indicated the position of poly-A tail addition to within one base, but the actual nucleotide change was difficult to identify. To exclude the possibility for a false positive, two independent RFLP-based methods were used to verify the presence of the mutation. Thus, since the position of poly-A tail addition was known ( Figure 2I , codon 273 of p53 exon 8) the mismatched primer approach by Behn et al. (42) was used to introduce an MluI restriction site for the wild-type p53 sample but not for the codon 273 mutants. Subsequent restriction with MluI enzyme followed by PCR generated a product with a 14487G4A mutation for the CT20 sample but not for the wild-type sample (Supplementary Figure 1 , Frame A). As an additional verification for the low-level CT20 mutation, we observed that G4A mutation generates a de-novo Nla-III site at the position of the mutation. Accordingly, we applied 'Amplification via Primer-Ligation At The Mutation', a method that we described previously (40, 41) to ligate a primer at the Nla-III-digested site, and preferentially amplified the mutant fragment in a second PCR. The sequenced PCR product identified again the 14487G4A mutation (Supplementary Figure 1, Frame B) . In conclusion, sRT-MELT identified correctly a p53 codon 273 low-level mutation on CT20 that was missed by regular sequencing. This is very significant as p53 exon 8 mutations at codon 273 have been associated with bad prognosis in cancer (43, 44) . Table 2 of Supplementary Data depicts a good agreement between standard Surveyor screening, s-RT-MELT screening and di-deoxy-sequencing, except for the low-level mutation discovered on sample CT20 via s-RT-MELT. s-RT-MELT-sequencing traces for two samples with p53 exons 6 and 7 mutations are also depicted.",

To estimate the influence of the GC-clamp length on PCR efficiency versus temperature and the PCR amplification of fragments generated for mutations lying at different positions along the sequence, a calculation based on the POLAND algorithm (37) was performed. The predicted minimum temperatures for substantial PCR amplification were then plotted versus the experimentally observed values. Three possibilities were simulated, no GC-clamp, 26 nucleotides (nt) GC-clamp and 117-nt GC-clamp. DNA fragments corresponding to mutations at several positions along exon 8 were also simulated and compared to the experimentally observed minimum temperatures for generating a PCR product for three samples that contained mutations at different positions along p53 exon 8 (SW480, CT5 and TL50). The results ( Figure 2G ) indicate agreement to within $1.08C between theoretical prediction and experimental observation. For denaturation temperatures in the region 85-888C in combination with a 26-nt GC-clamp all the available mutations on p53 exon 8 are predicted to result in selective amplification of the mutation-containing fragment and inhibition of the GC-clamp-containing fragment. This prediction is consistent with the experimental results obtained from PCR temperature-titration experiments ( Figure 2G ). The developed calculation algorithm can thus be used to predict the appropriate PCR denaturation temperature for additional PCR fragment/GC-clamp combinations.",

The ability of s-RT-MELT for detecting low-level EGFR mutations was evaluated by performing DNA dilutions of a heterozygous EGFR exon 20 into a homozygous sample. A 1-10% mutant-to-wildtype ratio was detectable in this dilution experiment ( Figure 3F) . Finally, the application of s-RT-MELT in detecting mutations in DNA from formalin-fixed paraffinembedded (FFPE) samples was examined by screening four clinical FFPE lung adenocarcinoma specimens. Two of these samples were known to harbor EGFR exon 21 mutations (L858R), while the other two were negative for mutations when independently evaluated via dHPLC (28) . Figure 3I demonstrates the identification of the mutational status of these samples via s-PCR-MELT.",

To demonstrate that s-RT-MELT can be used for parallel scanning of mutations in several PCR products, we mixed equimolar amounts of PCR products from p53 exons 5-9 containing mutations either in exon 8 or in exon 9. We then formed 'cross-hybridized sequences' and screened the mixture for mutations in p53 exons 5-9 in a single tube using s-RT-MELT, as depicted in Figure 1A . Following real-time PCR and melting curve analysis, the exon 8 or exon 9 mutants were clearly distinguished from the wild-type sample ( Figure 4A, curves 1-3) . Next, the mutant exon 8 DNA sample was first diluted 10-fold into wild-type exon 8 and the equimolar mixture of p53 exons 5-9 was prepared and screened again in a single tube via s-RT-MELT. The exon 8 mutation was again distinguished from the wild-type mixture of exons ( Figure 4B , curves 1-3). Since 480% of p53 mutations in human tumors are encountered in exons 5-9 (45), the multiplex single-tube s-RT-MELT reaction could be used to identify most p53 mutations encountered in clinical tumor samples. Combined with multiplex PCR directly from genomic DNA, this approach could result to a convenient, high-throughput method for mutation scanning.",

As a proof of principle of the compatibility of s-RT-MELT with OpenArray TM , p53 exon 8 PCR products were generated from 48 different lung adenocarcinoma samples and mutation-containing cell lines and processed via the hybridization and enzymatic steps of s-RT-MELT. The 48 samples were each dispensed in 10 replicate nano-liter volume reactions on OpenArray TM plates pre-fabricated to contain the appropriate primers and amplified in 3072 real-time PCR reactions using a denaturation temperature of 908C in the presence of SYBR-GREEN I dye. Melting curves were subsequently obtained using the OpenArray TM melting curve analysis mode. The PCR growth curves and smoothed differential melting curves obtained distinguish clearly the mutation-containing samples from wild-type samples ( Figure 4C and D, representative results from 3072 reactions). Furthermore, identification of mutation-containing samples is in good agreement between the conventional and the nano-technology platforms ( Figure 4D versus Figure 2H ).",

            "text": "The intrinsic potential of enzymatic mutation scanning for parallel identification of mutations can, in principle, be very high since the enzyme operates on numerous distinct mismatch-containing sequences on a molecule-tomolecule basis thus providing highly parallel mutation scanning. However, in the past the selectivity of the enzymes used and the endpoint detection method has limited the realization of this potential. Here we enabled Surveyor TM , an endonuclease that recognizes selectively mismatches formed by mutations and small deletions following 'cross-hybridized sequence' formation, to generate mutation-specific DNA fragments that are amplified and screened via differential melting curve analysis. The replacement of size-separation methods (capillary/gel electrophoresis, dHPLC) by real-time PCR technology as the endpoint detection platforms and the ability to scan more than one sequences in parallel result in a highly increased throughput for s-RT-MELT while retaining the ability to detect diverse mutations at low-levels. Cel I/II endonucleases have also been known to have exonuclease activity on 5 0 DNA-ends (26, 27) . For this reason, s-RT-MELT was designed to attach an oligonucleotide linker to the 3 0 -DNA ends via terminal transferase (TdT) instead of using the 5 0 -DNA ends. The exonuclease activity also tends to degrade the attached 5 0 -GC-clamps in s-RT-MELT, thereby eliminating their influence in reducing amplification of un-digested fragments. We found that if exposure of DNA 'cross-hybridized sequences' to Surveyor TM is limited to 15-20 min, the substantial degradation of 5 0 -GC-clamps is avoided. For multiplexing mutation detection using several PCR products simultaneously, the size of the GC-clamp on each PCR amplicon may need to be individually adjusted to ensure that mutations along all sequence positions of the PCR products included in the mixture can be screened at a single real-time PCR temperature and that undigested fragments do not amplify. The calculational tools developed in this work can be used to guide the individual design of GC-clamps. s-RT-MELT detects heterozygous SNPs as well as mutations. As with other mutation prescreening techniques, the presence of a SNP concurrently with a mutation might be difficult to identify without performing sequencing. Because SNPs occur at fixed positions, melting peaks originating from SNPs have a reproducible pattern and melting temperatures (46, 47) thus in many cases they should be distinguishable from mutations. Finally, it is noteworthy that s-RT-MELT is a general methodology that may also be applied to isolate mutations using mismatch-cutting enzymes other than Surveyor TM when enzymes with satisfactory properties for mutation detection become available. Detection platforms other than real-time PCR/melting (e.g. DNA microarraybased) may also be envisioned following enzymatic mutation selection.",
