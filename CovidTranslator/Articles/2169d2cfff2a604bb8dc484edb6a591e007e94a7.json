Despite improvements in therapeutic interventions over the last 20 years, in 2010 the 5-year survival rate was ~50% (4, 5) . According to the literature, from 1975-2010, the morbidity and mortality of patients with HNSCC remained at a high level, with >650,000 novel HNSCC cases diagnosed annually worldwide (6) . To date, a series of biomarkers associated with HNSCC including p16, p53, epidermal growth factor receptor and vascular endothelial growth factor have been identified (7) , which have proven to be beneficial in directing diagnosis, prognosis and therapy for this disease. However, these are insufficient to accurately define the pathogenesis of HNSCC. Therefore, there is an urgent requirement to explore and identify novel molecular biomarkers that are associated with HNSCC, as potential therapeutic targets.",

The CPEB family of proteins all confer a similar structure, including highly variable N-termini and relatively conservative C-termini, consisting of two RNA recognition motifs and a zinc finger domain essential for RNA binding (11) (12) (13) . The family of CPEBs, which are widely expressed in vertebrates, are composed of four family members (CPEB1-CPEB4), of which CPEB1 differs from CPEB2-CPEB4 in terms of binding specificity and regulatory domains (11, 14, 15) . Several previous studies have demonstrated that CPEBs are associated with various biological processes, including cell cycle progression (16) , development (17, 18) , cellular senescence (19) and malignant tumor progression (20) . The direct link between the aberrant expression of CPEBs and tumorigenesis has been previously observed in glioblastomas and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDA) (11) .",

Several previous studies researched the association between CPEB4 and various types of cancer, and further validated the crucial involvement of CPEB4 in tumorigenesis. Taken together, these results highlighted the probability that CPEB4-mediated abnormal regulation of downstream target gene expression may be a common mechanism in malignant tumors (21, 22) .

The analysis of CPEB4 gene expression between cancer and normal samples identified statistical differences from three datasets, in which P-values were confirmed to be <0.05.

In the present study, the analysis of the GEO datasets suggested that downregulated CPEB4 expression further decreased in association with increasing histological grades of HNSCC. The differences in CPEB4 protein between different tumor grades were statistically significant. In addition, it was observed that CPEB4 protein levels were lower in high-grade HNSCC compared with that in low-grade HNSCC in TMA. Furthermore, the significant differences between different pathological grades supported our previous conclusions from the GEO dataset. In summary, it was confirmed that CPEB4 expression was negatively correlated with pathological grading, and CPEB4 may represent a valuable marker for HNSCC prognosis.",

            "text": "There are three suggested mechanisms responsible for CPEB4-mediated malignant formation in cancer. CPEB4 may be critically involved in regulating several downstream signaling pathways relevant to proliferation, apoptosis and the cell cycle (31, 34) . Zhong et al (31) reported that knockdown of CPEB4 in CRC cells may contribute to the downregulation of B-cell lymphoma (Bcl) extra-large expression and upregulation of Bcl-2-associated X protein, apoptosis regulation, resulting in the promotion of cell apoptosis and the inhibition of cell proliferation. Xu and Liu (34) demonstrated that CPEB4 accelerated the development of metastasis and invasion through the transforming growth factor-\u03b2 signaling pathway. In addition, the expression of vital genes involved in tumorigenesis were modulated by CPEB4. In pancreatic carcinoma, enhanced CPEB4 expression accelerated the progression of tumor malignancy by increasing the expression level of tissue plasminogen activator mRNA which is an essential component for PDA (21) . Furthermore, CPEB4-induced translational control of vimentin may be responsible for the development of astrocytic tumors (32) . Finally, CPEB4 may act as a downstream target gene of other oncogenes or cancer suppressor genes, and be involved in promoting invasion and metastasis of tumor cells. MicroRNA-203, a tumor suppressor, directly targets CPEB4 and negatively regulates CPEB4 expression to influence the apoptosis signaling pathway in CRC (31) . In addition, microRNA-550a binds to the 3'-untranslated region of the CPEB4 gene to negatively regulate CPEB4 expression, leading to accelerated migration and invasion of liver cancer cells (35) . Furthermore, the downregulation of CPEB4 expression was induced by microRNA-1246 to facilitate migration and invasion of tumor cells in non-small cell lung carcinoma (36) . It may be speculated that microRNA-mediated CPEB4 regulation frequently exists in tumor progression.",

The results of the present study implicated an important function for CPEB4 in HNSCC tumorigenesis, and further investigation is urgently required. In the present study, the evidence from the GEO dataset analysis demonstrated that the methylation status of the CPEB4 gene was significantly higher in HNSCC compared with normal samples. This is indicative of an association between the hypermethylation of CPEB4 and the downregulation of CPEB4 in HNSCC. Thus, is it hypothesized that CPEB4 hypermethylation may be involved in the tumorigenesis of HNSCC by downregulating CPEB4 gene expression. This result warrants further investigation in a follow-up study to confirm the underlying mechanisms involved.",
