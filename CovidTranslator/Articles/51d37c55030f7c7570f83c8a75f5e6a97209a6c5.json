Contact precautions are necessary to reduce the transmission of MDR pathogens. However, the importance of the surrounding environment is not well known. We studied the effects of ICU relocation on MDR respiratory pathogen detection rates and patient outcomes. Methods: Patients admitted to the ICU before and after the relocation were retrospectively analyzed. Baseline patient characteristics, types of respiratory pathogens detected, antibiotics used, and patient outcomes were measured. Results: A total of 463 adult patients admitted to the ICU, 4 months before and after the relocation, were included. Of them, 234 were admitted to the ICU before the relocation and 229 afterward. Baseline characteristics, including age, sex, and underlying comorbidities, did not differ between the two groups. After the relocation, the incidence rate of MDR respiratory pathogen detection decreased from 90.0 to 68.8 cases per 1,000 patient-days, but that difference was statistically insignificant. The use of colistin was significantly reduced from 53.5 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 20.3 to 86.7 days) to 18.7 days (95% CI, 5.6 to 31.7 days). Furthermore, the duration of hospital stay was significantly reduced from a median of 29 days (interquartile range [IQR], 14 to 50 days) to 21 days (IQR, 11 to 39 days). Conclusions: Incidence rates of MDR respiratory pathogen detection were not significantly different before and after ICU relocation. However, ICU relocation could be helpful in reducing the use of antibiotics against MDR pathogens and improving patient outcomes.",

The mortality rates of hospital-acquired pneumonia and ventilator-associated pneumonia are higher than those of community-acquired pneumonia and healthcare-associated pneumonia [3] . Furthermore, MDR pathogens can increase the mortality rates of ICU-acquired pneumonia [4] . Therefore, controlling the pre valence of MDR pathogens in the ICU is mandatory for patient safety.",

A prospective study from China reported MRSA incidence to be 13.9 cases per 100 ICU admissions [11] , and a retrospective study from Canada reported MRSA incidence to be 13.4-35.6 cases per 1,000 patient-days [12] . Our study revealed 15.8 MRSA cases per 100 admissions (or 22.2 cases per 1,000 patient-days). The use of piperacillin/tazobactam, glycopeptide, and quinolone was similar to that reported in previous studies, but in our center, the use of carbapenem was higher and that of third-generation cephalosporin was lower than previously reported [11, 13] .",

The IR seemed to drop right after the relocation but increased again as time passed, especially in June 2017, when the IR of MDR respiratory microorganisms was the highest in our study period, mostly CRAB and MRSA. Although the exact reason for the sudden outbreak of CRAB and MRSA during June could not be clarified due to the study's retrospective design, some factors could be considered. Among the patients admitted to the MICU during June, a higher proportion were placed on mechanical ventilators (32/43 patients, 74.4%) than in other months (282/420 patients, 67.1%). The duration of ventilator application also tended to be slightly longer in June (mean, 7.3 days) than in the other months (mean, 6.9 days) although that difference was not statistically significant. The application of mechanical ventilators and more ventilator-days has previously been associated with a higher risk of MDR Acinetobacter baumannii colonization [14] . Once colonization has been established, the next patient admitted to the same environment might have been exposed to an elevated risk of developing that infection, especially with Acinetobacter species [15] . Furthermore, contamination of healthcare workers' protective gowns and gloves during routine management of patients can be frequent with Acinetobacter species and MRSA [16] . Those factors could explain why the colonization rate of MDR microorganisms increased with time, even after relocation.",

It is therefore possible that a significant proportion of patients might have had CRAB \"colonization\" in their respiratory system rather an infection with \"pathogenic\" CRAB, resulting in a decrease in the use of colistin.",

            "text": "We also found a shortened hospital stay among patients after the MICU relocation. Because the baseline characteristics (age, sex, APACHE II score, and underlying disease) did not differ significantly before and after the relocation, this difference in clinical outcome could result from changes associated with the MICU relocation, including the reduced use of colistin. Several retrospective studies [19, 20] have reported that Acinetobacter baumannii infection is associated with a longer hospital stay. Inappropriate use of antibiotics during the initial days of a hospital-stay is known to be associated with longer hospital stays [21] , and that inappropriate use is most commonly associated with Acinetobacter species [22] . Although mortality rates did not differ after the relocation in the present study, there are contradicting reports on differences in mortality rates according to Acinetobacter infections [19, 20, 23, 24] . The inconsistency between the duration of hospitalization and mortality rates could be caused by the low virulence of Acinetobacter species [25] . This study has several limitations. First, this was a retrospective study from a single center. Information about recent antibiotics use, adequate antibiotics use, or a history of MDR infections could not be obtained. Second, it was difficult to discriminate between colonizers and pathogens due to the study's retrospective nature. Our results must be replicated in future prospective studies to be generalizable to other clinical settings. Third, due to the center's training curriculum, the annual turnover of resident doctors occurs in March. Therefore, resident doctors in February had nearly 2 years of practice as physicians, whereas those in March had only 1 year of practice and no experience as ICU doctors. That turnover might have affected the clinical outcomes after the MICU relocation [26] . However, the number of MDR pathogens detected in the previous year did not reveal significant monthly variability (Supplementary Table 1 ), which implies that the annual turnover of residents might not have affected the rates of MDR pathogen detection. Fourth, environmental sampling of the MICU before and after the relocation was not conducted. Collecting that information in future studies could support our results.",
