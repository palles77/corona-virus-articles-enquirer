Faecal specimens from 18 non-diarrhoeal control patients were also examined, of which three contained rotavirus. Forty-three (72 per cent) gastroenteritis patients had rotavirus detectable in stools by electron microscopy or immune electron microscopy. Of the remainder, 17 patients were regarded as having non-rotavirus diarrhoea. Enterotoxigenic Esch. coli. was isolated from seven patients of whom six yielded stable toxin producers (ST+), four labile toxin producers (LT+) and two dual toxigenic strains (ST+/LT+). All ST+ isolates appeared to be of low enterotoxigenicity as indicated by low gut weight/carcass weight ratios in the infant mouse assay.",

This was alluded to (without reference) in a leading article (1977) but a respiratory mode of transmission of rotavirus was not suggested. From this study there is clinical evidence for this, but the hypothesis would also support a similar mode of transmission of non-rotavirus gastroenteritis and its largely unknown cause or causes. It should be noted that this study took place during winter when respiratory admissions are most common. However, respiratory symptoms and signs were also a common finding in Washington children with rotavirus gastroenteritis reporte d by Rodriguez, Kim, Arrobio, Brandt, Chanock Kapikian, Wyatt and Parrott (1977) and Lewis, Parry, Davies, Parry, Mott, Dourmashkin, Sanderson, Tyrrell and Valman (1979) showed a significant excess of rotavirus infected children with respiratory illness. A female predominance in the younger age groups affected by rotavirus was noted. The finding of rotavirus or non-agglutinable rotavirus in nondiarrhoeal stools in all age groups suggests asymptomatic infection. This is contrary to current evidence elsewhere except that newborn infants in neonatal units appear to be colonised by rotavirus with quite variable consequences (Chrystie Totterdell and Banatvala, 1975; Totterdell, Chrystie and Banatvala 1976; Murphy, Albrey and Crewe, 1977) . The predominance of Maoris and Pacific Islanders in the younger age groups with or without gastroenteritis may be a reflection of socio-economic, nutritional or other factors. Evidence of spread within families was seen with equal frequency in Maoris and Caucasians. Rotavirus more often spread to siblings than other agents of gastroenteritis.",

The finding of enterotoxigenic isolates in control patients indicates that LT and ST plasmids are probably Circulating freely in the community, and as pointed out by Pickering, Du Pont, Evans, Evans and Olarte (1977) , asymptomatic subjects are probably important in transmission of infection. Combinations of enteric pathogens isolated from gastroenteritis patients and control patients were a common finding. The isolation of multiple enteric pathogens supports the findings of Evans, Olarte, Du Pont, Evans, Galindo, Portnoy and Conklin (1977) ; Schoub, Greef, Lecatsas, Prozesky, Hay, Prinsloo and Ballard (1977) ; Echeverria, Ho, Blacklow, Quinnan, Portnoy, Olson, Conklin, Du Pont and Cross (1977) ; and Madeley, Cosgrove, Bell and Fallon (1977) . Rotavirus was responsible for a large proportion of non-bacterial gastroenteritis in most age groups accounting for 74 per cent of diarrhoeal illness in the six months to less than two year age group, and 77 per cent in the two to six year group. In the youngest age group (less than six months) its prevalence was 65 per cent. Rotavirus' high overall prevalence (72 per cent) may be explained by the winter season during which the study took place. From overseas reports (Middleton, Szymanski, Abbott, Bortolussi and Hamilton, 1974; Bryden, Davies, Hadley, Flewett, Morris and Oliver, 1975; Davidson, Bishop, Townley, Holmes and Riuck, 1975; Kapikian, Kim, Wyatt, Cline, Arrobio, Brandt, Rodriguez, Sack, Chanock and Parrott, 1976) , rotavirus diarrhoea appears to occur at the cooler times of the year in temperate climates but neonates in Sydney showed no seasonal variation of rotavirus excretion (Murphy, Albrey and Crewe, 1977) . It remains uncertain whether seasonal variation of rotavirus infection occurs in New Zealand. However, this high detection rate may be reflected by the use of IEM. The increased sensitivity of IEM over EM was shown by the detection of rotavirus in four patients which would otherwise have been missed by the latter method. Rotaviruses of two gastroenteritis patients and one control patient failed to agglutinate on IEM. The particles were identical in structure to agglutinable rotavirus and the severity of attributable disease appeared to be similar. Zissis and Lambert (1978) have shown that IEM is a valid means of serotyping rotavirus. At least two serotypes of rotavirus (one predominant) were responsible for a large proportion of paediatric gastroenteritis admissions in Auckland at the time of the study.",

The proximity of these small isometric particles to rotavirus may only be an accidental encounter in the overcrowded tube journey to the outside world. But that this was seen with a frequency of 54 per cent suggests that some design was involved in their meeting. It is possible that these particles represent small aggregates of coat proteins. They have not been described previously. The author has not seen these particles in rotavfl'us positive specimens from patients at St. Thomas' Hospital. The capsid protein described by Flewett (1977) as an association with rotaviruses of various animal species was seen in all types of stool whether or not rotavirus was detectable. This material failed to agglutinate on IEM suggesting that it is not of rotavirus origin.",

It is possible that these infections were due to rotavirus excreted in numbers not great enough for detection even by IEM of faecal viral pellets. The features of most cases of rotavirus gastroenteritis and non-rotavirus gastroenteritis were so similar that a separate aetiology for each group could not be distinguished on clinical evidence. That only one stool specimen from each patient was examined may explain negative results, but the overall yield of potential pathogens is higher or similar to 6ther published studies already cited where multiple specimens had been collected. The role of enteropathogenic serotypes of Esch. coli (EPEC) and their relationship with enterotoxin production may cast some light on the area of aetiologically unexplained gastroenteritis. Data on EPEC serotypes is being prepared for publication.",
