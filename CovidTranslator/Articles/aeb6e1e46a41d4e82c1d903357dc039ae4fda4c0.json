Infectivity-neutralizing (IN) and hemagglutinin-inhibiting (HAI) activities were tested. Sequential serum samples, collected during the onset of the respiratory coronavirus infection and at weekly intervals for 5 weeks thereafter, had significantly higher IN and HAI titers for antigens of RBCV strain 97TXSF-Lu15-2 than for the wild-type and the highly cell culture-adapted EBCV strains, with P values ranging from <0.0001 to 0.0483. The IN and HAI antibody responses against the two EBCV strains did not differ significantly, but the lowest titers were detected with EBCV strain L9-81.",

These isolates are referred to as respiratory bovine coronaviruses (RBCV) (18, 19) . The enteropathogenic potential of coronaviruses was identified previously when these viruses were isolated from diarrhea fluid or intestinal samples from neonatal calves with severe diarrhea (7, 13) . In addition, coronaviruses were implicated in winter dysentery of adult cattle (14) . These coronaviruses are referred to as enteropathogenic bovine coronaviruses (EBCV). Significant phenotypic, antigenic, and genetic differences separate the newly recognized RBCV from EBCV (2, 3, 11, 18) . Furthermore, infectivityneutralizing (IN) monoclonal antibodies (MAb) distinguished between the EBCV wild-type strain LY138-3 and the highly cell culture-adapted EBCV strain L9-81, as well as the Norden vaccine strain (8) .",

The spike (S) and the hemagglutinin esterase (HE) glycoproteins of the five structural proteins function in the infectious process through adsorption and coadsorption to the receptors on susceptible host cells (5, 6) . The S and HE glycoproteins are both capable of hemagglutinating rodent and chicken red blood cells (RBC). The HE but not S glycoprotein facilitates the release of viruses adsorbed to RBC in the receptor-destroying enzyme (RDE) test mediated by an acetylesterase (AE) component of the HE (15-17, 20, 21) . These two glycoproteins induce IN and hemagglutinin-inhibiting (HAI) antibodies. The objectives of the present investigations were to assess the antibody responses of cattle during a naturally occurring and experimentally monitored infection that had induced severe pneumonic signs, including SFP. The kinetics of IN and HAI antibody responses of these cattle were analyzed with antigens of an endogenous RBCV strain, which were isolated from lung tissue from a fatally infected bovine from this SFP epizootic, and with antigens of the wild-type and the highly cell culture-adapted EBCV strains. The analysis was conducted with sera sequentially collected from cattle which had primary and secondary immune responses to the RBCV infection.",

Nasal swab samples were taken for virological and bacteriological studies, while blood samples for serum harvest were collected for immunological investigations. The cattle were separated into five response groups based on clinical signs of respiratory tract diseases and results of RBCV isolations (10, 12, 18, 19) . Response groups 1 and 5 were utilized in the present analysis. Response group 1 included 72 cattle that exhibited clinical signs of respiratory tract disease and that nasally shed RBCV on day 0, day 7, or both. Seven randomly selected cattle of the group shedding RBCV on day 7 were investigated in detail. Seven calves in response group 5 were also included in these serological investigations because they remained clinically healthy and RBCV isolation negative during the epizootic and the 5-week follow-up period. To analyze sequential serum samples from the 14 cattle selected for their IN and HAI antibodies, we used antigens of three specific strains of bovine coronaviruses.",

This experiment also provided an excellent opportunity to compare antibody reactivities with both the wild-type RBCV and the highly cell culture-adapted and wild-type EBCV strains in serum samples collected from cattle involved in a naturally occurring RBCV infection. These conditions differ from experimentally induced infections that routinely involve giving virus inocula adapted to, and propagated in, cell cultures. Importantly, the IN and HAI antibody responses against RBCV were significantly greater than those detected with the wild-type EBCV strain LY138-3 and the highly cell culture-adapted EBCV. The EBCV strain L9-81 is virtually identical to the Norden vaccine strain that is used in attempts to protect against intestinal coronavirus infections of neonatal calves. Antigens of the highly cell culture-adapted EBCV strains reacted minimally with antibodies induced by naturally occurring RBCV infections. These findings call for analysis and a search for appropriate antigens in efforts to immunize cattle against these currently prevailing RBCV infections.",
