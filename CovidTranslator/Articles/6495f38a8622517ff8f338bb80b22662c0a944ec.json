These two methods are simple, effective, and economic due to the need of only one sensor. The methods are validated by a three-dimensional case study. The effects of the sampling time, the sampling interval, and the sensor response time and measurement error on the location identification of the contaminant source are analyzed. The results indicate that the identification performance of the MDD method is better than that of the MCC method; however, the MDD requires a fast response and high-accuracy sensor. MCC method not only has smaller effects of response time and measurement error compared with the MDD method but it also does not require highperformance (accuracy) sensor and it is not suitable for fast identification in a short time. For source location identification, the two methods need to properly choose sampling time, sampling interval, and response time.",

The multi-zone model was used to calculate the airflow and contaminant transport. This method only provides the macroscopic information about contaminant transport; however, it is difficult to find out the exact source location and intensity (Cai et al. 2012) . Moreover, it is found that the Bayesian method is time-consuming and it requires several sensors and thousands of monitor data. Therefore, simple, rapid, and economical method for contaminant source location identification is yet required urgently. Cai et al. (2012) developed a method to identify the location of contaminant source with the help of CFD simulation. In this method, good identification results were obtained by applying five sensors. The method is time-consuming to analyze the large numbers of monitor data. The maximum correlation coefficient (MCC) method was adopted to identify the point contaminant source location in the groundwater and river (Sidauruk et al. 1988; Chen et al. 2011 ). In our knowledge, however, the application of the MCC method with the CFD simulation database in the identification of indoor contaminant source location has not been reported.",
