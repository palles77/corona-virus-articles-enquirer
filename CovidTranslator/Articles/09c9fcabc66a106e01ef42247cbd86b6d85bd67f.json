            "text": "24 A subset of intracellular mono-ADP-ribosyltransferases diphtheria toxin-like (ARTDs, aka 25 mono-PARPs) is induced by type I interferons. Some of these mono-ARTDs feature antiviral 26 activity while certain RNA viruses, including Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), encode mono-ADP-27 ribosylhydrolases, suggesting a role for mono-ADP-ribosylation (MARylation) in host-virus 28 conflicts. CHIKV expresses four non-structural proteins (nsP1-nsP4), with nsP3 containing a 29 macrodomain that hydrolyzes and thereby reverses protein MARylation in vitro and in cells. 30 This de-MARylation activity is essential as hydrolase inactivating mutations result in 31 replication defective virus. However, the substrates of MARylation during CHIKV infection 32 are unknown and thus it is unclear how the macrodomain contributes to virus replication 33 and how mono-ARTD-dependent MARylation confers antiviral immunity. We identified 34 ARTD10 and ARTD12 as restriction factors for CHIKV replication in a catalytic activity-35 dependent manner. CHIKV replication requires processing of the non-structural polyprotein 36 nsP1-4 by the nsP2-encoded protease and the assembly of the four individual nsPs into a 37 functional replication complex. Expression of ARTD10 and ARTD12 resulted in a reduction 38 of processed nsPs. Similarly, MAR hydrolase inactive CHIKV replicon mutants revealed a 39 decrease in processed nsPs, comparable to an nsP2 protease defective mutant. This 40 suggested that the macrodomain contributes to nsP2 protease activity. In support, a 41 hydrolase-deficient virus was complemented by a protease-deficient virus. We 42 hypothesized that MARylation regulates the proteolytic function of nsP2. Indeed, we found 43 that nsP2 is MARylated by ARTD10. This inhibited nsP2 protease activity, thereby preventing 44 polyprotein processing and consequently virus replication. This inhibition was antagonized 45 by the MAR hydrolase activity of nsP3. Together, our findings provide a mechanistic 46 explanation for the need of the viral MAR hydrolase for efficient replication of CHIKV. 47 Author Summary 48 Infectious diseases still pose major health threats. Especially fast evolving viruses find ever 49 new strategies to manipulate the immune response. With climate warming and increased 50 human mobility vector-borne pathogens like Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) spread and cause 51 world-wide epidemics. Beyond the acute phase, CHIKV patients regularly suffer from chronic 52 rheumatism. This entails a decline in life quality and an economic burden. To date no drugs 53 are approved and the mode of pathogenesis remains elusive. Here we describe a mechanistic 54 function of the CHIKV nsP3 macrodomain. We found that the viral nsP2 is mono-ADP-55 ribosylated interfering with its auto-proteolytic function. The nsP3 macrodomain removes this 56 modification and restores the protease activity that is essential for replication. Because 57 macrodomains are highly conserved they might represent broad antiviral targets. 58 59 Introduction 60 Upon viral infection host cells initiate an antiviral immune response. Because the regulation 61 of protein function through post-translational modifications (PTMs) is among the quickest 62 mechanisms to adapt to challenges such as viral infections, PTMs display an essential part of 63 antiviral signaling. Viruses have developed multifaceted strategies to evade or even hijack 64 cellular mechanisms, e.g. encoding proteins that regulate PTMs and thereby counteract the 65 antiviral reaction of the host [1-5]. Recent findings have elaborated on the role of intracellular 66 ADP-ribosylation at the host-pathogen interface [6-12]. ADP-ribosylation is an ancient PTM of 67 proteins and intracellularly mainly catalyzed by members of the ADP-ribosyltransferase 68 diphtheria toxin-like (ARTD) family (also known as poly-ADP-ribosylpolymerases (PARPs)), 69",

Based on their 71 . : bioRxiv preprint 4 catalytic features the ARTDs are subdivided into three classes. The first class contains ARTD1, 72 2, 5, and 6, which are capable of transferring multiple ADP-ribose moieties in an iterative 73 process and thereby forming long polymers. This results in poly-ADP-ribosylation (PARylation) 74 of substrate proteins. The second and largest class is defined by members that are restricted 75 to mono-ADP-ribosylation (MARylation) (ARTD3, 4,(7)(8)(9)(10)(11)(12)(14)(15)(16)(17), whereas the third 76 group is defined by ARTD13, which lacks the ability to bind NAD + and thus is catalytically 77 inactive [18]. 78 79 PARylation, arguably best known for its function in DNA damage response, has also been 80 linked to chromatin organization, ribosome biogenesis, telomere maintenance, signaling 81 processes and cell death [1, 19, 20]. In contrast functions of MARylation are less well 82 understood but expanding with links to DNA damage repair, gene expression, signaling, stress 83 response and cell death [1, 21]. Recent findings indicate a role for MARylation in host-84 pathogen conflicts [1, 21, 22]. The expression of several mono-ARTDs is triggered by type I 85 interferons (IFNs) or pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), like LPS, as part of an 86 innate immune response to pathogens [6, 8, 11,[23][24][25].

MARylation of nsP2 by ARTD10 inhibits its proteolytic activity, which 132 supports our observation of defective polyprotein processing.

This suggests that the capability 143 to reverse MARylation is essential for proper virus replication and that mono-ARTDs function 144 as antiviral host factors. To identify mono-ARTDs that potentially affect CHIKV replication we 145 performed knockdown experiments (Fig. 1a) . HEK293 cells were transfected with siRNA oligo 146 pools targeting IFNa-inducible mono-ARTDs (Supplementary Fig. 1a and [6] ), such as ARTD10, 147 ARTD12, ARTD8, or ARTD7, prior to transfection with CHIKV replicon RNA. This replicon 148 encodes the four non-structural proteins but lacks the open reading frame of the structural 149 proteins. Instead, the subgenomic promotor of the replicon controls the expression of Gaussia 150 luciferase, which we analyzed as surrogate for virus replication (Fig. 1b) [46] . Replication was 151 analyzed at 9, 24 and 30 hours post transfection (hpt) (Fig. 1a) . At the early time point ARTD10 152 and ARTD12 knockdowns showed a significant increase in replication, while the effect 153 decreased at later time points. Knockdowns of ARTD8 or ARTD7 only allowed for minor 154 increases in replication compared to control (Fig. 1a) . Based on these findings we decided to 155 focus on ARTD10 and ARTD12 and their role in CHIKV replication. We employed HEK293 cells 156 stably expressing TAP-tagged ARTD10 or ARTD12, either wildtype (wt) or catalytically inactive 157 mutants (Supplementary Fig 1b, c and [14] ), to test whether overexpression of these proteins 158 interferes with CHIKV replication (Fig. 1c-g) . Protein expression was induced by doxycycline 159 (Dox) treatment prior to transfection with replicon RNA. Doxycycline treatment itself had little 160 effect on CHIKV replication ( Supplementary Fig. 1d ), still control cells were always treated with 161 doxycycline as well. ARTD10 and ARTD12 reduced replication two-fold, while the respective 162 catalytically inactive variants, ARTD10-G888W(GW) or ARTD12-H564Y(HY), showed little 163 effect (Fig. 1c,d) , suggesting that the MARylation activity of these enzymes is required to 164 .

These differences are not attributed to variations in protein 165 levels, as the mutants were expressed more efficiently compared to the wt proteins (Fig. 1e, 166 Supplementary Fig. 1c) . Similarly, HEK293 cells transiently expressing ARTD10 or ARTD12 167 showed reduced replicon replication, whereas no influence of the PARylating ARTD1 or 168 ARTD14 enzymes, which do not respond to IFNa, was observed ( Supplementary Fig. 1e,f) . 169",

In contrast, ARTD10-GW enhanced viral replication, hinting at a dominant 179 negative effect and thereby demonstrating dependency on catalytic activity of ARTD10 as a 180 CHIKV restriction factor.

Therefore, we made use of EGFP-encoding variants of the replicon ( 2 EGFP 189 and 3 EGFP, in which EGFP is integrated after amino acids 466 or 383 in nsP2 or nsP3, 190 respectively Fig. 1b and [48] ), enabling us to visualize processed nsP2 or nsP3 proteins using a 191 GFP-specific antibody (Fig. 2) . HEK293 cells stably expressing ARTD10 or ARTD10-GW were 192 employed. These cells were then transfected with or without ARTD12 expressing constructs 193 and induced for ARTD10 expression prior to transfection with 3 EGFP replicon RNA. The 194 analysis of whole cell lysates showed a reduction in processed nsP3 in presence of either the 195 enzymatically active ARTD12 or ARTD10. NsP3 was further reduced when both enzymes were 196 expressed (Fig. 2a) . These findings led us hypothesize that MARylation hampers polyprotein 197 processing. Proper polyprotein processing is a prerequisite for RNA replication [43], consistent 198 with impaired replication of a mutant replicon with an inactive protease (nsP2-C478A/S482A, 199 referred to as CASA) (Fig. 2b,c) [44]. Similarly, a functionally active macrodomain is needed for 200 replication as substitution of key amino acids in the macrodomain (D10A, V33E, for details 201 concerning the replicon construct see Fig. 1b ) interfered with replication ( Fig. 2b ,c) [6, 9] . To 202 analyze how the lack of a functional macrodomain compromised replication, we determined 203 the abundance of proteolytically processed nsP2 (Fig. 2d , for the specificity of the antibody 204 see Supplementary Fig. 3a ,b). As expected, nsP2 was detectable after transfection of the 205 wildtype (wt) but not the CASA mutant replicon (Fig. 2d) . Similarly, nsP2 was not detectable, 206 when expressed from hydrolase deficient replicons (Fig. 2d) , implying a defect in nsP2-207 mediated polyprotein processing in the absence of MAR hydrolase activity. This observation 208 was corroborated with the 3 EGFP and 2 EGFP replicons and mutants thereof ( Fig. 2e-g) . 209",

Co-expression of the nsP2-459-798 protease domain partially rescued 239 replication of the CASA mutant suggesting that indeed polyprotein synthesis takes place 240 ( Supplementary Fig. 4a-c) . In contrast, co-expression of nsP3 or the isolated nsP3 241 macrodomain was not sufficient to rescue replication of a hydrolase deficient replicon mutant 242 (Supplementary Fig. 4d-f ). To overcome possible differences in the subcellular localization of 243 replication hubs and plasmid-expressed nsP3 macrodomain, we fused the macrodomain to an 244 anti-GFP-nanobody to enhance targeting to sites of replication of the EGFP encoding 245 replicons.

Whereas the overall amount of GFP-248 positive cells when transfected with the V33E mutant was low compared to the wildtype and 249 stayed unaffected by co-expression of GFP-nanobody-nsP3-macrodomain (Fig. 3i) , we 250 observed an increase in GFP intensity dependent on hydrolytic activity of the GFP-nanobody 251 fusion protein (Fig. 3j, k, Supplementary Fig. 5 ).

Our previous studies indicated 262 that ARTD10-dependent MARylation impairs the catalytic activity of the kinase GSK3b, which 263 is antagonized by cellular MAR hydrolases [37, 49] . Furthermore, MARylation is reported to 264 affect protein-protein interactions, mRNA stability and translation [1]. Following our 265 hypothesis, we determined the consequences of MARylation on the protease activity of nsP2, 266 which is responsible for polyprotein processing [43] . Therefore, we tested whether nsP2 267 serves as substrate for mono-ARTDs.

            "text": "Further ARTD10, ARTD12 and ARTD14 downregulate cellular translation in cells infected with 342 VEEV, which in the case of ARTD12 depends on catalytic activity [8] . ARTD12 has also been 343 identified to restrict Zika virus (ZIKV) replication, which is mediated by depletion of the ZIKV 344 non-structural proteins NS1 and NS3 [26] . Dependent on its catalytic activity, ARTD12 seems 345 to promote poly-ADP-ribosylation (PARylation) of these two viral proteins. PAR chains in turn 346 are argued to serve as scaffold to recruit E3 Ubiquitin-ligases that modify NS1 and NS3 by K48-347 linked polyubiquitination and thereby enable their proteasomal degradation [26] . Indeed, this 348 concept has already been established for PARylation mediated by ARTD5 and 6 (tankyrase 1 349 and 2, respectively) [1]. More than 70 substrates have been identified to be regulated through 350 PAR-mediated poly-ubiquitination [54] . The proposed mechanism is that ARTD12, as it is 351 limited to MARylation, modifies NS1 and NS3, which serves as a seeding event for polymer 352 forming ARTDs, possibly ARTD5 or 6 [26] . However, the effect of MARylation on CHIKV 353 replication seems to be different as demonstrated by experiments with inhibitors of 354 proteasomal and lysosomal pathways in this study (Fig. 3a,b) . In addition to the ZIKV proteins, 355 the nucleocapsid protein of Coronavirus (CoV) was recently suggested to be ADP-ribosylated 356 . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license author/funder.

It will be interesting to identify the enzyme that catalyzes this 357 modification and moreover to define the molecular consequences, for example on capsid 358 formation. 359",

Our study provides a mechanistic explanation for the 373 inhibitory role of MARylation in CHIKV replication and establishes the concept that ARTD10-374 dependent MARylation of the viral protease inhibits its function, which is antagonized by the 375 viral macrodomain.

Evaluation of the experiments was 622 performed with the FlowJo software (BD Bioscience). 623 624 Virus infection and analysis of replication 625 Infectious CHIKV, strain LR2006-OPY, was produced by in vitro transcription of the linearized 626 full-length viral genome including an EGFP under a second subgenomic promotor [47] and 627 subsequent electroporation of the RNA in BHK-21 cells. The virus was passaged once in BHK-628 21 cells. Infections were performed under BSL-3 conditions using MOI determined by titration 629 on HEK293T cells. Cells were fixed in 4% PFA and infection efficiency was measured as the 630 proportion of EGFP-positive cells 24 and 48 hours post infection by flow cytometry using a BD 631 FACSLyric instrument (BD Bioscience). Evaluation of the experiments was performed with the 632 FACSSuite v1.2.1.5657 software (BD Bioscience). 633 634",
