Methods: A technique was developed to visualize exhaled aerosols during simulated patients' use of oxygen masks in a health care setting and tested using the simple, the nonrebreathing, and the Venturi oxygen masks. A smoke tracer was introduced into one of the lungs of the model to enable it to mix with the incoming oxygen and then to be further inhaled/exhaled by the model according to a variety of realistic respiratory settings (14, 24, and 30 breaths per minute, with tidal volumes of 500, 330, 235 mL, respectively) and oxygen supply flow rates (between 6 and 15 liters per minute). Digital recordings of these exhaled airflow patterns allowed approximate distances to be estimated for the extent of the visible exhaled air plumes emitted from each oxygen mask type at these settings. Results: It was found that the simple, the nonrebreathing, and the Venturi-type oxygen masks produced exhaled smoke plumes over minimum distances of 0.08 to 0.21 m, 0.23 to 0.36 m, and 0.26 to 0.40 m, respectively. Conclusion: Health care workers may therefore consider any area within at least 0.4 m of a patient using such oxygen masks to be a potential nosocomial hazard zone.

            "text": "Since the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreaks, there has been an increased interest in aerosol transmission of infectious agents. Several reviews and studies discussing the potential for aerosol transmission of various infectious agents have since been published, 1,2 including those on SARS-associated coronavirus, [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] varicella zoster virus (causing chickenpox), 12 tuberculosis, 13 and influenza. [14] [15] [16] Others have studied the potential for health care procedures to act as generators or amplifiers of sources of infection, particularly the use of oxygen masks and ventilation methods. [17] [18] [19] Visualization of airflows is difficult, and recent techniques have involved the use of tracer particles of nebulized liquid droplets in a cloud 17 or solid particulates in a smoke. 18, 19 Furthermore, the quantitative analysis of such suspended liquid or solid particles is difficult because it depends, ultimately, on their visibility on the recorded image. Although the movement of these tracer particles may follow the airflow movements precisely, [18] [19] [20] [21] the exhaled liquid (including mucous) droplets from a potentially infected patient will probably not do so, especially because evaporation will be continuously changing its size and mass. 2, 22 Such limitations notwithstanding, the visualization of exhaled air plumes from oxygen masks in health care settings is still useful for planning the control of potentially infectious aerosols, not only for a possible influenza pandemic but for daily encounters with tuberculosis (TB), measles, and chickenpox in hospitals and other health care and community environments. Here, we present some estimates of dispersal distances of smoke-visualized airflows produced using a realistic lung model at a variety of physiologic settings with the simple, the nonrebreathing, and the Venturi-type oxygen masks with different air supply rates.",

To estimate the error in making such distance measurements from the 2-dimensional (2-D) screen images that were enlarged and printed to perform this measurement, the Laerdal trainer was again set up with the 3 types of oxygen masks, with wooden rods. The rods were actually tapered chopsticks, and the pointed ends conveniently allowed their secure insertion into the particularly small exit holes of the simple and nonrebreathing masks. These rods were of known lengths and were positioned to represent approximately the directions of the chin-to-chest (x1) and exhaled smoke plume (y1) measurements for each mask. These smoke plumes were emitted in a roughly conically shaped space, with the cone apex adjacent to the oxygen mask, and the rod in the y1 direction was positioned to lie within this space, accordingly. The Laerdal trainer with the mask and attached rods was carefully positioned to be as similar as possible to that of the corresponding captured digital image for the same mask with its exhaled smoke plumes then photographed at a resolution of 1024 3 768 pixels with a digital camera (Canon Ixus II, Canon Inc., Tokyo, Japan).",

It was estimated by knowing the real value of the chin-to-chest distance (x2 in B) on the Laerdal trainer, the measured screen distances of x1 and y1 (in A), and the relative error of these measured screen distances, estimated by the ratio (x1/x2)/(y1/y2), where the real lengths of the wooden rods, x2 and y2, were known.

Somogyi et al 17 used a very simple setup, using flash photography, to illustrate the potential dangers of exhaled airflows. Inhaled saline mist was exhaled through 3 commonly used types of oxygen masks, demonstrating that exhaled plumes could spread infectious aerosols over a distance of approximately 1 to 2 head diameters, ie, up to approximately 0.3 m, where an average head diameter is approximately 0.13 to 0.16 m. 23 Hui et al 18, 19 used a 2-D green (527-nm wavelength) laser sheet to illuminate oil-based smoke particles (,1-mm diameter) to illustrate the dispersion of potentially infectious exhaled plumes from a variety of respiratory support devices and procedures, including oxygen masks and noninvasive positive pressure ventilation. From these latter 2 studies, the estimated dispersal distances of exhaled, potentially infectious, air from patients using such respiratory assist devices were in the range of 0.40 to 0.50 m. These studies used a more sophisticated lighting system with monochromatic, coherent laser light-sheet. They also tested a more limited range or a totally different respiratory assistance setup, ie, a simple oxygen mask at 1 respiratory setting (RR 5 12 breaths/min; TV 5 0.5 L; oxygen flow rate 5 4 L/ min), 18 and noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation. 19 This present study also differs from those of Hui et al 18, 19 in that it was performed in a more typical isolation room environment, with ambient lighting and a background ventilation rate of 12 air changes per hour. The exact effect of the 12 air changes per hour on the extent of the smoke plumes is difficult to quantify, although their dispersal patterns as shown here may be more representative of those seen in isolation rooms commonly used for patients suspected to be infected with respiratory pathogens of higher morbidity/mortality. It is interesting that the extent of visible smoke dispersion recorded is similar in all these setups (up to a maximum of approximately 0.4 m from the patient), which may well be due to the different lighting conditions used, particularly between this present study and that of Hui et al. 18, 19 With the more intense laser-sheet lighting used by Hui et al, it is likely that further distances would have been recorded for the limits of visible smoke dispersal, at the higher oxygen flow rates used in this study. Hence, the 0.4-m distance estimated here can only be considered a lower limit for the extent of any ''nosocomial hazard zone,'' as defined by the visible dispersal limits of the smoke tracer used here.",

Somogyi et al 17 presented their results in a slightly different manner by stating that the visible cloud (or smoke), in fact, indicates the minimum distance traveled by the exhaled air, which may be a more cautious approach that can be used to interpret the results presented in this study. Hence, from this study, those of Hui et al, 18, 19 and to a lesser extent that of Somoygi et al, 17 there is a suggestion of a minimum baseline ''nosocomial hazard zone'' extending to at least 0.4 m away from patients using such respiratory support devices. It is likely to extend farther than this, but this could not be quantified from this study. Such a ''nosocomial hazard zone'' may well increase in size when the patient coughs or sneezes.

Although direct contact transmission predominates as the main route of nosocomial transmission for most pathogens, the relevance of long-distance transmission has become a concern in the design of new hospitals. This has led to an increased number of single-bed, negative pressure isolation rooms, as well as greater distances between beds in such new facilities. 25 Since the 2003 SARS outbreaks, the modeling of airflows in health care institutions has been performed in a variety of ways and on different scales by both engineers 7-9,26-29 and physicians. 3, 5, 6, 12, [17] [18] [19] Studies assessing the effectiveness of personal protective equipment, such as masks, have also been performed. 30 With influenza, the relative risk from airborne of contact transmission is still being hotly debated, and even existing infection control guidelines have been questioned in this regard. 16 The airborne route of influenza has been well documented, [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] so why do some guidelines still treat influenza as a short-range rather than a long-range airborne disease? 16 Perhaps the most useful debate has been published by the UK Health Protection Agency's Guidance for Pandemic Influenza that comprehensively summarizes the evidence for the different transmission routes of influenza. It still concludes, however, that influenza is mostly transmitted by large droplets and direct contact. 15 Tellier 16 goes one step further and presents a convincing argument as to why influenza should be considered as a true airborne infection and recommends N95 respirators as the minimum level of personal protective equipment for the purposes of pandemic influenza planning.",

However, when a new respiratory pathogen arises, with the potential to cause high morbidity and mortality, eg, SARS and more recently avian H5N1 or possibly some other future pandemic influenza strain, this baseline data should be useful in reducing nosocomial transmission and enhancing health care workers' awareness of the risks posed by the use of such respiratory assist devices. In addition, it is known that, unlike SARS-associated coronavirus, influenza may be presymptomatically transmissible. 36, 37 Hence, there is a convincing argument for all staff working in the immediate vicinity, ie, within a zone of 0.4 m, of such patients, to be wearing N95 masks as their minimum personal protective equipment during an influenza pandemic or when dealing with any other respiratory pathogen with the potential to cause high morbidity and mortality.",
