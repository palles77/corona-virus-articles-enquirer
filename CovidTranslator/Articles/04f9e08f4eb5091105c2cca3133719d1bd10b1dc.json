            "text": "Influenza, commonly known as the flu, is a severe infectious disease accounting for between 250 000 and 500 000 deaths worldwide every year. Millions of people died in the influenza pandemic of 1918, one of the worst epidemic disasters in recorded human history. 1 The life style of modern society, including overcrowded cities and rapid global transportation, has resulted in dissemination of influenza and generation of novel virus strains. In the past year, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced a level-6 alert for the influenza A (H1N1) pandemic, the highest level of disease outbreak, because of the sustained spread of this new virus on a global scale. 2 The world was fortunate not to have experienced another devastating influenza epidemic, because the fatality rate of the new virus strain was similar to seasonal influenza virus. 3 However, there remains an inevitability of a new influenza pandemic, which could be highly infectious and as deadly as the 1918 influenza pandemic. Thus, it is necessary, although challenging to detect the onset of a new influenza epidemic, to allow the government to make timely and proper interventions to reduce the social and economic impact from influenza epidemics. The influenza surveillance system long has been playing an essential role in collecting disease information and providing evidence for prevention and control strategies and measures. Two surveillance systems were established in Wuxi for influenza-like illness (ILI) and unexplained pneumonia (UP) after the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak. The ILI system was implemented for influenza surveillance, and the UP system was designed to track lower respiratory illness with pneumonia symptoms. Although the disease surveillance systems appeared decades later than in developed countries, their performance is by no means inferior to define the distribution of circulating strains in the community and detect disease aberration. Here we described and compared the accumulated ILI data from 2004 to 2009 and UP data from 2007 to 2009. To further evaluate the effectiveness of these surveillance systems in early warning of influenza epidemics, we monitored ILI data between 2004 and 2008 by both a control chart method and the Serfling method and tested goodness of fit using influenza A (H1N1) data of 2009.",

The control chart method was used to determine an influenza threshold by week. A centerline threshold value was drawn based on the weekly proportion of ILI from 2004 to 2008. When the 2009 data were fitted into the chart, alarms of aberrant higher proportions of illness appeared in week 18, week 20 to week 29, week 31 to week 41, week 45 to week 47, and week 49 (Figure 4) .

With these types of diseases or illnesses, indicators like hospital consultations rather than mortality or morbidity are used in modeling, because they tend to provide earlier outbreak indication. 16, 17 For influenza, ILI is commonly used as an indicator to predict the occurrence of epidemics. 13, 18, 19 Unlike other diseases, the value of routinely collected ILI data for influenza detection has been carefully studied and confirmed. 17, 18, 20 In this current study, weekly counts of consultations for ILI and UP were monitored for influenza detection. The distribution of sentinel ILI data in 2009 ( Figure 2) were consistent with the real spread of the pandemic and showed aberrant increase close to or earlier than the reference data. These results confirmed the capability of ILI surveillance system to detect influenza. Although the UP surveillance system was designed to detect SARS instead of influenza, the data are useful because ILI and pneumonia usually have similar symptoms such as fever, cough, and breathing difficulty. Compared with the reference data (Figure 1 ), the sentinel UP data (Table 1 and Figure 3 ) also showed similar epidemic trend. However, the efficiency of early detection was not high using the UP surveillance system as significantly increased proportion of RIWF was observed in sentinel hospitals only after the first local case was reported. A reasonable explanation might be because of the diagnostic criteria. ILI was used specifically to indicate influenza, while RIWF includes pneumonia and many other kinds of respiratory illnesses besides ILI. The nature of the UP system could not distinguish between the respiratory complaints related to influenza and those caused by other pathogens. The population at risk could be another reason for not being able to detect outbreaks because the ILI sentinel sites and UP sentinel sites cover different areas. Nevertheless, the sentinel UP data provide additional information to detect influenza epidemic and can add confidence to declare an epidemic alarm. At the beginning of the 2009 pandemic flu period, Asia was in especially high alert of epidemic influenza and China implemented aggressive policies trying to delay illness spread by early identification and isolation of every confirmed H1N1 patient. The increased proportion of ILI and RIWF before the first imported H1N1 case could be explained as a surveillance artifact because of the heightened concern of individuals. With the development of the epidemic, control strategies were changed to intensive treatment of the seriously ill and self-isolation of mild cases. People who had mild flu symptoms were encouraged to take anti-viral medicines and stay at home instead of seeking medical care in hospitals. All the sentinel hospitals collected data as usual without any strengthened effort. The higher proportion of ILI and RIWF observed after week 29 was more likely due to the high incidence of H1N1 influenza in general population rather than surveillance artifact.",

            "text": "Most approaches of early detection produce alerts based on the theory of signal detection. 25 The optimal sensitivity and specificity depend on a proper level of threshold, but there is always a trade-off between a high threshold for good specificity and a low threshold for good sensitivity. The calibration of a threshold is a complex determination for each system. Both the control chart method and the Serfling method are time series approaches and have their own advantages in reducing the variance caused by epidemic data or secular trend. 14, 21 The control chart method optimizes the threshold calibration by excluding the unexpected data that are beyond the controlled scope. 6 The Serfling method provides reasonably accurate estimates by adjusting the threshold line with secular regression trend. 8 The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Atlanta, GA, USA) developed an Early Aberration Reporting System (EARS) based on CUSUM method, which can use only recent data and is supposed to incorporate the threshold calculation by regression method. 21, 22 However, a study in Hong Kong showed that the regression method and the time series method are superior to the CUSUM method in a small city with fewer sentinel sites, more variable data, and a more abrupt peak in activity. 14 As a result, the CUSUM method was not used in our study. The control chart method detected all four remarkable signals, namely the occurrence of the first imported case, the first local case, outbreaks in schools, and the peak in the general population ( Figure 4) . It also produced two false-positive alarms, one in the beginning and the other at the end of the epidemic period. When using mean + 1-AE6 SD as the threshold, the Serfling method detected the outbreaks in schools and the peak in the general population, with a false-positive signal in the interval; when raising the threshold to mean + 2AE0 SD, only the outbreaks in schools could be detected in a timely manner, and the second alarm was 1 week after the peak in the general population ( Figure 5 ). The comparison of the two methods indicated that the control chart method had better sensitivity and timeliness and the Serfling method had better specificity. Nevertheless, considering that the false-positive alerts of the control method appeared outside the epidemic period, this fact might be taken in favor of a more sensitive detection. The same opinion was seen in Gault's paper. 18 A final decision probably should be made combining the results of both methods. The control chart method can generate sensitive and timely alerts, and Serfling method can offer secular trend to increase specificity and avoid wasting medical resources.",

            "text": "In developing countries like China, surveillance systems like the ILI and UP systems have only recently been implemented. We performed this study after the 2009 pandemic flu in attempt to make full use of these routinely collected background data. The results are theoretically helpful for healthcare workers to take prevention and control measures when influenza epidemic occur, including preparing antiviral drugs and other medical supply needs, and sending health education messages. So far no such actions, which we already took during the epidemic period, have been applied based on our study. Future studies will be carried out to improve the performance of these surveillance systems, such as adding more sentinel sites, covering larger population, improving the quality of indicators, and trying different detection algorithms. Studies of decision making are also needed before these approaches could be used in practice. The decision theory provides mathematical methods to estimate the benefits of true alarms and the costs of false alarms for getting an optimal threshold. 25 This analysis was beyond the scope of our current study, and we will investigate such methods in our future work.",

The surveillance data of both systems were correlated with the influenza epidemic and therefore valuable in monitoring influenza activity and generating early warning methods. The control chart method and Serfling method had their respective merits and faults in data analysis. Further studies could be considered to optimize the threshold of warning. The principle is to improve performance of surveillance systems and allow timely precautionary measures to be implemented in vulnerable populations.",

The 2003 SARS outbreak provided an opportunity to learn about outbreaks and prevention measures. As a result, the surveillance system for UP was established in 2004, and since then no more SARS cases have been detected. In 2009, significantly higher RIWF counts (a total of 83 633 cases, including 2955 classified pneumonia cases) and total visiting patients of the sentinel hospitals (710 956 visits) were observed compared with those observed in 2007 (587 034 patient visits, 58 202 RIWF cases, and 2149 pneumonia cases) and 2008 (640 971 patient visits, 64 986 RIWF cases, and 2293 pneumonia cases) (P < 0AE01;Table 1 and",
