A continued situation of war and conflict, and growing political unrest in the Region, coupled with factors such as travel and migration, and insufficient infrastructure and inadequate technical and managerial capacity of the programmes are the major challenges. Despite these challenges, the Region continued making progress towards the elimination of specific diseases such as lymphatic filariasis, measles, malaria, schistosomiasis and dracunculiasis during 2010-11. Coverage for vaccine-preventable diseases was enhanced. Preparedness and response to emerging (e.g. dengue fever in Pakistan and Yemen) and re-emerging (e.g. cholera in Sudan) infections was improved. The Region has continued its efforts for controlling tuberculosis and curbing HIV/AIDS. Looking ahead, the Region aims to improve surveillance and response capacities, legislation issues, coordination, bio-risk and bio-security and quality management in the coming years.

The Region will focus on improving national managerial capacity and human resource capacity building, empowering decision-making, and supporting countries to reach unreached targets through various evidence-based approaches. Strengthening the monitoring and evaluation systems to use data for action will be among the priority activities. Similarly, strengthening the Regional surveillance networks in order to generate data necessary on new vaccines introduction will be another important step.",
