Personal protective equipment and sufficient resting time may be the basic procedure. [5] . Values in yellow represent numbers of beds provided by makeshift hospitals on the first day of patient admission, values in red represent numbers of patients, and values in blue represent numbers of health-care workers On the other hand, the patients may also contract other diseases in the hospitals when they are being treated for COVID-19. This cross-contamination of patients should also be prevented and is also closely related to ventilation conditions inside the hospitals.",

With more ventilation, current low outdoor temperature will increase the need for heating inside the hospitals. Air conditionings and electric blankets are necessary to keep the patients warm. There remain challenges in energy consumption to exhaust such highvolume air for hundreds of people, and risks in potential unventilated zones in the large space buildings. An alternative to increasing dilution of contaminated air is to use air purifiers to reduce the possible virus-laden aerosols. And all the filters should be collected and disposed as medical waste or disinfected thoroughly to prevent secondary contamination.",
