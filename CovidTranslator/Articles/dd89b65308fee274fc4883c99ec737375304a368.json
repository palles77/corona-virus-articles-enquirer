            "text": "Many of the devastating pandemics and outbreaks of the 20th and 21st centuries have involved enveloped viruses, including influenza, HIV, SARS, MERS, and Ebola. However, little is known about the presence and fate of enveloped viruses in municipal wastewater. Here, we compared the survival and partitioning behavior of two model enveloped viruses (MHV and \u03d56) and two nonenveloped bacteriophages (MS2 and T3) in raw wastewater samples. We showed that MHV and \u03d56 remained infective on the time scale of days. Up to 26% of the two enveloped viruses adsorbed to the solid fraction of wastewater compared to 6% of the two nonenveloped viruses. Based on this partitioning behavior, we assessed and optimized methods for recovering enveloped viruses from wastewater. Our optimized ultrafiltration method resulted in mean recoveries (\u00b1SD) of 25.1% (\u00b13.6%) and 18.2% (\u00b19.5%) for the enveloped MHV and \u03d56, respectively, and mean recoveries of 55.6% (\u00b116.7%) and 85.5% (\u00b124.5%) for the nonenveloped MS2 and T3, respectively. A maximum of 3.7% of MHV and 2% of MS2 could be recovered from the solids. These results shed light on the environmental fate of an important group of viruses and the presented methods will enable future research on enveloped viruses in water environments.",

            "text": "Recent severe disease outbreaks caused by enveloped viruses, such as Ebola, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and avian influenza H5N1 have heightened fears of an imminent deadly viral pandemic. The major transmission routes of these viruses involved direct person-to-person contact or indirect contact with contaminated objects. 1, 2 Human enveloped viruses are often presumed to exist in low concentrations in human excrement and undergo rapid inactivation in aqueous environments; however, several lines of evidence suggest these assumptions are not always correct. The genes of coronaviruses and avian influenzas have been detected in the feces of infected individuals, 3\u22129 and some enveloped viruses were measured in wastewater biosolid residuals. 10 Likewise, some enveloped viruses can survive for days to weeks in pasteurized wastewater. 11\u221213 A review of virus T 90 values (i.e., time to reach 90% inactivation) suggests that avian influenza viruses survive just as long, if not longer, than nonenveloped enteric viruses in some aqueous environments. 14 Based on this information, it is therefore feasible that sewage and fecal-contaminated water could serve as vectors for certain enveloped viruses. Indeed, a SARS coronavirus outbreak in an apartment complex in Hong Kong was attributed to the transport of viruses in wastewater to the air ducts. 15 The vast majority of studies on the presence and fate of viruses in human waste and municipal wastewater have focused on nonenveloped enteric viruses (e.g., adenoviruses, polioviruses, enteroviruses, noroviruses and rotaviruses). 16 \u221221 These viruses replicate in human gut tissues and transmit diseases primarily via the fecal-oral route. Due to the major role of water and food in the transmission of enteric viruses, there are a number of established methods for nonenveloped enteric virus detection in complex environmental matrices. Enveloped viruses differ structurally from nonenveloped viruses due to the presence of a lipid bilayer membrane outside the viral protein capsid, which contains proteins or glycoproteins. The different functional groups on the outer surface of enveloped viruses compared to nonenveloped viruses likely impact their survival and partitioning behavior in aqueous environments. 22\u221224 Likewise, methods to concentrate and recover nonenveloped enteric viruses from wastewater and other environmental matrices may not be suitable for enveloped viruses. For example, lipid layers are sensitive to the detergents and organic solvents 25,26 that are commonly used to extract and purify nonenveloped enteric viruses.",

All samples were collected and sealed in sterile plastic bottles and then immediately transported on ice to laboratories at the University of Michigan where they were stored at 4\u00b0C and analyzed within 24 h.

The measured concentrations of infective MHV and \u03d56 in the solids-removed wastewater samples immediately after spiking, mixing, and centrifuging, were consistently lower than the theoretical concentrations based on the amount of viruses spiked into the sample (SI Figure S1 ). Approximately 47% of the spiked MHV and 77% of the spiked \u03d56 were recovered in the centrate of the solids-removed wastewater. This is compared to a nearly 100% recovery of the nonenveloped viruses MS2 and T3. Nearly all of the MHV was recovered when it was spiked into PBS and centrifuged in the same manner (SI Figure S1 ). This suggests that a fraction of the enveloped viruses (53% MHV and 23% \u03d56) were rapidly inactivated in the solids-removed wastewater. A pronounced initial decrease in infective virus concentration was previously observed when Ebola virus was added to pasteurized wastewater. 12 In those experiments, the number of infective Ebola viruses decreased rapidly over the first 24 h (\u223c2-log loss) and then stabilized at a much slower inactivation rate over the subsequent 7 days. Similar biphasic inactivation kinetics have also been observed with nonenveloped viruses, which were attributed to subpopulations of viruses with varied susceptibilities to solution chemistry or temperature. 38 In our partitioning experiments, we chose to normalize measured concentrations in the wastewater and solids-removed wastewater samples over time to concentrations measured in solids-removed samples immediately after they were spiked with viruses, mixed, and centrifuged. We felt this approach was justified because the behaviors of the persistent subpopulations are of most interest for real wastewater systems.",

The optimized method involves prefiltering 250 mL of wastewater through a 0.22 \u03bcm PES membrane to remove solids, followed by concentration of the filtrate with 10 kDa centrifugal filters to a final volume of 2.5 mL. Using this method, we achieved mean virus recoveries of 25.1% for MHV, 18.2% for \u03d56, 55.6% for MS2, and 85.5% for T3 (Figure 4 ). Ultrafiltration has been successfully applied for recovering nonenveloped enteric viruses from wastewater, such as polioviruses, adenoviruses, noroviruses, and enteroviruses. 18, 41 Here, we have demonstrated that the method can also be optimized for recovering enveloped viruses. In future work, we will test hollow fiber ultrafilters and tangential flow ultrafiltration to potentially increase wastewater sample volumes that can be processed, and thus decrease the detection limits of infective enveloped viruses in wastewater.",

Our results shed light on the behavior of enveloped viruses in wastewater and provide guidance on how to recover infective enveloped viruses from raw wastewater. Although the two model enveloped viruses were more rapidly inactivated in wastewater, they did survive long enough to be of concern for wastewater treatment facilities, stormwater overflow events, and wastewater intrusion in drinking water. The results presented here will be particularly important during potential future avian influenza or coronavirus outbreaks in humans, as some strains of these viruses can be excreted in feces. Future work should examine additional enveloped viruses to elucidate the specific virus characteristics that contribute to their survival times and enhanced partitioning to solids. ",
