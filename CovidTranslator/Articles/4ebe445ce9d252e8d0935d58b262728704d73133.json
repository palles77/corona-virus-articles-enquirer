            "text": "In the course of evolution, most organisms have devel oped mechanisms to utilize oxygen for various biologi cal processes, such as the synthesis of biomolecules, energy production and phagocytosis. Cellular usage of oxygen leads to the constant generation of reactive oxy gen species (ROS), which are mainly generated by the mitochondria. In addition, ROS are generated in per oxisomes, the endoplasmic reticulum and the plasma membrane. Within eukaryotic organisms, superoxide, peroxide and hydroxyl radicals represent the main types of ROS that have high reactivity and low stability and that actively drive many cellular reactions. The biological effects of ROS greatly depend on the amounts of ROS present, which supports the idea that cellular ROS gener ation has characteristics of hormesis 1 . Indeed, at low con centrations, ROS participate in physiological processes, such as cell renewal, cellular metabolism, proliferation and differentiation 1-4 . However, high ROS production during an oxidative burst is crucial for host defence to ensure microbial killing 5 and the formation of neutro phil extracellular traps (NETs) 6 . These cellular responses and the modulation of immune responses by ROS have been recently reviewed 1,3,4,7 . However, both exogenous triggers, such as ultraviolet (UV) irradiation, chemical toxins and hyperthermia, and endogenous conditions, including senescence, metabolic changes and inflam mation, can impair the balance between the generation and the elimination of intracellular ROS, which can lead to ROS accumulation and oxidative stress. The harmful effects that are caused by oxidative stress are typically limited by antioxidant responses, which include the induction of enzymes and proteins that eliminate ROS. However, if unresolved, oxidative stress generates cellu lar and extracellular damage by irreversibly modify ing DNA, RNA, proteins and lipids, which ultimately leads to molecular modifications that disrupt normal functions and often results in cell0 death. Oxidative modifi cations of biomolecules also lead to the genera tion of secondary free radicals, which further propagate oxidative damage 1,3,4,7 .",

            "text": "Lipids, particularly phospholipids, are prime targets for oxidation owing to their abundance as important building blocks of cells, extracellular vesicles and lipo proteins. The oxidation of lipids not only alters their biologi cal function but also results in the generation of various degradation products through a process that is known as lipid peroxidation 8 (BOX 1). The newly gener ated products propagate the effect of oxidative stress by directly modulating cellular functions and responses such as metabolism and inflammation 9-18 . Furthermore, as the degradation products of oxidized lipids are often highly reactive, they modify selfmolecules and thereby generate structural neoepitopes that are recognized by receptors of the immune system. These neoepitopes have been termed oxidation-specific epitopes (OSEs) and represent a common set of epitopes present on various oxidatively modified selfproteins and lipids 14, 19 . OSEs, including oxidized phospholipids (OxPLs) and malondialdehyde Abstract | Ageing, infections and inflammation result in oxidative stress that can irreversibly damage cellular structures. The oxidative damage of lipids in membranes or lipoproteins is one of these deleterious consequences that not only alters lipid function but also leads to the formation of neo-self epitopes -oxidation-specific epitopes (OSEs) -which are present on dying cells and damaged proteins. OSEs represent endogenous damage-associated molecular patterns that are recognized by pattern recognition receptors and the proteins of the innate immune system, and thereby enable the host to sense and remove dangerous biological waste and to maintain homeostasis. If this system is dysfunctional or overwhelmed, the accumulation of OSEs can trigger chronic inflammation and the development of diseases, such as atherosclerosis and age-related macular degeneration. Understanding the molecular components and mechanisms that are involved in this process will help to identify individuals with an increased risk of developing chronic inflammation, and will also help to indicate novel modes of therapeutic intervention.

In particular, the oxidation of the PUFA chain at the sn-2 position of phosphatidyl choline results in its fragmentation and the generation of reactive PUFA breakdown products such as MDA and 4hydroxynonenal (4HNE), which can modify selfmolecules and form OSEs (FIG. 1) . OSEs can also be generated by the modification of proteins with truncated phospholipids, such as oxidized phosphatidylcholine, oxidized cardiolipin (OxCL), oxidized phosphatidyl serine (OxPS) and oxidized phosphatidylethanola mine (OxPE) 8, [30] [31] [32] . Furthermore, 2 (\u03c9 carboxyethyl) pyrrole (CEP) represents an adduct between (E)4hydroxy7oxohept5enoic acid -an oxidative fragment of docosahexaenoic acid -and the amino groups of lysines or aminophospholipids 24, 33, 34 . Notably, some of these breakdown products, such as MDA and 4HNE, have been studied as prototypical markers of oxidative stress and can be measured by the frequently used 2-thiobarbituric acid reaction (TBAR) method 8 . As a vast diversity of OxPLs can be generated, many more OSEs derived from these may exist 23, 28 . Moreover, the oxidation of other lipids, such as cholesterol and chol esteryl esters, can lead to structural changes and altered biological activities, but their ability to be recognized by innate immune receptors is still being characterized 10, 25, 35 . It will be important to elucidate the exact structures of the relevant OSEs to better understand their recogni tion by the immune system. Owing to their biological activities, these products of lipid peroxidation have been implicated in a wide variety of physiological and patho logical processes, and immune responses that target these products can modulate many of these effects 14, 30, 36 .",

The subsequent addition of oxygen radicals and the formation of lipid-peroxyl radicals, which are transformed into lipid-hydroperoxide molecules can further propagate this reaction. Both enzymatic and non-enzymatic mechanisms can lead to lipid peroxidation. The enzymatic mechanisms involve lipoxygenases, cyclooxygenases and cytochrome P450, and result in the generation of products with high stereo-specificity 23, 144 . Depending on the PUFA substrate, major products of lipoxygenase oxidation are hydroxyperoxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HpETEs) hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HETEs), leukotrienes, lipoxins, hydroxyoctadecadienoic acids (HODEs), hepoxylins and resolvins. Oxygenation by cyclooxygenases results in the generation of prostaglandins, prostacyclin and thromboxanes, whereas cytochrome P450 generates epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs), 20-HETE, thromboxanes and prostacyclins 27, 145 . Non-enzymatic mechanisms are mediated by free radicals that are generated by NADPH oxidases and nitric oxide synthases in the presence of transition metal ions (Fe 2+ and Cu 2+ ) and result in a mixture of nonspecific stereoisomers 23, 27 . Moreover, the enzyme myeloperoxidase can also initiate non-enzymatic lipid peroxidation through the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as HOCl, HOBr and \u00b7NO 145, 146 . In contrast to products of enzymatic lipid oxidation, the products of non-enzymatic processes are considered to be more toxic and damaging to the host 147 . Continuous degradation of lipid-hydroxyperoxides by cyclization and fragmentation in the presence of reducing metal ions (Fe 2+ and Cu 2+ ) results in the generation of highly reactive terminal degradation products such as reactive aldehydes 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE), malondialdehyde (MDA) and 2-(\u03c9 carboxyethyl) pyrrole (CEP) 8, 24 . Lipid peroxidation products that are generated by both mechanisms modulate a multitude of physiological processes such as cell signalling, wound healing, immune tolerance, skin barrier function, coagulation, vasodilation, modulation and the resolution of inflammation 12, 13, 16, 23, 145, 148, 149 . They are rapidly removed in healthy tissues but accumulate in many pathological conditions in which they can cause adverse effects. ",

They are multiligand receptors that bind both modified selfstructures and nonself molecules. Different types of scavenger recep tors have been identified, including CD36, SRA1, SRA2, SRB1, CD68 and lectinlike oxidized LDL receptor 1 (LOX1; also known as OLR1) 37 . Among these, SRA1, SRA2 and CD36 are considered to be responsible for most of the OxLDL uptake by macrophages in in vitro assays, because macrophages that are deficient in CD36, SRA1 and SRA2 show 75-90% decreased binding and degradation of OxLDL 38 . Detailed structural studies have shown that OxPL is a highaffinity ligand that mediates OxLDL binding to CD36 (REF. 39) , and, spe cifically, that this is mediated by the phosphocholine (PC) headgroup of OxPL (PCOxPL) but the PC of unoxidized phospholipids does not serve as a ligand 40 . Binding can also be mediated by the truncated sn2 acyl chain of OxPLs 41, 42 , which indicates that other classes of oxidized phospholipids such as OxPS can bind to CD36 (REFS 43, 44) . Similarly, PCOxPL also mediates the uptake of OxLDL by SRB1 on macrophages 45 . Examples of other OSEs that are recognized by scavenger receptors include CEPmodified proteins, which are recognized by CD36 (REF. 46) and MDAmodified proteins, which are taken up by SRA1 and SRA2 47, 48 . A recent study showed that the endothelial scavenger receptor LOX1 mediates MDAinduced nitric oxide (NO) production 49 and this receptor also binds 4HNE 50 .",

Macrophages stimulated with oxidized 1palmitoyl 2arachidonylsnglycero3phosphocholine (OxPAPC) secrete interleukin6 (IL6), whereas IL6 production is absent in macrophages that lack TLR4 or TIRdomaincontaining adaptor protein inducing interferon\u03b2 (TRIF; also known as TICAM1) 51 . Sensing of PCOxPL seems to be important for the TLR4mediated effects, as the PCspecific IgM T15/E06 inhibited IL6 secretion induced by OxPAPC but did not inhibit IL6 secretion induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) 51 . OxPLs have also been reported to stimulate macrophages via a TLR2 pathway 52 . Moreover, chemokine secretion by macrophages stimulated with OxLDL has been shown to require the cooperation of CD36 with a TLR4-TLR6 heterodimer 53 . Conversely, OxPLs induce apoptosis in macrophages via TLR2-TLR6 in cooperation with a CD36 ligand 54 . As most of these studies have used mix tures of different OxPL products, individual OxPL moi eties might use TLR receptors in varying combinations to generate different signalling pathways. The common role of TLRs as sensors of OSEs is further supported by the findings that CEP adducts are bound by TLR2, but not by TLR4, on both endothelial cells 33 and macrophages 46 . Furthermore, CEP selectively augments TLR2-TLR1 signalling in macrophages 55 and has been shown to acti vate platelets via TLR2-TLR1 (REF. 56). TLRs have not yet been directly implicated in chemokine secretion that is induced by MDA or 4HNE, but this process is probably also mediated by the cooperation of scavenger recep tors with other signalling PRRs 57 . Oxidized cholesteryl esters (OxCEs) trigger proinflammatory macrophage responses via TLR4 and these involve nonclassical sig nalling via spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) 35, 58 . Thus, some OSEs represent endogenous TLR ligands that have the capacity to trigger inflammatory responses. Notably, in endotoxininduced inflammation, soluble OxPLs impair complex formation of TLR4 with CD14, MD2 and LPS binding protein and thereby dampen LPSinduced responses 23, 59 . Recently, epoxycyclopentenones that are present in OxPAPC were identified as active compo nents responsible for the inhibitory effects of OxPAPC on the activation of specific TLRs by synthetic ligands 60 . An interesting property of the inflammatory responses to OxPL is the tight cooperation with scavenger receptors, such as CD36, which mediate recognition of OxPLs and probably also facilitate sensing and signalling by TLRs. Although OxLDL uptake via CD36 seems to be necessary for some macrophage signalling pathways, it is unknown to what extent scavenger receptormediated uptake of other OSEs is required for their cellular responses.",

DAMPs are intracellular and extracellular host-derived molecules that are not usually sensed by the immune system but that are released or become modified into altered self-molecules upon tissue damage 21 . In analogy to pathogeninduced inflammation, sterile inflammation is triggered by the activation of the innate immune response through the recognition of DAMPs by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), resulting in the enhanced secretion of cytokines and chemokines. Membranebound PRRs, such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs), and intracellular PRRs, such as the inflammasome, are key mediators of sterile inflammation. Cytokines belonging to the interleukin-1 (IL-1) family have been proposed to be important drivers of sterile inflammation 150 . Increased cytokine and chemokine secretion at the site of initial damage ultimately results in an enhanced recruitment of immune cells, such as neutrophils and macrophages. The resolution of sterile inflammation should lead to tissue repair and the re-establishment of homeostasis.

Importantly, these binding sites are hotspots for diseaseassociated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) 69 ; for example, SNP rs1061170 results in a Y>H exchange of amino acid 402 in SCR7 and reduces the ability of plasma CFH to bind MDA by more than 65% for homozygous carriers compared with controls 67 . In addition, the use of recom binant variants of the SCR1920 domain demonstrated that other SNPs in SCR1920 could alter binding to MDA 70 . Thus, genetic variants of both MDAbinding sites of CFH may determine the ability of CFH to bind MDA. Considering the conserved structure of the regu lators of complement activation, MDAepitopes could also serve as binding sites for other members of this family 68 .

As different OSEs are often present on the same surfaces, different solu ble PRRs binding to them may synergize and cooperate in their effector functions. For example, apoptotic cells and microvesicles carry both MDA and PCOxPL epitopes 20,75 , each of which recruits different soluble PRRs to the same surface. Tissue damage, cellular stress and cell death result in increased oxidative stress, which promotes lipid peroxidation. Lipid peroxidation can occur through non-enzymatic mechanisms, such as reactive oxygen species (ROS), and through enzymatic mechanisms, including myeloperoxidases, 12/15-lipoxygenases, cyclooxygenases and cytochrome P450. The oxidation of sn-2 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) of membrane phospholipids leads to fragmentation and the generation of highly reactive breakdown products, such as malondialdehyde (MDA) and 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) 8, [30] [31] [32] . In addition, different types of oxidized phospholipids (OxPLs) can be generated from different phospholipid backbones, including oxidized phosphatidylcholine, oxidized phosphatidylethanolamine (OxPE), oxidized phosphatidylserine (OxPS) and oxidized cardiolipin (OxCL). The newly generated breakdown products and the oxidized and truncated residual core OxPLs can in turn react with free amino groups of protein side chains or lipids that are localized in their vicinity, forming stable covalent adducts and creating oxidation-specific epitopes (OSEs). Because phosphocholine (PC) as an OSE is only presented as an epitope in the context of OxPL, these epitopes are termed PC-OxPLs for clarity. The PC moiety can also be a component of the capsular polysaccharide of bacteria, where it is not part of a phospholipid and is constitutively presented as an epitope. In addition, an adduct between an oxidative fragment of docosahexaenoic acid, (E)-4-hydroxy-7-oxohept-5-enoic acid and lysines of proteins (or aminophospholipids) can lead to the formation of 2-(\u03c9-carboxyethyl) pyrrole (CEP). OSE-modified proteins or lipids are sensed by innate immune responses and represent a unique class of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). (TABLE 1) . IgM antibodies in human umbili cal cord blood, which represent naive natural antibodies of fetal origin, have specificity for OSEs 75 . In fact, titres of IgM with specificity for OxLDL and MDALDL were higher in cord blood samples compared with matched maternal blood samples. The specific binding proper ties of natural IgM antibodies have been investigated by characterizing IgM antibodies derived both from in vitro stimulated B1 cells and from the plasma of mice lack ing recombinationactivating gene 1 (RAG1) that were selectively reconstituted with B1 cells 75 . These studies revealed that several OSEs, including PCOxPL, MDA and 4HNE adducts are bound by up to 30% of all natural IgM found in the plasma of both wildtype and gnoto biotic mice, and by a similar percentage of IgMsecreting cells from the spleens of wildtype mice 75 . Furthermore, several monoclonal natural IgM antibodies with specific ity for different OSEs have been characterized. For exam ple, the wellstudied PCbinding T15/E06 IgM -which contains a variable region that is composed of a canoni cal rearrangement of germline genes in both the V L and V H chains -was originally cloned from the spleens of atherosclerosisprone apolipoprotein E (Apoe \u2212/\u2212 ) mice as an antibody with specificity for OxLDL, which was later found to be specific for PCOxPL [76] [77] [78] . The same antibody idiotype, as an IgA, was originally described due to its ability to bind PC present in the capsular polysaccharide of S. pneumoniae 76, 79, 80 . In addition, several other IgMs that bind different OSEs have been identified, such as the OxCLspecific LR01 and a number of others with speci ficity for MDAtype adducts, including E014, NA17 and LR04. Similar to T15/E06, all of the OSEspecific natural IgM antibodies that have been described exhibit germline or neargermline usage in their complementary determining region 3 (CDR3), identifying them as natu ral IgM 75, 78, 81, 82 . Thus, natural IgM antibodies prominently participate in the response to OSEs.",

            "text": "Role of OSEs in the maintenance of homeostasis Physiological carriers of OSEs. Tissue homeostasis depends on the efficient removal of dying cells, which is achieved by molecular tags that mark cellular debris at different stages of cellular death. The quiescent removal of apoptotic cells is mainly mediated by phagocytes that sense several 'findme' and 'eatme' signals on apoptotic cells [83] [84] [85] . However, in situations of increased cell death and/or inefficient clearance, apoptotic cells can release DAMPs that trigger sterile inflammation 22 and render these cells immunogenic 17 . OSEs on latestage apop totic cells have been identified as important ligands for the clearance of apoptotic cells under these condi tions 17, 18, 75, 81, 86, 87 . In fact, apoptotic mammalian cells of every cellular origin tested display OSEs on their surface independently of the apoptosis trigger, and these OSEs are identical to the ones on OxLDL 18 (FIG. 2) . Notably, only a small proportion of early apoptotic cells dis play OSEs, which is in contrast to late apoptotic cells as >50% of this cell population carries OSEs 18, 81 . A sub set of apoptotic cells is bound by natural IgM antibod ies with specificity for PCOxPL and different types of MDA epitopes, and some are bound by monoclonal anti bodies with specificity for OxCL 17, 18, 75, 81, 82 . Furthermore, mass spectrometry has demonstrated that lipid extracts of thymocytes, in which apoptosis was induced by Milk fat globule-epidermal growth factor 8 (MFG-E8).

For example, exposure to high light intensities in an oxygenrich environment results in enhanced lipid peroxidation. Consequently, the retina is one of the tis sues with the highest cell turnover rate, and accordingly requires high phagocytic activity for the clearance of aged photoreceptors, which are enriched in longchain PUFAs. Both retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and microvascular endothelial cells express several scavenger receptors that mediate the clearance of apoptotic cells, cellular debris and oxidized lipids 93 . Indeed, rats with a deletion variant of CD36 exhibit impaired phagocytosis of photoreceptor rod outer segments 94 . Whereas anionic phospholipids on apoptotic cells have been suggested to mediate this binding 95 , mass spectrometry studies have shown that the exposure of rat retinal cells to light results in elevated levels of OxPLs 96 . Importantly, OxPL inhibited the uptake of rod outer segments by wildtype cells but not by Cd36 \u2212/\u2212 RPE cells. OSEs may also be involved in efferocytosis via MFGE8, which binds OxPS exposed on the surface of apoptotic cells 72 . MFGE8 facilitates engulfment by phagocytes via the \u03b1v\u03b23 and \u03b1v\u03b25 integrin receptors, and has been shown to have an important role in the phagocytosis of photoreceptors of the outer segment 97 . Recent work has identified the 12/15 lipoxygenase product OxPE as a ligand for MFGE8 with unique functional consequences in the context of apoptotic cell clearance during peritonitis 73 . In this study, OxPE that is exposed on the surface of alternatively activated macrophages led to the seques tration of MFGE8, which favours the engulfment of apoptotic cells via phosphatidylserine receptors, such as T cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain 4 (TIM4), but blocks MFGE8dependent uptake of apoptotic cells by proinflammatory LY6C hi monocytes. Thus, in envi ronments with high oxidative stress, the OSEdependent clearance of cellular debris represents a physiological housekeeping function that directs the clearance of dying cells to specific pathways.",

Natural IgM antibodies are important in apoptotic cell clearance, as mice defi cient in secreted IgM are more prone to developing auto immunity when crossed with the lupusprone MRL/lpr background 100 . To date, all characterized OSEspecific natural IgM antibodies have also been found to bind apoptotic cells, and the PCspecific T15/E06 IgM and the MDAspecific NA17 antibodies enhance the uptake of apoptotic cells in mice in vivo 75 104 . Importantly, recruitment of CFH to apoptotic blebs and to necrotic RPE cells can be medi ated by MDA 67 and other previously described ligands 105 . This might allow CFH to provide cofactor activity for factor I on dying cells to inactivate C3b into iC3b. The phagocytosis of dying cells that have been opsonized with iC3b can inhibit nuclear factor\u03baB (NF\u03baB) transcrip tion, and can thereby promote antiinflammatory clear ance by phagocytes 106 . Notably, CFH mediates cofactor activity on MDAdecorated surfaces, and MDA binding does not interfere with this process. Moreover, owing to its reduced MDAbinding capacity, the H402 variant of CFH displayed significantly impaired cofactor activity compared with the Y402 variant, which may result in the less efficient clearance of MDAdecorated structures and increased inflammation 67,107 . Interestingly, CFH was reported to slow down efferocytosis in vitro 104, 108 , which is beneficial in circumstances that require decreased release of ROS, nitrogen intermediates and lysosomal enzymes by phagocytes 108, 109 . During this process, addi tional complementindependent neutralizing functions of CFH and OSEspecific IgM may also be crucial to prevent potential proinflammatory effects of the OSEs that have not yet been cleared. For example, CFH blocks MDAinduced CXCchemokine ligand 8 (CXCL8) and CXCL1 production in vitro and in vivo, respectively 67 . Similarly, the MDAspecific IgM LR04 and the PCspecific IgM T15/E06 inhibited microvesicle induced CXCL8 secretion in human monocytes and the activation of endothelial cells, respectively 20, 88 . These findings provide insights into the important physio logi cal function of OSEspecific immune responses in the recognition and neutralization of cellular debris in the circulation.",

Endothelial cells and macrophages -which express different sets of scavenger receptors and TLRs -are major cellular sensors of OSEs in atherosclerosis. OxPLs induce the expression of chemoattractants, such as CCchemokine ligand 2 (CCL2; also known as MCP1), fibronectin con taining connecting segment 1, CXCL8 and Pselectin, and also trigger monocyte binding to endothelial cells 23 , which is partly mediated by TLR4 (REF. 116 ). 4HNE also induces ERK1/2 and NF\u03baB activation in endothe lial cells via LOX1 (REF. 50 ). LOX1 deficiency results in decreased lesion formation in Ldlr \u2212/\u2212 mice 117 . CEP may also trigger a proatherogenic endothelial cell response via TLR2 (REF. 33 ). The expression of TLR2 is increased in endothelial cells at sites of disturbed blood flow, and TLR2 deficiency in nonhaematopoietic tissues reduces atherosclerosis in Ldlr \u2212/\u2212 mice 118 . Thus, OSE sensing by endothelial cells is a key response in the development of atherosclerosis. Moreover, a recent study demon strated that CEP accelerates platelet activation and thrombus formation in hyperlipidaemic Apoe \u2212/\u2212 mice in a TLR2dependent manner 56 , indicating a role for OSEs in triggering the clinical events that result from atherosclerosis.",

The enhanced uptake of cholesterolrich LDL and subsequent inefficient removal of intracellular cholesterol can lead to a situ ation of supersaturation of cholesterol, leading to the formation of cholesterol crystals that damage lysosomes and that activate the NOD, LRR and pyrin domain containing protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome, result ing in IL1\u03b2 secretion 120 . Indeed, cholesterol loading of macro phages with OxLDL induces IL1\u03b2 secretion, and Ldlr \u2212/\u2212 mice reconstituted with NLRP3deficient bone marrow develop less atherosclerosis 120 . Moreover, deficiency of CD36 and/or SRA1 in Apoe \u2212/\u2212 and Ldlr \u2212/\u2212 mice, respectively, reduces the size and/or complexity of lesions compared with control mice 119 . In addition, binding of OxLDL to CD36 induces chemokine expres sion and inflammasome priming through NF\u03baB acti vation, which is dependent on hetero trimer formation with TLR4-TLR6 (REFS 53, 121) . TLR4 signalling is important, as Tlr4 \u2212/\u2212 Apoe \u2212/\u2212 mice exhibit significantly reduced lesion size 122 , and clinical studies have found an SNP in TLR4, which results in impaired signalling, to be associ ated with reduced plaque burden and acute coronary events 123, 124 . These studies demonstrate that sensing of OSEs, and in particular PCOxPL, by CD36 is central to several proatherogenic responses in macro phages. OxLDL, as well as excessive foam cell forma tion, induces macrophage apoptosis, which is observed in advanced atherosclerotic lesions 125 . As a result of inefficient efferocytosis, apoptotic macrophages accu mulate, which results in increased plaque necrosis and longterm atherosclerotic burden. Several studies demonstrate that deficiencies in certain proteins or receptors that mediate efferocytosis enhance lesion for mation in atherosclerosisprone mice 125 . Furthermore, the accumulation of apoptotic macrophages within lesions, and their released microvesicles, which all bear OSEs, may compete with both OxLDL and apoptotic cells for clearance by macrophages and thereby further impair efferocytosis.",

Although the ability of CRP to bind OSEs and to mediate apoptotic cell clearance suggests a role in atherosclero sis, there is no real support for an active role of CRP itself in the pathogenesis of the disease from animal or human studies 127, 128 . However, CRP is an excellent biomarker of inflammation, and increased levels of CRP independently predict manifestations of athero sclerosis 64 . By contrast, natural IgM antibodies clearly modu late athero sclerotic lesion formation, as deficiency in secreted IgM promotes atherosclerosis in Ldlr \u2212/\u2212 mice 126 . As many natural IgM antibodies bind OSEs 75 , their athero protective function may be mostly medi ated by OSEspecific IgM, which includes housekeeping mechanisms and other protective effects. For example, T15/E06 IgM neutralizes the pro inflammatory effects on endothelial cells and macrophages of late apoptotic cells and/or blebs carrying PCOxPL 17, 51, 88 . T15/E06 IgM antibodies have also been shown to block the binding and uptake of OxLDL in macrophages, preventing foam cell formation 77 . Importantly, raising plasma levels of T15/E06 IgM by immunization with PCcontaining pneumococcal extracts or passive infusion decreased atherosclerosis in Ldlr \u2212/\u2212 mice and vein graft athero sclerosis in Apoe \u2212/\u2212 mice, respectively 129, 130 . In ana logy to PCOxPL, MDAepitopes also trigger tumour necrosis factor (TNF) and CXCL8 in monocytes and macrophages 67 . In addition, the numbers of MDA positive micro vesicles substantially increased at the culprit lesion sites of patients suffering from an acute coronary event compared with the number found in peripheral circulation, which could further propagate inflammation 20 126 .",

CFH is present in human atherosclerotic lesions, where it localizes to areas rich in MDAepitopes 67, 131 . Although several studies have 20, 114 . This results in the expression of adhesion molecules and the secretion of chemoattractants leading to monocyte recruitment to the intima of the artery wall. Macrophages internalize OxLDL via scavenger receptors such as scavenger receptor A1 (SRA1), lectin-like oxidized LDL receptor 1 (LOX1), SRB1 and CD36 (REF. 37) , and in cooperation with Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) and TLR4-TLR6 receive pro-inflammatory signals from OSEs. The enhanced uptake of OxLDL via scavenger receptors leads to the excess accumulation of intracellular cholesterol and the formation of lipid-laden foam cells, as well as the secretion of cytokines and chemokines. Excessive free cholesterol accumulation induces cholesterol crystal formation that triggers lysosome rupture and activation of the NOD-, LRR-and pyrin domain-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome 120 primed by pro-inflammatory OSE-induced signalling. Free intracellular cholesterol also induces endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, leading to macrophage apoptosis. As a consequence of this, and impaired efferocytosis, late-stage apoptotic cells accumulate, contributingtogether with OxLDL and microvesiclesto a growing pool of OSEs inside the plaque. Natural IgM specific for OSEs blocks scavenger receptor-mediated uptake and neutralizes the pro-inflammatory effects of OSEs by promoting their complement-dependent clearance. Complement factor H (CFH) blocks the pro-inflammatory effects of malondialdehyde (MDA) and facilitates the anti-inflammatory clearance of MDA-decorated surfaces through Factor I-dependent iC3b generation 67 . The milk fat globule-epidermal growth factor 8 (MFG-E8) is also involved in the clearance of OSEs by recognizing oxidized phosphatidylserine (OxPS). Impaired functions of these humoral immune responses as a result of low abundance or decreased binding capacities, as well as excessive accumulation of OxLDL, microvesicles and apoptotic cells, favours the recognition of OSEs by macrophage receptors, leading to sustained inflammation.

Several OSEs, including PCOxPLs, and MDA and CEPmodified proteins, have been identified as drusen components and have been shown to trigger sterile inflammation 138 . For example, CEPmodified proteins induce pro inflammatory gene expression and prime the NLRP3 inflammasome in monocytes via TLR2 (REFS 55, 139) . Drusen extracts isolated from AMD lesions activate the NLRP3 inflammasome, resulting in the secretion of IL1\u03b2 and IL18 (REF. 139) . Similarly, MDAmodified proteins induce the expression of CXCL8 and CXCL1 in RPE cells in in vitro and in vivo models, respectively 67 . Dysregulation of complement represents another major pathological driver of AMD, and genomewide associ ation studies have identified SNPs in genes encoding complement proteins as genetic risk factors of AMD 69,137 . Among these, the SNP rs1061170 in CFH predisposes to increased risk for AMD 140, 141 . Necrotic RPE cells and blebs thereof display MDAepitopes that are rec ognized by CFH, which in turn facilitates the genera tion of iC3b for opsonization and antiinflammatory removal. Compared with the Y402 CFH variant, the cofactor activity on MDAdecorated surfaces is severely impaired when the 402H CFH variant is used, demon strating a functional consequence. As a result, MDA may accumulate and promote inflammation 67 . Indeed, trans genic mice that express the human 402H variant have increased susceptibility to oxidative stress mediated injury in the retina as a result of MDA accumulation and increased inflammation 142 .",

In situations of increased oxidative stress, the generation and burden of OSEs is greatly increased. As a consequence, OSEs are sensed by cellular signalling receptors, leading to the secretion of chemokines and pro inflammatory cytokines. Thus, OSEs represent a unique class of DAMPs, which both mediate the recog nition of cellular debris for housekeeping functions and, under certain circumstances, act as pro inflammatory danger signals themselves. When this fine balance between the presence of OSEs and the capacities of the immune system to survey and respond to them is lost owing to the excessive generation of OSEs and/or their impaired removal, the development and propagation of chronic inflammatory diseases become manifest.",

Components of cellular and humoral immune responses sense OSEs and mediate sterile inflammation or clearance and neutralization depending on the availability and context. Macrophages sense OSEs through various pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that are expressed on their surface. Scavenger receptor CD36 preferentially binds and mediates the uptake of the phosphocholine (PC) of OxPL (PC-OxPL), oxidized phosphatidylserine (OxPS) and 2-(\u03c9-carboxyethyl)pyrrole (CEP). Scavenger receptor SRB1 recognizes PC-OxPL; SRA1 andlectin-like oxidized LDL receptor 1 (LOX1) bind malondialdehyde (MDA); and LOX1 recognizes 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE)14,37 . Toll-like receptors (TLRs) mediate pro-inflammatory signals. PC-OxPL transmit inflammatory signals through a heterotrimer of TLR4-TLR6-CD36, as well as through TLR2, and CEP signals through TLR2 in cooperation with CD36(REFS 33,46). Humoral immune responses to OSEs include natural IgM antibodies, C-reactive protein (CRP), members of complement and other soluble PRRs that are involved in the clearance of apoptotic cells. Soluble PRRs inhibit the recognition of OSEs by cellular PRRs and mediate uptake via alternative pathways. Natural IgM bound to PC-OxPL, MDA and 4-HNE epitopes are taken up by macrophages by C1q-calreticulin-CD91-dependent or mannose-binding lectin (MBL)-and MBL receptor-dependent mechanisms. CRP bound to PC-OxPL is taken up by C1q-calreticulin-CD91-dependent mechanisms103,151 . Alternative recognition of C1q is mediated by CD93 (not shown). Complement factor H (CFH) bound to MDA provides cofactor activity for the cleavage of C3b into iC3b opsonins 67 that mediate anti-inflammatory clearance via complement receptor 3 (CR3).
