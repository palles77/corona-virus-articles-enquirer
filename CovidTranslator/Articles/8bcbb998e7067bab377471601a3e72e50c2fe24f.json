            "text": "scenario where we have taken twenty times the confirmed number of infected and forty times the confirmed number of recovered cases, the case fatality ratio is around \u223c0.15% in the total population. Importantly, based on this scenario, simulations suggest a slow down of the outbreak in Hubei at the end of February. this third zoonotic human coronavirus are still unknown. Using the serial intervals (SI) 23 of the two other well-known coronavirus diseases, MERS and SARS, as approximations 24 for the true unknown SI, Zhao et al. estimated the mean basic reproduction number 25 (R 0 ) of SARS-CoV-2 to range between 2.24 (95% CI: 1.96-2.55) and 3.58 (95% CI: 26 2.89-4.39) in the early phase of the outbreak [10] . Very similar estimates, 2.2 (95% CI: 27 1.4-3.9), were obtained for R 0 at the early stages of the epidemic by Imai et al. 2.6 (95% 28 CI: 1.5-3.5) [11] , as well as by Li weeks [12] . Amidst such an important ongoing public health crisis that also has severe 33 economic repercussions, we reverted to mathematical modelling that can shed light to 34 essential epidemiologic parameters that determine the fate of the epidemic [13] . Here, 35 we present the results of the analysis of time series of epidemiological data available in 36 the public domain [14] [15] [16] (WHO, CDC, ECDC, NHC and DXY) from January 11 to 37 February 10, 2020, and attempt a three-week forecast of the spreading dynamics of the 38 emerged coronavirus epidemic in the epicenter in mainland China. Our analysis was based on the publicly available data of the new confirmed daily cases 41 reported for the Hubei province from the 11th of January until the 10th of values of the main epidemiological parameters, i.e. the basic reproduction number R 0 , 44 the case fatality (hat\u03b3) and case recovery (\u03b2) ratios, along with their 90% confidence 45 intervals. However, as suggested [17] , the number of infected, and consequently the 46 number of recovered, people is likely to be much higher. Thus, in a second scenario, we 47 have also derived results by taking twenty times the number of reported cases for the 48 infected and forty times the number for the recovered cases, while keeping constant the 49 number of deaths that is more likely to be closer to the real number. Furthermore, by 50 calibrating the parameters of the SIRD model to fit the reported data, we also provide 51 tentative forecasts until the 29th of February. 52 The basic reproduction number (R 0 ) is one of the key values that can predict 53 whether the infectious disease will spread into a population or die out. R 0 represents 54 the average number of secondary cases that result from the introduction of a single 55 infectious case in a totally susceptible population during the infectiousness period. 56 Based on the reported data of confirmed cases, we provide estimations of the R 0 from 57 the 16th up to the 20th of January in order to satisfy as much as possible the 58 hypothesis of S \u2248 N that is a necessary condition for the computation of R 0 . 59 We also provide estimations of the case fatality (\u03b3) and case recovery (hat\u03b2) ratios 60 over the entire period using a rolling window of one day from the 11th of January to the 61 16th of January to provide the very first estimations. 62 Furthermore, we calibrated the parameters of the SIRD model to fit the reported 63 data. We first provide a coarse estimation of the recovery (\u03b2) and mortality rates (\u03b3) of 64 the SIRD model using the first period of the outbreak. Then, an estimation of the 65 infection rate \u03b1 is accomplished by \"wrapping\" around the SIRD simulator an 66 optimization algorithm to fit the reported data from the 11th of January to the 10th of 67 February. We have started our simulations with one infected person on the 16th of 68 November, which has been suggested as a starting date of the epidemic and run the SIR 69 model until the 10th of February. Below, we describe analytically our approach. Let us start by denoting with S(t), I(t), R(t), D(t), the number of susceptible, 71 infected, recovered and dead persons respectively at time t in the population of size N . 72 For our analysis, we assume that the total number of the population remains constant. 73 Based on the demographic data for the province of Hubei N = 59m. Thus, the discrete 74 SIRD model reads:",

This finding suggests an even lower value of the per day mortality rate 307 in the total population, than the one computed. 308 Importantly, under this scenario, the simulations shown in Fig ?? suggest a decline 309 of the outbreak at the end of February. Table 1 summarizes the above results for both 310 scenarios. 311 We note, that the results derived under Scenario II seem to predict a slow down of 312 the outbreak in Hubei after the end of February. However, we should also point out the high uncertainty in the three-weeks ahead 328 predictions as reflected by the big deviation between the lower and upper bounds of the 329 simulations at the end of the forecasting period. At this point we should note that our 330 SIRD modelling approach did not take into account many factors that play an 331 important role in the dynamics of the disease such as the effect of the incubation period 332 in the transmission dynamics, the heterogeneous contact transmission network, the 333 effect of the measures already taken to combat the epidemic, the characteristics of the 334 population (e.g. the effect of the age, people who had already health problems). Also 335 the estimation of the model parameters is based on an assumption, considering just the 336 first period in which the first cases were confirmed and reported. Of note, COVID-19, 337 which is thought to be principally transmitted from person to person by respiratory 338 droplets and fomites without excluding the possibility of the fecal-oral route [21] had 339 been spreading for at least over a month and a half before the imposed lockdown and 340 quarantine of Wuhan on January 23, having thus infected unknown numbers of people. 341 The number of asymptomatic and mild cases with subclinical manifestations that 342 probably did not present to hospitals for treatment may be substantial; these cases, 343 which possibly represent the bulk of the COVID-19 infections, remain unrecognized, 344 especially during the influenza season [22] . This highly likely gross under-detection and 345 underreporting of mild or asymptomatic cases inevitably throws severe disease courses 346 calculations and death rates out of context, distorting epidemiologic reality. Another 347 important factor that should be taken into consideration pertains to the diagnostic 348 criteria used to determine infection status and confirm cases. A positive PCR test was 349 required to be considered a confirmed case by China's Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia 350 Diagnosis and Treatment program in the early phase of the outbreak [14] . However, the 351 sensitivity of nucleic acid testing for this novel viral pathogen may only be 30-50%, 352 thereby often resulting in false negatives, particularly early in the course of illness. To 353 complicate matters further, the guidance changed in the recently-released fourth edition 354 of the program on February 6 to allow for diagnosis based on clinical presentation, but 355 only in Hubei province [14] .
