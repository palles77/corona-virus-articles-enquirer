            "text": "This paper analyses data arising from a SARS epidemic in Shanxi province of China involving a total of 354 people infected with SARS-CoV between late February and late May 2003. Using Bayesian inference, we have estimated critical epidemiological determinants. The estimated mean incubation period was 5.3 days (95% CI 4.2-6.8 days), mean time to hospitalisation was 3.5 days (95% CI 2.8-3.6 days), mean time from symptom onset to recovery was 26 days (95% CI 25-27 days) and mean time from symptom onset to death was 21 days (95% CI 16-26 days). The reproduction ratio was estimated to be 4.8 (95% CI 2.2-8.8) in the early part of the epidemic (February and March 2003) reducing to 0.75 (95% CI 0.65-0.85) in the later part of the epidemic (April and May 2003). The infectivity of symptomatic SARS cases in hospital and in the community was estimated. Community SARS cases caused transmission to others at an estimated rate of 0.4 per infective per day during the early part of the epidemic, reducing to 0.2 in the later part of the epidemic. For hospitalised patients, the daily infectivity was approximately 0.15 early in the epidemic, but fell to 0.0006 in the later part of the epidemic. Despite the lower daily infectivity level for hospitalised patients, the long duration of the hospitalisation led to a greater number of transmissions within hospitals compared with the community in the early part of the epidemic, as estimated by this study. This study investigated the individual infectivity profile during the * Corresponding address: Australian Mathematical Sciences Institute,",

Beginning in November 2002 in the Guangdong province of China, the SARS epidemic spread to Hong Kong, Viet Nam and Singapore by March 2003 and eventually to 29 countries around the world (Poon et al., 2004) . The World Health Organisation (WHO) issued a global alert on 12 March 2003 regarding a cluster of cases of severe atypical pneumonia and 3 days later gave a case definition and name to the condition (WHO, 2003c) . A novel coronavirus, named SARS-CoV, was identified as the infectious agent responsible for SARS in April 2003 (Drosten et al., 2003; Ksiazek et al., 2003; Peiris et al., 2003b) . In total, 8098 SARS infections and 774 deaths were reported in the 2002/2003 epidemic of SARS (Gumel et al., 2004) . The largest outbreaks occurred in mainland China, where 5327 infections and 349 deaths were reported (WHO, 2003a) . Despite the initial worldwide spread and early predictions of high case numbers, the 2003 SARS epidemic was contained relatively rapidly with no further spread reported after July 2003 .",

Early in the SARS pandemic, a majority of cases arose from hospital transmission in many places, including Toronto (Booth et al., 2003) , Hong Kong Wong et al., 2004) and Singapore . Later in the course of the epidemic, hospitals were effective sites of containment of SARS . Factors believed to be important in reducing nosocomial transmission of SARS include handwashing and wearing of masks, while contact with respiratory secretions is highly correlated with SARS transmission (Teleman et al., 2004) . Thorough contact tracing and quarantine of exposed cases led to reduced transmission in Singapore . In this study, we compare the estimated infectivity of SARS cases in the community and in hospitals. We also examine how this changes over time.",

Extending the SEIR model to include the two infectious compartments allows us to estimate the relative impact of hospitalised and community SARS cases on the epidemiology. Additionally, we can compare how infectivity changed over time in each group, reflecting the effects of interventions. In this section, we also estimate the change point; the date that marked the transition from high to relatively low infectivity. Finally, this study explores individual infectivity profiles over the course of SARS illness, see Section 8.",

The estimated incubation period, for a given data set, using this model would be expected to be longer than the estimations using the uniform probability model, but shorter than the estimates based on the assumption of immediate transmission. The constant hazard model has the advantage that it has a biologically plausible basis. However, because the estimated value of the hazard of transmission, \u03bb, had a large probability mass near zero in this study, it would be reasonable to use a uniform probability density function for time to transmission as an approximation. Figure C. 2 illustrates the estimated incubation period based on the two different models. There is little difference between the result of the incubation period assuming a constant hazard and that assuming a uniform probability of infection during the exposure period, and the subsequent conclusions of the model are robust to the estimates of \u03bb.

Little information was available in the data set regarding \u03bb; therefore, \u03bb took on a distribution similar to its prior probability, with a large probability mass near zero and a long tail. This effectively makes the model in which a constant hazard is assumed equivalent to the model of uniform probability, the model that suggests infection is equally likely at any stage during the exposure period. Even at the extreme values of \u03bb, the effects of the estimate of \u03bb on incubation period shown in Figure C. 2 are relatively small. Therefore, the conclusions of the subsequent components of the model are robust to the choice of model for transmission and the value of \u03bb. ",
