This study was aimed to develop an improved method for rapid recovery of CSFV directly from cloned cDNA. Full-length genomic cDNA from the CSFV Shimen strain, which was flanked by a T7 promoter, the hepatitis delta virus ribozyme and T7 terminator sequences, was cloned into the lowcopy vector pOK12, producing pOKShimen-RzT . Direct transfection of pOKShimen-RzT into PK/T7 cells, a PK-15derived cell line stably expressing bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase, allowed CSFV to be rescued rapidly and efficiently, i.e., at least 12 h faster and 31.6-fold greater viral titer when compared with the in vitro transcription-based rescue system. Furthermore, the progeny virus rescued from PK/T7 cells was indistinguishable, both in vitro and in vivo, from its parent virus and the virus rescued from classical reverse genetics. The reverse genetics based on intracellular transcription is efficient, convenient and cost-effective. The PK/T7 cell line can be used to rescue CSFV directly from cloned cDNA and it can also be used as an intracellular transcription and expression system for studying the structure and function of viral genes.",

            "text": "Reverse genetics of RNA viruses based on full-length infectious cDNA clones of viral genomes has emerged in the field of molecular virology to overcome the problem of in vitro viral RNA manipulation. Reverse genetics of RNA viruses rescues the viruses or their mutants from the cloned cDNA of viral RNA genomes in permissive cells or susceptible hosts. Generally, a full-length cDNA of viral genome is inserted into a plasmid, allowing infection using the cDNA clone itself or RNA transcribed from the cDNA in vitro. There are at least three methods for reverse genetic manipulation. The first is based on in vitro infectious RNA transcripts, the second is based on infectious RNA transcribed from cells, and the third is based on infectious cDNA clones (directly based on DNA). The second method uses recombinant viruses (e.g., vaccinia virus and fowlpox virus) (Baron and Barrett 1997; Evans et al. 2000) or stable cell lines (Radecke et al. 1995; Xiu et al. 2007; Freiberg et al. 2008 ) expressing RNA polymerases (RNAP) (e.g., T7 RNA polymerase) for the transcription of cloned cDNA in permissive cells. T7 RNAP is a DNA-dependant RNA polymerase derived from T7 bacteriophage that specifically recognizes T7 promoter sequence and has transcriptional activity in prokaryotic or eukaryotic cells. The T7 RNAP gene can be integrated into the genome of mammalian cells, where it is highly expressed and stable in many cell types (Elroy-Stein and Moss 1990). Thus, T7 RNAP is widely used in mo-lecular cloning and reverse genetic manipulation (Kwon et al. 2006) .",

To improve reverse genetics methods for CSFV, van Gennip et al. (1999) established a stable swine kidney cell line that expressed T7 RNAP (SK6.T7), which they used to develop a one-step method for the recovery of infectious CSFV from full-length genomic cDNA clones of CSFV C-strain based on SK6. T7 cells. This method improved recovery of infectious CSFV from full-length cDNAs with a 200-fold increase in viral titer when compared with in vitro transcribed RNA.

The infectious clone pPRKflc17 described by van Gennip et al.

Six overlapping DNA fragments that covered the complete genome of the CSFV Shimen strain were successively cloned into the pOK12 vector to construct pOKShimen.

Two fragments were amplified using two pairs of primers (P6F11267-11293 and P3UTRRz-R; Rz3UTR-F and PT7tNotI-R) to flank the Shimen strain genome with the HDV ribozyme (Rz) sequence (Perrotta and Been 1991) followed by the T7 terminator (T ) sequence (Dunn and Studier 1983) .
