Clinical samples (10 individual faecal swabs/flock) from 77 flocks aged 1-19 weeks were collected from different regions of the country. RT-PCR experiments were performed for detection and molecular characterization of TAstV using four sets of primers within the RdRp gene (ORF1b). The prevalence of astrovirus was 34/77 (44.15%) in the flocks tested. TAstV type 2 was associated with 30 of 77 infections (38.9%), either alone or in mixed infections; TAstV type 1 was detected in 9 of 77 flocks (11.6%), either alone or in mixed infections; ANV was detected only in one flock (1.29%) by sequence analysis during this study. Phylogenetic analysis revealed genetic variability in the TAstV strains that were isolated. Some of Polish TAstV-2 strains were genetically related to the North American isolates; however, most of them formed a distinct subgroup of ''European'' isolates, suggesting their separate origin or evolution. Additionally, due to the high variability of the TAstV sequences, the most suitable method for TAstV typing seems to be sequencing.",

Subsequently identified astroviruses were also associated with enteritis and affected a wide range of host species, such as lambs, calves, piglets, dogs, turkey poults, chickens, guinea fowl, red and roe deer, cats, mice, and mink [2, 4, 14, 16, 26] . Additionally, some astroviruses have also been associated with non-intestinal illness. In ducklings, the virus known as duck virus hepatitis type 2 (DVH2) causes fatal hepatitis, and in chickens, avian nephritis virus (ANV) results in mild growth depression, kidney lesions and mortality [8, 10] .",

The consequences, such as decreased weight gain, increased morbidity and mortality, poor feed conversion and increased use of therapeutic antimicrobial treatments, all contribute to important economic losses. Different terms have been used to describe enteric disease syndrome: runting-stunting syndrome of broilers (RSS), poult enteritis complex (PEC), and poult enteritis mortality syndrome (PEMS). However, none of these descriptions relates to the specific infectious agents, and numerous viruses have been associated with them. However, astroviruses seem to be the most frequently involved in enteritis [2, 8, 12, 13, 24] . Among five different astroviruses identified in avian species, three types have been detected in turkeys. Diarrhoea and increased mortality in turkey poults associated with the presence of an astrovirus, now called turkey astrovirus type 1 (TAstV-1), were described for the first time in 1980 in the United Kingdom [16] and, five years later, in the USA [24, 25] . Turkey astrovirus type 2 (TAstV-2), which is antigenically and genetically distinct from the previously identified TAstV-1, was isolated in the USA in 1996 [13] . With regard to ANV, initially antibodies against this virus were only found in turkey flocks in the UK and Japan [17, 28] . Subsequently, the virus was detected using molecular techniques in intestinal contents of healthy and diseased poults in the USA, but its prevalence is low [5, 20, 21] .",

AstV has a 6.8-7.9-kb positive-sense single-stranded RNA genome, which encodes three open reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b, which are linked by a translational frameshift, and ORF2). ORF1b encodes the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, and ORF2 encodes the capsid protein [3, 7, 11] . The ORF1b region is the most conserved gene in mammalian and avian astroviruses as well as in avian astroviruses [13] . On the other hand, ORF2 is the most variable region of the astrovirus genome and is possibly responsible for the antigenic and pathogenic diversity of astrovirus strains [23] . The family Astroviridae is divided into two genera: Mamastrovirus (mammalian astrovirus) and Avastrovirus (avian astrovirus). Recently, the Astroviridae Study Group of the International Committee for Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) has proposed a classification system based on genetic criteria instead of the host of origin. The genus Mamastrovirus includes19 astrovirus genotypes, and the genus Avastrovirus includes three genotypes that are distinguished based on the amino acid sequence of full-length ORF2 (http:// talk.ictvonline.org/files/proposals/taxonomy_proposals_ vertebrate1/m/vert01/2358.aspx).",

These isolates formed two subgroups (subgroups 1 and 2), with the majority being in subgroup 2 (17 isolates). In subgroup 1, three subclades (a, b, c) could be differentiated, and all six Polish isolates clustered in one subclade (a) together with astroviruses previously reported from the USA. Subclade b included strains from the USA, Italy and France that were isolated either from turkey or guinea fowl; however, the latter formed separate sublineages. Subclade c included strains only from the USA. A comparison of nucleotide and amino acid sequences of six Polish turkey astrovirus type 2 strains from subgroup 1, showed 93. 5-99.5% and 96.8-98 .9% similarity to each other and 86.9-91.2 and 93.5-96.8% to the prototype TAstV-2 isolate CA/00. Subgroup 2 TAstVs did not show any distinct subclades and included only European isolates Primer or/and probe positions refer to the sequences for A TAstV-1 (GenBank accession no. Y15936), B ANV Japan/CK/G-4260 (GenBank accession no. AB033998) and C TAstV-2 strain TAstV/CA/00 (GenBank accession no. EU143844) from Poland and Italy. Comparison of a 366-nucleotide region of ORF1b (from nt 4136 to 4502 of the TAstV-2 genome) revealed that, among these isolates, nt identity was between 96.9 and 100%, and deduced amino acid identity was between 97.6% and 100%. In turn, nucleotide and amino acid similarity of this subgroup to the prototype TAstV-2 was 89.5-90.6% and 95.3-96.5%, respectively. Indeed, these isolates formed a separate subgroup, but its distinction was rather weakly supported statistically (bootstrap value 60).",

            "text": "As with other poultry diseases, many molecular methods are used for diagnosis of etiological factors in enteric diseases of birds. For detection of chicken and turkey astroviruses, RT-PCR-based methods have been developed that target conserved regions of ORFs1b and ORF2, which encode the viral polymerase and capsid protein, respectively [4, 5, 29, 30] . Because mixed infections with various types of astrovirus were identified in some cases, there was a need to distinguish between them. At first, the differentiation of four types of astroviruses, TAstV-1, TAstV-2, CAstV and ANV, relied on sequencing the amplicons. More recently, a new multiplex RT-PCR assay with primers specific for each of the four types of astroviruses was developed and used for survey of enteric viruses in the USA [5] . Overall, this method was unsuitable for differentiation of Polish isolates of astrovirus. Some isolates had additional changes in their nt sequences that prevented correct identification of astrovirus types (e.g., in the ORF1b sequence of PL/TK/G085/08, targeted by the T1pol1F primer, next to the three degenerate nucleotides, there were three additional nt mismatches; in the ORF1b sequence of PL/TK/G145/08 targeted by the ANVpolF primer, next to the four degenerate nucleotides, there were two additional nt changes). On the other hand, the usefulness of the primer set developed by Tang et al. [29] for detection of astrovirus seems to have been confirmed, as it was possible to detect astroviruses with many sequence variations. The presence of astrovirus in 44.15% (34/77) of Polish turkey flocks studied during 2008 is reported. The most frequently identified was TAstV-2, with samples positive from 30 of 77 flocks (38.9%), either as single or mixed infections. TAstV-1 was detected in only nine flocks, either as single or mixed infections (11.6) . ANV was detected in one flock (1.29%). These figures indicate that the prevalence of TAstVs in Poland was lower when compared with a prevalence of 84% reported in commercial turkey flocks during a survey in Minnesota, USA, during 2007-2008 by Jindal et al., or of 59%, reported in the UK; however, the prevalence in Poland was comparable to reports from Brazil (41.1%), as reported by Villarreal et al. [9, 12, 32] . However, it should be noted that in all the previous studies, astrovirus detection was focused only on the TAstV-2 type.",

For ORF1b of TAstV-2, two subgroups could be distinguished. In subgroup 1, three subclades were identified. All six Polish TAstV-2 isolates clustered in subclade a together with North American isolates of group 1 identified by Pantin-Jackwood at al. and astroviruses from group 2 identified by Jindal at al. [4, 12, 18] . Subclade b included North American isolates from group 2 identified by Pantin-Jackwood et al. and from group 1 identified by Jindal et al. as well as TAstV from Italian group G1. In our comparison, AstV isolates from guinea fowl from Italy that were previously assigned to the G3 group and isolates from France (sequences available in GenBank) also clustered in subclade b, but in separate sublineages. Subgroup 2 included only European isolates originating from Italy (isolated in 2004/05) and Poland (2008) . Italian isolates from this subgroup were previously described as a distinct genetic lineage, G2 [4] . A similar subgrouping of European and ''American-like'' isolates of TAstV-2 was previously indicated by Maurel at al. [15] . However, the comparison of sequences of Polish and French TAstV strains was not possible, since the sequences were not available in the public domain.",

The most frequently identified were TAstV-2, with TAstV-1 occurring rarely and ANV occasionally. Isolated astroviruses were found to be genetically variable based on the sequence analysis reported here. This diversification was particularly noticeable among Polish TAstV-2 strains, as some of them were genetically related to the North American isolates. However, most of them formed a distinct subgroup of ''European'' isolates, suggesting their separate origin or evolution. In spite of the fact that some isolates were from healthy flocks, it could not be ruled out that astroviruses caused the observed health problems and poor performance of meat-type turkey flocks in Poland. It should be also mentioned that in the light of the new classification rules, none of the Polish turkey astroviruses studied here could be assigned to any of the genotypes. In order to enable classification of these viruses, a phylogenetic analysis of the full-length ORF2 gene is needed, and according to the new taxonomy proposal, they are classified as '' related viruses that might be members of the genus Avastrovirus but have not been assigned to a species'' [23] .",
