Motivated in part by these experiments, we performed simulations using a coarse-grained model of RNA to describe the response of a PK over a range of mechanical forces (f s) and monovalent salt concentrations (Cs). The coarse-grained simulations quantitatively reproduce the multistep thermal melting observed in experiments, thus validating our model. The free energy changes obtained in simulations are in excellent agreement with experiments. By varying f and C, we calculated the phase diagram that shows a sequence of structural transitions, populating distinct intermediate states.",

Finally, the 5 -end hairpin unravels, producing an extended state (E I). A theoretical analysis of the phase boundaries shows that the critical force for rupture scales as (log Cm) \u03b1 with \u03b1 = 1 (0.5) for E I (I F) transition. This relation is used to obtain the preferential ion-RNA interaction coefficient, which can be quantitatively measured in single-molecule experiments, as done previously for DNA hairpins. A by-product of our work is the suggestion that the frameshift efficiency is likely determined by the stability of the 5 end hairpin that the ribosome first encounters during translation.",

Among them, one of the simplest structural motifs is the RNA pseudoknot (PK), which is involved in many biological functions. The simplest type, referred to as H-type PK, consists of two stems connected by two loops in which one of the stems forms base pairs with the loop of the other. The PK motif, found in many RNA molecules such as telomerase [8] , mRNA [9] , ribosomal RNA [10] , transfer-messenger RNA, and viral RNA [11] , is functionally important [12] . For instance, a PK in the human telomerase RNA is essential for enzyme (a ribonucleoprotein complex) activity [13] . Many pathogenic mutations in the human telomerase RNA are found in the wellconserved PK region of the RNA, further underscoring the importance of the PK [8, 13] . The presence of PKs is also important in ribozyme catalysis and inhibition of ribosome translation.",

            "text": "Recently, there is heightened interest in the biophysics of PK folding because it plays a crucial role in affecting the efficiency of \u22121 programmed ribosomal frameshifting (\u22121 PRF) [14] [15] [16] . Usually, proteins are synthesized when the ribosome reads the mRNA code in three nucleotide steps until the stop codon is reached. In \u22121 PRF, the open reading frame of mRNA being translated within the ribosome is programmed to be shifted by one nucleotide, and consequently, the mRNA becomes nonfunctional or produces an entirely different protein [5, [17] [18] [19] [20] . The downstream PK of the mRNA is a roadblock at the entrance to the mRNA channel on the ribosome, which impedes the translocation of the ribosome. The ribosome must unfold the PK, presumed to occur by exertion of mechanical force, to complete translocation. Because frameshifting efficiency could depend on how the PK responds to force, a number of single-molecule pulling experiments have focused on PKs [15, 21, 22] . Several factors could determine \u22121 PRF, as evidenced by the multitude of proposals based on many experimental studies [14, 15, [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] . Nevertheless, given that ribosome translocation exerts mechanical force on the downstream mRNA, it is physically reasonable to assume that resistance of PK to force should at least be one factor determining the frameshifting efficiency [14, 29] .",

This PK has been the subject of several ensemble experiments, which have characterized the folding thermodynamics as a function of monovalent and divalent cations [30, 31] . The BWYV PK has two stems (S1 and S2) connected by two loops (L1 and L2) as shown in Fig. 1 . The crystal structure reveals that L2 forms triplex-type tertiary interactions with S1 [32] . In another context, it has been shown that such interactions and mutations affecting them dramatically change the efficiency of frameshifting [21] . In vitro and in vivo experiments on many mutants of BWYV suggest [32] color-coded according to secondary structures. The black arrows indicate positions at which the external mechanical force is applied. (B) Schematic representation of the secondary structure.

In order to provide a theoretical basis for the changes in the stability and structural transitions as f and monovalent salt concentration (C) are altered, we performed simulations using a coarse-grained three-site-interaction model (TIS model) [34] of the PK. After demonstrating that our simulations reproduce the temperature-induced structural transitions observed in ensemble experiments, we calculated the global phase diagrams in the [C, f ] plane. The simulations, performed in the same force range as used in Laser Optical Tweezer (LOT) experiments [19] , quantitatively reproduce the experimental observations. By combining our simulations and a theory based on ion-RNA interactions expressed in terms of preferential interaction coefficients [31, 35] , we produce several key predictions: (1) The phase diagram in the [C, f ] plane shows that the folded state (F) ruptures in stages populating dis-tinct intermediates as f increases. Structurally, the low force intermediate is similar to the one populated during thermal melting. The sequence of f -induced structural transitions can be described as F I E, where E is an extended state; (2) The critical force, f c , to rupture the PK scales as (log C m ) \u03b1 with \u03b1 = 1 for the I E transition and \u03b1 = 0.5 for the I F transition. We expect this result to be valid for H-type PKs composed of stems with vastly different stability, such as the BWYV PK. This result is of general validity and is applicable to other PKs as well.",

These values are similar to those obtained directly from the crystal structure (R native ee = 2.8 nm, R native g = 1.3 nm). (2) At T = 60 \u2022 C, the free energy profile for U L HB shows that some of the tertiary interactions, involving L1 and L2, are no longer stably formed (Fig. S1B ). On the other hand, G(R g ) shows two stable minima, indicating that there are two possible states (Fig. 2B) . In one state, both stems S1 and S2 are formed but tertiary interactions are absent, corresponding to the I1 state identified using UV absorbance and differential scanning calorimetry experiments (Fig. 3) [30, 31] . The other conformation, in which only S1 is formed, has been also observed in experiments and is referred to as the I2 state. It should be noted that the distribution of U S HB also has two minima at 60 \u2022 C (Fig. S1A) whereas G(R ee ) has only one minimum ( Fig. 2A). (3) At a still higher temperature T = 80 \u2022 C, G(R ee ) and G(R g ) each have a minimum with S1 stably formed. This is also reflected in Fig. S1 , which shows a minimum at U S HB \u2248 \u221230 kcal/mol and a minimum at U S HB \u2248 0. Thus, completely unfolded conformations, U state, and the I2 state are populated. (4) At T = 110 \u2022 C, both U S HB and U L HB are 0 , indicating that only the U state exists. This is also reflected in G(R ee ) and G(R g ), which show that the PK is completely unfolded.

Although simulations can be used to distinguish I1 and F states, the intermediate does not have significant population. The identification of I1 in our simulations provides a structural support to experiments in which I1 was inferred from three broad overlapping peaks in the heat capacity curves [30, 31] . It should be stressed that the experimental heat capacity curves exhibit only two discernible peaks, which would normally imply that there is only one intermediate present. The range of melting temperatures for the three transitions can be obtained from the temperature dependence of the various states f \u03b1 (T ) (\u03b1=F, I1, I2 or U) given in Fig. 2C . The I1 state has a maximum population around T \u2248 50 \u2022 C. We equate this with the melting temperature T m1 associated with the F I1 transition. Similarly, T m2 for the I1 I2 transition is \u2248 70 \u2022 C. The T m3 for the I2 U transition occurs around 90 \u2022 C (f I2 (T m3 ) = f U (T m3 )). The values of the three melting temperatures obtained in our simulations are in remarkable agreement with experiments (T exp. m1 =59.4 \u2022 C, T exp. m2 =69.4 \u2022 C, and T exp. m3 =91.2 \u2022 C taken from results of a differential scanning calorimetry experiment at pH=7 in Table 1 of Nixon and Giedroc [30] ).",

            "text": "Determination of the phase diagram in the [C, f ] plane requires an appropriate order parameter that can distinguish between the various states. In single-molecule pulling experiments, the variable that can be measured is the molecular extension, R ee , which is conjugated to the applied force. The overall size of the RNA molecule is assessed using the radius of gyration, R g . Therefore, we characterized the states of the RNA using both R g and R ee as order parameters. The values of the predicted R g at f = 0 can be measured using scattering experiments. Using these two parameters, we obtained the [C, f ] phase diagram (Fig. 4) . Comparison of the diagram of states in Figs. 4D and 4E reveals common features and some differences. From Figs. 4D and 4E, we infer that at f > 12.5 pN, extended (E) conformations are dominant at all values of C. As the force decreases, the PK forms compact structures. The boundary separating the extended and relatively compact phases depends on the salt concentration and the value of the mechanical force. The critical force to rupture the compact structures increases linearly as a function of logarithm of salt concentration ( Fig. 4D ; boundary between red and green regions). At low forces (f < 2.5 pN), the diagram of states based on R ee shows that the extension is relatively small as C changes from a low to a high value. From this finding, one might be tempted to infer that the PK is always folded, which is not physical especially at low (C \u2248 10 mM) ion concentrations. In contrast, Fig. 4E shows that below 5 pN, there is a transition from compact structures (R g \u2248 1.3 nm in the blue region) at high C to an intermediate state (R g > 2.2 nm in the green region) at C \u2248 100 mM. The differences between the diagrams of states in the [C, f ] plane using R ee and R g as order parameters are more vividly illustrated in terms of the free energy profiles G(R \u03b1 ) = \u2212k B T log(R \u03b1 ) where R \u03b1 is R ee or R g (Fig. 5 ). The profiles G(R ee ), at three values of C and different f values, show two minima at most. At f = 0, there is only one discernible minimum at R ee \u2248 4.2 nm at C = 10 mM. The minimum moves to R ee \u2248 3 nm at C = 1200 mM corresponding to a folded PK. At f = 5 pN there are two minima at C = 10 mM corresponding to a compact structure and a stretched conformation (see the cyan profile in Fig. 5A ). As f exceeds 5 pN, there is essentially one minimum whose position increases as f increases. In the force regime (f > 5 pN), only the E state is visible at all C.",

The free energy profiles show that under force, there are minimally three states, which are F, I, and E.

The [C, f ] phase diagram (Fig. 6A ) calculated using the average Q is similar to the R g -phase diagram (Fig. 4E) , indicating the presence of three states (Fig. 6A ). Using Q, we can also quantitatively assess the contributions from different structural elements to the stability of the PK and correctly infer the order in which the structural elements of the PK rupture as f is increased. In order to determine the structural details of each state, we calculated the individual Qs for the two stems (Q S1 , Q S2 ) and the two loops (Q L1 Q L2 ) (Fig. 6B) . The dependence of Q S1 as a function of C and f shows that Stem 1 (S1) is extremely stable and remains intact at all salt concentrations, rupturing only at f \u2248 10 pN (Fig. 6B , upper left panel). In contrast, the upper right panel in Fig. 6B shows that Stem 2 (S2) is only stably folded above a moderate salt concentration (C \u2248 80 mM) and low f . The stability difference between S1 and S2 can be explained by the number of canonical G-C base pairs; S1 has five G-C base pairs, whereas only three such pairs are in S2. Consequently, S1 cannot be destabilized even at low C, but its rupture to produce extended states requires the use of mechanical force. Above C > 100 mM, the fraction of contacts associated with S2 and the two loops (Q S2 , Q L1 and Q L2 ) simultaneously increase. All the interactions are, however, still not completely formed (Q \u2248 0.8) even at the highest salt concentration, C = 1200 mM. In particular, the contacts involving L2, Q L2 \u2248 0.6, implying that tertiary interactions are only marginally stable at T = 50 \u2022 C.",

However, they capture only the average property of the ensemble within each state without the benefit of providing a molecular picture of the distinct states, which can only be described using simulations done at force values close to those used in LOT experiments. Therefore, we investigated the distribution of interactions to ascertain the factors that stabilize the three states as C and f are varied. Our analysis is based on the HB energy, U HB . The energy function for HB captures the formation of base pairs and loop-stem tertiary interactions, taking into account both distance and angular positions of the donor and the acceptor [37] . Fig. 7 shows that the probability densities of the total HB energy have three peaks at U HB \u2248 0, \u221230, and \u221260 kcal/mol. In the high-force regime (f > 12.5 pN), there is only one population at all C around U HB \u2248 0, which obviously corresponds to the fully extended state. The total HB energy can be decomposed into contributions arising from four distinct structural motifs in the PK (Fig. S5) . The peak at U HB \u2248 \u221230 kcal/mol (Fig. 7) arises due to the formation of S1 (compare Figs. 7 and S5A). The broad peak at U HB \u2248 \u221260 kcal/mol (Fig. 7A) is due to the sum of contributions from S2 and the tertiary interactions.",

Low C and high f correspond to the top left region in the phase diagrams (Figs. 4 and 6) . In all conditions, S1 is the first to form as indicated by the presence of distinct peaks at C > 100 mM and f 10 pN in Fig. S5A . Under more favorable conditions (f < 10 pN; C \u2248 300 mM or greater) S2 and tertiary interactions involving L1 are established (Figs. S5 B and C). Only at the highest value of C and f 5 pN, tertiary interactions involving L2 emerge. Interestingly, the order of formation of the various structural elements en route to the formation of their folded state follows the stabilities of the individual elements with the most stable motif forming first. The PK tertiary interactions are consolidated only after the assembly of the stable structural elements. This finding follows from our earlier work establishing that the hierarchical assembly of RNA PKs is determined by the stabilities of individual structural elements [38] .",

Thus, the actual population is distributed between I1 and F, and the tertiary interactions are only marginally stable in the conditions examined here. Soto et al. suggested that diffuse Mg 2+ ions play an important role in stabilizing such tertiary interactions [31] . Because Mg 2+ is not considered here, we cannot determine the precise interactions stabilizing the I1 state, especially at f = 0.

In giving from F\u2194I, there is only a rupture of few tertiary interactions and unfolding of the relatively unstable S2. Because this transition is not cooperative (interactions break in a sequential manner), we believe that a linear behavior over a limited force range is not unreasonable. In contrast, the unfolding of S1 is cooperative, like some hairpins studied using pulling experiments, in the E \u2194 I transition, resulting in the constant value for \u2206R ee over the force range probed.

For the transition between I and F, fitting the dependence of \u2206R IF ee on f IF c with a = 0.14 nm/pN and b = 0.27 nm (Fig. 9C) , we estimate \u2206\u0393 IF = 1.8 using Eq.(6) (Fig. 8D) .

More recently, we have incorporated the consequences of counter ion condensation into the TIS model, allowing us to predict thermodynamic properties of RNA hairpins and PK that are in remarkable agreement with experiments [37] . In the TIS model, each nucleotide is represented by three coarse-grained spherical beads corresponding to phosphate (P), ribose sugar (S), and a base (B). Briefly, the effective potential energy (for details, see Ref.

Thus, the parameters are transferable and we use them verbatim in the present simulations. The determination of hydrogen bond interaction is predicated on the structure. Most of these are taken from the A-form RNA structure and hence can be readily used for any RNA molecule.

Because of the highly charged nature of the polyanion, counterions condense onto the RNA, thus effectively reducing the effective charge per phosphate. The extent of charge reduction can be calculated using the Oosawa-Manning theory. Charge renormalization, first used in the context of RNA folding by Heilman-Miller et al. [51] and more recently incorporated into CG models for RNA by us [37] and others [52, 53] , is needed to predict accurately the thermodynamics and kinetics of RNA folding [54] . The renormalized value of the charge on the P group is approximately .

The mean distance (b) between charges on RNA is difficult to estimate (except for rod-like polyelectrolytes) because of its shape fluctuations. Therefore, it should be treated as an adjustable parameter. In our previous study, we showed that b = 4.4\u00c5 provides an excellent fit of the thermodynamics of RNA hairpins and the MMTV pseudoknot [37] . We use the same value in the present study of BWYV as well. Thus, the force field used in this study is the same as in our previous study attesting to its transferability for simulating small RNA molecules.",

The [C, f ] phase diagram is calculated at a somewhat elevated temperature, T =50 \u2022 C, in order to observe multiple folding-unfolding transitions when the monovalent salt concentration is varied over a wide range, from 5 to 1200 mM. The numerical integration is performed using the leap-frog algorithm with time step length \u03b4t L = 0.05\u03c4 , where \u03c4 is the unit of time. We performed low friction Langevin dynamics simulations to enhance the rate of conformational sampling [56] . For each condition (C and f ), we performed 50 independent simulations for 6 \u00d7 10 8 time steps and the last two-third of trajectories are used for data analyses. In addition, we also performed a set of simulations using the replicaexchange molecular dynamics (REMD) to confirm the validity of the results obtained by the low friction Langevin dynamics simulations [57] . In the REMD simulations, both C and f are treated as replica variables and are exchanged between 256 replicas, by covering C from 1 to 1200 mM and f from 0 to 20 pN. The replicas are distributed over 16 \u00d7 16 grid. The combined set of simulations using different protocols assures us that the simulations are converged at all conditions. Our simulations are done at constant forces under equilibrium conditions in which we observe multiple transitions between the various states. We have made comparison to LOT experiments, which are performed by pulling the RNA at a constant velocity. In general, if RNA is stretched at a constant velocity, then one has to be concerned about non-equilibrium effects. However, in optical tweezer experiments, the pulling speed is low enough so that the tension propagates uniformly throughout the RNA prior to initiation of unfolding [58] . Thus, the unfolding of PK studied using LOT experiments [19] occurs at equilibrium, justifying comparisons to our explicit equilibrium simulations.",

The assessment of HB formation is based on the instantaneous value of the HB interaction energy, U HB . In our model, each HB interaction pair contributes up to nU 0 HB toward stability, where U 0 HB is -2.43 kcal/mol, corresponding to the stability of one HB, and n represents number of HB associated in the interaction [37] . A cutoff value nU C HB is defined to pick out contacts that are established. We use a value, U C HB = \u22121.15 kcal/mol to obtain the diagram using Q as an order parameter.

The blue dashed line is the theoretical prediction where fc \u221d log Cm [Eq.4]. Circles (\u2022) indicate conditions with \u2206GEI = 0 extracted from linear dependence of \u2206G on log C in (A). It should be noted that the E state is under tension, and hence is different from the unfolded state upon thermal melting at f = 0. (D) Same as (C) except the results describe I F transition. Here, the critical force describing the phase boundary is a nonlinear function of log Cm [Eq.6].",

All the conditions shown here are near the phase boundaries in the [C, f ] plane (\u2206GEI and \u2206GIF between the two states are close to 0). Distances between peaks of the two distributions are shown. In the E I transition (A), the mean distances are almost constant around 4.9 nm. On the other hand, in the I F transition (B), the mean distance becomes smaller as the mechanical force weakens. (C) Dependence of \u2206Ree on fc along the phase boundaries. In the I F transition, the dependence can be fit using \u2206R IF ee = af IF c + b, where a = 0.14 nm/pN and b = 0.27 nm (solid line).",
