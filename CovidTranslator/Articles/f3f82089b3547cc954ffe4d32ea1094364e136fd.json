The objective of this study was to determine and compare the frequency distribution of the various infectious etiologies for these diseases. One hundred seventy five adults in the community with febrile LRTI and 75 with febrile URTI were included in a purely serologically based prospective study. Paired sera were obtained for each of the patients and were tested by EIA or immunofluorescence methods to identify 14 different pathogens. Only a significant change in antibody titers between the paired sera was considered diagnostic. At least one infectious etiology was identified in 167 patients (67%). In the LRTI group, infection with at least one of 7 respiratory viruses was found in 88 patients (50%). One of the atypical pathogens was found in 40 patients (23%), of these Legionella spp. in 19 (11%) and Mycoplasma pneumoniae in 18 (10%). A bacterial etiology was found in 19 patients (11%), of these Streptococcus pneumoniae in 8 (5%) and \u2424-hemolytic streptococci group A in 5 (3%). The frequency distribution of etiologies in the URTI group was not significantly different from the LRTI group, except for M. pneumoniae that was identified in only one patient with URTI (p \u03ed 0.015). More than one etiologic agent was found in 42 (17%) of the patients. LRTI is caused by a broad spectrum of etiologies, with respiratory viruses predominating and a moderate, but significant, prevalence of atypical pathogens. The frequency distribution of etiologies for URTI is similar to LRTI. In a significant proportion of patients with URTI and LRTI there is serologic evidence of infection with more than one pathogen. The justification and benefit of distinguishing between URTI and LRTI in routine clinical work is doubtful. When a decision is reached to treat RTI patients with an antibiotic, it is logical to use a macrolide or tetracycline.",

The broad diagnosis of RTI includes the two principal sub-diagnoses of lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) and upper respiratory tract infection (URTI), although it is often difficult to distinguish between them. The vast majority of RTI cases run a benign course, so it is not justified in routine practice to invest effort and means to identify the precise etiology. Primary care physicians who are called upon to reach management decisions for RTI patients should base these decisions, among other factors, on the known frequency distribution of etiologies for this type of infection. Data in the literature on these etiologies (Billas, 1990; Gleckman, 1987; Macfarlane et al., 1993; Monto & Cavallaro, 1971; Verheij et al., 1989) are based primarily on studies that did not utilize advanced diagnostic techniques that have been developed recently.",

Shortly afterwards the blood samples were separated and the serum was frozen at -20\u00b0C until the serologic tests were performed. Each of the patients underwent a chest x-ray (P-A and lateral). Treatment decisions were reached by the treating physicians, without intervention by the study team. Telephone follow-ups of symptoms were conducted by a follow-up team at 48 -72 h intervals. The follow-up focused on questions about the continuation of fever, the appearance of new symptoms and the continued presence or disappearance of the respiratory tract symptoms. The telephone follow-up continued until the patient was free of complaints and gradually returned to his/her usual schedule of activity. Three to four weeks after entering the study the patients were invited for a follow-up visit. At this meeting a second blood sample was drawn from each patient for convalescence phase serology. Patients with a positive throat culture or suspected pneumonia in the acute phase of their illness also underwent repeat throat cultures or chest x-rays, accordingly. Pneumonia was diagnosed only in patients with a suspected lung infiltrate that disappeared or cleared significantly in the follow-up x-ray.",

Table 1 presents a comparison of demographic data, smoking history and chronic co-morbidity between the two groups. All 250 patients, without exception, came to the follow-up appointment. A convalescence serum sample was drawn from all the patients at a mean interval of 26.2 \u03ee 7.1 days (range 19 -47 days) after the acute phase sample. The disease course in all 250 patients was benign and all recovered completely without significant complications or need for hospitalization. Table 2 shows a comparison of the clinical manifestations of acute respiratory tract infection in the two groups. No comparisons were done for the clinical parameters that served as diagnostic criteria for LRTI, as such a comparison would be meaningless. Table 3 presents the frequency distribution of the various infectious etiologies that were identified in each of the two groups, and a comparison between them. At least one infectious etiology was identified in 167 patients (67%), of whom 115 (66%) were in the LRTI group and 52 (69%) were in the URTI group. As can be seen in this table, the only statistically significant difference between the groups was for Mycoplasma pneumoniae. The relatively low rate of C. pneumoniae infections stems from the diagnostic requirement of a fourfold increase in antibody titer between the acute and convalescence phase sera, that was also used for other pathogens. Had we related to a high antibody titer, without change between the paired sera, as evidence of acute infection with C. pneumoniae, we would have identified this pathogen in 28 patients (16%) in the LRTI group and in 14 patients (19%) in the URTI group. In 11 of the 12 patients in whom pneumococcal infection was diagnosed a significant change in the level of pneumococcal antibodies was detected, while in only one patient the diagnosis was based only on the presence of specific pneumococcal immune complexes in the two sera.",

Because of the small sample size in that study and the difficulty in distinguishing on clinical grounds between LRTI and URTI, the two sub-groups were united under the title of RTI. The lessons learned from that study and from other studies using the same methodology had particular bearing on the serologic criteria for diagnosis of acute infection in the broad range of respiratory pathogens tested. Using accepted serologic criteria in the previous study we considered high antibody titers (particularly IgM or IgA, but in the case of C. pneumoniae IgG as well), which were unchanged between the paired sera, as evidence of acute infection with the specific agent. This diagnostic approach increased the sensitivity of the tests but reduced their specificity. We could not be certain using these criteria that all identified cases represented actual acute infections and not persistently high antibody titers resulting from a previous infection or an expression of chronic infection with a specific pathogen. Thus, in the present study we diagnosed acute infection only in the presence of a significant increase in the antibody titer or level between the paired sera in one of the specific immunoglobulins. This strategy increased our confidence that the identified pathogen was indeed the etiologic cause of the RTI, but at the same time it reduced the sensitivity of the tests and is responsible, at least in part, for our finding that in one third of the patients the infectious agent is unknown.",

However, we preferred serologic testing to isolation of pathogens from respiratory secretions. The microbial culture methods may have a very low sensitivity for some pathogens, and even when a potential pathogen is isolated from secretions there is no way of proving that its presence is not due to contamination unrelated to the disease, especially in the case of pneumococcus, H. influenzae, and M. catarrhalis, which belong to the normal microbial flora of the upper respiratory tract. In contrast, a significant change in antibody titer for a specific pathogen between the paired sera usually indicates a significant association between the pathogen and the host with a high level of probability for a cause-effect relationship between the pathogen and the disease.",

            "text": "In a comprehensive search of the literature only one study of the broad range of etiologies of LRTI among adults in the community was found (Macfarlane et al., 1993) . In that study pneumococcus was the dominant etiology with an almost non-existent prevalence of atypical pathogens. The population in that study was significantly older and had a higher rate of chronic co-morbidity, particularly chronic respiratory problems, than our population. The pneumococcal etiology was diagnosed in that study by the presence of the bacterium or its antigen in sputum, in contrast to the present study in which we purposely avoided this approach, as discussed above. The spectrum of etiologies that was tested in that study did not include most of the Legionella spp. and the diagnostic methods for viruses and atypical pathogens were much less sensitive than those used in the present study. The methodological differences between these studies provide an explanation for the striking difference between the etiologic distributions found in the two studies. The frequency distribution for LRTI found in our study points to a clear dominance of viral etiologies, significant rates of atypical pathogen etiologies particularly M. pneumoniae, and various Legionella spp. and only a small portion of the classic bacterial etiologies. The distribution found in our study is closer to that appearing in the literature, namely that \"acute bronchitis is caused frequently by viruses, less commonly by M. pneumoniae and rarely by bacterial pathogens, namely Legionella spp, and Bordetella pertussis\" (Gleckman, 1987) . We believe that the difference between the present study and these studies in the prevalence of Legionella spp. is due to the progress made over the past decade in serologic diagnostic techniques for the identification of these pathogens. This progress, which is manifested in the results of our study, were not available for studies that were conducted more than ten years ago. Our findings in relation to several specific etiologies require further discussion. C. pneumoniae was identified in only two patients in the LRTI group. This percentage is low in both absolute and relative terms to the rate of infections with this pathogen reported in a previous study (Grayston et al., 1986) . The reason for this low rate of C. pneumoniae infections in contrast to previous studies is that in our study we diagnosed acute infection with this pathogen only in the presence of a significant increase in antibody titer between the paired sera. This contrasts with earlier studies in which high antibody titers were considered diagnostic of acute infection even without change between paired sera. Today, high IgG and IgA titers for C. pneumoniae without change between acute and convalescence phase sera in COPD patients are viewed as evidence of chronic infection with this pathogen (von Hertzen et al., 1997) . Thus, we decided that it would be wrong to diagnosis all patients in our study with high antibody titers as suffering from an acute infection with this pathogen. If we had used those parameters we would have identified 42 patients as serologically positive for C. pneumoniae, with 16% in the LRTI group and 19% in the URTI group. In addition to the high positivity rates in absolute terms, this method would not have demonstrated the sharp difference in rates of infection with this pathogen between LRTI and URTI, which have been reported in the past (Grayston et al., 1986) .",

The principal reason for these differences between the present and previous studies is the number and type of specific serogroups included under the heading Legionella spp. In the vast majority of previous studies only L. pneumophila was identified, and in most cases only its serotype 1. This serogroup of Legionella causes severe illness in a large percentage of infected patients that involves the lung parenchyma and is responsible apparently for reports of CAP that necessitates hospitalization in intensive care units (Hirani & Macfarlane, 1997; Woodhead et al., 1986) . In contrast, in the present study we tested 40 other serogroups of Legionella spp. in addition to serotype 1. Since a significant change in antibody titer was found in all 28 patients with Legionella spp. for at least one of these serogroups, it is reasonable to assume that there is a significant association between that serogroup and the RTI.",

The prevalence rates of these bacteria in our study were very low. This finding contrasts strongly with the results of a previous study of ours that found a positive serologic rate of 42.8% for S. pneumoniae in hospitalized CAP patients (Lieberman et al., 1996) . This striking difference in prevalence rates for S. pneumoniae between the two populations was found even though the tests were done in the same laboratory using the same methods. We believe that this difference provides evidence for the high level of reliability of the tests and indicates that although S. pneumoniae is a very common etiology among hospitalized CAP patients, its prevalence is very low among LRTI and URTI patients in the community.",

Second, there may be other viral etiologies, such as rhinovirus and coronavirus, which are known to cause acute bronchitis (Gleckman, 1987) but are technically difficult to diagnose. It is possible that some of the patients in our study were infected with these viruses, although as a general rule these infections cause an afebrile illness (Gleckman, 1987) while all the patients in this study were febrile.",

The association of more than one infectious agent with the development of respiratory tract infection is well known (Verheij et al., 1989) and has been attributed in the past to bacterial infection that is secondary to viral infection. Two studies that used advanced serologic techniques to assess the etiology of CAP in hospitalized patients reported a high rate of 38% of patients with evidence of more than one etiology (Kauppinen et al., 1995; Lieberman et al., 1996) . Those studies, like the present one, found all possible combinations of pathogens and not only an association between bacteria and viruses. Since RTI and CAP involve infection of the same system and have overlap features, it is likely that the pathophysiological explanations given for the phenomenon of multiple etiologies in CAP (Lieberman et al., 1996) are valid for RTI as well. Despite the absence of statistical significance (because of the small number of patients) there is a clear trend to increased rates of multiple etiologies in the LRTI group (19%) compared to the URTI group (11%). This difference, together with the rate of 38% of patients with more than one etiology in CAP, leads to the conclusion that this phenomenon increases in prevalence as the infection involves lower regions of the respiratory tract, i.e., lowest in URTI, higher in LRTI and highest in CAP. This phenomenon can be viewed from the opposite perspective, i.e., if more pathogens are involved in the infection, the infectious process involves lower regions of the respiratory system.",

This overlap is particularly well demonstrated in Table 2 , which presents a comparison of clinical manifestations between the two groups and shows that clinical signs that are characteristic of one type of infection also appear at relatively high rates in the other. The division of RTI is also not necessary on pathophysiological grounds, since the upper and lower respiratory tracts are continuous and the ciliary structure of the mucosa is identical in both. From the theoretical standpoint it is important to diagnose and treat all patients with CAP with antibiotics, but only those RTI patients without CAP who have pharyngitis or tonsillitis caused by group A \u2424-hemolytic streptococci. Beyond these latter two diagnoses, there is no therapeutic significance to the differentiation between URTI and LRTI since in neither case is there clear cut justification for antibiotic therapy. Another aspect that might have provided justification for the division of RTI is the etiologic distribution. The important finding in our study in this respect is that there is no significant difference in the frequency distribution of infectious etiologies between URTI and LRTI, except for M. pneumoniae.",

Classic bacterial etiologies were identified in a low rate of patients in both RTI subgroups, but it is reasonable to assume that antibiotic therapy would have a favorable effect on outcome in these patients. The results of this study cannot contradict the conventional approach that antibiotic therapy is not indicated in RTI (Gleckman, 1987) , or at least that its use is controversial (Billas, 1990) .
