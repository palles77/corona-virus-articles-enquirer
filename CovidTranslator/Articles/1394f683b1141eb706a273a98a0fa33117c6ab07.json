Seasonality has been reported for many viruses, including influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and the recently described human metapneumovirus (hMPV). We hypothesize that the availability of rapid, multiplex PCR diagnostics will provide better clinical care and new insights into the etiology and clinical spectrum of RTIs. We conducted a retrospective analysis of the incidence of respiratory pathogens at a 500-bed adult and 154-bed pediatric hospital tertiary care center. A total of 939 specimens from patients with an age range of 5 days to 91 years (median, 2 years) were tested by a multiplex respiratory pathogen PCR from November 14, 2011 to November 13, 2012. Sixty-five percent of specimens were positive for at least one pathogen. As the age of the patient increased, the positivity rate for the PCR decreased proportionately. Rhinoviruses/ enteroviruses (Rhino/Entero) were the most prevalent (34.3 %) followed by RSV (19.2 %) and hMPV (6.2 %). Twelve percent of the positive samples were positive for multiple analytes, with Rhino/Entero and RSV being the most common combination. The peak months were September and May for Rhino/Entero infections, January for RSV and February for coronavirus. hMPV peaked 2 months after RSV, as has been observed recently in other studies. Multiplex PCR provides rapid diagnostic information that can be used to make knowledgeable clinical decisions and potentially reduce the use of antibiotics. Active respiratory PCR surveillance could also predict seasonal respiratory epidemics to allow for adequate planning of additional infection control measures.",

Past epidemiologic studies used routine diagnostic methods such as culture for the detection of viral and bacterial respiratory pathogens [7, 38] . However, viral culture requires 3 to 5 days to detect most agents and detects rhinovirus or coronaviruses poorly or not at all. Multiplex reverse transcriptase PCR has been shown to be more sensitive than standard respiratory virus culture, bacterial culture, and antigen detection methods [5, 8, 18, 27] . Moreover, PCR is much faster. For the recently characterized hMPV, RT-PCR-based techniques are generally the method of choice for detection [35] . No antigen detection methods are commercially available for hMPV.",

As the age of the patient increased, the positivity rate for the PCR decreased proportionately. Other multiplex respiratory PCR studies have reported lower positivity rates for adults [9, 11] . Studies have shown that older adult patients shed lower titers of viruses, which demands the use of a highly sensitive methodology such as RT-PCR over conventional culture or DFA [36] . It is possible that the multiplex PCR assays now available may still not be sensitive enough to detect the lower titers of virus shed by older adult patients. It is also possible that adult patients may have other bacterial infections causing the respiratory infections that are not detected by the PCR, such as Legionella or Streptococcus pneumoniae. We noted a seasonal variation of the number of viral infections. Rhino/Entero was the most prevalent viral infection, with demonstrated peaks in the number of cases in May and September. The September peak appears to correspond to the start of school sessions. RSV was the second most prevalent virus, with a very large number of cases in January, followed two months later by an increased number of cases of hMPV.",

The multiplex respiratory PCR detects three bacterial pathogens that can all be treated with specific antibiotics, including C. pneumoniae, M. pneumoniae, and B. pertussis. Adamantanes and neuraminidase inhibitors are available for the influenza viruses. Intravenous polyclonal immune globulin enriched against RSV and palivzumab, a monoclonal antibody against the RSV fusion glycoprotein, have been recommended for high-risk infants. Ribavirin has been also been approved for use with RSV and has had some apparent success in cases of infection with hMPV, adenovirus and parainfluenza viruses. Most conventional immunoglobulin preparations seem to contain sufficient amounts of neutralizing titers against hMPV.",
