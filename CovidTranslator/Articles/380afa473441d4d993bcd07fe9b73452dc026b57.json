By and large, the mechanisms of action for viral and cellular helicases are not known. Moreover, in some cases, enzymatic activity is not even required for their roles in virus biology. Recently, we showed that expression of the host nucleolar helicase DDX56 is important for infectivity of West Nile virus (WNV) particles. In the present study, we demonstrate that the helicase activity of this enzyme is essential for its role in assembly of infectious WNV virions. Over-expression of the capsid-binding region of DDX56 also reduces infectivity of WNV suggesting that interaction of DDX56 and capsid protein is an important step in the virion assembly pathway. To our knowledge, this is the first study showing that enzymatic activity of a cellular helicase is critical for infectivity of flaviviruses.",

The stable HEK293T cell lines were transduced with lentiviruses encoding normal (RNAi-sensitive) or RNAi-resistant versions of myc-tagged WT and D166N and E167Q mutants.

To establish whether the helicase activity of DDX56 is important for this process, we assayed the relative amounts of genomic RNA in WNV particles secreted from cells expressing D166N and E167Q mutants. Loss of DDX56 helicase activity did not affect expression of WNV capsid protein (Fig. 4A ) nor its secretion from infected cells in the form of virus particles (Fig. 5A ). To determine if packaging of viral RNA was affected, total RNA was extracted from WNV particles and the relative amounts of genomic RNA (normalized to capsid protein) were determined by RT-PCR. Data in Fig. 5B show that virus particles isolated from infected cells expressing helicase dead mutants D166N and E167Q contained 3-4 times less genomic RNA than those isolated from non-silencing cells or cells expressing RNAi-resistant wild type DDX56. These data indicate that the enzymatic activity of DDX56 is important for packaging genomic RNA into WNV virions. Over-expression of the capsid-binding region of DDX56 reduces infectivity of WNV The data shown above together with results from our previous study (Xu et al., 2011) are consistent with a scenario in which interaction between WNV and catalytically active DDX56 plays an important role in assembly of infectious virions. If this is indeed the case, blocking interaction between capsid and DDX56 should also reduce the yield of infectious WNV. Our approach was to over-express the capsid-binding region of DDX56 in order to prevent interaction of endogenous DDX56 with capsid. To identify the region of DDX56 that binds to capsid, myc-tagged constructs encoding the N-and C-terminal regions of DDX56 were coexpressed with WNV capsid in transfected cells followed by coimmunoprecipitation and immunoblotting. Data in Fig. 6 show that in transfected or infected cells, the WNV capsid does not bind to the DEAD box helicase-containing region of DDX56 (DDX56-NT-myc), but rather, the C-terminal part of the protein, which was produced in cells expressing DDX56-CT-myc. This region of DDX56 also contains the targeting information that is required for localization to the nucleolus (Fig. 7) .",

However, expression of DDX56-CT-myc reduced viral titers approximately 50-fold compared to expression of full length DDX56-myc or NT-DDX56-myc (Fig. 8B ).

But the fact that significantly less viral RNA was detected in the virus particles is consistent with our hypothesis that capsid-DDX56 interactions are important for incorporation packaging viral genome.",

First, viruses almost invariably develop resistance to these types of drugs. This is particularly true of RNA viruses whose polymerases do not possess proof reading activity and are therefore by nature, error prone and mutable. Second, the choice of targets is very limited due to the small number of enzymes encoded by most viruses. In contrast, targeting host factors as means to control viral infection is a burgeoning area that has shown promise, particularly for flaviviruses. Replication and assembly of infectious flavivirus particles requires hundreds of host genes (Krishnan et al., 2008) . Accordingly, it may be possible to target a variety of host proteins, particularly enzymes, as a means to control viral infection. Although this approach may also have drawbacks, viral resistance to small molecules that block host enzymes should be minimal.",

Among the helicase superfamily, DEAD box proteins form the largest group of these enzymes. These helicases are thought to play multiple roles in RNA metabolism including mRNA splicing and transport, transcription, translation and remodeling of ribonucleoprotein complexes. In most cases, the physiological substrates of DEAD box helicases have not been defined but it is clear that a number of pathogenic RNA viruses require these enzymes for replication and/or assembly. For example, at least two cellular helicases, DDX1 and DDX3 function as cofactors that promote replication of HIV (Fang et al., 2004; Yedavalli et al., 2004) . DDX1 and DDX3 both appear to facilitate export of HIV RNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm through interaction with Rev. DDX1 also stimulates replication of coronavirus RNA (Xu et al., 2010) . However, because coronaviruses replicate in the cytoplasm, it would appear that the role DDX1 plays in replication of these large RNA viruses is distinct from its function as a cofactor for HIV.",

For example, we recently determined that the nucleolar helicase DDX56 is needed for a critical post-replication step in WNV morphogenesis (Xu et al., 2011) . DDX56 appears to function in assembly of pre-ribosomal particles, but it is not associated with mature ribosomes (Zirwes et al., 2000) . By analogy, it is tempting to speculate that DDX56 functions similarly in assembly of other large ribonucleoprotein particles such as viral nucleocapsids. The fact that DDX56 is not detected in mature WNV virions (Xu et al., 2011) is consistent with this scenario. A related study by another laboratory revealed that DDX24 performs a similar function during assembly of HIV virions (Ma et al., 2008) .",

Rather than using RNAi to down-regulate expression of DDX56 in cells, it would be advantageous to use small molecule inhibitors that target the enzymatic activity of this Fig. 7 . Nucleolar targeting information of DDX56 is contained in the C-terminal 329 amino acid residues. A549 cells were transfected with plasmids encoding myc-tagged wild type (WT) DDX56, DDX56-NT or DDX56-CT. Twenty-four hours post-transfection, cells were infected with WNV (MOI \u00bc 5) for 24 h and then fixed and processed for indirect immunofluorescence using mouse anti-myc, rabbit anti-nucleolin, and guinea pig anti-WNV capsid antibodies. Primary antibodies were detected using donkey anti-mouse Alexa546, donkey anti-rabbit Alexa647 and goat anti-guinea pig Alexa488 secondary antibodies. Arrowheads indicate colocalization between capsid, DDX56 constructs and the nucleolar resident protein nucleolin. Nuclei are stained with DAPI. Images were captured using a leica TCS SP5 confocal scanning microscope.",

While this may seem intuitive, the enzymatic function of a ''helicase'' is not always required for its role in virus biology. Indeed, among highly related viral helicases, the mode of action during virus assembly can vary greatly. For example, assembly of infectious Kunjin virus, a close relative of WNV, requires expression of the viral NS3 protein in cis (Liu et al., 2002) . In contrast, during assembly of yellow fever virus particles, the helicase activity of NS3 is not required for this process (Patkar and Kuhn, 2008) . Moreover, yellow fever virus NS3 can perform its virus assembly function when expressed in trans unlike Kunjin virus NS3 which must be expressed in cis.",

Moreover, because overexpression of the capsid-binding region of DDX56 has a similar effect as reducing expression of DDX56 or knocking out its helicase activity, we hypothesize that interaction between capsid and this host enzyme facilitate loading and/or organization of viral RNA during virus assembly. Through an unknown mechanism, WNV infection causes relocalization of DDX56 from the nucleolus to cytoplasmic structures that are enriched in capsid protein (Xu et al., 2011) . It is likely that these capsid-positive cytoplasmic elements are virus assembly sites on the endoplasmic reticulum. Next, it will be of interest to develop small molecule inhibitors that can be used to target the helicase activity of DDX56. These inhibitors would not be expected to block replication of WNV, but by reducing the infectivity of nascent virions, viral spread would be minimized thereby allowing the immune system to contain the infection.",
