There is overwhelming evidence that supports the importance of infection control in the delivery of safe and quality health care, where the continued improvement of quality of care and provision of safe working environments are considered fundamental within Australian health care establishments 2, 3 . Prevention of health-care associated infections (HCAI) is a priority for health establishments. Central to this is the development and implementation of effective infection control strategies for preventing the transmission of infections from person to person within health care establishments 2. Review of infection control standards and practice has arisen because of changing epidemiology of disease, widening of the scope of practice of health care providers, and increased occupational risks associated with provision of health care nationally and internationally 4 , There is now an identified need to review paramedic infection control guiaelines in response to the changing patient care practices in the pre-hospital setting and the emerging roles for paramedics 5, 6. The increasing influence of evidence-based infection control practice in nursing, medicine, dentistry, and other clinical disciplines has not been widely reported in paramedic practice.

Paramedics and other emergency service personnel are at high risk of occupational exposure because of the unpredictable nature of their work 6. IS. 29. It is not possible to predict which patients may have a communicable disease in the emergency care environment. Education of paramedics about the fundamental principles of infection control and their contribution to the prevention of infection is vital to allow the safe and efficient management of patients outside the hospital 29 . To engender improvement in knowledge and practice, implementation of a comprehensive education programme is required for all staff. This is backed up by McCulloch ' who argues that, for there to be improvement in infection control practice, all staff require education and must actively participate in the implementation of infection control poliCies. Ambulance infection control requires the development of education and practice standards that specifically focus on infection control in the prehospital paramedic context.",

Further research investigating the translation of knowledge into practice specific to this setting is required. Examination of the results of this study to determine if or how they are realised in practice is also warranted. The continual challenge for ambulance services and authorities is to address specific ever-increasing challenges in infection control, and to establish evidence-based practices that not only value-add to patient care, but protect both staff and patients from cross-infection.

The understanding of disease aetiology and modes of transmission are vital components in understanding disease epidemiology, and form two components of the concept widely recognised in infec tion control as the 'chain of infection'. This concept illustrates the manner in which infectious diseases remain endemic in populations and, from time to time, lead to epidemics and pandemics. Further, it underpins th e rati onale for the use of precautions taken for particular infections ' . In this study, participants were asked to identi fy the correct components of the 'chain of infection' from a possibility of five different answers in true/false format. Only 29 .3% of participan ts correctly identified the six correct componen ts of the chain, with 20.4% reporting that they did not know. This result suggests paramedics in this study have a poor knowledge of the basic mecha nism of infectious disease epidemiology that relates to crossinfectio n, McCulloch 1 argues that it is vital for HCWs to understand the process of infection so that they know how they can help prevent the transmission of infection.
