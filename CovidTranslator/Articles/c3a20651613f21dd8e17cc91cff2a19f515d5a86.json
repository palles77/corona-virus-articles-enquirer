            "text": "In recent decades, GL has emerged as a prominent targeting moiety capable of specific interaction with cells. It has been proved that there are specific binding sites of GL on the cellular membrane of in vitro rat hepatocytes [8]. More recently, Ismair et al. [9] have found that carriermediated transport system absorbed GL can participate into rat or human hepatocytes. Based on these researches, some new drug carriers, surface-modified with GL (such as liposomes, albumin nanoparticles and chitosan) were prepared and proved to be more efficient on hepatocytetargeted delivery compared with the conventional ones [10]. These results imply that GL may be used as a novel ligand for hepatocyte-specific delivery. The present work was to investigate graphene oxide (GO) decorated with glycyrrhizin (GL) which were conjugated via strong hydrogen-bonding interaction as a new hepatocytetargeted delivery vehicle. The hydrogen-bonding interaction, simplified as a non-covalent type of functionalization, enables high drug loading and subsequent controlled release of the drug. An effective loading of GL on GO as high as 5.19 mg/mg was obtained at initial GL concentration of 0.6 mg/mL. The release of GL on GO showed strong pH dependence and the extent of release at pH 5.5 and 7.4 is 58.4% and 17.6% over 30 h in vitro respectively. The results show that the GO-GL complex seems to be a very promising vehicle for loading of drugs under neutral conditions and releasing under acidic environment. Furthermore, GO-GL can be obtained under mild conditions without addition of any organic solvents and surfactants, which is very suitable for pharmaceutical applications as a promising hepatocyte-targeted delivery carrier. \u00df 2012 Acad\u00e9 mie des sciences.

A recent example of high capacity carrier is graphene which has been the major focus of recent research due to its outstanding low toxicity, large specific surface area, mechanical, electrical, thermal, and optical properties since its first discovery in 2004 [11] , leading to the potential applications in many different areas including drug delivery [12] . Compared with graphene, graphene oxide (GO) is a heavily oxygenated material which has hydroxyl and epoxide functional groups on its basal planes, carbonyl and carboxyl groups at the sheet edges. Due to its hydrophilicity, GO can be well dispersed in aqueous media. In addition, GO provides large specific surface area for the immobilization of various biomolecules, which makes it a promising material as a drug carrier substance.",

The oxidation peak potential of GL at \u00c00.096 V was observed.

The loading of GL on GO is 0.89 mg/mg at the GL concentration of 0.1 mg/mL. With the increase of the initial GL concentration, the loading capacity of GL increases linearly and reaches highest value, 5.19 mg/mg, at a GL concentration of 0.6 mg/mL. Such a value of loading is far beyond the commonly used drug carrier materials, such as liposomes [10a] , carbon nanohorns [16] , polymer vesicles [17] , and chitosan [10d], which are all below 1 mg/mg at saturated carrying concentration. The above results show that GO is indeed a promising candidate for drug carrier materials. The interaction between GO and GL comes from the strong hydrogen-bonding, furthermore, the overall structure of GL is catenarian which make the area of contact lower than deliveries with p-p staking interactions. Fig. 6B shows the loading of GL on GO at the initial GL concentration of 0.6 mg/mL at pH values of 4, 7 and 10, respectively. As expected, the GO shows distinctly different loading capacity toward GL at different pH values. The maximum loading of GL on GO is 1.62 mg/mg at pH 4, 5.19 mg/mg at pH 7, and 2.07 mg/mg at pH 10. The highest loading capacity is observed at the neutral condition, rather than acidic or alkaline conditions.",

Here, the release behavior of GL from GO is shown in Fig. 7 . GL releases slowly from GO and the release rate gradually declines after 6 h and about 17.6% of the total bound GL was released from the nanohybrid in the first 30 h under neutral conditions (pH 7.4). As discussed above, the hydrogen-bonding interaction between GL and GO is the strongest under neutral condition, resulting in an inefficient release. The release behavior under acidic and alkaline conditions indicates that 58.4% and 26.6% of the total bound GL was released from the nanohybrid after 30 h at pH 5.5 and 9.0 in the first 30 h, respectively, which is much higher than that under neutral conditions. pH 5.5 resembles intracellular lysosomes, endosomes or cancerous tissues condition [18] . In lower pH, the H + in solution would compete with the hydrogen-bond-forming groups and then weaken the hydrogen-bonding interaction interaction between GO and GL which resulting a higher release. Under alkaline condition, -COOH group both of GO and GL dissociates as -COO \u00c0 and the force of hydrogen bond between GO and GL decreases, so the GL releases more easily than in the case of neutral condition. The pHdependent drug release from GO could be exploited for drug delivery applications since the micro-environments of extra cellular tissues of tumors and intracellular lysosomes and endosomes are acidic, potentially facilitating active drug release from GO delivery vehicles [19] .",

The GO-GL is obtained under mild conditions without any organic solvents and surfactants, which is very suitable for pharmaceutical applications. A high loading of GL on GO and a pH-dependent release behavior is observed. The pHdependent loading and releasing was attributed to the hydrogen-bonding interactions between GO and GL. The results of loading and release experiments indicate that this system seems to be a very promising vehicle for loading of drugs under neutral conditions and releasing under acidic environment. This work can be considered as the first step for further study on the application of GO-GL as a promising carrier for possible drug delivery targeting the liver in vivo.",
