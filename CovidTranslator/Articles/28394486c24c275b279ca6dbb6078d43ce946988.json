Historically, however, collecting parasites or even some parasite stages (e.g., surface organisms or fecal stages) have not been part of this survey equation, and parasitic faunas got ignored. However, in recent decades parasites have achieved recognition as important and abundant components of ecosystems, and whole organism surveys now often make at least cursory attempts to determine the presence and identification of some of the parasites of a particular host plant or animal species. In this vein, fecal material is often collected from captured hosts and later examined for parasite transmission stages (cysts, eggs, oocysts) that allow biologists to make either superficial identifications (to parasite genus) from distinctive propagules or in many cases to identify new morphological forms (from oocysts) that can result in new species descriptions. In the former instances, parasite stages may be identified quite superficially (an amoeba, a ciliate, a sporozoan) or they may be more specifically characterized (a Toxocara egg, an eimerian, an Isospora sp., a Sarcocystis sporocyst, etc.). It is these species \"identifications\" that, under certain circumstances, can provide useful information, but only in a general way; the forms with these kinds of names are listed in this chapter because no full specific identifications were made.",

All the forms that we include in this chapter have lots of missing data that prevent them from having valid binomial designations. Remarks: Two neonatal male red panda littermates were submitted for necropsy. One animal was found dead with no prior signs of illness; the other had a brief history of labored breathing. Postmortem examination revealed disseminated protozoal infection. To characterize the causative agent, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), immunohistochemistry (IHC), polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and amplification, and nucleic acid sequencing were performed. IHC was negative for Toxoplasma gondii and Neospora caninum but was positive for Sarcocystis spp. TEM of cardiac muscle and lung revealed numerous intracellular apicomplexan protozoa within parasitophorous vacuoles (PV). PCR and nucleic acid sequencing of partial 18S rRNA and the internal transcribed spacer (ITS-1) region confirmed a Sarcocystis sp. that shared 99% sequence homology to S. neurona and S. dasypi. This was the first report of sarcocystosis in red pandas. Zoll et al. (2015) believed that their histopathological, immunohistochemical, molecular, and ultrastructural findings support vertical transmission resulting in fatal disseminated disease, but they did not assign a binomial name to the parasite of the red panda, so it must be considered a species inquirenda, at least for now.",

Nodules were 10-12 mm wide and located on the lateral surface of the right maxilla. One lump was excised and prepared for standard H & E histological examination. Frequently, trophozoites, meronts with mature merozoites, and micro-and macrogametocytes were all discovered in the same host cell. Mature meronts were 11-20 in fixed tissue, and merozoites appeared to be arranged radially from a nuclear remnant of the meront. Merozoites in tissues were 5.5-6 \u00d7 2.0, crescent-shaped with one end thicker and blunter than the other, and a thick basophilic N was near the center of each merozoite. There were 16-20, sometimes 30, merozoites per meront. Microgametocytes were spheroidal, 8.5-11.5 wide. Spheroidal macrogametocytes, 8-9 wide, were the most prevalent structures seen, and each had a pale N with a distinct, centrally-located karyosome. Levine and Ivens (1981) thought these meronts appeared to be more like Besnoitia than any other genus, but they were unaware at the time that Caryospora bigenetica from rattlesnakes could produce similar infections in some mammals (see Chapter 4).",

Four dogs that had never been fed meat each were fed 25 g of buffalo diaphragm, and all four dogs started shedding unsporulated oocysts on 9 (three dogs) or 10 DPI (one dog), and the infected dogs continued shedding oocysts daily for 15, 18, 23, and 25 days. Sporulation was completed in 8-16 hours at room temperature. Sporulated oocysts were L \u00d7 W (n = 25): 18.2 \u00d7 13.3 (17.5-24 \u00d7 16-19) , L/W ratio: 1.1 (1.0-1.3), and M, OR, PG: all absent. Sporocysts were L \u00d7 W (n = 25): 13.3 \u00d7 9.8 (11-16 \u00d7 9-11), L/W ratio: 1.4 (1.1-1.6), and SB, SSB, PSB: all absent, but with a large SR. Gill et al. (1978) said that these oocysts either were Hammondia or Isospora but neglected to assign their form to either. Levine and Ivens (1981, pp. 49-50) suggested this may be a Toxoplasma species, even though the sporulated oocysts are about the same size as those of C. burrowsi and C. ohioensis, but gave no reason to support calling it Toxoplasma sp.",

(1972) reported an unusual coccidium in the rectal contents of four pups slaughtered in India. It was similar to Cryptosporidium because of its asporous, tetrazoic oocysts, which they saw in fresh scrapings of the jejunum; however, it was intracellular in epithelial and subepithelial cells of the villi, rather than in the intracellular, but extracytoplasmic, location typical for Cryptosporidium species, so they decided to create a new genus for their organism. They measured their \"oocysts\" both extracellularly and intracellularly. Fresh \"oocysts\" were L \u00d7 W (n = 50): 14.8 \u00d7 9.1 (12-17 \u00d7 8.5-10.5), L/W ratio: 1.6 (1.2-1.8); the OR was a prominent mass of large-sized granules, and sausage-shaped SZ were 9.3 \u00d7 2.7 (9-10.5 \u00d7 2.6-3).

They said, \"though the dimensions given for the oocysts in V. vulpis Wetzel, 1938 (from common red fox) are well within the range encountered in our material, the oocysts in this species, according to Pell\u00e9rdy, could possibly be the freshly-shed sporocysts of some known or as yet unknown isosporan species.\" We are convinced that what Pande et al.

(1997) suggested that he was likely looking at a Sarcocystis species because oocysts and sporocysts were seen to develop in the gut tissue and we agree. This organism was placed in the genus Isospora by L\u00fche (1906) and 2 decades later, Wenyon (1926a) suggested there were two \"races\" of I. bigemina, a large and a small race. The larger race, which was excreted as sporocysts and sporulated oocysts was a Sarcocystis species, and the smaller race, excreted as unsporulated oocysts, is now known to be Hammondia heydorni, an obligatory heteroxenous parasite (Heydorn et al., 1975c; Lindsay et al., 1997) . Nukerbaeva and Svanbaev (1974, 1977) collected oocysts from domestic dogs, which they identified as I. bigemina. They tried to transmit their oocysts to one 40-day-old Arctic fox (V. lagopus), and two 1-year-old minks (N. vison), but none of these animals became infected. They were successful in transmitting their oocysts to a control dog, which shed oocysts in its feces on the 8th DPI.",

Their oocysts were spheroidal or slightly ovoidal, L \u00d7 W: 21.2 \u00d7 17.1-18.0, and had ellipsoidal sporocysts that were 16 \u00d7 11 (sic) (13-16 \u00d7 9-11); oocysts lacked a M, OR, and PG, and sporocysts lacked SB, SSB, PSB but were illustrated to have a granular SR. They said that sporocysts were found free in the intestine, which suggests they had seen a Sarcocystis sp., and that during transportation to Leningrad almost all of the oocysts' walls broke and disappeared, which would support this idea. Yakimoff and Lewkowitsch (1932) failed to transmit this form to the domestic dog with sporulated oocysts. Glebezdin (1978) surveyed wild mammals in southwestern Turkmenistan from 1974 to 1977; he reported finding, in C. aureus, ellipsoidal oocysts of I. theileri that measured L \u00d7 W: 23.0 \u00d7 17.5 (22-25 \u00d7 17-20) , L/W ratio: 1.3; sporocysts were L \u00d7 W: 11.6 \u00d7 9.1 (11-14 \u00d7 8-11).

(1989) found a single sarcocyst in the biceps femoris muscle of a dog in Alabama, USA. The sarcocyst was spheroidal to ovoidal and measured 52 \u00d7 47 with a wall thickness of \u223c2.3. Sarcocyst wall projections were barely visible with the LM, but under TEM they appeared as irregularly-spaced electrondense projections that were 1.5 \u00d7 0.9. Septa were visible in the sarcocyst and contained numerous, irregularly arranged bradyzoites, but no metrocytes were seen. The sarcocyst did not elicit an inflammatory response in the adjacent muscle tissue. Remarks: Dubey (1980a) fed 1 kg of tissues from bison, cattle, elk, goats, moose, and sheep to different Sarcocystis-free coyotes, and all 12 coyotes shed sporocysts of Sarcocystis in their feces with prepatent periods of 9-15 DPI. Dubey (1980a,b) said that sporocysts in coyote feces fed infected musculature of cattle, sheep, goats, and elk were all structurally similar and that this was the first report of the completion of the life cycle of Sarcocystis species in moose and bison. One other cross-transmission experiment indicated that one goat Sarcocystis species completed its life cycle in both the dog and coyote and that ovine Sarcocystis is not transmissible to goats. None of the Sarcocystis species were identified, thus all must remain species inquirendae. Remarks: Dubey et al. (1991a) examined a litter of eight dogs born to a primiparous 2-year-old Rottweiler in Maryland, USA. All of the pups had medical issues, but one (dog 1), at 7-weeksold, was listless and anorectic with mild anemia after surgery for entropion. It was killed 2 days later and specimens of liver and small intestine were examined histologically. Protozoan meronts were seen free in the cytoplasm of hepatocytes adjacent to necrotic foci; the parasites were without a PV, divided by merogony, and resembled Sarcocystis structurally and antigenically, as it reacted with Sarcocystis antiserum. It was uncertain how the pup became infected, but was noteworthy to find Sarcocystis in the visceral tissues of dogs. There was no way to know what species they saw so this must be considered as another species inquirenda.",

The main lung lesion was interstitial pneumonia characterized by infiltration of mononuclear cells and neutrophils in the alveolar wall and alveolar hemorrhage and necrosis due to numerous meronts in the vascular endothelium. Hepatic lesions included necrosis of hepatocytes, moderate perivascular infiltration of mononuclear cells, and the presence of meronts and merozoites in hepatocytes and Kupffer cells. Renal lesions showed necrosis of glomeruli associated with all developmental stages of meronts, and multifocal areas of necrosis were present. Mature meronts with merozoites were L \u00d7 W (n = 13): 14-20 \u00d7 10-20, contained 12-28 merozoites, and they are divided by endopolygeny. They were located in the host cell cytoplasm without a PV.

The minor difference in sarcocysts from the dog (vs. cat sarcocysts) were a thinner layer of ground substance associated with the cyst wall and slightly larger bradyzoites. The cyst wall of both the dog and cats had striations, septa for compartmentalization, and fairly large bradyzoites.",

They thought they were dealing with two Sarcocystis species, but without further infection and/or molecular studies, it is not possible to determine which-was-which. Therefore, these must remain species inquirendae until they can be differentiated and named. There are at least three Sarcocystis species that have been named from gazelles, but only from sarcocysts in their muscle tissues. All three, S. gazellae Balfour, 1913 , S. mongolica Matschoulsky, 1947 , and S. woodhousei Dogel, 1916 , are mentioned in Levine (1986 and in Dubey et al.

Gray, 1843) , Yak. Remarks: Wei et al. (1985) named two species of Sarcocystis from yaks, using LM, TEM, and SEM to distinguish between their sarcocysts, S. peophagi and S. poephagicanis. Wei et al. (1989) then examined 23 3-5-month-old fetuses taken from slaughtered yaks in Gan Su province, China and examined their tissues (heart, liver, kidney, mesenteric lymph nodes, femoral and diaphragm muscles, intestines) histologically for sarcocysts. They detected sarcocysts in 6/23 (26%) fetuses, three in diaphragm and three in myocardium and found meronts, but not clear merozoites. They did not name the species of Sarcocystis, even though they had named the only two known species in yaks (Wei et al., 1985) and did cross-transmission work with both species a year later (Wei et al., 1990) . This was not the first time that various stages of sarcocyst development were seen in fetal tissue; earlier, Munday and Black (1976) had reported Sarcocystis spp. in brain tissue of two aborted bovine fetuses, and Hong et al. (1982) found the vascular epithelium over all body parts contained immature and mature meronts of Sarcocystis in aborted bovine fetuses. These two studies, and their own work (Wei et al., 1985) , led them to conclude that at least some Sarcocystis species can be transmitted vertically from naturally-infected mothers to their fetuses. This is certainly an area that deserves further exploration.",

Park and Wildlife Sanctuary in Tamil Nadu and Tadoba National Park, in both areas chital is the most predominant ungulate species. They reported that chital is the intermediate host for Sarcocystis species in dhole. Dhole scats were sampled from 1998 to 2001, and 184/239 (77%) scats from Tadoba and 161/209 (77%) scats from Mudumalai were positive for sporocysts of a Sarcocystis species. Sporocysts measured L \u00d7 W: 16 \u00d7 10, L/W ratio: 1.6, and it was common for densities of 5,000-10,000, up to 26,000, sporocysts/g of feces. Skeletal and heart muscles of chital killed by dhole, or found dead due to other causes, were collected for histopathological examination, but Jog et al. (2003) never definitively stated the number of tissue samples of chital they examined for sarcocysts. They only said that sarcocysts were small, usually <1 mm long, they were not compartmentalized, and \"there was no distinct cyst wall\" (?). They also said the sarcocysts were found in large numbers in the heart (prevalence 50%) and skeletal muscles (19.5%) collected from Tadoba, whereas in samples collected from Mudumalai, the prevalences were 45% and 48%, respectively. Because neither chital nor dhole are available for experimentation in India, they were unable to demonstrate the life cycle directly; however, Jog et al. (2003) were convinced of the chital-dhole life cycle because of: (1) the consistent occurrence of sarcocysts in chital and sporocysts in dhole;",

Jog et al. (2005) used the same data from their 2003 paper to investigate ecological and coevolutionary aspects of this relationship. Importantly, with no more information than they provided in their 2003 paper, or addressing the guidelines for naming new species, they named the coccidian, Sarcocystis axicuonis. Results of their analyses indicated that sarcocyst density in heart muscles of dhole kills was greater than in chital that died of other causes, and density of sarcocysts in skeletal muscle did not differ between dhole kills and nondhole kills. Jog et al. (2005) further argued that, if Sarcocystis infection in chital does not alter the probability of death due to other causes, then the effect of infection increased the probability of death due to dhole predation. Large numbers of cysts in heart muscle may negatively affect chital stamina making infected chital more susceptible to pack predators (dhole), than stalkers (tigers and leopards), which reinforces the parasite-prey and parasite-host relationships in this system. Jog et al. (2005) argued that if dhole kill more infected than uninfected chital, they are \"benefited\" by the parasite but, is there a cost to dhole to effectively disseminate the parasite? Dhole scat with large numbers of sporocysts was not diarrheic or otherwise abnormal, which suggested to them that infection in dhole is not pathogenic but no quantitative assessment was conducted. They noted that parasites were overdispersed in the dhole pack (i.e., only a few pack members were passing large numbers of sporocysts at any time). From these observations, they made the interesting suggestion that if carrying the parasite negatively impacts hunting efficiency, then uninfected dhole may do most of the hunting, and if consistent, the \"cost\" would be negligible to the dhole pack. Maintaining this division of labor between infected and uninfected dhole would be maintained if infected dhole preferentially ate heart tissue with high densities of cysts, and uninfected dhole ate other tissues with no/low densities. Unfortunately, they noted there are no parasite-free dhole-chital populations to serve as a control to estimate actual costs of infection in the two hosts, thus precluding demonstration of cost-benefit analysis of Sarcocystis infection to dhole. If readers are interested, Jog and Watve (2005) further developed their theoretical examination and modeling of parasite-host coevolution and development of mutualistic interactions using the dhole-chital Sarcocystis model. Unfortunately, Jog et al. (2003 , 2005 never completed the basic process of properly naming the Sarcocystis they studied, so it must remain a species inquirenda. ",

Remarks: Galli-Valerio (1929a) found this form in V. vulgaris collected at 1,650 m, in the Val de Bagnes, Switzerland; oocysts were ovoidal, with one end \"barely flattened\" as a nearly invisible M, measured 17 \u00d7 14, with ovoidal sporocysts, each 6 \u00d7 4.5, and contained two SZ, \u223c4 \u00d7 2.4. A year later he found this species in another V. vulgaris collected on Fignards Mountain near Torgon, Switzerland (Galli-Valerio, 1930) . Watkins and Harvey (1942) reported this species in 11/52 (21%) silver fox cubs dying in England and reportedly found it in \u223c10% of the adults and perhaps 25% of the fox cubs from 15 fox farms in England. Svanbaev (1960) reported it in 4/18 (22%) silver foxes in the Alma Atinsk Oblast, Kazakhstan and said the oocysts sporulated in 3-4 days at 25\u00b0C in 2% K 2 Cr 2 O 7 solution. Golemansky and Ridzhakov (1975) said they found oocysts of this species in the feces of 15/146 (10%) foxes in Bulgaria. Combining descriptive features from these other authors, the sporulated oocysts are ovoidal; number of walls, 1 (?); wall characteristics: smooth, colorless, 0.8-1.5 thick; L \u00d7 W: 17 \u00d7 14 (16-26 \u00d7 12-24), L/W ratio: 1.2; M; barely visible or absent; OR, PG: both absent.

Frank (1978) said she found this species in V. vulpes trapped near Lake Neusiedl, Austria, on the border with Hungary. Nonetheless, no published description to date has provided either a line drawing or a photomicrograph of a sporulated oocyst. Thus, this form must be relegated as a species inquirenda.",

Oocysts were shed in large numbers during the first 1-5 days of patency, then in small numbers or intermittently thereafter; patency began \u223c13-14 DPI after foxes ingested moose meat. Hammondia oocysts were detected microscopically in 11/12 foxes that ingested moose flesh (their Table 2 , p. 1552), and samples from 7 foxes, 4 V. vulpes and 3 V. lagopus, were positive on agarose gels after PCR using Hammondia-specific primers. Moose previously were reported to be an intermediate host of H. heydorni infecting dogs (Dubey and Williams, 1980) , but this was the first report of moose as intermediate host of a Hammondia species infecting foxes. Citing recent molecular comparisons of Hammondia isolates from dogs and foxes, Dahlgren and Gjerde (2010b) suggested that the Hammondia oocysts they found in red and arctic foxes in Norway might be different from H. heydorni known from dogs.",

His description was less than marginal and he did not provide a line drawing or photomicrograph as a type. Nonetheless, Svanbaev and Rachmatullina (1971) said they found it in 6/85 (7%) common foxes (V. vulpes). The oocysts they studied were ovoidal (25-28 \u00d7 20-22) or spheroidal (25-28 wide), light gray, with a bilayered smooth wall, \u223c2 thick, and M, OR, and PG all absent. Sporocysts were ovoidal (14-17 \u00d7 11-14), without SB, SSB, and PSB. Golemansky and Ridzhakov (1975) measured oocysts that were 20-23 \u00d7 18-21. The measurements by Galli-Valerio (1931) suggest that many of the oocysts measured were end-on views resulting in the mean of the measurements to be erroneously more spheroidal. It is possible that this is Isospora ohioensis, Isospora neorivolta, or Isospora burrowsi, but the oocyst sizes are somewhat larger suggesting Isospora vulpis Galli-Valerio, 1931 may represent a separate species. The exception is Golemansky and Ridzhakov (1975) , who may indeed have seen a member of the Isospora ohioensis-complex. It is likely that Bledsoe (1976a,b) actually was working with I. (=C.) vulpis rather than I. (=C.) vulpina. However, Galli-Valerio (1931) stated that the oocysts had a micropyle and his measurements suggest subspheroidal rather than ellipsoidal oocysts. It is likely that he was in error on both accounts and that the description by Svanbaev and Rachmatullina (1971) is the most accurate. Unfortunately, however, no published description to date has provided either a line drawing or a photomicrograph of a sporulated oocyst. Thus, this form must be relegated to a species inquirenda.",

One of the four forms they found, \"mostly resembles Sarcocystis gracilis R\u00e1tz, 1909 from roe deer.\" We mention this form here because we know from recent work (Gjerde, 2012) that S. gracilis sarcocysts in roe deer muscle can be transmitted to both V. vulpes and V. lagopus, which then shed sporocysts in their feces 9 DPI with infected deer flesh. Obviously, this form must remain a species inquirenda because no other data were given to confirm its identification as S. gracilis in the dwarf zebu. Remarks: Odening (1998) mentioned this species as valid in his compilation of 189 Sarcocystis names and said it was similar to S. citellivulpes. However, the authors are cited only in a Russian reference book (Anon, 1984) that is unavailable to us. Odening (1998) gave such little detail in his citation, that we think it is best, at this time, to relegate this form to a species inquirenda. To our knowledge, there have been no other references to this species since 1984, other than by Odening (1998).",

            "text": "Definitive host: Unknown. Intermediate host: Vulpes vulpes (L., 1758) (syn. V. vulgaris Oken, 1816), Silver or Red Fox. Remarks: Odening (1998) , who listed this as a valid Sarcocystis species name, said that Pak et al. (1991) named it from sarcocysts found in the red fox, but specimens were not preserved so followup molecular examination of specimens cannot be done. Dubey et al. (2015a) listed the form by Pak (1991) from the red fox as Sarcocystis sp. Gjerde and Schulze (2014) suggested that because the specimen described is unrecognizable today, it should be considered a species inquirenda and its name should be a nomina dubia. We were not able to secure a copy of the original paper, so we must concur with the opinion of Gjerde and Schulze (2014). Intermediate host: Capra ibex L., 1758, Alpine Ibex. Remarks: Biocca et al. (1975) found sporocysts in the feces of \"some\" of 12 red foxes in the Gran Parasiso National Park (GPNP) in Italy; these sporocysts measured 13-15 \u00d7 8-10, with a large SR, but no SB. They also found an ibex with sarcocysts in its muscles. Levine and Ivens (1981) reported that Biocca et al. (1975) infected both the timber wolf and domestic dog by feeding them sarcocyst-infected esophageal, heart, diaphragm, intercostal, and abdominal muscles from the infected ibex. The prepatent period in the fox was 11 days, in the wolf it was 12 days, and in the domestic dog it was 20 days; the patent period in these hosts was 62, 67, and 66 days, respectively. They also tried, unsuccessfully, to infect a domestic cat, a lion, a ferret, and a kestrel (Falco tinnunculus) with sarcocysts from the ibex, but none of them passed sporocysts. However, there is no evidence or correlation that the sporocysts in the foxes were the same species as the sarcocysts in the ibex. Later, Cornaglia et al. (1998) described the ultrastructural morphology of the sarcocyst wall in the muscles from an ibex found dead in the same national park in Italy. They also took samples of the diaphragm from 52 ibexes of different age and sex, from the GPNP. The morphology of the cyst wall led to the identification of three types of sarcocysts in the ibex of the GPNP and a further type in one Hispanic ibex was also collected. Cornaglia et al. (1998) concluded, \"the morphology of the sarcocysts' walls was similar to the wall of the species described in the domestic ruminants from several authors.\" Only one Japanese red fox had sarcocysts in its muscles and no inflammatory host response was associated with the sarcocysts. Ultrastructurally, the sarcocyst wall was thin and showed minute undulations. Kubo et al. (2009) said that these sarcocysts were similar to sarcocysts they found in the Japanese raccoon dog (N. procyonoides viverrinus) and Japanese martens (M. m. melampus) during the same survey. This is the first published report of muscular sarcocystosis in Japanese carnivores. There was no attempt to identify this species so this form must remain a species inquirenda.",

Epithelial cells were markedly hyperplastic, hyperchromatic, and piled on each other with numerous mitotic figures. Inflammatory cells consisted predominantly of neutrophils (two ferrets) or lymphocytes and macrophages (two ferrets), and some eosinophils in all four. They described the coccidial organisms to consist predominantly of meronts and merozoite stages. Many coccidial stages were seen within the apical cytoplasm of hyperplastic epithelial cells, but feces were not examined and no attempt was made to identify the organism other than to call them coccidia. They mentioned that the mechanism by which Desulfovibrio sp. and its relatives induce proliferative bowel disease is unknown, but \"the presence of a second organism may in some instances be required for ICOs to cause intestinal lesions.\"",

Microscopic examinations of the intestinal tract of all ferrets showed numerous spheroidal to ovoidal bodies, in various stages of development, attached to the brush border of enterocytes and cryptal epithelial cells of the distal large intestine. Villous atrophy was severe and a cellular infiltrate composed of neutrophils, eosinophils, and macrophages was seen in the submucosa, whereas desquamated epithelial cells with parasitic stages were seen in the intestinal lumen.

They made stained fecal smears, and then took sections of both gastrointestinal (GI) tracts and stained paraffin-embedded sections with hematoxylin-eosin for the histopathology; they also fixed, cut, and stained the GI with uranyl acetate and lead citrate for TEM. Fecal smears showed Cryptosporidium oocysts that were \u223c3-5. Histological sections demonstrated cryptosporidial stages, 2-5 wide, associated with the brush border of the epithelial cells at the tips and lateral margins, but not in the crypts, only in the small intestine (predominantly ileum); no such stages were seen in the gall bladder, trachea, or lungs. Trophozoites, meronts, macrogametes, and oocysts were detected by TEM in the small intestine. Subsequently, examination of fresh fecal samples of the ferret population at the research facility, and of the new arrivals, revealed the presence of Cryptosporidium as a subclinical disease in a high percentage of ferrets. The infection persisted for several weeks both in immunocompetent and immunocompromised (treated with dexamethasone) animals. Fecal smears showed Cryptosporidium oocysts in 9/22 (41%) ferrets at the facility, and in 31/44 (70%) new arrivals.

They attempted to complete the sexual cycle by feeding muscle sarcocysts to the tawny owl, Strix aluco L., 1758 and obtained a few oocysts for a short time from its feces.

(1982) studied skinned muskrat (Ondatra zibethica) carcasses from Connecticut and New Jersey, USA and found coccidia-like zoites in their muscles using a pepsin digestion technique. They then fed seven pairs of coccidia-free mink half of an infected muskrat carcass each. Four pairs of mink fed muskrats shed unsporulated coccidian oocysts in their feces 6-8 DPI and patency lasted 4-6 days. Sporulated oocysts were L \u00d7 W (n = 80): 11.6 \u00d7 10.7 (11.5-12 \u00d7 10-11), L/W ratio: 1.1. They reported that the oocysts had a M, but we did not see one in a photomicrograph presented (their Fig. 4) , and the oocysts lacked a PG and OR. Sporocysts were L \u00d7 W (n = 160): 8.8 \u00d7 6.5 (8-9 \u00d7 6-7), L/W ratio: 1.4 and had a granular SR, but lacked SB and SSB. They also fed another seven pairs of coccidia-free mink \u223c200,000 sporulated oocysts each that were derived from the previous four pairs that shed the oocysts, but none of the second seven pairs shed oocysts during the course of the experiment. After 30 DPI, all 14 pairs of mink (those fed tissue cysts and those fed only oocysts) were killed and sections of gastrointestinal tract, pancreas, ileocecal lymph node, liver, kidney, lung, heart, brain, diaphragm, tongue, esophagus, and masseter muscles were examined for coccidian cysts and skeletal muscles were examined via pepsin digestion. All were negative. The authors concluded that their work was insufficient to establish whether this Hammondia-like parasite was identical to an already known species or was a new species. This interesting study certainly deserves more attention, especially now that we have molecular tools with which to work.",

(2016) found 16/139 (11.5%) sea lions, stranded in California, USA in 2010 and 2012, shedding oocysts in their feces. In 2011-12, they collected more fecal samples at sea lion haul-out sites at three locations in central California and 13/212 (6%) had oocysts present. Amplified ITS-1 from the samples strongly supported the presence of Coccidia A and B of Colegrove et al. (2011) . One sample produced a novel sequence that had 97%-98% pairwise similarity to previously published coccidian DNA isolates in Guadalupe fur seal tissues (Gibson et al., 2011) . Coccidia A and B were sporulated and inoculated into mice to investigate infectivity and pathogenicity, but no remarkable clinical signs or histologic changes were observed except \u223c40% of the mice had slight nephritis, pneumonia, and inflammation in lung, spleen, and lymph nodes. Brain, heart, and tongue all tested negative using pan-coccidian primers that included the ITS-1 region. Results of phylogenetic analyses using ITS-1 indicated the Coccidia A, B, C, CSL A\u00f1o 11, and isolates from harbor seals and Guadalupe fur seals all shared a common ancestor with N. caninum. Girard et al. (2016) concluded that additional genetic and morphologic studies are required to resolve the taxonomy of these novel marine mammal coccidia, and they believe it is likely these organisms are either a new Neospora species or a new genus in the Sarcocystidae. Girard et al. (2016) also inoculated excysted SZ of Coccidia A and B into tissue flasks of Green Monkey-derived MA104 cells. At 14, 21, and 35 DPI, 3/4 (75%) cultures had intra-and extracellular propagating organisms morphologically similar to Sarcocystis spp. Extracellular zoites were 8-11 \u00d7 1-2. As the cultures aged, the number of zoites increased suggesting they were merozoites produced via merogony, and they described active zoites to exhibit movement typical of S. neurona. Antigen slides, prepared from zoites, tested positive to S. neurona antisera from a horse and a sea lion by IFAT. PCR amplification of zoite DNA confirmed that zoites were similar to S. neurona, which allowed Girard et al. (2016) to conclude that in addition to the observed Coccidia A and B, a S. neurona-like organism is excreted by sea lions in low concentrations and sea lions are mechanical vectors. ",

This animal died after 3 days of exhibiting lethargy and anorexia. Tissues were fixed and preserved for both LM and TEM and later stained with anti-T. gondii, anti-N. caninum, and anti-S. cruzi serum; parasite stages in the liver reacted only with the anti-Sarcocystis serum. Sections of infected liver demonstrated coagulative and lytic necrosis with associated nuclear pyknosis, karyorrhexis, and hepatocyte loss in areas adjacent to parasite stages. Sarcocysts in myocytes, however, were unassociated with inflammation. Parasites in the liver divided by endopolygeny and both meronts and merozoites were seen there. Meronts were up to 32 long and contained 6-35 merozoites, each \u223c5 \u00d7 1. Their TEM sections demonstrated the meronts to be located free in the hepatocyte cytoplasm, without a PV, and merozoites contained numerous micronemes, a conoid, but no rhoptries. The parasite they identified as a Sarcocystis species, likely was S. neurona, but there is no way to state that unequivocally, so their form must be relegated to a species inquirenda.",

Sporocysts were ellipsoidal or had one side flattened, L \u00d7 W (n = 17): 13.0 \u00d7 9.3 (11-13 \u00d7 8-10), with a smooth wall; SB, SSB, PSB: all absent; SR: present, and SZ were \"elongate\" lying lengthwise in SP.

One juvenile female was unsteady on its feet, had difficulty with balance, and its head was constantly turned to the left. Seven days after arrival, it was anorectic, had mucopurulent nasal and serous ocular discharge, and was moribund. On necropsy they observed the carcass was dehydrated, mucous membranes were pale, and lungs were consolidated. Numerous developmental stages of a Sarcocystis species were found in the cytoplasm of macrophages, neurons, and multinucleated giant cells. In mature meronts, merozoites were arranged in a rosette around a residual body; individual merozoites measured 4-5 \u00d7 1 and were seen in mononuclear cells located within meningeal blood vessels. Organisms were located in host cell cytoplasm without a PV, and merozoites had no rhoptries. Moderate numbers of sarcocysts were found in striated muscles of the heart, tongue, diaphragm, esophagus, masseter, and extraorbital muscles. In all likelihood, this species is S. neurona but must be considered a species inquirenda at this time.",

(1992) reported an adult male raccoon with protozoal encephalitis associated with a Sarcocystis-like organism and concurrently infected with canine distemper. The Sarcocystis species was intracellular in the cytoplasm, without a PV. Histologically, sarcocysts were present in skeletal muscle and occasionally in the heart; these cysts were 19 \u00d7 25 to 40 \u00d7 506 and had striated walls that were 1.5-2.0 thick. Individual merozoites were 2.0 \u00d7 1.5. A second raccoon had numerous Sarcocystis-type oocysts in the lamina propria of its small intestine. It is possible that the form in the first raccoon was S. neurona because of its intracellular location without a PV, with the raccoon serving as an intermediate host; similarly, the isosporoid oocysts in the gut of the second raccoon may represent another species of Sarcocystis, with the raccoon serving as the definitive host. Both forms can only be considered species inquirendae at this time. No clinical signs were observed in the pandas at the time of feces collections. One 18-year-old panda was positive for Cryptosporidium oocysts that were L \u00d7 W (n = 50): 4.6 \u00d7 4.0 (4-6 \u00d7 3-5). Using the sequences of 18S rRNA, HSP70, COWP, and actin genes, Liu et al. (2013) discovered that this parasite represented a new genotype of Cryptosporidium, which was most closely related to the Cryptosporidium bear genotype, and they designated this new genotype, Cryptosporidium giant panda genotype, but did not give it a binomial.",

The animals were imported from north of the former USSR, which likely is the natural habitat for both the host and these oocysts. Oocysts sporulated in 4 days in 2% K 2 Cr 2 O 7 solution at 24\u00b0C. The oocysts had two forms, with a wall \u223c1.5 thick. Spheroidal oocysts were 24.6 (19-32), whereas ovoidal oocysts were L \u00d7 W: 26.4 \u00d7 24.0 (23-33 \u00d7 21-29), L/W ratio: 1.1; M: absent; OR: present (line drawing); PG: present. Ovoidal to piriform sporocysts were L \u00d7 W: 16.9 \u00d7 11.6 (15-19 \u00d7 11-13), L/W ratio, 1.5; SB, SSB: both present; PSB: absent; SR: present; SR characteristics: a clump of granules or granules spread among SZ; SZ: crescent-shaped. Yakimoff and Matschoulsky (1935) thought this was not a parasite of bears, but may be a bird isosporan because its morphological features were similar to sporulated oocysts described as Isospora lacazei (Labb\u00e9, 1893) . Its occurrence in this bear's feces may be explained by the fact that bears lick their paws contaminated by the soil where the sparrows defecate. No one knows for sure.",

(1998b) were able to examine diaphragm, abdominal muscles, and carcass muscles from 92 hunter-killed bears in North Carolina, USA. They found two sarcocysts in cross-sections of muscle from one bear (1%). The sarcocysts were 45 \u00d7 37.5 and 67.5 \u00d7 50. Under TEM they saw that the bradyzoites butted against the ground substance of the cyst wall; five longitudinally-cut bradyzoites were 6.0-6.6 \u00d7 2.5-3.3 and contained organelles typically found in Sarcocystis bradyzoites. Dubey et al. (1998b) reiterated a previous (perhaps questionable) argument that the structure of the sarcocyst wall is a reliable taxonomic criterion to distinguish Sarcocystis species within a given host. They concluded their reasoning as to why they did not call this the same species as the one seen by Zeman et al. (1993) , below, by saying, \"A Sarcocystis-like parasite has been reported as causing fatal hepatitis in a black bear from South Dakota (Zeman et al., 1993) and in two polar bears from Alaska (Garner et al., 1997) . Only schizonts and merozoites were found in bears that died of hepatitis; sarcocysts were not seen.\" Thus, the observational data between this report and those of Zeman et al.

(1993) reported a case of fatal sarcocystosis in an American black bear from a wild-animal park, Black Hills, South Dakota, USA; initially, they found different developmental stages of a protozoan parasite in the cytoplasm of several hepatocytes. There was no inflammation associated with parasitized hepatocytes, but they saw both inflammation and necrosis associated with maturation and rupture of mature meronts. Zeman et al. (1993) reported that mature meronts occupied 50%-80% of hepatocyte cytoplasm and moved the HCN to the periphery of the cell. They also noted that the meronts divided by endopolygeny, characteristic of Sarcocystis species. Mature meronts were 30 \u00d7 20 and contained up to 36 merozoites. When liver tissue sections were deparaffinized, they reacted with antiserum to T. gondii, N. caninum, and S. cruzi, but the parasite tissue only reacted with S. cruzi, not with T. gondii or N. caninum antisera. Zeman et al. (1993) compared the hepatic lesions seen in the bear to those reported from a sea lion (Mense et al., 1992) and said these lesions also were identical to those described in a 2-day-old dog with congenital sarcocystosis (Dubey et al., 1992a) . The canine parasite was morphologically and antigenically identical to Sarcocystis canis, but unlike in the bear, the S. canis infection was found in many of the dog's tissues including skin, brain, liver, and lungs.

Samples were examined by five diagnostic tests to evaluate and compare their sensitivity: (1) a modified Ziehl-Neelsen acid-fast staining technique (mZN); (2) direct immunofluorescence (DIC) by a commercial kit (Merifluor Cryptosporidium/Giardia direct immunofluorescent kit) that used a monoclonal antibody against antigen of C. parvum; (3) enzyme immunoassay-1 (EIA-1) that used a monoclonal antibody (Premier Cryptosporidium EIA); (4) EIA-2 that used a polyclonal antibody (ProSpecT Cryptosporidium microplate assay) and (5) EIA-3 that used a polyclonal antibody (ProSpecT Cryptosporidium rapid assay) to detect Cryptosporidium antigen in feces. EIA-3. Marks et al. (2004) suggested higher sensitivity of mZN over DIC due to the preparation procedure in the manufacturer's guidelines (loss of oocysts during the rinsing procedure), and because oocyst fluorescence intensity was variable. A markedly low sensitivity of EIA-3 was likely caused by its high detection limit compared with that of EIA-1 and EIA-2. To summarize: EIA-2 and EIA-1 had the highest sensitivities when only a single fecal sample was examined, and mZN and EIA-1 had similar sensitivities when two consecutive samples were examined.",

(1988) reported numerous cysts in a 1.5-year-old cat from College Station, Texas, USA. Sarcocysts were found in muscles of the heart, forelimbs, hind limbs, diaphragm, eyes, and intercostal spaces. Sarcocysts were (n = 50): 48 (30-60) wide \u00d7 1.5-2.2 long, had a thick wall, and septa subdivided the cyst into compartments, all with banana-shaped bradyzoites that were 7-10 long. TEM showed the primary cyst wall differed slightly from those of sarcocysts found in cats by Kirkpatrick et al. (1986) , and now thought to be identical with S. felis (Dubey et al., 1992b) . Primary cyst walls seen by Edwards et al. (1988) had a Pvm with regularly-spaced, villus projections, which were round in cross-section and all about 1 long, whereas the villus projections of Kirkpatrick et al. (1986) and Dubey et al. (1992b) had shorter, irregularly-spaced projections. This led Edwards et al. (1988) to conclude that the form they saw may be a different species. No inflammatory response was associated with the sarcocysts in any of the muscles examined. This form must also be relegated to a species inquirenda.",

Sporocysts shed by the cat were L \u00d7 W: 13 \u00d7 9 (11-16 \u00d7 8-12), L/W ratio, 1.4; the prepatent period in cats was 20 days and patency lasted 44-48 days. Janitschke et al. (1976) thought they were dealing with two Sarcocystis species, but without further infection and/or molecular studies, it is not possible to tell which one was which. Therefore, these must remain species inquirendae until they can be differentiated and named. There are at least three Sarcocystis species that have been named from gazelles, but only from sarcocysts in their muscle tissues. All three, S. gazellae Balfour, 1913 , S. mongolica Matschoulsky, 1947a ,b, and S. woodhousei Dogel, 1916 , are mentioned in Levine (1986 ) and in Dubey et al.

However, the oocysts they measured were 26-33 \u00d7 22-27, with sporocysts only 13 in mean length. They indicated the oocysts were partially sporulated when passed by their hosts. However, both the oocysts, and especially the sporocysts, are too small to be those of I. felis (now C. felis) and they are larger than those of I. rivolta (now C. rivolta).

They collected 33 freshly deposited fecal samples from wild lions, preserved them in 10% formalin, and examined both direct smears and fecal flotations for transmission stages. They said they found the following apicomplexans: Eimeria sp. in 1 lion, Isospora felis in 16, I. rivolta in 2, Isospora sp. in 1, Sarcocystis sp. in 15, and Toxoplasma-like oocysts in 4 samples. Unfortunately, they made these spurious identifications by measuring only one or a few oocysts, and all oocysts (except the oocysts/sporocysts of Sarcocystis) were unsporulated, which, of course, makes their identifications to genus completely unreliable, if not impossible.",

Endogenous stages did not stain with antibodies to T. gondii and/or N. caninum and the morphology and size of various tissue stages eliminated I. (syn. C.) felis and I. (syn. C.) rivolta as suspects. Stages also differed from those of H. hammondi, and H. hammondi is not known to be transmitted transplacentally, nor are felids suspected to be definitive hosts of N. caninum. The age of the cub and the advanced development of the parasite supported the assumption that it was acquired in utero but no identification was/could be made.

It is still worthwhile and useful to study the oocysts of Eimeria, Isospora, Caryospora, and Cystoisospora species, but they must be carefully defined by measurements, photomicrographs, and line drawings. Sporocysts of Isospora species must be examined carefully to determine the presence or absence of a Stieda body. If a Stieda body is present, crosstransmission and feeding experiments will be needed to determine if sporulated oocysts can infect the host species in which they were discovered, or their nearest relatives, or the original oocysts may belong to a prey item and simply be passing through the gut of the original host from environmental contamination. If the sporocysts of larger isosporan-like oocysts do not have a Stieda body, it is most likely they are a species of Cystoisospora and lab mice should be infected to determine if they can act as intermediate/transport hosts for some asexual stage(s).",

To illustrate the point we are making, Mohammed (2000) and Mohammed et al. (2000) looked for Sarcocystis infections in different gazelle species at the King Khalid Wildlife Research Centre in Saudi Arabia. They detected no macroscopic sarcocysts by fibre optic examination, a 40% infection rate was detected by histological examination, and an overall prevalence of infection of 67% was reached when they used pepsin digestion of muscle. In addition, the esophagus, diaphragm, heart, tongue, and skeletal muscles had different rates of infection dependent on the host gazelle species that was examined. They also reported that Sarcocystis infection was significantly higher in free-ranging gazelles kept in a main enclosure than in gazelles kept in breeding pens and higher in adult versus juvenile gazelles. Thus, there are lots of ways to examine every problem and, with the plethora of inquiries presented in this chapter, there are lots of problems awaiting future study.",

Although the species from the bobcat remains a species inquirenda, the interesting observation was that during excystation, the walls of the sporocyst collapsed, apparently along predetermined lines, allowing sporozoites to escape.

She did state that its oocysts were identical to those of I. felis, but that they had a M, which those of I. felis lack. Based on that difference, Levine and Ivens (1981) named the form partially described by Triffitt (1927) as I. lyncis because she also gave some mensural data. Triffitt (1927) said the oocysts were ovoidal, 40-47 \u00d7 28-37, and had an oocyst wall with 3-layers, \u223c0.75 thick, and a M, \u223c4-5 wide; ovoidal SP were 20-33 \u00d7 14-18, with a SR, and SZ measured 15 long, with a large RB at their more rounded end and a smaller one at their more pointed end. Triffitt (1927) said that sporulation was completed in 7-9 days at room temperature. However, neither Triffitt (1927) nor Levine and Ivens (1981) provided a line drawing or a photomicrograph.

All samples were collected in 10% formalin, and they (2016) could not identify to which of the three endemic civets each fecal sample belonged. Samples thought to be infected with a Cyclospora sp. were found in two forest fragments, those infected with Eimeria species were found in four forest fragments and those identified only as Coccidia species were found in seven forest fragments. It is not clear how they defined \"Coccidia\" species nor how they were able to distinguish oocysts of Cyclospora and Eimeria species, given that feces were collected in 10% formalin and, apparently, not placed into thin layers in Petri dishes to allow sporulation.",
