The beneficial effects of dispositional optimism often vary according to cultural dynamics. Thus, assessing optimism-pain relationships across different ethnic groups is warranted. This study sought to examine the association between optimism and conditioned pain modulation (CPM), and test whether this association differs according to ethnicity. Optimism and CPM were assessed in a sample of healthy, ethnically diverse young adults. CPM was determined by comparing pressure pain thresholds obtained before and during exposure to a cold pressor task. All participants completed a validated measure of dispositional optimism. Greater reported optimism was significantly associated with enhanced CPM, and the strength of this association did not vary according to individuals' ethnic background. These findings suggest that an optimistic disposition may potentiate endogenous pain inhibition.",

            "text": "Over recent decades, psychological and socio-cultural variables have garnered increasing prominence in biopsychosocial models addressing mechanisms of pain perception (Gatchel et al., 2007; Turk, 1996) . Research to date has identified a number of important psychosocial variables (e.g., pain catastrophizing, gender, and culture/ethnicity) that appear to significantly impact the pain experience (Blyth et al., 2001; Pincus et al., 2002; Turk & Okifuji, 2001) . However, the current literature is saturated with studies focused on identifying psychosocial risk factors for negative pain-related outcomes. Conversely, much less is known about positive psychosocial constructs (e.g., optimism, hopefulness, happiness) in relation to pain experience. One particular construct, dispositional optimism, has been shown to possess widespread health promoting effects (Allison et al., 2003; Byrnes et al., 1998; Raikkonen et al., 1999; Scheier et al., 1999) and accordingly, there has been growing speculation that dispositional optimism could influence the course and experience of pain. Recently, the associations of optimism with various pain outcomes have been addressed (Geers et al., 2010; Geers et al., 2008; Morton et al., 2009) . In a laboratory setting using experimental pain testing, Geers and colleagues demonstrated that greater dispositional optimism was not only associated with decreased pain sensitivity, distress, and cardiovascular reactivity (Geers et al., 2008) , but also enhanced placebo analgesia (Geers et al., 2010; Morton et al., 2009) . These findings lend support to the beneficial contributions of optimism to the pain experience, yet the mechanisms underlying how optimism might relate to pain remain unknown.",

The positive outcome expectancies and adaptive coping strategies that characterize an optimistic disposition (Scheier & Carver, 1985; Scheier et al., 1986 ) may diminish pain experiences by enhancing the efficacy of endogenous pain-inhibitory pathways. However, no study to date has tested the relationship between optimism and endogenous pain-inhibitory function. Indirect support for this hypothesis comes from a previous and separate study whereby catastrophizing, a maladaptive pain coping strategy with pessimistic features, was shown to be associated with diminished efficacy of endogenous pain-inhibitory processes . Conversely, the opposite also seems plausible, that optimism may be associated with enhanced endogenous-pain inhibitory processes. Underscoring this possibility, a recent fMRI study revealed that greater dispositional optimism and induced optimistic bias were positively correlated with brain activity in cortical regions involved in endogenous pain-inhibitory networks (Sharot et al., 2007) . On balance, it is reasonable that enhancements in descending pain-inhibitory systems important in pain processing (Millan, 2002) may underlie some of the beneficial effects of optimism on pain outcomes.",

One method for assessing CPM, a measure of descending pain inhibition, is the use of a heterotopic pain conditioning paradigm (Price & McHaffie, 1988) , such that the pain produced by a painful test-stimulus is inhibited by the pain produced from the application of a second painful conditioning stimulus. Using this approach, CPM is assessed by measuring responses to a phasic pain stimulus before and during application of a tonic pain stimulus applied to a distant body site. The magnitude of CPM is calculated as the decrease in phasic pain observed during concurrent administration of the tonic conditioning stimulus. Studies that have examined the relationship between attention and CPM on pain outcomes have shown that the \"pain inhibiting pain\" phenomenon attributable to CPM is not dependent upon distraction (Lautenbacher et al., 2007; Moont et al., 2010) . The analgesic effect of CPM in humans is thought to be produced by supraspinally-generated inhibition of wide dynamic range (Cadden, 1993) and nociceptive-specific (Hu, 1990) neurons. The clinical relevance of experimental pain procedures involving CPM has been previously demonstrated (Edwards et al., 2003; Yarnitsky, 2010) .",

            "text": "When examining the relationship between dispositional optimism and endogenous pain inhibition (i.e. CPM), individuals' ethnic background should be considered. Considerable evidence now suggests that the experience of both clinical and experimental pain differs among ethnic groups (Edwards et al., 2001 for review). More specifically, in a series of laboratory-based studies conducted by Campbell and colleagues, African Americans were shown to be more pain sensitive to multiple modalities of experimental noxious stimulation (e.g., heat, cold, ischemic pain) (Campbell et al., 2005) , possess lower thresholds for eliciting the nociceptive flexion reflex (Campbell et al., 2008A) , and produce less robust CPM compared to their non-Hispanic white counterparts (Campbell et al., 2008B) . Whether CPM differs across ethnic groups other than non-Hispanic whites and African Americans remains to be determined. Ethnicity and culture have also been discussed as potential variables influencing levels of dispositional optimism (Lee & Seligman, 1997; Lai & Yue, 2000) . However, evidence thus far is mixed with some studies finding ethnic and cultural differences in levels of optimism (Chang, 1996; Chang et al., 2010) , while others have not (Ji et al., 2004) . When ethnic and cultural differences in optimism emerged (Chang, 1996; Chang et al., 2010) , it was generally the case that non-Hispanic whites reported greater levels of optimism compared to indigenous Asian and Asian Americans. At this time, relatively little research has examined differences in optimism between non-Hispanic whites and African Americans. Taken together, there appears to be sufficient evidence to suggest that the association of dispositional optimism with CPM may differ as a function of individuals' ethnic identity.",

Using laboratory pain testing procedures in healthy young adults, we examined the following questions: (1) Are there significant ethnic differences in dispositional optimism and CPM? (2) Is dispositional optimism positively associated with CPM? (3) Does the strength of the relationship between dispositional optimism and CPM meaningfully differ according to individuals' selfidentified ethnic affiliation (i.e., effect moderation)? For study question (2), participants' ethnicity, along with sex, depressive ratings and pain catastrophizing, was included as a statistical control to examine the unique relationship between dispositional optimism and CPM. The rationale for inclusion of these statistical controls is as follows: (A) significant sex and ethnic differences have previously been reported for dispositional optimism (Chang, 1996; Giltay et al., 2004) and CPM (Campbell et al., 2008B) . (B) Both depressive symptoms and pain catastrophizing have previously been shown to be associated with disruption of the CPM response (de Souza et al., 2009; Goodin et al., 2009 ). Therefore, not statistically controlling for these variables could potentially overshadow any unique association of dispositional optimism with CPM.",

Following baseline PPT determination (test stimulus), participants underwent a series of four cold pressor tasks (CPT; conditioning stimulus) that consisted of immersing the right hand, up to the wrist, for one minute in a circulating water bath (Neslab, RTE-111, Portsmouth, NH) maintained at 4\u00b0C. Participants were told they could remove their hand from the water at any time; however, they were also provided the following instruction, \"please keep your hand immersed in the water bath for the entire minute or we may not be able to use your data\". None of the participants pre-maturely removed their hand from the water bath prior to the allotted one minute for any of the four cold water immersions. Twenty seconds after cold pressor immersion, the algometer was used to deliver noxious mechanical stimulation to either the left dorsal forearm (two trials) or the left trapezius (two trials); the site order was randomized. Participants again indicated when the increasing pressure stimulation first became painful. Each participant completed four CPM trials, with a two-minute rest period between each trial. CPM calculation-A total of 10 PPT tests were completed (5 forearm, 5 trapezius). For each anatomic location, PPT was assessed three times during baseline testing and twice more during concurrent exposure to the CPT. Intra-class coefficients (ICC) were calculated for PPT at baseline and during cold water immersion for each anatomic location. This was done to determine the reliability of the algometer across multiple PPT tests. ICCs of .75 or above are generally considered as excellent (Streiner, 1995) . The ICCs for all PPT tests were .80 or above in the current study. Given this excellent reliability, repeated PPT measurements were averaged within each of the two anatomic locations for baseline and CPT trials. CPM was calculated using delta change scores, whereby baseline PPTs were subtracted from the cold water immersion-associated thresholds. CPM was computed separately for the forearm and trapezius.",

The BDI has well-established psychometric properties (Beck et al., 1988) and the internal consistency of the BDI in study 1 was good (\u03b1 = 0.81).",

A multiple regression analysis was completed to examine the unique association of dispositional optimism with CPM controlling for appropriate covariates. Further, a hierarchical multiple regression analysis was performed to examine whether the relationship between dispositional optimism and CPM was significantly moderated by individuals' ethnic background. Per the recommendations of Aiken and West (1991) for conducting tests of moderation with a multinomial variable (ethnicity), optimism scores were centered by subtracting the mean from each value, and a cross-product interaction term was created by multiplying centered optimism with a series of dummy-coded (0/1) ethnicity variables. Ethnicity was dummy-coded such that the Caucasian American cohort was the referent group for comparison. In an adjusted analysis, control variables were entered into the model (Step 1) before entering the optimism and dummy-coded ethnicity main effects (Step 2) followed by the interaction terms (Step 3).",

Contrary to previous reports, the current study did not reveal significant ethnic differences in dispositional optimism or CPM (Aim 1). These findings suggest that in the current sample of healthy college students, Caucasian Americans, Asian Americans, and African Americans possessed seemingly comparable positive expectations for the future and pain inhibitory capabilities. Consistent with recent studies that have demonstrated associations between dispositional optimism and other painrelated outcomes (Geer et al., 2010; Geers et al., 2008; Morton et al., 2009; Costello et al., 2002) , optimism was significantly and positively related with CPM in this study (Aim 2). It should be noted that the unadjusted analysis (i.e., Pearson correlation) did not reveal a significant relationship between dispositional optimism and CPM. It was not until this relationship was adjusted for participants' sex, ethnicity, depressive symptoms, and pain catastrophizing (i.e., multiple regression) that it became significant. It appears that statistical adjustment for the confounding effects of these other study variables helped to provide an undistorted estimate of the relationship between dispositional optimism and CPM (MacKinnon et al., 2000) , which became stronger relative to the unadjusted analysis. To our knowledge, this study is the first to suggest that greater dispositional optimism may be related with enhanced endogenous pain modulation, particularly paradigms related to CPM. Of particular interest is that the optimism-CPM relationship found in the present study did not significantly vary as a function of ethnic background (i.e., no effect moderation; Aim 3), which suggests that this relationship is potentially of similar magnitude across a wide range of people.",

From this hypothesis, two questions arise: 1) what exactly is dispositional optimism and, 2) what might be the mechanisms linking dispositional optimism to CPM and pain severity? The construct of dispositional optimism, or generalized outcome expectancies, was defined by Scheier and Carver (1985) on the basis of their broader behavioral self-regulation model (Carver & Scheier, 1981) . Accordingly, individuals high in optimism are people who expect positive outcomes. As a consequence, they anticipate being able to cope effectively with everyday threats and challenge. Conversely, less optimistic individuals (i.e., pessimists) are people who expect negative outcomes and do not anticipate being able to cope successfully (Scheier et al., 2001) . Much of the research on the relationship between optimism and health has drawn its conclusions by contrasting optimists to pessimists. Based on these comparisons, it appears that optimists use more effective coping strategies than pessimists when confronted by threat or challenge (Long & Sangster, 1993; Scheier et al. 1986 ). Indeed, a recent meta-analysis confirmed that coping differences mediate the relationship between optimism and health (Solberg Nes & Segerstrom, 2006) .",

            "text": "It is noteworthy that in the current study, dispositional optimism was significantly and inversely correlated with pain catastrophizing, a maladaptive coping strategy that has previously been shown to be associated with diminished CPM responses . Although catastrophizing was negatively, but not significantly, associated with CPM in this study, we speculate that the presence and/or absence of adaptive versus maladaptive coping strategies may be a potential mechanism linking optimism and CPM. At this time, the neurophysiology of CPM in humans has not been completely characterized. Nonetheless, animal studies have described an inhibitory bulbo-spinal loop (Villanueva & Le Bars, 1995) and a recent fMRI study of CPM effects in healthy adults and patients with irritable bowel syndrome suggested that a network of subcortical and cortical structures, including the amygdala, anterior cingulate cortex, insula, periaqueductal gray, and prefrontal cortex, might be involved (Piche et al., 2009; Wilder-Smith et al., 2004) . Moreover, additional developments in functional neuroimaging studies have shown that many of the cortical regions thought to be relevant to CPM effects are also implicated in the generation of optimistic expectations (Sharot et al., 2007) , and in the processes of adaptive coping that characterize optimism (Edwards et al., 2009) . For instance, the experimental induction of optimistic bias and the use of adaptive pain coping strategies (e.g., positive reinterpretation of pain-related sensations, cognitive restructuring, and making positive self-statements) have both been associated with reduced subjective perceptions of pain, with greater activation of regions in the prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate, and corresponding attenuations in activation of key pain-processing areas such as the insular and secondary somatosensory cortices (Sharot et al., 2007; Wiech et al., 2006; Wiech et al., 2008) . Thus, dispositional optimism and its accompanying cognitive processes such as adaptive pain coping strategies appear to be associated with the engagement of many of the cortical regions involved in topdown modulation of pain processing. Altogether, these findings suggest the possibility that dispositional optimism may directly or indirectly interact with the CNS processing of noxious stimuli to affect CPM and the perception of pain. Further research addressing pain coping strategies, and their cerebral underpinnings, as mechanisms underlying the association between dispositional optimism and pain-inhibitory processes related to CPM is needed.",

            "text": "CPM is now known to be, at least partially, opioid-dependent (Sprenger et al., 2011; Willer et al., 1990) , and some indirect evidence links dispositional optimism specifically with the function of exogenous and endogenous opioid pain-control systems. Dispositional optimism is well supported for its relationships with individuals' expectations for the future and the use of more active/adaptive coping strategies (Scheier & Carver, 1985; Scheier et al., 1986) . In turn, expectation-induced placebo analgesia was found to be associated with marked activation of mu-opioid receptor mediated neurotransmission in many brain regions including the prefrontal cortex and amygdala (Wager et al., 2007; Zubieta et al., 2005) , and placebo analgesia was most potent and reproducible for individuals with greater dispositional optimism (Geers et al., 2010; Morton et al., 2009) . Furthermore, adaptive pain coping strategies have also been shown to be associated with activation of opioid-mediated endogenous pain-inhibitory systems (Bandura et al., 1987) . Lastly, greater dispositional optimism has been shown to be a significant moderator of the relationship between pain and daily opioid medication use in adolescents with sickle cell disease (Pence et al., 2007) , suggesting that the more optimistic adolescents were better able to match their opioid use to their pain severity. On balance, these studies hint at the possibility that the current study's finding of an association between greater dispositional optimism and enhanced CPM may be related to the facilitation of underlying opioid-dependent mechanisms.",

The lack of significant ethnic differences in dispositional optimism and CPM demonstrated in the present study is not consistent with what has been reported by previous research (Campbell et al., 2008B; Chang, 1996; Chang et al., 2010) . This lack of significant ethnic differences may be attributable, at least in part, to certain factors related to the composition of the study sample. For instance, as the sample was drawn from a group of college students willing to complete experimental pain testing for compensation, this presents a potential sampling bias. Additionally, the inclusion of a young and healthy sample of Caucasian, Asian, and African Americans may limit the generalizability of this study's findings to clinical populations. Given that dispositional optimism and CPM are reportedly dampened and disrupted in clinical pain cohorts (Garafalo, 2000; King et al., 2009) , the associations among dispositional optimism, CPM, and pain responses may well be less robust (or non-existent) in clinical populations than was found in our non-clinical sample. The fact that these were college students likely reduces socioeconomic differences that have been shown to be prevalent across and within ethnic groups. Additional research, incorporating a wider range of individuals from varied socioeconomic and educational backgrounds will be useful to verify whether the strength of the optimism-CPM relationship found in this study indeed remains consistent across different ethnic groups. Consideration of socioeconomic factors is important because they have been reported to exert strong influences of individuals' optimistic/pessimistic expectations for the future (Heinonen et al., 2006) and the self-report of pain (Latza et al., 2000) , especially among individuals faced with chronic pain (Fuentes et al., 2007) .",

            "text": "In conclusion, this study extends prior research suggesting the potentially important role of personality characteristics in shaping CNS pain processing. Further studies that examine potential mechanisms (e.g., endogenous opioids such as \u03b2-endorphin) underlying the relationship between greater dispositional optimism and enhanced CPM outcomes are needed. Whether psychological treatments for pain that attempt to amplify individuals' optimistic outlooks on life have effects through biological mechanisms such as alteration of descending pain-modulatory pathways is not yet known. Future research addressing this possibility may lend further support to the primary role of personality characteristics in the modulation of central pain processing and pain outcomes. Additionally, because the relationship between optimism and CPM was significant yet small, future studies should examine other centrally-mediated pain processing mechanisms that may partially account for the relationship between dispositional optimism and pain responses. Temporal summation, a frequently used index of central pain facilitation, may be one such mechanism. Although the hypothesis has not yet been tested to date, greater dispositional optimism may be concurrently associated with enhanced pain-inhibitory and diminished pain-facilitatory processes reflected by temporal summation (Staud et al., 2003) , which may collectively mitigate pain processing and result in better pain outcomes.
