Corticosteroids are commonly used in these assessments, but interpretation is complicated because corticosterone levels are influenced by factors that include the method of sample collection, sex, immune status, circadian rhythm, and nutritional status 10 . They also increase when an animal experiences extreme fear (distress) or extreme pleasure (eustress) 21 , requiring the addition of behavioral assessment to accurately determine the state of the animal. Changes in body weight and organ weights relative to body weight have been among the more reliable measures of chronic stress as these measure change more slowly, making them a stronger reflection of the effects of exposure to chronic stressors 22-24 .

One of the most common measurements of stress in laboratory animals is the corticosterone assessment. However, while this measurement provides a highly accurate reflection of the animal's response to acute stressors, its interpretation is more prone to error when evaluating the effect of chronic stress. This study evaluated the use of the neutrophil:lymphocyte (NE:LY) ratio as an assessment of chronic stress in male and female C57Bl/6N mice as compared to serum corticosterone. One group of mice was exposed to mild daily stressors for 7 days, while the control group was handled with normal husbandry. The NE:LY ratio and serum corticosterone levels were significantly elevated in the chronically stressed mice, though a significant increase in corticosterone was only significant in males when compared by sex. The chronically stressed mice also demonstrated significantly fewer entries into the open arms and less time spent in the open arms of the elevated plus maze, suggesting that the mild daily stressors had induced a state of distress. The findings of this study confirm that the NE:LY ratio is a valid measurement for chronic stress in the laboratory mouse. However, these assays do not distinguish between distress or eustress, so behavioral and physiological assessments should always be included to determine a complete assessment of the well-being of the mouse.",

Not unexpectedly, the study also documented a sex difference in serum corticosterone levels, with the chronically stressed male mice exhibiting a significantly higher corticosterone level as compared to the chronically stressed female mice. Additionally, the behavioral assessment of the chronically stressed mice demonstrated that they were less likely to spend time on the open arms and less likely to enter the open arms of the elevated plus maze. As demonstrated by previous studies, these findings suggest that the mice were more anxious and distressed 35 as compared to the mice that were handled routinely.

There was also a non-significant neutrophilia and lymphopenia in the chronically stressed mice, but all values were within published normal for C57BL/6NCrl mice 36 . These findings are consistent with other published studies that chronic exposure to elevated corticosterone causes a shift of neutrophilia with or without a concurrent lymphopenia 10, 25, 27 , and can be measured successfully by evaluating the NE:LY ratio of experimental treatment groups as compared to control groups 25, 27 . Because the differences were robust and reflective of the behavioral changes, this suggests that the NE:LY ratio is an appropriate measurement to use when assessing chronic distress in a clinically healthy mouse. The measurement of the NE:LY ratio also has significant advantages over the measurement of serum corticosterone. Although this study utilized an automated hemocytology machine, the NE:LY ratio can be calculated from a blood smear by manually performing a differential 25, 27 . Measurement of serum corticosterone requires the use of specialized kits and additional machinery, such as ELISA readers, for accurate calculation of the concentrations. As previously reported in the laboratory rat, the NE:LY ratio also is not influenced by the response to acute stressors, such as handling to obtain the blood collection 27 . It is also less sensitive to potentially confounding variables such as time of day, sex (which was seen in the serum corticosterone results of this study) and appetence, though it can be affected by chronic pathogen exposure 25, 27 .",
