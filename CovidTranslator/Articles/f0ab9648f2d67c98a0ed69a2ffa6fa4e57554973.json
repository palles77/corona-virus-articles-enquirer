A novel coronavirus was subsequently identified as the causative pathogen, provisionally named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). As of Jan 26, 2020, more than 2000 cases of 2019-nCoV infection have been confirmed, most of which involved people living in or visiting Wuhan, and human-to-human transmission has been confirmed.",

Complete and partial 2019-nCoV genome sequences were obtained from these individuals. Viral contigs were connected using Sanger sequencing to obtain the full-length genomes, with the terminal regions determined by rapid amplification of cDNA ends. Phylogenetic analysis of these 2019-nCoV genomes and those of other coronaviruses was used to determine the evolutionary history of the virus and help infer its likely origin. Homology modelling was done to explore the likely receptor-binding properties of the virus.",

Notably, 2019-nCoV was closely related (with 88% identity) to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, collected in 2018 in Zhoushan, eastern China, but were more distant from SARS-CoV (about 79%) and MERS-CoV (about 50%). Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 2019-nCoV fell within the subgenus Sarbecovirus of the genus Betacoronavirus, with a relatively long branch length to its closest relatives bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, and was genetically distinct from SARS-CoV. Notably, homology modelling revealed that 2019-nCoV had a similar receptor-binding domain structure to that of SARS-CoV, despite amino acid variation at some key residues.",

Although our phylogenetic analysis suggests that bats might be the original host of this virus, an animal sold at the seafood market in Wuhan might represent an intermediate host facilitating the emergence of the virus in humans. Importantly, structural analysis suggests that 2019-nCoV might be able to bind to the angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 receptor in humans. The future evolution, adaptation, and spread of this virus warrant urgent investigation.",

Novel mammalian coronaviruses are now regularly identified. 1 For example, an HKU2related coronavirus of bat origin was responsible for a fatal acute diarrhoea syndrome in pigs in 2018. 4 for 2494 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection and 858 fatalities since September, 2012, including 38 deaths following a single introduction into South Korea. 8, 9 In late December, 2019, several patients with viral pneumonia were found to be epidemiologically associated with the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan, in the Hubei province of China, where a number of non-aquatic animals such as birds and rabbits were also on sale before the outbreak. A novel, human-infecting coronavirus, 10, 11 provisionally named 2019 novel corona virus (2019-nCoV), was identified with use of next-generation sequencing. As of Jan 28, 2020, China has reported more than 5900 confirmed and more than 9000 suspected cases of 2019-nCoV infection across 33 Chinese provinces or municipalities, with 106 fatalities. In addition, 2019-nCoV has now been reported in Thailand, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Singapore, and the USA. Infections in medical workers and family clusters were also reported and human-to-human transmission has been confirmed. 12 Most of the infected patients had a high fever and some had dyspnoea, with chest radiographs revealing invasive lesions in both lungs. 12, 13 We report the epidemiological data of nine inpatients, from at least three hospitals in Wuhan, who were diagnosed with viral pneumonia of unidentified cause. Using next-generation sequencing of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples and cultured isolates from these patients, 2019-nCoV was found. We describe the genomic characterisation of ten genomes of this novel virus, providing important information on the origins and cell receptor binding of the virus.",

In addition, the sequence identity in 1b (about 86%) was lower than that in 1a (about 90%; figure 2A) . Most of the encoded proteins exhibited high sequence identity between 2019-nCoV and the related bat-derived coronaviruses ( figure 2a) . The notable exception was the spike protein, with only around 80% sequence identity, and protein 13, with 73\u00b72% sequence identity. Notably, the 2019-nCoV strains were less genetically similar to SARS-CoV (about 79%) and MERS-CoV (about 50%).

Both the N-terminal domain and the C-terminal domain of the S1 domain can bind to host receptors. 28 We inspected amino acid variation in the spike protein among the Sarbecovirus coronaviruses The receptor-binding domain of betacoronaviruses, which directly engages the receptor, is commonly located in the C-terminal domain of S1, as in SARS-CoV 29 for lineage B, and MERS-CoV 30,31 and BatCoV HKU4, 32 for lineage C (figure 5). Through phylogenetic analysis of the receptor-binding domain of four different lineages of betacoronaviruses (appendix p 4), we found that, although 2019-nCoV was closer to bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21 at the whole-genome level, the receptor-binding domain of 2019-nCoV fell within lineage B and was closer to that of SARS-CoV (figure 5A). The three-dimensional structure of 2019-nCoV receptorbinding domain was modelled using the Swiss-Model program 33 with the SARS-CoV receptor-binding domain structure (Protein Data Bank ID 2DD8) 34 as a template. This analysis suggested that, like other betacoronaviruses, the receptor-binding domain was composed of a core and an external subdomain ( figure 5B-D) .",

This finding suggests either possible droplet transmission or that the patient was infected by a currently unknown source. Evidence of clusters of infected family members and medical workers has now confirmed the presence of human-to-human transmission. 12 Clearly, this infection is a major public health concern, particularly as this outbreak coincides with the peak of the Chinese Spring Festival travel rush, during which hundreds of millions of people will travel through China. As a typical RNA virus, the average evolutionary rate for coronaviruses is roughly 10 -\u2074 nucleotide substitutions per site per year, 1 with mutations arising during every replication cycle. It is, therefore, striking that the sequences of 2019-nCoV from different patients described here were almost identical, with greater than 99\u00b79% sequence identity.

However, despite the importance of bats, several facts suggest that another animal is acting as an intermediate host between bats and humans. First, the outbreak was first reported in late December, 2019, when most bat species in Wuhan are hibernating. Second, no bats were sold or found at the Huanan seafood market, whereas various non-aquatic animals (including mammals) were available for purchase. Third, the sequence identity between 2019-nCoV and its close relatives bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21 was less than 90%, which is reflected in the relatively long branch between them. Hence, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21 are not direct ancestors of 2019-nCoV. Fourth, in both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, bats acted as the natural reservoir, with another animal (masked palm civet for SARS-CoV 35 and dromedary camels for MERS-CoV) 36 acting as an intermediate host, with humans as terminal hosts. Therefore, on the basis of current data, it seems likely that the 2019-nCoV causing the Wuhan outbreak might also be initially hosted by bats, and might have been transmitted to humans via currently unknown wild animal(s) sold at the Huanan seafood market.",
