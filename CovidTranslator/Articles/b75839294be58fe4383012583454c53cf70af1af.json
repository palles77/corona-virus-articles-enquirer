New potential COVID-19 therapies are currently under investigation in multiple trials worldwide. Of these, tocilizumab has recently demonstrated effectiveness in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia [2] . We report the favorable changes of CT findings in a 64-year-old man, who received tocilizumab as a treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia.",

            "text": "A 64-year-old man without significant clinical history initially presented with syncope. His vital signs were within the normal ranges. Ear temperature was 38 \u00b0C and oxygen saturation was 99% on room air. Chest X-Rays showed mild linear densities in the lower and middle left lung fields. Laboratory investigations showed increased white blood cell count (10.900 per \u03bcL), elevated serum lactate level (250 U/L) and elevated reactive C protein (RCP) (89 mg/dL). The other blood tests showed normal results. COVID-19 was detected in a throat swab sample by RT-PCR. Due to the worsening of the blood tests on the day 2 (white blood cell count 15.270 per \u03bcL, lactate 341 U/L, CRP 285 mg/dL), the patient was admitted to a dedicated ward. On day 6, the patients developed dyspnea; decreased of oxygen saturation (90%) and further increase of CRP was observed (336 mg/dL); white blood cell count was 10.800 per \u03bcL; interleukin-6 was 80 ng/L (normal values < 6 ng/dL). On day 7, unenhanced chest CT showed the presence of diffused bilateral air space opacities, including ground glass opacities and consolidation, with prevalent posterior distribution, linear opacities, mainly peripheral, mild bilateral pleural effusion, and mediastinal lymphadenopathy (Figure 1 ). Assisted ventilation was started. The patient received 2 doses of tocilizumab (8 mg/kg), 12 hours apart, on day 7 and 8. On day 9, CRP dropped to 96 mg/dL and white blood cell count to 2.360 per \u03bcL. Patient clinical condition progressively improved and ventilatory support was gradually weaned. On day 14, repeat chest CT showed mark improvement of CT findings, with size reduction of air cells opacities, density reduction of consolidations, with evidence of some ground glass opacities, peripheral reticular opacities, reduction of pleural effusion and mediastinal lymphadenopathy.",

In this scenario, chest CT plays a central role. Different studies demonstrated the importance of chest CT in the diagnosis and first assessment of COVID-19 pneumonia with demonstration of the damages to the lung parenchyma, including interstitial inflammation and consolidation, similar to the features previously reported for other coronavirus infections; however few data are currently available on the changes in chest CT findings from initial diagnosis until patient recovery, and evaluating therapeutic efficacy [3] . It is likely that in a near future, chest CT will become a pivotal tool for monitoring disease progression and effectiveness of experimental therapies in patients affected by COVID-19 pneumonia.",
