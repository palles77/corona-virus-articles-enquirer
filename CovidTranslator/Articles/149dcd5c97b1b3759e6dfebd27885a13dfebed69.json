However, setting up individual PCRs for all respiratory viruses is not practical so preferentially multiplex PCRs are used. Objectives: To develop for routine diagnosis a rapid real-time PCR assay for detection of hRV and hMPV including an internal control in a single tube multiplex reaction using probes carrying different fluorophores to discriminate targets. Study design: The multiplex real-time RNA PCR was optimized to include the internal control virus and a total of 358 respiratory samples from 239 patients taken over a one-year period were analyzed by the multiplex assay. Results: The multiplex assay with co-amplification of the internal control was as sensitive and specific as the individual assays. Application of this assay on clinical samples from 239 patients in a one-year period resulted in an incidence of hRV and hMPV of 41/239 (17.1%) and 6/239 (2.5%), respectively. Inhibition, defined as poor internal control amplification, was detected in 8 (2.2%) samples. Culture was performed on these samples and only four hRV were detected. Conclusions: This real-time PCR method enables sensitive diagnosis of these two respiratory pathogens with the potential to expand the assay as part of a full molecular respiratory viral screen.",

            "text": "Acute upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) is the most widespread type of acute infection. Two common causes of URTI are human rhinovirus (hRV) and human metapneumovirus (hMPV), accounting for approximately 48% and 10% of URTIs, respectively (Steininger et al., 2001; Kahn, 2003) . However, hRV and hMPV can also cause lower respiratory tract (LRT) symptoms such as severe bronchiolitis and pneumonia (Van den Hoogen et al., 2001; Falsey et al., 2002) . Detection of both viruses is non-optimal by conventional cell culture and the slow-growth of hMPV was one of the reasons for the late discovery of the virus (Osterhaus and Fouchier, 2003) . Accurate diagnosis of hRV and hMPV requires molecular methods Van den Hoogen et al., 2001; Blomqvist et al., 2002; Boivin et al., 2002; Peret et al., 2002; Stockton et al., 2002; Vicente et al., 2003) . Most of the PCRs described for detection of hMPV and hRV are designed to identify the virus with individual PCRs and are either time consuming as they require post PCR analysis or costly as they require two PCR reactions. One of the benefits of real-time PCR is that amplifications can be multiplexed as probes carrying different fluorophores enable 1386-6532/$ -see front matter \u00a9 2005 Elsevier B.V.

These viruses cause a significant number of acute respiratory viral infections in children and are found in more severe respiratory disease as well. The assay was proven to be sensitive with no negative effects by multiplexing. As different probes were used for the two viruses and the internal control, no post PCR analysis was required. The multiplex RT-PCR is specific for hMPV, but the primers and probe designed for hRV also amplify high input concentrations of some enterovirus subtypes with a weak signal. Differentiation between hRV and enteroviruses using hybridisation probes has been described (L\u00f6nnrot et al., 1999; Kares et al., 2004) . Adding a specific EV PCR in the multiplex or sequencing the whole PCR product would solve the problem of differentiation. Unfortunately, no appropriate sequence suitable for realtime PCR and discriminating between hRV and enterovirus subtypes is available (Nijhuis et al., 2002) . However, in clinical diagnosis the necessity of further discrimination of hRV and enteroviruses is questionable, as management and therapy issues are not affected by this identification.",

Only 4 patients were positive for hRV by viral culture, while the multiplex RNA-PCR revealed 41 positive patients. Therefore, viral culture for diagnosis of hRV is very insensitive in this study, but PCR has been shown to be superior for detection of hRV in other studies as well. Molecular methods have demonstrated infection rates as high as 50% in URTI (Steininger et al., 2001; Blomqvist et al., 2002) . In this study, the incidence of hRV infections peaked during the winter, but was also present in autumn and summer in immunocompromised patients.",
