All five isolates tested were able to infect spleen cells and the three types of lymphobtastoid cell lines, suggesting that avian rotaviruses can infect both B and T cells. Splenic lymphocytes were considerably-less susceptible to infection than chick kidney cells. Lymphoblastoid cell lines remained virus-positive during a 10day culture period. Virus was neutralized by the addition of low dilutions of normal chicken serum and high dilutions of chicken anti-rotavirus serum.",

Supernatant fluids collected from the infected lymphoblastoid cell lines at 8 and 10 days in culture were positive for cell-free virus. Titers were between 103 and 104 TCIDs0 for each cell line. Spleen cell cultures seemed to be less susceptible to infection than the lymphoblastoid cell lines. Spleen cells do not survive very well under these conditions and the percentage of viable cells was only 44, 12 and 12 at 48 hours for the 3 spleen cell preparations in Table 1 . In contrast, the lymphoblastoid cell lines were either stable or increasing in cell numbers at 48 hours (data not shown).",

This paper extends their results and describes that avian rotaviruses can certainly infect and perhaps replicate in splenic lymphoeytes in the absence of mitogens, but, it can not be excluded that the low percentage of positive cells were activated cells. The surface markers present on virus-positive spleen cells are compatible with B and T cells (I a, ~x and CLA). The finding that three different types of lymphoblastoid cell lines are susceptible to infection supports the concept that rot~viruses can infect both B and T lymphocytes. The question if cell-free infectious virus is indeed produced in lymphoblastoid cell lines is difficult to answer. The recovery of low levels of infectious virus at 8 and l0 days in culture (Table 4) suggest that it is possible. On the other hand it can not be excluded that some of the original inoeulum survived outside the cells.",

However, the establishment of infection in lymphocytes is much less efficient than the infection of CKC: 4 \u00d7 10 ~ TCIDs0 in CKC infected between 200 and 1400 lymphoblasteid cells depending on the cell line. It is not clear if these differences are due to quantitative differences in expression of the putative receptors or that the lymphoblastoid cells lack certain enzymes important for viral replication. Clearly, the finding that lymphocytes and lymphoblastoid cells are susceptible to infection will be an important aspect in the search for a rotavirus receptor.",

Virus neutralizing substances {VNS) have been described in the albumin fraction of FBS interfering with the replication of duck hepatitis virus (6) . LMH medium contains both chicken serum and FBS, buth the lymphoblastoid cells are washed prior to exposure with rotavirus. Apparently, the 1-hour incubation period with the chicken serum allows the VNS to interact with the trypsintreated virus.

We are currently investigating this aspect of the pathogenesis. The infection of lyinphocytes may also be important for the establishment of a carrier state. ESTES and GRAHAM (9) and CHIARINI et al. (8) described the establishment of carrier state cultures by cultivation of rotavirus in cell lines. The addition of FBS was essential for the establishment of their persistently infected cultures. The number of virus antigen positive cells remained low and only low levels of virus were released in the supernatant fluids. This system has remarkable similarities with the cultivation of avian rotavirus in lymphoblastoid cell lines: the use of FBS in addition to chicken serum in the medium, low level virus antigen expression decreasing over a 10-to 12-day period and only a low level release of virus into the supernatant fluids. It will be important to establish persistently infected cultures of lymphoblastoid cell lines and determine if these cells can play a role in the persistence and pathogenesis of rotavirus infection in avian species.",
