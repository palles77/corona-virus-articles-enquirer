            "text": "The recent epidemic of Ebola virus disease in west Africa showed the power of data generated and analysed by the responder and academic communities to help shape and improve the public health response in international health emergencies. The swift response of clinical, public health, and academic professionals from diverse backgrounds was exemplary. Data and insights from many sciences, especially in peer-reviewed papers and online data, were crucial to planning the immediate and medium-term strategy. [1] [2] [3] [4] The early response to the Ebola epidemic, however, was also accompanied by several examples of individuals and organisations being unwilling to share data in real time, including data that was vital for public health planning in this diffi cult, fast-moving emergency. This problem was encountered by the countries most aff ected, governmental and non-governmental organisations, and even WHO. 5 It would be invidious to highlight particular examples; in our experience, this lack of data sharing was serious in its potential eff ect on the early response. The Ebola outbreak was not the fi rst public health emergency where this has occurred, even though the response to the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic showed the power of real-time data sharing in rapid public health responses. 6 There are already moves afoot to ensure that key data supporting all publications in major journals are made publicly available. However, the situation of public health emergencies requires particular and urgent attention in this regard.",

Three disincentives were frequently mentioned: data sharing would jeopardise subsequent publication; it would allow pre-emptive use of data by others for their own publications; and it would breach confi dentiality agreements. None of these reasons showed those involved in a good light, given an unfolding emergency with minimum systematic information on which responders could base early decisions. This unwillingness to share data threatened the lives of both communities and health-care workers, including some of those who provided the data in the fi rst place.",

Health puts a human face on what can sometimes seem to be a distant threat. By making the case for climate change as a health issue, we hope that the civilisational crisis we face will achieve greater public resonance. Public concerns about the health eff ects of climate change, such as undernutrition and food insecurity, have the potential to accelerate political action in ways that attention to carbon dioxide emissions alone do not.",

Such a recommendation would provide a strong but not an onerous positive incentive. The model for this suggestion is the farsighted decision by ICMJE journal editors not to accept trials that have not been prospectively registered. 8 That decision transformed the availability of prospective trial information in the public domain.
