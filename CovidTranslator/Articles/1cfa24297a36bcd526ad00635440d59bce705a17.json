            "text": "The ongoing epidemic of chronic wasting disease (CWD) within cervid populations indicates the need for novel approaches for disease management. A vaccine that either reduces susceptibility to infection or reduces shedding of prions by infected animals, or a combination of both, could be of benefit for disease control. The development of such a vaccine is challenged by the unique nature of prion diseases and the requirement for formulation and delivery in an oral format for application in wildlife settings. To address the unique nature of prions, our group targets epitopes, termed disease specific epitopes (DSEs), whose exposure for antibody binding depends on diseaseassociated misfolding of PrP C into PrP Sc . Here, a DSE corresponding to the rigid loop (RL) region, which was immunogenic following parenteral vaccination, was translated into an oral vaccine. This vaccine consists of a replication-incompetent human adenovirus expressing a truncated rabies glycoprotein G recombinant fusion with the RL epitope (hAd5:tgG-RL). Oral immunization of white-tailed deer with hAd5:tgG-RL induced PrP Sc -specific systemic and mucosal antibody responses with an encouraging safety profile in terms of no adverse health effects nor prolonged vector shedding. By building upon proven strategies of formulation for wildlife vaccines, these efforts generate a particular PrP Sc -specific oral vaccine for CWD as well as providing a versatile Correspondence to: Scott Napper; 120 Veterinary Road, platform, in terms of carrier protein and biological vector, for generation of other oral, peptide-based CWD vaccines.",

            "text": "Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is a prion disease that is currently spreading through North American cervid populations. 1 Incidence of CWD has largely been limited to North America, but reported cases in South Korea and Norway indicate the potential for global consequences. 2,3 CWD has had a devastating impact on the farmed elk industry and its ongoing spread through wild populations threatens a natural resource that is of considerable economic, ecological and social importance. The circumstantial evidence that human prion diseases can result from exposure to CWD, as well as a recent demonstration of oral transmission of CWD to cynomolgus macaques, add concern of the zoonotic potential of CWD. 4, 5 At the current time, culling is the primary tool available for management of CWD. While there has been some success in limiting the spread of CWD in wild populations through strategic culling, this is an incomplete and controversial strategy for long-term disease management. 6, 7 Management of CWD, in particular within wild populations, will likely depend on the coordinated application of several disease management strategies. One important component of this strategy may be the use of vaccines to either reduce PrP Sc shedding or prevent infection. In particular, the unique ability of prions to cause long-term environmental contamination, lasting from years to decades, supports vaccination as a strategy to both achieve prophylactic prevention and reduce shedding towards mitigating exposure and infection of animals in contaminated environments. 8, 9 Emerging evidence of the uptake and presentation of environmentally-shed prions by plants further support the importance of limiting shedding by infected animals. 10 Development of a prion vaccine is challenged by the unique nature of the infectious agent; the misfolding of a self-protein (PrP C ) into an infectious and pathological conformation (PrP Sc ). 11 While an effective vaccine for CWD remains elusive, there is proof of principle evidence that this is an achievable goal as antibodies to PrP C neutralize prion propagation in vitro and in vivo. [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] Numerous studies have shown the benefits of immunization to abrogate infectivity, reduce PrP Sc loads within relevant tissue, increase survival time, and provide partial protection following infection. [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] Further, the paradigms of vaccine success are shifting such that reduced shedding, rather than outright prevention of infection, may be a relevant and achievable measure of vaccine efficacy.",

            "text": "While these results provide optimism for the development of a prion vaccine, there are concerns of potentially deleterious consequences associated with the induction of antibodies with reactivity towards a widely-expressed self-protein. While many passive and active immunization trials involving antibodies against PrP C do not cause pathological reactions, other early experiments suggested that antibodies against PrP C trigger neuronal apoptosis or activation of inappropriate signalling cascades. [30] [31] [32] Further investigation suggested that antibodies to a variety epitopes of the globular domain of PrP C have varying degrees of neurotoxicity. 33 Mechanistically, this neurotoxicity seems to mimic the cellular events associated with prion infection and may involve antibody-induced conformational changes in PrP C . 34, 35 By targeting epitopes that are specifically exposed upon pathological misfolding of PrP C to PrP Sc , it is possible to induce antibody responses specific for the pathological conformation, thereby sparing the healthy form of the protein and prioritizing the immune response to the problematic conformation. To date, three DSEs have been translated into injected vaccines that induce PrP Sc antibody responses. 36, 37 Of these, a rigid loop (RL) DSE is considered particularly attractive for a CWD vaccine based on unique structural features of this loop in cervid PrP including its predicted ability to convert from a compact loop into an unstructured region that resembles a free peptide immunogen. 38, 39 The majority of efforts to develop prion vaccines have been in the context of injected delivery which could have application for farmed animals. For wild animals, an effective vaccine would need to be deployed without direct contact with animals, making oral vaccines the best delivery option. The potential benefits of oral vaccination are perhaps best exemplified by the highly-successful example of rabies that demonstrated it is possible to achieve protective immunity through oral, self-administered vaccines. 40, 41 Different molecular and biological vectors have been investigated as oral CWD vaccines and these studies have demonstrated that oral vaccine formulations can induce both mucosal and systemic antibody responses in deer and mice. [24] [25] [26] [27] Perhaps most relevant, Goni et al, using a Salmonella-based oral delivery platform in deer, were able to induce partially protective immune responses to CWD. 25 This, however, was achieved with an intensive immunization protocol (8 immunizations, including specific manual application of the vaccine to the tonsils) that would limit the potential for application of this approach in a wildlife setting. Optimistically this study provides proof-of-principle support for the development of an oral CWD vaccine while highlighting the need for delivery platforms that are compatible with a real-world wildlife vaccine from economic, regulatory and practical considerations.",

This vector shedding reflects passive transmission of the oral vector through the animal since the hAd5 vector was not replication competent. At 14 days after primary (A) Antibody titers were quantified by capture ELISA using cervid PrP C 90-231 as coating antigen, and are reported as mean values \u00a7 1 SD. Monoclonal antibodies 6D11 and M2188 served as positive controls, while polyOv.RL sera served as a negative control. (B) Immunoprocipitation of PrP from healthy and prioninfected brains. Pooled serum from deer orally immunized with hAd5:tgG-RL was assessed for reactivity with PrP Sc and PrP C . Serum antibodies were cross-linked to magnetic beads and incubated with non-infected and infected 10% brain homogenate. A PrP C/Sc reactive monoclonal antibody, AH6B, as well as polyclonal antibodies affinity-purified from serum samples collected following parenteral vaccination with a YML construct were included as controls. The YML antibody has demonstrated reactivity with PrP Sc in immunoprecipitation assays. 37 FIGURE 5. Vector Shedding. Ten white-tailed deer (n D 5/group) orally received 2.0 \u00a3 10 10 viral particles of either hAd5 or hAd5:tgG-RL. Animals were orally immunized at D0 and D14. Total DNA was isolated from fecal samples on individual animals, and served as template for diagnostic PCR to identify viral sequence coding for the Ad5 hexon protein. DNA concentration was standardized for each 20 ul PCR, and entire reactions were resolved in 1% agarose gels.",

Shedding of the hAd5 vector was limited to three days immediately following vaccination. In contrast, shedding could be detected for weeks following oral delivery of a replication-competent vector. 47 That the replication-defective vector was able to infect cells in the gastro-intestinal tract of white-tailed deer and express the transgene was evident in the induction of RL-specific systemic and mucosal antibody responses.

Based on virus shedding, we can be confident that the non-responding animal (An3) received the vaccine but (based on the splenocyte proliferation assays and antibody titres) did not mount an immunological response to the vaccine. There are a number of potential explanations for this vaccine non-responder. Firstly, it is important to appreciate that the purpose of this investigation was to provide proof-of-principle for the development of an oral vaccine for cervids utilizing vectors that are consistent with a real-world vaccine from financial and regulatory perspectives. This did not include efforts to optimize either the dose or timing of the vaccinations which could certainly impact the magnitude and consistency of the induced responses. As such, it may be possible to achieve a more prominent and uniform response through optimizing the dose and/or timing of vaccination. Secondly, within outbred populations, even for commercialized vaccines, it is not unusual to observe variability in vaccine responsiveness, including non-responders.",

Further to that, the antibody titres induced following oral vaccination with the hAd5:tgG-RL vector were approximately two orders of magnitude lower than those achieved when using an adjuvanted parenteral vaccine with the same DSE. 36, 37 This may be due to the delivery of an unadjuvanted oral vaccine which was not dose optimized as well as the use of a replicationincompetent vector that generated a limited amount of antigen. Further, with the oral vaccine, there wasn't a significant anamnestic response following the secondary immunization. This may be due to the induction of hAd5-specifc immunity, which prevented virus infection or uptake by mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue. The parenteral DSE-specific vaccine induced antibody responses that were also detectable in nasal secretions and cerebrospinal fluid. 36 The failure of the oral vaccine to induce detectable humoral responses within either nasal secretions or CSF [data not shown] may be attributable to the induction of a much lower systemic antibody response. There are several options to increase the immunogenicity, and potentially protective capacity, of the hAd5 vector. These include optimizing the dose and timing of vaccination as well as incorporating accessory immunostimulatory proteins in the transgene, chemical modification or encapsulation of the recombinant virus to decrease degradation in gastrointestinal tract, and possibly reducing interference by vector immunity by increasing the interval between multiple immunizations. [48] [49] [50] While developing a CWD vaccine for use in wild cervids was the primary objective of this study, these results may also be applicable in captive cervids and domestic livestock. A properly formulated and sufficiently immunogenic vaccine could be delivered in the feed of animals, thereby providing a method to eliminate the handling of individual animals during vaccination. While oral immunization is the only option for implementing a cervid-specific wildlife vaccination program, a commensurate benefit to mucosal vaccination is the induction of a broad anti-PrP humoral response. Recent studies indicate the importance of inducing both systemic and mucosal immunity, where high levels of IgG and IgA correlated to increased survival. [25] [26] [27] While the current efforts prioritized a particular DSE, the platform could easily be adapted for other peptide epitopes, including those associated with antibody responses against PrP C .",
