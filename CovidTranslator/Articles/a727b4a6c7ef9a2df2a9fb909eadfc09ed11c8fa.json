This paper reports NMR structure determinations of the C-terminal domain (SUD-C) and of a two-domain construct (SUD-MC) containing the middle domain (SUD-M) and the C-terminal domain, and NMR data on the conformational states of the N-terminal domain (SUD-N) and the SUD-NM two-domain construct. Both SUD-N and SUD-NM are monomeric and globular in solution, and in SUD-NM there is high mobility in the two-residue interdomain linking sequence, with no preferred relative orientation of the two domains. SUD-C adopts a frataxin-like fold and has structural similarity to DNA-binding domains of DNAmodifying enzymes. The structures of both SUD-M (previously determined) and SUD-C (from the present study) are maintained in SUD-MC, where the two domains are flexibly linked. Gel shift experiments showed that both SUD-C and SUD-MC bind to single-stranded RNA and recognize purine bases more strongly than pyrimidine bases, whereby SUD-MC binds to a more restricted set of purine-containing RNA sequences than SUD-M. NMR chemical shift perturbation experiments with observation of the 15 N-labeled proteins further resulted in the delineation of the RNA binding sites, i.e., in SUD-M a positively charged surface area with a pronounced cavity, and in SUD-C several residues of an antiparallel \u03b2-sheet. Overall, the present data provide evidence for molecular mechanisms involving concerted actions of SUD-M and SUD-C, which result in specific RNA-binding that might be unique to the SUD, and thus to the SARS-CoV.",

            "text": "The SUD was initially annotated as a continuous polypeptide segment of 357 amino acid residues located in the sequence positions 366 to 722 of the SARS-CoV nsp3. 15 In the meantime, atomic resolution structural studies revealed that the SUD actually contains three distinct globular domains, SUD-N, SUD-M and SUD-C, with residues 387-524, 527-651 and 655-720, respectively, which are connected by short linker peptide segments. A NMR structure determination showed that the 'middle domain', SUD-M, forms a macrodomain fold, and biochemical experiments and NMR chemical shift mapping resulted in the identification of a putative RNA-binding site on the protein surface. 16 The NMR structure of SUD-M was then used in a molecular replacement approach to solve a crystal structure of SUD-NM, which contains the two domains SUD-N and SUD-M in a construct of residues 389-652. 17 The crystal structure was found to be a dimer of this two-domain construct, with SUD-N also forming a macrodomain fold. The linker peptide between SUD-N and SUD-M was not observed in the protein crystals. With biochemical experiments it was further shown that SUD-NM forms complexes with G-quadruplexes. 17 This paper describes new NMR structure determinations of the C-terminal domain SUD-C, and of a two-domain construct SUD-MC with residues 527-720. Combined with the previous structure determination of SUD-M,15 these results are used for detailed comparisons of the SUD-M and SUD-C domains in the isolated form and in the two-domain construct, and for investigations of the nature of the link between the two domains. We further present NMR data on SUD-N and SUD-NM in constructs comprising the residues 387-524 and 387-651, respectively, which supplement the aforementioned crystal structure of SUD-NM with a description of the behavior of this protein in solution. Specifically, biochemical data and NMR experiments define the oligomerization state of SUD-NM and the interactions between the N-and M-domains in SUD-NM. The structure determinations are supplemented with investigations of the RNA-binding properties of SUD-M, SUD-C and SUD-MC based on biochemical data and NMR chemical shift perturbation experiments.",

These assignments were used as input for the analysis of the NOESY spectra with UNIO-ATNOS/ASCAN19 , 20 and UNIO-ATNOS/CANDID,21 which yielded the amino acid side chain assignments and the input for the structure calculation with CYANA22 (see the Materials and Methods section for details). The resulting structure ( Fig. 2a-b ) was based on 3750 NOE restraints (916 intraresidual, 954 short-range, 767 medium-range, 1113 long-range). While there were a small number of NOEs between domain hydrogen atoms and hydrogens in the linker peptide or the short chain-terminal tails, no NOEs that would connect hydrogen atoms in the two different domains were observed. In Fig. 2a and b the SUD-M and SUD-C domains are superimposed independently, and it is apparent that there is a large manifold of possible orientations for the domain that was not used for the superposition, showing that the two domains do not adopt a unique orientation relative to each other. In view of this result we repeated the last cycle of the structure calculation separately for each domain, using the NOE restraints within the two individual globular domains (residues 527-648 and 654-720) that had been measured in the intact SUD-MC. The results of these two structure calculations (Table 1) show that the two domains are individually well defined in SUD-MC.",

The linker residues 651-653 that connect the two domains exhibit 15 N{ 1 H}-NOE values ranging from 0.2 to 0.4, indicating significant segmental mobility, whereas the mobility of the residues within both globular domains is essentially limited to the overall molecular tumbling of the protein, with 15 N{ 1 H}-NOE values of 0.7-0.8.

The monomeric state is clearly apparent from the NMR data, as the 2D [ 15 N, 1 H]-HSQC spectrum (red peaks in Fig. 5 ) would be inconsistent with a molecular size of 60 kDa. Independently, size-exclusion chromatography showed that the protein eluted at an apparent molecular weight of 35 kDa, which fits closely with its monomeric size (Fig. 4b) . Based on the similarity of the correlation peaks (Fig. 5 ), we conclude that the globular structures of SUD-N and SUD-M are conserved in the SUD-NM construct. Furthermore, the SUD-N and SUD-M domains are flexibly connected with each other, as evidenced by the close similarity of the peak positions and peak shapes of the isolated domains and the SUD-NM construct (Fig. 5) . Since the resonances of SUD-N have been identified as a group but not individually assigned, the peaks of the 15 N-1 H moieties of residues 525-526, which form the interdomain linker, had to be assigned by exclusion. There is one 15 N-1 H correlation peak (identified in Fig. 5b and d) that has no counterpart in the spectra of the individual domains, and was therefore tentatively assigned to the linker peptide segment. This is one of about 20 peaks in SUD-NM that exhibit 15 N{ 1 H}-NOE values smaller than 0.6 ( Fig. S1 ), which thus indicates that there is increased mobility in parts of SUD-N as well as in the linker peptide, when compared to the bulk of either of the two globular domains.",

SUD-MC has a pI value that is close to neutral (calculated pI = 6.7) and does not enter the gel, but its (GGGA) 5 complex is sufficiently stable and has enough negative charge to enter the gel and to be observed as a discrete band ( Fig. 6b and e). In contrast, the acidic SUD-C (calculated pI = 5.0) does enter the gel, as shown by the protein staining in Fig. 6h , but we do not observe significant RNA-staining at the corresponding position ( Fig.  6g ) and thus conclude that SUD-C does not bind to (GGGA) 5 under the assay conditions used.

This is also the case for the new domain structure presented in this paper, SUD-C, which has a fold that is named after the N-terminal domain of CyaY, a member of the frataxin family of metalbinding proteins involved in iron homeostasis.24 , 25 Despite the structural similarity there is only 10% sequence identity between SUD-C and CyaY, including that only one of the eight residues believed to be involved in iron binding by CyaY is conserved in SUD-C. This makes it unlikely that SUD-C performs the same function. A search of the PDB with the program DALI26 , 27 identified several additional structural homologues, with Z-scores \u2264 4.4 (Table S1 ). These include anthrax edema factor (EF),28 which has adenylate cyclase activity, and AcsD, which is an adenylating enzyme of which SUD-C resembles the Nterminal dimerization domain.29 Similar to the comparison with CyaY, SUD-C lacks any apparent conservation of active-site residues of these proteins, and therefore the observation that two different adenylate-binding enzymes have SUD-C-like folds does not appear to provide a new lead toward the as yet unknown SUD-C function. Among the structural homologues of SUD-C (Table S1) there are also small protein domains that perform regulatory functions for DNA-modifying enzymes. Examples are the N-terminal domain of DNA primase, which is a zinc-binding domain that is responsible for DNA binding and also regulates the activity of the catalytic domain of the enzyme,30 and double-wing motif DNAbinding proteins such as YjbR and MotA.31 , 32 Although the key DNA-binding residues are in no case conserved in SUD-C, it is interesting that other proteins with SUD-C-like folds bind nucleic acids, especially when considering that nucleic acids were observed to copurify with recombinant SUD-C expressed in E. coli (see 'Materials and Methods').",

The NMR structure determination of SUD-MC in solution further reveals that the short linker peptide segment of residues 652-654 between the domains SUD-M and SUD-C allows nearly unrestricted freedom of movement of the two domains relative to each other (Fig. 2) , with no evidence for a preferred interdomain orientation detected by the methods used. Similarly, solution studies of the construct SUD-NM, for which a crystal structure determination has recently been presented,17 indicate extensive freedom of motion of SUD-N and SUD-M relative to each other. SUD-NM is monomeric in solution (Fig. 4) , which contrasts with the observation of a dimeric form in the crystal structure. 17 The observed flexible linkage of the two domains further indicates that an interdomain disulfide bond that has been reported to link SUD-N and SUD-M in the crystal structure is not present in the reducing solvent milieu used for the NMR studies. Since the eukaryotic cell cytoplasm, where the SUD is expected to be located,10 , 23 also presents a reducing milieu,33 it would appear that the monomeric sulfhydryl form observed in solution, with flexibly linked SUD-N and SUD-M domains, might be closely related to the physiologically relevant form of the protein. There are no significant chemical shift perturbations that would indicate tight transient or static contacts between the two domains, and the SUD-NM 15 N-1 H correlation NMR signals have narrower linewidths than one expects for a compact globular domain of 29.6 kDa molecular weight. In view of these observations the following discussion on nucleic acid binding and possible physiological roles of the SUD will be based on a SUD molecular model containing three flexibly linked globular domains.",

            "text": "As a first step toward gaining insight into the mode of nucleic acid binding by SUD-C we evaluated the locations of residues that experience chemical shift perturbations upon addition of purine-containing ssRNAs (Fig. 8) in context with the electrostatic potential distribution on the molecular surface (Fig. 9d ). This shows that the binding surface of SUD-C does not have the characteristics of a typical RNA-binding site, since besides two positively charged residues, of which the histidine in position 658 has the largest perturbation (Fig. 8d) , there are also several negatively charged amino acid side chains (Fig  9e) . In SUD-MC the \u0394\u03b4 values of SUD-C residues at a 1:1 A 10 : protein ratio (Fig. 8c) are significantly increased relative to those of the isolated SUD-C domain. The presence of the SUD-M domain in SUD-MC thus stabilizes the SUD-C-RNA interactions, indicating that the coordinated binding of the linked domains might reduce repulsion of the RNA due to the negative surface charge of SUD-C (Fig. 9d) . A putative binding site on the SUD-C domain in SUD-MC is indicated by the fact that the largest \u0394\u03b4 values were seen for H658, H695, T696, E702, G707 and V709 (Fig. 9c) . Except for H658 in helix \u03b11, these residues are all in the strands \u03b25, \u03b26 and \u03b27 of the \u03b2-sheet (Fig. 1 ) or in the loops joining these strands, and the set of residues with large \u0394\u03b4-values is somewhat smaller but nonetheless clearly similar to that seen for RNA-binding to the isolated SUD-C (Fig. 9e) . SUD-M binds to a larger range of purine-containing RNA sequences than SUD-MC, including that it binds to (ACUG) 5 and interacts more strongly with a mixture of random RNA 20-mers than does SUD-MC. It thus appears that coordinated action of the two domains in SUD-MC results in greater specificity of RNA binding by SUD-MC than by SUD-M, and may thus lead to binding interactions that are unique to SUD-MC. For example, SUD-MC binds to the SARS-CoV transcription-regulatory sequence TRS(+) (5'-CUAAACGAAC-3'), and to its reverse complement in the antigenome, TRS(\u2212) (5'-GUUCGUUUAG-3') (Fig. 6b) . NMR chemical shift perturbations (not shown) were larger in the presence of TRS(+) than with TRS(\u2212), and localized to the same site of the SUD-M domain in SUD-MC that was previously identified for A 10 binding (Fig. 9a) . However, in contrast to A 10 binding (Fig. 8a-c) there was minimal contact of the SUD-C domain with TRS. Since the isolated SUD-M domain did not bind either to TRS(+) or TRS(\u2212), this shows that the SUD-C domain in SUD-MC modifies binding without being directly involved in the ligand interaction. Since TRS(+) and TRS(\u2212) contain six and four purine residues, respectively, the aforementioned larger shift perturbations by TRS(+) again seem to reflect the preference of SUD for purine binding. Poly-A is found at the 3'-end of the viral RNA genome, and these interactions could thus indicate a role for SUD-MC in viral genome or subgenomic RNA transcription.",

            "text": "We further used NMR spectroscopy to explore binding of SUD-M and SUD-MC to other purine RNAs, which yielded results that could only tentatively be interpreted due to line broadening and/or precipitation. Addition of (GGA) 4 resulted in broadening of the SUD-M resonance linewidths in SUD-MC with increasing RNA:protein ratio. Thus, at a (GGA) 4 :protein ratio of 0.5:1 most peaks of the SUD-M domain were broadened beyond detection at the contour levels shown in Fig. S2 , whereas those of SUD-C were nearly unaffected. For GGGAGGGAGG-binding with SUD-MC a similar pattern of linebroadening was observed at a 1:1 RNA: protein ratio, and both (GGA) 4 and GGGAGGGAGG caused precipitation when added to SUD-M. Eventually, chemical shift perturbations in SUD-MC and SUD-M were measurable only for (GGA) 4 at a 0.2:1 RNA: protein ratio, where the binding of (GGA) 4 involves the same surface residues (Fig. S2c and d) as previously observed for A 10 -binding (Fig. 9a) . In all of these experiments, SUD-C domain NMR signals showed neither sizeable chemical shift perturbations nor linebroadening ( Fig. S2a-c, e) . We speculate that this indicates the formation of high-molecularweight aggregates characterized by binding of the SUD-M domain to RNA, with the NMR signals of the flexibly linked SUD-C domains only minimally affected by this process. These aggregates would involve multiple SUD-MC proteins binding via their SUD-M domains to the same RNA. Similar to the conclusions from the data in Figs. 6-8, in this interpretation the SUD-C domain would again appear to regulate specificity of SUD-MC for RNA-binding without direct contacts to the ligand, which may be physiologically important in directing the protein only to certain viral or host cell RNA sequences. Alternatively, chemical exchange between free SUD-MC and a 1:1 complex with the RNA in the intermediate rate regime on the chemical shift time scale could also lead to line broadening, but in this situation one would expect that the line broadening is limited to binding-site residues rather than affecting the entire SUD-M domain.",

Since the fifth globular domain of nsp3, nsp3e, which is separated from SUD-MC in the nsp3 sequence by a papain-like protease (Fig. 10) , also binds to G-and A-containing RNAs,23 there is also the possibility of longer-range concerted action with SUD-MC in RNA recognition. Physiologically, this increased specificity is likely to be important in directing nsp3 activity to desired RNA sequences; binding to a broader range of RNA sequences, as observed for the isolated SUD-M domain, might affect host cell viability and thus reduce the ability of the virus to replicate.",

SUD-M was previously shown to bind to poly-A RNA, which might relate to a possible function in initiating negative strand synthesis through binding to poly-A tails of the viral genome. 16 It has also been proposed that due to its affinity for G-quadruplexes, SUD-NM could bind to G-quadruplexcontaining host cell mRNAs encoding proteins involved in cellular signaling pathways, which could lead to disruption of the host cell environment and favor viral replication.17 When we tested (GGGA) 5 binding to SUD-MC in KCl buffer, which favors the formation of G-quadruplexes, the binding was much weaker than that in saline buffer (Fig. 7) , which would argue against a G-quadruplex being the actual molecular structure recognized by SUD-MC. We note, however, that several of the G-rich RNA sequences displayed multiple bands on native gels (Figs. 6 and 7) , which may be due to the presence of different secondary structures, suggesting that variable types of folded RNA structure could indeed be recognized or induced by the interaction with the protein. In the following we investigate the occurrence of alternative oligopurine sequences in SARS-CoV genomes that could function as additional SUD-binding sites.",

Of twenty-five G 4 sequences (on both the (+) and (\u2212) strands), eight are conserved in all known SARS-CoV strains; seven of these are in protein-coding regions and one is in the 3'-untranslated region. Of these eight conserved G 4 sequences, all but one are unique to the SARS-CoV, and if these sequences were indeed physiologically relevant substrates for the SUD-MC, this would be consistent with the finding that the SUD is unique to SARS-CoV. An additional search for the GGGAGGGAGG sequence in the SARS-CoV Tor2 genome did not result in an exact hit, but we found three nucleotide segments that differed only by one base: the nucleotides (nt) 1461-1470 on the (+) strand in the nsp2 coding region have the sequence 5'-GGGAGGUAGG-3', nt 12723-12732 on the (+) strand in the nsp12 coding region is 5'-GGGAGGUAGG-3', and nt 25383-25392 on the (\u2212) strand is 5'-GGGAGUGAGG-3'. The two sequences on the (+) strand are highly conserved, with nt 1461-1470 being found in all known SARS-CoV strains, and with nt 12723-12732 showing only one point mutation. In contrast, the sequence on the (\u2212) strand is not highly conserved among SARS strains.

The residues with \u0394\u03b4 \u2265 0.03 (data plotted in magenta in Fig. 8d ) are colored magenta, and are labeled. In the panels c to e, the orientation of SUD-C is related to that of Fig. 1 by a rotation of approximately 90 degrees about a horizontal axis in the projection plane. b SUD-M and SUD-C domains within the SUD-MC construct. Structure calculations were performed for the intact construct of SUD-MC and, since no medium-range or long-range distance constraints between the two domains were observed, also for the two individual domains of residues 527-648 (SUD-M) and 655-720 (SUD-C), using the input measured with SUD-MC. In the table we only list the statistics for the calculations with the individual domains in SUD-MC (PDB codes 2KQV and 2KQW for SUD-M and SUD-C, respectively) since these coincide very closely with the result of a calculation for the intact SUD-MC, as presented by Figs. 2a and b , with backbone RMSDs of 0.23 \u00c5 for SUD-M and 0.21 \u00c5 for SUD-C.",
