We have previously shown that severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus M protein suppresses type I interferon (IFN) production by impeding the formation of functional TRAF3-containing complex. In this study, we demonstrate that the IFN-antagonizing activity is specific to SARS coronavirus M protein and is mediated through its first transmembrane domain (TM1) located at the N terminus. M protein from human coronavirus HKU1 does not inhibit IFN production. Whereas N-linked glycosylation of SARS coronavirus M protein has no influence on IFN antagonism, TM1 is indispensable for the suppression of IFN production. TM1 targets SARS coronavirus M protein and heterologous proteins to the Golgi apparatus, yet Golgi localization is required but not sufficient for IFN antagonism. Mechanistically, TM1 is capable of binding with RIG-I, TRAF3, TBK1 and IKKe, and preventing the interaction of TRAF3 with its downstream effectors. Our work defines the molecular architecture of SARS coronavirus M protein required for suppression of innate antiviral response.",

            "text": "Host cells combat invading viruses by triggering innate immune response. As a counter-defense, viruses encode various immunosuppressive proteins to evade innate immunity. This interaction between host cells and viruses dictates the outcome of viral infection. 1 Coronaviruses are enveloped and positive-stranded RNA viruses with a large genome of ,30 kb. In the family Coronaviridae, there are four genera. In addition to human coronaviruses 229E and NL63 in the genus Alphacoronavirus, four other viruses belonging to the genus Betacoronavirus, namely, human coronavirus OC43, human coronavirus HKU1, 2 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 3, 4 and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus, 5 have also been found to infect human. The concept that human coronaviruses are generally associated with mild respiratory diseases was overturned by the identification in 2003 of SARS coronavirus, which causes a severe and highly lethal disease. 3, 4 Further investigation of the etiology of community-acquired pneumonia in an adult who was hospitalized in Hong Kong during the outbreak of SARS led to the identification of human coronavirus HKU1, 2 which circulates commonly in human population causing respiratory tract illnesses worldwide. [6] [7] [8] Although the mechanism by which SARS coronavirus and the newly identified MERS coronavirus cause severe respiratory diseases is not fully understood, their subversion of innate immunity is thought to contribute substantially to pathogenesis. 4, 9 Type I interferons (IFNs) are major effector cytokines in innate antiviral response. To induce IFN production, pathogen-associated molecular patterns such as viral double-stranded RNA are sensed by host pattern recognition receptors such as endosomal Toll-like receptor 3 and cytoplasmic RIG-I. The activation of these receptors transmits a signal to downstream kinases TBK1 and IKKe that form a functional complex with TRAF3 and TANK. Consequent phosphorylation of IRF3 and IRF7 transcription factors by these kinases leads ultimately to transcriptional activation of IFN promoters. 10, 11 Among the structural proteins encoded by SARS coronavirus, M protein is a glycoprotein with three N-terminal transmembrane domains named TM1, TM2 and TM3. 12 , 13 We have previously reported that SARS coronavirus M protein suppresses type I IFN production potently by preventing the formation of functional TRAF3-TANK-TBK1/IKKe complex. 14 This suppression of innate antiviral response by SARS coronavirus M protein represents one novel viral countermeasure against host innate immunity, which could play a role in SARS pathogenesis. 9 However, it remains to be seen whether M proteins of other coronaviruses, which share 28%-41% identity in aminoacid sequence with SARS coronavirus M protein, might also exhibit IFN-antagonizing activity. Compared to SARS coronavirus, human coronavirus HKU1 is more frequently associated with less severe disease. [6] [7] [8] It will therefore be of interest to determine whether human coronavirus HKU1 M protein would be able to suppress IFN production. On the other hand, the functional domain in SARS coronavirus M protein required and sufficient for IFN antagonism remains elusive.",

In plasmid pISRE-Luc, the expression of luciferase reporter was driven by IFN-stimulated response elements (ISRE), which are activated by type I IFNs and also bound to IRF3 and IRF7 transcription factors. 24, 25 For plasmid pIFNb-Luc, reporter expression directly reflects the transcriptional activity of IFN-b promoter. To activate IFN production, we expressed RIG-I, MDA5, MAVS and TBK1 in HEK293 cells. RIG-I and MDA5 are sensors of viral double-stranded RNA. 11, 15 MAVS is a mitochondrial adaptor protein and TBK1 is the protein kinase that phosphorylates IRF3 and IRF7. 1, 11 These proteins represent three critical steps in the upstream, midstream and downstream of the intracellular signaling pathway that leads to IFN production. All proteins stimulated transcriptional activity driven by ISRE (Figure 1a ",

We next compared M and its mutants M1 and M2 for their ability to circumvent IFN induction by RIG-I and TBK1. Whereas M and M1 exhibited IFNantagonizing activity of similar potency, M2 was unable to suppress IFN-b promoter activity (Figure 4b and c) . Hence, the TMs are required for the suppressive effect of SARS coronavirus M protein on type I IFN production. We further investigated which of the three TMs is required for IFN antagonism. Because the single TM was unstable and secreted out when expressed alone in cultured HEK293 cells (data not shown), we conjugated it to the endodomain, which was shown to be dispensable for IFN antagonism (Figure 4 ).",

SARS coronavirus is known to suppress innate antiviral response at multiple levels leading to a severe disease. 4, 9 This might be similar to the emerging MERS coronavirus. 30, 31 In contrast, human coronavirus HKU1 is commonly found in human population and is associated with less severe respiratory illnesses. 6-8 Accordingly, it might not have the same ability to evade innate immunity. Viral proteins are not well characterized and IFN-antagonizing proteins have not been identified in human coronavirus HKU1. 32 It remains to be seen whether the distinct properties of M proteins in the suppression of IFN production could account at least partly for the severity of disease caused by SARS coronavirus and human coronavirus HKU1.",

To test this idea, the coronaviruses in the two groups should be compared more thoroughly for their abilities to induce IFNs and to suppress IFN production and action. Particularly, the IFN-antagonizing property of M proteins from more coronaviruses should be assessed in parallel. Although attempts have been made to culture the virus in primary human ciliated airway epithelial cells and type II alveolar epithelial cells, [34] [35] [36] clinical isolates of human coronavirus HKU1 remain unculturable in most laboratories. This hampers further comparative study in cultured cells. To remedy this, the dynamics of IFN induction should be analyzed in human subjects naturally infected with human coronavirus HKU1.",

Although TM1 alone is unstable and secreted out, it is stable and functional when conjugated to TM2-TM3 or endodomain of SARS coronavirus M protein or of human coronavirus M protein (data not shown). TM1 contains the critical determinants for Golgi localization, for association with RIG-I, TRAF3, TBK1 and IKKe, and for prevention of TRAF3 from interacting with TANK, TBK1 and IKKe. Our results are compatible with the notion that TM1 targets SARS coronavirus M protein and its associated cellular proteins to the Golgi apparatus. It will be of importance to clarify exactly how this might contribute to the suppression of IRF3 activation.",

Hence, Golgi localization and interaction with TRAF3 are required but not sufficient for IFN antagonism. Mechanistically, the perturbation of the interaction of TRAF3 with TANK, TBK1 and IKKe by TM1 of SARS coronavirus M protein is more critical in the suppression of IRF3 activation. This could plausibly be mediated by preoccupation and steric hindrance, but further investigations are required to provide additional support to this model. For example, it will be of interest to see whether artificial fusion of TM1 to TRAF3 might impede its binding with TBK1 and IKKe or inhibit its activation of IFN production. Mapping and comparing the TM1-and TBK1-interacting domains in TRAF3 would also shed light on how the binding of TRAF3 with TM1 affects the binding with TBK1. More importantly, a thorough comparison of the TM1 regions of SARS coronavirus and human coronavirus HKU1 will define the critical residues for the suppression of TRAF3 interaction with downstream transducers. Nevertheless, this model of suppression by sequestration and pre-occupation represents a new mechanism for immune evasion, which might also be used by other viral and cellular proteins such as microtubule-associated TRAF3-binding protein MIP-T3, which localizes to the centrosome and cilia and also impedes the formation of functional TRAF3-containing complex. 37 Furthermore, our definition of a small TM1 domain that mediates immune evasion will pave the way for rational design and development of new immunosuppressive Cells were then stained for M and TRAF3.

Consistent with our previous findings, 14 SARS coronavirus M protein suppressed the stimulatory effect of RIG-I, MDA5, MAVS and TBK1 on ISRE and IFN-b promoter (Figure 1a-h). In stark contrast, human coronavirus HKU1 M protein had no influence on the activity of RIG-I, MDA5, MAVS or TBK1(Figure 1a-h). Consistently, when we measured the steady-state levels of IFN-b transcript in transfected HEK293 cells by real-time RT-PCR, M protein of SARS coronavirus, but not of human coronavirus HKU1, inhibited the IFN-inducing activity of RIG-I, MDA5 and TBK1 in a dose-dependent fashion(Figure 1i-k).
