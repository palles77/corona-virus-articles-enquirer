This may have been aided by bay's slightly narcotic qualities. Thus bay leaves are said to aid with psychic powers, particularly prophetic dreams, clairvoyance, protection, healing, purification, strength, wishes, magic, exorcism, divination, visions, inspiration, wisdom, meditation, defense, and accessing the creative world. Israelite society consider the bay leaf as a symbol of victory over misfortune; they were very impressed by this tree. Ancient Mediterraneans said this tree radiates protective power and prevents them from misfortune, so it is planted near houses to keep lightning away. The Romans and Greeks used this as a head band mainly for their respected citizens, poets, heroes, and priests, and they consider sleeping with bay leaves to make a man a poet. Romans also believed that this tree protects from lightning, so Emperor Tiberius always kept a bay leaf hat because he had a fear of thunderstorms; and from witches and wizards. The French sometimes call bay the \"berries of bay,\" and they crowned intelligent people with its berries and leaves, which are burned to increase the psychic powers and protect from evil and negativity. Chinese have a belief that to remove evil messes and crossed conditions, bay leaf with washed water can be used. Many people kept them in mojo bags to prevent unwanted interference from people.",

Bay can also be an important ingredient in teas, oils, cheeses, and liquors, and its essential oil is used in the cosmetic industry for soaps, perfumes, prepared foods, beverages, and dental products. Bay has many traditional medical uses. Leaves are used for the treatment of skin rashes, earaches, and rheumatism. The leaves have aromatic fragrance, so they are kept in cloths and used to cover up bad mouth odor. The leaves of this plant, having a pepper odor and clove-like taste, are used in cooking. In addition to cooking, leaves and bark are used in treatment of rheumatism, nausea, vomiting, fever, anemia, body odor, diarrhea, and colic due to having astringent, aromatic, stimulant, and carminative qualities. Seeds mixed with honey or sugars are used in cough and dysentery in children.",

Antioxidants such as vitamin C, vitamin E, and carotenoids are used in many dietary sources and are used to lower blood cholesterol and uric acid level. Bay leaves have many sesquiterpene lactones that are responsible for inhibition of NO production, i.e., antiinflammatory, inhibition of alcohol absorption, and may improve liver glutathione S-transferase activity (Fang et al., 2005) . Using bioassay-directed isolation study, different cytotoxic and apoptosis-induced compounds are identified in bay leaf. Many components of essential oil of bay leaf such as eugenol, methyl eugenol, and pinene have anticonvulsant activity, while eugenol, methyl eugenol, and cineole produce sedation and motor impairment (Sayyah et al., 2002) . Essential oil of this leaf also has analgesic and many antiinflammatory activities (Barla et al., 2007) . Many polar compounds such as flavones, flavonol, and phenols are present in the methanolic extract of bay leaf and show antioxidative activity.",

It is used with warm water for drinking to treat internal ailments; as a result, excess water is removed by body by urination and acts as an emetic to induce vomiting. Fresh, mature leaves are used to treat blood dysentery, inflammation, and congestion of kidney. Bay leaf is also used to treat arthritis, headache, fungal diseases, anorexia, colds, cataracts, diarrhea, colic ulcer, appetizer, neuralgia, and digestive stimulant traditionally (Parthasarathy et al., 2008) . Bay is found effective against many infections from fungi, viruses, bacteria, and protozoa. Bay is also helpful in inhibiting growth of carcinogenic cells. The leaves of bay are specific for many fevers, cough, flu, bronchitis, asthma, influenza, cough, cold, lowering blood cholesterol level, chicken pox, diarrhea, and antistress agents. Bay juice is an effective medication for sore eyes and night blindness, which is generally caused by deficit of vitamin A.
