            "text": "Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), and porcine group A rotavirus (PRV-A) are major viruses causing enteric diseases of piglets. A multiplex nested reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (multiplex nested RT-PCR) was developed for the detection of these viruses in field samples from piglets with diarrhea. A mixture of (1) three external pairs of primers, yielding in the amplification step two different amplicons with sizes of 950 bp and 317 bp and (2) three pairs of internal primers in a second round of PCR (nested PCR), yielding two different amplicons with sizes of 792 bp and 208 bp for TGEV and porcine PRV-A, respectively. The genome of PEDV was not detected after the amplification step but it was detected in the second round of PCR, yielding amplicon with size of 291 bp. Multiplex nested RT-PCR can detect TGEV, PRV-A, and PEDV up to concentration 10 2 TCID 50 /mL, 10 1 TCID 50 /mL, and 27.2 g/l of RNA, respectively. A total of 175 field samples were collected from swine with diarrhea from January 2005 until July 2007. The samples were tested for the presence of three viruses by a multiplex nested RT-PCR. Dual infections with PEDV and PRV-A were identified in seven specimens (4%) (n = 6). Twenty-one (25%) infections were caused by PEDV and thirty-four infections (41%) were caused by PRV-A. The genome of TGEV was not detected in any of these field samples, however TGEV was detected in piglets infected experimentally. The multiplex nested RT-PCR is rapid, sensitive, and a cost-effective detection method for the detection of porcine enteric viruses.",

            "text": "Acute infectious diarrhea is a major cause of high morbidity and mortality in piglets. Group A rotaviruses (PRV-A), transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) are recognized as the principal viruses causing gastroenteritis in piglets. PEDV and TGEV are members of the Coronaviridae family and cause watery diarrhea, dehydration, and high mortality in suckling pigs. Rotaviruses, members of the Reoviridae family, are the most common cause of porcine gastroenteritis. The TGEV, PEDV, and PRV-A infections are difficult to differentiate clinically (Cavanagh, 1997; Pensaert, 1999; Saif and Wesley, 1999) ; these viruses cause enteritis in swine of all ages, and are fatal frequently in neonatal piglets, resulting in serious economic loss. They induce similar clinical signs and lesions: destroy villous enterocytes and cause villous atrophy in the small intestine, resulting in profuse diarrhea and vomiting. Hence, it is important to develop an effective and rapid method for their differential detection (Rod\u00e1k et al., 2004) . The development of duplex RT-PCR, either classical or quantitative, for the detection of porcine enteric viruses has been described by many investigators (Kim et al., 2000 (Kim et al., , 2001 (Kim et al., , 2007 Jung and Chae, 2005) . Although these methods may contribute to differential detection of two given viruses, some of these methods depend on the laboratory facilities. Furthermore, real time PCR is a cost-effective assay for routine research. Song et al. (2006) described the development of a multiplex RT-PCR for rapid differential detection of PEDV, TGEV, and PRV-A using pairs of specific primers published previously (Kim et al., 2001; Elschner et al., 2002) which may be useful for routine diagnosis.",

As a result of the high homology between the two virus genome sequences, the deletion region of the S gene of TGEV, which is absent in the PRCV genome, was targeted in this study. The M gene was used as a suitable target for the development of specific primers for the detection of PEDV. The nucleotide sequences of all the eleven genome segments of PRV-A were analyzed. The NSP5 gene, which is the most conservative gene among PRV-A strains and isolates, was therefore used for the development of group-specific primers. Based on the sequence data generated, and the results of BLAST analysis, six primers for each target virus were designed and synthesized. These primers were used in the RT-PCR in different combinations. The nucleotide sequences of the primers used for the multiplex nested RT-PCR, and the expected size of the amplified DNA fragments are shown in Table 1 .",

To this RNA solution, a mixture of reagents consisting of 5 L of AMV 5\u00d7 buffer (Promega, Washington, USA) (50 mM Tris-HCl, 75 mM KCl, 3 mM MgCl 2 ); 1 mM of each deoxyribonucleotide triphosphate (dNTP) (Fermentas, Vilnius, Lithuania); 10 M of each primer S1, S2, P1, P2, M1, and M2; 1.25 U of AMV reverse transcriptase (Promega, Washington, USA); and bidistilled water was added to make up a total volume of 25 L. The mixture was incubated at 42 \u2022 C for 40 min. The cDNA (DNA copy) was either stored at \u221220 \u2022 C or amplified immediately. Two PCR assays were carried out. The first PCR (cDNA amplification) was carried out using primers S1, S2, P1, P2, M1, and M2. The second PCR (re-amplification step) was a nested PCR and conducted using the internal primers S3, S4, P3, P4, M3, and M4 (Sintol, Moscow, Russia). The PCR mixture contained 2.5 L of 10\u00d7 Taq DNA polymerase buffer (SibEnzyme Ltd, Novosibirsk, Russia); 3 mM of MgCl 2 ; 200 M each of dGTP, dATP, dTTP, and dCTP; 5 M of each primer; and 1.25 L of Taq DNA polymerase (SibEnzyme Ltd, Novosibirsk, Russia). Deionized water was added to make up a total volume of 25 L. The amplification step was carried out using the following thermal cycles: the denaturation step at 94 \u2022 C for 4 min was followed by 40 cycles of the amplification step (denaturation at 94 \u2022 C for 1 min, annealing at 60 \u2022 C for 1 min, and extension at 72 \u2022 C for 1 min), a final extension step at 72 \u2022 C for 5 min, and then the tubes were held at +4 \u2022 C. The product of the first reaction (2 L) was used as a template for the reaction of the re-amplification, which was carried out using the following thermal cycles: the denaturation step at 94 \u2022 C for 4 min followed by 30 cycles of the amplification step (denaturation at 94 \u2022 C for 30 s, annealing at 60 \u2022 C for 30 s, and extension at 72 \u2022 C for 1 min), a final extension step at 72 \u2022 C for 5 min. PCR products were resolved by gel electrophoresis in 2% agarose gel in TBE (Tris-boric acid-EDTA) buffer, stained by ethidium bromide (Sigma, NY, USA). The product of the RT-PCRR was visualized using a UV transilluminator. Gel images were recorded digitally with the Gel Doc 2000 system (Bio-Rad Laboratories, NY, USA) (Fig. 1) .

To determine the detection limit of the nested RT-PCR assay, 10-fold serial dilutions of PEDV isolate from the first passage were used. After the RNA extraction and DNase treatment in RNase free microcentrifuge tube, the absorbance of the diluted RNA sample was measured at 260 and 280 nm with a dilution factor 10. The concentration of the nucleic acid is calculated using the Beer-Lambert law, which predicts a linear change in absorbance with concentration (RNA OD = 1 40 g/mL extinction coefficient = 0.025).

The multiplex nested RT-PCR was applied in this study to facilitate surveillance of PEDV replication in cell culture. ; South Korea) can be used as a rapid method for the detection of gastroenteritis infections in farms and in the laboratory but the results need to be confirmed and characterized further by RT-PCR and other available methods depending on the labora-tory facilities. Nucleotide sequencing of the amplified fragment of the PEDV M gene showed three nucleotide substitutions. Phylogenetic analysis classified the PEDV isolates detected in one cluster (cluster A). According to the results of this study these substitutions can be considered as biomarkers for Russian PEDV isolates but this approach needs to be investigated further. Coronaviruses adapt rapidly to changing ecological circumstances by the high mutation rate of their RNA genome (about 10 4 nucleotide substitution/site/year) and the high recombination frequencies (Sanchez et al., 1992) . The genetic variability and the emergence of new coronavirus strains which can infect new host species and cause emerging diseases with or without possible zoonotic risk are not rare phenomena as was shown for other human and animal coronaviruses (TGEV and the attenuated strain PRCV, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), human coronavirus OC43, and bovine coronavirus) (Vijgen et al., 2005) . In addition, the genomes of canine and feline coronaviruses can recombine in vivo and develop into different biotypes that are transmissible serially in a new host species (Herrewegh et al., 1998) .",

The use of specific laboratory methods for the detection and the characterization of porcine enteric viruses such as RT-PCR and chromatographic immunoassay could contribute to such mission. ",
