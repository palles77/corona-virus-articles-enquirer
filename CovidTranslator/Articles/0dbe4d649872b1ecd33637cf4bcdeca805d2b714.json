            "text": "Glioblastoma is a kind of malignant tumour and originates from the central nervous system. In the last century, some researchers and clinician have noticed that the psychosocial and neurocognitive functioning of patients with malignant gliomas can be impaired. Many clinical studies have demonstrated that part of patients, adults or children, diagnosed with glioblastoma will suffer from cognitive deficiency during their clinical course, especially in long-term survivors. Many nanoparticles (NPs) can inhibit the biological functions of tumours by modulating tumour-associated inflammation, which provokes angiogenesis and tumour growth. As one of the best antiviral nanoparticles (AVNPs), AVNP2 is the 2nd generation of AVNP2 that have been conjugated to graphite-graphene for improving physiochemical performance and reducing toxicity. AVNP2 inactivates viruses, such as the H1N1 and H5N1influenza viruses and even the SARS coronavirus, while it inhibits bacteria, such as MRSA and E. coli. As antimicrobials, nanoparticles are considered to be one of the vectors for the administration of therapeutic compounds. Yet, little is known about their potential functionalities and toxicities to the neurotoxic effects of cancer. Herein, we explored the functionality of AVNP2 on inhibiting C6 in glioma-bearing rats. The novel object-recognition test and open-field test showed that AVNP2 significantly improved the neurobehaviour affected by C6 glioma. AVNP2 also alleviated the decline of long-term potentiation (LTP) and the decreased density of dendritic spines in the CA1 region induced by C6. Western blot assay and immunofluorescence staining showed that the expressions of synaptic-related proteins (PSD-95 and SYP) were increased, and these findings were in accordance with the results mentioned above. It revealed that the sizes of tumours in C6 glioma-bearing rats were smaller after treatment with AVNP2. The decreased expression of inflammatory factors (IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1) by Western blotting assay and ELISA, angiogenesis protein (VEGF) by Western blotting assay and other related proteins (BDNF, NF-\u0138B, iNOS and COX-2) by Western blotting assay in peritumour tissue indicated that AVNP2 could control tumour-associated inflammation, thus efficiently ameliorating the local inflammatory condition and, to some extent, inhibiting angiogenesis in C6-bearing rats. In conclusion, https://doi.equally contributed to this study.",

            "text": "Glioblastoma (GBM), a kind of tumour originating from neural stem cells, glial progenitors and astrocytes in the central nervous system, is the most malignant subtype of glioma (Zong et al., 2012; Ohgaki and Kleihues, 2005) . It has attracted the attention of researchers all over the world for its highly aggressive characteristics, high recurrence rate and high mortality (Graus et al., 2013; Tanaka et al., 2013) . At present, surgery combined with radiotherapy and chemotherapy is the most common treatment strategy in clinic (Stupp et al., 2017; Okada et al., 2017) . However, the tolerance of tumour cells to therapy makes some residual lesions regrow, so the outcomes have not been satisfactory (Stupp et al., 2009) . Furthermore, it has been found that cognitive impairment is one of the most important clinical symptoms and complications of craniocerebral disease in both patients and animal models with gliomas (Solanki et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2011; Weitzner and Meyers, 1997; Van Dyk and Ganz, 2019) . Cognitive function occupies an essential position in predicting the prognosis of glioma patients and may even be the first indicator of tumour recurrence after treatment (Crossen et al., 1994; Janelsins et al., 2011; Vecht et al., 2017; Jacob et al., 2018) . In addition, metabolic disorders and tumour regeneration may have a negative impact on cognitive function (Williams et al., 2015; Quant et al., 2009) . The cognitive impairment caused by the side effects of radiotherapy and chemotherapeutic drugs is prone to the whole cerebral hemisphere (Froklage et al., 2014; Hilverda et al., 2010) . Thus, it is important to create some new therapies and develop some new drugs to repair patients' cognitive impairment.",

They aggregate in and around glioma tissue and participate in the proliferation and invasion of tumour cells (Noy and Pollard, 2014; Wu and Watabe, 2017) . There exists a positive correlation between the level of inflammatory cytokines inside the tumour micro-environment (TME) and the poor clinical prognosis of patients (Sorensen et al., 2018) . Modulating the local inflammatory response has become a new strategy for immunotherapy due to its vital role in the development of tumours (Graf et al., 2002; Mineharu et al., 2011) . Proinflammatory cytokines, including interleukin-6 (IL)-6, IL-1\u03b2 and tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF)-\u03b1 that promote tumour proliferation and migration and NF-\u0138B pathway play important roles in this process (Mostofa et al., 2017; McFarland et al., 2013; Myung et al., 2010) . Therefore, drugs and related therapies devoted to modulating peri-tumour inflammation in the treatment of glioblastoma have massive potential both now and in the future.",

In particular, terahertz (THz) imaging as one of the candidate technologies for medical imaging has attracted great attention in recent years due to its properties of fingerprint spectrum, safety, and water sensitivity. The research on THz biological imaging has been used in various medical fields, such as dermatology and oncology (Sim et al., 2013; Woodward et al., 2003; Reid et al., 2011; Park et al., 2017) . In the field of neurosurgery, investigations of gliomas using THz spectrum and THz reflection imaging have also been reported for post-processed, fresh ex vivo and in vivo brain tissues (Park et al., 2017; Oh et al., 2014; Meng et al., 2014; Wu et al., 2019) . However, reflection imaging is always affected by diffusive reflections because of the uneven surface of the sample. Attenuated total reflection (ATR) can provide information on the interaction between the sample and evanescent waves traveling along a prism's surface. Thus, ATR imaging can obtain the precise absorption information of the tissue without inevitable noises.",

With increasing studies on the application of nanomaterials in the immunotherapy of tumours, a great deal of reports have been published suggesting that nanomaterials can inhibit TAMs to detain the release of related inflammatory factors to achieve the inhibition of tumour growth (Ovais et al., 2019; Gong et al., 2019; Reichel et al., 2019) .

In the training stage, the exploration ratio among the groups showed no statistically significant difference (Fig. 5b , F = 1.107, P = 0.3566 > 0.05). In the testing stage, we calculated the RI (the formula: RI = T2/(T1 + T2)). There was a statistically significant difference between the four groups by two-way ANOVA test (Fig. 5c F = 11 .72, P = 0.0001 < 0.001). Then, through multiple comparisons test, we found that there was a statistically significant difference between the Sham group and C6 group (Fig. 5c , F = 0.3533, P = 0.0026 < 0.01). Specifically, the rats of the C6 group had some defects with memory and learning ability as compared to the Sham group. Moreover, after treatment with AVNP2, the RIs of rats in the C6 + AVNP2 group were obviously increased (Fig. 5c , F = \u22120.4475, P = 0.0001 < 0.001). There was no statistically significant difference between the Sham group and Sham + AVNP2 group (Fig. 5c , F = 0.04924, P = 0.5769 > 0.05), which meant that this drug had no side-effects with regard to the cognitive function of rats. We also calculated the DIs of the four groups. There was a statistically significant difference between the Sham group and C6 group (Fig. 5d , F = 0.7067, P = 0.0026 < 0.01). Meanwhile, there was no statistically significantly difference between the Sham group and Sham + AVNP2 group (Fig. 5d , F = 0.09849, P = 0.5769 > 0.05), which corresponded to the results for the RIs. The distance travelled and velocity of movement showed no difference among the four groups (Fig. 5e , F = 1.298, P = 0.3026 > 0.05; Fig. 5g , F = 1.298, P = 0.3026 > 0.05).

Brain, Behavior, and Immunity xxx (xxxx) xxx-xxx results showed that the level of phosphorylated NF-\u0138B p65 was apparently different among the four groups (Fig. 10b , F = 15.54, P = 0.0011 < 0.01). The LSD analysis showed that the level of phosphorylated NF-\u0138B p65 was up-regulated in the C6 group as compared with the Sham group (Fig. 10b , F = 8.177, P = 0.0027 < 0.01), while this level was down-regulated in the C6 + AVNP2 group (Fig. 10b , F = 4.175, P = 0.0026 < 0.01). There was no statistically significant difference between the Sham group and Sham + AVNP2 group (Fig. 10b , F = 1.151, P = 0.0950 > 0.05). Besides, one-way ANOVA analysis showed that there was an apparent difference in the levels of IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1 and BDNF between the four groups ( Fig. 10c , F = 7.631, P = 0.0099 < 0.01; Fig. 10d , F = 9.894, P = 0.0046 < 0.01; Fig. 10e , F = 16.07, P = 0.0009 < 0.001; Fig. 10f , F = 7.139, P = 0.0119 < 0.05). AVNP2 administration decreased the level of neuro-inflammation in peri-tumour tissue in C6 + AVNP2 group compared to that of C6 group (Fig. 10c , F = 36.14, P = 0.0022 < 0.01.

These results tentatively reminded us that AVNP2 administration may down-regulate the neuro-inflammatory response by suppressing the NF-\u0138B pathway. Furthermore, it may improve the level of cognition. Moreover, we tested the expression of VEGF (Fig. 10g) , which represented the level of angiogenesis in the peri-tumour tissue of the brains of rats. We found that the C6 group had a higher level expression of VEGF as compared to The graph shows the statistic difference between sham group and C6 group, *P < 0.05; C6 group and C6 + AVNP2 group, *P < 0.05.

The ELISA results showed the level of IL-1\u03b2 was statistically significant different among the four groups (Fig. 11d , F = 4.761, P = 0.0207 < 0.05), but there were no statistically significant differences for IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 among the four groups ( Fig. 11e and f ; F = 2.655, P = 0.0754 > 0.05; F = 3.120, P = 0.0663 > 0.05, respectively). The LSD analysis showed that the level of IL-1\u03b2 was increased in the C6 group as compared with the Sham group in the prefrontal lobe (Fig. 11d, F = 9 .747, P = 0.013 < 0.05) and decreased in the C6 + AVNP2 group in the prefrontal lobe (Fig. 11d , F = 8.102, P = 0.025 < 0.05).",

An unoptimistic prognosis still exists for even after receiving systematic treatment, with a 5-year survival rate of 5% (Ostrom et al., 2015) . The resistance of glioma cells to chemotherapeutic drugs makes it much harder for doctors to control the progression of the tumour. Thus, it is vital for researchers to create new drugs or drug delivery systems to destroy the tumour cells (Saalik et al., 2019) . Due to their integrated good physical and chemical properties, NPs have attracted the attention of researchers. In our research, we chose AVNP2 as an anti-inflammatory drug in C6 model rats. , 2018) . However, the underlying mechanisms in NP therapy, especially the change of tumour-associated inflammation inside the tumour environment and peri-tumour tissue, haven't been explained clearly (Ovais et al., 2019) . We wanted to investigate whether AVNP2 had a similar effect on gliomas. This time, we found that AVNP2 could not only modulate the tumour associated inflammation but also the levels of inflammation-related proteins such as IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1 and NF-\u0138B, which all together play an indispensable role in the formation, growth, infiltration and metastasis of gliomas (Zhu et al., 2017) .",

In our study, we tested the level of inflammation-related proteins in peri-tumour tissue using the Western blotting assay and ELISA test, which could be used as a detection marker for treatment. We found the expression in the C6 group was higher than in the normal control group. However, AVNP2 decreased them in the C6 + AVNP2 group and promoted a better TME.

They have been claimed by considerable studies to be inextricably linked with glioblastoma (Myung et al., 2010; D'Alessandris et al., 2015) . They affected the genesis of glioma and enhanced multifaceted biological capabilities by promoting angiogenesis and prognosis (Hara and Okayasu, 2004) . Western blotting assay of COX-2, iNOS and VEGF did not totally prove the anti-angiogenesis function of AVNP2 on gliomas but gave us a hint, which needs to be investigated deeper by means of ELISA and the tubule formation test in vivo and in vitro (Chen et al., 2016) . The activation or suppression of endothelial cells (ECs), which play an important part in tumour angiogenesis, are worthy of study and discussion too (Liu et al., 2018) . In our experiment, results corresponded to the inflammation-related proteins mentioned before. With the administration of AVNP2, the levels of them were subdued in peri-tumor tissue. The down-regulation of inflammation-related proteins in peri-tumour tissue may be the reason for inhibition of TAMs by AVNP2, which are recruited by gliomas. However, it couldn't function as a protector in humans and secretes inflammatory cytokines to promote tumour cell proliferation inversely (Yang et al., 2017) . Hwang JS et al. considered that IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, iNOS and COX-2 were glioma-secreted soluble factors that could stimulate the activation of TAMs (Hwang et al., 2016) .",

            "text": "Up to now, the TME, especially tumour associated inflammation and the interaction between tumour cell and immune cells is not very clear. It is universally accepted that glioma-secreted soluble factors and TME-secreted soluble factors all take part in the formation of the TME, and promote the proliferation of tumour cells (Barkal et al., 2019) . What has been mentioned is that much research has focused on the micro-environment inside the glioma itself (Thorsson et al., 2018; Platten et al., 2018) . However, peri-tumour inflammation is worth observing too, which happens in the normal brain region and directly influences normal brain function. Many years ago, some researchers and clinicians found patients diagnosed with cancer would suffer from psychiatric disorders, especially brain tumours. At the time, psychiatric disorders were partly blamed on the \"paraneoplastic syndrome\" (Benros et al., 2009; Dalton et al., 2009) . Paraneoplastic syndromes are referred to as symptom complexes that occur in patients with cancer that cannot be readily explained by local or distant spread of the tumour. Nowadays, with a deeper understanding of the biological characteristics of gliomas, researchers have found that the interaction between gliomas and nerve cells was much more complex than we thought before. Tumour-derived factors, such as IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1, could implicate the hippocampus, prefrontal lobe and other brain regions (Walker Ii et al., 2017; Yang et al., 2014) , and tumours could even form \"synaptic-like\" connections with nerve cells (Barria, 2019; Venkatesh et al., 2019) . All these couldn't be explained just by the physical effect (i.e., mass effect of the brain tumour), but the biological effect (i.e., complex molecular interaction between the brain and tumour cells). Researchers have explored the relationship between tumours and cognition, and tumour-associated inflammation has attracted great interest. The pro-inflammatory and inflammatory factors, such as IL-6, IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1, secreted by gliomas play a vital role in the implication that brain functional structures directly cause psychiatric disorders. In brief, the Fig. 11 . The effects of AVNP2 administration on pro-inflammation-related protein measured by ELISA test. The ELISA test showed that the levels of IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 from brain tissue around glioma and prefrontal lobe of rats of C6 group were increased significantly compared with all other groups (Fig. 11a -c, **P < 0.01, ****P < 0.0001), no significant difference was found between Sham group and Sham + AVNP2 group (Fig. 11a -c, P > 0.05). The level of IL-1\u03b2 from prefrontal lobe of rats of C6 group was increased significantly compared with all other groups ( Fig. 11d *P < 0.05), no significant difference was found between Sham group and Sham + AVNP2 group (Fig. 11d , P > 0.05). The levels of IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 from prefrontal lobe of rats showed no statistical difference among four groups (Fig. 11e , f P > 0.05). Data are expressed as mean \u00b1 SEM, n = 4 per group, *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ****P < 0.0001. inflammation in the tumour associated environment has crucial effects on tumour proliferation and growth, as well as the normal functions of the brain. The better the inflammation is, the better the outcome (Fig. 13) .",

Next, we measured the tumour volume of gliomas in C6 model rats (Braganhol et al., 2009) . The volume obviously decreased after treatment with AVNP2, which proved that AVNP2 could indeed inhibit the growth of the tumour through modulation of the micro-environment. Many researchers have found that the tumour growth could be decreased by modulating inflammation (Ferrandon et al., 2015) , which was also confirmed by our results. Besides, we obtained THz ATR to help us to define the margin of gliomas with imaging of freshly excised brain tissues with and without tumours at 2.52 THz. We chose it because THz ATR intensity imaging could be employed as a complementary technique, allowing surgeons to determine tumour regions with a label-free and diagnostic imaging method in real time. It has more important clinical significance than H&E staining (Reid et al., 2011; Parrott et al., 2011; Ji et al., 2016) .",

Immunofluorescence staining test showed the protein intensity of PSD-95 (Fig. 12a ) & SYP (Fig. 12b) across Sham, Sham + AVNP2, C6 and C6 + AVNP2 groups in cerebral cortex region. Images of immunofluorescence staining of PSD-95 [1:1000] (red) and SYP [1:1000] (red) with DAPI (blue) in Sham (Fig. 12c(1-6) ), Sham + AVNP2 (Fig. 12d(1-6) ), C6 (Fig. 12e (1-6)) and C6 + AVNP2 (Fig. 12f(1-6) ) group. Quantitative intensity measurement showed a tendency of decrease in PSD-95 (*P < 0.05) and SYP (*P < 0.05) signal in C6 group compared with Sham group (Fig. 12a, b) , and the reductions were removed in PSD-95 (*P < 0.05) and SYP (*P < 0.05) with AVNP2 administration in C6 + AVNP2 group (Fig. 12a, b) . Data are expressed as mean \u00b1 SEM, n = 4 per group, *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01. Fig. 13 . Pattern diagram showed the multiple impacts of AVNP2 on C6 glioma model rats. Arrow (1) indicated that the research went from macro-into microdimensions and Arrow (4) indicated that the research went from micro-into macro-dimensions. The double sided Arrow (2) showed that glioma could induce inflammation by releasing pro-inflammation cytokines in peri-tumour tissues, and the pro-inflammation cytokines could promote glioma proliferation in return. Arrow (3) indicated that these cytokines could damage synaptic function. Arrow (5) indicated that AVNP2 could suppress the level of pro-inflammation cytokines and protects against cognitive impairment. of related signalling pathways promote cognitive impairment in patients with brain tumours (Mostofa et al., 2017) .",

Walker et al. found that cancer-induced systematic inflammation played an important role in cognitive impairment (Walker et al., 2018) . The brain tumour induced inflammation, especially in the peri-tumour brain region, has resemblances with these. In this study, we suppressed the inflammation induced by gliomas, so we inferred that the cognition level of C6-bearing rats can be improved by AVNP2 administration. We implemented several of the following approaches: neuro-related proteins, staining of dendritic spines, electrophysiology tests and behavioural experiments, from the micro-to the macro-level, to evaluate the cognition level all-around.",

Inflammation could decrease the levels of SYP and PSD-95 (Yang et al., 2018) (Zong et al., 2012) , but few have gone deeper into the tumour-induced inflammation. Hao et al found that C6 gliomas could lead to down-regulation of SYP, but no significant difference was found in the expression of PSD-95 (Hao et al., 2018) . However, in our experiment, SYP and PSD-95 were both down-regulated in C6-bearing rats by the Western blotting assay and immunofluorescence staining test respectively, while the AVNP2 could reverse this by suppressing the pro-inflammation cytokines level, which were confirmed by Western blotting assay and ELISA test respectively. We considered that the different results happened because of the different experimental design. In Hao's experiment, the interval between C6 cell xenograft with tumour specimen collection was five days, however, in our experiment, the interval was eight days. We could reasonably assume that SYP is more sensitive to damage from inflammation than PSD-95. As shown in the immunofluorescence staining test, the degree of decrease with SYP was larger than PSD-95, and this was correlated with results of Western blotting. These synaptic plasticity-related molecules explained the improvement of neurocognitive and learningmemory function in rats with gliomas on the micro-level, which indicated that AVNP2 could inhibit the biological functions of gliomas by inhibiting inflammation and angiogenesis, thus enhancing the cognitive levels of GBM model rats.",

Firstly, in our experiment, the results apparently showed that AVNP2 could increase dendritic spine density in the hippocampus and further enhance the learning-memory ability of glioma model rats. Secondly, we confirmed the improved inflammation reaction in the same local tissue. Inflammation induces oedema and local hypertension, all if which could damage the dendritic spines. Decades ago, researchers found significant pathological changes in peritumour brain tissue, such as swollen dendrites, disarray of microtubules and decreased dendritic spine density. However, due to incomprehension of the neuro-immune system, no one had related these to tumour associated inflammation in local tissue (Spacek, 1987) . This time, we inferred that AVNP2 improved cognitive function on a histological level (indirectly) by suppressing the tumour-associated inflammation in local areas.

The negative effect, tumour associated inflammation, on LTP was apparently impeded by the administration of AVNP2, which suggested that synaptic plasticity was remarkably enhanced in the hippocampus after modulating the level of tumour associated inflammation. In a word, the synaptic function of the hippocampus was significantly improved after treatment with AVNP2 in glioma model rats. What's more, the C6-bearing rats performed better than rats without proper treatment in both the OFT and the NORT, which indicated the cognitive impairment caused by gliomas was ameliorated by AVNP2 on a behavioural test level.",
