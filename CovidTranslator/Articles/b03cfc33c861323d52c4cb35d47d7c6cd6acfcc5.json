Only alpha and beta coronavirus are of interest for human and clinical virologists 7 . Based on epidemiological data before 2019, only six CoVs proved to cause human respiratory diseases: i) HKU1, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-229E only lead to mild upper respiratory disease, but rarely bring about severe diseases in people; ii) SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV attack lower respiratory tract and always induce severe respiratory syndrome. Sequence analysis shows that 2019-nCoV has a typical genome structure of coronavirus and belongs to the cluster of beta coronaviruses that includes SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and it forms a clade within the subgenus Sarbecovirus, Orthocoronavirinae subfamily. It has been the seventh member of the family of coronaviruses that infect humans so far 8 .",

Major initial symptoms include fever, most of which are high fevers that occur within several days and are not alleviated by routine anti-infective drugs, additionally coughing, headache and muscle pain or fatigue 15 . Other clinical symptoms observed at low frequency include elevated troponin levels, diarrhea, myalgia and myocarditis 15 . It should be emphasized that some asymptomatic patient are diagnosed as 2019-nCoV 16 , so the presence of asymptomatic carriers requires due attention. Nearly 20% of the patients appeared comorbidities with regard to the dysfunction of other organs, primarily renal impairment and patients with underlying cardiovascular diseases often demonstrated comorbid heart failure 13 . They gradually develop initial symptoms in the cardiovascular system, digestive system, and nervous system, which increased the difficulty of diagnosis 15 . The median interval from the start of initial symptoms to significant symptom aggravation like dyspnea or appearance of acute respiratory distress syndrome is 7 days, ranging from 1 day to 20 days, which was consistent with previous reports 13 . According to the newly released pneumonitis diagnosis and treatment plan for new coronavirus infection, severe patients often have dyspnea and/or hypoxemia one week after the onset of the illness. Serious cases can quickly progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock, irreformable metabolic acidosis, coagulopathy and multiple organ failure. Nearly 80% of the patients have normal or decreased white blood cell counts, and 72.3% hav lymphocytopenia 15 . Lung involvement was present in all cases 17, 18 , with most chest computed tomography (CT) scans showing lesions in multiple lung lobes, some of which are dense. Ground-glass opacity co-existed with consolidation shadows or cord-like shadows are observed. Since respiratory supports are administered to most of the patients, oxygen saturation can be maintained at above 90% as indicated by pulse oximetry monitoring 15 . It is reported that severe and critically ill patients have moderate to low fever, even without obvious fever. Mild patients show just low fever, mild fatigue, and no pneumonia. Judging from the current cases, most patients have a good prognosis but poor for the elderly and those with chronic underlying disease. Symptoms in children are relatively mild.",

In vitro experiments, it's shown that Ribavirin inhibits replication of MERS-CoV and HCoV-OC43, but the dosage that produces significant effects is not within the range of typical human therapies 59 . Using interferon simultaneously can reduce the dose of Ribavirin 60 . In a primate model, the clinical symptoms of MERS could be improved by the combination of Ribavirin and type I interferon 61 . However, the side effects of ribavirin, such as anemia, limit its widespread use 62 . In addition, two meta-analyses of SARS and MERS case studies exhibited limited efficacy in treating patients with coronavirus respiratory syndrome 63, 64 . Therefore, further studies are needed to determine whether ribavirin can effectively treat novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID- 19) , and Ribavirin and interferon are still in clinical trials (ChiCT R2000029387).",

In order to find the theoretical reasons to support this method for preventing viral infection of 2019-nCoV, Fan et al. 85 make discussions based on colloid and interface science pure and point out that sesame oil has a low surface tension and it is incompatible with water 86 . They investigate the epidemiological features of 2019-nCoV and find because of the low intermolecular attraction between adjacent two sesame oil molecules, the pure sesame oil has a good wettability which can readily wet the surface of various solid and aqueous phases. In view of this feature, the sesame oil might prevent the spread of 2019-nCoV. Unfortunately, the mechanism of this method remains uncertain and it is not 24 approved and verified by experimental and clinical studies. In the future, scientists need to pay more scientific attention to these potential useful clues from the folk medical methods.",

The causative agent of the unidentified pneumonia had been confirmed as a novel coronavirus by sequencing and etiological investigations by several independent laboratories in China. After the isolation of the new coronavirus, it was found to be distinct from both MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV 1,2 .

The phylogenetic tree shows that 2019-nCoV clustered with Bat SARS-like Coronavirus sequence isolated in 2015 while The Fast Unconstrained Bayesian Approximation (FUBAR) analysis reveals mutation in Spike Glycoprotein and nucleocapsid protein. Therefore 2019-nCoV probably transmits from bats or other hosts from where it gets the ability to infect humans. Ramaiah et al. 10 speculate the novel virus closely relates to bat-CoV, which reminds us this 2019-nCoV strain might be evolved from the bat-CoV by accumulating favorable genetic changes for human infection. Epitopes in 2019-nCoV structural proteins are differentially recognized by HLA-DR alleles, which suggests that a subunit of vaccine including the 8 immunodominant HLA-DR epitopes can induce effective antiviral immune responses in various populations. Paraskevis et al. 11 find the 2019-nCoV closely resembles bat-CoV RaTG13 sequence throughout the genome (similarity 96.3%). The latter does not provide the exact variant that caused the outbreak in humans, but the hypothesis that 2019-nCoV has originated from bats is possible. Xu et al. 12 also report that the 2019-nCoV shares with the SARS/SARS-like coronaviruses a common ancestor that relates to the bat coronavirus HKU9-1. They conclude that the 2019-nCoV S protein and SARS-CoV S protein share an almost identical 3-D structure in the RBD domain, thus maintaining similar van der 9 Waals and electrostatic properties in the interaction interface of human ACE2 molecules despite the sequence diversity\u3002 Although many scientists believe that bats are intermediate hosts, most species of bats live in tropical or subtropical rain forests and caves far from the population, the probability of bats transmitting the virus directly to humans is not enough. It is generally known that bats may deliver the viruses to intermediate hosts such as wild animals or livestock, then the viruses are transmitted to humans by these intermediate hosts. Ji et al. 13 carry out using relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) bias among different animal species. The result suggests that the 2019-nCoV appears to be a recombinant virus between the bat coronavirus and an origin-unknown coronavirus. They analyze that snake is a most probable wildlife animal reservoir, but the conclusion is controversial. Guo et al. 14 introduces the VHP (Virus Host Prediction) to dig out the potential hosts of viruses by deep learning algorithm and predicts bat coronaviruses are assigned with more similar infectivity patterns with 2019-nCoV. The consequences illustrate that bat and mink may be two candidate reservoirs of 2019-nCoV. Tsan-Yuk Lam et al. 12 identify pangolin associated CoVs belonging to two sub-lineages of 2019-nCoV related coronaviruses include one closely resemble 2019-nCoV in the receptor-binding domain by metagenomic sequencing.

Zhang et al. 19 find ACE2 is highly expressed in type II alveolar epithelial cells, esophageal epithelium, stratified epithelial cells, even in absorptive intestinal epithelial cells from ileum and colon. Their study of bioinformatics analysis with single-cell transcriptomes suggests that the digestive tract may serve as an infection pathway for 2019-nCoV.

Two sequence regions (ORF1b and N) designed based on the first public access sequence in Genbank are selected for primer and probe designs, which are highly conserved amongst Sarbecoviruses. In detecting positive clinical specimens, the N gene assay is about 10 times more sensitive than the ORF-1b gene assay24 . The existing PCR methods have very good specificity but low sensitivity, which means that the negative test results cannot exclude the presence of 2019-nCoV in patients. Moreover, the laboratory sample contamination caused by the lack of control can lead to the false positive results. Additionally, RT-PCR tests may be falsely negative due to insufficient viral materials or operational error. Some patients with negative results of RT-PCR may present with positive chest CT findings for 2019-nCoV, which means PCR results can assist clinical diagnosis and evaluation but the possibility of disease cannot be confirmed or ruled out. For individuals with high clinical suspicion but 14 negative RT-PCR screening, a combination of CT scanning and repeated swab tests may be helpful 25 . SHERLOCK technique The CRISPR-based SHERLOCK (Specific High Sensitivity Enzymatic Reporter UnLOCKing) technique, termed specific high-sensitivity enzymatic reporter unlocking , allows portable, multiplexed, and ultra-sensitive detection of RNA or DNA from clinically relevant samples. SHERLOCK assays are set up with recombinase-mediated polymerase pre-amplification of DNA or RNA and subsequent Cas13or Cas12-mediated detection via colorimetric readouts and fluorescence that provide results in less than 1 h with a setup time of less than 15 min 26 . Based on the RNA sequence of the New Coronavirus, the researchers carefully designed two guide RNAs, one that recognizes the S gene of the new coronavirus, and the other that recognizes the Orf1ab gene. In order to maximize the accuracy of the detection, scientists have selected the sequences that are most specific for the new coronavirus. In this way, interference from other respiratory virus genomes can also be minimized. Theoretically, as long as the RNA corresponds to the new coronavirus in the sample, the guide RNA can accurately recognize it and activate the Cas13a protein to bind to it. Cas13a is a very interesting enzyme, once activated, it will indiscriminately and insanely cut any other RNA molecules it encounters. In this way, by confirming whether these molecules have been cut off, it can detect the present of the new coronavirus in the original sample. They consistently detect COVID-19 target sequences in a range between 20 and 200 aM (10-100 copies per microliter of input) by using synthetic COVID-19 virus RNA fragments.

Importantly, the homology modelling revealed that the receptor-binding domain structure of 2019-nCoV is similar to that of SARS-CoV 21 . From the previous reports, the interaction with Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) is responsible for SARS-CoV entering human cells 27,28 . Dong et al. 29 compare the structural similarity of the protein ACE2 in various viruses and speculate that the 2019-nCoV could most likely use the same receptor as SARS-CoV. Zhou et al. 30 conduct virus infectivity studies using Hela cells with or without ACE2 proteins obtained from humans or animals and find that 2019-nCoV can invade all ACE2 protein-expressing cells but the cells from mouse. In short, 2019-nCoV uses ACE2 as an entry receptor in the ACE2-expressing cells, but not cells without ACE2, and 2019-nCoV is likely to bind to ACE2 receptor in humans just like SARS-CoV. Dimitrov et al. 31 reported that SARS-CoV infects the host cells in human by a basic interaction of its S glycoprotein and the receptor ACE2 on human cells. Though the sequence of 2019-nCoV is a little different from the SARS-CoV, its functionally important ORFs and major structural proteins especiallythe Spike protein are well annotated, of which the original identity is 76% 32 .

Chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2) is an important cytokine in Spike-ACE2 signaling pathway. CCL2 is a CC chemokine and it attracts memory T lymphocytes, monocytes and basophils. The receptor of CCL2 is CCR2, both of which are involved in inflammatory reaction35 , therefore they are associated with some lung inflammatory disorders. Referring to previous reports, the patients who infect SARS-CoV would have pulmonary fibrosis which is responsible to CCL2. Cheung et al.36 take an experiment to observe the expression of CCL2 in SARS-CoV patients and they find the expression of CCL2 is upregulation in the sera of patients. To work out the relationship between Spike-ACE2 signaling pathway and CCL2, Chen et al.37 get a conclusion and showed it in Fig 2 showing the interaction between S protein of SARS-CoV with ACE2 on the human cells. The infected lung epithelial cells induce casein kinase II (CK II) which is able to phosphorylate ACE2 and involves ERK1/2 activation. CK II phosphorylates ACE2 at Ser-787, by which SARS-CoV binds to its ACE2 receptor and causes the conformational change of ACE2. It also activates the ACE2 downstream signal transduction pathways including ERK1/2 and AP-1 38 . The change will lead to the activation of ERK1/2 and AP-1 and upregulates CCL2. ACE2 also participates in an intracellular signaling pathway. It activates ERK1/2 via interacting with upstream factors such as Ras, and PKC. In the end, the elevated level of CCL2 protein in the sera of SARS-CoV-infected patients accounts for the development of lung fibrosis. 6. Therapeutic target 2019-nCoV is characterized by strong contagion, high morbidity and high mortality, but no specific drugs of 2019-nCoV have been developed so far. Many researchers are trying to find the therapeutic targets of the virus to work out high-efficiency and low toxicity targeted drugs. A number of epidemiological studies have shown that the transmission characteristics of 2019-nCoV appear to be a similar of SARS 39-42 . The series of similarities give doctors and scientists a clue to look for targeted drugs. Although coronaviruses are subject to extensive mutations, some key proteins, particularly replication-related enzymes, are highly conserved 2 , so the drugs that target conserved proteases are usually able to block replication and proliferation of the virus and exhibit a broad spectrum 22 . Specific inhibitors of key proteases involved in viral replication and proliferation are effective ways of killing viruses. Candidate compounds include RNA proteases, membrane proteins, spike glycoproteins, polymerases, and viral envelope that act directly on the virus, as well as targets on the host, such as receptors and proteases for virus entry and endocytosis 24,43,44 . Recently, scientists screen out 4 small molecule drugs (Prulifloxacin, Tegobuvir, Nelfinavir and Bictegravir) with strong binding ability to the main protease of SARS-CoV 22 .

Since 2019-nCoV and MERS-CoV possess similar structure belonging to the coronavirus 2,8 , Remdesivir has a great potential of anti-2019-nCoV. As reported, the first case of new coronavirus pneumonia treated in the United States only received supportive treatment for nausea, vomiting and other symptoms at the initial stage of admission, while the patient's symptoms improved significantly after beinggiven the intravenous injection of Remdesivir for one day45 . However, Remdesivir has not 20 approved listed in any country, its safety and effectiveness must be confirmed. Thus , two randomized, controlled, double blind Phase III trials have been addressed in February 2020 (NCT04252664 and NCT04257656).",

Zhou et al. 2 report that ACE2 is the receptor of 2019-nCoV through cell experiments: 2019-nCoV could bind ACE2 receptors of civet, bat, pig and human origin, and cannot infect cells without ACE2. Therefore, the application of ACEI and AT1R inhibitors under the condition of close monitoring of blood pressure is likely to reduce the body damage in patients with 2019-nCoV infection 80 . Xuebijing is a traditional Chinese medicine injection commonly used to treat inflammation in severe cases. A randomized controlled trial shows that on the basis of western medicine treatment, xuebijing injection could significantly reduce the fatality rate of community acquired pneumonia 81 .",
