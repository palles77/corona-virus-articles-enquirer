            "text": "The stability of non-viral vectors during freeze-drying has been well-studied, and it has been established that sugars can protect lipoplexes during freeze-drying. However low levels of damage are often observed after freeze-drying, and this damage is more evident in dilute lipoplex preparations. By investigating the stability of lipoplexes after each step in the freeze-drying cycle (i.e., freezing, primary drying, and secondary drying) we strive to understand the mechanisms responsible for damage and identify improved stabilization strategies. N-(1-(2,3dioleoyloxy)propyl)-N,N,N-trimethylammonium chloride (DOTAP)-cholesterol/plasmid DNA lipoplexes were prepared at an equimolar DOTAP to cholesterol ratio, and a 3-to-1 DOTAP + to DNA \u2212 charge ratio. Our experiments indicate that despite sufficient levels of \"stabilizing\" sugars, significant damage is still evident when dilute lipoplex preparations are subjected to freeze-drying. Analysis of the different stages of freeze-drying suggests that significant damage occurs during freezing, and that sugars have a limited capacity to protect against this freezing-induced damage. Similar effects have been observed in studies with proteins, and surfactants have been employed in protein formulations to protect against surface-induced damage, e.g., at the ice crystal, solid, air or sugar glass surfaces. However, the use of surfactants in a lipid-based formulation is inherently risky due to the potential for altering/solubilizing the lipid delivery vehicle. Our data indicate that judicious use of surfactants can reduce surface-induced damage, and result in better preservation of lipoplex size and transfection activity after freeze-drying.",

This damage could be minimized by increasing the amount of sugar used in the formulation, however subsequent studies have pointed out the need to reduce sugar levels in order to achieve isotonic formulations (upon rehydration) with injection volumes compatible with intramuscular or subcutaneous administration. 22 Thus, it would be beneficial if vectors could be formulated to reduce freezing-induced damage, and thereby minimize the need for employing high sugar levels to obtain stability during freeze-drying.",

As proposed by Allison et al.,17 sugars exert their protective effect by increasing the volume of the non-ice (i.e., supercooled liquid or glass) fraction in which the particles are suspended, thereby increasing the distance between adjacent particles and reducing aggregation. More recent studies are in agreement with this model, and have shown that temperature-dependent diffusion of non-viral vectors through the unfrozen sugar-water matrix is ultimately responsible for aggregation during the freezing step of lyophilization.15 It follows that the ratio of sugar to particle number (as reflected by sugar/ DNA weight ratio) has a predominant effect on the distance between particles, and thus the potential for aggregation in the frozen state. To this end, it has been reported that sucrose/ DNA weight ratios of 500 are sufficient to prevent aggregation when vector suspensions are frozen at 40-160 \u03bcg DNA/ml.17 However, Allison et al.17 also observed that freezing of more dilute suspensions (8 \u03bcg DNA/ml) required a higher sucrose/DNA ratio (1000) to avoid aggregation. This observation suggested that factors other than particle diffusion play a role in freezing damage, and the authors suggested that the larger amount of ice crystal surface (due to the lower sucrose concentration) may play a role in the increased sensitivity to freezing observed with more dilute vector suspensions.",

The results show that maintenance of particle size was dependent on both sucrose/DNA ratio and vector concentration. More specifically, the most dilute vector preparations (in terms of DNA concentration) required higher sucrose/DNA ratios, consistent with previous studies.17 Additional experiments utilized BET measurements to determine the specific surface area (SSA) as a function of the initial sucrose and DNA concentration (before lyophilization).

This observation suggests that the mechanism responsible for freezing-induced damage can be minimized by formulating lipoplexes with sufficient quantities of sugar. Since the amount of ice formed upon freezing to a given temperature is determined by the initial sugar concentration (assuming that the initial liquid volume is constant), these results implicate ice formation in the increased sensitivity to freezing and freeze-drying observed with more dilute vector preparations. It should be recognized that the process of freezing and the degree of supercooling can vary from vial-to-vial and experiment-to-experiment, and thus the precise conditions that result in statistically-significant aggregation may result in slight inconsistencies from experiment to experiment. For example, the data in figure 1A shows more variable sizes recovered after freezing at a sucrose: DNA ratio of 500 which resulted in a significant increase in particle size, whereas figure 2 depicts maintenance of a more consistent particle sizes under these conditions.",

The goal of our initial experiments was simply to identify surfactants that would not perturb lipoplex suspensions. Considering that electrostatic interactions between the cationic lipid and negatively-charged DNA are responsible for lipoplex formation, our study avoided the use of ionic surfactants. Our initial investigation involved incubation of lipoplexes for 30 minutes in solutions of five non-ionic surfactants (Triton X-100, Pluronic F68, Pluronic F108, Tween 80, and octyl glucoside) at concentrations ranging from 0 to 1 mM. Our results showed that Triton X-100, Pluronic F68, and Pluronic F108 caused a concentrationdependent increase in lipoplex size even at very low surfactant concentrations (data not shown). In contrast, lipoplex suspensions incubated in solutions of Tween 80 and octyl glucoside retained their particle size up to relatively high concentrations (60 \u03bcM for Tween 80; 100 \u03bcM for octyl glucoside). From these results, we concluded that lipoplexes were minimally affected by the presence of these two surfactants (at least up to the concentrations mentioned above), and additional experiments were conducted to explore their potential for protecting lipoplexes from interface-induced damage during freezing and drying.",

As mentioned above, studies with proteins have also used this strategy to protect against interface-induced damage. 30 , 31 Additional experiments were performed to determine if significant stress was imparted during the rehydration process as compared to freeze-drying. These experiments involved slowly rehydrating dried samples with water vapor, but this treatment only served to exacerbate aggregation (data not shown). Further experiments were conducted by rehydrating dried samples with a Tween 80 solution, and this definitely improved recovery of particle size (Fig. 6 ). As shown above, complete protection was observed when Tween 80 was present during both lyophilization and rehydration. However, samples lacking Tween 80 during lyophilization but that were rehydrated with surfactant solutions exhibited smaller particle size (Fig. 6) . These provocative findings suggest that significant damage to lyophilized nonviral vectors may occur during the rehydration process; an aspect that is not generally considered.

            "text": "This work clearly demonstrates that lipoplexes are subjected to stresses that cause aggregation during each step of the lyophilization process. In some cases, aggregation and loss of transfection are observed only in formulations with low DNA concentrations. As reported in previous studies, formulation with sucrose can attenuate this damage, and full recovery is typically observed when high DNA concentrations are employed. Our data suggest that a small, undetected fraction of lipoplexes aggregate even under these conditions, and this damage is difficult to avoid during secondary drying, i.e., sufficient quantities of sucrose alone cannot prevent low levels of damage during freezing and primary drying. The observed aggregation and loss of transfection activity can be minimized by including Tween 80 in the formulation, indicating that surface-induced effects are responsible for the observed damage. Furthermore, the fact that rehydration of samples with Tween 80 solutions improves recovery even when samples are dried in the absence of surfactant suggests that stresses due to rehydration alone can cause aggregation. Although this study was not able to elucidate the precise mechanism of rehydration-induced damage, our data clearly show that inclusion of Tween 80 in lipoplex formulations results in reduced aggregation and improved biological activity upon rehydration.
