These proteins play important roles in various biological processes mediated by interactions with their partners. However, very little is known about the interactions among these accessory proteins. Here, a EYFP (enhanced yellow fluorescent protein) bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assay was used to detect the interactions among accessory proteins. 33 out of 81 interactions were identified by BiFC, much more than that identified by the yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) system. This is the first report describing direct visualization of interactions among accessory proteins of SARS-CoV. These findings attest to the general applicability of the BiFC system for the verification of protein-protein interactions.",

The downstream ORFs encode the structural proteins in the following order: spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N). In addition to these two groups of proteins, there is another group including accessory proteins (3a, 3b, 6, 7a, 7b, 8a, 8b, 9b and ORF14) varying in length from 39 to 274 amino acids (aa) and with no significant sequence homology to proteins in other coronaviruses 1, 2 .

For example, the 3a protein can interact with structural proteins like S, M and N proteins, and another accessory protein 7a in SARS-CoV infected cells; the resulting multiple complexes may be inferred to be important for viral assembly 3 . Additionally, the interaction of SARS-CoA protein 6 and another accessory protein 9b was also confirmed to be present in SARS-CoV infected cells 4 . Thus, the identification of the occurrence and components of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) among accessory proteins provided invaluable insights into the cellular functions of these proteins. However, very little is known about other interactions among these accessory proteins 5 . Given that several accessory proteins have been shown to exhibit functions in virus-host interactions during SARS-CoV infection in vivo, it is necessary to understand the putative interactions among accessory proteins 6, 7 .",

Each method has its own advantages and limitations. Co-IP is one of the most commonly used methods for examining PPIs. This technique often requires the preparation of specific antibodies against each of the analyzed proteins, making it an expensive and time-consuming process 12 . Also, Co-IP can be performed using lysates of the cells, which generally prevents the determination of the exact subcellular localization of the interacting proteins 13 . Y2H is another means of assessing whether two single proteins interact. Although used extensively, Y2H suffers from several drawbacks, such as high occurrence of false-positives and the requirement that the interacting proteins accumulate in the cell nucleus 8 . Among these methods, the fluorescent protein-based BiFC is an effective and straightforward tool to study PPIs, enabling direct visualization of the occurrence and subcellular localization of PPIs with simple equipment. Moreover, this approach can avoid the possibility of non-physiological protein interactions caused by cell lysis and mixing the contents of different cellular compartments. Due to its stronger signal and direct readout, this assay has become widely accepted over the past decade 10, 11, 14, 15 .",

The Y2H assay is a widely used method to study PPIs, based on the fact that many eukaryotic transcription factors, such as the yeast enhancer GAL4, are composed of two functionally distinct domains that mediate transcriptional activation domain (AD) and DNA binding domain (BD) respectively. As illustrated in Table 3 , of 81 interactions detected by Y2H, only 3 interactions were indicated to be positive, viz., self-interactions of 9b and ORF14, and interaction of 8a-9b in one direction. Selfinteractions were observed with 9b and ORF14, indicating the formation of dimeric or multimeric complexes in the nucleus, similar to the findings of von Brunn et al. 5 . PPIs of 8a-9b occurred in one direction only when 8a and 9b proteins were separately fused to pGBKT7 and pGADT7, but the opposite was reported by von Brunn et al. 5 . Moreover, the number of protein interactions is inconsistent with the study by von Brunn et al. 5 , who identified 11 interactions among accessory proteins of SARS-CoV. This discrepancy resulted from the selection method used. The interactions were identified mainly using the selective plates, which can result in false positive results. Moreover, of 13 interactions detected by Y2H, only 4 were corroborated by Co-IP, which further implied the detection of false positive interactions by Y2H. In the present investigation, more comprehensive selection methods were applied to characterize the interactions. Besides selective plates, colony PCR, quantitative \u03b2-galactosidase and \u03b1-galactosidase assays were used to validate the interaction among accessory proteins, which improve the reliability of Y2H.",

In principle, the BiFC assay can be used to detect interactions in any subcellular compartment in any aerobically growing organism or cell that can be genetically modified to express the fusion proteins 24 . BiFC, hence, can detect interactions not observed with Y2H. In the present study, 33 out of 81 interactions were visualized by BiFC. Only one Y2H interaction, namely self-interaction of 9b, was confirmed by BiFC. The self-interaction of 9b was also reported by von Brunn et al. 5 . The findings of the self-interaction of 9b identified by BiFC, coupled with the absence of nuclear localization signal (NLS) of 9b imply that the self-interactions also occur in the extranuclear domain. The conclusion that the 9b protein is retained in both the intra-and extra-nuclear domains is consistent with the paper by Sharma et al. 25 . In this report, the authors demonstrated that 9b protein can enter the nucleus by passive transport, though 9b was known to localize in the extra-nuclear region 25 .",
