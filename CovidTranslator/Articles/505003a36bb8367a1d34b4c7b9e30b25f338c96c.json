However, they have not been described in the dog. The aim of this study was to document the HBPs of canine seminal plasma. Six pooled samples of seminal plasma from three crossbred dogs were used. The HBPs were isolated by heparin affinity chromatography and the fractions recovered were pooled. One-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) was carried out on 12 and 18% vertical minigels. The stained gels were scanned and the molecular weight (kDa) values for each band within a lane were calculated by image analysis software. The electrophoresis analysis of the pooled eluded fractions identified 19 bands, with molecular weights varying from 61.5 to 5.2 kDa. Previous studies, using one-dimensional SDS-PAGE, identified two bands (67 and 58.6 kDa), which were positively correlated with some semen parameters (sperm motility, sperm vigor, percentage of morphologically normal sperm and plasma membrane integrity). The 61.5 kDa band detected in the present study apparently corresponded to the 58.6 kDa band identified previously. Canine seminal plasma contained HBP; since HBP modulate the acrosome reaction in other species, they may have the same function in the dog. Further studies are necessary to better characterize this protein and determine if it is associated with fertility in the dog. #",

This capability to bind is attributed to the presence of seminal plasma proteins, which are attached to the sperm surface after ejaculation, leading to modulation of the acrosomal reaction by zona pellucida (ZP) glycoproteins [1] . Heparin-binding proteins (HBP) have been identified in several species, e.g. bovine [2] , equine [3, 4] and swine [5] . In dogs, the high degree of affinity between arginine esterase from seminal plasma and an equine HBP (SSP-7) has been described [6] . The objective of this study was to separate the HBPs from canine seminal plasma using heparin affinity chromatography. ",

Seminal plasma was separated from spermatozoa by centrifugation at 4200 \u00c2 g for 1 h at 4 8C (MLW, K23, Engelsdorf, Leipzig, Germany). The heparin-binding proteins were isolated by heparin affinity chromatography (\u00c4 kta TM Oligopilot, Amersham Biosciences) as described by Man\u00e1skov\u00e1 et al. [7] and modified as follows: the pooled seminal plasma (0.5 mL) was added to a heparin affinity chromatography column (16 mm \u00c2 26 mm, 1.0 mL/min) and equilibrated with PBS. Non-adsorbed proteins were washed out with PBS and bound proteins were eluded with 1 M NaCl. The data and graphics of the separated proteins in the chromatography were plotted by specialized software (UNICORN TM , Amersham Bios-ciences). The recovered heparin-binding protein fractions were pooled. One-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) 12 and 18% were performed in vertical minigels (Mini VE 1 , Amersham Biosciences), as described by de Souza [8] . The gels were stained with silver nitrate, scanned (Image VDS, Amersham Biosciences) and molecular weight (kDa) values for each band within a lane were calculated with image analysis software (Image Master 1 , Amersham Biosciences). Fig. 1 shows the graphic image plotted on the heparin affinity chromatography. The electrophoresis analysis of the pooled eluded fractions identified 19 bands in two gel concentrations (12 and 18%), with molecular weights ranging from 61.5 to 5.2 kDa (Fig. 2) . These bands are represented by the highest curve of Fig. 1 , whereas the lowest curve ( Fig. 1) represents proteins not bound to heparin.",

Although approximately 50% of the canine seminal proteins bound to heparin, they represented the highest curve in the graphic image plotted on the heparin affinity chromatography, probably due to the great quantity of arginine esterase present in this fraction. This protein has a molecular weight of 30 kDa and, upon denaturating conditions, it forms two subunits: H and L, 15 and 12-14 kDa, respectively [13, 14] . Despite recent advancement in our knowledge of the biochemistry of this constituent [15] [16] [17] , its biological function still remains a matter of speculation.",

Characterization of seminal plasma proteins and studying their binding properties will be the first step in understanding their role in the fertilization process [20] . Since the HBPs were associated with fertility due to their modulatory role during the acrosomal reaction [1] , their identification in the dog provides information that improves the understanding of physiological processes in this species. Moreover, the identification of such proteins in seminal plasma could provide better insight into the nature of subfertility or infertility in the dog, as well as enhance cryopreservation strategies. Further studies are needed to characterize these proteins and to elucidate their role in canine fertilization.",
