We aimed to document the viral and bacterial aetiology of pharyngitis and to assess the pathogenic role of viruses by determining the myxovirus resistance protein A (MxA) in the blood as a marker of interferon response. Methods: In this prospective observational study, throat swabs and blood samples were collected from children (age 1e16 years) presenting to the emergency department with febrile pharyngitis. Microbial cause was sought by bacterial culture, polymerase chain reaction, and serology. Blood MxA level was determined. Results: A potential pathogen was detected in 88% of 83 patients: GAS alone in 10%, GAS and viruses in 13%, group C or G streptococci alone in 2% and together with viruses in 3%, and viruses alone in 59% of cases. Enteroviruses, rhinoviruses, and adenoviruses were the most Introduction Acute pharyngitis accounts for a substantial portion of visits to physicians in outpatient setting. 1e4 Group A streptococcus (GAS) is the only common bacterial cause of pharyngitis justifying antimicrobial treatment according to current guidelines. 5, 6 However, overuse of antibiotics for pharyngitis occurs both in children and adults. 7e10 Non-GAS pharyngitis is suggested to be mainly a viral infection, 11e13 but only a few comprehensive studies have evaluated the microbiological aetiology of the disease in the paediatric population. 14e18 There is a lack of studies addressing the viral aetiology of pharyngitis in children and adolescents by molecular diagnostic methods.",

It has been suggested that M. pneumoniae is a major pharyngitis pathogen in children. 15 In our study, the detection rate of M. pneumoniae IgM antibodies was 12%. However, considering the duration of the patients' symptoms, the presence of other potential pathogens, the presence of IgG antibodies, and the missing titre changes in the paired sera, the clinical significance of M. pneumoniae IgM antibody findings remain unclear. Respiratory viruses can be detected by PCR in many asymptomatic individuals as well, and therefore, their role as etiologic agents can be argued. 21, 22, 33 We and others have shown earlier that a MxA response is strongly associated with a symptomatic viral infection. 32, 34 Indeed, in the present study, most patients with virus findings had elevated levels of MxA protein in their blood. In contrast, at the follow-up visit when the patients were asymptomatic or had only minor, non-febrile respiratory symptoms, their blood MxA levels remained low. Our finding suggests that at the enrolment they had a true, symptomatic virus infection rather than coincidental virus detection. Still, all but one patient with febrile pharyngitis positive for group A, C, or G b-haemolytic streptococci without virus detection demonstrated no MxA response.

MxA could not discriminate between a GAS and non-GAS aetiology of pharyngitis, mainly because streptococcal and viral co-infection induced an MxA response comparable to that of virus infection. Because GAS can be detected relatively easily in throat swabs, there is probably no clinical need for a biomarker in the routine diagnostics of GAS pharyngitis. Here, we studied the biomarkers primarily to assess the pathogenic role of detected viruses or bacteria, not to evaluate their performance in differential diagnostics in clinical practice.

Several different ED physicians carried out the preliminary recruitment of the patients, which could have influenced the diagnostic accuracy of pharyngitis.

Furthermore, we could possibly have increased the detection rate of viruses by collecting also nasopharyngeal swab samples. 41, 42 Our rationale for sole oropharyngeal sampling was that we were investigating pharyngeal infection and that nasopharyngeal sampling might have increased the detection of viruses with a questionable role in causing pharyngeal symptoms.",
