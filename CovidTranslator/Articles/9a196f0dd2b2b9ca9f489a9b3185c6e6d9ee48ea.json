Studies on early membrane permeabilization give clues about processes underlying entry of animal viruses into cells; understanding gained on the modification by viral proteins of membrane permeability during virus replication indicates that membrane leakiness is required for efficient virus release from infected cells (or virus budding, in the case of enveloped viruses). In addition, the activity of these membrane-active virus proteins may be related to virus interference with host cell metabolism and with the cytopathic effect that develops after virus infection.",

            "text": "Apart from the interest in studying membrane permeabilization from a basic viewpoint, these studies can also provide novel, useful techniques. For instance, the finding that animal viruses increased membrane permeability to a number of compounds during the late phase of infection provided a new approach to block translation specifically in the infected cells. This selective inhibition of animal virusinfected cells was achieved by means of hydrophilic inhibitors of protein synthesis that do not permeate the membranes of normal cells, but readily penetrate into virus-infected cells (Carrasco, 1978) . The use of nonpermeant translation inhibitors now constitutes a simple assay for changes in the permeability of the plasma membrane (virus induced or not) in both eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells (Carrasco and Vazquez, 1983; Lama and Carrasco, 1992a) . Moreover, the initial finding that animal virus particles induce early membrane permeabilization and promote co-entry of macromolecules such as protein toxins into cells (Fernandez-Puentes and Carrasco, 1980) has been used to introduce plasmids, without size limit, to virtually transform 100% of cells grown in tissue culture (Cotten et al., 1992; Wagner et al., 1992b3. Several years have elapsed since our last review on the permeabilization of cells by animal viruses . Important insights into two main aspects of this area of research have been achieved since then. First, the mechanisms by which early and late membrane permeabilization occurs are now better understood. Second, we are now witnessing the identification of the viral proteins known as viroporins , which are involved in modifying membrane permeability. Studies on viroporins at the molecular level will soon provide details on their mode of action and the exact function they play in the virus replication cycle.",

Either of these pathways implies that the virus particle, the nucleocapsid, or at least the viral genome has to cross a membrane. This is particularly true in the case of viral particles devoid of a lipid envelope, such as poliovirus (Fig. 1) . Following attachment of poliovirus to its receptor on the cell surface, the virus permeabilization to a-sarcin molecules. The virus particle first attaches to a cell surface receptor, followed by endocytosis of virus and toxin molecules. Binding of the virion to the receptor changes its conformation and promotes interaction of viral proteins with the membrane. This interaction promotes virus uncoating and translocation of the genome to the cytoplasm. In addition, the interaction of virus proteins with the membrane leads to the formation of transient pores that dissipate the proton gradient created by the vacuolar proton ATPase, promoting the passage of toxin molecules through the endosomal membrane. particle undergoes profound structural rearrangements (Gomez Yafal et al., 1993) , with the result that VP4, which is found in the interior of the particle, interacts with the cellular membrane (De Sena and Mandel, 19771 , and the amino terminus of VP1, which is also located within the virion, becomes exposed at the surface, ready to interact with the membrane (Fricks and Hogle, 1990) . The interaction of these virion proteins with the membrane may open a pore through which the viral genome is extruded into the cell (Fricks and Hogle, 1990) . This mechanical model of genome translocation across membranes does not take into account the requirement for an energized membrane during virus infection. Thus, the interaction of poliovirus particles with receptors leads to conformational changes in virions (Mason et al., 1993; Gomez Yafal et al., 1993; Haywood, 1994) , but uncoating and RNA release require a metabolically active cell.",

            "text": "Before analyzing the co-entry of toxin moieties with virus particles, it is useful to summarize the process of toxin entry into cells. Several excellent review articles on the entry of toxins into cells have appeared (Olsnes et al., 1988; Wilson and Collier, 1992; FitzGerald and Pastan, 1993; Read and Stein, 19931 , and the reader is referred to these articles for additional information. Diphtheria toxin is one of the intracellularly acting toxins whose action is best understood in molecular terms (Choe et al., 1992; Read and Stein, 1993) . Its mode of entry into cells is briefly summarized here. Trypsinization of diphtheria toxin produces two fragments, A and B; the B polypeptide attaches the toxin to specific receptors present on the cell surface, followed by internalization of the toxin into endosomes (Wilson and Collier, 1992; Naglich et al., 1992) . The acidic environment of endosomes triggers interaction of a hydrophobic protein domain with the membrane, leading to the formation of an ion channel (Zalman and Wisnieski, 1984; Beaumelle et al., 1992) . This event is followed by the translocation of the accompanying fragment A to the cytoplasm (Olsnes et al., 1988; Ariansen et al., 1993) , where it blocks translation (Wilson and Collier, 1992) . It has been proposed that the transmembrane channel formed by fragment B aids fragment A in passing through the membrane, gaining access to the cytoplasm (Kagan et al., 1981) . However, the pore opened by fragment B is about 25 A in diameter, which is incompatible with the A subunit traversing the B channel (Zalman and Wisnieski, 1984) . The transient pores with cation-selective permeability resemble those formed during the entry of animal viruses (see below). Both fragments A and B interact with the membrane. The insertion of diphtheria toxin in the membrane does not suffice for the translocation of fragment A to the cytoplasm. This passage requires energy, provided by the protonmotive force, to push the protein moiety through the membrane (Beaumelle et al., 19921, as occurs for translocation of other proteins across mitochondria1 membranes (Pfanner and Neupert, 1990; Martin et al., 1991) . Energy in the form of ATP may be required to translocate other proteins, such as ricin A chain (Beaumelle et al., 1993) . Therefore, depending on the protein that is translocated across a particular membrane, energy in the form of a pH gradient (Olsnes et al., 1988; Beaumelle et al., 1992) , a membrane electrical potential (Martin et al., 19911, or ATP (Beaumelle et al., 1993; Subramani, 1993) is necessary.",

The majority of animal viruses tested were able to induce this phenomenon, including Semliki Forest virus (SFV), vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), vaccinia virus, adenovirus, and poliovirus (Fernandez-Puentes and Carrasco, 1980; Carrasco, 1981; Carrasco and Esteban, 1982; FitzGerald et al., 1983; Otero and Carrasco, 1987; Lee et al., 1990) , suggesting that the viral particle contains a component that not only promotes the entry of the viral nucleocapsid into the cell, but also translocates other macromolecules that are not physically bound to the particles across the cellular membrane to the cytoplasm (Fig. 1) .",

In addition, the forces that govern early membrane permeabilization by viruses is now better understood thanks to these antibiotics. Bafilomycin A (BFLA) and concanamycins are selective inhibitors of endosomal proton-ATPase (Drose et al., 1993) . BFLA and concanamycin A strongly inhibited the entry of several animal viruses that possess a lipid envelope, such as SFV, VSV, and influenza virus Carrasco, 1993, 1994; Guinea and Carrasco, 1994b,c) . On the other hand, the infectivity of poliovirus was not blocked by BFLA, indicating that poliovirus uncoats and releases its genome by a mechanism that is independent of an acidic environment . We are currently investigating the requirement of membrane potential for poliovirus entry into cells. Because entry of SFV and poliovirus was affected differentially by BFLA, they constituted good models to test the involvement of the proton-ATPase activity in the cointernalization process. Curiously enough, BFLA inhibited the co-entry of a-sarcin promoted by both SFV and poliovirus particles . This result clearly indicates that the exit of a-sarcin from endosomes requires a proton gradient and is coupled to the action of the proton-ATPase. These findings prompted us to suggest that the low-pH requirement previously reported for the entry of some animal viruses could be due to a requirement for a pH gradient, rather than to low pH per se . The pH gradient would provide the energy required in this process, as occurs during the entry of toxins into cells (see Section II,B,l). If so, a virion component would be able to couple the proton gradient to the release of macromolecules from the endosome. Therefore, the mechanism of the co-entry of protein toxins is more specific than previously thought and does not involve the physical rupture of endosomes by animal virus particles; rather the toxin would be translocated across the intact endosomal membrane by an activity present in virion particles  .",

The requirement of a metabolically active cell for delivery of virus genome into the cytoplasm is not rationalized. In addition, these models do not explain the mechanism by which early permeabilization, observed with virus particles, to other macromolecules takes place. We have proposed that the proton-motive force generated in endosomes by the activity of the vacuolar proton-ATPase pump can be used to promote uncoating and to drive the viral genome through the lipid barrier of the membrane . Therefore, the energy accumulated in endosomes is required for the viral nucleocapsid to enter cells. In this model the same route and energy can be used by macromolecules to pass across the membrane and would thus account for the co-entry process. A brief account of the different steps of virus entry according to the protonmotive model, would be as follows:",

The classical low-pH model predicts that a low pH suffices for virus fusion and entry in a mechanistic way, i.e., low pH changes the conformation of a protein that is inserted into the cellular membrane and fusion ensues. The proton-motive model predicts that a pH gradient is required, thus low pH is not sufficient (Guinea and Carrasco, 1994b,c; Perez and Carrasco, 1994) . Moreover, in principle, the pH gradient may not be necessary for entry of those virus species that could use either the membrane potential or the pH gradient. Future studies in this exciting field of virus entry directed to elucidating the exact molecular basis of early membrane permeabilization should decide which of these models is closer to reality.",

Because the work done in this field has been previously reviewed in depth (Carrasco et al., 19891 , the late modifications of the membrane induced by animal virus infection will be briefly summarized and work done in the last few years will be highlighted. One of the most salient characteristics of the late membrane modifications is that they require viral gene expression , suggesting that one or several virus gene products are responsible for these changes. Figure 2 shows the pathway for synthesis and membrane insertion of virus proteins with membrane-active capacity and the postinfection alterations that influence membrane function.",

            "text": "The most common change that occurs in the plasma membrane during infection of a susceptible cell by a cytolytic virus is enhanced permeability to monovalent cations. This effect is obviously accom-panied by a drastic drop in membrane potential (see Fuchs and Kohn, 1983; Carrasco et al., 1989) . Sodium ions that are pumped outside the cell by Na+ ,K+-ATPase readily enter into infected cells, whereas potassium ions that accumulate inside the cell leak out. In the case of picornaviruses or togaviruses these modifications in ion distribution are initially observed 2 to 3 hr after infection (Carrasco and Smith, 1976; Nair et al., 1979; Nair, 1981 Nair, , 1984 Garry et al., 1979; Egberts et al., 1977; Muiioz et al., 1985a; Lacal and Carrasco, 1982; Ulug et al., 1984; Lopez-Rivas et al., 19871, so that the majority of viral macromolecular synthesis takes place in a cytoplasm in which the concentrations of monovalent ions are continuously changing (Munoz et al., 1985b; Carrasco and Castrillo, 1987; Ulug et al., 1987) . Hence, the synthesis of poliovirus or Semliki Forest virus proteins is carried out in a cytoplasm that contains a higher concentration of sodium and a lower concentration of potassium ions compared to uninfected cells. Consequently, viral mRNAs that are translated late during virus infection have adopted special structures that cause them to be optimally translated under these altered conditions (Saborio et al., 1974; Nuss et al., 1975; Carrasco and Smith, 1976; Carrasco et al., 1979) . Hence, the resistance of some viral mRNAs to translational inhibition by high concentrations of sodium ions in the external medium is taken as a reflection of the alterations that take place in ion concentration in the cytoplasm of virus-infected cells. This resistance is a widespread phenomenon observed for the translation of mRNAs from cytolytic animal viruses (Nuss et al., 1975; Saborio et al., 1974; Cherney and Wilhelm, 1979; Garry et al., 1979; Alonso and Carrasco, 1982a; Carrasco et al., 1979; Nair, 1981 Nair, , 1984 Mizzen et al., 1987; Castrillo et al., 1987) . On the other hand, these ionic concentrations are inhibitory for the translation of most cellular mRNAs, although the synthesis of a few cellular proteins, such as the heat-shock proteins, is resistant to such modifications (Munoz et al., 1984; Macejak and Sarnow, 1991) .",

These results contrast with the finding that Sindbis virus infection causes an acidification of about 0.5 pH units in BHK cells (Moore et al., 1988) . A similar decrease in the cytoplasmic pH is observed in MDCK cells infected by influenza virus (Ciampor et al., 199213) . In addition, variations in the pH of cellular compartments in influenza virus-infected cells are thought t o be mediated by the M2 protein (Ciampor et al., 1992a) .

The increased uptake declined at late stages of infection, suggesting mitochondria1 injury by virus infection (Peterhans et al., 1979) . As with poliovirus-infected cells (Lopez-Rivas et al., 1987) , no significant differences were observed in total cellular calcium as determined by radioactive calcium (Peterhans et al., 1979) . Using this technique, Nokata et al. (1987) noted a greater influx of calcium into cytomegalovirus-infected human cells during the initial hours of infection, leading to the suggestion that a viral gene product altered membrane permeability to this cation (Nokta et al., 1987) . The use of fluorescent probes to estimate free cytosolic calcium provides a more accurate method than measurements based on radioactive calcium (Cobbold and Rink, 1987) . The use of both radioactive calcium and fluorescent probes in rotavirus-infected cells clearly indicates that permeability to calcium is drastically altered and the concentration of this cation increases by severalfold in the infected cells (Michaelangeli et al., 1991) . These modifications are clearly apparent from about the fourth hour postinfection and are dependent on virus gene expression (Michelangeli et al., 1991) . The expression of individual rotavirus proteins in insect (Spodoptera frugiperda) cells points to NSP4 expression as the nonstructural glycoprotein responsible for elevating calcium levels during rotavirus infection (Tian et al., 1994) . Influenza virus infection of neutrophils causes a rise in intracellular calcium very early during infection (Hartshorn et al., 1988) . This effect has been related to a functional deactivation of neutrophils by influenza virus infection.",

This is not so, because the normally nonpermeating translation inhibitors totally block viral protein synthesis, indicating that cells actively synthesizing viral proteins lose the permeability barrier to these compounds (Carrasco, 1978; Contreras and Carrasco, 1979) . Still, it is possible that the viral proteins made in leaky cells are useless for the virus, i.e., these proteins will not participate in the formation of virions and are made after the virus progenies have escaped from the cells. This is unlikely, because the inhibition of protein synthesis by hygromycin B, a nonpermeating inhibitor, reduces progeny virus formation by several orders of magnitude (Benedetto et d., 1980; Lacal and Carrasco, 1983) .",

Thus, it is not surprising to find elevated concentrations of divalent cations in the cytoplasm of these cells (see Section 111,A,2). In conclusion, phospholipase C is activated in poliovirus-infected cells, leading to the release of choline to the medium and the formation of high amounts of IP, (Fig. 2) .

In cells infected with other animal viruses there is an increase in choline and arachidonic acid release to the medium, suggesting that in addition to phospholipase C, phospholipase A, is also activated in these systems . Arachidonate metabolism is modified by a number of animal viruses, including orthopoxviruses (Palumbo et al., 1993) , herpesviruses ( AbuBakar et al., 19901, Semliki Forest virus and vesicular stomatitis virus . During the infection of BSC-1 cells by cowpox virus or vaccinia virus there is an enhanced arachidonate product formation from the cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase pathways. Possibly a virus gene product is involved in mediating the alterations of arachidonate metabolism (Palumbo et al., 1993) . These alterations seem to be necessary for orthopoxvirus replication, because inhibitors of lipoxygenase pathway block virus replication (Palumbo and Buller, 1991) . During the infection of HeLa cells with SFV or BHK cells with vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), there is a significant increase in phospholipase C and A, activity. Entry of hygromycin B was prevented by zinc ions or chloroquine, indicating that the increase in membrane permeability in SFV-infected cells may be mediated in part by lipase activation (Perez et aZ., 1993) . Respiratory syncytial virus infection of differentiated U937 cells induces a sustained stimulation of l-O-alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, a potent mediator of inflammation, suggesting that this compound plays an important part in RSV-induced inflammatory response in lungs (Villani et al., 1991) . Even the addition of purified gp120 from HIV-1 to human monocytes results in the activation of the cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase pathways (Wahl et al., 1989) . These results lead to the suggestion that the induction of arachidonic acid metabolites is required for the replication of some animal viruses (Palumbo and Buller, 1991) and may also be important for virus pathogenesis.",

Two consequences may be predicted if these two phospholipases are activated during the course of virus infection: (1) the formation of prostaglandins and (2) the formation of diacylglycerol and lysophosphatidylcholine. These molecules are effectors of many cellular and viral functions (Exton, 1990; Billah, 1993) . In addition, the presence of these phospholipid moieties in the plasma membrane destabilizes the lipid bilayer and enhances membrane permeability (Felix, 1982) . It is not surprising to find that cellular membranes containing embedded pore-forming proteins display increased phospholipase activities. Many membrane-active compounds have a similar effect (Katsu et al., 1989; Young, 1992) . It seems plausible to suggest that poreforming proteins disturb membrane integrity, leading to membrane permeabilization that in turn increases phospholipase activity, which further destabilizes the membrane. The membrane might be permeabilized even in the absence of phospholipase activation, as occurs with phage systems (Hardaway et al., 1975; Young, 1992) . Future studies will define more precisely the role that each of these changes plays in the increased membrane permeabilization induced by animal virus infection.",

Therefore, modification of the vesicular system by animal viruses will not be reviewed here. I will only point out that some animal viruses, such as poliovirus, not only use the vesicular system to transport and sort their proteins, but also to replicate their genomes. The replication of poliovirus genomes takes place in close association with newly made membrane vesicles (Caliguiri and Tamm, 1969, 1970; Semler et al., 1988) . During infection with a number of animal viruses, membrane traffic is profoundly modified in such a way that vesicles of various sizes appear in the cytoplasm. These distinctive structures were termed \"viroplasm\" in the case of poliovirus (Dales et al., 19651 , \"cytopathic vacuoles\" in togaviruses (Acheson and Tamm, 1967; Grimley et al., 1968; Froshauer and Kartenbeck, 1988) , or \"factories\" in vaccinia virus-infected cells (Cairns, 1960; Dales and Siminovitch, 1961 ; Moss, 1990) .

The results obtained with brefeldin A indicate that the poliovirus replication complexes must pass through the Golgi apparatus in order to be functional (Irurzun et al., 19921 , a process that may be mediated by protein 2C (Rodriguez and . Apart from poliovirus, the synthesis of viral RNA by other animal viruses is also depressed by inhibition of lipid synthesis or membrane traffic Irurzun et al., 1993a) .",

Animal virus replication is not necessarily bound to cytopathogenicity. Thus, mutant animal viruses with reduced cytopathic properties are able, in many instances, to replicate and express their genomes to normal levels (Kowalski et al., 1991; Schlesinger et al., 1993) , suggesting that at least in some viruses a single gene product is the major cause of the cytopathic effect. The concept advanced that the cytopathic effect is produced by the expression of one or a (limited) number of virus genes (Carrasco, 1987) is gaining support, as opposed to the idea that the bulk of virus gene expression, or the formation and accumulation of viral particles, is cytopathic. The virus products involved in cytopathicity most probably have the plasma membrane as the primary target of their toxic effects. The suggestion that animal viruses encode proteins \"that form small pores in the lipid bilayer,\" acting as ionophores (Carrasco, 19771 , is now leading to the recognition of a new family of virus proteins that enhance membrane permeability: the viroporins. With increasing knowledge of viral genomes and the application of cloning techniques, a number of proteins involved in modifying membrane permeability have been identified in recent years, and we are beginning to understand the function they play in cytopathogenicity and virus growth.",

            "text": "A s a first step toward the identification of poliovirus proteins involved in increased cellular permeability, most of the poliovirus nonstructural proteins were individually cloned in E . coli (Lama et al., 19921 , and their expression was regulated by the use of a powerful inducible system (Studier et al., 1990; Dubendorff and Studier, 1991) . These studies led to the identification of two toxic proteins with lytic capacity for bacteria: poliovirus proteins 2B and 3A (Lama and Carrasco, 1992a,b) . Induction of elevated synthesis of either of these polypeptides permeabilized prokaryotic cells, whereas none of the other poliovirus nonstructural products produced this effect (Lama and Carrasco, 1992a) . Polypeptide 3A, and its precursor 3AB, are known to interact with cellular membranes in infected human cells (Takegami et al., 1983a,b) . Computer analyses of these proteins indicated that the hydrophobicity of 3A extended over a region of 20-22 amino acids that formed an amphipathic helix. Moreover, 3A is a basic protein that shows some homology with other lytic proteins . In contrast, protein 2B lacks an amphipathic helical domain. Because membrane-active proteins act on all types of cells, irrespective of whether they are eukaryotic or prokaryotic Bernheimer and Rudy, 1986; Dempsey, 1990; Kokryakov et al., 1993) , their expression and analysis of their mode of action in E . coli cells provide a powerful model system. The inducible system developed by Studier et al. (1990; Dudendorff and Studier, 1991) has already proved to be suitable for the characterization of these toxic and highly lytic virus proteins, because their expression is tightly regulated (Lama and Carrasco, 1992b) . In addition, these viral proteins modified membrane permeability in a manner similar to that observed using poliovirus in mammalian cells (Lama and Carrasco, 1992a) . In this respect, changes in permeability to different small molecules (lactose analogs, lysozyme, nucleosides, nonpermeating inhibitors) induced by poliovirus 3A occurred in both directions (influx and efflux), a t a time when other larger molecules were effectively excluded by the plasma membrane. This suggests the formation of hydrophilic pores of a defined size (Lama and Carrasco, 1992a; Lama, 1994) .",

Because synthesis of poliovirus polypeptide 3A in bacterial cells elicits an increase in membrane permeability, the host cells can be morphologically differentiated from E . coli clones expressing wild-type 3A in the presence of a chromogenic substrate (Lama, 1994) . Characterization of the mutants indicated that lysis was a highly specific property of the protein, because changes in a single amino acid abolished the permeabilizing activity and hence the lytic properties of 3A. Even though some 3A mutants still encode a 3A basic protein that is synthesized in cells, usually to higher levels than wild-type 3A, they do not increase membrane permeability (Lama, 1994) . Some of the mutations were located in the hydrophobic domain of protein 3A, giving rise to partially soluble viral polypeptides, whereas other mutations were located in two different domains of 3A, outside of the hy-drophobic region (see Fig. 3 ). An important concept that arises when considering the action of the different 3A mutants is that the ability of a protein to modify membrane permeability should be envisaged in a very specific way. As with enzymes, wherein a single amino acid change may lead to the loss of enzymatic activity, protein 3A loses its pore-forming potential as a result of a small change, for example, the modification of a single amino acid.",

The findings described thus far favor the view that 3A is the poliovirus protein involved in cell lysis, but to reach this conclusion two fundamental predictions still need to be proved. One is that poliovirus protein 3A increases membrane permeability when it is individually expressed in uninfected mammalian cells. Second, poliovirus strains containing mutations in the 3A gene should be unable to induce membrane alterations. A definitive answer to the identity of the poliovirus protein involved in permeability changes must await these results.",

As with other lentiviruses, HIV infection of susceptible cells leads to a number of cytopathic effects, including cell death (Levy, 1993b) . Progression to disease in HIV-infected patients is accompanied by loss of CD4+ T lymphocytes and has been correlated with the emergence of more cytopathic virus variants (Levy, 1993a,b) .

The severity of these effects depends on the HIV variant and on the cell type analyzed. As usually occurs with cytolytic animal viruses, the cytopathic effects are the outcome of interaction of a given virus with a given host cell; other conditions also modulate and influence the cytopathic effect (Bablanian, 1975; Schrom and Babla-nian, 1981; Fraenkel-Conrat and Wagner, 1984) . Due to this complexity it is not surprising to find that different viral molecules, or different regions of a given protein, participate to different extents in the cytopathic effect. The proteins of fusogenic viruses, such as HIV, are involved in the formation of multinucleated cells (syncytia) and must be distinguished from the proteins that modify individual cell morphology. Both events might be classified as cytopathic effects, but the proteins contributing to them might be different. This distinction is not usually made in studies devoted to analysis of virus cytopathogenicity, sometimes creating confusion. Syncytia formation by HIV is related to the fusion properties of glycoproteins, whereas cell killing may be effected by a different gene product, although the molecular events underlying both phenomena may have in common the disturbance of membrane function Cloyd and Lynn, 1991) . In conclusion, changes in membrane permeability by HIV, and perhaps by other enveloped animal viruses, may be produced not only by a typical viroporin, but also by several glycoprotein domains.",

These late alterations include nonspecific modification of the transport of low-molecularweight compounds and monovalent and divalent cations (Lynn et al., 1988; Cloyd and Lynn, 1991) . Sucrose enters HIV-infected cells, whereas inulin is excluded, suggesting that the pores formed by the expression of HIV genes have a specific diameter that allows passage of hydrophilic molecules up to a given size (Cloyd and Lynn, 1991; Miller et al., 1993) .

Point mutations in the amino-terminal region reduced syncytium formation, without affecting glycoprotein processing (Freed et Kowalski et al., 1991) . Mutations of individual amino acids located in the amino-terminal hydrophobic stretch of gp41 as well as polar amino acids that flank this region profoundly block syncytium formation (Freed et al., 1990) . A similar result is observed with two mutants that contain several amino acid insertions in this region (KOwalski et al., 1991). Curiously, the replication ability and virion production by these mutants do not differ from that of wild-type HIV-1 (HXBC2) in Jurkat lymphocytes, indicating that the levels of HIV gene expression (Somasundaran and Robinson, 19881 , or virus particles, are not sufficient to induce cytopathic effects (Kowalski et al., 1991) .

Deletion of the carboxy-terminal 6-14 amino acids of HIV-1 gp41 alters the infectivity and cytopathogenity, although, surprisingly, a larger deletion of 76 amino acids did not abolish viral replication (Lee et al., 1989) . The conclusion reached was that conformational determinants, rather than protein length, are important for gp41 function. Deletion of 146 amino acids of the cytoplasmic domain of SIVmac (plus several point mutations throughout the protein) produces a nonpathogenic variant, SIVmac l A l l , in monkeys. Curiously, the expression of the recombinant TM from SIVmac l A l l produces much larger and more numerous syncytia in rhesus macrophages compared to the parental TM (Ritter et al., 1993) . Clearly, cell killing is unrelated to fusion ability or pathogenicity, in both SIV and HIV (Somasundaran and Robinson, 1987; Chakrabarti et al., 1989; Ritter et al., 1993) .",

The absence of Vpu results in an accumulation of cell-associated viral proteins. T cells infected with Vpu-positive virus release three-to fivefold more virions than do cells with Vpunegative virus. Virions from Vpu-negative provirus accumulate at the cell surface and in endosomes (Klimkait et al., 1990) . The mutant virion particles released are not homogeneous particles, displaying various sizes and shapes, and some of them contain several nucleoids (Klimkait et al., 1990) . Vpu complements Vpu-negative mutants in trans, but it has no effect on production of SIV that is devoid of a Vpu counterpart (Terwilliger et al., 1989) . In contrast, more recent evidence indicates that the Vpu protein of HIV-1 not only facilitates the release of virus particles from the surface of infected cells, but also enhances capsid release from other retroviruses, such as HIV-2, visna virus, and Moloney murine leukemia virus (Gottlinger et al., 1993) .",

The structure of M2 resembles that of poliovirus 3A, togavirus 6K and HIV-1 Vpu (see above). M2 is also an integral membrane protein associated with both the Golgi complex and the cell surface Zebedee et al., 1985) . In polarized epithelial cells (MDCK), M2, like hemagglutinin HA, is preferentially expressed a t the apical surface in close proximity to budding virions (Hughey et al., 1992) . Although early studies indicated that M2 was absent from virions, as with Vpu and togavirus 6K, it was later suggested that M2 is also present in virions (Zebedee and Lamb, 1988; Hughey et al., 1992) . M2 contains 97 amino acid residues, with a hydrophobic membranespanning region of about 20 amino acids that may form an amphipathic helix. M2, as well as HIV-1 Vpu, can form homotetramers that, in the case of M2, are disulfide linked (Sugrue and Hay, 1991) . In addition to tetramers, higher molecular-weight structures containing 10-12 molecules of M2 are also detected (Sugrue and Hay, 1991) . The amino terminus of the M2 protein is located in the extracellular space, whereas the carboxy terminus is cytoplasmic .",

Patch-clamp studies of Xenopus oocytes expressing the natural influenza M2 protein show an increased ionic flux (sodium and potassium) through the plasma membrane (Pinto et al., 1992; . This increased membrane permeability to monovalent cations probably extends to protons and other low-molecular-weight molecules, although direct evidence for higher permeation to other solutes, including protons, has not been presented. Enhanced membrane permeability induced by M2 increased at low pH (6-6.5) in Xenopus oocytes (Pinto et al., 1992) . Mutants of M2 with an altered transmembrane region were unable to permeabilize amphibian cells (Pinto et al., 1992) . The use of E . coli cells expressing high levels of M2 protein in an inducible manner, as discussed in Section IV,A, indicated that this protein was lytic for prokaryotic cells that express lysozyme, and modified membrane permeability to a number of hydrophilic molecules (Guinea and Carrasco, 1994a) . The nonspecific increase in permeability in prokaryotic cells indicates that M2, like other viroporins, forms hydrophilic pores in the membrane. These pores allow the passages of ions and other low-molecular-weight molecules. This membrane disruption was similar to the effects observed in infected cells (Lopez Vancell et al., 1984; Carrasco and Lacal, 1983) . Therefore, M2 is a strong candidate to account for the changes in membrane permeability in influenza virus-infected cells. MDCK cells infected with influenza virus show enhanced passive permeability to sodium and potassium ions 5 h r postinfection (Lopez Vancell et al., 1984) . Permeability toward to nonpermeating translation inhibitors was observed before the onset of synthesis of influenza virus proteins . A more detailed kinetic analysis of permeability changes in influenza virus-infected cells is required to assess more precisely the nature and the timing of membrane disruption that occur in these cells. Finally, influenza M2 mutants and the individual expression of M2 in mammalian cells can now be exploited to explore the capacity of M2 to promote permeability changes in mammalian cells.",

In this model, M2 would raise the pH in the Golgi complex, such that the integrity of HAUHA2 during transport through the vesicular system to the plasma membrane would be maintained Takeuchi and Lamb, 1994) .

This agent blocks the growth of a number of animal viruses, including some strains of influenza virus (Tominack and Hayden, 1987; . The exact mode of action of amantadine in influenza virus replication remains unclear. It blocks two steps of infection. Early inhibition by amantadine is related to inhibition of virus uncoating . This effect is rather nonspecific because high concentrations of the drug are required and replication of other animal viruses is inhibited by these amantadine concentrations (Nicholson, 1984; Rosenthal et al., 1982 Rosenthal et al., , 1988 Schulman, 1982; Wittels and Spear, 1991) . The molecular basis of this early inhibition by amantadine relies on the accumulation of the drug in endosomes, an event that leads to increased endosomal pH. It was suggested that amantadine binds to the pore region of the channel formed by M2 (Sugrue and Hay, 1991) . The M2 protein present in virions would permit the flow of ions, including protons, from the endosome into the virus particle interior to disrupt macromolecular interactions, freeing the nucleocapsid from the M1 protein. This activity of M2 would be blocked by amantadine. More recent experiments suggest that amantadine acts as an allosteric blocker that binds to another portion of M2 not directly involved in the pore region .",

            "text": "Togaviruses are plus-stranded RNA-containing viruses that possess a lipid envelope (Schlesinger and Schlesinger, 1993) . During the late phase of Semliki Forest virus or Sindbis virus infection there is a drastic shut-off of host protein synthesis, and only the translation of a viral subgenomic mRNA takes place (Ulug et al., 1987) , producing a polyprotein precursor that contains several proteins in the order C-p62-6K-El (Garoff et al., 1980) . This precursor is proteolytically cleaved to generate the mature viral proteins: C, the capsid protein, is autocatalytically cleaved and interacts with the genomic RNA to form the nucleocapsid, whereas the rest of the proteins are processed by the cellular signal peptidase (Liljestrom and Garoff, 1991) . The p62 precursor is hydrolyzed to generate E3 and E2 that, together with E l , comprise the three glycoproteins present in the lipid bilayer of virion particles (Schlesinger and Schlesinger, 1993; Barth et al., 1992) . Togaviruses induce drastic changes in membrane permeability during infection (Carrasco, 1978; Garry et al., 1979; Ulug et al., 1984; Murioz et al., 1985b; Garry et al., 1986; Ulug et al., 1987) . These modifications lead to an imbalance of ions in the cytoplasm, thus blocking host protein synthesis Ulug et al., 1987) . The translation of Semliki Forest virus subgenomic 26s mRNA is not inhibited by increasing the concentrations of monovalent ions either in uitro or in the infected cells Alonso and Carrasco, 1982a) . We have suggested that some of the changes in membrane permeability observed during togavirus infection could be explained by the membrane-active characteristics of the 6K protein (Sanz et al., 1994) . This protein is a heavily acylated polypeptide of 60 amino acids that interacts with membranes Lusa et al., 1991) . Although the 6K protein is initially associated with p62 and E l and travels through the ER to the plasma membrane as a complex with these proteins, it is not encapsidated in virions (Lusa et al., 1991) . Thus, most 6K is excluded during budding of new virions, although some 6K can still be detected in these particles .",

Complete removal of the 6K sequence from the genome had no effect on virus RNA replication, gene expression, or glycoprotein transport, but there was a reduction in virus release (Liljestrom et al., 1991) . Mutants that contain an underacylated 6K protein also have defects in budding of new virions (GaedigK-Nitschko et al., 1990) . Recently, a Sindbis virus 6K mutant containing an in-frame insertion of 15 amino acids has been generated (Schlesinger et al., 1993) . This mutant was viable and the virions formed had no detectable 6K, but they were as infectious as wild-type Sindbis virus (Schlesinger et al., 1993) . Synthesis of viral proteins occurred in the 6K-deficient mutants, but there was some interference with the proteolytic processing at the junction between p62 and 6K. Notably, this Sindbis virus mutant was defective in its ability to block host translation (Schlesinger et al., 19931, suggesting that synthesis of the 6K plays a part in the shut-off of host protein synthesis by togaviruses. These results agree well with the recent finding that hy-potonic medium reverses the shut-off of cellular translation induced by Sindbis virus (Garry, 1994) .",

In addition to the viral proteins discussed above, i.e., poliovirus 3A, HIV-1 Vpu, influenza M2, and togavirus 6K, several known virus proteins also have such characteristic sequence elements (see Figs. 5 and 6 ). Some paramyxoviruses, such as respiratory syncytial virus, contain a small hydrophobic (SH) polypeptide that is an integral membrane protein (Olmsted and Collins, 1989) . The RSV SH protein is composed of 64 amino acids and contains a very hydrophobic stretch of amino acids in the center of the protein, followed by a basic sequence, typical of membrane-active proteins. The SH protein is expressed at the cell surface (Olmsted and Collins, 19891 , but the function of SH in the virus replicative cycle remains unknown. Several species of SH have been distinguished, including one that is glycosylated (Olmsted and Collins, 1989) . The protein forms aggregates of various monomers, including species of about 8-10 monomers (Collins and Mottet, 1993) .

Structurally, viroporins are in general short proteins containing around 50-120 amino acid residues. Analysis of the amino acid content of several viroporins shows that they contain a higher than average content of leucine plus isoleucine residues and a lower content of glycine. All of virporins possess a hydrophobic stretch of about 20 amino acids, which in some instances may form an amphipathic helix. Thus, they are integral membrane proteins with at least one membrane-spanning domain. Viroporins tend to form oligomers, most frequently tetramers, thus leaving a hydrophilic pore through which ions and low-molecularweight hydrophilic compounds pass in a nonspecific manner. In addition to tetramers, other oligomeric structures containing multiple viroporin molecules may be formed. In addition to the hydrophobic region, viroporins usually contain basic amino acids, as seen with membrane-active toxins (see Section VI). These regions of basic amino acids may participate in membrane permeabilization by destabilizing the lipid bilayer. In summary, the structure of viroporins allows formation of oligomeric structures spanning the membrane to form hydrophilic pores.",

I would stress that the opposite view is more plausible, i.e., that viruses exist the cell because the membrane is being lysed by specific membrane-active proteins encoded by the viral genome. Therefore, a new concept arises-namely, that animal viruses contain in their genomes one or more genes specifically devoted to lysing the plasma membrane. This may be particularly important for viruses that possess naked virion particles. In order to leave the cells, such viruses, which are devoid of a lipid membrane, need to lyse the cell membrane. In the case of enveloped virion particles, this envelope is acquired in the last step of assembly, by budding from the plasma membrane, which is modified by a specific viral product that produces pores. The increased membrane permeability due to pore formation would be required for efficient budding of enveloped viruses. In the absence of viroporins animal viruses are still made, but the number of virus progeny is greatly diminished. Little is known about the forces that induce a virus particle to bud and be released from the cell. Membrane budding could also be regulated by alterations that virus-infected cells suffer in calcium homeostasis. Apart from calcium, the levels of other cations and pH also change drastically during infection. Several years ago, it was indicated that the ionic milieu in the cytoplasm of a virusinfected cell during virus assembly is quite different from that in the early stages of infection, when the virus decapsidates (Carrasco, 1977) . Virus assembly is known to be affected by cations and pH in uitro, so why not also in the infected cell?",

Formation of pores leads to the dissipation of the membrane potential and the ionic gradients that would be gradually destroyed as infection progresses. Not only the ionic gradients maintained by the plasma membrane, but also those present in intracellular compartments, including the proton gradient, would disappear. The physical integrity of the membrane could be disrupted initially by the formation of hydrophilic pores and by the insertion in the membrane of viroporin regions containing basic amino acids that destabilize the lipid bilayer in a detergent fashion. The focal distribution of viroporins in the bilayer would promote preferential virus release through these regions. Subsequently, stimulation of phospholipases may complete the physical disappearance of the lipid bilayer in certain regions of the plasma membrane, leading to cell lysis.",

It was initially proposed that the modifications in membrane permeability to monovalent ions in virus-infected cells is responsible for the virus-induced shut-off of host translation (Carrasco and Smith, 1976; Carrasco, 1977) . Overwhelming evidence indicates that this may be the case of EMC virus-infected cells. Togaviruses block host translation by a similar mechanism Ulug et al., 1984 Ulug et al., , 1987 Munoz et al., 1985a) . The translation of cellular mRNAs will be rapidly inhibited by the action of the lytic protein, whereas viral RNA translation tolerates these adverse conditions and is still translated. Perhaps shut-off of host translation is a by-product of a viral process, such as cell lysis, a requirement to liberate the virus particles made during infection.",

At present we have evidence that the individual expression of poliovirus 3A, SFV 6K, and influenza M2 in E . coli and amphibian cells modifies membrane permeability in a nonspecific way. The inducible prokaryotic system described in Section IV,A promises to be of great value not only for identifying other putative viroporins, but also for obtaining mutants to explore the portions of the molecule most relevant to viroporin activity.

The most common feature of proteins that form ion channels is the presence of domains containing a-helices that span the membrane (Eisenman and Dani, 1987; Eisenberg, 1984; Lear et al., 1988; Imoto, 1993) . The association of several amphipathic helices builds up a pore in such a way that the hydrophobic region of the a-helix is in contact with the membrane lipids, whereas the hydrophilic residues form part of the hydrophilic pore lumen (Oblatt-Montal et al., 1993; DeGrado et al., 1989; Segrest et al., 1990) . Visualization of botulinum neurotoxin-induced channels in vesicles has been achieved (Schmid et al., 1993) . The channel is formed by interaction of four neurotoxin molecules. Pores can also be formed by amphipathic p-sheets, which have a tendency to associate and can traverse the membrane if they contain a t least 10 amino acids. The best-known members of this group of membrane proteins are the bacterial porins (Cowan, 1993; Schulz, 1993) , which are proteins located in the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria and which allow the passive passage of solutes (Cowan, 1993) . The antiparallel p-barrel structure of porins allows their insertion into the membrane, leaving a pore that can be gated by other regions of the molecule (Cowan, 1993; Schulz, 1993; Weiss and Schulz, 1993) . Lymphocyte perforins may also form similar structures responsible for cell lysis (Lichtenheld et al., 1988; Shinkai et al., 1988; Lowrey et al., 1989; Ojcius et al., 1991) . Selective ion channels present a funnel-shaped architecture, with at least one narrow region within the channel pore, where ion selection takes place (Eisenman and Dani, 1987; Imoto, 1993) . In contrast to this selectivity of ion channels, proteins involved in cell lysis allow the nonspecific passage of ions and of low-molecular-weight hydrophilic compounds, with size being the only constraint on permeability.",

Pores formed by these lytic proteins do not have a determined pore size, which may vary according to the number of proteins that interact to form a given pore. In this sense the formation of pores is plastic. The initial pore is formed by oligomerization of a determined number of pore-forming proteins. However, as infection progresses and the number of viroporins in the plasma membrane increases, other proteins can be recruited to widen the pore size. Pores are not selective with regard to the molecules that can pass through them. Ions, in the first instance, because of their smaller size, and low-molecular-weight compounds can pass through the pores. As the pore size increases, however, macromolecules, including enzymes, may leak through them. This is exactly the phenomenology observed in animal virus-infected cells: initially the permeability of ions and of low-molecular-weight compounds increases in both directions, and finally enzymes leak out of the infected cells.",

Extensive studies have been carried out on the molecular basis of phage-induced lysis in bacteria. In all cases analyzed, the bacteriophage encodes a specific protein responsible for lysing the bacterial membrane (Young, 1992) . These lytic proteins should not be confused with lysozyme, an enzyme also encoded by some phages (and by cells) that is able to digest peptidoglycans, and hence the bacterial cell wall. Some virologists still may have the idea that lysis of bacteria by phages is due to lysozyme activity. In fact, bacterial lysis by phage infection results from permeabilization of the lipid bilayer by specific lytic proteins, thus allowing lysozyme to act on the external cell wall (Garret and Young, 1992) .",

There is a strong structural (and perhaps functional) similarity between holins and viroporins (see Figs. 5 and 6) . At present there is evidence that about seven proteins may act as holins. These proteins are S and S 2 1 from A phage and the lambdoid phage 21, respectively; protein t from phage T4; gp17.5 from T7 phage; LydA encoded by phage P1; the 429-encoded p14; and p10 from phage $6 (Young, 1992). As with viroporins, these proteins are unrelated in terms of primary structure, but they have in common one or two putative membranespanning domains of hydrophobic amino acids. It has been speculated that the two transmembrane domains can interact with each other to form a hole in the membrane. Perhaps, as in the case of viroporins, holins can form multimeric aggregates to generate pores in the membrane, even if they possess a single transmembrane domain. Bacteriophage lysis can be prevented without inhibiting the accumulation of intracellular phage particles (Josslin, 1971 ). Phospholipase activity occurs as a consequence of hole formation by phage T4, suggesting a role for lipases in lysis (Bennett et al., 1971; . However, phage release still occurs even if phospholipase activation is inhibited (Hardaway et al., 1975) .",

This situation resembles infection of mammalian cells by picornaviruses, wherein different molecules cross the membrane in both directions . Even the entry of protein toxins can be detected to a small extent, suggesting that the pores formed are heterogeneous in size or that small proteins can, to a limited extent, cross damaged membranes by unknown mechanisms. The efficiency of membrane penetration by a given compound would depend primarily on the size and the chemical characteristics of the molecule, whereas detection of its passage depends on the sensitivity of the assay employed.

This is the case, for example, for melittin (Bernheimer and Rudy, 1986; Dempsey, 19901, bacterial hemolysins (Felix, 1982; Suttorp et al., 19931, magainin (Bevins and Zasloff, 1990) , cecropins van Hofsten et al., 1985) , attacins (Hultmark et al., 19831, perforins (Podack, 19921, complement (Podack, 1986; Muller-Eberhard, 1988) , defensins (Ganz et al., 1990; Cociancich et al., 1993) , protegrins (Kokryakov et al., 19931, and Entarnoeba histolytica pore-forming peptide (Leippe et al., 19921. Understanding the mode of action of the increasing number of proteins discovered to lyse cells is simplified by analysis of two paradigmatic peptides: melittin, which modifies membrane permeability by disrupting the lipid bilayer of membranes, and alamethicin, a peptide able to form aggregates that span the membrane-forming aqueous pores. It is likely that viroporins, or some moieties of viral glycoproteins, could injure the plasma membrane by similar mechanisms. Moreover, some viroporins may contain different domains, one involved in pore formation and another in membrane disruption. The reader is referred to reviews on permeabilizing agents for additional details on these compounds (Felix, 1982; Bernheimer and Rudy, 1986; Kaiser and Kezdy, 1987; Vaara, 1992) .",

It is composed of 26 amino acids, of which residues 1-19 are very hydrophobic and czn form a n amphipathic a-helix, whereas the domain containing amino acids 20-26 is very basic. Both domains are required for efficient lysis (Dempsey, 1990) . Several agents, including divalent cations, have been reported to protect against the lytic effects of melittin and other toxins (Bashford et al., 1989) . However, this finding has not been reproduced by others (Portlock et al., 1990) . Melittin has been used in numerous studies as a model to investigate the interaction of peptides and membranes in order to elucidate the molecular basis of lytic activity. The action of melittin on membranes is complex and depends on a number of parameters, including the composition of the membrane, the membrane potential, and the melittin concentration. On interaction of melittin with membranes, there is an increase in ion conductance, membrane depolarization, membrane fusion, phospholipase activity, etc. (Dempsey, 1990) . The initial effects of melittin on membranes may include the formation of pores that are permeable to ions but still impermeable to proteins (Dempsey, 1990) . These pores probably form discrete channels before the more generalized effect on membrane lipid disorganization takes place. This leads to the breakdown of membranes into micelles, similar to the action of some detergents.",
