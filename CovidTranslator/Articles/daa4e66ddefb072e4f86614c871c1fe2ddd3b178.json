The lack of success in vaccine development and the emergence of drug resistance to commonly used drugs emphasize the urgent need for alternative antivirals against HSV-2 infection. Arbidol (ARB) has been demonstrated to be a broad spectrum antiviral drug that exhibits immunomodulatory properties that affect the HSV-2 life cycle. This study investigated the efficacy and mechanism of ARB against HSV-2 in vivo and in vitro to further explore the clinical application of ARB. Methods: The efficacy of ARB on HSV-2 infection in vitro was examined by CPE and MTT assays. A vaginitis model was established to monitor changes in histopathology and inflammatory cytokine (IL-2, IL-4, TNF-\u03b1 and TGF-\u03b2) expression by H&E staining and ELISA, respectively, and the efficacy of ARB was evaluated accordingly. Furthermore, flow cytometry was used to determine the ratio of CD4 + /CD8 + T cells in the peripheral blood of the vaginitis animals. Considering the balance of efficacy and pharmacokinetics, ARB ointment was strictly prepared to observe formulation efficacy differences compared to the oral dosing form.",

The results of the time-course assay suggested that 25 \u03bcg/mL ARB affected the late stage of HSV-2 replication. However, ARB did not inhibit viral attachment or cell penetration. The in vivo results showed that ARB ointment can improve the survival rate, prolong the survival time and reduce the reproductive tract injury in mice infected with HSV-2, regulate cytokine expression; and balance the CD4 + and CD8 + T lymphocyte ratio in the peripheral blood to participate in the regulation of immune response. Conclusion: ARB showed anti-HSV-2 activity in vitro in a dose-dependent manner and played a role in inhibiting the late replication cycle of the virus. The vaginitis model was successfully established, according to immunomodulation outcomes, responded better to ARB in ointment form than in oral form.",

HSV is one of the most common pathogens in humans and is frequently reported to be responsible for herpetic encephalitis, herpes keratitis, genital herpes, neonatal infections, myocarditis and other diseases that are widely spread by humans to humans [3] . There are two distinct types in HSV infections of the central nervous system, HSV-1 (which produces most cold sores) and HSV-2 (which produces most genital herpes) [4] . It is estimated that > 500 million people aged , approximately 16% of the population globally in this age range, are carriers of HSV-2, a virus with a risk of mortality up to 70% when left untreated [5] . HSV-2 infection usually causes characteristic lesions on the mucous membranes and skin surrounding the genitals [5] . After the initial or primary infection, some infected people experience sporadic episodes of viral reactivation or outbreaks. In addition, the seroprevalence of HSV-2 in women is higher than that in men and transmission of HSV-2 during childbirth can cause complications in neonates resulting in brain damage or death. Simultaneously, HSV-2 infection increases the risk of HIV acquisition by approximately three-fold [6] , and the increase in risk is even greater in those with a newly-acquired HSV-2 infection. The nucleoside analog acyclovir (ACV) discovered in 1974 is currently the only Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved treatment for HSV-2 infection [7] . In clinical trials, it can modulate the course of the disease and decrease the transmission risk but cannot cure the disease. Furthermore, ACV has a single mechanism of action against HSV-2 that requires active site coordination, which can easily lead to drug resistance and cross-resistance. This resistance is a major threat that could reduce the impact of antiviral drugs against STIs worldwide, especially among HIV-infected patients in regions and immunocompromised patients where only limited treatment options are available [8] . Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop a novel drug with different mechanism of action against HSV-2 infection due to the disease severity.",

            "text": "ARB, a small molecule indole derivative developed by the Russian Center for Medicinal Chemistry in 1993 and already licensed in Russia and China, is reported as an anti-influenza agent with immunomodulatory properties [9] , but its clinical application has been limited regionally. It can not only interfere with virus-induced membrane fusion, but also degrade viral RNA (mRNA) to inhibit protein synthesis and thereby block the early replication of the virus [10] . In addition, ARB can also induce interferon (IFN) release in the host peripheral blood [11] . Recent studies extended its inhibitory activity to other human viruses, including respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), rhinovirus (RHV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), coxsackievirus (CVB), severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), herpes simplex virus type I (HSV-1) and the influenza mutant strains resistant to amantadine and oseltamivir [12] . YS Boriskin et al. demonstrated that ARB has a prophylactic effect on HCV infection and inhibits HCV replication [9] . ARB exerted even significantly antiviral activity against Hantaan virus (HTNV) that reduced pathological changes, decreased viral loads and regulated serum TNF-\u03b1 levels in infected tissues [13] . ARB inhibits CVB-5 virus replication in vitro and in vivo, the mechanism by which is to block viral adsorption and the late stage(s) of viral replication, thus exerting a long-lasting antiviral effect [14] . In addition, recent data showed that ARB exerts a direct antiviral effect on the early viral replication of SARS virus in GMK-AH-1 cells [15] , but its specific mechanism and clinical application still need further study. Perfetto et al. revealed that ARB exhibited the ability to influence HSV-1 replication through reduction of viral expression and modulation of the cytokine pathway [16] . ARB showed a strong therapeutic effect, even better than ACV on HSV-2 infection in the rabbit model of viral keratitis [17] . In two trials, the superior efficacy of ARB compared with ribavirin was demonstrated in patients with influenza virus and the prophylactic use of ARB reduced acute respiratory virus infection and the incidence of secondary viralbacterial pneumonia [18, 19] . Based on ARB's chemical structure, 17 metabolites, of which some may play antiviral and anti-inflammatory roles and could be useful as drug prototypes, could be identified in human urine after administration of a single 300 mg-dose of ARB to healthy people [20] . On the other hand, the clinical value of ARB is underestimated due to its regional application in China and Russia. ARB, with its unique pharmacological action, low toxicity and good tolerability, is considered a promising broad-spectrum antiviral drug.",

Infection always leads to some severe diseases, such as genital herpes [37] , vaginitis [37] , and encephalitis [7] , and increases the risk of HIV acquisition [38] so that HSV-2 infection has been recognized as an important marker for HIV-1 infection. HSV persists indefinitely, can be shed for years and can reactivate, which is probably one of the reasons that the prevalence of genital herpes in developing countries has increased in recent decades [39] . Therefore, the development of novel antiviral strategies is critically required for counteracting the emergence of HSV-2. Previous studies have shown that ARB has an inhibitory effect on enveloped and nonenveloped RNA and DNA viruses, including some variant strains of amantadine and oseltamivir [12, 40, 41] , by targeting different the stages of virus replication cycle [42] . We have recently reported the activity of ARB in suppressing influenza A virus (H1N1) propagation in vitro [21] . Furthermore, in this paper, we found that a nontoxic concentration of ARB is effective for blocking the cytopathic effect induced by HSV-2 in a dose-dependent manner in the late stage of the virus replication cycle but has no direct inactivating effect on HSV-2 itself nor does it interfere with the adherence of the virus to the cell surface, which is consistent with the data documented for HSV-1 virus [43] , HCV virus [9] and Hantaan virus [13] .

In our study, however, oral administration of ARB only slightly improved the weight loss, survival rate and release of virus particles at the infected vaginal site caused by HSV-2 infection, and showed no significant difference compared to the virus group. This may be because the distribution of the drug in mice was rapid and extensive after intragastric administration of ARB, and the maximum concentrations of drug mainly appear in the digestive tract such as stomach, small intestine, and large intestine, followed by the target organs such as lung, spleen and liver, but the concentration in the genitalia is low due to the drug's pharmacokinetics [17] . It is also likely that ARB, rather than its metabolites, exerts antiviral and anti-inflammatory effects. Based on this, we specifically prepared ARB ointment for the treatment of vaginal infection sites. Interestingly, the results showed that ARB ointment could significantly alleviate vaginal pathology, increase the survival rate, prolong the survival time, and delay the weight loss induced by HSV-2 viral infection as well as inhibit the release of progeny virus. Activating the immune response is an efficient way to interfere with viral infection, as this system is responsible for virus elimination. Cytokines play an important role in the activation of immune system, the regulation of the immune responses and the promotion of viral clearance [44] . Suppression of these cytokines can potentially control the severity of virus-induced inflammatory complications and essentially reduce mortality. Recent studies have found that most patients infected with HSV, especially those with recurrence, have an immunologic defect associated with lacking T cells [45] . Perfetto B. et al. further noted that ARB could regulate the HSV-induced overexpression of cytokines such as IL-6, TNF-\u03b1 and TGF-\u03b2 [16] . Previously, we reported that several proinflammatory cytokines induced by influenza (IL-10, TNF-\u03b1, IL-8, IP-10, MCP-1, RANTES and IL-6) were downregulated by posttreatment with ARB in mice and ferrets [21] . Therefore, we hypothesize that ARB may suppress HSV-2 infection by modulating the expression of inflammatory cytokines (IL-4, IL-2, TGF-\u03b2) because it could act as an immunomodulator to drive the host cells to exert an antiviral response against HSV-2.",

To a certain extent, the spleen index is one of the important indicators of immune function, and its value change can reflect the state of the body's immune function after hypersensitivity occurs [46] . In this paper, the results showed that the spleen index values at 5 d.p.i. of the HSV-2-infected mice significantly increased compared with those of mice in the normal control group (p < 0.001), indicating that the immune function of HSV-2-infected mice was compromised; however, this is in contrary to previous reports [47] . This may be due to the difference in infection time. We calculated the spleen index on the 5th day after infection; however, the document indicated that at the early stages of viral infection, the immune function was disordered due to the infection, resulting in compensatory hyperplasia of the spleen [48] , so that the spleen index values of the virus group and the ointment vehicle group were higher than that of the normal group. With the prolongation of the infection time, the condition of the infected mice gradually increased and the spleen atrophied. Another reason that might explain this difference is the different routes of infection. We directly inoculated the vagina with HSV-2, which activated the immune system earlier than oral administration. Based on our results, ARB ointment can delay the compensatory hyperplasia of the spleen and weight loss caused by HSV-2, indicating that ARB ointment can effectively modulate the body's immune function, balance the body's cytokine levels and suppress the disorders caused by HSV-2 infection.",

Among the immune participants, CD4 + T cells and CD8 + T cells play an important role. Studies have shown that in the absence of HSV-2 antibodies, initiation of replication-deficient virus-induced T cell responses may be effective against HSV-2 infection; CD4 + T cells are essential, and their secreted cytokines can promote CD8 + T cells enter into HSV-2-infected tissues [49] . Jia Zhu et al. found that when genital tract subclinical HSV-2 infections recur, virus-specific CD8 + T cells will accumulate around the sensory nerves of the genital tract [50] , indicating that CD8 + T cells play an important role in clearing the activation virus. At the same time, the related cytokines secreted by CD4 + and CD8 + T cells may be involved in cellular immune responses during viral infection. Our results showed that the ratio of CD4 + /CD8 + T cells in the peripheral blood of the ointment vehicle group and the virus group was lower than in the normal group. Interestingly, the ratio of CD4 + /CD8 + is significantly higher after treatment, suggesting that ARB ointment exerts an immunomodulatory effect that enhances the immune function to eliminate HSV-2 in the host and prevents the recurrence of genital herpes.",
