The 20th annual CVS (25-28 April, 2004) was attended by 727 clinical virologists and other interested individuals, while 304 attended the Workshop (23-24 April, 2004). Both meetings are organized by the Pan American Society for Clinical Virology (PASCV) and the University of South Florida College of Medicine. The gatherings are characterized by the high quality and focus of the presentations, lively question and answer sessions, and (not least) the meeting location in a modest older hotel on a beautiful Gulf of Mexico beach.",

Within the last 5 years, the Molecular Diagnostics Laboratory at Emory experienced a growth in test volume from 9000 tests in 1999 to almost 30,000 tests in 2003. The increased demand for new markers and the availability of open analytical systems has motivated laboratories to develop in-house assays, since the diagnostics industry has not kept pace.",

After 2 years, they gave up and started sending the test out. Some people indicated in the question period that they believe HPV DNA will replace PAP (Papanicoleau smear stain) eventually as a screen for cervical cancer.",

Hillyard, M.D., (DH) from ARUP Laboratories in Salt Lake City, UT spoke on Selecting and Designing Primers and Probes, and his somewhat surprising suggestion was 'don't do it.' At least do not do it from scratch or by yourself. There are many problems with target selection (lack of data to show taxonomic relations and polyphormisms) and sequence design (such as for single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs)), where very limited published sequence data are available): these will trip up inexperienced investigators. The approach he advised is to order multiple primer sets and use published assays, taking advantage of existing technical and clinical validations, and even then, not to assume that the design works. In the discussion that followed, no one spoke up for de novo design of primers and probes, and several people described problems that arose with new in-house tests: priming failures due to inaccurate melting temperature (T m ) calculations, primer dimer (3'complementarity) and hairpin (self-complementarity) formation, non-specific priming and 3'homology to amplicon. In summary, DH considered SNPs difficult to detect by sequencing, and sequence data bases to be inadequate to identify relevant SNPs for primers and probes.",

Continuing post-verification processes (for about 6 months after implementation) are needed for further data evaluation and gap filling. Mandatory inclusion of external controls and standards from various commercially available sources (e.g., WHO standards for hepatitis A, B, C virus, Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and parvovirus B19) is recommended. Statistics on LOD (limit of detection) could be done with PROBIT analysis. There are still as yet unidentified inhibitors in polymerase chain reaction (PCR), in addition to known inhibitors such as methanol, heparin, SDS, glycerol and various polysaccharides.

            "text": "Analyte-Specific Reagents (ASRs): Issues and Challenges was the topic addressed by Sally Hojvat, Ph.D., from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Rockville, MD. ASRs are defined in FDA regulations as: \"antibodies, both polyclonal and monoclonal, receptor proteins, ligands, nucleic acid sequences, and similar reagents which, through specific binding or chemical reaction with substances in a specimen are intended for use in a diagnostic application for identification and quantification of an individual chemical substance or ligand in biological specimen\" (21 CFR, 864, 4020). She described the FDA's intention in promulgating the ASR rule in 1997 to bring the 'active ingredient' in various in-house methods under regulation so that there would be improved oversight of these tests. Under the ASR rule, manufacturers have responsibility for registration and listing of the reagents, manufacture using quality system regulations (QSRs), post-market reporting of serious adverse events, and labelling, according to FDA requirements, with a disclaimer and no clinical or performance claims, and no instructions for use or intended use. ASRs may be sold only to high complexity laboratories. Laboratories have responsibility to function as high complexity labs under the CLIA regulations, to establish performance of tests using ASRs assembled in the laboratory, and to label results with a specific disclaimer: \"This test was developed and its performance characteristics determined by (laboratory name). It has not been cleared or approved by FDA.\" Challenges to the rule have included difficulties with the FDA's ASR database, and the creativity of some companies in marketing devices as ASRs that closely resemble test kits. RUO (research use only) and IUO (investigational use only) diagnostics, in addition to ASR diagnostics, need to be differentiated from FDA-cleared diagnostics. Going forward, FDA will continue to consider how the ASR rule can be better applied to encourage new IVD technologies and diminish concerns about safety and effectiveness, while ensuring quality. Disease Control and Prevention) published case definitions for SARS. While serology is not useful for case definitions (only for epidemiology), either virus culture, which is slow, insensitive and requires level three laboratories, or (better) RT-PCR (reverse transcriptase PCR) from nasopharyngeal swabs, throat swabs, stool, sputum or bronchoscopy specimens should be used. Surprisingly, stool proved to be the best specimen, since it is positive early (6 days after clinical presentation) and still later positive with high titers! In summary, laboratories have a choice in selecting a SARS test: either conventional serology, or real time, inhouse or commercially available RT-PCR assays, based on needs and available instrumentation. There are four commercially available SARS-CoV tests on the market provided by Artus Biotech, Roche, Prodesse and EraGen Biosciences. Three of these had excellent analytical sensitivities using purified RNA, but poor clinical sensitivities from single specimens. Thus, JM's recommendations include testing multiple specimens for SARS-CoV RNA (respiratory plus stool plus follow up specimens), and using a second amplification target as a confirmatory test. Improvement in PCR assays will be required to detect all cases in a timely fashion, and also improvements in sensitivity and specificity of antibody tests will be required for earlier diagnosis. While initial testing by RT-PCR was positive only in 43% (47/109) of the Toronto patients (mean of 3.9 days from onset to collection), convalescent serology was positive in 90% (35/39, mean time of 26 days). RT-PCR was most often positive for specimens collected 9-11 days into the disease.",

One trial included 19 students (12 had primary infectious mononucleosis as defined on the following serological basis: viral capsid antigen (VCA) IgM positive, VCA-IgG negative and Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA-1)-IgG negative) [Authors wonder why also not positive for VCA-IgG, since 'isolated VCA-IgM' is not a common marker in EBV-acute phase sera?

EBV was not commonly found in the plasma; only 16/111 (14%) of the plasma samples tested contained detectable virus. Viral decay in PBMCs paralleled that in whole blood, with a median decay halflife of 4.0 days. The highest concentration of EBV from all sites sampled was in oral washes 6-7 weeks after onset of illness (median 3.5 \u00d7 10 5 copies/mL). Five of these subjects had a follow up visit one year after their acute illness, and one still had detectable virus in either the oral pellet or supernatant fluid. In summary, young adults with primary infectious mononucleosis have 10 2 -10 3 more copies of EBV in oral washes, blood and PBMCs than patients with no or past EBV infections.",

Currently respiratory viruses such as influenza A and B, RSV, parainfluenza 1-4, metapneumoviruses, adenoviruses, enteroviruses, rhinoviruses and others are diagnosed either through direct immunofluorescence (DIF), electron microscopy (EM) or by culture and serology. Comparing results from virus culture to nucleic acid tests (NAT), the NAT or real-time PCR provided the better sensitivities, with clear advantages for testing, e.g., for rhinovirus (<20% in culture versus 80% in NAT), metapneumovirus (<10% culture versus >50% NAT), SARS-CoV (<50% culture versus 80% NAT) or other coronaviruses (<20% culture versus approximately 90% NAT). Culture usually takes several days to complete, while NAT is done within 1-2 days. The positive predictive value (PPV) of NAT may be 90%, while PPV for culture is 100%. Comparing costs of tests, including work load, the DIF was $54/test, culture was $388/test and PCR was $50/test. Thus, the future in respiratory diagnosis was suggested:",

In Vignette #1, there was a good correlation between pleocytosis and EV PCR in CSF, e.g., in patients >2 months of age with no pleocytosis, 98% of patients will be negative on EV RT-PCR (negative predictive value = 98%). In Vignette #2: the major issue in CMV genotyping might be to detect resistance to gancyclovir (GCV), either through culture and plaque assay, PCR/REN (restriction enzyme assay), or through sequencing. In his study only 3% of GCV-resistant viruses had mutations only in the DNA polymerase gene: thus one must use the plaque reduction assay or sequence the UL54 gene (which will also detect mutations that confer cidovir and foscarnet resistance). In Vignette #3: in the early 90's, three nested sets of primers (pol, gag, env) were developed for detecting HIV proviral DNA. All specimens were tested with the pol primer set, and if negative, reported; if positive, confirmed with either gag or env. Now there are re-optimized primers available, e.g., Stratagene Opti-Prime TM kit, providing huge improvements in the gel readout. In Vignette #4: while RSV infections are more seasonal during winter time, B. pertussis infections mainly occur in the summer. Thus, MA recommended not testing for Bordetella pertussis dur-ing the winter respiratory season, on the basis of epidemiological data presented. In Vignette #5: MA's lab tested skin and mucous membrane lesions for HSV with PCR from 1735 specimens, and tested 127 specimens for VZV. Thirty-eight percent (662 samples) were positive for HSV, while 62% were negative (1073). Forty-five percent (57 samples) were positive for VZV and 55% (70) were negative. They did a retrospective study to determine how often VZV DNA was present in lesion specimens where HSV PCR had been ordered (skin and mucous membrane lesions due to HSV and VZV look similar). Results: none of the mucous membrane specimens negative for HSV with PCR, either genital or oral, was VZV PCR positive (0/118 genital specimens; 0/62 oral specimens). VZV DNA was detected in 6 out of 26 (23%) dermal specimens for which VZV PCR was not requested (from HSV PCR negative specimens). He concluded that all dermal lesion specimens submitted for HSV by PCR should be considered for VZV testing, since HSV and VZV are difficult to distinguish visually.",

The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic began in March 2003 in Canada, and provided new challenges for the detection of emerging pathogens such as the SARS-Coronavirus and Human Metapneumovirus (HMPV). JM briefly introduced the worldwide outbreak investigations such as the epidemiological work in China (Guandong) on SARS, and possible sources of origin of the SARS-Coronavirus (exotic animals, the masked palm civet, hog badger and raccoon dog, which are consumed as food in China). SARS antibody prevalence in \"exotic animals\" ranged from 9% (in snakes) to 73% in masked palm civets in Guandong. In February 2003, the CDC (U.S. Centers for",
