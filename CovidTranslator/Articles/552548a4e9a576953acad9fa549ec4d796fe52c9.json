Our research objective was to develop a robust and rapid multiplex TaqMan real-time PCR (qPCR) to detect C. michiganensis in general and C. michiganensis subsp. nebraskensis with enhanced reliability and accuracy by adding non-complementary AT sequences to the 5' end of the forward and reverse primers. Comparative genomic analyses were performed to identify unique and conserved gene regions for primer and probe design. The unique genomic regions, ABC transporter ATP-binding protein CDS/ABC-transporter permease and MFS transporter were determined for specific detection of C. michiganensis and C. m. subsp. nebraskensis, respectively. The AT-rich sequences at the 5' position of the primers enhanced the reaction efficiency and sensitivity of rapid qPCR cycling; the reliability, accuracy and high efficiency of the developed assay was confirmed after testing with 59 strains from inclusivity and exclusivity panels -no false positives or false negatives were detected. The assays were also validated through naturally and artificially infected corn plant samples; all samples were detected for C. michiganensis and C. m. subsp. nebraskensis with 100% accuracy. The assay with 5' AT-rich sequences detected up to 10-and 100-fg of C. michiganensis and C. michiganensis subsp. nebraskensis genome targets, respectively. No adverse effect was observed when sensitivity assays were spiked with host genomic DNA. Addition of 5' AT rich sequences enhanced the qPCR reaction efficiency from 0.82 (M = -3.83) and 0.91 (M = -3.54) to 1.04 (with optimum slope value; M = -3.23) for both C. michiganensis and C. michiganensis subsp. nebraskensis, respectively; a increase of 10-fold sensitivity was also obtained with C. michiganensis primer set. The methodology proposed here can be used to optimize the reaction efficiency and to harmonize the diagnostic protocols which have prodigious applications in routine diagnostics, biosecurity and microbial forensics. \u0394 G value (kcal/mol) in plot calculated by mFold web server; d Selfcomplementary and 3' self-complementary scores (Any and 3', respectively) of the oligos calculated using Primer3 Plus. e Query cover and Identity (%) of the oligos were calculated using Blastn; no significant similarity was found for any of FLAP primers.",

Currently, the genus Clavibacter is known only for one species, C. michiganensis which belongs to family Microbacteriaceae within the phytopathogenic coryneform group, known for epi-or endophytic colonization of symptomatic as well as several asymptomatic plant species [1, 2] . Virulence genes within this species are plasmid-borne (not essentially present), while host colonizing genes are chromosomal [3] . Hitherto, nine subspecies based on host specificity and bacteriological characteristics have been identified within the single species of C. michiganensis. C. michiganensis subsp. nebraskensis is the causal agent of Goss's bacterial wilt and blight of corn (Zea mays), which is listed among the five most significant diseases of corn in the U.S. Goss's wilt accounts for high yield losses in the Great Plains and Midwest regions of the corn belt of the U.S., the largest producer and exporter of corn worldwide. Since the first report in 1969 from Nebraska, the disease has been spreading and adversely impacting corn production in the Midwestern United States including western Indiana, Illinois, Iowa, Missouri, eastern Nebraska, and eastern Kansas, as well as Canada. Goss's disease shows two major types/phases of symptoms -a leaf blight and a systemic vascular wilt [6, 7, 8] . The leaf blight phase involves leaves and above-ground parts of the plant which exhibit small, dark and discontinuous watersoaked spots; orange shiny bacterial exudates are also observed in advanced stages. The less common wilt phase involves systemic infection of xylem elements resulting in discoloration of vascular bundles, stalk rot and premature plant death. Transmission of Goss's disease usually occurs through open wounds on leaves, and C. m. subsp. nebraskensis can overwinter and remain in plant debris to serve an inoculum for the next crop; transmission through seeds is minimal [2, 8, 9] .",

Diagnosis of Goss's wilt is limited to recognition of variable symptoms followed by isolation onto semiselective media and identification of C. michiganensis of the subspecies that causes Goss's wilt using additional tests. Recently, Dobhal and collaborators [10] developed a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) method to discriminate all known subspecies of C. michiganensis; however, no effective qPCR/PCR protocol is available. Although, serological and molecular diagnostic methods for economically important subspecies of C. michiganensis have been developed [2, 7, 11, 12, 13, 14] , these diagnostic tests are time consuming and may exhibit cross reactivity with Gram-positive bacteria and/or Gram-negative bacteria demanding further molecular test for cross confirmation [11, 15] .",

Likewise, the primer (CM-F/R) and probe (CM-P) set exhibited an accurate and specific detection of all twenty-nine strains corresponding to the nine subspecies of C. michiganensis; no cross-reactivity with the members of exclusivity panel was detected. As expected, 151-and 107-bp PCR amplicons were amplified in multiplex endpoint PCR for C. michiganensis subsp. nebraskensis and Clavibacter michiganensis species, respectively (S3 Fig). All primers and probes met the desired 100% query coverage and 100% identity after an alignment using BLASTn against the NCBI nucleotide and genome databases (Table 2) . Thermodynamics, internal structures, GC% content and \u0394 G values for each primer and probe were calculated using mFold and Primer3 Plus; all the parameters are listed in Table 2 . The tendency of primers to form self-structures increased when additional nucleotides were added to the primers; nevertheless, no interference in primer annealing with the target sequence was observed when 5' AT-rich sequences were added to the primers. Furthermore, assay sensitivity for primer sets with flaps was increased ten-fold suggesting positive impact on reaction thermodynamics and stability during annealing and extension steps (Fig 2) .",

However, low reaction efficiencies of 82% and 91% were observed for C. michiganensis species and C. m. subsp. nebraskensis targets, respectively, suggesting inhibition or sub-optimal conditions for amplification ( Fig 4A-B Table 3 ). To optimize the amplification conditions, customized 5'ATrich sequences were added to each primer; the addition of AT-rich sequences at the 5' position remarkably enhanced the reaction efficiency to 99-104% (Fig 4C-H) . The most pronounced positive effect was observed with the C. michiganensis specific primer and probe set; the sensitivity was enhanced 10-fold and detected the target sequence in 10 fg of genomic DNA ( Fig  4A and B ; Table 3 ). No adverse effect was observed when 1 \u00b5l host plant DNA was added in each sensitivity reaction (spiked test, Fig 4E) . Similarly, no effect was observed with the C. m. subsp. nebraskensis-specific primers and probe designed using the MFS gene region. The ATrich sequence effect was also evaluated with endpoint PCR, the C. michiganensis assay sensitivity was enhanced from 100 fg to 10 fg (S3 Fig). Additionally, analysis of the amplification curves indicated that the use of 5'AT-rich sequences did not affect the sigmoidal shape with the concentration of target in sensitivity assays. In contrast, use of non-tailed primers negatively impacted the amplifications as well as the efficiencies (Fig 4) .

Although the overall mechanism involved in improved sensitivity and efficiency due to the use of flap primers in TaqMan qPCR assays is still not completely clear, a study conducted by Vandenbussche and group (2016) [31] suggests that tailed primers suppress the formation of PCR artifacts, determined by primers and dNTP type. Also, tailed primer reactions respond differently to the use of hot-start dNTPs. In this study, the use of the TaqMan real-time qPCR master mix containing hot-start dNTP led to specific detection and amplification without the report of either PCR artifacts or shifting in the sigmoidal shape of the amplification curves.",

The use of a robust multigene format maximizes broad-range detection capabilities, reliability and specificity for C. michiganensis species detection. Fifty-nine strains representing different diseases and hosts were included in the inclusivity and exclusivity panelsno false positives or false negatives were detected. Of 59 samples, 29 were identified as members of various C. michiganensis subspecies, 16 were identified as C. m. subsp. nebraskensis and 25 samples (other than Cm and Cmn) showed no reactivity when specific TaqMan qPCR assays were performed ( Table 2 ). The positive qPCR results with genomic DNA of twenty-nine diverse strains in the inclusivity/exclusivity panels collected from different geographical locations across USA and the world confirmed specificity and broad-range identification of C. michiganensis subspecies and C. m. subsp. nebraskensis using the novel primer and probe sets developed in the present study (Table 1) .",

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/566281 doi: bioRxiv preprint Multiplex TaqMan qPCR assays for detection of C. michiganensis species and C. m. subsp. nebraskensis are robust, accurate, sensitive and reliable. The developed assays can be used to accelerate phytosanitary diagnostics and target pathogen detection. Sensitive detection can help in early detection of latently-infected plant materials and support further studies in pathogen dissemination during interstate or international commerce. The addition of 5' AT-rich sequences lead to the development of thermodynamically competent primers for sensitive detection. This concept also will enable development of improved protocols for different pathogens that can work under the same PCR conditions. Development of mix and match diagnostic protocolswhere the primers can be multiplexed based on individual needs will be possible since each primer's thermodynamics, GC content, annealing temperature and primer length can be customized to fit existing PCR conditions. 1 6 Supporting information captions S1 Fig. dnaA phylogeny within the nine C. michiganensis subspecies inferred using the maximum likelihood (ML) method in MEGA 7.0.25. The evolutionary distances were computed using a General Time Reversible model with gamma distribution (GTR + G). Forty-three partial sequences based on dnaA gene of Clavibacter strains were rooted with 2 closest taxa Leifsonia xyli and Rathayibacter triciti, served as an outgroup.
