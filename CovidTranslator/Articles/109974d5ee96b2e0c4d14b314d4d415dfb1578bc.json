All gene expression experiments were done in duplicate and only genes which were up-or down-regulated in both samples underwent further evaluation. After applying strong restrictions as described in Materials and Methods, resulting genes were grouped according to their function (table1). We focussed on genes related to apoptosis, chemokines, interferon-induced genes and transcription factors, since these gene groups may play an important role in the pathogenesis of SARS. Expression of the selected genes was confirmed by RT-PCR ( fig. 5 ). In the infected cells, we found an up-regulation of some anti-apoptotic genes including Bcl-2 (only in Caco-2 but not in CL-14 cells) and A20, while several pro-apoptotic genes including Bid, Bad, caspase-2 and caspase-6 were down-regulated.",

            "text": "To provide an experimental model for the study of SARS gastrointestinal pathology, we tested the sensitivity of six intestinal cell lines to SARS-CoV infection. In addition to Caco-2 cells which were previously shown to be per-missive to SARS-CoV [8] , only CL-14 cells promoted SARS-CoV replication. CL-14 cells show features of well-differentiated enterocytes [14] while Caco-2 cells show an undifferentiated phenotype with the ability to undergo spontaneous enterocytic differentiation after reaching confluence [15] . We infected Caco-2 cells 2 -3 days after confluence, i. e. when electron microscopy identified mostly poorly differentiated enterocytes and only few well-differentiated (villus) enterocytes. Both poorly and well-differentiated enterocytes supported SARS-CoV replication suggesting that the sensitivity of intestinal epithelial cells does not depend on a particular stage of cellular differentiation. ACE2 has recently been shown to be a functional receptor for SARS-CoV [3] and surface ACE2 is abundantly present on enterocytes of the small intestine [16] . while it down-regulated pro-apoptotic genes such as Bid, Bad, caspase-2 and caspase-6. In a murine model, Bcl-2 overexpression in gut epithelial cells, decreased the apoptosis [17] and protected against intestinal injury [18] . Although Bcl-2 was detectable only in Caco-2 cells, other regulators of the apoptotic mitochondrial pathway including pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 homologues Bid and Bad were down-regulated by SARS-CoV in both Caco-2 and CL-14 cells. Since Bid and Bad are involved in the regulation of intestinal epithelial cell survival [19] , their role in SARS-CoV intestinal infection should be studied further. In both cell lines, SARS-CoV up-regulated A20 which may protect different cell types against tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-mediated programmed cell death and is critical for limiting inflammation by terminating TNF-induced nuclear factor (NF)-kB responses in the intestine and other organs [20] . In addition, down-regulation of caspase-2 and caspase-6 in infected intestinal cell lines may be of interest as these caspases were shown to be important mediators of apoptosis in gastrointestinal epithelium [21, 22] . The results show that SARS-CoV-infected epithelial cells develop an anti-apoptotic response which may be important to inhibit or delay destruction of infected enterocytes. These findings are consistent with clinical observations demonstrating a relatively normal endoscopic and microscopic appearance of the intestine in patients with SARS [5] .",

            "text": "On the other hand, SARS-CoV suppressed expression of the anti-apoptotic gene PDCD4 which is constitutively expressed in most normal tissues including lung and intestine [23] . Apart from its effects in the regulation of apoptosis, PDCD4 was shown to play a role in inhibition of translation by direct interaction with eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4A (eIF4A) [23, 24] . This finding is of interest since activity of eIF4E (together with eIF4A and eIF4G forming the translation initiation factor complex eIF4F) was shown to be important for replication of murine coronavirus [25] . Moreover, PDCD4 has the ability to suppress transactivation of activator protein (AP)-1 [23] . Since the SARS-CoV nucleocapsid was shown to activate the AP-1 transduction pathway [26] , it will be of interest to show whether there may be a mechanistic link between PDCD4 suppression and enhancement of AP-1 tranactivation in SARS-CoV-infected cells. The present observations demonstrate that SARS-CoV infection elevated mRNA levels of AP-1 subunits c-Fos and c-Jun in intestinal cells which could also increase AP-1 transactivation. Infection with most viruses up-regulates different interferon (IFN)-induced genes which may establish an anti-viral state within cells. Its major effectors and indicators include double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR), OAS and MX proteins [27] . SARS-CoV infection of Caco-2 cells up-regulated OAS2 and MXA but not PKR genes. The discrepancy between transcriptional activation of IFN-induced genes and the ability of SARS-CoV to replicate in Caco-2 cells could be explained by the existence of a specific viral mechanism for escaping IFNinduced anti-viral effects common to most viruses [28] . The enteropathogenic potential of HCoV-OC43 (strain Paris) has been suggested to be due to its inability to induce IFN-a [29] . Recently, we showed that IFN-a and IFN-b (type I IFN) inhibited SARS-CoV replication in Caco-2 cells while IFN-g (type II IFN) was not effective [8] . Moreover, IFN-b was 50-90 times more potent than IFN-a against different SARS-CoV strains. The differences in anti-viral activity of different types of IFN could result from their ability to differentially influence expression of cellular genes important for anti-viral activity. For example, treatment of the human fibrosarcoma cell line HT1080 (expressing both type I and type II IFN receptors) with IFN-b stimulated PKR which was not stimulated by IFN-a or IFN-g [30] . Since PKR was not up-regulated in the infected Caco-2 cells and virus replication progressed despite up-regulation of OAS2 and MXA, a role for PKR in SARS-CoV replication must be elucidated. Although enteric pathogens such as viruses, protozoans, multicellular helminths and enteroinvasive bacteria vary in their mode of infection, enterocytes display a common chemokine/cytokine profile in response to infection. Several ELR+CXC chemokines (containing a conserved glutamate-leucine-arginine sequence) including CXCL1 (groa), CXCL2 (grob), CXCL3 (grog) and CXCL8 (IL-8) were up-regulated in SARS-CoV infected Caco-2 cells. These chemokines mainly regulate neutrophil trafficking [31] . In addition, SARS-CoV induced in Caco-2 cells non-ELR CXC chemokines CXCL10/IFN-g inducible protein-10 (IP-10) and CXCL11/IFN-inducible T cell alpha chemoattractant (I-TAC) which are potent CD4+ T cell chemoattractants [32, 33] . Rotavirus infection was shown to induce CXCL1, CXCL8 and CXCL10 in intestinal cell lines [34] . Mucosal inflammation associated with rotavirus infection is predominantly mononuclear, i. e. consists of monocytes and T lymphocytes [35] , although neutrophil infiltration is found in some cases [34] . In contrast, biopsy specimens taken from the colon and terminal ileum of patients with SARS failed to demonstrate any inflammatory infiltrates [5] . Neutrophil infiltration in the intestine of SARS patients may be limited despite neutrophilia due to changes of cytokine/ chemokine levels in the intestinal environment. We observed that SARS-CoV infection of Caco-2 cells inhibited expression of IL-18 which is constitutively expressed in intestinal epithelial cells [36] . Suppression of IL-18 levels reduces neutrophil accumulation in liver and lungs [37] . The absence of T lymphocyte infiltration of the intestine in SARS may be a consequence of the profound decline of both CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes in the blood [38] , possibly resulting from lymphocyte apoptosis [39] . Although macrophage counts were increased in lungs [40] , macrophage infiltration was absent from the gut of SARS patients [5] . In Caco-2 cells, SARS-CoV down-regulated MIF. Recently, MIF was identified as a major factor produced by intestinal cells in response to microbial infection regulating macrophage emigration, inflammation and cell metabolism [41] . Some of the chemokines we found up-or down-regulated in vitro were also changed in serum samples from SARS patients. For example, serum levels of CXCL10 and IL-8 were increased whereas IL-18 was decreased [42, 43] . This justifies the use of intestinal cell lines as a model to study the direct effects of SARS-CoV infection on gene expression in permissive human cells. Given the intestinal tropism of SARS-CoV, the results presented here provide several important hints at possible mechanisms of intestinal pathogenesis and potential novel therapeutic targets in SARS.",
