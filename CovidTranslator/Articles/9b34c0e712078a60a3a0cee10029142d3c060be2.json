In Britain, it has occurred as periodic epizootics, the last of which was in the winter of 1980/81 . The virus may also persist within endemically infected herds (Pritchard, 1987) and in these circumstances fatalities may be much less common . At this laboratory, large numbers of samples from scouring pigs have been examined for the presence of TGEV over many years and using a variety of methods ; but very few positive identifications have been made in the last 8 years . Porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) is antigenically very similar to the virus of TGE, but it spreads aerogenically and causes mainly inapparent respiratory infections (Pensaert et al., 1986) . It is known to have been present in Britain at least since 1986 (Brown & Cartwright, 1986) and it had already become widespread in the national herd by 1987 (Brown & Cartwright, unpublished survey results) .",

            "text": "Indirect ELISAs for TGE serology were first reported before the appearance of PRCV (Nelson & Kelling, 1984) . Antibodies to TGEV and PRCV show complete crossneutralization and are therefore both detected by virus neutralization tests (VNTs) using laboratory strains of TGEV . Such tests (Paton, 1989) have been widely used, both for diagnosis in cases of respiratory or enteric disease and for export certification purposes . Serological differentiation between TGEV and PRCV is now possible using competition ELISAs and monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to TGEV-specific epitopes (Callebaut el al., 1989 , van Nieuwstadt & Boonstra, 1990 . However, the VNT continues to be necessary for investigation of respiratory disease . Furthermore, it is more sensitive than differential ELISAs examined at this laboratory and it has generally been retained as the preferred method for the export certification of individual animals . This communication describes a competition ELISA utilizing a mAb (6A .C3) directed towards a peplomer protein epitope common to TGEV, PRCV, and a number of related feline and canine coronaviruses, but not to other porcine coronaviruses (Sanchez et al., 1990) . Indirect fluorescent antibody tests using rabbit anti-mouse conjugate confirmed that the mAb recognized all TGEV/PRCV strains tested . These comprised five British isolates of TGEV and two of PRCV, five TGEVs from Bulgaria, three TGEVs from the Netherlands and a single PRCV isolate from the USSR.",

A full description of the preparation of these antigens is given in a report on experiences with a TGEV-specific, serological test that distinguishes TGEV from PRCV and which utilizes the same antigens (Brown & Paton, 1991) . Fifty microlitres of a 1 in 5 dilution of test serum were added to each of duplicate pairs of wells and left overnight at room temperature . The remainder of the test could be completed within an hour, all incubations being at 37\u00b0C . A 1/10 000 dilution of mAb 6A .C3 in PBS pH 7 .2 with 0 .05% Tween 20 (PBST) and 10% ox serum was dispensed into all wells without removing the test serum and left for 10 min . After washing, bound 6A .C3 was detected by a goat antimouse peroxidase conjugate (Nordic : 1/2000 for 30 min) and a tetramethyl benzidine/ hydrogen peroxide substrate (10 min) . The substrate reaction was stopped with 2 M sulphuric acid . PBST was used for washing the plates between stages and as the serum diluent . The conjugate diluent was PBST plus 5% negative pig serum .",

The threshold value for the test was established using 279 VNT negative (titre < 2) sera from 64 farms, all of which had no history of TGEV/ PRCV infection . Subtracting three standard deviations from the mean of these results (Savigny & Voller, 1980 ) gave a cut-off value of 50 .21% . VNT positive sera from field cases (n=167) and from pigs experimentally infected with TGEV or PRCV (n=35) all scored positive in ELISA (values : 1-49%) . Despite the good qualitative agreement between ELISA and VNT, no significant correlation was detected (coefficient=0 .072) between ELISA values and VNT titres for positive sera . Sera collected at abattoirs during 1989, from 231 sows, were examined by ELISA and 160 (69 .25%) were positive . A recent serological survey of British pigs by TGEV-specific ELISA indicated a seroprevalence of only 0 .6% (Brown & Paton, 1991) , suggesting that most TGEV/PRCV antibody positive samples reflect PRCV infection and that such infections remain common .",

Export certification involves processing large numbers of sera concomitantly and the semi-automation that can be achieved using the ELISA technique would be a considerable benefit . For differential diagnosis, this ELISA could be used in conjunction with a TGE-specific test and indeed with minimal modification both could be performed side by side on the same antigen coated plate . Since the mAb 6A .C3 is directed towards an epitope that is highly conserved amongst TGEV/ PRCVs, the risk of false negative results due to antigenic diversity amongst these viruses appears to be low .",
