In parallel, it is mandatory to continue ensuring non-postponable treatments, e.g. primary percutaneous coronary interventions or urgent/emergent cardiac surgical procedures. The particularly high mortality rates recorded in Italy among Covid-19 patients (apparently over 9% at the time of writing) 1 suggest that the actual number of people infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) may be much higher than that of confirmed cases, with a substantial number of asymptomatic or minimally/mildly",

Moreover, it has been suggested that person-to-person transmission can occur from individuals with an asymptomatic course as well as in the prodromal phase of disease 4,5 , or even after recovery. 6 Accordingly, every patient admitted to hospital with urgency/emergency criteria (e.g. acute myocardial infarction, cardiogenic shock, aortic dissection) might be potentially infected and, once transferred to either a coronary unit or ICU, may disseminate contagion among patients already admitted to these units as well as among healthcare personnel working therein, which in turn may become (or already be) subclinically infected and further contribute to the spread of infection among patients with a very high risk of a fatal outcome from SARS-CoV-2 (e.g. ",

If, as suggested, healthcare providers should be protected from subclinical SARS-CoV-2 infection 4 , also high-risk patients should be protected from new patients admitted to ICUs (who may have become infected during their previous social contacts or during admission to emergency departments in the same or other hospitals), as well as from asymptomatic or minimally/mildly symptomatic healthcare providers. During the ongoing health emergency, all new patients admitted to hospital units hosting immunocompromised, complex, critical, and, more generally, acutely ill patients should be probably initially isolated and screened for SARS-CoV-2 infection, and separate pathways should be provided until the virological test results are obtained. Moreover, since routine use of high-level personal protective equipment outside the management of suspected cases in the emergency departments and of confirmed cases within Covid-19 dedicated units is probably not feasible, healthcare providers working in other (acute care) units should be immediately turned away and screened in the presence of minimal symptoms of respiratory infection, if not routinely screened regardless of the presence of symptoms.",
