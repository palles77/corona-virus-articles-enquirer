All calves fed fresh colostrum within 6 h after birth at the amount of 5% of BW by bottle. Calves which were fed lyophilized colostrum supplement had a significant lower incidence of diarrhea in comparison to control calves. In addition, calves were received lyophilized colostrum supplement at 24 h after birth showed less incidence of diarrhea than calves fed the supplement at 48 and 72 h. According to the results of present study providing lyophilized colostrum supplement at 24 h after birth might have been preventive effect on calf diarrhea. The spray-dried colostrum supplement had not the same effect.",

This is often attributed to the low concentration of IgG offered in most commercial supplements and poor absorption kinetics (Haines et al. 1990 ). Zaremba et al. (1993) showed that administration of 85 g of dried colostrum powder did not lead to significantly higher IgG concentrations 24 h after birth than administration of 3 kg of colostrum. Morbidity and mortality rates were not significantly different among groups. However, the first group of calves that were fed with colostrum supplement alone did not receive fresh colostrum after birth in the study of Zaremba et al. (1993) . This is contrary to our study in which all calves were fed with fresh milk within 6 h of birth, and dried colostrum was used as a supplementary feeding at least 24 h after birth.",
