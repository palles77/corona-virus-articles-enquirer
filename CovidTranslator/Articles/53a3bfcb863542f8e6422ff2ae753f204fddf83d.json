Turnaround times of Laboratory based screening tests for the diagnosis of influenza may have an impact on the implementation of infection control measures and treatment. In this study the objectives included determining the correlation between the Abbott ID NOW point-of-care testing (POCT) instrument using the Influenza A&B2 test and the laboratory based GeneXpert Flu+RSV kit. In addition the impact of the POCT instrument on the prescription of antivirals and antibiotics was evaluated by comparing with practice when the instrument was not in place.",

An effective programme requires results of screening tests to be available to make decisions in a timely manner that suit the flow of newly admitted patients through the Hospital. This is difficult with laboratory-based testing, especially at weekends and evenings where limited on-call services may only be available [2] . The nicking enzyme nucleic acid (NEAR) isothermal amplification technique enables rapid amplification in a very narrow temperature range. This eliminates the need for thermal cyclers with the high-temperature DNA denaturation cycle required for polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The low-footprint bench-top instruments can provide results in 15 min in a near-patient setting. It has been previously demonstrated that POCT leads to rapid confirmation of influenza and allows informed early decision making, reducing flu contacts and bed closures [3] .",

These studies have reported influenza A sensitivity in the range of 66-100% and specificity of 55-100%, while for influenza B sensitivity ranged from 45 to 100% and specificity 54-100%. The studies comparing ID NOW with the GeneXpert have previously used nasopharyngeal swabs in viral transport medium (VTM) [6] [7] [8] . Sensitivities were reported to be lower when VTM specimens were used instead of direct nasal swabs. The assay also had lower sensitivity with samples determined to have low Flu A titers as determined by higher Ct values in rtPCR [5] .",

In this study the performance of the ID NOW Flu A&B2 versus the GeneXpert is similar to that previously reported [16, 20] . The one discordant specimen was found to have a low viral load in the nasal specimen as determined by the threshold cycle (Ct) values obtained from the GeneXpert. Analysis of the same samples on both systems ruled out any swab sampling associated bias. It is likely that the differences between the 2 methods are associated with the Ct cut-off values which are typically optimised based on the correlation with viral culture and TCID 50 /ml (Tissue culture infecting dose) values for specific viral strains. Consensus on a clinically relevant Ct cut-off for a positive specimen would be useful for assessing NAAT POCT devices.",

The amount of patients screened for influenza relative to admissions was also similar for both seasons. The average age of patients screened for influenza dropped significantly in 2018 when compared to 2017. The uptake of influenza vaccination in Ireland during the period September-December 2018 in those aged 65 years and older was 56.0% (2017/18 season 55.1%). Variation in vaccination coverage was observed between age groups, with the highest uptake (60.3%) in those aged 75 years or older [22] .
