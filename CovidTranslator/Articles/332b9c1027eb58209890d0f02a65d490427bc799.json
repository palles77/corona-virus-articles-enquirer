Thus, energy and carbon dioxide emission reduction is becoming more significant in the sustainability of urban transportation systems. However, urban transportation systems are complex and involve social, economic, and environmental aspects. We present solutions for a sustainable urban transportation system by establishing a simplified system dynamics model with a timeframe of 30 years (from 1995 to 2025) to simulate the effects of urban transportation management policies and to explore their potential in reducing vehicular fuel consumption and mitigating CO 2 emissions. Kaohsiung City was selected as a case study because it is the second largest metropolis in Taiwan and is an important industrial center. Three policies are examined in the study including fuel tax, motorcycle parking management, and free bus service. Simulation results indicate that both the fuel tax and motorcycle parking management policies are suggested as potentially the most effective methods for restraining the growth of the number of private vehicles, the amount of fuel consumption, and CO 2 emissions. We also conducted a synthetic policy consisting of all policies which outperforms the three individual policies. The conclusions of this study can assist urban transport planners in designing appropriate urban transport management strategies and can assist transport operation agencies in creating operational strategies to reduce their energy consumption and CO 2 emissions. The proposed approach should be generalized in other cities to develop an appropriate model to understand the various effects of policies on energy and CO 2 emissions.",

According to Taiwan's Statistical Abstract of Transportation and Communications [8] , the number of registered vehicles in Taiwan rose from 4.7 million in 1980 to 21.3 million in September 2014. This rise was a consequence of the increase in individual disposable income, the opening of the first national north-south expressway in 1978, and the subsequent improvement of the highway infrastructure: a second national north-south expressway, a west coast highway, and an east-west highway, among others. Along with the rapid growth of the number of motor vehicles, energy consumption in the road transportation sector reached the equivalent of 13,272 kl of oil in 2013, which was 3.37 times higher than that in 1980, and accounted for 95.75% of aggregate transport fuel demand. The amount of CO 2 emitted in the road transportation system increased at an annual rate of 4.38% per annum, from 8.2 million tons in 1980 to an estimated 33.7 million tons in 2013.",

However, interactions between various transportation subsystems are not considered. Moreover, a systematic approach covering more aspects of the urban air pollution problem is still lacking to examine the effects of various transport policies. An urban transportation system is complex and involves a variety of social, economic, and environmental issues. Interpreting the inherent mechanisms of the system and capturing the dynamic behavior of the components with analytical methods, such as decomposition analysis, grey theory, least-squares regression, and geometric average method, are not easy because the database is limited and because these subsystems are interlinked and dependent on each other. System dynamics (SD) provide a simulation platform to analyze a large-scale and complex socioeconomic system with multiple variables that change over time. With the aid of an SD model, we selected Kaohsiung as a case study to explore the effects of variations in demographics, fuel prices, and economic growth rate, among other factors, on the number of vehicles, fuel consumption, and energy-related CO 2 emissions. In addition, we developed three scenarios based on the possible policies that could be adopted by the city government to simulate their potential both for reducing the vehicular fuel consumption and for mitigating CO 2 emissions in Kaohsiung.",

An SD model was developed to explore the interrelationships among population, economy, housing, transport, and urban land in Hong Kong; the long-term constraints of and potentials for urban development yielded by the study were offered as policy suggestions for city planning [39] . Previous relevant studies rarely considered interactions among various transportation subsystems simultaneously with CO 2 emission and energy consumption.",

This study examines three main urban transportation policies in our proposed model: fuel tax, motorcycle parking management, and free bus service. Prior studies mainly investigate the effect of a particular policy, such as fuel tax in Europe and the US [57] ; parking management policies in China [58] ; and free bus policy in Japan, Belgium, and England [59] [60] [61] . A limited number of studies analyze the effect of these policies on energy consumption and CO 2 emission reduction simultaneously and compare the respective policy with the synthetic policy to compare the policy effectiveness. Our study aims to fill this research gap by developing a systematic and simplified analytical tool that can help urban planners to evaluate the influence of various transportation policies on energy consumption and CO 2 emission reduction.",

A quantitative simulation is performed to study the dynamic behavior of the interaction of interrelated components inside the system structure. The SD model analyzes a complex system with multiple variables that change over time and determines how the system is affected by the implementation of specific policies [62] . In addition, Kummerow [63] revealed that the SD model not only relatively easily incorporates qualitative mental and written information as well as quantitative data but also can be used when the database is insufficient to support statistical forecasting analysis. Thus, the SD model is an appropriate approach to display the inherent behavior and influences inside the system structure despite multidirectional dynamic interactions and the fact that life is infinitely more complicated and difficult than we can effectively simulate [21, 27, 37, 38, 53, 39] .",

The size of the human population is the foundation of a city's development, and issues such as the growth rate in the number of motor vehicles, vehicular energy consumption, and CO 2 emissions are derivatives of the interaction between human population and economic activities. Based on this assumption, the subsystem of the transportation mode and the related variables [i.e., vehicle kilometers of travel (VKT), vehicular fuel efficiency, transfer ratio among modes, emission coefficient, and other factors] were added to the model after the dynamic behavior of urban population and individual disposable income had been determined. Furthermore, using commercial simulation software (Vensim 5; Ventana Systems, Inc., Harvard, MA), the causal relationships between the various components within the system were simulated from 1995 to 2025. Vensim is herein used to develop, analyze, and package highquality dynamic feedback models. Models are constructed graphically or in a text editor. Features include dynamic functions, subscripting (arrays), Monte Carlo sensitivity analysis, optimization, data handling, application interfaces, and more options. Vensim is an interactive software environment that allows the development, exploration, analysis, and optimization of simulation models [64] . Fig. 1 shows the causal-loop of the SD model for the urban transportation system. Economic growth increases the number of motor vehicles and attracts more migrants from other cities. The amount of energy requirement and CO 2 emission will rise as the number of motor vehicles increases. However, the increase in the amount of CO 2 will reduce the growth rate of the urban population. Simultaneously, the number of motor vehicles will decrease with the reduction of urban population. Economic development affects population, wherein economic growth leads to an increased number of vehicles [15] . Therefore, we assume that economic growth positively affects the number of motor vehicles and population growth.",

Specifically, the decrease in the number of commuters who switched from using private cars to using the KMRT was estimated by combining the average number of passengers carried by the KMRT, the average number of kilometers per passenger trip, the average number of occupants per automobile, and the transfer ratio. Thus, the effect on vehicular energy consumption was calculated by multiplying the decrease in private car use and the average vehicular fuel efficiency of private cars.",

In this study, the increase in the number of motorcycles was primarily driven by individual disposable income and the size of the economically active population [76] [77] [78] [79] . As mentioned previously, fluctuations in fuel prices affect the number of private vehicles driven and the distances that they are driven. Hence, the effect of fuel prices on mode choice and mode transfer was further incorporated into the model through the operation of flow variables: mode transfer from private cars and the decrease in motorcycle use by fuel price increase (Appendix A). In addition, the formulation of vehicular fuel consumption and associated CO 2 emissions derived from the number of motorcycles was the same as that from the number of private cars, but the average occupancy rate (the number of passengers per motorcycle) and the transfer ratio between the KMRT and motorcycles were different.",

Our simulation predicted that in 2025, the population of Kaohsiung would gradually decline to 1.44 million, 54,128 fewer than today's population (Table 3 ). Global Insight projected that the annual economic growth rate of Taiwan in 2015 would be 0.07% higher than it is in 2014. However, in the next 11 years, the growth rate of the GDP of Taiwan is expected to be lower than those during the past two decades. Given this slowdown in economic activity, individual disposable income will grow at only a moderate rate. For example, our simulation predicts that the annual growth rate of individual disposable income from 2014 to 2025 will be 1.95%, which is lower than previous rates.

This growth in the number of motorcycles and private cars is attributed to the size of the economically active population, the level of individual disposable income, and the variation of fuel prices. Similarly, the simulation estimated that the number of private cars in 2025 will be 26,570, a decrease of 9.23% over 11 years. Economic weaknesses will also cause a slow growth rate (1.57%) in the number of heavy trucks until 2025, when 17,427 of such vehicles will show an increase of 18.65% compared with the number in 2014. The effect of a lower GDP growth rate on the number of light trucks will be limited because they are used for daily commodity exchanges and business transactions. The simulation showed that the number of light trucks will have grown an average of 4.15% per year and will have reached 77,198 vehicles in 2025. After 2014, the aggregate energy consumed by motor vehicles will increase by 1.15% until 2025. The aggregate increase in CO 2 emissions will be nearly 354,041 metric tons between 2014 and 2025, which is 14.59% higher than the emission level in 2014. Most of our simulated results have an estimation error lower than 5% except for rare cases. Therefore, the prediction capability of our model is acceptable [38] . The reason for the main percentage errors concentrated between 1999 and 2003 may be the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak in Taiwan between 2002 and 2003. SARS caused widespread social disruption and economic losses, and its economic effect has been considerable in Taiwan. Moreover, after Taiwan's first experience of party alternation in 2000, the government system experienced instability in the early stages that led to the negative effect on economic propensity and motor-vehicle growth. These major unusual events caused the disturbance in our model predictions during this period.",

Under these measures, the number of passengers carried by mass transit increased by about 60 million. In 2005, the Taipei City government introduced a successful parking management program that prohibits motorcycles from being parked on sidewalks and in building arcades, requires payment for roadside motorcycle parking, and offers a parking-information inquiry system. The ownership of motorcycles in Kaohsiung City is 71.5%, the highest in Taiwan. From the success of this policy, Kaohsiung introduced a similar system to other popular centers such as night markets, train stations, and department stores since April 2012 to reduce motorcycle use.",

According to the simulation, the results indicate that the number of vehicles in Kaohsiung City will decrease to 0.95 million vehicles in 2025, which is 36.6% lower than the base model (Fig. 5 ). In terms of the variation in vehicular fuel requirement, the variable will increase slightly from 908,169 kl to 916,558 kl from 2008 to 2025. Compared with the value at the end of 2025, the value is 17.8% lower than that in the reference model. The growth patterns of CO 2 emission and energy demand are similar because the variation of CO 2 levels is directly related to energy consumption. Thus, the contribution of aggregate CO 2 emission will be 2.34 million metric tons until 2025, which is lower by 0.44 million metric tons than the emission amount in the base model. From the observations of the forecasted patterns, the aggregate CO 2 emission needs to be reduced by about 0.15 million metric tons compared with the emission level in 2000. This result implies the difficulties and urgency of CO 2 mitigation in Kaohsiung City, despite the synthetic policy being considered in the SD model. Furthermore, we simulated the scenario of a fuel tax because the increase in oil prices not only influences the mode choice but also reduces the amount of vehicular energy consumption. Therefore, oil price is a relatively direct and efficient incentive for inducing consumers to reduce private vehicle use, which lowers fuel consumption and CO 2 emissions.",

For instance, the use of private cars and motorcycles decreased by 33.8% and 10.2%, but the rate of transfer from driving private cars to driving motorcycles was 28.36% when the average price of gasoline increased by 13.45%. The simulation of a fuel tax also suggests that the increase in fuel prices will lead to changes in the modal shares of the means of transport. The number of motor vehicles in Kaohsiung will decline by 13.2% in 2025, with a 0.5% decrease in the actual number of registered motor vehicles in the city between 2008 and 2025. The fuel tax will also cause a considerable reduction in the growth rates of vehicular fuel use and CO 2 emissions. The motorcycle parking management policy will also cause a 21.7% decrease in the number of motor vehicles by 2025, as well as 6.0% and 5.3% reductions in fuel demand and CO 2 emissions, respectively. An extensively implemented free bus service will reduce the number of motor vehicles and the fuel requirement by only 2.3% and 0.8%, respectively.

In terms of energy consumption, the Taiwanese economy is sensitive to oil price variations because the country lacks conventional energy resources and is highly dependent on energy imports (nearly 99% of total energy consumption). Similar to the case of South Korea, road transportation in Taiwan accounts for more than 80% of CO 2 emission of the transport sector [84] . Taiwan is not yet a member of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The country's CO 2 emission increased significantly over the past two decades, making Taiwan the 23rd largest CO 2 emitter in the world [6] . Taiwan's transportation sector accounted for 15% of the country's CO 2 emission in 2012. Taiwan, which is newly transformed from a developing country to a developed country [85] , pursues economic development even with limited energy resources. Therefore, finding a compromise between economic development and energy consumption as well as CO 2 emission is a critical issue for Taiwan. Many transferable lessons can be learned from Taiwan's experience and can be a useful reference for countries with analogous characteristics such as economic development pattern, high population density, and high energy dependence.",

For example, the equation of the decrease in private cars operating by the increase in fuel price can be measured as follows.",
