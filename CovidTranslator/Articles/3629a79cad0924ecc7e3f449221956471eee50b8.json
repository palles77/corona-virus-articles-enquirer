To determine the role of HGs in generating immunity, chickens were immunized ocularly with an adenovirus (Ad5) vector expressing the AI hemagglutinin H5 gene. The Ad5-H5 vector induced H5 transgene expression and induced H5-and Ad5-specific IgA and IgG spot-forming cells (SFCs) in the HGs. The IgA and IgG SFC peaked on day 9 for Ad5 and day 11 for the H5 protein. In addition, Ad5-and H5-specific antibodies were induced in serum. IgA in chicken tears was predominantly dimeric, while in serum monomeric IgA was most abundant. Analysis of HG mRNA confirmed expression of the polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (pIgR). These data demonstrated the importance of HGs to generate mucosal and systemic immunity to AI following ocular Ad5-H5 administration to chickens.",

To protect hatched chickens from AI an alternative immunization protocols to in ovo immunization would be required. Because AI virus is transmitted following exposure to mucosal surfaces, we will test the ability of the Ad5-H5 vector to induce mucosal and systemic immunity in the HGs of chickens after ocular application. Previous studies have shown that ocular application of India ink and colloidal gold traveled up the secretory duct into the HGs [5] . Thus, this is the presumed route through which antigen enter the HGs after ocular exposure. Surgical removal of the HGs demonstrated that the main source of IgA in tears was derived from the HGs [6] . Furthermore, HGs may influence the humoral immune response in other mucosal sites, because HG-derived IgA + B cells were shown to migrate selectively to cecal tonsils [7] . Thus, the HGs seem to play an important role in generating mucosal immunity in chickens",

It is anticipated that the HGs will play an important role in the induction of protective immunity by functioning as mucosal effector sites. A previous study showed that the HG might constitute a mucosal effector site in chicken based on the observation that the J-chain is expressed in its B cells. The chicken J-chain gene displayed a high degree of homology with that of other species, and is expressed at an early stage of development of the chicken immune system [8] . Furthermore, the J-chain played an important role in polymerization of IgA and IgM and their transport across the mucosal epithelium in mammals and thus will be a requirement for transport of polymeric IgA (pIgA) across a mucosal epithelium [9] . The polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (pIgR) of chicken (Gallus gallus) was recently cloned [10] and confirmed the conservation of this mucosal transport system in avian species and its importance in protective mucosal immunity.",

The next highest molecular weight protein with an estimated MW of ~470 kDa is the most abundant protein in tears and the least abundant protein in serum. This protein was based on size, dimeric IgA associated with the secretory component (SC) of the pIgR [10, 17, 18] . The largest protein precipitated was, based on size, presumably tetrameric IgA (tIgA) [17, 18] , with an estimated MW of ~710 kDa. The tIgA was abundant in both tears and serum.

The first was published in 1998 as a research note in Poultry Science and demonstrated IgG and IgM SFC specific for infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) in the spleen [20] and formed the proof of concept that the ELISPOT was as valuable and sensitive tool to dissect the immune responses in chickens. The second publication was a more elaborate study, in which a more detailed analysis of the dynamics of infectious bronchitis virus-specific IgG SFC in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and spleen was performed [21] . Our analyses involved both IgG and the IgA SFC specific for Ad5 and AI H5 in the HGs. No previous analyses of IgA SFC in chicken have been reported nor has there been any analysis of SFC induced in the HGs. The IgA ELISPOT assay for chicken lymphocytes will be a valuable tool to better understand issues pertaining to mucosal immunity in chickens. The Ad5-H5 induced H5-specific IgA and IgG responses in the HGs were approximately 2.5\u00d7 higher than the Ad5specific responses. The IgG SFC responses in the HGs were approximately 3\u00d7 higher than the IgA SFC responses to H5 and Ad5. In addition, a strong IgG response was observed in the HGs, which was also reflected by Ad5-specific IgG antibody levels in tears. The two-day delay in the H5-specific antibody SFC response compared to the Ad5-specific response would argue that there is a delay between exposure to the Ad5 vector and expression of the H5 transgene. It is not clear why this delay would occur and this observation was different from what has been shown in mice using Ad5 [12] . Whether or not this is related to the route of infection by the Ad5 vector of chicken cells, remained to be determined.",

This illustrates the importance of IgA antibodies in tears for protection of mucosal surfaces to exposure to pathogens. From the applied point of view, these findings are relevant as they prove the feasibility of vaccinating existing (adult) chicken populations against AI with the same adenovirus recombinant technology previously reported to effectively protect chickens after in ovo vaccination.",

[17] reported secretion of a tIgA in tears with an approximately molecular weight of 650 kDa and this tIgA was not associated with a SC) of the pIgR. The intestines were the only organs, in which IgA secretion was associated with SC [10, 17, 18] . The molecular weight of this pIgA was estimated between 350 and 500 kDa [12, 17, 18] . The size of pIgA detected in tears in our study was an estimated 470 kDa, which falls within this range. The cloning of chicken pIgR enabled the demonstration of pIgR mRNA by Northern blot analyses. The pIgR mRNA was not only expressed in the intestines but also in liver, thymus and bursa of fabricius (10) . In contradiction with previous reports [17] , SC was also demonstrated to associate with bile-derived IgA [10] . Based on our analysis of immunoprecipitated IgA from tears and serum of chickens, at least three different forms of IgA are present in chickens. Based on molecular weights a monomeric form of IgA is most prevalent in serum and almost absent in tears. A dimeric IgA, based on molecular weight presumably associated with the SC, was the most prevalent form in tears when compared to serum. Finally, a multimeric, presumably tIgA was present in both tears and serum at approximately equivalent levels.",

            "text": "In addition, it was demonstrated for the first time by RT-PCR that expression of the pIgR in chicken HGs occurred. A lack of pIgR expression in the HGs would have questioned the function of pIgR in chicken. This finding is consistent with a role of the pIgR for transporting pIgA across a mucosal epithelium into tears and with the high prevalence of pIgA in mucosal secretions of chickens but not in their serum. In serum monomeric IgA (mIgA) prevails. This same scenario was found in mammals. Thus, the lack of a hinge region in chicken IgA [26] , the region most susceptible to proteolysis in mammals, did not alter the association of pIgA with the SC in mucosal secretions. If association with SC did not provide the avian pIgA more protection against proteases, it raised the question whether or not its sole function was transport of pIgA across the epithelium. It is interesting in this context that both dimeric IgA and pentameric IgM are transported across mucosal epithelium by the pIgR in mammals. Pentameric IgM required a J-chain for proper assembly, while hexameric IgM did not contain a J-chain [27, 28] . The J-chain is highly conserved in chicken when compared to mammals [4] and contained two conserved regions, which were important for interaction with the pIgR [29] . The lack of the J-chain in hexameric IgM makes it ~20-fold more efficient than J-chain containing pentameric IgM in complement fixation [27, 28] . Thus, it could be hypothesized that the J-chain in combination with the SC were bound to polymeric antibodies in order to prevent activation of complement, inflammation and associated tissue damage at mucosal surfaces. The SC may play a similar role in avian antibodies. The decrease in complement fixation in the presence of J chain may be more important for IgM than IgA, since mammalian IgA was inherently poor in activating complement. No data are available on complement fixation of chicken IgA antibodies.",

Expression of avian influenza hemagglutinin in chicken Harderian glands 9 days after ocular Ad5-H5 exposure. White leghorns were exposed to 2.5 \u00d7 10 8 infectious units of adenovirus expressing the AI hemagglutinin gene serotype 5. The tissues were fixed and 5 \u03bcm sections were obtained. The slides were stained with an anti-H5 affinity-purified rabbit-anti H5 antibodies. The Ad5-H5 exposed Harderian glands but not the controls expressed H5. Hemagglutination-inhibition (HI) titer in plasma of chickens' ocular immunized with Ad5-H5. Plasma samples were collected from control chickens (n = 11) and chickens immunized two (n = 15) or three (n = 9) times with 2.5 \u00d7 10 8 I.U. of Ad5-H5. HI titers of <1.0 Log 2 were arbitrarily assigned a titer of 0. No HI titer was detected in control chickens while the HI titer increased with each Ad5-H5 administration tested 14 days after ocular administration. Induction of Ad5-specific antibodies after ocular administration of Ad5-H5. Ad5-specific antibodies were detected by ELISA as described. The highest dilution with an OD 405 of .100 or more above background was defined as the endpoint-titer. No IgG or IgA antibody levels were detected in tears and serum from control chickens. IgA secreting cells in the Harderian glands after ocular immunization. Lymphocytes isolated from the Harderian glands 9 days after immunization were isolated and loaded on antigencoated ELISPOT plates and were incubated overnight in a CO 2 incubator. Antibody secreting cells were detected as described in Section 2. Illustrated is a representative section of a single well containing Harderian gland lymphocytes derived from control or ocular challenged chickens. H5-and Ad5-specific IgG antibody secreting cells in the Harderian glands after ocular immunization with Ad5-H5. Lymphocytes were isolated from the Harderian glands (HDGL) at various days after Ad5-H5 administration and were analyzed for antibody secreting cells for H5 and Ad5. Indicated are the mean numbers of IgG spot-forming cells per 10 6 lymphocytes and one standard error. Both Ad5-specific and H5-specific IgG antibodies are produced in the Harderian glands after ocular Ad5-H5 administration. H5-and Ad5-specific IgA antibody secreting cells in the Harderian glands after ocular immunization with Ad5-H5. Lymphocytes were isolated from the Harderian glands at various days after Ad5-H5 administration and were analyzed for IgA antibody secreting cells specific for H5 and Ad5. Indicated are the mean numbers of IgA spot-forming cells per 10 6 lymphocytes and one standard error. Both Ad5-specific and H5-specific IgA antibodies are produced in the Harderian glands and peak on day 9 and 11 after Ad5-H5 administration. Polymeric-Ig receptor expression in the Harderian glands of chickens. Total RNA was isolated from the Harderian glands of three chickens using Tri-reagent (Molecular Research, Inc.) according manufactures protocols. The RNA was reverse transcribed (+) or not (\u2212). The resulting PCR products and a 100 bp DNA ladder were separated on a 1.5% agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide. A 400 bp amplicon was observed in reverse transcribed (+) samples confirming that pIgR mRNA is produced in the Harderian glands. No product was observed when the reverse transcription was eliminated (\u2212). Immunoprecipitation of chicken IgA in tears and serum. Tears and serum were immunoprecipitated with biotinylated mouse-anti-chicken IgA monoclonal antibody and streptavidin-conjugated sepharose beads. The immunoprecipitants were analyzed by SDSpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) on a 4-12% pre-cast gradient gel. The proteins were visualized using the Silver SNAP \u00ae silverstain kit according to manufacturer protocols. Abbreviations used: monomeric IgA = mIgA; polymeric IgA = pIgA; tetrameric IgA = tIgA.",
