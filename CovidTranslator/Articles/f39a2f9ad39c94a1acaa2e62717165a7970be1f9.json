Here we describe droplet-and plate-based single cell RNA sequencing applied to ~75,000 human lung and blood cells, combined with a multi-pronged cell annotation approach, which have allowed us to define the gene expression profiles and anatomical locations of 58 cell populations in the human lung, including 41 of 45 previously known cell types or subtypes and 14 new ones. This comprehensive molecular atlas elucidates the biochemical functions of lung cell types and the cell-selective transcription factors and optimal markers for making and monitoring them; defines the cell targets of circulating hormones and predicts local signaling interactions including sources and targets of chemokines in immune cell trafficking and expression changes on lung homing; and identifies the cell types directly affected by lung disease genes and respiratory",

This is a substantial technical challenge because the lung is comprised of 45 histologically-defined cell types with diverse structures and functions that vary in abundance over five orders of magnitude 30 (Table S1 ). Here we describe a systematic single cell RNA sequencing approach toward capturing, annotating, and analyzing the expression profiles of all lung cell types. We do so by using fresh blood and lung tissue obtained intraoperatively, balancing the abundance across the major tissue compartments of the 75,000 cells analyzed, employing both broad cell capture (droplet-based) and deep expression (plate-based) scRNAseq profiling strategies, and using the distinguishing molecular features along with ascertained spatial information of the novel and ambiguous cell clusters to assign cellular identities. We identify 41 of 45 previously known lung cell types and subtypes including all but the exceedingly rare ones, plus 14 new ones. We show how this comprehensive lung cell atlas provides novel insights into the functions, regulation, and interactions of the known as well as the new cell types; into which cell types are targeted in disease and how each type can be specified in development and tissue engineering; and into organ evolution by revealing lung cell types that have been gained, lost, and altered from mouse to human. The atlas provides a benchmark for analysis of diseased lung tissue, and the approach can be readily applied to other organs to create a human molecular cell atlas.",

We acquired histologically normal lung tissue samples intraoperatively from bronchi (proximal), bronchiole (medial), and alveolar (distal) regions (Fig. S1 ) along with samples of peripheral blood and immediately began processing (Fig. 1a) . Lung samples were independently dissociated into single cell suspensions, and each lung cell suspension was then separated into epithelial (EPCAM + ), endothelial/immune (CD31 + /CD45 + ) and stromal (EPCAM -, CD31 -/CD45 -) populations by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) or magnetic-assisted cell sorting (MACS) (Fig. S2a ). This allowed us to balance compartmental representation for sequencing, which for lung is otherwise dominated by immune and endothelial cells. Index sorting further provided surface antigen levels and other cell parameters for the FACS-sorted cells. Some of the blood cells were also index sorted by FACS to balance representation of the major immune cell lineages (Figs. 1a, S2b). Sequencing libraries were prepared from MACS-sorted lung cell populations and unsorted blood cells using dropletbased 10x Chromium (10x) protocol, or from FACS-sorted individual lung and blood cells using SmartSeq2 (SS2) protocol 31 . The higher cell throughput and lower cost of 10x enabled discovery of rare cell types, whereas SS2 gave deeper transcriptomic information that aided cell classification and detection of genes expressed at low levels such as transcription factor and receptor genes. There were also platform-specific idiosyncrasies; for example alveolar macrophages were the most abundant cell type detected in 10x samples but rare in SS2 samples, whereas neutrophils were represented only in SS2 samples.

One-quarter of the classical cell types (11 of 45, 24%) previously lacked high quality single cell expression data, either because they had never been profiled or correctly annotated (mucous, capillary, bronchial vessel, airway smooth muscle, lipofibroblast, myofibroblast) or had only been profiled after culturing (artery, pericyte, mesothelium, platelet/megakaryocyte, and intermediate monocyte) (Table S1 ). The only canonical cell types not captured by our approach are extremely rare and primarily found in disease settings (tuft cells) or have structures or features that require special isolation or enrichment methods (intrinsic neurons, Schwann cells, eosinophils). This comprehensive dataset of cell expression profiles suggests novel functions, signaling interactions, and contributions to disease for many canonical cell types, such as a role for lung pericytes in regulation of microvascular tone through circulating hormones and as a culprit in pulmonary hypertension (see below).",

Approximately 4% of basal cells were in the proliferative cluster (cluster 7, 47 cells), most of which were isolated from proximal lung samples (Fig. S3b) ; this suggests that proximal basal cells are more proliferative than distal ones, consistent with immunostains for proliferation marker KI67.

Two cell clusters (29, 30) The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. . https://doi.org/10.1101/742320 doi: bioRxiv preprint S4m). Both express genes involved in canonical fibroblast functions including extracellular matrix biosynthesis, cell adhesion, and angiogenesis regulators and other intercellular signals and modulators. However the specific genes for these functions often differ, for example adventitial fibroblasts expressed different Wnt pathway modulators (SFRP2) than those of alveolar fibroblasts (NKD1, RSPO1) (Fig. S3e) . Each cluster also appears to have distinct functions: specific expression of voltage-gated sodium channel SCN7A and glutamate receptor GRIA1 suggest alveolar fibroblasts are excitable cells that receive glutamatergic input (Table S4 ). The expression profiles also suggest novel, shared immune functions including immune cell recruitment (IL1RL1, IL32, CXCL2, MHCII) and the complement system (C2, C3, C7, CFI, CFD, CFH, CFB) (Table S4) .",

We identified the most selective marker genes for each of the previously known and newly identified cell types (Fig. 4a , Table S4 ). A battery of ~200 markers can unambiguously distinguish virtually all lung cell types (Fig. 4b) , so could be used with multiplex in situ hybridization methods [46] [47] [48] to simultaneously detect in clinical specimens any alterations in their numbers, structures, and spatial relationships, ushering in a new era of diagnostic pathology. A similar compendium of cell-type-selective membrane proteins (Table   S4 ) could be used to purify or therapeutically target specific lung cell types. We also identified the transcription factors selectively enriched in each cell type (Fig. 4e, Table S4 ), putative \"master regulators\" that can be used to create each cell type by cellular reprogramming, and whose efficacy in reprogramming can be evaluated with the markers described above. We found ~400 such transcription factors (1 to 36 for nearly every cell type in our SS2 data), over half of which are novel (Fig. 4e, red text) . This includes what may be the long-sought master regulators (such as MYRF) of alveolar epithelial type 1 (AT1) cells, which comprise nearly all of the lung's gas exchange surface and are impacted in many important lung diseases, and a regulator of pericyte identity (TBX5).

Other hormones have highly specific and unexpected targets, such as somatostatin (SSTR1 expressed only in arteries), mineralocorticoids (NR3C2, goblet cells), parathyroid hormone (PTH1R, smooth muscle, pericytes), ghrelin (GHSR, neuroendocrine cells), melanocortin (ionocytes and lipofibroblasts), and gastric inhibitory peptide (GIPR) and oxytocin (OXTR) (ciliated cells). Pericytes are predicted targets of angiotensin, endothelin, parathyroid hormone, and prostacyclin, which could regulate their contractile machinery to tune alveolar perfusion ( Fig. 5b ) similar to vascular smooth muscle control of arterial flow.

Our data confirmed canonical homing interactions such as expression of CCR7 by CD4+ T cells guiding them to CCL21-producing lymphatic vessels (green in Fig. 5c ), and provides specificity for others such as CCR10-mediated plasma cell homing to epithelial mucosa through CCL28 from serous cells in submucosal glands (gold). It also predicts new interactions such as CXCR3-mediated homing of pDCs to CXCL9-expressing TREM2+ dendritic cells (blue), and CX3CR1-mediated homing of nonclassical monocytes to CX3CL1-expressing endothelial cells and airway epithelial cells (purple). The novel dendritic populations do not express CCR6 and CCR7, which guide myeloid dendritic cells to CCL21-expressing lymphatic vessels, suggesting they do not egress via lymphatics. However, all three express CCR1 (orange), which could mediate their attraction to veins that express ligand CCL23, as well as to bronchial endothelial cells (CCL14), ciliated cells (CCL15), and lymphocytes (CCL5).

Type 0 (\"conserved\") genes are expressed in exactly the same cell types in mouse and human lungs (Fig. 7d , S10b). Type 1 (\"expression gain/loss\") genes show simple gain (or loss) of expression in the lung between species, which could involve a single cell type (Type 1a, e.g. PGC expressed in human, but not mouse, AT2 cells, Fig. 7d ), multiple cell types including full tissue compartments (Type 1b, e.g. RNASE1 expressed in human, but not mouse, epithelial and endothelial cells, Fig. S10c ), or the entire lung (Type 1c, TRIM38 expressed in all human, but not mouse, lung cell types, Fig. S10c ). Type 2 (\"expression expansion/contraction\") changes involve gain (or loss) of expression in additional lung cell types such that expression of the gene expanded (or contracted) in the lung during evolution. For example, Hopx, the canonical AT1selective transcription factor in mouse, is expressed in both AT1 and AT2 cells in human (Fig.   7d ,f), implying the existence of other key AT1 transcription factors (such as MYRF (see above), which shows AT1-selective expression in both species (Fig. S9g) ) and important changes in the AT2 expression program; and expansion in endothelial cell type expression of RAMP3, a coreceptor for vasodilators CGRP and adrenomedullin (ADM), that presumably alters the pulmonary vascular response to these hormones (Fig. S10d ).",

We identified 14 novel cell populations distributed across the four tissue compartments (epithelial, endothelial, stromal, and immune) that were as distinct molecularly as the canonical cell types. These include an abundant alveolar epithelial cell type (AT2-s) intermingled with the classical cell types (AT1 and AT2), which may have stem cell function; two molecularly distinct and intermingled alveolar capillary cell types (Cap-a, Cap); new fibroblast subtypes including alveolar and adventitial fibroblasts and ones we call \"fibromyocytes\" that share markers with airway smooth muscle; and three new resident dendritic cell populations (DC-IGSF21+, EREG+, TREM2+). Each of the newly identified molecular cell types must be thoroughly characterized to define their structures, functions, stabilities, development, and role in disease, as we have done for the two types of alveolar capillary cells (Gillich et al.). If there are other human lung cell types, subtypes, or cell states, they must be exceedingly rare, fragile, region-(lobe) or stage-specific (younger or older donors), or so similar to the 58 molecular types described here that they are not resolved by current profiling and clustering methods.",

This indicates that bronchial endothelial cells are molecularly distinct cell types from their counterparts in the pulmonary circulation and lymphatics, distinguished by expression of extracellular matrix (VWA1, HSPG2), fenestrated morphology 40 (PLVAP) and cell cycle associated (MYC, HBEGF) genes (Fig. 2g). Four clusters of endothelial cells in the pulmonary circulation expressed capillary markers. Two of these (clusters 18, 19) are a pair of intermingled and intercommunicating but not interconverting alveolar capillary cell types (Cap-a, Cap), as shown by cluster-specific lineage-labeling and mapping in mice (Gillich et al); the other two (clusters 20, 21) are rare cell types showing mixed features of Cap-a and Cap cells that we call capillaryintermediate type 1 (Cap-i1) and 2 (Cap-i2).",

Other components of the hedgehog pathway were mostly conserved(Fig S10f). Extreme examples of expression switching occurred during evolution of species-specific lung cell types, such as the consolidation in expression of anti-bacterial enzymes LTF, LYZ and BPIFB1 from multiple mouse airway epithelial cells into human-specific serous cells for airway defense, and consolidation of broadly expressed lipid-handling genes (e.g. PLIN2, APOE) from mouse alveolar fibroblasts (some of which contain lipid droplets) and myofibroblasts to the humanspecific lipofibroblast to support surfactant production(Fig. S10h).",

Global signaling interactions among human lung cell types inferred from expression patterns of ligands and cognate receptor genes. Heatmaps showing number of interactions predicted by CellPhoneDB software between human lung cell types located in proximal lung regions (left panel in each pair) and distal regions (right panel) based on expression patterns of ligand genes (\"Sending cell\") and their cognate receptor genes (\"Receiving cell\") in the SS2 dataset. The pair of heatmaps at upper left show values for all predicted signaling interactions (\"All interactions\"), and other pairs show values for the indicated types of signals (growth factors, cytokines, integrins, WNT, Notch, Bmp, FGF, and TFGB). Predicted interactions between cell types range from 0 (lymphocyte signaling to neutrophils) to 136 (AdvF signaling to Cap-i1). Note expected relationships such as immune cells expressing integrins to interact with endothelial cells and having higher levels of cytokine signaling relative to their global signaling, and unexpected relationships such as fibroblasts expressing majority of growth factors and lack of Notch signaling originating from immune cells.
