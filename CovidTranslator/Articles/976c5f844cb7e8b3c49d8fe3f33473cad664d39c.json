            "text": "Group 2 coronaviruses encode an accessory envelope glycoprotein species, the hemagglutinin esterase (HE), which possesses sialate-O-acetylesterase activity and which, presumably, promotes virus spread and entry in vivo by facilitating reversible virion attachment to O-acetylated sialic acids. While HE may provide a strong selective advantage during natural infection, many laboratory strains of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) fail to produce the protein. Apparently, their HE genes were inactivated during cell culture adaptation. For this report, we have studied the molecular basis of this phenomenon. By using targeted RNA recombination, we generated isogenic recombinant MHVs which differ exclusively in their expression of HE and produce either the wild-type protein (HE \u0609 ), an enzymatically inactive HE protein (HE 0 ), or no HE at all. HE expression or the lack thereof did not lead to gross differences in in vitro growth properties. Yet the expression of HE was rapidly lost during serial cell culture passaging. Competition experiments with mixed infections revealed that this was not due to the enzymatic activity: MHVs expressing HE \u0609 or HE 0 propagated with equal efficiencies. During the propagation of recombinant MHV-HE \u0609 , two types of spontaneous mutants accumulated. One produced an anchorless HE, while the other had a Gly-to-Trp substitution at the predicted C-terminal residue of the HE signal peptide. Neither mutant incorporated HE into virion particles, suggesting that wild-type HE reduces the in vitro propagation efficiency, either at the assembly stage or at a postassembly level. Our findings demonstrate that the expression of \"luxury\" proteins may come at a fitness penalty. Apparently, under natural conditions the costs of maintaining HE are outweighed by the benefits.",

Their virions, as visualized by negative-staining electron microscopy, are roughly spherical particles measuring 80 to 120 nm in diameter. They contain a helical nucleocapsid comprised of the \u03f330-kb genome and multiple copies of a single nucleocapsid protein species, N. The nucleocapsid is surrounded by a lipid-containing envelope, which is derived from the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment and into which are embedded at least three other structural proteins. Of these, the triple-spanning membrane glycoprotein M and the small envelope protein E are pivotal for virion morphogenesis (3, 15, 25, 57) . The spike protein S, though not required for assembly, is crucial for infectivity as it mediates virus adsorption to specific host cell receptors (2, 5, 24, 28, 56, 69) and subsequent fusion of the viral envelope and the plasma membrane (for a review, see reference 10 ).",

Like the influenza virus C HE fusion protein, coronavirus HEs function as sialic acid (Sia)-binding proteins (8, 21, 35, 43, 54) , although to what extent is still subject to debate. For instance, in the case of BCoV (40) , HCoV-OC43 (23) , and MHV strains S and JHM (63) , virus attachment to Sia seems to be mediated primarily by the S protein. All coronavirus HEs, however, do display sialate-O-acetylesterase activity (22, 34-36, 43, 47, 52, 54, 58, 67) . The HEs thus serve as virion-associated receptor-destroying enzymes, and in analogy to the O-acetylesterases and sialidases of ortho-and paramyxoviruses (32, 62) , ensure that binding of viruses to cell-associated and cell-free Sias is reversible.",

Although one might interpret these findings as indicating that in murine coronaviruses, HE has become obsolete, there is good reason to assume that this protein actually contributes to viral fitness during natural infections.

In the absence of positive selection for expression, mutations in the HE gene might accumulate during multiple rounds of replication and by chance may have become fixed upon plaque purification. Alternatively, however, under in vitro conditions the loss of HE might actually provide a gain of fitness. Either way, to further our understanding of coronavirus replication and evolution, it is important to explore the molecular basis of this phenomenon.",

Evidently, the benefits and possible consequences of HE expression during in vitro and in vivo replication would be best studied using isogenic recombinant viruses which differ solely in their expression of this protein. For this study, we have used targeted recombination (24) to generate MHV-A59 derivatives which express either the wild-type HE protein, an enzymatically inactive HE protein, or no HE at all. A detailed comparison of the in vitro growth properties of these viruses is presented, including mixed propagation-competition experiments and the biochemical analysis of acetylesterase-deficient variants, which arise spontaneously during the propagation of HE-expressing recombinant MHVs (rMHVs). We demonstrate that during propagation in cultured cells, rMHVs that express HE have a disadvantage compared to isogenic HE-deficient viruses. Mechanisms by which HE might decrease viral fitness in vitro are discussed.",

The other mutant gene, HE 0 , carried a double mutation at nucleotides 134 and 135 (AGT3ACG), resulting in the replacement of the active-site Ser 45 (60) by Thr. The HE genes were used to create transfer vectors pMH 54 HE \u03e9 , -HE 0 , and -HE \u03ea (Fig. 1A) .

However, during serial passaging of rMHV-HE \u03e9 viruses (with each passage involving a multistep infection of LR7 cell monolayers after inoculation at an MOI of 0.01 PFU/ cell), we consistently noted the emergence and rapid accumulation of O-acetylesterase-deficient mutants (Fig. 5B) . These mutants increased in the population at a relative rate of \u03f31. 66 per passage compared to the parental virus.

Accordingly, the number of Oacetylesterase-deficient plaques in the starting inoculum (passage 0) increased \u03f35%. However, O-acetylesterase-deficient plaques accumulated during the subsequent five passages at a similar, and in fact, slightly reduced, rate to that seen during serial passaging of rMHV-HE \u03e9 alone (Fig. 5B) . This is precisely as predicted if the increase in O-acetylesterase-deficient viruses during mixed passaging is due exclusively to the accumulation of the spontaneous HE-deficient mutants already present in the rMHV-HE \u03e9 stocks. These observations were reproducible with two additional combinations of independently isolated rMHV-HE \u03e9 and -HE 0 recombinant viruses (Fig. 5C ); note that in these last experiments, the initial inoculum contained HE \u03e9 and HE 0 viruses mixed at ratios of approximately 1:4 to dampen the influence of the spontaneous acetylesterase-deficient mutants in the rMHV-HE \u03e9 stocks. We concluded that viruses expressing an enzymatically inactive HE replicate with equal efficiencies as syngeneic viruses with a functional O-acetylesterase.",

One of these is HE, an envelope glycoprotein with sialate-O-acetylesterase activity which only occurs in group 2 coronaviruses. The expression of HE is thought to increase viral fitness during natural infection. However, in various cell culture-adapted murine coronavirus strains, including MHV-A59, the HE gene has been rendered inactive by mutations (30, 66) . Here we provide an explanation for this phenomenon by demonstrating that during propagation in cell culture, MHV-A59-derived rMHVs which express a properly folded HE have a replication disadvantage compared to isogenic HE-deficient viruses. Our data show that although the parental MHV-A59 strain has lost HE expression, it can still efficiently incorporate the HE protein into its virion, thus confirming and extending observations by Liao et al. (29) . rMHVs expressing either wildtype HE or the enzymatically inactive derivative HE 0 incorporated the HE protein into the viral envelope in quantities similar to those found for the naturally HE-expressing strain MHV-S. In immunopurified virus particles, the HE, N, and M proteins were determined to be present at a ratio of \u03f30.4:1: \u03f32.6. Note that the estimated stoichiometry of N and M in these MHV preparations is in good agreement with that determined for transmissible gastroenteritis virus (1:3) (14). Lowmultiplicity serial passage experiments with rMHV-HE \u03e9 variants showed, however, that HE expression was not stable. In plaque-purified virus stocks, O-acetylesterase-deficient mutants arose spontaneously and rapidly replaced the parental virus. This phenomenon appeared to be cell type independent, as a progressive loss of O-acetylesterase activity was observed not only during serial passaging of rMHV-HE \u03e9 in LR7 cells, but also during propagation in Sac(\u03ea) and 17ClI cells (data not shown). The rates at which these mutants emerged and accumulated as well as their limited genetic diversity (further discussed below) strongly argue against models in which the loss of HE is explained by a probabilistic accumulation of neutral mutations. Apparently, the expression of HE affects viral fitness in vitro, with \"fitness\" being defined here as the relative replication capacity of virus populations during mixed propagation (13, 18) . At first glance, our findings might be interpreted to indicate that the enzymatic activity of HE has a negative effect on viral replication. However, a direct comparison in competitionpropagation experiments, which allowed a reproducible quantitative assessment of differences in the relative fitness of virus populations (18) , showed that rMHV-HE 0 and rMHV-HE \u03e9 viruses replicated at equal rates. In contrast, HE-deficient rMHV-HE \u03ea viruses grew more efficiently than rMHV-HE \u03e9 . These combined observations lead us to believe that it is not the O-acetylesterase activity, but rather the expression of an intact HE per se, that reduces viral fitness in vitro.",

Still, this does not seem to be the case. The spontaneous mutants that replaced rMHV-HE \u03e9 during serial passaging produced large quantities of HE proteins which were defective but nevertheless (almost) full-sized. Of the two types of mutants identified, one had a frameshift mutation immediately upstream of the transmembrane domain, and as a consequence, expressed an anchorless protein; the other had suffered a single Gly 24 3Trp substitution in HE. Saliently, Gly 24 is the C-terminal residue of the signal sequence (16) . Apparently, either mutation caused the HE protein to misfold, resulting in a loss of O-acetylesterase activity and, more importantly, exclusion from the assembly process: both mutants produced virions that lacked the HE protein. While in the case of the anchorless HE, this is no surprise, it is intriguing that a single mutation within the signal peptide of HE has the same effect. Preliminary experiments indicated that the mutation does not prevent removal of the signal sequence (Lissenberg and de Groot, unpublished data) but that cleavage most likely occurs at an alternative site.",

            "text": "We propose that the reduction of in vitro propagation efficiency associated with the expression of wild-type HE is related to the incorporation of this protein into virus particles. HE might exert this effect at the level of virion assembly, for example, by reducing the number of progeny viruses per cell, or at a postassembly level, for instance, by decreasing the specific infectivity of virus particles. In our serial passage experiments, viruses that lacked HE in their envelopes produced approximately 1.7 times more PFU per passage than rMHV-HE \u03e9 . It is noteworthy, however, that each passage entailed a multistep infection initiated at a low multiplicity (0.01 PFU/cell). Consequently, the actual difference in replication efficiency between HE \u03e9 and HE \u03ea viruses per single round of infection will be much smaller and would go unnoticed in one-step growth experiments. Thus, our data also illustrate that even modest differences in fitness may have major consequences during prolonged viral propagation. It seems reasonable to assume that HE expression has a similar effect on the efficiency of virus propagation in vivo. Still, in naturally occurring rodent coronavirus populations, HE expression seems to be maintained. In fact, rodent coronaviruses frequently exchange HE sequences via homologous RNA recombination, which on one occasion has even led to a shift in HE substrate specificity from Neu5,9Ac 2 to Neu4,5Ac 2 or vice versa (47) . Presumably, this diversity among murine coronaviruses is brought about by immune pressure for antigenic variation. In any event, the observation that HE genes are substituted rather than lost strongly argues for an important role of this dispensable \"luxury\" protein during natural infection. Apparently, the costs of maintaining HE expression, which be- come obvious only during in vitro propagation (see below) and during experimentally induced persistent infection of the central nervous system (68) , are outweighed by the benefits under field conditions. Precisely how HE contributes to viral propagation in vivo remains to be established. Herrler and coworkers (23, 40, 42, 51) have proposed that the binding of virions to O-acetylated sialic acids is mediated primarily by the S protein. The HE would be a minor receptor-binding protein at best and would, in analogy to the neuraminidase in influenza A and B viruses, mainly function as a virion-associated receptor-destroying enzyme. This model, however, is based on studies of BCoV and HCoV-OC43; whether it holds true for all group 2 coronaviruses remains to be seen. In fact, recent reverse genetic experiments performed in our laboratory suggest that for MHV strain DVIM, the HE protein is the main sialic acid-binding protein (M. A. Langereis, A. L. W. van Vliet, and R. J. de Groot, unpublished). In the accompanying paper (19a) , we show that HE promotes the spread of MHV in the brain and that, surprisingly, this property is not related to its enzymatic activity. The combined findings lend support to the idea that MHV HE does mediate viral attachment to sialic acid after all, and by acting as a coreceptor-binding protein, might facilitate viral dissemination.",

(B and C) Relative fitness of recombinant MHVs, as measured in mixed propagation-competition assays. rMHV-HE \u03e9 was serially passaged in LR7 cells either alone or in combination with rMHV-HE 0 or rMHV-HE \u03ea , mixed at the indicated ratios. The propagation-competition experiments shown were performed with three different sets of independently isolated rMHVs (indicated by open and solid squares and triangles). Monolayers were inoculated at an MOI of 0.01. Tissue culture supernatants were harvested at 16 h p.i. and analyzed by plaque assays and in situ esterase staining. The graphs show the percentage of acetylesterase-positive plaques (y axis) in each of the passages (x axis). For graph B, at least 200 plaques were counted for each sample after every passage (average, 440 \u03ee 170), and for graph C, at least 700 plaques were counted for each sample (average, 990 \u03ee 340). FIG. 6. Spontaneous acetylesterase-deficient mutants of rMHV-HE \u03e9 produce defective HE proteins which are not incorporated into viral particles. (Upper panel) Analysis of intracellular viral proteins. Cells were mock infected (m) or infected with rMHV-HE \u03e9 (HE \u03e9 ), rMHV-HE \u03ea (HE \u03ea ), or rMHV-HE \u03e9 mutant type 1 or 2. The cells were metabolically labeled from 5 to 6 h p.i. with 35 S in vitro cell-labeling mix (Amersham), and cell lysates were subjected to RIPA with MAb 4G12-2F9 (\u2423 HE) or antiserum K135 (\u2423 A59). Precipitates were analyzed by electrophoresis in SDS-polyacrylamide gels followed by fluorography. Bands corresponding to the structural proteins M, N, HE, and S (u, uncleaved; c, cleaved) are indicated. MAb 4G12-2F9 bound a 30-kDa host cell protein in addition to the HE protein. (Lower panel) Protein content of immunopurified virions. Supernatants of metabolically labeled cells which had been mock infected or infected with rMHV-HE \u03e9 (HE \u03e9 ), rMHV-HE \u03ea (HE \u03ea ), or mutant type 1 or 2 were subjected to immunopurification with MAb J1.3 (\u2423 M) or with MAb J1.7 (\u2423 S). Precipitates were analyzed in 15% SDS-PAGE gels. Bands corresponding to the structural proteins M, N, HE, and S (u, uncleaved; c, cleaved) are indicated.",
