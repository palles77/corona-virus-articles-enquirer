In this study, we examined the roles of cellular ubiquitinating/deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs). We observed that downregulation of a cellular deubiquitinating enzyme USP11 resulted in enhanced virus production, suggesting that USP11 could inhibit influenza virus replication. Conversely, overexpression of USP11 specifically inhibited viral genomic RNA replication, and this inhibition required the deubiquitinase activity. Furthermore, we showed that USP11 interacted with PB2, PA, and NP of viral RNA replication complex, and that NP is a monoubiquitinated protein and can be deubiquitinated by USP11 in vivo. Finally, we identified K184 as the ubiquitination site on NP and this residue is crucial for virus RNA replication. We propose that ubiquitination/deubiquitination of NP can be manipulated for antiviral therapeutic purposes.

Several viruses have been shown to depend on the proteasome or certain cellular E3 ligases for entry or release (Yu and Lai, 2005; Bieniasz, 2006) . Moreover, many viruses regulate protein ubiquitination to overcome host cell defense mechanisms, including major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class-1 antigen presentation, the type-1 interferon response, and apoptosis. To this end, numerous viruses encode proteins that redirect cellular E3 ligases of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) to proteins with antiviral activity, including the tumor suppressor protein p53, the activators of transcription, and signal transducers (Lindner, 2007) . In contrast to ubiquitination, only a few examples of targeting of the protein deubiquitination system by viruses have been reported. They include the specific targeting of the cellular USP7 by the Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen-1 (EBNA1) and the herpes simplex virus type-1 (HSV-1) regulatory protein ICP0 (Everett et al, 1997; Holowaty and Frappier, 2004) .",

For human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) Tat protein, it was observed that the addition of a single ubiquitin molecule to its C-terminus increased its transcriptional function (Bres et al, 2003) . However, for HTLV-1 Tax protein, monoubiquitination led to a lower transcriptional activity (Peloponese et al, 2004) . In addition, HIV-1 Gag monoubiquitination is important for virion formation (J\u00e4ger et al, 2007) . Recent studies also found that ubiquitination was required for efficient replication of coxsackievirus B3. The data suggested that proteasome inhibitors reduced coxsackievirus B3 replication through inhibition of viral RNA transcription and protein synthesis (Si et al, 2008) . The similar result has also been observed for influenza A virus (Rodriguez et al, 2007) , in that the viral protein synthesis was inhibited by treatment with MG132 (Z-Leu-Leu-Leu-al). This result indicated that the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway may be involved in influenza A virus replication in the early phase of viral life cycle.",

The assay is based on the determination of cell viability ratio of specific cellular gene knockdown cells infected with or without influenza A virus. During assay development (Figure 1 ), we defined optimal detection method, plating density, optimal multiplicity of infection (MOI), and positive lentivirus knockdown clone control. A549 cells cultured in a 96-well plate were first infected with specific lentivirus clones at MOI of 2. Each clone was represented by four replicas and selected by puromycin treatment (4 mg/ml). After 3 days, two of the four wells were infected with influenza A virus (A/ WSN/33, H1N1) at MOI of 1. At 24 h after infection, cell viability assay was performed and cell viability ratio between cells infected with and without influenza A virus was calculated. Under normal condition, the ratio is 0.5-0.6. The positive control of screening panel used was ISG15, which is a well-characterized cellular inhibitor of influenza A virus infection (Lenschow et al, 2007) . As expected, when cellular ISG15 was knocked down, the cell viability ratio was decreased to about 0.28, indicating that more cells were killed by influenza A virus infection in the absence of ISG15. As ISG15 is an ubiquitin-like protein, we hypothesized that other ubiquitin-like proteins may also be involved in influenza A virus life cycle. Therefore, we chose a DUB (deubiquitinating enzyme) RNAi library subset for screening. There are 262 clones in the TRC RNAi DUB library that includes 52 human DUB genes (Supplementary Table I ). The criterion for determining hits of screening was set at more than 30% reduction or increase in cell viability ratio. There were five separate clones for each DUB gene; those with three or more clones conforming to the criterion were considered as candidate genes. On the basis of this criterion, a novel cellular deubiquitinase, USP11, was identified as a candidate gene regulating influenza A virus replication or production.",

We therefore studied the possible mechanism of inhibition by the USP11 RNAi in detail. The immunoblotting result showed that, among the five shUSP11 clones, clone 5 has the best knockdown efficiency ( Figure 2A ). Therefore, clone 5 was used for further studies. To verify that USP11 is involved in influenza A virus infection, USP11 knockdown cells were infected with influenza A/WSN/33 virus at MOI of 1. At 24 h after infection, the culture medium was collected and plaque assay was performed to determine virus titers. The result showed that when cellular USP11 was knocked down, the virus titer was increased by about 10-fold ( Figure 2B ). In addition, when USP11 was overexpressed in 293T cells, the influenza A virus production was reduced to about 20% ( Figure 2C ). Significantly, when the shUSP11-5-expressing cells were transfected with pCI-USP11s, which can express an USP11 form that is resistant to shUSP11 suppression because of the wobble mutations, the influenza A virus titer dropped to the same level as in the wild-type cells ( Figure 2D ). This rescue experiment confirmed that the effect of lentivirus shUSP11-5 clone was specifically due to knockdown of USP11. Taken together, we conclude that USP11 can inhibit influenza A virus production.",

            "text": "The immunofluorescence staining result showed that USP11 primarily was located in the nucleus of cells as previously reported (Ideguchi et al, 2002 ; data not shown). Therefore, to determine the role of USP11 in influenza A virus life cycle, we first focused on viral replication and transcription, which take place in the nucleus. USP11 knockdown cells were infected with influenza A virus at MOI of 5 for single-cycle virus infections. At 8 h after infection, total cellular RNA was used for primer extension analysis to detect viral segment 6 (NA) vRNA, cRNA, and mRNA using respective primer sets (Chan et al, 2006 ; Figure 3A , left panel). The levels of vRNA and cRNA in USP11 knockdown cells were significantly higher than those of the control cells, but the mRNA amount was almost the same between the control and USP11 knockdown cells. We also developed a quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) procedure to verify the reduction of vRNA. The qRT-PCR protocol was modified from the published data (Tseng et al, 2008) by designing specific tagged primer to detect vRNA (Supplementary Table II ). The qRT-PCR result confirmed the primer extension data ( Figure 3A , right panel). To elucidate whether the inhibition of influenza A virus replication by USP11 required the deubiquitinating enzyme activity of USP11, a catalytically defective mutant (C275S and C283S) of USP11 was transfected into A549 cells. The cells were infected with virus at MOI of 5 for single-cycle virus infections. The level of vRNA and cRNA in the cells overexpressing the wild-type USP11 were reduced to about 50% of the control cells ( Figure 3B ), but there was no significant reduction of vRNA or cRNA in cells expressing the catalytically defective USP11 mutant ( Figure 3B , lane 2). The result indicated that USP11 inhibited vRNA and cRNA synthesis, but USP11mt did not. Therefore, we concluded that the inhibition of influenza virus RNA replication by USP11 depended on its deubiquitinating enzyme activity. In this particular experiment, there was a slight decrease of viral mRNA in the USP11-overexpressing cells. This reduction could have been a secondary effect of reduction of vRNA by USP11, as mRNA is made using vRNA as the template. To address this possibility, we further dissected the viral transcription activity independent of the virus genome replication by determining the level of viral mRNA synthesis in the presence of cycloheximide (CHX). It has been shown that CHX suppresses viral protein synthesis, and thereby inhibits virus genome RNA replication but not mRNA transcription because the latter does not need new protein synthesis (Vreede et al, 2004 that in control cells ( Figure 3C ). Taken together, the result indicated that USP11 primarily inhibits influenza A virus RNA replication through its deubiquitinating enzyme activity.",

We hypothesized that one or more of the RNP complex subunits may be a candidate substrate for USP11 and that ubiquitin is required for influenza A virus RNA replication. To verify this hypothesis, we first attempted to detect ubiquitinated viral protein in the cells. Ubiquitin (Ub) was coexpressed with PB2-HA, PA-HA or NP-HA, respectively, in 293T cells, and the HA-tagged immunoprecipitates were subjected to immunoblot analysis with anti-HA or anti-NP antibody, respectively. The results showed that, for NP, besides the 56-kDa NP, an additional band with a size (65 kDa) consistent with the monoubiquitinated form of NP was detected when it was coexpressed with ubiquitin ( Figure 5A , lanes 7 and 8). This result suggested that NP is monoubiquitinated. In addition, when PA was cotransfected with Ub, a high-molecular weight smear was detected by anti-HA ( Figure 5A , lane 6) and anti-myc antibodies ( Figure 5C lower panel, lane 2), respectively, indicating that PA is a polyubiquitinated protein.

The results showed that when K184 was substituted with arginine, the replication and transcription activities were decreased to 30% (Supplementary Figure 1) , indicating that K184 is important for viral RNA replication, consistent with a recent study (Wasilenko et al, 2009 ), but inconsistent with another report (Li et al, 2009b) . We repeated the same minireplicon experiment in USP11 knockdown cells ( Figure 6C ), and co-transfected a plasmid that can express Ub as a control (grey bars). The result showed that the luciferase activity of the K184 mutant was as low as 15% of the wild-type construct in USP11 knockdown cells. The difference of 30 versus 15% between the two approaches suggests that USP11 may have additional targets in the cells. In addition, it is noted that the luciferase activity of K184R mutant was not affected by overexpression of ubiquitin, whereas the luciferase activity was increased in WT and most of the other NP mutants (including K113R, K229R and K325R). These data taken together support the hypothesis that the replication defect in K184R was most likely due to the failure of ubiquitination. Among these NP mutants, the K273R mutant was totally devoid of luciferase activity, indicating that K273 is crucial for viral genome replication and/or transcription for reasons other than ubiquitination, consistent with the previous studies that demonstrated that this mutation blocked the interaction of NP with two of the polymerase subunits (PB1 and PB2; Biswas et al, 1998; Li et al, 2009b) .",

The amounts of cRNA and vRNA increased from 0 to 8 h after infection as RNA replications proceed (lanes 1, 3, 5 and 7 for wild-type RNA, and lanes 2, 4, 6 and 8 for the mutant RNA, respectively). Significantly, the vRNA and cRNA amounts of K184R mutant were less than those of the wild type at each time point (except 0 h), indicating that K184R mutant virus is defective in virus RNA replication, most likely due to lack of ubiquitination. In contrast, the mRNA amount was very similar between K184R mutant and wild-type throughout (lanes 3-8), suggesting that NP ubiquitination is not involved in viral mRNA transcription. We also performed qRT-PCR to detect vRNA ( Figure 6G , right lower panel); the result showed that at 10 h after infection, the vRNA amount was decreased to about 25%, but at this time point, the mRNA amount also decreased, probably as a secondary effect of reduction of vRNA.

USP11 knockdown or control cells were infected with wild-type or NP-K184R mutant virus at MOI of 5, and total cellular RNA was used for primer extension and qRT-PCR analysis at 8 h after infection. When cellular USP11 was knocked down, the amounts of vRNA and cRNA of the wild-type virus increased by about 2.5-fold ( Figure 7A, lane 1 versus lanes 2 and 3) , indicating that USP11 inhibits viral RNA replication as previously mentioned; with the mutant virus defective in NP ubiquitination (K184R), however, there was no significant difference in viral RNA synthesis between USP11 knockdown and control cells ( Figure 7A, lanes 4-6) . Furthermore, the amounts of viral RNA of K184R mutant were lower than the wild type (about 25% of the wild-type cells infected with the wild-type virus; see lane 3). In addition, the difference in the amount of vRNA between wild-type and K184R mutant viruses was about 10-fold in USP11 knockdown cells (lane 1 versus lane 4). We also performed a converse experiment, namely, USP11-overexpressing or control cells were infected with wild-type or K184R mutant virus ( Figure 7B ). The amount of vRNA and cRNA of wild-type virus in the cells overexpressing the wild-type USP11 were reduced to about 50% of that in the control cells ( Figure 7B , lane 1 versus lane 3), or in the cells expressing the catalytically defective USP11 mutant (lane 2). In contrast, overexpression of USP11 did not affect the amount of vRNA and cRNA of K184R mutant virus (lanes 4-6). Interestingly, the amount of wild-type vRNA in the USP11 overexpressing cells was almost the same as that of K184R mutant (lane 1 versus lane 4). The results were consistent with mini-replicon data ( Supplementary Figures  2 and 3) . These results combined suggest that USP11 inhibits viral RNA replication through deubiquitinating NP. As a consequence, once NP ubiquitination was defective, such as in K184R mutant virus, the effect of cellular USP11 inhibition was diminished. This result further supports the conclusion that USP11 inhibits viral RNA replication through deubiquitinating NP.",

Polyubiquitin chains of four subunits or longer are required for efficient recognition and degradation of ubiquitinated proteins by the proteasome. Other functions of ubiquitin that do not involve the proteasome have also been demonstrated. Some proteins are modified by a single ubiquitin or short ubiquitin chains. Instead of sending proteins to their death through the proteasome, monoubiquitination is a regulator of the location and activity of diverse cellular proteins. Histone is a well-characterized monoubiquitinated protein. Previous studies have shown that ubiquitination may alter conformation or oligomeric state of histone, and thus affect protein-protein or protein-nucleic acid interactions (Hicke, 2001) . The proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) is another example of monoubiquitinated modification of regulation. PCNA is loaded onto DNA strands as a trimeric ring in which it functions as a clamp and processivity factor for DNA polymerase. It is essential for DNA replication, DNA repair and silencing. After exposure of human cells to DNA-damaging agents that block the progress of the replication fork, monoubiquitinated PCNA mediates the switch from replicative DNA polymerases to polymerases specializing in translesion synthesis (Kannouche et al, 2004) .",

The treatment of host cells with MG132 or another proteasome inhibitor lactacystin affected the early stages of virus replication. The confocal laser scanning microscopic images showed that influenza virus selectively uses the ubiquitin/vacuolar protein-sorting pathway for entry into host cells (Khor et al, 2003) . Recently, Shaw et al (2008) used two complementary mass spectrometry approaches to perform a comprehensive proteomic analysis of purified influenza virus particles. Ubiquitin is among the 36 host-encoded proteins in influenza virus particles. In this study, we have identified the deubiquitinating enzyme USP11 as a new cellular factor involved in influenza A virus RNA replication. It can interact with PB2, PA and NP proteins, which are subunits of the viral RNP complex. Furthermore, it could cleave monoubiquitin from NP protein specifically. We have further tested other deubiquitinase, including USP10 and USP32, neither of which can regulate influenza virus RNA replication (CS Tseng, unpublished observations).",

It contains both Cys and His boxes, which are responsible for its deubiquitinating activity. It is a ubiquitious protein distributed across a wide range of human tissues and localized in the nucleus. It has been demonstrated that USP11 interacts with RanBPM, a Ran-binding protein, which is required for correct microtubule nucleation (Ideguchi et al, 2002) . The published result also showed that USP11 participates in DNA-damage repair functions within the BRCA2 pathway independently of BRCA2 deubiquitination (Schoenfeld et al, 2004) . USP11 also regulates the IkB kinase-a (IKKa)-p53 signalling pathway in response to tumor necrosis factor-a (TNFa; Yamaguchi et al, 2007) . Recent studies further showed that USP11 can stabilize HPV16-E7 and further regulate its biological activity (Lin et al, 2008) . Interestingly, two groups also observed that USP11 is required for West Nile virus and hepatitis C virus infection, but the mechanism remains unknown (Krishnan et al, 2008; Li et al, 2009a) .",

            "text": "The influenza A virus nucleoprotein (NP) is a 56-kDa basic RNA-binding protein, which is phosphorylated in vivo (Wright et al, 2007) . It binds single-stranded RNA with no sequence specificity through the interactions between its basic residues and the phosphodiester backbone with stacks between its aromatic residues and nucleotide bases (Ye et al, 2006) . The N-terminal 180-amino-acid portion of NP bears an RNA-binding domain, which can be subdivided into two smaller regions (residues 1-77 and 79-180), and retain RNA-binding activity (Albo et al, 1995) . Owing to its binding to ssRNA, NP is able to self-associate to form large oligomers. In addition, NP can interact with a variety of other macromolecules of both viral and cellular origin. It has been shown that NP interacts directly with PB2 and PB1 but not with PA (Biswas et al, 1998) , and that M1 interacts with RNP complex specifically through an interaction between M1 and NP (Ye et al, 1999) . It is believed that the interactions between NP and M1 are required for virion assembly. Furthermore, NP can interact with several cellular proteins, including filamentous (F) actin (Digard et al, 1999) , nuclear import receptors of the importin-a class (O'Neill and Palese, 1995) , the nuclear export receptor CRM1 (Elton et al, 2001) The RNP complex is the basic functional unit for replication and transcription of influenza viral genome. Previous data have shown that the template-size RNA can not be synthesized if there is no NP in the RNP complex (Honda et al, 1988) , and NP is essential for the synthesis of vRNA and cRNA (Shapiro and Krug, 1988) . Several hypotheses have been proposed for the role of NP in the switch between mRNA and cRNA synthesis (Portela and Digard, 2002) . The encapsidation hypothesis proposes that NP does not have a regulatory function but is merely an essential co-factor to coat the nascent cRNA and vRNA segments (Shapiro and Krug, 1988) . The template modification hypothesis considers that NP regulates transcription initiation and termination by interaction with template RNA to change its structure (Hsu et al, 1987; Klumpp et al, 1997) . The polymerase modification hypothesis proposed that the ability of NP to bind directly to PB1 and PB2 alters the transcription activity of polymerase through direct protein-protein interaction (Biswas et al, 1998) . Moreover, a recent study showed that a direct interaction between NP and the viral polymerase results in a modification of the polymerase in favour of unprimed initiation (Newcomb et al, 2009) .",

            "text": "Our results have shown that USP11 inhibited influenza A virus RNA replication and that NP is a monoubiquitinated protein that can be deubiquitinated by USP11 specifically. We have also identified K184 as the ubiquitination site of NP. When K184 was mutated, the viral genome replication was inhibited, consistent with the recently published data (Wasilenko et al, 2009 ). However, the extent of interaction between NP-K184R and virus polymerase is similar to that between the wild-type NP and the polymerase. The result is consistent with a previous study that demonstrated that the fragment of NP interacting with the viral polymerase did not include K184 (Biswas et al, 1998) . In addition, protein structural studies with influenza A virus NP revealed that the potential RNA-binding pockets consist of several positively charged amino acids, including K184 (Ye et al, 2006) . The positive charge of K184 may facilitate binding of the negatively charged RNA. However, our data showed that even when K184 was substituted with positively charged arginine, the vRNA-binding affinity and virus RNA replication were still defective, indicating that the defect in RNA replication was caused by reduction of vRNA-binding affinity through impaired NP ubiquitination. It should be noted that protein modification, such as ubiquitination, is a dynamic process, constantly being ubiquitinated and deubiquitinated. Therefore, even though our biochemical studies showed that only a small fraction of NP is ubiquitinated, a larger fraction of NP molecules could, in fact, be ubiquitinated. Vreede et al (2004) proposed 'stabilization' model that nascent cRNA is degraded by host cell nucleases unless it is stabilized by newly synthesized viral RNA polymerase and NP. On the basis of this model, both mRNA and cRNA are synthesized early in infection, but cRNA is degraded. However, in later infection, once viral polymerase and NP are synthesized, cRNA is stabilized as cRNP complex that can be replicated to vRNA. In addition, a recent study (Perez et al, 2010) showed that influenza A virus-derived small viral RNAs (svRNAs) can trigger the viral switch from transcription to replication through interactions with the viral polymerase machinery. Our result showed that, there were no significant differences between the interactions of NP-K184R and wild-type NP with PB2 or PB1, which are subunits of viral polymerase. In addition, our study also showed that ubiquitination of NP on K184 can alter the interactions of NP with RNA. We hypothesize that monoubiquitination of NP can alter the interactions of NP with RNA, thus stabilizing cRNA, and thereby increase RNA replication efficiency ( Figure 8A ), but not transcription. It is possible that multiple factors regulate different steps of viral RNA replication and transcription. Conversely, cellular deubiquitinase USP11 can interact with PB2, PA and NP, and thereby affect the function of RNP complex during RNA replication. Significantly, USP11 can cleave single ubiquitin from NP, and thereby inhibit the RNA replication efficiency ( Figure 8B ). This mechanism offers a new way to fine-tune viral RNA replication through NP modification. Vreede et al (2004) . Lower panel: ubiquitination of viral NP protein may increase its binding affinity to cRNA, and thereby stabilized cRNP and increase RNA replication. (B) Deubiquitination of NP by cellular USP11 may lower its binding affinity to cRNA. In addition, USP11 also can interact with viral PB2 and PA protein, thereby inhibiting viral RNA replication.",
