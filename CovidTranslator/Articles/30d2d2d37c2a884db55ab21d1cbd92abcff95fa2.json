The present study was designed to determine the effect of HGF on cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and to explore the combined effect of HGF and Ang II on cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. Primary cardiomyocytes were isolated from neonatal rat hearts and cultured in vitro. Cells were treated with Ang II (1 \u00b5M) alone, HGF (10 ng/mL) alone, and Ang II (1 \u00b5M) plus HGF (10 ng/mL) for 24, 48, and 72 h. The amount of [ 3 H]-leucine incorporation was then measured to evaluate protein synthesis. The mRNA levels of \u03b2-myosin heavy chain and atrial natriuretic factor were determined by real-time PCR to evaluate the presence of fetal phenotypes of gene expression. The cell size of cardiomyocytes was also studied. Ang II (1 \u00b5M) increased cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. Similar to Ang II, treatment with 1 \u00b5M HGF promoted cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. Moreover, the combination of 1 \u00b5M Ang II and 10 ng/mL HGF clearly induced a combined pro-hypertrophy effect on cardiomyocytes. The present study demonstrates for the first time a novel, combined effect of HGF and Ang II in promoting cardiomyocyte hypertrophy.",

            "text": "Myocardial hypertrophy is defined as a thickening of the myocardium, which results in a decrease in the size of the chamber of the heart, including the left and right ventricles, and is an important risk factor for subsequent cardiac morbidity and mortality. The pathophysiology and role of cardiomyocyte hypertrophy in heart disease have been intensively investigated; however, to date they are only partially understood. Cardiac hypertrophic growth is the primary responsive mechanism by which the heart reduces stress on the ventricular wall. Conventional views suggest that cardiomyocyte hypertrophy is a compensatory response to increased hemodynamic overload, which leads to cardiac disease. However, recent findings in genetic animal models of myocardial hypertrophy as well as human studies have revealed support for a molecular basis whereby either compensatory or maladaptive forms of hypertrophy exist, and only the latter lead to cardiac failure (1) . In the case of myocardial infarction, hypertrophic responses occur in cardiomyocytes in the surviving portion of the ventricle, and ventricular dilatation follows as a result of re-organization of the myocardium, including cardiomyocytes and mesenchymal cells in combination (2, 3) . To execute this response, the cardiomyocytes are stimulated by neurohumoral factors and subsequent intracellular reactive cascade systems. All of these processes entail an increase in protein synthesis as well as the size and architectural rearrangement within individual cardiomyocytes.",

In cultured cardiomyocytes, Ang II was shown to directly induce the gene expression of \u03b2-myosin heavy chain (\u03b2-MHC) and atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) (4) and also increase protein synthesis and protein content (5) through the activation of angiotensin receptor I. More detailed mechanisms have been described in recent years, including involvement with mitochondrial oxidative stress (6), autophagy (7, 8) , p70-S6 protein kinase (9), nitric oxide (10), focal adhesion kinase (11) , and AMP-activated protein kinase (12, 13) . In fact, in addition to Ang II, large numbers of intracellular or extracellular factors affect cardiomyocyte hypertrophy in vivo (14) . Moreover, the influence of these factors on Ang II-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy is largely unknown.",

It was initially isolated from fibroblasts and was shown to stimulate the motility of epithelial cells and to have a wide range of effects on many biological processes (15) . Specifically, HGF acts primarily on epithelial cells, endothelial cells, and hematopoietic progenitor cells (16) . It has been shown to have a major role in embryonic organ development, adult organ regeneration, and wound healing (16) . In recent years, the impact of HGF on the heart or cardiomyocytes has been gradually uncovered. HGF protects the heart from ischemic/reperfusion injury, attenuates cardiac remodeling, improves angiogenesis, and induces endothelial progenitor cell mobilization (16) . In our study, we first determined the effects of a single treatment of Ang II or HGF on cardiomyocytes and then examined whether the combined treatment of Ang II and HGF differed from each factor administered individually.",

To our surprise, the HGF-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy was even greater than Ang II-induced hypertrophy ( Figure 1A-C) . The presence of the HGF receptor on cardiomyocytes was first confirmed by Akiyama et al. (28) . Subsequently, several independent reports have demonstrated a protective effect of HGF on myocardial infarction in vivo (29, 30) . However, as yet the underlying mechanisms for the pro-hypertrophy of cardiomyocytes are not clear. Moreover, the results of in vivo experiments cannot exclude the possibility that HGF treatment stimulates cardiac fibroblasts (31) and thereby releases factors that induce hypertrophy of the surrounding cardiomyocytes. Pathological cardiomyocyte hypertrophy is characterized not only by an increase in cardiomyocyte size, but also by cardiomyocyte gene reprogramming, as shown by the enhanced expression of fetal phenotypes of genes, such as skeletal \u03b1-actin, \u03b2-MHC, and ANF (32) . In our study, we evaluated cell hypertrophy by determining [ 3 H]-Leu incorporation and the average cell size as well as ANF and \u03b2-MHC mRNA levels. Based on these various parameters, we have clearly shown that HGF can directly induce cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. It should be noted that Nakamura et al. (33) demonstrated an interference of administered HGF on cardiomyopathy remodeling in hamster hearts. The authors found a direct negative effect of HGF on the transcript levels of ANF. In the present study, we showed an inductive effect of HGF on ANF levels, in agreement with a previous report (34) . We considered that this disparity might be due to the species difference.",

Importantly, we found a combined effect of HGF and Ang II on cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. The roles of Ang II in the regulation of the cardiovascular system under normal and pathological conditions have been well documented, and it has been well accepted that Ang II is a direct pro-hypertrophy factor in cardiomyocytes. Moreover, there is evidence that Ang II and related proteins such as interleukin-1\u03b2 and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, play key roles in cardiac fibroblast growth and collagen deposition following myocardial infarction (35) . In addition, heparin, a highly sulfated glycosaminoglycan and widely used injectable anticoagulant, was found to potently inhibit Ang II-mediated cardiomyocyte hypertrophy (36) . The interleukin-6 family of cytokines was also reported to contribute to Ang II-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy (37) . However, to the best of our knowledge, there has been no report to date on the combined effect of Ang II and any other protein on cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. More importantly, since cardiomyocyte hypertrophy is related to the pathophysiological mechanisms of many cardiovascular diseases, our findings in this study may bring new focus on HGF in treating cardiovascular diseases.",

It has been reported that post-infarction HGF gene therapy resulted in substantial cardiomyocte hypertrophy at the edges of the infarcted tissue, accompanied by the overexpression of the HGF receptor (c-Met), which is a transmembrane tyrosine kinase through which HGF activates the Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK signaling pathway, thereby contributing to myocardial hypertrophy (38) . The c-Met is also a receptor for the scatter factor (SF) (39) . The activation of c-Met by HGF/SF can elicit a variety of cellular responses including proliferation, migration, invasion, and branching morphogenesis. These processes are associated with several signaling pathways such as PI3K/Akt, Src, and STAT3 (39) . Moreover, these signaling pathways also contribute to Ang II-induced hypertrophy. Aoki et al. (40) have shown that the ERK pathway has an important role in Ang II-induced cardiac hypertrophy. Moreover, the PI3K/Akt, Src, and STAT3 pathways have also been reported to be vital controllers in Ang II-induced cardiac hypertrophy. Therefore, it may be difficult to determine the exact underlying molecular mechanisms of the combined effect of HGF and Ang II on cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. The convergence point between HGF and Ang II needs to be further elucidated in future experiments. Our study has provided the first evidence that HGF and Ang II administered in combination induce cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. This finding was supported by the changes observed in protein synthesis, the presence of fetal phenotypes of gene expression (ANF and \u03b2-MHC), an increase in cell size, and ultrastructural changes of neonatal cardiomyocytes. These results may help to improve the management and treatment of patients with cardiac hypertrophy.",
