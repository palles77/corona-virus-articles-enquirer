Dogs were actively recruited onto the study and sampled upon presentation to the veterinarian if they fell into one of three different clinical groups: (A) clinically unaffected but exposed to acute CIRD-affected dogs, (B) acute CIRD-affected dogs (0-3 days post onset of CIRD), or (C) convalescent CIRD-affected dogs (10-12 days post onset of CIRD). Details of the clinical grouping, source (i.e. clientowned, shelter/rehoming kennel, hospital, breeding kennel), recorded or estimated age, vaccination history for Bb, CPIV, CAV-2 and CDV, and clinical respiratory score (1-5) at the time of sample collection were recorded. Briefly the clinical scores described previously (Erles et al., 2003) were defined as: 1) no respiratory signs, 2) mild cough, 3) cough and nasal discharge, 4) cough and nasal discharge with depression and/ or inappetence, 5) cough and nasal discharge with depression and/or inappetence and clinical signs of lower respiratory tract disease.",

However, the high rate of CIRD observed in client-owned dogs, compared to kennelled dogs, is most likely explained by an inherent sampling bias. Healthy clientowned dogs are unlikely to have been presented or sampled as part of a normal veterinary investigation, except in some cases of multi-dog households, doggy day care etc. where CIRD has been problematic. In contrast, sampling of apparently healthy dogs in kennelled environments often forms part of a standard outbreak investigation.",

Some core vaccine formulations include CPIV but not Bb, and whilst separate modified-live intranasal vaccines for Bb and CPIV are availaible they tend to be administered only to high risk dogs (i.e. during periods of kennelling). Studies of CPIV and Bb vaccine efficacy are regulated by European monographs, requiring specific efficacy and safety requirmemnts including the onset and duration of immunity. However, published studies are limited and there is debate on the differing efficacies demonstrated (Day et al., 2016; Ellis, 2015; Ellis and Krakowka, 2012; Mitchell and Brownlie, 2015) .",

Despite evidence of a protective effect substantial proportions of CDV, CAV-2 and CPIV vaccinated dogs remained affected by CIRD, many with severe clinical signs, supporting the widely accepted view that vaccination against these key agents may reduce disease occurrence and severity in some individuals or outbreaks, but is often poorly effective in others. Differences may be a result of vaccine formulation or protocol used, the biological properties and characteristics of the agent and host, or the involvement of newly identified or emerging pathogens (Erles et al., 2004; Priestnall et al., 2014) Whilst these first two points fall beyond the scope of this study, in examining four of the most important emerging CIRD pathogens it is clear their role in CIRD may be significant for both kennelled and pet dogs. In particular CRCoV and CnPnV were highly prevalent across the different dog populations studied and their presence was positively associated with an increased occurrence and severity of clinical disease. The presence and involvement of M. cynos and influenza A in CIRD was however less apparent.",

Dogs with increasing disease severity were significantly more likely to be positive for CRCoV. Dogs with antibodies to CRCoV that developed CIRD were less likely to develop the more severe clinical signs of disease. Younger dogs (less likely to have antibodies to CRCoV) were more likely to be infected with CRCoV, and had a greater rate of occurrence of CIRD, and developed more severe clinical signs. These findings are consistent with previously published data (Erles et al., 2004 (Erles et al., , 2003 Mitchell et al., 2013a) , and strengthen the evidence for a causal relationship between CRCoV infection and CIRD, as well as for the protective effect of CRCoV antibodies against both CRCoV infection and clinical signs of CIRD in general.

Although shelter dogs and dogs from 'other sources' had significantly increased odds of being positive compared to pet dogs, the higher seroprevelce observed in dogs from 'other sources' is most likely due to the samples being derived predominantly from an outbreak of CIRD in a single veterinary hospital, where, 96% of dogs were seropositive and 33% were positive for the virus.",

In further support of this, dogs were significantly more likely to be positive for CnPnV (by PCR) if they were also positive for CRCoV (by PCR). Although only 17 such cases were observed in this study, precluding further analysis, CIRD is increasingly being considered as a complex infection where multiple agents act sequentially or synergistically to cause disease, and similar disease complexes in humans are the subject of several reviews Eg: (Bosch et al., 2013) . It is likely therefore that co-infections with both the classic and novel agents of CIRD will contribute the increased likelihood of disease onset, severity and duration of CIRD. Given the limited amount work in the field that currently addresses this point however, this should be an important focus of future. Dogs with increasing disease severity were significantly more likely to be positive for CnPnV, supporting a causal relationship with CIRD (Glineur et al., 2013; Mitchell et al., 2013b) . Following multivariable analysis no significant relationship between the presence of CnPnV antibodies and infection or disease occurrence was observed. This relationship was however significant at the univariable level consistant with other published data (Mitchell et al., 2013b) , suggesting that whilst CnPnV specific antibodies may confer some degree of protection, this was confounded in this instance by the effects of other factors. That said, it is well documented that antibody mediated immunity for related human and bovine respiratory syncytial viruses is poor, and individuals may be repeatedly re-infected throughout their lifetime with clinical signs of respiratory disease (Falsey, 2007; Hall et al., 1976; Van der Poel et al., 1993) . A number of key pneumovirus features enable them to evade and modify host immune responses as reviwed by (Collins and Melero, 2011) , and as such it would be vital to assess the genetic and antigenic diversity of circulating CnPnV strains to better understand CnPnV ecology and inform vaccine design and development.",

Of those that were, three had severe respiratory signs but two were clinically unaffected. Given the limited number of positive cases in this study it is not possible to comment on the prevalence of M. cynos or its relationship with clinical disease. However it is worth considering the limitations of the study which may have influenced this finding. Firstly, several mycoplasma species are carried by dogs, often as part of their normal respiratory flora (Chalker, 2005) , however very limited data is available regarding their serological cross-reactivity (Rosendal, 1975) . The possibility exists therefore that the use of whole cell ELISA antigen in this study may have resulted in an overestimate in M. cynos seropositivity. Secondly, oropharyngeal swabs collected as part of a standard veterinary investigation of CIRD were analysed. Previously respiratory tissues were shown to yield a much higher recovery rate of M. cynos (99.7-23.9%) compared to oropharyngeal swabs (0-0.9%) (Chalker et al., 2004) , and indeed studies that have implicated M. cynos in CIRD were based on tissue sampling, particularly of the lower respiratory tract Zeugswetter et al., 2007) , the level of M. cynos detected in this study may therefore have been vastly underestimated and highlights an important consideration for the study of M. cynos in living dogs.",

Subsequent studies from North and Central America and Asia have also identified a number of other influenza A subtypes which infect and cause disease in dogs, some of which have undergone crossspecies transmission, including possible transmission between dogs and humans (Lin et al., 2012; Song et al., 2008 Song et al., , 2012 Songserm et al., 2006) . Assays were therefore selected on the basis that they would allow for the broad detection of Influenza A rather than specific subtypes (Damiani et al., 2012; Ellis and Zambon, 2001) .In agreement with other recently published European studies (Damiani et al., 2012; Dundon et al., 2010) however very little evidence of influenza A was found in this study. All of the dogs were negative for Influenza A by PCR, and only 2.7% had evidence of exposure via antibody detection.",
