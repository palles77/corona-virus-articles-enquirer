Human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63) is an \u03b1-coronavirus that can cause severe lower-respiratory-tract infections requiring hospitalization. We report here the 3.4-\u00c5-resolution cryo-EM reconstruction of the HCoV-NL63 coronavirus spike glycoprotein trimer, which mediates entry into host cells and is the main target of neutralizing antibodies during infection. The map resolves the extensive glycan shield obstructing the protein surface and, in combination with mass spectrometry, provides a structural framework to understand the accessibility to antibodies. The structure reveals the complete architecture of the fusion machinery including the triggering loop and the C-terminal domains, which contribute to anchoring the trimer to the viral membrane. Our data further suggest that HCoV-NL63 and other coronaviruses use molecular trickery, based on epitope masking with glycans and activating conformational changes, to evade the immune system of infected hosts.",

Moreover, sequencing data have demonstrated that bats serve as a reservoir of coronaviruses that have the potential to cross the species barrier and infect humans. This phenomenon is illustrated by the observation that substitution of three amino acid residues in the spike (S) glycoprotein receptor-binding domain of the bat-infecting HKU4-CoV enhances its affinity for human DPP4 (the MERS-CoV receptor) by two orders of magnitude 5, 6 . In addition, substitution of two other residues enables processing by human proteases and allows the HKU4-CoV S protein to mediate entry into human cells 7 . As a result, cross-species transmission of coronaviruses poses an imminent and long-term threat to human health. Recombination with coronaviruses frequently involved in mild respiratory infections may potentially lead to the emergence of highly pathogenic viruses 4 . Understanding the pathogenesis, cross-species transmission and recombination of coronaviruses is crucial to prevent or control their spread in humans and to evaluate the potential for long-term emerging diseases.",

Further studies have revealed that HCoV-NL63 infections appear to be common in childhood, and most adult sera contain antibodies that neutralize the virus 8, 10 . HCoV-NL63 is a major cause of bronchiolitis and pneumonia in newborns worldwide and can cause severe lower-respiratory-tract infections that require hospitalization, especially among young children, the elderly and immunocompromised adults 11 . HCoV-NL63 infections have been reported in countries across Europe, Asia and North America, thus indicating its circulation among the human population worldwide. Other \u03b1-coronaviruses related to the human respiratory pathogen HCoV-229E have recently been identified in camels co-infected with MERS-CoV 4 , an observation further underscoring the importance of characterizing this coronavirus genus.

It also demonstrates that coronavirus S and paramyxovirus F proteins share a common evolutionary origin. Here, we set out to characterize the conservation of the 3D organization of spike proteins among coronaviruses belonging to different genera. We report the atomic-resolution structure of the pathogenic HCoV-NL63 S-glycoprotein trimer, which belongs to the \u03b1-coronavirus genus. The substantial resolution improvement as compared with earlier studies allows visualization of the S glycoprotein at an unprecedented level of detail, which is a prerequisite for guiding drug and vaccine design, and reveals both shared and unique features of the \u03b1-genus of human pathogens.

We identified these sites from both intact glycopeptides and peptides with the glycan trimmed down to the N-linked core N-acetylglucosamine moiety. The cryo-EM and MS data together provide evidence for glycosylation at 34 out of 39 possible NXS/T glycosylation sequons. The intact glycopeptides detected by MS/MS for HCoV-NL63 S expressed in Drosophila S2 cells corresponded to either paucimannosidic glycans containing three mannose residues (with or without core fucosylation) or high-mannose glycans containing four to nine mannose residues. Although glycan processing differences exist between insect and mammalian cell expression systems, the same glycosylation sequons are expected to be recognized and glycosylated in both cases. Previous reports have suggested that several coronavirus S glycans are of the high-mannose type, as a result of direct budding from the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment 27, 28 , thus supporting the biological relevance of the potential glycan structures identified.",

Because many of the observed glycosylation sites are topologically conserved among coronavirus S proteins, we suggest that the glycan footprint observed here may be representative of those of other S proteins. Besides potentially contributing to immune evasion, as discussed below, S glycans have been proposed to play a role in host-cell entry 29 via L-SIGN lectin, which is an alternative receptor for SARS-CoV 30 and HCoV-229E 27 .",

In contrast to our previous MHV S structure 18 , most of the HCoV-NL63 S 2 \u2032 trigger loop, which connects the upstream helix to the fusion peptide and participates in fusion activation, is resolved in the reconstruction (Fig. 3b) . The trigger loop runs almost perpendicularly to the long axis of the S 2 subunit and forms three helical segments before looping back to connect to the fusion peptide. Multiple arginine residues, forming two putative furin-cleavage sites, are present in the C-terminal region of the S 2 \u2032 loop (863-RNIRSSR-870), which is characterized by weaker density, as would be expected from a proteasesensitive polypeptide segment. These observations are consistent with results of previous studies suggesting that fusion activation of the HCoV-NL63 S glycoprotein occurs after S 2 \u2032 proteolytic processing at the plasma membrane (by trypsin-like proteases such as TMPRS2) or in the endosomal pathway (by furin or cysteine proteases) 15, 32 .",

Phylogenetic analyses suggest that this is a canonical feature of most \u03b1-coronavirus S glycoproteins (Fig. 4a-c) . This domain, which we named domain 0, adopts a galectin-like \u03b2-sandwich fold supplemented with a three-stranded \u03b2-sheet, similarly to domain A ( Fig. 4d-f , DALI Z score 6.7, r.m.s. deviation 3.8 \u00c5 over 147 residues), thus suggesting a gene-duplication event. Domain 0 interacts with the viral-membraneproximal side of domain A and with domain D. We determined that domain 0 is also structurally similar to the VP8* sialic acid-binding domain of the rotavirus VP4 spike protein 38 ( Fig. 4g ; PDB 1KQR, DALI Z score 8.9, r.m.s. deviation 3.0 \u00c5 over 109 residues). In line with this finding, domain 0 of transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV) and of PEDV bind to sialic acid, and deletion of this domain in \u03b1-coronavirus S appears to correlate with a loss of enteric tropism 39 . We detected no sialic acid binding activity for the HCoV-NL63 S 1 subunit (Supplementary Fig. 4) , thus possibly explaining the strict respiratory tropism of this virus. Instead, host-cell heparan sulfate proteoglycans have been shown to participate in HCoV-NL63 anchoring and infection 40 , and we detected binding of heparan sulfate to the HCoV-NL63 S protein by using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) (Supplementary Fig. 5a) . We hypothesize that these interactions may be mediated either by domain 0, which exhibits several positively charged patches on its surface ( Supplementary  Fig. 5b) , or domain A, which has been reported to bind carbohydrates in the case of a bovine coronavirus 41 .",

Superimposition of the HCoV-NL63 and MHV S 1 subunits highlights that their B domains feature opposite orientations related by an ~180\u00b0 rotation (Fig. 5a,b) . As a result, many of the HCoV-NL63 receptor-binding residues are buried through interaction with domain A of the same protomer, are masked by the glycan at residue Asn358 and are not available to engage the host-cell receptor (human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, ACE2). Comparison of the HCoV-NL63 domain-B structure in our cryo-EM-derived model with the crystal structure of the same domain in complex with ACE2 (ref. 43 ) revealed that the receptor-binding loop containing residues 531-539 undergoes substantial conformational changes after binding (and is defined by weak density ; Fig. 5c ).

            "text": "Viruses have evolved several immune-evasion strategies including rapid antigenic evolution, masking of epitopes and exposure of nonneutralizing immune-dominant 'decoy' epitopes. For example, HIV-1 (ref. 52), Lassa virus 53 , hepatitis C virus 54 and Epstein-Barr virus 55 exhibit extensive N-linked glycosylation, covering exposed protein surfaces, with glycan masses that may exceed that of the protein component. The HCoV-NL63 S trimer is covered by an extensive glycan shield consisting of 102 N-linked oligosaccharides obstructing the protein surface. This observation is reminiscent of descriptions of the HIV-1 envelope trimer 52 , although the glycan density is 30% higher in the latter case. Furthermore, our data suggest that, similarly to HIV-1, coronavirus S glycans mask the protein surface and consequently limit access to neutralizing antibodies and thwart the humoral immune response. This strategy is illustrated by the presence of a glycan linked to Asn358 in the HCoV-NL63 structure reported here. This glycan, along with the proteinaceous moiety of domain A, contributes to masking the receptor-binding loops, which have been shown to elicit potent neutralizing antibodies for other coronaviruses [44] [45] [46] [47] [48] [49] and appear to represent a potential ' Achilles' heel' of these viruses. This hypothesis is further supported by the observation of three additional glycans directly protruding from the viral-membranedistal side of domain B. As a result, conformational changes are npg a r t i c l e s required for the HCoV-NL63 S glycoprotein to be able to interact with ACE2 (ref. 43 ). These rearrangements and/or receptor binding are likely to participate in initiating the fusion reaction by disrupting the interactions formed between domain B and the HR1 C-terminal region. Interactions with heparan sulfate proteoglycans present at the host-cell surface might potentially contribute to activating HCoV-NL63 S and promote subsequent interactions with ACE2. A common theme arising from the analysis of \u03b1and \u03b2-coronavirus S-glycoprotein structures is that domain-B-mediated host anchoring involves major structural rearrangements that expose the binding motifs 18, 33 . Visualization of the glycan shield obstructing access to the S surface and deciphering the molecular trickery used by some coronaviruses provide a rational basis for understanding the accessibility to neutralizing antibodies and may pave the way for guiding future design of immunogens or therapeutics. We have previously suggested that targeting the fusion machinery bears the promise of finding broadly neutralizing inhibitors of coronavirus infection 18 , and the high density of glycans decorating this region will need to be taken into consideration to increase the likelihood of success.",

Whole-frame alignment was carried out with DOSEFGPU DRIFTCORR 19 .

After reference-free 2D classification, we retained 180,000 out of 474,000 particles to run 3D classification with C1 symmetry 62 . We used the initial model previously generated for MHV 18 with Optimod 63 and low-pass-filtered the data to 60 \u00c5 as a starting reference for 3D classification. 118,000 particles were selected and used to run gold-standard 3D refinement with Relion 20 , thus yielding a map at 3.95-\u00c5 resolution. After particle-motion and radiation-damage correction with Relion particle polishing 64 , another round of 3D classification with C3 symmetry was performed to select 79,667 particles. After gold-standard 3D refinement with this subset of particles, we obtained a reconstruction at 3.76-\u00c5 resolution. Per-particle defocus parameters were estimated with GCTF and used to run an identical round of 3D refinement that yielded the final 3.4-\u00c5-resolution map. Post processing was performed with Relion to apply an automatically generated B factor of \u2212129 \u00c5 2 . Reported resolutions were based on the gold-standard FSC = 0.143 criterion 20, 21 , and FSC curves were corrected for the effects of soft masking by high-resolution noise substitution 65 .

            "text": "Model building and analysis. UCSF Chimera 66 and Coot 22,67 were used to fit atomic models into the cryo-EM map. The MHV S 2 subunit was fit into the density and rebuilt manually in Coot. The crystal structure of HCoV-NL63 domain B was then fit into the density, and the rest of the S 1 subunit was built with a combination of manual building in Coot and de novo building with Rosetta 23-25 . Glycan density coming after an NXS/T motif was initially manually built into the density, and glycan geometry was then refined with Rosetta, optimizing the fit-to-density as well as the energetics of protein-glycan contacts. The glycans were not as well defined as the protein region in the reconstruction, owing to flexibility and compositional heterogeneity. The final model was refined by application of strict noncrystallographic symmetry constraints with Rosetta, with a training map corresponding to one of the two maps generated by the goldstandard refinement procedure in Relion. The second map (testing map) was used only for calculation of the FSC compared with the atomic model and preventing overfitting 68 26 was used with calibrated charge-dependent ETD parameters and a supplemental higher-energy collision dissociation energy of 0.15 for the samples with intact glycopeptides and 0.2 for the samples treated with endoglycosidases. A resolution setting of 120,000 with an AGC target of 2 \u00d7 10 5 was used for MS1, and a resolution setting of 30,000 with an AGC target of 1 \u00d7 10 5 was used for MS2. The data were searched against a custom database including recombinant coronavirus S-glycoprotein sequences, a list of common contaminant proteins including trypsin, chymotrypsin and the endoglycosidases, as well as 998 decoy reverse yeast sequences, with trypsin or chymotrypsin as the protease, allowing up to two missed cleavages. All searches included carbamidomethylation of cysteine as a fixed modification and oxidation of methionine as a variable modification. An initial comprehensive search for glycosylation revealed that (core-fucosylated) paucimannose and high-mannose structures were the only identified glycan species in the samples. On the basis of these findings, a final search was performed with COMET 75 on the same data with the following list of variable modifications of asparagine residues: +HexNAc(2)Hex(3), +HexNAc(2)Hex(3)dHex(1), +HexNAc(2)Hex(3)dHex(2), +HexNAc(2)Hex(4), +HexNAc(2)Hex(5), +HexNAc(2)Hex(6), +HexNAc(2)Hex(7), +HexNAc(2)Hex(8) and +HexNAc(2)Hex (9) . The samples treated with endoglycosidases were searched with +HexNAc, +HexNAc(1)dHex(1) and +HexNAc(1)dHex(2) as variable modifications of asparagine. We used a precursor mass tolerance of 20 p.p.m., 0.02 fragment bin size, including b/c/y/z fragments, with monoisotopic masses for both precursor and fragment ions. The search results were filtered for modification of asparagine residues and the presence of an NX(S/T) sequon at the protein level. All appropriate peptide spectrum matches (PSMs) were manually inspected, and only those with reasonable peptide sequence coverage were kept. In addition, the spectra were inspected for the presence of glycan fragment ions. All glycosylation sites identified by MS listed in Supplementary Table 1 are based on multiple PSMs, often with multiple different glycans and additional confirmation from overlap between the trypsin-and chymotrypsin-treated samples. The greatest number of glycopeptide identifications was made in the chymotrypsin-digested samples.",

Subsequent cloning was performed in the pMT-BiP-V5-His expression vector (Invitrogen) in frame with the Drosophila BiP secretion signal downstream the metallothionein promoter.Production of recombinant HCoV-NL63 S ectodomain in Drosophila S2 cells.To generate a stable Drosophila S2 cell line expressing the recombinant HCoV-NL63 S ectodomain, we used Effectene (Qiagen) and 2 \u00b5g of plasmid. Puromycin N-acetyltransferase was cotransfected and used as a dominant selectable marker. Stable HCoV-NL63 S-expressing cell lines were selected by addition of 7 \u00b5g/ml puromycin (Invivogen) to the culture medium 48 h after transfection. For largescale production, the cells were cultured in spinner flasks and induced by 5 \u00b5M of CdCl 2 at a density of approximately 10 7 cells/mL. After one week at 28 \u00b0C, clarified cell supernatants were concentrated 40-fold with Vivaflow tangential filtration cassettes (Sartorius, 10-kDa cutoff) and adjusted to pH 8.0, before affinity purification with a StrepTactin Superflow column (IBA) followed by gel-filtration chromatography with a Superose 6 10/300 GL column (GE Life Sciences) equilibrated in 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 100 mM NaCl. The purified protein was quantified according to absorption at 280 nm and concentrated to approximately 3 mg/mL. Cryo-EM specimen preparation and data collection. 2 \u00b5l of purified HCoV-NL63 spike at 1.0 mg/mL was applied to a 1.2/1.3 C-flat grid (Protochips), which had been glow-discharged for 30 s at 20 mA. Grids were then plunge-frozen in liquid ethane with an FEI Mark I Vitrobot with 7.5-s blot time and an offset of \u22123 mm at 100% humidity and 25 \u00b0C. Data were collected with Leginon automatic data-collection software 57 on an FEI Titan Krios operated at 300 kV and equipped with a Gatan Quantum GIF energy filter, operated in zero-loss mode with a slit width of 20 eV, and a Gatan K2 Summit direct electron detector camera. The dose rate was adjusted to 8 counts/pixel/s, and each movie was acquired in counting mode fractionated in 50 frames of 200 ms. 1,400 micrographs were collected in a single session with a defocus range between 2.0 and 4.0 \u00b5m.",

HCoV-NL63 S was prepared for MS analysis unaltered or subjected to Endo H (NEB), subjected to Endo F3 (Millipore) or subjected to combined Endo H and Endo F3 deglycosylation treatment. 2 \u00b5l of the relevant endoglycosidases was incubated with 20 \u00b5g of HCoV-NL63 S for 14 h overnight in 50 mM sodium acetate, pH 4.4, at 37 \u00b0C in a 20-\u00b5L reaction. 6 \u00b5g of HCoV-NL63 S was then incubated in a freshly prepared solution containing 100 mM Tris, pH 8.5, 2% sodium deoxycholate, 10 mM Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine and 40 mM iodoacetamide at 95 \u00b0C for 5 min; this was followed by an incubation at 25 \u00b0C for 30 min in the dark. 1.6 \u00b5g of denatured, reduced and alkylated HCoV-NL63 S was then diluted into freshly prepared 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate and incubated for 14 h at 37 \u00b0C with 0.032 \u00b5g of either trypsin (Sigma Aldrich) or chymotrypsin (Sigma Aldrich). Formic acid was then added to a final concentration of 2% to precipitate the sodium deoxycholate in the samples. Samples were then centrifuged at 14,000 r.p.m. for 20 min. The supernatant containing the (glyco)peptides was collected and spun again at 14,000 r.p.m. for 5 min immediately before sample analysis.

The ability of the HCoV-NL63 S 1 -mFc and S 1 -B-mFc chimeric proteins to bind the ACE2-hFc receptor was evaluated with an ELISA-based assay. 100 \u00b5l of hACE2-hFc (20 \u00b5g/ml, diluted in PBS) was coated on a 96-well MaxiSorb plate overnight at 4 \u00b0C. Nonspecific binding sites were subsequently blocked with a 3% (w/v) solution of bovine serum albumin in PBS. Plates were washed with washing buffer (PBS with 0.05% Tween 20) and subsequently incubated with serially diluted S 1 -mFc proteins (starting with equimolar concentrations) for 1 h at room temperature, after which plates were washed three times with washing buffer. mFc-tagged S 1 proteins were detected with HRP-conjugated polyclonal rabbit-anti-mouse immunoglobulins (1:2,000 dilution in PBS with 0.1% BSA; DAKO, P0260; validation on manufacturer's website), and a colorimetric reaction was produced after incubation with tetramethylbenzidine substrate (BioFX). The optical density (OD) was subsequently measured at 450 nm with an ELISA reader (EL-808, BioTEK). Background (signal from HRP-conjugated anti-mFc antibody alone) was subtracted from the OD 450nm values. The mFc-tagged SARS-CoV S 1 subunit was used as a positive control, whereas the mFc-tagged HCoV-NL63 S 1 domain 0 (HCoV-NL63 S 1 -0-mFc) and PEDV S 1 subunit (PEDV S 1 -mFc), both of which do not bind ACE2, were used as negative controls.Surface plasmon resonance (SPR).
