            "text": "CLR triggering by different pathogens can induce diverse immune responses (TABLE 1) . The underlying signalling processes are complex and depend on crosstalk with other PRRs, the ligand-or carbohydratespecific signalling pathway and the DC subset. Recent studies suggest that there are two general ways by which CLRs induce signalling pathways. CLRs, such as macrophage-inducible C-type lectin (mincle; also known as CLeC4e), dectin 2 (also known as CLeC6A), blood DC antigen 2 protein (BDCA2; also known as CLeC4C) and C-type lectin domain family 5, member A (CLeC5A), are associated with and induce signalling pathways through immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM)-containing adaptor molecules, such as Fc receptor \u03b3-chain (FcR\u03b3) or DAP12 . other CLRs, such as dectin 1, DC-specific ICAM3-grabbing non-integrin (DC-sIGN; also known as CD209), DCIR and myeloid C-type lectin-like receptor (MICL; also known as CLeC12A) induce signalling pathways through the activation of protein kinases or phosphatases that either directly or indirectly interact with their cytoplasmic domains 3, 5, 14, 15 . several CLRs, such as DC-sIGN, BDCA2, DCIR and MICL, induce signalling pathways that modulate TLR-induced gene expression at the transcriptional or post-transcriptional level. However, to date these receptors have not been shown to induce gene expression in the absence of other PRR signalling 3, 6, 11, 16 . By contrast, other CLRs, such as dectin 1, dectin 2 and mincle, induce gene expression following carbohydrate recognition independently of other PRRs 5, 10, 17, 18 . The transcription factor nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) is a key mediator of inducible gene expression in the immune system, although many other transcription factors have an equally essential role. Indeed, the activation of the transcription factors activator protein 1 and members of the IFN regulatory factor family by diverse PRRs provides flexibility and variability to the regulation of cytokine gene expression, which is needed to combat different pathogens 2, 19 . CLR-induced signal transduction seems to mainly activate or modulate NF-\u03baB functions, and the regulation of other transcription factors by CLRs has received little attention to date. In the following sections we first discuss the signalling pathways induced by CLRs that modulate TLR-induced gene expression and then describe the mechanisms used by CLRs to induce gene expression by themselves.",

            "text": "CLR and TLR signalling crosstalk DC-SIGN signalling. DC-sIGN interacts with a wide range of pathogens through mannose and fucose recognition (TABLE 1) , and recent studies have shed more light on its signalling properties (fIG. 1) . The interaction of DC-sIGN with mannose-containing pathogens, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Mycobacterium leprae, HIv-1, measles virus and Candida albicans, affects TLR4-mediated immune responses by DCs 3, 20 . The crosstalk between TLR4 and DC-sIGN depends on the prior activation of NF-\u03baB by TLR signalling and is therefore not limited to TLR4, but also includes triggering of other NF-\u03baB-inducing PRRs, such as TLR3 and TLR5 (REf. 3 ). DC-sIGN triggering activates the serine/ threonine protein kinase RAF1, which induces the phosphorylation of the NF-\u03baB subunit p65 at ser276 (REf. 3 ). The activation of RAF1 by DC-sIGN does not depend on TLR signalling 3 and involves a complex sequence of events, including its release from autoinhibition, dephosphorylation, transformational changes and finally phosphorylation to activate its kinase activity 21 . specifically, DC-sIGN triggering activates the small GTPase Ras proteins, which is the first essential step in RAF1 activation. subsequent binding of GTP-Ras to RAF1 leads to the phosphorylation of RAF1 at residues ser338, Tyr340 and Tyr341 (REf. 3 ). Phosphorylation of RAF1 at ser338 is mediated by p21-activated kinases (PAKs), which in turn are activated by members of the Rho family of small GTPases, and phosphorylation at Tyr340 and Tyr341 is mediated by src kinases 3, 21 . However, it is unknown how DC-sIGN triggering results in the activation of these downstream effector kinases. Recently, it was shown that DC-sIGN triggering by HIv-1 or the activating antibody H200 induces the activation of leukaemia-associated Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor (LARG), which is essential for the formation of the infectious synapse between DCs and T cells that facilitates HIv-1 transmission 22 . LARG is recruited to DC-sIGN after stimulation, which leads to the recruitment and activation of the small GTPase RHoA 22 ; LARG and RHoA might be involved in the activation of the upstream effectors of RAF1.",

Acetylation affects the activity of p65 by increasing its DNA binding affinity, prolonging its nuclear activity and enhancing transcriptional rate 24 . In particular, the acetylation of p65 mediated by DC-sIGN increases and prolongs transcriptional activation from the Il8 and Il10 promoter 3 . In addition to this, RAF1mediated acetylation of p65 by DC-sIGN might also increase the transcription of other cytokine genes such as Il6 and Il12b (see below), as shown for dectin 1 (REf. 4); therefore, acetylation of p65 by DC-sIGN signalling has a central role in the immune responses induced by various mannose-containing pathogens. The signalling route downstream of RAF1 leading to p65 phosphorylation remains to be fully defined. RAF1 is a well-known component of the classical RAF1-MeK-eRK (RAF1-MAPK/eRK kinase-extracellular signal-regulated kinase) signalling cascade 21 , but eRK activation is not observed after binding of mannosecontaining pathogens by DC-sIGN 3 . By contrast, the DC-sIGN specific antibody MR1 has been shown to induce eRK activation 25 , although it is not clear whether this reflects what occurs in the presence of an actual pathogen. stimulation of DCs with the DC-sIGN ligand Ara h1, which is the major peanut allergen, or Schistosoma mansoni soluble egg antigens induces eRK activation, although a role for DC-sIGN triggering was not formally established in these studies 26, 27 . similarly, binding of HIv-1 gp120 to DCs has been linked to eRK activation, but it was not specified whether DC-sIGN, the mannose receptor or chemokine receptors were involved in this activation 28 . Another ligand of DC-sIGN, the tick Ixodes scapularis saliva protein salp15, activates RAF1, but the downstream signalling pathway it triggers differs from that induced by mannose-containing pathogens as it does not involve the acetylation of p65 (REf. 29) . RAF1 activation by salp15 leads to MeK but not eRK activation, and this specific signalling pathway might reflect modulation of the RAF1-p65 acetylation pathway as a result of the involvement of signalling pathways induced through other receptors. Indeed, salp15 is known to interact with receptors such as CD4 (REf. 30) , and this could result in the activation of kinases that are different to those induced by other DC-sIGN ligands. The salp15induced RAF1-MeK-dependent signalling pathway decreases Borrelia burgdorferi-induced TLR-dependent inflammatory cytokine production by enhancing Il6 and ",

The pioneering study targeting DEC205 (also known as LY75) showed that DEC205-specific antibodies that were linked to an antigen of interest resulted in enhanced antigen uptake and presentation by dendritic cells (DCs) to both CD4 + and CD8 + T cells compared with antigen alone 83 . Since those early studies, it has become clear that targeting of CLRs is a powerful method to enhance antigen presentation and, depending on the CLR that is targeted, can determine whether the antigen is presented in the context of MHC class I or MHC class II molecules or both 1 . MHC class I presentation is crucial for inducing strong CD8 + T cell responses, which are necessary for immunity to HIV-1 and cancer.",

Active calcineurin presumably interacts in an inhibitory manner with the TLR-adaptor protein myeloid differentiation primary response protein 88 (MyD88), thus preventing TLR signalling 34 . This suggests that BDCA2 activation of PLC\u03b32 and subsequent calcium mobilization might prevent MyD88 recruitment and thereby reduce the production of TLR-induced cytokines. Tonic calcium signalling is induced by low-avidity ligands of TReM2 (triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2), which, similarly to BDCA2, pairs with an ITAM-bearing signalling adaptor protein (DAP12) and negatively regulates TLR responses in macrophages 35, 36 . By contrast, highavidity ligation of ITAM-associated receptors induces transient calcium signalling and strongly activates NF-\u03baB and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways, Nature Reviews | Immunology which synergize with TLR signalling and hence drive pro-inflammatory cytokine production 37 .

The upstream effectors that activate PAKs and Src kinases are unknown but might involve leukaemia-associated Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor (LARG) and Ras homologue A (RHoA), as these proteins are activated by HIV-1 binding to DC-SIGN. RAF1 activation leads to modulation of Toll-like receptor (TLR)-induced nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) activation. TLR3 and TLR4 activation by double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS), respectively, leads to the recruitment of the ubiquitin ligase TNF receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) by myeloid differentiation primary response protein 88 (MYD88), TIR-domain-containing adaptor protein inducing IFN\u03b2 (TRIF) and other factors (not depicted). Self-induced polyubiquitylation (Ub) of TRAF6 mediates the recruitment of TGF\u03b2-activating kinase 1 (TAK1), which activates the I\u03baB kinase (IKK) complex. IKK\u03b2 phosphorylates inhibitor of NF-\u03baB\u03b1 (I\u03baB\u03b1), thereby targeting it for proteasomal degradation and releasing NF-\u03baB from inhibition, which then translocates into the nucleus, where it binds to NF-\u03baB sites in the enhancer and promoter regions of target genes. RAF1 induces the phosphorylation of p65 at Ser276 through an unknown pathway. Phosphorylated Ser276 serves as a binding site for the histone acetyltransferases CREB-binding protein (CBP) and p300 (not depicted) to acetylate (Ac) p65 at different lysines. Acetylated p65 exhibits enhanced transcriptional activity as well as prolonged nuclear presence owing to impaired binding by I\u03baB, which increases the rate of Il10 (interleukin-10) transcription and prolongs the binding of NF-\u03baB to the Il10 promoter, thereby increasing the production of IL-10. b | Binding of the salivary protein Salp15 from the tick Ixodes scapularis to DC-SIGN activates RAF1, but co-ligation with another receptor, presumably CD4, changes downstream effectors of RAF1, leading to MEK (MAPK/ERK kinase) but not ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase) activation. The spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi exploits the effects of Salp15 to infect humans. Salp15-induced MEK-dependent signalling decreases B. burgdorferi-induced TLR1-TLR2-dependent pro-inflammatory cytokine production by enhancing the decay of Il6 and Tnf (tumour necrosis factor) mRNA while impairing nucleosome remodelling at the Il12a promoter, which is required for transcriptional initiation.

Although sHP1 and sHP2 have been shown to activate eRK 39 , it remains to be determined whether this is the pathway downstream of MICL. so, the ITIM-bearing CLRs seem to suppress cytokine responses induced by other PRRs through the recruitment of sHPs. Both sHP1 and sHP2 have previously been reported to be negative regulators of TLR signalling 40, 41 . Notably, although activation of sHP1 decreases the production of TLR-induced pro-inflammatory cytokines, it has also been shown to increase the production of type I IFNs induced by TLRs and the helicase RIG-I 40 . Activation of sHPs might allow for plasticity in the immune responses induced by DCIR and MICL, which not only depends on the DC subset but also on the PRRs involved.

A role for syK in the dectin 1-induced activation of NF-\u03baB was established a few years ago, but the signalling pathway that links syK with NF-\u03baB has been revealed only recently 17 . Recruitment of syK to the phosphorylated yxxL (in which x denotes any amino acid) motif in the cytoplasmic tails of two dectin 1 molecules 5,44 is required for the assembly of a scaffold complex that consists of CARD9, BCL-10 and MALT1 (REf. 17) . Dectin 1-induced NF-\u03baB activation and cytokine production by DCs from mice deficient in CARD9, BCL-10 or MALT1 is severely defective, and the survival of CARD9-deficient mice following infection with C. albicans is greatly impaired 17 . It remains to be established how the CARD9-BCL-10-MALT1 complex relays the activation signals for NF-\u03baB, but it seems possible that this involves the recruitment and activation of the TNF receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2)-TRAF6 complex in an analogous manner to how lymphocyte antigen receptors use the CARMA1-BCL-10-MALT1 complex to activate NF-\u03baB 45 . Dectin 1 triggering of the syK-CARD9 pathway results in the activation of the NF-\u03baB subunits p65 and ReL, which are part of the the canonical Nf-\u03baB pathway 4,17 .

Dectin 1 is the only CLR known to induce the non-canonical NF-\u03baB pathway and it is therefore probably an important control point for the induction of specific T cell responses: IL-12p40 (encoded by Il12b) is an essential subunit for bioactive IL-12 and IL-23, which are important for the development of T H 1 and T H 17 cell responses, respectively, whereas IL-1\u03b2 is involved in T H 17 cell differentiation [54] [55] [56] [57] . Thus, the activation of two signalling pathways by dectin 1 allows more specific regulation of the cytokine gene transcription profile.",

Ligand binding to This results in the release of nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB; consisting of either p65-p50 or REL-p50 dimers), which then translocates into the nucleus. SYK activation also leads to the activation of the non-canonical NF-\u03baB pathway that is mediated by NF-\u03baB inducing kinase (NIK) and IKK\u03b1, which target p100 for proteolytic processing to p52; this subsequently leads to nuclear translocation of RELB-p52 dimers. In a SYK-independent manner, dectin 1 activation leads to the phosphorylation and activation of the serine/threonine protein kinase RAF1 by Ras proteins, which leads to the phosphorylation of p65 at Ser276. Phosphorylated Ser276 serves as a binding site for the histone acetyltransferases CREB-binding protein (CBP) or p300 (not depicted) to acetylate (Ac) p65 at different lysine residues. Ser276-phosphorylated p65 also dimerizes with RELB to form inactive dimers that cannot bind DNA, and hence attenuates the transcriptional activity of RELB. b | Binding of acetylated p65 to the Il10 (interleukin-10) enhancer and Il6 promoter increases the transcription of both genes. The RAF1-mediated formation of inactive p65-RELB dimers results in the binding of acetylated p65 to the Il12b promoter and REL-p50 to the Il1b promoter, which leads to increased IL-12p40 and IL-1\u03b2 expression, respectively. The higher DNA binding affinity of acetylated p65 displaces REL-p50 dimers from the Il12a and Il23p19 promoters, which leads to increased expression of IL-12p35. However, the expression of IL-23p19 is decreased, as REL-p50 dimers are stronger transactivators of Il23p19 than p65-p50 dimers. The formation of inactive p65-RELB dimers blocks binding of RELB-p52 to the promoters of the chemokine genes Ccl17 (CC-chemokine ligand 17) and Ccl22, thereby blocking chemokine expression. these CLRs leads to phosphorylation of the ITAM of the paired adaptor protein and the subsequent recruitment of syK 12, 58 . The signalling pathways downstream of syK for dectin 2 and mincle remain largely unknown but might be similar to those downstream of other receptors that use FcR\u03b3. FcR\u03b3 couples several receptors to NF-\u03baB activation through a syK-CARD-BCL-10-MALT1 complex 32 . Indeed, pairing of dectin 2 with FcR\u03b3 results in NF-\u03baB activation 10, 58 , although a role for the syK-CARD9-BCL-10-MALT1 complex has not yet been confirmed. Thus, dectin 2 triggering alone might induce an adaptive immune response, which is supported by data showing that dectin 2 recognition of fungal hyphae from C. albicans, Trichophyton rubrum and Microsporum audouinii leads to TLR-independent production of the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF and IL-6 (REf. 10). Furthermore, dectin 2 recognition of house dust mite allergens activates syK through FcR\u03b3 to generate cysteinyl leukotrienes, an important mediator of allergic inflammation in the lungs 58 . Notably, recognition of Histoplasma capsulatum \u03b2-glucans by dectin 1 also leads to the production of leukotrienes 59 , suggesting that a common syK-dependent pathway is involved in leukotriene synthesis after CLR triggering. The related CLR mincle also pairs with FcR\u03b3 and induces gene transcription through the syK-CARD9-BCL-10-MALT1 complex 12 . In macrophages, recognition of dead cells by mincle through the endogenous ligand sAP130 (sIN3A-associated protein, 130 kDa) mediates CXC-chemokine ligand 2 (CXCL2) and TNF production in a syK-and CARD9-dependent manner, which induces neutrophils to migrate into damaged tissues 12 . Mincle also interacts with \u03b1-mannosyl PAMPs expressed by the pathogenic fungus Malassezia spp. and induces gene transcription and TNF production without the involvement of TLRs, further suggesting that mincle, similarly to dectin 2, couples FcR\u03b3-signalling to NF-\u03baB activation 18 . The similarities of mincle downstream signalling with the dectin 1 pathway suggest that both CLRs couple syK activation to NF-\u03baB activation through the CARD9-BCL-10-MALT1 complex.",

M. tuberculosis and M. leprae induce the production of IL-10 because they trigger TLRs and DC-sIGN, which enhances TLR-induced NF-\u03baB activity through the RAF1 signalling pathway as described above 3 . The effect of DC-sIGN signalling on the expression of other cytokines that are crucial for T H cell differentiation has not yet been described but needs to be resolved to understand its effect on adaptive immune responses. Recent studies suggest that DC-sIGN triggering by M. tuberculosis induces T H 1 cell differentiation 60 , whereas Mycobacterium bovis Both DC-associated C-type lectin 2 (dectin 2) and macrophage-inducible C-type lectin (mincle) pair with the signalling adaptor molecule Fc receptor \u03b3-chain (FcR\u03b3) through the presence of a positively charged amino acid residue in their transmembrane regions. The phosphorylation of the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs) of FcR\u03b3 following C-type lectin receptor (CLR) activation serves to recruit spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) and induces signalling pathways that modulate cytokine expression. Dectin 2 binds to pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) expressed by fungal hyphae, and mincle binds to \u03b1-mannosyl PAMPs on Malassezia spp. fungi.

It is divided into two main phases: initiation and establishment of autoimmunity to collagen-rich joint components, and later events associated with the evolving destructive inflammatory processes. humans 4, 65 (fIG. 5a) . Activation of dectin 1 by \u03b2-glucans on mouse DCs results in syK-CARD9-dependent secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-6, TNF and IL-23, but little IL-12, and induces T H 17 cell responses in vitro 65 . In vivo immunization using a dectin 1 agonist or C. albicans infection promotes the differentiation of T H 1 and T H 17 cells. Furthermore, mice deficient in components of the dectin 1 signalling pathway, such as CARD9, do not induce T H 17 cell responses and are more susceptible to infections with C. albicans 17, 65 . Notably, dectin 1 is redundant in the T H 17 cell response 65 , suggesting that in the absence of dectin 1 other CLRs, such as dectin 2, might use the syK-CARD9 complex to induce protective immunity against fungi. It has been shown that the fungal cell wall component zymosan, a stimulus for TLR2 and dectin 1, regulates IL-10 secretion by DCs and transforming growth factor-\u03b2 production by macrophages to induce immunological tolerance in vivo 67 . IL-10 secretion by DCs depends on the activation of the eRK signalling pathway, but the direct involvement of dectin 1 was not examined in this study 67 . Nevertheless, these data suggest that collaboration between dectin 1 and different PRRs results in distinct immune responses, including T H 17 cell responses and tolerance, which might depend on the crosstalk between signalling pathways. Manipulation of this signalling crosstalk will allow control of T H cell differentiation. For example, the RAF1 signalling pathway induced by DC-sIGN and dectin 1 seems to control the differentiation of naive T cells to both the T H 1 and T H 17 cell lineages in response to C. albicans infection. Inhibition of RAF1 abrogates IL-12 expression and skews T H cell differentiation towards a T H 2 cell response 4 . Moreover, T H 17 cell differentiation seems equally dependent on the activation of RAF1 in response to dectin 1 triggering, which induces the expression of IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and IL-23, crucial cytokines in promoting the proliferation of T H 17 cells in humans 4 . RAF1 inhibition abrogates T H 17 cell differentiation in response to dectin 1 triggering by the \u03b2-glucan curdlan (j. den Dunnen, s.I.G., e.C. de jong and T.B.H.G., unpublished observations). Future studies will show whether some pathogens might manipulate these pathways to skew immune responses in favour of survival. The signalling pathways might also be exploited in vaccine development to fight infections and inflammatory diseases.",

Therefore, targeting these CLRs might prevent pathogenesis; indeed, CLeC5A inhibition during dengue virus infection was shown to prevent virus-induced plasma leakage and vital organ haemorrhaging and to reduce mortality in a mouse infection model 69 . CLRs are also involved in regulating immune homeostasis, and aberrant CLR expression and/or signalling might drive autoimmune diseases. For example, patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (sLe) have significantly reduced numbers of BDCA2-expessing pDCs, and this might account for the excessive production of type I IFNs by pDCs, which is a major pathophysiological factor in sLe, as BDCA2 signalling inhibits TLR-induced type I IFN production by pDCs 11, 33, 70 . Furthermore, polymorphisms in the human gene encoding DCIR are associated with rheumatoid arthritis, and DCIR deficiency in mice leads to the development of autoimmune disorders owing to unrestrained growth of DCs, which is consistent with a role for DCIR in the negative regulation of DC expansion 71, 72 . CLRs also seem to be involved in allergic disorders. Dectin 2 triggering by house dust mite allergens leads to cysteinyl leukotriene production, which mobilizes innate immune cells and subsequently aggravates allergic inflammation 58 . Furthermore, the major peanut allergen Ara h1 interacts with DC-sIGN and induces T H 2 cell responses, although a direct involvement of DC-sIGN in this process has not been shown 26 . These studies suggest that CLR signalling is essential to control immune homeostasis; developing CLR agonists might activate the appropriate signalling pathway to prevent autoimmune disorders, and CLR antagonists could attenuate infections or allergic inflammation.",

Because of their restrictive expression by DC subsets and their function as uptake receptors (BOX 1), CLRs have been prime candidates for this in vivo targeting vaccination strategy. Targeting of CLRs such as DeC205, DC-sIGN or mannose receptor by antibodies efficiently induces antigen-specific CD4 + and CD8 + T cell responses [73] [74] [75] . In these studies, targeting of DeC205 by antibodies did not result in DC maturation and therefore induced tolerance in the absence of an adjuvant such as CD40 or TLR ligands (for example CpG-containing DNA or polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid) 76 . This ability can be exploited in vivo to induce disease-specific tolerance to pancreatic islet \u03b2-cells 77 , thereby preventing the development of type 1 diabetes, an autoimmune disease resulting from defects in central and peripheral tolerance and characterized by T cell-mediated destruction of \u03b2-cells. Targeting of \u03b2-cell antigens to DeC205 expressed by DCs resulted in deletion of \u03b2-cell antigen-specific autoreactive CD8 + T cells in a mouse model of type 1 diabetes. Notably, tolerance was induced even in the context of ongoing autoimmunity in a mouse model with known tolerance defects 77 .",

Carbohydrate-expressing ligands can trigger specific signalling properties that might facilitate immune activation 1,74 , although tumour antigens use the interaction with CLRs to induce immune suppression. Thus, it is essential to investigate in detail the immune response induced by the different targeting strategies. By contrast, antibodies allow specific targeting of the CLRs, but most antibodies do not induce signalling pathways or might induce aberrant signalling. However, antibodies with different signalling properties can be generated to allow antigen delivery in combination with the induction of a specific T cell response. Alternatively, a more complex delivery system, such as liposomes or microparticles, can be used to deliver multiple antigens and a tailored PAMP fingerprint to DCs; this would trigger specific signalling pathways to induce a tailored immune response. Thus, CLRs are attractive targets in DC vaccinations, not only for antigen delivery but also as inducers of adaptive immune responses.",

            "text": "The recent advances in our understanding of antigen routing by CLRs and the antigen presenting capacity of specific DC subsets have greatly contributed to the design of vaccines that deliver the antigen to the desired intracellular compartment for MHC class I or II presentation 1, 73, 74 . This is crucial for the development of an effective DC vaccine that elicits high-avidity antigenspecific CD4 + T cells and effective CD8 + T cells in vivo to fight cancer or infectious diseases. As CLRs are not just antigen uptake receptors but also modulators or even initiators of adaptive immune responses, targeting CLRs with antibodies or ligands without knowing or understanding the signalling events they induce might have detrimental consequences. New vaccines that harness these powerful signalling properties of CLRs will allow us to tailor immune responses against a specific pathogen or disease. The recent advances in the elucidation of the syK-CARD9 signalling pathway by dectin 1, the identification of the RAF1 signalling pathway induced by both DC-sIGN and dectin 1, and the importance of NF-\u03baB modulation in fine-tuning cytokine expression have contributed to our understanding of signalling in the induction of adaptive immune responses. However, these studies also suggest that we have only just started to uncover the tip of the signalling iceberg; CLR signalling seems to be carbohydrate specific, and some CLRs such as dectin 1 can induce different signalling pathways by themselves that are integrated in the final immune response. The DC subset that expresses the CLR might also be important 32, 81, 82 . Although some CLRs might share signalling pathways, it is to be expected that the diversity in CLR signalling will be great, which is required to combat the diversity of pathogens. However, this diversity will provide some major challenges in elucidating and manipulating the signalling properties of this exciting family of receptors. Nevertheless, although we are just starting to unravel the signalling potential of CLRs, recent advances strongly support the use of CLR targeting in DC vaccinations to induce or redirect adaptive immune responses and improve antigen delivery.",

These data suggest that differences between the observed T H cell differentiation and DC-sIGN-induced IL-10 expression might depend on other PRRs that are also triggered by the pathogens. As well as inducing T H 1 cell differentiation, M. tuberculosis has been reported to induce T H 17 cell differentiation60 . The expression of IL-23 is crucial for the maintenance of T H 17 cells and is expressed in response to M. tuberculosis challenge 60,62 .The DC-sIGN signalling pathway through RAF1 probably has a role in the T H 17 cell differentiation, as IL-23 expression by ManLAM-treated DCs is greatly diminished when RAF1 activation is blocked (s.I.G., j. den Dunnen and T.B.H.G., unpublished observations). In addition to TLRs and DC-sIGN, other PRRs such as dectin 1 and an unknown FcR\u03b3-paired receptor8,63,64 recognize mycobacterial PAMPs and contribute to the differentiation of distinct T H cell subsets.Fungal pathogens such as C. albicans are recognized by dectin 1 through \u03b2-glucan structures65 and by DC-sIGN through mannose structures66 .

Binding of fungi to dectin 1 triggers the spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK)-dependent activation of nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) dimers p65-p50, REL-p50 and RELB-p52 (seefIG. 2). Both DC-SIGN and dectin 1 induce the RAF1 pathway, which controls NF-\u03baB activation by inducing p65 acetylation and attenuating the activity of the RELB-p52 dimer. The sequestration of RELB into an inactive RELB-p65 dimer allows the induction of interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), IL-12p70 and IL-23 production and therefore the induction of T H 1 and T H 17 cells. Inhibition of RAF1 abrogates the expression of cytokines that promote T H 1 and T H 17 cell development and induces T H 2 cell responses. b | Mycobacterium tuberculosis interacts with TLRs, DC-SIGN, mannose receptor and dectin 1 and induces a T H 1 and T H 17 cell response. Although the signalling pathways that are activated by M. tuberculosis have not been elucidated completely, M. tuberculosis has been shown to trigger DC-SIGN to induce the RAF1 pathway and dectin 1 to induce SYK-dependent NF-\u03baB activation. Integration of these pathways results in a T H 1 and T H 17 cell response. Inhibition of RAF1 might induce a T H 2 cell response given that dectin 1-induced SYK signalling in the absence of RAF1 activation inhibits the production of cytokines that promote T H 1 and T H 17 cell development. c | Vaccination strategies that specifically target DCs can harness the antigen presentation as well as the signalling ability of CLRs to induce strong tailored immune responses to specific antigens. A carbohydrate-coated microparticle containing antigens can specifically target dectin 1 and DC-SIGN, leading to efficient uptake and presentation of the antigen. Triggering of both dectin 1 and DC-SIGN by the carbohydrate ligands on the microparticle could induce specific T H 1 and T H 17 cell responses.
