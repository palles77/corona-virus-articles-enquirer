There are currently no antiviral drugs with proven efficacy nor are there vaccines for its prevention. Unfortunately, the scientific community has little knowledge of the molecular details of SARS-CoV-2 infection. To illuminate this, we cloned, tagged and expressed 26 of the 29 viral proteins in human cells and identified the human proteins physically associated with each using affinitypurification mass spectrometry (AP-MS), which identified 332 high confidence SARS-CoV-2-human protein-protein interactions (PPIs). Among these, we identify 67 druggable human proteins or host factors targeted by 69 existing FDA-approved drugs, drugs in clinical trials and/or preclinical compounds, that we are currently evaluating for efficacy in live SARS-CoV-2 infection assays. The identification of host dependency factors mediating virus infection may provide key insights into effective molecular targets for developing broadly acting antiviral therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2 and other deadly coronavirus strains.",

Clinical trials on several vaccine candidates are also underway 13 , as well as trials of repurposed host-directed compounds inhibiting the human protease TMPRSS2 14 . We believe there is great potential in systematically exploring the host dependencies of the SARS-CoV-2 virus to identify other host proteins already targeted with existing drugs. Therapies targeting the host-virus interface, where mutational resistance is arguably less likely, could potentially present durable, broad-spectrum treatment modalities 15 . Unfortunately, our minimal knowledge of the molecular details of SARS-CoV-2 infection precludes a comprehensive evaluation of small molecule candidates for host-directed therapies. We sought to address this knowledge gap by systematically mapping the interaction landscape between SARS-CoV-2 proteins and human proteins.",

The 5' Orf1a / Orf1ab encodes polyproteins, which are auto-proteolytically processed into 16 non-structural proteins (Nsp1-16) which form the replicase / transcriptase complex (RTC). The RTC consists of multiple enzymes, including the papain-like protease (Nsp3), the main protease (Nsp5), the Nsp7-Nsp8 primase complex, the primary RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (Nsp12), a helicase/triphosphatase (Nsp13), an exoribonuclease (Nsp14), an endonuclease (Nsp15), and N7-and 2'O-methyltransferases (Nsp10/Nsp16) 1, 16, 17 . At the 3' end of the viral genome, as many as 13 Orfs are expressed from nine predicted sub-genomic RNAs. These include four structural proteins: Spike (S), Envelope (E), Membrane (M) and Nucleocapsid (N) 17 , and nine putative accessory factors (Fig. 1a) 1, 16 . In genetic composition, the SARS-CoV-2 genome is very similar to SARS-CoV: each has an Orf1ab encoding 16 predicted Nsps and each has the four typical coronavirus structural proteins. However, they differ in their complement of 3' open reading frames: SARS-CoV-2 possesses an Orf3b and Orf10 with limited detectable protein homology to SARS-CoV 16 , and its Orf8 is intact while SARS-CoV encodes Orf8a and Orf8b (Fig. 1b) 1, 16, 18 .",

Despite the lack of detection via western blot we were able to detect expression of viral peptides Nsp4, Nsp6, and Orf3b in the proteomic analysis. The fourth construct not confirmed by western blot, the small peptide Nsp11, had a predicted molecular mass of 4.8 kDa (including tag) but an apparent mass of approximately 30 kDa (Fig. 1c) . SARS-CoV-2 Orf3b has limited homology to SARS-CoV Orf3b 16 , and its restricted expression as measured by both western blot and AP-MS may indicate that it is either not a bonafide protein coding gene or that it requires co-expression of other SARS-CoV-2 proteins for robust expression. Ultimately we proceeded with analysis of protein interaction data from 27 baits, and excluded Orf7b, which had high prey detection background (Fig. 1d) .",

Therefore, we asked whether the host proteins bound by SARS-CoV-2 might be specifically relevant to the virus's typical environment, lung tissue. We tested if the interacting human proteins were preferentially highly expressed, at the protein level, in any of 29 human tissues 32 , which identified the lung as the tissue with the highest expression of the prey proteins relative to the average proteome (Fig. 2c) . In accordance to this, when compared to overall RefSeq gene expression in the lung (median=3.198 TPM), the interacting proteins were more highly expressed (median=25.52 TPM, p=0.0007; t-test, Extended Data Fig. 4 ) and were also specifically enriched in lung expression relative to other tissues (Extended Data Fig. 5 ). These data support the hypothesis that SARS-CoV-2 preferentially hijacks proteins available in lung tissue and the degree of tissue specific expression may facilitate the drug targeting of host factors with fewer systemic side-effects; this observation is particularly compelling given its derivation from HEK293 cells, which are themselves not lung derived. To further study the relevance of our map, we analyzed the recently reported protein abundance changes during SARS-CoV-2 infection 33 . We calculated, when possible, the correlation between changes in abundance of viral proteins and their human interaction partners across the 4 timepoints reported. Interacting pairs tended to have stronger correlated changes than other pairs of viralhuman proteins (Fig. 2d , KS test p-value=4.8e\u221205), arguing that the AP-MS derived interactions are of high relevance for the target tissue and the infection context. We compared our SARS-CoV-2 interaction map with those derived for 10 other pathogens (Fig. 2e) , identifying West Nile Virus (WNV) 23 and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) 27 as having the most similar host protein interaction partners. The association with Mtb is particularly interesting considering it also infects lung tissue.",

            "text": "There are several mechanistically interesting, and potentially disease-relevant drug-target interactions revealed in the chemoinformatic network (Fig. 5a) . Among them, the well-known chemical probe, Bafilomycin A1, is a potent inhibitor of the V1-ATPase, subunits of which interact with Nsp6 and M. Bafilomycin's inhibition of this cotransporter acts to prevent the acidification of the lysosome, inhibiting autophagy and endosome trafficking pathways, which may impact the viral life-cycle. Similarly, drugs exist to target several well-known epigenetic regulators prominent among the human interactors, including HDAC2, BRD2 and BRD4, which interact with viral proteins nsp5 and E, respectively (Figs. 3 and 5a). The approved drug Valproic acid (an anticonvulsant) and the pre-clinical candidate Apicidin inhibit HDAC2 with affinities of 62 \u03bcM and 120 nM, respectively. Clinical compounds ABBV-744 and CPI-0610 act on BRD2/4, with an affinity of 2 nM or 39 nM, respectively --several preclinical compounds also target bromodomain-containing proteins (Table 1a,b). As a final example, we were intrigued to observe that the SARS-CoV-2 Nsp6 protein interacts with the Sigma receptor, which is thought to regulate ER stress response 71 . Similarly, the Sigma2 receptor interacted with the vial protein orf9. Both Sigma1 and Sigma2 are promiscuous receptors that interact with many non-polar, cationic drugs. We prioritized several of these drugs based on potency or potential disease relevance, including the antipsychotic Haloperidol, which binds in the low nM range to both receptors 72 , and Chloroquine, which is currently in clinical trials for COVID-19 and has mid-nM activity vs the Sigma1 receptor, and low \u03bcM activity against the Sigma2 receptor. Because many patients are already treated with drugs that have off-target impact on Sigma receptors, associating clinical outcomes accompanying treatment with these drugs may merit investigation, a point to which we return. Finally, in addition to the druggable host factors, a few of which we have highlighted here, the SARS-CoV-2-human interactome reveals many traditionally \"undruggable\" targets. Among these, for instance, are components of the centriole such as CEP250, which interacts with the viral Nsp13. Intriguingly, a very recent patent disclosure revealed a natural product, WDB002, that directly and specifically targets CEP250. As a natural product, WDB002 would likely be harder to source than the molecules on which we have focused on here, but may well merit investigation. Similarly, other \"undruggable\" targets may be revealed to have compounds that could usefully perturb the viral-human interaction network, and act as leads to therapeutics.",

The human purine biosynthesis enzyme Inosine-5\u2032-monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH2) interacts with the viral protein nsp14. Several chemically diverse compounds inhibit IMPDH2, including the clinically approved mycophenolic acid (20 nM), the approved antiviral drug ribavirin (200 nM), and the investigational new drug Merimepodib (10 nM) (Table  1a) . Intriguingly, the preclinical molecule Sanglifehrin A (Table 1b) is known to act as a molecular glue linking IMPDH with cyclophilin A (Fig. 5b) 73 , which itself is implicated in viral capsid packaging, even though it itself is not a human \"prey\" in the viral-human protein interactome. Similarly, direct viral-human interactions with proteins regulated by the mTORC1 pathway, such as LARP1, and FKBP7, which interact with the viral N and Orf8 proteins, led us to inhibitors of mTORC1, even though that kinase itself is not found to directly interact with a viral protein (Fig. 5c ). Sapanisertib and rapamycin are low nM inhibitors of mTORC1, while metformin is an indirect modulator of this protein complex.",

Among those that may be infection relevant are the inhibition of lysosomal acidification and trafficking with Bafilomycin A1, via inhibition of V-ATPase 74 , and modulation of the ER stress and the protein unfolding response pathway by targeting the Sigma1 and Sigma2 receptor by drugs like haloperidol (Fig. 5a , Tables 1a,b). Indeed, several of the human proteins in the interactome are targeted by drugs that have emerged phenotypically as candidate therapeutics for treating COVID-19, such as chloroquine 75, 76 . While we do not pretend to have identified the molecular basis of chloroquine's putative activity, we do note that this drug targets the Sigma1 and Sigma2 receptors at mid-nM and low \u03bcM concentrations, respectively. Similarly, antibiotics like azithromycin have also been mooted as treatments for COVID-19. While this too remains to be demonstrated, we note that Azithromycin has off-target activity against human mitochondrial ribosomes, components of which interact with the SARS-CoV-2 Nsp8 protein (MRPS5, MRPS27, MRPS2, and MRPS25). Other antibiotics that also have an off-target effect on mitochondrial ribosomes, such as chloramphenicol, tigecycline, and Linezolid 77,78 may also merit study for efficacy. Indeed, this logic may be extended. Many COVID-19 patients will be on the drugs identified here, treating pre-existing conditions. It may be useful to correlate clinical outcomes with the taking of these drugs, cross-referencing with the networks described here. In some senses, this is already occurring phenomenologically, leading to concerns about ACE inhibitors such as captopril and enalapril, and for NSAIDs. What this study provides is a systematic schema for clinical/drug associations going forward, giving them a mechanistic context that allows investigators to seek them directly.",

The over-representation analysis (ORA) was performed using the enricher function of clusterProfiler package in R with default parameters. The gene ontology terms were obtained from the c5 category of Molecular Signature Database (MSigDBv6.1). Significant GO terms (1% FDR) were identified and further refined to select non-redundant terms. In order to select non-redundant gene sets, we first constructed a GO term tree based on distances (1-Jaccard Similarity Coefficients of shared genes) between the significant terms. The GO term tree was cut at a specific level (h=0.99) to identify clusters of non-redundant gene sets. For a bait with multiple significant terms belonging to the same cluster, we selected the broadest term i.e. largest gene set size.",

The proposed interaction between Orf6 and the NUP98-RAE1 complex was modeled in PyRosetta 4 103 (release v2020.02-dev61090) using the crystal structure of Vesicular stomatitis virus matrix (M) protein bound to NUP98-RAE1 as a template 66 (PDB 4OWR downloaded from the PDB-REDO server 104 ). The M protein chain (C) was truncated after residue 54 to restrict the model to the putative interaction motif in Orf6 (M protein residues 49-54, sequence DEMDTH). These residues were mutated to the Orf6 sequence, QPMEID, using the mutate_residue function in the module pyrosetta.toolbox, without repacking at this initial step. After all six residues were mutated, the full model was relaxed to a low energy conformation using the FastRelax protocol in the module pyrosetta.rosetta.protocols.relax. FastRelax was run with constraints to starting coordinates and scored with the ref2015 score function. The resulting model was inspected for any large . CC-BY 4.0 International license author/funder.

The CRL2 ZYG11B homology model was built with Swissmodel 105 and Modeller 106 by using the homology template of each domain from PDB database (PDB codes: 4b8o, 5jh5,1g03, and 6r7n). The ZYG11B model has two structured domains: a leucine rich repeat (LRR) and Armadillo Repeat (ARM) at the N and C-terminus respectively. The linker between each domain was not modelled due to high flexibility between residues 32 to 49 and residues 304 to 322. Putative protein interaction surfaces on ZYG11B were modelled based on contiguous surface exposed residues that are conserved in ZYG11B orthologues from C. elegans to H. sapiens (ZY11B_HUMAN; ZY11B_MOUSE; F1M8P2_RAT; ZYG11_XENLA; ZYG11_DANRE; ZYG11_CAEEL) and located at typical substrate binding sites in the homologous structures of LRR and ARM domain co-complexes.",

Chemoinformatically, we retrieved 2,472 molecules from the IUPHAR/BPS Guide to Pharmacology (2020-3-12) that interacted with 30 human \"prey\" proteins (38 approved, 71 in clinical trials), and found 10,883 molecules (95 approved, 369 in clinical trials) from the ChEMBL25 database 107 (Supplementary Tables 5, 6 ). For both approaches, molecules were prioritized on their FDA approval status, activity at the target of interest better than 1 \u03bcM, and commercial availability, drawing on the ZINC database 108 . FDA approved molecules were prioritized except when clinical candidates or preclinical research molecules had substantially better selectivity or potency on-target. In some cases, we considered molecules with indirect mechanisms of action on the general pathway of interest based solely on literature evidence (e.g., captopril modulates ACE2 indirectly via its direct interaction with Angiotensin Converting Enzyme, ACE). Finally, we predicted 6 additional molecules (2 approved, 1 in clinical trials) for proteins with MIST scores between 0.7-0.6 to viral baits (Supplemental Tables 3 and 4 ). Complete methods can be found here (www.github.com/momeara/BioChemPantry/vignette/COVID19). a.
