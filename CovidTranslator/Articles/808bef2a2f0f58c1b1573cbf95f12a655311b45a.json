In the current study, two positive monoclonal cell lines (5D7 and 3H4) specific for PEDV were established, and the immunoreactivity of the monoclonal antibodies was confirmed by immunofluorescence and dot-immunobinding assays. A method, termed antigen capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (AC-ELISA), which used the monoclonal antibody 5D7 as the detecting antibody and rabbit antiserum of PEDV protein S as the capture antibody, was developed. Compared with the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction method of detecting PEDV in fecal samples, AC-ELISA showed similar sensitivity and specificity. These results suggested that AC-ELISA would be useful for the diagnosis and epidemiological studies of PEDV.",

It causes enteritis, with clinical signs similar to those caused by other viruses, leading to serious and continuous losses to the swine industry (14, 19) . Thus, more effective, sensitive, and quick diagnostic methods are required for the surveillance of PED. Considering its characteristics of mucosal infection and shedding, and the feasibility of clinical samples collection, the AC-ELISA method for virion detection in feces was chosen. In a previous study of ELISA for PEDV, comparing the effect of polyclonals and monoclonals as binding antibodies, the authors found lower sensitivity of ELISA with conjugated MAbs, despite their high specificity (15) . In this study, to improve the sensitivity and specificity, high titer, purified polyclonal serum was used as capture antibodies, and the MAb of PEDV was used as the detecting antibody. There was no cross-reactivity in AC-ELISA when detecting TGEV, PRV, PPV, and CSFV. The sensitivity of AC-ELISA was 15.6 TCID 50 (TCID 50 = 10 3.3 /mL), which was same as that of RT-PCR.",
