The Seeplex Respiratory Virus Detection Kit is the first multiplex PCR assay based on the DPO system. This respiratory virus detection kit has been evaluated previously in two studies to assess the diagnostic effectiveness of the kit by comparison with the conventional methods.

Bacterial and fungal cultures were all negative in these patients. RSV was the most common pathogen (12/15, 80%). RSV in 3 of these 12 patients was also identified by the direct RSV antigen assay. These respiratory specimens which were multiplex PCR-positive only, contained probably very low virus quantities and/or viruses with decreased viability. Multiplex PCR is reported to be better for the detection of viruses from clinical specimens because it can detect viral genomes at a lower titer as well as viruses that are not replication competent (Liolios et al., 2001) . Several cases of co-infection were detected using the multiplex PCR. Interestingly, most co-infections were due to RSV, which is the most common cause of respiratory tract infections in young children (Hall, 2001) . RSV involvement in dual infections has been reported to be associated with an increased severity of illness (Aberle et al., 2005) . Although this virus can be detected theoretically by viral culture, multiple infections including those by RSV were detected only by using the multiplex PCR.",
