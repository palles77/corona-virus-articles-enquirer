            "text": "We evaluated if interventions aimed at air travellers can delay establishment of a SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in a previously unaffected country. Methods: For countries with no sustained SARS-CoV-2 transmission and with no shared border with affected regions we simulated arriving infected air travellers. We assessed the effectiveness of syndromic screening at departure and/or arrival & traveller sensitisation to the COVID-2019-like symptoms with the aim to trigger rapid self-isolation and reporting on symptom onset to enable contact tracing. We assumed that syndromic screening would reduce the number of infected arrivals and that traveller sensitisation reduce the average number of secondary cases. We report the minimal expected delay achievable in 50% (75% & 97.5%) of simulations. In the simulations we account for uncertainty in the number of secondary cases in the absence of air traveller targeted interventions and the arrival times of infected cases and also present sensitivity analyses on arrival rates of infected travellers and the effectiveness of traveller sensitisation. Results: Under baseline assumptions exit and entry screening combined with traveller sensitisation can delay a local SARS-CoV-2 outbreak by at least 83 (75% of simulations: at least 36, 97.5% 8) days while there is no more than 1 infected traveller per week. The benefit of entry screening is small if exit screening is effective: the combination of only exit screening and traveller sensitisation can delay an outbreak by at least 76 (75%: 33, 97.5%: 7) days. With increasing rates of infected travellers, less effective sensitisation or without screening these delays shrink rapidly to a week or less. Conclusion: Syndromic screening and traveller sensitisation in combination could delay outbreaks in yet unaffected countries and support local containment efforts, but only if infected traveller numbers are very low.",

Sensitising arriving travellers to the symptoms and risk of SARS-CoV-2 and to encourage selfisolation as well as rapidly seeking for medical assistance via telephone which in turn will trigger tracing and quarantine of contacts, may have a more pronounced effect and is currently implemented in many transport hubs. However, with increasing numbers of infected travellers contact tracing is unlikely to be sustainable for long because of the immensely resourceintensive nature of contact tracing and hence is similarly unlikely to prevent local transmission in the long term (7) .",

We investigate here how syndromic screening and traveller sensitisation, as well as their combination, may delay an outbreak of SARS-CoV-2. We find that while there is only about 1 infected traveller per week, syndromic airport screening can only slightly delay an outbreak (9 days (75%: 4 days, 97.5%: less than 1 day) while traveller sensitisation can have a more pronounced effect be delaying the outbreak by 29 days (75%: 12 days, 97.5%: 3 days). The combination of syndromic screening and traveller sensitisation may more substantially delay an outbreak while the number of infected travellers is low (83 days, 75%: 36 days, 97.5% 8 days). The incremental effect of syndromic entry screening is only notable if exit screening is poor. Once the weekly number of infected passengers increases to 10 and above, even with the combination of syndromic screening and traveller sensitisation delays of more than a week are unlikely. These results are sensitive to a number of key assumptions: with increasing R 0 , less heterogeneous R 0 or less effect of traveller sensitisation the estimated achievable delay quickly becomes negligible We find a potential role for interventions targeting air-passengers to delay major outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 in previously unaffected regions as long as implemented when there are only a few infected travellers per week. We find that syndromic screening on arrival can add to the effect of traveller sensitisation in these early stages of a pandemic. Syndromic screening can also aid to reduce the number of passengers that would eventually self-report and then require resource-intensive follow up, including contact tracing. Therefore, syndromic screening may have an additional role in helping to sustain control efforts for longer. Of note, however, is that syndromic screening at arrival only substantially adds to control efforts if syndromic screening at departure is absent or largely ineffective.",

With increasing numbers of infected travellers, a higher number of secondary infections or a lower heterogeneity thereof, or less effective interventions, the achievable delay quickly drops down to a few days of delay. While all of our assumptions include the best knowledge on SARS-CoV-2 to date, there is considerable uncertainty associated with all of these assumptions. For example, we have assumed recently reported heterogeneity in the individual R 0 , however, the reported range of uncertainty includes SARS-like and influenza-like which can drastically alter the results. Some recent, yet not peer-reviewed estimates would suggest more SARS-like or even more overdispersed k which would imply that longer outbreak delays are possible as shown in our sensitivity analysis (14) . We also don't explicitly account for potential asymptomatic transmission. However, we implicitly do so as both the syndromic screening as well as the contact tracing work that informed our estimates accounted for a small proportion of asymptomatic transmitters who we assume similarly transmit but will not be affected by syndromic screening or sensitisation. Notably, we assumed a constant rate of infected travellers. However, this may increase rapidly as the epidemic continues to spread exponentially in China and potentially elsewhere. There is currently little evidence for an exponential increase in infected travellers to Europe as airports in the highest risk regions in China have shut. If .
