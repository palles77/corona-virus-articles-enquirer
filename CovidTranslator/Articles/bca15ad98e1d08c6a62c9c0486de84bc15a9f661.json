Despite recommendations that examining hematological and biochemical parameters as part of the diagnostic workup for NCIP [3, 9] , it is urgent to evaluate the ability of these features to accurately discriminate cases of NCIP from cases of CAP.

Multivariate analysis demonstrated the laboratory indexes independently discriminating NCIP from CAP. The OR of the factors to predict NCIP versus CAP were shown in table 3. The ROC curves and AUC (figures 2) demonstrated that RDW (AUC, 0.88) and HGB (AUC, 0.82) had good discriminatory ability. Red blood cell (RBC), albumin (ALB), eosinophil (EO), hematocrit (HCT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and white blood cell (WBC)had fair discriminatory ability. Furthermore, the cutoff value for RDW could be 13.35 that provided a reasonable sensitivity (79.8%) or specificity (85.1%).",
