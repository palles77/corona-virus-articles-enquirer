However there have been a wide variety in reported proportion of cases that are asymptomatic or only show mild non-specific symptoms. Making it difficult to estimate the number of cases of COVID-19 without widespread testing which has not yet been implemented in any country. While frequently case fatality rate has been calculated by comparing spot dates in 24 hours to spot confirmed cases in the same 24 hours, this is inaccurate (1) . Accurately estimating the prevalence of COVID-19 will allow organisations to make better informed decisions to control COVID-19. The majority of testing is currently being done with Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) methodology which can be done in real-time at some labs, confirmation may use Nucleic Acid Amplification Test (NAAT) methodology (2) . As infections outstrip testing capacity we risk infectious casing slipping through our fingers, without confirmation it's possible some quarantine subjects will be less willing to self-isolate increasing the likelihood of further spread.",

Increasing the mortality would reduce the estimated prevalence but this alone could not make the estimates agree with the confirmed cases in order of magnitude due to our models robustness to varying case fatality ratio in the region of current estimates. This methodology would be applicable to many other conditions and relies only on accurate estimate of deaths due to the condition which can easily be confirmed post-mortem and case mortality (when lower end estimates are above 2%). Without incubation date or data on disease progression an accurate estimate can still be produced but will not provide temporal information but could be used to estimate the time from infection to death.",

Our estimate of point prevalence varies proportionally to the error in deaths. Deaths due to infection not reported will cause an underestimate in prevalence. Estimating true mortality rates is difficult, and our estimate varies with the reciprocal of the error in the mortality rate. Underestimating mortality will lead to increase in predicted cases. As shown in Figure 3 due to this our model is relatively robust for an error in case fatality ratio 4-10%, which is comparable to reported case fatality ratio estimates. This is an evolving pandemic and due to the long incubation and time to death periods only a short period of point prevalence's can be estimated. Especially during the incubation period it's possible for those infected with SARS-CoV2 to travel into Italy, meaning cases predicted may not have acquired the infection in Italy. 5 All rights reserved.
