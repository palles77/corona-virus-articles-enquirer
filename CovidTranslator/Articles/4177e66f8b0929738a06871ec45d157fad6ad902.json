Methods: Fifty-one patients with SARS of severe type were observed with synchronous non-randomized controlled method. They were divided into the ICWM group (29 .patients) and the western medicine (WM) group (22 patients). Western medical treatment was applied to both groups, but to the ICWM group, Chinese medicine was given additionally. The therapeutic course was 2--3 weeks for both groups. Clinical effect and changes of T-lymphocyte subsets (CD4 + ) after treatment were observed.",

The excess immune reaction could cause high consumption of immune cells, so as to bring about the full-scale reduction of Tqymphocyte subsets in a short time. Therefore, the abnormal immune activation or excess immune reaction is the predominant factor that causes reduction of T-lymphocyte subsets, and also the main risk factor that accelerates the development of the disease. The lower the level of Tqymphocyte subsets, the stronger the activation of immune function and the severer the inflammatory reaction of tissues, and it goes without saying that this will result in quicker development and higher severity of the disease. For this reason, we believe that the level of T-lymphocyte subsets could be taken as one of the indexes for evaluating the severity of the disease and prognosis of SARS patients.",
