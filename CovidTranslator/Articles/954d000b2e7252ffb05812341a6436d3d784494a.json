Some of them included The Korean Society of Infectious Diseases, The Korean Society of Chemotherapy, The Korean Society of Laboratory Medicine, The Korean Society of Healthcare-Association for Infection Control and Prevention and The Korean Association of Infection Control for Nurses.On June 11th all hospitals in South Korea performed a pneumonia surveillance, over 1,064 hospitals joined this surveillance. Seven patients were confirmed by the pneumonia and then transferred from the hospitals that were exposed by MERS. After that day all patients tested negative in MERS PCR tests. Daily monitoring of newly admitted pneumonia patients were performed at several local hospitals. This survey of pneumonia helped us to define if suspected patients had dissolved or not.Since June 11th, 2016, we recommended that the MERS Free (assured) Hospital, MERS Screening Hospital, and MERS treatment Hospitals be appointed by the government. Two hundred eighty seven MERS Free (assured) Hospitals were designated for Isolating patients with pneumonia to single rooms and the MERS PCR was routinely performed. Three hundred ninety seven MERS Screening Hospitals were designated as a result, for example: screening respiratory infection patients in MERS prescreening units. Forty eight MERS treatment Hospital were designated.",
