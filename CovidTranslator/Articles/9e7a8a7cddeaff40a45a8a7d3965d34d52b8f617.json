Endemic strains of PEDV were isolated from different areas, and the complete genome sequences of 10 isolates were determined. Our objective in this study was to genetically characterize current Chinese field isolates of PEDV to better understand their epidemiology and genetic diversity. Sequence analysis showed that 10 post-2010 isolates shared high homology with each other and were always clustered together with the virulent DR13 strains (South Korea) and/or one earlier Chinese strain, CH-S, in phylogenetic analysis. All post-2010 isolates possessed common sequence changes in each gene. Our results suggest that current Chinese PEDV isolates originated from either South Korean and/or Chinese ancestors that underwent some genetic variation, thereby forming a new PEDV genotype in China.",

The virus is the etiological agent of porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED), an acute and highly contagious enteric disease characterized by watery diarrhea, vomiting, dehydration, and high mortality in nursery piglets [1] . PEDV was first recognized as the causative agent of PED in Belgium [2] and the United Kingdom in 1978 [3] . The presence of PED in China was confirmed, by immunofluorescence assays and serum neutralization tests, in 1984. Bivalent killed or attenuated vaccines have been used to prevent transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) and PED in China since then. Clinical PED outbreaks have reemerged in the major pigproducing areas of China since December 2010, resulting in major losses of suckling piglets. Morbidity rates between 90 and100 % have been observed, with mortalities of 70-100 % on affected pig farms [4] .",

A number of molecular investigations have been conducted, revealing different levels of variation in nucleotide sequences among PEDV isolates [5] [6] [7] . Because of incomplete genomic information, most molecular epidemiological analyses have targeted a single gene of PEDV. To date, complete genome sequences of 18 PEDV strains, including 10 endemic Chinese isolates, have been submitted to the GenBank database [4, [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] . To better understand the diversity, epidemiology and molecular characteristics of PEDV isolates in China, we sequenced the complete genome of a virulent PEDV strain from Henan Province, China. This isolate was from a suckling piglet that exhibited severe diarrhea. We compared its genomic sequence with those of other Chinese PEDV isolates and reference strains.",

These were then centrifuged (10,0009g, 15 min, 4\u00b0C) in a Sorvall ST 16R microcentrifuge (Fisher Scientific, MA, USA) and filtered through a 0.22-lm filter (Millipore, MA, USA) for use as inocula. Vero E6 cells were seeded onto 21-cm 2 tissue culture plates 24 h prior to infection. The growth medium was Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Life Technologies, NY, USA) supplemented with 10 % heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 100 U/ml penicillin G, and 100 lg/ml streptomycin. When confluent, growth medium was removed, and cell monolayers were washed once with PBS and then with DMEM containing 0.3 % tryptose phosphate broth and 0.02 % yeast extract. The washed cells were infected with the filtered intestinal preparation that had been resuspended in 'infection medium' (DMEM, 0.3 % tryptose phosphate broth, 0.02 % yeast extract, and 10 lg/ml trypsin). After adsorption at 37\u00b0C for 1 h, an equal volume of infection medium was added. Every 24 h, the culture supernatants were supplied with trypsin at 80 % of the initial concentration. PEDV strain CH/ZMDZY/11 was identified by amplifying structural and non-structural genes of the virus using PEDV-specific primers in a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).",

The PEDV strain prevailing in China has developed several mutations in its genome. The majority of the 10 post-2010 Chinese PEDV strains were isolated from farms where breeding herds were immunized with inactivated or attenuated PEDV vaccines.

Our findings indicate that the current PEDV isolate prevailing in China is a novel strain with a variant S gene that is distinct from previous Chinese and reference strains. This could explain the lesseffective immunological protection against PEDV strains induced by the current vaccine in China, and the effectiveness of feeding sows feces or intestinal contents of infected piglets. Further investigation of the antigenic differences among current isolates and the vaccine strain used in China is necessary for the development of an effective vaccine against PED in China.",
