Currently, there is no effective treatment for this epidemic. However, the viral protease of a coronavirus is well-known to be essential for its replication and thus is an effective drug target. Fortunately, the sequence identity of the 2019-nCoV protease and that of severe-acute respiratory syndrome virus (SARS-CoV) is as high as 96.1%. We show that the protease inhibitor binding sites of 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV are almost identical, which means all potential anti-SARS-CoV chemotherapies are also potential 2019-nCoV drugs. Here, we report a family of potential 2019-nCoV drugs generated by a machine intelligence-based generative network complex (GNC). The potential effectiveness of treating 2019-nCoV by using some existing HIV drugs is also analyzed.",

            "text": "A cluster of pneumonia cases of unknown cause emerged with connections to Huanan South China Seafood Market in Wuhan city, Hubei Province of China in late December 2019. On January 7, 2020, a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA coronavirus (CoV) was identified as the causative agent, and the World Health Organization (WHO) named this novel coronavirus as 2019-nCoV on January 10. By January 30, a total of 9692 confirmed cases with 213 deaths had been reported in the world. As reported in, 1 in comparison with the basic reproduction number (R 0 ) of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic, which is about 4.91, R 0 of the 2019-nCoV epidemic was estimated as high as 6.47, which implies the severity of this widespread dissemination caused by 2019-nCoV. Under the current health emergency, many researchers around the world engaged in the investigation of the genetic and functional data of 2019-nCoV and compare to other coronaviruses to design proper infection control strategy 2, 3 and seek potential drugs that can prevent and/or cure this serious epidemic. [4] [5] [6] [7] On January 10, the genome sequence of 2019-nCoV was first released on GenBank (accession MN908947) by Yong-Zhen Zhang's group at Fudan University. 8 Subsequently, phylogenetic analysis revealed that 2019-nCoV belonged to the Betacoronavirus genera and its closest whole-genome relatives are two SARS-like coronaviruses from bats, i.e., ZC45 and ZXC21, which shared about 89% sequence identity with 2019-nCoV. 6, 7 Moreover, detailed sequence alignment data indicates that there is significant genetics distance between the 2019-nCoV and the human SARS-CoV. Therefore, the 2019-nCoV should be considered as a new type of bat coronavirus. However, this observation raised a worth-thinking issue whether the 2019-nCoV has the same infective mechanisms as the human SARS-CoV.",

Further structural similarity analysis showed and confirmed that the S-protein of 2019-nCoV uses the same human cell receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as SARS-CoV. 4, 10 Therefore, similar approaches can be applied to prevent the S-protein binding with the receptor ACE2.",

            "text": "S-protein is one of the four proteins in coronavirus, which can be cleaved by a host cell furin-like protease (non-structural protein in coronavirus) into two functional units, S1 and S2. S1 makes up the large receptorbinding domain (RBD) to facilitates virus infection by binding to host receptors and S2 forms the stalk of the spike molecule. 11 Therefore, one possible way to control the infection is to seek protease inhibitors to prevent the S-protein of 2019-nCoV cleaved into S1. Another possible way is to seek specific drugs that have the ability to inhibit RBD binding to host receptors. However, consider the fact that the diversity of CoV is reflected in the variable S-proteins and the gene of S-protein is easy to mutate, [12] [13] [14] [15] it is not economical to design a new drug to prevent the RBD binding to host receptor directly. Moreover, considering the high sequence identity between viral proteases of 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV, seeking protease inhibitors to treat respiratory diseases induced by SARS and this novel pneumonia will be our first choice. Viral proteases are common targets in dealing with human viruses such as the HIV virus and hepatitis C virus. Protease inhibitors are remarkably effective in blocking the replication of coronavirus, including the SARS and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), providing a promising foundation for the development of anticoronaviral therapeutics. An overview of SARS-CoV 3CL protease inhibitors has been reported. 16 However, currently, there are no effective anti-SARS-CoV drugs available despite there are more than 3500 publications. It is true that there were only 8422 infected cases and 916 deaths reported for SARS-CoV, which might make the drug development unprofitable. The fact that we are unprepared for another coronaviral pandemic, like the Wuhan coronavirus outbreak, causes the world economy trillion dollars, not to mention the loss of many lives.",

It is often used as a fixed-dose combination with another protease inhibitor, ritonavir, sold under the name Kaletra or Aluvia. Ritonavir, sold under the trade name Norvir, is another antiretroviral medication. Its combination with Lopinavir is known as highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Although there is no tractable clinical evidence, Kaletra or Aluvia has been proposed as a potential anticoronavirus drug for 2019-nCoV. The possibility of repurposing some HIV drugs for SARS-CoV treatment has also studied in the literature. 16 It is important to evaluate their binding affinities, which are obtained with two ligand-based methods (i.e., LS-BP and 2DFP) and two 3D models (3DALL and 3DMT). To carry out 3D model predictions, we dock them to the 2019-nCoV protease inhibition site. The resulting complexes are optimized with molecular dynamics and then evaluated by 3DALL and 3DMT. Table 1 shows the low sequence identity between HIV viral protease and 2019-nCoV protease, which might suggest the limited potential for repurposing Aluvia and Norvir for 2019-nCoV treatment. For Lopinavir, our LS-BP and 2DFP predicted the binding affinities of -5.66 kcal/mol and -5.54 kcal/mol, respectively. For Ritonavir, similar low binding affinities of -5.14 kcal/mol and -4.96 kcal/mol were predicted by our LS-BP and 2DFP, respectively. However, our 3D model 3DALL predicted better binding affinities, i.e., -7.78 kcal/mol and -8.44 kcal/mol for Lopinavir and Ritonavir, respectively. The other 3D model, 3DMT, also predicted moderately high binding affinities of -8.13 kcal/mol and -8.07 kcal/mol for Lopinavir and Ritonavir, respectively. Considering the fact that the small training set for LS-BP and 2DFP models is very small, the results predicted by 3D models are more reliable. Figures 20 and 21 indicate that these drugs have reasonable dock poses with 2019-nCoV protease. Therefore, HIV drugs Kaletra (or Aluvia) and Norvir might indeed have a moderate effect in the treatment of 2019-nCoV. However, Many new compounds generated by our GNC appear to have better druggable properties than these HIV inhibitors do. epidemic. Although we know quite a little about 2019-nCoV, it is fortunate that the sequence identity of the 2019-nCoV protease and that of severe acute respiratory syndrome virus (SARS-CoV) is as high as 96.1%. In this work, we show that the protease inhibitor binding sites of 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV are almost identical, which provides a foundation for us to hypothesize that all potential anti-SARS-CoV chemotherapies are also effective anti-2019-CoV molecules. Additionally, we employed a recently developed generative network complex (GNC) to seek potential protease inhibitors for effective treatment of pneumonia caused by 2019-nCoV. Two datasets 13 .

One is a SARS-CoV protease inhibitor dataset, which is constructed by collecting 115 SRAS-CoV inhibitors from open database ChEMBL. The other dataset is a binding affinity training set mainly containing the PDBbind refined set. Our GNC model predicts over 8000 potential anti-2019-nCoV drugs which are evaluated by a latent space binding predictor (LS-BP) and a 2D fingerprint predictor (2DFP). Promising drug candidates are further evaluated by two 3D deep learning models trained with all the training sets together, including the dataset for coronaviral protease (3DALL), and the 3D deep learning multitask model trained with the dataset for coronaviral protease as a separated task (3DMT). Furthermore, we choose 15 potential anti-2019-nCoV drugs to analyze partition coefficient (logP), solubility (logS), and synthetic accessibility score (SAscore) according to binding affinity ranking computed by the 3DALL model. The reasonable logP, logS, and SAscore show that our top 15 anti-2019-nCoV drug candidates are potentially effective for inhibiting 2019-nCoV. Finally, the effectiveness of some anti-HIV/AIDS drugs for treating 2019-nCoV is analyzed. Although HIV drugs Kaletra (or Aluvia) and Norvir might indeed have a moderate effect in the treatment of 2019-nCoV, the analysis of these anti-HIV/AIDS drugs together with our top 15 anti-2019-nCoV molecules shows that the new compounds generated by our GNC appear to have better druggable properties than these HIV inhibitors do.",
