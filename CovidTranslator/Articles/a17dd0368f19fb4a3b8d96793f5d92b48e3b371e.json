Risk factors for coinfection included: male gender (OR 1.70, 95% CI 0.83-3.46), 6 mos-1 yr age (OR 2.15,, and history of immunosuppression (OR 2.05, 95% CI 0.99-4.23).

[3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] Furthermore, the interpretation of results from these studies is complicated by the numerous differences in study design including the methods of pathogen detection employed, the composition of the respiratory pathogen panel included in analysis, and the specific patient population being studied. However, results from recent studies suggest a role for polymicrobial infections as a cause of severe viral ARIs. 4, 5, 8, 9, 12, 14, 18, [23] [24] [25] Our primary objectives were to describe the epidemiology of polymicrobial ARI in children and to investigate the association of polymicrobial infection and severity of illness. The central hypothesis of the study was that among children with ARI, those who were infected with multiple viruses were more likely to have severe illness than those individuals with single virus infections.",

Male gender, age between 6 months to 1 year, and history of immunosuppression were associated with increased odds of viral coinfection (p>0.05). Few studies have identified host factors that may predispose a child to respiratory coinfections. In a study of patients less than 14 years old hospitalized with ARI in China, Peng et al. noted that coinfection was more common in children aged 3 to 6 years. 15 In a study of communityacquired pneumonia (CAP) in hospitalized and non-hospitalized children aged less than 3 years old, Cilla et al. noted that children aged less than 12 months were more likely to have a viral coinfection. 8 We hypothesized that children with viral coinfections were more likely to have severe ARI. After controlling for potential confounders, the odds ratio for ICU admission associated with virus-virus coinfection was not significant (OR 0.32, 95%CI 0.08-1.27). With respect to virus-virus coinfections, our results are similar to studies that have found no association with severity of illness. 6, 9, 10, 12, 14 In our study, however, children with viral coinfections were less likely to be admitted to the ICU than children with single virus infections. Similar results were observed by Martin et al. -viral coinfections were associated with decreased risk of oxygen requirement, extended hospital stays, and admissions to inpatient or intensive care units. 32 As this seemingly protective effect of polymicrobial infection was unexpected, we hypothesized that concurrent bacterial infections were influencing the viral coinfection results. We limited secondary analyses to virus-positive, hospitalized children with confirmed or suspected ARI for whom a bacterial test (most often culture) had been ordered during the same hospitalization that a viral test had been ordered. Children with virusbacteria coinfection, as compared to children with single virus infection, were more likely to be admitted to an ICU (OR 5.58, 95% CI 1.95-15.96) even after controlling for potential confounders In our primary analyses, children with single virus/single bacterium coinfections would have been classified as having a single virus infection since bacterial data was not included. Furthermore, it is likely that some participants for whom cultures had not been ordered had a concurrent bacterial infection. Though these undetected bacterial cases would be distributed between single virus infections and virus-virus coinfections, we suspect that a higher proportion of single virus infections would also be positive for bacterial pathogens as evidenced by the data presented in Table 3 (virus-bacteria coinfections represented 26.6% of virus-positive specimens whereas virus-virus-bacteria coinfections represented only 5.7% of virus-positive specimens). Given that a substantial proportion of children with virus-bacteria coinfections would have been classified as having single virus infections in our primary analyses and that our secondary analyses suggest these children are at increased risk of ICU admission, children with virus-virus coinfections would appear to be less likely to be admitted to the ICU as compared to children with single virus infections if bacterial coinfections are not considered. When children with virus-bacteria coinfections were removed from the analysis of virus-virus coinfection versus single virus infection, the observed odds ratio moved closer to the null. This suggests that at least part of the observed protective effect of virus-virus coinfection (p>0.05) can be explained by virus-bacteria coinfection, and that perhaps undetected bacterial coinfections could account for the remaining effect.",

            "text": "The epidemiologic and clinical importance of mixed respiratory infections are areas of ongoing research. Coinfection rates vary widely among studies and are estimated to account for 8.4% to 36.1% of ARIs for which at least one virus was detected. 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 15-17, 20, 21 Results from some studies suggest that children infected with two or more viruses do not have more severe clinical illness than children infected with only one virus. 7, 10, 11, 13, 15 However, results from other studies have suggested an association between respiratory coinfections and severe illness. 4, 5, 8, 12, 14, 18, 21, 25 In the afore mentioned study of CAP by Cilla et al., age and viral coinfection were shown to be independent risk factors for hospitalization. 8 In a study of patients with LRTIs by Bharaj et al., a high proportion of children with mixed infections had severe or very severe disease. 4 Examples of coinfecting bacterial and viral pathogens are common in the literature, but reports tend to be virus-specific. 33 For example, most deaths associated with epidemics of influenza are associated with secondary bacterial infections including Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae. Associations between HAdV and Bordetella pertussis have been noted in severe respiratory disease in children. Evidence describing the importance of viral and bacterial cooperation in cases of pneumonia is growing. [34] [35] [36] [37] Jennings et al. conducted a study among patients hospitalized with CAP and demonstrated that HRV-pneumococcal coinfection was independently associated with severe pneumonia. 12 Templeton et al. included both inpatients and outpatients in their study of CAP and demonstrated that HRV-bacterial or HCoV-bacterial coinfections were independently associated with severe pneumonia. 18 Another study of children with CAP suggested that mixed viral-bacterial co-detections were associated with treatment failure. 35 Additional evidence of the interaction between bacterial and viral pathogens comes from animal studies. 33 Several mechanisms have been postulated to explain this interaction. 33 Viruses may increase the ability of bacteria to infect or adhere to mucosal surfaces through changes induced in host cell membranes. It has also been hypothesized that exudates on mucosal surfaces resulting from viral infection may increase bacterial growth. The host immune defense against bacteria could also be affected by viral infection through the inhibition of nonspecific phagocytosis. Orperhaps viral infection exacerbates the effect of bacterial toxins.",

Over-estimation of respiratory coinfections due to co-detection of asymptomatic viral shedding post-infection and acute infection with a second virus may have also occurred.
