One hundred ninety-three physicians participated, 23% of whom provided direct care to SARS patients. A significantly higher rate of psychological distress was seen among physicians providing direct care to SARS patients (45.7%) than among those not providing direct care (17.7%), and physicians providing direct care reported feeling more stigmatized. Several physicians (10.9%) reported entering the hospital despite experiencing identified SARS symptoms. The most frequent SARS concerns were about the care of non-SARS patients following suspension of nonessential services and loss of physician income.",

The SARS outbreaks caused a tremendous strain on the health care system. 7 SARS disproportionately affected health care providers, accounting for upward of 50% of those affected in Toronto. 8 In the only study published to date investigating the impact of SARS on health care workers, anecdotal retrospective descriptions revealed feelings of fear of infecting loved ones, uncertainty, anxiety, anger, guilt, and frustration. 5 While physicians deserve accolades for their tireless efforts to control the spread of this disease and treat its victims, the effect of these efforts deserves empirical scrutiny. The objective of this study was to empirically assess the psychosocial and occupational impact of SARS on academic physicians working in hospitals where infected patients are being treated.",

Our re-sults identified that physicians' main concerns were the decreased ability to care for non-SARS patients during the outbreaks and personal loss of income, both of which are novel concerns not raised in the literature regarding other infectious diseases. Consistent with the HIV literature however, 11 almost a third of physicians were concerned about spreading the infection to their family. In addition, almost one-fifth reported experiencing new distressing psychological symptoms as a result of their potential occupational exposure (almost 50% among those providing direct care).

The screening protocol does specify \"unexplained\" myalgia or malaise, \"severe\" headache, and shortness of breath that is \"worse than what is normal for you,\" and included temperature assessment. Because the self-report nature of our survey precluded deeper probing regarding physicians' perceptions regarding the severity of their symptoms or whether there was a direct alternative explanation for their symptoms, we cannot definitively conclude that physicians failed to comply with the screening precautions (although Occupational Health and the Department of Infectious Diseases reported that only a few physicians consulted them concerning their symptoms). However, our findings may reflect low perceived susceptibility, 18 a sense of invulnerability to contracting SARS, or an optimistic bias, 19 despite the fact that health care workers in affected hospitals are at greatly increased risk 20, 21 and almost half of our respondents knew an infected colleague. Considering that this behavior could lead to further transmission of this highly virulent infection, additional investigation and preventive action are imperative.",

Also, posting a questionand-answer page on the hospital intranet outlining how to talk with children about these risks might be useful.
