            "text": "Mannose-binding lectin (MBL) plays a major role in the immune response as a soluble pattern-recognition receptor. MBL deficiency and susceptibility to different types of infections have been subject to extensive studies over the last decades. In humans and chickens, several studies have shown that MBL participates in the protection of hosts against virus infections. Infectious bronchitis (IB) is a highly contagious disease of economic importance in the poultry industry caused by the coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). MBL has earlier been described to play a potential role in the pathogenesis of IBV infection and the production of IBV-specific antibodies, which may be exploited in optimising IBV vaccine strategies. The present study shows that MBL has the capability to bind to IBV in vitro. Chickens from two inbred lines (L10H and L10L) selected for high or low MBL serum concentrations, respectively, were vaccinated against IBV with or without the addition of the MBL ligands mannan, chitosan and fructooligosaccharide (FOS). The addition of MBL ligands to the IBV vaccine, especially FOS, enhanced the production of IBVspecific IgG antibody production in L10H chickens, but not L10L chickens after the second vaccination. The addition of FOS to the vaccine also increased the number of circulating CD4+ cells in L10H chickens compared to L10L chickens. The L10H chickens as well as the L10L chickens also showed an increased number of CD4\u2212CD8\u2423\u2212\u2425\u2426 T-cells when an MBL ligand was added to the vaccine, most pronouncedly after the first vaccination. As MBL ligands co-administered with IBV vaccine induced differences between the two chicken lines, these results indirectly suggest that MBL is involved in the immune response to IBV vaccination. Furthermore, the higher antibody response in L10H chickens receiving vaccine and FOS makes FOS a potential adjuvant candidate in an IBV vaccine.",

            "text": "The first line of host defence against pathogens involves the innate immune system. Pathogens have specific microorganismassociated molecular patterns (MAMPs) that are recognised by pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs). Two kinds of PRRs exist: surface PRRs and soluble PRRs. PRRs trigger intracellular signalling cascades upon MAMP recognition culminating in activation of antigen presenting cells and production of co-stimulatory molecules as well as pro-inflammatory cytokines. The production of costimulatory molecules and pro-inflammatory cytokines initiates the early host response to infection and also partakes in the activation and shaping of the adaptive immune response (Crozat et al. 2009; de Visser and Coussens 2005; Hoffmann et al. 1999) . Several soluble PRRs have been described, and an example of such is mannose-binding lectin (MBL). MBL has various functions in, for example, complement activation, promotion of complementindependent opsonophagocytosis, modulation of inflammation, recognition of altered self-structures and apoptotic cell clearance (Dommett et al. 2006) . MBL is a collectin consisting of multiple identical polypeptide chains oligomerised into different sizes. The chains are made up of four distinct domains. These are a cysteinerich N-terminal domain, a collagenous domain, a neck domain, and a calcium-dependent carbohydrate-recognition domain (CRD) at the C-terminal (Takahashi 2011) . It is the CRD that permits MBL to bind in a Ca 2+ -dependent manner to MAMPs such as polysaccharides. In fact, terminal sugars, such as d-mannose, l-fucose and N-acetyl-d-glucosamine, found on the surface of many microorganisms, contain equatorial 3-and 4-hydroxyl groups to which MBL binds. MBL does not bind to d-galactose and sialic acid found on the surface of many animal cells. Beside sugars, MBL has also been found to bind to phospholipids, nucleic acids, and non-glycosylated proteins (Ip et al. 2009 ). The MBL genes in human (Madsen et al. 1994 (Madsen et al. , 1995 Steffensen et al. 2000; Sumiya et al. 1991) , porcine (Juul-Madsen et al. 2011a; Lillie et al. 2007) , bovine (Liu et al. 2011) and chickens (Kjaerup et al. 2013) have been found to have polymorphisms resulting in wide variations in MBL serum levels in the organisms.",

This has resulted in two distinct chicken lines designated high (L10H) or low (L10L) with mean serum MBL concentrations of 33.4 g/mL serum (L10H) and 7.6 g/mL serum (L10L) (F14 generation, unpublished) . Studies using these chicken sublines as well as outbred chickens have shown an inverse relationship between the MBL concentrations and the pathogen-specific antibody response (Juul-Madsen et al. 2007; Schou et al. 2008 ). Studies in mice have shown that MBL deficiency may result in a higher IgG antibody response after infections (Carter et al. 2007 ) and vaccinations (Guttormsen et al. 2009 ). From these results it can be hypothesised that basal MBL plasma levels may influence specific humoral immune responses. This explanation for this may be that either: (1) MBL pushes the immune response into a more cellular response (Th1 vs. Th2);",

Furthermore, IB may cause a decline in egg quality and production in layers (Raj and Jones 1997) . IB is caused by the coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) which is highly able to genetically mutate and recombine. As a result, there is a continuous development of new strains throughout the world. Different strains can co-circulate within a region, and the severity of the disease varies from strain to strain and from flock to flock (Capua et al. 1999; Cavanagh 2007; Cook et al. 2012) . Consequently, applied vaccines sometimes provide insufficient protection, as vaccination with one strain of IBV may not be protective against other strains.",

Carbohydrates such as mannan (Liu et al. 2012) , chitosan (Rauw et al. 2010) , and fructooligosaccharide (FOS) (Benyacoub et al. 2008 ) have previously been used in vaccines or diets as modulators of the immune response. These three carbohydrates are potential MBL ligands owing to their content of sugar units. The hypothesis of this study was that immunity after IBV vaccination may be improved after temporarily inhibition of the MBL function. This was achieved by adding an MBL ligand (mannan, chitosan, or FOS) to the vaccine given to chickens and thereby creating an artificial MBL deficiency during vaccination. Innate as well as adaptive immunological parameters were measured throughout the experimental period.",

These assays distinguish between the CG and TA alleles of SNP1 and the GGGG and AGGA alleles of SNP2 (Kjaerup et al. 2013) . The assays were validated and run on 384-well microtitre plates in an ABI Prism 7900HT Sequence Detection System instrument, using version 2.2 of the SDS software. A total reaction volume of 10 L was applied, each sample containing 5 L TaqMan \u00ae Universal PCR MasterMix (Applied Biosystems, Life Technologies Europe BV, Naerum, Denmark; cat. no.4364338), 0.25 L assay mix, 3.75 L H 2 O, and 1 L DNA at a concentration of 5 ng/L. To ensure optimal clustering, 24 positive controls, representing animals of known genotypes, were included in each run, together with four non-template (negative) controls. Amplification was obtained through an initial incubation period of 10 min at 95 \u2022 C followed by 40 cycles of denaturation for 15 s at 92 \u2022 C and annealing/extension for 1 min at 60 \u2022 C. After amplification, end-point reads were carried out, and analysis was performed with 2-cluster calling enabled in the SDS software version 2.2.",

Binding was shown to occur through the CRD of MBL since binding was inhibited by EDTA as well as mannan. Previous studies have shown that human MBL binds to several viruses, such as HIV (Saifuddin et al. 2000) and SARS (Ip et al. 2005) . These bindings have also been shown to occur through the CRD of MBL. Further, the current study shows that MBL binds to IBV in a dosedependent manner. Besides this, it also provides evidence that FOS is an MBL ligand with the potential to inhibit MBL-IBV binding. molecules (Epstein et al. 1996; Takahashi et al. 2011 ). In the serum samples from L10H chickens chitosan showed a tendency to inhibit the MBL-IBV binding (P < 0.0513) indicating that chitosan may also be an MBL ligand. Chitosan is a highly basic polysaccharide obtained by deacetylation of chitin which is a linear polymer of N-acetyld-glucosamine (Ravi Kumar 1999) , which is known to be an MBL ligand (Epstein et al. 1996) . Chitosan is insoluble in water, which is why there is an uncertainty concerning the precise amount of chitosan added in the binding assay and to the vaccine given to the chickens. In a previous study both chitosan and its derivative N,N,Ntrimethylated chitosan (TMC) were used as adjuvants in vaccines in raccoons (Fry et al. 2012) . This study showed a higher number of responders to the vaccine when TMC was added instead of chitosan. TMC is water-soluble and have the same immunogenic and adhesive properties as chitosan (Kotze et al. 1997) , which is why, with hindsight, that TMC instead of chitosan probably would have been a better choice as a possible MBL ligand added to the IBV vaccine to avoid the uncertainty about the concentrations used.",

Previously, Juul- Madsen et al. (2011b) did not find any statistical difference in virus load between L10L and L10H chickens after vaccination. Some of the incongruence between the current study and the vaccination part of the previous study could be explained by the larger animal groups in the current study, giving a more accurate outcome. Besides, the estimation of viral load using qRT-PCR is more accurate than estimating the viral load by gel. The higher viral load in the L10L does, however, support the previous suggestions that MBL is associated with susceptibility to IBV infection (Juul-Madsen et al. 2007; Juul-Madsen et al. 2011b) .",

After the second vaccination (week 3) of chickens receiving vaccine alone no boosting effect of the vaccine was found in the two sublines. On the other hand, the IBV-specific IgG antibody titres after the second vaccination for L10H chickens receiving an MBL ligand together with the vaccine increased more than the antibody titre for L10H receiving vaccine alone (Fig. 3) . This was most pronounced for the L10H chickens receiving vaccine and FOS. This is also in contrast to the challenge study by Juul- Madsen et al. (2011b) , where the titre was lower for L10H chickens receiving mannan together with the vaccine compared with chickens receiving vaccine alone -we have no explanation for that. The antibody titres were the same for the L10L chickens between treatment groups. This, in combination with the results of the MBL-IBV binding assay, where the MBL-IBV binding was clearly inhibited by the addition of ligands in serum from L10H but not L10L, implies that the combination of high MBL serum concentrations and the addition of an MBL ligand have an impact on the development of IBV-specific IgG antibodies. An increased antibody titre has earlier been reported in chickens vaccinated against Eimeria (Janardhana et al. 2009 ) and in mice vaccinated and infected with Salmonella (Benyacoub et al. 2008 ) when feeding a diet containing FOS. The dramatic increase in the antibody titre after vaccination with FOS may be beneficial in breeding, since the transfer of maternal antibodies to offspring is of importance in protecting the newly hatched chicks. This protection would be increased by an increase in the amount of antibodies in the dams, since there is a direct relationship between IBV-specific IgG levels in the dam and those in her offspring (Hamal et al. 2006) .",

            "text": "Flow cytometry-based methods for counting absolute numbers of peripheral blood cells have previously been described (Burgess and Davison 1999; Seliger et al. 2012 ). In the current study flow cytometry was used to identify phenotypic differences between the chicken sublines vaccinated with or without the addition of MBL-ligand. No general differences were observed in the amount of total CD4+ cells for both sublines and between treatment groups. Nor was any difference between the two sublines within each treatment group observed in groups 1, 2 and 3. However, the addition of FOS to the vaccine gave a higher number of total CD4+ cells in the L10H chickens than in the L10L chickens (Fig. 5) . Despite of this, no difference in the amount of B-cells at week 9 PV1 (Table 2) was observed in this group, indicating that the increase may have been caused by Th1-cells instead of Th2-cells. This is supported by a study by Guo et al. (2008) which indicates that Th1-cells are activated immediately after IBV infection. The response of CD4\u2212CD8\u2423+ cells, mostly cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTL), is crucial for the elimination of the virus from local infection sites (Collisson et al. 2000; Guo et al. 2008; Juul-Madsen et al. 2011b ). An increased number of CD4\u2212CD8\u2423+ cells were indeed observed in the current study both PV1 and PV2 which may support the suggestions by Collisson et al. (2000) that CTLs are important in the protection against IBV. However, this increase was repressed in L10H chickens treated with Fig. 4A and B. The absolute counts of total CD4+ cells are shown in the left column, the absolute counts of CD4\u2212CD8\u2423+ cells are shown in the middle column, and the absolute counts of CD4\u2212CD8\u2423\u2212 cells are shown in the right column. The upper panels show the comparison of sublines in group 1, the second upper panels the comparison of sublines in group 2, the second lower panels the comparison of sublines in group 3, and the lower panels the comparison of sublines in group 4.

For the three groups receiving vaccine and an MBL ligand, the \u2425\u2426 T-cell response was more pronounced in the L10H chickens than in the L10L chickens PV1 (Fig. 5) . There was also a tendency (P = 0.0517) for this in the group receiving vaccine alone. This increase was also observed in the study by Juul- Madsen et al. (2011b) . This study showed a higher increase in the percentage of \u2425\u2426 T-cells after IBV vaccination in the group receiving vaccine and mannan. In the current study no difference was observed in the \u2425\u2426 T-cell response PV2 between L10H and L10L chickens within treatment groups (Fig. 5) . These inconsistencies may be explained by the use of live virus in the previous study versus the use of attenuated live virus in the current study as already suggested.

The results of the current study may support these indications since our results showed that CD4\u2212CD8\u2423\u2212\u2425\u2426 T-cells are increased after IBV vaccination when MBL is inhibited.",

These findings support the suggestions made by Guttormsen et al. (2009) that an increased IgG response in MBL-deficient mice is not only attributed to an increase in the number of B-cells. The increase in IgG may also have been caused by Ig class switching, as previously observed in mice for dietary FOS by Nakamura et al. (2004) . Previous challenge studies have shown an up regulation of IgG in species with low amount of MBL in both mice (Guttormsen et al. 2009 ) and chickens (Juul-Madsen et al. 2007 ). Likewise, Ruseva et al. (2009) argue that genetic environment influences the modifying effect of MBL. We cannot conclude whether the different amounts of Bcells at week 9 PV1 observed in chickens receiving vaccine alone in the current study was caused by vaccine or age.

The addition of FOS to the vaccine also increased the number of total CD4+ cells in L10H chickens, in combination with an unchanged amount of B-cells at week 9 PV1 compared to L10L chickens. The L10H chickens as well as the L10L chickens also showed an increased number of CD4\u2212CD8\u2423\u2212\u2425\u2426 T-cells when an MBL ligand was added to the vaccine, most pronouncedly after the first vaccination, suggesting that CD4\u2212CD8\u2423\u2212\u2425\u2426 T-cells may also play a role in the immune response against IBV. These results indicate, as previously suggested by Juul- Madsen et al. (2011b) that MBL is involved in the adaptive immune response to IBV vaccination. MBL inhibition may therefore be beneficial to achieve high antibody response during vaccinations. Further studies are needed to elucidate whether the addition of MBL ligands to IBV vaccine gives a better immune protection against IBV infection.
