The epidemic has brought not only the risk of death from infection but also unbearable psychological pressure. We sampled college students from Changzhi medical college by using cluster sampling. They responded to a questionnaire packet that included the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7) and those inquiring the participants' basic information. We received 7,143 responses. Results indicated that 0.9% of the respondents were experiencing severe anxiety, 2.7% moderate anxiety, and 21.3% mild anxiety. Moreover, living in urban areas (OR = .810, 95% CI = .709 -.925), family income stability (OR = .726, 95% CI = .645 -.817) and living with parents (OR = .752, 95% CI = .596 -.950) were protective factors against anxiety. Moreover, having relatives or acquaintances infected with COVID-19 was a risk factor for increasing the anxiety of college students (OR = 3.007, 95% CI = 2.377 -3.804). Results of correlation analysis indicated that economic effects, and effects on daily life, as well as delays in academic activities, were positively associated with anxiety symptoms (P < .001). However, social support was negatively correlated with the level of anxiety (P < .001). It is suggested that the mental health of college students should be monitored during epidemics.",

The epidemic brought not only the risk of death from the viral infection but also unbearable psychological pressure to people in China and the rest of the world (Xiao, 2020; Duan, 2020) . The continuous spread of the epidemic, strict isolation measures and delays in starting schools, colleges, and universities across the country is expected to influence the mental health of college students.

Among the sample of 7143 college students, approximately two-third were women 67 (0.94%). The respondents lived in Hubei Province; 43.83% lived in rural areas, 95.4% lived with their parents, and 52.86% of the parents of students did not have a steady income. Most participants (99.45%) had no relatives or acquaintances who were infected with COVID-19. Table 1 shows how the mental health of college students was affected to varying degrees during the outbreak. Of the 7143 college students, about three-quarters (75.1%) had no symptoms of anxiety, whereas the proportions of students with mild, moderate, and severe anxiety were 21.3%, 2.7%, and 0.9%, respectively. Table 2 shows the relationship between the demographic variables of students and anxiety. Living with parents had a significant effect on anxiety, such that students living alone had increased anxiety (P < .05), whereas gender and region had no significant effect on anxiety (P > .05). Moreover, students from rural areas (1.02%), families without a steady income (1.09%), not living with parents (1.13%), and having a relative or an acquaintance infected with COVID-19 (2.56%), were more likely to be severely anxious (P < .001). The results indicated that living in urban areas, in contrast to rural areas, was a protective factor against anxiety experienced by the participants (OR = .810, 95% CI = .709 -.925). The stability of students' family income (OR = 0.726, 95% CI = .645 -.817) and living with parents (OR = .752, 95% CI = .596 -.950) were also protective factors against anxiety. However, having a relative or an acquaintance infected with COVID-19 was a risk factor for anxiety (OR = 3.007, 95% CI = 2.377 -3.804). ",

This survey indicated that 24.9% of college students were afflicted with experienced anxiety because of the COVID-19 outbreak. Of these students, 0.9% experienced severe anxiety, and 21.3% experienced mild anxiety. College students' anxiety about COVID-19 might have been related to the effect of the virus on their studies (Cornine et al., 2020) and future employment . On the other hand, the students' anxiety may have been caused by the gradually increasing distances between people resulting from the quarantine.

The results of this study indicated college students' anxiety regarding the epidemic was associated with their place of residence, source of parental income, whether living with parents and whether a relative or an acquaintance was infected with COVID-19. However, no significant difference in gender or region was indicated, which is different from previous findings (Moreno et al., 2019) .

            "text": "Multivariate Logistic regression analysis suggested that living in urban areas, in contrast to rural areas, was conducive to reducing the anxiety of college students. This might be explained by the imbalance of economic, cultural, and educational resources between urban and rural areas. The urban economy is relatively prosperous and provides citizens with better material security (Shigemura et al., 2020) . Similarly, the sanitary conditions in cities are better than in towns and villages, which decreases the chances of surviving the virus. Cities also have excellent educational resources, and they have made great efforts to publicize knowledge on how to prevent the epidemic, which attracts attention to the measures taken to stop the epidemic . The stability of family income was also was a significant factor in students' experienced anxiety during the COVID-19 crisis, which could be explained by increased psychological and economic pressure (Liu, 2013) . Living with parents was another favorable factor against feeling anxious. Previous studies have indicated that the risk factors associated with emotional and anxiety disorders in adults include the death of parents in childhood, not living with parents, and parents' psychological problems and mental illnesses (Woodgate et al.,2020; Gentili et al., 2020) , which are consistent with the results of this study. Relatives or acquaintances being infected with COVID-19 was an independent risk factor in college students' anxiety about the epidemic, which might be related to the high contagiousness of the new coronavirus pneumonia (World Health Organization, 2020; Song et al., 2019) . Consistent with our hypothesis, the COVID-19-related stressors, which include economic stressors, effects on daily-life, and academic delays, were positively associated with anxiety symptoms of Chinese college students during the epidemic. Similar studies (Kernan, 2019) have indicated that in addition to the national health situation, the epidemic will also have a significant impact on the economy of the country and individuals. Because of the outbreak, some families will lose their source of income, and students might feel anxious about paying their tuition fees (Peng et al., 2012) . In China, the government took measures, including travel warnings and bans, and extending the national holidays to control the outbreak, which inevitably disrupted routine life and resulted in anxiety. In the mainland China and Hong Kong, all primary and secondary schools were closed, and universities were either postponing classes until March 2020 or were using distant/remote learning methods (Kwok et al., 2020) . These measures undoubtedly have a specific impact on the education and the growth of students. Finally, social support was negatively correlated with the anxiety of college students, which is consistent with previous findings (Thompson et al., 2016; . Social support not only reduces the psychological pressure during the epidemics but also changes the attitude regarding social support and help-seeking methods. This result suggests that effective and robust social support is necessary during public health emergencies (Bai et al., 2005) .",
