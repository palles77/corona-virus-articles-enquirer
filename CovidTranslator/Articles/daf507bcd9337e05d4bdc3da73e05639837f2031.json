Regulation of TLR4 signaling is incompletely understood. TLR5, the 28 flagellin receptor, is expressed in alveolar macrophages, and regulates immune responses to 29 environmental injury. Using in vivo animal models of TLR4-mediated inflammations (LPS, O3, 30 hyaluronan), we show that TLR5 impacts the in vivo response to LPS, hyaluronan and O3. We 31 demonstrate that immune cells of human carriers of a dominant negative TLR5 allele have 32 decreased inflammatory response to O3 exposure ex vivo and LPS exposure in vitro. Using 33 primary murine macrophages, we find that TLR5 physically associates with TLR4 and biases 34 TLR4 signaling towards the MyD88 pathway.

Recent evidence highlights 205 the role of molecules of the TLR4 receptor complex in modulating TLR4 signaling. For example, 206 elegant work has demonstrated that CD14, which is necessary for LPS binding to TLR4, also 207 controls TLR4 endocytosis after LPS ligation, and thus is necessary for TRIF signaling, which is 208 thought to occur in the endosomal compartment (41). Our work further suggests that TLR4 209 signaling is modulated by the addition of TLR5 to the receptor complex. Unlike CD14, TLR5 does 210 not appear to regulate LPS-induced internalization of TLR4 (Supplementary Fig. 5C ). Our 211 findings rather support a model in which TLR5 selectively promotes TLR4/MyD88 signaling at the 212 plasma membrane and is not required for CD14 regulation of the TRIF pathway. Importantly, our 213 work suggests that TLR5 regulation of TLR4 signaling is biologically significant. TLR5-deficient 214 mice had approx. 30-50% decreased cytokine expression in local and systemic LPS models of 215 lung inflammation, while airway hyperresponsiveness after ozone or hyaluronan exposure was 216 significantly reduced, and inflammatory gene induction after hyaluronan exposure was abolished. 217",
