Shenzhen City in Guangdong Province was the first Special Economic Zone established by the central government in 1980 to spearhead its reform program and is also the most successful one. The enthusiasm for the market economy was also kindled by Deng Xiaoping, the former Chinese leader, during his \"southern tour\" to this province in 1992. Consequently, the reform of the publishing industry in Guangdong was a step ahead of many other regions as signaled by the fact that GDPG and Shanghai Century Publishing Group were the first two publishing groups endorsed by the government administration department. However, in comparison with Shanghai, which is a municipality, the structure of the publishing industry in Guangdong is more representative of China's provincial publishing groups.",

Although book publishing remains its core business, it As we have noted in earlier chapters, the economic sustainability of the book publishing business in China is by no means secure. Profit margins are generally low and the market is already saturated. In response to these uncertainties, GDPG made a concerted effort to identify new profit sources. Digital publishing and newspaper publishing, which fell within the administrative boundary of the General Administration of Press and Publication (GAPP), were seen as plausible options. A weekly newspaper, Time Weekly (shidai zhoubao), and a digital publishing company were launched in 2008 and 2009, respectively. As some subsidiary publishing houses of GDPG engaged in magazine publishing, GDPG operated in all business areas of print media.",

At that time, there were parallel controlling bodies over the local publishing industry within both provincial Party organs and government. According to Wu et al. (1997: 335) , the main responsibility of the local Party propaganda department was to provide political guidance and direction, exercise censorship, and crack down on illegal publications, and its main goal was to prevent \"the publishing course from deviating from socialist publishing direction.\" At the same time, the provincial publishing administration department was charged with implementing \"the guidance and policy\" (ibid: 337) of the Party in the publishing plans of local publishers, and overseeing relevant aspects of economic planning, such as the allocation of paper and other printing materials, and coordinating business between the local publishers and Xinhua book distributors. To facilitate the smooth operation of the local publishing industry, all the key players, the Guangdong People's Publishing House, the Guangdong Provincial Xinhua Bookstore and the Guangdong Xinhua Printing Factory, were subject to the economic control of the provincial publishing administration department. When the administration department was terminated in the chaotic Cultural Revolution, the Guangdong People's Publishing House took over its responsibilities from 1971, and acquired the provincial printer, the provincial book distributor, 2 and the provincial printing material supplier. The Guangdong People's Publishing House itself was put under the control of the provincial Party propaganda department. Clearly, this enabled the party-state to control the then book industry directly when its legitimate state agent, the government administration department, was no longer functioning.",

After the central government called for the development of science and technology after the National Science Conference in March 1978, nearly all provinces established a provincial Science and Technology Publishing House. The Guangdong Science and Technology Publishing House, initially the Science and Technology Editorial Office of Guangdong People's Publishing House, was spun off and launched in May 1978. The initial success of the economic reform generated rising incomes among a population whose cultural life had been seriously impoverished during the Cultural Revolution. The subsequent surge in demand for books provided a golden opportunity for the expansion of book publishing. At the same time, commercialization, which was converting provincial publishing houses and their affiliated provincial government administration departments into profit-seeking organizations, encouraged a rapid expansion in provincial publishing as these organizations looked for increased business opportunities. As part of this process, a number of the editorial offices previously housed within the (established in 1996) . In addition, other business entities were developed to diversify activities beyond publishing. These included: the Guangdong Second Xinhua Printing Factory, the Guangdong Publishing Import and Export Company, and the Guangdong Weiya Optical Disc Company.

            "text": "As noted in earlier chapters, during the period of the planned economy, the provincial publishing administration department assumed both administrative and economic planning responsibilities for its subsidiaries 3 and under the centralized revenue collection and expenditure system (tongshou tongzhi) was obliged to return any profits generated to the government (Shirk, 1993: 199) , which provided its core funding. Following the commercialization of the publishing industry, the provincial publishing administration department and its subsidiaries were turned into profit-seeking business entities. As a result, the Guangdong Provincial Publishing Administration Bureau, although still assuming administration responsibilities, was no longer funded out of the budget of the provincial government, but out of the profits it generated itself, especially from textbook reprinting. This arrangement produced a hybrid of government bureau and business entity generating tensions that gradually increased. As more publishing businesses were spun off from the Guangdong People's Publishing House and new ones were set up, the emphasis shifted to the department's business role. 4 The profit-seeking orientation of these new publishing houses led to increased demands for the provincial publishing administration department to strengthen its administrative role, something it found difficult to do given that it was itself actively involved in pursuing business interests. This tension was addressed in 1983 when due to the governmental reshuffle the Guangdong Provincial Publishing Administration Bureau was replaced by the Guangdong Provincial Publishing General House. Although seemingly a business entity from its title, the Guangdong Provincial Publishing General House continued to assume responsibility for both administration and business. However, the continuation of this hybrid forms and its associated tensions generated increasing concern with the Party that insufficient administrative control was being exercised over a gradually commercialized publishing industry. Accordingly, in April 1986, the Guangdong Publishing General House was abolished and the Guangdong Provincial Publishing Administration Bureau (guangdong sheng chuban shiye guanli ju) restored, on the grounds that a general publishing house was \"unfavorable for the censorship of publications and unfavorable for the unified management of editing, printing and distribution\" (Wu et al., 1997: 338) . In the following March the Guangdong Provincial Publishing Administration Bureau was renamed the Guangdong Provincial Administration of Press and Publication (guangdong sheng xinwen chubanju). Although using the title of a government department, it was legally a \"public service unit managed as enterprises\" (ibid: 338), and it was not until 1995 that it became officially a department of the provincial government and its employees were given the status of civil servants (Wu et al., 1997: 46\u00c047) . However, it only started to be funded out of the budget of the provincial government from October 2001 (Ding et al., 2004) .",

To resolve the problems presented by its dual roles, the provincial publishing administration department established the Guangdong Provincial Publishing Company (guangdong sheng chuban gongsi) in 1980 to manage its core businesses in textbook reprinting and paper supply. The existence of this company was a major reason why the Guangdong Provincial Publishing General House could be abolished in 1986 while many other provincial publishing administration departments retained the title of provincial publishing general house to assume their business responsibility.

Initially the Guangdong provincial publishing administration bureau tried to register GDPG as an enterprise group but the central Party propaganda department only agreed to it being constituted as a public service unit.

At the time there were a few precedents for provincial publishing general houses and publishing groups gaining or trying to gain independence from provincial publishing administration departments. The Shandong Publishing General House managed to gain independence from the Shandong provincial publishing administration bureau in 1987, but the power struggle between the Sichuan Publishing Group Company and the Sichuan provincial publishing administration bureau at the beginning of 1990s led to the intervention of Sichuan provincial Party propaganda department (Wei, 2001: 10) . The formation and expansion of GDPG followed a similar path. Some senior staff within the Guangdong provincial publishing administration department, who were about to assume important positions within GDPG, argued that it should be independent of the administration bureau according to the principle of \"separation of government and enterprises.\" Most leaders of the provincial administration department however, due to their vested economic and power interests, opposed the independence of GDPG on the grounds that it would \"weaken the leadership of the Party over publishing\" and \"endanger the (ideological) guidance\" (Ding et al., 2004) . This contest produced a compromise. GDPG achieved nominal independence from the provincial publishing administration department and its sponsoring organization (zhuguan bumen) became the Guangdong Provincial Government. However, the provincial publishing administration department was authorized by the provincial government as its agent to supervise the operation of \"state-owned assets of the group\" (Wei, 2001: 21) . The Director of the provincial administration department also assumed the position of Chair of The Board of GDPG despite the opposition of some senior managers of the group. As a result, GDPG was still largely controlled by the administration department. In addition, a number of other provincial publishing business entities, including the Guangdong Science and Technology Publishing House, the Guangdong Xinhua Distribution Group, and the Guangdong Xinhua Printing Factory were still affiliated to the provincial publishing administration department. Although according to the original plan approved by the central party-state, the provincial publishing administration department would gradually hand over all other business subsidiaries to GDPG within a couple of years following the establishment of the group, 9 this step was halted by the provincial publishing administration department because of the continuing power struggle.",

During a visit to the group, he encouraged the merger of all provincial Xinhua bookstores, and the provincial Party leader agreed to implement this proposal. Although progress has been seen in many county level Xinhua bookstores, the overall target did not materialize. The Xinhua bookstores in Guangzhou City and Shenzhen City had both been heavily subsidized by their municipal governments with the result that it would \"compromise the economic interests\" 11 of different government departments if they were to be merged with the provincial Xinhua bookstore. Both municipal governments, sensing the potential risk of losing their control, merged their municipal publishing house with their municipal Xinhua bookstore to form municipal \"publishing groups\", 12 which forestalled the possibility of them being incorporated into the provincial distribution group. Theoretically, the hierarchical political structure should give the higher level Party organs the power to restructure the state-owned publishing industries under their administrative control. However, fiscal decentralization has \"assigned local governments property rights over increased income\" and \"created strong incentives for local officials to pursue local economic development\" (Oi, 1992 : 100). Within Guangdong province, provincial government started fiscal decentralization from 1979 giving county level governments a certain degree of fiscal independence. It is this fiscal decentralization that limited the expansion of GDPG through administrative power. The municipal Xinhua bookstores in Guangzhou City and Shenzhen City have become economically strong due to their affluent urban markets and the financial support of their municipal governments. The net asset value of the Shenzhen Xinhua bookstore alone for example was estimated to be nearly twice that of the Guangdong Provincial Xinhua Distribution Group, 13 which clearly excluded the possibility of acquisition by the latter.",

As discussed before, employees in publishing houses would receive a reduced pension following the corporatization. In addition, GDPG had introduced a new salary system, in which 70% of the income of employees would come from bonuses related to individual performance. Although higher level management would be hardly affected by this, most employees might be forced to \"dance better with shackles on\" under the dual pressures of the party line and the bottom line.",

Although provincial Party organs and governments may resist some central party-state policies in an effort to protect their economic interests, they are still required to stringently implement the principles of ideological control. According to the requirement of the Guangdong provincial Party committee, GDPG must retain the \"absolute leadership of the Party over publishing,\" uphold the Party's control over \"important decisions of publishing organizations, ownership structure, final censorship of content and appointment of leading cadres,\" and explore \"new measures\" and \"new forms\" of retaining the \"Party's control over ideology\". 19 These requirements were enforced by administrative arrangements whereby GDPG's board of directors, management board, and supervisory board, were all controlled by the Party. These boards operated on the principle of \"mutual entry and dual positions\" (shuangxiang jinru, jiaocha renzhi), which meant that leaders in the Party committee of the group hold all the important business positions in the group. The Party secretary of the GDPG assumed the position of Chair of the board of directors. The deputy Party leader of the group, who had been the deputy director of the provincial publishing administration department before joining GDPG, became the managing director. The rest of the board of directors were made up of the deputy managing directors, all of whom were also leaders of the Party committee of GDPG. The Party discipline and inspection secretary (jiwei shuji) of the group, who mainly deals with corruption issues, became the Chair of the supervisory board. The division between the different boards however was an illusion as all their members were incorporated into a hierarchical Party system. Clearly, although GDPG tried to imitate modern corporate governance, the resulting structure was just a new bottle for the old wine.

Before it acquired the Guangdong Xinhua Book Distribution Group, GDPG complained that the \"distribution channel (of its subsidiary publishing houses) was not smooth\". 20 Now that it was controlled by GDPG, it was under pressure to display and distribute more books for its sister companies whether or not they were profitable. Similarly, publishers within GDPG were obliged to buy a certain amount of printing paper or printing services from their sister companies regardless of cost considerations. The Guangdong Publishing and Printing Materials Company for example, supplied printing paper to several publishers within the group for textbook printing at rates much higher than the market price. Its two major customers were the Guangdong Education Publishing House and the Textbook Reprinting Center, which were the two most profitable member firms of GDPG. The Textbook Reprinting Center paid an even higher price than the Guangdong Education Publishing House for the paper of same quality. 21 The Guangdong Xinhua Printing Company survived in a similar way. Its main business was to print textbooks for publishing houses within the group, but it charged a rate higher than the market price.

Hidden or unsaid motives are not taken into account since on the basis of the evidence before us there is no way of discerning what they might be. While activities may be multifaceted, they will be classified by their main function. By \"main function,\" I mean that without it an activity is unlikely to have happened. When it is difficult to discern the main function of an activity from the information provided, the intended direct beneficiaries of an activity will be taken into account. Multiple labels will apply occasionally when it is still difficult to identify the \"main function\" by following the above guideline, as in the case of meetings covering a wide range of topics. Multiple labels however should be regarded as a way of minimizing possible bias in the process of classification rather than as a way of achieving absolute precision, which is not intended and also unattainable. b. Initiators of activities will be classified into \"central party-state,\" \"provincial Party/government,\" and \"GDPG.\" The Party and the government are not differentiated, as they are usually entwined and the relationship between them is not our focus. Only the main initiator will be labeled. It is therefore essential to locate the boundary between the central party-state and the provincial Party/government. If an activity was a direct follow-up to an instruction of the central partystate, the initiator will be labeled as central party-state. Similarly, if an activity was implemented nationwide at the same time, even if the article claimed the provincial Party/government to be the source of the instruction, the main initiator will be labeled as the \"central party-state.\" Otherwise, it will be labeled as the \"provincial Party/ government.\" In this case, extra background information of an activity might be necessary in order to make an accurate judgement, and this information can be easily acquired on line. If there is no direct instruction from the party-state, the initiator will be labeled as \"GDPG.\" Following these guidelines, the initiator of most \"optional activities\" of GDPG which aimed at meeting the target of the party-state will be labeled as \"GDPG.\" c. In order to examine whether the activities of GDPG mainly served the Party or business interest, \"Party\" and \"business\" constitute the two main labels in identifying the function of activities. Party activities, such as the so-called Party construction (dangjian) activities, and propaganda will be labeled as \"Party.\" Activities related to economic issues, such as the business operation of GDPG or the implementation of new policies of commercialization, will be labeled as \"business.\" However, two other labels, \"publicity\" and \"social intervention,\" are also adopted in the classification. Increasingly, the party-state has paid attention to publicity as well as propaganda. For the central partystate, the policy of \"going out\" is seen as a way of enhancing its \"soft power\" and improving its image. For the Guangdong provincial government, the target of building a \"preeminent cultural province\" places a premium on promoting a positive image of the province. The function of this kind of activity will be labeled as \"publicity.\" d. In addition, GDPG was often instructed by the party-state to help address different kinds of social issues. The plight of peasants in rural areas has been a long-standing concern for example. In an effort to address it publishers have been instructed by the party-state to produce books for peasants or migrant workers, normally accessible books on agricultural skills, or have been encouraged to donate books to poor villages, in order to help with poverty relief efforts. GDPG also published books for other contemporary campaigns, such as anti-SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and antidrug campaigns. These activities will be labeled as \"social intervention\" according to their intended direct beneficiaries. In the occasional cases where the function of an activity is not discernible, it will be labeled as \"miscellaneous.\" Following the above principles, 96 activities were classified during the operation of GDPG in 2005 (see Appendix 1), of which 50% (48 activities) were solely or partially initiated by the party-state. In addition, the initiators of four further \"optional activities,\" such as the donation of books to poor villages and the promotion of national or provincial image, were labeled as \"GDPG\" according to the classification guidelines, although they intended to meet the target of the party-state and were unlikely to have happened without its intervention (see activity 24, 26, 69, and 71). Some business activities initiated by GDPG, such as corporate meetings on content production or meetings of senior editors, were also attended by officials from the provincial publishing administration department (see activity 5, 10, 34, and 88).",

Not all books for propaganda, publicity, or social intervention are money-losing projects.

It was commissioned by the provincial Party in February 2005 to produce a video CD, 120,000 copies of which were purchased by the provincial Party as training materials for Party organizations within the province. Even if the party-state does not provide a direct subsidy, it might resort to its administrative power to boost sales. A book on moral education was commissioned by the provincial Party from the Guangdong People's Publishing House. With the support of the provincial Party and government, sales reached 320,000 within the first year of its publication. 27 However, most books of this kind are likely to be money-losing projects because the party-state usually just set a general propaganda target and let the publishing houses decide how they would meet it. As a result, many books were actually pitched at the Party rather than the market. Market research was completely irrelevant for these kinds of publishing projects, many of which were produced within a very short period of time in order to keep up with political events. An example was a book published by the Guangdong People's Publishing House shortly after the Indian Ocean tsunami in 2004. As medical volunteers were sent by the central government to disaster-stricken areas, the deputy director of the Guangdong People's Publishing House thought that there might be an opportunity for a publishing project of \"dual benefits\" (shuangxiao), which meant the book might pitch at the party-state and also for the market. Without any market research, a book about the experiences of several medical volunteers and journalists was commissioned and published in only 20 days. It was not a success.",

Before the establishment of publishing groups, the provincial publishing administration department assumed both administrative and business responsibilities over its affiliated publishing houses. As the publishing administration bureaus had economic interest in the prosperity of their affiliates, they tended not to impose too strict a punishment if there was any ideological deviation in publications (Chinese Academy of Press and Publication, 1998: 49). One provincial publishing administration bureau for example, only fined an affiliate a small amount of money for publishing a politically unacceptable book, and even paid the fine themselves (ibid). In contrast, GDPG, having acquired independence from the provincial publishing administration bureau, might face tougher ideological control from the publishing administration department. Since the latter no longer has a direct economic interest in GDPG it may have strong incentive to display its administrative power in any power struggle. As the provincial government administration department had already been exercising censorship in the approval of publishing plans and regular \"scrutiny reading\" (shengdu) of books, the introduction of similar censorship measures by GDPG imposed an extra layer of censorship on publishing houses. As a result, some publishers complained that the establishment of publishing groups created an extra \"mother-in-law\" (popo) to control them. In addition, in pursuit of the group's economic interests, GDPG instructed its member firms to minimize \"internal competitions\" (wolidou) between them, 33 a move which also helped to reduce the possible impact of market competition on ideological control.",

Other affiliated publishing houses enjoyed a larger extent of operational autonomy.

Given that these titles are the economic lifeline of its subsidiary publishing houses, it puts them in a vulnerable position.

As a result, another important aspect of its business role is to bargain with the provincial Party and government to maintain the monopolistic profits from textbook publishing and distribution which are crucial for its survival. GDPG relies heavily on the administrative power of the provincial government for its monopoly in the provincial school book market. When its market share of textbooks in Guangdong Province was facing intense competition in 2004, it immediately sought to \"win the support of (provincial) government\" for protection. 37 In order to relieve the financial burdens on students, the Guangdong provincial government started to provide free textbooks to school children in rural areas from 2007. This annual government procurement amounted to RMB1.2888 billion yuan (about US$202.32 million) (Wei, 2007) . GDPG not only won the contract to provide 80% of these textbooks, it was also entrusted by the provincial government with the responsibility for the government procurement of textbooks provided by nonlocal publishers. Publishers from other provinces were forced to sell their textbooks to GDPG at low prices or have their textbooks printed in Guangdong. Although the monopoly enjoyed by GDPG in its local market was criticized by many legal experts as illegal and harmful to the \"public interest\" (Yao, 2009 ), it was not weakened at all in the textbook procurements of 2008 and 2009 (Wang, 2009) .",

SPM influenced the provincial government at the end of 2015 in the price setting of local textbooks, and assisted the government in deciding the provincial catalogue of approved textbooks, which could help the group to exclude the products of its competitors from the local market. When the provincial government raised its procurement budget for school textbooks in 2014, SPM even drafted a document for the government on the budget fluctuation mechanism based on the variation of production costs of textbooks. In addition, as discussed in Chapter 2, Mapping Book Publishing in China, the government started to adopt a series of new policies from 2011 on the publishing of supplementary learning materials, requiring these books to be approved by provincial governments before they can be listed in a catalogue for local schools to choose. These policies effectively turned the profitable business of supplementary learning materials into another area monopolized by the stateowned publishers, giving them a new source of profit. The Guangdong Economy Publishing House, the only publisher without a business in textbooks within SPM, greatly improved its profit by entering the business of supplementary learning materials. This partly explains why the annual revenue and the net profit of SPM have been growing while the whole book market stagnates (see Table 8 .2). According to its annual report, SPM made a profit of RMB503 million yuan (US$78.96 million) on its revenue of RMB4920 million yuan in 2016.",

In addition to providing preferential tax breaks to publishing groups since 2009, the government seems to have increased its grants to SPM over the last few years (see Table 8 .2). Consequently, market-oriented books play a much less important role in the business of SPM. SPM set a guideline for its editors to develop new book titles, which is to \"pitch for (government) book awards, pitch for (government) grants, and pitch to the market\" (chongjiang, chongjin, chongshi) (ibid: 28). As one of the SPM editors commented, many editors in the publishing industry tend to focus on Party/government commissioned books or propaganda books. No wonder that to \"pitch to the market\" is the last and probably least option in SPM's guideline. In the 2015 annual publishing plan of SPM, according to its own assessment, the number of market-oriented book titles only accounted for 54%, not to mention that many of them are likely to be unmarketable.

            "text": "With the rise of digital technologies in China, digital publishing business has been widely discussed in the publishing industry. As a response to the challenges and opportunities of digital publishing, GDPG launched the GDPG Digital Publishing Company in January 2009. However, the effort made by GDPG in its digital transformation is not from a purely commercial consideration, and its digital publishing business largely replicated its old business model. The intervention of the party-state in the digital transformation of publishers is evident. In the case of GDPG, the government played an instrumental role in the establishment of GDPG Digital Publishing Company. As discussed before, many Chinese publishers rely on their monopolistic profit from textbooks and supplementary learning materials to survive, digital technologies have had little tangible impact on them. Although digital transformation is probably more of a buzzword than a real business consideration for many publishers, the Chinese government took strong policy initiatives to encourage the digital transformation in publishing industry. In the National 11th Five Year Plan for the Development of Culture (guojia shiyiwu shiqi wenhua fazhan guihua gangyao) promulgated in 2006, the central government called for the digital transformation of cultural industries, including the publishing industry. In order to facilitate this transformation, the government would provide funds for some digital publishing projects and would also launch a few digital publishing industrial parks across the country. Following this policy, GAPP, the government publishing administration department, established a dedicated branch in 2008 to be in charge of the digital publishing businesses. In response to the government initiatives, the China Publishing Group established the China Publishing Group Digital Media Company in 2008 under the \"guidance of the Central Party Propaganda Department and GAPP\" (China Publishing Group, c2009). GDPG followed suit by launching its New Media Publishing Center in the same year (Ma, 2010) . The Guangdong provincial government also announced a few preferential policies in 2008, including government special funds for digital publishing projects, to support the \"Digital Guangdong\" initiative (Jiang, 2008) . It is against the backdrop of these favorable local policies that GDPG turned its New Media Publishing Center into the independent GDPG Digital Publishing Company in 2009. However, initiatives from the government are not the same thing as a clear and viable business model for publishers. One of the important sources of revenue for the digital publishing projects of GDPG (or SPM) is actually the subsidies from the government. According to the SPM annual corporate report (SPM, 2017: 150), of its ten projects subsidized by the government in 2016, five are about digital publishing or digital transformation, with one being on reorganizing the publishing workflow, one on an online virtual scientific experiments product, one on an educational resources platform, and two on the so-called MPR (Multimedia Print Reader) technology, which is a Chinese multimedia publishing standard similar to but less versatile than the augment reality (AR) technology. SPM received a total of RMB16.7 million yuan from the government (about US$2.62 million) for these projects in 2016. The subsidies from the government are substantial and frequent. One of the special funds from the provincial government granted RMB35 million yuan to seven digital publishing projects in 2009 and RMB40 million yuan to 14 projects in 2010 (GDPG, 2011). A significant proportion of them, if not all, would have gone to SPM. This does not mean GDPG Digital Publishing Company was the only recipient of these subsidies within the group. But it received a total amount of RMB5 million yuan (about US$785,000) in 2016 for the two MPR projects, and since its establishment, it has been granted 13 digital publishing projects subsidized by either the central or the provincial government (GDPG Digital Publishing Company, ca. 2016). The total amount of subsidies it has received must be significant. Recently, it was awarded a joint project subsidized by SAPPRFT in 2017 to establish a technology lab to explore the application of AR in education publishing. Running out of options or genuinely believing in the magic of technology, many subsidized digital publishing projects from Chinese publishers tend to focus on a fashionable digital technology rather than the content. However, focusing too much on technologies may put publishers in a direct competition with high-tech giants with ample resources, which they could never hope to win.",

            "text": "In addition to direct subsidies, digital publishing projects could help publishers to get another important resource from the government-the land. In the case of SPM, one such project is the establishment of the Dongpu Digital Publishing Industrial Park in Guangzhou. In China, all land is officially owned by the state and land sales are usually a crucial financial source for local governments. But the governments sometimes allocate (huabo) a piece of land for free to public welfare organizations, including cultural and educational establishments. In line with the polices of the central government, the Guangdong provincial government issued a plan, the Guangdong Provincial Plan on the Development of a Preeminent Cultural Province 2011\u00c02020 (guangdong sheng jianshe wenhua qiangsheng guihua gangyao 2011\u00c02020), in 2010 to develop its provincial cultural industries. In this plan, the provincial government decided to launch the Guangdong Digital Publishing Industrial Park (guangdong shuzi chuban jidi) and would offer preferential policy on allocating a piece of land for the park. The total gross floor area of this digital publishing park in Dongpu is said to be about 186,000 square meters when it is finished, and most importantly, this park is owned by the SPM. The digital publishing business of SPM certainly would not need that amount of office area, and it is not surprising that this piece of land was later changed from public sector land use to commercial use in 2017, although at a preferential price paid by the SPM. Considering China's heated property market, this piece of land will greatly improve the assets and economic resource of SPM. In addition to this industrial park, two more real estate projects by SPM are also under development. It seems that by taking advantage of the preferential policies offered by the government to the development of cultural industries, the so-called \"cultural real estate\" (wenhua dichan) is becoming another important business of SPM.",

Its earliest project in digital publishing is the iximo.com platform, a \"digital reading\" (shuzi yuedu) platform supposed to target the trade market. iximo. com was launched in 2010 as an e-book vendor (it also became a selfpublishing platform at a later stage), mainly to sell e-books from SPM. Clearly, this is hardly a viable business model as this platform would have to compete with well-established online booksellers such as Dangdang and Amazon. In addition, as iximo.com is a very small vendor, publishers are also unwilling to license their e-books to it. Most of the e-books on this platform are licensed by the member firms of SPM, not willingly though. As a senior manager from a publishing house within SPM commented, SPM as a whole group produces only a limited amount of noneducational titles (3644 titles in 2016 according to its annual report and of them, over 300 are the so-called \"theme publishing\" propaganda titles). Even if all the books from SPM are licensed to iximo.com, it still cannot become a platform big enough to be attractive to readers. The sales revenue for publishers through this platform would be very limited, not to mention that GDPG Digital Publishing Company takes commissions from the sales.",

Many publishing groups seem to be doing the same direct-to-consumers sales on their own platforms, such as the ibookuu.com launched by Zhejiang Publishing United Group Digital Media Company, and the ishuke.com.cn by the Shandong Publishing and Media Company.

            "text": "For GDPG Digital Publishing Company, the other option is to develop digital products for school students and teachers. After all, education publishing is the main source of profit for China's publishing industry. However, digital products for the education market usually require much more investment than e-books, and selling digital products to schools is not the same as selling textbooks to the provincial government. In addition, there are different versions of textbooks in the local market. Although textbooks published by the subsidiary publishing houses of SPM usually take a certain percentage of the market, those from the People's Education Press (PEP) are the leading ones. To minimize the risk and the investment, GDPG Digital Publishing Company became a sales agency for the digital products from PEP and its sister companies within SPM. The digital products from PEP include a teaching resources product for teachers, an e-learning product for students called PEP e-Learning, a multimedia textbook product, and an English learning mobile app. All these products are designed to supplement the use of textbooks from PEP. Digital Products from its sister companies, including e-textbooks and the Southern Virtual Experiments (nanfang xuni shiyan shi), an online virtual science experiments product, are also intended to supplement the learning of textbooks from these publishers. Of all these products, the PEP e-Learning and the Southern Virtual Experiments are the two most widely used ones (Gao, 2016) . However, according to the annual report of SPM, the total sales revenue of PEP e-Learning in Guangdong province, which was hailed by SPM as the top regional sales across the country, only amounted to RMB4.99 million yuan in 2015. The commission of GDPG Digital Publishing Company from these sales would be just a small proportion of it. The other widely used product, the Southern Virtual Experiments, is actually provided as a free additional product to schools who have adopted the science textbooks from SPM. Consequently, with limited income of commissions from these products, GDPG Digital Publishing Company had to try to invest in its own digital products. An important one is an e-learning platform called Smart Learning (zhi xuexi), which claims to provide personalized learning experiences for students based on the technology of machine learning and big data. But most of the products from GDPG Digital Publishing Company are meant to supplement the learning of particular textbooks. As the textbook market in China is segregated, the market for digital supplementary learning products centered on textbooks is also segregated, which has significantly reduced the economy of scale for any digital products from GDPG Digital Publishing Company.",
