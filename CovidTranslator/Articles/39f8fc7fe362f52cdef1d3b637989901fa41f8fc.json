To address this need, we are developing a subunit recombinant protein vaccine comprising residues 377-588 of the MERS-CoV spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD), which, when formulated with the AddaVax adjuvant, it induces a significant neutralizing antibody response and protection against MERS-CoV challenge in vaccinated animals. To prepare for the manufacture and first-in-human testing of the vaccine, we have developed a process to stably produce the recombinant MERS S377-588 protein in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. To accomplish this, we transfected an adherent dihydrofolate reductase-deficient CHO cell line (adCHO) with a plasmid encoding S377-588 fused with the human IgG Fc fragment (S377-588-Fc). We then demonstrated the interleukin-2 signal peptide-directed secretion of the recombinant protein into extracellular milieu. Using a gradually increasing methotrexate (MTX) concentration to 5 lM, we increased protein yield by a factor of 40.",

There remains a critical need for a vaccine targeting MERS-CoV [2] , and the newly established Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovation (CEPI) has now designated research and development for the MERS-CoV vaccine as a global priority [3] . Recently, Phase I studies of DNA-based vaccines against MERS-CoV showed that 98% of vaccinated volunteers generated antibody against MERS CoV [4] . However, to date there is no licensed DNA vaccine for humans due in part to questions about their long-term safety, and their ability to induce high titers of protective or neutralizing antibodies relative to recombinant protein-based vaccines [5, 6] .",

Moreover, focusing on the RBD component, rather than the full-length S protein, reduces the likelihood of eosinophilic-or antibody-dependent immune enhancement [10, 11] . Expressed and purified as a recombinant fusion protein with the human Fc fragment, the AddaVax(MF59-like)-adjuvanted RBD (residues 377-588) of MERS-CoV has been shown to elicit high neutralizing antibody titers in both mice and rabbits [9, [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] . These antibodies displayed potent neutralizing activity against almost 20 human and camel MERS-CoV strains, including those with amino acid mutations in the RBD region of their spike proteins [15, 17, 18] . In a complementary approach, recombinant RBD mutants representing different human and camel virus isolates were all able to elicit broad-spectrum neutralizing antibodies against a wide range of human and camel MERS-CoV strains [15] . Antibodies against the RBD were able to block the binding of the RBD to the MERS-CoV's cellular receptor, DPP4 [17] , and thus block the viral entry into permissive human cells [18] . Most importantly, recent studies found that these neutralizing antibodies were indeed associated with protection, when vaccinated Ad5-hDPP4-transduced mice and hDPP4-transgenic mice were found to be immune against lethal MERS-CoV challenge [14, 19, 20] . Although the vaccine antigen has been produced at small, laboratory scale in a transient HEK293 cell system [17] , little effort has been put forth to develop and scale up of MERS-CoV RBD suitable for future vaccine manufacture. Therefore, we have now engineered a stable CHO cell line suitable for producing this MERS-CoV protein vaccine antigen.",

Sequences encoding signal peptides derived from IgK light chain (IgK), human serum albumin (SA), and Azurocidin (Azu) were incorporated into the MERS S377-588-Fc by touchdown PCR with ultramer oligomers (Table 1, Supp. Table 1 ). The PCR products were gel purified using a QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen) and subsequently cloned into the pOptiVEC-TOPO vector (Invitrogen), followed by Escherichia coli TOP10 transformation. Ampicillin-resistant transformants were selected on LB agar plates containing 100 lg/mL of ampicillin and subsequently grown in LB broth. Plasmid DNA prepared from isolated colonies were sequenced. To construct the expression plasmid with the IL2 signal peptide, pJet2.1_IL2_S377-588-Fc was digested with XbaI and NotI restriction enzymes, and the gene cassette was gel purified. The expression plasmid pOptiVEC was digested with the same enzymes and gel purified, followed by ligation with T4 DNA ligase.",

For a ''proof-of-principal\" study to confirm that adCHOexpressed MERS S377-588-Fc is an effective and safe vaccine, two groups of five age-matched CD26/DPP4 transgenic (Tg) mice were immunized twice, four weeks apart, via the intramuscular (i.m.) route, with either 10 lg of MERS S377-588-Fc formulated with AddaVax (Invivogen) or PBS/AddaVax only (as control). This immunization protocol was selected because it is optimized for MERS-CoV RBD proteins [16] . The AddaVax adjuvant was chosen because it promoted the RBD-Fc protein to generate the highest neutralizing antibodies among several adjuvants tested in our previous studies [14] . Serum specimens were collected at day 28 after the second immunization through the retro-orbital bleeding route to determine the prospective capacity to neutralize infectious MERS-CoV by using the standard Vero E6-based micro-neutralization test. Immunized mice were subsequently challenged intranasally (i.n.) with 100x 50% lethal dose (LD 50 ) ($10 3 TCID 50 ) of MERS-CoV (EMC/2012 strain), a gift of Heinz Feldmann (NIH, Hamilton, MT) and Ron A. Fouchier (Erasmus Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands), followed by daily monitoring for the onset of clinical manifestations (e.g., weight loss and other clinical manifestations) and mortality. Three mice from each group were euthanized at day 3 post-infection (p.i.) to assess lung viral loads by Vero E6-based infection assay and quantitative (q) PCR analysis targeting the upE gene of MERS-CoV for quantifying infectious virus and viral RNA, respectively. Additionally, de-paraffinized lung tissues were hematoxylin-and-eosin (H&E)-stained for routine histopathologic evaluations, as described. We continued to monitor the remaining two mice in each group for their overall well-being for a total of 3 weeks until terminating the experiment. All methodologies required to assess the immunogenicity (neutralization antibody titers) and efficacy of MERS S377-588-Fc have been previously reported ( [19, 26] , Supplementary Methods).",

However, to establish stably expressing cell clones, we transfected an adherent CHO (adCHO) with a pOptiVec construct containing an Internal Ribosome Entry Site (IRES)-driven dhfr gene for selection and copy number amplification, as well as MERS S377-588-Fc gene fusion. Signal peptides were added to the N-terminal end of the S377-588-Fc gene in order to drive secretion into the culture medium (Fig. 1a) . Addition of gradually increasing methotrexate (MTX) to the culture medium of transfected cells resulted in binding to and inactivation of dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) activity. Transfected adCHO cells compensated for this reduced DHFR activity by increasing the DHFR copy number in the genome to overcome inhibition by MTX. Since the MERS S377-588-Fc fusion gene was integrated into the same genetic locus as that of the DHFR gene, the S377-588-Fc gene was amplified, as well, leading to increased production of the protein.",

On the purification chromatogram, two protein peaks were observed in the elution step (Fig. 1b) . Denaturing SDS-PAGE and Western blotting analysis with anti-MERS-RBD-specific antibodies confirmed the second peak to be the S377-588-Fc fragment (Fig. 1c) . Further analysis using non-denaturing SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with Rb-anti-Bovine (Fab)2 antibodies showed that the first peak was mainly contaminating bovine IgG (Fig. 1d-e) that originated from the fetal bovine serum (FBS) supplemented in the culture medium. We estimated relative productivity of adCHO cells by measuring the ratio of the area of first peak and second peak. Different signal peptides have been shown to result in different expression levels in CHO cell systems [27] . Therefore, we transfected adCHO cells with linearized MERS S377-588-Fc expression plasmids with four different signal peptides at the N-terminus. Peptides were derived from interleukin 2 (IL2), IgK light chain (IgK), human serum albumin (SA), and azurocidin (Azu). Conditioned media from confluent monolayers of each transfected cell line were collected, followed by protein purification using Protein A to establish yield and estimate relative productivity. In these studies, we found that adCHO cells with the signal peptide derived from IL2 showed 20-50% more secretion of S377-588-Fc than cells with other signal peptides (Fig. 2a) .",

Co-IP demonstrated that similar to the HEK293T-expressed MERS S377-588-Fc protein, the RBD protein expressed in adCHO bound strongly to hDPP4expressing Huh-7 cells. Two clear bands were identified from immunoprecipitated mixture of S377-588-Fc and Huh-7 cell lysates, and these bands were recognized by both anti-hDPP4 antibody and anti-MERS-RBD antibody. In contrast, only one band was identified in Huh-7 cells only and S377-588-Fc protein only samples, and it was reactive with either anti-hDPP4 antibody or anti-MERS-RBD antibody, but not with both antibodies. As expected, SARS-CoV RBD-Fc protein was only recognized by SARS-CoV RBD-specific mAb 33G4 (Fig. 4a) . Flow cytometry analysis further quantified the binding between MERS-CoV RBD protein and hDPP4 receptor in Huh-7 cells. Results showed a similar strong binding for all MERS S377-588-Fc proteins from adCHO and HEK293T, but not for SARS-CoV RBD-Fc control (Fig. 4b) . The ELISA analysis demonstrated a dose-dependent binding between these MERS-CoV RBD proteins and hDPP4 protein, while no binding was observed between hFc control and hDPP4 (Fig. 4c) . The antigenicity of MERS-CoV RBD proteins was carried out using ELISA to test their binding with RBD-specific neutralizing antibodies (Mersmab1, m336, m337, and m338), which recognize epitopes at RBD residues F506, D510, R511, W535, D539, Y540, R542, or W553, and demonstrate strong activity to block RBD-hDPP4 receptor binding and neutralize MERS-CoV infection [23] [24] [25] 28] . Similar to the S377-588-Fc protein expressed in HEK293T, the RBD proteins expressed in adCHO bound strongly to mouse mAb Mersmab1 and human mAbs m336, m337, and m338 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4d) , confirming their antigenicity. While these mAbs bound strongly to the non-denatured (no DTT) S377-588-Fc proteins expressed in both adCHO and HEK293T, they had significantly reduced affinity to RBD proteins treated with DTT, a reducing agent cleaving disulfide bonds of RBDs and thus disrupting a protein's native conformation (Fig. 4e) . These results demonstrate that the neutralizing mAbs recognize conformational structures of MERS-CoV RBD [25] .",

The immunogenicity of the MERS S377-588-Fc-based subunit vaccine was verified in hDPP4-Tg mice. Immune sera obtained from immunized mice were tested by ELISA for the binding with denatured and non-denatured S377-588-Fc protein or subjected to the Vero E6-based micro-neutralization assay to quantify their capacity to neutralize infectious MERS-CoV. To evaluate protective efficacy against viral infection, viral loads and histopathology of the lungs of three mice in immunized and control groups were measured at day 3 after lethal challenge with 100x LD 50 of MERS-CoV. The remaining two mice in each group were monitored for morbidity (weight loss) and mortality to determine if this vaccine formulation would sufficiently protect against the disease and lethality caused by MERS-CoV infection. MERS S377-588-Fc induced high titers of RBD-specific IgG antibodies, which reacted strongly with non-denatured S377-588-Fc protein. Nevertheless, these RBD-specific antibodies had significantly reduced activity with S377-588-Fc treated by DTT (Fig. 5) . This suggests that the RBD vaccine-induced antibody response was indeed directed towards one or more conformational epitopes. Mice immunized with PBS/AddaVax uniformly failed to elicit any detectable neutralizing antibodies; however, those immunized with MERS S377-588-Fc/AddaVax consistently produced readily detectable titers of neutralizing antibody, ranging from 10-160 and 20-320 of neutralizing titer (NT)-100 (NT 100 ) and NT-50 (NT 50 ), respectively ( Table 2) . Consistent with the readily detectable neutralization antibodies, MERS S377-588-Fc/AddaVaximmunized mice were fully protected against viral infection and disease, as evidenced by the absence of recoverable infectious virus and negligible focal inflammatory responses, if any (Supp. Fig. 3) , within the infected lungs at 3 days post-infection (dpi). Importantly, the remaining two immunized mice did not suffer any significant morbidity (weight loss) and survived until 21 dpi when the experiment was terminated. In contrast, pulmonary infectious viruses, albeit low in titers, were detected from all three unimmunized controls, with an average of 2.7 \u00b1 0.1 TCID 50 /g of MERS-CoV recovered at 3 dpi, accompanied by mild inflammatory responses. The remaining two control mice suffered profound weight loss prior to succumbing to infection by 8 dpi. Taken together, results of this ''proof-of-principle\" pilot study indicated not only immunogenicity of MERS-CoV S377-588-Fc, but also its efficacy and safety in the protection of hDPP4-Tg mice against lethal challenge with MERS-CoV.

ELISA analysis was performed on the supernatants from individual clones, leading to the identification of clone 1B11 as the highest expressing clone.

Our aim here was to optimize expression and purification conditions suitable for pilot scale production of this RBD vaccine candidate. Initially, both Escherichia coli (bacteria) and Pichia pastoris (yeast) expression systems proved well suited for recombinant vaccine production because of low production costs. However, our data showed that E. coli could not produce soluble MERS S377-588, and yeast cells could not overexpress MERS S377-588. Thus, these two systems were not considered suitable to advance the MERS vaccine candidate into process development and scale up production (see supplementary information for more detail). In previous reports, MERS Fc-fused S377-588 had been expressed in transiently transfected HEK293T cells. However, transiently transfected cell lines may give low protein yield and potentially lose their production ability over time in continuously expressing recombinant proteins [29, 30] . Unlike transient transfection, DNA is integrated into cells long-term through stable transfection. Despite the fact that the development of stably expressing cell lines is laborious and time-consuming, production with stable cell lines can be scaled up easily and would be suitable for use in manufacturing processes. Hence, we generated a stably transfected adCHO cell line by transfecting MTXdriven pOptiVEC into cells to produce recombinant MERS S377-588-Fc protein.",

A number of studies have been initiated on the development of vaccines against Ebola, HIV, influenza, as well as tuberculosis [32] [33] [34] [35] . It is noted that adverse side effects with vaccines are likely limited as biotherapeutic Fc fusions have been repeatedly shown to be safe and biocompatible in humans. Currently, all commercial therapeutics use the Fc domain from human IgG1, although other options, such as IgG3, IgA, and IgM are also currently being explored [36] . Furthermore, the Fc domain is known to increase plasma half-life and simplify the purification process [36] . Purification of S377-588-Fc was performed using a Protein A Sepharose column, removing most of the impurities from the culture medium. Bovine IgG originates from FBS in the culture medium in constant amount and was used as a standard to gauge expression levels of the S377-588-Fc protein. This estimation method allowed us to select the most suitable signal peptide and to evaluate the effect of the MTX-induced DNA amplification process.",
