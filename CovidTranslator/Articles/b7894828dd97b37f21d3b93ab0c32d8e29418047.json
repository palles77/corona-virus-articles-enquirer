We previously reported the successful in vitro inhibition of FIPV replication by synthetic siRNA mediated RNA interference (RNAi) in an immortalised cell line (McDonagh et al., 2011) . A major challenge facing the development of any antiviral strategy is that of resistance, a problem which is particularly acute for RNAi based therapeutics due to the exquisite sequence specificity of the targeting mechanism. The development of resistance during treatment can be minimised using combination therapy to raise the genetic barrier or using highly potent compounds which result in a more rapid and pronounced reduction in the viral replication rate, thereby reducing the formation of mutant, and potentially resistant viruses. This study investigated the efficacy of combination siRNA therapy and its ability to delay or prevent viral escape. Virus serially passaged through cells treated with a single or dual siRNAs rapidly acquired resistance, with mutations identified in the siRNA target sites. Combination therapy with three siRNA prevented viral escape over the course of five passages. To identify more potent silencing molecules we also compared the efficacy, in terms of potency and duration of action, of canonical versus Dicer-substrate siRNAs for two previously identified effective viral motifs. Dicer-substrate siRNAs showed equivalent or better potency than canonical siRNAs for the target sites investigated, and may be a more appropriate molecule for in vivo use. Combined, these data inform the potential therapeutic application of antiviral RNAi against FIPV.",

We have previously demonstrated effective in vitro inhibition of FIPV using synthetic siRNAs targeted against sequences encoding structural and nonstructural proteins and the 5 0 UTR (McDonagh et al., 2011) . One of the major challenges facing the development of antiviral therapeutics is resistance, which may develop during treatment, or be pre-existing in a virus population. Whilst this is a concern with any antiviral compound, it is particularly problematic for RNAi based approaches due to the exquisite sequence specificity of the targeting mechanism. A single nucleotide mismatch within the target site can dramatically reduce the efficacy of RNAi-based viral inhibition by impairing base pairing between the guide strand and its target (Gitlin et al., 2005) . This is especially relevant for feline coronaviruses, which are known to exist as a quasispecies (Kiss et al., 1999) . This report extends our previous work on siRNA mediated inhibition of FIPV to investigate and address the challenges of antiviral resistance. Experiments were conducted to determine the efficacy of combination siRNA therapy against FIPV and its ability to delay or prevent the emergence of resistance in vitro. For two highly effective siRNAs, the efficacy of Dicer-substrate siRNAs (DsiRNAs), a structural siRNA variant that has been reported in some studies to be more efficacious than sequence matched canonical siRNA , was investigated in terms of potency and duration of action compared to canonical siRNAs targeting the same motif.",

The second mutation was a G-to-C transition at position seventeen. This mutation was seen only in virus passaged through cells treated with siRNA combination L2+N1+M1. All of the nucleotide substitutions within the N1 target site were associated with amino acid changes. Although position nine of the target site corresponds to the wobble position of the codon for phenylalanine in the original sequence, both identified polymorphisms at this location resulted in an amino acid change to leucine. Position seventeen corresponds to the middle base of the codon for alanine in the original sequence, and the G-to-C transition results in an amino acid substitution to valine. Based on the inhibition of viral antigen expression, the identified mutations resulted in the acquisition of a fully or partially resistant phenotype (Fig. 3) . When treated with a single siRNA the acquisition of a mutation at the target site was associated with an almost complete loss of inhibition. For siRNA N1, although the C-to-A transition was not noted until P2, a highly resistant phenotype was apparent from P1. Analysis of the P1 electropherogram at this site shows a small adenine peak in addition to cytosine suggesting a subpopulation of the P1 viruses had undergone this mutation during the first passage. Given the 40 h infection period used in this study encompasses multiple replication cycles, the presence of even a low-prevalence resistant sub-population would likely result in the appearance of a highly resistant phenotype in this study. The development of resistance to siRNA mediated inhibition was demonstrated to be sequence dependent rather than mechanism dependent as viruses with mutations in the L2 target site remained susceptible to RNAi mediated inhibition by siRNA N1 and vice versa (data not shown).",

Whilst theoretically each additional antiviral added to a treatment regimen will further reduce the likelihood of resistance occurring during treatment, this must be balanced against the potential for increased toxicity or antagonistic effects. For RNAi-based therapeutics, each additional siRNA will compete for access to the RISC machinery, and thus combination therapy with multiple siRNAs may result in highly potent siRNAs being diluted by the presence of less potent molecules (Bitko et al., 2005; Castanotto et al., 2007) . Similarly, competition for incorporation into RISC between siRNAs and endogenous microRNAs may increase the risk of off-target effects. The current study supports the notion that for FIPV, combination therapy with siRNAs targeting at least three independent regions is required.",

            "text": "An interesting extension of the combinatorial therapy approach to minimising the emergence of resistance during treatment is to use a combination containing a highly effective siRNA in addition to a number of siRNAs designed to recognise and inhibit the most likely escape sequences for that targeted region, a so-called second generation of siRNAs. In the current study, despite targeting conserved regions, selection pressure due to siRNA treatment resulted in the generation of two unique mutations for L2 and three unique mutations for N1. Further large scale screening for escape sequences would be required to determine whether the mutations identified in the current small scale study represent the most likely route of viral escape, and also whether such an approach is practical for these targets based on the overall number of escape sequences possible. Recent studies using this approach with HIV have shown that although viral escape via mutations targeted by the second generation of siRNAs are inhibited, selection pressure results in the development of resistance via alternate routes (Schopman et al., 2010) . The structure of the double-stranded RNA molecule responsible for mediating RNAi is a 21 nucleotide duplex with two nucleotide overhangs at the 3 0 end of each strand, often referred to as the ''19 + 2'' structure (Elbashir et al., 2001) . Chemically synthesised siRNAs are traditionally designed to mimic this structure, with a central 19 nucleotide duplex complementary to the target sequence, and with the overhangs commonly deoxythymidines. In the search for improved efficacy and reduced off-target effects, a range of non-classical siRNA structural variants have been investigated, some of which appear to offer advantages over the canonical ''19 + 2'' structure (Chang et al., 2007; Kim et al., 2005; Rose et al., 2005; Salomon et al., 2010) . One of these, a 27 nt duplex referred to as a Dicer-substrate siRNA, was shown by Kim et al. (2005) to be 10-100 times more potent than its sequence matched canonical siRNA, without inducing interferon or protein kinase R responses and having an enhanced duration of action. Further refinement of the originally blunt-ended 27-mer duplex resulted in the DsiRNA structure used in the current study: a 25 nucleotide sense strand in which the two 3 0 terminal nucleotides are replaced with DNA, and a 27 nt antisense strand hybridised to give a blunt ended sense 3 0 terminus and 2 nt overhang at the sense 5 0 terminus (Amarzguioui et al., 2006) . Asymmetry and the incorporation of DNA bases into the DsiRNA structure results in the preferential incorporation of the antisense strand into RISC, improved complex formation with proteins known to be important for RNAi, as well as minimising the activation of the innate immune response (Amarzguioui et al., 2006; Snead et al., 2013) . Not all published data however supports the contention that Dicer-substrate siRNAs offer any advantage over the canonical siRNAs on which they are based. Foster et al. (2012) compared the performance of DsiRNA and siRNA against a range of targets and found no class effect, with both canonical and Dicer-substrate siRNAs comparable in terms of potency and duration of activity, both in vitro and in vivo. Dicer-substrate siRNA were also reported to be less tolerant of chemical modifications and more immunostimulatory, however in regards to antiviral therapy, the latter may actually be a desirable feature (Stewart et al., 2011) .",

For monotherapy against target L2, and combination treatment for L2 and N1, DsiRNA were more potent, while there was little difference between siRNA and DsiRNA for monotherapy targeted at N1. Increased potency was greatest for combination therapy, with the IC50 of dual combination DsiRNA almost 10-fold lower than that for dual siRNA therapy. The duration of action appeared related to the potency of the molecule, with increased potency resulting in increased duration of activity. Previous studies investigating the duration of activity of canonical versus Dicer-substrate siRNAs have targeted cellular genes. In these cases the cessation of silencing is thought to be related to a reduction of intracellular siRNA due to the activity of ribonucleases or through a dilution effect caused by cell division (Takahashi et al., 2012) . In the current study the apparent cessation of antiviral effect may also be due to the emergence of resistant isolates or through a simple overwhelming of the RNAi machinery, as cells are exposed to progressively higher MOI as viral replication proceeds. Both of these hypotheses fit with the experimental data showing that prolonged duration of activity correlated with increased potency.",

The prevalence of type II FCoV varies worldwide, however in all reported studies infection with type I viruses is more common (Pedersen, 2009) . It is unlikely that the higher prevalence of type I infections would invalidate any therapeutic application of the siRNAs tested in this study, as the primary difference between type I and II FCoVs is the spike protein, a region not targeted by any of the tested siRNAs. Furthermore, siRNAs were selected based on homology to reported strains, including both type I and type II FCoVs, and subsequent alignment of siRNA targets against the most recently published sequences confirmed a high degree of conservation among both types.",
