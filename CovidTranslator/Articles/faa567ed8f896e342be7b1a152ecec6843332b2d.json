Previous studies indicate that TGEV infection induces cell apoptosis in host cells. In this study, we investigated the roles and regulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in TGEV-activated apoptotic signaling. The results showed that TGEV infection induced ROS accumulation, whereas UV-irradiated TGEV did not promote ROS accumulation. In addition, TGEV infection lowered mitochondrial transmembrane potential in PK-15 cell line, which could be inhibited by ROS scavengers, pyrrolidinedithiocarbamic (PDTC) and N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC). Furthermore, the two scavengers significantly inhibited the activation of p38 MAPK and p53 and further blocked apoptosis occurrence through suppressing the TGEV-induced Bcl-2 reduction, Bax redistribution, cytochrome c release and caspase-3 activation. These results suggest that oxidative stress pathway might be a key element in TGEV-induced apoptosis and TGEV pathogenesis.",

Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are involved in various cellular processes such as proliferation, apoptosis and inflammation [12] . The generation of ROS can be induced under various conditions of stress, including ionizing radiation, chemotherapeutic drugs and viral infections [13] . ROS not only kill target cells but may also overwhelm cellular antioxidant defenses of neighboring cells, leading to damage of DNA [12] . Meanwhile, ROS have also been implicated in some important signaling pathways, such as MAPK and p53 pathways [14] . In our previous works we have demonstrated that TGEV activates p38 MAPK and p53 signaling pathways, causes transcriptional induction of Bax and cytochrome c release from mitochondria to cytosol upon TGEV infection [6, 7] . The study presented here demonstrated that TGEV infection could induce ROS accumulation to regulate the apoptotic signalings, which might play primary role in the pathogenesis of TGEV.",

Time course analysis of TGEV infected PK-15 cells showed that with ROS accumulation, mitochondrial membrane potential reduced significantly, suggesting that TGEV-induced ROS accumulation lead to outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP). Mitochondrial oxidative damage can also increase the tendency of mitochondria to release cellular toxic proteins such as cytochrome c (cyt c) to the cytosol and thereby activate the cell's apoptotic machinery [14, 17] .

In our present works we have demonstrated that about 60% of ROS were produced after p53 signaling was activated in TGEV infected PK-15 cells. Block of p53 activation could significantly attenuate the increase of this part of ROS. These results suggest that ROS accumulation in TGEV-infected cells is predominantly attribute to p53 activation. In addition, inhibition of ROS by NAC and PDTC could partially reduce the activation of p38 MAPK and p53, suggesting that ROS might be an upstream signal molecule involved in the activation of p38 MAPK and p53 signaling pathways in TGEV-infected PK-15 cells. Our results provide a link between the known mediators of apoptosis, p53 and ROS, and indicate the order in the pathway by which these mediators exert their effects ROS downstream to p53. Consistent with this model, ROS production in response to p53 occurred ahead of apoptotic death, indicating that p53-generated ROS may constitute a signal for apoptosis rather than being a consequence of the cellular changes associated with apoptosis.",
