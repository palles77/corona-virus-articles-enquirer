Design: A cross-sectional questionnaire survey was conducted on 3,541 households in China in 2015. Participants: Households were selected using a stratified cluster sampling strategy, representing central, eastern, western and southern regions of China. The designed questionnaires were administered through face-to-face interviews. Outcome Measures: Household emergency preparedness was measured with 14 indicators, tapping into the supply of nine emergency necessities (food and water, extra batteries,",

Logistic regression models were established to identify predictors of well-preparedness based on 3,541 returned questionnaires containing no missing values. Results: Only 9.9% of households were well-prepared for emergencies: 53.6% did not know what to do and 31.6% did not want to think about it. A higher level of preparedness was found in the respondents who participated in emergency training activities (AOR=2.458), had better emergency knowledge (AOR=2.278), reported less fate-submissiveness (AOR=1.622) and more self-reliance (AOR=1.376), had a higher income (AOR=1.400), and held more positive attitudes toward preparedness (AOR=1.295).",

It is deemed a cost-effective investment in preventing losses and is considered one of the four priority areas in the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030, which was endorsed by the third United Nations World Conference in Japan. 4 Over the past few decades, emergency response efforts have evolved from a focus on top-down relief assistance to a more comprehensive strategy with a greater emphasis on community participation and pre-event preparedness for better risk management. This is because emergency victims often face geographical isolation as a result of damage to local infrastructure such as energy, road and communication facilities. 5 Consequently, the arrival of external rescue support may experience two or more days of delay. 6 But rescue efforts in the first couple of days in disastrous events are critical. 7 Community and household preparedness in self-rescue efforts prior to the arrival of external assistance may result in the difference between the chance of survival and death. 8 Empirical evidence shows that sufficient household preparedness can significantly mitigate the negative consequences of emergency events. 9 The United Nations International Strategy for Disaster Reduction (UNISDR) defined preparedness as the \"knowledge, capacities and actions to effectively respond to the effects of hazard events, whether or not they have occurred\". 10 Preparedness activities can be developed at the individual, household, community and governmental levels. Household preparedness plays a critical role because it is an integral part of any individual and community effort. Household emergency preparedness requires stockpiling emergency supplies, planning for emergency events and other actions like buying accident insurance. [11] [12] Previous studies revealed poor household preparedness for disastrous events across a range of different settings. [13] [14] Despite a rise in the number of publications on household preparedness in developed countries, there is a serious shortage of literature documenting the situation in developing countries.",

Public knowledge on emergency responses is universally poor in China. 23 Educational campaigns, if designed and implemented properly, can effectively improve public knowledge. However, this has to be done through multiple avenues. Governmental agencies can coordinate the timely provision of adequate information about emergency events. Emergency training can be offered through specifically designed drill exercise, 30 or as part of the national essential education system. In Japan, a disaster-prone country for example, disaster mitigation has been integrated into its national school curriculum. 31 However, knowledge improvement by itself is not enough. The mentality of inertia in the public needs to be addressed. A positive correlation between the recognition of self-reliance and better household preparedness is evident as confirmed in this study and others. 32 But unfortunately, many traditional cultures encourage fate submissiveness. 18 A study in Saudi Arabia found that most (93%) respondents believed that floods, earthquakes and other natural disasters are signs of God. 33 Fatalism is an attitude of self-defeatism which may lead individuals into helpless, undermining their efforts of individual preparedness.

The preparedness of individual households can make a difference between life and death. The National Partnership Agreement on Natural Disaster Resilience in Australia therefore emphasizes the significance of involving multiple parties including individuals. 38 Emergency response systems are often complex and adaptive. A highly participatory strategy would 39 Trust in the government is important given that it is most likely to play a coordinating role in emergency events. 40 However, over-reliance on the government and professional workers could dampen household efforts for future disasters. 41 A study of post-earthquake survivors in China showed that high expectations of the public on the government are associated with high trust in the government, leading to increased complacency in individual efforts in preparedness. 16 In China, governmental response to disasters from the military force has often been extraordinarily rapid and efficient. For example, an earthquake-relief headquarter was established by the army 18 minutes after the earthquake strike in Ya'an and 5000-6000 rescue workers were deployed on the same day. But people need to realize that there is always a gap before the full functioning of external rescue assistance, a gap which needs to be filled by the survivors of disasters. 7 Poor cooperation from those being rescued can also jeopardize professional efforts.",

Household preparedness plays a critical role because it is an integral part of any individual and community effort. The concept of household preparedness emphasizes household responsibilities and the capability to reduce risks and damage, 11 which requires stockpiling emergency supplies, planning for emergency events and other actions like buying accident insurance. [12] [13] Previous studies revealed poor household preparedness for disastrous events across a range of different settings. [14] [15] Despite a rise in the number of publications on household preparedness in developed countries, there is a serious shortage of literature documenting the situation in developing countries. Empirical evidence shows that household preparedness is associated with many factors, including knowledge, risk awareness, prior exposure to disasters, attitudes toward emergency preparedness, 16 and trust in the government. Socioeconomic status may also play an important role. 17-18, Developing countries are facing ever-increasing challenges and costs associated with disastrous events.But experiences from developed countries cannot be extrapolated to developing countries without consideration of the local contexts.",

Poor household preparedness for emergency events is common in many developing countries, such as Turkey and Iran. 29 The performance of developed countries, although better than in developing countries, is also far from satisfactory. In Australia, about one-fifth of households have sufficient supplies of items for emergency events such as a torch, radio, mobile phone, first aid kit, appropriate batteries and an emergency contact list. A study in the US revealed that 12.3% of American households possessed a three-day supply of water and nonperishable food, an evacuation plan, a working flashlight and radio.

The odds of well-preparedness doubled in the respondents with a higher than average level of knowledge. Training would also double the odds of well-preparedness, possibly through filling knowledge gaps. This is echoed by over half of the respondents who reported knowledge shortage as the major barrier to preparing for emergency events. The association between knowledge and preparedness for emergency events is further supported by the link between education in general and preparedness. Prior exposure to emergency events may also improve the knowledge and attitudes of people, resulting in better preparedness for emergency events. These findings are consistent with previous studies. 30, 31 Fate-submissiveness and a lack of recognition of self-reliance were identified as a significant predictor of poor-preparedness in the logistic regression model. Similarly, a lack of motivation to act (\"do not want to think about it\" and \"leave it to professionals\") was reported as the second most significant barrier in 34 or as part of the national essential education system. In Japan, a disaster-prone country for example, disaster mitigation has been integrated into its national school curriculum. 35 However, knowledge improvement by itself is not enough. The mentality of inertia in the public needs to be addressed. A positive correlation between the recognition of self-reliance and better household preparedness is evident as confirmed in this study and others. 36 But unfortunately, many traditional cultures encourage fate submissiveness. A study in Saudi Arabia found that most (93%) respondents believed that floods, earthquakes and other natural disasters are signs of God. 37 Fatalism is an attitude of self-defeatism which may lead individuals into helpless, undermining their efforts of individual preparedness.

The National Partnership Agreement on Natural Disaster Resilience in Australia therefore emphasizes the significance of involving multiple parties including individuals. 42 Emergency response systems are often complex and adaptive. A highly participatory strategy would encourage individuals to take more responsibility, become less dependent on the government, and leave more resources for others. 43 Trust in the government is important given that it is most likely to play a coordinating role in emergency events. 44 However, over-reliance on the government and professional workers could dampen household efforts for future disasters. 45 A study of post-earthquake survivors in China showed that high expectations of the public on the government are associated with high trust in the government, leading to increased complacency in individual efforts in preparedness. 16 In China, governmental response to disasters from the military force has often been extraordinarily rapid and efficient. For example, an earthquake-relief headquarter was established by the army 18 minutes after the earthquake strike in Ya'an and 5000-6000 rescue workers were deployed on the same day. But people need to realize that there is always a gap before the full functioning of external rescue assistance, a gap which needs to be filled by the survivors of disasters. 7 Poor cooperation from those being rescued can also jeopardize professional efforts.",

Household preparedness plays a critical role because it is an integral part of any individual and community effort. The concept of household preparedness emphasizes household responsibilities and the capability to reduce risks and damage, 11 which requires stockpiling emergency supplies, planning for emergency events and other actions like buying accident insurance. [12] [13] Previous studies revealed poor household preparedness for disastrous events across a range of different settings. [14] [15] Despite a rise in the number of publications on household preparedness in developed countries, there is a serious shortage of literature documenting the situation in developing countries. Empirical evidence shows that household preparedness is associated with many factors, including knowledge, risk awareness, prior exposure to disasters, attitudes toward emergency preparedness, 16 and trust in the government. Socioeconomic status may also play an important role. 17-18, Developing countries are facing ever-increasing challenges and costs associated with disastrous events.But experiences from developed countries cannot be extrapolated to developing countries without consideration of the local contexts.",

This result is consistent with the findings of studies conducted elsewhere in China. Poor household preparedness for emergency events is common in many developing countries, such as Turkey and Iran. 29 The performance of developed countries, although better than in developing countries, is also far from satisfactory. In Australia, about one-fifth of households have sufficient supplies of items for emergency events such as a torch, radio, mobile phone, first aid kit, appropriate batteries and an emergency contact list. A study in the US revealed that 12.3% of American households possessed a three-day supply of water and nonperishable food, an evacuation plan, a working flashlight and radio. Similarly, 30% of households in Japan stockpiled food and drinking water for emergency events. 15",

The odds of well-preparedness doubled in the respondents with a higher than average level of knowledge. Training would also double the odds of well-preparedness, possibly through filling knowledge gaps. This is echoed by over half of the respondents who reported knowledge shortage as the major barrier to preparing for emergency events. The association between knowledge and preparedness for emergency events is further supported by the link between education in general and preparedness. Prior exposure to emergency events may also improve the knowledge and attitudes of people, resulting in better preparedness for emergency events. These findings are consistent with previous studies. 30, 31 Fate-submissiveness and a lack of recognition of self-reliance were identified as a significant predictor of poor-preparedness in the logistic regression model. Similarly, a lack of motivation to act (\"do not want to think about it\" and \"leave it to professionals\") was reported as the second most significant barrier in 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 34 or as part of the national essential education system. In Japan, a disaster-prone country for example, disaster mitigation has been integrated into its national school curriculum. 35 However, knowledge improvement by itself is not enough. The mentality of inertia in the public needs to be addressed. A positive correlation between the recognition of self-reliance and better household preparedness is evident as confirmed in this study and others. 36 But unfortunately, many traditional cultures encourage fate submissiveness. A study in Saudi Arabia found that most (93%) respondents believed that floods, earthquakes and other natural disasters are signs of God. 37 Fatalism is an attitude of self-defeatism which may lead individuals into helpless, undermining their efforts of individual preparedness.

The National Partnership Agreement on Natural Disaster Resilience in Australia therefore emphasizes the significance of involving multiple parties including individuals. 42 Emergency response systems are often complex and adaptive. A highly participatory strategy would encourage individuals to take more responsibility, become less dependent on the government, and leave more resources for others. 43 Trust in the government is important given that it is most likely to play a coordinating role in emergency events. 44 However, over-reliance on the government and professional workers could dampen household efforts for future disasters. 45 A study of post-earthquake survivors in China showed that high expectations of the public on the government are associated with high trust in the government, leading to increased complacency in individual efforts in preparedness. 16 In China, governmental response to disasters from the military force has often been extraordinarily rapid and efficient. 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59  60   F  o  r  p  e  e  r  r  e  v  i  e  w  o  n  l  y For example, an earthquake-relief headquarter was established by the army 18 minutes after the earthquake strike in Ya'an and 5000-6000 rescue workers were deployed on the same day.

Although this study drew large samples from four representative regions in China, the participants were not completely randomly selected. One adult respondent was invited to represent each household in this study. But opinions from family members may not always been consistent. Household preparedness can involve many aspects. The 14 emergency items included in this study may not be exhaustive. Although the 14 items are not equally important, their importance varies with different emergency events. This makes it difficult to attach a fixed weight to each item in terms of their importance. For example, in a fire emergency,\"escape rope\" and \"gas mask\" are more important than having food and water. But this is not necessarily the case in an event when the survivors are isolated from the outside world. Therefore, we did not differentiate the importance of the emergency items. The dichotomization of the dependent variable is somehow arbitrary. Although it enabled easy interpretation of the results, certain information might get lost in the statistical analyses. However, the linear regression analysis generated consistent results. It is important to note that the study adopted a cross-sectional design, no causal relationships should be assumed.",

Design: A cross-sectional questionnaire survey was conducted on 3,541 households in China in 2015. Participants: Households were selected using a stratified cluster sampling strategy, representing central, eastern, western and southern regions of China. The designed questionnaires were administered through face-to-face interviews. Outcome Measures: Household emergency preparedness was measured with 14 indicators, tapping into the supply of nine emergency necessities (food and water, extra batteries, battery-powered radio, battery-operated flashlight, first aid kit, gas mask, fire extinguisher, escape ropes, whistle), coverage of accident insurance, knowledge of local emergency response systems (emergency numbers, exit routes and shelters), and availability of a household evacuation plan. If an individual acted on nine of the 14 indicators, they were deemed well-prepared. Logistic regression models were established to identify predictors of well-preparedness based on 3,541 returned questionnaires containing no missing values. Results: Only 9.9% of households were well-prepared for emergencies: 53.6% did not know what to do and 31.6% did not want to think about it. A higher level of preparedness was found in the respondents who have attained higher education(AOR=0.826 compared with the higher level), participated in emergency training activities (AOR=2.299), had better emergency knowledge (AOR=2.043), reported less fate-submissiveness (AOR=1.385) and more self-reliance (AOR=1.349), prior exposure to emergency events(AOR=1.280), and held more positive attitudes toward preparedness (AOR=1.286). Conclusion: Introduction No community is immune from the risk of emergencies and disasters in today's increasingly interconnected world. Many emergency events may be difficult to prevent. Inadequate preparation in response to these events can cause a tremendous loss in terms of human lives and health, property and infrastructure. It was natural disasters alone cost over US$ 100 billion annually worldwide. 1 According to the 2016 Humanitarian Response Plan launched by the World Health Organization (WHO), US$ 2.2 billion was needed to provide lifesaving health services to more than 79 million people in more than 30 countries due to protracted emergencies that year. 2 In the first half year of 2016, 68.77 million people in China were affected by floods, hail and geological disasters, resulting in 505 deaths and a direct economic loss of 89.04 billion Chinese Yuan (US$12.9645 billion). 3Strengthening emergency responses can effectively reduce human casualties and contribute to sustainable post-event development. It is deemed a cost-effective investment in preventing losses and is considered one of the four priority areas in the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030, which was endorsed by the third United Nations World Conference in Japan.4  Over the past few decades, emergency response efforts have evolved from a focus on top-down relief assistance to a more comprehensive strategy with a greater emphasis on community participation and pre-event preparedness for better risk management.",

The designed questionnaires were administered through face-to-face interviews. Outcome Measures: Household emergency preparedness was measured with 14 indicators, tapping into the supply of nine emergency necessities (food and water, extra batteries, battery-powered radio, battery-operated flashlight, first aid kit, gas mask, fire extinguisher, escape ropes, whistle), coverage of accident insurance, knowledge of local emergency response systems (emergency numbers, exit routes and shelters), and availability of a household evacuation plan. If an individual acted on nine of the 14 indicators, they were deemed well-prepared. Logistic regression models were established to identify predictors of well-preparedness based on 3,541 returned questionnaires containing no missing values. Results: Only 9.9% of households were well-prepared for emergencies: 53.6% did not know what to do and 31.6% did not want to think about it. A higher level of preparedness was found in the respondents who have attained higher education(AOR=0.826 compared with the higher level), participated in emergency training activities (AOR=2.299), had better emergency knowledge (AOR=2.043), reported less fate-submissiveness (AOR=1.385) and more self-reliance (AOR=1.349), prior exposure to emergency events(AOR=1.280), and held more positive attitudes toward preparedness (AOR=1.286).
