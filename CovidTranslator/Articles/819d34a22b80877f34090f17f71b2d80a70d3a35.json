Several of the current in vitro assays, such as enzyme linked immunoabsobent assay (ELISA) or indirect fluorescent antibody assay (IFA), can identify coronavirus seropositive cats, but due to the high degree of cross reaction between FECV and FIPV, these tests cannot be used to distinguish one infection from the other [25] .

AR58-3 contained 52 residues from galk and 126 residues representing aa 97-222 of the Ts DF-2 FIPV spike protein, which has exact homology to FIPV 1146 in this region.

The two N-terminal peptides were designed to look for regions of heterogenicity, while the C-terminal peptide was expected to be recognized by antibodies from cats infected by any coronavirus. These peptides had excellent antigenic profiles based on computer analysis of the primary aa sequence which predicted these regions to be surface-exposed. This approach was used by Talbot et al. [31] to produce a synthetic peptide homologous to residues 993-1002 of murine hepatitis virus (MHV) strain JHM. This MHV spike peptide was conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin and found to elicit high levels of neutralizing antibodies which protected mice against lethal MHV challenge [31] . Three groups of rabbits were immunized with the OVA conjugate of either aa 137-t 51, aa 150-180, or aa 950-990 homologous to the S protein of FIPV strain 79-1146. Sera from these rabbits contained antibodies that did not react to viral antigen of FIPV strains DF-2 or 79-1146 by ELISA or western blot analysis (data not shown).",

The synthetic peptide conjugates which contained either N-terminal or C-terminal FIPV strain 79-1146 spike protein aa were also screened against sera from cats exposed to FIPV or FECV by ELISA. Only the C-terminal synthetic peptide was recognized by the cat sera from either FIPV or FECV exposed cats. Therefore, antibodies to this peptide could not differentiate between FIPV and FECV. The C-terminal peptide contained residues 950--990 which is larger than the N-terminal peptides of 137-151 and 150-180. This increased size may have allowed the C-terminal peptide to fold and therefore mimic conformational epitopes found in native FIPV or FECV spike proteins [4] . However, other investigators have identified linear neutralizing epitopes in MHV strain A59 aa 848-aa 856 and MHV strain JHM aa 993-aa 1002 that are at similar locations as this residue sequence (aa 950-aa 990, [16, 29] ).",

The two N-terminal peptides may represent non-immunodominant regions or portions of a discontinuous epitope and were therefore not targets of natural FIPV or FECV induced humoral response [25] . Therefore, a larger spike protein fragment was produced that included sequences of the two smaller peptides. The recombinant E. coIi clone AR58-3 expressed a galk/Ts-DF-2 S fusion protein which contains 56 aa of the host galactokinase protein and 126aa of (Ts DF-2 FIPV) spike protein (homologous to residues 97-222 of Ts DF2 FIPV). The fusion protein AR58-3, expressed in E. coli forms aggregated structures in inclusion bodies. Strong denaturing conditions were required for inclusion body solubilization prior to affinity purification. In addition, AR58-3 was reduced before western blot analysis. Therefore, recombinant E. coli antigens are most suitable for identifying the same category of epitopes that are detected by the use of synthetic peptides, namely linear or sequential epitopes.",

The symptomatic cats may have had difficulty in clearing the virus compared to non-symptomatic cats.

This observation was encouraging because it suggested that it might be possible to differentiate between cats exposed to the virulent FIPV strains DF-2 and 79-1146 and the avirulent FECV. The DF-2 and FECV S gene have been recently sequenced [28] . When compared to the published 79-1146 S gene, some interesting results were shown in terms of aa homology. The DF-2 and 79-1146 show greater than 99~o aa homology. Although the DF-2 and 79-1146 share greater than 93~ aa homology with FECV, of their 50 and 52 aa differences respectively, all are within the N-terminal half of the protein. In addition, a very high aa divergence was observed between aa 133-159 (8 of 18 aa differ between FIPV and FECV) [28] . The ability of the fusion protein AR58-3 to differentiate between FIPV and FECV exposed cats may in part be due to the divergence observed in the region aa 97-222.",

The TN 406 strain of FIPV is classified as a virulent Type-I virus, whereas DF-2 and 79-1146 are virulent Type-II viruses, and FECV 1683 is an avirulent Type-II virus [26] . Based on the lack of reactivity to AR58-3 and inability of sera from cats exposed to TN 406 to cross neutralize, it would appear that the Type I FIPV strains may contain regions of considerable heterogeneity. Therefore, a diagnostic assay using the recombinant AR58-3 fusion protein as antigen substrate to differentiate cats exposed to virulent strains of FIPV from those exposed to avirulent strains of FIPV or FECV would not be possible. Spike protein gene sequence data is needed on the Type-I FIPV's, namely strains TN 406, UCD-1, UCD-3, and UCD-4. This information would help to locate possible conserved regions unique for all virulent strains of FIPV. In conclusion, the recombinant E. coli fusion protein AR58-3 is recognized by antibodies from cats with clinical manifestations of FIP, if exposure is from virulent Type-II strains of FIPV. In contrast, antibodies from cats exposed to F E C V 1683 an avirulent Type-II virus did not react to AR58-3 by western blot analysis. However, sera from cats infected with strain T N 406 FIPV, irrespective of whether the cats became sick or remained healthy, they did not recognize the fusion protein. Spike gene sequencing of other virulent and avirutent strains of F I P V are needed to identify regions containing type-specific epitopes. Furthermore, expression of additional recombinant spike protein fragments should be explored to target regions of biological importance.",
