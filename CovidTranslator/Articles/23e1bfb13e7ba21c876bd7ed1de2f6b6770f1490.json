            "text": "Proteolytical cleavage of the picornaviral polyprotein is essential for viral replication. Therefore, viral proteases are attractive targets for anti-viral therapy. Most assays available for testing proteolytical activity of proteases are performed in vitro, using heterologously expressed proteases and peptide substrates. To deal with the disadvantages associated with in vitro assays, we modified a cell-based protease assay for picornavirus proteases. The assay is based on the induction of expression of a firefly luciferase reporter by a chimeric transcription factor in which the viral protease and cleavage sites are inserted between the GAL4 binding domain and the VP16 activation domain. Firefly luciferase expression is dependent on cleavage of the transcription factor by the viral protease. This biosafe assay enables testing the effect of compounds on protease activity in cells while circumventing the need for infection. We designed the assay for 3C proteases (3C pro ) of various enteroviruses as well as of viruses of several other picornavirus genera, and show that the assay is amenable for use in a high-throughput setting. Furthermore, we show that the spectrum of activity of 3C pro inhibitor AG7088 (rupintrivir) not only encompasses enterovirus 3C pro but also 3C pro of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV), an aphthovirus. In contrary, AG7404 (compound 1), an analogue of AG7088, had no effect on FMDV 3C pro activity, for which we provide a structural explanation.",

The single open reading frame is divided into three regions: P1, encoding the structural proteins, and P2 and P3, encoding the nonstructural proteins. In some viruses, the P1 region is preceded by a small leader (L) protein. The viral polyprotein is cleaved by viral proteases resulting in the release of the viral proteins and some stable precursors. In all picornaviruses, the 3C protease (3C pro ) is responsible for the majority of the cleavages within the viral polyprotein. Some picornavirus genera encode an additional protease. 2A pro , expressed by members from the genus Enterovirus, cleaves between the P1 and P2 regions. L pro , expressed by Aphthovirus and Erbovirus members, autocatalytically cleaves itself from P1 at its C terminus.",

            "text": "In addition to their function in polyprotein processing, viral proteases target a variety of host proteins for efficient virus replication. These include proteins involved in translation, transcription, immune signaling, or nucleocytoplasmic traffic. E.g., enterovirus 2A pro and aphthovirus L pro impair cap-dependent translation through cleavage of initiation factor eIF4G, leading to a translational host shut-off (Devaney et al., 1988; Krausslich et al., 1987; Lloyd et al., 1988; Medina et al., 1993) . Cleavage of eIF4AI by FMDV 3C pro and poly(A)-binding protein by enterovirus 2A pro and 3C pro also contribute to the host shut-off (Joachims et al., 1999; Li et al., 2001) . Viral proteases provide an attractive target for anti-viral therapy against picornaviruses because of their essential role in the virus replication cycle and the absence of cellular homologues (Tong, 2002) . As yet, no anti-viral therapy has been approved to treat picornavirus infections. Most human pathogens can be found in the genus Enterovirus, e.g., poliovirus (PV), coxsackievirus, enterovirus 71 (EV71), and human rhinovirus (HRV). These viruses cause a variety of diseases including acute flaccid paralysis, aseptic meningitis, respiratory infections, and hand-foot-and-mouth disease. The highly contagious foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV), an Aphthovirus member, is one of the most important animal pathogens, causing outbreaks among livestock with enormous economical impact.",

AG7404 displays anti-viral activity in vitro and is safe and well-tolerated in vivo, but clinical development was discontinued (Patick et al., 2005) . Recently, we reported the synthesis of a series of 3C pro inhibitors, which, like AG7088, are peptidic a,b-unsaturated esters (Tan et al., 2013) .

However, such cell-free assays for compound testing have some drawbacks. First, compounds able to inhibit proteolytical activity in these assays may be unable to cross the plasma membrane. Secondly, in vitro assays are unable to assess cell toxicity. Thirdly, compounds that require cellular activation will not be identified as a hit in a non-cell-based assay. To deal with these issues, we have adapted a cell-based assay developed previously for EV71 3C pro ( Fig. 1) (Lee et al., 2008) . We have extended the assay to multiple picornavirus 3C pro and applied the assay to test the spectrum of 3C pro inhibitors AG7088 and SG85. We demonstrate that our cell-based protease assay is an easy and biosafe assay for testing protease activity and the effect of inhibitors, and that it is amenable for use in high-throughput set-up.",

Expression of this reporter plasmid, pG5luc, is regulated by a transcription factor composed of the DNA-binding domain of Gal4 (Gal4BD) and the transactivating domain of VP16 (VP16AD). In between these domains, we inserted part of the CVB3 polyprotein containing 3C pro and neighboring cleavage sites (D3A-3B-3C pro -D3D). Proteolytical activity of 3C pro leads to cleavage of the chimeric protein at the 3C pro cleavage sites and as a consequence, the transcription factor lacks its VP16AD domain and no Fluc is expressed. However, in the case of an inactive protease no proteolytic cleavage occurs and the full-length fusion protein transactivates expression of FLuc. Renilla luciferase (RLuc), independently expressed from a different promoter on the plasmid expressing the protease construct, serves as a measure for transfection efficiency and indirectly for cell viability.",

Rationale for the differences in the potencies of AG7088, AG7404, and SG85 towards FMDV 3C pro We utilized computational modeling techniques to explain the observed differences in inhibitory activity of AG7088, AG7404 and SG85 (Fig. 4A ) towards FMDV 3C pro . Induced fit docking was used to predict the binding mode of AG7088 (Nabuurs et al., 2007) , the most potent inhibitor of FMDV 3C pro of the three compounds, to FMDV 3C pro . A recent crystal structure of FMDV 3C pro complexed with a peptide substrate (Fig. 4B ) (Zunszain et al., 2010) reveals that the so-called b-ribbon that separates the S2 and S4 subsites of the protease is slightly longer in FMDV 3C pro compared to other 3C proteases, as for example seen in the complex of HRV2 3C pro with AG7088 ( Fig. 4C ) Sweeney et al., 2007) . The models we generated suggest interactions with this loop to be mainly responsible for the observed selectivity profile of the three compounds assayed. Fig. 4D shows the obtained model of AG7088 bound to FMDV 3C pro , with the b-ribbon highlighted in blue. The model suggests extensive tight hydrophobic interactions between the P3 position of AG7088 and the b-ribbon of FMDV 3C pro . The ring closure present at the P3 position of AG7404 is predicted to clash with the bribbon of FMDV 3C pro , providing a rationale for the observed inactivity of AG7404 toward FMDV 3C pro . SG85, which has intermediate potency compared to AG7088 and AG7404, contains a t-butyl ether of serine as its P3 side chain. This introduces more steric bulk compared to AG7088, but allows for more flexibility when compared to AG7404, potentially explaining the observed intermediate activity of SG85.",

A major advantage of this assay is that it is cell-based, in contrast to most protease assays available. As a consequence, compounds that cannot penetrate the plasma membrane or have adverse cellular effects are selected out when searching for protease inhibitors. Another advantage is that the assay depends on an increase in read-out signal upon inhibition of protease activity.

The assay could also be applied to proteases of other plus-strand RNA viruses, such as hepatitis C virus, dengue virus, and SARS coronavirus. One example for which our cell-based assay would be advantageous is NS2B/NS3 pro of dengue virus (family Flaviviridae). NS3 protease activity is most commonly tested with a construct in which the polypeptide chains of the co-factor NS2B and the protease domain of NS3 are linked by a nonapeptide linker.

We showed that the assay is excellent for use in a high-throughput setting, as exemplified by a Z 0 -factor of 0.74 for CVB3 3C pro (Fig. 2D ). It would be advisable to also test the assay with reversible protease inhibitors before applying it in a high-throughput screening, to confirm that the assay can also identify such inhibitors. Several adaptations to further optimize the assay for use in large-scale screens may be possible. The assay may be downscaled to a 384-well format to save material. Also, we here provide a proof of principle for use of GFP as read-out instead of FLuc (Fig. 2B) . Although this reporter is less sensitive, it is more cost-efficient. In addition, cell lines with stable constructs that are inducible, may be used.",

We showed that both compounds inhibited 3C pro of all enterovirus tested, i.e., CVB3, EV71, PV, and HRV14, but they had no effect on processing by 3C pro of EMCV, SAFV, HPeV, or HAV. A recent publication reported that inhibition of HAV replication by AG7088 is strain-dependent, and also found no effect on the strain we used (HM175) (Debing et al., 2013) . Interestingly, both compounds inhibited 3C pro of FMDV, albeit with a lower potency than CVB3 3C pro . Testing in multicycle CPE-reduction assays revealed that our assay accurately predicted that the compounds possessed anti-viral activity. While this study was in progress, AG7088 was shown to inhibit FMDV 3C pro in an in vitro FRET assay using fluorogenic substrates with recombinant 3C pro (IC 50 = 4.21 \u00b1 1.97 lM) (Kim et al., 2012) , corroborating our finding. The assay presented and the insights developed here may help as a tool to design potent protease inhibitors of FMDV, a highly contagious zoonotic virus that can cause outbreaks with an enormous economic impact.",

            "text": "Principle and evaluation of the cell-based protease assay. (A) A protease expression construct is co-transfected with the pG5luc reporter plasmid into COS-1 cells. The protease construct expresses a chimeric protein which contains a GAL4 binding domain (GAL4BD) and a VP16 activation domain (VP16AD) between which part of the CVB3 polyprotein (15 C-terminal amino acids of 3A, 3B, 3C pro , and 15 N-terminal acids of 3D) is inserted. Active protease cleaves the chimeric protein at the 3C pro cleavage (arrow). If the protease is catalytically inactive, binding of GAL4BD to the GAL4 sequences in the reporter plasmid recruits VP16AD to the transcription start site, resulting in induction of FLuc expression. (B) The fusion protein is 3C pro -dependently cleaved. Plasmids pBind, pBind-VP16, pBind-3C pro (CVB3)-VP16, or pBind-3C pro [C147A](CVB3)-VP16 were cotransfected with pG5luc into COS-1 cells. The next day, cells were lysed and the proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and stained with a-GAL4BD and a-Tubulin antibodies.(C + D) Inhibition of 3C pro activity results in induction of FLuc expression. COS-1 cells were co-transfected with protease constructs in combination with the pG5luc reporter and immediately treated with DMSO or AG7088 at 50 lM (C) or at the indicated concentrations (D). At 16 h post transfection, the cells were lysed and FLuc and RLuc were measured. Experiments were performed in triplicate and mean values \u00b1 SD are depicted.",
