            "text": "Osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH) is one of the intractable diseases. It is controversial whether the lesion size assessed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can change over time without any operative treatment. In this study, we used MRI to observe the lesion size changes of ONFH induced by corticosteroid administration in severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) patients. The study included 51 SARS patients (84 hips) with early-stage ONFH who did not receive any operative treatment and were diagnosed by MRI. All of the patients underwent MRI follow-ups. Each patient was evaluated on the basis of the lesion volume on MRI at every follow-up for further comparisons. At the first MRI scan, the mean lesion volume was 10.12 \u00b1 8.05 cm 3 (range: 0.39-41.62 cm 3 ). At the mid-term follow-up (2.5 years), the mean lesion volume was 7.82\u00b17.59 cm 3 (range: 0.11-39.65 cm 3 ). At the final follow-up (five years), complete regression of the lesion was observed in six hips, and the mean lesion volume was 5.67\u00b16.58 cm 3 (range: 0.00-31.47 cm 3 ). Overall, the lesion volume was reduced by >15% in 80 hips, and only four hips with relatively larger lesion volumes showed no apparent reductions. The reduction in lesion size of ONFH observed on MRI is a slow, discontinuous and time-dependent process.",

            "text": "Osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH) is one of the intractable diseases that usually affect young people. Most studies have shown that the prognosis of ONFH and the outcomes of surgical treatments are associated with the lesion size [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . Hence, it is very significant to establish whether the lesion size of ONFH can change over time. However, this issue currently remains controversial. Although several reports have demonstrated that it is impossible for the lesion size to change by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evaluation during development of the disease without any operative treatments [3, 4, 8, 9] , other studies have shown that reductions, and even complete resolution, or increments in the necrotic area can occur over several years [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] .",

From March to May 2003, 426 medical staff contracted SARS and were treated with a corticosteroid. From September 2003 to January 2004, all the medical staff were screened by MRI and radiography organised by the Beijing Municipal Government, and 87 patients with ONFH were diagnosed by MRI. Subsequently, the patients with ONFH were followed annually and the latest follow-ups were carried out from October to November 2008. All of the patients underwent more than three MRI scans. Patients followed by MRI in both 2006 and 2008 and without surgical intervention were included in this study. A total of 33 patients (56 hips) who subsequently underwent surgery for discomfort during the course of the disease were excluded. Finally, 84 hips in 51 patients without smoking or alcohol abuse were included. The final patients comprised 17 men and 34 women with a mean age of 33.84\u00b1 9.15 years (range: 20-54 years). All 51 patients with ONFH were at the pre-collapse stage and without joint pain at the first MRI scan. According to the Association Research Circulation Osseous (ARCO) international staging system proposed in 1993 [20] , 78 hips were at stage I and six hips were at stage II. The mean time from administration of the corticosteroid to the diagnosis of ONFH was 6.05 \u00b1 1.64 months (range: 2.3-9.0 months). The mean time interval between the baseline and the latest MRI scan was 60.19\u00b11.71 months (range: 57-63.2 months).

The area of osteonecrosis was considered to be the sector demarcated by the serpiginous line corresponding to the band-like hypointense margin. The outer border of this low-intensity region was assumed to represent the edge of the necrotic area. For each coronal slice, the area of osteonecrosis was outlined using an image analysis program (QWin, Leica, Heidelberg, Germany), and the volume of osteonecrosis was calculated by multiplying the area of osteonecrosis by the thickness (thickness of the slice plus the gap). The total volume of necrotic bone was the sum of the individual volumes of all slices [22] .",

During our follow-up study in SARS patients, there was an interesting finding that a few radiologically normal hips showed abnormal signals, such as band formation or decreased signal areas, on T1weighted images and normal signals on STIR images. On the follow-up MRI, most of these abnormal signals disappeared on T1-weighted images and still showed a normal presentation on STIR images, while a few new cases occurred. We classified these hips into a non-necrotic group (Fig. 3) . Since STIR is more sensitive than other protocols for detecting marrow abnormalities [26] , we considered that the band or ring-like zones with decreased signal intensity on T1-weighted images and increased signal intensity on the corresponding STIR images could be used as diagnostic criteria for ONFH in the early stage.
