Infection of fibroblasts with the murine hepatitis coronavirus (MHV) and SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) did not result in nuclear translocation of interferon-regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), a key transcription factor involved in IFN induction, and induction of IFN mRNA transcription. Furthermore, MHV and SARS-CoV infection could not prevent IFN induction by poly (I:C) or Sendai virus, suggesting that these CoVs do not inactivate IRF3-mediated transcription regulation, but apparently prevent detection of replicative RNA by cellular sensory molecules. Our data indicate that shielding of viral RNA to host cell sensors might be the main general mechanism for coronaviruses to prevent IFN induction.",

            "text": "Type 1 interferons (IFN) are soluble cytokines that mediate an anti-viral state during a wide variety of infections. Their expression is mainly regulated at the level of transcription (Haller et al., 2006) . Virus infections activate signaling pathways that eventually result in the production of IFN-\u03b2 and IFN-\u03b14 (immediate early IFNs). Molecular pattern recognition receptors, such as toll-like receptors (TLRs), are mainly expressed by specialized cells and can be triggered to initiate IFN production. Non-specialized cells like fibroblasts do not express these TLRs. For the induction of IFN-mediated innate immunity, these cells are dependent on the cytoplasmic RNA helicases retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) and melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA-5) (Haller et al., 2006) . The helicases recognize viral RNA and subsequently activate the IFN-mediated innate immune response. RIG-I recognizes RNA with unprotected 5\u2032-triphosphates and is activated upon infection of cells with influenza virus, flaviviruses and paramyxoviruses, whereas MDA-5 induces IFN production in response to double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) such as during picornavirus infection or transfection with poly (I:C) (Hornung et al., 2006; Kato et al., 2006; Pichlmair et al., 2006) . Interferon regulatory factors (IRF), such as IRF3, are the key switches for the transcription regulation of IFN production. IRF3 is constitutively expressed and localizes exclusively in the cytoplasm as an inactive monomer in non-infected cells. Upon infection, IRF3 is phosphorylated, resulting in its dimerization and subsequent translocation to the nucleus, where it forms a complex with co-activator p300/CBP to induce IFN-\u03b2 or IFN-\u03b14 transcription (Haller et al., 2006) .",

Murine hepatitis virus (MHV) is a group 2 CoV and is closely related to SARS-CoV, the causative agent of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak (Snijder et al., 2003) . Previous studies have shown that infection of fibroblasts with MHV and SARS-CoV does not result in a significant induction of IFN production through intracellular detection by RNA helicases. However, Virology 361 (2007) Versteeg and Spaan, in press ). Together, these observations suggest that CoVs prevent IFN induction and the subsequent activation of antiviral genes. Recently, it has been shown that SARS-CoV non-structural protein 1 (nsp1) degrades mRNA, including IFN messengers (Kamitani et al., 2006) thereby impairing a proper innate immune response. Here we report that despite accumulation of dsRNA in infected cells, translocation of IRF3 to the nucleus does not occur in MHV-and SARS-CoV-infected cells. These data suggest that the absence of IRF3 activation is a general characteristic of group 2 coronaviruses. Furthermore we show that MHV and SARS-CoV do not actively block IRF3 activation via either RIG-I or MDA-5 as they are unable to inhibit IRF3 translocation upon Sendai virus infection or poly (I:C) transfection, respectively.",

            "text": "To directly compare transcription induction of immediate early IFNs by MHV and SARS-CoV, we stably transformed murine L cells with a plasmid coding for the SARS-CoV receptor, resulting in a cell line (L-ACE2) that supported infection with both MHV and SARS-CoV. SARS-CoV infected 100% of the cells and efficiently replicated in L-ACE2 cells, completing one round of replication in 12 h, similar to the widely used Vero-E6 cells (data not shown). In 12 h, virus titers in the medium increased to approximately 5 \u00d7 10 8 PFU/ml. L-ACE2 cells were infected at MOI 10 with MHV to address IFN induction during infection. At 8 h p.i., intracellular RNA was isolated and IFN-\u03b14 mRNA concentrations were determined by RT-qPCR. Despite efficient MHV progeny virus production (data not shown), MHV infection did not result in IFN-\u03b14 ( Fig. 1A ) or IFN-\u03b2 mRNA (data not shown) upregulation. Infection with different MHV strains (MHV-2, -JHM) in other cell lines (DBT, WBC264-9) did not trigger IFN transcription either (data not shown). As a control for IFN-\u03b14 mRNA induction, mock-infected cells were transfected with poly (I:C). Poly (I:C) treatment resulted in an increase of IFN-\u03b14 mRNA levels by approximately 280-fold (Fig. 1A) , showing that these cells can be readily stimulated to initiate transcription of IFN genes. Next, MHV-infected cells were transfected with poly (I:C) to determine if MHV could actively prevent IFN induction through MDA-5-mediated IRF3 activation. Activation of IRF3 results in translocation of IRF3 to the nucleus which is a prerequisite for early IFN induction. In mock-and MHVinfected cells that were transfected with poly (I:C), a comparable fraction of the cells (85%) showed nuclear IRF3 translocation by IFA (Fig. 1B) . Approximately 60-65% of those cells were infected with MHV, indicating that MHV cannot prevent IRF3 translocation to the nucleus and that it does not affect the ratio of cells displaying nuclear translocated IRF3. Moreover, poly (I:C) transfection stimulated IFN-\u03b14 transcription to similar levels as in non-infected cells (Fig. 1A) . Although more than 90% of all cells were MHV-infected after control transfection, the percentage of infected cells was reduced to approximately 60% after poly (I:C) treatment (Fig. 1B) , indicating that although MHV infection can be established after poly (I:C) treatment, MHV is to some extent sensitive to IFN induction. Together, these data demonstrated that early IFNs were not induced by MHV infection and that MHV was unable to counteract IFN induction through MDA-5 by poly (I:C).",

Nuclear localization of IRF3 was analyzed by IFA in either MHV, SeV or MHV-SeV doubly infected cells. As shown in Fig. 1D , IRF3 was exclusively localized in the cytoplasm of cells that were infected with MHVonly. This result is not due to impairment of IRF3 translocation in these particular cells since IRF3 translocated to the nuclei of SeV-infected cells, both in the absence and presence of MHV (Fig. 1D ). Overall, 70% of the cells were infected with SeV and showed nuclear translocation of IRF3. Of those cells, 90% was also infected with MHV ( Fig. 1D ), indicating that MHV was unable to interfere with the nuclear translocation of IRF3 in cells that were infected with both MHV and SeV. The IFN-\u03b14 mRNA levels in these doubly infected cells were comparable to cells infected with only SeV (Fig. 1C ).

Viruses have evolved multiple mechanisms to prevent or inactivate IFN-mediated antiviral immunity at the level of IRF3 activation (Haller et al., 2006) . For example, influenza virus NS1 and E3L from poxviruses are dsRNA binding proteins that prevent IRF3 activation by sequestering viral RNA and thereby circumvent recognition by RIG-I and MDA-5. The V protein of several paramyxoviruses interacts directly with MDA-5 and prevents as such IRF3 activation and subsequent IFN induction. The hepatitis C virus protease NS3/ 4A cleaves the adaptor molecule VISA. The P protein of Borna disease virus (BDV) inhibits IRF3 phosphorylation by averting proper functioning of kinase TBK1 (Haller et al., 2006) . Importantly, hepatitis A virus infection has been reported to interfere with IRF3 translocation and IFN production induced by poly (I:C) and an exogenous virus, very similar to the approach described in this manuscript (Fensterl et al., 2005) . These viruses all actively interfere with the IFN induction pathway, rather than preventing its initial activation. However, our data indicate that MHV, SARS-CoV and possibly other group 2 CoVs have devised a yet undescribed mechanism where viral RNA is protected from the host cell's sensory molecules.",

In contrast to e.g. alphaviruses, MHV replication complexes are unstable and replication is marked by high turn-over of minus-strand RNA, whereas plusstrand RNA is relatively stable (Sawicki and Sawicki, 2005) . The unstable nature of the minus-strand RNA has been suggested to prevent the formation of stable dsRNA replicative intermediates/forms and subsequent triggering of the IFN response through MDA-5 (Sawicki and Sawicki, 2005) . Immunofluorescence labeling with a dsRNA-specific antibody (Fig. 3) strongly suggests that significant amounts of dsRNA are formed during CoV infection and that rapid turn-over of minusstrand RNA is unlikely to explain the lack of IFN induction. Since substantial amounts of dsRNA are present in infected cells (Fig. 3) , our data suggest that an additional form of protection of the dsRNA underlies the lack of IRF3 activation and IFN RNA synthesis (Figs. 1 and 2) . In comparison to MDA-5, RIG-Imediated IFN induction depends on 5\u2032-triphosphates rather than dsRNA (Hornung et al., 2006; Pichlmair et al., 2006) . dsRNA without 5\u2032-triphosphates like poly (I:C), picornavirus RNA which contains VPg at the 5\u2032-end or capped RNAs do not trigger IFN responses through RIG-I, but utilize MDA-5 . Coronavirus RNA is capped during replication by which RIG-I induction could be prevented (Lai et al., 1982) . Since viral RNA synthesis occurs in the cytoplasm and host cell RNA modifications such as capping occur in the nucleus, many viruses have devised strategies to provide their own RNA modification machinery. All group 2 coronaviruses encode five homologs of cellular enzymes involved in RNA processing (Snijder et al., 2003) . One of them is a 2\u2032-O-methyltransferase which could play a role in capping of the viral RNA.",

            "text": "The nature of the replication complex could create a compartment that prevents replicating RNA from being detected by the host cell. CoV replication complexes are associated with host cell membranes which could create such an environment. Although this is a general feature of all other positive-stranded RNA viruses, association with double membrane vesicles (DMV) has exclusively been reported for coronaand picornaviruses so far (Gosert et al., 2002; Snijder et al., 2006) . These DMVs could facilitate replication by compartmentalizing replication factors and providing structural support for membrane anchoring. Furthermore, DMVs could form a protective microenvironment that prevents viral RNA from being detected by host cell sensors. The fact that picornaviruses have also devised other mechanisms to actively interfere with correct induction and functioning of the IFN response (Haller et al., 2006) suggests that the formation of DMVs is apparently not sufficient to prevent IFN induction per se. Current knowledge on the similarities of the DMVs of these two virus families is insufficient to establish whether differential organization of CoV and picornavirus DMVs could explain these different properties. A recent report by Kato and co-workers suggested that viruses within the same families trigger IFN responses through the same pathway . We demonstrated that MHV does not interfere with the RIG-I or MDA-5 pathway. However, we cannot rule out that CoVs induce IFN responses through other cellular molecules than RIG-I or MDA-5 at this point. Although CoVs may express proteins that affect IFN induction when expressed separately, here we demonstrate that in the context of virus infection, CoVs do not significantly interfere directly with IRF3 translocation or IFN transcription. However, Spiegel and co-workers have reported nuclear IRF-3 localization during SARS-CoV infection (Spiegel et al., 2005) . It is currently unclear what underlies the discrepancy with our data. Their infections were performed using another SARS-CoV strain (FFM1) and different cells (a selected 293-cell clone) what may explain the differences. Similar results to ours showing the inability of MHV-A59 to interfere with MDA-5-or RIG-I-mediated IFN induction were recently published (Zhou and Perlman, 2007) . The results presented in our work confirm and support those findings. The new data on SARS-CoV provide evidence that all group 2 CoVs may employ a similar mechanism to prevent IFN induction.",

L cells stably expressing the SARS-CoV receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (L-ACE2) were constructed by transformation of L cells with plasmid pcDNA3/FLACE2 (Broer et al., 2006) . Full details will be published elsewhere. L-ACE2 cells were maintained as regular L cells, with the only exception that the medium was supplemented with 500 \u03bcg/ml G418. Strain A59 of MHV was obtained from ATCC. SARS-CoV strain Frankfurt 1 was grown on Vero-E6 cells and all work with infectious SARS-CoV was performed as described (Snijder et al., 2006) . MOI 1-10 was used for coronavirus infections throughout this study. MHV and SARS-CoV titers were determined by plaque assays on L cells and L-ACE2 cells, respectively. Recombinant Sendai virus H4 (SeV-H4) (Cadd et al., 1996) was kindly provided by D. Kolakofsky. SeV-H4 infections were carried out in complete medium for 30-45 min at 37\u00b0C after which complete medium was added to the inoculum.",
