Currently, there are no approved treatment regimens or vaccines for MERS. Here, we generated recombinant nonvirulent Newcastle disease virus (NDV) LaSota strain expressing MERS-CoV S protein (designated as rLa-MERS-S), and evaluated its immunogenicity in mice and Bactrian camels. The results revealed that rLa-MERS-S showed similar growth properties to those of LaSota in embryonated chicken eggs, while animal immunization studies showed that rLa-MERS-S induced MERS-CoV neutralizing antibodies in mice and camels. Our findings suggest that recombinant rLa-MERS-S may be a potential MERS-CoV veterinary vaccine candidate for camels and other animals affected by MERS.",

NDV is classified as lentogenic (nonvirulent), mesogenic (moderately virulent), or velogenic (highly virulent) according to their pathogenicity in poultry. Lentogenic strains, such as the LaSota, have also been applied as a vaccine vector targeting human and other animal diseases (Ge et al. 2007 (Ge et al. , 2010 Di Napoli et al. 2010a, b) . NDV is innately advantageous as a potential vaccine vector for the following reasons: Firstly, NDV is antigenically distinct from the mammalian paramyxoviruses, it does not typically cause an productive infection in mammals. Secondly, the pre-existing immunity against mammalian paramyxoviruses does not interfere with the replication capacity of NDV. In addition, the safety profile of NDV has been confirmed in many non-human primates as well as humans (Bukreyev et al. 2006; Bukreyev and Collins 2008; Khattar et al. 2010; Kortekaas et al. 2010) .",

VSV\u0394G-eGFP-MERS was grown and titrated in Vero E6 cells.

            "text": "MERS-CoV is a deadly emerging infectious pathogen that poses a serious public health threat. Development of MERS-CoV vaccines is important both to protect susceptible animals and to reduce animal-to-human transmission (Haagmans et al. 2016; Sabir et al. 2016) . In this study, a recombinant NDV, rLa-MERS-S, expressing MERS-CoV S protein was constructed. rLa-MERS-S maintained high growth titers in embryonated eggs and low pathogenicity in poultry and mice. The recombinant viruses induced significant MERS-CoV-specific neutralizing antibodies in mice and long-lasting MERS-CoV specific neutralizing antibodies in camels. Our findings demonstrated the potential of rLa-MERS-S as a candidate veterinary vaccine against MERS-CoV infection. Camels and other MERS-CoV-reservoir animals that are in close contact with humans may facilitate human infection and lead to sustained outbreak during pandemic outbreaks (Perera et al. 2013; Chu et al. 2014) . The MERS-CoV reservoir-harboring capacity by camels draws our attention, as to date there are an estimated 300 000 Bactrian camels in China. Consequently, given the highly threatening zoonotic potential of MERS-CoV, we previously carried out a serological and virological surveillance study in the camel herds of West Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region of China . Although our study did not identify any MERS-CoV RNA and antibodies in the camel herds, constant vigilance is still required. Furthermore, those results underscore the necessity in developing a reserve vaccine against MERS-CoV.",

            "text": "The role of neutralizing antibody against S protein of MERS-CoV in controlling viral infections has been well documented. Haagmans et al. (2016) showed that orthopoxvirus-vectored MERS-CoV vaccines (MVA-S) were effective in eliciting antibodies against MERS-CoV and could significantly reduce the amount of excreted infectious virus and viral RNA transcripts upon MERS-CoV challenge. In addition, Kim et al. (2014) reported that recombinant adenoviral vectors encoding MERS-CoV S protein (Ad5.MERS-S or Ad5.MERS-S1) could induce neutralizing antibodies in mice. The success of these viral-vectored MERS-CoV vaccines demonstrated that protection against MERS-CoV infection in camels could be achieved by live-attenuated vectored-MERS-CoV vaccines. While both MVA-or adenovirus-vectored MERS vaccines are safe and effective, their production process is complicated and costly, thus may not be suitable for use in developing countries. In contrast, NDV-vectored vaccines have several advantages: Their safety and efficacy profiles have been confirmed in many studies, are easy to culture and can be grown to high titers in chicken eggs, do not require complicated cell culture equipment, and are thermostable when lyophilized. These 2007) through intranasal immunization. In present study, due to the very limited camel numbers and the difficulties to practicing intranasal instillation in camels, we did not use intranasal immunization. While considering MERS-CoV's pathogenicity respiratory system, it is necessary to further explore and compare the immunogenicity of rLa-MERS-CoV given by intranasal and intramuscular route. These studies were scheduled in our institute's large animal facillity in future.",

The result is in agreement with the study by Zhang et al. (2016) in which the authors demonstrated that IgG1 played a more important role in MERS-CoV protection in DPP4 transgenic mice. Furthermore, this observation suggests that both Th1 (IgG2a) and Th2 (IgG1) antibody responses may be critical in inhibiting MERS-CoV infection. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that Th2 (IgG1) antibodies may play a dominant role in neutralizing MERS-CoV infection.",

Due to the unavailability of MERS-CoV, it was impossible for us to perform neutralization assays using live MERS-CoV. Instead, we used a VSV-based chimeric virus, VSV\u0394G-GFP-MERS, to mimic MERS-CoV in a serum neutralization test. The recombinant virus used the S protein, instead of the G protein, as its sole membrane anchored protein to attach and enter cells. Meanwhile, since the virus was engineered to express an eGFP gene as an additional transcription unit, the positively infected cells emitted green fluorescence. Our results showed that VSV\u0394G-GFP-MERS was replication-competent and could stably express S protein and eGFP protein. These features render it a reliable surrogate for MERS-CoV in evaluating the neutralizing antibody capacity in the unavailability of live MERS-CoV. Due to the unavailability of a large animal high-containment facility, it was not possible to conduct a camel challenge study in the current setting, but may be considered in the future. Nevertheless, our results thus demonstrated the potential of rLa-MERS-S to serve as a candidate MERS-CoV veterinary vaccine.",

No statistical difference in NDV neutral-Generation of recombinant Newcastle disease virus (NDV) expressing the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) spike (S) gene. A, schematic representation of the rLa genome with the PmeI restriction site introduced between the P and M genes, and the MERS-CoV S gene inserted at the PmeI site. B, Western blot analyses of recombinant NDV expressing MERS-CoV S protein. Lysates of BHK-21 cells infected with rLa or rLa-MERS-S were incubated with chicken serum against NDV, mouse serum against S protein, or an anti-\u03b2-actin monoclonal antibody. The anti-serum or antibody used is indicated on the right and the locations of S proteins is indicated (see arrow). C, indirect immunofluorescence staining of rLa-MERS-S, rLa-infected BHK-21 cells and non-infected BHK-21control (mock) with chicken anti-NDV serum and mouse polyclonal antibodies to the S protein of MERS-CoV and observed with a confocal laser microscope. Growth properties of recombinant viruses in embryonated eggs. rLa, rLa-MERS-S was inoculated into the allantoic cavities of 10-day-old embryonated eggs at a dose of 100 EID 50 (50% embryo infectious dose) in 0.1 mL, and the allantoic fluid of 6 eggs from each group was harvested at the indicated timepoints and pooled for EID 50 determination in eggs. The data shown were from three independent experiments and presented as the means\u00b1SD of 10 eggs for each group. Pathogenicity evaluation of the recombinant viruses in chickens and mice. A, pathogenicity assay in SPF eggs and chickens. MDT, the mean death time; ICPI, intracerebral pathogenicity index; IVPI, intravenous pathogenicity index. B, weight change in mice inoculated with recombinant and vector viruses. Groups of 10 mice were inoculated intramuscularly (i.m.) with 1\u00d710 8 EID 50 (in 100 \u03bcL) and intranasally (i.n.) with 3\u00d710 7 EID 50 (in 30 \u03bcL) of rLa (Newcastle disease virus (NDV) LaSota virus) or rLa-MERS-S (a recombinant NDV LaSota virus expressing the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) spike protein), and observed and weighed daily for 14 days. All mice survived in the duration of the experiment. Body weight changes for each group are shown as ratios of the body weight at day 0, which was set as 100.",
