            "text": "Rationale: An activated vasoconstrictive, proliferative, and fibrotic axis of the renin angiotensin system (angiotensin-converting enzyme [ACE]/angiotensin [Ang]II/AngII type 1 receptor) has been implicated in the pathophysiology of pulmonary fibrosis (PF) and pulmonary hypertension (PH). The recent discovery of a counterregulatory axis of the renin angiotensin system composed of ACE2/ Ang-(1-7)/Mas has led us to examine the role of this vasoprotective axis on such disorders. Objectives: We hypothesized that Ang-(1-7) treatment would exert protective effects against PF and PH. Methods: Lentiviral packaged Ang-(1-7) fusion gene or ACE2 cDNA was intratracheally administered into the lungs of male Sprague Dawley rats. Two weeks after gene transfer, animals received bleomycin (2.5 mg/kg). In a subsequent study, animals were administered monocrotaline (MCT, 50 mg/kg). Measurements and Main Results: In the PF study, bleomycin administration resulted in a significant increase in right ventricular systolic pressure, which was associated with the development of right ventricular hypertrophy. The lungs of these animals also exhibited excessive collagen deposition, decreased expression of ACE and ACE2, increased mRNA levels for transforming growth factor b and other proinflammatory cytokines, and increased protein levels of the AT 1 R. Overexpression of Ang-(1-7) significantly prevented all the above-mentioned pathophysiological conditions. Similar protective effects were also obtained with ACE2 overexpression. In the PH study, rats injected with MCT developed elevated right ventricular systolic pressure, right ventricular hypertrophy, right ventricular fibrosis, and pulmonary vascular remodeling, all of which were attenuated by Ang-(1-7) overexpression. Blockade of the Mas receptor abolished the beneficial effects of Ang-(1-7) against MCTinduced PH. Conclusions: Our observations demonstrate a cardiopulmonary protective role for the ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/Mas axis in the treatment of lung disorders.",

            "text": "Pulmonary fibrosis (PF) is a fatal lung disease of unknown cause. The disease is characterized by progressive scarring of the lung tissue accompanied by fibroblast proliferation, excessive accumulation of matrix proteins, and abnormal alveolar structure, all leading to a loss of lung function and, ultimately, respiratory failure (1) . Current treatments with antiinflammatory, immunosuppressive, and antifibrotic agents have not shown promising results to abate the progression of the disease or to improve the quality of life (2) . Thus, it becomes essential to better understand the disease pathophysiology and identify novel therapeutic targets/agents for the treatment of PF. There is experimental and clinical evidence to indicate that an activated pulmonary renin angiotensin system (RAS) is involved in the pathophysiology of this disease (3, 4) : (1) Polymorphism of the angiotensinogen (AGT) gene has been associated with the progression of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (5); (2) AGT has been found to be one of the most overexpressed genes in patients with PF (6); (3) angiotensin II (Ang II) has been shown to stimulate cell growth and proliferation of lung fibroblasts (7, 8) ; (4) Ang II is known to up-regulate the expression of transforming growth factor-b (TGF-b) (9), a central player in fibrogenesis; (5) Ang II-induced TGF-b generation is associated with the differentiation of fibroblast to myofibroblasts, which dramatically enhances extracellular matrix protein deposition (10); (6) Ang II is involved in lung inflammation through the generation of reactive oxygen species and the release of proinflammatory cytokines (11, 12) ; (7) Ang II has been shown to induce alveolar epithelial cell apoptosis (13) , which is believed to initiate the fibrotic process; and (8) Ang II is also involved in promoting procoagulatory effects by activating plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (14) .",

Polymor-phism in the genes encoding for components of the RAS, such as AGT (16) , angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) (16) , and the Ang II type 1 receptor (AT 1 R) (17) , have been linked to the development of PH.

            "text": "It is evident that modulation of components of the RAS appears to be a viable therapeutic strategy for the treatment of lung diseases such as PF and PH. However, direct targeting of the RAS components in these lung disorders using ACE inhibitors or AT 1 R blockers have produced mixed results in animal models and in humans (19, 20) . Nevertheless, the recent discovery of a homolog of ACE, called ACE2, and its enzymatic product angiotensin-(1-7) ([Ang- [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] ), offer an alternative pathway to regulate the intrapulmonary components of the RAS for producing beneficial effects. Ang-(1-7) is a heptapeptide that counteracts many of the detrimental effects of Ang II, including heart failure, kidney diseases, and diabetic complications (21, 22) . However, the role of Ang-(1-7) in pulmonary disorders, especially in PF and PH, has not yet been investigated. Because Ang-(1-7) is a peptide that undergoes rapid proteolytic degradation in the circulation (23), we decided to adopt a novel strategy of overexpressing this peptide locally in the lung tissue through a lentiviral-mediated gene delivery approach. Thus, in this study we propose that lentiviral-mediated pulmonary overexpression of Ang-(1-7) exerts cardiopulmonary beneficial effects against two experimental models of lung disorders: PF and PH. Some of the results of these studies have been previously reported in the form of abstracts (24) .",

Collagen deposition was significantly decreased by overexpression of ACE2 or Ang-(1-7). It has been reported that an increase in lung AT 1 R levels may considerably contribute to the fibrotic process as collagen-synthesis activity of the fibroblasts is enhanced in response to AT 1 R stimulation (8) . Lung AT 1 R was significantly increased after bleomycin administration, which was consistent with previous reports (29) . This effect of bleomycin was attenuated by pulmonary overexpression of Ang-(1-7). Down-regulation of AT 1 R by Ang-(1-7) has been reported in other tissues too (30) . However, no reduction in the lung AT 1 R protein level was observed in the ACE2 treatment group. We speculate that ACE2 overexpression may either inhibit components of the AT 1 R signaling pathway or stimulate the degradation of collagen, to bring about the beneficial antifibrotic effects. Lung protein analysis revealed decreased ACE levels in bleomycin-treated rats. Decreased pulmonary ACE activity associated with bleomycin injury has been reported in both animal and human studies (31) (32) (33) , which confirm our current findings.",

In line with these studies, we also observed increased lung mRNA levels of this profibrotic cytokine after bleomycin instillation, which was significantly reduced by overexpression of both ACE2 and Ang-(1-7). We and others have demonstrated that Ang-(1-7) and ACE2 can reduce TGF-b levels in fibroblast cell culture experiments (39, 40) . Clinically, the presence of PH secondary to fibrotic lung diseases, called cor pulmonale, indicates poor prognosis with a compromised cardiac function. In our study, we did detect pulmonary hypertension and RVH after bleomycin administration. However, treatment with Ang-(1-7) prevented the development of both PH and RVH. Not only did we find protective effects with Ang-(1-7), but overexpression of ACE2 also conferred similar beneficial effects, possibly mediated via generation of Ang-(1-7). It is conceivable that the protective effects of ACE2 and Ang- (1-7) on the heart may be secondary to the reduction in the lung fibrosis. However, it is also possible that ACE2 and Ang-(1-7) may have direct effects on the heart. We have previously reported direct protective effects of ACE2 overexpression or Ang-(1-7) treatment against heart remodeling (26, 27) . Also, we have demonstrated that lentiviral administration of ACE2 in MCT-treated mice prevented the development of pulmonary hypertension and cardiac remodeling (41) . Likewise, similar findings were observed with a synthetic activator of the ACE2 enzyme in the MCT model of PH (42) . These collective results and the results of the current PF study demonstrating a beneficial effect of ACE2 and Ang-(1-7) on pulmonary pressure encouraged us to perform a subsequent experiment to determine whether Ang-(1-7) overexpression would prevent the development of PH in the monocrotaline model.",

            "text": "Four weeks of MCT treatment resulted in significant increase in RVSP, accompanied by cardiac remodeling in terms of development of RVH and fibrosis. Overexpression of Ang-(1-7), before induction of PH resulted in prevention of the elevated pressure and attenuation of the remodeling effects on the heart. By preventing RVH and fibrosis, Ang-(1-7) offers a cardioprotective role against pathobiology of PH. Structural changes in the pulmonary vasculature, characterized by medial wall thickening of the pulmonary arterioles, is a prominent feature of human PH. Thickening of the pulmonary arterioles increase pulmonary arterial resistance contributing to the elevated pressure (43) . MCT-challenged animals exhibited marked increase in the wall thickness of pulmonary resistant vessels and overexpression of Ang-(1-7) resulted in near-normal vessel morphology. It is likely that inhibition of vascular remodeling is a direct effect of Ang-(1-7), because previous findings have demonstrated antiproliferative properties of this peptide in vascular smooth muscle cells (30, 44) . Ang-(1-7) is believed to mediate its biological effects by interacting with the G protein-coupled receptor Mas (45) . Expression of Mas has been observed in the lung tissues (46) , and this receptor can be blocked using a specific and potent antagonist, A-779. Coadministration of A-779 abolished the beneficial effects of Ang-(1-7), strongly suggesting a protective role for the Ang-(1-7)/Mas axis in PH. Increase in the expression of proinflammatory cytokines is a characteristic hallmark of PH (47) . In line with these findings, elevated lung mRNA levels of proinflammatory cytokines were observed in the MCT alone group. Overexpression of Ang-(1-7) appeared to prevent the increase in the mRNA levels of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1b, IL-6, and TNF-a) and produced an increase in the antiinflammatory cytokine (IL-10). We have recently demonstrated that XNT, an ACE2 activator, also increased lung IL-10 expression in the MCT model of PH (42) . This alteration of the inflammatory system by a peptide of the renin angiotensin system is of significance, as antiinflammatory therapy is currently being investigated for the treatment of PH. A recent report by Ito and colleagues (48) has shown that overexpression of IL-10 exerts beneficial effects against PH. One reason for the observed favorable changes in cytokine levels with Ang-(1-7) overexpression may be due to modulation of intrapulmonary RAS, which is known to be a potent regulator of cytokines and inflammation (49) . However, a direct effect of Ang-(1-7) on the immunomodulatory system may not be ruled out. Ang-(1-7) treatment prevented the MCT-induced increase in ACE mRNA levels, and significantly up-regulated ACE2 levels. It was unexpected to observe that ACE2 expression was increased by the overexpression of Ang-(1-7), although a similar increase in ACE2 expression was also observed with XNT treatment (42) . Also, cardiac-specific overexpression of Ang-(1-7) resulted in increased ACE2 levels in the heart (unpublished data). It is purely speculative that a positive feedback mechanism may be responsible for this observed phenomenon.",

Similarly, studies by Li and colleagues (34) showed that ACE2 is protective but is down-regulated in experimental and human lung fibrosis. Also, studies from our laboratory have demonstrated that overexpression of ACE2 (41) or its activation (42) prevented the development of PH and related cardiac pathophysiologies. The present study extends the findings of our earlier experiments and suggests that the beneficial effects of ACE2 overexpression/activation are most likely mediated via generation of the Ang-(1-7) peptide, which in turn stimulates the Mas receptor to bring about protection. Taken together, previous and the current studies indicate that targeting of the pulmonary ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/Mas axis could provide novel therapeutic strategy in the treatment of lung diseases, particularly involving pulmonary fibrosis and pulmonary hypertension. Because some of the findings suggest that ACE2 and Ang-(1-7) mediate their protective effects by different pathways, it appears that most effective therapeutic effect may be accomplished with a dual treatment regimen.",

Clinical trials of Ang-(1-7) are currently underway for treating cancer patients (52) , so the use of Ang-(1-7) as a new therapy for pulmonary diseases such as lung fibrosis/hypertension might be plausible. The medical use of bleomycin as a tumor suppressant is limited due to induction of PF. Thus, it is possible to have a combination therapy with Ang-(1-7) to enhance the therapeutic efficacy of bleomycin by preventing the pulmonary toxicity.",
