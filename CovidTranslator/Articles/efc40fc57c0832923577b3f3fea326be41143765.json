However, the underlying mechanism of GGD against IAV infection remains unclear. In this study, we found that GGD had moderate anti-IAV activity in vitro. GGD was more effective when given before the viral infection and targeted the viral attachment and replication stages rather than the internalization stage. In vivo, GGD treatment reduced the virus titers of lung tissue significantly and improved the survival rate, lung index, and pulmonary histopathological changes in H1N1-infected mice. We observed the changes in several key immuno-related indexes in GGD administrated H1N1-infected mice with anti-IAV drug oseltamivir phosphate as the control. GGD treatment decreased the expression of TNF-\u03b1 and improved Th1/Th2 immune balance to reduce the excessive immune response in H1N1-infected mice. Besides, the expression of the toll-like receptor 7 signaling pathway in H1N1-infected mice decreased after GGD treatment. Our results showed that GGD has anti-IAV activity and can modulate the immune system to relieve lung inflammation.",

The activity of GGD against H1N1 in MDCK cells was dose-dependent and time-dependent (Fig. 2c) . GGD was more effective when it was given before viral infection. The IC 50 values were 1.42 mg\uf0d7mL -1 (4 h before), 1.58 mg\uf0d7mL -1 (2 h before), and 4.96 mg\uf0d7mL -1 (2 h after). No noticeable differ-ence was observed between 4 h before infection and 2 h before infection, which suggested that GGD might interfere with the attachment or internalization of the virus. A subsequent attachment assay confirmed this hypothesis. GGD inhibited viral attachment in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2d) with an IC 50 of 2.59 mg\uf0d7mL -1 . However, GGD did not affect viral internalization (Fig. 2e) . Viral genome copies in the supernatants were analyzed by quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) to determine whether GGD affected the later stage of viral biosynthesis. At 10 h post-infection, the number of viral genome copies in the GGD treatment group was 5-fold lower than that in the model group (Fig. 2f) .",

Compared with the model group, the expression of IL-1\u03b1, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1 in lung tissue was decreased significantly after treatment with GGD and OP. However, compared with the OP group, the GGD group exhibited a unique immunomodulatory effect. The level of TNF-\u03b1 in lung tissue after treatment with GGD was lower than that in the OP group. Because TNF-\u03b1 is the main cytokine that causes acute lung injury [30] , we propose that the decreased expression of TNF-\u03b1 in the GGD group helped to relieve inflammatory injury in IAV-infected mice. (e-ii) Differences in the lung tissue of the model group, such as narrowed alveolar space (black arrow), thickened alveolar wall, lung congestion (red arrow), and infiltration of inflammatory cells (green arrow). The degree of lung lesions is reduced greatly in treated groups. Alveolar morphology following GGD (e-iii) and OP (e-iv) treatment is normal.

In healthy individuals, the Th1/Th2 cell ratio maintains a dynamic balance. The Th1/Th2 imbalance is related to the induction of inflammation and the occurrence of various immune diseases [32] . Our study shows that the Th1/Th2 cell ratio was skewed toward Th1 after infection. Although cell-mediated anti-infective immune responses are essential in the clearance of the influenza virus [8, 33] , Th1 cytokines, such as IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1, also mediate inflammatory damage in the early stage of influenza [34] . IFN-\u03b3 and IL-4 are a pair of mutually inhibitory cytokines that indirectly reflect the degree of the Th1 and Th2 immune responses. The immunomodulation function of GGD can be inferred by comparing the changes in IFN-\u03b3 and IL-4 expression in the GGD and OP groups. Compared with the OP group, the level of IFN-\u03b3 in lung tissue and the CD4+IFN-\u03b3+/ CD4+IL-4+ ratio in the peripheral lymphocytes of the GGD group were closer to those of the control group. Thus, we believe that GGD regulates the immune system to maintain the Th1/Th2 balance, avoiding the over-activation of inflammation.",

The antiviral pathways mediated by the TLR7 signaling pathway may be TLR7-MyD88-TRAF6-NF-\u03baB and TLR7-MyD88-TRAF6-IRF7 [39] . However, the TLR7 signaling pathway also plays an essential role in the development of acute lung injury induced by the influenza virus [40] . The appropriate activation of the TLR7 signaling pathway is necessary for combating the infection.
