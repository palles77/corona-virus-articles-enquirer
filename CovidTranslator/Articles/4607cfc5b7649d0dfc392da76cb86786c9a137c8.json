            "text": "Although Sasa quelpaertensis Nakai, a dwarf bamboo, is known to exert a variety of beneficial effects on health, its antiviral effect remains to be elucidated. Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is one of the most devastating viral pathogens of swine and has a substantial economic impact on the global pork industry. Therefore, the present study was conducted to determine whether Sasa quelpaertensis Nakai extract (SQE) inhibits PRRSV infection in cultured porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs). Our results demonstrated that SQE treatment suppressed the replication of PRRSV in a dose-dependent manner. The antiviral activity of SQE on PRRSV replication was found to be primarily exerted at early times postinfection. Treatment with SQE resulted in marked reduction of viral genomic and subgenomic RNA synthesis, viral protein expression, and progeny virus production. Notably, pro-inflammatory cytokine production in PAM cells infected with PRRSV was shown to be modulated in the presence of SQE. Taken together, our data indicate that SQE has potential as a therapeutic agent against PRRSV.",

            "text": "Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), a pathogenic macrophage-tropic arterivirus of pigs, is the etiological agent of acute respiratory illness in young piglets and reproductive failure in pregnant sows [2] . PRRSV is a small enveloped single-stranded positivesense RNA virus that belongs to the family Arteriviridae of the order Nidovirales [9, 27, 33] . The PRRSV genome contains two large open reading frames (ORFs), 1a and 1b, which comprise the 5 0 two-thirds of the viral genome and encode non-structural proteins (nsps). The remaining ORFs located in the 3 0 -terminal region code for structural proteins [22, 32] . The initial translation of ORF1a and ORF1b yields the 1a and lab replicase polyproteins, respectively, which are then proteolytically processed into at least 16 functional nsps, including viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) [7, 12, 13, 36] . The RdRpcontaining replication complex mediates genomic RNA replication and subgenomic (sg) mRNA transcription, eventually generating a nested set of 3 0 -coterminal sg mRNAs that are individually translated to produce structural proteins [22, 32] .",

            "text": "PRRSV preferentially replicates in porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs) and can establish persistent infection in lymphoid tissues of infected pigs that lasts for several months [3, 10, 11, 37] . As a result, PRRSV infection suppresses normal macrophage functions and immune responses, which may render pigs susceptible to secondary bacterial or viral infections, leading to more-severe disease than caused by either agent alone [4, 14, 15, 38] . Furthermore, a highly pathogenic PRRSV infection, which is characterized by high fever and high mortality in pigs of all ages, has recently emerged in China and other Asian countries and severely affected local pig husbandries [ 34] . Although both killed and modified live vaccines against PRRSV have been developed to control the disease and are used in the global market, most commercial vaccines have problems related to their efficacy and safety. Despite the availability of the vaccine, PRRSV has still continued to plague most pork-producing nations, causing enormous financial losses for the swine industry worldwide [16, 28] . Thus, the lack of effective vaccines increases the need for new compounds against PRRSV infection. Sasa quelpaertensis Nakai, known as Jeju-Joritdae, is a type of bamboo grass that is widely distributed on Mt. Halla on Jeju Island in South Korea. Its leaf extract possesses a number of health-promoting activities, including anti-ulcerogenic, anti-obesity, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer properties [17-19, 29, 35] . To date, there are still no reports on the effectiveness of Sasa quelpaertensis Nakai extract (SQE) against viral infections in human or veterinary subjects. In the present study, therefore, we tried to investigate the antiviral activity of SQE and its mechanism of action in target cells upon PRRSV infection. Treatment of target cells with SQE significantly impaired PRRSV replication. Further experiments revealed that SQE suppresses post-entry steps in the replication cycle of PRRSV, including viral genomic and sg RNA synthesis, viral protein expression, and virus production. The presence of SQE notably altered expression of cytokine genes in PRRSV-infected PAM cells, suggesting that SQE activity is involved in the modulation of inflammatory responses during viral infection. Collectively, our results suggest that SQE may be an excellent therapeutic option for PRRSV infection.",

PAM-KNU cells were pretreated with SQE at concentrations of 0.1 to 5 mg/ml or with DW as a vehicle control for 1 h prior to infection, and SQE was present during the entire period of infection. Virus production was initially measured by monitoring the cytopathic effect (CPE) after infection and confirmed by immunofluorescence at 48 hpi using an N-protein-specific MAb (Fig. 1) . In vehicle-treated control cells, visible CPE appeared at 24 hpi and became prominent by 48 hpi, and N-specific staining was clearly evident in many cell clusters, indicating infection and the spread of the virus to neighboring cells. In contrast, SQE had an obvious inhibitory effect on virus propagation. As shown in Fig. 1A and B, SQE significantly decreased virus-induced CPE and viral gene expression at concentrations of *1 mg/ml. N protein staining revealed that the number of cells expressing viral antigen decreased during SQE treatment, resulting in a maximum of *80 % inhibition at a concentration of 5 mg/ ml ( Fig. 1A and B) . Furthermore, the effective dose for inhibiting PRRSV infection by 50 % (ED 50 ) was determined to be about 3.05 mg/ml.

The serially diluted infected cells were subsequently subjected to an infectious center assay on uninfected PAM-KNU cell monolayers, and virus titers were measured 2 days later by IFA.

Early viral translation produces replicase polyproteins that are posttranslationally cleaved into nsps by viral or cellular proteinases. Subsequently, the replicase proteins mediate de novo synthesis of viral RNA, including genomic RNA replication and sg mRNA transcription. The structural proteins of PRRSV are translated later from their respective sg mRNA transcripts. Thus, to investigate inhibitory effects of SQE on post-entry steps of the PRRSV life cycle, we first investigated whether viral protein translation was affected by SQE. To accomplish this, PAM-KNU cells were treated with SQE for 1 h prior to infection, and the drug was allowed to remain during infection and subsequent incubation. The expression level of the PRRSV N protein in the presence or absence of SQE was evaluated at 48 hpi by western blot analysis. The production of the PRRSV N protein was drastically diminished during SQE treatment (Fig. 4) . Densitometric analysis of the western blot revealed that the intracellular expression of the viral protein was reduced by SQE treatment, with a maximum of about 90 % inhibition at a concentration of 5 mg/ml (Fig. 4) . This marked reduction was probably not the result of a nonspecific decrease in translation, since Ponceau S staining indirectly indicated that the overall expression levels of cellular proteins remained similar following treatment (data not shown). Taken together, these results demonstrated the inhibitory effects of SQE specifically against viral protein expression during PRRSV replication.",

Thus, it is conceivable that the impaired viral protein expression was caused by suppression of viral RNA synthesis. Since PRRSV infection produces two RNA entities, genomic and subgenomic, we investigated whether SQE specifically affects genome replication and sg mRNA transcription. To answer this question, the relative levels of genomic RNA and sg mRNA were measured by quantitative real-time strand-specific RT-PCR in the presence or absence of SQE upon PRRSV infection. As shown in Fig. 5 , SQE treatment resulted in a maximal reduction in the synthesis of PRRSV genomic RNA and sg mRNA of 90 % and 80 %, respectively, at a concentration of 5 mg/ ml, when compared with untreated infected cells. The decrease in viral RNA levels after the addition of SQE was not due to nonspecific inhibition of transcription, as the mRNA level of the internal b-actin control remained unchanged in all samples (Fig. 5C ). The impairment of PRRSV transcription in the presence of SQE was confirmed by northern blot analysis (Fig. 6 ). In the absence of SQE, PRRSV RNA synthesis was distinctly observed (lane 2). A [50 % reduction of RNA-synthesizing activity occurred in the presence of 1 mg of SQE per ml (lane 3), while viral RNA synthesis was almost completely abolished in the presence of 5 mg of SQE per ml (lane 4).

            "text": "PRRSV is not only a devastating viral pathogen in the pig population, but it can also be used as an animal virus model to study nidoviruses that are important in human and veterinary medicine. Despite tremendous efforts to control disease caused by this virus, PRRSV infection has continuously plagued pig-producing countries and has had a tremendous economic impact on the global swine industry. This is partially due to the absence of efficient vaccines capable of conferring full protection against heterologous viral infection as well as antiviral agents for treating PRRSV. Although SQE is widely known to possess several health-promoting properties [17, 18] , its antiviral activity and mode of action on DNA and RNA viruses are currently unknown. The present study demonstrated that SQE exerts an adequate antiviral effect against PRRSV in vitro, as determined by the ED 50 for viral replication (antiviral activity) of approximately 3.05 mg/ml. Treatment of cells with SQE resulted in significant inhibition of post-entry steps during the replication of PRRSV, as demonstrated by reduced progeny production, diminished viral protein expression, and reduced synthesis of genomic RNA and sg mRNA. Furthermore, a growth kinetics experiment indicated an approximately 4-log reduction in the titer of PRRSV in the presence of SQE at 24 h after infection, and the titer continued to remain at a similar level 48 h after infection. Taken together, our data indicate that SQE potently elicits antiviral activity against PRRSV in natural target cells. Compounds from medicinal plants or natural sources are of interest for their potential to inhibit a variety of viral infectious diseases and cancer. Bamboo grasses have been used as traditional medicines throughout Asia, and modern studies have reported their beneficial health effects. Sasa quelpaertensis Nakai is among these and is well known as Jeju-Joritdae in South Korea. SQE, its leaf extract, has a number of biological properties, including anticancer and anti-inflammatory effects. Since PRRSV infection modulates inflammatory cytokine expression in PAM cells, the antiviral activity of SQE may result predominantly from its anti-inflammatory effect. To elucidate potential mechanism(s) responsible for the antiviral effect of SQE on PRRSV, we first tested whether SQE affects the induction of cytokine genes by PRRSV in immortalized PAM cells. The present study provided evidence that various cytokines induced in PRRSV-infected cells are transcriptionally modulated in the presence of SQE. Our results indicate that treatment with SQE robustly reduced infection-induced expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-1a, IL-6, IL-8, IL-15, and TNF-a. In contrast, SQE resulted in a synergic elevation in gene expression levels of chemokines. Notably, the induction of IRFs, TLRs, and genes involved in the antiviral immune response was specifically enhanced in SQE-treated virus-infected cells. PRRSV is known to possess the ability to escape host defense mechanisms by interfering with innate immune responses to favor its survival and spread in the natural host. Thus, SQE appears to disrupt one of the pivotal viral mechanisms of immune evasion by modifying the expression of immune-related genes to facilitate virus infection, resulting in the suppression of PRRSV replication. However, we were unable to identify which chemical constituent(s) in SQE is responsible for the regulation of immune-response gene expression that leads to its antiviral activity upon PRRSV infection. Although p-coumaric acid is known to be a major component of SQE (23.71 mg/g) and has diverse pharmacological properties, including antimicrobial, anticancer, and antiulcer activities [19, 20] , this chemical was incapable of significantly impairing the replication of PRRSV, even at the highest noncytotoxic concentration of 100 lM (Fig. A1) . It is conceivable that other minor constituents such as tricin, with a content in SQE of 0.028 mg/g, may possess the biological characteristics that give SQE its antiviral activity. Indeed, recent studies have demonstrated inhibitory effects of synthesized tricin or its derivative on viral infections [1, 39] . In addition to PRRSV, our experiment was further extended to other nidoviruses to confirm the antiviral activity of SQE. Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is one of pathogenic coronaviruses of pigs. Like PRRSV, it belongs to the order Nidovirales, whose members all have a similar genome organization and replication strategy. Thus, we attempted to assess whether SQE also affects PEDV infection but found that it had no significant inhibitory effect on PEDV infection in vitro (Fig. A2 ). This observation might be explained by the tropism of each virus, since PRRSV is a porcine macrophage-tropic arterivirus causing acute respiratory illness, whereas PEDV is a pathogenic enterocytetropic coronavirus of swine causing acute enteritis and watery diarrhea. Although SQE failed to block PEDV infection, it still has potential as an antiviral agent against other coronaviruses of human and livestock, for which the modulation of immune-response cytokine gene production in the natural host is related to their replication.",

(A) PAM-KNU cells were incubated with various concentrations of SQE for 24 h prior to the MTT assay, and cytotoxicity of SQE was determined by the MTT assay. (B) PAM-KNU cells were preincubated with SQE at the indicated concentrations for 1 h prior to infection and were mock infected or infected with PRRSV at an MOI of 1. The virus-infected cells were then maintained for another 48 h in the presence of vehicle or SQE. Virus-specific CPEs were observed daily and were photographed at 48 hpi using an inverted microscope at a magnification of 1009 (first row of panels). For immunostaining, infected cells were fixed at 48 hpi and incubated with an MAb against the N protein of PRRSV, followed by Alexa Green-conjugated goat antimouse secondary antibody (second row of panels). The cells were then counterstained with DAPI (third row of panels) and examined using a fluorescent microscope at 2009 magnification. (C) Production of virus in the presence of SQE was measured by counting the cells expressing N proteins, using IFA. Five fields at 2009 magnification were counted for each condition, and the total number of cells per field as determined by DAPI staining was similar in all fields.
