            "text": "The pathogenesis of Parker's Rat Coronavirus (PRCV) was studied in axenie CD rats. Three to four 9 to 10 week old rats were euthanized daily for eight days after intranasal inoculation. Rats remained free of clinical disease. Virus was recovered from the nasopharynx and trachea after twenty-four hours and from the lung by day three but was not detected in respiratory tract, after seven days. Viral antigen was detected by indirect immunofluoresecnce in the mueosal epithelium of upper respiratory tract and in pulmonary alveolar septae from day two to six postinoculation. Acute rhinitis developed by day two and was associated with mild focal necrosis of respiratory mucosal epithelium. Mild nonsuppurative tracheitis and multifocal interstitial pneumonia appeared by day five and persisted through day eight. Dacryoadeaitis did not occur, sialoadenitis was detected in only three rats and virus was recovered from only one submaxillary salivary gland. This experiment indicates that PRCV can be a primary pathogen for the respiratory system of adult rats. In contrast to sialodacryoadenitis (SDA) virus the tropism of PRCV for salivary and lacrimal glands is low. 23*",

SDAV causes severe self-limiting sialodacryoadenitis in naturally-infected or experimentallyinoculated adult rats (4, 5) and recent evidence indicates that SDAV is associated with naturally-occurring keratoeonjunetivitis in rats (6) . PRCV was originally isolated from the lungs of rats with a high incidence of complement-fixing (CF) 34:6 P.N. BHA~'T and R. 0. JACOB\u00a5: antibody to mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) (7) . In contrast to SDAV, natural infection with PRCV is reportedly asymptomatic in adults, but experimentallyinoculated neonates developed lethal interstitial pneumonia (7) . This report described experimental PRCV infection of adult CD rats. Results indicate that PRCV is pathogenic for the respiratory system.",

Second, the tissue tropism of PI~CV differed from SDAV. Both viruses replicated in the respiratory tract and caused rhinotraeheitis but PRCV also caused mild pneumonia whereas SDAV did not. Conversely, PRCV replicated poorly in salivary and lacrimal glands and only rarely produced lesions, whereas SDAV was severely pathogenic for these glands. Nevertheless, sialoadenitis produced by PRCV, although mild when it occurred, was morphologically compatible with SDAV-induced lesions. The potential for Pl~CV-induced sialoadenitis may be mitigated by factors such as strain, age and sex of the host. Additional experiments should examine the effects these variables ha,~e on eoronavirus infections of rats. This study also underscores the usefulness of documenting and correlating virological and morphological data to assess the pathogenetie significance of infections which are clinically silent and which are usually detected only by serological monitoring.",
