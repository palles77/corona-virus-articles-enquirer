In this study, we developed the first quantitative real-time nucleic acid sequence-based amplification assay with an internal control using molecular beacon probes for selective and sensitive detection of human rhinovirus serotypes. We described a simple method to accurately quantify RNA target by computing the time to positivity (TTP) values for HRV RNA. Quantification capacity was assessed by plotting these TTP values against the starting number of target molecules. By using this simple method, we have significantly increased the diagnostic accuracy, precision, and trueness of real-time NASBA assay. Specificity of the method was verified in both in silico and experimental studies. Moreover, for assessment of clinical reactivity of the assay, NASBA has been validated on bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) specimens. Our quantitative NASBA assay was found to be very specific, accurate, and precise with high repeatability and reproducibility.",

            "text": "Human rhinoviruses (HRVs) are the most frequent cause of acute upper respiratory tract infections in humans and are usually responsible for 30-50% of cases of common cold [1] [2] [3] . However, they may also be associated with moresevere lower respiratory tract infections. Rhinoviruses have been isolated from cases of cystic fibrosis, otitis media, sinusitis, asthma, exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and pneumonia, especially in children, in the elderly, and in immunocompromised patients [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] . Evidence demonstrating that HRV disease is not exclusively limited to the upper airways and may cause lower respiratory complications, together with the frequency of HRV infections and the increasing number of immunocompromised patients underline the need for rapid and accurate diagnosis of HRV infections. Two nucleic acid amplification techniques (NAATs) are actually available for the detection of HRV: reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) [15, 16] , and nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (NASBA) [17, 18] . NASBA has proven to be highly sensitive, specific, and more rapid than RT-PCR technique [19, 20] . Currently, only qualitative NASBA kits for the detection of HRV are commercially available (registered trademarks owned of bioM\u00e9rieux, Marcy L'Etoile, France), while there are no quantitative NASBA kits. Some quantitative molecular beacon real-time NAS-BA assays have been described in the literature, mainly for the identification of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), respiratory syncytial virus A and B, influenza A virus (H1N1), Trypanosoma brucei, Aspergillus fumigatus, Plasmodium species, and Listeria monocytogenes [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] . However, these real-time NASBA assays use mathematical models for the analysis of results that requires employing of specific complex software calibrated to each target [30] . Other quantitative NASBA assays, instead, compute the ratio of the time to positivity (TTP) values for both the target RNA and internal control by using standard curves with a correlation coefficient less than 0.99 (R 2 \\ 0.99), index of an insensitive assay [19, 24, 26] .",

The HRV beacon was labeled with FAM at its 5 0 -end and quencher DABCYL at its 3 0 -end, while the IC beacon contained a ROX at its 5 0 -end and a DABCYL quencher at the 3 0 -end. The stability and predicted structure of the beacons were analyzed by using the European MFOLD server (http://frontend. bioinfo.rpi.edu/applications/mfold/cgi-bin/dna-form1.cgi). Real-time NASBA reaction was performed on a NucliSens EasyQ analyzer (BioM\u00e9rieux) using the NucliSENS EasyQ Basic Kit Version 2 (bioM\u00e9rieux, Lyon, France) for the amplification according to the manufacturer's manual. To obtain the best amplification efficiency, conditions for the real-time NASBA assay were optimized until the best primers, beacons, and KCl concentrations were determined. Titrations of IC RNA (between 10 and 10 6 copies) and HRV RNA were performed to determine the optimal amount of internal control to generate the greatest dynamic range for the assay without interference with the detection of HRV RNA (data not shown). As a result, each reaction was run with the addition of 10 5 copies of the IC RNA.

To improve clinical management of such patients, it is important to obtain an accurate diagnosis and to identify the causative agent early in infection to ensure appropriate treatment. In this study, we developed the first quantitative NASBA assay for the detection of HRV serotypes. By combining NASBA amplification with molecular beacon probes, this assay becomes a real-time analysis tool that offers faster results than conventional RT-PCR technique. Since NASBA amplification involves three separate enzymes each with their own kinetic parameters, variability in every measurement is inevitable [19] . Weusten et al. [30] were the first to describe a mathematical model for RNA amplification of both target and internal calibrator RNA in a molecular beacon-based NASBA reaction to normalize enzyme efficiency differences between reactions. However, the description of this model did not include all of the essential parameters needed to operate the model. Consequently, analysis using this model requires software calibrated to each target and is commercially available for only a few specific targets. Here, we describe an alternative method for normalizing NASBA data by using a simple TPP calculation in the presence of an internal control that reduces the variability between replicates and increases the precision, trueness, and accuracy for predicting unknown concentrations of HRV RNA. It has been shown that tube to tube variation within NASBA can be normalized with the addition of an internal control in each reaction [34, 35] .",
