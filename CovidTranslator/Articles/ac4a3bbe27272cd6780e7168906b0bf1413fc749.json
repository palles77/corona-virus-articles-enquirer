To clarify the DNA ligands that 39 activate cGAS activity, we confirmed that cGAS binds mitochondrial DNA in the 40 cytosol of both uninfected and infected cells; however, the amount of 41 cGAS-associated mitochondrial DNA did not change in response to virus infection. 42 Rather, a variety of pre-existing cytosolic DNAs, including mitochondrial DNA and 43 endogenous cDNAs, may serve as stimuli for basal cGAS activation. Importantly, 44 cGAS knockout and reconstitution experiments demonstrated that cGAS drives 45 low-level ISG expression at steady state. We propose that cGAS-STING restricts 46 RNA viruses by promoting a preparatory immune activation state within cells, likely 47 primed by endogenous cellular DNA ligands. 48 . Importance 49 Many medically important RNA viruses are restricted by the cGAS-STING 50 DNA-sensing pathway of innate immune activation. Since these viruses replicate 51 without DNA intermediates, it is unclear what DNA ligand(s) are responsible for 52 triggering this pathway. We show here that cGAS's DNA binding and signaling 53 activities are required for RNA virus restriction, similar to the mechanisms by which it 54 restricts DNA viruses.

For 63 mammalian cells, viral nucleic acids are detected by distinct PRRs, triggering 64 interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) expression to set up an antiviral state. During RNA 65 virus infections, uncapped and double-stranded RNAs are detected in the cytosol by 66 the PRRs retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) and related RIG-I-like receptors 67 (RLRs). However, the recent discovery of the cGAS-STING cytosolic DNA sensing 68 pathway, and the observation that it can also restrict RNA viruses (2), reveals a need 69 to further investigate the mechanisms of nucleic acid sensing during RNA virus 70 infection. 71 The stimulator of interferon genes (STING) is an endoplasmic reticulum-and 72 mitochondrial-bound protein that spontaneously activates ISG expression when 73 overexpressed (2). Although STING is involved in DNA sensing, STING -/mice and 74 mouse endothelial fibroblasts (MEFs) are more permissive for vesicular stomatitis 75 virus (VSV), a negative-stand RNA virus (2, 3).

At present, the prevailing 99 hypothesis is that RNA viruses induce release of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) into 100 the cytosol, thereby activating innate immune responses (7, (33) (34) (35) (36) . However, it is 101 unclear whether mitochondrial damage is a conserved feature of RNA virus 102 infection, nor is it clear that cGAS-STING activation follows the same pathway for 103 both RNA and DNA viruses. 104 In this study, we investigated whether the DNA binding and cGAMP synthesis 105 activities of human cGAS (hcGAS) are required for RNA virus restriction. While both 106 activities were required, the amount of cGAMP produced during virus infection was 107 too low to detect. We also confirmed that hcGAS binds mtDNA in both uninfected 108 and infected cells but did not observe increased cytosolic or cGAS-associated 109 mtDNA in response to RNA virus infection. We found that cGAS stimulated 110 smoldering, low-level innate immune activation, most likely in response to 111 endogenous DNA ligands, suggesting that cGAS-STING can passively restrict 112 incoming RNA viruses. 113 .

Based on the above 258 results, we hypothesized that cGAS may serve to program baseline levels of innate 259 immune activation rather than strictly in response to RNA virus infection. To address 260 this, we analyzed ISRE-driven luciferase expression in uninfected THP-1 cells To examine whether cGAS drives basal levels of innate immune activation in 279 vivo, we examined ISG expression in vaginal tissue from uninfected WT B6J mice or 280 in mice defective for several innate immunity pathways. As shown in Fig. 7 Although cGAS was previously reported to restrict RNA viruses (50), it has been 301 widely assumedthough unproventhat this restriction depends on cGAS's DNA 302 binding and cGAMP synthase activities. Here, we used genetic knockout and 303 transgenic replacement to determine that both DNA binding and cGAMP synthase 304 activities are essential for cGAS-mediated restriction of RNA viruses. One caveat to 305 this approach is that gene knockout can have far-reaching network-level effects on 306 transcription, which are just beginning to be unearthed (51). A second caveat is that 307 reconstituted cGAS was slightly overexpressed in THP-1 cells, which, at least for WT 308 cGAS, can induce ISG expression (50, 52) and may have exaggerated the 309 response. Nevertheless, our results in THP-1 cells were consistent with results 310 obtained from MEFs (Figure 3 ), which did not overexpress cGAS.

These experiments suggested that WT hcGAS-HA3x significantly enhances 263 baseline ISG induction compared to the parental cGAS KO line and hcGAS mutants. 264 Further experiments showed that WT hcGAS-HA3x also stimulated greater 265 ISRE-driven luciferase production during infection of THP-1 cells with VSV-GFP and 266 SINV-GFP (Figures 6B, C). It should be noted that VSV-GFP ISG levels were not 267 appreciably different from the control, likely due to the transcriptional repression 268 capability of the M protein (43, 44). 269 To confirm our ISRE-luciferase findings, we used RT-qPCR to quantify ISG 270 transcripts known to be induced by the cGAS-STING DNA sensing pathway (Figures 271 6D-6G). These results show that cGAS KO significantly reduced basal expression of 272 Mx1 and CXCL10 in uninfected cells, but not of IFIT1, which was not expressed 273 basally. Importantly, cells reconstituted with WT hcGAS-HA3x expressed 274 significantly higher levels of IFIT1 and CXCL10 mRNA, while cells expressing 275 inactive hcGAS-3xHA mutants did not.

These findings, however, do highlight the constant 358 synthesis and turnover of cDNAs within the mammalian cytosol. Consistent with this, 359 deficiencies in the TREX1 nuclease lead to cytosolic accumulation of DNA, including 360 retroelement cDNAs, causing chronic cGAS stimulation and autoimmunity in the 361 form of Aicardi-Gouti\u00e8res syndrome (4, 56, 57). 362 Given that cGAS may be continuously stimulated by endogenous DNA ligands, 363 and that candidate DNA ligands were unchanged during VSV infection, we 364 examined whether cGAS contributes to a pre-existing baseline of innate immune 365 activation. Indeed, low level cGAS-dependent ISG expression was observed even in 366 the absence of viral infection and was significantly decreased in cGAS KO cells, 367 consistent with prior examples of the cGAS-STING pathway altering ISG baseline 368expression(2, 50, 58, 59). These results support the hypothesis that cGAS 369 contributes to RNA virus restriction by establishing smoldering, baseline-levels of 370 constitutive innate immune activation.

Size-selected libraries 594(350-to 450-bp) were excised from LMP agarose, purified with a Gel Extraction Kit 595 (Qiagen), re-amplified by PCR for 18 cycles, then purified. Triplicate libraries were 596 sequenced on a HiSeq4000 (Illumina) by the Yale Center for Genome Analysis with 597 a 150-bp paired-end protocol, 100 million reads/sample. 598Software and Statistics. Unless otherwise noted, statistical significance was 599 estimated by using the Student's t-test with Holm-Sidak correction for multiple 600 comparisons. Standard p-value indicators were used throughout the manuscript: * 601 indicates p<0.05; ** indicates p<0.01; *** indicates p<0.001; and **** indicates 602 p<0.0001. Data were graphed by using Graphpad Prism software (version 7.0a). 603Pixel densities were analyzed in ImageJ2 (74) and images were prepared for 604 presentation with Photoshop and Illustrator CS4 (Adobe). Next-generation 605 sequencing results were mapped to the mm10 mouse genome by using the 606 Burrows-Wheeler aligner (BWA) (75) and TopHat(76)to look for raw and gapped 607 alignment, respectively. Alignments were assessed for content of genomic DNA and 608 mtDNA with the integrated genome browser software (77). Ding Q, Gaska JM, Douam F, Wei L, Kim D, Balev M, Heller B, Ploss A. 648 2018.

In contrast, MAVS had little effect on 286Altogether, these results suggest that cGAS primes cells to express smoldering 288 levels of ISG expression and that the DNA binding and catalytic activity are integral 289While the RLR-MAVS and cGAS-STING pathways are important, respectively, 293 for restricting RNA and DNA virus infections, there is considerable crosstalk and 294 redundancy between these two pathways. For instance, mammalian RNA 295 polymerase III can transcribe A-T-rich DNA in the cytosol, producing uncapped 296RNAs that trigger 46). In addition, STING can physically associate with 297 RIG-I and MAVS and may act as a cofactor in RNA sensing (47-49). More recently, 298 STING has been shown to inhibit RNA virus replication, independent of ISG 299",
