Aedes aegypti and Ae. albopictus are the 2 main vectors that transmit this disease (1) . The fi rst reported chikungunya outbreak occurred in Tanganyika (now Tanzania) in 1952-1953 (2) . The word chikungunya is derived from the Makonde language in southeastern Tanzania and means \"bent down or become contorted,\" which indicates the classic posture the patient adopts because of severe joint pain. Symptoms of chikungunya include sudden onset of fever, severe arthralgia, and maculopapular rash. A specifi c symptom is severe incapacitating arthralgia, often persistent, which can result in long-lasting disability (3) .",

Excess deaths for each month in 2006 were the difference between actual observed number of deaths and expected number of deaths. Average monthly mortality rates for 2002-2005 were then compared with the mortality rate for 2006 (epidemic year).",

Our epidemiologic evidence shows that the epidemic is the most plausible explanation for the large increase in deaths in Ahmedabad in August-November 2006.

Similar data from other cities and areas affected by the chikungunya epidemic may help establish the link between chikungunya and excess deaths.",

However, this was a problem in years before the epidemic (2002) (2003) (2004) (2005) as well. A review of deaths registered in rural areas outside the city limits of Ahmedabad showed no major decrease during the epidemic months of 2006 over previous years.

The government of India has declared repeatedly in the parliament that \"there are no deaths directly attributable to Chikungunya\" in India (6) . Although 10 deaths caused by chikungunya were reported by the medical offi cer of health in Ahmebadad, the website of the government of India continues to report \"zero deaths\" (5) . Further investigations on the cause of excess deaths are urgently needed to conclusively establish that chikungunya was the cause of excess deaths in Ahmedabad. Given the possible association of deaths with the chikungunya fever epidemic in Ahmedabad, public health authorities should investigate such epidemics in other countries. These investigations will help determine whether the virus has increased in virulence, which may also pose a greater threat outside the Indian Ocean region. Such studies would help detect and control similar epidemics and help governments to provide adequate warnings to travelers to chikungunya-endemic countries.",

The highest number of chikungunya cases was also reported in August and September. The city had \u22482,944 additional deaths during August-November 2006. Epidemiologic evidence shows that the increase in deaths in Ahmedabad was largely attributable to the chikungunya epidemic. Given poor reporting of deaths, an unexplained cause of death cannot be ruled out. Mortality rate data for Ahmedabad are consistent with observations of other researchers that the virus may have mutated and become more dangerous than reported (8) . Public health authorities must investigate recent epidemics. Otherwise, developing countries may not be able to detect and combat severe future epidemics of other reemerging diseases such as avian infl uenza and severe acute respiratory syndrome. If our fi ndings are validated by studies in other regions of India and elsewhere, it would assist the international health community to be better prepared in dealing with future epidemics of emerging infectious diseases and reduce associated deaths.
