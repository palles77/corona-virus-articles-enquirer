Multiple logistic regression analyses were used to calculate odds ratios (with 95% confidence intervals) to compare Finns with the Dutch for various levels of perceptions and behaviors. Results Adjusted for age, education, and income, Finns were more likely to be knowledgeable and worried about SARS as well as to have low perceived comparative SARS risk and poor personal efficacy beliefs about preventing SARS. Finns were also more likely than the Dutch to have high confidence in physicians on SARS issues but less likely to have received information from the Internet and have confidence in Internet information.",

Although the outbreak was contained relatively quickly, SARS spread from China and other regions in Asia, reaching 29 countries altogether and causing over 8,400 cases of infection resulting in more than 900 deaths [1] . The Netherlands, with a population of 16.2 million, neither reported nor confirmed probable cases of SARS. In Finland, with 5.3 million, two people were initially treated as probable SARS cases, but neither was finally classified as such according to the WHO criteria [1, 2] . These two candidates for probable SARS cases, and especially the death from SARS of a Finnish citizen in Asia, attracted intense media attention in Finland. Effective infectious disease management and preparedness require international cooperation. At the same time, it is also important to understand local realities such as lay perceptions, immediate reactions and planned behaviors, as well as cultural ways of communication, and people's trust in the information and its sources.",

Lee-Baggley et al. [9] noticed that optimistic thinking in response to SARS was related to the avoidance of public places and lots of people but not to adaptive health behaviors such as use of disinfectants and hand washing. On the other hand, those who had a more empathetic response to the SARS threat were more likely to report engagement in effective health behaviors and less likely to report avoidance.",

A typical Finnish feature, for instance, is to prompt people actively and daily to increase hand hygiene during epidemics-this was also done during the SARS epidemic-but there might also be cultural differences in coping with disease threats in general.",

There are established cultural differences in SARS-related optimism (e.g., [40, 41, 5, 42] . The culture defines illness representations in two ways: (a) providing linguistic labels for differentiating and categorizing the events forming illness cases and ensuring culturally shared views of diseases by creating expectations as well as directing attention; (b) providing personal contacts strengthening the illness schema development and giving social models for acquisition of the specific procedures for threat management [24, 25] .",
