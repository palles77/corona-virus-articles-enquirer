Several human HLA-A*0201 restricted CTL epitopes of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) spike (S) protein have been identified in HLA-A*0201 transgenic (Tg) mice, but the mechanisms and properties of immune responses are still not well understood. In this study, HLA-A*0201 Tg mice were primed intramuscularly with SARS S DNA and boosted subcutaneously with HLA-A*0201 restricted peptides. The lymphocytes from draining lymph nodes, spleens and lungs were stimulated with the cognate peptides. Three different methods (ELISA, ELISPOT and FACS) were used to evaluate the immune responses during short and long periods of time after immunization. Results showed that peptide-specific CD8 + T cells secreted IFN-\u2425, TNF-\u2423 and IL-2 and expressed CD107a/b on cell surface. IFN-\u2425 + CD8 + T cells and CD107a/b + CD8 + T cells distributed throughout the lymphoid and non-lymphoid tissues, but the frequency of peptide-specific CD8 + T cells was higher in lungs than in spleens and lymph nodes. The phenotype of the CD8 + T cells was characterized based on the expression of IFN-\u2425. Most of the HLA-A*0201 restricted peptide-specific CD8 + T cells represented a memory subset with CD45RB high and CD62L low . Taken together, these data demonstrate that immunization with SARS S DNA and HLA-A*0201 restricted peptides can elicit antigen-specific CD8 + T cell immune responses which may have a significant implication in the long-term protection. We provide novel information in cellular immune responses of SARS S antigen-specific CD8 + T cells, which are important in the development of vaccine against SARS-CoV infection.",

            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is an emerging infectious disease caused by a novel coronavirus named as SARSassociated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) which led to thousands of infected patients and hundreds of deaths [1] [2] [3] . To date, there is no effective drug to prevent or treat SARS. In addition, there is possibility of reintroduction of a SARS-like coronavirus into humans and the risk of an escape of SARS-CoV from laboratories [4, 5] . Although the outbreaks seem to be over, SARS remains safety concerns [6, 7] . SARS-CoV has been isolated and its genome sequenced [8, 9] . SARS-CoV is a positive-sense RNA virus that consists of four main structural proteins: spike protein (S), membrane protein (M), envelope protein (E) and nucleocapsid protein (N). S protein is a major structural glycoprotein of SARS-CoV responsible for receptor binding and membrane fusion [10] . It has been reported that vaccines based on the S protein seem to provide protection via an inhibition of viral replication after challenge with live SARS-CoV [11] . In addition, the cell-mediated response induced by S protein also plays a very important role in eliminating virus. We have demonstrated previously that after immunization with SARS-CoV S DNA vaccine, cellular immunity was induced by the evidence of high frequencies of IFN-\u2425 producing effector/memory CD4 + and CD8 + T cells in mice [12] . Hence, S protein is a major target for developing anti-SARS drugs or vaccines.",

            "text": "Evidence suggests that cytotoxic CD8 + T lymphocytes (CTLs) play a pivotal role in the elimination of virus particles during infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) acute infection [13, 14] . And to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection, CTLs not only contribute to virus elimination, but also induce immunopathology [15, 16] . Excited to us, we found that SARS-CoV S specific CTL responses were detected in patients who had recovered from SARS and mouse model [17, 18] . Therefore, CTLs may determine the role of immunity in controlling viral pathogenesis. Human CTLs are specific for peptides presented in the context of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules. HLA-A*0201 is expressed as 39-46% of all major ethnicities [19] , and furthermore HLA class I alleles have been reported to correlate with SARS susceptibility [20] . Recently, five S protein-derived CTL epitopes S1042-1050, S787-795, S1167-1175, S958-966 and S411-420 were identified by some groups [21] [22] [23] [24] . They have screened HLA-A*0201 restricted peptides which may be appropriate vaccine candidates. However, phenotypic characteristics and functions of the CTLs induced by those HLA-A*0201 restricted peptides remain undefined, and their distributions in different organs are still unknown. In this study, the CD8 + T cell responses induced by HLA-A*0201 restricted peptides were evaluated in draining lymph nodes, spleens and lungs from HLA-A*0201 transgenic mice vaccinated by SARS-CoV S DNA prime and HLA-A*0201 restricted peptides boost strategy. The functionalities and characteristics of the cognate peptides induced CD8 + T cell response were analyzed. Our data confirmed previous reports and demonstrated that numerous powerful peptide-specific CD8 + T cells that represented a memory subset with CD45RB high and CD62L low were elicited by HLA-A*0201-restricted peptides both in lymphoid and non-lymphoid tissues. These peptide-specific CD8 + T cells were persisted for over a long period of time, suggesting their long-term protective effect in vivo. These data provide novel information of antigen-specific CD8 + T cell responses in detail, which could be used for design of effective vaccine against SARS-CoV infection in humans.",

Besides, according to the information that several published articles have been reported [21] [22] [23] [24] , we screened and synthesized five peptides named as P19 (S1042-1050 VVFLHV-TYV), P20 (S787-795 ILPDPLKPT), P21 (S1167-1175 RLNEVAKNL), P22 (S958-966 VLNDILSRL) and P23 (S411-420 KLPDDFMGCV) by Sangon Crop. (Shanghai, China). Peptides were purified to >98% by reverse phase HPLC, as confirmed by mass spectrometry, which were dissolved in PBS at 2 mg/ml and stored in aliquots at \u221280 \u2022 C.",

The cells were stimulated with or without peptide-loaded DCs to assess HLA-A*0201 restricted peptide-specific immune responses. The levels of IFN-\u2425, TNF-\u2423 and IL-2 in the cell-free culture supernatants were determined by ELISA. The results revealed that very low levels of IFN-\u2425 were detected when lymphocytes were cultured in medium alone. Interestingly, addition of peptide-loaded DCs to cell culture systems markedly enhanced the production of IFN-\u2425 in all of the organs from DNA plus peptides immunized mice (Fig. 1A ). There is only modest IFN-\u2425 production in splenocytes from DNA alone immunized mice (P < 0.01) and the levels of IFN-\u2425 in PBS control groups were undetectable. Besides, there were TNF-\u2423 and IL-2 produced by lymphocytes from Tg mice immunized with SARS S DNA and HLA-A*0201 restricted peptides following cognate peptide stimulation in vitro. The results showed that the highest level of TNF-\u2423 was detected in lungs which were non-lymphoid tissues (P < 0.05). The production of IL-2 in spleens (P < 0.001) and lymph nodes (P < 0.05) was little stronger than it in lungs (Fig. 1B) .

HLA-A*0201 restricted peptides specific IFN-\u2425-producing cells were detected in CD8 + T subset but not in CD4 + T cells. These results were consistent with the previous reports [21] [22] [23] [24] and identified that the peptides P19-23 were HLA-A*0201 restricted peptides.

To illuminate this question, splenocytes from primeboost immunized mice were stimulated in vitro with or without peptide-loaded DCs in the same way as above. The CTL related intracellular cytokines were stained with anti-IFN-\u2425, anti-TNF-\u2423, anti-IL-2 and isotope controls. Results showed that HLA-A*0201 restricted peptide-specific CTLs could simultaneously produce several kinds of cytokines such as IFN-\u2425, TNF-\u2423 and IL-2 (Fig. 4A ). Further analysis of IFN-\u2425 and TNF-\u2423 expression demonstrated that peptide-specific CTLs could be divided into three distinct subpopulations, including IFN-\u2425 + TNF-\u2423 + cells, IFN-\u2425 + cells and TNF-\u2423 + cells. Most cells expressed both IFN-\u2425 and TNF-\u2423, and only small subsets of the cells expressed either IFN-\u2425 or TNF-\u2423 alone (Fig. 4A  and B ). In the same experiment, the expression of IFN-\u2425 and IL-2 presented the same phenomenon in peptide-specific CTLs which could be separated into IFN-\u2425 + IL-2 + double positive subset, IFN-\u2425 + single positive and IL-2 + single positive subsets. Differently the mainly subset was composed by IFN-\u2425 + single positive cells, only a small population of the IFN-\u2425 + IL-2 + CD8 + T cells could be detected and very few IL-2 + CD8 + T cells were observed (Fig. 4B) . Taken together, these results indicated that HLA-A*0201 restricted peptide-specific CTLs elicited in vivo can produce several kinds of cytokines following peptides stimulation, suggesting that the CTLs may have effective function in protecting body against infection.

After 6 h of incubation, cells were harvested, washed and stained for cell-surface markers, including CD45RB as a marker for memory cells in mice and CD62L as effector/memory T subset marker. Cells were first gated on CD8 + T cells and the phenotype of IFN-\u2425 + CD8 + T cells was analyzed. As shown in Fig. 5 , nearly 89% of IFN-\u2425 + CD8 + T cells expressed CD45RB high and approximately 84% subset was CD62L low . Although most IFN-\u2425 producing cells were CD45RB high CD62L low cells, a variable fraction (mean value 16%) of the IFN-\u2425 + CD8 + T cells expressed high level of CD62L which were considered as typical central memory CD8 + T cells [32, 33] . Thus, on basis of IFN-\u2425 producing cells, a population of peptidespecific CD8 + T cells that have characteristics of memory T cells has been identified in this study. And the IFN-\u2425 + CD8 + T cells with CD45RB high CD62L low might indeed belong to an intermediate sub- set ready to be conscripted into the effector population during reinfection.",

As we all know, degranulation is a key step to Ag-specific CD8 + T cells to lyze targets cells. Evidence suggests that FACS assay measures the exposure of CD107a/b onto the cell surface as a result of degranulation, presenting in the membrane of cytotoxic granules [34] . We observed a reciprocal expression of surface CD107a/b which may be due to granzyme depletion in cells having undergone recent granule exocytosis. In this study, surface expression of CD107a/b was enriched in CD8 + T cells stimulated by peptides in vitro, over the population of CD8 + T cells without peptides stimulation (Fig. 6 ). In the same time the expression of IFN-\u2425 or TNF-\u2423 by CD8 + T cells was determined and results showed that a small part of cells co-expressed CD107a/b with IFN-\u2425 or TNF-\u2423, suggesting the diversity of antigen-specific T cells. Thus, a subset of CD8 + T cells expresses effector molecules associated with the cytotoxic function. We believe that these data strongly support the hypothesis that antigen-specific CD8 + T cells mediate effective cytotoxic activity in vivo.",

The data showed that persistent peptide-specific memory CD8 + T cells which could secrete IFN-\u2425 and TNF-\u2423 following cognate peptides stimulation still could be detected in spleens, though one month has pasted since the boost vaccination. The frequency of IFN-\u2425 + CD8 + T (mean value 0.23%) cells and TNF-\u2423 + CD8 + T cells (mean value 0.29%) from stimulated splenocytes were 5.6-and 5.7-folds higher than cells cultured in medium alone, respectively.

We have identified two novel epitopes which could induce antigen-specific CD4 + T cell and CD8 + T cell immune responses in BABL/C mice, respectively [18] . However, it is known that the ultimate purpose of scientific research is used by human beings. Although many antigen-specific CD8 + T cell epitopes in SARS-CoV had been identified in animal models, it is not appropriated to directly apply them to the human vaccine. So identification of functional dominant CD8 + T cell epitopes in SARS-CoV S protein for human is crucial. Excited to us is that several HLA-A*0201 restricted peptides from SARS S protein have been screened by some groups currently [21] [22] [23] [24] . However, the mechanisms and properties of immune responses induced by these epitopes are still not well understood.

TNF-\u2423 that has important effect role in activating macrophages, inducing apoptosis of infected cells and contributing to granuloma formation.

Although peptide-specific CD8 + T cells from both lymph nodes and spleens could produce IL-2 upon peptides stimulation, the level of IL-2 in lungs was under detectable. As we know antigen-specific CD8 + T cells become exhausted by loss of a subset of effect functions and IL-2 production appears most sensitive to inactivation, followed by TNF-\u2423 synthesis, while IFN-\u2425 production appears more resistant to this early functional loss [33] . To say in other words, CD8 + T cells producing IL-2 are also more likely to differentiate into memory cells, and CD8 + T cells producing only IFN-\u2425 tend to be short-lived. Thus, we presumed that antigen-activated CD8 + T cells that migrate from lymphoid tissues to lungs which belong to effect organ were short-lived, while most memory CD8 + T cells reside in the lymphoid tissues.",

CD107a and CD107b are two intracellular proteins that are normally found in lysosome, but are also a structural component of cytotoxic granules. Acquisition of cell surface CD107a/b is associated with loss of intracellular perforin, indicating that exposure of CD107a/b to the cell surface is dependent on degranulation. Following exocytosis of cytotoxic granules, CD107a/b is transiently expressed on the cell surface of CTLs [38, 39] . Thus, the expression of CD107a/b can actually reflect the cytotoxic ability of antigen-specific CD8 + T cells [34] . Kamath et al. [38] have detected the level of CD107a/b in antigen-specific CD8 + T cells during mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. However, the expression of CD107a/b of antigen-specific CD8 + T cells in SARS has never been detected. Our results showed for the first time that the expression of CD107a/b in peptides stimulated lymphocytes from spleens markedly increased, suggesting the production of cytotoxic antigen-specific CD8 + T cells in vaccinated Tg mice. Meanwhile, we detected the co-expression of IFN-\u2425 with CD107a/b, and TNF-\u2423 with Cd107a/b respectively. Interestingly, the data demonstrated that a population of CD107a/b + CD8 + T cells that did not produce IFN-\u2425 or TNF-\u2423 could be observed (Fig. 6B) . These data imply that measuring CD8 + T cell responses by IFN-\u2425 production alone in previous studies may underestimate the total responses and the variety of antigen-specific CD8 + T cells in vivo.",

CD45RB expression was decreased on effector T cells compared to naive T cells, whereas most memory cells, like naive T cells, expressed a CD45RB high phenotype [41] . In this study, the expression of CD45RB molecule was high on the most of IFN-\u2425 producing CD8 + T cells. The presence of this naive phenotype on CD8 + T cells after antigen exposure has already been observed and could be explained by a re-expression after a down-regulation during the effector phase [42, 43] . CD62L, a surface protein that mediates homing to lymphoid organs, is reversible in vivo as already described [41, 42] . In fact, T CM express relatively high levels of CD62L and T EM express relatively low levels of this molecule. We observed rather 84% of a population of IFN-\u2425 + CD8 + T cells with CD62L low and 16% of central memory IFN-\u2425 + CD8 + T cells with CD62L high . These results are similar with the founding by Meraldi V who demonstrated most of multimer + CD8 + T cells had intermediate phenotype CD44 high , CD45RB high and CD62L low induced by polypeptide from plasmodium berghei, which might be ready to be conscripted into the effector population during reinfection [43] .",

Such protection is mediated by both cytolytic that represent by the expression of CD107a/b and non-cytolytic mechanisms, the latter as a result of IFN-\u2425, TNF-\u2423 and IL-2 production by CD8 + T cells. The distribution of peptidespecific CD8 + T cells which has memory T cell characteristics is different in lymphoid tissues and non-lymphoid tissues. Taken together, these data provided some novel information in cellular immune responses of SARS S antigen-specific CD8 + T cells, which were important in the development of vaccine against SARS-CoV infection. Therefore, we have a hypothesis that SARS S DNA prime and HLA-A*0201 restricted peptides boost vaccine may offer considerable potential in humans, both for preventative vaccines and for past exposure prophylaxis.",
