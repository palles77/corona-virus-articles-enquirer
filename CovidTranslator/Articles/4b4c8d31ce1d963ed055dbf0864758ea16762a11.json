Because most investigations on cellular remodeling in plant cells have been conducted using positive-sense (+)RNA viruses, this review will mainly focus on this class of viruses. Replication by plant (+)RNA viruses, like their vertebrate homologs, leads to the formation in the infected cell of elaborate membranous, organelle-like, platforms that sustain viral RNA synthesis and cell-to-cell movement. These membrane modifications are believed to increase the local concentrations of viral and host proteins needed to produce new genomes, which probably enhance replication efficiency, and possibly to provide protection from host defense response [3] . They also act as vehicles for the egress of viral RNA for systemic infection throughout the plant (for a review on the subject, refer to [4]).",

            "text": "Different plant virus groups induce the formation of diverse structures from host endomembranes, both in terms of architecture and membrane/organelle origin. Endomembranes are defined here as a system of interconnected membranes that fills the cell interior and connects the cell boundary with the double membraned organellesnucleus, plastids and mitochondria. Essentially, every single organelle found in a plant cell is targeted by one virus or another. For example, Tomato bushy stunt virus (TBSV) replicates in peroxisomes [5], Carnation Italian ringspot virus in mitochondria [6] and Turnip yellow mosaic virus in chloroplasts [7] . The significance of this organellar diversity is unknown, but specific membrane targeting appears not to be a strict requirement for efficient viral infection as replication complexes can be redirected to an alternate subcellular localization [8, 9] . There are also many examples indicating that membrane remodeling is the consequence of plant viruses replicating or moving on endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-derived membranes. This results in the formation of mini-organelles referred to as spherules, vesicles or multivesicular bodies [10,11,12,13 ,14,15 ,16,17] . These vesicles may be single or double membrane structures that are often connected to the cytosol by a narrow neck, allowing exchange of components needed for replication [18] . The ER is a major component of the cell's secretory pathway, which is a series of steps a cell uses to move host components to their final functional location. The secretory pathway was thus shown to be used for intracellular and intercellular viral movement [19 ,20 ,21 ,22,23 ,24,25] . Virus use of the secretory pathway not only has a morphological impact on ER, it also leads to an inhibition of protein secretion [26] and may promote specific lipid synthesis [27] . Although there is a significant amount of literature that deals with the identification of the viral proteins involved in membrane remodeling and vesicle production, there are very few investigations that report on the impact that plant virus infection has on the overall architecture and dynamics of the early secretory endomembranes. This review will look at recent works that show that Potato virus X (PVX) and Turnip mosaic virus (TuMV) infections lead to endomembrane recruitment into large perinuclear globular structures that are functionally linked to smaller peripherally located motile vesicles that ultimately become associated with plasmodesmata. This connection would provide an assembly line for viral genome replication and virus egress into neighboring cells.",

            "text": "Before looking at endomembrane recruitment during plant virus infections, it may be important to provide an overview of the general morphology of plant cells. For those interested in a more detailed account of plant cell morphology, they are invited to consult The Illuminated Plant Cell website (http://www.illuminatedcell.com/ Home.html). First, it must be realized that for many plant cells there is limited free cytosolic space, which is restricted by the presence of large central vacuoles and by the sheer number of chloroplasts. Within this constricted space, the ER pervades the cell and has an extremely dynamic, multifunctional and pleomorphic nature [28, 29] . Morphologically, it is characterized by a nuclear envelope-connected ER and a peripheral (cortical) tubular and cisternal ER juxtaposing the plasma membrane. Transvacuolar ER strands provide a direct link between the perinuclear and the cortical ER and act as distribution routes for metabolites, organelles [30] and are also thought to be involved in anchoring the nucleus within the cell [31 ] . The plant Golgi apparatus is present in the form of several motile bodies that are distributed throughout the cytoplasm and are associated with microfilaments [32] . Golgi bodies also move in close association with ER tubules and traffic rapidly within transvacuolar strands [33] , whereas in animal cells the Golgi apparatus occupies a rather stationary perinuclear position [34] . Another important difference is the absence in plant cells of an intermediate compartment between ER and the Golgi apparatus, which is present in mammalian cells and known as the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) [35] . Finally, plant cells have plasmodesmata that provide cytoplasmic continuity between neighboring cells that supports the cell-to-cell and long-distance trafficking of small molecules as well as of a wide spectrum of endogenous proteins and ribonucleoprotein complexes. These plasma membrane lined channels contain ERderived desmotubules and actin filaments and are used for virus cell-to-cell spread (for a review on the topic see [4, 36] ). These distinctive features may explain the relationship between ER-associated virus replication centers and virus egress through plasmodesmata [37] .",

This question has recently been addressed in the case of potato virus X (PVX, genus potexvirus). At late infection stages, PVX induces the formation of large inclusion bodies often localized next to the nucleus, which have historically been termed 'Xbodies', that contain viral RNA [38] , PVX replication proteins, virions and ribosomes [12, 39] . Very recently, Tilsner et al. [40 ] have analyzed the contribution of endomembranes to these X-bodies. First, they found that the triple gene block protein 1 (TGBp1) forms the core of the X-bodies, which have a layered structure with TGBp1 aggregates at the center, vRNA in the middle and virions at the cytoplasmic periphery ( Figure 1 ). They found that the ER and Golgi (as well as actin filaments) are heavily recruited into these structures, apparently reorganized into densely stacked membranes (Figure 1 ). Since TGB proteins are not needed for PVX replication, the authors propose that this elaborate structure provides a restricted environment that would link replication with movement and possibly encapsidation.",

The 6K 2 -VPg-Pro precursor protein of potyviruses has been shown to be a scaffold protein around which the viral replication complex assembles [15 ,42-46] . VPg binds several viral and host proteins, in particular translation factors (for a review, refer to [47] ) while the 6K 2 is responsible for membrane recruitment [47] . They examined the distribution of well characterized ER and Golgi organelle markers in TuMV-infected cells by confocal microscopy. In TuMV-infected cells, the cortical ER does not show any apparent modification but is speckled with 6K 2 -tagged vesicles (from now on designated as peripheral vesicles). On the contrary, the perinuclear ER is enlarged into a large irregular shaped globular-like structure that contained 6K 2 and is linked to the cortical ER by transvacuolar strands. The ER is compacted within this structure and does not show a polygonal tubular pattern. Golgi bodies, COPII coatamers and chloroplasts are also recruited into this perinuclear globular structure (Figure 1 ). Disruption of the early secretory pathway by Brefeldin A (BFA) or by co-expression of a dominant-negative mutant of Arf1, which regulates membrane traffic between the Golgi and ER, does not affect the formation of the globular structure. Similarly, BFA does not affect replication of Melon necrotic spot virus whereas it has a negative impact on cell-to-cell movement [19 ] . This situation is also observed during coronavirus infection where virusinduced remodeling of endoplasmic reticulum membranes and viral replication, albeit reduced, still take place in the presence of BFA [48] .",

Since the perinuclear globular structure observed in TuMV-infected cells contains an amalgam of condensed ER and Golgi membranes, investigations have been performed to observe if this compartment is nevertheless functionally linked to the bulk of non-modified endomembranes [41] . Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) experiments and the use of photoactivable GFP (PAGFP) [51] indicated that the TuMV-induced perinuclear structure is not an isolated subcellular compartment, Golgi and ER being connected to the bulk of the host cell endomembranes. It also appears that this compartment is a reservoir that can hold a large quantity of ER membranes. It has been reported that plant viral infections stimulate de novo membrane synthesis [14, 52, 53] and perhaps the bulk of newly synthesized lipids accumulate in these perinuclear structures. On the contrary, the perinuclear globular structure is not rapidly restocked in viral components following photobleaching, with no input of viral proteins from near-by perinuclear structures. Similarly, the internal architecture of Hepatitis C virus membranous webs appears relatively static, with limited exchange of viral proteins within and between neighboring replication complexes [54] .",

The mutation also leads to impaired traffic of proteins at the ER/Golgi interface. In the same vein, Nakano et al. [59 ] isolated two A. thaliana mutants with defects in ER morphology and designated them endoplasmic reticulum morphology1 (ermo1) and ermo2. The cells of both 686 Virus replication in animals and plants mutants develop a number of ER-derived spherical bodies, approximately 1 mm in diameter, that also contain Golgi bodies. The above lines have a defect in one of the Sec24 isomers that causes a partial loss of function for the binding of cargo protein intended for secretion. Faso et al. [58 ] hypothesized that if constitutive traffic is disrupted, inappropriate fusion of vesicles between the ER and the Golgi may occur, creating an aberrant compartment.

[23 ] showed that mutations in the Cterminal region of the protein no longer formed vesicles in the cortical ER but exhibited perinuclear ER localization and concluded that C-terminal region of TGBp3 probably contains a sorting signal specifying cortical ER localization, implying interaction with a secretory pathway component. The tobacco etch virus (genus potyvirus) 6K 2 protein may also have an ER export signal [64] .
