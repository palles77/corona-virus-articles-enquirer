Camels have been implicated as the reservoir of MERS-CoV, but the exact source and mode of transmission for most patients remain unknown. During a 3 month period, June to August 2013, there were 12 positive MERS-CoV cases reported from the Hafr Al-Batin region district in the north east region of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. In addition to the different regional camel festivals in neighboring countries, Hafr Al-Batin has the biggest camel market in the entire Kingdom and hosts an annual camel festival. Thus, we conducted a detailed epidemiological, clinical and genomic study to ascertain common exposure and transmission patterns of all cases of MERS-CoV reported from Hafr Al-Batin. Analysis of previously reported genetic data indicated that at least two of the infected contacts could not have been directly infected from the index patient and alternate source should be considered. While camels appear as the likely source, other sources have not been ruled out. More detailed case control studies with detailed case histories, epidemiological information and genomic analysis are being conducted to delineate the missing pieces in the transmission dynamics of MERS-CoV outbreak.

If the number of differences between two sequences accumulating in a given time is assumed to follow a Poisson distribution, with l equal to the expected number of mutations, the probability of finding this number of differences between the two sequences by chance can be calculated from the cumulative density function of the Poisson distribution. A transmission pair was rejected if the number of observed mutations exceeded the 95% upper cumulative probability value. To reduce the chance of type 1 statistical errors due to multiple testing, a Bonferroni correction was applied to the significance cutoff, resulting in an adjusted significance level of 3.85 \u00c2 10 -3 . The rate of evolution of MERS-CoV has been estimated at 1.12 \u00c2 10-3 substitutions per site per year (95% credible interval [95% CI], 8.76 \u00c2 10 -4 ; 1.37 \u00c2 10 -3 ). 10 To account for uncertainty in the evolutionary rate of the virus, the transmission tests were repeated at the 95% upper and lower credible intervals and checked for consistency in the results.",

A reproductive time for MERS-CoV has been estimated at 7-12 days, 11 which represents the time from symptom onset in a primary case to symptom onset in a secondary case. This estimate is largely derived from hospitalbased infections which may be dominated by patients with renal failure and other co-morbidities, 4,12 as well as close contact with infected cases resulting in an underestimate of the generation time. For testing the global transmission of the virus, we included an asymptomatic period when a patient might still be infectious, estimating that a case remains infectious for 14 days, and assuming that identification would occur within 7 days of infection. Thus, any two cases might be plausibly directly linked if they meet the statistical sequence test and the two sample dates differ by 21 days or less. This calculation was used to assess the likelihood that virus transmission occurred directly between two test cases and was applied to all cases infected with the Hafr-Al-Batin_1 MERS-CoV variant.",

All statistically supported transmissions are marked by arcs connecting the relevant patients. Several important patterns appear. The viruses Hafr-Al-Batin_1, Riyadh_8, Riyadh_12 are linked to a large number of possible pairs. Hafr-Al-Batin_1_2013 is an early virus in this clade and may be representative of the camel to human zoonosis that gave rise to this clade, showing linkage to 10 of the 19 cases infected with the Hafr-Al-Batin_1 clade virus. The 4 linkages from Riyadh_8, 3 linkages from Riyadh_11 and 4 linkages from Riyadh_12 viruses may provide important clues. These are viruses from patients in Riyadh with no direct links to the Hafr Al-Batin region and no contact with animals, including camels. Within a period of one month, closely-related viruses were observed in Riyadh, in the Hafr Al-Batin region as well as in Madinah, with statistical support for direct transmission events. Any MERS-CoV transmission model must account for this rapid virus movement and MERS-CoV infection with no apparent live animal contact. Furthermore, sequences from three viruses in the recently described camel/human transmission cluster in Qatar also fall within the Hafr Al-Batin cluster. 8 The transmission testing supports the conclusion that the Qatar human and camel viruses are directly related to the Saudi Hafr Al-Batin cluster.",

The known 14 primary cases in these clusters were adult men. 21 Of the involved individuals, 26% occurred in healthcare setting. 21 The largest healthcare associated MERS-CoV cluster was reported from Al-Hasa, Saudi Arabia. 4 In an earlier family cluster from Saudi Arabia, an adult male index case resided in an extended household of 10 other adults and 18 children . Secondary cases were identified in two sons, and a grandson. 3 The findings from previous clusters showed that immunocompetent contacts exhibit mild symptoms. 20, 22 In the UK cluster of MERS-CoV, two cases of MERS-CoV infection were confirmed and one of the two cases had severe illness. None of the 59 healthcare workers contacts had infection. 20 In the Hafr Al-Batin cases reported here, 19.4% among the family contacts tested positive and 2% of the healthcare worker contacts were positive for MERS-CoV (p = 0.0078).",

            "text": "One of the differences between primary cases and secondary cases in MERS-CoV clusters is that primary cases frequently have no contact with a known MERS cases and are therefore thought to acquire infection through contact with non-human sources of the virus. 23 The Hafr Al-Batin MERS Cluster 2 showed the spectrum of illness of MERS-CoV from asymptomatic to a fulminant disease as observed previously. 3 In the current study, animal contact was reported in 41.7% of all cases. The presence of animal contact among asymptomatic family contacts further complicate the issue of having secondary cases as a result of direct contact or the result of exposure to the same source or host of MERS-CoV that lead to the index infection. In fact, for family cluster 2, our genetic data indicate that while Patient 8 is likely to have acquired the infection from the index Patient 3, at least two of the infected contacts (Patients 4 and 5) could not have been directly infected from Patient 3 and alternate source should be considered. 5  100  sore throat  4  80  cough  5  100  shortness of breath  5  100  hemoptysis  1  20  nausea  1  20  headache  2  40 Although, there have been a number of transmissions observed within healthcare setting and interfamilial, the number of secondary transmissions seem be limited and is consistent with the R 0 estimates for MERS being less than 1. 11, 32 This finding is similar to previous observations from known clusters 4, 24, 25 and that secondary attack rates among family members of patients in other clusters appear to be low. 3, 4, 17, 25, 26 In a recent large screening study, family contacts had a higher positivity rate (3.6%) than HCW contacts (1.12%). 27 Systematic implementation of infection prevention and control measures in reported clusters involving healthcare settinghas appeared to limit onward transmission to HCW and hospitalized patients. 4 A large annual camel fair takes place in Hafr Al-Batin each November-December to March with movement of a large number of camels both to and from Hafr Al-Batin. 9 It seems that the timing of the Hafr Al-Batin sequence divergence is consistent with the annual fair and animal movement. It remains unclear if primary cases had acquired MERS-CoV from direct animal contact or as a result of contact or consumption of animal products, unpasteurized camel milk and products (ice cream). Evidence that camels are a source of human MERS-CoV infections is accumulating. Two sets of patients with camel contacts have now been analyzed and the sequence data support direct transmission between camel and human, although the sequences do not allow direction of transmission. 8, 30 Serological evidence that the camel infections predate the human infection has been provided. 30 Furthermore, a full MERS-CoV genome has been obtained from a camel in Egypt; 31 this combined with the high prevalence of MERS-CoV seropositivity indicates that camels may be frequently infected with the virus. More detailed case control studies with detailed case histories, epidemiological information and genomic analysis are being conducted to delineate the missing pieces in the transmission dynamics of MERS-CoV outbreak.",

This annual festival is known locally as ''Mazayin al-Ibl, meaning ''The Best of the Herds,'' and attracts more than 160,000 people 9 from November-December to March each year. This festival was the first to be established in the region and subsequently other camel festivals were started in neighboring countries: Qatar, Kuwait and United Arab Emirates. Since evidence is accumulating that camels are a zoonotic reservoir for MERS-CoV, we conducted a detailed epidemiological, clinical and genomic study to ascertain common exposure and transmission patterns of all cases of MERS reported from Hafr Al-Batin and relate it to other available genomic sequences from KSA and globally.Figure 1. (A) The epidemiologically defined transmission pathway of the two MERS-CoV clusters. Markers for each MERS case were placed by sample date (x-axis) and colored dark grey for fatal outcome or green for non-fatal outcome. Patient numbers are indicated within each marker. The age and gender of each case are indicated, and epidemiologically-possible contacts of Patients 1, 3 and 8 are marked by arrows. (B) Determination of genetically plausible transmission for the Hafr Al-Batin Cluster 2. Time of sample collection is indicated on the x-axis.Colored markers indicate the MERS case with the following code. Blue: MERS-CoV sequence was available for that case, grey: no sequence was available, orange: no sequence was available but the ancestral reconstructed sequence for the clade was used. Green arrows indicate statistically plausible transmission between the pair (with no direction implied), red arrows indicate that transmission between the pair is not supported statistically.
