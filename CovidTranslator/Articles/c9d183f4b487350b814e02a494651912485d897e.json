Correspondingly, inflammatory monocytes and neutrophils are recruited to sites of infection in a CW3-capsid-dependent manner. Recruited monocytes and neutrophils are subsequently infected, representing a majority of infected cells in vivo. Systemic depletion of inflammatory monocytes or neutrophils from persistently infected Rag1 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice reduces viral titers in a tissue-specific manner. These data indicate that the CW3 capsid facilitates lytic cell death, inflammation, and recruitment of susceptible cells to promote persistence. Infection of continuously recruited inflammatory cells may be a mechanism of persistence broadly utilized by lytic viruses incapable of establishing latency.",

            "text": "INTRODUCTION Persistent viral replication contributes to spread of infection and maintains viruses within a population between outbreaks of disease (Virgin et al., 2009) . Human norovirus is a fecal-oral pathogen and a major cause of severe gastroenteritis worldwide (Ahmed et al., 2014; Glass et al., 2009) . Human norovirus can persist asymptomatically for weeks to months after infection, and asymptomatic individuals can contribute to viral transmission (Atmar et al., 2008; Kirby et al., 2014; Lopman et al., 2014; Saito et al., 2014) . Additionally, persistent norovirus infection is a particular problem in immunosuppressed or genetically immunocompromised individuals, where it is a well-documented cause of chronic illness and can spread systemically (Capizzi et al., 2011; Frange et al., 2012; Lemes et al., 2014; Saif et al., 2011; Westhoff et al., 2008; Woodward et al., 2017) . In order to persist, continuously replicating viruses, such as norovirus, must infect a continuously replenished cell population or have a mechanism to keep infected cells alive. Murine norovirus (MNV) is an experimentally tractable relative of human norovirus that establishes persistent enteric infection in a strain-dependent manner (Karst et al., 2003; Thackray et al., 2007) . The MNV strain CR6 is restricted to the intestine and draining mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs) and establishes persistent infection (Nice et al., 2013) . In contrast, the MNV strain CW3 replicates systemically and is cleared by immune-competent mice, but persists systemically in Rag1 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice (Karst et al., 2003) . The phenotypic differences between MNV strains, together with development of tools for genetic manipulation, have led to the identification of virus and host factors that determine the outcome of infection (Nice et al., 2018) .",

            "text": "At least two viral proteins account for the phenotypic differences between CW3 and CR6. The non-structural protein 1 (NS1) of CR6 determines enteric persistence, and the capsid (VP1) of CW3 determines systemic replication (Nice et al., 2013; Strong et al., 2012) . A single amino acid change to the NS1 of CW3 (CW3 D94E ) promotes persistent infection. However, the reciprocal mutation in CR6 (CR6 E94D ) does not prevent persistence, indicating that additional differences within NS1 are important (Nice et al., 2013) . NS1 CR6 enables infection of intestinal epithelial cells (IECs), the cellular reservoir of persistent enteric infection, but the molecular mechanism of NS1 is unknown and remains an area of ongoing research (Lee et al., 2017b) . VP1 has been more extensively studied and was recently shown to bind CD300lf, a cellular receptor necessary for entry (Haga et al., 2016; Orchard et al., 2016) . Strains CW3 and CR6 both require CD300lf for entry, and, therefore, the mechanism of differential tissue tropism for these strains is CD300lf independent. Systemic replication determined by VP1 of CW3 (VP1 CW3 ) correlates with enhanced expression of type I interferon (IFN) and type III IFN genes at initial sites of MNV replication (Nice et al., 2015) . These IFN families play complementary roles in the antiviral host response: type I IFN controls systemic MNV replication in myeloid-lineage cells, whereas type III IFN controls replication and persistence in IECs (Baldridge et al., 2017; Lee et al., 2017b; Nice et al., 2015) . Consistent with the role of type III IFN in protecting IECs, persistence of CW3 D94E is promoted by replacing VP1 CW3 with VP1 CR6 (CW3 D94E -VP1 CR6 ), which reduces induction of type III IFN (Nice et al., 2015) . Thus, an early difference in IFN expression determined by VP1 can change the outcome of MNV infection.",

            "text": "The actions of IFNs are manifold, including the induction of cell-intrinsic effector molecules and secretion of chemokines to recruit effector cells. Activation of these effector cells following their recruitment is also regulated by IFNs. Neutrophils and Ly6C high inflammatory monocytes (IMs) are among the first responders to infection, capable of responding to and producing IFNs. Recruitment of IMs and neutrophils is beneficial for clearance of bacteria and fungi (Dale et al., 2008) but can be either beneficial or detrimental for clearance of viruses (Channappanavar et al., 2016; Conrady et al., 2013; Galani et al., 2017; Lee et al., 2017a; Sammicheli et al., 2016; Uyangaa et al., 2015) . Like other myeloid cells, IMs and neutrophils express Cd300lf, suggesting a susceptibility to MNV infection. Additionally, lineage-specific deletion of Ifnar1 using LysM-cre or CD11c-cre results in poor control of systemic viral replication (Nice et al., 2016; Thackray et al., 2012) . CD11c-cre targets recombination in 5%-70% of IM and neutrophil populations, in addition to its widely recognized targeting of dendritic cells (Abram et al., 2014) , In this study, we characterize the host cytokine response to MNV infection determined by VP1 and define its impact on systemic viral replication. Using a panel of VP1 chimeric viruses, we find that infection of cells in vitro with VP1 CW3 strains results in increased lytic cell death relative to VP1 CR6 strains. Furthermore, infection with VP1 CW3 strains elicits increased release of inflammatory cytokines in vitro and in vivo. Increased inflammation results in more inflammatory monocyte and neutrophil recruitment to sites of early replication and persistent systemic replication. Strikingly, recruited IMs and neutrophils are preferentially infected, and their chronic recruitment is required to maintain persistent systemic infection of Rag1 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice. Therefore, inflammation can play a pro-viral role in systemic persistence by recruiting susceptible inflammatory myeloid cells.",

We compared cells infected with the following MNV strains to identify capsid-dependent differences in cytokine production: (1) CR6 compared with CR6 with the CW3 capsid (CR6-VP1 CW3 ) ( Figure 1A ) and (2) CW3 D94E compared with CW3 D94E with the CR6 capsid (CW3 D94E -VP1 CR6 ) ( Figure 1B ). CW3 D94E was also compared with UV-inactivated CW3 D94E to identify differences that depended on viral replication. The cytokines bound to the array were analyzed and sorted by normalized signal intensity to identify VP1-specific differences. On average, the cytokines included in this array were more abundant following infection with VP1 CW3 -expressing MNV strains relative to VP1 CR6 -expressing strains ( Figure S1A ). Six cytokines had a VP1 CW3 /VP1 CR6 ratio of greater than 1.5 when comparing both sets of chimeras and were also greater than 1.5-fold higher compared with UV-inactivated control ( Figures 1C, S1A , and S1B). These VP1 CW3 -dependent cytokines included several potent initiators of inflammation CXCL2, interleukin-6 (IL-6), and IL-1a ( Figure 1C ). Additionally, major histocompatibility complex II (MHCII) expression was modestly increased upon infection with VP1 CW3 -expressing MNV strains relative to VP1 CR6 -expressing strains ( Figure S1C ), and related studies by Bouziat et al. (2018 [this issue of Cell Host & Microbe] ) indicate that VP1 CW3 -expressing MNV promotes loss of immune tolerance to oral antigens. Such capsid-dependent immunomodulatory effects may result from increased inflammatory cytokines. Quantitation of IL-1a by ELISA confirmed that infection of BMDCs with VP1 CW3 -encoding MNV strains, but not otherwise identical strains encoding VP1 CR6 , led to a significant increase in IL-1a release compared with naive BMDCs ( Figure 1D ). This VP1 CW3 -dependent increase in IL-1a release was not accompanied by a significant difference in viral genome replication (Figure 1E) and was inconsistently accompanied by increase in il1a messenger RNA ( Figure 1F ). These data indicate that VP1 CW3 increases inflammatory cytokine release, particularly IL-1a, from infected cells.",

To determine the role of STAT1-dependent IFN signaling on the inflammatory response elicited by MNV, we infected Stat1 \u00c0/\u00c0 BMDCs with the panel of MNV strains depicted in Figures 1A and 1B and quantified IL-1a release by ELISA. All strains elicited significant IL-1a release relative to uninfected control cells, but the quantity released from CW3 D94E -infected cells was significantly greater than from CW3 D94E -VP1 CR6 -infected cells and was accompanied by an increase in surface MHCII (Figures 1G and S1C). The overall magnitude of IL-1a release was higher in Stat1 \u00c0/\u00c0 BMDCs relative to wild-type (WT) BMDCs (compare Figures 1D and 1G ). Additionally, the overall level of MNV genome replication in Stat1 \u00c0/\u00c0 BMDCs was higher than in WT BMDCs (compare Figures 1H and 1E ), which may account for the increased IL-1a release. As observed in WT cells, a VP1 CW3 -dependent increase in IL-1a protein was not reproducibly accompanied by corresponding increase in viral genome replication ( Figure 1H ). Additionally, IL-1a release by Stat1 \u00c0/\u00c0 BMDCs was not correlated with increase in il1a messenger RNA ( Figure 1I ). These data demonstrate that the VP1 CW3dependent increase in IL-1a protein release does not require Stat1-mediated signaling, an accompanying increase in il1a transcription, or an accompanying increase in MNV genome replication. Therefore, capsid-dependent IL-1a release is likely to be regulated by a post-transcriptional mechanism.",

            "text": "The MNV Capsid Determines Inflammatory Myeloid Cell Recruitment to Infected Tissues Many enteric pathogens, including MNV, gain entry to host tissues through the Peyer's patches (PP) of the small intestine . Following infection of the PP, MNV spreads to the MLNs and, depending on a combination of host and virus genetics, to systemic tissues (Elftman et al., 2013; Nice et al., 2013 Nice et al., , 2015 Strong et al., 2012) . To determine whether VP1-dependent cytokine production correlates with inflammatory cell recruitment, we infected WT or Stat1 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice with CW3 D94E or CW3 D94E -VP1 CR6 and characterized cellular infiltrate. Two days after infection, we observed an increase in IMs (CD11b + /Ly6C high , Figures S2A-S2C ) present in MLN of WT and Stat1 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice infected with CW3 D94E , whereas IMs were not significantly increased in the MLN following CW3 D94E -VP1 CR6 infection (Figures 2A, 2B , 2D, and 2E). Neutrophils (CD11b high /Ly6C low /F480 -, Figures S2A-S2C) were also significantly increased in the MLN of Stat1 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice infected with CW3 D94E but not CW3 D94E -VP1 CR6 (Figures 2D and 2F ). In comparison with Stat1 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice, WT mice had a low and inconsistent presence of neutrophils in the MLN following MNV infection ( Figure 2C ), suggesting that an impaired interferon response amplified neutrophil recruitment. PP of infected WT and Stat1 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice had a significant increase in IMs relative to uninfected controls, but CW3 D94E infection resulted in greater recruitment, on average, relative to CW3 D94E -VP1 CR6 infection ( Figures S2D, S2E, and S2G ). Similar to MLN, neutrophils infiltrated PP of infected Stat1 \u00c0/\u00c0 whereas there was no significant increase in PP neutrophils of infected WT mice relative to controls ( Figures S2F and S2H ). Immunofluorescence microscopy of MLN from Stat1 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice revealed the presence of neutrophils two days after infection with CW3 D94E that were Ly6C/G + (Gr-1 antibody) and F4/80 neg ( Figure 2G ). These cells were organized in clusters within the tissue and were less apparent in mice infected with CW3 D94E -VP1 CR6 , consistent with the VP1 CW3dependent neutrophil and IM infiltrate identified by FACS (Figure 2F ). Taken together, these data suggest that the increased inflammatory cytokine release determined by VP1 CW3 results in recruitment of IMs and neutrophils to infected MLNs. Additionally, the presence of IMs and neutrophils in infected Stat1 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice indicates that STAT1-dependent IFN signaling is not required for their recruitment.",

Ligands for CCR2 (CCL2 and CCL12) were among VP1dependent cytokines identified in the serum of Stat1 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice ( Figure S1D ). Additionally, we detected increased Ccl2 transcription in MLN of WT mice infected with CW3 D94E but not CW3 D94E -VP1 CR6 , concurrent with increased VP1-dependent Ifnb1 and Ifnl2/3 transcription ( Figure 3A ). Therefore, we tested whether CCR2 was required for IM and neutrophil infiltrate following MNV infection. Consistent with the known requirements of CCR2 for egress from bone marrow, MLNs of Ccr2 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice infected with CW3 had a significantly reduced recruitment of IMs to infected tissues compared with WT mice ( Figure 3B ). However, Stat1, Ifnar1, and Ifnlr1 were dispensable for IM recruitment to MLN and PP infected with CW3 ( Figures 3B and S3A) , in contrast to studies of herpes simplex virus infection that demonstrated a requirement for Ifnar1 in Ccl2 induction and IM recruitment (Conrady et al., 2013; Uyangaa et al., 2015) . Additionally, Ifnar1 \u00c0/\u00c0 or Stat1 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice but not Ifnlr1 \u00c0/\u00c0 or WT mice had a significant increase in MLN neutrophils following infection, suggesting that neutrophil recruitment depends on reduced activity of type I IFN ( Figures 3C and S3B ). Ifnar1 and Stat1 but not Ifnlr1 are required for controlling MNV replication in the MLN (Nice et al., 2018) , suggesting that neutrophil recruitment depends on robust viral replication. Neutrophils were equally recruited to MLN and PP of Stat1 \u00c0/\u00c0 or Stat1 \u00c0/\u00c0 /Ccr2 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice infected with CW3 D94E , whereas IMs were recruited significantly less well in PP of Stat1 \u00c0/\u00c0 /Ccr2 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice ( Figures 3D and 3E) . These data show that (1) CCR2 is important for IM recruitment, (2) CCR2 is dispensable for neutrophil recruitment, (3) type I IFN is dispensable for recruitment of IMs or neutrophils, and (4) Ifnar1 deficiency results in increased neutrophil recruitment.",

To determine whether IL-1 signaling was required for recruitment of IMs and neutrophils, we infected WT or Il1r1 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice with CW3 D94E and analyzed MLN and PP cellularity 2 days post infection. Recruitment of IMs did not differ significantly between infected WT and Il1r1 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice, and neutrophils were not significantly increased in either mouse strain ( Figure S3C ). Consistent with the presence of recruited IMs, infected Il1r1 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice did not have significant differences in Ccl2 upregulation relative to WT controls ( Figure S3D ). To determine whether IL-1a was sufficient for recruitment of IMs and neutrophils in our mice, we injected 200 ng of recombinant IL-1a intraperitoneally and characterized the cellularity of the peritoneal cavity 24 hr later. There was a significant increase in proportion of neutrophils isolated from IL-1a-injected WT mice relative to Il1r1 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice or PBS-injected controls, and a modest increase in the proportion of IMs from IL-1a-injected WT mice relative to IL-1a-injected Il1r1 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice ( Figure 3F ).

VP1 is divided into (1) a protruding domain that includes the receptor-binding region and (2) a shell domain that interfaces with the interior of the virion ( Figure 3G ). To define the relative contribution of these domains, we infected mice with CR6 chimeric in protruding or shell domains of VP1 CW3 and quantified IMs recruited to the MLN 48 hr later. CR6 with the protruding domain, but not the shell domain, from CW3 elicited a significant increase in IMs compared with uninfected controls ( Figure 3H ). These data indicate that the protruding domain, but not the shell domain, of CW3 is sufficient for IM recruitment. Importantly, these data also rule out a strain-specific role for the VF1 gene, which overlaps with the shell domain of the VP1 gene and was previously shown to regulate apoptosis (McFadden et al., 2011) .",

To determine whether recruited IMs and/or neutrophils were infected by MNV, we performed intracellular flow cytometry staining for MNV NS1-2, which is only expressed during active viral replication. We detected few NS1-2-positive cells in infected WT mice, which are relatively effective in controlling CW3 replication via type I IFN. However, in MLN and PP of Stat1 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice infected with CW3 D94E , we detected between 0.1% and 0.6% NS1-2positive cells (Figures 4A and 4B ). In contrast, we detected no NS1-2-positive cells above background in MLN and PP of all but one Stat1 \u00c0/\u00c0 mouse infected with CW3 D94E -VP1 CR6 ( Figures  4A and 4B ). The majority of CW3 D94E -infected cells ($70%) were either CD11b + myeloid cells ($40%) or CD19 + B cells ($20%) ( Figures 4C and 4D ). The majority of the CD11b + cells were also Ly6C + , including both IMs and neutrophils ( Figures 4C  and 4D ). Consistent with their high representation among infected cells, a significantly greater proportion of neutrophils and IMs were infected relative to CD11b + /Ly6C \u00c0 cells, B cells, or other cell types in the MLN and PP ( Figure 4E ). Immunofluorescence microscopy staining revealed numerous NS1-2/Gr-1 double-positive cells ( Figure 4F ), indicating infection of neutrophils or IMs. These data suggest that recruited IMs and neutrophils are preferred targets for MNV infection.",

Peritoneal infection increased IMs and neutrophils regardless of treatment group ( Figure 4G ), but IL-1a treatment resulted in a significantly greater proportion of neutrophils at 48 hr post infection compared with PBS-treated controls ( Figure 4G ). There was robust infection of IMs and neutrophils in both PBS and IL-1a groups, and the ability of MNV to infect these cells did not differ significantly between the groups ( Figure S4D ).

Antibodies against CCR2 depleted IMs but not neutrophils from the blood, whereas Gr-1 antibodies, at this dose, significantly depleted neutrophils but not IMs ( Figure 6B ). Brain, liver, lung, spleen, and MLN were collected for plaque assay 1 day after the final antibody injection to determine the effect of depletion on persistent, systemic viral titers. MNV plaque-forming units (PFU) were significantly decreased in the MLN and brain of IM-depleted mice, and in the MLN and lung of neutrophil-depleted mice ( Figure 6C) . Therefore, depleting cell types that are preferentially infected by CW3 (Figure 4) and are expanded during persistent infection ( Figures 5A and 5B) reduces systemic viral persistence. These data suggest that lytic cell death and associated inflammatory cytokine release during the course of CW3 infection is a pro-viral adaptation that sustains a pool of susceptible cells for continued infection. This mechanism of persistence may be a particularly useful adaptation for lytic viruses incapable of establishing latency.",

            "text": "We find that the capsid gene of MNV determines inflammatory cell death in vitro, with consequences for recruitment of targeted myeloid cells and systemic persistence in vivo. Companion studies by Bouziat et al. (2018) demonstrate that the capsid gene is additionally linked to loss of tolerance to oral antigens, which can be linked to inflammatory stimuli. To extend our understanding of these capsid-dependent immune responses, it will be important to determine the molecular mechanism by which the capsid alters cell death. The capsid of human and mouse noroviruses have been extensively studied regarding their attachment to carbohydrates (Tan and Jiang, 2005; Taube et al., 2012) , and the mouse norovirus capsid has been recently shown to directly bind the cellular receptor CD300lf (Haga et al., 2016; Orchard et al., 2016) . However, we observed no significant difference in genome replication in vitro ( Figures 1C and 1F) , suggesting that VP1-dependent cell death is regulated after entry and genome replication. In addition to its role in entry, the capsid interacts with the minor structural protein VP2, which may promote virion stability and direct packaging of the RNA genome (Vongpunsawad et al., 2013) . VP2 has also been reported to regulate maturation of antigen-presenting cells (Zhu et al., 2013) , and we observed a VP1-dependent difference in MHCII upregulation ( Figure S1C ), suggesting the possibility that VP1 determines inflammatory responses in conjunction with VP2. Additionally, it has been suggested that VP1 binds to acetylated tubulin, which is localized to the viral replication complex (Hyde et al., 2012) . Therefore, VP1 may alter the cellular response to infection by regulating the composition of the replication complex or efficiency of genome packaging. Future work will focus on identifying the specific regions and activities of the VP1 protein that account for differences seen here between CW3 and CR6. In addition, it will be important to determine whether VP1-dependent lytic cell death occurs through an active or passive mechanism.",

CR6 was isolated from the feces of mice within the Charles River mouse colony, whereas CW3 was isolated from brain tissue of Rag2 \u00c0/\u00c0 /Stat1 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice (Karst et al., 2003; Thackray et al., 2007) . With this in mind, we predict that other fecally derived strains of MNV, such as CR3 and MNV3 (Hsu et al., 2006; Thackray et al., 2007) , would phenocopy CR6 in terms of modest IM and neutrophil recruitment. The pro-viral role of Rag1 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice were infected with CW3 D94E for 21 days followed by daily intraperitoneal injection of 20 mg of depleting antibodies or isotype control for 5 days (A). The extent of IM and neutrophil depletion was determined by FACS analysis of blood cells (B), and viral titers were quantitated in the indicated tissues (C) by plaque assay. Data are from two to three experiments with points representing individual mice. Statistical significance was determined by Kruskal-Wallis test with Dunn's multiple-comparison test. *p % 0.05, ****p % 0.0001. myeloid cell recruitment in persistent systemic infection may reflect advantages of this recruitment for growth in the absence of STAT1 or adaptive immunity. Alternatively, myeloid cell recruitment could reflect the loss of adaptations required for persistent enteric shedding. If true, these findings emphasize the potential for rapid and impactful evolution of viruses in the context of immune-deficient hosts. It will be important to determine whether such evolutionary pressures result in novel adaptations of human noroviruses that can persist systemically in immune-deficient humans (Capizzi et al., 2011; Frange et al., 2012; Lemes et al., 2014; Saif et al., 2011; Westhoff et al., 2008; Woodward et al., 2017) . Further study of differing adaptations among norovirus strains in the intestine and systemic tissues will define host and viral factors governing the outcome of infection.",

            "text": "Neutrophils and monocytes recruited to sites of inflammation are key effectors of the antimicrobial response, preventing lethal infection with pathogenic bacteria and fungi (Dale et al., 2008) . We have found here that monocytes and neutrophils recruited to sites of MNV replication are targets of viral infection and have a pro-viral role in systemic persistence. Therefore, recruitment of inflammatory myeloid cells has the potential to promote, rather than resolve, viral infection. This pro-viral role in the MNV model is apparent in Rag1 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice, suggesting that such negative consequences of inflammation are particularly relevant for pathogens that effectively evade the adaptive immune response. Indeed, others have suggested that limited viral replication in antigen-presenting cells is beneficial for viral clearance through increased activation of adaptive immunity (Honke et al., 2012) . Additionally, our findings are conceptually related to prior description of ''Trojan horse'' phenomena whereby myeloid cells transport pathogens to new foci of infection (Crowe, 2003; Davis and Ramakrishnan, 2009; Drevets et al., 2004; Laskay et al., 2003) . However, in MNV infection we do not find a role for IMs and neutrophils in transport. Rather, we find that inflammatory cell recruitment can maintain replication in situ, boosting persistent viral titers. Obligate lytic viruses, such as MNV, are particularly dependent on continuous recruitment of target cells to sustain persistent infection. Some persistent human pathogens, including Zika and Chikingunya, are also obligate lytic viruses that may benefit from chronic inflammatory cell recruitment. Recent primate models of Zika virus infection indicate that monocytes are frequently infected during systemic persistence and inflammatory cytokines, including IL-1a, and neutrophils are elevated at sites of persistent replication (Aid et al., 2017; Hirsch et al., 2017; Nguyen et al., 2017) . Therefore, Zika virus or other persistent human pathogens may use a strategy similar to the one described here to persist in humans. Blocking monocyte recruitment or promoting resolution of inflammatory cytokine production (Fullerton and Gilroy, 2016) has the potential to reduce the persistent viral burden and spread of pathogens that utilize this persistence strategy.",

Red blood cells were lysed using red blood cell lysis solution (Sigma) and bone marrow from each mouse was cultured in 40 mL RPMI with 10% FCS, 1X Penicillin/Streptomycin/Glutamine solution, 1X HEPES solution, 1X Sodium Pyruvate, and 1X non-essential amino acids, and 20ng/mL GM-CSF obtained from supernatants GM-CSF-secreting cells (J558L, (Qin et al., 1997) ). After seven days of culture at 37 C and 5% CO 2 , non-adherent cells were collected, infected at an MOI of one with indicated MNV strains and 2 x 10 6 cells were plated per well in six well plates in 2 mL BMDC media without GM-CSF. Supernatants and cells were collected 24 hours post-infection for analysis.",
