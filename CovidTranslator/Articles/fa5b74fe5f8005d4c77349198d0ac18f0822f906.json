Previous studies show that the N-terminal ectodomain of M protein is modified by glycosylation, but its precise functions are yet to be thoroughly investigated. In this study, we confirm that N-linked glycosylation occurs at two predicted sites in the M protein ectodomain of infectious bronchitis coronavirus (IBV). Dual mutations at the two sites (N3D/N6D) did not affect particle assembly, virus-like particle formation and viral replication in culture cells. However, activation of the ER stress response was significantly reduced in cells infected with rN3D/N6D, correlated with a lower level of apoptosis and reduced production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Taken together, this study demonstrates that although not essential for replication, glycosylation in the IBV M protein ectodomain plays important roles in activating ER stress, apoptosis and proinflammatory response, and may contribute to the pathogenesis of IBV.",

The subgenomic mRNAs encode four structural proteins: the highly glycosylated spike protein (S), the small membrane-associated envelope protein (E), the integral membrane protein (M) and the phosphorylated nucleocapsid protein (N), are encoded by different subgenomic mRNAs (Masters, 2006) .

            "text": "Upon replication and transcription of viral RNA and translation of viral proteins, coronaviruses assemble and bud at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) (Klumperman et al., 1994; Stertz et al., 2007) . The particles are then transported in smooth-wall vesicles, trafficked via the secretory pathway, and finally release from cells by exocytosis. Coronavirus M protein plays a pivotal role during the assembly and budding processes (Masters, 2006; B\u00e1rcena et al., 2009; Neuman et al., 2011) . It is a multispanning membrane protein, consisting of a short amino terminus exposed on the exterior of the virion (the ectodomain), three hydrophobic transmembrane domains and a large carboxy-terminal region situated in the interior of the virion (Masters, 2006) . Current assembly model supports that this integral membrane protein may adopt a region of the intracellular membrane for virion assembly (Lim and Liu, 2001) . By interacting with other structural components, M protein would also be able to draw other structural proteins, such as S and E and ribonucleoprotein (RNP) into virions (Lim and Liu, 2001; Ye et al., 2004; Luo et al., 2006) . Meanwhile, a network of M-M interactions would result in the exclusion of host cell membrane proteins from the viral envelope (De Haan et al., 2000; Neuman et al., 2008) . The ectodomain, which is the least conserved region of M protein, is also glycosylated. Whereas M protein of some lineage A Betacoronaviruses, such as mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), bovine coronavirus and human coronavirus-OC43 (HCoV-OC43), is modified by O-linked glycosylation, M protein of other coronaviruses have been shown to be exclusively N-linked glycosylated (Holmes et al., 1981; Lapps et al., 1987; Mounir and Talbot, 1992; Hogue and Nayak, 1990; Utiger et al., 1995; Stern and Sefton, 1982; Dea et al., 1990) . Different functions have been assigned to the oligosaccharide side chains, including protein folding, structure stability, intracellular sorting, and the induction of immune response (Drickamer and Taylor, 1998; Helenius and Aebi, 2001; Fung and Liu, 2018) .",

IBV M protein contains 225 amino acids with three transmembrane domains (Binns et al., 1986; Rottier et al., 1986) . The N-terminal luminal domain consists of 20 amino acids (Cavanagh et al., 1986) , with two consensus sites for N-linked glycosylation near its N terminus at amino acid position 3 and 6, respectively (Fig. 1a) . Early studies confirmed that IBV M protein is modified by Nlinked oligosaccharides, as the glycosylated forms were no longer detectable in cells treated with tunicamycin, a specific inhibitor of Nlinked glycosylation (Stern and Sefton, 1982) . Interestingly, treatment of tunicamycin did not inhibit virion assembly, although these particles were essentially non-infectious (Stern and Sefton, 1982) .",

The result confirm that mutations in the IBV M glycosylation sites (N3D/N6D) did not affect particle assembly, virus-like particle (VLP) formation and IBV replication in cell culture. However, compared with the wild type control, activation of ER stress response, apoptosis, and induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines were all significantly reduced in cells infected with rN3D/N6D, although the in vivo virulence in terms of ELD50 was only marginally affected. Taken together, the data demonstrate that although glycosylation in the M ectodomain is not essential for IBV replication, it contributes to virushost interactions and viral pathogenesis.",

At 18 h post-transfection, the culture media were removed from cells and clarified by centrifugation. VLPs were isolated from the clarified media by centrifugation through a sucrose cushion.

The mutant M protein could form VLPs in a similar efficiency as wild type M protein, as shown by the presence of a similar amount of extracellular M (Fig. 4) , indicating that mutation of the Nlinked glycosylation sites in the N-terminal ectodomain of M protein does not affect VLP formation. Monolayers of Vero cells on a 6-well plate were infected with 100 \u00b5l of 1000fold diluted virus stocks and cultured in the presence of 0.5% carboxymethyl cellulose at 37\u00b0C for 3 days.

We have previously shown that IBV infection activates the PERK-eIF2\u03b1 and IRE1-XBP1 branches of the UPR signaling pathway. To determine whether N-linked glycosylation on the M protein may contribute to the IBV-induced ER stress, Vero cells were infected with WTrIBV or rN3D/N6D at MOI~2, respectively, and total RNA was harvested in a time-course experiment. RT-qPCR analysis revealed that the accumulation of IBV genomic RNA (gRNA) and subgenomic RNA2 (sgRNA2) was comparable in cells infected with WTrIBV and rN3D/N6D at the same time points, suggesting that mutations of the N-glycosylation sites did not affect the replication and transcription of IBV RNAs ( Fig. 5a and b) . In cells infected with WTrIBV, the mRNA levels of several ER stress-related genes, such as GRP78, CHOP, total XBP1 and spliced XBP1, were significantly upregulated at late stages (16 hpi onwards) of IBV infection. In contrast, induction of these genes was considerably lower in cells infected with rN3D/N6D (Fig. 5c-f) . A similar pattern was also observed in the expression profiles of two proinflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-8. Compared with the WTrIBV control, the induction of IL-6 and IL-8 at late stages of IBV infection was significantly dampened in cells infected with rN3D/N6D ( Fig. 5g and  h) .",

The effect of N3D/N6D mutation of IBV M protein on VLP assembly. COS-7 cells were infected with the recombinant vaccinia/T7 virus (vTF7-3) and transfected with a plasmid encoding wild type IBV E gene, together with a plasmid encoding M WT or M N3D/N6D , respectively. Intracellular cell lysates and pelleted extracellular VLPs were analyzed by Western blot with antisera against IBV M and E proteins. Fig. 5 . Induction ER stress response and pro-inflammatory cytokines in cells infected with WTrIBV or the rN3D/N6D mutant. Vero cells were infected with WTrIBV or rN3D/N6D at MOI~2 and cellular RNA was harvested in a time course experiment. The amounts of IBV genomic RNA (gRNA), IBV subgenomic mRNA2 (sgRNA2), ER stress-related genes and two proinflammatory cytokines were determined by RT-qPCR, using GAPDH as an internal control. The experiment was repeated three times with similar results, and the result of one representative experiment is shown. Fig. 6 . Induction of apoptosis in cells infected with WTrIBV or the rN3D/ N6D mutant. Vero cells were infected with WTrIBV or rN3D/N6D at MOI~2. Protein lysates were harvested at 18 hpi onwards in 2 h intervals and were subjected to Western blot analysis using the indicated antisera or antibodies. Beta-actin was included as the loading control. Sizes of protein ladders in kilo Dalton were indicated on the left.

To determine whether glycosylation on the M protein affects IBV-induced apoptosis, Vero cells were infected with WTrIBV or rN3D/ N6D at MOI~2, respectively, and harvested at 18 hpi onwards in 2 h intervals. As shown in Fig. 6 , most of the M protein is fully or partially glycosylated in cells infected with WTrIBV, whereas strictly no M glycosylation was observed in cells infected with rN3D/N6D. Similar amounts of IBV N protein were detected at the same time points for WTrIBV and rN3D/N6D, further confirming that mutations in the Nlinked glycosylation sites did not significantly affect IBV replication in Vero cells. To determine the induction of apoptosis, cleavage of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) was used as an apoptotic marker. PARP is a substrate of caspase 3, and the percentage of its cleavage from the full-length protein (116 kDa) to the cleaved form (89 kDa) has been widely used as a benchmark of apoptosis induction (Fung and Liu, 2017) . In cells infected with WTrIBV, significant PARP cleavage could be detected starting from 22 hpi, which remained at a considerable level until the end of the time course (Fig. 6) . In sharp contrast, only marginally detectable PARP cleavage was observed in cells infected with rN3D/N6D. This result suggests that N-linked glycosylation in the M protein may contribute to the induction of apoptosis during IBV infection.",

When expressed alone with a C-terminal FLAG-tag, SARS-CoV M protein acquired high-mannose N-glycans in the ER, which were modified into complex glycans in the Golgi (Nal et al., 2005) . However, SARS-CoV M protein in the infected cells and purified virions was later found to retain high-mannose N-glycans sensitive to endoglycosidase H, indicating that the maturation of N-linked glycans might be inhibited in cells infected with SARS-CoV (Voss et al., 2006) . In this study, we confirmed that M protein of the Vero-adapted Beaudette strain of IBV was glycosylated at N3 and N6. In both transiently transfected cells expressing M protein and IBV-infected cells, IBV M protein was predominantly present in a fully glycosylated form (glycosylated on both N3 and N6), while the partially (N3 or N6) glycosylated and the nonglycosylated form were the minor forms, suggesting that both N3 and N6 in the IBV M ectodomain are efficiently glycosylated in cell culture.",

Data presented in this study showed that recombinant IBV harboring mutations in both glycosylation sites of the M ectodomain (N3D/N6D) exhibited normal plaque morphology and replicated similarly as the wild type control. Furthermore, no obvious differences in the subcellular localization of M protein and the sedimental properties of the purified virus were not detected.

Although not as highly glycosylated as the S protein, M protein is the most abundant structural protein in the coronavirus particle as well as in the infected cells, and its glycosylation also depends on host modification enzymes in the ER lumen. In this study, we found that induction of GRP78, a well-characterized ER stress marker gene at the mRNA level was significantly impaired in cells infected with rN3D/N6D compared with the wild type control. Consistently, activation of the PERK and IRE branch of UPR was also impaired as indicated by the lower mRNA levels of the downstream effector gene CHOP and XBP1-spliced, compared to the cells infected with wild type virus. Notably, the reduced ER stress level also correlated with a decreased level of apoptosis and reduced induction of proinflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-8. These results suggest that N-linked glycosylation of the M ectodomain also contributes to the induction of ER stress response during IBV infection, resulting in a reduced level of IBV-induced apoptosis and a proinflammatory response.",

We have also overexpressed IBV M protein in Vero cells with or without vTF7-3 infection, but no significant induction of ER stress or IL-8 production was observed compared with the vector control (unpublished data). There are two possible explanations. First, the induction of ER stress and IL-8 production may require additional viral factors (such as S glycoprotein) produced during coronavirus infection. Secondly, the level of overexpressed M protein, even with the help of vTF7-3 infection, may not be as high as that in IBV-infected cells. Therefore, the involvement of M glycosylation in ER stress/IL-8 induction can only be determined during actual infection.",

            "text": "Although dispensable for virion assembly and in vitro infectivity, glycosylation of the M ectodomain was previously shown to play a role in coronavirus pathogenesis and/or replication in vivo. For example, the induction of type I interferon was significantly reduced in cells infected with glycosylation-deficient mutant of TGEV or MHV, compared with the wild type control (Laude et al., 1992; de Haan et al., 2003) . Also, although in vivo interferogenic capability was not affected, O-linked glycosylation-deficient mutant of MHV did not replicate as well in the liver of infected mice (de Haan et al., 2003) . In this study, we have observed a minor difference in the ELD50 between WTrIBV and rN3D/ N6D. It is uncertain that the differential induction of apoptosis and proinflammatory response observed in cell culture experiments may contribute to the slight difference observed in the in vivo virulence between wild type and the mutant viruses. More specific and sensitive approaches would be required to uncover the effect of M glycosylation on IBV replication and pathogenesis in vivo.",
