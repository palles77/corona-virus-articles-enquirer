Such variability in transmission also exists among species within a community (amplification hosts) and among habitat patches across a landscape (disease 'hotspots'), underscoring the need for an integrative framework for studying transmission heterogeneity. Here, we synthesize literature on human, plant, and animal diseases to evaluate the relative contributions of host, pathogen, and environmental factors in driving transmission heterogeneity across hosts and space. We show that host and spatial heterogeneity are closely linked and that quantitatively assessing the contribution of infectious individuals, species, or environmental patches to overall transmission can aid management strategies. We conclude by posing hypotheses regarding how pathogen natural history influences transmission heterogeneity and highlight emerging frontiers in the study of transmission heterogeneity.",

One of these infected guests was a flight attendant who was ultimately linked to more than 100 SARS cases in Singapore (WHO 2003) . Encapsulated within this account lies a key phenomenon that influences disease dynamics: heterogeneity in transmission among individuals and across space.

Furthermore, transmission heterogeneity also occurs across species and space, and host and spatial transmission heterogeneity can interact positively, with each facilitating heterogeneity in the other. A better understanding of such linkages may enhance our ability to identify the hosts and environments contributing disproportionately to transmission. In this paper, we consider the causes, consequences, and linkages between transmission heterogeneity across individuals, species, and environmental patches. We suggest mechanisms for how pathogen transmission mode may influence transmission heterogeneity across hosts and space, and we advocate a quantitative approach that will allow researchers and managers to determine the magnitude of transmission heterogeneity across hosts, species, and environments (Box 1). Finally, we offer future research directions (Box 2) that could provide a framework for understanding and managing transmission heterogeneity across hosts and space.",

When transmission events can be observed directly (e.g., through contact tracing), one approach is to estimate the effective reproductive number, R eff , (the average number of new infections resulting from an original infection) for a population, and then compare the number of secondary infections caused by individuals to a Poisson distribution with mean R eff (Lloyd-Smith et al. 2005 ).",

Each element of the R matrix describes transmission among one pair of host groups as the product of the mean infectious contact rate and the mean infectious period.

This entails determining the probability of observing the estimated value of A j by comparing it to the ratio of two distributions that have identical means equal to N j but possibly different variances as determined by the measurement error of (R 0,j /R 0 ) and N j . The most appropriate distribution for N j and (R 0,j /R 0 ) for this comparison will be an important problem for further study, but one possibility is to use beta distributions which are flexible and vary between 0 and 1. For non-vector borne pathogens, a priori quantification of importance is much more challenging, because of difficulties in empirically measuring the infectious contact rate among hosts. If possible, identifying measurable surrogates for infectious contact rates would aid discovery of host traits that are correlated with contact rates.",

            "text": "Epidemiologists typically determine whether a pathogen can invade a host population using the basic reproductive number (R 0 ). This value represents the average number of new infections caused by an infectious individual in an immunologically na\u00efve host population (Anderson and May 1991) . Subsequent work has shown that the intensity of macroparasitic infections (e.g. worms per individual) generally follows a negative binomial distribution with high skew (Shaw and Dobson 1995) , with more highly infected individuals potentially being responsible for more transmission events. A later study proposed the \"20/80\" rule, and showed that in a variety of disease systems, 20% of hosts were responsible for 80% of transmission events (Woolhouse et al. 1997 ). Thus, models allowing for heterogeneity in the distribution of the expected number of new infections an infectious individual produces (rather than using a single mean value, R 0 ) have transformed the epidemiological modeling of diseases by accounting for changes in disease dynamics that result from such heterogeneities (Lloyd-Smith et al. 2005) . Importantly, heterogeneous transmission also occurs in cases where amplification host species or environmental 'hotspots' contribute disproportionately to disease transmission within a community or landscape ( Fig. 1 ). Thus, one of the major goals of this paper is to extend the same principles underlying host transmission heterogeneity to understand landscape variability in disease risk.",

Factors such as genetic differences in host resistance or parasite virulence, and genotype-environment interactions can lead to individual transmission heterogeneity. For example, experimental inoculations of bay laurel leaves with Phytophthora ramorum, the fungal pathogen causing Sudden oak death, showed that individual trees varied substantially in genetic susceptibility (measured by mean lesion area) to the pathogen (Anacker et al. 2008) . Field observations, however, revealed that disease levels (measured as number of symptomatic leaves per tree) at the plot scale were primarily associated with local environmental differences in temperature and precipitation rather than genetic differences among hosts (Anacker et al. 2008) . Spatially aggregated parasite distributions in the environment can also give rise to heterogeneity among individuals by elevating infection intensity of individuals encountering microhabitats with high parasite loads (Brunner and Ostfeld 2008) .",

For vector-borne diseases, it has been hypothesized that hosts that infect more vectors are associated with an 'r-selected' (e.g., rapid turnover) life history strategy (Cronin et al. 2010) . For example, experimental exposure of six grass species to Barley Yellow Dwarf virus suggested that plants with a \"quick return\" phenotype (e.g., high leaf nitrogen, phosphorus, and metabolic rates) had increased host susceptibility, competence, and vector population sizes, likely because their leaves offered more resources for vector and pathogen growth and were generally more poorly-defended (Cronin et al. 2010) . Such hosts enhance the population of infected vectors, increasing infection risk for co-occuring host species. Species that tend to have high population densities or highly social behavior may also be at increased risk of contracting pathogens for which transmission is dependent on host density, due to higher contact rates (Altizer et al. 2003) . By elevating overall disease prevalence, such hosts can amplify transmission throughout multiple species communities.",

Using a definition analogous to that of superspreading individuals (Lloyd-Smith et al. 2005 ), a superspreading species can be identified by comparing the expected distribution of community-wide transmission events assuming homogenous transmission potential across hosts, with species responsible for more infections than the n th percentile of this distribution classified as superspreaders (e.g., Kilpatrick et al. 2006 ; Box 1). When identifying superspreading species, the transmission event of interest should be defined explicitly. This could include either transmission that is intra-or inter-specific, or to a host species of particular interest (e.g., humans or domestic animals), depending on the research or management objective. For WNV, Kilpatrick et al. (2006) demonstrated that robins are an example of a superspreading species, because the proportion of mosquitoes potentially infected by robins relative to the proportion of the host community that they represent is far greater than would be expected from random chance if the host community was homogenous (Box 1).",

Environmental hotspots are often characterized by conditions that facilitate either elevated pathogen survival or greater densities of amplification hosts (for diseases with density-dependent transmission) (Fig. 2) . For instance, Vibrio cholerae, the bacteria that causes cholera, can concentrate on water hyacinths, which enhance the pathogen's survival (Spira et al. 1981) , potentially leading to transmission hotspots in areas that have been heavily invaded by water hyacinth. Similarly, Farnsworth et al. (2005) found that chronic wasting disease (CWD) prevalence in Colorado mule deer populations was twice as high near human developments compared to more remote areas. This may have been caused by elevated deer densities which resulted from artificial feeding stations, small home ranges, and lack of predators in developed areas.",

Another testable hypothesis is that specific pathogen transmission modes are more commonly associated with certain types of transmission heterogeneity. For instance, host transmission heterogeneity may be more common for infections transmitted through vectors or direct host-to-host contact, because there are no intermediate transmission steps (e.g., to other obligate host species) to dilute the influence of variable contact rates, competence, or infectiousness on overall transmission. Environmental transmission heterogeneity may be more important for pathogens with density-dependent transmission or environmentally transmitted stages because transmission foci are often characterized by high host or pathogen densities.

            "text": "Interactions between host and spatial transmission heterogeneity are likely common, and could have implications for disease management. Logically, superspreaders create hotspots of transmission around them, and hosts in a disease hotspot by definition experience increased infection pressure compared to others in the population. For example, interspecific transmission heterogeneities in Lyme disease can theoretically lead to environmental hotspots because fragmented habitats often support a higher fraction of competent amplification hosts, which could increase disease risk (e.g., measured as nymph infection prevalence) in disturbed landscapes (LoGiudice et al. 2003) . Environmental 'hotspots' that occur due to temporary aggregation of hosts, for example, at a watering hole, could also facilitate individual superspreading by serving as a source location for infection of highly social individuals that disperse from the location and infect many others. Finally, heterogeneity occurs both among and within species, and amplification species may contain one or more superspreading individuals. For example, domestic dogs account for the majority of rabies cases in parts of rural Tanzania, and infected dogs vary substantially in their biting rates, such that in addition to being the dominant amplification host in the system, some domestic dogs account for a disproportionate number of rabies transmission events (Hampson et al. 2009 ). These patterns suggest that further developing a framework integrating transmission heterogeneity across hosts and space should be a priority for future research in disease ecology (Box 2).",

            "text": "Perhaps the most practical information about transmission heterogeneity from a management perspective is determining what surrogate measures may be useful for identifying the most infectious individuals, species and locations so that they can be targeted before infecting others. If, as hypothesized, contact rates play the largest role in transmission heterogeneity, then quantifying contact networks representing the set of interactions between nodes (e.g., individuals, species, or environments) could provide a surrogate measure for identifying potential superspreaders (e.g., Keeling and Eames 2005, Fig . 3 ), particularly if traits characteristic of the highest-contact nodes can be identified. Importantly, specific characteristics, such as the duration of infectiousness and contacts must be considered to determine the role of high contact nodes (e.g., Craft et al. 2010) . Additionally, because infectiousness frequently co-varies with susceptibility (Lloyd-Smith et al. 2008; Hudson et al. 2008) , another surrogate indicator for identifying possible superspreaders and amplification hosts could involve measures of susceptibility such as body condition, testosterone, or immunocompetence . Identifying the most infectious hosts before they infect others offers a superior management strategy to post-hoc analyses that detect such hosts from infection rates, yet recognizing these individuals and determining the probability that they will become infected can be challenging. Intriguingly, advanced tools such as therapeutic interfering particles which inhibit pathogen growth, can eliminate the challenges of identifying superspreaders a priori because they are transmitted among hosts along with the pathogen, naturally making their way to the most high risk populations (Metzger et al. 2011) . Further exploration of such tools in conjunction with research focused on measuring other possible surrogate measures of transmission heterogeneity and identifying when such surrogate measures fail or are pathogen-specific will offer insight into factors that may be easier and more cost-effective for managers to observe.",

Importantly, heterogeneities in transmission among hosts and across space are intimately linked (Fig. 2) , and a better understanding of these linkages will be a significant advance. Addressing critical questions about when host and spatial transmission heterogeneities are stochastically generated or temporally variable, and what the implications are for disease dynamics and host-pathogen evolution will require integration of modeling and empirical approaches (Box 2). Given the growing influence of anthropogenic environmental change on disease risk for humans, plants, and animals, focusing research efforts towards developing an integrative theory for understanding transmission heterogeneity across scales will be of use for ecologists, public health officials, and wildlife managers.",
