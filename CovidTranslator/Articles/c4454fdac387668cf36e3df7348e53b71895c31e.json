Much higher losses may occur where husbandry and management are poor. There are many reasons why the young calf is particularly susceptible to disease. Its immunological defense mechanisms are not fully developed. It will be going through the transition from passive to active immunity. The abomasum is less acidic, especially in the first few days of life, and this reduces the rate of kill of enterobacteriaciae and other ingested organisms. The calf may have several changes of diet. Moreover, the navel provides an additional early route by which infection may enter the body. Many calf diseases are exacerbated by failure to provide adequate housing, management, or colostral intake.",

A wide range of agents can be involved, some producing diarrhea with or without dehydration, others leading to systemic involvement. Diarrhea in the first few days of life is commonly caused by bacterial infections, for example, E. coli or Clostridium perfringens. Their toxins lead to hypersecretion from the intestine and subsequent fluid loss, seen as diarrhea. Viral infections (rotavirus and coronavirus) and Cryptosporidia typically occur at 10-14 days (as maternal colostral antibody wanes), and are considered the major causes of calf scour. Diarrhea occurs because the intestinal wall is damaged, preventing resorption of fluid. Salmonella scouring can occur at any age.",

It commonly results from feeding errors that lead to incomplete esophageal groove closure. Milk entering the rumen ferments and produces bloat with severe colic. Most incidents have a high morbidity but low mortality. The 4-week-old Hereford cross calf (2.38) shows severe ruminal tympany, with soiling of the tail and perineum, associated with chronic diarrhea which often accompanies the condition. Bloat also occurs in older cattle (see 4.61).",
