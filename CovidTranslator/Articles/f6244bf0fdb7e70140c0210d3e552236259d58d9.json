A series of unprecedented public health interventions enforced in the entire country has contributed to effectively containing the spread of the novel coronavirus in China. [3] [4] [5] In Italy, the first case was detected on February 20 th 2020 but the peak time has not passed yet (as of March 22 nd ), despite a series of gradually enhanced public health interventions. 6, 7 While the stringent package of intervention measures implemented in China may be considered as unsustainable in other countries, the epidemic trajectory in Italy may provide a baseline for Canada to project its infection risk and COVID-19 generated disease burden under feasible scenarios of public health interventions due to substantial similarity of demographic profiles and public health capacity.",

This estimated growth rate is consistent using datasets of cumulative cases, cumulative deaths, daily hospitalizations and daily ICU, suggesting that the bias resulted from detection strategy and under-reporting does not have a major effect, see Figure 2 . Using the growth rate of 0.25 (estimated in Canada) and the growth rate of 0.1 (estimated in Italy two weeks after its first lockdown), we project the epidemic trend in Canada for 10 days following March 21 st and plot the projections of both daily and cumulative cases in Figure 3 . We predict more than 15,000 total infections on March 31 st in the first (and the worst) scenario. Total infections are reduced to 4,000 in the second scenario, if further public health interventions, similar to closure of non-essential activities, are taken immediately to reduce the growth rate by more than half. Assuming a hospitalization rate similar to the one observed in Italy, we expect daily hospitalizations to be approximately 40% of the cumulative cases (cf. Figure 2) . We therefore predict a number between 1,500 and 6,500 hospitalized by March 31 st , see Figure 3 .",

Canada can capitalize on the \"Italian experience\": the epidemic growth rate in Italy has been significantly reduced after implementing and enforcing the closure of all non-essential activities. If the measures taken by the Canadian government would allow to reduce immediately the growth rate by half, the case number could be reduced to about 4,000 by the end of the month (this estimate does not incorporate any case influx from the USA). It is anyway of fundamental importance to consider the delay, which may be as large as two weeks, before intervention measures have a concrete mitigation effect.",

Considering the delayed effect of intervention measures and the hospital bed shortage, it is imperative to take prompt actions to reduce the epidemic growth rate and to avoid to overwhelm the capacity of the Canadian health system. However, our study is not without limitations. We stress that the growth estimates for the Canadian trends are based on a limited amount of data. In particular, the lack of detailed data on COVID-19 hospitalization in Canada makes it difficult to compare the severity observed in the two countries. Although not mathematically sophisticated, this preliminary analysis is transparent, data driven and represents a sanity check for more complex models. ",
