This is the first report of HEV proliferation in cultured neurons. These results provide sufficient evidence that HEV is a neurotropic virus. The lower titre of the virus in the lung ofi.n.-inoculated newborn mice than in the CNS may have been due to the uptake of virus by pulmonary macrophages or epithelial cells. It is probable that the HEV strain used had become more neurotropic for mice as a result of mouse brain passage. It would be interesting to ascertain whether its powers of propagation in pig brain had increased.",

Both NB41A3 and Neuro-2a have been independently established by cloning from a neuroblastoma (C-1300) in a strain A albino mouse, and both have retained the characteristics of neuroblastoma cells (Hay el al., 1988) . However, there are substantial differences between them. For instance, NB41A3 cells secrete ace@choline esterase together with the enzymes for the synthesis of the neurotransmitters, choline acetylase and tyrosine hydroxylase, as adrenergic neuron (Hay el al., 1988) , whereas Neuro-2a has not been shown to secrete these enzymes. Recently, Schultze el al. (1990) reported that I-IEV attached to an N-acetyl-9-O-acetylneuraminic acid-containing receptor which was destroyed by acetylesterase. These enzymes of NB41A3 might be related to the difference in HEV propagation between the two lines of neuroblastoma cells.",

The present study shows additional differences between infected newborn and adult mice, particularly in the distribution of HEV antigen in the layers of the cerebral cortex. These findings resemble those ofOgata et al. (1991) in rats infected with Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV). These authors suggested that the neurotropism of JEV was dependent on the degree of neuronal maturation in the cortex, which paralleled a particular pattern of disappearance of antigen from the inner layers to the outer layers of the cortex. Further work is needcd to elucidate the relation between age-dependency of HEV infection and neuronal maturation, and localization of receptors on susceptible cells.",
