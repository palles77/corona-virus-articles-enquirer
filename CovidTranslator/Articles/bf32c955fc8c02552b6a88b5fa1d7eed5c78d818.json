We present the results of a simulation study that opens some new research tensions on the impact of COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) on the global SCs. First, we articulate the specific features that frame epidemic outbreaks as a unique type of SC disruption risks. Second, we demonstrate how simulation-based methodology can be used to examine and predict the impacts of epidemic outbreaks on the SC performance using the example of coronavirus COVID-19 and anyLogistix simulation and optimization software. We offer an analysis for observing and predicting both short-term and long-term impacts of epidemic outbreaks on the SCs along with managerial insights. A set of sensitivity experiments for different scenarios allows illustrating the model's behavior and its value for decision-makers. The major observation from the simulation experiments is that the timing of the closing and opening of the facilities at different echelons might become a major factor that determines the epidemic outbreak impact on the SC performance rather than an upstream disruption duration or the speed of epidemic propagation. Other important factors are lead-time, speed of epidemic propagation, and the upstream and downstream disruption durations in the SC. The outcomes of this research can be used by decisionmakers to predict the operative and long-term impacts of epidemic outbreaks on the SCs and develop pandemic SC plans. Our approach can also help to identify the successful and wrong elements of risk mitigation/preparedness and recovery policies in case of epidemic outbreaks. The paper is concluded by summarizing the most important insights and outlining future research agenda.",

Unlike other disruption risks, the epidemic outbreaks start small but scale fast and disperse over many geographic regions. Recent examples include SARS, MERS, Ebola, Swine flu, and most recently, coronavirus (COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2).",

Moreover, 938 of the Fortune 1000 companies have tier-one or tier-two suppliers in the Wuhan region (Dun and Bradsteet, 2020) . Linton and Vakil (2020) show on the example of data obtained through the Resilinc system that the world's largest 1,000 SCs own more than 12,000 facilities (i.e., factories, warehouses and other operations) in COVID-19\u2032s quarantine areas. More adversely, the coronavirus causes simultaneous disturbances in both supply and demand.

Johanis (2007) reported on a pandemic response plan developed at Toronto Pearson International Airport following the consequences of SARS epidemic outbreak D. Ivanov Transportation Research Part E 136 (2020) 101922 in 2002-2003. SARS has adversely affected the airline industry, especially in Taiwan when around 30% of international flights have been suspended (Chou et al., 2004) . Though, the globalization degree and the role of China in the global SCs at the times of SARS were different to the current situation, and the impacts of SARS on the SCs have been relatively low. Ebola virus spread has negatively impacted the global logistics (BSI, 2014) . Calnan et al. (2018) and Esra B\u00fcy\u00fcktahtak\u0131n et al. (2018) describe the lessons learned during the Ebola times and point to a need of building a decision-support framework which would help predicting the impacts of epidemic outbreaks on the SCs and coordinating the operational and logistics policies during and after the crisis. It is intuitively to expect decreases in operative performance (e.g., EBIT), material shortages, and price fluctuations during epidemic outbreaks. This confirms the analysis of coronavirus-related reports. For example, German Post declared an EBIT reduction in the range between 60 and 70 million euro; retail prices in China raised in February 2020 by 21.9% at average (Bild, 2020) . On February 17, Apple announced to expect its quarterly earnings to drop (Apple, 2020). By late February 2020, the COVID-19 outbreak had rendered almost 9% of container shipping fleets inactive and Chinese manufacturing indices hit their lowest point since the Great Recession as a result of suspending the manufacturing operations to stem the spread of COVID-19 (Retaildive, 2020) .",

Besides, detailed control policies can be analysed subject to a variety of financial, customer, and operational performance indicators (Li et al., 2019 , Pavlov et al., 2019a , Ivanov, 2020 . The simulation models consider logical and randomness constraints, such as randomness in disruptions, inventory, production, sourcing, and shipment control policies, and gradual capacity degradation and recovery . Since simulation studies deal with time-dependent parameters, duration of recovery measures, and capacity degradation and recovery, they have earned an important place in academic research. Simulation has the advantage that it can extend the handling of the complex problem settings of optimization through situational behavior changes in the system over time.",

The producers deliver the lightning equipment via ship and multi-modal (truck-train) transportation paths to the DCs in the USA, Brazil, and Germany with an average transportation time of 30 days. From there, goods are shipped to the customers. In the USA, the distribution is organized either directly to customers from main DC in Houston, or via four regional DCs. There are 95 customers in total all over the world. They all order at DCs every 5 days with expected lead-time (ELT) between 4 and 9 days. In other words, if the order is delivered within a frame between 4 and 9 days, it is considered as on-time delivery; if later -as delayed delivery. The delayed deliveries negatively impact the ELT service level which is a fraction of on-time delivered orders to the total number of orders. The demand is deterministic and between 4 and 80 units per order depending on the customer. The assumption of the deterministic demand can be justified as follows. First, the demand volatility for lightning equipment is indeed low. Second, our main objective is to uncover the impact of disruption and we therefore would like to omit other variations as the model as much as possible. The facilities operate at some fixed and variable costs including inventory holding costs, overhead costs, and processing costs. We omit the detailed presentation of all input data due to the limited length of the paper and refer the reader to the model \"SIM Global Network Examination\" which is supplied with anyLogistix software and can be seen and run in every anyLogistix version, even in the PLE edition.",

The SC is characterized by partial visibility, i.e., the demand of an upstream echelon is visible for the downstream echelon. The markets generate orders to the DC according to their demand which is normally distributed. The DCs and producers exhibit the s,S inventory control policy and place the orders at the factory. Production is controlled by the parameters of inventory control policy. The factories also exhibit the s,S inventory control policy.

These KPIs are used to assess the SC reaction to the epidemic outbreak.",

With that said, a difference in SC reaction can be observed when comparing the speed of the epidemic propagation and the duration of epidemic cases downstream the SC. More specifically, the longer delays in epidemic propagation (i.e., 60 days vs. 30 days) and shorter disruption duration downstream the SC (i.e., the scenario with 45 days disruption in China, 60 days in epidemic outbreak delay, and 45 days disruption duration downstream the SC) result in the lowest performance degradation. However, in case of longer disruptions in China, the longer epidemic propagation downstream the SC does not bring any positive effect (cf. scenarios with 60 days of disruption durations in the scenario II). At the same time, we can again observe a positive effect of slowing down the epidemic propagation in the case of very long disruption in China of 90 days. Moreover, the SC performs better for all KPIs in the case of a 90 days disruption in China and the longer epidemic propagation downstream the SC as compared to the case of the scenario I without any epidemic propagation.

The longer lasting demand disruptions also contribute to further performance decreases. Moreover, we can observe that longer delays in disruption propagation and longer lasting disruptions downstream the SC are more dangerous as the disruption duration upstream the SC (e.g., cf. in scenario III the case with 90 days disruption in China, 30 days delay in epidemic propagation, 45 days of disruption at downstream facilities and 45 days of demand disruption with the case of 45 days disruption in China, 60 days delay in epidemic propagation, 90 days of disruption at downstream facilities and 90 days of demand disruption). A positive effect can be observed when the timing of facility recovery at different echelons in the SC is synchronized. For example, in the case with 60 days disruption in China, 30 days delay in epidemic propagation, 45 days of disruption at downstream facilities and 45 days of demand disruption, we have a situation when the Chinese production stops on January 25, the DCs downstream close on February 25, the production in China is resumed on March 25, and the DC operations are resumed on April 10. This results in high profits, service level, and short lead times along with quite low total SC disruption time. The corresponding SC performance dynamics for this case is depicted in Fig. 5 .",

Unlike other disruption risks, the epidemic outbreaks start small but scale fast and disperse over many geographic regions creating a lot of unknowns which makes it difficult to fully determine the impact of the epidemic outbreak on the SC and the right measures to react.

The understanding and progressing the research of how all these technologies can be used to operate the SCs in a resilient way in cases of epidemic outbreaks is an important future research area (Choi et al., 2017 (Choi et al., , 2019 Choi and Lambert, 2017b , Dubey et al., 2019a , Ganasegeran and Abdulrahman, 2020 , Queiroz and Wamba, 2019 , Yoon et al., 2019 .

The most negative impact on the SC performance is observed in the cases with very long facility and demand disruption durations downstream the SC regardless of the disruption period in the upstream part.How long is the SC disruption timeThe total SC disruption time is about 30% longer as an upstream disruption duration; the SC disruption time is proportional to the length of an upstream disruptionThe longer delays in the epidemic outbreaks increase the total SC disruption time; faster disruption propagation and shorter disruption durations downstream the SC reduce the total SC disruption timeSimultaneous disruptions in downstream demand and supply may have positive effect on the total SC disruption time due to backlog reductions. Longer delays in disruption propagation and long-lasting disruptions downstream the SC are more dangerous as the disruption duration upstream the SC.
