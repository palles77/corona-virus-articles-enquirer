How to face this new coronavirus epidemic outbreak is an important issue. Basic reproduction number (R0) is an important parameter in epidemiology; The basic reproduction number of an infection can be thought of as the expected number of cases directly generated by one case in a population where all individuals are susceptible to infection. Epidemiology dynamics is a mathematical model based on a susceptibility-infection-recovery epidemic model. Researchers analyzed the epidemiological benefits of different transmission rates for the establishment of effective strategy in prevention and control strategies for epidemic infectious diseases. In this review, the early use of TCM for light and ordinary patients, can rapidly improve symptoms, shorten hospitalization days and reduce severe cases transformed from light and normal. Many TCM formulas and products have wide application in treating infectious and non-infectious diseases. The TCM theoretical system of treating epidemic diseases with TCM and the treatment scheme of integrated Chinese and Western medicine have proved their effectiveness in clinical practice. TCM can cure COVID-19 pneumonia, and also shows that the role of TCM in blocking the progress of COVID-19 pneumonia.",

Two hundred patients were divided into control group and treatment group with 100 cases in each group. The control group was treated with arbidol while the observation group was treated with SFJDC. The course of treatment was 2 weeks. The symptoms of fever and cough, white blood cell count, lymphocyte percentage and chest CT manifestations were compared between the two groups. After treatment, the white blood cell count, lymphocyte percentage and chest CT were significantly improved in the two groups (P < 0.05). The improvement in the observation group was better than that in the control group (P < 0.05). Fever regression time in observation group was shorter than that in control group (P < 0.05). The total effective rate of the observation group was 88%, higher than 75% of the control group (P < 0.05). SFJDC has a good antiviral effect, and has a good effect on respiratory system symptoms such as fever, cough, chest tightness and shortness of breath. Combined with abidor in the treatment of mild NPC, it can significantly increase the percentage level of white blood cells and lymphocytes in patients' blood routine and make chest CT infection foci absorb obviously. TCM can participate in prevention and treatment in the whole process and in all directions, complementing the advantages of chemical drug and improving the curative effect. In this clinical observation, the adverse reactions of SFJDC are less and can be better popularized clinically. Later, large sample and multi-center research are needed to obtain more evidence-based medical evidence to further guide clinical treatment. Wang et al (2020) reported here the clinical characteristics and therapeutic procedure for four patients with mild or severe COVID-19 pneumonia admitted to Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center. All the patients were given antiviral treatment including lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra), arbidol, and SFJDC, a TCM product and other necessary support care. After treatment, three patients gained significant improvement in pneumonia associated symptoms, two of whom were confirmed SARS-1 negative and discharged, and one of whom was virus negative at the first test. The remaining patient with severe pneumonia had shown signs of improvement by the cutoff date for data collection. Results obtained in the current study may provide clues for treatment of 2019-nCoV pneumonia. In clinical study, two mild and two severe COVID-19 pneumonia patients were given combined Chinese and Western medicine treatment, three of whom gained significant improvement in pneumonia associated symptoms. The remaining patient with severe pneumonia has shown signs improvement by the cutoff date for data collection. The efficacy of antiviral treatment including lopinavir/ritonavir, arbidol, and SFJDC warrants further verification in future study.",

Their observations have interesting implications for the development of novel therapeutic drugs using peptidases as entry receptor (Heurich et al., 2014) .

The centers for disease control in the area provided the homogeneous purified total RNA from a throat swab taken from a patient with severe acute respiratory syndrome. These results suggest that TF2B and TF3 compounds (Fig. 5 ) may be a good starting point for the design of a more effective 3CL Pro inhibitor encoded by SARS-CoV. It is necessary to further study the inhibitory effect of these natural products on SARS-CoV replication in cell culture (Chen et al, 2005) . Researchers suggested that attention should be paid to the clinical treatment of SARS-Cov-2 patients infected with pneumonia (The observer, 2020), and 30 drugs that may be effective against SARS-CoV-2 were also found, such as the chemical components in Chinese medicinal materials such as Chinese knotwort (Polygonum cuspidatum Siebold & Zucc) and Rhizoma Alba (Atractylodes macrocephala Koidz.).
