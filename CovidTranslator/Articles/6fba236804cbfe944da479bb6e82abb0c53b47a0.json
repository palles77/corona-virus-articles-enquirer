            "text": "Newcastle disease virus (NDV) causes a highly contagious and economically important disease in poultry. Viral determinants of NDV virulence are not completely understood. The amino acid sequence at the protease cleavage site of the fusion (F) protein has been postulated as a major determinant of NDV virulence. In this study, we have examined the role of F protein cleavage site sequence in NDV virulence using reverse genetics technology. The sequence G-R-Q-G-R present at the cleavage site of the F protein of avirulent strain LaSota was mutated to R-R-Q-K-R, which is present in the F cleavage site of neurovirulent strain Beaudette C (BC). The resultant mutated LaSota V.F. virus did not require exogenous protease for infectivity in cell culture, indicating that the F protein was cleaved by intracellular proteases. The virulence of the mutant and parental viruses was evaluated in vivo by intracerebral pathogenicity index (ICPI) and intravenous pathogenicity index (IVPI) tests in chickens. Our results showed that the modification of the F protein cleavage site resulted in a dramatic increase in virulence from an ICPI value of 0.00 for LaSota to a value of 1.12 for LaSota V.F. However, the ICPI value of LaSota V.F. was lower than that of BC, which had a value of 1.58. Interestingly, the IVPI tests showed values of 0.00 for both LaSota and LaSota V.F. viruses, compared to the IVPI value of 1.45 of BC. In vitro characteristics of the viruses were also studied. Our results demonstrate that the efficiency of cleavage of the F protein plays an important role if the NDV is delivered directly into the brains of chicks, but there could be other viral factors that probably affect peripheral replication, viremia, or entry into the central nervous system. q",

It causes a serious respiratory and neurological disease in all species of birds and is an economically important infectious agent, causing substantial losses to the poultry industry. Newcastle disease varies in the degree of severity, ranging from an inapparent infection to severe disease causing 100% mortality. NDV strains cause a continuous spectrum of disease and can be categorized into three main pathotypes depending on the severity of disease produced in chickens. Strains of low virulence, known as the lentogenic strains, cause mild or inapparent disease in birds. Mesogenic strains are viruses with intermediate virulence, which cause respiratory and/or neurological signs. Highly virulent NDV strains causing high mortality in birds are called velogenic. Velogenic strains can be further sub-divided into two categories: viscerotropic velogenic strains that produce lethal infections in which hemorrhagic lesions are prominent; and neurotropic velogenic strains that produce high mortality preceded by neurological signs, with the absence of hemorrhagic lesions [2] .",

            "text": "The genome of NDV is a single stranded negative-sense RNA consisting of 15,186 nucleotides [3] . The genomic RNA contains six genes that encode at least seven proteins [4, 5] . The envelope of NDV contains two glycoproteins, the hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) and fusion (F) proteins. The HN glycoprotein is involved in attachment and release of virus and the F glycoprotein mediates fusion of the viral envelope with cellular membranes [6] . Mutational analysis has shown that the fusion peptide and the adjacent heptad repeat region play a role in the fusion activity of F protein [7] . This protein is synthesized as a precursor, F 0 , which must be proteolytically cleaved to F 1 and F 2 to activate fusion [6, 8] . Cleavage of the F protein is known to be required for initiation of infection and is considered to be a major determinant of NDV virulence. Cleavage of the F protein of virulent NDV strains occurs by ubiquitous subtilisin-like proteases such as furin, PC6 and PACE 4; whereas, cleavage in avirulent strains occurs by trypsin-like enzymes found in limited tissues [9] .",

The replication of rBC, rLaSota, and rLaSota V.F. viruses in the brains of 1day-old chicks after intracerebral inoculation was measured (Fig. 3) . The rBC and rLaSota V.F. viruses initiated new virus formation after one day of infection. However, the yields of rBC virus were 100-fold higher than those of rLaSota V.F. virus. By day 4, all birds inoculated with rBC were dead. The replication kinetics of rLaSota virus was delayed and the virus yields were lower than those of rBC and rLaSota V.F. viruses. These results suggested that intracellular cleavage of the F protein is important for replication of NDV in the brains of chicks, but, probably, other viral factors are necessary for efficient replication.

It was found that the rBC virus grew faster and induced a more rapid cytopathic effect at 41.5 8C (body temperature of chickens) than at 37 8C (Fig. 4A ). To prove that the growth temperature does play a role in replication kinetics, we tested the growth of Plaque size and morphology of rBC, rLaSota and rLaSota V.F. The viruses were serially diluted and 100 ml of each serial dilution was added per well to confluent DF1 cells in 12-well plates. Duplicate wells were used for each serial dilution of every virus sample. After 60 min adsorption, cells were overlaid with DMEM (containing 2% fetal bovine serum and 0.9% methyl cellulose) and incubated at 37 8C for 3-4 days. The cells were then fixed with ethanol and stained with crystal violet for observation of plaques. neurovirulent rBC virus by a multi-step growth curve in Vero cells at 37 and 41.5 8C. The results showed that the rBC virus replicated to higher titers at 41.5 8C than at 37 8C (Fig. 4B ). The rBC virus also produced more cytopathic effects in chicken neuronal cells at 41.5 8C than at 37 8C, as evidenced by the destruction of the cell monolayers (Fig. 5A) . Our results showed that chicken neuronal cells are more susceptible to rBC than Vero cells. At 41.5 8C, rBC in chicken neuronal cells grew to higher titers at 24 h postinfection. At 48 h and 56 h post-infection the rBC titer in chicken neuronal cells was lower at 41.5 8C, because most of the cells were destroyed at this temperature and at these time points. Hemadsorption (HAd) studies revealed higher HAd of rBC and rLaSota V.F. viruses at 41.5 8C than at 37 8C. HAd activity of rBC at 41.5 8C was 128% when compared to its activity at 37 8C (100% HAd activity), while rLaSota V.F. had a HAd activity of 14% at 37 8C and 70% at 41.5 8C. Virus-binding studies with purified biotinylated virus in a streptavidin-colloidal gold amplification system indicated that the binding of chicken neuronal cells by rBC was significantly higher than rLaSota V.F. (Fig. 5B ).",

The ICPI results showed that the modification of the F protein cleavage site resulted in a dramatic increase in virulence from ICPI value of 0.00 for rLaSota to ICPI value of 1.12 (out of a maximum possible value of 2.0) for rLaSota V.F. However, the virulence of rLaSota V.F. was lower than that of rBC virus (ICPI value of 1.58). Surprisingly, the results obtained by IVPI tests showed a different pattern. The rBC virus had an IVPI value of 1.45 (out of a maximum possible value of 3.00), but the IVPI values of rLaSota V.F. and rLaSota viruses were 0.00. These results demonstrated that the efficiency of cleavage of the F protein plays an important role if the NDV is delivered directly into the brains of chicks, but there could be other viral factors that probably affect peripheral replication, viremia, or entry into the central nervous system. The efficiency of attachment may, in part, determine the virulence, as indicated by our virus binding studies. To compare the pathogenesis of rBC, rLaSota and rLaSota V.F. viruses, 3-week-old chickens were infected intranasally with 10 3 plaque forming units (PFU) of virus. The virus distribution in different tissues of the inoculated birds are presented in Fig. 6 . The rBC virus first appeared by day 3 in the blood, lungs, spleen and brain, and by day 5, the virus was undetectable in the blood. In the lungs, rBC grew to higher titers (500-fold) on day 5, but the titer was significantly reduced on day 7. It is possible that the humoral antibody IgA, which appears on day 5 postinfection and plays a major role in virus clearance in the respiratory tract, may be responsible for the decrease in virus titer seen on day 7. The rLaSota V.F. virus appeared by day 5 in the lungs and spleen, and in the blood by day 7, but was never detected in the brain. The rLaSota virus was detected only in the lungs by day 5. Sections of brain were also evaluated for the presence of viral RNA by in situ hybridization, using an antisense NP-specific 35 S-labeled riboprobe (Fig. 7A) . We found that only rBC virus exhibited focal areas of viral infection in the brain by days 5 and 7. These areas were mostly found in the cerebellum.",

Fewer basic amino acids are present in the F protein cleavage site of lentogenic NDV strains than in the proteins of either mesogenic or velogenic NDV strains, which have a similar multi-basic cleavage site sequence [11, 13] . Recently, using reverse genetics techniques, others have also observed that changing the F protein cleavage site of an avirulent NDV strain to the consensus F protein cleavage site of virulent strains only slightly increased the virulence [14] . These results indicated that cleavage efficiency is not the sole determinant governing NDV neurovirulence. The idea that 'cleavability' of the viral penetration protein is not necessarily the major determinant of virulence is illustrated by the recent sequence analysis of the 1918 influenza pandemic virus, which showed that this highly virulent virus did not have a 'highly cleavable' HA protein and, hence, the determinants of virulence lay elsewhere and remain to be identified [15] .",

Although the biological activities of the fusion protein and growth characteristics of the virus in vivo improved over the avirulent parental strain, the complete spectrum of virulence phenotype could not be achieved by modifying the F cleavage site. Our results demonstrate that the efficiency of cleavage of the F protein plays an important role if the NDV is delivered directly into the brains of chicks, but there are other viral factors that probably affect peripheral replication, viremia, or entry into the CNS. There have been several reports of proteins, such as the HN, V, W and C proteins of NDV and other paramyxoviruses, being responsible for virus virulence [16 -18] . Many studies showing the requirement of the HN protein in fusion along with the F protein suggest the importance of interaction of these two viral proteins in influencing viral infectivity [19] . The role of HN in affecting virus pathotype is seen in lentogenic and avirulent NDV strains, like Ulster, which have a longer reading frame consisting of 616 amino acids, as opposed to the neurovirulent, mesogenic strain BC, which has a shorter reading frame of 577 amino acids in the HN protein [10] . The hemagglutinin protein of measles virus has molecular determinants important for neurovirulence of the virus [20] .

In addition, this natural host system will provide a setting for identifying new ways to produce attenuated viruses as candidate vaccines.",

In this study, the full-length antigenomic cDNAs of LaSota and BC were designated as pLaSota and pBC, respectively. The F protein cleavage site of lentogenic and avirulent NDV strain LaSota was altered and made identical to the F protein cleavage site of mesogenic and neurovirulent NDV strain BC. The amino acid sequence G-R-Q-G-R present at the cleavage site of the F protein of avirulent NDV strain LaSota was altered to R-R-Q-K-R, to be analogous to the cleavage site of the F protein of neurovirulent strain BC (Fig. 1) . This was done by subcloning the Sac II-Not I fragment from pLaSota into a plasmid vector, pGEM-7Z (\u00fe ) (Promega, Madison, WI). This subclone was designated Sac II-Not I pLaSota 7Z. The F cleavage site of pLasota was then made identical to that of pBC by site-directed mutagenesis [34] , with phosphorylated forward primer (5 0 -4886 aaaCGCtTTATAGGCGCCATTATTGGCG 4913 -3 0 ) and phosphorylated reverse primer (5 0 -4885 CTGTCTCCtC-CCTCCAGATGTAGT 4862 -3 0 , lower case representing mutation), on Sac II-Not I pLaSota 7Z. The mutated fragment was digested with Sac II and Not I restriction enzymes and inserted back into pLaSota. The resultant mutated pLaSota was called pLaSota V.F. To confirm the presence of the desired mutations at the F cleavage site and the absence of any undesired mutations in pLaSota V.F., it was sequenced to its entirety. Using reverse genetics procedures [11, 33] , the recombinant virus rLaSota V.F. was recovered from its cDNA clone, pLaSota V.F.",

Brains from the 1-day-old chicks were collected daily for 7 days. Tissues, such as brain, spleen and lung were collected from inoculated 3week-old chickens on days 1, 3, 5 and 7 P.I. and snap frozen immediately. Blood was also collected from the birds on these same days and assayed for viremia. The tissues were homogenized, and the virus titers in tissues and blood were estimated by plaque assay on DF1 cells. To determine the sites of localization of these recombinant viruses in the brain, one-half of the brains collected from the 3-week-old chickens were embedded in paraffin and sectioned at 5 mm/section. These sections were subject to either an immunohistochemical assay [35] using a cocktail of NDV monoclonal antibodies [36] or an in situ hybridization assay [35] employing a 35 S-labeled riboprobe specific for NP gene of NDV. The virulence of the viruses was evaluated by ICPI in day-old-chicks and IVPI in 6-week old chickens. ICPI was determined by inoculating 0.05 ml of a 1:10 dilution of fresh infective allantoic fluid of each virus into the brains of 10 1-day-old chicks.
