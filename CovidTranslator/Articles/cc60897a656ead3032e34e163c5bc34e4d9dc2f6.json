However, adhering to quarantine is difficult. Decisions on how to apply quarantine should be based on the best available evidence to increase the likelihood of people adhering to protocols. We conducted a rapid review to identify factors associated with adherence to quarantine during infectious disease outbreaks.",

Particularly during the early stages of a novel infectious disease outbreak, quarantine can be applied to large numbers of people. For example, in Toronto during the 2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak, 100 people were placed into quarantine for every case that was diagnosed. 3 The early stages of the 2019 coronavirus outbreak have already witnessed the quarantining of entire cities within China, 4 while thousands of foreign nationals leaving China are being asked to enter quarantine at home or in government facilities upon return to their home countries.",

While officially-sanctioned enforcement of quarantine orders is possible, 7 this can lead to legal dispute, 5 chaotic scenes of confrontation, 8 and poor mental health (which can occur even under voluntary procedures). 4 9 Many nations are understandably nervous of these outcomes, especially given that confrontation can now result in harrowing mobile phone footage making its way to social and mainstream media.

When five schools in an Australian city were closed during the H1N1 pandemic, a lack of clear quarantine instructions led some of those affected to invent their own quarantine rules, 15 seemingly based on what they thought constituted a visible symptom of the disease, the acceptable degree of contact with those infected and the risk of being affected or of infecting others. Parents in an Australian city who understood what they were meant to do during the quarantine period for H1N1 had significantly higher adherence to quarantine. 16 Caleo, et al. 17 found that people in Sierra Leone who were put under quarantine due to Ebola also had problems adhering to protocols because they did not understand what 'isolation' meant. Adherence to quarantine in Taiwan during the SARS outbreak was significantly associated with higher awareness of the pandemic. 18 However, in some cases, too much perceived knowledge might be a hindrance. Residents of villages that were quarantined during the Ebola epidemic who were health professionals often had more knowledge about Ebola than the volunteers sent in to support the village. They believed they knew more about the risk of infection than volunteers, but unlike the latter did not always adhere to the quarantine measures as they thought the restrictions were too overprecautionary. 19 One study looked at the effect of where people got their knowledge of quarantine protocols from, finding no difference in adherence rates between those that sourced information from official vs unofficial sources. 16",

Residents of villages in West Africa quarantined during an Ebola outbreak often did not adhere to quarantine as it was inherent in their culture to care for people when they are sick, rather than 'abandon' them. 17 Conversely, two studies noted that participants quarantined during SARS explained that they adhered to quarantine as it was their 'civic duty' and they wanted to be a good citizen. 20 21 Two studies noted that 'following the law' was a reason for adhering to quarantine during the Ebola outbreak in Sierra Leone, 17 and the SARS outbreak in Canada. 20 In these circumstances, if individuals were found breaking quarantine rules, they faced paying fines.",

Our review found that adherence to quarantine during infectious disease outbreaks can be variable. In the studies we reviewed, adherence ranged from 0 to 93%. The most common factors affecting people's adherence to quarantine were their knowledge about the infectious disease outbreak and quarantine protocol, social norms, perceived benefits of quarantine, perceived risk of disease and practicalities of being in quarantine. These factors have also been found to influence adherence to other protective health behaviours with regards to infectious diseases such as handwashing, wearing face masks, avoiding crowds and vaccination. 25 26 The recommended actions for increasing adherence to voluntary quarantine are discussed below, and a summary of key points is shown in Figure 2 .",
