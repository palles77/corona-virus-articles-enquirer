Adjusting background variables, other significant factors were identified by stepwise models: perceived side effects (OR = 0.33), family members' recommendations and friends' acceptability toward the vaccine (OR = 2.80-4.74). In contrast to other studies on seasonal influenza and A/H1N1 vaccination, perceived susceptibility and perceived severity related to influenza A/H1N1 were non-significant. Cultural differences may therefore exist.",

Factors in association with seasonal influenza vaccination have been widely reported. The Health Belief Model (HBM) postulates that constructs such as perceived susceptibility, perceived severity, perceived benefits, perceived barriers, cue to action and self-efficacy are determinants of health behav-iors [24] [25] [26] ; these constructs were significantly associated with seasonal influenza vaccination in the general population [27] . The Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) specifies that positive and negative attitudes, subjective norms and perceived behavioral control of the health-related behavior are key determinants of behavioral intention and hence the actual health-related behavior [28, 29] . Such constructs were also associated with seasonal influenza vaccination [30] . Factors related to emerging respiratory infectious diseases such as avian influenza are important determinants of seasonal influenza vaccination [31] . It is shown that severity of the influenza A/H1N1 pandemic [17, 18] and history of seasonal influenza vaccination [32] were associated with acceptance of A/H1N1 vaccine. There are only a few studies investigating factors in association with intention to take up the A/H1N1 vaccination.",

Random telephone numbers were selected from up-to-date telephone directories. Over 95% of the households in Hong Kong have a fixed-line telephone installed [40] . Interviews were conducted from 6:30 pm to 10 pm to avoid over-representation of non-working people. The eligible member whose birthday was closest to the survey date was selected from each of the contacted households. Verbal consent was obtained from the respondents and the interview lasted for about 20 min. At least three phone calls were made at different hours and weekdays before a non-contact telephone number was considered invalid. The study was granted ethics approval by the Chinese University of Hong Kong. A total of 378 eligible respondents were identified and 301 completed the interview; the response rate was 79.6% (301/378).",

Cognitions with respect to influenza A/H1N1 are therefore not going to play a significant role in shaping behavioral intention toward A/H1N1 vaccination -the prevalence of A/H1N1 vaccination is not expected to increase even if the virus becomes more prevalent, severer or if there are changes in the level of knowledge about its mode of transmission.

It is then dichotomized as being all correct(1) or having at least one unconfirmed belief (0). a Perceived Severity Index: the number of item responses indicating perceived severity of A/H1N1 (ranging from 0 to 9): (1) mortality rate of influenza A/H1N1 is >5% among adults; (2) influenza A/H1N1 would cause severe irreversible body damages for adults; (3) there is not effective drug for the treatment of influenza A/H1N1; (4) the perceived number of death cases of influenza A/H1N1 in Hong Kong is >50 in the coming year; (5) there are quite a lot/many hidden cases of influenza A/H1N1 in the community; (6) it is certainly/most likely/likely that a large-scale local influenza A/H1N1 outbreak would occur in the coming year; (7) the mortality rate of influenza A/H1N1 is much higher than that of seasonal flu; (8) the transmission rate of influenza A/H1N1 is much higher than that of seasonal influenza; and (9) the severity of body damages of H1N1 is much higher than that of seasonal flu. b Perceived Susceptibility Index: the sum of the three item responses: (1) I perceived myself to have a high or very high chance of contracting influenza A/H1N1 in the coming year; (2) I perceived my family members to have a high or very high chance of contracting influenza A/H1N1 in the coming year; and (3) I perceived the general public to have a high or very high chance of contracting influenza A/H1N1 in the coming year.
