The disease spread 22 rapidly from Wuhan to the surrounding provinces and cities, which got the attention of the government 23 and the administrative departments of health at all levels. The Chinese Center for Disease Control and 24 Prevention (CDC) promptly organized the relevant disease control agencies, medical units, and 25 research institutes to carry out investigations and treatment. A new type of coronavirus was detected 26 by researchers in a patient's bronchoalveolar lavage fluid sample on January 3, 2020 [4] . The World 27 Health Organization (WHO) named it the 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) and announced that 28 the new coronavirus epidemic had been listed as a public health emergency of international concern on 29 January 30, 2020. As of 18:00 on February 11, 2020, there were 42,744 confirmed cases, 21,675 30 suspected cases, 4,161 cured cases, and 1,017 deaths in China . 31 The 2019-nCoV, which belongs to the genus betacoronavirus, is a single-stranded positive-strand 32 RNA virus that appears to be distinct from, but is related to, other coronaviruses, such as severe acute 33 respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARSr-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome 34 coronavirus (MERSr-CoV) [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . Current studies have shown that 2019-nCoV has about an 89% 35 homology with bat SARS-like-CoVZXC21 and 82% homology with human SARS-CoV [9] . The 36 disease is highly contagious, and may rapidly develop into severe pneumonia, acute respiratory 37 distress syndrome (ARDS), multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), and death, so the top 38 priority for clinicians is to identify and treat the severest patients in the early stage. The aim of this 39 study was to assess the potential high-risk factors of 2019-nCoV severe pneumonia and provide 40 evidence for the screening of severely afflicted patients.

High-resolution CT scans with a scan layer thickness of 5 mm and a reconstruction of a 1-1.5 54 mm thin layer are recommended for the radiological examination of 2019n-CoV pneumonia. Based on 55 the patients' exposure history, clinical symptoms, laboratory examinations, and chest CT scans, all of 56 the patients were clinically diagnosed with 2019-nCoV pneumonia according to WHO's interim 57 guidance [10] . For patients who were suspected to have the illness, two senior respiratory doctors made 58 the diagnosis together. 59 The patients were divided into two groups: patients with severe pneumonia and those with non-severe 60 pneumonia. The former referred to patients with the following severe manifestations: fever or 61 suspected respiratory infection, plus one of a respiratory rate >30 breaths/min, severe respiratory 62 distress, or SpO2 <90% on room air. Patients with ARDS, sepsis, or septic shock were also included. 63 The patients without the above severe signs were defined as having non-severe pneumonia. Patients The patient data were extracted from the Central Hospital of Wuhan, which is a tertiary teaching 69 hospital and is responsible for the treatment for patients with 2019-nCoV pneumonia, as assigned by 70 the Chinese government. Clinical features, chronic co-morbidities, demographic data, laboratory 71 examinations, and chest CT scans were reviewed using electronic medical records. Laboratory 72 examinations included routine blood tests, as well as tests of the liver function, kidney function, 73 electrolytes, B-type natriuretic peptide, D-dimer, C-reactive protein, and procalcitonin. We obtained 74 the lymphocyte absolute values of patients with severe pneumonia on the first day and the third day 75 after admission. The D-dimer data of patients with severe pneumonia on the first day, the third day, 76 and the seventh day after admission were also collected. Chest CT scans were reviewed on the first 77 day and the third day for patients with severe pneumonia. In addition to collecting the albumin data on 78 the first day after admission, the data on the seventh day were also obtained for patients with severe 79 pneumonia. For patients with non-severe pneumonia, we only collected the data on the first day after 80 admission because the relevant items were not frequently reviewed. For patients admitted to the RICU, 81 the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II scores (APACHE-II) and Sequential Organ 82 Failure Assessment (SOFA) were determined on the first day. The data were acquired by physicians. 83 All of the data were checked by another researcher to ascertain its accuracy. To reflect the progression 84 of the disease in critically ill patients, we calculated the difference in the lymphocyte values between 85 day 3 and day 1, the difference in the serum albumin values between day 7 and day 1, and the 86 difference in the D-dimer values between days 3, 7, and 1.",

According to the 106 patients' medical history, the common symptoms at the onset of the illness were fever, fatigue, dry 107 cough, and dyspnea. Although the initial symptoms of the patients with severe pneumonia were more 108 commonly fever and dyspnea, and the difference was not statistically significant. The temperature The laboratory examinations showed that patients with severe pneumonia had depressed serum 148 albumin, elevated serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, aspartate aminotransferase, C-reactive protein, 149 and B-type natriuretic peptide. Hypoproteinemia may be due to the patient's consumption and 150 inadequate protein intake caused by poor appetite. A previous study reported that hypoalbuminemia is 151 a potent, dose-dependent predictor of poor outcomes for pneumonia with the coronavirus infection [11] . 152 An elevated amount of C-reactive protein may be associated with the inflammatory response and 153 cytokine storms caused by the virus in the blood vessels. These results were consistent with a previous 154 study, which showed that the C-reactive protein level was positively correlated with the severity of the 155 pneumonia [12] .",

These results suggested that the level of D-dimer was 158 significantly positively correlated with the 2019-nCoV severe pneumonia, which was also shown in 159 another study [13] . Previous studies showed that SARS-CoV could bind to ACE2, down-regulating the 160 expressions of ACE2, and resulting in an increased Angiotensin II level in mouse blood samples, 161 signaling through Angiotensin II receptor 1, and induced acute lung injury [14] [15] [16] . ACE2 is a receptor 162 protein of both SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV, and it is abundantly present in the epithelia of the lung 163 and small intestine [17] . It was reported that 2019-nCoV binds to the ACE2 in the same way as SARS- 164 CoV [18] , inducing damage to the pulmonary arteries and leading to the extensive embolization in the 165 extensive alveolar terminal capillaries. These changes eventually lead to an increase in D-dimer. A 166 significant lymphocyte decline in the progression of severe pneumonia was also observed, which was 167 consistent with the results of Huang et al [19] . Decreased lymphocytes suggested that 2019-nCoV may 168 primarily attack the body's immune system, especially the T lymphocytes, which is similar to the 169 action of SARS-CoV [20] . After 2019-nCoV impairs the immune system, it is difficult to prevent the is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.",

Every patient had completed the relevant laboratory 47 examination, including various common pathogen detection and chest computed tomographic (CT) 48 scans. All of the patients were local residents of Wuhan. Moreover, most of the patients had a history 49 of exposure to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market or had made contact with people who had been 50 confirmed (or suspected) to have contracted the illness. The 2019-nCoV nucleic acid detection of 51 some patients was positive, while for others, it was negative.

Patients over the age of 128 60 years and in the range of 40 to 60 old had a significantly higher risk of developing severe 129 pneumonia than those under the age of 40. For every 1 standard deviation increase in the D-dimer 130 value, the patients' risk of developing severe pneumonia increased by about 17 times. In addition, 131 lymphocytes were found to be independent protective factors for severe pneumonia. The incidence of 132 severe pneumonia in patients with a 0.55 increase in lymphocytes decreased by about 67.8%. 133 Both the APACHE-II and SOFA scores were assessed in patients with severe pneumonia, with results 134 of 14.5 (13, 17) and 6 (5, 7), respectively (Table 3). Severe pneumonia usually progresses rapidly, and 135 many clinical indicators can change in a short time, especially the lymphocyte, D-dimer, serum 136 albumin, and chest CT manifestations. To better identify severe pneumonia early, we calculated the 137 difference in the lymphocyte counts, serum albumin values, and D-dimer values at different points in 138 time (Table 3, Figs. 1-4). The results showed that in the early stage of the disease, the lymphocyte and 139 serum albumin decreased and the D-dimer increased with the progress of the disease. We have 140 included 2 chest CT scans of one patient with severe pneumonia at different time periods, which 141 suggested the rapid progress of the disease (Fig. a cross-sectional study on the clinical characteristics of patients with 2019-nCoV, especially 144 those with severe pneumonia.

First, only 110 patients from a single hospital were included in this 179 study; a larger scale study needs to be carried out to confirm our conclusions.
