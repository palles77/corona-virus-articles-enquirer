In 2003, the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) pandemic created a panicked state of preparation in anticipation of a high mortality rate and broad geographical spread. Although this was not realized, large gaps in capacity to meet potential emergency health demands were revealed. 1 After SARS, the first and only comprehensive and objective review of the Canadian and Ontario public health systems was conducted. It strongly emphasized the need for enhanced public health capacity and a strong public health workforce to prevent the occurrence of future crises. Over time, these efforts have been hampered by a muddied understanding of what public health capacity actually means. 2e4 The objective of this study was to regain a clear understanding of the components of public health capacity, and how they relate to a stronger public health system.",

For a complete listing of these reports, see Supplementary data in Appendix A. Manifest content analysis was used to analyze the use of the terms \"capacity\" and \"capacities\" related to public health. 5 Tables of contents, chapter headings, executive summaries, recommendations and terms that were unrelated to public health (e.g. bed capacity) were excluded. The remaining terms were coded by report name and type of capacity by LEW. For example, epidemiological capacity was coded as \"epidemiological\". All coding was independently reviewed by SEG. Disagreements between reviewers related to the addition, deletion and naming of codings (n \u00bc 90) were discussed and consensus was achieved. Similar codes were deductively organized by LEW into families that represented separate components of public health capacity. Families and their codes were reviewed by SEG and consensus was achieved through critical discussion. These families were then organized by LEW and AP into a tiered public health capacity framework where capacity within each tier builds upon the capacities within the preceding tiers, and moves from the individual to the systems level. Here, we present this framework of public health capacity that identifies individual components and suggests how they relate to and support one another for the purpose of enhancing overall capacity in public health systems.",

As the National Advisory Committee on SARS and Public Health noted, \"No attempt to improve public health will succeed that does not recognize the fundamental importance of providing and maintaining in every local health agency across Canada an adequate staff of highly skilled and motivated public health professionals.\" 6 The foundation components of public health capacity provide the necessary underlying infrastructure by supporting one another to effectively fulfill the programmatic and integrative public health functions, and maintain the smooth functioning of the public health system. For example, research and K* capacity is supported by partnerships and collaboration between various public health stakeholders on the same tier level. This tier also supports succeeding tiers. For example, epidemiology and surveillance capacity is supported by timely access to quality data and information, collaborative linkages, investigative research, common reporting structures, and modern disease information systems.",

Population health management refers to meeting community needs and responding to public health issues and challenges within the local and provincial public health systems. Delivery of programs and services is primarily discussed in relation to Ontario's public health units although the need for human, physical and financial resources applies to public health organizations as well. Governance is related to policy and planning procedures, strategic capacity, leadership and management, performance management, and risk assessment and planning.

This is in contrast to other discussions of capacity in public health that have a more singular focus on specific capacities such as epidemiology or health promotion. 9,10 Based on this framework, capacitybuilding efforts are predicted to be potentially more impactful when directed at the lower tiers (human resources, foundation) as these tiers support capacity within the above tiers.",

We suggest that this framework can be applied by each actor using an iterative, developmental approach according to the following steps: 1) Identify the capacity components that individuals, agencies, and systems should possess given their particular mandate; 2) Identify the capacity components that individuals, agencies, and systems possess, and examine how these components relate to the other capacity components in the framework; 3) Identify the components that individuals, agencies, and systems do not currently possess in relation to the ideal state; and 4) Examine the potential for building these capacities internally or externally via strategic partnerships with other actors who already possess these desired capacities. This conceptual framework provides a common structure of public health capacity components that can be utilized by any actor to better coordinate and target capacity-building efforts to specific components identified using the framework. This framework has some limitations. It is descriptive in nature rather than prescriptive with respect to how each component should be enhanced in current public health systems. It is incumbent on each user of this framework to decide how best to modify and apply it to meet their particular needs. The framework is based on government and governmentcommissioned SARS reports that reviewed the Canadian and Ontario public health systems with an emphasis on community public health outbreaks and emergencies. Certain components such as maternal and child health were not addressed in these reports and are therefore not included in this framework. Lastly, this framework has not been validated using any real-world applications or scenarios. As this framework is implemented, it will be important to collect and receive feedback on its utility and applicability.",
