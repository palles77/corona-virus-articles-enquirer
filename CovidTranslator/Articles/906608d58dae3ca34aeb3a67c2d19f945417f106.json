There is a growing mismatch between the volume of microbial genome data available and the ability to automate its systematic analysis and interpretation 6, 7 . In this Perspective we outline selected approaches to the translation of pathogen genotyping and microbial genomics into formats that can be incorporated into communicable disease management, surveillance and control.

Analysing the dynamics of infections that have epidemic potential relies on the accurate demarcation and identification of individual strains or epidemic clones, together with the identification of specific virulence factors and other validated markers. Together, this information can be consolidated into a pathogen profile, which comprises information derived from traditional phenotype-based methods, such as bacterial culture identification (often based on biochemical properties and antibiotic resistance), and other information, such as that derived from nucleic-acid-based techniques. Nucleic-acid-based techniques include various high-throughput epidemiological typing methods that have the capacity to simultaneously identify and analyse multiple selected regions within a given pathogen genome and are relatively new to mainstream clinical microbiology 8, 9 .",

Many bacterial species contain different strains that are associated with distinct clinical features and epidemiology, and which cannot be distinguished by traditional means 4, 10 . Strains of the same species can vary by as much as 35% in either the complement or number of unique genes present and sometimes have significant variation within individual genes. For example, the sizes of the Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica chromosomes can vary by more than 1 Mb and 300 kb, respectively 11 , and most bacterial species are a mosaic of different subpopulations. In many bacteria the characteristics that determine pathogenicity for hosts are encoded on mobile genetic elements that are transferred between strains at different rates. Organizing bacterial strains into clonal complexes rather than traditional species groupings is therefore often more relevant to clinicians and is better suited to epidemiological analyses. For example, the diversity of hundreds of distinct Campylobacter jejuni strains, as defined by multilocus sequence typing (MLST), is represented by 17 clonal complexes, six of which comprise more than 60% of the strains isolated from human campylobacteriosis 12 .",

The systematic construction of pathogen profiles from a combination of genomic or other 'omic' markers in a manner that enables data to be integrated and shared, is essential for successful surveillance and disease management 13 . Consider, for example, an infection that is potentially caused by several different strains of the same species, each of which has different sets of virulence factors that can be distinguished by genotyping. If the optimal management strategies varied for infections caused by different subtypes, then rapid subtype identification would optimize disease management. For example, antibiotic resistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, detection of which indicates potential therapeutic failure, can be identified using genetic markers 2, 8 . Similarly, evidence from the monitoring of HIV or hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections supports this approach 14,15 (BOXES 1,2).",

Genotyping systems that are based on comparison of sizes and numbers of different DNA fragments separated by gel electrophoresis -pulse field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), or nucleic acid amplification-based typing methods such as restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) or random amplified polymorphic DNA chain reaction (RAPD) -have been less reliable than direct sequence-based methods, due to a lack of precision and reproducibility 16 . Sequence-based typing and RAPD, plasmid fingerprinting or PFGE can be viewed as examples of direct and indirect methods of assessing nucleic acid sequence, respectively. All of these methods provide both strain typing and phylogenetic data 2,17,18 that can be processed using sequence alignment and clustering techniques and are amenable to standardization and database cataloguing. The derived information often correlates well with clinically relevant phenotypic characteristics, such as virulence [19] [20] [21] . Typing systems that use markers with specific or binary values, including MLST, are more reproducible and are therefore more appropriate for pathogen profiling 19, 20 . Such typing systems enable classification of pathogens that are relevant to the investigation of chains of infection transmission and are useful tools for studies of global epidemiology 18 . Detailed descriptions of molecular typing techniques that are used for epidemiology studies can be found elsewhere [20] [21] [22] .",

Profiles of different types of viruses and bacteria can differ significantly as there is no unique or common template or genotyping method that can capture all of the attributes required to describe all types of microorganisms. Some genome profiling techniques are based on conserved genes -genes that are associated with metabolism or other 'housekeeping' functions -whereas others target variable genes that are often associated with virulence 20 .

Chronic HCV infection is responsible for inflammation of the liver, and ~20% of patients progress to liver cirrhosis with an increased risk for the development of hepatocellular carcinoma 67 . The complications of HCV infection can be prevented by antiviral therapy. The combination of pegylated interferon-\u03b1 (IFN-\u03b1) and ribavirin has become the standard treatment for chronic HCV infection. HCV profiles (see figure) are important clinically because they most accurately predict the chance of an antiviral response, dictate the duration of therapy, the dosage of ribavirin and determine the virological monitoring procedures 67, 68 . The amino-acid variability of HCV proteins reflects different sensitivities to IFN-\u03b1-based therapy and a range of mutations in genes encoding protein kinase receptors and the IFN-\u03b1 sensitivity-determining region associated with HCV protease and polymerase inhibitors have been identified 69 .

The eBURST algorithm, which was developed for the interpretation of MLST results, first identifies mutually exclusive groups of related genotypes in the population, then identifies the group's founding genotype, predicts the descent -from the founder -of other genotypes, and shows the output as a radial diagram, centred on the predicted founding genotype. The computational power required and the confidence limits used depend on the number of markers and their diversity within and among species, and the number of representative samples. Computational pattern matching and validation techniques have received little attention in the biomedical literature so far 40, 41 .",

Public electronic bacterial typing databases such as MLSTNet, PulseNet, the BioPortal and SPOTCLUST, among others, use web-based formats that allow universal access and matching of bacterial or viral isolates to each other and to those represented in databases. More recently, structured polymorphism databases have been built, yet data sharing and integration remain difficult, due to the lack of common structures 47, 55 . Several hundred public domain molecular biology databases are currently online but few contain raw data. Most represent the efforts of individuals to organize, annotate and interpret data from other sources. These databases are highly valued and are increasingly expected to replace paper publication as the medium of communication 46 . Some are classification databases (for example, the Staphylococcus aureus spa typing tool or the SPOTCLUST database for Mycobacterium tuberculosis genotyping). Critical factors that distinguish the best databases include networks of subscribers willing to share data, the availability of statistical algorithms to analyse these data and the quality of the curation process. MLST and PulseNet are good examples of advanced databases. At the core of the MLST concept is the provision of freely accessible nucleotide-sequence databases, which function as a common dictionary to enable direct comparison of bacterial isolates without requiring the physical exchange of cultures. In this sense they provide the basis of a common language for bacterial typing 45 . In contrast to archival databases such as GenBank, MLST databases are curated for accuracy. To overcome some limitations of the first MLST stand-alone web sites, a new network-based database (MLSTdB-Net) has been implemented with more than 30 MLST schemes, for different bacterial species. It is hosted at 33 websites to ensure greater computational power and better analytical performance. Some of the MLST websites allow researchers to run and curate their own schemes remotely. The PulseNet system, which is based on PFGE patterns, is the most developed system for the characterization of bacterial isolates with a fingerprinting approach. It is one of the few networks that integrate epidemiological and typing data over wide geographical regions 45, 50 .",

A range of bioinformatics tools, which are designed to predict drug resistance or response to therapy from genotype, have been developed to provide clinicial support. These tools use either a statistical approach, in which the inferred model and prediction are treated as regression problems, or machine learning algorithms, in which the model is treated as a classification problem 17 . A statistical learning approach to ranking of therapeutic choices often relies on a direct correlation between baseline microbial profile, the therapeutic decision and response to treatment, for example, expected reduction in viral load resulting from anti-HIV combination therapy (BOX 1) . Several susceptibility scores have been used for combination antiretroviral therapy that take into account specific resistance mutations and add up the activities of individual drugs in the regimen 27, 56, 57 . Computer-assisted therapy is an attractive way to reduce the complexity of prescribing antimicrobial combinations. It highlights the need for databases that can be widely shared, and that allow correlation of quality-controlled data from genotypic resistance assays and treatment regimens with short-and long-term clinical outcomes. Differences in antimicrobial sensitivities reflect variation in amino-acid composition of resistant microorganisms, but simply counting mutations is not enough to detect most functional differences, which affect treatment outcomes. The data links between laboratory and clinical databases will unlock the full utility of microbial profiles.",

Microbial typing can confirm or refute putative epidemiological links among and between cases and potential environmental sources, and therefore might trigger public health investigations. Alternatively, typing studies can demonstrate that putative clusters are unrelated and so rule out the need for further action. However, the usefulness of pathogen profiling goes beyond specific questions related to the investigation of possible outbreaks. It can also be used for disease monitoring, by identifying transmission and associations between microbial types and clinical outcomes 41 . Molecular profiling can assist in the assessment of the reproductive number (R 0 ) of an infectious organism during epidemics, in making infection control policies more organism-specific 41 and in predicting clinical outcomes. For example, multiple isolates of the same pathogen that have indistinguishable profiles, which are highly clustered in time and space, would suggest an outbreak and trigger an epidemiological investigation supplemented by a social network analysis of patients involved. This could potentially identify a 'superspreader' -an individual who is responsible for 80% of transmission events 58 . Evidence suggests that, for some infections such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) that have epidemic potential, public health control strategies that are focused on 'superspreaders' would be three times more effective than the random interventions currently used 58 .",

The output from these systems ultimately needs to be integrated into clinical and diagnostic processes. Real-time data sharing, especially of genotypes of microbial isolates from different animal species as well as humans (for zoonotic infections) and from different jurisdictions or countries, could enhance rapid response using input and action triggers provided by multiple diagnostic, veterinary and public health laboratories and other partner organizations.",
