About 270 people were infected with a case-fatality ratio (CFR) of 40% [1] [2] [3] . All of the cases involved close contacts with infected farm pigs. Many of the pigs were initially infected by eating fruits that were partially eaten by fruits bats, which had left their virus-laden saliva behind (4) (5) (6) . Upon isolation and sequencing of the virus, it was revealed that the culprit was a novel RNA virus from Paramyxoviridae family, which includes the Hendra (HeV), mumps (MuV), and measles (MeV) viruses [4] [5] [6] [7] . The symptoms for Nipah infections often include an initial flu-like fever that often follows by irritations, coma, and then death.",

            "text": "In 2001, a different NiV strain was observed in Bangladesh [4] . There were outbreaks in India or Bangladesh each year thereafter. While human infections in the Malaysian outbreak arose mainly from close contacts with infected pigs, the patients in Bangladesh were often infected by drinking date palm sap that was previously consumed by bats. The virulence was also different. For example, the Bangladesh outbreaks in 2004 involved a CFR of 75%, while the 2008-10 outbreaks had a CFR of 89% (Kalkarni et al. [8] . The reason for these remarkable differences in the virulence of different NiV strains remains largely unknown [9] . This paper will put forth a set of evidence demonstrating that the variability in the intrinsic disorder propensities of some of the viral proteins from different strains NiV may act as an underlying reason for the differences in their virulence with the potential links to the modes of transmission. It is worth mentioning here the same underlying reason for high virulence and differences in the transmission modes had been previously found for other viruses, such as MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, Ebola virus, flaviviruses, and HIV [10] [11] [12] [13] 67 ].",

While it had been initially observed that unique structures dictate the functions of the protein, it was also found that many proteins lack structure, and the lack of structure itself provides protein with new functional means [14] [15] [16] [17] . As a result of the recognition of the biological and pathological importance of intrinsically disordered proteins and proteins containing intrinsically https://doi.org/10.1016/j.micpath.2020.103976 Received 16 October 2019; Accepted 10 January 2020 disordered regions, multiple disorder predictors have been elaborated to recognize disordered regions [18] [19] [20] . One of the earliest disorder predictors is the PONDR\u00ae VLXT [21] [22] [23] which has been shown to be useful in the analysis of proteins from various viruses, such as HIV, influenza A 1918H1N1 and H5N1 viruses, poliovirus, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, smallpox virus, Ebola virus, and HCV [10] [11] [12] [13] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] 67] .",

            "text": "While NiV is of the Paramyxoviridae, this virus, together with HeV, belongs to the henipavirus genus characterized by larger genomes, when compared to the other paramyxoviruses. In fact, 18.6 kb-long negative-sense single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) genome of NiV contains 6 genes ( Fig. 1 ) that encode 9 proteins: nucleoprotein (N), phosphoprotein (P), the interferon antagonists W and V, the viral C protein, a matrix protein (M), viral fusion and glycoproteins (F and G, respectively), and a large polymerase (L), with the proteins P, V, W, and C about the genomic organization), which are used by the virus to overcome the innate immune response [32, 33] , being all encoded by the P gene that undergoes specific mRNA editing that results in the appearance of the specific reading frame shifts [34, 35] . A homopolymer of the major nucleocapsid protein N condenses and encases the genomic RNA within the long helical nucleocapsids, which serve as biologically active templates for the viral RNA synthesis by the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase [25, 35, 36] . Structurally, N protein contains two globular domains, the N-terminal (N NTD , residues 32-258) and Cterminal (N CTD , residues 259-371) domains decorated with two projections, N-terminal (NT ARM , residues 1-31) and C-terminal subdomains (CT ARM , residues 372-383), and a long and highly disordered C-terminal tail (N TAIL , residues 384-532) that protrudes outside the nucleocapsid. These different structural parts of N have divergent biological functions, where N NTD and N CTD enwrap the genomic RNA to protect it against nucleases [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] , NT ARM and CT ARM from adjacent protomers are exchanged to ensure stable lateral contacts needed for stabilization of the N homopolymer 2005) [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] , and a highly disordered N tail is utilized in binding to the C-terminal domain of the phosphoprotein P (P XD ) [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] [48] [49] [50] [51] [52] [53] [54] . Therefore, the viral shell contains N as a major nucleocapsid protein alongside with the phosphoprotein, P, and a large protein L that serves as an RNA polymerase during viral replication [6, 8, 52, 55] . and which is also found in close proximity. The matrix protein, M, that can be found underlying the viral membrane, is in contact with the fusion protein, F, and the glycoprotein, G, bound to the lipid membrane [7] .",

This can be reaffirmed by looking at Fig. 2 showing a CFR plot of the historical records from the WHO. It should be noted that the plot is adjusted for the \"noise\". The CFR of the 1998-9 outbreak, which involved 270 people, was about 40%, while subsequent 2004 outbreaks in Bangladesh and India showed CFR of~75%, and the outbreaks caused by the NiV strains after 2007 showed even higher fatality rates, which average at about 85%. Statistical analyses using One-Way ANOVA (F-9.93, p < 0.01) and regression reaffirm the statistical significance of the differences in the virulence strength among the strains (r 2 = 0.83, F = 42.43, p < 0.01). These results therefore justify the grouping of NiV into three main strains with the following calculated averages: 1) Malaysia-Singapore 1998-9 (CFR, 39.5 \u00b1 1%), 2) Bangladesh-India 2001-5 (CFR, 71 \u00b1 3.5%), and 3) Bangladesh-India 2007/8-12 (92.8 \u00b1 6%). As we shall see from the analyses below, there is also noticeable difference in the viral shell disorder and, therefore, genetic difference, among these three groups of the NiV strains. ",

This is further illustrated by both Fig. 2 and Table 1 , where it is clearly seen that in a similar way as three categories of NiV strains are characterized by the increasing virulence, the disorder levels in their N proteins are also changing as we move from one category of strains to another or from year to year. Table 1 shows that N proteins from all strains analyzed in this study are characterized by high level of predicted intrinsic disorder, which defines this protein as highly disordered following the accepted classification of proteins based on their PID, where proteins are considered as highly ordered, moderately disordered, or highly disordered if their PID < 10%, 10% \u2264 PID < 30%, or PID > 30%, respectively [57, 58] .",

Fig. 3A represents the PONDR\u00ae VLXT profiles for all N proteins listed in Table 1 and shows that although profiles of the N-terminal halves of these proteins are almost indistinguishable, some noticeable variability can be found within their C-terminal regions. To further illustrate these differences, Fig. 3B represents the zoomed-in view of the C-terminal regions, whereas Fig. 3C and D correspondingly show a set of differential profiles, where the PONDR\u00ae VLXT profile of the N protein of the NiV strain responsible for the Malaysia-Singapore 1998-9 outbreak is subtracted from the PONDR\u00ae VLXT profiles and the zoomed-in view of the parts of these differential profiles corresponding to the Cterminal regions of N proteins. Finally, Fig. 3E shows the results of the multiple sequence alignment of all the NiV N proteins analyzed in this study. Again, one can see that the C-terminal regions of these proteins are characterized by the largest sequence variability. In order to better visualize the correlation between the sequence variability of the N proteins and their intrinsic disorder predispositions, positions with higher disorder levels in the Bangladesh-India strains as compared with the original Malaysia-Singapore 1998-9 strain are indicated by bold red font, whereas positions with higher levels of predicted disorder in the Malaysia-Singapore 1998-9 strains than in the strains associated with the subsequence outbreaks are shown by bold blue font. Exact positions of mutations in N proteins from various strains relative to the sequence of N protein from the original 1998-9 Malaysia-Singapore strain are underlined. Visual inspection of this graph provides useful information on the location of mutations causing changes in the local intrinsic disorder predisposition of the corresponding N proteins. Fig. 3 shows that mutations are causing noticeable distortions in the local intrinsic disorder predisposition and that these distortions typically propagate well beyond the mutation site. Furthermore, Fig. 3 illustrates that although N proteins generally contain high levels of intrinsic disorder, their C-terminal domains (residues 370-532) are almost completely disordered. This is a peculiar observation indicating that strain-specific mutations are predominantly located within these highly disordered Cterminal domains suggesting their importance for the strain evolution, probably via modulation of the biological activities of the Nipah N protein.",

Strain-specific differences tend to be located near the C-terminus of the N protein used for interactions with the P protein As it follows from Fig. 3 , most strain-specific differences are found within the highly disordered C-terminal regions of the N proteins. This is a very important observation, since previous structural analysis revealed that this region represents an interaction site of N nucleoprotein for the P protein, and the binding of N to P is crucial for the appropriate co-localization of the complex during viral replication [52, 59] . Fig. 4 shows that the C-tail of the N protein contains several disorder-based binding sites, molecular recognition features (MoRFs), which can undergo disorder-to-order transitions at interaction with their biological partners, and which can be identified by the ANCHOR algorithm [60, 61] . Fig. 4 also illustrates that the strain-specific mutations are expected to affect interactability of N-protein, since all of them increase ANCHOR scores of the C-terminal region.",

The virulence of the Nipah virus can be traced to the year that the virus sample was obtained even more so than the geographic localization from which the sample was retrieved. For example, samples taken from Malaysia and Thailand in 2008 and 2010 have PID values closer to those of samples from Bangladesh-India 2007/8-12 than to those of Bangladesh-India 2001-5 and Malaysia-Singapore 1998-9, despite the fact Malaysia is in close proximity to Thailand. Without phylogenetic analysis, it would be easy to misinterpret the results by assuming that migratory bats may have brought the various strains of different N PID from elsewhere. Our combined disorder and phylogenetic analysis says, however, that this is not necessarily the case. As seen in Fig. 6 , the Thailand 2010, Malaysia 2010 and 1998 strains are all clustered together despite huge differences in year and PID. Thailand and Malaysia are in close geographic proximity together. This basically implies that the strains co-evolved at distinct locations (i.e. Southeast Asia and Bangladesh) as already suggested by others [1, 4] , even if the various strains in separate locations assume different N disorder as seen in Fig. 6 .",

This last observation suggests that there is some circulation of strains over the long distances, presumably with the help of migratory bats. A previous study, using GPS, supports this hypothesis by showing that bats can travel a round trip of over 1000 km in just one month [63] . While our study presents some cases of crossover strains from migratory bats, it also conversely shows also the strong presence of co-evolution as explained above. This study therefore paints a picture of the virus strains facing various but often similar evolutionary pressures at distinct geographic regions. The pressures could have arisen from factors which are the results of varying preferential modes of transmission dependent on the species of bat hosts and other host types such as pigs and humans. The pressures are therefore evolutionarily manifested as the differences in N PID as we shall re-visit later.",

The former has been found to be a \"true viral shapeshifters\" that includes the HIV, whereas the latter class has been describe as \"Trojan horses\", which are the viral shapeshifters of a different kind.

An additional interesting note is the fact that mutations that affect the pathogenesis of the virus is found further upstream to location 315 as illustrated by Figs. 3-5 , not noticed by any previous literature.

Such findings are in line with the results of previous studies where it has been shown that changes in the disorder of the shells can be used to predict the mode of transmission of coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV [25, 26] . In those studies, we have found that the more disordered the shells of coronaviruses are, the greater the contribution of the respiratory transmission and the lesser the fecal-oral transmission component. The results of the current research seem to extend this finding from coronaviruses to NiV (and, probably, to other RNA viruses from Paramyxoviridae family). In fact, we can see that the lower PID level of N protein from the 1998-9 strain allows greater fecaloral component, such that contacts with fecal and bodily fluid of pigs provide for easier spread of the virus to the farmers. The higher PIDs of N protein in the 2001-12 strains, on the other hand, facilitate greater chances of human-to-human transmission by respiratory contacts. Further evidence of links between the shell disorder and modes of transmission can also be found in other viruses, including HIV and other retroviruses.",

The results of the analysis reported in this paper suggest the ways we can further study NiV in both the wild and laboratories using disorder levels of N protein as a useful proxy. Related to this, the results reported in this paper highlight one reason for the differences among the virulence of various NiV strains is likely to be arising from the evolutionary pressures pertaining to the fitness of a particular mode of transmission. For example, a bat-to-bat transmission may favor respiratory transmission, whereas bat-to-pig and pig-to-human transmissions could favor the fecal-oral route.

HeV has infected horses from bats via fecal materials and horse-tohorse transmissions usually require close contacts that involve bodily fluids (6) . NiV spread is more complicated. While NiV transmission from bats to humans or pigs usually involves consumption of fecal or salivary contaminated fruits or palm date saps, the human transmission of NiV Malaysia-Singapore 1998-9 strain involved only close human contacts with infected pigs via bodily fluids, unlike the evidence of Bangladesh-India human-to-human transmission, which is usually indicative of the presence of the respiratory mode [10, 25, 26] .

The viral shells include both N and M proteins. A noticeable trend is the increase in the disorder of the shell proteins as the components of the respiratory and fecal-oral modes increases and decrease respectively. This is consistent with findings with regard to other viruses in the past. Viruses that rely heavily on fecal-oral transmission tend to have harder shells that are needed to persistent in the environment for a longer period of time. On the other hand, viruses that depends on respiratory modes of transmission have moderate disorder on their outer shells, but are likely to have highly disordered inner shells. Sexually transmitted viruses, such as HIV-1, on the other hand, could have highly disordered outer shell and have inner shells with reasonably high disorder levels. These are the trends we are seeing in Fig. 7 .",

Furthermore, while the maximal PID value determined among the N proteins of the various NiV strains is higher than that of the HeV N PID, a comparison of Table 1 and Fig. 7 shows that the N protein from the Malaysia-Singapore NiV strain has an PID value (41.73 \u00b1 0.01%) comparable to that of the N protein from HeV (PID: 41%). In agreement with their lower PID values, both the Malaysia-Singapore NiV and HeV have greater fecal-oral components, since the transmissions of both viruses require close contacts in the presence of bodily fluids. This refers to the horse-to-horse and pig-to-human transmissions of the HeV and Malaysia-Singapore 1998-9 NiV strain, respectively. No human-tohuman spread was observed in this NiV strain.",

Similarly, the maximal PID values for MeV, HeV, and NiV are 20%, 8%, and 14%, respectively.

The detection of links between modes of transmission and shell disorder will also be particularly helpful in the development of tools to anticipate the nature of an outbreak via molecular analysis of the viral shells.

Our results seem to hint that when the host cell is changed, there will be a switch of preference for a different mode of transmission as the cell type and animal species have been change, and the in process the virus becomes attenuated.

It does not need to be the case since the N protein is huge and most of the mutations arise from or from areas close to the Ntail. b Samples from two anamalous strains are not included: H6V868, H6V854. In general, a few anamalous strains should be expected in cases where a large number of outbreaks/strains is involved. The data used involve 9 isolates and 6 strains. c This Thailand sample was collected in 2010 from bats.
