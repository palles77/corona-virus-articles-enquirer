            "text": "Summary The threat of smallpox as a biological weapon has spurred efforts to create stockpiles of vaccine for emergency preparedness. In lieu of preparing vaccine in animal skin (the original method), we cloned vaccinia virus (New York City Board of Health strain, Dryvax 1 ) by plaque purification and amplified the clone in cell culture. The overarching goal was to produce a modern vaccine that was equivalent to the currently licensed Dryvax 1 in its preclinical and clinical properties, and could thus reliably protect humans against smallpox. A variety of clones were evaluated, and many were unacceptably virulent in animal models. One clonal virus (ACAM1000) was selected and produced at clinical grade in MRC-5 human diploid cells. ACAM1000 was comparable to Dryvax 1 in immunogenicity and protective activity but was less neurovirulent for mice and nonhuman primates. To meet requirements for large quantities of vaccine after the events of September 11th 2001, the ACAM1000 master virus seed was used to prepare vaccine (designated ACAM2000) at large scale in Vero cells under serum-free conditions. The genomes of ACAM1000 and ACAM2000 had identical nucleotide sequences, and the vaccines had comparable biological phenotypes. ACAM1000 and ACAM2000 were evaluated in three Phase 1 clinical trials. The vaccines produced major cutaneous reactions and evoked neutralizing antibody and cell-mediated immune responses in the vast majority of subjects and had a reactogenicity profile similar to that of Dryvax 1 . # 2004 International Society for Infectious Diseases.

This was achieved by an intensified international program of surveillance and vaccination. In 1980, there were uncertainties about the potential reappearance of the disease, and preparations were made for a large reserve stockpile of vaccine (200 million doses) to be held in Geneva and New Delhi. At the time, there was minimal concern about smallpox as a bioweapon. By 1984 only two controlled repositories of variola strains remained (in Moscow and Atlanta), making attribution clear in case of a biological attack. Moreover the high prevalence of vaccine immunity was thought to be a disincentive to the use of variola as a weapon. By 1986, in the absence of any recrudescence of smallpox, WHO reduced its vaccine repository to approximately 500,000 doses. Moreover, smallpox vaccine manufacturing had virtually ceased worldwide in the absence of vaccination programs and any commercial incentive for production.",

With the diminishing threat of smallpox and increased focus on adverse events, 1,2 vaccination in the United States was discontinued in 1972 for the general public and in 1989 for military personnel. With each passing year, the population thus became increasingly vulnerable to the virus. In the mid 1990s, the United States Government became alarmed about the threat of smallpox as an agent of biological terrorism. 3 The concern stemmed from revelations by defectors from the former Soviet Union, especially Kanatjan Alibekov (Ken Alibek). 4 He disclosed the existence of a sophisticated program beginning shortly after World War II and culminating in the 1980s with large-scale production of a virulent variola strain, and positioning of strategic long-range bombers and SS-18 multiple warhead intercontinental missiles armed with munitions containing the virus. Although the Soviet biological program was officially renounced by President Yeltzin in 1991, destruction of these weapons has never been verified, and new concerns have arisen about proliferation of smallpox stocks in other countries having adversarial relations with the West. Between Alibek's defection in 1992 and 1998, United States policy was shaped accordingly. In 1998, President Clinton announced a program to provide countermeasures, including a stockpile of vaccines. Only 15 million doses of smallpox vaccine remained in the US, and these doses had been manufactured 20 years earlier.",

After the events of September 11, 2001 , the terms of the original contract were modified to increase deliverable doses from 40 to 54 million. In November 2001, Acambis successfully competed for and was awarded a second contract for an additional 155 million doses of vaccine, bringing the total requirement to 209 million doses. Both CDC contracts specified that the new vaccine be delivered in the shortest possible timeframe and that it be licensed by the US Food & Drug Administration (FDA) based on successful clinical trials. The Government's intention was to have ''1 dose available for every citizen''. The balance of doses between the Acambis contracts and the US population was to be drawn from the original stockpile of 15 million doses of licensed vaccine [Dryvax 1 (New York City Board of Health strain), Wyeth Laboratories], which (based on new clinical trial data 5,6 ) could be diluted 1:5 for administration to humans in an emergency. In order to deliver such a large quantity of vaccine, Acambis partnered with Baxter BioScience, which had large-scale bioreactor capacity at its facilities near Vienna, Austria.",

This method of manufacture came into widespread use in the second half of the 19th Century. Although first generation vaccines are still made in the Netherlands, Russia and China, this method of manufacture is highly undesirable, particularly with respect to control of adventitious viruses and in light of advances in technology. Since vaccinia virus grows to high titers in a variety of cell culture systems acceptable for use in manufacturing human vaccines, the obvious objective was to manufacture the vaccine in an approved cell bank, preferably in continuous cells that had been controlled for adventitious agents and tumorgenicity. At the time the project began, there had been several successful historical attempts to produce cell culture smallpox vaccines, including viruses propagated in primary rabbit kidney cells 7, 8 and in continuous MRC-5 human diploid lung fibroblast cells. 9 A critical decision at initiation of the project was whether or not to establish a biological clone or to simply pass the existing licensed vaccine in cell culture without cloning. The benefits of cloning appeared to outweigh the recognized risk that a clonal virus population may differ biologically from the 'genetic swarm' represented by the animal-skin vaccine. 10 Because it would not be possible to conduct field tests for efficacy, the new vaccine would need to match the licensed vaccine (Dryvax 1 ) as closely as possible in preclinical tests for safety, immunogenicity, and protective activity and in clinical trials for safety and immunogenicity.",

To resolve this problem, Acambis teamed with Baxter BioScience, which had large-scale production capabilities in its facilities near Vienna, Austria. The Baxter process utilized a different cell line [African green monkey kidney (Vero)] grown on microcarriers in a 1200 L bioreactor. It was necessary therefore to pass the ACAM1000 master virus seed in Vero cells to make a new production virus seed stock at P8 ( Figure 2 ). To accommodate the scale of manufacture, an amplification passage (P9) needed to be introduced to provide sufficient virus to infect cells in the large bioreactor.

The first trial was a randomized, doubleblind study in healthy adults aged 18-29 years, and has been reported by Weltzin et al. 10 Briefly, all 30 subjects (100%, 95% CI 88, 100) inoculated with A second-generation smallpox vaccine for biological defense S37 Figure 2 Passage history of ACAM1000 and ACAM2000. 10 T cell responses were seen to both vaccines in the vast majority of subjects (Table 6 ). In the lymphoproliferation assay, ACAM1000 responses were significantly higher than in the Dryvax 1 group. The adverse event profile of ACAM1000 and Dryvax 1 were also similar ( Table 7) . These clinical results suggested that ACAM1000 was a suitable candidate smallpox vaccine. However, the Phase 1 study had been conducted within 6 months of the events of September 11, and there was grave concern about bioterrorism. The question arose as to how much clinical data should be available with the new vaccine to allow its wider use in an emergency. It was determined in meetings with US Government officials, that clinical data from a minimum of 100 subjects should be available. Therefore, to bring the total number to 100 subjects, a second study was performed. This second Phase 1, open-label study was designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of ACAM1000 smallpox vaccine in 70 adults aged 18 to 29 years, inclusive, who were na\u00efve to smallpox vaccine, and enrolled in the study at a single study center in the United States. Eligible subjects and their household contacts had no contraindications to smallpox vaccination (atopic dermatitis, other active skin diseases, immune deficiency, pregnancy). Safety was assessed by documentation of adverse events, physical examination findings, lymph node assessments, measurements of vital signs, and clinical laboratory tests, including hematology, clinical chemistry, and urinalysis. Eligible subjects who provided informed consent received a single vaccination with ACAM1000. Subjects returned to the clinic on Days 3, 7, 10, 15, and 30 for evaluations and also kept a diary of adverse events and took daily oral temperatures. Fifty-one percent of subjects were male. The majority (87%) were Caucasian. All 70 subjects (100%) experienced A second-generation smallpox vaccine for biological defense S39 ",

Plaque-purified vaccinia virus lines were shown to differ significantly in neurovirulence for mice, in their ability to evoke immune responses against the inserted gene product, and in their HindIII restriction maps. 12, 13 From virus stocks that underwent serial passages, variants could be recovered that contained deletions within or extending beyond the inverted terminal repeat regions, [14] [15] [16] [17] some of which were as large as 9 MDa ($5% of the genome). The variant viruses often exhibit reduced infectivity and reduced virulence for mice. 18 Similar deletion variants have been reported for other orthopoxviruses, including cowpox and monkeypox. It is not surprising, therefore, that we found biological and molecular heterogeneity among 6 clones derived from Dryvax 1 , with some clonal subpopulations (e.g. Clone 3) having dramatically higher virulence 10 and changes at the genomic level (Esposito J pers. comm.). Clone 3 derived from Dryvax 1 was shown to have an altered HindIII restriction map 10 and to contain a deletion at the right terminus and hundreds of mutations compared to the attenuated ACAM2000 (Clone 2). These observations were important when considering development of the second generation cell culture vaccine. The production of vaccine at a large scale in cell culture would put selective pressure on the virus, resulting in a different ratio of virion subpopulations in the end product compared to that in the original calf-skin vaccine. Indeed, we found that passage of uncloned Dryvax 1 in MRC-5 cells yielded a vaccine candidate that was unacceptably virulent. Such selective pressures could be inconsistent across vaccine lots made at large scale, with resulting variability in biological phenotype, and lot-to-lot differences in tests used to release the product.",

However, there is reason to believe that a welldefined clonal product has advantages. Ehrengut et al. 19 ,20 recovered vaccinia virus from patients who had dermatologic (vaccinia ulcer) or neurological complications. The viruses isolated from the affected patients differed from the parental vaccine in being resistant to high temperature, growing to higher titer in cell culture, producing larger plaque sizes, and causing marked necrosis in rabbit skin after intradermal inoculation. Similarly, Vilesova et al. 21 studied 6 virus isolates from cerebrospinal fluid and brain tissue of patients with post-vaccinal encephalitis. These strains were also thermostable, exhibited larger plaque size in cell culture, and were more pathogenic for chick embryos and more dermovirulent in rabbits than the parental vaccine. These data suggest that selection of a virulent virus subpopulation can occasionally occur during replication in the vaccinated host, leading to neurological or dermal complications.",

This classification by toxicity for mice correlated with the incidence of post-vaccinal encephalitis in human populations exposed to the corresponding vaccine strains [22] [23] [24] . For example, vaccines with high mouse pathogenicity, such as the Temple of Heaven and Tashkent strains, were associated with high incidence rates of post-vaccinial encephalitis, whereas the New York City Board of Health (NYCBH) strain (e.g. Dryvax 1 ) was associated with the lowest rates of this complication. The Lister strain, widely used in Europe and elsewhere, is of moderate mouse pathogenicity, and may have caused a higher rate of neurological complications than NYCBH in humans. We showed that ACAM1000 and ACAM2000 were significantly less neurovirulent for mice and monkeys than the parental Dryvax 1 virus, presumably because it contains neurovirulent virus subpopulations exemplified by Clones 1, 3 and 5. It is logical to assume, based on the discussion above, that ACAM2000 will be less likely to cause post-vaccinal encephalitis in humans. However, since the incidence of this complication following Dryvax 1 vaccination is so low (in the range of 1-5 per million 1,2 ), it would not be possible to prove this contention in clinical trials. Moreover, the pathogenesis of postvaccinal encephalitis is still uncertain, with controversy regarding the role of neuroinvasion and direct viral injury, particularly in cases of post-vaccinial encephalitis in adults. Vaccinia virus has been isolated from CSF and brain, 25, 26 suggesting that the virus invades the central nervous system in humans.",

            "text": "Phase 1 clinical trials of ACAM1000 and 2000 indicate that the original goal of producing a second generation vaccine that closely matched the safety and immunogenicity of calf-skin vaccine (Dryvax 1 ) was met. The cutaneous, antibody, and T cell responses in primary vaccinees were similar to those elicited by Dryvax 1 . The appearance ( Figure 5 ) and size of the cutaneous lesion and pattern of virus shedding from the vaccination site were also similar. Phase 2 trials in na\u00efve and previously vaccinated subjects have been completed to define the dose response, and to extend safety and immunogenicity data. 29 Phase 3 clinical trials are in progress. The principal finding of concern in Phase 2 and 3 trials involving larger numbers of subjects has been the discovery that smallpox vaccines are associated with inflammation of the myocardium and pericardium (myopericarditis). 30, 31 Although myopericarditis had been reported previously, it had not been recognized as a frequent complication of vaccination. In clinical trials of ACAM2000 and Dryvax 1 , myopericarditis has been associated with both vaccines, and appears to be an immunopathological response to vaccinia infection. The military experience with Dryvax 1 suggests that the incidence of myopericarditis detected by passive surveillance approximates 1:8000. 30 A significantly higher incidence is being detected in our Phase 3 clinical trials, since subjects are evaluated prospectively with provoked questions for cardiac symptoms and with serial electrocardiograms and serum enzyme tests. Fortunately, the cardiac adverse events appear to be self-limited. These data will be reported in future publications.",

The similar immune responses in humans and protective activity in animals to the currently licensed Dryvax 1 vaccine (which was used in the global program to eradicate smallpox) provide confidence that the vaccine will protect against variola. The new vaccine has advantages over first generation vaccines, since it has been produced to modern manufacturing and control standards, is free from adventitious agents (Table 5) , and does not contain subpopulations of virus with undesirable virulence properties. It is also a 'very low pathogenicity' strain, being less neurovirulent for animals than Dryvax 1 . The latter property may be associated with a lower propensity to cause post-vaccinial encephalitis, but this proposition cannot be proven without very wide-scale use of the vaccine to evaluate incidence rates.",
