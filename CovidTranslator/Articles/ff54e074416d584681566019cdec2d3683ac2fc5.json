It rapidly spread, resulting in an epidemic throughout China, with sporadic cases reported globally, becoming a global health emergency. 1 COVID-19 pneumonia has had a significant impact on people's health and social activity behavior and on economic development. The Chinese government reported that 78,195 cases of COVID-19 had been confirmed, 2,491 cases were suspected, and 2,718 patients had died as of February 26, 2020. 2 The outbreak of COVID-19 led to the closure of Wuhan, workers were delayed to work, and schools were closed across China. Although the majority of cases are mild, a certain proportion of patients develop critical illness, with a documented casefatality rate of 2.3% in China. 1 Reports to date indicate that although patients of all ages are susceptible to the disease, individuals developing critical illness were older and had a greater number of comorbid conditions, 3 suggesting that patients with comorbid conditions have high mortality rates and poor outcomes.",

Procalcitonin has similar limitations, with levels chronically elevated in hemodialysis patients even in the absence of severe acute illness. 11 Given these limitations and the high prevalence of comorbid conditions, COVID-19 pneumonia diagnosis in hemodialysis patients is dependent on clinical epidemiology, radiographic findings, and viral nucleic acid testing.",

The active ingredient, lopinavir, is a protease inhibitor. 11 Because coronavirus replication requires the action of viral proteases, lopinavir/ ritonavir may be effective by binding to the coronavirus protease to inhibit viral replication. Previous studies 12, 13 have shown that lopinavir/ritonavir can inhibit MERS-CoV (Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus) and SARS-CoV replication. Our results suggest that lopinavir/ ritonavir may improve the course of COVID-19 pneumonia in patients receiving hemodialysis, although the lack of a control patient makes this conclusion somewhat subjective. Because of the liver clearance and higher protein-binding capacity of lopinavir/ritonavir, no dosing adjustments are necessary in the treatment of hemodialysis patients. 14 Given the likely immunosuppression and the high prevalence of comorbid conditions among dialysis patients, the hemodialysis population may be particularly vulnerable to COVID-19 pneumonia, making efforts to promptly identify individuals with SARS-CoV-2 virus infection and implement steps to limit the spread of the virus critical (Fig 2) . This begins with strengthening prescreening triage of hemodialysis patients. 5 Persons without face masks are not allowed to enter the hemodialysis ward. We also implemented a policy whereby it was mandated that the \"COVID-19 Pneumonia Screening Registration Form\" be completed (Box 1). All patients had their temperature checked at the entrance to the hemodialysis unit and were surveyed regarding any recent fever, cough, or exposure to epidemic areas or to individuals who have visited epidemic areas within the last 2 weeks. If available, particularly within epidemic areas, we suggest promptly assessing for SARS-CoV-2 virus nucleic acid with swabs, especially in those with respiratory symptoms. For nonsuspected patients with potential COVID-19 exposure or from epidemic areas within the last 2 weeks, we performed hemodialysis in an isolation area within the hemodialysis facility. 225  226  227  228  229  230  231  232  233  234  235  236  237  238  239  240  241  242  243  244  245  246  247  248  249  250  251  252  253  254  255  256  257  258  259  260  261  262  263  264  265  266  267  268  269  270  271  272  273  274  275  276  277  278  279  280   281  282  283  284  285  286  287  288  289  290  291  292  293  294  295  296  297  298  299  300  301  302  303  304  305  306  307  308  309  310  311  312  313  314  315  316  317  318  319  320  321  322  323  324  325  326  327  328  329  330  331  332  333  334  335  336 All patients with temperatures > 37.3 C or respiratory symptoms were considered as suspected cases and were referred to the emergency department for evaluation. This assessment included routine serum chemistry tests and a complete blood count, C-reactive protein level, procalcitonin level, computed tomography of the chest and pharynx, and SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid testing to rule out SARS-CoV-2 infections. These suspected or confirmed cases were not brought into the dialysis treatment area, but rather were transferred to the isolation ward of the specialty hospital and received dialysis treatment in an isolation room until the SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test was negative.",

After each hemodialysis treatment, the dialyzer and all blood tubing were discarded as infectious waste. The dialysis machine was disinfected using sodium hypochlorite solution according to the manufacturer's instruction. The dialysis machine was kept in a room in the COVID-19 isolation ward between dialysis sessions and was only used for patients who had contracted COVID-19 infection.
