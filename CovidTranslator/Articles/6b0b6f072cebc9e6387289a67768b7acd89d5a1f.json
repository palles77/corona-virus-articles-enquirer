The disease was initially recognized in England in 1971 and has then spread to swine-producing European countries (Oldham, 1972; Pensaert et al., 1981) . Since the 1990s, PED has become rare in Europe and is more often associated with post-weaning diarrhea in adult pigs (Saif et al., 2012) . PED was first reported in Asia in 1982 and has since had a great economic impact on the Asian pork industry (Chen et al., 2008; Kweon et al., 1993; Li et al., 2012; Puranaveja et al., 2009; Takahashi et al., 1983) . In May 2013, PED outbreaks suddenly appeared in the United States and have rapidly spread nationwide as well as to Canada and Mexico, causing high mortality in newborn piglets and significant financial concerns (Mole, 2013; Stevenson et al., 2013 Vlasova et al., 2014 .",

PEDV is a large, enveloped virus possessing a single-stranded positivesense RNA genome of approximately 28 kb with a 5 cap and a 3 polyadenylated tail (Pensaert and de Bouck, 1978; Saif et al., 2012) . The spike (S) protein of PEDV is the major envelope glycoprotein of the virion and plays pivotal roles in interacting with the cellular receptor for virus entry and mediating neutralizing antibodies in the natural host (Jackwood et al., 2001; Lai et al., 2007; Lee et al., 2010) . Therefore, the PEDV S glycoprotein is known to be an appropriate viral gene for determining the genetic relatedness among PEDV isolates and for developing diagnostic assays and effective vaccines (Chen et al., 2014; Gerber et al., 2014; Lee et al., 2010; Lee and Lee, 2014; Oh et al., 2014) .",

However, a retrospective study revealed that PEDV already existed as early as 1987 (Park and Lee, 1997) . Since the emergence, PED outbreaks occurred every year, resulting in substantial economic losses to the Korean swine industry until early 2010. After severe outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) during 2010 to 2011, however, the prevalence of PEDV infections was occasional with only sporadic outbreaks in Korea. This epidemic situation probably resulted from the mass culling of more than one-third of the entire domestic pig population in Korea during the 2010-2011 FMD outbreaks. However, starting in November 2013, severe PED epidemics re-emerged in Korea and swept more than 40% of pig farms Lee et al., 2014a,b) . Although both modified live and killed vaccines against PED are commercially available in Korea, continuous PED epidemics indicate a low effectiveness of the domestic vaccines. This result appears to be due to genetic and antigenic differences between S proteins of vaccine and field strains (Lee et al., 2010; Oh et al., 2014; Lee and Lee, 2014) . Thus, the lack of effective vaccines enhances the need for the development of next-generation vaccines to control PED.",

To date, there have only been two reports in more than two decades on the cultivation of the Korean PEDV strain that is genetically divergent from field PEDVs (Kweon et al., 1999; Song et al., 2003) , while a number of PEDV strains have been recently isolated in the US and successfully grown in cell culture for a year (Chen et al., 2014; Oka et al., 2014) , In the present study, we attempted to isolate PEDV from various PEDV-positive samples using Vero cells. At this time, one highly virulent Korean strain KOR/KNU-141112/2014 has been successfully isolated and serially propagated in cell culture for over 30 passages. We aimed to characterize the growth and titer of the PEDV isolate KNU-141112 during the serial passages and the pathogenicity of the virus in suckling piglets. Our in vivo assessment demonstrated that KNU-141112 is highly entero-pathogenic in piglets, exhibiting severe clinical symptoms as well as macroscopic and microscopic lesions typical for PEDV infection. In addition, the complete genome or full-length S gene sequences of KNU-141112 were determined at selected passages to study the genetic stability and relationship. Our data indicated that KNU-141112 isolate is relatively stable during the first 30 passages in cell culture and is classified into subgroup G2b that includes PEDV strains responsible for recent severe outbreaks in Korea and the US.",

Seven small intestinal homogenates and 50 stool specimens that tested positive by RT-PCR using an i-TGE/PED Detection Kit (iNtRON Biotechnology, Seongnam, South Korea) were selected for virus isolation experiments. Intestinal homogenates were prepared to 10% (wt/vol) suspensions with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) using a MagNA Lyser (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) by three repetitions of 15 s at a speed of 7000 rpm. Fecal samples were diluted with PBS to be 10% (wt/vol) suspensions. The suspensions were then vortexed and centrifuged for 10 min at 4500 \u00d7 g (Hanil Centrifuge FLETA5, Incheon, South Korea). The supernatant was filtered through a 0.22-m-pore-size syringe filter (Millipore, Billerica, MA) and stored at \u221280 \u2022 C as an inoculum for virus isolation until use. Virus isolation of PEDV was attempted on Vero cells as described previously with some modifications (Hofmann and Wyler, 1988) . Briefly, prior to inoculation, inocula were prepared by adding trypsin (USB, Cleveland, OH) to intestinal or fecal suspensions prepared above to give a final concentration of 10 g/ml. Confluent Vero cells grown in 6-well plates were washed with PBS and inoculated with 400 l of each inoculum containing trypsin. After incubating at 37 \u2022 C for 1 h, 2 ml of virus growth medium [\u2423-MEM supplemented with antibioticantimycotic solutions, 0.3% tryptose phosphate broth (TPB; Sigma, St. Louis, MO), 0.02% yeast extract (Difco, Detroit, MI), 10 mM HEPES (Invitrogen), and 5 g/ml of trypsin] was added. The inoculated cells were maintained at 37 \u2022 C under 5% CO 2 and monitored daily for cytopathic effects (CPE). When 70% CPE appeared, inoculated cells were subjected to three rounds of freezing and thawing. The culture supernatants were then collected and centrifuged at 400 \u00d7 g for 10 min. The clarified supernatants were aliquoted and stored at \u221280 \u2022 C as 'passage 1 (P1)' viral stocks until use. One hundred millimeter diameter tissue culture dishes were used for serial passages of the isolate. If no CPE was shown in inoculated cells for 7 days, the plates were frozen and thawed three times, and the supernatants were harvested by centrifugation and inoculated on fresh Vero cells for the next passage. If CPE and RT-PCR results were negative after 6 blind passages, the virus isolation was considered negative. The PEDV N protein-specific monoclonal antibody (MAb) was obtained from ChoogAng Vaccine Laboratory (CAVAC; Daejeon, South Korea).",

All animals were determined to be free of antibodies to PEDV as well as to transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus. Pigs were randomly assigned to 3 experimental groups housed in 2 separated rooms: PEDV-inoculated (n = 4) and contact control (n = 2) in room 1 and sham-inoculated control (n = 2) group in room 2. Following a 1 day acclimation period, only piglets in the PEDV-inoculated group orally received a 1 ml dose of 10 3 TCID 50 /ml of KNU-141112-P10 virus. Two piglets were exposed to the virus by direct contact with inoculated piglets in the same room. The sham-inoculated pigs were administered with cell culture media as a placebo. Clinical signs of diarrhea and mortality were monitored daily for the duration of the study. Stool samples from all groups were collected prior to inoculation and daily with 16 inch, cotton-tipped swabs and subjected to RT-PCR using an i-TGE/PED Detection Kit and real-time RT-PCR as described above. PEDV-inoculated piglets were necropsied daily (days 1, 2, 3, and 4) after challenge for post-mortem examinations throughout the study, whereas all pigs from the contact and control groups were euthanized at 4 days post-challenge for post-mortem examinations.

One PEDV isolate designated KNU-141112 was successfully isolated from the feces of a naturally infected piglet from a commercial farm located in Kyungpook Province obtained on September 29, 2014. The KNU-141112 virus was capable of producing distinct CPEs typical for PEDV infection, such as cell fusion, syncytium, and detachment, in infected Vero cells from passage 3 (P3). We then investigated whether the isolate can be efficiently cultivated and maintained in cell culture. Thus, the isolated PEDV strain KNU-141112 was further serially passaged in Vero cells for a total of 30 passages (P1 to P30). The time of CPE onset was at 24 hpi and, accordingly, prominent CPE was observed within 48 hpi in the first 2 productive passages (P3 and P4). In the later passages, visible CPE appeared at 12 hpi and became predominant by 24 hpi. Virus propagation was confirmed by detecting PEDV antigens by IFA using a PEDV N protein-specific MAb. The distinct staining was distributed in the cytoplasm of typical syncytial cells. In contrast, no CPE and N-specific staining was evident in mock-inoculated Vero cells. Examples of CPE and corresponding IFA images in selected passages are shown in Fig. 1 . The level of viral genome in each selected passage was further assessed by real-time RT-PCR and the mean cycle threshold (Ct) value was determined to be 16.7, ranging from 15.3 (P10) to 18.7 (P5). The infectious titer of the isolate ranged from 10 5.1 to 10 6.1 TCID 50 /ml up to P5, whereas it was determined to be approximately 10 7 TCID 50 /ml in the later passages. The peak viral titer reached 10 7.8 TCID 50 /ml (equivalent to 10 7.5 PFU/ml) or more since passage 10 ( Fig. 2A) . The growth kinetics study further showed that KNU-141112 replicated rapidly and efficiently in Vero cells, reaching a maximum titer >10 7 TCID 50 /ml by 24 dpi (Fig. 2B) .",

The small intestine was dilated and accumulated with yellow fluid and its wall was thin and transparent, due to the villous atrophy (Fig. 4, panel A) . The stomach was distended and filled with curdled and undigested milk. In contrast, the other intestinal organs appeared grossly normal. Microscopic intestinal observations consistent with viral enteritis were developed in all inoculated and contact piglets, which included vacuolation of small intestinal enterocytes and shortening and fusion of small intestinal villi (Fig. 4, panels B and C) . Similar microscopic lesions were continuously present in the challenged and contact pigs through 4 DPI. Furthermore, both IFA and IHC staining revealed that the viral antigen was predominantly detected in the cytoplasm of epithelial cells on atrophied villi in all segments of the small intestines (Fig. 4 , panels D-F). These finding are comparable to those in pigs naturally or experimentally infected with virulent strains of PEDV (Debouck et isolates.

            "text": "In Korea, three PEDV strains, SM98-1, DR-13, and Chinju99, were initially isolated almost two decades ago in Korea. Genetic and phylogenetic analyses revealed that SM98-1 and DR-13 belong to the classical group 1, whereas Chinju99 is classified into the field epidemic group 2. Of these, only SM98-1 and DR-13 isolates can be grown in cell culture and, accordingly, have been used as commercial vaccine seeds. Since 2008, we have been monitoring the genetic diversity of PEDV prevalent in the field based on the S gene. Our data demonstrated the existence of antigenic and genetic variations between vaccine and field strains, exhibiting a more than 10% amino acid difference in the S1 domain (Lee et al., 2010; Lee and Lee, 2014; Oh et al., 2014) . This may be one of the reasons for the incomplete efficacy of current vaccines in Korea, suggesting that the isolation of field PEDV is required for the development of a next-generation vaccine. Although virus isolation in cell culture from clinical samples of naturally or experimentally infected pigs is fastidious, recent studies reported the successful isolation and propagation of several US original PEDV strains using Vero cells (Chen et al., 2014; Oka et al., 2014) . In this study, we initially sought to isolate PEDV efficiently propagated in vitro from 7 intestine homogenates and 50 fecal samples of naturally infected piglets (field cases) and were able to obtain only 1 isolate from feces in Vero cell culture. The virus isolation rate, in the present study, was less than 2% and was relatively lower than that in recent US studies ranging from 5 to 10% (Chen et al., 2014; Oka et al., 2014) . In previous studies, all isolated PEDV strains originated from intestinal contents of naturally infected or experimentally inoculated pigs, suggesting that intestine samples may be a better source for virus isolation (Chen et al., 2014; Oka et al., 2014) . However, we failed to isolate PEDV from intestine homogenates, which may be due to the number of intestinal contents (n = 7) included in our study and be responsible for the low isolation rate. Although PEDV isolation might be affected by multiple factors, it appears to depend on the number of samples with good quality rather than the type of samples (intestinal contents or feces). Further studies are needed to improve the isolation methodology or to determine the contributing factor(s) to enhance the success rate of PEDV isolation in cell culture. The PEDV isolate, KNU-141112, was cytopathogenic in Vero cells from passage 3 and after passage 5, exhibited more severe and rapid CPE characterized by fusion of infected cells (syncytium or polykaryon formation). The initial viral infectious titers ranged from approximately 5 to 6 log 10 TCID 50 /ml and increased after several more passages reaching to 8 log 10 TCID 50 /ml or more. These growth characteristics, including cytopathology, infectious titer, and growth kinetics were unchanged or even more efficient throughout the experiment (30 passages), indicating that the isolate KNU-141112 is phenotypically stable during serial passages in Vero cells.",

The guinea pig sera raised against the isolate contained high levels of NA (6.4 log 2 ), demonstrating the ability of KNU-141112 to elicit immune responses. On the other hand, the antisera showed a relatively weak neutralizing response (an almost 2-log 2 reduction), when the heterologous vaccine strain SM98-1 was used for an SN test. This weak neutralizing activity of the anti-KNU-141112 guinea pig sera against SM98-1 was somewhat expected because of a high degree of genetic diversity between the S proteins of the vaccine strain and field isolates (Lee et al., 2010; Lee and Lee, 2014; Oh et al., 2014) .",

            "text": "Experimental oral inoculation of nursery pigs with PEDV isolate KNU-141112 induced severe clinical disease typical of acute enteritis throughout the study, demonstrating that the isolate was highly enteropathogenic in neonatal piglets. Onset of clinical signs including lethargy and watery diarrhea in inoculated pigs was found as early as 1 DPI. The PEDV genome was detected in feces in 100% of challenged pigs on DPI 1 and virus quantities from fecal shedding were maintained thereafter in all challenged pigs throughout the study period, leading to the source for direct transmission of virus to other animals. This result is inconsistent with a previous study using a US PEDV strain that demonstrated virus fecal shedding on DPI 1 in only one-fourth of the challenged pigs (Madson Fig. 5 . Phylogenetic analyses based on the nucleotide sequences of the spike genes (A) and the full-length genomes (B) of PEDV strains. A putative similar region of the spike protein and the complete genome sequence of TGEV was included as an outgroup in each panel. Multiple-sequencing alignments were performed using ClustalX program and the phylogenetic tree was constructed from the aligned nucleotide sequences by using the neighbor-joining method. Numbers at each branch represent bootstrap values greater than 50% of 1000 replicates. Names of the strains, countries and years of isolation, GenBank accession numbers, and genogroups and subgroups proposed in this study are shown. The PEDV isolates identified in this study are indicated by solid circles. Scale bars indicate nucleotide substitutions per site. et al., 2014) . The difference between the current and previous studies is the age of the pigs: 1-week-old neonatal pigs and 3-week-old weaned pigs used in the present and previous experiments, respectively. Therefore, younger piglets in this study were more sensitive to PEDV infection shedding virus in feces earlier than older pigs, probably due to an age-dependent disease severity as previously described (Shibata et al., 2000) . IHC and IFA revealed that viral antigen in villous enterocytes were observed at 1 DPI in all segments of the small intestine of inoculated piglets. The onset of clinical signs and viral fecal shedding and the detection time of viral antigen in the target tissue were similar to recent independent reports using different US PEDV strains Jung et al., 2014) . Two non-challenged piglets were included in this study for direct contact to inoculated piglets in the same space. All contact piglets displayed PED-like symptoms within 24 h after the onset of clinical signs in inoculated piglets. The presence of PEDV in feces and infected tissues was further verified in contact piglets, showing 100% morbidity in our study. Mortality averages 50% in suckling piglets up to 1 week of age, often approaching 100% in 1-to 3-dayold piglets, and decreases to 10% thereafter (Saif et al., 2012) . In our study, mortality was observed only in one out of four inoculated piglets, resulting in 25% mortality in the current study involving 8-day-old piglets. For reproducible challenge studies in vivo using the isolate in the future, a neonatal swine bioassay will be needed to determine either the median pig diarrhea dose or lethal dose as a standardized dose and this aspect is currently under investigation.",

            "text": "Whole-genome sequences of 3 Korean PEDV strains (KNU-141112-feces, P5, and P10) were determined using NGS approaches coupled with RACE experiments. Regions covering the structural genes were also sequenced at the selected passages by the Sanger method for confirmation. Compared to the original feces (KNU-141112-feces), only one nt difference at position 21,756 was identified for the first 5 passages (KNU-141112-P5) in cell culture, which led to a non-synonymous mutation at the corresponding position 375 of the S protein. This nt change was initially found at passage 3 and further maintained through passage 30. However, we were unable to investigate whether this mutation had been acquired at the beginning of the Vero cell culture since infectious virus was not obtained during the first two passages. Interestingly, the identical C21756T mutation at the whole-genome level (L375F at the aa level of S) has been previously reported in a US PEDV isolate ISU-19338E during cell culture passage (Chen et al., 2014) , suggesting its potential importance for adaption of the field virus to growth in vitro. At passage 10, two more nt differences at positions 21,448 and 24,492 of the genome (A21448C and G24492C) were detected when compared to KNU-141112-feces. All of the changes acquired in KNU-141112-P10 led to non-synonymous mutations at the respective positions 272 and 1287 of the S protein (K272T and E1287Q). These findings were similar to recent data reported by Chen et al. (2014) that two US isolates individually gained the 4 mutations located in ORF1b, S, and E through passage 9 in cell culture. However, no nucleotide changes were identified in ORF1b and E for the first 10 passages in Vero cells. The 3 mutations in the S protein were persistent for 30 passages in cell culture. Celladapted PEDV vaccine strains, SM98-1 and DR-13, are known to contain a 52-nt deletion spanned from the end of S to the start of ORF3 and a 49-nt deletion in the middle of ORF3. Thus, we further sequenced structural genes of KNU-141112-P20 and -P30 and identified two additional nucleotide changes (G24869T and C25656T) acquiring non-synonymous amino acid mutations in ORF3 and E, respectively. Except for those nucleotide substitutions, the isolate had no extra change, including such large deletions in structural genes through passage 30, indicating the genetic stability of KNU-141112 during serial passages in Vero cells. Sequence comparisons with other PEDV strains showed that KNU-141112 isolates are genetically most similar to recent Korean and US epidemic strains with 99.8-99.9% identities, but most distinctly related to classical strains, CV777, SM98-1, and DR-13, with 96.3-96.8% identities at the genomic level. All phylogenetic analyses based on the complete genome, the full-length S gene, and the S1 portion formed the similar tree structure, revealing that the Korean KNU-141112 strains are clustered together with the re-emergent Korean strains in subgroup 2b that also includes 2013 emergent US strains and 2011-2012 field epidemic Chinese strains.",

To our knowledge, this is the first report describing the isolation and in vitro and in vivo characterization of Korean PEDV associated with the field epidemic. With the availability of the Korean isolate, we are now able to spur the development of new effective and safe vaccines for PED prevention. Indeed, our PEDV isolate has been used for the development of an inactivated vaccine that is currently being evaluated under experimental and field conditions. Furthermore, we are continuing to passage the isolate in Vero cells to develop a live attenuated vaccine that generally prove to provide a more efficient protective immunity than killed viral vaccines. For this purpose, pathogenic and molecular characterization of the isolates at selected passages will be assessed to determine their phenotypes in pigs and to identify the genetic changes involved in PEDV attenuation.",
