In order to study the spike (S) protein of this highly contagious virus, we established a clonal cell-line, CHO-SG, from the Chinese hamster ovary cells that stably expresses C-terminally EGFP-tagged SARS-CoV S protein (S-EGFP). The ectodomain of the S glycoprotein is localized on the surface of CHO-SG cells with N-acetyl-glucosamine-terminated carbohydrate structure. CHO-SG cells associated tightly with Vero E6 cells, a SARS-CoV receptor (ACE2) expressing cell-line, and the interaction remained stable under highly stringent condition (1 M NaCl). This interaction could be blocked by either the serum from a SARS convalescent patient or a goat anti-ACE2 antibody, indicating that the interaction is specific. A binding epitope with lesser degree of glycosylation and native conformation was localized by using rabbit anti-sera raised against five denatured recombinant S protein fragments expressed in Escherichia coli. One of the sera obtained from the fragment encompassing amino acids 48-358 significantly blocked the interaction between CHO-SG and Vero E6 cells. The region is useful for studying neutralizing antibodies in future vaccine development. This paper describes an easy and safe cell-based assay suitable for studying the binding between SARS-CoV S protein and its receptor.",

            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), a deadly disease, is caused by a human coronavirus named SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV). This highly infectious virus killed 774 patients out of 8098 probable SARS cases from November 2002 to July 2003 in 26 countries (Lingappa et al., http://www.cdc .gov/ncidod/EID/vol10no2/03-1032.htm) and had a highly disruptive impact on people's lives as well as the economy. SARS-CoV belongs to the genus of Coronavirus in the family of Coronaviridae, a family of positive sense RNA viruses with large envelopes that propagate in the cytoplasm of host cells and usually cause respiratory diseases in humans and animals. The complete genome of SARS-CoV has been sequenced from different isolates (Marra et al., 2003; Ruan et al., 2003) and it has a coronavirus genome organization with some unique features but is still distantly related to group 2 coronaviruses (Snijder et al., 2003) . The genome is nearly 30 kb in length and encodes 14 open reading frames (ORFs) (Marra et al., 2003; Ruan et al., 2003) including those known coronavirus proteins, such as replicase 1a and 1b and four structural proteins, spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N). The rest of the ORFs are novel and may encode for proteins with unknown functions. At least two of these proteins have been shown to be expressed during SARS-CoV infection (Tan et al., 2004b; Yu et al., 2004; Fielding et al., 2004) . Antibodies against 3a, also termed as U274, were found in the sera of SARS patients (Tan et al., 2004a; Yu et al., 2004) . 0166 Aiming to control the SARS epidemic, we first focused our studies on the S protein for the purpose of diagnosis, and also studied the interaction between S protein and its receptor for vaccine development. The S protein, a type I transmembrane glycoprotein, locates mainly on the outer envelope surface of SARS-CoV. Its precursor is predicted to be 1255 amino acids in length. Residues 1-13 comprise the putative signal peptide and the ectodomain is from residues 14 to 1195 (Marra et al., 2003) . A highly hydrophobic region from residues 1196 to 1226 is predicted to be the transmembrane domain and the rest (residues 1227-1255) are located in the cytoplasm. The S protein of coronavirus plays an important role in the initiation of the viral infection by mediating the attachment of the virus to the cell surface receptors that subsequently induces membrane fusion between the virus and the host. In some coronaviruses, the S protein (group II mouse hepatitis virus [MHV] and group III infectious bronchitis virus) is cleaved to generate two distinct functional subunits, S1 and S2, by virus-encoded or host-encoded proteases (Ziebuhr et al., 2000) . S1 is the Nterminal fragment responsible for the attachment to the target cells; whereas, S2 is required for the fusion (Gallagher and Buchmeier, 2001) . The S2 domain of SARS-CoV S protein can be easily identified by sequence alignment with other coronavirus proteins but the S1 domain is not well conserved (Spiga et al., 2003) . Although, currently there is no evidence to show that there are cleaved S1 and S2 subunits in SARS-CoV-infected cells, the S1 equivalent domain has been cloned and demonstrated to bind the SARS-CoV receptor, ACE2, of host cells . Furthermore, the binding domain of the S protein has been narrowed down to the N-terminal amino acid residues 270-510 (Babcock et al., 2004) , 303-537 (Xiao et al., 2003) and 318-510 (Wong et al., 2004) . In addition to its function in viral entry, the S protein was found to be the major target of the host immune response against coronavirus as it induced neutralizing antibody (Taguchi et al., 1995; Kubo et al., 1994) .",

CHO cells provide the advantages not only because they can be easily maintained and genetically manipulated, but also because they produce proteins with glycans similar to those native glycoproteins found in humans. In order to avoid the high risks involved in handling live SARS-CoV and to understand the S protein of this virus, we established a CHO clone that expressed a significant amount of the recombinant S proteins on the cell surface and demonstrated that it can be used to study the properties of the SARS-CoV S protein. The selection of a high yield clone was facilitated by tagging the S protein with EGFP at the C-terminus (S-EGFP). The green fluorescence was conveniently used to monitor the expression of the protein in living cells and for observing the cell-based binding assay presented in this paper.",

The predicted molecular weight (MW) of SARS-CoV S protein is \u223c180-200 kDa (Xiao et al., 2003) ; therefore, the MW of S-EGFP is approx- imately 207-227 kDa with additional 27 kDa from the EGFP tag (Fig. 2) . These results concur with the observations from another group (Xiao et al., 2003) that the recombinant S protein was intact in the host cells.

For the control in the cell-based binding assay, a stable EGFP-expressing CHO clone (CHO-G) was generated by introducing the plasmid pEGFPN1 into CHO cells. Both CHO-G and CHO-SG were tested for binding to Vero E6 cell layers and the results are shown in Fig. 4A . The CHO-G cells resisted the PBS wash but were detached by the solutions containing supplemented NaCl. In contrast, the binding between CHO-SG and Vero E6 could resist up to 1M NaCl. We sought to investigate the binding specificity of this interaction by testing whether the serum from a recovered SARS patient (P8 in Tan et al., 2004a ) and a goat anti-ACE2 antibody could block the interaction. To test the blocking effect, either CHO-SG cells were pre-treated with human sera before incubated with Vero E6 cell layers, or Vero E6 cells were pre-treated with anti-ACE2 antibody before interacting with CHO-SG. All panels in Fig. 4B were washed with 500 mM NaCl, the controls for the patient's serum was normal human serum, and for anti-ACE2 was PBS. The results showed that both the patient's serum and the anti-ACE2 antibody could block the binding, suggesting that this binding is specifically mediated by the S protein and ACE2.",

Our results showed that the ectodomain of the S protein on the surface of CHO cells mimics the interaction between the virus and Vero E6 cells, presumably through the cellular receptor ACE2. The cellbased binding assay introduced in this paper should facilitate the screening for drugs, peptides or vaccines that block the entry of SARS-CoV, minimizing the use of the highly infectious live virus. The clonal cell-line CHO-SG may be used for large-scale production to supply S-EGFP as a diagnostic marker, and its affinity to WGA is a favorable property to assist the purification of S-EGFP. Although, the expression of S-EGFP on CHO-SG was significant, self-fusion of CHO-SG cells has not been observed in culture, which may be due to the absence or a low level of ACE2 on CHO (ovary) cells (Donoghue et al., 2000) . The expressions of recombinant S protein in full-length or fragments had been demonstrated previously Xiao et al., 2003; Wong et al., 2004) by using human kidney cell-lines 293 or 293T. We also tried two human cell-lines, 293T and Jurkat, to express S-EGFP but stable clones were not established due to the undetectable green fluorescence from G418 resistant colonies.",

Serum sample P6 does efficiently identify the extracellular expression of the S ectodomain on the cell surface of CHO-SG by non-permeable IFA (Fig. 3) , but with lower potency to block the binding (data not shown in Fig. 4B ). Epitopes of SARS-CoV S protein responsible for the binding to ACE2 was first demonstrated to be in the S1 region and then narrowed down to the amino acid residues 270-510 (Babcock et al., 2004) , 303-537 (Xiao et al., 2003) and 318-510 (Wong et al., 2004) . The binding and fusion interactions were performed by using expressed soluble S fragments and the cellular receptor. We used the cell-based binding assay to test the blocking effect for five rabbit anti-S sera raised against five recombinant S fragments and three of these fragments, S 1, S 2 and S 3 (Fig. 5A) covered the a.a. residues from 48 to 790, which overlapped with the predicted S1 domain or the S-ACE2 binding region. However, we were only able to identify a significant blocking effect ( Fig. 5B and C) from anti-S 1 (a.a. 48-358) rabbit serum. In order to rule out non-specific effects from undiluted serum, pre-immune rabbit sera were used as the controls for the binding assay and no blocking effect was ob- Fig. 4 .

Cells were washed once with PBS and followed by three washes with PBS containing different amounts of NaCl as indicated at the bottom of the figure. (B) The photos shown in the upper panels were taken under tungsten lamp and these in the lower panels were taken under green fluorescence. CHO-SG cells were pre-treated with either human normal serum (a) or SARS recovered patient's serum (P8 in Tan et al., 2004a) (b) before being added to the Vero E6 cell layer. The cells were washed with 500 mM NaCl after the incubation with Vero E6 cells.

Rabbit serum anti-S 2 (a.a. 362-790) could not block the binding (or anti-S 3 with less significant effect) may be due to the antigenicities for those modules requiring higher extent of glycosylation or the native conformation. However, although the region of S 1 contains nine predicted N-glycosylation sites, the rabbit antiserum raised against the denatured fragment produced from E. coli was still able to block the binding. This indicates that there is a non-glycosylated and linear epitope within S 1 that is important for S-ACE2 binding. Although the rabbit anti-S serum against S 3 could not block the binding effectively, it was routinely used in a dilution of 1:2000 as primary anti- Fig. 5 .

In patients with SARS, atypical pneumonia and diarrhea were common symptoms caused by SARS-CoV, correspondently the mRNA levels of ACE2 were comparably high in gastrointestinal system and lung (Harmer et al., 2002) and the higher ACE2 protein levels have been demonstrated in the epithelia of the lung and small intestine (Hamming et al., 2004) .
