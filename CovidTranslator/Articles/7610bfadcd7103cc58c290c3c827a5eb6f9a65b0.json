Thus, blocking the binding to ACE2, or blocking host 67 protease cleavage to release the fusion peptide is an efficient strategy to prevent 68 coronavirus entry [3] [4] [5] . To date, one study has assessed the immunogenicity of 69 structural domains of recombinant SARS-CoV-2 S protein [6] . At the time of writing, 70 findings on SARS-CoV-2 linear epitopes remain limited to bioinformatics prediction of 71 human B and T-cell epitopes using SARS-CoV as a model [7] [8] [9] . Five regions on the 72 S glycoprotein of [784] [785] [786] [787] [788] [789] [790] [791] [792] [793] [794] [795] [796] [797] [798] [799] [800] [801] [802] [803] were predicted to be associated with a robust immune response [7] , while 74 other studies reported candidate epitopes [8, 9] that require validation with human 75 patient samples. 76 author/funder.

(c-e) Pooled sera of COVID-19 patients (n=6) were added to plates coated with the corresponding peptides to deplete specific antibodies. (c) Non-depleted and peptide-specific antibody-depleted sera were then subjected to peptide-based ELISA of the peptide (d) or were crossassayed. Data of depleted sera (white) were normalized to percentages of the non-depleted sera (black). Signal from pooled healthy donor sera were displayed as black dotted lines and data are shown as mean \u00b1 SD.

The previously unidentified pathogen, 55 which induces symptoms resembling an infection by the Severe Acute Respiratory 56 Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV), was later identified as a novel coronavirus, 57 SARS-CoV-2 [1]. Within a span of four months, there are more than 750,000 58 laboratory-confirmed cases of human Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), with 59 over 35,000 deaths across 199 countries and territories (For up to date information 60 consult https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-61 reports/). After being declared a pandemic by World Health Organization (WHO) on 62 11 th March 2020, there is a compelling need to understand and develop effective 63 therapeutic interventions against SARS-CoV-2. 64 SARS-CoV-2 uses the spike (S) glycoprotein to bind to the angiotensin-65",

(a-b) Sera of were mixed with pseudotyped lentiviruses expressing SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein protein, prior to incubation with CHO-ACE2 cells for 48 h. Infection levels were determined by luciferase assay, and percentage of infected cells were analyzed. Healthy control and recovered SARS patients (n=5) were also conducted in parallel. (a) Percentage of virus neutralization at 1:1000 sera dilution. IC 50 titer is the reciprocal of sera dilution at which half-maximal neutralization was observed (dotted lines). (b) Dose-response neutralization kinetics from sera (1:50 to 1:12800 dilutions) of selected COVID-19 patients (n=6). Dotted lines indicate 50% neutralization or percentage neutralization of SARS patients (n=5) at 1:100 sera dilution. (c) Preliminary mapping of linear B cell epitopes within SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV S protein. Sera of COVID-19 (n=6) and SARS patients (n=5) at 1:1000 dilution were subjected to peptide-based ELISA for IgG using peptide pools of the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 (pools S1-31) and SARS-CoV (pools S32-62) in duplicates. Sera of pooled healthy donors (n=13) were carried out in parallel. Data were normalized against healthy controls and the subtracted OD values are presented in a heat-map. Blue and pink indicate low and high OD values, respectively. (d-e) Determination of SARS-CoV-2 specific and pan-CoV linear B cell epitopes on S protein. (d) Sera of COVID-19 patients (n=6) were subjected to peptide-based ELISA for IgG detection using individual peptides of SARS-CoV-2 S peptide pools 14 and 21. The z-score values of patient were calculated using the formula [value -average (OD value of patient) / standard deviation (OD value of patient)]. Data shown are from two independent experiments and presented as mean. (e) Peptide binding response of COVID-19 patients on SARS-CoV-2 peptides S14P5 and S21P2, and the corresponding regions on SARS-CoV peptides S45P3 and S51P5, respectively.
