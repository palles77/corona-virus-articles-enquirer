Nucleocapsid isolated in this manner is amenable to ultrastructural evaluation, protein isolation for the production of monospecific hyperimmune serum, and genomic RNA isolation for cDNA cloning. Nucleocapsid (NC) and a defective NC variant (Df-NC) isolated from 5.5 X 10' Vero cells infected with Ond-CDV is readily visualized on cesium gradients. The calculated density for NC is 1.2976 2 0.0033 g/ml and 1.2458 2 0.0056 g/ml for Df-NC. Ultrastructurally, NC appears as long uninterrupted strands, 1.6 5 0.1 p,rn in length, 21.2 ? 1.7 nm in diameter, with well defined capsid subunits. Df-NC are truncated with a uniform length of 85.8 + 7.1 nm and a 24.5 5 1.3 nm diameter. A total of 2.1 ? 0.2 t_~ of NC protein is obtained for every 1 x lo6 cells infected; 89.7% of this mass is represented by a 61 kDa protein (N), 8.4% by a 75 kDa protein (P), and 1.9% by a 160-200 kDa protein (L), which is in agreement with the NC constituency of other paramyxoviruses. Viral N and P proteins, purified by 7.5% SDS-PAGE, were used in the production of hyperimmune serum. Specificity was demonstrated by Western blot analysis. Both antisera were capable of detecting viral antigen in persistently and lytically CDV infected cells by indirect immunofluorescence.",

            "text": "RNA viruses with predilection for central nervous tissue are well recognized for their ability to undergo persistence or latency. In the course of such persistence, chronic demyelinating neurological disease may ensue. Such is the case for murine coronavirus (Sorenson et al., 1987; Virelizier et al., 1975) , Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (Dal Canto and Lipton, 1979) , Semliki Forest virus (Sheahan et al., 1981) , measles virus (MV) (ter Meulen and Carter, 1984) and canine distemper virus (CDV) (McCullough et al., 1974) . This is well illustrated in the case of the paramyxoviruses by the disease entities subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) and old dog encephalitis (ODE), caused by MV and CDV, respectively. An understanding of mechanisms by which persistence is manifested in these systems would provide valuable insights into a fundamental aspect of RNA virus biology and the pathobiology of an important group of neurological diseases. The evolution of the persistent phenotype from the lytic parental virus is believed to be mediated by virus genomic mutation, which occurs with high frequency in RNA viruses (Holland et al.. 1982) . These mutations may be manifested as altered patterns of viral gene expression and may be defined by assessing qualitative and quantitative differences in the level of specific viral gene transcription or translocation.",

This information, in combination with immunocytochemical or immunoadsorption assays employing the appropriate monospecific antibodies, may determine translational levels of the corresponding viral gene transcripts. Recent evidence suggests that it is the initial alteration of major core protein gene expression (N and P in the case of paramyxoviruses) which underlie the establishment of persistence. This is supported by the fundamental role that these proteins play in regulation of viral gene transcription (Kolakofsky et al., 1982; Carlson et al., 1985) and function in the viral polymerase complex (Chinchar and Portner, 1981; Deshpande and Portner, 1985) . Alterations of these proteins are associated with persistence (Sheshberadaran et al., 1985) , and the persistence is characterized by suppressed levels of viral gene transcription and the abnormally high production of readthrough transcripts (Cattaneo et al., 1987) . In addition, unique ultrastructural paramyxoviral nucleocapsid variants have been associated with persistent viral infections (Rozenblatt et al., 1979) . Thus, examination of N and P gene expression in persistent paramyxoviral infection is warranted and requires viral cDNA clones and core protein antibodies for use as probes.",

A linear regression equation relating gel migratory distance to relative mass was established with a correlation coefficient of 0.9995. Using this equation, assignments of 61 and 75 kDa were given to the two major protein species, corresponding to published values for CDV N and P proteins, respectively (Rima et al., 1986) . The third minor species was a high molecular weight protein, migrating in a position compatible with the expected location of the 160-200 kDa distemper virus L protein (Rima et al., 1986) . Based on quantitation of Coomassie staining intensity of viral protein bands compared to that of known quantities of similarly banded and stained BSA, an average of 2.1 -t 0.2 kg of total NC protein was obtained for every 1 x 10\" cells infected. This corresponded to an average of 3.63 x lo6 +-6.7 x 10\" infectious units derived from every 1 x 10\" infected cells. If each infectious unit represents a single encapsidated genome, and the morbillivirus RNA genome, with a mass of 4.5 x 10\" (Baczko et al.. 1983) , represents 5% of the total NC mass (Waters and Bussell, 1974), then it may be established that non-infectious nucleocapsid is contributing approximately 99.98% of the NC protein yield. The N protein represents an average of 89.7% of the total yield, with P contributing X.4% and the putative L protein contributing 1.9%. When protease inhibitors were not used in the isolation procedure, the total yield of intact core protein was reduced by as much as 56% and resulted in disproportionate decreases in P and L relative to N protein (data not shown). In the latter, lower molecular weight bands were evident on ac- rylamide gels of the isolated NC (Fig. 3) and ranged in size from 55 to 44 kDa. This corresponds to published values for the mass of major N protein degradation products (Croce et al., 1980) . Silver staining of NC protein gels where NC was isolated in the presence of protease inhibitors did not reveal degradation products or other minor bands even when 1.5 j.r_g of NC protein was examined.",

The migratory position of the predominant ethidium-stained band is compatible with a 14.6 morbillivirus genome (Udem and Cook, 1984) . Some smearing below the major band is evident, and is interpreted to represent genomic RNA degradation products. Gel electrophoresis of radiolabelled nucleic acid followed by autoradiographic exposure of X-ray film did not reveal the presence of additional minor nucleic acid species. Purified genomic RNA (1.5 ug) was used for cDNA cloning. Based on incorporation of alpha-32P-dCTP, it was determined that 5% of the genomic template was transcribed in the first strand reaction and 100% of the first strand reaction product was converted into cDNA by the second strand reaction. Of the 56.4 ng of double stranded cDNA obtained, 85% (47.9 ng) was larger than 500 base pairs in length with an average size of 1500 bp. This material was size-selected on a 1% agarose gel and the product blunt end ligated into the SmaI site of pUC 9. Twenty transformants were selected for further characterization, bearing inserts with an average size of 1.75 kbp. Fifty percent of these were shown to be virus specific, 4 of which demonstrated positive reactivity with an N gene specific radiolabelled cDNA probe in a dot-blot hybridization of recombinant plasmid.",

The purpose of the modified isolation scheme is to minimize the number of manipulations required in order to maximize yield of recovered intact nucleocapsid while maintaining purity of the isolated product. In addition to examining the applicability of such a scheme to CDV NC isolation, a single approach to obtaining a product amenable to ultrastructural examination, core protein isolation, and genomic RNA isolation was desired. Several isolation techniques have been described in which ultrastructure of the resultant NC has been addressed (Waters and Bussell, 1974; Bussell et al., 1974; Robbins and Abbott-Smith, 1985) . Such an assessment was not performed by Udem and Cook (1984) . In each, significant NC fragmentation or loss was encountered. This may be the result of the method of cell disruption (Waters and Bussell, 1974) , mechanical disruption resulting from increased manipulation (Robbins and Abbott-smith, 1985) or protease degradation of core proteins (Yeh and Iwasaki, 1972; Waters and Bussell, 1974) . Fragmentation precludes critical evaluation of nucleo-capsid length, which is required for the identification of defective NCs. In addition, mechanical fragmentation and loss of capsid proteins via protease degradation may result in fragmentation/loss of genomic RNA since only encapsidated genomic RNA is resistant to nuclease degradation (Baczko et al., 1983) . Yeh and Iwasaki (1972) employed BSA as a competitive protease inhibitor while Robbins and Abbott-Smith (1985) used a rapid isolation technique to minimize the effects of protease activity. However, the latter still encountered less than desirable NC ultrastructural results and the integrity of the genomic RNA was not evaluated. Our technique combines rapid isolation with the use of the protease inhibitors PMSF and Aprotinin.",

Only minimal strand breakage is observed on electron micrographs which is the result of air-drying on the grid surface (unpublished observation). By decreasing NC fragmentation, the resolution of a well-defined gradient band containing NC structures of uniformly truncated length is achieved. Increased NC fragmentation produces particles of heterogeneous length. Smaller fragments may have a sufficiently low sedimentation coefficient that they do not reach an isopycnic gradient position during centrifugation, thereby obscuring the less dense Df-NC bands. The identity of the Df-NC as a unique NC subset is supported by their lesser isopycnic density and uniform length.

It is for this reason that cytoplasmic nucleocapsid is used, as there is a very low level of nucleocapsid incorporation into complete virions with these viruses. For MV, this has been shown to be less than 5% (Moore et al., 1978) . The contribution of infectious virus to the total nucleocapsid yield in our hands is much less. If each infectious unit represents a single encapsidated genome, and since morbillivirus RNA genome, with a mass of 4.5 x lo6 (Baczko et al., 1983) , represents 5% of the total NC mass (Waters and Bussell, 1974) , then it may be calculated that non-infectious NC contributes approximately 99.98% of the NC protein yield. This could be due to a greater contribution by cytoplasmic nucleocapsid in addition to interference with infectivity of intact virions by the protease inhibitors. Detergents, particularly Sarcosyl, were employed by Udem and Cook (1984) to increase the yield of recovered NC. However, they also suffered a concomitant loss of P and L proteins, which they attributed to dissociation facilitated by the presence of detergent.",

Baczko et al.

This group suggests that non-specific interactions between the contaminating nucleic acids and the viral ribonucleoprotein complexes occur, and that attempts to remove these products by increased stringency of NC purification only results in further reductions of the genomic RNA yield. The reason for the high representation of non-viral cDNAs in our bank is likely due to the use of random base oligomers of eukaryotic origin as primer for the first strand cDNA reaction. These primers would be expected to preferentially prime eukaryotic sequences, thereby overrepresenting host sequences in the resultant cDNA product. This preferential priming might also explain the low efficiency of the first strand reaction. To avoid the high representation of host sequences and to increase the first strand reaction yield, random base priming with viral cDNA oligomers may be used. The latter approach is being employed presently in this laboratory.",
