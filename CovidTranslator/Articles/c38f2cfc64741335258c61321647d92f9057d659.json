Persistent or acute allergen or irritant exposure promotes inflammation, bronchoconstriction, and airway hyperresponsiveness on an ongoing basis. Allergen exposure triggers a biphasic response. The \"early response\" occurs within minutes of allergen exposure and results in rhinorrhea, sneezing, itching of the eyes and nose, and bronchospasm secondary to release of histamine and other preformed mediators of inflammation. The \"late-phase response\" peaks 6 to 8 hours after allergen exposure with the development of eosinophilic inflammation and T-cell infiltration of the airway. During an exacerbation of asthma as a result of allergen exposure, both phases must be treated with medications to treat the symptoms of the early phase, as well as the subsequent inflammation of the late phase. 9 Viral infections cause asthma symptoms by promoting eosinophilic or neutrophilic airway inflammation. 4 Viralinduced asthma exacerbations are common in children, and in fact a majority of acute asthma admissions are associated with viral infections in children and adults. 10, 11 The risk for exacerbation of asthma can be modified by a patient's underlying inflammatory state and level of airway hyperreactivity. A patient with reduced airway inflammation because of adequate controller therapy is less likely to have a severe asthma flare when exposed to offending agents.",

Patients often complain of shortness of breath, chest tightness, and wheezing. Some patients describe chest pain, cough, or fatigue. Caregivers may report observations of breathlessness, trouble speaking, decreased activity, retractions, rapid breathing, wheezing noises, or relentless cough. 12 On physical examination, tachypnea is present, often accompanied by tachycardia. Pulse oximetry may reveal decreased oxygen saturation. There is evidence of increased respiratory effort, such as intercostal, supraclavicular, or subcostal retractions. Infants and young children may demonstrate nasal flaring or head bobbing. Paradoxical motion of the thoracoabdominal wall (i.e., expansion of abdominal girth with inspiration) is another useful sign of increased work of breathing. Auscultation of the chest frequently reveals wheezing and a prolonged expiratory phase. Rales or crackles are often heard and may shift in location over a period of minutes to hours (\"migratory atelectasis\"). Assessment of air movement is determined by the loudness of breath sounds in various areas of the chest and may also vary over time. Patients with poor air movement may have minimal wheezing because the passage of air through the airway is what generates wheezing sounds. As air exchange improves, wheezing may become more pronounced. Conversely, patients with a deteriorating clinical course may have diminishing wheezing indicative of worsening air movement and perhaps respiratory insufficiency. Agitation and somnolence are worrisome signs and may indicate hypoxemia or hypercapnia with impending respiratory failure.",

However, because spirometry is often not readily available in the acute care setting, PEFR can be used instead. The hand-held peak flowmeter measures PEFR, and normal values have been established according to age, gender, and height 23 (Table 75-5) . PEFR provides a measure of large-airway flow by measuring the rate of airflow in liters per minute. As a flare or asthma exacerba- tion worsens, PEFR typically becomes lower than baseline and may reflect the severity of the exacerbation. In patients presenting to an emergency room with an asthma exacerbation, FEV 1 is typically 30% to 35% of normal 24 and PEFR is less than 50% of normal. Monitoring PEFR can also assist in tapering medication during the recovery phase of an acute hospitalization. PEFR is effort and technique dependent, and therefore reliability remains a concern. It should be used in conjunction with other parameters of severity for assessment of patients (see Chapter 80) .",

            "text": "This class of medications works by stimulating the \u03b2 2adrenergic receptor and causing activation of adenyl cyclase, which increases the production of cyclic 3\u2032,5-adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). This increase in cAMP, depending on the site of stimulation, results in relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle, stimulation of skeletal and cardiac muscle, and inhibition of the release of inflammatory mediators through stabilization of the mast cell membrane. Albuterol is one of the short-acting \u03b2 2 -adrenergic agents used as firstline therapy for an acute asthma exacerbation because of its ability to rapidly open the airways. Albuterol can be administered by nebulizer, either continuously or intermittently, or by metered-dose inhaler (MDI) with a spacer device. Studies have compared the amount of medication delivered to the lungs when given by MDI with spacer versus nebulizer. [25] [26] [27] The two modes are considered equivalent if the patient can use proper technique with the MDI-spacer method of delivery. Dosing information is provided in Table 75-6. Paradoxical and transient worsening of hypoxia because of increased ventilation-perfusion mismatching can be seen with the administration of albuterol. The medication causes increased cardiac output, which leads to increased perfusion of unventilated lung. 28 Other side effects include sinus tachycardia, tremor, palpitations, headache, agitation, and ventricular irritability (e.g., ventricular premature contractions, ventricular tachycardia). In addition, because frequent or continuous dosing with adrenergic agents can lead to hypokalemia, patients receiving such treatment should have serum potassium levels checked periodically. Nonselective adrenergic agents (e.g., epinephrine) can also cause transient hyperglycemia and elevations in the neutrophil count as a result of demargination.",

Levalbuterol (Xopenex) is made up of the R-isomer, which is thought to be the active component of the racemic product. However, S-albuterol has been found to have some bronchoconstrictive activity in select studies, but not in others, and demonstrates activation of eosinophils in vitro. In addition, S-albuterol is cleared much less rapidly, which can cause buildup of this isomer in vivo as opposed to the L-isomer. However, the vast majority of clinical studies and in vitro pharmacology data have shown no significant differences in cardiopulmonary side effects and tremor when comparing racemic with R-isomer albuterol. [29] [30] [31] One study found decreased rates of admission from an emergency department with the use of levalbuterol versus racemic albuterol. 32 Another study showed improved bronchodilation, 33 but these findings have not been confirmed in other studies. 29, 30, 34 Terbutaline, a selective \u03b2 2 -adrenergic agonist, and epinephrine, a nonselective adrenergic agonist, are used in asthmatics not responding to albuterol and corticosteroids or those who are deteriorating.

They are potent anti-inflammatory medications that have been shown to hasten recovery, prevent recurrence, [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] and prevent hospitalizations. 42 Because of their mechanism of action, the effect of corticosteroids is not immediate. Steroids bind to the intracytoplasmic glucocorticoid receptor and translocate to the nucleus, where they effect RNA transcription in both positive and negative fashion through the transcription factors NF-\u03baB and AP-1. In general, steroids lead to down-regulation of inflammatory cytokines. Corticosteroids also activate histone deacetylase, which inhibits DNA transcription. 43 This change in transcription leads to increased expression of the \u03b2 2 -adrenergic receptor and decreases in airway inflammation and mucus secretion. It can take several hours to reverse airway inflammation, and benefits are typically seen within 4 hours after the administration of corticosteroids. 38, 39, 44 Studies comparing oral and intravenous corticosteroids have found no sig-nificant differences in efficacy. 45, 46 Oral steroids are typically preferred because intravenous access is not required. 45, 47 Suggested dosing of corticosteroids is provided in Table 75 -8.",

Physicians should provide assistance for caregivers to quit smoking. Appropriate preventive medications based on daily symptoms and frequency of exacerbations should be maintained on a daily basis. These medications are essential for the prevention of asthma flares. Multiple studies have shown a strong negative correlation between hospital admission for asthma and the use of daily inhaled corticosteroids. Suggested doses and regimens have been established through national and worldwide collaboration between primary physicians, allergists, pulmonologists, and others. An example is seen in Tables 75-12 through 75-14. Peak flowmeters can be helpful in managing asthma, if used appropriately. 89 However, studies comparing peak flow monitoring with symptom recognition show no benefit of peak flow-based action plans over those based on symptoms alone. [89] [90] [91] Peak flowmeters have numeric indicators that allow the creation of green, yellow, and red zones (see Table  75 -5). Green represents the \"good\" or \"all clear\" zone and is 80% to 100% of a child's personal best. The yellow zone is 50% to 80% of the personal best and indicates a time when the family should be \"cautious\" because the child may be having or is at risk for asthma symptoms. Asthma reliever medications should be started and contact with the physician considered. The red zone is indicated by a PEFR less than 50% of normal; it is cause for concern and requires a visit to the emergency room or a call to the doctor. 4 Peak flow monitoring is typically helpful for children who are not good at recognizing symptoms of asthma. Current NHLBI guidelines recommend either a symptom-based or peak flow-based management plan.",
