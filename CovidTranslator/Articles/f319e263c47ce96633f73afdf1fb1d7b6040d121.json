            "text": "Most coronaviruses studied in detail to date can be described as having three or four unique major structural proteins [29, 34] . A predominant phosphorylated nucleocapsid (N) protein with a molecular weight ranging from 50,000 to 60,000 is associated with the non-segmented, positive-stranded RNA genome. There are two major virus-encoded envelope proteins: a transmembrane glycoprotein with an approximate mol.wt, of 25-30,000 acting as a matrix protein (E 1) and the peplomer protein (E2), a glycoprotein with a mol.wt, of 170,000-200,000 that makes up the large surface projections of the virus. The peplomeric protein E2 often is posttranstationally cleaved by host-cell proteases into two subunits with mol.wts, of 85-100,000 [3, 19, 35] . The E2 glycoprotein is responsible for virus attachment and cell membrane fusion, and elicits the production of virus-neutralizing antibodies [9, 18, 20, 38] . The hemaggtutinin of the hemagglutinating mammalian coronaviruses is made of an additional glycoprotein with a mol.wt, of 130-140,000 comprized of disulfide-linked 65,000 subunits [8, 9, 13, 15] .",

            "text": "Many enteric coronaviruses are difficult to grow in tissue cultures; consequently, little is known about their molecular and antigenic structure [29, 30] . The turkey enteric coronavirus (TCV), recognized as one of the major causative agents of epidemic diarrhea in turkey poults, is an example of this group [11, 22] . Previous attempts to adapt TCV isolates to different types of cultured chicken and turkey embryonic cells were unsuccessful [25, 26] . The prototype Minnesota strain was maintained by oral inoculation and intestinal infection of one-day old turkey poults, or by inoculation into the amniotic cavity of embryonating turkey or hen eggs [10, 26] . Our previous studies on the morphology and some of the biological activities of egg-adapted TCV isolates have revealed the presence of two morphologically distinct types of peplomers at the surface of the TCV virion, and the virus also possesses an hemagglutinating activity [5, 6] . Low quantity of material obtained at the end of the preparation of \"pure virus\" and residual host-cell contaminating proteins of egg-adapted virus raised difficulties in distinguishing specific viral components from degraded or host proteins [6] . TCV isolates purified from the intestinal contents of turkey embryos were resolved into four to seven major polypeptides ranging in molecular weights from 27,000 to 180,000 and were identified as viral components on the basis of their reactivity with specific antisera [6] . The exact nature of these polypeptides and their location on the TCV virion remained to be determined.",

Three visible bands were obtained following centrifugation in the continuous sucrose gradient, but infectivity and HA activity were restricted to the band corresponding to a buoyant of 1.18-1.20g/ml ( Fig. 1 A) .

The structural nature of the polypeptides resolved by SDS-PAGE of purified virus was confirmed by Western immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation experiments, using anti-TCV hyperimmune serum previously obtained from immunization of rabbit with original egg-adapted virus. Four major viral protein species were identified and their location on the virion was deduced from digestion studies using various proteolytic enzymes. The TCV structural proteins consist of three glycoproteins of 180-200,000, 140,000, and 24,000 which were shown to correspond to the peplomer, hemagglutinin and matrix proteins, and a predominant unglycosylated 52,000 species that apparently represents the nucleocapsid protein. A similar polypeptide pattern has been described previously with virus purified from the intestinal contents of turkey embryos [6] . Polypeptide species of 72-75,000, and 45,000 earlier identified were probably host-cell contaminating proteins, or degradation products of the viral components resulting from their digestion by intestinal proteases.

The glycosylated species with a mol.wt. in excess of 200 K probably correspond to a multimeric form of the peplomeric glycoprotein as it was previously described for the human OC43 strain and BCV [13, 15] , and for IBV [31] . Proteolytic cleavage of the TCV peplomer protein appeared to occur quite efficiently, as gp 100 and gp 120 were the predominant forms resolved by SDS-PAGE. This also appears to be true for BCV and HCV OC43 [13, 14] . The degree of posttranslational cleavage of the MHV-A59 strain was found to be a function of host cell type [12] . Although, we did not investigate the susceptibility of the TCV gp200 in different cell types, it was previously found that the virus could induce polykaryocytosis in HRT-18 cells only if trypsin was added to the maintenance medium. Addition of trypsin to the medium of TCV-infected primary chicken or turkey embryo kidney cell lines did not permit expression of the cytopathogenicity of the virus. The trypsin cleavage of gp200 of TCV seemed thus necessary for the acquisition of the fusion activity, and therefore for the infectivity of the virus, but host cell intrinsic factors are probably also involved. Similar findings were observed for MHV and BCV [32, 35] , and with several strains of IBV [3] which do not form plaques unless trypsin is added to the overlay medium.",

The disappearance of gp46 from the gel following digestion with pronase and bromelain, concomitant with a reduction in the amount of gp24, suggested the close relationship between these two viral components. The gp46 species may represent a dimer of the matrix protein as demonstrated for BCV and HCV OC43 [9, 13] . Similarly, a t 60K unglycosylated polypeptide was occasionally revealed by Western immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation. It may correspond to a polymer, possibly a trimer, of the nucleocapsid protein as suggested for BCV [8, 9] and HCV OC43 [13] on the basis of its reactivity with anti-N antibodies.",

Biochemical data confirmed the absence of the high mol.wt, glycoproteins (gp200/100, gp 140/66) consistent with a glycosylation process that involves attachement of oligosaccharide side chains via N-glycosidic bonds to asparagine residues, as demonstrated for other coronaviruses [23, 34] . The matrix protein of TCV is apparently glycosylated by a similar process; following cultivation in the presence of TM, gp24 failed to react with the anti-TCV serum after Western immunoblotting and had a slightly higher mobility as demonstrated by immunoprecipitation. Our finding that gp24 was present after immunoprecipitation, but not after Western immunoblotting (Fig. 5A ), may be explained by nonspecific co-precipitation by the antiserum of viral proteins with high mutual affinity [33] . In contrast, for Western immunoblotting, to be visible proteins should be individually immunoreactive (i.e., sufficient amount and suitable conformation of epitopes). The inhibition of glycosylation of the matrix protein was also suggested by disappearance of gp46. In this respect, TCV resembles the avian infectious bronchitis virus [31] , but differs from the mammalian coronaviruses MHV-A 59 and BCV. The analogous protein of these mammalian coronaviruses undergoes O-linked glycosylation by a process which is resistant to TM and involves attachment of oligosaccharides to serine residues [8, 28] .",
