The epidemic curves presented in Figures 1 and 2 are generated using National Notifiable Disease Surveillance System (NNDSS). Epidemic curve by date of onset precedes epidemic curve by date of diagnosis by few days or a week (Figure 1). It must be noted that the date of symptom onset may change depending on the results of further epidemiological investigation, and delayed reporting of cases. Figure 2 depicts epidemic curve by different regions of Korea: the nationwide, Daegu, Gyeongbuk, and Others (outside Daegu and Gyeongbuk). From mid-February an increased number of cases was reported with a peak in the late February and early March. Figure 3 shows the age distribution and sex ratio among Daegu, Gyeongbuk, and Others regions. Note the increased proportion of cases in 20-29 years and in females among cases in Daegu and Gyeongbuk.
