            "text": "The safety and immunogenicity of two authentic recombinant (ar) Rift Valley Fever (RVF) viruses, one with a deletion in the NSs region of the S RNA segment ) and the other with a large deletion of the NSm gene in the pre Gn region of the M RNA segment (arMP-12\u0394NSm21/384) of the RVF MP-12 vaccine virus were tested in crossbred ewes at 30 -50 days of gestation. First, we evaluated the neutralizing antibody response, measured by plaque reduction neutralization (PRNT 80 ), and clinical response of the two viruses in groups of four ewes each. The virus dose was 1 \u00d7 10 5 plaque forming units (PFU). Control groups of four ewes each were also inoculated with a similar dose of RVF MP-12 or the parent recombinant virus (arMP-12). Neutralizing antibody was first detected in 3 of 4 animals inoculated with arMP-12\u0394NSm21/384 on day 5 post inoculation and all four animals had PRNT 80 titers of \u2265 1:20 on day 6. Neutralizing antibody was first detected in 2 of 4 ewes inoculated with arMP-12\u0394NSs16/198 on day 7 and all had PRNT 80 titers of \u2265 1:20 on day 10. We found the mean PRNT 80 response to arMP-12\u0394NSs16/198 to be 16-to 25-fold lower than that of ewes inoculated with arMP-12\u0394NSm21/384, arMP-12 or RVF MP-12. No abortions occurred though a single fetal death in each of the arMP-12 and RVF MP-12 groups was found at necropsy. The poor PRNT 80 response to arMP-12\u0394NSs16/198 caused us to discontinue further testing of this candidate and focus on arMP-12\u0394NSm21/384. A dose escalation study of arMP-12\u0394NSm21/384, showed that 1 \u00d7 10 3 plaque forming units (PFU) stimulates a PRNT 80 response comparable to doses of up to 1 \u00d7 10 5 PFU of this virus. With further study, the arMP-12\u0394NSm21/384 virus may prove to be a safe and efficacious candidate for a livestock vaccine. The large deletion in the NSm gene may also provide a negative marker that will allow serologic differentiation of naturally infected animals from vaccinated animals.",

The NSm and 78-kDa proteins are not essential for RVFV replication in cell culture [14] , whereas a RVFV mutant lacking the pre-Gn region is less pathogenic than RVFV carrying the pre-Gn region in rats [13] , indicating NSm, which has anti-apoptosis function, affects viral pathogenicity [16] [17] [18] [19] .

In Phase II, graded doses of arMP-12\u0394NSm21/384 were tested in groups of 4 to 10 animals. The ewes were examined daily by a veterinarian or trained veterinary animal specialists. Whole blood was collected prior to inoculation (Day -7), the day of inoculation (Day 0), daily through Day 7 or 14, and periodically thereafter through Day 62 or 69. Rectal temperatures and health status were documented daily. The ewes were euthanized with pentobarbital sodium (120 mg/kg i.v.) prior to term. Necropsies were performed on each ewe and fetus and tissues were collected for virus isolation, histopathologic examination, and immunohistochemistry (IHC).

We elected to perform a dose escalation study of this vaccine candidate to determine the optimum safe and immunogenic dose. The animals in this Phase were terminated at 62 days after inoculation. Tables 2 through 4 (Table 3) , a virus titer of 2 \u00d7 10 1 PFU/ml, determined by direct plaque assay, was detected in the serum of ewe #41 on Day 4 only. PCR analysis of the recovered virus, after amplification in Vero E6 cells, showed a partial deletion in the M segment. RNA sequencing of that virus was not done. In contrast, no virus or viral RNA was recovered from the other three ewes. At termination of the study, the PRNT 80 titer of the viremic ewe was 4-fold higher than the cohorts ( Table 2 ). The viremic ewe was not pregnant and a 10 cm retroperitoneal abscess was observed that adhered to the uterus and large and small intestine.

We were able to detect viral RNA in one of the two dead fetuses but advanced postmortem autolysis precluded visualizing definitive microscopic lesions. The estimated age of the dead fetus in the arMP-12 group suggests it died around the time the ewe was inoculated. We recovered viral RNA from the autolyzed fetus in the MP-12 group but not enough to amplify. Prenatal losses in livestock due to early embryonic or fetal death can be substantial and may be due to a variety of causes and combination of factors [39, 40] .

There were no marked differences within and between the three higher dosage groups but one animal (ewe #64) in the 1 \u00d7 10 5 PFU dose group developed a low PRNT 80 titer of 1:20. MP-12 vaccine is temperature sensitive and perhaps the elevated rectal temperature at the time of inoculation and pyrexia on Day 4 contributed to poor virus replication resulting in a suppressed PRNT 80 response and lack of detectable IgG in that ewe [41] . Only one ewe (ewe #38) in the 1 \u00d7 10 2 PFU dose group developed a neutralizing antibody titer >1:20 yet there was no statistically significant difference in the IgG response between the four dosage groups ( Figure 2B ). The differences in PRNT 80 responses between the Phase I and Phase II arMP-12\u0394NSm21/384 groups receiving the same dose of vaccine is surprising but may be a reflection of group and individual variability.
