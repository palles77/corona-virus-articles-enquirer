The latter group of investigators observed that a mixture of TMV and anti-TMV rabbit (11).] serum resulted in aggregation of the virus particles ( Fig. 1) , whereas by contrast such aggregation did not occur when the virus was reacted with a control normal rabbit serum (Fig. 2 ). Anderson and Stanley made similar observations and, in addition, demonstrated the electronmicroscopic specificity of the reaction by observing the lack of such reactivity between TMV and rabbit antiserum to tomato bushy stunt virus (Fig. 3) , and between tomato bushy stunt virus, and anti-TMV rabbit serum ( Fig. 4 ) . These studies were, indeed, the first demonstration of the method that was later termed immune or immuno-electron microscopy (IEM)-a technique which may be defined as the direct observation by electron microscopy of antigen-antibody interaction ( 8, 53a ) .",

Figure 5 shows a single particle Fig. 4 . Tobacco mosaic virus ( TMV ) and tomato bushy stunt virus after treatment with TMV rabbit antiserum. The TMV particles were aggregated by this serum, whereas the tomato bushy stunt virus particles were not aggregated by it. [After Mudd (67) in which the figure was reproduced after Morton (66) , from the study of Anderson and Stanley (10) .] of rhinovirus 1A from a control preparation in which the virus, which had been grown in monolayer cell cultures and had a titer of 10 5 TCID 5( )/0.2 ml, was reacted with PBS. The particles shown in this figure is probably the virus, but it was often difficult to determine with certainty whether or not a particular structure was a virus particle especially since even such probable virus particles were seen only infrequently. Figure 6 shows several rhinovirus 13 particles from another control preparation. The particles were present in greater number since this suspension had been prepared in spinner culture (77) and was higher titered ( 10 7 5 TCID 50 /0.2 ml) (46) . In spite of this, it was still difficult to be certain whether a particular structure was or was not a virus particle. In both of these preparations the scattered particles were distributed randomly over the grid squares. By contrast, in the virus and homologous goat antiserum mixtures, both large and small aggregates were observed, Fig. 5 . A single particle of rhinovirus 1A from a control preparation in which rhinovirus 1A was incubated with phosphate-buffered saline prior to further preparation for electron microscopy. Particles were randomly distributed, and it was difficult to determine whether certain objects were virus particles. The bar = 100 nm. [After Kapikian et al (46) .] as shown for rhinovirus 13 in Fig. 7 . The particles were no longer randomly distributed but were present as aggregates that stood out clearly from the background matter. There was no longer any doubt about the appearance of the virus since the virus-antibody reaction had resulted in the formation of distinctive aggregates that could be easily visualized, as shown also for rhinovirus 1A in Fig, 8 . Optimal antibody concentration resulted in maximal clumping of particles, whereas extreme antibody excess not only tended to obscure the particles but also often hindered the formation of aggregates.",

Therefore, following my return to the National Institutes of Health, we began to look for one of these fastidious agents of human disease, the coronaviruses, using IEM.",

Examination of the HETOC harvest-PBS mixture did not reveal any coronavirus paricles but only predominantly round or ovalshaped structures (Fig. 10A-D) . Additional studies were made by IEM to determine if this coronavirus strain, designated as 692, was related to coronaviruses 229E and OC43, the only known distinct coronaviruses of human origin that we have been able to propagate in either cell cultures or an animal system or both in our laboratory (17, 39, 45, 48, 49) . In serological tests by IEM in which the presence or absence of aggregation with different sera was used as the measure of serological reactivity (4, 5, 8) , aggregates, although less numerous than in the initial experiment, were observed following incubation of strain 692 with the homologous convalescent serum, but not with specific animal antisera to the other two coronaviruses, indicating that by this test system strain 692 was not related serologically to strains OC43 and 229E (50) .

This self-limited disease, which is characterized by a spectrum of clinical symptoms which may include vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain, or a combination thereof, affects a broad segment of the population and was the second most common disease experience in the Cleveland family study (12, (23) (24) (25) 35) . The disease, which has been given various descriptive names, such as winter vomiting disease and epidemic diarrhea and vomiting, was transmitted to volunteers in the 1940s and 1950s, and again more recently in the 1970s, but all attempts to cultivate and characterize definitively an etiological agent in vitro have failed (12, 21, 26, 27, 30, 33-36, 43, 55, 72, 76) . In one of these studies, by Dolin et al. (27) , a filtrate prepared from a rectal swab specimen from an adult who developed a secondary case of acute nonbacterial gastroenteritis during an outbreak in Norwalk, exclusively as groups that stood out clearly from the surrounding matter. ( D ) A single particle of coronavirus strain 692 was also found on the same grid on which particles in A, B, and C were observed. This particle appears to be covered with little, if any, antibody. The bars = 100 nm. [After Kapikian et al (50) .] The human embryonic trach\u00e9al organ culture harvest from a washing from patient 692 was incubated with phosphate-buffered saline prior to further preparation for electron microscopy in the same experiment described for Fig. 9 . No coronavirus particles were observed, only predominantly round or oval-shaped objects. The bar = 100 nm. [After Kapikian et al (50) .] Ohio (3), induced the typical illness in two of three volunteers following its oral administration (27) . It was serially passaged two additional times in volunteers by Dolin et al. (26, 27) and again induced the typical illness. Characterization studies (26) in volunteers revealed that the infectious agent in Norwalk outbreak-derived filtrates was less than 66 nm in diameter and probably less than 36 nm, and, in addition, was not inactivated by ether, acid, or heating at 60\u00b0C for 30 minutes. However, attempts to cultivate the infectious agent in cell cultures and animals were uniformly unsuccessful, and attempts in human embryonic intestinal organ cultures, inconclusive (12, 26) .",

A 2% second human passage Norwalk-derived stool filtrate (designated 8FIIa) was used as antigen in the IEM studies (51) . It had been filtered through a 1200-and a 450-nm membrane filter and was known to contain an infectious agent since it had induced gastroenteritis in 6 of 10 volunteers, but extensive attempts to recover or detect an etiological agent by conventional techniques were unsuccessful (83) . We, therefore, examined this filtrate for the presence of virus particles by IEM utilizing, as in the coronavirus study, a volunteer's convalescent serum as the source of specific antibody; the serum was obtained from an experimentally infected volunteer who had developed the typical illness. This approach was taken in the hope that virus particles would appear in the form of aggregates thereby enabling the visualization and the recognition of a viral agent present in low titer. The IEM technique was similar to that outlined previously in the coronavirus study except for minor modifications (51) .",

In a manner similar to that described for the coronavirus studies, 0.2 ml of a 1:5 dilution of uninactivated serum was incubated with 0.8 ml of the stool filtrate and prepared for IEM. Antibody evaluations were made on coded specimens in order to eliminate the possibility of biased interpretation. Routinely, five squares on each grid were examined and the relative concentration of antibody in each serum specimen was estimated by judging the amount of antibody coating the aggregated particles on a 0 -4 + scale. Three or more particles in a group were considered to constitute an aggregate. A rating of 0 (i.e., no antibody) was assigned when no aggregates were seen, whereas a 4 + rating indicated that the aggregated particles were SO heavily coated with antibody that they were almost obscured. Single and paired particles that were heavily coated with antibody, thereby enabling their easy recognition, were observed along with aggregates in some convalescent sera which had high levels of antibody. Ratings of 1-f-, 2 + , and 3 + indicated the presence of antibody but in lesser amounts than that rated 4 + . A 1 + change in antibody rating between paired sera was considered to be significant. Examples of aggregates scored as 1 + and 4 + are shown in Fig. 12 . Serum of volunteer A was scored as 1 + since the particles were well-defined and appeared to be covered with very little antibody, whereas that of volunteer B was scored as 4 + since the particles so heavily coated with antibody were almost obscured (51) . Heavily coated particles were usually found in small aggregates (or as single or paired units), whereas those with less antibody usually formed larger aggregates. An example of what is considered to be a significant seroresponse, as observed by IEM, with a single volunteer's paired sera is shown in Fig. 13 . As seen in the Table 1 , all 4 volunteers who developed gastroenteritis following administration of a second human passage Norwalk stool filtrate developed serological evidence of infection to the 27-nm particle as determined by IEM. A fifth volunteer, who did not develop illness, did not demonstrate a significant antibody response to this agent. Representative aggregates observed by IEM with this volunteer's pre-and postinoculation sera (rated 1 + and 1-2+, respectively) are shown in Fig. 14. Aggregates were not observed in PBS-Norwalk stool filtrate mixtures when such controls were utilized in certain of these serological studies (Table 1) .",

            "text": "Although all 4 volunteers who developed illness after challenge with the stool filtrate developed serological evidence of infection, it was possible that the observed particles might represent a virus not related to the etiological agent of the Norwalk outbreak, since it was conceivable that an adventitious agent could either have been present in the stool of the patient from the original Norwalk outbreak or could have been acquired during passage through volunteers. We examined this possibility by testing paired sera from 6 individuals from the original Norwalk outbreak. Four were primary cases, 1 a secondary case, and 1 a contact who did not become ill. [Serum samples were kindly supplied by Drs. Hatch, Adler and Zickl (3).] As shown in Table 1 , 3 of the 5 individuals with naturally acquired Norwalk gastroenteritis developed an increase in antibody to the 27-nm particle as determined in tests of paired sera by IEM, whereas the 2 who did not show such an increase demonstrated a high level of antibody in both acute and convalescent sera. The acute stool filtrate with 0.2 ml of a 1:5 dilution of a volunteer's prechallenge serum and further preparation for electron microscopy. This volunteer developed gastroenteritis following challenge with a second passage Norwalk filtrate which had been heated for 30 minutes at 60 \u00b0C (26) . The quantity of antibody on the particles in this aggregate was rated 1 -2 -2 + and this prechallenge serum was given an overall rating of 1-2-f. (B) A single particle and ( C ) three single particles observed after incubating 0.8 ml of the Norwalk ( 8FIIa ) stool filtrate with 0.2 ml of a dilution of the volunteer's post challenge convalescent serum and further preparation for EM. These particles are very heavily coated with antibody. The quantity of antibody on these particles was rated 4-|-and the serum was given an overall rating of 4-J-also. The difference in the quantity of antibody coating the particles in the prechallenge and postchallenge sera of this volunteer is clearly evident. The bar = 1 0 0 nm and applies to A, B, and C. phase sera were not collected until several days after the onset of disease and this could explain our failure to detect a response in 2 of the patients. The contact who did not become ill did not exhibit a serum response. It is of interest that among the seroresponders was donor ( J ) of the original rectal swab specimen which had been used to induce illness in 2 of the 3 volunteers in the 1971 study (27) . We examined by IEM the prechallenge and convalescent sera of these 2 volunteers and found that 1 developed an increase in antibody whereas the other did not. The development of a significant increase in antibody by 3 of 5 individuals with naturally induced illness suggested strongly that the 27-nm particle was not an adventitious agent acquired during passage in volunteers and, furthermore, indicated that this viruslike agent had also infected patients in the Norwalk outbreak. Finally, we investigated the possibility that gastrointestinal disease might stimulate the observed antibody responses by a nonspecific mechanism. In another study, volunteers were first administered either a stool filtrate containing an infectious agent from a secondary case of gastroenteritis that had occurred in Honolulu, Hawaii, or from a secondary case that had occurred in Montgomery County, Maryland (83) . Those volunteers who became ill after primary challenge were later rechallenged with the same agent and homologous immunity was demon- strated. Subsequently, challenge with a filtrate derived from the Norwalk outbreak produced disease, indicating that the infectious agent in the filtrate derived from the Hawaii and from the Maryland cases differed from that of Norwalk. Sequential sera from 2 volunteers who underwent the sequence of the three challenges just described were studied by IEM with the Norwalk filtrate (8FIIa) again as antigen ( Table 2 ). The volunteer who received the filtrate derived from the Hawaii case failed to develop an increase in antibody following gastroenteritis induced by the primary challenge, but did develop a significant response after illness induced by the Norwalk filtrate, suggesting that the IEM seroresponse was specific. The other volunteer developed an increase in antibody after gastroenteritis induced by primary challenge, and a further increase after illness induced by the Norwalk filtrate, suggesting that the infectious agents in the Maryland and Norwalk filtrates may have been antigenically related (51) .",

Additional evidence to support this view has emerged from recent studies in our laboratory, in which the technique of IEM was used to determine shedding patterns of the Norwalk agent (78) . These studies revealed by IEM the presence of the 27-nm Norwalk particle in stool filtrates derived from 11 of 23 volunteers who developed illness following challenge with Norwalk outbreak-derived stool filtrates. A total of seventy-seven stool filtrates were studied by IEM using a single convalescent serum known to contain a high level of antibody to the Norwalk particle. It was noteworthy that the 27-nm particle was observed in none of 12 specimens obtained prior to the onset of illness, in 26 of 54 collected during the first 72 hours after the onset of illness, and in only 2 of 11 obtained 72 hours following the onset of illness. Tabulation of the total number of particles observed by IEM in five grid squares in stool filtrates derived from serial stool samples from 8 particle-positive volunteers revealed that the shedding of the 27-nm particle was maximal at the onset of experimental illness and shortly thereafter ( Fig. 15 ).

The total number of particles in the gradient was determined and the number in each fraction expressed as a percentage of the total number of particles; the highest percentage of particles was seen in Fraction 4 which had a mean density of 1.403 (Fig. 17) . Examples of some of the aggregates observed in Fraction 4 and in Fraction 5, which had the second highest percentage of particles, are shown in Fig. 18 . In two additional isopycnic banding experiments in cesium chloride, the peak fractions were found by IEM to be at densities of 1.376 and 1.413 gm/cm 3 , respectively. On the basis of its buoyant density, it appears that the Norwalk agent is not an enterovirus, the latter having a lower buoyant density in cesium chloride (74) . Although the Norwalk agent has a density Table 1 ). (A, B) Aggregates observed in Fraction 4; ( C ) an aggregate in Fraction 5. [After Kapikian et al. (47) .] similar to that of a rhinovirus in cesium chloride, it can also be excluded from this subgroup of the picornaviruses since rhinoviruses are acidlabile, whereas an infectious stool filtrate derived from the Norwalk outbreak has been shown by Dolin et al. to be acid stable (26, 37, 44, 74, 79) . Although the nucleic acid content of the Norwalk particle has not yet been determined, it appears that this agent, as previously suggested by Dolin et al. from volunteer studies (26) , is parvovirus-like since it not only has a similar buoyant density in cesium chloride but also shares other properties with this group such as morphology, and, as shown in volunteer studies cited above, ether, acid, and relative heat stability (26, 41) .",

These extracts consisted of the supernatant fluids of approximately 20% fecal suspensions in normal saline which had been shaken for homogenization and then centrifuged at low speed (32) . The original specimens had been obtained from each of 4 adult volunteers, from the Joliet, Illinois studies, who developed hepatitis after receiving either orally or parenterally the MS-1 or MS-1-derived strain of hepatitis A virus (14, 56) . The extracts, which were derived from stools obtained prior to challenge and during the acute phase of illness from each volunteer, were further diluted to a 2% suspension and passed through a 450-nm membrane filter. All of the stool filtrates were examined by IE M using a volunteer's convalescent phase serum as a source of specific antibody for reasons similar to those in the gastroenteritis studies; commercial immune human serum globulin was also used to examine two pairs of these filtrates.",

No significant particles were observed in two stool filtrates derived from prechallenge stools of these two volunteers, after incubation of the filtrates with the same convalescent serum or immune serum globulin as above. The 27-nm particles stood out clearly from the surrounding matter and were easily differentiated from other numerous spherical objects usually found in stool filtrates because the former occurred either as single particles heavily coated with antibody or as particles in groups aggregated by antibody (Fig. 19) . Later in the study, we found similar appearing particles, which were much fewer in number and occurred as single particles, in one of two stool filtrates derived from stools of Fig. 19 . Hepatitis A viruslike particles observed after 1 ml of the 2% stool filtrate was incubated with 0.1 ml of a 1:10 dilution of a convalescent serum or a 1:20 dilution of immune human serum globulin followed by further preparation for electron microscopy. An aggregate ( A ) , a single particle ( B ) , and a doublet ( C ) observed following incubation of the stool filtrate with a convalescent serum from a patient from the Joliet, Illinois, study. The particles are heavily coated with antibody. The quantity of antibody in this serum to the hepatitis A particle was rated 3-4-f-\u00b7 (D, E, F, and G) Hepatitis A, viruslike particles observed following incubation of 1 ml of the stool filtrate with immune serum globulin. The particles are heavily coated with antibody also. The quantity of antibody in this lot of immune serum globulin to the hepatitis A particle was also scored 3 -4 + . The bar = 100 nm and applies to A-G. [Micrographs A, B, F, G from Feinstone et al. (29) .] A. Usually, 0.1 ml of a 1:10 dilution of an uninactivated serum was mixed with 0.9 ml of the stool filtrate and examined by IEM with minor modifications of the technique used in the gastroenteritis studies. The relative concentration of antibody in each serum specimen was again estimated by scoring the amount of antibody coating the particle on a 0 to 4 + scale. One difference between the 8FIIa gastroenteritis and hepatitis A filtrates was the latter contained fewer particles and, therefore, in the presence of antibody, the hepatitis A antigen occurred frequently as individual particles coated with antibody and less often in the form of antigen-antibody aggregates. However, although the particles were fewer, the rating for antibody was somewhat simplified since antibodycoated single particles were generally more quickly visible, since they appeared to be randomly distributed whereas aggregates generally were not. As before, antibody evaluation of paired sera were made on coded specimens in order to eliminate the possibility of biased interpretation.",

As shown in Table 3 , all 6 of these experimentally infected hepatitis A patients developed serological evidence of infection with the 27-nm, hepatitis A, viruslike particle as determined by IEM. However, since the hepatitis A containing inoculum used in both experimental studies was derived from the same source (MS-1), it was conceivable the seroresponses might have been due to an unknown adventitious agent in the original MS-1 inoculum and thus may have had no relationship to hepatitis A. We examined this possibility by testing paired sera from 3 individuals who developed hepatitis A in a small naturally occurring hepatitis A outbreak in American Samoa in 1972 (73) and, in addition, from 3 individuals who developed this disease during a naturally occurring hepatitis A outbreak in Massachusetts in 1969-the Holy Cross College football team outbreak (65, 82) . We found, as shown in Table 3 , that all 6 developed serological evidence of infection to the 27-nm hepatitis A particle by IEM, thereby suggesting strongly that the 27-nm particle was not an adventitious agent. Some of the heavily coated particles observed following reaction of the stool filtrate with a convalescent serum from the American Samoan and a convalescent serum from the Massachusetts outbreaks are shown in Figs. 20 and 21.",

This virus was later shown to be a parvovirus and to be related to the latent rat virus complex of agents (64) . Although this isolate was most likely a contaminant unrelated to hepatitis A, the possibility of its association with the hepatitis A particle was examined with guinea pig hyperimmune serum to the Kilham strain of latent rat virus and rat virus antigen grown in cell culture. In a reciprocal cross-IE M study done under code, convalescent phase hepatitis A serum from a Joliet volunteer did not react with rat virus antigen but did with its homologous hepatitis A antigen, and the hyperimmune rat virus serum did not react with the hepatitis A antigen but did with its homologous rat virus antigen. Thus, it could be concluded that the hepatitis A antigen was not related to rat virus, and, in addition, the lack of an etiological relationship between rat virus and hepatitis A was confirmed. a After Feinstone et al. (29) . b Antibody to the hepatitis A antigen was detected by immune electron microscopy (IEM) and was rated on a 0-4 scale, depending on the amount of antibody coating the particles. Antibody to the gastroenteritis antigen was determined in the same way. Antibody to hepatitis B antigen was measured by radioimmunoassay (RIA). The first serum of each serum pair listed was obtained prior to exposure, except in the case of four sera that were obtained during the acute phase of illness (acute). The second serum of each pair was obtained approximately 1-6 months after the onset of illness. Sera were tested by I E M at an initial dilution of 1:10 except for sera from patients J,K,L which were tested at approximately 1:10 and sera from patients E and F which were tested at 1:15. Sera were tested by RIA at a dilution of 1:4 or 1:10. We also tested another lot of immune human serum globulin for antibody to the hepatitis A antigen by IEM and found it to contain less antibody ( 2 + ) than the previously studied strongly positive ( 3 -4 + ) lot (see Fig. 19 ). Such tests may prove useful in the potency standardization of immune serum globulin used for the prevention of hepatitis A.",

A convalescent serum known to contain antibody to the hepatitis A particle (29) from a patient with naturally acquired hepatitis A in American Samoa was used in the IEM studies (28) . We studied original, approximately 20% stool extracts that had been shown, after ten-fold dilution and filtration, to be positive for the hepatitis A particle in studies by IEM as previously described (29) . By this method we studied a stool extract derived from a volunteer during the acute phase of illness and found the peak fraction of the 27-nm particle to be at a buoyant density of approximately 1.41 gm/cm 3 in cesium chloride, as shown in Fig. 22 . Figure 23 shows an aggregate of hepatitis A particles observed by IEM at a mean density in cesium chloride of about 1.4 gm/cm 3 (Fraction 4) in a previous isopycnic banding study of a stool extract from another volunteer in which only four consecutive fractions, 3-6, were reexamined in a repeat IEM study, and the peak number of particles was found in Fraction 4. (Details of the initial IEM study are described in the legend of Fig. 23 .) The density of the hepatitis A particle of approximately 1.4 gm/cm 3 is consistent with that of a parvovirus or a rhinovirus but not an enterovirus (37, 41, 44, 74, 79) . Although the antigen has a density similar to a rhinovirus, it can also be excluded from this subgroup of the picornaviruses, since rhinoviruses are acid-labile, whereas an infectious hepatitis A serum has been shown by Provost et al. to be acid-stable in studies in marmosets (37, 44, 70, 74, 79) . Although the nucleic acid content of the hepatitis A particle has not yet been determined, it appears that this agent is parvovirus-like since it not only has a similar buoyant density in cesium chloride but also shares other properties with the parvoviruses such as morphology, and, as shown by Provost et al. in studies in marmosets with an infectious hepatitis A serum, acid, ether, and relative heat stability (41, 70) .",

For Norwalk gastroenteritis and hepatitis A, the technique enabled not only the definitive visualization and identification for the first time of viruslike particles from individuals with these diseases but also enabled us to demonstrate for the first time the serological association of an identifiable viruslike agent with each of these diseases. It is noteworthy that this was accomplished without benefit of any cell culture or animal system. I am certain that this technique will have many other applications, some practical, such as the typing of viruses directly after recovery or isolation, the latter having already been shown by Anderson and Doane (9) to be possible with certain entero viruses. We have also recently been able to type a rhinovirus by IEM by reacting the cell culture isolate with Fig. 23 . An aggregate of hepatitis A particles observed by immune electron microscopy (IEM) at a mean density of about 1.4 gm/cm 3 in cesium chloride. The particles in the diluted fraction (Fraction 4) have been aggregated by a 1:10 dilution of a late convalescent serum from a patient with naturally acquired hepatitis A. Only four consecutive fractions, 3-6, of the gradient from this initial isopycnic banding experiment were reexamined in a repeat IEM study, and the peak fraction of particles was found in serum pools containing antibody to the eighty-nine numbered rhinoviruses plus the subtype (J, 2), followed by individual testing by IEM of the isolate with each serum in the pool that aggregated the virus. However, the most rewarding and exciting use of this technique will be in its application in the quest for the multitude of fastidious agents of human disease that cannot be cultivated or cannot be cultivated effectively in any in vitro or in vivo system.",

            "text": "The elegant results reported by Dr. Kapikian prompt me to report that another technique besides immunoelectron microscopy is now available for this kind of study. Dr. Ralph deBlois and his associates at General Electric, Schenectady, have developed a new method for sizing and counting virus particles-the electrical resistance pulse analysis ( E R P ) . In the ERP technique, virus particles in fluid flowing through a microcylindrical pore (made by General Electric Nucleopore process in a plastic sheet) are detected by the disturbance that they produce in an electrical voltage applied across the pore. Individual virus particles are sized and counted. The technique essentially involves an extension of the existing Coulter counter to particles of virus size. Viruses at concentrations > 1 0 8 / m l can be sized and counted in times of approximately 1 minute. To date the technique has been applied to polyomavirus, T phages, mouse leukemia virus, and mouse mammary tumor virus. Dr. Sam Mayassi and his associates at Charles Pfizer and Co., May wood, have used this technique for sizing and counting virus particles routinely in production of oncornavirus stocks. They have further demonstrated that addition of specific antisera causes formation of aggregates that are detected in the resistance pulse analyzer. Although occasional plugging of the pore by virus-antibody complexes still presents mechanical difficulties, this problem appears solvable. This technique does appear amenable to applications in detection of viruses and virus-antibody complexes. The foregoing results by Dr. deBlois and associates and by Dr. Mayassi and associates were executed under the Molecular Control Program of the National Cancer Institute and will be reported at the spring meeting of the American Association for Cancer Research in Houston.",

KAPIKIAN: We reported in our original gastroenteritis study by immune electron microscopy that it took a median time of approximately 1 hour to examine a specimen in order to assign an antibody rating. It doesn't take us quite as long now. In the hepatitis A studies, such ratings took less time because the hepatitis antigen we used in the original s\u00e9rologie studies contained fewer particles than the Norwalk 8FIIa gastroenteritis antigen and therefore in the presence of specific antibody the hepatitis A particles were more randomly distributed as they occurred more often as antibody-coated single particles. In general, serological studies such as these by immune electron microscopy are quite time consuming; the system you mention would certainly be a great boon to us all if applicable for such serological studies. D R . MELNICK: 1. Two distinct viruses have been passed in marmosets from hepatitis A patients, one by Deinhardt's group and a second by Hilleman's group.

KOCH: Can your method be used to get an estimate on the number of antibody molecules bound to one virus particle? DR. KAPIKIAN: N O . I don't think the technique enables such an estimate to be made. We can get a general idea of the amount of antibody coating a particle and assign a rating to it. Occasionally we see what we think is a bridging antibody molecule between two particles, but because of the limits of resolution of electron microscopy, I don't think we could estimate the number of such small molecules on a virus particle with the technique of immune electron microscopy as we use it.",

Feinstone, Purcell, and I recently collaborated with Dr. D. Madden, who provided paired serum specimens from patients who developed hepatitis during this Lynchburg outbreak, to determine if this hepatitis outbreak was associated serologically with the 27-nm hepatitis A particle. In a study under code of paired sera from each of 2 patients who developed hepatitis during this outbreak, it was found that both patients developed a significant serological response to the hepatitis A particle by immune electron microscopy.

Immunoelectron microscopy offers such a diagnostic aid (not only for smallpox but also for other viral diseases), and I take occasion to emphasize here that the electron microscope is no longer an instrument basic solely to the laboratory engaged in sophisticated or esoteric research, but is one that has now found, and will continue to find, pragmatic applications in the diagnostic public health and clinical virology laboratories.",
