            "text": "T he prognosis of patients with acute myeloid leukemia in whom primary treatment fails remains very poor. In order to improve such patients' outcome, we conducted a phase 2, prospective, multicenter trial to test the feasibility of a new sequential regimen, combining a short course of intensive chemotherapy and a reduced intensity-conditioning regimen, before allogeneic stem-cell transplantation. Twenty-four patients (median age, 47 years) with acute myeloid leukemia in primary treatment failure were included. Cytogenetic risk was poor in 15 patients (62%) and intermediate in nine (38%). The sequential regimen consisted of clofarabine (30 mg/m 2 /day) and cytosine arabinoside (1 g/m 2 /day) for 5 days, followed, after a 3-day rest, by reduced-intensity conditioning and allogeneic stem-cell transplantation combining cyclophosphamide (60 mg/kg), intravenous busulfan (3.2 mg/kg/day) for 2 days and anti-thymocyte globulin (2.5 mg/kg/day) for 2 days. Patients in complete remission at day +120 received prophylactic donor lymphocyte infusion. Eighteen patients (75%) achieved complete remission. With a median follow-up of 24.6 months, the Kaplan-Meier estimate of overall survival was 54% (95% CI: 33-71) at 1 year and 38% (95% CI: 18-46) at 2 years. The Kaplan-Meier estimate of leukemia-free survival was 46% (95% CI: 26-64) at 1 year and 29% (95% CI: 13-48) at 2 years. The cumulative incidence of non-relapse mortality was 8% (95% CI: 1-24) at 1 year and 12% (95% CI: 3-19) at 2 years. Results from this phase 2 prospective multicenter trial endorsed the safety and efficacy of a clofarabine-based sequential reduced-toxicity conditioning regimen, which warrants further investigation.

            "text": "The prognosis of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in primary treatment failure remains very poor. Primary treatment failure or primary refractory AML is defined by failure to achieve a complete hematologic remission (CR) after one or two courses of induction chemotherapy. 1, 2 For these patients, the chance of achieving a CR with another standard or conventional treatment, including the use of intermediate-or high-dose cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C) alone or in combination with an Sequential regimen of clofarabine, cytosine arabinoside and reduced-intensity conditioned transplantation for primary refractory acute myeloid leukemia anthracycline, fludarabine or gemtuzumab-ozogamicin, is 10-20% at best. The overall survival rate at 1 year is less than 20%, with a median survival of less than 6 months. [3] [4] [5] In light of these poor results with conventional chemotherapy, allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) represents a potential therapeutic tool for the treatment of patients with refractory AML. 6 However, standard myeloablative conditioning (MAC), combining cyclophosphamide and either total body irradiation or busulfan, is associated with a very high day +100 overall mortality rate, around 40% 7-10 in refractory AML patients, precluding its use. Reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) regimens allowed a significant reduction of non-relapse mortality (NRM), expanding the transplant option to those patients ineligible for standard MAC allogeneic SCT. The RIC regimen aims to take advantage of the graft-versus-leukemia (GvL) effect mediated by the donor's immunocompetent cells, rather than the upfront cytoreductive effect of the conditioning chemotherapy. 11 However, in refractory AML, RIC may not control the disease sufficiently to allow a GvL effect to occur. In an attempt to overcome this problem, the so-called \"sequential\" transplant approach was developed, which combines a short, intensive course of salvage chemotherapy to decrease the leukemia cell burden with RIC. The results achieved with the sequential FLAMSA strategy (fludarabine, intermediate dose Ara-C, amsacrine followed by 4 Gy total body irradiation, cyclophosphamide and anti-thymocyte globulin) developed by the Munich group are among the most promising published so far. 12, 13 However, the results are still unsatisfactory in terms of relapse incidence and long-term leukemia control, and the high incidence of severe toxicities, related to amsacrine (mainly cardiotoxicity) and total body irradiation hamper the overall safety and success of the procedure.",

Such improvement could be made possible through avoidance of amsacrine and the use of clofarabine and intravenous (i.v.) busulfan in replacement of fludarabine and total body irradiation, respectively. Clofarabine is a nextgeneration purine analog with significant antileukemic activity, particulary in relapsed AML and acute lymphoblastic leukemia. [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] We found that a RIC regimen combining clofarabine, bulsulfan and anti-thymocyte globulin was safe, with a 1-year NRM rate of 6%, and allowed efficient disease control in AML patients in CR. 19 Thus, the use of clofarabine as an alternative to fludarabine in the setting of RIC allogeneic SCT appears to be very attractive. On the other hand, the antileukemic activity of bulsulfan is widely recognized, and the favorable safety profile associated with the use of i.v. bulsufan is well established. [20] [21] [22] We, therefore, conducted a multicenter prospective phase 2 study aiming to assess the efficacy of a sequential regimen combining a short course of intensive chemotherapy based on clofarabine, Ara-C and RIC allogeneic SCT with cyclophosphamide, i.v. busulfan and anti-thymocyte globulin, followed by delayed prophylactic donor lymphocyte infusion (pDLI) in patients with AML in primary treatment failure.",

            "text": "The sequential transplant approach combining a short course of intensive chemotherapy based on clofarabine and Ara-C and a RIC allogeneic SCT, evaluated in the current phase 2 prospective study, has successfully fulfilled its objective to achieve limited toxicity while retaining substantial antileukemia activity. In a heavily pretreated population, having received two induction chemotherapy courses, with a median age of 47 years (range, 20-57) and a Karnofsky score <90% in 46% of patients, we found a 2year NRM rate of 12% and no grade IV non-hematologic adverse events. This favorably compared with standard MAC regimens, 9, 10, 29 but also with the sequential FLAMSA strategy. In the long-term update of the FLAMSA study, Schmidt et al. reported a 2-year NRM incidence of 22.2%, 13 consistent with further reports evaluating the FLAMSA strategy. 30,31 A retrospective study recently reported a 1-year NRM incidence of 24% after allogeneic SCT for AML in primary induction failure, with no significant difference, according to multivariate analysis, in NRM between patients treated with MAC, RIC or FLAM-SA regimens. 32 Thus, our approach avoiding amsacrine and replacing fludarabine and total body irradiation by clofarabine and i.v. bulsufan, respectively, fulfilled its objective to decrease toxicity with a very low incidence of NRM, comparable to that observed after the reduced toxicity regimen based on fludarabine and i.v. busulfan. 33, 34 Decreased toxicity was not achieved at the expense of less antitumor efficacy. Our sequential conditioning regimen approach still exerts an antileukemic effect in patients with AML in primary treatment failure, 75% of whom achieved CR by day 30 after their transplant. This may appear lower than the 88% CR rate achieved by day 30 using the FLAMSA approach; 12 however, the latter study included both patients with refractory and relapsed AML and 21% (16/75) of patients were already in CR before allogeneic SCT in that study. In contrast, in our trial, all patients had primary refractory AML and, therefore, active disease at the time of transplantation. Furthermore, 62% of our patients had unfavorable cytogenetics and 29% had secondary AML. Thus, our sequential approach M. Mohty et al. 188 haematologica | 2017; 102(1) significantly enhanced the antileukemic effect compared to RIC allogeneic SCT, after which only 45% of patients with active AML achieved CR. 35 The 2-year overall survival rate was 38%, similar to the 42% reported by Schmid et al. using the FLAMSA sequential regimen, 12 and superior to the 20-30% reported after standard MAC allogeneic SCT. 8, 10, 29 Similarly, Middeke et. al. reported a 2-year overall survival rate of 43% in relapsed/refractory AML after clofarabine salvage therapy and allogeneic SCT in patients achieving a response. 16 Despite these encouraging results, relapse remains the principal complication, leading to a 2-year leukemia-free survival rate of 29%. We acknowledge that survival curves do not reach a plateau and relapses may continue to occur. However, persistent CR after 2 years in these very highrisk patients is an important achievement since retreatment is possible after late relapse. Of note, a longer interval from transplantation to relapse is associated with an improved survival. 36, 37 Our study was designed to decrease relapse risk in patients achieving CR, with a planned pDLI infusion. However, among 19 patients alive at day +120, only a minority -six patients -received DLI in our study because of early disease relapse/progression or a history of GvHD. Furthermore, among patients treated with DLI, half died from relapse. The use of DLI to enhance the antileukemic effect and decrease relapse in our study was, therefore, a disappointing strategy. In addition, as previously described, 38 we observed a relatively high incidence of GvHD after pDLI. It does, therefore, seem indispensable to develop new strategies to prevent relapse after allogeneic SCT. One way to overcome these difficulties would be to perform earlier pDLI while patients are still under immunosuppressive therapy. Furthermore, Goodyear et al. reported that early administration of the hypomethylating agent azacytidine in AML patients was \u00a9 Ferrata Storti Foundation well tolerated, and was associated with a low incidence of GvHD. 39 This strategy appears promising and a prospective trial evaluating preemptive azacytidine and DLI in high-risk AML patients is ongoing (NCT01541280). Targeted therapy with FLT3-specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors may also be relevant in specific cases. Preliminary data and case reports suggest that FLT3 tyrosine kinase inhibitors can be effective in the post-transplant setting, particularly for patients who have FLT3 internal tandem duplication. 40 We may consider early use of these new therapeutic strategies after allogeneic SCT, alone or in combination with pDLI, in order to enhance the GvL effect in patients with AML in primary induction failure. Our clofarabine-based, sequential reduced-toxicity conditioning approach seems to be the best setting in which to evaluate such therapeutic strategies, in order to minimize the risk of cumulative toxicity. Since this was a phase 2 study, only a limited number of patients were enrolled, precluding the realization of subgroup analyses to evaluate the impact of disease characteristics (cytogenetic, secondary AML\u2026) on patients' outcome. Of note, despite the inclusion and exclusion criteria, we believe that our population is an unselected, representative population of patients with refractory AML as shown by the inclusion of a majority of patients with unfavorable cytogenetics and of patients with proliferative, refractory AML. However, we acknowledge that identifying a suitable donor in a timely manner may be difficult in these patients with very aggressive disease, limiting access to transplantation. Use of haploidentical donors, readily available for nearly all patients, 41 may be promising in this setting.",
