Therefore, HSV sequences upstream of this termination codon were deleted, creating pBCH2a. This plasmid, containing 46 nt of HSV sequence, could direct frameshifting at standard levels ( Figure 1) . A further 5\u0408 deletion of 30 nt yielded plasmid BCH4. The 16 nt of HSV sequence contained within this plasmid was sufficient to promote frameshifting at standard levels. However, a control plasmid, BCH4a, which contained 16 nt of a randomly generated sequence, did not frameshift (Figure 1) . To narrow the minimal signal for frameshifting, we deleted either 3 or 6 nt from the 3\u0408 or 5\u0408 end of the 16 nt HSV sequence, creating plasmids BCH5, BCH7, BCH6, and BCH8, respectively ( Figure 1 ).

The ability of sequences to induce recoding correlates affected by the presence of stimulators. We failed to detect paused ribosomes at the HSV tk recoding site well with their ability to form unusual RNA structures. We discuss below in what way this recoding event differs ( Figure 3B ), suggesting that the HSV frameshift does not involve a kinetically slower second step. Given the from previously described translational frameshifts, possible mechanisms to explain the correlation between low efficiency of the tk frameshift, it could be argued that the pause was too short for us to detect. Nevertheless, if RNA structure and recoding, and the potential relevance of our results to herpesviruses and other biological pausing were important for the tk frameshift, one would expect that stimulators would greatly increase frame-systems.",

Thus, it is difficult to consider slippage on G-strings as a viable explanation ciencies with A-site codons UAG and UGA, intermediate frameshift efficiencies with GGA codons, and lower for our results. Furthermore, although tRNA GLY UCC will form base pairs at frameshift efficiencies with GGG and GAG codons. This was not observed. Instead, only the well-fed A-site co-positions one and three with the \u03e91 codon, GAG in BCH12, the U:G wobble base pair is relatively weak at dons promoted frameshifting, whereas slowly decoded A-site codons did not (e.g., compare BCH18 and codon position 3 while the clashing middle base pair (A:C) in the slipped codon-anticodon complex should BCH21). Thus, the HSV frameshift is not conventional. result in destabilization. Grosjean and co-workers (1978) demonstrated that centrally positioned C:A or A:C pairs abolished synthetic anticodon-codon complexes. Such mismatches decrease frameshifting more than 80-fold in the \u03e91 E. coli RF2 system (Curran, 1993) , compared with the only 3-fold decrease in the HSV tk frameshift (BCH12, Figure 1) . Thus, the ability of BCH12 to frameshift is very difficult to explain by either conventional slippage or by the unconventional mechanism considered above. Taken together, our results argue that tRNA slippage is highly unlikely to account for the HSV recoding event.",
