Methods: A community telephone survey was conducted with 230 Chinese adolescents. Randomdigit dialing of the local residential telephone directory was used to select respondents, who were asked to provide information on their practice of SARS preventive health behaviors and associated factors as specified by the Health Belief Model. These factors included perceived threat of SARS, perceived benefits and barriers in practicing SARS preventive health behaviors, cues to action, knowledge of SARS, and self-efficacy. Hierarchical regression analyses were conducted to determine salient correlates of habitual and volitional health behaviors against SARS. Results: About 54.8% of respondents reported practicing all three recommended habitual health behaviors. Another 47.8% indicated consistent practice of volitional health behavior of facemaskwearing to prevent SARS. Results of hierarchical regression analyses showed that habitual health behaviors against SARS were related to perceived health threat and environmental cues. For facemask-wearing, salient correlates were environmental cues, rates of SARS habitual health behaviors, younger age, and perceived health threat. Conclusions: The Health Belief Model is useful in understanding Chinese adolescents' practice of health behaviors, especially volitional health behaviors.",

Models that include perceived threat as a core component are most useful in understanding the practice of a variety of adolescent preventive health behaviors [11] . Among these models, the present study focuses on the Health Belief Model (HBM). According to the HBM [12] , perceived threat refers to beliefs about the seriousness of a particular disease and one's susceptibility to this disease. The basic HBM also has three other core components, namely perceived benefits, perceived barriers, and cues to action. Perceived benefits refer to the degree to which an individual perceives particular health behaviors as beneficial or effective, whereas perceived barriers are perceived costs of undertaking specific health behaviors. Cues to action are prompts that remind or facilitate an individual to practice certain health behaviors. Two other components, knowledge and self-efficacy, have been added in the more recent modification of the HBM [13] [14] [15] . Self-efficacy refers to beliefs in an individual's own ability to perform the desired health behaviors.",

Similarly, the HBM is also useful in understanding Chinese adolescent health behaviors such as influenza vaccination [19] and HIV preventive behaviors [20] . Across these studies, perceived threat is consistently found to be the most powerful correlate of various health behaviors. The significance of other components varies with different target health behaviors and samples. Furthermore, the HBM is found to be more predictive of volitional health behaviors that are novel and new to the behavioral repertoire of an individual than habitual health behaviors that are usually well established and over-learned [21] [22] [23] .",

They may also perceive preventive health behaviors against SARS as having more benefits than costs, as local health authorities often emphasize their effectiveness and ease to perform [25] . There are abundant environmental cues to remind adolescents to adhere to health advice, and these include posters and notices about SARS preventive behaviors in noticeable areas in schools/public areas as well as disinfection stations with free alcohol towels and liquid soap in major shopping malls. Furthermore, updated information about SARS and effective ways to perform relevant preventive health behaviors are also disseminated through the media, seminars, and public education activities.",

Telephone numbers were randomly selected from the local residential telephone directory for 2002, which covered all listed telephone numbers in all regions of Hong Kong.

When telephones were busy or there was no answer, three follow-up calls on different dates and times were attempted before substituting a new telephone number. Individuals who first answered the phone, who were aged 11 years or above, and who were of Chinese ethnicity were invited to a 20-minute telephone interview on their demographic data, responses to local SARS outbreak, and practice of various SARS preventive health behaviors. The decision was made a priori to recruit until 1500 interviews were completed. Out of 2370 valid household contacts, 795 households refused to participate in the study, 38 were incomplete interviews with more than half of the required information missing, and successful telephone interviews were conducted with 1537 households. The success rate, calculated as percentages of completes to complete plus refusals/incompletes, was 64.4%. The sampling error was 3.1 percentage points. Among 1537 successful telephone interviews in the larger study, 15% (n \u03ed 230) of the respondents were aged 11 to 18 years. The proportion of adolescents to adults in the larger study was comparable to 13.2% in the general population as reported in the 2001 Hong Kong population census.

Among these adolescents (n \u03ed 230), 43.5% were male and 56.5% were female.

Specifically, core HBM components of perceived threat, perceived benefits and barriers, and environmental cues contributed an additional 20.3% of the variance in volitional health behavior of facemask-wearing; whereas these components accounted for only 9.2% of the variance in habitual health behaviors. These findings may be explained by individuals' deliberate evaluation process. Most psychosocial models, including the HBM, suggest that deliberate evaluation of the threat related to the disease as well as benefits, barriers, and cues surrounding specific health behaviors are crucial in predicting whether or not an individual practices a certain health behavior [12, 36, 37] . In this study, consistent facemask-wearing was novel to most Chinese adolescents in Hong Kong and required active evaluation of these psychosocial factors before they decided to practice such behavior. As mentioned, cues to wear facemasks were not only targeted at individual adolescents but were also available in adolescents' social network through their parents and teachers [33] . Thus, core components of the HBM emerged as more salient correlates of facemask-wearing than of habitual health behaviors.",

In other words, Chinese adolescents who practiced habitual health behaviors such as washing hands, taking proper diet with regular exercise, and keeping good indoor ventilation were also more likely to practice the specific volitional health behavior of facemask-wearing. As pointed out by some researchers [38] , different health behaviors may be interrelated to influence health. For example, smoking may reduce the desire to exercise, and intense exercise may affect food intake; whereas eating nutritious food does not necessarily preclude an individual from eating \"junk\" food. Similarly, increases in the practice of one type of health behavior may facilitate adherence to other health behaviors. Further research on the clustering of different health behaviors may facilitate clearer understanding of adolescent health behaviors.",

Consent had to first be obtained from persons who answered the telephone before the conduct of the interview. There was no information about demographic characteristics or reasons for refusal for those who declined the interview. Thus, it remained uncertain whether adolescents' response rate was at the same level as adults. Second, retrospective self-reports of adolescents were collected without external verification, and results might be subject to recall and social desirability bias. There might also be doubts about the validity of responses by telephone interviews. However, previous studies have documented the similarity of responses between telephone and face-to-face interviews [39] , and telephone interviews have become an increasingly acceptable methodology in collecting estimates of health behaviors [40] . Third, the measurement of the target SARS preventive behaviors was crude and without any contextual information. It was possible that adolescents' practice of SARS preventive behaviors might differ at home, in school, or in public places. Lastly, this study focused on core components of the HBM in understanding the practice of SARS preventive health behaviors. Components of other psychosocial models that are of particular relevance to adolescent samples, such as subjective normative beliefs of the Theory of Planned Behavior [36] , were not examined.",
