Following disruption of the intestinal epithelium, wound-associated epithelial (WAE) cells form the initial barrier over the wound. Our goal was to determine the critical factor that promotes WAE cell differentiation. Using an adaptation of our in vitro primary epithelial cell culture system, we found that prostaglandin E2 (PGE 2 ) signaling through one of its receptors, Ptger4, was sufficient to drive a differentiation state morphologically and transcriptionally similar to in vivo WAE cells. WAE cell differentiation was a permanent state and dominant over enterocyte differentiation in plasticity experiments. WAE cell differentiation was triggered by nuclear b-catenin signaling independent of canonical Wnt signaling. Creation of WAE cells via the PGE 2 -Ptger4 pathway was required in vivo, as mice with loss of Ptger4 in the intestinal epithelium did not produce WAE cells and exhibited impaired wound repair. Our results demonstrate a mechanism by which WAE cells are formed by PGE 2 and suggest a process of adaptive cellular reprogramming of the intestinal epithelium that occurs to ensure proper repair to injury.",

This semipermeable cellular barrier functions to reduce exposure to pathogenic and commensal microbes, toxins, and other immunogenic substances (Turner, 2009) . During homeostasis, the epithelial cell barrier is maintained by highly active stem cells residing at the base of the crypts that provide continuous and perpetual cell renewal, with the majority of the differentiated cells being replaced every 3-5 days (Cheng & Leblond, 1974b; Potten et al, 1992; Crosnier et al, 2006; Barker et al, 2007; Noah et al, 2011) . However, in response to injury (i.e. infection, ischemia, toxin exposure), additional mechanisms are rapidly implemented to restore the epithelial barrier. Delay or failure to do so can facilitate exposure to luminal antigens and potentially direct invasion of luminal microorganisms into the host, resulting in a heightened pro-inflammatory response, worsened tissue damage, and systemic infection.",

            "text": "Adaptive cellular responses are triggered by injury or damage to promote the survival and regeneration of a diverse array of mammalian tissues. Two general classes of these responses have been recognized. In one state, a transient class of repair cells is formed that has an atypical differentiation state for that tissue. In a second state, cells lost during damage are directly replaced (Jessen et al, 2015) . The intestinal epithelium appears to employ the first approach in a process termed epithelial restitution (Svanes et al, 1982; Ito et al, 1984; Lacy, 1988) . The critical driver is a transient, specialized repair cell type, which we subsequently termed woundassociated epithelial (WAE) cells (Seno et al, 2009; ). These atypical epithelial cells migrate over the surfaces of intestinal wounds within minutes to hours after injury to re-establish the epithelial barrier. The initial restitution phase of repair does not depend on altered cellular proliferation rates of nearby stem cells (Podolsky, 1999; Dignass, 2001) ; however, a subsequent repair phase requires enhanced proliferation of stem and progenitor cells in the crypts adjacent to the wound to replace crypts lost during severe damage (Seno et al, 2009) .",

This method allows the investigator to study mucosal repair with control over spatial and temporal variables (Becker et al, 2005; Seno et al, 2009; Manieri et al, 2012 Manieri et al, , 2015 Miyoshi et al, 2012; Leoni et al, 2013) . Following biopsy injury, wound surfaces are rapidly covered by WAE cells (Seno et al, 2009) . Multiple lineage tracing models have shown that these WAE cells emanate from crypts adjacent to the wounded area and are replaced by columnar epithelial cells in a subsequent repair phase (Seno et al, 2009; Miyoshi et al, 2012) . With this injury method, we found that mice deficient for prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (Ptgs2), which encodes the inducible prostaglandin synthase family member cyclooxygenase 2, have multiple defects in repair including incomplete covering of biopsy wounds with WAE cells (Manieri et al, 2012 . Prostaglandins likely exert their effects near their site of production due to their chemical and/or metabolic instability (Narumiya et al, 1999; Matsuoka & Narumiya, 2007) . We previously found that Ptgs2-expressing mesenchymal stem cells localize specifically in the colonic wound bed in close association with crypts adjacent to the wound and their associated WAE cells (Manieri et al, 2012) . From these observations, we reasoned that prostaglandins were promising candidate molecules to investigate for capacity to directly induce adaptive cellular reprogramming of the intestinal epithelium and stimulate WAE cell formation during early wound repair.",

Thus, to study the direct effects of prostaglandins on intestinal epithelial cells, we utilized our culture system for primary intestinal epithelial cells ). With this system, primary epithelial cell lines are generated from any region of the gastrointestinal tract and propagated as spheroids enriched for epithelial stem cells in a conditioned media containing Wnt3a, R-spondin 3, and noggin , the critical factors that support intestinal stem cell growth (Sato et al, 2009) . As WAE cells are known to be post-mitotic (Lacy, 1988) , a key advantage of the spheroid culture system is that withdrawal of the conditioned medium promotes exit from the cell cycle and differentiation to mature intestinal epithelial cell types Patel et al, 2013; Moon et al, 2014; Sun et al, 2015; VanDussen et al, 2015) . Here, we use this culture system to show that prostaglandin E2 (PGE 2 ) signals through the EP4 receptor on epithelial stem and/ or progenitor cells to directly induce WAE cells and validate these findings in vivo with our biopsy injury model and a genetic mouse lacking EP4 receptor expression specifically in the intestinal epithelium.",

All four of these receptors were readily detectable in whole organ preparations of lung, small intestine, and colon (Fig 2A) . In contrast, only Ptger1 and Ptger4 mRNAs, but not Ptger2 or Ptger3 mRNAs, were detectable in jejunal spheroid epithelial cells (Fig 2A) . The PGI 2 receptor Ptgir was also undetectable in the spheroids. These data corroborated a previous in situ hybridization study reporting mRNA expression of Ptger1 and Ptger4 throughout the intestinal epithelium (Morimoto et al, 1997) and our own validation of Ptger4 mRNA localization (Appendix Fig S1) . To determine which cellular receptor mediated the effects of PGE 2 on WAE cell formation, spheroids were treated with dmPGE 2 and specific pharmacological inhibitors for EP1 (SC 51322), EP2 (PF 04418948), EP3 (L-798,106), or EP4 (L-161,982). Of these, only EP4 inhibitor (EP4i) blocked the dmPGE 2 -induced WAE formation (Fig 2B-D) . These results support a role for dmPGE 2 signaling through EP4 to promote WAE formation. We next utilized a genetic model of Ptger4 deficiency to confirm the effect of the PGE 2 -EP4 signaling pathway on WAE formation. Spheroid lines were established from the jejunum of the Ptger4 flox/flox mouse (Schneider et al, 2004) and delivered transient recombinant Tat-Cre (Shaw et al, 2008; Morimoto et al, 2010; Patel et al, 2013) to generate heterozygous Ptger4 flox/D and knockout Ptger4 D/D spheroid lines (Fig 2E and F) . Ptger4 D/D spheroids did not make WAE cells by any of the above criteria (Fig 2G-I) .",

We used EP4i-treated cells to eliminate the effects of endogenous PGE 2 present in the culture medium or produced by the spheroid epithelial cells. We observed significant and differential expression of 11,925 probes between the groups of cells. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering showed that dmPGE 2 -treated and EP4i-treated spheroids were more related to each other than to stem cells ( Fig 3B) . The clustering analysis also highlighted six major gene clusters. Detailed analysis of these clusters developed the hypothesis that stimulation or inhibition of PGE 2 signaling directed distinct differentiation states.",

We validated that PGE 2 -and EP4i-treated cells were post-mitotic by assessing proliferation with an EdU incorporation assay (Fig 3E and F) leucine-rich repeat containing G protein-coupled receptor 5 (Lgr5) (Barker et al, 2007) and the proliferation marker antigen identified by monoclonal antibody Ki-67 (Mki67) (Iatropoulos & Williams, 1996) were lower in PGE 2 -and EP4i-treated spheroids than stem cells ( Fig 3H) .

Therefore, we analyzed the genes most highly enriched after EP4i treatment and found many genes known to be highly enriched in enterocytes, including Fabp1, Ace2, and Maoa (Iemhoff & Hulsmann, 1971; Gordon et al, 1985; Sivasubramaniam et al, 2003; Hamming et al, 2004; Narisawa et al, 2007) . We used quantitative PCR to validate the enrichment of these mRNAs in the EP4i-treated spheroids (mouse and human; Figs 5B and EV2) and immunostaining to validate the expression of Ace2 protein ( Fig 5C) in the EP4i-treated spheroids. For mouse colonic spheroids, we validated that EP4i treatment resulted in induction of a colonocyte marker, Car4 (Kaiko et al, 2016; Fig EV2) . Pathway and GO term analysis of the gene cluster specifically associated with EP4i treatment (Cluster 3; 289 probes) showed enrichment for functions associated with mitochondria, including metabolism, TCA cycle, respiratory electron transport, and oxidative phosphorylation pathways (Fig 5D and E) . Ultrastructure analysis of EP4i-treated cells showed that these cells had a columnar shape, basally located nucleus, large cytoplasm with abundant mitochondria, and a well-developed brush border composed of long, densely packed microvilli (Figs 4H and I, and 5F and G). These features were all consistent with enterocytes (Cheng & Leblond, 1974a; Crawley et al, 2014) . We used the Seahorse Bioscience assay to test the differences in oxidative phosphorylation predicted by microarray. We found a higher oxidation consumption rate to extracellular acidification rate (OCR/ECAR) ratio with EP4i-treated cells as compared to stem cells or PGE 2 -treated cells (Fig 5H) , suggesting that EP4itreated cells favor oxidative phosphorylation. This result is consistent with a recent report demonstrating greater OCR/ECAR ratio in differentiating daughter cells compared to Lgr5-positive intestinal stem cells (Fan et al, 2015) . We also assessed secretory cells (endocrine, goblet, and Paneth cells) in the EP4i-treated spheroids and found that these constituted a very small proportion (~5%) of the total cell number ( Fig EV3) . Overall, the transcriptional analysis and its validation suggested that PGE 2 -EP4 signaling regulates a cell fate decision primarily between enterocytes and WAE cells.",

To do this, we first determined the time course of differentiation; mRNA expression levels of WAE cell genes (Dpcr1 and Cd55b) and enterocyte genes (Fabp1 and Ace2) were assessed at 2, 6, 12, and 24 h after starting treatment with differentiation medium containing dmPGE 2 or EP4i. The WAE cell mRNAs were detected by 6 h of treatment ( Fig 6A) . In contrast, enterocyte mRNA induction did not occur until 12-24 h of treatment ( Fig 6B) . These results suggest that WAE cell genes are rapidly and directly induced by EP4 signaling, whereas enterocyte genes are more slowly induced, likely indicative of a transcriptional cascade orchestrating enterocyte differentiation. To test whether expression of these markers was permanent, we treated spheroids with either dmPGE 2 or EP4i for 12 h. We then washed out the media and re-fed with the opposing treatment for an additional 12 h. If spheroids were treated during the second 12-h period with dmPGE 2 , then the WAE cell markers Dpcr1 and Cd55b were expressed, regardless of the treatment during the initial 12 h (Fig 6C) . In contrast, the enterocyte markers Fabp1 and Ace2 were suppressed if spheroids were treated with dmPGE 2 in either phase ( Fig 6D) . These results indicate that PGE 2 is a potent inhibitor of enterocyte differentiation that irreversibly alters epithelial cell fate.",

We found that the enterocyte markers Fabp1 and Ace2 were similarly induced following dmPGE 2 or EP4i treatment in EP4deficient cells (Fig 6F) , suggesting that the enterocyte program is the default differentiation pathway. Moreover, these data further support that, during the response to injury, PGE 2 not only augments the WAE program of differentiation but also suppresses the enterocyte program of differentiation. Of note, EP4 heterozygous spheroids exhibited an intermediate phenotype, with partial induction of both WAE and enterocyte markers (Figs 2 and 6E and F).

EP4 signaling is known to activate adenylate cyclase followed by cAMP formation (Konya et al, 2013) . We confirmed this in our system by treating spheroids with forskolin, an adenylate cyclase activator. This treatment stimulated the WAE cell-associated morphological alterations and induced Cldn4 mRNA in small intestinal spheroids (Fig 7A and B) . The morphologic effects were similar to previous reports using forskolin ( . cAMP is known to activate a multitude of effector proteins. Because of the abundant transcript differences and the altered differentiation states between PGE 2 -and EP4i-treated cells, we reasoned that a transcriptional regulator would be altered downstream of PGE 2 -EP4 signaling. We took a candidate approach based on the literature and focused on glycogen synthase kinase-3b (GSK-3b), as several lines of evidence have indicated that PKA signaling (a target of cAMP) can suppress GSK-3b (Jensen et al, 2007; Hundsrucker et al, 2010; Whiting et al, 2015) . GSK-3b phosphorylates b-catenin and promotes its degradation (Krausova & Korinek, 2014) . Therefore, we determined protein levels of nuclear b-catenin in spheroids cultured as stem cells or cultured in differentiation medium and treated with dmPGE 2 or EP4i (Figs 7C and EV4 ). As expected, significant levels of nuclear b-catenin were detected in",

This is consistent with canonical Wnt signaling in vivo, which is active in intestinal stem cells and inactive in enterocytes (Clevers, 2013; Krausova & Korinek, 2014) . Interestingly, dmPGE 2 -treated spheroids exhibited high levels of nuclear b-catenin that were similar to those in stem cell spheroids. To functionally test whether inhibition of GSK-3b could recapitulate the effects of dmPGE 2 , we treated spheroids with the GSK-3b inhibitor CHIR 99021 in addition to EP4i (to ensure inhibition of endogenous PGE 2 signaling). CHIR 99021 inhibited the degradation of nuclear b-catenin (Figs 7D and EV4). CHIR 99021 also suppressed mRNA expression of the enterocyte marker Fabp1 and induced mRNA expression of the WAE cell marker Cldn4 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig 7E and  F ). Histological analysis of Ptger4 D/D spheroids showed that the accumulation of actin filaments on the apical surface observed in DMSO-treated spheroids was abolished by CHIR 99021 (Fig 7G) . Together, these results indicate that PGE 2 suppresses enterocyte differentiation to promote WAE cell differentiation through maintenance of nuclear b-catenin. We considered that active canonical Wnt signaling could cause nuclear b-catenin localization in WAE cells (Krausova & Korinek, 2014) . As the differentiation medium used to generate WAE cells does not contain Wnt ligands, we tested whether the WAE-enriched spheroids were secreting and responding to Wnts in a cellautonomous manner. Our microarray data highlighted mRNAs encoding several Wnt ligands that were potentially expressed in the PGE 2 -treated cells (Appendix Fig S3) . Due to functional redundancy among Wnt ligands, we chose to block all Wnt secretion with a pharmacological inhibitor of porcupine, an essential enzyme for Wnt lipidation and secretion (Proffitt et al, 2013) . We first determined the effective concentration of porcupine inhibitor using the L-WRN cell line because these cells abundantly secrete Wnt3a . L-WRN cells were cultured in the presence or absence of the porcupine inhibitor C59 to generate conditioned media. These media were applied to 293FT cells expressing the TOP/FOPFlash luciferase reporter system to measure the Wnt signaling activity (Fig 7H) . C59 concentrations from 10 lM to 100 pM potently inhibited Wnt secretion by L-WRN cells.",

These data show that WAE differentiation in the spheroids is not mediated by cellautonomous Wnt signaling. Furthermore, they suggest that a mechanism other than canonical Wnt signaling is driving the accumulation of nuclear b-catenin in WAE cell spheroids.

However, there are many factors that have been proposed to affect intestinal epithelial restitution (Dignass, 2001) and these or others could potentially compensate for loss of PGE 2 -EP4 signaling in vivo. Thus, to test the requirement for EP4mediated signaling to form WAE cells during wound healing, we utilized a colonic biopsy injury model (Seno et al, 2009; Manieri et al, 2012 Manieri et al, , 2015 Miyoshi et al, 2012) . We chose this model because the location and timing of injury and mucosal healing is controlled and well understood (Seno et al, 2009 ). To examine the role of PGE 2 -EP4 signaling in the intestinal epithelium, we bred Ptger4 flox/flox mice (Schneider et al, 2004) with Vil Cre mice (Madison et al, 2002) and generated mice that were deficient for Ptger4 expression specifically in intestinal epithelial cells (Vil Cre Ptger4 flox/flox ). Vil Cre Ptger4 flox/flox and Ptger4 flox/flox littermate controls were biopsy-injured and wound repair was assessed 4 days post-injury, a time at which WAE cells should completely cover the wound surface (Seno et al, 2009) . Although similar numbers of crypts were initially removed during biopsy injury, we consistently observed decreased healing in the Vil Cre Ptger4 flox/flox mice \u25c0 Figure 7 . Nuclear b-catenin signaling without canonical Wnt signaling suppresses enterocyte and promotes wound-associated epithelial cell differentiation. compared to the controls 4 days post-injury by whole-mount microscopy (Fig 8A and B) , suggesting impaired or delayed healing.

The EMBO Journal PGE 2 stimulates reprogramming to promote repair Hiroyuki Miyoshi et al the wound surface in control injured mice (Fig 8D and E) . These wound surface cells also exhibited accumulation of nuclear b-catenin (compared to surface epithelial cells of uninjured regions of colonic tissue), lacked Axin2 and Lgr5 expression, and were non-proliferative, similar to in vitro WAE cells (Fig EV5) . In contrast, a layer of flattened, Cldn4-positive epithelial cells was lacking at the Vil Cre Ptger4 flox/flox wound surfaces (Fig 8D and E) . Instead, Cldn4-positive cells were only located at the edge of the wound and were frequently non-adherent. These data confirm that expression of EP4 in the intestinal epithelium is critical for complete covering of the wound bed with WAE cells and proper epithelial restitution in response to intestinal biopsy injury.",

Subsequent tracing experiments showed that WAE cells emanate from crypt stem cells adjacent to the wound bed . Here, we identified PGE 2 as a potent inductive factor that directly acts on crypt epithelial cells to produce this atypical epithelial cell type. This mechanism appears to be conserved in mouse and human. Primary columnar intestinal epithelial cells cultured with PGE 2 rapidly transitioned to a squamous cell shape and induced WAE cell markers within 2-6 h after treatment. Inhibition of the EP4 receptor in intestinal epithelial cells either pharmacologically or by genetic deficiency abolished these effects and impaired wound healing in vivo.",

            "text": "We showed that WAE cells were post-mitotic and exhibited transcriptional and ultrastructural features consistent with in vivo WAE cells. Our findings agree with early epithelial restitution studies, which also reported the short time frame of this process and indicated a primary dependence on cellular migration that was independent of cellular proliferation (Lacy, 1988; Wilson & Gibson, 1997; Dignass, 2001) . Thus, our work highlights the unique nature of the gastrointestinal wound response and WAE cells in particular. In contrast, skin wound healing requires dedifferentiation of epidermal cells and migration of this proliferative cell type to cover and re-epithelialize wound surfaces (Singer & Clark, 1999; Gurtner et al, 2008) . We found that PGE 2 suppressed the enterocyte differentiation program and redirected differentiating intestinal epithelial cells to the WAE cell lineage. In the intestine, stem cells located at the crypt base continually produce daughter cells that migrate out of the crypt and onto the villus to replenish the intestinal epithelium. Our data suggest that PGE 2 produced in response to injury can direct intestinal stem cells, progenitor cells, and/or immature enterocytes to the WAE lineage. Addition of PGE 2 12 h into the differentiation process could still activate WAE cell differentiation. Thus, the continually renewing intestinal epithelium provides a perpetual source of cells that, when called upon, can rapidly acquire a migratory phenotype and act to Figure 9 . Model of wound-associated epithelial cell formation in response to mucosal injury. In the absence of injury, PGE 2 -EP4 signaling does not reach the signal threshold required for WAE cell formation, and enterocytes differentiate from intestinal epithelial stem cells in accordance with their normal program of differentiation. Upon mucosal injury, Ptgs2-expressing mesenchymal cells become localized to the wound bed in close proximity with the migrating WAE cells. High local production of PGE 2 signals to the EP4 receptor on differentiating intestinal epithelial cells to induce formation of WAE cells, which migrate to cover and seal the wound bed, thereby re-establishing the epithelial barrier. The EMBO Journal PGE 2 stimulates reprogramming to promote repair Hiroyuki Miyoshi et al cover wound surfaces. It is important to note that the presence of WAE cells is transient and typically lasts only a few days (Seno et al, 2009; Miyoshi et al, 2012) . In addition, once epithelial cell commitment to the WAE lineage has been triggered by PGE 2 , enterocyte differentiation is irreversibly blocked. We propose that the quick onset and durability of WAE differentiation is a protective mechanism for the host. Once a wound is sealed by WAE cells, prostaglandins diminish (Manieri et al, 2012) . The WAE cells are then rapidly replaced by newly formed enterocytes during the later phase of repair. Cross talk between mesenchymal cells and epithelial cells is critical for wound repair in the intestine. We have previously reported that intestinal injury results in activation and enrichment of mesenchymal stem cells that express Ptgs2, the rate-limiting enzyme for PGE 2 production, in close proximity to the crypts adjacent to injured regions and migrating WAE cells (Brown et al, 2007; Malvin et al, 2012; Manieri et al, 2012) . Proper activation and positioning of the Ptgs2-expressing cells is dependent both on injury and Myd88 signaling (Brown et al, 2007; Malvin et al, 2012) . Taken together with the current study, we propose the following model for the early repair process (Fig 9) : (i) Mucosal injury results in activation of TLR/Myd88 signaling in the stromal compartment, (ii) TLR/Myd88 signaling activates and enriches for Ptgs2-positive cells at the site of injury to stimulate high local production of PGE 2 , (iii) PGE 2 signals to several local target cell populations, including intestinal epithelial cells, to mediate the repair response, (iv) PGE 2 signals through the EP4 receptor to direct intestinal stem cells, progenitor cells, and likely immature enterocytes to form WAE cells. This mechanism allows the intestinal epithelium to rapidly mount an adequate early repair response and form sufficient numbers of WAE cells without relying on cellular proliferation.",

            "text": "We found accumulation of nuclear b-catenin in WAE cells, and this was functionally important for their formation. In the intestine, Wnt/b-catenin signaling is critical for maintenance of the intestinal epithelial stem cell compartment (Krausova & Korinek, 2014) . Inducible loss of b-catenin in the intestinal epithelium results in rapidly diminished proliferation and differentiation of stem cells (Ireland et al, 2004; Fevr et al, 2007) , whereas forced b-catenin expression results in polyp and tumor formation (Wong et al, 1996 (Wong et al, , 1998 Harada et al, 1999; van Es et al, 2005) . Thus, it is challenging to genetically manipulate b-catenin signaling in vivo or in vitro within a time frame that allows for the study of its role in WAE cells and intestinal wound repair. Instead, we used a GSK-3b inhibitor to treat spheroid epithelial cells deficient in EP4 and showed that the resulting accumulation of nuclear b-catenin was sufficient to suppress enterocyte gene induction and promote WAE cell formation. There is an accumulating body of evidence linking cell adhesive and migratory properties with alterations in b-catenin signaling (Daugherty & Gottardi, 2007; Maher et al, 2009; Amini-Nik et al, 2014) . As WAE cells are migratory and exhibit high levels of nuclear b-catenin, our data provide further support of this literature. However, as canonical Wnt signaling was not active in WAE cells, some factor other than canonical Wnt ligands (e.g. extracellular matrix components) (Bielefeld et al, 2011 ) must be critical for regulating b-catenin in these cells. Further study of the transcriptional mechanisms that regulate WAE cells could yield new insights into the relationship between cell adhesiveness and b-catenin signaling.",

            "text": "EP4 agonist treatment has been shown to provide a beneficial effect in rodent models of colitis (Kabashima et al, 2002; Nitta et al, 2002; Jiang et al, 2007; Okamoto et al, 2012; Watanabe et al, 2015) and in a Phase II trial with ulcerative colitis patients (Nakase et al, 2010) . Accordingly, there is interest in the potential for using EP4 agonists to treat inflammatory bowel disease patients. Although the beneficial effects of EP4 agonists are likely mediated through multiple EP4-expressing cell types, our data suggest that one benefit could be an improved wound repair response of the intestinal epithelium. We found that Ptger4 expression levels were critical for WAE cell formation. Intestinal spheroids heterozygous for Ptger4 exhibited a haploinsufficiency phenotype, with impaired WAE cell formation and skewing toward the enterocyte lineage. These data are intriguing because PTGER4 is the closest gene to one of the most significant susceptibility loci for inflammatory bowel disease (Jostins et al, 2012; Liu et al, 2015) . SNPs within this locus have been proposed to regulate PTGER4 gene expression (Libioulle et al, 2007; Glas et al, 2012) ; however, it is currently unknown how this susceptibility region contributes to disease. PTGS2 (aka COX-2) has also been implicated as a candidate susceptibility gene for inflammatory bowel disease in a recent meta-analysis of patients of European descent (Liu et al, 2015) . Thus, we speculate that genetic variations at these loci could potentially affect PGE 2 -EP4 signaling in human intestinal epithelial cells, leading to inter-individual variation in the ability to form WAE cells and efficiently repair wounds upon mucosal damage.",
