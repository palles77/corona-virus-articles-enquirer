The initial mean percent of predicted FEV 1 was 70.3 (range 38 to 124 and SD 16.2). The mean duration of wheezing was 18.2 years (range 1 to 52 years); 124 (74%) patients were on regular treatment with bronchodilators. Twenty eight percent were current smokers, 42% were ex-smokers and 30% had never smoked. Non-asthmatic controls matched for age, sex, and smoking status were selected from patients attending the same hospital. The criteria for inclusion were no signs and symptoms of acute respiratory illness and normal pulmonary function test with a percent of predicted FEV 1 of 90 or greater (mean 101.6, range 90 -134, and SD 9.2). Informed consent was obtained from all subjects. The mean duration of follow up was 3.2 months (range 2 to 12 months). Culture and PCR Nasopharyngeal swab specimens were obtained from all patients and controls for isolation in cell culture and PCR. The swab specimens were placed in sucrose-phosphate-glutamate (SPG) transport medium. Culture for C. pneu-moniae was performed in cycloheximide-treated HEp-2 cells grown in a 24well cell culture plate as reported previously. 14 All specimens were passed once. Culture confirmation was done by fluorescent-antibody staining with C. pneumoniae species-specific and genus-specific monoclonal antibodies. 14, 15 The C. pneumoniae-specific primers used for PCR were from the DNA base sequence within the 53-kD protein gene as reported previously. 16 Cell culture grown C. pneumoniae strain KKp-15 17 was used as positive controls, and chlamydia transport medium was used as negative controls in every run. After electrophoresis of amplification products on a 1.5% agarose gel at 100 V, the band was visualized by staining with ethidium bromide. The appearance of a 499 base pair amplification product was taken as positive. Serology Paired serum samples were collected at intervals of 4 weeks for controls. Also serum samples of asthma patients were collected several times for at least 4 weeks after onset. All sera were stored at \u03ea70\u00b0C until testing. The microimmunofluorescence (MIF) test was used for titration of IgG, IgA, and IgM antibodies against chlamydial species, 18 using formalinized elementary bodies of C. pneumoniae KK-pn15, C. trachomatis L2/434/Bu and C. psittaci 6BC strains as antigens. Rheumatoid factors were absorbed with Gullsorb (Gull Laboratories, Salt Lake City, USA) before IgA and IgM titrations. 19 Acute or current infection was defined by IgM \u0546 1: 16 ",

In support of IgA antibodies as a marker for chronic infection, microbe-specific serum IgA has been shown to associate with a variety of chronic illnesses by bacterial pathogens, including C. trachomatis. 22 In particular, C. pneumoniae-specific IgA has been associated with C. pneumoniae reinfection, 23 chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, 24 and symptomatic asthma. 25 Our data also showed a significant association of C. pneumoniae-specific serum IgA antibodies and symptomatic reversible airway obstruction in adults. These findings indicate that chronic infection or reinfection with C. pneumoniae is common in asthma patients. Asthma exacerbations in patients with evidence of C. pneumoniae infection occurred in older ages when infection with C. pneumoniae is often a reinfection. It has been proposed that chronic C. trachomatis infection induces immunopathologic disease. 9 Reinfection with C. pneumoniae may therefore trigger an immunopathologic process in the lungs, perhaps involving epithe-lial damage and mediator release, 26, 27 or induce delayed hypersensitivity to chlamydial protein antigens 28 resulting in chronic airway inflammation characteristic of asthma.",

Criteria for definition of IgA levels as indicative of acute versus pre-existing infection have not been established. In this study the positive IgA antibody was therefore, defined as titers \u0546 1:16 by conventional criteria. Complement fixation (CF) tests were done in all patients for antibodies to adenovirus, influenza A and B virus, respiratory syncytial virus, cytomega-lovirus, parainfluenza virus types 1, 2 and 3, and M. pneumoniae. A seroconversion or fourfold rise in antibody was taken as indicating infection. Statistical Analysis Statistical analysis was done by two tailed Fisher's Exact test. Mean age comparison was done by the Student's t test and geometric mean titer (GMT) comparison by the Mann-Whitney U test. A P value \u03fd .05 was considered to be significant.",
