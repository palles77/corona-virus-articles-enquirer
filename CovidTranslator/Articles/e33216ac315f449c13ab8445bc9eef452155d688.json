            "text": "There are six major causes of diarrhea in calves less than 21 days of age: enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC), rotavirus, coronavirus, Cryptosporidium parvum (C parvum) type II, Salmonella enterica (S enterica) subsp. enterica serovars, and nutritional. Regardless of the etiology, calves with diarrhea often have increased coliform bacterial numbers in the small intestine; small intestinal bacterial overgrowth is associated with altered small intestinal function, morphologic damage, and increased susceptibility to bacteremia and endotoxemia. 1-3 The importance of bacterial overgrowth in calf diarrhea has garnered renewed attention with the realization that D-lactic acid plays an important role in the development of acidemia in calves with diarrhea. Production of D-lactic acid results from bacterial fermentation in the gastrointestinal tract and is a common finding in neonatal calves with and without diarrhea. 4-8 D-lactic acid is a major component of acidemia in diarrheic calves 6, 8, 9 and is accompanied by systemic signs of weakness and ataxia. 10 This review focuses on adjunct therapy of diarrhea in the first 3 weeks of life and therefore does not address the efficacy of adjunct treatment for calf diarrhea due to Eimeria bovis, Eimeria zurneii, or Giardia duodenalis. The main principles of ancillary treatment in neonatal calves with diarrhea and systemic illness are: (1) treat or prevent Gram-negative septicemia and bacteremia; (2) decrease the numbers of coliform bacteria in the proximal small intestine and abomasum; (3) increase nonspecific resistance; (4) provide nutrients that facilitate repair of damaged intestine and prevent negative energy balance; and (5) provide analgesia and reduce stress to the calf.",

For calves with diarrhea caused by C parvum, the oral administration of halofuginone or azithromycin appears to be effective in decreasing the duration and severity of diarrhea, as well as in decreasing fecal oocyst concentration and environmental contamination. Theoretically efficacious treatments include the administration of oral rehydration therapy solutions that contain acetate and propionate, and the administration of parenteral B vitamins and fat-soluble vitamins in calves that have chronic diarrhea. There is no evidence to support the efficacy of corticosteroids, motility modifiers, immunostimulants, intestinal ''protectants'' or ''absorbants,'' or probiotic substances in the treatment of calf diarrhea, and the administration of any of these items is not currently recommended.",

            "text": "Although some consider the use of antimicrobials to treat calf diarrhea to be controversial and not indicated, 11, 12 a systematic review of the literature provided strong and unequivocal evidence that specific antimicrobials are efficacious in the treatment of calf diarrhea. 1 The initial concern about antimicrobial use in calf diarrhea was derived from the results of studies that indicated oral administration of penicillin, chloramphenicol, and neomycin increased the incidence of diarrhea in healthy calves, produced malabsorption, or reduced growth rate. 1 More recent concerns about antimicrobial use in calf diarrhea have focused on whether antimicrobial administration promotes antimicrobial resistance of enteric pathogens and facilitates the emergence of multiple resistant strains of Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovars typhimurium and newport. Important considerations when administering antimicrobials as part of the treatment of calves with diarrhea are: (1) administering as directed on the label or by a veterinarian whenever possible; (2) selecting an antimicrobial agent with an appropriate spectrum of activity; (3) using a dosage protocol that attains and maintains an effective therapeutic concentration at the site of infection; (4) treating for an appropriate duration; (5) avoiding adverse local or systemic effects and violative residues; and (6) minimizing the potential for transfer of antimicrobial resistance genes. 13 The overarching philosophy is that veterinarians should use and prescribe antimicrobials conservatively to minimize potential adverse effects on animal or human health. 14 Calves with diarrhea have small intestinal overgrowth with E coli bacteria, regardless of the inciting cause for the diarrhea (Fig. 1 ), 1 and 20%-30% of systemically ill calves with diarrhea have bacteremia, predominantly due to E coli. [15] [16] [17] The frequency of bacteremia is high enough that treatment of calves with diarrhea that are systemically ill (as indicated by decreased appetite and activity or the presence of fever) should include routine treatment against potential bacteremia, with emphasis on treating potential E coli bacteremia. Bacteremia should also be suspected to be present in 100% of calves with clinical signs of Salmonella diarrhea, although the prevalence of bacteremia in calves with salmonellosis does not appear to have been determined. 18 A clinical sepsis score to predict bacteremia 19 does not appear to be sufficiently accurate to guide antimicrobial treatment decisions.",

Parenteral administration of antimicrobials is preferred to oral administration, with the ideal parenteral antimicrobial being bactericidal and predominantly Gram-negative in spectrum. 1 The ideal parenteral antimicrobial should also be excreted in an active form in bile that results in a local antimicrobial effect in the small intestine. 1 Current evidence suggests that antimicrobials should not be administered to diarrheic calves that have a normal appetite, activity level, rectal temperature, and hydration status and the absence of concurrent infections such as pneumonia or omphalophlebitis (Fig. 4) . 23 Instead, these calves should be separated from other calves and their health status monitored frequently.",

Aminoglycosides should not be administered parenterally because of prolonged withdrawal times for slaughter, potential for nephrotoxicity in dehydrated calves, and minimal excretion in bile. 1 The results of a 2002 survey of Italian cattle veterinarians indicated that fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides were the first choice antimicrobials for treating calf diarrhea by 54% and 14% of respondents, respectively. 26 Even though oral and parenteral fluoroquinolones have documented efficacy in treating calves with diarrhea and systemic illness, 1 the extralabel administration of fluoroquinolones in food-producing animals in the United States is prohibited by law because of concerns regarding facilitating the emergence of bacteria with multiple Fig. 3 .

Treated calves also had improved starter ration intakes, a higher body weight gain, and increased activity level than placebo-treated calves. 28 Taken together, these results suggest that meloxicam should be considered as part of the initial treatment of calves with diarrhea and systemic illness in those countries where meloxicam is labeled for use in calves.",

An important effect of flunixin meglumine administration is the clinical impression that calves show improved suckle behavior and general well being after treatment. 3, 36 Calves administered a high dose of ketoprofen (6 mg/kg bodyweight, IV, twice 4 hours apart) tended (P 5 .059) to have reduced fecal output, relative to untreated controls, 37 whereas a lower dose of ketoprofen (3 mg/kg bodyweight, IV, twice 4 hours apart) had no effect. Orally administered aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid, 100 mg/kg bodyweight, once) was not effective in decreasing STa-induced intestinal secretion in calves, whereas intravenously administered sodium salicylate was effective when administered at a dose calculated to maintain a therapeutic serum salicylate concentration of 30 mg/mL. 38 Subsalicylate, a component in bismuth subsalicylate (''Peptobismol'' in the United States) is believed to exert a similar effect to aspirin. Bismuth subsalicylate may therefore decrease intestinal epithelial secretion mediated by cAMP or cGMP in calves with diarrhea, although this has not been verified. There does not appear to be a persuasive reason to prefer bismuth subsalicylate, aspirin, or ketoprofen over meloxicam or flunixin meglumine as an ancillary treatment for calf diarrhea. Until such data is available, bismuth subsalicylate, aspirin, and ketoprofen are not recommended as ancillary treatments for calf diarrhea.",

The results of studies indicate that halofuginone, azithromycin, and possibly lasalocid can be effective in the treatment of cryptosporidial diarrhea in calves. It is currently believed that fresh cow's milk should be fed in small quantities several times daily to optimize digestion and to minimize loss of body weight. Feeding of cow's milk may also be beneficial as a source of dietary lipid, which has been shown to be a potent inhibitor of cryptosporidium-host cell adhesion in vitro. 39 Halofuginone, a quinazoline of unknown mode of action, is licensed in a number of countries in Europe for the prevention and treatment of cryptosporidiosis in newborn calves. Halofuginone (0.06 to 0.12 mg/kg bodyweight by mouth daily) improved the clinical status and decreased fecal oocyst excretion and mortality in a dose-dependent manner in calves with experimentally induced cryptosporidial infection. 40 A toxicity study indicated that 0.5 mg/kg daily by mouth was close to the toxic dose. 41 Halofuginone (5 mg orally daily from approximately day 7 to day 14 of life, equivalent to 0.1 mg/kg bodyweight daily), was efficacious in decreasing oocyst excretion, but had no effect on the prevalence of diarrhea, fecal water percentage, or the severity of dehydration in naturally infected calves in Quebec, compared with untreated controls. 42 In contrast, the results of a large 2007 study in the Czech Republic indicated that halofuginone (0.1 mg/kg bodyweight daily for 7 days, orally) decreased the intensity of diarrhea and the fecal oocyst count, when started on day 1 or day 8 of life. 43 The preponderance of evidence indicates that halofuginone (0.1 mg/kg bodyweight daily orally) is an effective treatment for cryptosporidial diarrhea in calves.",

Because many Gram-negative bacteria attach to the intestinal epithelium via receptors that have a similar structure to oligosaccharides, milk oligosaccharides may provide competitive binding sites for the K99 (F5) fimbrae from enterotoxigenic E coli. 56 Bacteria bound to oligosaccharides move along the intestine with intestinal peristalsis and are eliminated in the feces because oligosaccharides are not enzymatically digested in the small intestine. 57 The administration of exogenous oligosaccharides in water to neonatal calves decreased intestinal E coli counts in the small intestine of calves inoculated with ETEC. 56 Prophylactic addition of exogenous oligosaccharides to milk replacer resulted in fecal scores (scours) in calves which were similar to those observed when calves were fed milk replacer containing antibiotics. [57] [58] [59] It must be noted that data on morbidity and mortality were either low or remained undetermined in these studies, 58 and that scours may well have had nutritional rather than an infectious origin. 57 Oligosaccharides show promise as a non-antimicrobial method for preventing ETEC or treating ETEC diarrhea in calves.

At abomasal pH of 3.0 to 3.7, < 10% of the inoculum dose was recovered, with ETEC strains being more resistant to pH-mediated killing than colisepticemic strains. At abomasal luminal pH of 5.0, both ETEC and colisepticemic strains proliferated. 76 Taken together, these studies suggest that E coli is killed when pH % 3.0 and multiplies when pH R 5.0.",

The pH of intestinal contents from milk fed calves suckling cow's milk at time 5 0 hours. Note that the pH fluctuates with milk feeding in the abomasum and anterior small intestine but is more stable in the distal half of the small intestine. Note also that luminal pH becomes increasingly alkaline moving aborad from duodenum toward the ileum. (Reprinted from Mylrea PJ. Gastro-intestinal disorders and the functioning of the digestive tract of young calves. Res Vet Sci 1968;9:14-28; with permission.) and because STa toxin is a much more potent secretagogue in the proximal small intestine. Although STa receptor affinity and density are greatest in the ileum and distal jejunum of the neonatal calf, 84 in studies using ligated intestinal segments of Jersey calves aged 3 to 7 days and Holstein calves aged 1 day inoculated with ETEC, a much larger secretory volume was obtained from segments in the proximal small intestine, with the terminal jejunum and ileum producing very little volume following inoculation. 34, 35 The mean volumes secreted in the small intestine following ETEC inoculation were as follows (with the intestine divided into six equal parts, from orad to aborad): 36, 24, 30, 13, 10, 0 mL. 34 Colonization of the proximal intestine is therefore the critical determinant of the severity of dehydration following infection with ETEC because colonization of the ileum and distal jejunum with ETEC has minimal effect on hydration status as STa is an ineffective secretagogue in this section of the intestinal tract. In summary, decreasing luminal pH in the proximal small intestine will increase nonspecific resistance to ETEC by preventing adherence to epithelial cells by K99 pili and preventing secretion of STa enterotoxin. This observation suggests that feeding ORT solution or water of acidic pH will be beneficial in treating and preventing calf diarrhea. Moreover, alkalinization induced by bicarbonate-containing ORT solutions potentially facilitates growth of ETEC bacteria, expression of K99 pili, and production of STa enterotoxin in the small intestine.",
