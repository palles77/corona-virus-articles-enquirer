Currently, treatments for hyperbilirubimia (2) , T-cell lymphoma (3) , and even graftversus-host disease (GvHD) (4, 5) involving extracorporeal photopheresis are well established. Within the last decade, new technologies have been developed and implemented which employ light, often in the presence of a photosensitizer, to inactivate pathogens that reside in human blood products for the purpose of transfusion. While blood donor screening and nucleic acid testing (NAT) for various pathogens have been implemented to reduce the risk of transfusion transmitted diseases, there is still residual risk to blood safety. With regard to emerging pathogens in regions previously not endemic to such infections, such as the Dengue (6) virus and parasites such as Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease (7) , pathogen reduction is particularly valuable. Unknown or previously unidentified pathogens such as SARS (8) and West Nile Virus can also emerge into the blood supply with little advance warning (9) . Blood banks and health organizations must react quickly to these scenarios to identify the agent, form a strategy for prevention of contamina-tion of the blood supply, and develop new screening tests, if necessary. Second, while testing methodologies continue to become more sensitive, there will always be a period of time during which the pathogen is undetectable (a \"window period\") and testing procedures will be limited by test sensitivity. Furthermore, blood safety is also threatened by residual white blood cells that exist even after leukoreduction techniques are employed. In contrast, implementation of pathogen reduction technologies (PRT) enables blood providers to take a proactive approach to blood safety by inactivating pathogens that might exist in blood products and thereby prevent infection of the recipient.",

The diversity of infectious agents requires any technique or technology to have a broad spectrum of activity, such that it will be effective against enveloped and nonenveloped viruses, Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria (including spore-forming agents), parasites and white blood cells. As these techniques have in common that they require a chemical reaction on a biological product, it is not surprising that all current techniques have been shown to cause various degrees of cellular and protein damage as well as some degree of toxicity in the treated products (10) . The majority of PRT are designed to target nucleic acids of pathogens to disrupt their functionality because platelets, plasma and red blood cells do not require genomic DNA to be viable. However, beyond the targeted damage to a pathogen's genetic material, secondary damage can also be incurred by proteins and membrane molecules, potentially leading to a degradation of blood product quality. This was most obvious in the example of Inactine/PEN110 developed by Vivex. Inactine/PEN110 was a low molecular weight reduction compound that covalently linked to nucleic acids and worked to reduce the pathogen load in the presence of red blood cells. However, it also had the unintended consequence of causing immune modulation in the form of neoantigenicity; new antibodies against the PEN110 compound were formed, and antibodies already present in the individual also targeted the PEN110 compound (11) . Thus, finding the balance between sufficient pathogen reduction and acceptable product quality is critical.",

After activation of the photosensitizer, two types of reactions are known to occur. In the absence of oxygen, Type I reactions take place; these involve direct electron transfer between the photosensitizer and the target (in this case DNA). These reactions typically result in the formation of ion radicals, which can then propagate in further chemical reactions, ultimately resulting in reduction of the pathogen load. In the presence of oxygen, Type II reactions can occur; here they lead to the formation of singlet oxygen species, which are highly activated and can react with DNA molecules, also resulting in reduction of the pathogen load (12) . The type of photosensitizing molecule dictates the wavelengths of light energy required to promote photochemical reactions.",

In the presence of oxygen, reactive oxygen species are generated. In an oxygen-depleted environment, direct electron transfer is likely to be responsible for phosphodiester bond cleavage resulting in strand breakage at guanine-residues. In the presence of visible wavelengths of light (MB has a peak absorption at 620-670 nm), both type I (redox) and type II (photo-oxidative) reactions can occur (27) . However, it is thought that the type II photodynamic reaction is primarily responsible for the pathogen reduction reactions that occur (28) . Excitation of MB can also lead to its reduction to leukomethylene blue or to its demethylation to azure A, azure B, and thionine. The result of MB activation can lead to predominantly guanosine oxidation via a type II pathway. These changes in DNA ultimately prevent the replication of pathogens (Fig. 1) .",

Prior to illumination, the plasma product is passed through a 0.65 lm filter (Plasmaflex PLAS4 from Macopharma) to reduce the levels of residual white blood cells, red blood cells, platelets, some aggregates, and intra-cellular viruses and to reduce the levels of microparticles). Once the illumination is complete the process requires removal of MB using the Blueflex MB removal filter from Macopharma to ultimately reduce the residual MB concentration down to 0.1-0.3 lM (28).",

            "text": "With respect to blood safety, MB is limited in its applicability in that it is only effective as a pathogen reducing agent in plasma. MB is a phenothiazine derivative and consequently, it has a high affinity for both nucleic acids and as well as the surface structure of viruses. Further, MB is also known to bind to viral core proteins (27) . Importantly, bacteria and hemoglobin can reduce MB to leuko-MB, which functions neither as not a photosensitizer nor as a DNA intercalator, which reduces the overall effectiveness of MB against bacteria and intracellular pathogens (27) . In addition, because of the hydrophilic character and positive charge of MB, it cannot penetrate the cell membrane and therefore, it is inefficient for inactivation of intracellular pathogens. Rather, MB remains localized to the external membrane proteins and lipids resulting in cellular damage with photoactivation. This is the underlying reason why MB can only be used for treatment of plasma, and not for treatment of platelet or red cell products (30, 31) . Theraflex claims efficient virus reduction for Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), Hepatitis B Virus (HBV), Hepatitis C Virus (HCV), Cytomegalovirus (CMV), West Nile Virus (WNV), Parvovirus B19 and others, but is less effective against the picornavirus family, including Hepatitis A Virus (HAV), Poliovirus, and encephalomyocarditis virus, though it is known that this family of viruses is highly resistant to physiochemical treatment (32) . It is also effective against the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi. Historically, MB has been shown to be more effective against Gram-positive than Gram-negative bacteria (27) . Treated plasma should not be used for patients with known allergies against MB or photoproducts. It also cannot be used in patients with a known Glucose-6 phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (33) and may cause hemolytic anemia in these patients.",

PUVA therapy generally refers to the use of the psoralen 8-methoxypsoralen (8-MOP) and is the predecessor to the commercially used PRT psoralen, amotosalen (S-59) from Cerus, Inc. Amotosalen is a tricyclic molecule consisting of a furan and a pyrone moiety. However amotosalen has been designed to be more water soluble through the addition of an amine side chain and consequently is less lipophilic than 8-MOP (38) . Hundreds of psoralens, both natural as synthetic, were evaluated for their chemical and biological characteristics. Amotosalen was selected for development based on its activity against a variety of viruses and bacteria while maintaining the functional properties of platelets and plasma (38, 39) .",

As they are small planar, heterocyclic aromatic molecules, psoralens have a high propensity to intercalate reversibly within the double helical structure of nucleic acids. The latter is specifically true for amotosalen as it carries a cationic charge under physiological conditions which increases its affinity for DNA (as DNA molecules are negatively charged). After UVA activation, covalent cross-links are formed to pyrimidines in both RNA and DNA using sequential [2 + 2] cycloaddition reactions (these types of reactions can only occur in the presence of light of the correct wavelength) (40) . First, photoactivated amotosalen forms a covalent adduct with either thymidine or adenine to form single adducts that force helical unwinding of the nucleic acid molecule. After unwinding of the DNA, a second adduct can be formed in the presence of UVA which forms a crosslink with the original adduct. In RNA, a second adduct can be formed to yield intrastrand crosslinks. The crosslinks prevent helical unwinding and replication of the nucleic acids by polymerases (27) . The numerous monoadducts and crosslinks prevent replication and ultimately are responsible for the ability of amotosalen to inactivate pathogens upon activation with UVA (Fig. 1) . Because of its water soluble properties derived from the addition of titratable amine side chains, amotosalen can penetrate cell membranes thus allowing them to act upon intracellular nucleic acids of numerous pathogens. This allows the Intercept technology to be used to treat plasma and platelet products, but not with red cells as hemoglobin absorbs UVA and prevents activation of psoralen.",

The CAD consists of spherical beads enclosed in a polyester mesh pouch within a plastic container (41) .

This makes it a simple process from a pharmacological standpoint, as the process only uses UVC (254 nm) as the pathogen inactivating source. However, due to the short wavelength of light that is attributed to UVC, it is most effective in a medium that is relatively transparent. Consequently its reactivity is quenched in more turbid or protein-containing solutions, and thus it can only be used to inactivate apheresis and buffy coat platelet products in Platelet Additive Solution; Macopharma specifically directs the use of SSP+. As with all technologies, agitation of the product during illumination is essential to ensure that blood products are homogeneously exposed to light. UVC acts directly on nucleic acids ([2 + 2] cycloaddition mechanism) by generating \"thymine dimers,\" or more specifically, cyclobutane pyrimidine and pyrimidine-pyrimidone dimers that ultimately prevents DNA polymerase from proceeding during transcription (60) . It has been demonstrated that treatment with a wavelength of 254 nm and an energy dose of 0.2 J cm \u00c02 results in an effective level of virus, bacteria and parasite reduction, while maintaining an acceptable level of platelet cell quality (61) . As no photosensitive compound has been added to the blood products, no filtration is required after treatment with the Theraflex system (Fig. 1) . The THERAFLEX UV-Platelets system is currently under clinical evaluation and is not available for routine use.",

Bound to the acridine-based intercalating structure is a flexible labile ester linker that connects to a bis-alkylator group, which is the entity that reacts with nucleotide bases in DNA and RNA and creates cross-links (70) . The ester hydrolyzes at neutral pH to result in non-reactive breakdown products, including an acridine-based product termed S-300 (70) . Initial usage of S-303 as an agent in PRT resulted in antibody formation to the acridine moiety (71) . Addition of glutathione as a quencher in a second generation process resolved the antibody formation issue and FRALE is now in Phase III clinical trials.",

While the FRALE pathogen inactivation process occurs within 30 min, the S-303 must decompose over 6-19 h to the nonreactive byproduct S-300. At the end of storage of the average concentration of S-300 remaining in the product is approximately 40 lM. After centrifugation, removal of the supernatant, and resuspension in additive solution (SAG-M), the RCCs are stored refrigerated for up to 35 days (71) . Because undetectable levels of S-303 remain after decomposition and washing, toxicology studies on the parent compound have neither been required by regulatory agencies nor performed; toxicology studies have only been carried out with the degradation product, S-300. However, because S-303 is a nucleic acid alkylating agent, the parent compound would be expected to be genotoxic. Nevertheless, no adverse effects were observed when five times the standard dose was used to prepare RBCs that were subsequently transfused into rat and dog models (70) .",

Products that are more hydrophobic have the ability to perform intracellularly, expanding their effectiveness in blood products. Nevertheless, all PRT techniques have difficulty inactivating spore-forming bacteria such as Bacillus cereus, regardless of the chemistry utilized. The various chemistries not only impact which pathogens they can inactivate and how, but also how they affect the plasma and cellular proteins and to what degree. These mechanisms result in varying protein quality for plasma products, cell quality for platelet products, and potentially the immunomodulatory effects briefly described here.",

The ever-present threat of emerging and reemerging infectious diseases as well as the risk of clinical conditions related to the transfusion of blood products drives the need for innovation of new technologies in the field of blood banking and transfusion medicine, hence the development of PRT. The numerous technologies and mechanisms discussed in this paper reflect the complexity of finding a balance between effective pathogen inactivation in blood products and maintaining acceptable quality and functionality of the hemostatic components. Development and refinement of these techniques is ongoing, with the goal of creating a safer global blood supply. While the primary indication of these treatments is pathogen reduction in transfusable blood components, other applications for use of PRTs are being explored. The scope of investigational studies includes the fields of vaccine development, oncology, biofilms, lypholization, veterinary medicine, and agricultural applications. This work is in the earliest stages of exploration, but it seems clear that the full potential of these technologies has yet to be determined. The global impact PRT may have on healthcare and science will be realized in the decades to come.",
