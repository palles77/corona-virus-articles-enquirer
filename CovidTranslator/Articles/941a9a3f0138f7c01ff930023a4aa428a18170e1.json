For the shotgun sequence, the researchers extracted DNA from worms, randomly cut it into short pieces, sequenced them, and then assembled overlapping sequences to create thousands of stretches of contiguous DNA sequence. To help fill in the gaps between these \"contigs,'' Stein and colleagues developed a \"fingerprint'' map of the genome as a guide for aligning the shorter fragments. The map also helped them identify inconsistencies and misalignments in the genome assembly. Finally, they integrated the previously finished sequence to improve the draft genome sequence. Using these massive datasets, the authors produced a high-quality genome sequence; although it does not quite meet the gold standard of a \"finished'' sequence, it covers 98% of the genome and has an accuracy of 99.98%.",

The worms' genomes, it seems, are evolving faster than their mammalian counterparts, based on the change in the size of the protein families (C. elegans has more chemosensory proteins than C. briggsae, for example), the rate of chromosomal rearrangements, and the rate at which silent mutations (DNA changes with no functional effect) accumulate in the genome.

Most research aimed at recovering motor function has focused on repairing damaged nerve fibers, which has succeeded in restoring limited movement in animal experiments. But regenerating nerves and restoring complex motor behavior in humans are far more difficult, prompting researchers to explore alternatives to spinal cord rehabilitation. One promising approach involves circumventing neuronal damage by establishing connections between healthy areas of the brain and virtual devices, called brain-machine interfaces (BMIs), programmed to transform neural impulses into signals that can control a robotic device. While experiments have shown that animals using these artificial actuators can learn to adjust their brain activity to move robot arms, many issues remain unresolved, including what type of brain signal would provide the most appropriate inputs to program these machines.",

It seems like a simple task-you raise that glass reflexively, whether it is empty or full-yet the neural calculations that determine the force needed to lift your arm smoothly to your lips in each case are anything but simple. The brain, it seems, operates like a computer to process variable cues-such as the weight of a glass and the position of your arm-to generate an appropriate response: lifting the glass. Neuroscientists believe the brain builds a kind of internal software program based on past experience to transform such variable cues into motor commands. The brain's software, or internal model, depends on specialized sets of instructions, or \"computational elements,'' in the brain.

In the visual system, for example, retinal ganglion cells send axons in an ordered manner into the brain, where they form connections with neurons of the primary visual center in the brain responsible for detecting visual targets. The arrangement of these connections mirrors the neighboring relationships of the neurons in the retina, and so the neural map of connections in the brain is an \"anatomical correlate'' of the arrangements in the retina. The origin of these anatomical relationships can be traced through the process of development, allowing scientists to link the assembly of this sensory system with the function of the neurons involved. Matthias Landgraf and colleagues now report that in the fruitfly Drosophila the arrangement of motor neurons corresponds to the distribution of their target muscles. Thus, anatomical correlates also exist in the motor system, in the form of a \"myotopic map,'' where the arrangement of motor neuron dendritic branches in the central nervous system reflects the distribution of their target body wall muscles in the periphery.",

Surprisingly, the arrangement of the dendrites in the myotopic map forms independently of the muscles they innervate. It may be, the researchers suggest, that the initial signals charting the location of the dendrites are set very early in development, when the coordinates for other structural elements are established.

In this way, the brain can rely on past experience of one kind of sensory cues to predict how to respond to new but similar situations. While previous studies had established that some visual cues are combined through a gain field, this study shows that motor commands may also be processed via gain fields. This finding, the researchers demonstrate, accounts for a range of behaviors. Based on previous studies showing that when people reach to various directions in a small space, they can extrapolate what they learn about the forces in one starting position to a significantly different position, it has been proposed that the way the brain computes movement is not terribly sensitive to limb position. Citing other research with seemingly contrary conclusions-that the brain can be highly sensitive to limb position in calculating force and movement-Hwang et al. set out to investigate whether-and how-the brain creates a template to translate sensory variables (limb position and velocity) into motor commands (force). They created a computer model to mimic the reaching behaviors observed by people in their experiments and found that the most accurate model used computational elements that are indeed sensitive to both limb position and velocity. If the brain processes these two independent variables through a gain field, it can use the relationship of the two variables-that is, the strength of the gain field-to adapt information about the force needed to move or lift something in one situation to accomplish a wide range of similar movements. When the researchers compared their model to previously published results, they found their model accounted for seemingly disparate findings. They explain that the brain's sensitivity to limb position can be either low or high after a task has been learned because the gain field itself is adjustable.",

This organization, in the form of the myotopic map, may be mirrored by the patterning of processes of higher-order neurons, which form connections with the motor neuron dendrites themselves. In vertebrates, studies have shown that motor neurons are grouped into \"pools'' and \"columns'' that correlate with the muscles they innervate. But because these pools and columns represent the location of the cell bodies and not the areas of the spinal cord where the neurons receive most of their inputs, that is, their dendritic branches, scientists could not say whether the pools and columns are simply spandrels-an incidental result of the way motor neurons are generated-or mirror a functional organization of the motor system. This novel fi nding in Drosophila will pave the way for future studies on the relationship between anatomy and physiology during development. It will be particularly interesting to discover whether such myotopic arrangements of motor neuron dendrites are unique to insects or whether this organizational principle occurs in other motor systems, including vertebrates. Of all the tasks a cell must accomplish day in and day out, protecting its genome may be the most important. Genomes confront all manner of potential assaults, from the strand-splitting action of gamma-radiation to the simple copying mistakes sometimes made when DNA replicates before a cell divides. Though some mutations are harmless, others can disrupt gene action, leading to cancer and other diseases. To guard against such events, healthy cells maintain quality-control \"checkpoints'' that sense and respond to DNA injuries, as well as to defects in DNA replication, and that prevent cell division until the DNA can be repaired.

As the double-stranded DNA molecule unwinds, different protein complexes step in to ensure that each strand is faithfully reproduced. Two protein complexes required for this process are replication factor C (RFC) and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). In the 1980s, Stillman's laboratory isolated PCNA and RFC and showed that they function together to \"load'' PCNA onto a structure in DNA that is created after DNA synthesis begins. PCNA forms a clamp around the DNA strand and regulates the DNA polymerases that duplicate the DNA double helix. Studies in yeast had identifi ed a series of proteins required for the DNA synthesis phase of the cell cycle and the DNA damage checkpoint pathways; mutations in these proteins' genes make cells very sensitive to radiation (hence the name Rad genes). A subset of these proteins, which are conserved in human cells, form two protein complexes-RSR and RHR-that function like RFC and PCNA, respectively, with RSR loading the RHR clamp onto DNA. Ellison and Stillman demonstrate that both pairs of \"clamp-loading'' complexes follow similar biochemical steps, but, signifi cantly, RFC and RSR favor different DNA structures for clamp loading. While it was known that the RSR/RHR complexes exist in human cells, it had not been established that the two types of clamps prefer different DNA targets. The researchers also show that the RSR/RHR biochemistry depends on RPA, a protein known to be involved in the DNA damage-response pathway.",

The researchers propose that the role of this checkpoint machinery is not as an initial sensor of DNA damage, but rather as a facilitator of DNA repair, stepping in after preliminary repairs to DNA lesions have been made.

The progression from a single cell to a thousand-, million-, or trillion-celled animal follows an exacting schedule and plan involving an elaborate network of genes and proteins. One of the primary mechanisms coordinating this process is cell-to-cell communication. Cellular signaling regulates two crucial development mechanisms, apoptosis (programmed cell death) and cell proliferation, which work like chisel and clay to sculpt multiplying masses of cells into, say, a fly wing or a human finger. Controlled by multiple signals operating at fixed intervals, the entwined pathways can be steered off-course by a single defect in the communication network, resulting in the death of a healthy cell, for example, or the survival of a damaged cell.

One class of lymphocytes, called T cells, develops in the thymus, where every T cell acquires a one-of-a-kind receptor, called a T cell receptor (TCR), designed to recognize a different antigen. When an antigen gets bound by a TCR (a bound molecule is called a ligand), the antigen triggers a signaling cascade that tells the T cell either to attack the infected cell or to alert other immune cells of the infiltrator. But as Jeroen Roose, Arthur Weiss, and colleagues report, signaling pathways activated by bound TCRs appear to influence gene expression even in the absence of antigen or other receptor ligands, a process called ligand-independent signaling. These findings lend support to the notion that cellular signaling pathways regulated by surface receptors, like TCRs, exhibit a continuous low-level signaling (known as basal signaling) in the absence of a stimulus and that this continuous signaling, by influencing gene expression, has significant influence on cellular differentiation.",

RAG genes regulate the genetic recombination and ultimate cell surface expression of TCRs. Using chemical inhibitors and mutant human T cell lines deficient in critical signaling components involved in antigen receptor-dependent pathways, the researchers found that the loss of specific functions or specific proteins affected an unexpected set of target genes. Notably, when downstream components (the protein kinases Erk and Abl) were disabled in the basal signaling pathway, the researchers saw a resurgence of RAG gene expression. While Erk was already known to play a prominent role in signaling pathways downstream of the TCR, it now appears that Abl may also be regulated in TCR pathways. Most importantly, these findings suggest that signaling pathways thought to be triggered only by ligated receptors can influence gene expression on their own. And it may be through this type of signaling that TCR pathways help regulate T cell development by repressing RAG gene activity.",

The ontology relating the expressions and categories to one another is based both on scientific and common sense as well as linguistic components. In less than two years of work, Mueller and his team have already marked up 3.9 million terms in 16,000 abstracts and 2,000 full-text papers.
