We confirm that susceptibility to MHV-4 is not linked to the H-2 complex, and that all strains susceptible to acute EAE have both a responder H-2 haplotype (H-2 S or H-2 d) and induced (B. pertussis) VAAS. In addition, we provide evidence that susceptibility to acute EAE induction is controlled by an additional presently unmapped locus and that an EAE-like histopathological disease does not usually follow MHV-4 infection intracerebrally in animals susceptible to MHV-4, acute EAE and induced VAAS.",

RI strains are derived by systematic inbreeding of progenitors differing at identifiable loci, providing a set of strains containing a fixed recombination of linked alleles characteristic of either progenitor strain (Bailey 1971; Taylor 1981) . The more gene loci mapped the more useful the RI strains become in detecting linkage. Once the strain distribution pattern (SDP) is established for a large enough set of markers, the SDP of any new one can be compared to establish linkage.

For a trait that differentiates the progenitor strains, one or the other progenitor phenotypes will be recovered in association with each derived RI strain if it is controlled by a single locus. The appearance of novel phenotypes indicates a more complex pattern of inheritance. The probability of control by one or more loci may be calculated from the distribution of responses amongst the RI strains tested (Taylor 1976; Bailey 1981) . The difference between B A L B / c and S J L / J for susceptibility to M H V -4 (Table 2) is (Table 3) , marginally compatible with two ( P = 0.1) and incompatible with three ( P = 0.02). This gene is unlinked to the other markers analyzed here, i.e., EAE and VAAS, and unlinked to other markers established in the (CXJ) RI strains on chromosomes 1, 5, 12, 16 and 17 (data not shown). Recent work maps this gene to the proximal end of murine chromosome 7 where it is linked to the Sop-2 locus (Knobler et al., in press ). Control of resistance to acute MHV infection by a single recessive gene has also been reported for MHV-2 (Weiser et al. 1976 ) and MHV-3 (Levy-Leblond et al. 1979) . Our results indicating a single gene controlling MHV-4 differ, however, from a proposed two-gene model (Stohlman and Frelinger 1978) . The cause for these differences is not apparent.",

We will discuss the difference between B A L B / c and S J L / J for susceptibility to EAE in terms of one gene locus; to histamine, two-gene loci; and to B. pertussis enhancement, three loci. Sensitivity to acute EAE had previously been demonstrated to be inherited in a dominant fashion and dependent upon a background of both an H-2 responder haplotype and sensitivity to histamine inherited in a recessive fashion or dominantly inherited responsiveness to B. pertussis enhancement of histamine sensitivity (Linthicum and Frelinger 1982) . In the present report, these relevant background genes were present in all 9 (CXJ) strains, which thus unmasked the newly found locus. The distribution of sensitives and resistants based .upon a single gene difference would predict a ratio of sensitives to resistants of 1.0. Five sensitives and 4 resistants were found, giving a ratio of 1.25, which is compatible with a single gene difference. Possibly this EAE locus is an IR-gene present in the non-H-2-1inked background which controls responsiveness to myelin basic protein (MBP) or another encephalitogenic component of the inoculum used to induce acute EAE. Alternatively, this locus controls a suppressor response to the relevant antigen(s). These hypotheses may be tested by determining immune-responsiveness to MBP or other components in the (CXJ) RI strains to determine if they have a correlation with sensitivity to EAE induction.",

It has been suggested that a prior viral encounter may lead to development of an EAE-like response in man (Maugh 1977) . Recent evidence demonstrates cellular sensitization to MBP may follow acute measles infection in man (Johnson et al. 1984) or MHV-4 infection in rats (Watanabe et al. H o = histamine destroying activity; Hg= histamine receptor; E= enhancing effect of histaminesensitizing factor from B. pertussis; hi = high activity; Io = low activity; R = resistance, while S sensitivity, both relative to the quantity of histamine challenge. 1983), where clinical disease is associated with central nervous system perivascular infiltration of mononuclear cells. In the present study, 4 RI strains (CXJ-4, -6, -8 and -11) sensitive to both acute MHV-4 encephalomyelitis and acute EAE did not develop perivascular infiltration of mononuclear cells following MHV-4 infection i.c., possibly because death from necrotizing encephalomyelitis occurred prior to the time for such lesions to develop. However, these same strains did not develop perivascular infiltration of mononuclear cells following ts8 infection i.c., although surviving with histopathological evidence of demyelination at 21 and 60 days after infection (data not shown). The lack of such 'chronic' lesions following MHV-4 infection in these mice may reflect absence of natural VAAS characteristic of S J L / J mice (Linthicum and Frelinger 1982) , which can develop chronic EAE (Lublin et al. 1981 ), or a direct or indirect effect of MHV-4 or ts8 infection on cells of the murine immune systems (Knobler et al., unpublished observations) limiting their usefulness as effectors. These possibilities may now be addressed by cell transfer experiments between (CXJ) RI strains.",
