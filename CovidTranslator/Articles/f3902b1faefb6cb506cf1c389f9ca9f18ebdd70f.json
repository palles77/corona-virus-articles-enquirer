Real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (rRT-PCR) procedures for detection and characterization of North American lineage (N. Am) SIV were developed and implemented at CDC for rapid identification of specimens from cases of suspected infections with SIV",

The first swine influenza virus (SIV), also referred to as classical SIV H1N1 virus, was isolated in the United States in 1930 and circulated in pigs for at least 60 years (22, 24) . From 1997 to 1998, triple-reassortant SIV (tr-SIV) H1N1, H1N2, H3N2, and H2N3 subtypes containing gene segments from human, avian, and swine influenza viruses were found to be circulating in North American (N. Am) swine populations (13, 14, 29, 33) . Genetic analysis showed that, in particular, the nucleoprotein (NP) gene of tr-SIVs was inherited from classical SIV, that the origins of the hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genes differed, and that those genes were most closely related to genes of classical SIV (H1N1), and recently isolated human (H1N2 and H3N2) or avian (H2N3) viruses (17, 30, 33) (Fig.  1) . These findings provide compelling evidence that tr-SIVs have an enhanced ability to acquire novel surface glycoproteins, thus causing public health concerns because of their potential pandemic threat (26) .",

Between 1990 and 2010, a total of 26 cases of human infections with SIVs were detected in the United States, most of which were isolated single cases of infection, with a history of direct or indirect exposure to pigs prior to onset of illness. In two cases, limited human-to-human transmission could not be excluded (3, 4, 23) . Because sporadic human infections of SIVs were detected through passive surveillance for human influenza, for which only a small subset of influenza A-positive samples are comprehensively analyzed, it was unclear how many human cases of SIV were occurring undetected. Thus, real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (rRT-PCR) procedures were designed and optimized at the Influenza Division of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in 2008 to allow for rapid, sensitive, and specific detection of these cases (25) . In April 2009, the first human cases of 2009 A (H1N1) pandemic (pdm) influenza were detected using the CDC rRT-PCR procedures originally designed to detect human cases of tr-SIV infection (12, 25) . This novel influenza virus, first found in the United States and Mexico (2, 7, 9, 19) , had never been previously isolated. Complete genome analysis determined that the 2009 A (H1N1) pdm influenza virus inherited its genes from an N. Am tr-SIV H1N1 virus and a Eurasian \"avian-like\" SIV (2, 7, 9, 19) (Fig. 1) .",

All influenza A viruses were InfA positive and swInfA and swH1 negative, as expected. All influenza B viruses were negative with all three assays. Analytical specificity was further demonstrated by testing 34 noninfluenza virus strains and bacterial organisms commonly present in the nasopharynx region of the human respiratory tract. Cross-reactivity was not observed with any of the noninfluenza organisms tested at high titers (see Table S3 in the supplemental material). Extracted RNA from non-SIV animal influenza viruses were also tested at high virus titers (see Table S4 in the supplemental material). As expected, all non-SIV animal influenza viruses tested were InfA positive and swH1 negative, although some viruses were positive in the swInfA assay. However, as not all three assays were positive for any non-SIV animal influenza virus, such results would be considered inconclusive and require further testing. A total of 607,344 respiratory specimens were tested for the presence of influenza virus by U.S. public health laboratories from 2 May 2009 through 6 February 2010 (12) . In order to monitor the performance of the CDC rRT-PCR Swine Flu Panel, U.S. public health laboratories were instructed to send human clinical specimens (nasal washes, nasal swabs, nasopharyngeal swabs, throat swabs, and lower respiratory tract specimens) with inconclusive test results to the CDC Influenza Division for further testing and characterization (Fig. 2 , CDC Influenza Division test results). Of 281 clinical specimens received due to inconclusive results, 160 specimens (59%) had InfA assay C T values higher than 30 when tested at CDC, indicating low viral concentrations near the limit of detection of the assay (average InfA C T value \u03ed 34.0, standard deviation [SD] \u03ed 2.2). Of those 160 specimens tested at CDC, 86 (54%) were found to be positive for 2009 A (H1N1) pdm influenza virus, 26 were inconclusive, 2 were invalid (influenza virus and RP markers all tested negative), and 46 were negative. The remaining 121 specimens received due to inconclusive results with InfA testing had C T values \u0545 30, indicating that virus titers in these specimens were well above the limit of detection of the assay. Of those 121 speciments, 103 (85%) were found to be positive for 2009 A (H1N1) pdm influenza virus by rRT-PCR or genetic sequence characterization. Eighteen specimens received due to inconclusive results were positive for multiple influenza viruses, suggesting coinfection with two or more influenza virus strains. Upon further genetic characterization, 12 of those 18 specimens contained seasonal trivalent live attenuated influenza virus vaccine (LAIV) and 6 were found to be positive for 2009 A (H1N1) pdm LAIV. Specimens containing 2009 A (H1N1) pdm LAIV that are tested using the CDC rRT-PCR Swine Flu Panel demonstrate inconclusive results that are positive for InfA and swH1 and negative for swInfA.",

However, the swInfA assay demonstrated cross-reactivity with HPAI H5N1 viruses and other non-SIV animal influenza A viruses tested in this study due to similarities of primer and probe sequences to those of some of these viruses. Since none of the non-SIV animal influenza virus tested were positive for all three assays on the CDC rRT-PCR Swine Flu Panel, these results would be considered inconclusive and require further genetic analysis.

Therefore, U.S. public health laboratories were advised to submit any clinical specimens with inconclusive results to the CDC Influenza Division for further testing and characterization. Among those submitted, six human specimens contained 2009 H1N1 LAIV, giving positive test results by the InfA and swH1 assays but negative results by the swInfA assay.

FDA clearance in 2008 (1) of the CDC rRT-PCR Flu Panel, a diagnostic assay that utilizes identical procedures and instrumentation, facilitated expeditious EUA clearance of the CDC rRT-PCR Swine Flu Panel. The CDC rRT-PCR Flu Panel, including rRT-PCR primers, probes, and controls, had been distributed since 2008 to support influenza surveillance and pandemic preparedness, allowing public health laboratories to detect seasonal influenza A (H1N1), A (H3N2), and HPAI A (H5N1) viruses (12). Accordingly, U.S. public health laboratories as well as many foreign laboratories have received training on use of the CDC rRT-PCR Flu Panel. Rapid deployment of the CDC rRT-PCR Swine Flu Panel to domestic and international laboratories facilitated the timely detection of 2009 A (H1N1) pdm influenza viruses, thus prompting state, local, and foreign governments to enact public health response activities. From 1 May 2009 until the declaration of the end of the emergency in the United States (23 June 2010), more than 2,100 kits were distributed to hundreds of U.S. public health laboratories and international National Influenza Centers (NICs).",
