Several factors contribute to the malpractice arising in tandem with rapid social development in the country. First, the numbers of doctors and nurses have not risen in line with the increasing number of people seeking medical services, which may make it difficult to maintain standards of infection prevention. Second, the ability to identify, report, and control infection in hospitals is relatively poor, especially compared with infectious disease control in the field, which has been strengthened since the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreaks in 2003. For example, Shunde Hospital had missed the chance of identifying the infection and had failed to respond promptly and properly when the second infected neonate with similar symptoms was diagnosed.",
