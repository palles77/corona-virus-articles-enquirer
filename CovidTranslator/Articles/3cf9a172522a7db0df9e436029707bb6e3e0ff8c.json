In certain instances the etiology is known, i.e., various organisms such as bacteria, parasites, or viruses, but the specific cause of the vast majority of this entity is still unknown. Several viral agents other than those previously recognized are suspected and a number of laboratories are engaged in examining the possible relationship of viruses to gastroenteritis. In our attempts to establish an animal model for studies of this disease, we have been examining the nonhuman primate to ascertain what ~druses :may be found in the intestinal tract of \"normal\" animals as well as animals with diarrhea (14, 15) . Of the various viruses currently suspected of being etiologically associated with this syndrome, rotaviruses, coronaviruses and the Norwalk agent are leading ca.ndidates. In a previous study we did not find electron microscopic evidence for a relationship with the rotaviruses (15) . Inasmuch as there was some evidence for the presence of coronaviruses in these animals, we turned our attention to this group of agents.",

Infants were removed from female parents at 6 to 8 months of age and grouped in gang cages, each having access to the stool of all others. Some baboons were housed 1 or 2 males with 20 breeder females. Offspring were not removed and had access to feces of cagemates.

Table 1 indicates the specimens examined for the presence of virus particles in diarrhea and normal stool samples. Of 108 samples, 46 contained coronaviruslike particles. Of these 46, mixed infection was found once with a herpesvirus, once with an adenovirus, and once with a picornavirus. The 62 coronavirusnegative samples yielded an adenovirus and a herpesvirus once each in different animals. Coronavirus-like particles were noted in 49 percent (19/39) of the diarrhea and 38 percent (27/69) of the normal stools. When age was considered, 3 of 45 infants, 21 of 24 juveniles, and 18 of 21 adult nonhuman primates had coronaviruslike particles (Table 1) .

General shape was the same but dimensions were frequently larger (up to 700nm). These particles did not have teardrop-shaped knobs on projections, but, had filament-like projections radiating from the particle which were attached to a single membranelike structure apparently encircling the particle. These were found in both normal and diarrhea specimens. In the course of studies attempting to define the viral etiology of diarrhea. in nonhuman primates housed either at this facility or sent to us from others, we have found several virus types including coronavirus-like particles, adenoviruses, herpesviruses, pieornaviruses (14) , and numerous bacteriophage types (15) associated with both normal fecal and diarrhea specimens.

Of our infants and juveniles, 1 of 35 nonweaned and 23 of 34 weaned animals had detectable eoronavirus-like particles ( Table 2) . These data support the theory that the process of weaning may be related to the likelihood of infection with eoronavirus-like particles. Furthermore, many of the infants in this study had access to colostrum which may prevent infection with coronavirus-like particles. It is well known that colostrum contains antibodies and possibly mediators of cell mediated immunity (24) . The percentage incidence of particles in feces from weaned animals was high for each species examined except chimpanzees. Even though these chimpanzees, which lacked detectable virus, were between 9 months and 4 years old, it is possible that when weaned and grouped with similar aged animals (6--8 months) they did not come into contact with the virus. It is also possible that the half-life of chimpanzee colostral antibodies is longer than typical and that antibody persisted in their serum (7, ",
