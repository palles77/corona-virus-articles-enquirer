ViPR captures various types of information, including sequence records, gene and protein annotations, 3D protein structures, immune epitope locations, clinical and surveillance metadata and novel data derived from comparative genomics analysis. Analytical and visualization tools for metadatadriven statistical sequence analysis, multiple sequence alignment, phylogenetic tree construction, BLAST comparison and sequence variation determination are also provided. Data filtering and analysis workflows can be combined and the results saved in personal 'Workbenches' for future use. ViPR tools and data are available without charge as a service to the virology research community to help facilitate the development of diagnostics, prophylactics and therapeutics for priority pathogens and other viruses.",

During such outbreaks, identification of the causative agent and comparative genomic analysis can be critical to limiting the spread of the virus and identifying suitable treatment options. While the first lines of defense against such outbreaks are clinical reporting and automated surveillance, 'wet lab' experimentation of viral isolates is also important. Bioinformatics tools and database resources that provide information about the genomic structures and phenotypic characteristics of known viruses can make this process more efficient by supporting data mining for the development of hypotheses worthy of in-depth laboratory experimentation on the emerging strain.",

Five such centers currently exist, each supporting a different class of human pathogens or insect vectors (www .pathogenportal.org). The Virus Pathogen Database and Analysis Resource (ViPR; www.ViPRbrc.org) serves as the publicly accessible repository for viruses categorized as either A-C priority pathogens or viruses that adversely affect public health (http://www.niaid.nih.gov/topics/ biodefenserelated/biodefense/research/pages/cata.aspx). ViPR is unique among other virus-centered databases in that it contains a wealth of integrated information for a large number of virus families that are pathogenic specifically to humans. This is in contrast with the NCBI viral genome project, which provides sequence data for all viruses (7) or the Human Immunodeficiency Virus sequence database (http://www.hiv.lanl.gov) and the Influenza Research Database (IRD, www.fludb.org) (8) , which focus on a particular taxon or virus pathogen.",

Because of these restrictions, it can be assumed that DENV infections reported in clinics located in non-tropical regions of the world are likely due to recent travel by the patient to an endemic area. These imported cases can thus establish viral lineage in new regions as a result of human travel. The CDC has recently demonstrated that the travel history of US residents having been clinically diagnosed with DENV between 1999 and 2000 validates such an explanation (30) . As an example use case, we will extend the CDC study by performing an in-depth comparative genomics analysis of all DENV serotype 1-4 isolates taken between the years of 1999 and 2000, involving the following bioinformatics workflow: (i) identify sequence records using the ViPR Genome Search interface; (ii) save the matching sequence records as a working set in a personal Workbench; (iii) reconstruct a phylogenetic tree; (iv) visualize the multiple sequence alignment; (v) perform a metadata-driven statistical analysis of sequence variation; (vi) determine where these differentiating residues are located in relation to validated Sequence Features; and (vii) examine the 3D structure associated with a homologous protein from a related DENV-2 strain.

The metadata-driven Comparative Analysis Tool for Sequences (meta-CATS) is an automated workflow, developed by the ViPR team, to assist researchers in taking advantage of the breadth of sequence data and the accompanying metadata. Metadata is the information associated with the sequence record, including time and place of specimen isolation, host species, clinical symptoms, etc. By using statistics to simultaneously analyze the sequence and metadata, genotypephenotype associations can be inferred. This tool allows users to quickly and easily select multiple sequences, align those sequences, divide them into multiple groups based on any one (or more) metadata type(s), perform automated statistical analyses on the sequences and view the results. The output from this tool has been validated using a previously published sequence set divided into two groups based on phylogenetic tree topology (32) .",

Additional investigation will be required to determine whether sequence differences in any of these individual positions or their combinations affect the secondary structure of the involved protein or play a role in dictating different phenotypic characteristics of these two virus lineages.

By taking advantage of the powerful suite of resources provided within the ViPR BRC, virology researchers can streamline and expedite experimental discovery, for the ultimate goal of developing improved diagnostics, prophylactics and/or therapeutics for pathogenic viruses.
