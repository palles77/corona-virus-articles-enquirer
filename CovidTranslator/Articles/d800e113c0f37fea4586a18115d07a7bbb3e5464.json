In order to identify the role of apoptosis in ASFV infection, we analyzed caspase induction during the infection and the impact of caspase inhibition on viral production. Caspases 3, 9 and 12 were activated from 16 h post-infection, but not caspase 8. Indeed, caspase 3 activation during the early stages of the infection appeared to be crucial for efficient virus exit. In addition, the inhibition of membrane blebbing reduced the release of virus particles from the cell. ASFV uses the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) as a site of replication and this process can trigger ER stress and the unfolded protein response (UPR) of the host cell. In addition to caspase 12 activation, indicators of ER stress include the upregulation of the chaperones calnexin and calreticulin upon virus infection. Moreover, ASFV induces transcription factor 6 signaling pathway of the UPR, but not the protein kinase-like ER kinase or the inositol-requiring enzyme 1 pathways. Thus, the capacity of ASFV to regulate the UPR may prevent early apoptosis and ensure viral replication.",

            "text": "African swine fever virus (ASFV) is a double-stranded large DNA virus that induces an acute disease of swine in which apoptosis has a central role in pathogenesis. Virus infection elicits apoptosis in target and immune defense cells. 1 The large repertoire of anti-apoptotic proteins encoded by the virus reflects the relevance of apoptosis in limiting viral replication in host cells. Many DNA viruses encode structural and functional homologs of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins, named viral Bcl2, including the A179L gene of ASFV. 2 In common with other viruses, ASFV has several strategies to block apoptotic pathways in order to complete virus replication. ASFV encodes proteins involved in apoptosis inhibition, thereby delaying the final execution step of the apoptotic pathway, which occurs only at late post-infection times. Programmed cell death itself may be relevant for the final release of virus particles within apoptotic bodies, which would provide this virus with a mechanism to spread, thus evading the immune system. The central component of the apoptotic machinery is the caspase proteolytic system. There are two groups of caspases: upstream initiator caspases, such as caspases 8 and 9, which cleave and activate other caspases; and downstream effector caspases, including caspase 3, which cleave a variety of cellular substrates, thereby disassembling cellular structures or inactivating enzymes. 3 Caspase 12 is associated with the cytoplasmic face of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and it cleaves to an active form in response to ER stress. 4 The ER stress response, also called the unfolded protein response (UPR), is mediated by three transmembrane proteins: (i) the protein kinase-like ER resident kinase (PERK); (ii) the activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6); and (iii) the inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1). 5 These three proteins are associated with the ER chaperone BiP/Grp78, which prevents their aggregation and further activation. However, when misfolded proteins accumulate, BiP is released, thus allowing UPR activation. Activated PERK phosphorylates the eukaryotic initiation factor 2a (eIF2a), thus resulting in translation attenuation to counterbalance enhanced protein accumulation. This counterbalancing effect includes the upregulation of the pro-apoptotic mRNA CHOP (c/EBP homologous protein) and mRNA encoding GADD34 (growth arrest and DNA-damage-inducible protein-34), whose association with the protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) leads to the dephosphorylation of eIF2a. 5 Activated IRE1 removes 26 nucleotides from X-box binding protein-1 (XBP1) mRNA, thereby altering the open reading frame and causing the translation of an active transcription factor. 6 The spliced form of XBP1 protein (sXBP1) is involved in the transcriptional activation of a number of genes, including the ER mannosidase-like protein EDEM, which participates in protein degradation. Finally, activated ATF6 exits ER compartment to migrate to the Golgi apparatus where it is cleaved by proteases. 7 ATF6 cytosolic fragment is a transcription factor responsible for the transcriptional induction of XBP1 as well as many ER chaperone-encoding genes. 5 However, when cells are unable to recover from ER stress, apoptosis occurs.",

It is therefore not surprising that viruses have evolved various mechanisms to counteract these responses that limit or inhibit viral replication. For instance, BiP is induced in cells infected with respiratory syncytial virus, 8 hanta viruses, 9 hepatitis C virus (HCV), 10 bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), 11 Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), 12 dengue 13 and enterovirus 71. 14 The induction of PERK has also been reported in infection with herpes simplex virus, 15 cytomegalovirus (CMV) 16 and BVDV. 11 The IRE1 pathway has been shown to be activated in cells infected with JEV, dengue 17 and severe acute respiratory syndrome virus, 18 whereas the ATF6 pathway is triggered upon HCV infection 19 and both IRE1 and ATF6 arms are induced during Rotavirus infection. 20 In addition, the activation of all three pathways of the UPR has been reported in infection with West Nile virus 21 and dengue. 22 Furthermore, ASFV encodes the DP71L protein homolog to GADD34, 23 which inhibits the induction of ATF4 and its downstream target CHOP. 24, 25 However, the infection does not induce the phosphorylation of PERK or the upregulation of BiP. 24 Here, we found that ASFV induces caspases 3, 9 and 12 but not caspase 8 in infected cells, as it regulates the three arms of the UPR signaling cascade, thus inhibiting the pathways that hinder viral infection and activating those that are beneficial.",

Myosin II ATPase activity, together with the GTPase ROCK-I, is necessary for cell membrane fragmentation into multiple apoptotic bodies in the execution phase of apoptosis. Also, we analyzed the effect of Y-27632, a ROCK-I inhibitor that blocks membrane blebbing. We then compared final infective virus production at 48 hpi when these drugs were added to the cells, either 2 h before infection, or at 6 hpi. Our results showed that neither blebbing nor caspase 3 inhibition modified total virus production (extracellular plus intracellular virus production; Figure 2a ). Caspase 3 activation in early stages of the infection was required for virus exit, whereas the inhibition of membrane blebbing reduced the release of virus particles from the cell and this effect was enhanced when the inhibitor was added 6 hpi ( Figure 2b ). In order to asses a possible role of caspase 12 in caspase 3 and 9 activation, we analyzed the effect of caspase 12 inhibition in infected cells using Z-ATD-FMK. Addition of this inhibitor before infection did not affect percentages of ASFV-infected cells as detected by flow cytometry (fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS); Figure 3a ). Also, this inhibitor did not cause a decrease in virus production nor in the exit of virus particles ( Figure 3b ). Moreover, our results showed that neither caspase 3 nor caspase 9 were inhibited by Z-ATD-FMK and only caspase 12 activation was specifically inhibited (Figure 3c ).",

Calreticulin and calnexin were induced upon ASFV infection at 16 hpi (Figure 4a ), while only a modest increase in PDI levels was found at 48 hpi. Interestingly, ASFV did not induce the expression of ERp57 or BiP. Chaperone upregulation was coincident with the expression of viral protein p30. Actin levels remained constant during the course of the infection, indicating that chaperone induction was not caused by a global upregulation of protein translation. We also analyzed the expression of BiP by inmunofluorescence. Cells treated with tunicamycin showed a typical ER pattern for BiP, while BiP expression was undetectable in non-treated/non-infected controls and infected cells (Figure 4c ).

In response to ER stress, ATF6 exits the ER to the Golgi apparatus, where it is processed by proteases to its active form, which in turn translocates to the nucleus. In order to monitor ATF6 activation by fluorescence microscopy, we used an EGFP (enhanced green fluorescent protein)-ATF6 fusion protein (pCMV short-EGFP-ATF6). 32 This protein was under the control of a shortened CMV promoter, which has a deletion of 430 bp from the 5 0 side in order to prevent overexpression, which would modify the localization of the fusion protein itself. The short promoter shows considerably less activity than the full promoter and GFP-ATF6 expressed under the short CMV promoter localizes exclusively to the ER and translocates to the nucleus, in a similar way to endogenous ATF6. 32 Cells transfected with the pCMV short-EGFP-ATF6 plasmid presented a typical ER pattern that relocated to the Golgi apparatus (Figure 6b ) or to the nucleus (Figure 6c ) in response to tunicamycin treatment. However, this characteristic pattern was modified in infected cells. Cells transfected with this construct and infected with ASFV showed GFP-ATF6 localization either in discrete perinuclear cytoplasmic areas corresponding to viral factories, as indicated by their co-localization with DNA stain (Figures 6d and e) , or in the nucleus of infected cells (Figure 6f ). This finding indicates that ASFV activates the ATF6 pathway of the UPR. We next studied the effect of a serine protease inhibitor that inhibits ER stress-induced proteolysis of ATF6, AEBSF 33 on ASFV infection. Addition of this inhibitor before infection affected the percentages of ASFV-infected cells in a dose-dependent manner as detected by FACS (Figure 7a) . AEBSF also induced a strong inhibition of viral production resulting in 100% reduction of viral titer at 300 mM concentrations of AEBSF (data not shown). We analyzed caspase activation under AEBSF to find that this agent abrogated caspase 3, 9 and 12 activation in infected cells. Inhibition of caspases was dependent of AEBSF effect on infection, given that this serine protease inhibitor did not prevent activation of caspase 3 induced by staurosporine (Figure 7b ).",

            "text": "Apoptosis is a genetically controlled cell death mechanism involved in the regulation of tissue homeostasis. We analyzed the mechanism by which ASFV induces apoptosis in infected cells and observed that caspases 3 and 9 are activated with similar kinetics as of 16 hpi. However, ASFV-induced apoptosis was independent of caspase 8 activation, a process involved in the extrinsic apoptotic pathways. These results indicated that the virus induces apoptosis through the mitochondrial pathway rather than the death receptormediated pathway. ASFV triggers apoptosis in an early stage of the infection process. 34 Nevertheless, extensive apoptosis of infected cells occurs only at late post-infection times. Programmed cell death itself might be relevant for the release of virus particles into apoptotic bodies, which would provide a mechanism to facilitate virus spread and evasion of the immune system. Our results show that caspase 3 activation in early stages of the infection, was relevant for virus exit and that membrane blebbing contributes to virus dissemination, given the fact that the inhibition of the effector caspase 3 reduced the release of virus particles from the cell and this effect was enhanced when the inhibitor was added after 6 hpi. Thus, ASFV takes advantage of an early induction of apoptosis, through caspase 3 activity, while the final execution of programmed cell death in apoptotic blebs contribute to ASFV invasion of host cells and evasion of the immune surveillance. In addition to its critical role in apoptosis, caspase 3 participates in other cellular processes. 35 This could also be the case of ASFV infection, where activation of caspase 3 may be required during early stages of infection to ensure subsequent virus exit from the cell. Another example is the influenza virus infection, in which caspase 3 inhibitors prevent the formation of progeny influenza A virus particles. 36 We have also shown that ASFV infection in Vero cells induces caspase 12, although this induction is not required for viral production or for caspases 3 and 9 activation. Caspase 12 is a characteristic ER stress response caspase. Virus assembly begins with the modification of ER membranes, which are subsequently recruited to the viral factories and transformed into viral precursor membranes. 37 Moreover, a large amount of viral proteins are synthesized and accumulated in infected cells, thus overloading the ER-folding capacity. This overload can lead to the activation of the ER stress response of the host cell. Activated caspase 12, a key marker of ER stress-mediated apoptosis, may potentially interact with another pro-apoptotic protein, Bap31, resulting in a feedback mechanism involving the release of cytochrome c elicited through the mitochondrial pathway. 38 However, Bap31 was not activated by the fragmentation of p20 in ASFV-infected cells. This observation indicates the absence of direct pro-apoptotic signals between the ER and mitochondria. Caspase 12 was triggered in ASFV-infected cells but this activation does not necessarily result in apoptosis, because the virus has the capacity to block ER stress at a later step. In general, ER stress starts with the transcriptional induction of ER-localized chaperones as a survival signal. Molecular chaperones are key components of the ER machinery; their main function consists of ensuring the quality of the ER by maintaining newly synthesized proteins in a proper state for folding, and marking misfolded proteins for degradation. Two folding systems have been proposed to contribute to this quality control. One of these is composed of grp78 (BiP), grp94 and PDI. The second system, known as the 'calnexincalreticulin cycle', includes calnexin, calreticulin and ERp57. 39 Chaperone expression analysis of ASFV-infected cells revealed a marked increase in calnexin and calreticulin expression from 16 hpi, and to a lesser extent, of PDI at 48 hpi. However, ASFV did not induce the expression of ERp57, which, together with calnexin and calreticulin, assists disulfide bond formation in glycoprotein folding. Surprisingly, ASFV did not elicit the expression of grp78 (BiP), thereby indicating that the virus contains the ER stress at this level.",

            "text": "To determine whether ER stress is involved in ASFVinduced cellular responses, we analyzed several ER stressrelated proteins, including CHOP, GADD34, XBP1, ATF6 and ATF4. Previous results showed that viral infection in Vero cells inhibits the induction of the ATF4-CHOP signaling arm of the UPR. 24, 25 However, we observed expression of ATF4 from 48 hpi when virus is thought to promote programmed cell death in order to spread progeny. The inhibition of this UPR branch results in an attenuation of protein translation. To avoid this, ASFV encodes the DP71L gene, a GADD34 homolog that interacts with the catalytic subunit of PP1, and activates its phosphatase activity 40 and that also promotes the expression of cellular GADD34, as shown here. The activation of the ATF6 branch and its transcriptional activation of chaperone-encoding genes might benefit the virus by assisting the folding of accumulated proteins and preventing protein aggregation. We demonstrated ATF6 translocation to the nucleus. Activated ATF6 exits the ER to the Golgi apparatus, where it is processed by proteases to its active form, which in turn translocates to the nucleus. 7 We used a short promoter that has considerably lower activity than the full promoter, and GFP-ATF6 expressed under the short CMV promoter localizes exclusively to the ER and translocates to the nucleus in a similar manner to endogenous ATF6. 32 The analysis of ATF6 distribution by confocal microscopy in Vero cells infected with ASFV revealed that this protein was translocated into the nucleus. ATF6 was also located in discrete perinuclear cytoplasmic areas that corresponded to viral factories, as indicated by the colocalization of ATF6 with DNA-containing cytoplasmic foci. Furthermore, ASFV viral replication was blocked by inhibition of the ATF6 translocation to the nucleus by AEBSF. To analyze the transcriptional activity of ATF6 in ASFV infection we examined the expression of XBP1 in ASFV-infected cells by qRT-PCR. Surprisingly, ASFV-infected samples showed a decrease in the induction of XBP1 compared with uninfected samples. Activation of ATF6 was necessary for ASFV replication; however, the virus prevented the transcriptional induction of some ATF6-target genes, such as XBP1 and BiP, but not calnexin or calreticulin. These studies have focused interest in ATF6 pathway in this viral infection and have paved the way for further characterization of ASFV viral gene regulation of these molecules in the UPR.",
