The plant virus, cow pea mosaic virus (CPMV), has recently been explored as a nanoparticle delivery system for therapeutics targeting a number of diseases including cancer and neurodegeneration. To understand the biodistribution of CPMV in the CNS, we examined CPMV uptake during infection of mice with neurotropic mouse hepatitis virus (MHV). CPMV localized mainly to the CNS endothelium in areas that contained an intact blood brain barrier. However, in inflammatory lesions containing macrophage/microglial cell infiltration and IgG, CPMV could be detected in the brain parenchyma. Furthermore, CPMV showed rapid internalization in an in vitro model of the BBB. These results suggest that CPMV particles could be used to a vehicle to deliver therapeutics to the damaged CNS during neurodegenerative and infectious diseases of the CNS.",

A member of the family Coronaviridae, MHV is an enveloped postitive-stranded RNA virus and commonly used as an animal model of the human demyelinating disease multiple sclerosis (MS) (Lane and Buchmeier, 1997) . CNS infection of susceptible mouse strains with MHV results in an acute encephalomyelitis with breakdown of the BBB followed by a secondary inflammatory demyelinating phase characterized by damage to oligodendrocytes (Lane and Buchmeier, 1997; Zhou et al., 2003) . Depending on the strain, MHV infects ependymal cells that line the ventricles, macrophages, microglia, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes (Wang et al., 1992) . Infectious virus is cleared approximately 2 weeks post-infection. However, the persistence of viral RNA in glial cells is thought to contribute the demyelination seen in the chronic phase of the disease due to infiltration of immune cells such as lymphocytes, macrophages, and activated microglial cells that results in tissue injury (Dandekar et al., 2004; Kim and Perlman, 2005; Lavi et al., 1984) .",

Purified CPMV was prepared as previously described (Khor et al., 2002) and labeled with alexa fluor 555 (AF555). To conjugate AF555 dyes to lysines on wild-type CPMV capsid, 1 mg AF555 carboxylic acid, 2,3,5,6-tetrafluorophenyl ester (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) was suspended in 0.1 M K-phosphate buffer and mixed with 5 mg of CPMV in a total volume of 2.5 ml using a molar ratio of 10 dyes per asymmetric unit. The virus-dye suspension was incubated overnight at room temperature in a rolling shaker. After incubation the samples were initially purified by ultracentrifugation at 42,000 rpm (3 hours, 4\u00b0C) and resuspended in 1 ml of the same buffer. To eliminate free dye the sample was further purified by sucrose gradient (10%-40% w/v in PBS) ultracentrifugation at 28,000 rpm (3 hours, 4\u00b0C). After collecting the labeled CPMV fraction the virus was concentrated by ultracentrifugation at 42,000 rpm (3 hours, 4\u00b0C). The final pellet was resuspended in PBS (Gibco-BRL) and filtered through a 0.2-\u03bcm membrane (Costar) to eliminate aggregate particles and sterilize the sample. Particles were examined by FPLC on a Superose\u2122-6 size-exclusion column (Amersham Pharmacia). The number of dyes per particle was calculated where dyes/particle = [(Abs 260 \u00d7 dilution) / \u2208 AlexaFluor 555 ] / (concentration of CPMV / molecular weight of CPMV); where \u2208 AlexaFluor 555 = 150,000 and the molecular weight of CPMV = 5.6 \u00d7 10 6 grams/mole.",

However, it was unknown whether CPMV could specifically interact with the specialized cells of the blood brain barrier. To characterize the interaction with brain endothelial cells, the uptake of CPMV by the mouse brain endothelial cell line, bEND.3 was studied in vitro. bEND.3 cells display many characteristics of the blood brain barrier such as transendothelial resistance and expression of claudin-5 ( Figure 1A and (Koto et al., 2007) ). Purified CPMV was added to bEND.3 cells at a concentration of 10 5 virus particles/cell and incubated for 1 hour at 37\u00b0C, conditions previously shown to promote internalization by CPMV (Lewis et al., 2006) . Robust binding and internalization of CPMV was seen in these cells after performing immunohistochemistry with an anti-CPMV antibody ( Figure 1A , B). After internalization, CPMV has a perinuclear distribution indicating uptake by endocytic vesicles, similar to the distribution previously observed in fibroblasts (Lewis et al., 2006) (Figure 1C ). We next examined whether this particle could associate with endothelial cells of the BBB in vivo, during normal and disease states in mice. To establish a model of neuroinflammation and BBB breakdown, MHV infection of mice was employed. C57BL/6 mice are susceptible to infection with neurotropic MHV and develop encephalitis followed by an inflammatory demyelinating disease that resembles MS (Figure 2A ). Mice were infected with a single intracerebral (i.c.) inoculation containing 50 PFU of MHV and the disease course was compared with mock infected mice that received an equal volume of PBS i.c. Symptoms in MHV infected mice appeared approximately day 3 after infection, and rapidly progressed so that a majority of mice showed limb paralysis by day 6 after infection ( Figure 2B ). Typically complete clearance of virus in the CNS and periphery is observed by two weeks postinfection (Lane and Buchmeier, 1997) . After MHV infection, mice displayed infiltration of inflammatory cells throughout the brain paraenchyma and in brain meninges indicating that the virus elicited a robust inflammatory response in the CNS ( Figure 2C and data not shown).",

Healthy mice showed localization of punctuate CPMV-A555 signal in CD31-positive endothelial cells in meninges and brain parenchyma, similar to the endothelial distribution seen in other organs after CPMV-A555 injection into mice (Figure 4 A,D, G, J and (Lewis et al., 2006) and Koudelka submitted). This endothelial localization was similar during MHV infection (Figure 4 B, C, E, F, H, and I), in particular in vessels that continued to express claudin-5, one of the main proteins localized to tight junctions in the BBB ( Figure 4L ) (Huber et al., 2001) . However, in contrast to mock infection, CPMV-A555 particles were also observed outside of CD31 positive vessels in the MHV-infected mice ( Figure 4H , I). Fluorescence signal was quantified inside and outside the vessel. Similar levels of CPMV were seen in vessels in both mock-infected and MHV-infected mice. However after MHV infection, approximately 25% of the fluorescence signal is located outside the vessel (Supplementary Figure 1) . Therefore, it appears that CPMV can penetrate the BBB and it may be possible that additional CNS cell types take up CPMV in the brain parenchyma during infection.",

The versatility of this nanoparticle is due to its ease of production, lack of toxicity, and the ability to manipulate the particle chemically and genetically. In this study, the localization of CPMV in CNS tissue was examined in healthy animals or during infection with neurotropic MHV. Examination of the CNS by confocal microscropy showed that injection of CPMV into mice with MHV infection results in uptake by cerebral endothelial cells. However, breakdown of the BBB facilitated the movement of CPMV out of the vasculature and into the brain parenchyma, specifically in lesions that contained infiltrating immune cells.",

The method of administration also determines targeting of nanoparticles to different tissues in the body. A number of particles have been tested for their ability to interact with cells of the CNS. Stereotactic injection of iron oxide conjugated baculovirus into rat brain ventricles results in the localization of particles in cells of the choroid plexus (Raty et al., 2006) . Cationic albumin-conjugated pegylated nanoparticles accumulated in the periventricular region and 3 rd ventricle after intravenous injection into mice (Lu et al., 2005) . In both these instances, the increased permeability of the ventricular region may have facilitated delivery of the nanoparticles. In contrast to the primarily ventricular distribution of the previous particles, adenovirus and herpesvirus particles showed uptake by neuronal cells. However, in these studies osmotic disruption or direct injection into the CNS was necessary to cross the BBB (Muldoon et al., 1995) . In this study, CPMV efficiently targeted cells of the cerebral vasculature after peripheral administration. During mock infection, CD31 positive vessels show accumulation of labeled CPMV particles. A similar distribution pattern is seen on days 3 and 10 after MHV infection. CPMV accumulates in endothelial cells throughout the meninges and in the CNS parenchyma in both mock infected and MHV infected mice.",

Since CPMV is capable of crossing the BBB during injury, future studies will determine if chemical modification of the CPMV capsid may facilitate uptake by additional CNS resident cells such as neurons and oligodendrocytes. Neurotrophic factors have shown efficacy in animal models of neurodegenerative and demyelinated diseases, but appear not to cross the BBB effectively (Suzuki and Svendsen, 2008) .
