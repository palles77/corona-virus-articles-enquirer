In this study, we demonstrate that geldanamycin has very strong activities against herpes simplex virus type 2 in vitro and in vivo (mouse vagina model). In mouse vagina model, administration of geldanamycin suspension to vagina after virus infection protected the infected mice from death and increased the average survival days in a dose-dependent manner. Geldanamycin also significantly reduced virus shedding from mouse vagina. All geldanamycin-treated groups were statistically significant when compared with the infected control group. The high-dose group of geldanamycin (5.72 mg kg \u00c01 ) was better than acyclovir group (2.86 mg kg \u00c01 ). All geldanamycin vaginal administration mockinfected groups did not show significant body weight loss. Although geldanamycin has strong antiviral activities against various DNA and RNA viruses, geldanamycin is not suitable for systemic administration because of its high toxicity. We consider that geldanamycin is a candidate of topical usage for the treatment of herpes simplex virus type infections.",

HSV-2 infects the human genital tract mucosa, leading to sexually transmitted diseases. Genital herpes is one of the most prevalent sexually transmitted diseases worldwide, especially in immuno-compromised population. 1 And HSV-2 infection increases the risk of HIV infection. 2, 3 Moreover, HSV-2 transmission can occur via sexual and perinatal route during asymptomatic viral shedding. 3 There are several drugs licensed for the treatment of HSV infections and most of them target viral DNA polymerase. Because of the rapid emergence of drug-resistant virus strains, the development of effective therapies for HSV-caused diseases becomes more and more important, especially the development of novel therapeutic agents with different mechanisms of action.",

            "text": "Geldanamycin (GA) is an antibiotic with its primary target on the ADP/ATP-binding site of heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90). GA binding blocks the activity of Hsp90 chaperone function and results in rapid degradation of Hsp90-associated client proteins via the ubiquitinproteasome pathway. These client proteins include RAF-1, ERRB-2, CDK4 and AKT/PKB, p53, pRb and steroid hormone receptors. 4, 5 As a specific inhibitor of Hsp90, GA and its derivatives display antitumor activities in a multitude of animal models. 6, 7 17-AAG, a derivative of GA, is now in clinical trial for the treatment of various cancers, which include multiple myeloma (phase III), breast, renal, thyroid, ovarian, pancreas (phase II), pediatric solid tumors (phase I). 8, 9 In the field of virology, Hsp90 is important for several virus replications, including HBV, HCV, HCMV, HSV, VSV, vaccinia virus, coxsackie virus, rhinovirus and Ebola virus. [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] It has been shown that Hsp90 specific inhibitor GA blocks the replication of the viruses mentioned above in cell culture systems. We also confirmed that GA significantly decreased the mortality and increased the mean survival day of mice in HSV-1 mouse encephalitis model. 20 In this study, anti-HSV-2 activities of GA were evaluated both in cell culture and in a genital model of mice infected with HSV-2.",

Therefore, it is worthwhile to develop new antivirals with different mechanisms of actions. Targeting a cellular protein related to virus replication is a potential alternative approach for antiviral drug development.

And the mechanism of GA against HSV-1 were explored. 18 The antiviral mechanism of GA against HSV-1 appears to be associated with Hsp90 inactivation and cell cycle restoration, which indicates that GA exhibits broad-spectrum antiviral activity. In fact, GA exhibited broad-spectrum antiviral activity against HSV-2, VSV, Coxsackie virus B3, HIV-1, SARS coronavirus in vitro. 18 And other paper reported GA effectively inhibited replication of HCMV, HPIV-2, HPIV-3, poliovirus, rhinovirus. 15, 16 GA exhibited antiviral activity in vitro was reported in many papers. [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] Relevant reports about antiviral activity of GA in vivo are relatively rare. We confirmed GA effectively inhibited HSV-1 in vivo in our previous work. 20 GA were administrated by intraperitoneal injection and subcutaneous injection and exhibited inhibitory effect against HSV-1 in mouse encephalitis model. 20 It is difficult to develop systemic administration of GA because of low water solubility and high hepatotoxicity. 23 So we did lot of work for modification of GA and got some GA derivatives. We have discussed the structure-activity relationship of GA derivatives in HCV replicon system 19 and HSV-1, HSV-2, HCMV, HBV, Coxsackie virus B3, Coxsackie virus B6. 24 Overall, the cytotoxicity of most of the tested derivatives was decreased as compared with the lead compound GA. But the antiviral activity against HSV-2 of most of the tested derivatives 19 except one compound was also reduced compared with GA (see Supplementary data).",
