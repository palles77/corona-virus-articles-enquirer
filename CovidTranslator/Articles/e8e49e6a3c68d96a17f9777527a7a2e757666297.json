In some cases, for example earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, the exact time of their occurrence may not be usefully predictable. But they should not be a complete surprise. For a given city or region, with moderate effort, it is possible to identify what principal risks exist, where their impacts will lie, and what indicative signs will warn of an impending event. Some of this analysis may come from historical records, some from scientific research, such as local geoscience, and some from contemporary instrumentation. This analysis will also point to the people and infrastructures that are most at risk and will allow assessment of humanitarian and economic costs of likely events. This in turn will permit the development of policy for the mitigation of some or all of these risks and the identification of instances where mitigation and day-to-day activities can support each other -for example, where smart grid technologies also confer disaster resilience or where a flood zone is designated as a park when not under water. The goal of such policy is not to construct a built environment that is unassailable by natural forces, which in general is impractical, but rather to understand the core systems of life in the city or region and to ensure that these can be protected and re-established as quickly as possible following an event. This is resilience to natural disasters.",

Japan has 28,0 0 0 km of coastline and some 40% of this has a sea wall, typically 6 m high or more, to protect against tsunamis. And so Japan should not be ashamed that an exceptional Magnitude 9 earthquake [4] produced waves that easily surmounted such sea walls. But it was evident in Fukushima and other coastal regions that insufficient thought -systems thinking -had gone into the possibility that such an event could happen and what the related consequences might be. Such failures to challenge assumptions, to assess systemic interdependencies, and to consider the knock-on effects of failures can create secondary disasters that are simply waiting to be triggered by a natural disaster.

More recently Ebola has presented a similar threat, which has now been contained, but with a cost of over 11,0 0 0 lives. Historically contagious diseases, notably the major plagues of the middle ages, have presented extreme threats to the resilience of societies, not only in localized cities, but globally as they are rapidly and widely propagated through trade and air travel. \u2022 Extreme weather events: For example Hurricane Katrina, which devastated the city of New Orleans in 2005 and overwhelmed even the abilities of the United States to contain and recover from this disaster. Almost 200 people died in this event and the subsequent flooding, which left some 75,0 0 0 people homeless. The financial cost is estimated at USD 125bn. Large areas of New Orleans remain destroyed to this day and the population is no more than half of its pre-event level. Other violent weather events include tornados, snow and ice storms, and monsoons. \u2022 Flooding and landslides: Extreme weather events are often associated with fluvial flooding as rivers overflow their banks and as levees and dams collapse. Pluvial flooding is the runoff from higher ground resulting from heavy or sustained rainfall. Hurricanes often produce extremely heavy rainfall owing to the seawater they carry inland. Heavy rainfall and associated flooding may also lead to landslides. For example the disaster in Rio de Janeiro in April 2010 that produced landslides in the favelas on the hills surrounding the main city resulted in the loss of 400 lives and a financial cost estimated at USD 13bn. \u2022 Storm surges: Coastal flooding occurs when high winds from hurricanes and lesser storms drive tides higher onto shore, especially where natural barrier islands and sub-surface reefs, mangroves, and other vegetation have been removed. Such storm surges were experienced in the 2012 Hurricane Sandy in the region of New York City. destroyed some USD 4bn property. As rainfall patterns change, new areas of drought are susceptible to such fires, which are extremely difficult to contain especially when fanned by strong winds. \u2022 Volcanoes: In April 2010 the Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull volcano in Iceland erupted, spewing a vast cloud of ash into the skies over the North Atlantic and Western Europe. There were no direct deaths associated with this, although there may be longterm health issues for those who breathed the contaminated air, but the event heavily disrupted air travel for some 10 million passengers in the region with an estimated economic impact of USD 1.7bn.",

Prior to midcentury there was no doubt some undercounting as the world was less instrumented and populated.

The increasing inter-connectedness of the world appears to be responsible for epidemics originating in previously isolated pockets of diseases such as HIV, SARS, avian 'flu, and MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome). The 2012 IPCC reports [6] on climate change concluded that there is no strong relationship between the numbers of extreme weather events and global warming, although there may be an overall increase in their violence due to higher ocean temperatures, and climate change may also lead to droughts or elevated temperatures that degrade agriculture. Climate change leading to droughts may result in more and larger wildfires. Rising sea levels, together with more powerful storms, account for some increases in coastal flooding.

These models correlate historical data about the occurrence of natural disaster events in regions with the impacts created in terms of the loss of life and the destruction of the built environment. As cities expand laterally or vertically (taller buildings) and as the violence of weather-related events increases, the probable impacts also grow. Insurers are naturally concerned that their liabilities in such events are adequately covered in the long-term by premiums paid by individuals or governments. Some governments, such as the Government of New Zealand, operate public insurance programmes to cover such risks. Such insurers are motivated to work with local and regional governments to mitigate the natural disaster risks.

Latency in the propagation of system state often leads to dysfunctional adaptations, as systems respond to remote stresses that have since disappeared.

Destruction of the electricity distribution system meant that gas stations could not dispense fuel, even though it was in the tanks underground. Shops and hotels could not operate for lack of electricity to operate lights, refrigerators, and cash registers and the systems of delivering fresh food had broken down. Automatic Teller Machines lacked both electricity and communications, so people could not get money. Governments and businesses could not pay their workers because they no longer knew who was on the payroll and the banking systems were not accessible. Later, a quarter of a million vehicles that had been destroyed or swept away would need to be de-registered and insurance claims filed. This was a vivid experience of the inter-dependencies that exist among the many Urban Systems, and that make recovery of \"normal life\" following a disaster so very difficult.

While global sustainability may demand reductions in greenhouse gas emissions through lower energy consumption, a given city or nation may by itself be more resilient if it develops strong industries that rely on high energy consumption. However resilience and sustainability may also be mutually supportive as illustrated in Fig. 3 . For example, we will show later that resilience can often be increased by reducing system dependencies and inter-dependencies; thus reducing resource consumption from the natural environment may benefit both resilience and sustainability.",

Unfortunately human reaction to risks is highly irrational. In the immediate aftermath of a disaster, there is great outcry over how such an event could take so many lives and create such destruction. The public and political leaders demand unlimited effort s to compensate losses. Survivors insist that their community and property be re-constructed to the pre-event state, while environmental agencies advise against re-building in what is clearly a high-risk area. Insurance compensation is negotiated, planning committees are set up, and survivors become frustrated at their lack of involvement and at the length of time taken. After several months other events capture the attention of the public and their political leaders and interest in the aftermath of the disaster declines. A number of years later many of the survivors are still displaced and waiting for compensation. Some decades later the collective memory has faded and construction begins anew in high-risk areas. A tragic story from the 2011 East Japan tsunami tells of stone markers several centuries old and elevated along the coastline that warn against building below that level [18] . Studies show that most disaster recoveries go through two cycles of planning, the first being appalling and the second only slightly better [19] . Instead of viewing disasters as isolated, unpredictable events followed by attempts at recovery, it is more effective to consider them as a continual element of urban planning as shown in Fig. 4 . This lifecycle consists of a very long-term process of risk identification, risk assessment, planning and implementation of mitigations, evolving to real-time processes as a disaster occurs or becomes imminent, and extending again through recovery processes back to long-term considerations. Most cities exposed to such risks will invest in equipment and training for the disaster management itself, but struggle with the long-term perspectives that influence investments for mitigation and adaptation. These investments, which tend to be large relative to normal Public Works budgets, are a choice like any other investment in that there is always an associated opportunity cost.",

Similar analyses can be applied to estimating the height and on-shore penetration of tsunamis [30] . These results are then used by municipal and regional administrations to estimate what areas are likely to be flooded [31] and should be evacuated. A new factor for such models is the predicted local rise in sea-level resulting from climate change [32] . Because of ocean currents and persistent wind patterns, sea-rise is not uniform around the world. Also the elevation of coastal land subject to earthquakes can move vertically as well as laterally; the area around Sendai moved vertically by several meters following the 11 March 2011 event.

With such information, we can proceed to apply systems analysis to determine how best to ensure that critical services can continue during and following the predicted events. The traditional approach to natural disaster risk mitigation has been to invest in infrastructure projects with the aim of achieving blanket protection of a community or region. We argue that this is not only practically unachievable, it is also unaffordable.

It is efficient, from the perspective of the utility, but far from resilient from the point of view of the consumer. In the State of Connecticut, an affluent state in the northeast of the USA, outages of a couple of days affecting many thousands of people are annual occurrences and outages of a week or more affecting hundreds of thousands of people every few years.

Historically it was argued that large, centralised plant was a more efficient use of capital. Today it is often cheaper to manufacture large volumes of small devices than a single, one-of-a-kind device. We see this already in that the cost per Watt of solar panels has fallen below the cost per Watt of traditional power stations in recent years (even without government subsidies). \u2022 Automation in system management now embodies large amounts of knowledge that were previously only accessible via human operators. Historically it was argued that it took the same amounts of labour to manage a large plant as to manage a small plant. Today much of the intelligence required to manage a given capability, at least for relatively short periods, say, a few days, can be embedded in the sub-system's own local, intelligence. This removes the dependence on communication with a centralised control centre and creates a \"virtual utility\" spanning the distributed sub-systems. \u2022 If such a sub-system does fail, it affects f ewer people and their location is precisely known. When the electricity network in Tohoku shut down following the tsunami, it cut off power to many areas that were essentially unaffected by the disaster. Further, restoring power to those regions then depended on human inspection, which consumed many persondays of effort that could more usefully have been applied in areas that were affected by the disaster. Decentralisationtogether with extensive IoT-based instrumentation of infrastructure to detect failures -would allow disaster responders to operate more efficiently in the vicinity of the disaster and to focus their efforts. \u2022 Being closer to the disaster impact zone, such a system can respond more quickly and more appropriately than a remote control centre. A challenge with traditional electricity distribution is that the electrical utility has no means to detect which customers have lost power, although this is one of the aims of current Smart Meter [41] initiatives.",

As the scenario above illustrates, in a disaster zone the lack of electrical power impacts the water supply, the operation of hospitals and other healthcare facilities, telecommunications, refrigeration of foods, the availability of fuel for transportation and heating, and so forth. As our dependence on a stable electricity supply has grown, service interruptions for any reason have become less acceptable to consumers. In regions where the supply is not dependable, such as India and Connecticut, the inhabitants who can afford to do so will install their own generators, historically powered by hydrocarbons. When the network supply fails, these private systems will disconnect from the network, start up the generator, run independently, and reverse the process when network power is restored. Such independent generation and distribution networks are known as \"micro-grids\". Today many homes in Europe and North America are installing solar panels with peak generation levels that exceed the home's demand for much of the year. Since these clearly do not generate at night or during heavily cloudy days, they are not complete substitutes for the hydrocarbon-powered-generators, but there is a prospect of affordable energy storage based on either re-cycling of batteries from electric vehicles or from new technologies. In combination, the possibility exists for autonomous, decentralised energy production, known as \"island operation\" at the scale of a community or even a single house.

These base stations also had back-up batteries with only a few hours' capacity. Since that event, the battery capacity in Japan has been expanded to provide a few days of back-up power. Other countries employ local diesel generators to provide such capacity. The backhaul from the mobile telephone towers to the backbone network is increasingly provided by microwave radio links that have a good chance of surviving earthquakes and tsunamis.

Through smart cities initiatives and the emergence of the Internet of Things, we have more factual knowledge about such Urban Systems and growing scientific insights about how cities in general work. Through these we are gaining the power to understand where the needs for resilience to natural disasters lie and how to prioritise investment.",

Large-scale engineering systems such as power stations and aircraft are designed and constructed in this way, so how can we extend those methods to improving the resilience of a city? A further question is addressed to those working on simulation modelling techniques: How can we develop such models at the scale of entire cities?",

The local and central governments in Chile demonstrated very high competence following the 27 February 2010 tsunami in Chile both in re-opening schools within one month and by constructing some 30,0 0 0 temporary structures to house the displaced people within two months. Likewise the City of Christchurch, New Zealand, moved decisively in 2012 after a long series of primary and secondary earthquakes to completely re-build the central business district and to ban re-construction in residential areas that had experienced liquefaction of the ground.",
