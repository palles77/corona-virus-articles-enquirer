            "text": "Infectious bovine keratoconjunctivitis (IBK), also known as pinkeye, is one of the most common eye diseases in cattle. Several pathogens have been associated with IBK cases, however, Moraxella bovis, Moraxella bovoculi, Mycoplasma bovis, Mycoplasma bovoculi and bovine herpesvirus type 1 (BHV-1) are most frequently observed. A multiplex real-time PCR assay using two reactions was developed for the detection and differentiation of these five pathogens. Detection sensitivities of the multiplex assays were compared to singleplex reactions testing for the same targets. Correlation coefficients (R 2 ) of > 0.99, and PCR efficiencies between 92 and 106% were demonstrated in all singleplex and multiplex real-time PCR reactions. The limits of detection (LOD) of multiplex assays for Moraxella bovis, Moraxella bovoculi, Mycoplasma bovis, Mycoplasma bovoculi and BHV-1 were 19, 23, 25, 24 and 26 copies per reaction, respectively. No cross amplification was observed for specificity testing of 179 IBK positive clinical samples and 55 non-target clinical samples. Percentage of clinical samples positive for Mycoplasma bovoculi, Moraxella bovoculi, Moraxella bovis, BHV-1 and Mycoplasma bovis were 88.8% (159/179), 75.9% (136/179), 60.3% (108/179), 11.7% (21/179) and 10.0% (18/179), respectively. Moraxella bovis, Moraxella bovoculi and Mycoplasma bovoculi were more prevalent than Mycoplasma bovis and BHV-1 in IBK samples collected from animals in this study population. Our data indicates that the multiplex real-time PCR panel assay is highly sensitive and highly specific for the detection and differentiation of the five major pathogens associated with bovine pinkeye. Fig. 3. The prevalence of the five pathogens in IBK samples. Panel A: Prevalence of the five pathogens from the 179 bovine ocular swab samples that were subjected to multiplex real-time PCR testing. Panel B: Co-infections among the three most prevalent IBK pathogens in the 179 positive clinical samples: 95 (53.0%) samples were positive for both Moraxella bovis and Moraxella bovoculi; 100 (55.8%) samples were positive for both Moraxella bovis and Mycoplasma bovoculi; 129 (72.0%) samples were positive for both Moraxella bovoculi and Mycoplasma bovoculi and 93 (51.9%) samples were positive for Moraxella bovis, Moraxella bovoculi and Mycoplasma bovoculi.

            "text": "Infectious bovine keratoconjunctivitis (IBK), commonly known as 'pinkeye', is a highly contagious disease among bovine populations that can spread rapidly within a herd through direct contact, nasal or ocular discharges and via insect vectors when the integrity of the cornea is compromised O'Connor et al., 2012) . All cattle breeds are considered susceptible, although a lower incidence of IBK has been reported in Brahman cattle and cattle with more periocular pigmentation (Angelos, 2010) . IBK can produce ocular discharge, epiphora, mild conjunctivitis and corneal opacity, resulting in transitory blindness in most cases. However, IBK outbreaks may result in more severe clinical signs, including infection of the cornea that may lead to ulceration and perforation of the eye (Fernandez-Aguilar et al., 2017) . Most animals recover from infection, however permanent corneal scarring and vision loss have been associated with IBK. Considerable economic impact has been attributed to IBK, particularly due to reduced weight gain in calves at weaning and high costs associated with antibiotic treatment (Fernandez-Aguilar et al., 2017) . Calves with IBK usually weigh an average of 6.8-13.6 kg less than unaffected pasture mates at weaning (Funk et al., 2009) . Lower performance in postweaning cattle has been documented, including reduced average daily gain, 365th day weight, and final weight (Ali et al., 2012; O'Connor et al., 2011; Pugh Jr. et al., 1986) . Additionally, the drug cost for treatment, decreased market value due to corneal scarring, loss of value of show and breeding stock, and reduced milk production from dairy animals make this disease a significant economic and animal welfare consideration (O'Connor et al., 2012) .",

A major virulence factor of Moraxella bovis is a secreted cytotoxin shown to reproduce IBK lesions in calves (Angelos et al., 2007; Farias et al., 2015) . Moraxella bovoculi, a newly described species has been isolated and characterized in association with IBK in the absence of Moraxella bovis (Loy and Brodersen, 2014) . Mycoplasma spp. have also been frequently reported as causal agents of bovine IBK, with Mycoplasma bovoculi being most prevalent (Li et al., 2015; Pinho et al., 2012; Schnee et al., 2015) . One IBK outbreak was attributed to the synergistic action of Mycoplasma bovoculi and Mycoplasma bovis, following the possible predisposing effect of bovine respiratory disease (Levisohn et al., 2004) . Several studies have also suggested that bovine herpesvirus-1 (BHV-1) can also cause bovine IBK (Pugh Jr. et al., 1970) . It was experimentally demonstrated that BHV-1 serves as a predisposing factor for IBK after conjunctival inoculation of pure BHV-1 cultures caused conjunctivitis and blepharitis. Inoculation of BHV-1 cultures did not cause keratitis that can be produced by inoculation with pure cultures of Moraxella bovis (Pugh Jr. et al., 1970; Zbrun et al., 2011) .",

Standard curves were also used to determine the limit of detection (LOD) for each target. To increase the accuracy of each LOD, 2-fold serial dilutions were prepared from the last 10-fold dilution that still generated a positive signal, then tested in triplicate by real-time PCR. Final LOD was defined as the lowest concentration of each plasmid DNA that yielded a positive signal in all three replications.

Recently, another Moraxella species, Moraxella bovoculi, was isolated from calves with IBK (Angelos et al., 2007) . During a drug efficacy trial conducted in northern California, IBK-affected eyes of dairy and beef calves were cultured, and in most calves, hemolytic Gram-negative cocci but not Moraxella bovis were isolated. In a few cases, both Moraxella bovis and hemolytic Gramnegative cocci were isolated (Dueger et al., 2004) . The hemolytic Gramnegative cocci were subsequently characterized; biochemical and molecular data showed that these isolates were distinct from Moraxella bovis and Moraxella ovis and warranted their classification as a novel species named Moraxella bovoculi (Angelos et al., 2007) . The frequency of co-isolations may indicate that Moraxella bovoculi may be serving as an opportunistic agent or colonizing eyes in conjunction with Moraxella bovis, which has been shown to experimentally induce characteristic corneal ulcers in gnotobiotic calves (Rogers et al., 1987) . In this study, clinical sample data supports that Moraxella bovis and Moraxella bovoculi have a high prevalence, some are with very high concentrations, in these IBK samples (Zheng et al., 2019, submitted) . Mycoplasma spp. is also highly prevalent in the conjunctivae of cattle with IBK, with Mycoplasma bovoculi being the most commonly identified species (Schnee et al., 2015; Vilei et al., 2007) . Whether Mycoplasma bovoculi alone can cause clinical IBK, or act as a predisposing factor enhancing the effects of Mycoplasma spp. is currently unclear. Herds with a high prevalence of Mycoplasma bovoculi are more predisposed to acute IBK, possibly due to this pathogen facilitating enhanced infection with Moraxella spp. (Schnee et al., 2015) . An outbreak of IBK has even been attributed to the synergistic action of Mycoplasma bovoculi and Mycoplasma bovis, following the possible predisposing effects of bovine respiratory disease (Levisohn et al., 2004) . However, doubts have also been raised over the infective potential of Mycoplasma bovoculi to cause IBK in the absence of pathogenic Moraxella spp. In the past, classical culture methods were used for epidemiological investigations of Mycoplasma spp. infections (Vilei et al., 2007) . However, the unique biochemical properties of Mycoplasma spp. have made it difficult to culture the bacteria (Becker et al., 2012) , which may have impacted the prevalence data in these studies. PCR may circumvent some of these diagnostic challenges, since it offers a sensitive, rapid, robust and high-throughput application for detection. Our data suggests that Mycoplasma bovoculi has a higher prevalence than Mycoplasma bovis in IBK samples collected from this study population. Selected samples that were positive by the realtime PCR were sequence-confirmed to further support the PCR data.",

It was experimentally demonstrated that BHV-1 serves as a predisposing factor for IBK after conjunctival inoculation of pure BHV-1 cultures caused conjunctivitis and blepharitis. Inoculation of BHV-1 cultures did not cause keratitis which can be produced by inoculation with pure cultures of Moraxella bovis (Pugh Jr. et al., 1970; Zbrun et al., 2011) . High concentrations of BHV-1 have been shown to shed primarily by respiration and ocular secretions from infected animals, making it easily transmittable among animals (Zbrun et al., 2011) . However, the virus can also be transmitted indirectly through people and equipment (Pugh Jr. et al., 1970) . Our data show that animals with clinical IBK lesions had a low prevalence (10.0%) of BHV-1 infection.",
