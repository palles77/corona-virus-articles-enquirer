            "text": "This review discusses in vivo airway aspects of plasma exudation in relation to current views on epithelial permeability and epithelial regeneration in health and disease. Microvascularepithelial exudation of bulk plasma proteins characteristically occurs in asthmatic patients, being especially pronounced in those with severe and exacerbating asthma. Healthy human and guinea pig airways challenged by noninjurious histamineleukotriene-type autacoids also respond through prompt mucosal exudation of nonsieved plasma macromolecules. Contrary to current beliefs, epithelial permeability in the opposite direction (ie, absorption of inhaled molecules) has not been increased in patients with asthma and allergic rhinitis or in acutely exuding healthy airways. A slightly increased subepithelial hydrostatic pressure produces such unidirectional outward perviousness to macromolecules. Lack of increased absorption permeability in asthmatic patients can further be reconciled with occurrence of epithelial shedding, leaving small patches of denuded basement membrane. Counteracting escalating barrier breaks, plasma exudation promptly covers the denuded patches. Here it creates and sustains a biologically active barrier involving a neutrophil-rich, fibrin-fibronectin net. Furthermore, in the plasma-derived milieu, all epithelial cell types bordering the denuded patch dedifferentiate and migrate from all sides to cover the denuded basement membrane. However, this speedy epithelial regeneration can come at a cost. Guinea pig in vivo studies demonstrate that patches of epithelial denudation regeneration are exudation hot spots evoking asthma-like features, including recruitment/activation of granulocytes, proliferation of fibrocytes/smooth muscle cells, and basement membrane thickening. In conclusion, nonsieved plasma macromolecules can operate on the intact airway mucosa as potent components of first-line innate immunity responses. Exuded plasma also takes center stage in epithelial regeneration. When exaggerated, epithelial regeneration can contribute to the inception and development of asthma.

            "text": "Using challenges with noninjurious histamine-leukotrienetype autacoids, animal and human in vivo experiments have demonstrated how swift plasma exudation responses are evoked in tracheobronchial and nasal airways. Importantly, many autacoid ''inflammatory'' stimuli increase permeability in airway subepithelial microvessels but are without this effect in the pulmonary circulation. 20 Within a few minutes after exposure to histamine-type mediators (including leukotrienes, prostaglandins, platelet activating factor [PAF]-acether, and bradykinin), plasma protein indices are significantly increased in sampled airway surface liquids in guinea pig and human airways. [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] This response is dose dependent, reversible, and reproducible. In accordance with this, the exudative response to histamine has been used to assess the onset and duration of action of antihistamine drugs in human nasal airways. 30 Nonsieved and noninjurious passage of plasma macromolecules from the subepithelial microcirculation to the epithelial surface Passage of plasma proteins from the subepithelial microcirculation through mucosal tissue, including basement membranes, and then paracellularly across intact pseudostratified epithelial lining cells (Fig 1) 20,31-34 involves little sieving. An early demonstration of prompt challenge-induced microvascular-epithelial exudation in guinea pig tracheobronchial airways suggested that plasma macromolecules appeared on the mucosal surface independent of their charge and size. 29 The indiscriminate microvascular-epithelial passage of macromolecules explains why the process is called exudation rather than transudation, the latter name emphasizing fluid movement. [35] [36] [37] Thus different-sized plasma proteins have appeared on challenged but intact guinea pig and human airway mucosal surfaces in nearly the same concentration ratios as occur in circulating blood. 24, 29, 31, 38 Similar data have been reported in asthmatic patients by Out et al. 32 Accordingly, the large plasma protein a 2 -macroglobulin has emerged as a well-validated index of plasma exudation in nasal and bronchial airways in numerous human in vivo studies. 31, 32, [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] Further reflecting the nonsieved nature of plasma exudation responses, a tangled and sticky macromolecule, such as fibrinogen, is also used as an index of plasma exudation. 38, 45 Yet the ultrastructure of the epithelial lining has not been affected by transmission of bulk plasma. [46] [47] [48] [49] Plasma exudation without mucosal edema Studies in guinea pigs and rats indicate that extravasated plasma is promptly transmitted to the mucosal surface between and around epithelial cells 48 in the challenged tracheobronchial area. 24, 27, 47, 48, 50 Studies in mice are of limited value in this field because this species lacks a bronchial circulation. 51 There is no known type of mucosal challenge that results in selective extravasation without the further transmission of plasma across the epithelial lining. Furthermore, the plasma exudation response to autacoids has not been associated with an increase in lymphatic transport of plasma tracers. 27 Hence, in agreement with a lack of high-permeability edema, increased draining of proteins from the mucosal tissues has not occurred. The wet/dry weight ratio of the airway wall has not increased 29 nor has the subepithelial tissue been appreciably expanded to indicate presence of actual edema. 47, 52 A morphometric study in allergic rats also demonstrated that the airway-narrowing effect of allergen challenge reflected smooth muscle constriction without edema. 53 Prolonged stimulation of rat airways with allergens, such as house dust mite, has increased the number of subepithelial microvessels, although with little signs of mucosal edema. 51 Also, in human asthma there is some increased vascularity 51 but little evidence for bronchial mucosal edema. Even at sites at which the bronchial lumen is filled with mucus and exudate, the adjacent subepithelial mucosal tissue has exhibited no signs of edema. 54 The bronchoscopic in vivo view is known to give the impression of mucosal edema. However, it is unclear whether the appearance of a thickened mucosa represents edema or is a result of circular smooth muscle impacting on the mucosal tissue at different degrees of bronchoconstriction.",

Among the central issues discussed even then, Julius Cohnheim 36 emphasized that in mucosally lined hollow organs, FIG 1. The 3 major steps involved in airway microvascular-epithelial exudation of nonsieved plasma proteins. After local mucosal challenge, autacoids induce high-permeability gaps between endothelial cells in postcapillary venules (I). Venules belong to a profuse subepithelial microcirculation distinct from the pulmonary circulation. 20 Through these gaps, plasma macromolecules enter interstitial spaces, where an increased hydrostatic pressure (II) will affect basolateral aspects of epithelial cells. A pressure increase of only 5 cm of H 2 O is sufficient for inducing paraepithelial transmission of plasma macromolecules (III). Exudation occurs without prior edema formation, without sieving, and without compromising the epithelial barrier. In accord with this, histamine-challenged human airway mucosa in vivo exudes albumin (Alb) and a 2 -macroglobulin (a2M) at a concentration ratio (a2M/Alb) that is similar to that in circulating plasma. 31, 32 Furthermore, absorption of molecules deposited on the mucosal surface is not increased. Plasma extravasation (I) is an active endothelial cell event under physiologic and pharmacologic control. 33, 34 The ensuing epithelial passage (III) appears to be a hydrostatic pressure-driven hydraulic mechanism driven by the extravasated plasma itself (II). Microvascular-epithelial exudation of nonsieved plasma macromolecules is a prompt, reversible, repeatable, and usually short-lasting innate immune response. extravasated plasma and leukocytes had access to convenient elimination through epithelial transmission. However, in recent decades, the role of transepithelial exit in elimination of mucosal leukocytes has largely been ignored and severely eclipsed by a focus on the biology of cell apoptosis.",

            "text": "Cell death through apoptosis followed by engulfment has rapidly gained a hegemonic position as a mechanism responsible for cell elimination. Apoptosis has been particularly hailed as a mechanism causing resolution of cell-driven airway inflammation. This largely in vitro data-based view seems unfortunate, especially concerning a major granulocyte in asthmatic patients: the eosinophil. With apologies to apoptosis proponents, it needs underscoring that apoptotic eosinophils have not been demonstrated in human living blood-perfused airway tissues, not even at resolution phases. 65, 66 Also, the belief that successful treatment with anti-IL-5 biological agents reflects eosinophil apoptosis is not supported by compelling data. 67, 68 Yet eosinophils do die in mucosal tissue of asthmatic patients. However, their death in vivo is almost exclusively through primary cytolysis, which might cause rather than resolve inflammatory disease conditions. 66, 69 Concomitant with the increasing focus on molecular mechanisms of apoptosis, clinical and experimental in vivo data have continued to be publicized, indicating that elimination of these cells in asthmatic patients occurs through swift migration across the airway epithelium. Thus epithelial transmission has emerged as a noninjurious cell exit pathway for resolving mucosal tissue eosinophilia in asthmatic patients. 65 Also, other inflammatory cells appear to use this pathway at resolution of inflammation. 70 The plasticity of mucosal epithelial cell junctions obviously operates well at both paracellular migration of leukocytes and plasma exudation. The ability of epithelial cells to transiently yield and still maintain tightness is involved in both. However, modes of epithelial transmission differ and so do modes of extravasation. Leukocyte migration is driven by chemotactic signals separately regulating extravasation, tissue dwelling, and transepithelial passage. [71] [72] [73] By contrast, the fate of extravasated plasma seems less to dwell in the tissue than to move promptly to the mucosal surface. It is also of note that the endothelial gaps through which plasma macromolecules escape the circulation are not commonly used by leukocytes. 74, 75 Specificity of plasma exudation as a first-line innate immune response A kind of specificity lies in the strict location and brief duration of the plasma exudation response. There is a profuse subepithelial microcirculation carrying systemic blood in human nasal airways, as well as in the entire human tracheobronchial airway. 20 At any challenge site, postcapillary venules of this circulation can react through prompt formation of high-permeability endothelial gaps. This noninjurious response reflects an active process in endothelial cells that is under physiologic and pharmacologic control. 33,34,36, Gaps might open preferentially in the venular wall facing the epithelium. 74, 76 At a given challenge burden, the gaps will be open for only a limited time. For example, at a given concentration of histamine, the duration of plasma extravasation might not last more than about 10 to 20 minutes, even in the continued presence of this type of agent. 33,36, It is only if the challenge burden increases that the extravasation will be longer lasting. Challenge with allergen or PAF-acether can cause both an early-and a late-phase plasma extravasation response. 27, 50, 77 Reflecting the time course of extravasation, plasma proteins then emerge early and late on the mucosal surface at the site of challenge (Fig 1) .",

This transmission continued at the same increased rate as long as the pressure was increased. Importantly, the transepithelial movement of serosal macromolecules was not associated Box 1. Features that define the basic physiology of plasma exudation Direction and injury aspects of plasma exudation: d The outward paracellular epithelial transmission of macromolecules should be a unidirectional perviousness, allowing extravasated plasma proteins to appear locally on the challenged airway mucosal surface without being associated with any increase in inward permeability. d Although plasma exudation is an important response to epithelial denudation, its basic nature involves transmission of macromolecules across pseudostratified airway epithelial lining without compromising the ultrastructure or functional tightness of the epithelial lining cells as an absorption barrier. Epithelial transmission of bulk plasma preventing formation of subepithelial edema: d The epithelial exudation mechanism transmits mucosal challenge-induced, extravasated plasma macromolecules so swiftly that the increased vascular high permeability will not result in edema in the subepithelial area of interest. d Autacoids and drugs known to cause and inhibit, respectively, vascular permeability should not affect the epithelial transmission of extravasated plasma. Indeed, reducing the ability of the epithelial transmission of plasma would promote development of subepithelial edema. Time aspects and reproducibility: d Epithelial transmission of plasma macromolecules should occur promptly within a few minutes after their extravasation. With a short delay, it represents the time course of extravasation from the profuse network of subepithelial postcapillary venules. d Thus the epithelial component of the exudation mechanism sees to it that the mucosal challenges, which increase subepithelial venular leakage of plasma macromolecules, will automatically be followed by appearance of extravasated plasma proteins on the mucosal surface at the very site of challenge. d The plasma exudation response is fully reversible and repeatable.",

Using scanning electron microscopy, Serikov et al 49 further confirmed that plasma exudation occurred without affecting epithelial structural integrity. 48 Hence both in vitro and in vivo data support the notion that a slightly increased hydrostatic pressure is the gross operational mechanism involved in the basic plasma exudation response to noninjurious mucosal challenges.

[2] [3] [4] 94 Lack of increased permeability has been confirmed in studies involving more asthmatic patient groups and in which absorption from different lung zones has been examined. 5 Furthermore, in patients with perennial allergic rhinitis, in whom symptoms were induced by stopping treatment, absorption permeability was not increased. 8 Using dual-isotope techniques, determining concomitant mucociliary clearance and absorption of inhaled DTPA, Halpin et al 7,10 reported consistently reduced bronchial absorption in asthmatic patients compared with that in healthy subjects. Similarly, already in 1975, indications of reduced nasal airway absorption in patients with allergic rhinitis had been demonstrated. 9 In accord with this, significantly reduced absorption permeability was observed in patients with seasonal rhinitis along with plasma exudation and allergic symptoms. In these studies absorption tracer concentration, influence of mucociliary clearance, exposed airway surface area, and exposure time were controlled. 7, 10 A transient phase of increased absorption permeability can occur in patients with acute asthma. 94 It is possible that extensive denudation is involved as a causative factor in such cases (see below). Challenge with house dust mite, an allergen that stands out as particularly pathogenic, has also caused transiently increased airway absorption in vivo in mice. 95 These data might need confirmation in other species because mice lack a bronchial microcirculation. 51 Taken together, in vivo data suggest that increased permeability of inhaled molecules is not a basic feature of asthma and allergic rhinitis, although plasma exudation does occur in these patients.",

For example, it is not widely appreciated that after disease-like epithelial denudation in guinea pig tracheas, regeneration proteins, such as fibronectin and fibrinogen, emanate entirely from extravasated plasma. 135 At epithelial injury sites, a novel cell sheet consisting of flattened repair epithelium is thus created in a dynamically active, plasma-derived gel milieu. This is also an active defense milieu. For example, basal cell-like epithelial repair cells might need this protection to compensate for their sensitivity to microbial exposure. 140, 141 The in vivo exudation milieu seems more important than reflected in the current literature. 142 Events occurring in vivo after epithelial denudation, leaving an uninjured basement membrane. No bleeding occurs, but the basement membrane is not left naked. Plasma exudation produces and continuously supplies a gel-like cover involving a fibrin-fibronectin net. Also, leukocytes, especially neutrophils, are recruited and activated. Eosinophils already present in the airway are activated by primary cytolysis. The gel serves as a highly active provisional barrier and milieu for speedy epithelial regeneration. All epithelial cell types bordering the denuded patch, notably including both secretory and ciliated cells, promptly dedifferentiate into flattened regeneration cells. As in micrographs of bronchi of asthmatic patients, basal cells might not be readily distinguished from regeneration cells. Loosely linked, the latter migrate from all sides over the denuded patch at a speed of several micrometers per minute. When a new cell cover is complete, plasma exudation stops, the plasma-derived gel dislodges, and proliferation plus redifferentiation toward a normal epithelium begins in the previously denuded area. Epithelial regeneration in vivo alone induces recruitment and activation of granulocytes, hyperexudation, hypersecretion, proliferation not only of epithelial cells but also of fibrocyte/smooth muscle cells, and thickening of the epithelial reticular basement membrane.

Strikingly, this phenomenon is conspicuous, even in airways uniformly exposed to noxious agents, including allergens and dry air. 143, 146 Davis and Freed 147 thus carried out segmental dry air challenges in dogs to produce patchy bronchial denudation. Using a wedged bronchoscope, these authors further noted local accumulation of ''mucus'' and suggested that such material (actual components were not determined) could serve as a surrogate barrier. 147 Mosser et al 148 demonstrated that only a small fraction of epithelial cells became infected when exposed to rhinovirus. This observation is consistent with a patchy distribution of virus-induced epithelial injury.

At the loss of neighboring epithelium, all epithelial cell types bordering a denuded patch will promptly dedifferentiate into poorly differentiated flattened cells that cause epithelial regeneration (here called regeneration or regenerative cells). Already during dedifferentiation, cells that previously were fully differentiated into secretory and ciliated cells start to migrate. From all sides, such local regenerative cells move speedily in a tethered fashion over the denuded basement membrane (Fig 2) . 136 Thus a novel cell sheet consisting of flattened regenerated epithelium is created. The new epithelial cell barrier has reduced paracellular stretches available for passage of molecules, possibly explaining part of the reduced absorption demonstrated in patients with asthma and allergic rhinitis (see above). The speedy epithelial restitution requires an intact basement membrane. From its inception, it occurs in a dynamic, plasma-derived, gel-like milieu. 135 A maintained airway mucosal barrier against environmental challenges at epithelial denudation avoids ever-escalating disease conditions When shedding is intense and involves denudation, the situation is potentially the start of a spiral of extreme pathogenic consequences. If the barrier against hostile airspace factors is lost and not restored speedily, ever-increasing inflammation and harm to the airways would be expected to occur. The initial denudation challenge would make it so much easier for additional and more severe challenge-induced effects. In turn, more areas would be denuded and more airway tissues would be directly exposed to noxious mucosal surface material.

Especially in patients with severe asthma with extensive shedding, epithelial injury repair processes can contribute to the increased plasma exudation recorded in this condition. As discussed above, exaggerated plasma exudation alone might be of pathogenic importance in asthmatic patients because of its physical and biological effects. However, plasma exudation is not the only in vivo response to denudation (Fig 2) . The epithelial regeneration process in vivo has evoked a range of additional effects that disseminate into the neighborhood of hot spot denudation patches. Such effects include accumulation and activation of granulocytes, increased mucus secretion, and increased proliferation of epithelial and fibroblast/smooth muscle cells. 74, 136, 152, 153 Little support for involvement of epithelialmesenchymal units Dedifferentiated and migrating regeneration cells can be considered mesenchymal-like cells. However, they have not been seen to migrate across the plasma-covered basement membrane. Hence the idea of dissemination of epithelial-mesenchymal units into the lamina propria 154 is not supported. Instead, the dedifferentiated cells have proliferated and eventually undergone redifferentiation to a normal epithelium. 136 Pain et al 154 have also underscored that evidence for occurrence of epithelialmesenchymal units in asthmatic patients is lacking. Thus the increased numbers of fibrocytes in airways of asthmatic patients 155,156 might simply reflect proliferation of these cells occurring in response to signals emanating from inflammatory processes, 154 including signals from sites of epithelial denudation regeneration sites. 136 Exaggerated epithelial regeneration can contribute to the inflammatory and remodeling aspects of asthma Recruitment and activation of neutrophils are prominent in the regeneration exudation area. Repeated denudation regeneration processes further result in reticular basement membrane thickening. 152, 153 Eosinophil-derived proteins have been suggested to cause part of the epithelial shedding in asthmatic patients. 157 Free eosinophil granules, which are known to be produced by eosinophil cytolysis and release of toxic proteins, 69 are also intriguingly associated with epithelial cell loss in asthmatic patients. 158 In patients with severe asthma, eosinophil cytolysis-derived free granules in sputum are a prominent indicator of the disease state. 117 In guinea pig airways subjected to denudation, eosinophils already present in the area of interest are activated through primary cytolysis to release clusters of free eosinophil granules. 74 Hence epithelial regenerationinduced eosinophil cytolysis might be part of a pathogenic circle in asthmatic patients. 158 Exaggerated epithelial regeneration at both inception and severe stages of asthma Notably, the asthma-like effects evoked, along with epithelial regeneration, have been produced in vivo also in airways in which no inflammation existed before epithelial denudation. 136 Thus it is of interest that Creola bodies (clusters of desquamated epithelial cells) in aspirated sputum, independent of other factors, were reported to predict asthma development in wheezing infants. 159 Creola bodies in sputum have also been significantly associated with asthma exacerbations in adults and children. 11, 160 The occurrence of very large numbers of Creola bodies (up to 400 clusters in just 2 smears of sputum 11 ) agrees with a pronounced patchiness of epithelial damage in asthma (see above).",

As discussed above, there is a risk of everescalating disease conditions if epithelial regeneration is not a prompt and speedy process. A desired feature of future treatments would be to find means by which epithelial cell loss can be reduced rather than interfering with mechanisms associated with epithelial regeneration. This goal supports the importance of targeting airway epithelial cells in pharmacologic research on epithelial cytoprotection.",

The gel remains and is continuously supplied by fresh plasma until a new cover of regenerated epithelial cells is established. In a dynamic plasma-derived molecular milieu, ciliated and secretory epithelial cells surrounding denuded spots dedifferentiate into flattened and rapidly migrating regeneration cells. Thus airways with patchy denudation sites are not without barriers or might only transiently exhibit a reduced absorption barrier. Barrier restoration is potentially prompt, even in patients with severe conditions with extensive but patchy denudation of the epithelium.",

Plasma exudation produces and continuously supplies a gel-like cover involving a fibrin-fibronectin net. Also, leukocytes, especially neutrophils, are recruited and activated. Eosinophils already present in the airway are activated by primary cytolysis. The gel serves as a highly active provisional barrier and milieu for speedy epithelial regeneration. All epithelial cell types bordering the denuded patch, notably including both secretory and ciliated cells, promptly dedifferentiate into flattened regeneration cells. As in micrographs of bronchi of asthmatic patients, basal cells might not be readily distinguished from regeneration cells. Loosely linked, the latter migrate from all sides over the denuded patch at a speed of several micrometers per minute. When a new cell cover is complete, plasma exudation stops, the plasma-derived gel dislodges, and proliferation plus redifferentiation toward a normal epithelium begins in the previously denuded area. Epithelial regeneration in vivo alone induces recruitment and activation of granulocytes, hyperexudation, hypersecretion, proliferation not only of epithelial cells but also of fibrocyte/smooth muscle cells, and thickening of the epithelial reticular basement membrane. In patients with desquamating asthma, multiple patches of epithelial regeneration would contribute to known pathogenic inflammatory and remodeling effects.
