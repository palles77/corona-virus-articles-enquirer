The public health problems approached in this way, including acute and chronic diseases and environmental hazards, are diverse, necessitating the development of tools for the timely monitoring of disease trends. Furthermore, surveillance systems must be evaluated regularly, to ensure that they provide valuable information in an efficient manner [4, 5] .",

The World Health Organisation (WHO) has highlighted the importance of improving national epidemic surveillance capacities [6, 7] . Recently developed innovative tools, such as mobile telephone technology and electronic systems, have facilitated the improvement of surveillance systems, by reducing data processing [8] . However, these systems are mostly implemented in highincome countries [9] , as most developing countries are faced with logistic and budgetary constraints, resulting in low-quality surveillance systems based on pen-and-paper methods. In many cases, these low-tech systems provide health institutions with inadequate support, resulting in frequent \"health crises\" [10] . Moreover, the healthcare infrastructure, laboratory diagnostic capacity, skills and number of physicians in these countries are generally insufficient to deal with emerging diseases likely to cause epidemics. Consequently, delays in raising the alarm often limit the possibility of an effective early response to new, emerging public health problems.",

In addition, the 2005 International Health Regulations stressed the importance of commitment to the goal of global security and asked all member states to establish and implement effective surveillance and response systems, making it possible to detect and contain public health threats of national and international importance. As a result, the government of Madagascar, in partnership with the Institut Pasteur de Madagascar, established 13 fever sentinel sites in 2007, expanding the network to 34 sites by 2011, to improve the timely detection and management of febrile disease outbreaks. Two key attributes of the sentinel surveillance system are monitored continuously: timeliness and data quality. This system was designed to identify outbreaks for which public health interventions may be required early enough for such interventions to be effective. We report here the indicators, for 2007 to 2011, of the syndromic sentinel surveillance network, presenting spatiotemporal trends, alert detection capability and evaluations of the process on the basis of timeliness and quality data.",

Briefly, it includes primary healthcare centres (sentinel sites) from across the country ( Figure  1 ) and is managed by a national steering committee. The network was expanded from 13 influenza-like illness (ILI) sentinel sites in 2007 to 34 sentinel sites in 2011, with the aim of improving geographic coverage and representativeness of the country as a whole (4 sites are located in Antananarivo) ( Figure 1 ). The sentinel surveillance system makes use of syndromic indicators to monitor the occurrence of selected diseases of importance for the country. The main criterion for the inclusion of cases or patients is fever or diarrhoea. For patients with fever, additional screening criteria (based on syndromic case definitions) are used to identify specific syndromes: malaria, ILI, dengue-like syndromes. Standard WHO case definitions are used, to ensure comparability [11, 12] . Malaria diagnosis requires biologic confirmation with a positive rapid diagnostic test in patients with fever syndromes.",

We have already highlighted the weaknesses of the routine disease surveillance system in Madagascar, which is based on passive collection and limited capacities for diagnosis outside the capital city. None of the early-warning signs was identified by routine surveillance. Routine surveillance is useful for monitoring long-term programmes, but inappropriate for the timely detection of aberrant patterns. By contrast, syndrome-based near-real time surveillance can detect unusual events more rapidly [15] [16] [17] [18] . This timeliness is a key element of the surveillance system and should be evaluated periodically [19] .",

The sentinel system in Madagascar was clearly simple and rapid, but we found that some process indicators tended to decline over time, due to high staff turnover. The decrease in the number of fever forms received annually, between 2007 and 2011, is one of the weaknesses of this system. The increase in the number of sentinel sites increased the workload of central staff managing the different activities. A lack of co-ordination hindered the training of new healthcare workers entering the network, and changes in practices were discovered only during supervision in the field. Challenges resulting from high staff turnover have also been identified in other countries [6, 8] . The indicators used for the continuous assessment of the sentinel network in Madagascar are useful for a rapid, basic internal evaluation, but an external evaluation approach is also required, using CDC guidelines [21] , for example, and including economic indicators as an integral part of the surveillance evaluation process [4] .",

The Madagascan network has been supported by funding from various sources over the years, focusing on different health topics. Self-sustainability is another challenge, as already described [8] , and has already been identified as a weakness of this network. We therefore need to focus on the first steps of surveillance system implementation and all system changes. Initial funds targeted arbovirosis, because of the spread of Chikungunya epidemics in Indian Ocean countries in 2006, and influenza, due to the threat posed by avian flu. However, the steering committee subsequently decided to include other diseases associated with febrile syndromes. This policy has been tremendously successful, making it possible for the network to provide epidemiological information not only about arboviruses, but also about malaria and influenza, throughout the country. In 2008, the first human case of Rift Valley fever was detected, by this network, at Taolognaro (in the south of the country), a site used for both syndromic and biological surveillance. For malaria, the network has monitored the shift from control to elimination following the strengthening of malaria prevention and control measures. The usefulness of sentinel networks for influenza detection is well documented and was assessed in the last pandemic period in 2009 [15] . Funding for work on these diseases has improved geographical coverage and made it possible to extend the network over the last five years. This network has become an additional tool for public health decision-making. The syndromic surveillance has been shown to be an effective approach to surveillance and, thanks to the availability of large mobile phone networks throughout Madagascar, the cost of real-time data transmission is low. This surveillance method may also facilitate compliance with the revised International Health Regulations for low-income countries and the aim of the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN) [22] .",

Indeed, five years after the establishment of this network, large amounts of data are already available and data analysis methods have identified trends for ILI, malaria and dengue-like syndromes in areas of Madagascar with different climates.
