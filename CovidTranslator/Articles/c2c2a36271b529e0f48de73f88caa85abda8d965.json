The history of passive immunization with antibodies to prevent or treat infectious diseases is a story of different eras. There was an extraordinary era of discovery and clinical implementation before the chemical nature of antibodies was even known. This empirical process provided the resources and reagents used to describe and characterize humoral immunity, better define the chemical properties and structure of antibodies, and extend the clinical use of immunoglobulin products to treat or prevent multiple viral and bacterial diseases over the ensuing several decades. The next distinct era came with the discovery of processes to produce monoclonal antibodies (mAb), and development of more specific therapies. Interestingly, mAb technology resulted in many products to treat autoimmune and allergic diseases, but only one common infectious disease, respiratory syncytial virus, and only in a restricted population of highrisk infants.",

He and Shibasaburo Kitasato showed that serum from rabbits immunized with tetanus toxin could prevent tetanus in rabbits. The same phenomenon was rapidly demonstrated for diphtheria toxin (1) . This led to the term antitoxin and probably motivated the use of the term \"antik\u00f6rper\" translated \"antibody\" by Paul Erlich in a 1891 paper (2) . Erlich's work demonstrating that increasing doses of bacterial toxins could provide immunity against lethal doses of toxin was the basis for the serum therapy findings. His work also led to the concepts of active and passive immunization, and to his Nobel Prize in 1908 awarded for establishing the field of humoral immunity. It is fitting to highlight Erlich's contribution to the initial conception of passive immunization in 2015, the 100 year anniversary of his death.",

Interestingly, other companies and organizations like Lederle (a successful pharmaceutical company that became part of Wyeth, then Pfizer) began in New York and Butantan (a state-owned and operated organization that still produces antivenoms, antitoxins, and vaccines in Sao Paulo, Brazil) originated on horse farms primarily for the purpose of making antiserum for bacterial toxins.",

            "text": "Immune animal sera for treatment of diseases in the late 1800's was followed by an era of serum therapy for both viral and bacterial diseases. In fact, during the 1918 influenza pandemic, serum from recovered patients was used to successfully treat acutely ill patients (4) . The role of serum therapy was expanded to many infections beyond influenza during the first half of the 20 th century with clinical benefit demonstrated for other viral diseases like measles (5) and polio (6) , and for invasive bacterial infections including pneumococcus, Haemophilus influenza B, and meningococcus (7, 8) . These clinical programs in turn contributed to the basic knowledge of antibodies, which were then known to have specific antitoxin activity, and were associated with precipitins and agglutinins, but the underlying chemistry of antibodies was still not understood. This was addressed by the work of Michael Heidelberger and Oswald Avery in the 1920's when it was common practice to treat pneumococcal pneumonia with type-specific antiserum derived from horses. First, using the specific antiserum as a reagent they showed that the antigen target was a carbohydrate that comprised the capsule of the pneumococcus (9). This was ground-breaking in itself, because it was assumed that all \"antigens\" were proteins. Using a relatively purified antibodycontaining fraction from serum, and the new knowledge that the pneumococcal antigen was carbohydrate, they were able to prove that antibodies were protein (10). Heidelberger went on to find ways to quantify the precipitin and agglutinin reactions providing the basis for modern serological assays (11) .",

However, the field remained active for infections not treated with antibiotics, and was greatly advanced by Dr. Edwin Cohn's discovery of purified antibodies through ethanol fractionation of plasma (12) . Many effective polyclonal antibody products were developed using this process that targeted either prevention of viral infections or treatment of bacterial toxin related diseases (Table 1 ). These products include: Diphtheria Immune Globulin, Tetanus Immune Globulin, Immune Serum Globulin, Rabies Immune Globulin, Hepatitis B Immune Globulin, Varicella Zoster Immune Globulin, CMV Globulin, and Botulinum Immune Globulin. The technology of ethanol fractionation of plasma resulted in successful product supply for these relatively small markets, however was ultimately limiting for the first large-scale infectious disease application.",

Two years later with product demand quickly outstripping plasma availability, the humanized monoclonal antibody palivizumab (Synagis \u00ae ) was licensed. Beyond the supply advantage, the monoclonal antibody technology offered increased consistency of the biologic, a reduced risk of infections due to blood borne pathogens and diminished number of adverse events during administration. Palivizumab was also 50-fold more potent than the polyclonal product resulting in reduced volume of administration and intramuscular use.

Although palivizumab was one of the first licensed monoclonal antibodies, only two of the 30 therapeutic monoclonal antibodies are for infectious disease indications. The success of alternative methods to combat infectious disease such as cost effective vaccines and antiviral small molecules partially explain the limited number of products. Although resistance of bacteria to antibiotics looms as a major public health threat, monoclonal antibodies have a limited success story in treating bacterial disease. Thus the current active areas of monoclonal development have focused on viral diseases without available vaccines (e.g. HIV, Ebola, SARS, MERS), viral diseases with limited effective anti-viral drugs (e.g. influenza, rabies), and bacterial toxin-mediated diseases (e.g. Anthrax, C. difficile colitis). The monoclonal antibody products currently licensed or progressing towards late stage development for infectious disease are listed in Table 2 . We have not included programs that are inactive or have not yet advanced to Phase 2 studies. As the potential for antibodies to prevent and treat HIV are discussed in accompanying articles, we will comment here on the other areas of active development.",

For example, hepatitis immune globulin can protect against hepatitis B even when given after exposure. Rabies is another example where post-exposure treatment with immunoglobulin is effective, and also illustrates the importance of using monoclonal antibody technology to replace polyclonal products that are expensive, in limited supply, and often less potent. In 2014, there are still over 60,000 deaths due to rabies worldwide with over half of the victims being children. Although vaccine administration combined with Human Rabies Immune Globulin (HRIG) is 100% effective in prevention of rabies following exposure, the expense of polyclonal antibody limits its use. There are two products in development that could remedy this situation; CL184 consists of two monoclonal antibodies combined and is in a Phase 2 trial, SII-RMab consists of a single human monoclonal antibody and has just completed enrollment in the pivotal trial in India.",

A recent example is the licensure of monoclonal antibody directed to anthrax toxin, raxibacumab, licensed in 2012 for treatment of inhalation anthrax. Of note, this was the first biologic to be licensed by FDA according to the animal rule in contrast to establishing efficacy in clinical field trials. The stability of monoclonal antibody for long-term storage and the immediacy of neutralization make this product uniquely suitable for this indication. C. difficile colitis is another example of a bacterial toxin mediated disease with an active monoclonal product in late stage development. MK-3415A consists of two antibodies, one directed to toxin A and one directed to toxin B. This product is now in Phase 3 studies to evaluate efficacy in prevention of recurrent disease. It is interesting to consider that this passively administered monoclonal antibody therapeutic trial has implications for vaccine development. Efficacy of passively administered antibody would validate antigen selection and guide the atomic level design of candidate vaccines. Furthermore, such trials could establish specific biomarkers of protection for vaccine studies utilizing the efficacious monoclonal antibodies.

Another example is the treatment of the Argentine hemorrhagic fever, caused by an arenavirus (Junin virus), in which patients were shown to benefit from immune serum administered within one week after symptoms began (16) (17) (18) . The basis for the therapeutic effect was shown to be associated with neutralizing activity (NT), which did not correlate well with the other methods of antibody quantification, complement fixation or immunofluorescence (19) . NT antibody was able to effectively control the viremia and a NT unit needed per kg of patient body weight was established for treatment protocols (17) . Interestingly, there is a late neurological syndrome in about 10% of patients treated with immune serum that does not occur in untreated survivors (17) . The syndrome begins several weeks after apparent resolution of the acute infection and includes fever and symptoms of cerebellar and cranial nerve damage. The pathogenesis is not well understood, but presumably involves either the failing to clear virus from the CNS or facilitating the transport of virus into the CNS.",

            "text": "As noted by the content of this issue, we are in the midst of another history-making era in the field of passive immunization. This is in large part due to the development of technologies to rapidly isolate human monoclonal antibodies. The publication by Milstein and K\u00f6hler describing the method for producing murine monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) by immortalizing B cells as hybridomas (20) was a landmark paper and led to their Nobel Prize in 1984. After that a variety of approaches to produce human monoclonal antibodies evolved (21) (22) (23) (24) (25) (26) (27) , but in 2003 a transformative technology was reported in which the heavy and light chain immunoglobulin (Ig) genes were amplified from single human B cells and cloned into expression vectors (28). In 2008 a more high throughput version of this approach was reported (29). This advance along with innovations in cell sorting and cloning has allowed the discovery of new human mAbs to occur on a large scale. This has been particularly valuable to study infectious diseases for which new interventions were needed, as described in this issue. The availability of multiple human antibodies has opened up new avenues for understanding disease pathogenesis and vaccine-induced immunity. When considered in the context of new sequencing technologies and structure-guided atomic level design, the new harvest of human mAbs is not only providing new products with therapeutic potential, but has made new investigations possible including: 1) defining the antigenic topography of glycoprotein ectodomains, and sites of neutralization sensitivity, 2) isolation of antibodies with particular functional properties, and using those sequences to characterize the ontogeny of antibody responses after encountering an immunogen, 3) molecular engineering of antibodies to improve potency, specificity, or half-life, and 4) understanding the role of posttranslational modifications of antibodies.",
