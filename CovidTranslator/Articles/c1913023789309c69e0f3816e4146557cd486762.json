Embryo cryopreservation has become a routinely successful technology for many species and efforts to develop usable cryobanks for many target species am ongoing. Recommended regulations for the movement of embryos from nontraditional (i.e. other than domestic livestock) species are nonexistent.

At the National Institutes of Health (NIH), many invaluable animal models of disease and normal biological processes are maintained in the Animal Genetic Resource (NIHAGR) for each of these species. As a stock center for laboratory animals, the NIHAGR routinely provides breeding nuclei to the biomedical research community and an embryo bank was established as an economical means to indefinitely preserve these rodent and rabbit genotypes. Embryo cryopreservation offers benefits for genotype management such as safeguarding against loss from disease, reproductive failure, natural catastrophe or genetic contamination. In the future, the cryobank will help minimize changes due to genetic drift by providing a resource from which defined genotypes can be periodically rederived. This will allow for restandardization of foundation breeding colonies. Also, rather than shipping postnatal animals, cryopreserved embryos would offer a simpler, more humane and easier method to transport requested models worldwide. An equally important impact of embryo biotechnologies would be the prevention of vertical transmission of some diseases.",

The spread of disease is of major concern (41) when transporting wildlife, especially when the point of origin harbors pathogens such as rinderpest, foot-and-mouth disease and theileriosis (19) . Incidents of disease transmissions by translocated wildlife were recently summarized (19.41) . Futthermore, the zoological community identitled high priority diseases at an International Conference on Implications of Infectious Disease for Captive Propagation and Reintroduction of Threatened Species (6). The legal implications of managing captive breeding and reintroduction programs for endangered species also were addressed (7). In attempting to move animals, health and welfare issues as well as controls imposed by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species must be considered. Many potential hazards of moving live animals can be attenuated or eliminated by shipping gametes or embryos. It is generally believed that the potential for disease transmission via embryo transfer is much less than via semen (i.e., AI) or by the actual movement of potentirdly diseased animals (29.30). Washing procedures have been shown to remove many pathogens common to domestic and wildlife species from zona-intact livestock embryos. Such procedures also may prove effective for wildlife embryos.",

Strict sanitary procedures and accurate record keeping by a qualified team supervised by an accredited veterinary official are required. Categorization of wildlife diseases, unlike those of livestock, has not been attempted due to an absence of basic research but, because of an existing Permanent Post Entry Quarantine (PPEQ) policy for international live animal shipments such categorizations may not be necessary. A few US zoological larks, selected on a regional basis, havebeen granted PPEQ status. Before arriving at these zoos, animals are quarantined pre-and post-shipment for disease screening and health status certification. These animals am maintained perman&tly on the PPEQ zoo premises but Fl generation offspring (26 months old) may be moved after appropriate disease testing. Routine preventative clinical and disease screenings are performed on the PPEQ animals.
