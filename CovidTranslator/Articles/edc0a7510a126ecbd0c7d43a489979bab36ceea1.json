Accordingly, the concept of public health and the capacity to respond to public health emergencies has improved in the public health system, but there also are greater difficulties than ever before [1] .

Several studies have also investigated the scientific production of China in various biomedical fields [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] ; however, there have been no studies evaluating the quantity and quality of Chinese research production in public health.

Subsequently, we analyzed the Countries/Territories of all the papers from each of the 3 regions using the \"Combine Search History\" and \"Refine Results\" functions on \"Web of Science\". Publication types were limited to Article, Review, Editorial, and Letter. Then, we manually selected the downloaded papers with the first author affiliation located in ML, HK, and TW with the aforementioned publication types.

ML exceeded both HK and TW in the annual number of papers from 2005 onward, showing a total growth of 414% over the 10 years, from 44 to 226. However, this is to be expected, given the very large population of ML compared to HK and TW. On a \"per capita\" (per total number of residents) basis, ML is significantly underperforming compared to HK and TW. Moreover, the large increase in ML was attributed to the ML-based journal BES, because 40.8% of ML's public health papers were published in BES. This reveals another interesting issue -more ML medical journals in the English language enter the ISI database [11] , which causes a larger number of high-quality papers published from ML to be indexed by the ISI database, as reported in the field of gastroenterology by Gao et al [8] . Paraje et al. [12] revealed that China's increasing proportion of worldwide outputs addressing health topics can be attributed to specific changes in research policies. At least 1 paper indexed in SCIE is required for most academic promotions in ML China, and each paper is financially rewarded by means of cash or financial support. In addition, the rapid and steady economic growth in China promotes scientific research development.",

TW had the highest scores in the average IF (2.588), total times cited (7603), and times cited per paper (8.84). In contrast, ML showed the lowest average IF (1.568) and times cited per paper (5.90). Excluding the publications in BES, the papers from ML showed higher average IF and average times cited per paper. In the top 10 highest impact factor public health journals, TW published 161 papers, accounting for 50% of the total from the 3 regions. Among the public health journals most often published in by authors from each region, HK showed the highest total IF. All these data indicate that although the papers from ML increased in number, those papers tended to appear in journals with lower IF and they were less frequently cited than papers from TW and HK. As the number of publications and citations are increasing worldwide, IF is expected to generally increase; consequently, it is not surprising to see the increased IF in the public health field in China. However, the papers from ML showed lower average IF compared with those from HK and TW, especially when BES was included in the analysis, which implies that BES articles are not often cited. Including publications from this journal in the statistics for ML could artificially lower the average number of times an article is cited and the average IF. Therefore, to increase the average IF of articles from ML, perhaps the best approach is to aim to publish in international journals that are more likely to be cited. Similarly, Chen et al. [13] revealed that research papers from TW with international collaboration usually appeared in journals with higher impact factors than those without international collaboration.",

TW and HK have been at the forefront of scientific and medical research for many years, whereas public health in ML has always been a weaker sector because of the large population and the relatively lower economic development. By investing 4.7% of the gross domestic product (GDP) in health care, HK developed health statistics comparable to those in leading Western nations, whereas ML's 3.6% of GDP expenditure on health produced health statistics similar to those found in most developing countries [14] . Compared with HK, the public health challenges in ML are massive, especially in terms of health inequalities between developed urban areas and less developed rural areas [15] . In view of such disparities, it can be expected that the research output from ML might be lagged behind HK, as research output requires further necessary financial funding and proper human resources. TW commenced early to emphasize the importance of preventive health, and has reaped many successes both in preventive health care and chronic disease control [16] . While all of the 3 regions face problems associated with their economic development and unique environment, ML faces the same challenge on a greater scale, compounded by various other problems, including poor capacity to respond to public health emergencies, severe inequality of health care services, and lagging development of public health information systems [4] .",

Meanwhile, although ML exceeded TW and HK in the research output in gastroenterology and cardiology, ML kept the lower average IF score compared with HK and TW [6, 8] . It is the same case in the public health publications in the present study, which implies that enthusiasm for scientific research in ML has grown in recent years, but there is room for improving researchers' skills in study design, writing and publishing, so as to promote more outstanding research output, in comparison with the conditions in HK and TW.",
