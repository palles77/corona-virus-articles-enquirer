The method was based on the oxidation of chrysin and baicalein by acidic KMnO 4 in the presence of formaldehyde to produce strong CL emission.

Since the appearance of the highly sensitive photomultiplier tube in the 1950s, CL has been known as a powerful and important analytical technique. Some advantages of CL over spectrophotometry and fluorescence, such as higher sensitivity, lower detection limits and wider linear ranges, can be achieved with simpler instrument (no excitation light source and no spectroscope). In the last 20 years, the CL phenomenon in liquid phase has been widely applied in pharmaceutical, biomedical, environmental and food analysis [1, 2] . One main direction of the current research in CL is to discover new CL reactions. Research on new CL reactions is very important since it opens new horizons for the technique. It is well known that the CL emission is frequently accompanied by an oxidation-reduction reaction involving large free energy change (130-340 kJ/mol).

In this way, quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) provides a promising method for the estimation of the compounds' behavior based on the descriptors derived solely from the molecular structure to fit experimental data [4] [5] [6] . The advantage of this approach lies in the fact that it requires only the knowledge of chemical structure and is not dependent on the experiment properties. In QSPR studies, molecular connectivity is a topological method capable of describing the structure of a molecular by means of numbers named indices. In 2001, Calatayud and his co-workers [7] firstly applied molecular connectivity calculation to predict the direct CL behavior of substances in liquid phase, and later they applied the CL discriminant function to theoretically predict the CL behavior of phenols and polyphenols [8] , ergot alkaloids [9] and pesticides [10] . In our recently published work [11] , the new discriminant function of direct CL was suggested with cosine coefficient as a descriptor, and the discriminant function was applied to predicting the direct CL behavior of 101 compounds with a success of 95.05%.",

Chrysin and baicalein exist ubiquitously in herbal medicines. For example, chrysin and baicalein are the main active components of Oroxylum indicum [12] , which is one herbal medicine commonly used in China and other East Asian countries, and has been officially listed in the Chinese Pharmacopoeia for a long time [13] . Chrysin possesses the potent anti-inflammation, anti-oxidation properties and cancer-preventative effects [14] , and it is able to simulate nitric oxide released from endothelial cells, leading to vascular cGMP accumulation and subsequent endothelium dependent vascular relaxation. Baicalein has function to restrain the bacteria and reduce the permeability of the capillary vessel and the inflammation, so it is useful for cleaning the uterus and decreasing the degree of advanced menstruation, discharge and menostaxis, and it has anti-HIV [15] , anti-tumor [16] and anti-SARS coronavirus effects [17] . Quantitative analysis of chrysin and baicalein with known therapeutic activity could provide useful information for the quality evaluation of the herbal medicines. There are several reported methods for the determination of chrysin and baicalein. The main methods are HPLC with mass spectrometric detection [18] or ultraviolet detection [19] .",

PTFE tubing (0.8 mm i.d.) was used as connection material in the flow system. The flow cell is a flat spiral-coiled colorless glass tube (i.d. 1.0 mm; total diameter of the flow cell, 3 cm, without gaps between loops) and placed close to the window of the photomultiplier tuber (PMT). A sample solution (150 l) was injected by a six-way valve into the carrier stream (water), and then merged with the stream of acidic KMnO 4 just prior to reaching a flow cell. The CL signal produced in the flow cell was collected with a CR-105 PMT (Hamamatsu, Tokyo, operated at \u2212800 V) of the IFFL-D Chemiluminescence Analyzer (Xi'an Ruike Electronic Science Tech. Co.

Data acquisition and treatment were performed with IFFL-D software running under Windows 2000. The concentration of analyte was quantified by the peak height of the CL intensity.",

Preliminary experiment showed that only in strong acidic media potassium permanganate could oxidize baicalein to produce CL emission. The effect of the type of acid was investigated by using sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid and polyphosphate acid as the reaction media. The experimental results (Table 3) showed that baicalein gave the strongest CL signal in hydrochloric acid. For 1 mol l \u22121 HCl and 1 mol l \u22121 H 2 SO 4 , the concentration of H + is almost same because the Ka 2 of H 2 SO 4 is rather small (Ka 2 = 0.01), but the CL signal in 1 mol l \u22121 HCl was higher than it in 1 mol l \u22121 H 2 SO 4 . In order to explain this phenomenon, we added the 1 mol l \u22121 KCl into 1 mol l \u22121 H 2 SO 4 . It was found that the CL signal in 1 mol l \u22121 KCl-1 mol l \u22121 H 2 SO 4 was higher than it in 1 mol l \u22121 H 2 SO 4 . On the other hand, a small amount of Mn 2+ (less than 4 \u00d7 10 \u22125 mol l \u22121 ) was directly added into 1 mol l \u22121 H 2 SO 4 , and the CL signal was enhanced. So, the reason was that in HCl media, KMnO 4 could oxidize Cl \u2212 to produce Mn 2+ , and Mn 2+ could enhance the CL emission of KMnO 4 system [25] .",

It was found that the mixing tube length of the two solutions also influenced the CL intensity. Fig. 4 showed the effect of mixing tube length on CL intensity. In the flow system (Fig. 2) , the reaction degree of HCl and KMnO 4 depended on the length of mixing tube. The CL intensity increased with increasing the mixing tube length in the range of 5-78 cm, probably due to producing more Mn 2+ (Mn 2+ could enhance the CL emission of KMnO 4 system [25] ); when the length of mixing tube was more than 78 cm, the CL intensity decreased probably because of greatly decreasing KMnO 4 concentration. So, 78 cm mixing tube of HCl and KMnO 4 was used in this flow system at 4.0 ml min \u22121 flow rate (per tube).",

The calibration graph of emission intensity (I, mV) versus baicalein concentration was linear in the range 1 \u00d7 10 \u22126 -7 \u00d7 10 \u22125 mol l \u22121 with the detection limit of 4 \u00d7 10 \u22127 mol l \u22121 , and the regression equation was I = 425 + 94.1C (C: baicalein concentration, mol l \u22121 ) with a correlation coefficient of 0.9991(n = 7). The relative standard deviation for 11 measurements of chrysin and baicalein were 4.5% and 3.0%, respectively. Two typical recording outputs of the proposed CL system for measurements of different concentrations of chrysin and baicalein are shown in Figs. 5 and 6. A complete analysis, including sampling and washing, could be performed in 1 min. ",

So, we proposed a new model to discover new CL analytical system: first, to theoretical predict the CL behavior, and the second, to suggest analytical system. Compare with the \"trail-and-error\" screening model for new CL system, the new model is easily and timesaving. On the other hand, this work applied the sensitive and simple CL method for determination of chrysin and baicalein, and the CL system will be quite promising for post column detector of HPLC and capillary electrophoresis for the simultaneous determination of chrysin and baicalein in herbal medicines.",
