            "text": "Until now, electrophoresis has remained the primary source of separation in microfluidic chip. Most of the papers published on separation in microfluidics are electrophoresis-based, rather than chromatography. Electrophoresis can be performed more directly and conveniently in a microfluidic chip. First, the driving force of electrophoresis is the electric field, which can be applied via the contact of electrodes with the running buffers, and without high pressure needed in chromatography. Second, in some electrophoresis modes, such as capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE), micelle electrokinetic chromatography (MEKC) and isoelectric focusing (IEF), the separation efficiency is mostly determined by the amount of the voltage applied. Therefore, in the microchip format, electrophoresis can still be performed with high efficiency under a higher electric field in a much shorter channel, while the efficiency of chromatography increases with column length. Third, buffers only or buffers with specially designed additives are enough for electrophoretic separation instead of the stationary phase of beads or monolithic material in chromatography. Now there are various additives in running buffers to meet different requirements in various separation modes, such as, water soluble polymers in capillary gel electrophoresis (CGE), ampholytes in IEF, and surfactants in MEKC. Generally, these all simplify the operation of MCE, lower the cost of each chip, and contribute to its miniaturization and portability. While chromatography is generally not performed because (1) glass and plastics cannot withstand the pressures that would be needed, (2) it is difficult to pack the channels without voids, (3) there are mass transfer problems in the corners of the channels, and (4) voids cause unacceptable band broadening.",

Buffers can be added and mixed simultaneously or one by one at any scheduled time and location. Other techniques developed in microfluidic chip also benefit electrophoresis separation at nearly every step. Microheaters and sensors are useful for sample reaction and separation. Pneumatic valves allow the flexible segregation and collection of analytes interested, and pumps can drive and mix samples through different regions in microchip [3, 4] .

The electric fields from separation channel to sample waste channel effectuate a virtual valve, which allows the volume of the sample plug to be accurately controlled and is time independent, enabling a constant volume to be injected. The inhibited electric valve can also completely avoid electric leakage during electrophoresis. Electric field distribution on microchip valve and concentration focusing from sample stacking were also studied. In order to increase the sample injection frequency, two tee intersections were added in close proximity of cross point. The tee intersection in the sample channel preserved the sample near to cross point under \"pullback\" conditions, therefore, allowing faster loading next time. Tee intersection in separation channel allowed unidirectional transport enabling loading of subsequent injections during an analysis. Injection at 5 Hz was demonstrated successfully [11] . In order to finely tune the sample plug in pinched injection, double-cross injector was fabricated, which employed electrokinetic focusing on deliver sample plugs of variable volume [12] . Electrokinetic doublefocusing injection technique for microchip electrophoresis was also presented [13] .",

The hydrolysis of fluorescein diphosphate by alkaline phosphatase was monitored in time [26] . In 2005, utilizing an integrated diaphragm pump on a hybrid PDMS-glass microchip, Landers and co-workers developed a pressure injection for electrophoretic analysis of submicroliter samples [27] , in which, as little as 500 nL sample could be injected correctly. This injection system had been integrated into a microchip associated with chip-DNA extraction and chip-PCR for rapid detection of gene of bacteria, virus and human beings [28] . Martin and coworkers incorporated a reduced-volume pneumatic valve that actuated to allow analyte from a continuously flowing sampling channel to be injected into a separation channel for electrophoresis, and a pushback channel was added to flush away stagnant sample associated with the injector dead volume [29] . After evacuating air dissolved in PDMS, loading of a sieving polymer solution and injection of a sample solution could be carried out autonomously [30, 31] .",

As to chip CGE of protein and DNA in the moderate electric field, D is very small, so its t D /t t is also larger than 1.

Mathies and co-workers created tapered turns by narrowing the separation channel width before the start of a turn and widening the channel after the turn was complete [42] . Examining the separation of DNA sizing ladder, they carefully explored the radius of curvature of the turn, the length over which the channel is tapered, and the degree of tapering. They found that the case of the smallest radius of curvature (250 m), the shortest tapering length (55 m), and the largest tapering ratio (4:1) generated the highest separation resolution, which was >95% of that from a straight separation channel. They thought that smallest radius of curvature and shortest tapering length could decrease negative effect of DNA biased reptation in taped channel to an upmost extent, and the largest tapering ratio could control the pure turn geometry on peak dispersion. Taped turn and another similar turn geometry of constrained turn [43] have become two popular schemes in the folded channel for MCE (Fig. 2 ).",

Some special characteristics of plastic chips must be noted before surface modification for electrophoretic separation. First, compared with glass and silica, plastics usually show much poorer resistance to higher temperature and low-polar organic solvents. Second, the properties of one kind plastic often vary with producers and batches, as there are usually some additives in plastic resins, such as antioxidant, fire resistance, and toughness reinforce. Third, polymer molecular weight and distribution often differ between brands and batches. Last, fabrication parameters such as temperature and pressure between mold injections also changed sometimes. Therefore, surface smoothness, hydrophilicity and UV-vis absorption of microchannel are not consistent all the time, and surface modification is usually unavoidable. Now, additives in bulk resins, surface adsorbed coating and surface covalent coating are three primary approaches used for plastic microchip surface modification.",

Later, when the gradient solvent and shallow channel were used, separation efficiency was improved sharply [86] . If the channel depth was only 2.9 m, the separation efficiency could be increased all along with electric field within the experiment range, while an optimal electric field was occurred for the deeper channel. Chip MEKC was introduced in 1995 [87] . At first, the most optimal electric field was found as 400 V/cm, and about 3.0 m plate height was obtained.

When 1 M NaCl and 5 mM 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazine-1-ethanesulfonic acid (HEPES) were used as leading electrolyte (LE) and tailing electrolyte (TE), respectively, Alexa Fluor 488 and bodipy could be stacked more than a million fold, and only a very short injection/ITP time (40 s) was needed. With an upgraded optical system, 100 aM fluorophores could be analyzed without manual buffer exchange steps [94] . This was the highest sensitivity obtained with electrophoretic separation ever reported. Unfortunately, no real sample testing with this method was reported until now. Trace phenolic compounds were analyzed by a chip MEKC technique coupled with field-amplified sample stacking (FASS) and field amplified sample injection (FASI) [95] . FASS, FASI and separation were carried out continuously in three connected channel segments. Sample was injected and stacked with amplified electric field in the first channel, then was transferred to second channel filled with one plug of water, and stacked for the second time under amplified electric field, at the end, focusing sample plug was injected into the third channel, separated and detected by an amperometric detector of a cellulose-dsDNA-modified, screen-printed carbon electrode. With this method, about 5200-fold concentration was achieved, and trace phenolic compounds in tap water and surface water were directly analyzed.",

Fluorescent covalent labeling and affinity labeling are two most common methods. Generally covalent coupling of fluorescent tag was usually applicable to amino acid [98] , bioamines [99] and other active groups-contained molecules, as high reaction rate was needed for a short reaction time in microchip.

UV detection was reported for the high-speed chiral separations on silica microchip [104] and Chinese traditional drug analysis on hybrid silica/PDMS microchip [105] . In order to decrease the UV absorption background of chip bulk, PDMS was sharply thinned at the detection window zone. UV detection has a wide application range over LIF indeed, but it is usually limited for its poor sensitivity. Thus, the coupling of chip concentration and UV detection can significantly extend the application field of MCE for small molecules [106] . A quartz microchip for UV detection was fabricated by using multi-point pressure method in normal temperature and lower pressure during bonding process in Lin's group (Fig. 6) , in which ITP and CZE was integrated, and two flavonoids were concentrated up to 32-fold, compared to the CZE mode only. Deep UV fluorescence detection at 266-nm excitation wavelength has been realized for sensitive detection in MCE, and low-micromolar concentrations sensitivity could be achieved in fused silica microchip [107] . Enantioselective catalysis and analysis also were monitored with the same method on an integrated microchip [108] .",

Fast PCR products analysis was another interest from biological laboratories. Recently, integrated and portable DNA analysis microdevices have become another powerful tool to take over challenges from anti-terrorism, food and environment safety, in which sample pretreatment, DNA/RNA extraction and amplification, electrophoresis separation and detection are all included in a microchip.

In the following years, high-resolution electrophoretic separations of DNA restriction fragments [112] , single-color sequencing to \u223c433 bases in 10 min, and four-color DNA sequencing to \u2212150 bases with 97% accuracy in only 540 s were also reported by Mathies group [113] . Four-loci STR analysis were performed in less than 2 min, and even achieved baseline resolved elelctrophoretic separations of single-locus STR samples in 30 s [114] . However, lots of problems appeared when more applicable DNA electrophoresis microchip was pur-sued after these original successes. First of all, the unavoidable turn geometry in chip CAE sharply decreased the efficiencies. Moreover, injector size, electric field, separation matrix and temperature did matter when super-high resolution was required to the long-range DNA sequencing and valid STR genotyping.",

Using a modified semi-nested methylation-specific PCR combining PMMA chip CGE, this group scanned tumor-associated aberrant hypermethylation of the p16 gene in plasma and tissue DNA from 153 specimens [126] . They also assessed the -6A/G polymorphism in the core promoter region of angiotensinogen gene in 123 patients with essential hypertension and 103 healthy controls [127] . Besides, microchip CGE was also developed for rapid authentication of ginseng species. The results showed that at two microsatellite loci, American ginseng and Oriental ginseng had distinct allele patterns themselves [128] . Moreover, cultivated and wild American ginseng could be distinguished with similar methods. Recently, integrated chip ITP-CGE was demonstrated for highly sensitive and rapid genotyping of the hepatitis B virus, with a LOD of 0.0021 ng/mL, and 200 clinical cases were studied with 93% classification rate, which was 6% higher than that obtained with the conventional method [129] .",

Up to now, lots of novel separation matrixes have been developed. Barron and co-workers reported two new polymer matrixes. One was sparsely cross-linked \"nanogel\" matrixes [131] , which was synthesized by inverse emulsion copolymerization of acrylamide and \u223c10 \u22124 mol% bisacrylamide. These \"nonogel\" had typically a radius of \u223c230 nm, and was \u223c75% cross-linked. Because of the physical network stability of nanogel, longer average read lengths were obtained under standard conditions compared to the conventional PAAm matrix. The other was thermoresponsive polymers [132] , which decoupled matrix loading and sieving properties. Baba and co-workers demonstrated the feasibility of nanospheres for DNA separation [20] . The nanosphere had a hydrophobic core of cross-linked poly(lactic acid) and a hydrophilic shell of PEG with a narrow size distribution and low viscosity in aqueous media (0.94 centipoise at 1% (w/v)). DNA fragments up to 15 kbp were successfully separated with 100 s without any saturation in migration rates. Intrachain segregated structure of DNA was observed during DNA migration under an electric field. Monolithic quartz nanopillar array was also used as \"sieving media\" for long dsDNA fragments, which was about 100-500 nm diameter and 500-5000 nm tall [133] . Lin and co-workers reported an ultra-low viscosity matrix composed of low molecular weight cellulose derivative and glucose [130] .

Protein sample denatured out of chip was sized by polymer solution, and at the same time, protein-SDS complex was dynamic labeled by the dyes in polymer solution. Then, an intersection fluid flow was introduced to dilute SDS below its critical micelle concentration before detection, which sharply reduced the fluorescent background. Both on-chip staining and SDS dilution steps occurred within 100 ms, which was about 10 4 times faster than that in SDS-PAGE. Here, 11 model proteins were sequentially separated, with a sizing accuracy better than 5% and high sensitivity (30 nM for carbonic anhydrase) (Fig. 10) . By omitting the protein denaturing process, Baba and co-workers achieved protein analysis in a shorter total time, with dramatically improved sensitivity [141] . The fact that chip CGE required only a small amount of proteins probably helped to remove the need for the denaturing procedure. About 600 pg BSA was detectable, which equaled levels detectable by silver stain. They also applied this method to analysis of protein expression of Jurkat cells during heat Shock. Instead of polymer solution, Sandia National Laboratories separated proteins with in situ UV initiated cross-linked PAAm gel, and covalent protein labeling protocol instead of dynamic labeling [142] .",

Recently, a two-dimensional (2D) finite-volume model was developed to simulate nonlinear IEF in complex microgeometries and predicted that IEF resolution could be improved by mobilizing them through a contraction zone. To further increase sample loading and therefore the concentrations of focused analytes, a dynamic approach, which was based on electrokinetic injection of proteins/peptides from solution reservoirs, was demonstrated by Lee and co-workers [147] . The sample was continuously injected and encountered the pH gradient established by carrier ampholytes originally present in the channel.

Lin's group developed a method for characterizing chicken and turkey ovalbumin by chip CZE combined with exoglycosidase digestion [148] . By using a porous monolith column fabricated by UVinitiated polymerization, lectin affinity chromatography was miniaturized into a microfluidic format [149] . The glycoproteins could be separated into several fractions with different affinities after chip CZE. More important, running buffers for chip CZE are quite close to physiological condition, with no complex additives added. This will facilitate the exploration of protein structure and its function. Some interaction-based MCE works have been reported [150] . Lin and co-workers developed affinity MCE methods based on indirect LIF detection [151] and frontal analysis [152] to study the interaction between heparin and serum albumin. With indirect LIF detection, the binding constant could be determined more precisely without possible negative influence from the fluorescent tag on protein. With two injectors, when sample mixture was injected, another separate sample plug was introduced into separation channel simultaneously, and used as the internal standard during chip CZE, so the potential interference from EOF markers was completely avoided.",

Therefore, many efforts have been carried out to achieve chip 2D protein analysis. Mimicking 2D gel, chip 2D can be established by focusing samples in one channel, and then sizing IEF sections in parallel in cross channels [157] . The prototype 2D chip electrophoresis was demonstrated in PDMS microchip in 2002 [158] . Here, IEF was performed out, and focused samples were orthogonally placed on the microchannels in parallel and then started chip CGE. Chang et al. improved this system. IEF and -CGE were incorporated in a plastic chip [159] , in which focused proteins were electrokinetically transferred into orthogonal microchannels directly for subsequent chip CGE. All analysis was completed within 10 min with an overall peak capacity of \u223c1700. Han and co-workers coupled IEF with -CGE by the active microvalve control, in which protein plug after IEF could be isolated with pneumatic valve, and subjected chip CGE. Thus, the interruption between running buffers of CGE and IEF could be inhibited to a high extent [160] .",

Gated injection was implemented for CZE injection, and the electric valve was switched every 3-4 s for 0.3 s to inject samples of effluent from the first dimension into the second dimension, with a peak capacity of 500-1000. In 2001, CEC was used instead of MEKC as the first dimension and coupled with CZE [162] . A 25-cm spiral separation channel modified with octadecylsilane for CEC and 1.2 cm straight separation channel for CZE. The sample plug from CEC was loaded into CZE channel for 0.2 s with a cycle of 3.2 s. The peak capacity was estimated as 150. In 2003, an optimized chip MEKC-CZE was introduced with 1 Hz sampling frequency for CZE [163] . BSA tryptic digest was separated within 10 min with a peak capacity of 4200 (Fig. 11 ).

At the same time, well-established microfabrication technologies facilitate MCE with more freedom and compactness. Other related functional units such as microheater, pneumatic pump and valve developed in microfluidic chip can be recruited as required. Therefore, MCE can be carried out in an integrated and controllable way. Generally, MCE has demonstrated the ability for the fast and efficient sepa-ration of various analytes, from small ions to large biomolecules, provided a feasible method for conducting numerous experiments in parallel, while consuming little reagent and achieving even better results.",

MCE is not selfcontained in most out-of-lab cases, and it alone dose not fulfill the full potential of miniaturization. On-line sample preparation is highly desirable for most MCE-based applications. DNA extraction and amplification from a crude sample is a typical and successful pioneer technology, and its integration with MCE has also been demonstrated recently. A sample volume of several microliters was needed, and the analysis cycle was within 1 h [28] . Perfusion sampling of proteins and bioamines in vivo, followed with derivation and high-speed MCE were integrated within a microchip [176] . The sampling interval was less than 1 min, and could last several hours. However, more challenges still exist in sample preparation, such as the extraction of a target fraction from solid samples, or from fragile and complex biological samples.",
