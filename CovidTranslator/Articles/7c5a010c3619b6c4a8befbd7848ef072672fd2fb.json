Although the virus neutralization test is the gold standard assay for MERS diagnosis and for investigating the zoonotic reservoir, it uses live virus and so must be performed in high containment laboratories. Competitive ELISA (cELISA), in which a labeled monoclonal antibody (MAb) competes with test serum antibodies for target epitopes, may be a suitable alternative because it detects antibodies in a species-independent manner. In this study, novel MAbs against the spike protein of MERS-CoV were produced and characterized. One of these MAbs was used to develop a cELISA. The cELISA detected MERS-CoV-specific antibodies in sera from MERS-CoV-infected rats and rabbits immunized with the spike protein of MERS-CoV. The MAb-based cELISA was validated using sera from Ethiopian dromedary camels. Relative to the neutralization test, the cELISA detected MERS-CoV-specific antibodies in 66 Ethiopian dromedary camels with a sensitivity and specificity of 98% and 100%, respectively. The cELISA and neutralization test results correlated well (Pearson's correlation coefficients = 0.71-0.76, depending on the cELISA serum dilution). This cELISA may be useful for MERS epidemiological investigations on MERS-CoV infection.",

It was first identified in the Middle East in 2012 . Patients with MERS who live outside of the endemic region but have a history of travel to or a temporary residence in the Middle East have been also identified (de Groot et al., 2013) . To date, at least 2000 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS have been reported: the case fatality rate (CFR) is more than 30% (WHO, 2017) . While most patients show severe symptoms with a high CFR, some mild or asymptomatic cases are reported during MERS outbreaks, and human-to-human transmission of MERS-CoV is relatively limited when compared with that during outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 (Al-Gethamy et al., 2015; Drosten et al., 2014; Memish et al., 2014) . These observations and reports are supported by a cross-sectional study in Saudi Arabia which showed that in December 2012-December 2013, 0.15% of the healthy population had anti-MERS-CoV antibodies (Muller et al., 2015) .",

Furthermore, MERS-CoV appears to be circulating outside the Middle East since the virus has been detected in dromedary camels in East, West, and North Africa (Reusken et al., 2014) . Since bat-coronaviruses (BtCoV)-HKU4 and -HKU5, which are detected in Tylonycteris and Pipistrellus bats, respectively, are closely related to MERS-CoV, bats may be suspected to be a natural host of MERS-CoV (Lu and Liu, 2012) .

However, the usefulness of these assays in terms of detecting anti-MERS-CoV antibodies is limited by the fact that antibodies against the conserved proteins of coronaviruses are often cross-reactive; as a result, these assays often yield false-positive reactions (Chen et al., 2015; Corman et al., 2012; Meyer et al., 2014) . Neutralization assays such as the plaque reduction neutralization test or micro-plate neutralization test are set up using susceptible cell lines and live MERS-CoV. These neutralization assays are considered to be the gold standard for detecting and measuring serum antibody responses to MERS-CoV because they are highly specific and sensitive (Hemida et al., 2014; Perera et al., 2013; Reusken et al., 2013b) . However, these assays require high containment laboratories due to the use of highly pathogenic live MERS-CoV. Alternative neutralization assays based on replication-incompetent pseudoparticles, which are generated using vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) or human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), have been developed as safe and high-throughput neutralization tests (Fukuma et al., 2015; Hemida et al., 2014; Perera et al., 2013) . In addition, a cell-free protein microarray that uses the S1 fragment of the MERS-CoV S protein as the antigen has been developed (Reusken et al., 2013a) .",

To further limit the possibility of cross-reaction with other coronaviruses, we assessed whether any of the seven MAbs specifically recognized MERS-CoV S antigen: this was because the S proteins of coronaviruses are more divergent than the other coronavirus proteins . Thus, we performed IFA with MERS-CoV S protein-expressing cells and found that five MAbs reacted to the S protein of MERS-CoV but not to its N protein ( Supplementary  Fig. S2 ). In addition, to determine whether any of the seven MAbs could neutralize MERS-CoV infection, we performed viral neutralization assays using a replication-incompetent VSV that expressed MERS-CoV S protein ( Supplementary Fig. S3 ).

The critical amino acid residues required for binding MAb 45E11 (K543 and Q544), MAb 45C2 (R542 and S546), and MAb 43A9 (G462) were identified (Fig. 3A) . According to the structure of the RBD of the MERS-CoV S protein complexed with the human receptor molecule DPP4 Ying et al., 2015) , all of these critical residues were located on the DPP4-binding site of the S protein (Fig. 3A) . The fact that the putative epitopes of the three MAbs were located on the DPP4-binding site of the RBD suggests that these MAbs may inhibit the entry of MERS-CoV by blocking the interaction between the MERS-CoV RBD and DPP4. The 45E11 and 45C2 epitopes were likely to overlap with each other because the amino acid substitutions in the escape mutants were very close to each other (Fig. 3A) . Indeed, the two MERS-CoV mutants that escaped neutralization by 45E11 (i.e., MERS-CoV-45E11-K543N and MERS-CoV-45E11-Q544H) grew efficiently in the presence of 45C2. Similarly, the two MERS-CoV mutants that escaped neutralization by 45C2 (i.e., MERS-R542T and MERS-S546Y) replicated well in the presence of 45E11. By contrast, the 43A9 MAb strongly neutralized all of these escape mutants. In addition, the 45E11 and 45C2 MAbs effectively neutralized the G462D escape mutant of 43A9 (Fig. 3B) . Thus, the mutant viruses that escaped from 45E11 also escaped from 45C2, and vice versa, which indicates that the epitopes of these two MAbs overlap. Sequence analysis of the heavy and light chain genes of 45C2 and 45E11 revealed several amino acid differences in the variable region, including in the complementary determining region (Supplementary Fig. S4 ).",

Relative to neutralization tests with live MERS-CoV (the gold standard in the field for detecting anti-MERS-CoV antibodies), the cELISA was able to detect dromedary camel sera that were positive (n = 63) and negative (n = 3) for MERS-CoV-specific antibodies with a sensitivity and specificity of 98% and 100%, respectively. Moreover, the cELISA was able to detect anti-MERS-CoV antibodies in sera from MERS-CoV-infected rats and rabbits that had been immunized with MERS-CoV S protein. In addition, negative control samples, including sera from rabbits and mice that had been immunized with SARS-CoV particles, the N protein of MERS-CoV, or the S protein of SARS-CoV, did not inhibit the binding of the MAb to the MERS-CoV antigen at even the lowest serum dilution (8-fold). Because the anti-sera against other coronaviruses were not available in this study, we did not test specificity of cELISA using them. However, to ensure the accuracy and versatility of the cELISA, the labeled MAb was characterized in terms of its antigen specificity ( Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. S1 ). This confirms that the specificity of the cELISA is high. Thus, the cELISA detects MERS-CoV antibody in a non-species-dependent and highly-specific manner. Furthermore, we found that the three MAbs that we selected for epitope analyses (including 45C2) were highly specific for the RBD of the S protein of MERS-CoV. When we compared the RBD amino acid sequences of > 170 strains of MERS-CoV in the NCBI database, we found that the amino acid residues that were critical for the recognition of the three MAbs are conserved in all strains (data not shown). This indicates that all MERS-CoV strains that have been reported to date are likely to be recognized by the three MAbs. Thus, all three MAbs may be useful for detecting MERS-CoV-specific antibodies in cELISA. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a cELISA that is based on a MERS-CoV S protein-specific MAb.",

Correlation between percent inhibition in the 45C2-based competitive ELISA and the neutralization titers of 63 camel sera, as determined by using live MERS-CoV. Sixtythree sera from dromedary camels from Ethiopia were tested at various dilutions in the 45C2-based competitive ELISA and the neutralization test. The percent inhibition of each sample at the 256-fold dilution in the competitive ELISA is plotted on the y-axis. The neutralization titers (Log 10 ) are plotted on the x-axis. The Pearson's correlation coefficient (r) was 0.74. et al., 2015) . These observations suggest that the 45C2 MAb reacts with the DPP4-binding site in the RBD and that this is responsible for its ability to neutralize MERS-CoV infection of Vero cells. This is supported by the fact that, in cELISAs, serum antibodies inhibit the labeled antibody either by blocking the labeled antibody epitope directly or by recognizing a neighboring epitope and therefore providing spatial competition (Hirota et al., 2012) . Given that a neutralizing epitope appears to be the target for the competition between the 45C2 MAb and the test serum antibodies, it is likely that the inhibitory serum antibodies that are detected by our cELISA will be neutralizing antibodies. Our cELISA differed from the neutralization test in only one of the 66 dromedary camel serum samples: a sample that was positive on the neutralization test was negative on the cELISA. There was also a significant positive correlation between the percent inhibition values in the cELISA and the neutralization titers, although the correlation coefficient r did vary slightly between the different serum dilutions.",

Our cELISA also has the advantage that it does not have to be performed in a high containment laboratory, unlike the neutralization test.

The RBDs served as antigens in an IgG-ELISA. The ability of the supernatants of the indicated hybridoma clones to recognize the RBDs was examined (left histogram). Rabbit anti-SARS-CoV serum was used to confirm the antigenicity of the SARS-CoV RBD (right histogram). The results were expressed as optical density (O.D.) (405-490 nm). (B) Immunofluorescence assay: the indicated monoclonal antibodies were labeled with FITC and incubated with HeLa 229 cells that expressed the Fc-tagged RBDs of MERS-CoV or the bat CoVs Bt-CoV-HKU4 and Bt-CoV-HKU5. The fluorescent signals were detected under a fluorescence microscope. An Alexa Fluor 488labeled anti-mouse IgG served as a positive control.",
