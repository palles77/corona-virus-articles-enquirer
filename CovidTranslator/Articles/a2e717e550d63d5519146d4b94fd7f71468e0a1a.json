On April 18, results of a physical examination (including chest radiograph) for a visa extension in Qatar were unremarkable. On the day of arrival back in Tunisia (April 28), the patient experienced chills, followed by arthralgia, dry cough, and fever. The daughter reported that her father had had no direct contact with camels during his stay in Qatar or Saudi Arabia. One of his children (patient 3, a nurse) gave him acetaminophen and aspirin for 3 days and then intravenously administered dexamethasone (4 mg) twice a day for 2 days. On May 6, patient 1 experienced worsened dyspnea and he sought care at the Centre Hospitalier-Universitaire Fattouma Bourguiba Hospital (Monastir, Tunisia) emergency department, where he received a fifth injection of dexamethasone. Chest radiograph showed left lower lobe infiltrate (online Technical Appendix Figure, http:// wwwnc.cdc.gov/EID/article/20/9/14-0378-Techapp1. pdf). The patient was first admitted to the pulmonary ward, where he received amoxicillin-clavulanate (1 g) 3 times daily; however, on May 8, respiratory failure and peripheral signs of shock necessitated admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), where he was positioned prone and given noradrenalin infusion and mechanical ventilation with additional nitric oxide.",

The lavage fluid was then tested in the Tunisia National Reference On August 5, 2013, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) tested a serum sample collected from the index-patient on May 9. Independent rRT-PCRs were positive for MERS-CoV (5); targets were upE (cycle threshold [C t ] 30.27) and nucleocapsid protein (N)2 (C t 30.46). Sequences of the full N and spike (S) protein coding regions were submitted to GenBank (accession nos. KF811035 and KF811036, respectively). Nucleotide/predicted amino acid sequence identities with published MERS-CoV sequences for the N and S gene coding regions ranged from 99.2%-100% to 99.0%-100% and from 99.4%-99.9% to 99.4%-99.8%, respectively. Phylogenetic relationships between this virus (designated Tunisia-Qatar_2013) and other published MERS-CoV sequences showed clustering with geographically diverse sequences from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (Figure 2 ). Patient 2 was the 30-year-old daughter who had accompanied the index case-patient to Mecca. She remained in Qatar until she attended her father's funeral in Tunisia on May 11, 2013, when she reported sore throat, cough, and fever. On May 13, a chest radiograph showed bronchial thickening.

Patient 3, who had not traveled outside Tunisia, could have been exposed during the 11 days he cared for his father at home and in the hospital. The history of patient 2 is less clear; she might have acquired the virus from the same source as her father in Qatar, or she might have been secondarily infected by contact with him before he left Qatar, given that her illness began almost 12 days after her father's. Patient 1 was severely ill at the time of ICU admission; in <3 days, his condition rapidly evolved to multiple organ system failure and death. Although we cannot account for the diabetes or corticosteroid contributions to his disease severity, we can speculate that they might have worsened his outcome. Other MERS CoV patients who have died had concurrent conditions (2) , and corticosteroids are thought to worsen the outcomes for patients with influenza A(H1N1) virus infection (10) .",

Serum and available nucleotide sequences from GenBank and Public Health England (http://www.hpa.org.uk/webw/ HPAweb&HPAwebStandard/HPAweb_C/1317136246479) and the Institut F\u00fcr Virologie (http://www.virology-bonn.de/index.php?id = 46). The estimated neighbor-joining trees were constructed from nucleotide alignments by using MEGA version 6.06 (http://www.megasoftware. net). Sequence names are written as GenBank accession number|virus strain name|month-year of collection. Numbers in parentheses denote the number of additional sequences from viruses isolated from humans that are identical to the listed sequence. Solid circles indicate sequences from MERS-CoV from Tunisia, 2013. Camel icons indicate MERS-CoV sequences derived from isolates from camels. Bootstrap support values (1,000 replicates) \u226575% were plotted at the indicated internal branch nodes. Scale bars indicate number of nucleotide substitutions per site.",
