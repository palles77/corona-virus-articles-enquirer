Once damage is inflicted, lung cells trigger a host response which can include inflammation, matrix remodeling and different forms of cell death, including apoptosis (1) . Although a limited host response may help to clear the injurious agent and repair lung tissue (2) , an overexuberant host response can lead to severe injury and impairment in gas exchange. Therefore, therapeutic strategies aimed to limit lung damage and interference with lung repair are important. Lungs are exposed to mechanical load during every breath. In pathologic conditions, generation of the pressure gradients necessary for ventilation may cause an excessive cell stretch and lead to organ dysfunction. This is especially relevant during mechanical ventilation with high pressures, which can lead to the so-called ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) (3, 4) . In mechanically ventilated patients , a strategy aimed to limit VILI decreased mortality in patients with the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (5) .",

Contrasting with cell models, previous studies have shown the need of two different hits to trigger both lung senescence and repair in animal models (27) . In our work, the combination of acid instillation and mechanical ventilation was required to observe senescence-associated heterochromatin foci. In smooth muscle cells, stretch leads to p53 activation and upregulation of senescence markers (28), resembling our findings in A549 cells. Several mechanisms have linked the mechanical load to this biological response, including oxidative stress and MAPK activation (29) . Our work focused on the role of the nuclear envelope as a critical structure regulating both mechanosensing and senescence. The mechanical load is transmitted from the extracellular matrix to the cytoskeleton and then to the nuclear membrane (30) . This causes a change in the nuclear lamina, reorganization of the underlying chromatin and DNA damage (31) . On the other hand, abnormalities of this nuclear lamina activate a pro-senescent program in the cell (9, 32) . Several HIV protease inhibitors, such as lopinavir/ritonavir, inhibit ZMPSTE-24, a protease responsible for Lamin-A maturation (19), thus preserving nuclear compliance and decreasing stretch induced apoptosis and VILI (8) .
