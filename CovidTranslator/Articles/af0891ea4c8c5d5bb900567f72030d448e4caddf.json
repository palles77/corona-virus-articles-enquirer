To identify region(s) of the N molecule required for pseudoparticle formation, we performed biochemical analysis of the interaction of N mutants and M in HEK293 cells. Using a peptide library derived from N, we found that amino acids 101-115 constituted a novel binding site for M. We examined the ability of N mutants to interact with M and form pseudoparticles, and our observations indicated that M bound to N\u0394(101-115), N1-150, N151-300, and N301-422, but not to N1-150\u0394(101-115). However, pseudoparticles were formed when N\u0394(101-115) or N301-422, but not N1-150 or N151-300, were expressed with M in HEK293 cells. These results indicated that the minimum portion of N required for the interaction with M and pseudoparticle formation consists of amino acids 301-422.",

M is essential for the formation of pseudoparticles (Huang et al., 2004) . In the case of murine coronavirus, only M and E are required for formation of pseudoparticles (Bos et al., 1996; Vennema et al., 1996) , in marked contrast with the case of SARS-CoV requiring M and N only to form pseudoparticles (Huang et al., 2004) . Virology 380 (2008) 99-108 The N protein of coronaviruses is a major structural component that plays a role in virion assembly through its interactions with the viral genome and M protein (Hurst et al., 2005; Masters, 1992; Nelson and Stohlman, 1993; Narayanan et al., 2000; Narayanan et al., 2003) . The N protein is also considered essential for viral RNA synthesis, although the cellular events affected by N are not yet known (Almazan et al., 2004) . Crystal structures of C-terminal domain (amino acids 248-365) (Chen et al., 2007) , N-terminal domain (amino acids 1-174) (Saikatendu et al., 2007) and dimerization domain (amino acids 270-370) have been reported. N contains a disordered region in the middle of the molecule (Chang et al., 2006; Zuniga et al., 2007) , which does not form a particular structure otherwise it binds adequate binding partners.",

After blocking, the plates were incubated with M63 (final 1 \u03bcg/mL), and binding of M63 to N protein was detected with rabbit anti-M63 plus HRP-goat anti-rabbit IgG. The two data points for each peptide are the results of two independent experiments. (B) Each peptide (10 \u03bcg/mL) was injected into a BIAcore flow cell containing immobilized M116. The injection was started at 100 s, stopped at 240 s, and dissociated for 300 s. (C) Competitive inhibition of binding between N and M63 proteins by N-derived peptides. M63 was preincubated with each N peptide, and each mixture was added to a plate coated with N protein. Binding of M63 to N protein was detected as in (A). Binding in the absence of peptide was set at 100%. Data are presented as means \u00b1 SD. cells was sufficient for formation of pseudoparticles (Mortola and Roy, 2004) , whereas, only M and N were required in mammalian cells (Huang et al., 2004) . Replication of SARS-CoV may be controlled by modifying the interaction between the M and N proteins. Using a mammalian two-hybrid system, the region of N bound to M (amino acids 168-208) was found to contain a serine/arginine-rich motif (amino acids 184-196) (He et al., 2004b) . The same region was necessary for self-multimerization of N (He et al., 2004a) . Analysis Each N peptide (0.01-10 \u03bcg/mL) was immobilized onto a plate. After blocking, the plate was incubated with M116 (1 \u03bcg/mL), and bound M116 was detected with rabbit anti-M63 and HRP-goat anti-rabbit IgG as described in Materials and methods. (B) Inhibition of the interaction between N mutants and M116 was observed with peptide 101-115. The experimental procedure was identical to that described in the legend to Fig. 1C . Data are presented as means \u00b1 SD. antibodies of lysates of HEK293 cells coexpressing N mutants and M116. As both of the antibodies used for immunoprecipitation and detection of the target proteins were raised in rabbits, the immunoglobulin light chain (ca. 25 kDa) was observed due to cross-reaction with the 2nd antibody. using a yeast two-hybrid system and surface plasmon resonance techniques showed that amino acids 351-422 of N interacted with amino acids 197-221 of M and that the C-terminal region of N (amino acids 343-402) was necessary for its oligomerization (Luo et al., 2006b) .",

            "text": "Analysis of pseudoparticle formation by isolated proteins would provide critical clues into the process of virion formation in vivo. In mammalian cells, the formation of SARS-CoV pseudoparticles requires a minimum of two proteins, N and M (Huang et al., 2004) . Using buoyant density gradient analysis and TEM, we observed pseudoparticle formation when M was coexpressed with N wild-type, N\u0394(101-115), or N301-422 in HEK293 cells, indicating that the N protein segment of amino acids 301-422 was the minimum requirement for pseudoparticle formation. Based on these findings, we propose a model for the assembly of SARS-CoV pseudoparticles by N and M (Fig.  7) . N1-150 binds to M via the 101-115 region, as demonstrated in this study. N151-300 binds to M via the 168-208 region as reported previously (He et al., 2004b) . N151-300 is also capable of forming homodimers but not oligomers. However, this binding is not sufficient to support pseudoparticle formation in mammalian cells (Fig. 5B) . In contrast, N301-422 is capable of forming pseudoparticles. The differences among the N regions are probably based on the ability to form homooligomers. N301-422 contains a region capable of homotetramer formation (He et al., 2004a) . The tetramers of N would provide scaffolds for the formation of pseudoparticles for M. Indeed, N colocalized with M in buoyant density gradients formed SDS-resistant oligomers (data not shown).",

We examined the abilities of these peptides to inhibit pseudoparticle formation by N and M via either peptide delivery or expression. However, these approaches were not successful (data not shown), which may have been due to ineffective delivery and insufficient expression of the peptides, respectively. Interestingly, the peptide (101-115) also inhibited the interaction between M and other N mutants, not containing the 101-115 region. Recombinant cytoplasmic region of the M protein used in this study consisted of only 116 amino acid residues. Thus, one possibility to explain this phenomenon is that M has only one site to bind N in the molecule and the site is shared by several regions in N for their interaction; the 101-115 peptide may occupy this site to inhibit access of N to M.",
