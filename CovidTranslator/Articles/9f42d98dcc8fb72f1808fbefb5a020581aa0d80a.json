The aim of this study was to determine if PEDV can be shed in semen from SPF (specific pathogens free) boars infected by a French S-InDel PEDV strain (PEDV/FR/001/2014) and in case of positive semen to determine the infectivity of that semen. Both infected boars had diarrhea after inoculation and shed virus in feces. PEDV genome was also detected by RT-qPCR in the sperm-rich fraction of semen (6.94 \u00d7 10 3 and 4.73 \u00d7 10 3 genomic copies/mL) from the two boars infected with the S-InDel PEDV strain but only once at 7DPI. In addition, PEDV RNA in Peyer's patches and in mesenteric lymph nodes was also present for the two inoculated boars. The PEDV positive semen (S-non-InDel and S-InDel) sampled during a previous trial and in this boar trial were inoculated to six SPF weaned pigs. The inoculated piglets did not seroconvert and did not shed virus throughout the duration of the study except for one pig at 18 DPI. But, PEDV could be detected in intestinal tissues such as duodenum, jejunum and jejunum Peyer's patches by RT-qPCR except for one pig. Even if PEDV genome has been detected in semen, experimental infection of piglets with positive semen failed to conclude to the infectivity of the detected PEDV.",

            "text": "Porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) was described for the first time in Europe in the 1970s (Jung and Saif, 2015; Song and Park, 2012) . This disease is characterized by a severe, profuse watery diarrhea with or without vomiting and dehydration and is caused by an etiologic agent called porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), a positive-sense, singlestranded RNA enveloped coronavirus of 28-kb (Jung and Saif, 2015) . After several outbreaks in the 70's, PED has been persisting in Europe with sporadic cases until the late 1990's (Jung and Saif, 2015) . Outbreaks of PED have also been described in Asia in the 1980s and from 2010 (Jung and Saif, 2015; Wang et al., 2013) . Currently, two genotypes are circulating in several regions in the world, namely the S-non-InDel strains and the S-InDel strains, showing insertions-deletions in the S1 segment of the S gene (Jung and Saif, 2015; Vlasova et al., 2014) . From clinical reports, these two types of strains seemed to be different in terms of morbidity and mortality with the S-non-InDel PEDV strains associated with more severe clinical cases and higher case-fatality rate compared to the others (Vlasova et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2014) . In contrast to S-non-InDel PEDV strains, exclusively reported from America and Asia, S-InDel PEDV strains have also been identified in Europe since 2014 (EFSA, 2016; Stadler et al., 2015; Vlasova et al., 2014) .",

Airborne transmission of the virus was also shown for S-non-InDel strains (Alonso et al., 2014) . PEDV transmission through contaminated milk from dam to piglets can also occur (Sun et al., 2012) but vertical transmission of PEDV through semen has never been shown. S-non-InDel PEDV strain shedding has recently been evidenced in the different fractions of semen (seminal and sperm-rich fractions) and in gelatin plug of specific pathogen free (SPF) boars experimentally inoculated (Gallien et al., 2018b) . However, to the best of our knowledge, the presence of PEDV RNA in semen of boars infected by an S-InDel PEDV strain has not been studied so far.",

In the previous study, PEDV RNA could be detected for a longer period in the sperm-rich fraction of semen: i.e. transient detections of PEDV RNA during three distinct periods comprised between 3 and 16 days. PEDV RNA was also detected in the seminal fraction of semen and in gelatin plug in S-non-InDel PEDV inoculated boars contrasting to the observations from the present study. This difference regarding PEDV RNA detection in semen could be linked to the viral strain used for inoculation and its virulence. Clinical signs induced with S-non-InDel PEDV were more severe compared to clinical signs observed in S-InDel PEDV challenged boars (Gallien et al., 2018b) . Viral shedding in the sperm-rich fraction of semen has already been reported for PRRSV which belongs to the same order as PEDV, the Nidovirales order, and differences in terms of shedding in semen between genotype 1 and highly virulent genotype 2 PRRSV strains have already been shown (Christopher-Hennings et al., 1995; Prieto and Castro, 2005) . PRRSV genotype 2 strains could be detected during longer periods in semen compared to genotype 1 strains. Hence, the duration of detection of highly virulent genotype 2 PRRSV strains in semen was reported between 25 to 92 days (Christopher-Hennings et al., 2001) while the presence of genotype 1 PRRSV strains in semen could be observed more sporadically: only at one point after infection, at 7 DPI (Prieto et al., 1996) or during shorter periods comprised between 10 and 40 days (Swenson et al., 1994) . Detection of S-InDel PEDV RNA in semen appeared sporadically after the occurrence of clinical signs and detection in feces in contrast to what we observed for an S-non-InDel PEDV strain. Moreover, no S-InDel PEDV RNA was detected in semen after cessation of clinical signs and fecal shedding in contrast to what was observed with the S-non-InDel strain (Gallien et al., 2018b) . These data suggest that the risk of introduction of PEDV shedding boars via imports should be more predictable from clinical exams or fecal shedding assessment for S-InDel strains than for S-non-InDel.",

The presence of low PEDV genomic loads could be noticed in different intestinal tissues. However, clinical signs and seroconversion were absent in all inoculted piglets. The results of the present study neither confirms nor denies if the RT-qPCR PEDV positive semen contained infectious virus. Additional trials with longer periods of observation, sequential slaughters or the use of a more sensitive model such as neonatal piglets should be conducted in order to determine if the PEDV RNA detected in the tissues were caused by PEDV infection. The use of neonatal piglets could have been in fact a most sensitive model to evaluate PEDV infectivity but to realize that kind of trial in our experimental facility, we should have infected two sows with their suckling piglets and for material reasons (place, cost, animal availability\u2026), this option could not be selected. Moreover, with these results, it is impossible to speculate whether PEDV-positive semen could infect sows via natural insemination. In fact, it has already been shown for other porcine viral pathogens that contaminated semen could be infectious, but could not infect sows or gilts through artificial insemination. Weaned pigs inoculated with PCV2 positive semen, for example, presented a viremia and anti-PCV2 antibodies but the same PCV2 positive semen could not infect sows through artificial insemination (Madson et al., 2009) . The amount of virus contained in semen could explain the impossibility of viral transmission through artificial insemination (Grasland et al., 2013; Madson et al., 2009 ). An impact of the amount of virus contained in semen on the capacity of the transmission of viral pathogens has also been shown for PRRSV. The PRRSV can be transmitted through semen but only when it is present in this matrix at a given concentration. Under experimental conditions, PRRSV transmission was successful when semen contained 2 \u00d7 10 5 TCID 50 /mL of virus i.e. on average 10 7 genome copies/mL. However, when the amount of virus contained in semen was approximately 2 \u00d7 10 3 TCID 50 /mL (10 6 genome copies/mL on average), transmission through semen was limited. When the amounts were even lower (2 \u00d7 10 2 TCID 50 /mL, 10 5 genome copies/mL on average), transmission was no longer effective (Prieto and Castro, 2005) . A possible impact of the amount of genomic load of PEDV contained in semen on the capacity of the transmission of PEDV might be suspected in the present case.",
