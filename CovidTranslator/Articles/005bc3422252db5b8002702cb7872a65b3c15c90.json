Some investigators have proposed inhaled ribavirin as a required primary therapy despite limited data, suggesting that its use with immunomodulators may halt clinical progression. [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] We hypothesized that our transplant patients do not experience significant morbidity and mortality from RSV despite not receiving ribavirin therapy. Our cohort received testing of nasal secretions for common respiratory pathogens, including RSV, using a viral real-time PCR (RT-PCR) panel when they presented with respiratory symptoms. Similar methods (RT-PCR and culture) were used to identify coinfections. Patients were considered to have an upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) if they had RSV-positive RT-PCR from secretion analysis plus rhinorrhea, congestion, otitis media, pharyngitis and/or cough. Patients were considered to have a lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) if they had RSV-positive RT-PCR from secretion analysis (nasopharyngeal swab or wash, endotracheal tube aspirate, bronchoalveolar lavage sampling) plus signs including hypoxia (new or increased oxygen requirement) and/or an infiltrate found on chest imaging. An RSV infection episode was defined in a patient who developed symptoms that fully resolved. In some instances, a single patient experienced more than one RSV infectious episode, resulting in more than one admission and/or medical intervention that resulted in resolution of symptoms.",

Eight (27%) of 30 URTIs were diagnosed in patients with concurrent viruses: influenza A (1), influenza B (1), rhinovirus (4), adenovirus (1) or coronavirus (1). One patient with a single documented URTI episode was empirically treated with antibiotics for a communityacquired pneumonia despite no evidence of consolidation on chest X-ray. Imaging studies (chest X-rays and/or CT scans) were performed in 11 (37%) URTIs and confirmed an absence of an LRTI. Twenty (67%) of 30 URTIs were diagnosed in patients already receiving scheduled IVIG supplementation every 1-2 weeks to prevent hypogammaglobulinemia. Five of these 20 infections were treated with an increase in frequency or additional doses of IVIG. Of the 10 URTIs in patients not receiving regularly scheduled IVIG, three received doses of IVIG as treatment after RSV was identified. Additionally, four patients received palivizumab. Twenty-one (70%) URTIs were identified in patients receiving steroids or other immunosuppressive medications at the time of RSV identification. Four patients were receiving treatment for active acute GVHD. Five of 26 patients with URTI subsequently Four of seven LRTIs were diagnosed at a time when a patient was still receiving immunosuppression. No patient was receiving treatment for GVHD at the time RSV was identified. Three children were receiving steroids (alone or with other agents) when RSV was identified. Two of the six patients with LRTIs were o2 years at the time of RSV diagnosis, one with a significant history of prematurity. Two of six patients carried a diagnosis of bronchiolitis obliterans at the time their LRTIs were diagnosed. Six of seven LRTIs were associated with the identification of more than one respiratory tract organism besides RSV including metapneumovirus (1), influenza (2), rhinovirus (1), coccidiomycoses (1), adenovirus, Haemophilus influenza, Penicillium and Nocardia (the latter four organisms seen with one single RSV infectious episode). Infiltrates on radiological studies and increased effort to breathe were noted in all seven cases, with five of seven episodes and two of seven episodes requiring oxygen supplementation and mechanical ventilation, respectively. Five of seven LRTIs were diagnosed at a time when regularly scheduled IVIG was being administered to patients. All seven cases were treated with either increased frequency or additional doses of IVIG. Only one case (a 7-month-old patient) received palivizumab before and after diagnosis. RSV was confirmed negative for five of seven cases with a median of 33 days (range 1-218) between PCR-positive and -negative results. Six of seven cases resulted in a return to clinical baseline. The remaining case involved a patient with a rapid 2-week multiorgan system failure and death; autopsy confirmed disseminated coccidiomycosis.",

            "text": "No treatment is considered standard of care for RSV infection post-HSCT. Shah et al. 6 reported that inhaled ribavirin, when used alone or with IVIG and/or palivizumab, may prevent progression from URTI to LRTI and effect all-cause mortality. A meta-analysis examining the use of inhaled ribavirin plus IVIG with or without palivizumab showed a statistically significant impact on overall survival. 7 Chemaly et al. 4 concluded that the low overall mortality (3/19 or 16%) observed in pediatric oncology patients with RSV-associated LRTIs was due directly to ribavirin use. However, the authors failed to show a statistically significant difference in reducing risk of progression from URTI to LRTI. 4 In general, these reports are retrospective and not rigorously controlled clinical Letter to the Editor trials. Our patients received routine supplementation with IVIG every 1-2 weeks until normal levels for age were maintained. It is possible that passive immunity was provided to our patients with these infusions as analysis of IVIG lots show a uniform and consistent presence of antibodies against RSV. 10 Our RSV-targeted therapy, when used, consisted of additional doses of IVIG to increase passive immunity with or without addition of palivizumab. Palivizumab was used in certain patients based on physician preference and current available guidelines. 11, 12 Previous studies that found little to no survival advantage in patients treated with palivizumab \u00b1 IVIG restricted their analysis to patients who only received IVIG after the diagnosis of an RSV-associated infection was made. There is no indication these patients were receiving regularly scheduled IVIG post HSCT to maintain levels normal for age. 7, 9, 13 There were no deaths attributed to RSV infection in our patients. Overall, only six (19%) patients in our cohort progressed to LRTI. This is much lower than previous reports, where up to 50% of RSV-infected HSCT patients progressed to LRTI, resulting in mortality rates of 12-55%. 4, 14, 15 Our study is limited by being retrospective with a small number of patients. However, our findings differ from established literature and show presentation patterns and clinical outcomes that are better than previously reported. Of note, these outcomes occurred without the use of inhaled ribavirin, previously reported as improving overall survival.",
