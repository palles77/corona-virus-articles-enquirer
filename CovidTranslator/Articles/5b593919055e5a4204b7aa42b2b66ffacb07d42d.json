We quantified microfluidic seeding using a model protein, developed a strategy to produce diffraction-quality crystals of proteins recalcitrant to traditional methods, and solved de novo the X-ray crystal structure of Oligoendopeptidase F. Proteins are crystallized to determine their three-dimensional structures, to understand protein function, and aid in drug design, but crystallization can be an unpredictable and stochastic process. [1] [2] [3] [4] Microfluidics is emerging as a tool to perform crystallization trials faster, cheaper, in smaller volumes, and with a higher level of control. [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] The two general stages of protein crystallization-crystal nucleation and crystal growth-generally have differing optimal conditions. [10] [11] [12] Ideally, the protein forms crystal nuclei at a supersaturation where ordered growth is possible (Figure 1a ). However, for some proteins a supersaturation gap exists, where there is no overlap between nucleation and growth [*",

Conversely, solutions at high supersaturation that promote nucleation may lead to growth of clustered crystals or microcrystals. Supersaturation gaps may be bridged by decreasing concentration from high to low supersaturation, but in traditional vapor diffusion, supersaturation increases during the trial. Other techniques, such as free-interface diffusion, [1, 8, 13] decrease supersaturation during the trial and may bridge the supersaturation gap.",

[10, 17, 18] Seeding eliminates the need for nucleation and growth to occur in the same solution and separates the two stages of protein crystallization in trials that use microliter volumes and larger. [14, 15, [19] [20] [21] However, seeding using small (nL) volumes can be more difficult or not possible at all, because seeds are too small to be seen [22, 23] or are too delicate to be handled. [17] To overcome these challenges, we have developed a plug-based microfluidic system to perform seeding and bridge the supersaturation gap in nL volumes. In this system, nucleation and growth stages of protein crystallization are separated and controlled independently to allow the growth of single protein crystals.",

[25] To separate the nucleation and growth stages, a microfluidic device was designed to control multiple reactions in sequence and in time ( Figure 2a ). [26] In the nucleation stage, highly concentrated solutions of protein and precipitants were combined to form plugs of a highly supersaturated mixture conducive to the formation of seed crystals (functional cores/ centers that lead to the formation of a protein crystal when added to a supersaturated crystallization solution). Seeds must contain protein but may be too small to be seen and may be liquid, [12, 16] amorphous, or microcrystalline. The generation of seeds may take as little as a few seconds or as long as several days, depending on the protein. By controlling flow rates and channel length used for the nucleation stage, time control of seconds, minutes, hours, or even days [6, 26] is achievable.",

            "text": "To illustrate the microfluidic seeding method, seed crystals of thaumatin protein were generated in the nucleation stage in 3-15 seconds by fixing the length of the channel and varying the flow rates of the solutions. After 3-15 seconds, plugs containing seeds were merged into the growth stage, where protein and precipitants were combined to form plugs at lower supersaturation, conducive to ordered crystal growth. Plugs from the growth stage were flowed into a glass microcapillary, where plugs were incubated and observed. When these two stages are combined, this system displays time control [5, 26] on two time scales: in seconds when generating seeds, [26] and in hours to days when incubating plugs. [25] When growth conditions were used alone, no crystals grew (Figure 2b ). When nucleation conditions were used alone, precipitation resulted ( Figure 2c ). When nucleation conditions were combined with growth conditions under time control, single crystals grew ( Figure 2d) . We used the model protein thaumatin to test the hypothesis that the number of crystals formed can be controlled by varying the nucleation time. Tests performed at two levels of supersaturation in the growth stage confirmed that longer nucleation times lead to more seeds and, therefore, more crystals ( Figure 3 ). Crystals grown without seeding were compared by Xray diffraction with crystals grown with seeding. [25, 27, 28] To ensure that no variables were introduced by handling or cryoprotecting, crystals were analyzed inside the capillary (in situ) by obtaining ten-frame sets of diffraction data over a 10-degree rotation range and comparing the average signal-to-noise ratios of the detected reflections in the corresponding resolution shells (see the Supporting Information). Relative to the controls, crystals grew more rapidly and in higher yield with microfluidic seeding and were of the same quality.",

The formation of microcrystalline clusters is consistent with either multiple independent nucleation events or defects during growth, which are typically observed at high supersaturation. [1] At low supersaturation, nucleation did not occur, and no crystals grew, thus suggesting a supersaturation gap (Figure 1b) . Separation of the nucleation and growth stages was achieved in four steps ( Figure 4 ): i) Plugs were formed under nucleation conditions. ii) The flow was stopped to grow clusters of microcrystals over several days. iii) The clusters of microcrystals were dispersed throughout the plug under flow. Each plug of crystals was used to seed multiple plugs. iv) Plugs at low supersaturation (growth conditions) containing the microcrystalline seeds were flowed into a glass capillary for incubation.

This protein was selected as a target by several structural genomics centers (http://sg.pdb.org). Although there has been some success in expression, purification, and crystallization of this protein, no crystal structure has been published. The putative protein sequence from Bacillus stearothermophilus was selected by the Midwest Center for Structural Genomics (MCSG, http://www.mcsg.anl.gov) in 2003, and the purified protein was kept frozen at \u221280\u00b0C after the first run of the crystallization trials. In traditional vapor-diffusion trials (see the Supporting Information), clustered crystals (Figure 5b ) of Oligoendopeptidase F grew from a microcrystalline precipitation (Figure 5a ) but were unsuitable for X-ray analysis. We used microfluidics to take \"seeds\" from the precipitate and flow them into \"growth\" crystallization solutions at lower supersaturation. The key to the success of this approach was the very high dilution of the seeding mixtureapproximately one nL of seeds was used to seed each \"growth\" plug (20-100 nL). As a result of microfluidic seeding, single needlelike crystals grew, which were used for two subsequent rounds of seeding to wash the crystals and allow them to grow larger (Figure 5c ). [18] Microfluidic seeding significantly increased the rate of success in obtaining single crystals of Oligoendopeptidase F suitable for X-ray analysis. Each microfluidic seeding experiment (ca. 1 \u03bcL of protein total) resulted in dozens of single crystals (ca. 50 plugs, most containing single crystals). The crystal structure ( Figure 6 ) of Oligoendopeptidase F was solved by the singlewavelength anomalous diffraction (SAD) technique at a resolution of 3.3 \u212b by using one crystal grown in a microfluidic capillary (see the Supporting Information). To expand the refinement resolution to 3.1 \u212b (PDB code: 2H1J), we merged two data sets collected from two different crystals grown in a microfluidic capillary.",

This system presents a solution to the potential conflict between nucleation (requiring high supersaturation) and ordered growth (requiring low supersaturation) and enables three advances that are difficult to achieve with traditional technologies: i) control of the nucleation time with subsecond precision; ii) the seeding of nL volumes; and iii) the use of a single plug to seed dozens of growth plugs by injecting less than one nL of seeding solution into each growth plug. Seeding with a small part of a single plug containing many seed crystals is important both to obtain a few single crystals in each growth plug and to use a single sample containing microcrystalline seed crystals to optimize growth conditions. We have not yet explored the potential of cross-seeding proteins, as was proposed for similar proteins of different species, protein-DNA, or protein-ligand complexes that have already been crystallized in their apo form, [1] though this work could be valuable. We conclude that microfluidic seeding may be used to achieve crystallization of some proteins that currently fail to crystallize and may be used to increase the success rate of future crystallization trials. The nucleation and growth of protein crystals may not occur under the same conditions. a) For some proteins, there is an overlap between the supersaturation regions for nucleation and ordered growth, corresponding to the optimal crystallization condition. b) For other proteins, there is a supersaturation gap between nucleation and ordered growth such that both cannot occur at the same supersaturation. Fraction (F) of plugs with crystals versus incubation time for different nucleation times (t nuc ). a) At a protein concentration of 15 mgmL \u22121 in the growth stage, seeded plugs yielded crystals whereas unseeded plugs did not yield crystals. b) At a protein concentration of 25 mgmL \u22121 in the growth stage, seeded plugs yielded more crystals in a shorter period of time than unseeded plugs. \u2666 control 1 (no seeding), \u2022 t nuc = 9 s, \u25aa t nuc = 5 s, \u25b4 control 2 (no seeding).
