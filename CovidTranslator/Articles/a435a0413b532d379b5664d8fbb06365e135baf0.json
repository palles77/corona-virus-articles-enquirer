It is involved in the modification of uridine bases (U34) at the first anticodon (wobble) position of tRNAs decoding two-family box triplets. The precise role of TrmE in the modification reaction is hitherto unknown. Here, we report the X-ray structure of TrmE from Thermotoga maritima. The structure reveals a three-domain protein comprising the N-terminal a/b domain, the central helical domain and the G domain, responsible for GTP binding and hydrolysis. The N-terminal domain induces dimerization and is homologous to the tetrahydrofolate-binding domain of N,N-dimethylglycine oxidase. Biochemical and structural studies show that TrmE indeed binds formyl-tetrahydrofolate. A cysteine residue, necessary for modification of U34, is located close to the C1-group donor 5-formyl-tetrahydrofolate, suggesting a direct role of TrmE in the modification analogous to DNA modification enzymes. We propose a reaction mechanism whereby TrmE actively participates in the formylation reaction of uridine and regulates the ensuing hydrogenation reaction of a Schiff's base intermediate.",

            "text": "The details of the modification steps that lead to the cmnm 5 U34 modification are not known. TrmE consists of three regions, an N-terminal region of about 220 amino acids, a central G domain of approximately 160 residues and a C-terminal region of 75 amino acids, which contains a motif highly conserved among the TrmE protein family. The sequence of the N-terminal region does not present homology with any known protein and could be involved in the selfassembly of the full TrmE protein (Cabedo et al, 1999) . The G domain, when isolated, conserves the high intrinsic GTPase activity of the intact TrmE molecule, which suggests that removal of the N-and C-terminal regions should not substantially affect its tertiary structure (Cabedo et al, 1999) . The C-terminal end contains a highly conserved CxGK motif, which resembles a CaaX box, which in case of the GTPbinding protein Ras is farnesylated in vivo and plays an important role in membrane association and cell signalling (Bourne et al, 1990) . But there is no evidence for this motif to be necessary for membrane localization of TrmE. Instead, the conserved cysteine is proposed to be important in the catalysis of the modification reaction; its mutation to serine disrupts the modification of tRNA in vivo (Yim et al, 2003) , which leads to the hypothesis that the first step of the modification reaction might be analogous to the C5 modification of pyrimidine catalysed by DNA cytosine-5-methyltransferase (Vilkaitis et al, 2001) , where the enzyme uses a cysteine for activation of the C5 position. Studies based on the homologous 5-taurinomethyl modification of U34 in humans showed that taurine is a direct constituent of the modification (Suzuki et al, 2002) . Assuming a similar TrmE-mediated modification reaction in human and bacteria (5-taurinomethyl-versus 5-cmnm-uridine) glycine instead of taurine would be incorporated in the Escherichia coli reaction. This would still leave open the question of the nature of the C1 group and the covalent bond formation with glycine. It has been shown very early that S-adenosylmethionine is not the C1 donor in charge (Hagervall et al, 1987) .",

TrmE from Thermotoga maritima was expressed in Rosetta DE3 bacteria as an N-terminal His-tag fusion protein. It was purified by affinity chromatography via a nickel-nta-sepharose column and size exclusion chromatography using a Superdex S200 column.

We thus determined the equilibrium binding parameters of TrmE from E. coli by using fluorescent mant-nucleotides (mant: methylanthraniloyl). As observed for most other GTP-binding proteins, addition of protein to mant-nucleotides produces a large increase in fluorescence (Herrmann and Nassar, 1996) . Using a constant concentration of nucleotide and increasing concentration of protein produces a binding isotherm ( Figure 2A ) that can be fitted to a binding equation. The K d values for guanosine di-and triphosphate are in the micromolar range, with an affinity for GDP and GppNHp of 0.62 and 5.8 mM, respectively. The difference in affinity between GDP and GTP may actually be smaller since GppNHp is often found to bind with weaker affinity than GTP itself. GMP binds with an affinity lower than 100 mM, which is similar to Ras-like proteins where the affinity to GMP is orders of magnitude lower than that of GDP/GTP (Vetter and Wittinghofer, 2001) .",

The homology to the THF-binding domain of DMGO suggested that TrmE might also bind THF and that some form of THF would be used to transfer a C1 group onto tRNA. To test this hypothesis, crystals of TrmE were soaked with 5-formyl-tetrahydrofolate (5-formyl-THF). The crystals diffracted up to 2.9 \u00c5 and additional density for bound 5-formyl-THF was clearly visible ( Figure 5B ). In DMGO, the two subdomains form a single binding site for THF, which is located at the periphery of the contact area of the sub-domains. In TrmE instead, the two N-terminal domains are related to each other by a local two-fold noncrystallographic symmetry. The THF-binding site is located at the periphery of the dimer interface as seen for DMGO and involves residues from both subunits. Due to the two-fold symmetry of the N-terminal domains in TrmE, an additional THF-binding site is formed at the symmetry-related position in the TrmE dimer interface (see Figure 5A and B).",

The binding site for 5-formyl-THF is very similar to the one of DMGO (Leys et al, 2003) ( Figure 5C ). The pteridin group is bound by a double hydrogen bond to the totally invariant Glu78 from molecule A (Glu78A), which corresponds to Glu658 in DMGO. This is analogous to the double hydrogen bond between the base of guanine nucleotides and the conserved aspartic acid in the NKxD motif (Vetter and Wittinghofer, 2001) . In the apo form, Glu78A stabilizes Arg20A, which contacts the C-terminal FCV/IGK loop. In the 5-formyl-THFbound form, this interaction of Arg20A and Glu78A is broken up and the residues are pushed away from each other by the ligand. Arg20A directly stabilizes the carbonyl group of the pteridin ring but still maintains the contact to the C-terminal loop. In DMGO, a glutamate instead of an arginine indirectly binds to the carbonyl position via a bridging water molecule. The residue at position 59B (conserved as Glu, Gln, Asp or Asn) could take over the role of Asp552 in DMGO by stabilizing the N10 position of THF. Ile16B (conserved as Ile/Val), Tyr71A (Tyr/Phe) and Val61B (Val, Met, Leu, Ile) form a hydrophobic pocket for the pteridin ring comparable to Tyr651 and Leu508 in DMGO. In cells, the THF cofactor has a variable length (1-8) of glutamate residues. A number of positively charged residues are found close to the THF-binding pocket, which could stabilize a possible poly-Glu tail of THF.",

We would postulate that Cys447 forms a covalent adduct via the 6 position of the pyrimidine ring of uracil, as also discussed previously (Yim et al, 2003) , and that the formyl group is added to the 5 position. Although the distance between Cys447 and the 5-formyl group of THF of approximately 11 \u00c5 is large, it is not unreasonable to assume that the binding of tRNA, GidA or nucleotide or a combination of these and other as yet unknown factors should induce a conformational change in TrmE large enough to close the gap between the two focal points of the reaction. Proteolytic digest of TrmE leads to major fragments of approximately 36 and 39 kDa. Based on the domain organization of TrmE reported here and the fragmentation pattern found in the crystal, such fragments could correspond to TrmE molecules, which lack either the complete N-terminal domain (1-118, approximately 37 kDa) or the central core of the N-terminal domain (1-102, approximately 39 kDa). In the presence of GTP, TrmE proteolysis produces additional fragments of 28 and 21 kDa, indicating a GTP-induced conformational change. This is supported by experiments with mutants that have a defect in GTP binding and/or GTP hydrolysis and are much less sensitive to further proteolysis (Yim et al, 2003) . The link between the N-terminal domain and the helical part seems to be flexible and accessible for proteases, which is a hint that this region could act as a hinge for the conformational change that brings the Cys and the cofactor THF closer to each other.",

It is not even clear if TrmE alone is sufficient for binding since we have been unable to biochemically demonstrate an interaction between the protein and in vitro-transcribed RNA. We have also not been able to reconstitute the modification reaction of tRNA with purified components. Nevertheless, on the basis of the postulated mechanism (see below), the anticodon loop of tRNA would have to bind near the THF-binding pocket and the catalytic cysteine. Indeed, the region around the invariant Cys447 and Lys449 of the C-terminal motif is the second most highly conserved area of the molecule, and also contains the invariant residues Glu78, His82 and Lys450 ( Figure 4D ), which we show to be required for 5-formyl-THF binding. Moreover, TrmE contains three additional conserved surface patches. While one of these contains the conserved canonical G-domain residues, the other two patches could mark the binding sites of tRNA, GidA or other as yet unidentified components of the reaction. We could speculate that the distance between Cys447 and the conserved tip of the helical domain (55 \u00c5 ) approximately matches the distance between the anticodon loop and the TcC arm (approximately 63 \u00c5 ) or the D arm (approximately 46 \u00c5 ). In human tRNA Lys from MERRF patients, a single point mutation in the TcC arm is responsible for hypomodification at U34 and development of the disease; in MELAS disease, a point mutation in tRNA Leu present in the D arm leads to hypomodification at U34 (Yasukawa et al, 2000a (Yasukawa et al, , b, 2001 .

According to the model, TrmE first activates the 5 position of U34 in tRNA by a mechanism analogous to DNA cytosine-5-methyltransferase or other pyrimidine modification systems. Cys447 would be an active thiolate that nucleophilically attacks the 6 position of uracil and creates a carbanion at the 5 position. This could possibly be aided by the totally invariant lysine in the C-terminal loop whose positive charge would electrostatically stabilize and thus activate the nucleophile. Similar mechanisms have been postulated for a conserved arginine found in thymidylate synthase, which performs a methylation reaction at C5 (Finer-Moore et al, 2003) , or the conserved arginine in protein-tyrosine phosphatases, where a thiolate attacks and cleaves a phosphotyrosine bond (Stone and Dixon, 1994) .",

We have shown here that 5-formyl-THF binds directly to TrmE in a pocket that is very similar to the THF-binding site of the enzyme DMGO and that the binding site would apparently favour the 5-formyl group for the condensation reaction. A nucleophilic attack of the activated base onto the carbonyl of the formyl moiety leads to a transfer of the formyl group onto the 5 position of the uridine base. The developing negative charge on the formyl group could in turn be stabilized by positive charges found in the vicinity of the oxygen of the formyl group (Lys450 and His82). Although in the structure determined here, the catalytic residue Cys447 and the formyl group are 11 \u00c5 apart and thus not close enough to act in common on the uridine base, we would expect that Figure 6 Proposed mechanism for the biosynthetic pathway leading to cmnm 5 U34, taking into account the results presented here. Cys447 of TrmE activates the 5 position of uracil by covalent bond formation to the 6 position. This enables a C1-group transfer from 5-formyl-THF bound in TrmE near the catalytic cysteine residue. Glycine is incorporated, analogous to the incorporation of taurine in H. sapiens (Suzuki et al, 2002) , by a Schiff's base, which is then hydrogenated by GidA, an FAD-containing reduction system, as described in detail in Results. R can be oxygen or sulphur, corresponding to uridine or 2-thiouridine, respectively. binding of tRNA, nucleotide and/or GidA induces a conformational change that brings Cys447 and the formyl group in juxtaposition. It could also be that GTP hydrolysis is necessary to reorganize the active site for formyl transfer (Yim et al, 2003) . Since the GTPase active sites are not close to the formyl transfer site, such a GTPase-induced conformational change might be coupled to or mediated by further binding partners such as tRNA itself, the protein GidA or other as yet unknown components of the reaction pathway.",

            "text": "It has been shown that taurine is directly incorporated into human mitochondrial tRNAs in a modification scheme involving the human homologues of TrmE and GidA by an unknown mechanism (Suzuki et al, 2002) . In analogy to this, we would postulate that glycine is incorporated into the corresponding E. coli tRNAs after the covalent bond between U34 and TrmE is cleaved. Nucleophilic attack of the amine group of glycine onto the formylated uridine leads to the formation of a Schiff's base, which would have to be reduced subsequently to create the product cmnm 5 U34. While the enzyme donating glycine and reducing the Schiff's base is not known, a good candidate for this is the protein GidA. We find GidA from E. coli to have FAD bound as a cofactor (data not shown), as demonstrated for the homologous protein from Myxococcus xanthus (White et al, 2001) , which could be used for reduction of the Schiff's base in an FADH 2 -dependent manner. Since GidA is large enough to harbour more than just an FAD-binding domain, it might also be able to bind and deliver the glycine moiety. The activity of GidA in the whole modification reaction could possibly be regulated by TrmE, as it has previously been reported that TrmE and GidA form a complex (Colby et al, 1998) .",

Flexible regions with weak density are marked with a dashed line (switch I and II). (B) Ribbon presentation of the tertiary structure of TrmE. The N-terminal domain is shown in blue, the central helical domain in green and the G domain in red. The flexible switch regions in the G domain are indicated by dashed lines. The nucleotidebinding motifs and switch regions are marked in purple. (C) Ribbon model of the putative TrmE homodimer in two orientations. Based on the position of the second N-terminal domain (molecule B), the orientation of full-length molecule B was modelled. The homodimerization of TrmE is mainly mediated by the N-terminal domain (blue and light blue). The homodimer has an elongated shape with a size of approximately 130 \u00c5 along the longest axis and approximately 76 or 80 \u00c5 from the N-terminal domains to the G domain or from G domain to G domain, respectively. Putative nucleotide-binding sites are marked by a sphere. (D) Gel filtration of DN-TrmE and full-length TrmE. DN-TrmE elutes with a lower apparent molecular mass (62 kDa) than full-length protein (142 kDa). The equilibrium for DN-TrmE is on the monomer side, whereas full-length protein is present as homodimer.",
