Preproenkephalin A is a precursor of several opioid peptides, the most important being methionine enkephalin (Met-enk \u03ed YGGFM) and leucine enkephalin (Leu-enk \u03ed YGGFL). These two pentapeptides are found in various body tissues and are responsible for a variety of physiological activities in different tissues.

Such attempts include replacement of D amino acids for L amino acids, incorporation of unusual amino acids, and N-methylation of the amide linkages. Another innovative approach is the rational design of inhibitors for enkephalin degrading enzymes. Such compounds will prolong the lifetime of endogenously released enkephalins and may be devoid of the side-effects associated with narcotic drugs. Some of the compounds studied as inhibitors for aminopeptidases are thiorphan, amastatin, bestatin and its analogs, and kelatrophan and its analogs [2, 23, 24] . A recent study from our research group has demonstrated that phosphorylation of the tyrosine residue of Met-enk and Leu-enk leads to increased resistance against the aminopeptidase M (EC 3.4.11.2) activity [9] .",

            "text": "The objective of the present study is to understand the effect of the N-terminal acetylation of enkephalins on the proteolytic activity of aminopeptidases, with a view to identify any potential inhibitory properties of acetylated methionine enkephalin (Ac-Met-enk) and acetylated leucine enkephalins (Ac-Leu-enk) on aminopeptidases action. Aminopeptidases (EC 3.4.11.X) are exopeptidases that can degrade small peptides by sequential removal of free Nterminal amino acids. They are found widely distributed in tissues of many species and are believed to be evolutionary preserved. These enzymes are found in mammalian tissues as well as in the bacterial cells. They occur both as membrane-bound or cytosolic and are mainly metallopeptidases that require Zn 2\u03e9 or other metal ions for their catalytic action or stability. Each type of aminopeptidases has its preferred N terminus that is cleaved more rapidly than the other N terminus. One way of classifying aminopeptidases is to categorize them according to their substrate specificity [26] . In our study, we used porcine kidney aminoeptidase M (EC 3.4.11.2), mainly because it plays a prominent role in degradation of enkephalins and it has been used for similar studies previously [9] . Benter et al. have shown that, in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), this enzyme plays a significant role in the degradation of low molecular weight enkephalins [3] . Based on the substrate and inhibition profiles of the CSF aminopeptidase activity, they were able to rule out the involvement of several other characterized aminopeptidases. Porcine aminopeptidase M has a molecular mass of 280 kDa and is composed of 10 subunits. It has five disulfide bridges each connecting two sub units [10] . Recently, porcine aminopeptidase M also was identified as a receptor for the transmissible gastroenterovirus (corona virus TGEV), a major pathogen causing fatal diarrhea in newborn pigs [11] .",

The predominant degradation product for both the substrates, however, is Ac-Tyr. The des-Ac-Tyr products were not detected perhaps because of the longer time interval (1 h) between two consecutive samplings. During this time interval, the initially formed GGFM (or GGFL) is hydrolyzed rapidly by sequential removal of the terminal amino acids. Therefore, the progress of the reaction was monitored based on the Ac-Tyr peak area. It is likely that other amino acids, especially Phe, generated during hydrolysis of acetylated enkephalins may coelute with Ac-Tyr.

It was observed that Ac-Leu-enk is not as strong an inhibitor of the aminopeptidase M activity on the hydrolysis of Leu-enk as Ac-Met-enk is on the corresponding reaction of Met-enk. This observation is consistent with the fact that Ac-Leu-enk has lower affinity for aminopeptidase M compared to Ac-Met-enk (compare the V max values shown above). Also, no inhibition activity was found when Ac-Met-enk and Ac-Leu-enk were interchanged as inhibitors for the aminopeptidase M activity on Leu-enk and Met-enk, respectively. This intriguing observation can also be explained partially on the basis of relative affinities of Metenk and Leu-enk for aminopeptidase M. Benter et al. [3] have reported that V max for the hydrolysis of the Tyr-Gly bond in human CSF is higher for Leu-enk (2.0 nmol/min/ ml) than for Met-enk (400 pmol/min/ml).",

            "text": "The knowledge of the type of inhibition also may provide some explanation why Ac-Met-enk inhibits the hydrolysis of Met-enk and not Leu-enk. Inhibitors are classified as competitive, noncompetitive, uncompetitive, and mixed type [5, 16, 20] . Each type exhibits a characteristic deviation from the typical Lineweaver-Burk plot of the uninhibited reaction. Competitive inhibitors inhibit the enzyme action by binding to the same active site as the substrate. They increase the K m but do not affect V max . With noncompetitive type inhibitors, V max is decreased but K m remains unaffected. The noncompetitive inhibitors and the substrate bind to the enzyme reversibly, randomly, and independently at different sites. A pure uncompetitive inhibitor binds reversibly to the enzyme-substrate complex yielding an inactive enzyme-substrate-inhibitor complex. Its behavior is characterized by the decrease in both K m and V max . The corresponding Lineweaver-Burk plot of the uncompetitive inhibition runs parallel to the plot of the noninhibited reaction. Unlike the competitive inhibition, the degree of inhibition increases with the increase in the substrate concentration in the uncompetitive inhibition because the enzyme is inactivated by the formation of an enzyme-substrate-unhibitor complex. If more than one of the above mechanisms are operative at the same time, the resulting inhibition is called mixed type, which is characterized by change in both K m and V max . Experiment 3 was performed to determine the type of inhibition and the corresponding inhibition constant. The data presented in Figs. 6 and 7 and Table 2 confirm that Ac-Met-enk can indeed inhibit aminopeptidase M-catalyzed hydrolysis of Met-enk. The presence of the uncompetitive inhibitor component is indicated clearly by the decrease in both K m (from 0.8 to 0.3 mM) and V max (from 130 to 80 nmol/min/50 ng). The observation that the inhibition activity is prominent at higher substrate concentrations further supports this evidence. The Lineweaver-Burk plot (Fig. 7) , however, does not obey the typical pattern (the plots of both inhibited and uninhibited reactions should be parallel) of a pure noncompetitive inhibition. Therefore, the possibility of more than one mechanism exists. The deviation observed in Fig. 7 has been identified previously as due to a mixed type of inhibition [20] , in which the inhibitor binds to the enzyme as well as to the enzyme-substrate complex. The inhibitor forms a dead-end complex by binding to the enzyme and reduces the total amount of enzyme molecules. It is likely that initial enzyme-Met-enk complex leads to favorable conformation in aminopeptidase M for binding to Ac-Metenk. Because Ac-Met-enk does not behave like competitive inhibitors, it is unable to inhibit the aminopeptidase Mcatalyzed hydrolysis of Leu-enk.",
