In light of this, the differential diagnoses for emesis in ferrets include both esophageal diseases and gastroenteric disorders. In the clinical history, vomiting is not as frequently described in ferrets as it is in canine or feline patients. For example, ferrets rarely vomit hairballs, and often vomiting is not part of the history associated with foreign body ingestion. The reason for this is unclear. No anatomic feature prevents emesis in ferrets; in fact, ferrets have long been laboratory animal models for human emesis studies because vomiting can readily be induced in them in a laboratory setting. 14 The major differential diagnoses for vomiting or regurgitation in ferrets include the presence of a GI foreign body, H. mustelae gastritis, gastroenteritis, and, rarely, megaesophagus. It is uncommon for ferrets with metabolic problems such as azotemia or hepatic disease to vomit. Although definitive diagnosis is not always possible, it is important to recognize whether medical or surgical treatment is required. For example, most obstructions caused by a foreign body require surgery, whereas gastroenteritis is a medical disease. However, differentiating these two diagnoses is often quite challenging (see Table 3 -1).",

It is antigenically related and biochemically similar to H. pylori, a human pathogen associated with gastritis and ulcers. 21 Colonization of the antral area of the stomach and pyloric area of the duodenum with H. mustelae is very common in domestic ferrets, unless they are specifically treated or hand reared in isolation. 12, 17 Colonization is accompanied by a specific immune response, but infection persists despite high serum antibody titers. 17 Although infection is common, clinical gastritis and ulcers occur relatively infrequently. Severe gastritis may be evident in gastric biopsy samples from ferrets showing no signs of clinical disease. 17 The histopathologic lesions of H. mustelae-associated gastritis in human beings and ferrets consist of mucus depletion, gland loss and regeneration, and leukocyte infiltration. The organism can be observed in silver-stained histologic sections of gastric mucosa. 21 Affected ferrets that die usually have a single large pyloric ulcer or many small ones (Fig. 3-7) , and the stomach and intestinal tract contain digested blood and mucus, causing the ingesta to appear very dark. Cultures of H. mustelae from fecal samples are usually difficult to obtain, even when the organism is readily identified histologically in gastric biopsy samples.",

            "text": "In humans, chronic infection with H. pylori leads to different clinical and pathologic outcomes, including chronic gastritis, peptic ulcer disease, and gastric neoplasia. 42 The severity and distribution of the H. pylori-induced inflammation are key deter-FERRETS minants of these outcomes. Gastritis involving the antrum is associated with excessive acid secretion and a high risk of duodenal ulcer. Gastritis involving the acid-secreting corpus region of the stomach is associated with hypochlorhydria, gastric atrophy, and increased risk of gastric cancer. 41 As in humans infected with H. pylori, transient hypochlorhydria develops in ferrets approximately 4 weeks after experimental infection. 36 This condition probably facilitates fecal-oral transmission as well as recovery of H. mustelae from feces. 37 Hypochlorhydria is associated with urease production, which is detectable in gastric biopsy samples. It also correlates with the degree of colonization and the occurrence of gastritis in biopsy results. 17 Urease production is associated with the ability of H. mustelae to colonize the stomach, with non-urease-producing strains being nonpathogenic. 17 A urease breath test is available for humans to aid in diagnosis, and a similar test has been used in ferrets under research conditions but is not practical for clinical use. 37 H. mustelae inhibits secretion of acid by parietal cells in vitro, and this mechanism may also contribute to hypochlorhydria. 21 In humans, chronic infection with H. pylori is associated with release of cytokines that impair function of enterochromaffin cells, which are neuroendocrine cells in the gastric mucosa that control acid secretion by releasing histamine. The impaired secretory function of these cells may predispose to hypochlorhydria and gastric carcinogenesis. 45 Gastrin is a hormone that stimulates gastric acid secretion and is secreted by the G cells of the gastric antrum. In humans and probably in ferrets, high levels of gastrin may initiate GI mucosal damage and ulceration. Hypergastrinemia is probably a response to the presence of H. mustelae in the antrum or to its associated inflammation. Hypergastrinemia is abolished after antibiotic therapy eradicates the Helicobacter infection. 17 In humans, Helicobacter-associated gastritis has been implicated as a risk factor for gastric adenocarcinoma and gastric lymphoma. 17 There is some evidence that this is also the case in ferrets. As H. pylori does in humans, 32 infection with H. mustelae in ferrets apparently stimulates cell proliferation in the gastric mucosa. 22 Under research conditions, gastric adenocar-cinoma eventually developed in ferrets that were naturally infected with H. mustelae and treated with a known gastric carcinogen. 17 Spontaneously occurring gastric adenocarcinoma has been reported in pet ferrets. Although H. mustelae was neither cultured from the lesions nor identified histologically in some cases, 47, 51, 53 in others, silver-stained organisms that were morphologically compatible with H. mustelae were present in the neoplastic tissues. 22 Lymphoid follicles (mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue [MALT]) are observed in the gastric mucosa of humans colonized with H. pylori 59 and in that of ferrets colonized with H. mustelae 21 but not in uninfected individuals. In humans this condition may progress to MALT lymphoma. Eradicating H. pylori usually causes early tumors to regress, implicating the infection as the cause of neoplasia. 58, 59 Gastric MALT lymphoma associated with H. mustelae infection has also been reported in four ferrets 5 to 10 years of age. 12 None of the affected ferrets were treated with antibiotics to eradicate H. mustelae either before or during the illness associated with neoplasia.",

However, clinical disease develops in only a small percentage (usually 1%-3%) of group-housed juvenile ferrets. Improvements in the quality of care and nutrition of pet ferrets may be responsible for the apparently decreasing incidence of PBD in recent years.",

Because the disease in ferrets resembles that in other species, prednisone administration has been the treatment of choice. 43 Remission has occurred in ferrets treated with prednisone (1.25-2.5 mg/kg PO q24h for 7 days and q48h thereafter) until the ferret is clinically normal. Immediate recovery also followed removal of an enlarged mesenteric lymph node in one ferret and treatment with ivermectin (0.4 mg/kg SC) in another. 43 When eosinophilic gastroenteritis is a response to the presence of a parasite, eliminating the parasite is preferable to prolonged treatment with corticosteroids to relieve clinical signs.",

These animals are often very weak and may allow a saphenous or cephalic catheter to be inserted with little resistance. Among the advantages of giving intravenous fluids is that glucose can be administered by this route. However, if a catheter cannot be placed, fluids administered subcutaneously are well and rapidly absorbed. Hospitalize an emaciated, dehydrated ferret until fluid and electrolyte balances are reestablished. When the life-threatening episode is over, the owner will probably be willing and able to give the supportive care needed to restore the ferret to health.",

If the ferret is treated for only one disease when it has both, the time required for recognizing treatment failure may be the factor that ultimately decides if the ferret will survive. Unfortunately, the effective drugs used for treatment of the two diseases are different, and therapy necessitates multiple daily doses of several drugs for at least 2 weeks. Because the gut flora of ferrets is very simple and plays no vital role in digestion, long-term administration of broadspectrum antibiotics does not cause diarrhea in ferrets as it does in most animals. Emaciated animals that die despite proper treatment usually have either very extensive gastric ulcers or severe ileitis, each of which drastically reduces the absorption of essential nutrients. Age of the animal may help in the differential diagnosis; young ferrets are more likely to develop PBD, whereas older ferrets can develop severe, chronic gastritis associated with H. mustelae infection. 24 Also, H. mustelae-associated disease is more often associated with stress factors common in mature pet ferrets, such as concurrent disease or surgery (see Table 3 -1).",

Some animals refuse to eat their regular diet of dry pellets but do accept the same food mixed with water and heated in a microwave until it develops a porridge-like consistency. Some ferrets eat meat baby foods, especially liver and chicken, and most drink milk. Milk causes loose stool in normal ferrets and in those with colitis, but it is very palatable. If milk fat is increased to 10% to 20% with cream, it appears to be absorbed well and contributes to weight gain even though diarrhea continues. Most sick ferrets accept Nutri-Cal (Tomlyn, Buena, NJ) at numerous times during the day. Many ferrets like the human food supplements such as Ensure Plus (Abbott Laboratories, Ross Products Division, Columbus, OH), Boost Plus (formerly Sustacal; Bristol Myers, Evansville, IN), or Isocal HN (Mead Johnston, Evansville, IN), and they sometimes eat softened pellets mixed with one of these products when they refuse pellets alone. Alternatively, offer nutritional recovery foods such as Maximum-Calorie (The Iams Company, Dayton, OH) or Canine a/d (Hill's Pet Nutrition); most sick ferrets accept these foods readily. Nutritional recovery diets such as Max-Cal can be used as the sole source of nutrition for weeks at a time if necessary. When using these diets, calculate a minimum daily intake of 400 kcal per kilogram of body weight. Sick ferrets may not make the effort to get up and drink from a water bottle but do usually drink from a dish. Offer fresh food and water by hand several times daily during hospitalization and home care; ferrets often take a few mouthfuls of every new offering but never go back for more. The first 2 days are critical for an animal that has lost 40% to 50% of its body weight, and intensive supportive care is essential.",
