To date, three genotypes of hunniviruses have been officially proposed by the ICTV, including one hunnivirus isolated from sheep cell cultures in Northern Ireland in 1965 (https:// talk.ictvonline.org/ictv/proposals/2013.008a-dV.A.v2.Hunnivirus.pdf) and bovine and ovine hunniviruses identified in Hungary during 2008 and 2009 . From 2014 to 2016, hunniviruses have also been detected in rats in America and China, revealing new hunnivirus genotypes (Du et al., 2016; Firth et al., 2014) .",

According to this principle, the novel feline picornavirus found in our study was classified into the newly established genus Hunnivirus. Homology analysis for the FeHuV polyprotein gene showed 70.8%-83.5%, 68.8%, and 68.9% nucleotide homology with rat hunnivirus, bovine hunnivirus, and ovine hunnivirus, respectively. This finding indicates that FeHuV is substantially genetically divergent from other hunniviruses. It is thus proposed as a novel Hunnivirus A genotype.",

Using this primer pair, new numbers classified in the genus Kobuvirus have been determined in various animals, including sheep, goat, dog, deer, wolf, fox, and cat (Chung et al., 2013; Di Martino et al., 2013; Di Martino et al., 2015b; Di Martino et al., 2014; Melegari et al., 2018; Oem et al., 2014; Reuter et al., 2010) . However, these primers are more generic for picornavirus Lu, et al. Infection, Genetics and Evolution 71 (2019) 47-50 than for kobuvirus . One novel quail picornavirus and two novel hunniviruses, bovine hunnivirus and ovine hunnivirus, were identified in 2012 using UNIV-kobu-F/UNIV-kobu-R Reuter et al., 2012) . Our study further confirmed the universal applicability of UNIV-kobu-F/UNIV-kobu-R in determining novel picornaviruses. The family Picornaviridae contains clinically important human and animal pathogens and is associated with a series of diseases in the central nervous system, respiratory tract, heart, liver, pancreas, skin and eye (Zell, 2017) . However, the transmission routes and pathogenicity of hunniviruses have not been investigated. Both bovine and ovine hunniviruses have been detected in apparently healthy animals. In contrast, FeHuV in this study was detected in diarrheic animals. Further analyses are needed to isolate FeHuV and to clarify its transmission route and relationship with diarrhea in an animal model as well as to assess its zoonotic potential. In summary, a novel hunnivirus was identified in cats, expanding the host range of hunniviruses. Genomic sequencing and analysis indicated that this hunnivirus is a new genotype. Continued and more large-scale surveillance of this hunnivirus in cat populations is necessary to assess the pathogenicity and risk of zoonotic transmission of this novel pathogen.",
