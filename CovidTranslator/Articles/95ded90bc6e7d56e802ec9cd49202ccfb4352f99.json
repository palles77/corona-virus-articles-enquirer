            "text": "L-type lectins (LTLs) belong to the lectin family and are characterized by a conserved structural motif in their carbohydrate recognition domain. LTLs are homologous to leguminous lectins. In this study, we identified and functionally characterized an LTL from kuruma shrimp Marsupenaeus japonicus. We designated this LTL as MjLTL2. MjLTL2 contains a signal peptide, a Lectin_leg domain, a coiled coil, and transmembrane domain. MjLTL2 is distributed in hemocytes, heart, hepatopancreas, gill, stomach, and intestine; higher expression levels are seen in hemocytes and the hepatopancreas than in other tissues. MjLTL2 was upregulated following challenge of shrimp with Vibrio anguillarum and white spot syndrome virus (WSSV). MjLTL2 can agglutinate several bacteria without Ca 2+ . In addition, MjLTL2 could bind to several Gram-positive and -negative bacteria by binding to their lipopolysaccharide and peptidoglycan. However, MjLTL2 could not enhance the clearance of V. anguillarum in vivo. In the presence of WSSV infection, MjLTL2 knockdown by RNA interference resulted in a 7day lower cumulative mortality of M. japonicus. Moreover, less VP19, VP24, VP26, and VP28 mRNAs were extracted from the hemocytes of MjLTL2 knockdown shrimp than from the control. These results suggest that MjLTL2 is involved in immune responses in shrimp.",

Based on their conserved structure and functions, lectins can be categorized into 13 families, including chitinase-like, P-type, C-type, I-type, calnexin/calreticulin, L-type, R-type, F-box lectins, ficolins, intelectins, galectins, Mtype, and F-type lectins [2] . The L-type lectin (LTL) family was the earliest lectin family to be discovered from the seeds of leguminous plants, which contain LTL-like domain] [3] . Four kinds of LTLs have been found in mammals: 36 kDa vesicular integral membrane protein (VIP36), ER-Golgi intermediate compartment 53 kDa protein (ERGIC-53), ERGIC-53-like (ERGL) LTL, and VIP36-like (VIPL) LTL [4] . ERGIC-53 is a cargo receptor for the transport of glycoproteins from the ER to the ERGIC [5] . In this study, we characterized a novel LTL, a homolog of ERGIC-53, from shrimp Marsupenaeus japonicus.",

WSSV can infect more than 93 species of shrimp and prawn [13] , including Litopenaeus vannamei, Penaeus monodon, and M. japonicas [14] . The cumulative mortality of shrimp could approach 100% in 7-10 days after WSSV infection. WSSV causes massive economic damage to shrimp farming worldwide [15] . WSSV is a capsulecoated virus; its four major envelope proteins, namely, VP24, VP28, VP26, and VP19, can form a protein complex [16] [17] [18] [19] . VP24, as a chitin-binding protein and the most abundant among the envelope proteins of WSSV, acts as a core protein interacting with other structure proteins and plays an important role in virus assembly and infection https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fsi.2020.01.022 Received 5 July 2019; Received in revised form 8 January 2020; Accepted 12 January 2020 [20] . The absence of VP24 in WSSV-CN04, a new WSSV strain, can attenuate WSSV's peroral infectivity [21] . LvAMP13.4, a cuticle protein gene, helps WSSV invade cells by interacting with VP24 [22] . VP28 is another important structural protein in claw crayfish Cherax quadricarinatus. Laminin receptor could bind to VP28 and help WSSV enter the host cell. Loss-of-function of the CqLR-like gene can result in strong inhibition of WSSV entry and viral replication [23] .",

MjLTL2 was constitutively expressed in hemocytes, heart, hepatopancreas, gills, stomach, and intestine. MjLTL2 can bind to several Gram-positive (G + ) and Gram-negative(G -) bacteria by binding to their lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and peptidoglycan (PGN). MjLTL2 knockdown can result in lower cumulative mortality and slower WSSV replication. Indeed, this paper is the first to report an L-type lectin from M. japonicus that participates in WSSV replication and, thus, provides a new approach to understand the multiplication of WSSV.",

            "text": "The mechanism of MjLTL2 in WSSV replication may involve the unfolded protein response (UPR). UPR is activated to alleviate ER stress [38] and consists of three signaling pathways that contribute to reducing the accumulation of unfolded or misfolded proteins in the ER lumen [39] . One of the UPR signal pathways is the activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) pathway. LvATF6 significantly upregulates the expression of many WSSV genes, such as wsv045 and wsv343, and could inhibit apoptosis for WSSV replication [40] . As indicated by a previous study, the homolog of ATF\u03b1 from M. japonicus is vital for WSSV replication, and UPR in M. japonicus may facilitate WSSV infection [41] . ERGIC-53 is a target of the ATF6 pathway of UPR [42] . PcL-lectin, a homolog of ERGIC-53, may interact with VP24 and is required for the multiplication of WSSV [12] . As a homolog of ERGIC-53, MjLTL2 may be a target of MjATF6 in M. japonicus and participate in WSSV proliferation. The exact mechanism underlying MjLTL2-WSSV replication remains unclear and must be determined in future research.",
