Given the rapid increase of COVID-19 in Europe, it is urgent to understand the transmissibility and mortality in key European countries to guide the implementation of prioritized prevention and control measures. The realtime reproduction number (R(t)), defined as the number of secondary cases one case would produce over the course of the outbreak, is useful to monitor the transmissibility of COVID-19 over time.(3) Therefore, R(t) calculates the effective reproduction number when immunity intervention measures are implemented. By contrast, the basic reproduction number (R0) is the reproduction number when no immunity from past exposures or vaccination, nor any deliberate intervention in disease transmission has been carried out. As a result, it is more appropriate to use R(t) to monitor the real-time transmissibility when public measures are in place. The case fatality rate (CFR) can be used to measure the mortality rate.",

Real-time monitoring of deaths related to newly confirmed cases of COVID-19 is of significance in Spain and France. European and local authorities should investigate and learn from Germany on how to remain a low mortality rate. There are several limitations to keep in mind when interpreting the results. First, due to limited laboratory capacity, the actual epidemic may not be reflected by counts of laboratory-confirmed cases reported. Second, the estimation of the reproduction number is heavily dependent on generation time, which may be hard to obtain in an early outbreak. Third, fitting the real-life epidemic curve to the statistical model is challenging. Fourth, the constant assumption of CFR may be violated if a new treatment emerges or more mild cases are identified over the course of the epidemic.",

Special attention should be paid to Italy to understand the effects of the country lockdown on the spread of COVID-19 both within and outside Italy.
