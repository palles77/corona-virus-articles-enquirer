CTP synthetase catalyses the last step in the biosynthesis of pyrimidine ribonucleoside 5'-triphosphates, that is the conversion of UTP to CTP (Fig. 2) . There is circumstantial evidence for the role of CTPsynthetase as target for the cytocidal activity of Ce-Cyd. As has been demonstrated in several cell lines, i.e. murine is closely correlated with the cytocidal activity of the compound. The depletion of CTP pools is most likely due to the inhibition of CTP synthetase, and, in fact, the triphosphates of both C-Cyd [9] and Ce-Cyd [14] have been shown to inhibit CTP synthetase. CTP pools were not measured in the host cells (i.e. PRK, HEL, Vero) used for the antiviral assays. However, we surmise that, since in all cell systems examined thus far [12] [13] [14] 40, 41] CTP pools are depleted as a consequence of Ce-Cyd treatment, this may also be the case for the cells used in the present study. At the concentrations at which Ce-Cyd was found effective in inhibiting virus-induced cytopathogenicity [for vaccinia virus, a concentration as low as 0.08 PM (Table l) ], it causes a significant reduction in CTP pools [12-14.40,41] .",

If viruses or tumor cells impose similar requirements on some essential metabolites for their growth, one may expect that a shortage in the supply of these metabolites leads to suppression of both virus growth and tumor cell growth. Through its inhibitory effect on CTP synthetase, Ce-Cyd abrogates the CTP supply that is needed for both virus replication and tumor cell growth. Consequently, both the antiviral and cytocidal effects of the compound are reversed if the CTP pools are restored by the exogenous addition of cytidine.",

It could be argued that the antitumor and antiviral properties of Ce-Cyd may be mutually exclusive. This is certainly not the case if the antiviral and antitumor (or cytocidal) assays are conducted under different conditions, that is with resting confluent cells for the antiviral assays and exponentially growing cells for the cytocidal assays. Under these conditions, Ce-Cyd exhibits antiviral activity at concentrations which are by several orders of magnitude lower than the concentrations that are toxic to the host cells. If, however, rapidly growing cells have to be used to monitor antiviral activity, as is the case for HIV, the toxicity of the compound for the host (MT-4) cells precludes any specific action against the virus. If these considerations are extrapolated to the in vivo situation, it follows that, if Ce-Cyd were to be used as an antiviral drug, proper conditions have to be conceived so as to prevent the toxic effect of the compound on rapidly growing cells (i.e. bone marrow, small intestine). This goal may well be achieved by site-specific delivery whereby the drug is directly delivered to the site of virus infection, i.e. if the compound is administered as an aerosol in the treatment of virus infections of the respiratory tract.",

Pyrazofurin may be too toxic for systemic administration, but, as an aerosol, it may prove particularly useful, not only in the treatment of RSV infection, but also in the treatment of other respiratory tract virus infections. The high potency and wide-spectrum activity of pyrazofurin [26-281 and Ce-Cyd (Table 1) against 10. ortho-and paramyxoviruses in vitro make these compounds attractive candidates in the pursuit of an effective chemotherapy of respiratory virus 11. infections.",
