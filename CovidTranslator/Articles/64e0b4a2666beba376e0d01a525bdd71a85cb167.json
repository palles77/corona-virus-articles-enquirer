These efforts often involve the endorsement of personal responsibility for infection risk, thus reinforcing an individualistic model of public health. Some scholars-for example, Peterson and Lupton (1996)-term this model the Bnew public health.^In this essay, I describe how the focus on personal responsibility for infection risk shapes the promotion of hand hygiene and other forms of illness etiquette. My analysis underscores the use of constitutive and stigmatizing rhetoric to depict individual bodies, rather than environments, as prime sources of infection. Common among workplaces, this rhetoric provides the impetus for encouraging individual behavior change as a hedge against infection risk. I argue, though, that the mandating of personal responsibility for infection risk galvanizes a culture of stigma and blame that may work against the aims of public health.",

            "text": "This essay contributes to the ongoing examination among rhetoricians of health and medicine of constructions of responsibility and risk. 2 Specifically, I explore the centrality of a rhetoric of personal responsibility to discursive efforts to manage infection risk. Health humanities scholars and rhetoricians of health and medicine share a common concern for the ethical issues that arise from risk-management exercises undertaken in the name of public health. 3 Practitioners, too, have a stake in more detailed understandings of the impact of risk discourse on the formation of health subjectivity. However, as Ker\u00e4nen (2014b) explains in the Health Humanities Reader, Ba rhetorical perspective focuses on how specific symbolic patterns structure meaning and action^in health and public-health contexts (37). Writing for this journal, for example, Ding (2014b) stresses the economic and sociocultural effects of media portrayals of Bat risk^populations during severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). 4 My essay contributes to this scholarship with an account of how messaging that seeks to engage publics in outbreak management shapes their perceptions of responsibility and risk, not to mention of public health. As I argue, handwashing campaigns reinforce an individualistic model of public health, one premised to a significant extent on the necessity of behavior change rather than structural intervention. Some scholars-for example, Peterson and Lupton (1996) -term this model the Bnew public health.P ersonal responsibility serves essential functions in response to the threat of infection. However, the mandating of personal responsibility for infection risk has the potential to galvanize a culture of stigma and blame. Too narrow a focus on personal responsibility may also diminish perceptions of the effectiveness of improved structural supports for those infected. During H1N1, for example, universal paid sick leave became a topic of debate, serving as a reminder of the need for an environment supportive of individual efforts to manage infection risk. In this essay, I characterize hand hygiene promotion as both a Bconstitutive rhetoric^and a Bstigmatizing rhetoric.^Whereas a constitutive rhetoric encourages action through the cultivation of subjectivity, a stigmatizing rhetoric uses stigma to shape perceptions-also typically for the sake of influencing behavior change. I also describe how scholars of rhetoric of health and medicine have employed these two theories and explain their value to health humanities practitioners and scholars. I then examine the uses of constitutive and stigmatizing rhetoric in a U.S. state-level campaign to enforce Bhygienic norms^(including, importantly, hand hygiene) within the workplace. My analysis reveals the centrality of stigma and blame to these efforts to encourage the assumption of personal responsibility.",

So, why might those of us who have been exposed to these campaigns concern ourselves, perhaps unnecessarily, with their implications for our views of risk, responsibility, and public health? The reason I turn to in my conclusion is that the rhetorical means used to encourage personal responsibility may obscure perceptions of more effective approaches to the management of infection risk. Handwashing campaigns also create opportunities to profit from and even exploit the stigma and blame that these texts associate with failures of personal responsibility. My goal, then, is mainly to explore the limits of personal responsibility-not just as an approach to infection risk, but more generally as a cornerstone of twenty-first-century public health.",

In this essay, I use Bhandwashing campaigns^and Bhand hygiene promotion\u00ee nterchangeably to describe the discursive encouragement of this habit. I also focus mainly on hand hygiene promotion within North America, where amid H1N1 handwashing campaigns and hand hygiene products alike became endemic. Commenting on this trend in a New Yorker essay, Owen (2013) links the phenomenal success of Gojo Industry's blockbuster hand sanitizer, Purell, to anxieties about infection risk. 5 Today, hand sanitizer is a product category in its own right, and its popularity is sometimes regarded critically as both indicative of and responsible for a distinct shift in cultural perceptions of infection risk. 6 In my view, however, Purell's unprecedented sales figures 7 are inextricably tied both to the increased promotion of hand hygiene in recent decades and to the ongoing individualization of public health.",

Hand hygiene is a vital form of infection control, and as such, it is also an ethical practice, particularly during an outbreak. Rather than argue against hand hygiene, I explore the limits of hand hygiene promotion, as well as its implication in the deepening entrenchment of the new public health. In this respect, my essay draws its inspiration from the work of Metzl, who in the introduction to his co-edited multidisciplinary anthology Against Health, writes that health is a Bdesired state, but it is also a prescribed state and an ideological position^(2010, 2). The same argument applies to public health, which broadly speaking entails the strategic, organized effort to Bpersuade a defined public to engage in behaviors that that will improve health or refrain from behaviors that are unhealthy^ (Springston 2013, 713) . Hand hygiene promotion especially invites further scrutiny because its prescriptive, ideological qualities far too often go unnoticed. Hence, I focus my attention here on describing how handwashing campaigns benefit the overarching emphasis on personal responsibility for infection risk.",

In fact, just as in North America, hand hygiene promotion directed at publics in developing countries aims to empower these publics to protect themselves from the risk of infection. Since 2008, for example, Global Handwashing Day has been celebrated annually on October 5.

            "text": "Underwritten by an array of corporate sponsors, Global Handwashing Day also teaches people living in developing countries to become faithful consumers of hand sanitizer and soap, just like their counterparts in developed countries. Current sponsors include Colgate-Palmolive, Procter and Gamble, and Unilever, all companies with a massive stake in the global marketplace for personal hygiene products. (Corporate sponsors may also have influenced the naming of the Global Public-Private Partnership for Handwashing with Soap. Even the scholarship produced by the researchers working for this partnership typically includes this addendum.) Global Handwashing Day's instruction in the consumption of personal hygiene products, too, has ties to the overarching emphasis on personal responsibility that defines the new public health. Hand hygiene is promoted as a Bdo-it-yourself vaccine,^a hedge against infection risk (apparently) even in settings in which infection risk often stems from poor sanitation and lack of access to clean water. 10 Of course, regardless of context, hygiene habits have a proven impact on the transmission of disease-causing pathogens. Hand hygiene limits the spread of diarrheal and respiratory diseases, which are among the leading causes of child mortality in developing countries. 11 Children thus comprise a key audience for Global Handwashing Day, which seeks to transform them into Bchange agents^who have the capacity to Bpositively influence other people's health behaviours^ (Global PPPHW 2015) . However, as Plyushteva observes, Global Handwashing Day's celebration of the life-saving power of individual behavior change potentially obscures understandings of the structural factors that shape infection risk. In developing countries, for example, the spread of disease stems from lack of access to clean water and adequate waste disposal and not mainly from a lack of agency per se. In tying infection risk to the Bsuboptimal behaviour of the poor^(2009, 428), handwashing campaigns in developing countries exacerbate longstanding power imbalances, potentially reinforcing rather than removing obstacles to meaningful change. At the same time, hand hygiene promotion in this context expands the global marketplace for personal hygiene products, forging new opportunities to profit from the intractable problem of infectious disease.",

Some of these motivations in fact conflict with the aims of public health, particularly in developing countries. BAt first glance,^she argues, Bthe cause of handwashing appears as apolitical and uncontroversial as can be^(428). So unproblematic is hand hygiene, and so important are efforts to promote it, that the very few criticisms of Global Handwashing Day have largely been ignored. 12 For her part, Plyushteva takes issue with the celebration's stigmatizing of people in developing countries Bas traditional or backward, or, in a teleological view of development, pre-modern^(424). Hand hygiene's Buncontroversial fa\u00e7ade^(420) also obscures the reality that individual behavior change is only ever a Bpartial solution^(429) to the spread of disease. Efforts to quell the spread of disease through behavior change also depend on the implementation of structural interventions-changes that create an environment supportive of personal responsibility. (I return to these limitations of personal responsibility in my conclusion.) I quote Plyushteva at length because hers is the most recent scholarly critique of contemporary, globalized efforts to promote hand hygiene promotion. 13 Her writing establishes a precedent for my critique of North American handwashing campaigns, which may also do more, politically and economically, than simply diminish the risk of infection. Circulated within workplaces, schools, transit hubs, airports, community centers, groceries stores, and shopping malls, handwashing campaigns portray individual bodies, and body parts, as dangerous vectors of infectious disease. What makes these bodies, and parts, dangerous is both that they spread infection and because the disease-causing pathogens they transmit remain invisible to the individuals who transmit them. As a caption for a handwashing poster created by Yale University's Emergency Management Department in 2009, in response to H1N1, puts it, BYou've got a mystery on your hands.T aking the form of pamphlets, posters, transit ads, web infographics, social media campaigns, and public service announcements, these texts caution that the power to prevent (and spread) infection is in our hands. Sales figures for hand sanitizer alone illustrate the impressive new revenue streams generated by this individualization of infection risk. Even in developed countries, where the assumption of personal responsibility is less likely to be impeded by structural issues, hand hygiene promotion may nevertheless skew perceptions of contextual or social determinants of infection risk. Most notable among these factors may be the availability of sick leave or the effects on susceptibility of feelings of anxiety or stress.",

These infographics teach handwashing methods, but they also serve to emphasize the need for personal responsibility in public settings. Indeed, at another level, many handwashing campaigns often serve more expressly rhetorical goals. The most effective-and the most problematic-is the use of hand hygiene promotion to exacerbate a whole host of negative emotions, from anxiety, distrust, fear, and doubt to nausea and disgust. Some of the most prominent voices behind the turn to hand hygiene promotion, particularly in developed countries, have emphatically defended the rhetorical utility of public health campaigns that inspire feelings of disgust. 14 In my close reading, I focus more on this latter function of handwashing campaign-that is, its use to foster emotional states that predispose audiences to the adoption of personal responsibility.",

Personal failure is generally attributed to personal failings, and the victim is all too often blamed^ (2005, 76) . Harvey's account stresses the economic advantages of the neoliberal emphasis on personal responsibility. Indeed, a neoliberal approach to infection risk has both shifted attention away from costlier programs of outbreak management and accorded private stakeholders unparalleled economic advantages. Arguably, the main benefactors of personal responsibility for infection risk are the corporations that develop and distribute products in support of illness etiquette. Yet the recent popularity of hand sanitizer does more than reflect the successful marketing of hand hygiene as an antidote to both uncertainty and infection.

Noncompliance with the dictates of hand hygiene promotion becomes grounds not merely for blame but also for suspicion about a person's moral worth. Contemporary handwashing campaigns thus form a constitutive rhetoric, a mode of rhetorical appeal that calls into existence a shared collective identity. Within hand hygiene promotion, the collectivity identity called into existence is that of the health citizen for whom participation in containing an outbreak is a personal responsibility. 15 White describes Bconstitutive rhetoric^(a term that he coined) as Bthe central art by which culture and community are established, maintained, and transformed^ (1985, 28) . Scholars use constitutive rhetoric to explain the discursive formation of new social and political subjectivities. In demonstrating how some rhetorics discursively constitute the very subjects they address, many critics follow Charland's model of constitutive rhetoric (1987) . 16 Into White's theory, Charland incorporates Burke's notion of identification (1969) and Althusser's idea of interpellation, or Bhailing^(1971). As Charland observes, constitutive appeals produce and reinforce new subject positions (1987) . By responding to these appeals, individuals affirm their membership in the community.",

Majdik and Platt describe the health subject constituted by the marketing campaign for a genetic testing product (2012).

The adoption of illness etiquette in response to hand hygiene promotion thus signals at least a partial acceptance of the new public health. 18 Because it singles out the individual bodies-and individual body partsthat spread infection, hand hygiene promotion might be understood as both a constitutive rhetoric and a Bstigmatizing rhetoric.^Proposed by Metzl in Against Health (2010) and premised on the writings of Goffman ([1963] 1986), a stigmatizing rhetoric derives its conception of the Bhealthy^from portrayals of the Bunhealthy.^In other words, notions of poor health shore up understandings of good health. As Metzl asserts, within a stigmatizing rhetoric, the Baffirmation of one's own health depends on the constant recognition, and indeed the creation, of the spoiled health of others^ (2010, 5) . Taking up Metzl's refrain, some of the contributors to the multidisciplinary anthology, Against Health, critique the centrality of stigmatizing rhetoric to a neoliberal model of public health. LeBesco, for example, argues that U.S. anti-obesity campaigns reinforce the valuing of Bgood citizens [who] take care of their own health^ (2010, 78) at the expense of those classified as overweight or obese. Handwashing campaigns potentially display such a stigmatizing rhetoric whenever their promotion of hand hygiene casts it as a prosocial behavior rather than as merely a method of infection control. According to these stigmatizing texts, the failure to observe hand hygiene has profound consequences in addition to the potential for infection.",

Underlying the Fifth Guy, as I argue, is the message that infection risk is exacerbated mainly by the failure to assume personal responsibility. My close reading of the Fifth Guy also reveals an emphasis on feelings of anxiety, fear, and even self-doubt.

In this PSA Ben's poor hand hygiene habits graphically come to life in the form of a urinal he carries around the office after leaving the restroom. In one scene, Ben proudly places his urinal on a coworker's desk while asking for some paperwork. In other scenes, he dances along the office's corridors, embracing his urinal in a mock tango. Depicting poor hand hygiene as a urinal makes some sense from the perspective of theories of fomite transmission of infection. These theories explain that, unless properly sanitized, inanimate materials or objects can become contaminated with infectious agents such as influenza virus. Similarly, poor hand hygiene-or a lack of hand hygiene-increases the likelihood of the transmission pathogens, both from contaminated surfaces to individuals and between individuals as well. 20 Yet, the goal of Ben's urinal appears not to be to instruct the workers of Florida in the problem of fomite transmission. Instead, by emphasizing ignorance of illness etiquette as akin to intentionality, Ben's out-ofplace urinal serves as an object lesson in hand hygiene as an expression of personal responsibility. Ben is stigmatized-literally marked-to distinguish him from those who observe their obligation to illness etiquette.",

First, the most serious risk depicted throughout the campaign is exposure to Ben, who is a Bwalking pandemic,^possibly even the source of plague. In implying that infection risk is determined mainly by exposure to others, this configuration places undue emphasis on the need for hypervigilance in interpersonal interactions. In Ben's story, the assumption of personal responsibility for infection risk takes the form of a kind of citizenepidemiology, with everyone working to root out sources of infection. Yet shy of engaging in self-quarantine, most people exercise only limited control over their exposure to others. Perhaps in recognition of this fact, the BFifth Guy^instructs in subtle pressures that might be applied to those individuals determined to be the potential source of infection-for example, through stigma. Second, infection risk is determined largely by one's ability to control and manage certain behaviors. Conversely, failure to change habits increases our risk. Different scenes from the Fifth Guy illustrate this formulation of infection risk. Motivated by the threat of Ben's behavior, his coworkers more than once demonstrate for the camera different practices for limiting infection risk. In displaying their compliance with illness etiquette to the camera rather than to Ben, his colleagues indicate the necessity of habitual and bodily responses to the management of infection risk.",

A program of risk management that depends for its success on the assumption of personal responsibility may similarly be too limited an approach to the problem of infection. As Cohen put it, the dictates of illness etiquette, although Bfundamentally ethical, are not universally applicable.^Efforts to mobilize citizens against infection risk require an environment supportive of their participation. Adequate supports must exist to ensure that citizens can Bdo the right thing.^To illustrate the limits of personal responsibility, Cohen discussed the example of labour law: Some employees, particularly low-wage workers, risk losing pay or even getting fired if they stay home from work to avoid infecting their coworkers. If we expect individuals to act ethically, we have a societal obligation to protect them when they do-for instance, by guaranteeing paid sick days to all. (2009) During H1N1, concern about the ability of individuals to behave according to the dictates of public health led to the introduction in the U.S. Congress of a bill that would require most employers to provide workers sent home with infections such as influenza a minimum of five paid sick days. Paid sick leave, supporters argued, could even be a benefit to the economy, since the policy could both increase productivity and reduce the spread of illness and infection around the workplace.",

(Even Owen [2013] , in describing in detail the Brise of Purell,^shies away from too staunch a critique of the implications of the turn to hand hygiene promotion.) Despite the appeal of the argument that infection risk can be managed mainly through individual behavior change, most exercises in risk management depend for their success on an environment supportive of these changes. In implying that infection risk may be equally distributed across populations, handwashing campaigns exclude the insights of decades of research on the social determinants of health and diseases. In this context, rhetoricians of health and medicine and health humanities scholars contribute meaningful investigations of the rhetoric of personal responsibility and specifically of its emphasis on fear, anxiety, distrust, stigma, and blame. Such analyses are sure to deepen conversations among scholars and practitioners about the long-term implications of a seemingly uncontroversial enterprise-the promotion of hand hygiene.",

Myriad studies report on the impact of hand washing on the risk of infection with the majority suggesting that the habit significantly limits the transmission of communicable diseases. 21 To abandon hand hygiene because of concerns about the rhetoric used to promote makes no sense. Far from opposing handwashing campaigns, I have illuminated their broader implication in the ongoing individualization and responsibilization of public health, which is also in essence a neoliberalization of public health. Hand hygiene promotion, as my analysis suggests, moralizes the spread of infection, making its publics more sensitive to their capacity to sicken, and be sickened, by others. In the context of outbreak, such a perception both potentially lessens expectations of various kinds of support, for example in the form of employment or health benefits. This perception also creates new opportunities for those who stand to profit from the negative emotions often highlighted in messaging about personal responsibility for infection risk.",

Despite its seemingly neutral objective as a form of risk communication, hand hygiene promotion galvanizes a culture of stigma, blame, and distrust in response to the threat of infection. To what extent might these effects in fact inhibit the need for cooperation in the face of a catastrophic outbreak? Handwashing campaigns transform perceptions of infection risk, casting illness as a personal failing. This is not to say that infection is not partly a consequence of poor hand hygiene, but the reality is just that. Poor hand hygiene is only a contributing factor and not the root cause of the heightened risk of outbreak. It may thus be time to consider alternatives, or complements, to a neoliberal model of public health. Personal responsibility has its advantages-that much is clear-but a more expansive approach might better facilitate the cooperation, and compassion, that infectious-disease outbreaks demand.",

A more recent report (Fottrell 2013) states that U.S. sales of hand sanitizer reached $300 million in 2009, and have since averaged nearly $200 million per year. 8 Plyushteva's (2009) critique of hand hygiene promotion in developing countries documents only the latest stage in a longer arc of handwashing campaigns developed to generate sales for hand soap. Vinikas (1989) , for example, chronicles the creation by soapmakers of the 1920s and 1930s of the Cleaning Institute, which worked to increase soap sales by inculcating schoolchildren into personal hygiene habits. See, also, Vinikas (1995) , which illuminates the significance to modern advertising of early-twentieth-century efforts to promote personal hygiene. 9 For the full text of this press release, see Royal Society for the Protection of Nature, BGlobal Handwashing Day observed in Yoeseltse MSS in Samtse.1 0 The quotations in this paragraph derive from GlobalHandwashing.org, the website for the Global PPPHW.",
