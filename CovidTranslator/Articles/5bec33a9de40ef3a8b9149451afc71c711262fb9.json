            "text": "Introduction: Viral respiratory infections cause major morbidity and mortality in preterm infants. We have performed a prospective study in our neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) to determine the incidence of respiratory infections, their impact and the epidemiology and outcome in high risk neonates. Patients and methods: From September 2011 to May 2013 a prospective study was conducted in all preterm infants <32 weeks gestational age and in all term newborns admitted to NICU for any pathology that was anticipated to have an admission exceeding two weeks. A nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) was collected the first day of life and weekly until discharge for virologic study with polymerase chain reaction. When these babies presented respiratory symptoms a new NPA was collected at this moment. A clinical form was filled by the physician. Results: A total of 60 infants were analysed: 30 (50%) had a gestational age <32 weeks and 36 (60%) weighed less than 1500 g. We collected a total of 256 nasopharyngeal aspirate samples, 24 of them being positive (9.3%). These 24 positive samples corresponded to 13 infants in our cohort (21.6% of the patients). Of them, 9 were symptomatic and had 11 episodes of infection (2 patients had two different episodes with negative control between them). The most frequently identified virus was rhinovirus in (19) 79% of cases. The most frequent clinical data was the presence or increase in apneas (75%) and the need for oxygenotherapy. Conclusions: HRV infections are prevalent in the NICU, and preterm infants have a high risk of infections with clinical relevance. ---el 79% de las muestras (19) ---fue el rinovirus (RV). El dato cl\u00ednico m\u00e1s frecuente fue la presencia o incremento de apneas (75%) y la necesidad de oxigenoterapia.

Hemos realizado un estudio prospectivo en nuestra unidad de cuidados intensivos neonatales (UCIN) para determinar la incidencia de infecciones respiratorias, su impacto, epidemiolog\u00eda y pron\u00f3stico en neonatos de alto riesgo. Pacientes y m\u00e9todos: Estudio prospectivo realizado entre septiembre del 2011 y mayo del 2013 entre todos los reci\u00e9n nacidos < 32 semanas de edad gestacional y aquellos ni\u00f1os cuya patolog\u00eda pudiera dar lugar a pensar en un ingreso superior a las 2 semanas. Se recogieron aspirados nasofar\u00edngeos (ANF) el primer d\u00eda de vida y semanalmente hasta el alta para estudio virol\u00f3gico mediante reacci\u00f3n en cadena de polimerasa. En los casos en los que los ni\u00f1os presentaban s\u00edntomas respiratorios, se procedi\u00f3 a recoger un nuevo ANF. El pediatra cumpliment\u00f3 un cuestionario con los datos cl\u00ednicos. Resultados: Se estudi\u00f3 a 60 ni\u00f1os; 30 (50%) de ellos con una edad gestacional <32 semanas y 36 (60%) con un peso <1.500 g. Se recogi\u00f3 un total de 256 ANF, 24 de los cuales resultaron positivos (9,3%). Estas 24 muestras positivas correspondieron solo a 13 ni\u00f1os (21,6% de los pacientes). De ellos, 9 resultaron sintom\u00e1ticos y presentaron 11 episodios de infecci\u00f3n (2 pacientes experimentaron 2 episodios diferentes con control negativo entre ellos). El virus m\u00e1s frecuentemente Introduction Viral respiratory infections are transmitted from person to person. Many of the viruses that cause them are carried asymptomatically in the nasopharynx 1 and symptoms may not show until several days later. Although these diseases are mild in most cases, newborns, and especially those born preterm or with low birth weight, are at high risk of respiratory tract infection with severe symptoms such as respiratory distress, apnoea or haemodynamic instability. These symptoms often cannot be distinguished from symptoms caused by bacterial infections or other diseases associated to prematurity, such as enterocolitis, nosocomial sepsis or apnoea of prematurity, so respiratory viruses are not the only causative agents under consideration. Yet, we know that common viral respiratory tract infections, such as infection by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), cause considerable morbidity and mortality in preterm patients as well as severe disease outbreaks in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs). 2, 3 In addition to classical viruses like RSV and influenza viruses, rhinovirus (RV), human metapneumovirus (hMPV), coronavirus (CoV) and human bocavirus (hBoV) play an increasingly important role in respiratory tract infections in infants. Very little is known about their role in neonatal units, 4 ,5 although we have demonstrated that they are associated with relevant pathology in our unit. 6, 7 Neonatal units devote considerable effort to set up measures to prevent infection, such as the use of hygiene measures of proved effectiveness by any staff that comes in contact with the infants: applying alcohol gel before and after manipulating the child, wearing gloves, frequent handwashing, prevention of catheter-related sepsis by monitoring the catheter and withdrawing it as early as possible, and the prudent use of antibiotics.",

Most of the scientific literature focuses on bacterial or fungal infections and does not consider respiratory viruses, except for RSV. 11 We present the results of a prospective cohort study in 16 viral respiratory infections conducted in the NICU of a secondary hospital. Viral respiratory infections, especially those by RV, are fairly frequent in the neonatal unit and are associated with episodes of apnoea and the need for respiratory support, especially in preterm newborns of less than 32 weeks of gestational age or with weights below 1500 g.",

            "text": "The advent of PCR techniques has revealed the involvement in lower respiratory tract infections in children, and that this is one of the most important viruses overall in the epidemiology of respiratory infections. Various groups have recently identified RV as the causative agent of respiratory infection outbreaks in neonatal units. Reid et al. 5 described an outbreak of infection by RV type C in 7 infants in a paediatric and neonatal intensive care unit, 5 of which had clinically relevant episodes of apnoea and required respiratory support or oxygen therapy. Van Piggelen et al. 12 described 7 severe nosocomial infections associated to RV in the NICU over a period of 5 years, all of which were associated with respiratory distress and required ventilatory support. In both studies, respiratory infections were suspected and a viral aetiology was actively explored. The clinical data of these two studies are similar to those obtained in our cohort.",

            "text": "However, our data show that respiratory viruses are responsible for a considerable number of disease episodes that worsen respiratory status and that are attributed to prematurity when in fact they are due to viral infections. We only found a similar study that focused on detecting unrecognised respiratory viral infections in preterm neonates admitted after delivery. In this prospective study, which had a design similar to ours, Bennett et al. 13 observed that 52% of the 60 preterm neonates tested for viral detection had positive results during their stay. This group of neonates had longer lengths of stay, prolonged respiratory support, and a higher incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia. In our patients, the proportion of bronchopulmonary dysplasia was also greater in infants in whom a virus had been detected, but the group of children that tested negative for viruses had a greater gestational age, a circumstance that may lead to misinterpretation of the results. The proportions of the viruses detected by Bennett et al. differed somewhat from ours, with a high prevalence of RSV, parainfluenza virus and hMPV, especially in the winter. Rhinovirus was detected in only 27% of the patients. The lower incidence of viral infections by RSV or influenza in our group may have been due to our meticulous adherence to the preventive measures against nosocomial infections. We agree with Bennett in thinking that while there are descriptions of outbreaks of viral respiratory infections in NICUs, these studies substantiate the importance of systematic surveillance for detecting infections that would otherwise not be recognised. Preterm infants may present few or atypical symptoms, and the detection of viral infections may have profound clinical consequences. Our study was limited by the small number of patients included in it, so it is important that other prospective studies are performed to elucidate the actual role of viral respiratory infections in neonatal units.",
