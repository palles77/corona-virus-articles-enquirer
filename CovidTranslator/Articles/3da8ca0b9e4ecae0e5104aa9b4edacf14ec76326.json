In side-by-side studies with wild-type mice and T-and B celldeficient mouse models, T cell (cellular) responses can be separately studied from B cell (humoral) responses for many diseases (bacterial, viral, parasitic, inflammatory and autoimmune) . In addition to studying the basic immune response to a pathogenic challenge, these animals have also been used to test vaccines for effectiveness (McNeal et al. 2002; Wyatt et al. 2004) . Unfortunately, results from rodent immunological models often do not translate to larger mammals, such as livestock and humans (Melo et al. 2007; Rogers et al. 2008b; Butler et al. 2009 ).",

For example, pigs are omnivorous like humans, have a similar gut flora and are infected by closely-related viral and bacterial pathogens. For most major enteropathogens, such as Helicobactor pylori, Shigella flexneri and Salmonella enterica, mouse animal models do not reproduce the tropism, immunopathology, or other hallmarks of the corresponding human infections (Goodwin et al. 1986; Lecuit 2007) . The dietary and mucosal similarity of humans and swine has resulted in their specific use as models for digestive, respiratory and/ or infectious diseases, and allergies (Krakowka et al. 1991; Saif et al. 1996; Helm et al. 2002; Charley et al. 2006; Souza et al. 2007 ; Dawson et al. 2009) .

The PPFF cell line was isolated from a fetus at day 33 of gestation. After removing the head and viscera, the fetus was washed with Hanks' Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), placed in 20 ml of HBSS and diced with small surgical scissors. The tissue pellet was resuspended in 50 ml tubes with 40 ml of DMEM ? 100 U/ml collagenase (Invitrogen). Tubes were incubated for 40 min in a shaking water bath at 37\u00b0C. The digested tissue was allowed to settle for 3-4 min and the cell-rich supernatant was transferred to a new 50 ml tube and spun down. The cells were then resuspended in 40 ml of DMEM, 10% Fetal Calf Serum, 19 non-essential amino acids, 1 mM sodium pyruvate (Invitrogen) and 2 ng/ml basic fibroblast growth factor (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN), then seeded into 10 cm dishes.

An amplimer, extending from the intron between the HC Diversity (D H ) and J H regions, and ending 3 0 of the Coding region of Mu constant (Cl)1 of the porcine HC locus, was generated so that both homologous arms in the knockout vector could be generated from a contiguous fragment (refer to Fig. 1a for schematic of HC locus). The pKOTKneo vector (Lexicon Genetics, The Woodlands, TX), from which the poly(A) signal 3 0 of the neomycin Resistance gene (neoR) had been excised, was used to generate the J H targeting construct (pREV708). The single functional porcine J H is found within 6 kb upstream of the coding sequence for Cl region (Butler et al. 1996) . The 5.8 kb 3 0 homologous targeting arm sequence was ligated into the pKOTKneo vector, downstream of the phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) promoter-neoR cassette. The 2.0 kb 5 0 homologous arm sequence was ligated into this same vector upstream of the PGK-neoR cassette. A 0.4 kb CMV enhancer sequence was inserted between the 5 0 homologous arm and the PGK-neoR cassette, making a CMV-PGK-neoR cassette (lacking a poly(A) signal sequence), and completing the pREV708 J H targeting construct.",

Sequence analyses confirmed the presence of one functional J H region fragment (J H 5), and also revealed the presence of four J H -like fragments 5 0 of J H 5 (J H 1-J H 4) that, while possessing some sequence homology, due to truncation or inadequacy of their recombination signal sequences, would be regarded as J H pseudogene segments.

The 4 J H ?/? piglets can be attributed to bystander effects, where neoR colonies selected for SCNT cloning contained a mixture of targeted and bystander unmodified cells, which would be subsequently observed in fetuses from litters originating from these colonies. J H \u00b1 cloned founder females were outbred to wild-type male pigs of a similar large white breed in order to generate J H \u00b1 F1 offspring of both sexes. F1 male and female J H \u00b1 pigs were subsequently used for cross breeding resulting in the birth of multiple F2 litters. Their genotypes approximated the expected 1:2:1 Mendelian ratio, which was confirmed after subsequent litters (data not shown).",

            "text": "Fibroblasts are currently the most commonly used cell type for genetic engineering in livestock, including pigs. However, gene targeting using a promotertrap strategy, which requires expression of the target gene, may not always be feasible due to a restricted repertoire of genes expressed in fibroblasts. In this study, a poly(A)-trap strategy was successfully used to obtain targeted recombination events in fibroblasts where promoter trapping [previously performed by our group (Dai et al. 2002) ] would not be feasible (Rogers et al. 2008a ). Knockout of the single functional porcine J H region gene segment, which is not actively transcribed in fibroblasts, was demonstrated in primary somatic cells. There are only two other targeted loci previously published in swine (Dai et al. 2002; Rogers et al. 2008a) , and this is the first successful poly(A)-trap strategy ever published in a livestock species. Rodents and humans can utilize 4-6 J H gene segments, but swine only utilize one (Butler et al. 1996; Jung et al. 2006) . J H -/-pigs were devoid of IgM ? B cells, IgM transcripts and serum Ig isotypes in the blood. J H -/-pigs also lacked follicular architecture, Ig isotype transcripts and heavy and light chain proteins, and B cells in secondary lymphoid organs. These findings are consistent with studies on B cell-deficient mice and humans (Chen et al. 1993; Jakobovits et al. 1993; Busslinger 2004; Jung et al. 2006; Blom and Spits 2006; LeBien and Tedder 2008) . Regardless of the resulting Ig HC isotype, either kappa or lambda light chain must be associated with a HC in order to produce a functional Ab. In our study, the blood and secondary lymphoid organs of J H -/piglets were devoid of detectable transcription and secretion of all major Ig isotypes and all Ig protein chains (heavy or light chains), respectively, proving that J H -/-pigs are completely deficient of Ab. Productive VDJ rearrangement at the HC locus is required for the generation of the pre-B-cell receptor, which signals differentiation from the pro-B-cell to the pre-B-cell stage during B cell development (Jung et al. 2006) . Essentially, functional VDJ rearrangement at the HC locus is required for B cell survival during early development (Jakobovits et al. 1993) . This was confirmed for pigs by this study, since no IgM ? , kappa or lambda light chain ? , or CD79a ? B cells were found in the blood or peripheral lymphoid organs of the J H -/-pigs. Also, the lack of B cells and follicular architecture in the J H -/-piglets supports previous contentions that development of follicles is B cell-dependent (Randall et al. 2008) . We showed that normal rearrangements were observed in T cells for the TCR b chain of all pigs tested, which, like the HC locus, undergoes VDJ recombination (Chowdhury and Sen 2004) . Our data suggest that targeting both alleles of the J H region of the HC locus Fig. 4 Histochemistry and fluorescence IHC of the LNs of J H ?/?, J H \u00b1 and J H -/-newborn piglets. a MLN were H and E stained and areas of follicular development were analyzed.

In one example of a J H \u00b1 piglet (middle, piglet # 1), follicles have structure but are not fully developed, and lack intact germinal centers.

In a J H \u00b1 piglet (middle, representative piglet # 1), a similar staining pattern can be found. In all J H -/-piglets (bottom, representative piglet # 9), there is no staining for either light chain or IgM.

It is known from studies on conventionally reared piglets that when serum IgG levels are \\ 5 mg/ml, piglets become highly susceptible, and die primarily from bacterial infections (Klobasa et al. 1981) . In this report, the 3 J H -/piglets that survived to 8 weeks of age (*4 weeks post-weaning) showed a range of IgG levels of 0.5-1.7 mg/ml. Although bacteria were not seen in the lesions, the characteristics of the inflammation were always consistent with a bacterial infection. The absence of detectable levels of bacteria is not surprising, since the bacterial numbers were likely too low to be seen by light microscopy.

In one example of a J H \u00b1 piglet (middle, piglet # 1), follicles have structure but are not fully developed, and lack an intact germinal center. In all J H -/-piglets (bottom, representative piglet # 9), there is no distinguishable follicular or germinal center development range (including wild-type littermates) weaned normally had any evidence of infectious diseases, and the pigs were housed in clean facilities, the lesions were most likely caused by opportunistic bacteria. The slight temporal differences in post-weaning illness onset among J H -/-pigs is likely due to each piglets' ability to suckle ample quantities of Abcontaining colostrum from the sow soon after birth. Based on this phenotype, for some disease models, facilities with gnotobiotic capabilities would be required.",

B cell surface expression, IgG production, and follicular development in the MLNs of J H \u00b1 piglets was less than in a J H ?/? piglet, over a fairly wide range. Thus, it may be useful to study these heterozygotes to confirm the apparent effect of the loss of one J H allele on the ability to make productive VDJ rearrangements. According to allelic exclusion, if the rearrangement on the first chromosome fails, rearrangement on the second chromosome and subsequent expression can still occur (Jung et al. 2006) . Since J H \u00b1 B cells have only one functional allele, fewer productive rearrangements and, therefore, fewer B cells may be formed. However, this is in contrast to earlier reports from one group on B cell numbers in IgM ?/? versus IgM \u00b1 mice (Kitamura et al. 1991; Kitamura and Rajewsky 1992) . This may be related to the species differences, targeting strategies, or any potentially different mechanisms of generating Ab diversity between mice and swine. In previous studies, it was observed that in fetal liver and yolk, 90% of rearrangements were productive, whereas this dropped to the expected 67% in late-term bone marrow (Sinkora et al. 2003) . Accordingly, this reported observation in piglets, and the histological and IHC observations reported here, suggest the need to learn more about VDJ rearrangement in swine.",

            "text": "The availability of a B cell-deficient large animal model would be a valuable tool for studies aimed at determining whether protection from veterinary or human infectious agents is mediated by humoral or cellular immunity, or both. In infectious disease research and vaccine development, it is important to study the cellular and humoral immune response, both together and separately. Robl et al. first reported the targeted disruption of one functional HC locus in a large animal, namely cattle (Kuroiwa et al. 2004) . No immunological characterization was performed to show a B cell and Ab deficiency at that time. More recently, the same group reported that cows express two functional HC loci (Kuroiwa et al. 2009 ) in contrast to the one functional locus expressed in mice (Kitamura et al. 1991) , pigs ) and humans (Yel et al. 1996) . They showed that both bovine loci (four alleles in total) must be targeted for the cattle to become Ab-and B cell-deficient (Kuroiwa et al. 2009 ). The time and resources required to generate and house sufficient B celldeficient cattle for research studies is significantly more than for the B cell-deficient pig model described herein. Specifically, for bovine B cell deficiency, 4 rounds of targeting and SCNT is required by their strategy, where cows are only produced by cloning (Kuroiwa et al. 2004; Kuroiwa et al. 2009 ). The method to generate B cell-deficient pigs has fewer burdens on molecular biology and animal cloning teams, with only 1 round of targeting J H -/-pigs were culled upon veterinarian-diagnosed signs of failing health. All J H -/-pigs fell ill within 7 weeks post-weaning. Full necropsies were performed to determine cause of illness. Specimens were collected from MLN and splenic tissue to determine presence or absence of follicular architecture (Foll. Arch.) as described in Fig. 4a , and were stained for T and B cell markers as described in Fig and 1 round of cloning required, following by standard breeding of heterozygous knockout animals. Also, since B cell-deficient pigs are: (1) generated by breeding or cloning, (2) litter bearing (cows usually produce one offspring versus over 10 on average for pigs naturally bred at our facility), (3) smaller than cows, and (4) less difficult to raise under gnotobiotic conditions (Butler and Sinkora 2007) , producing and utilizing B cell-deficient pigs as models is much more time and cost efficient in the short-and the long-run. J H -/-pig models can have special applications in veterinary research on such agents as PRRSV, and other infections. PRRSV is a world-wide pandemic pig disease, which causes over a billion dollar per year impact on the commercial pig industry. Since PRRSV seems to cause virulence by subverting humoral immunity through polyclonal activation of the pre-immune B cell repertoire (Butler et al. 2008) , the B-cell deficient pig model will likely be of significant value in disease etiology. Theoretically, if B cell-deficient piglets are reared in isolator units to protect them from bacterial infection, the degree to which polyclonal B cell activation contributes to PRRSV-induced immune dysregulation could be assessed. These same piglets could serve as a model to determine the relative role of cell-mediated and Ab-mediated viral immunity not only to PRRSV but other troublesome neonatal swine viruses such as influenza, parvovirus, and circovirus, which would have valuable agricultural applications (Butler et al. 2008 ). These include aiding in vaccination strategies for pigs (Welter and Welter 1990; Halbur et al. 1996) .",

For example, because of similarities with humans, pigs that lack the expression of the ion transport gene associated with cystic fibrosis (CFTR) have been generated to study this disease, since CFTR knockout mice fail to develop any clinically relevant form of cystic fibrosis (Rogers et al. 2008b ). In the case of CF, there are always questions of whether bacterial infections like Pseudomonas that are often associated with CF are primary or secondary effects. This can be tested using germ-free CFTR knockout animals. It is yet unclear whether some CF pathology or CF protection is Ab mediated. Perhaps by crossbreeding CFTR -/to J H -/-pigs to obtain a double knock-out pig some insight can be gained. Since pigs resemble humans in gastrointestinal physiology, dietary requirements and mucosal immunity, they have also been utilized as gnotobiotic models in studies involving rotavirus (Saif et al. 1996; Yuan et al. 2008) , norovirus (Cheetham et al. 2006; Wang et al. 2006; Souza et al. 2007 ) and sapovirus (Wang et al. 2006) , and both Heliobacter pylori (Krakowka et al. 1991) and Escherichia coli (Gunzer et al. 2003) infections. Therefore, the roles of humoral immunity in these and other infections, as well as in potential zoonotic infections [e.g. swine flu, Hepatitis E (Meng 2003) ], can be addressed with the J H -/-pigs (Butler et al. 2008 . Findings from such studies should be highly useful to researchers designing vaccination strategies in humans to meet unmet clinical need.",

We have shown the generation of a functional knockout of the HC locus herein. Further characterization experiments of this model are planned, and include evaluation of the stages involved in the B cell maturation block in the bone marrow of the J H -/-pigs. Results would be expected to be similar to those reported for mice and humans, where it is known that an IgM knockout cannot ablate pro-B-cell generation (Kitamura et al. 1991; Jakobovits et al. 1993; Jung et al. 2006; LeBien and Tedder 2008) . In addition, analysis of B and T cell numbers in blood, and in primary and secondary lymphoid organs will be performed, to confirm our findings and quantitatively show that targeting both alleles of the J H region of the porcine HC locus has no effect on T cells. Further studies include whether IVIG from wild-type pigs could rescue the J H -/pig's susceptibility to common bacterial pathogens, and finally, quantitative testing of the J H -/-pig's immune system via challenge with T-cell dependent and T cell-independent vaccines, followed by analyzing subsequent cellular responses in comparison to wild-type pigs under gnotobiotic conditions. This would complete the validation of the J H -/-pig model for aiding in vaccination strategies.",

            "text": "If B cell-deficient pigs are later constituted with the human Ig locus such that they develop B cells and secrete human Abs, much more significant value will be added; however, certain issues will have to be addressed. These include whether there will be proper communication between ''humanized B cells'' and porcine T cells so that T cell-dependent B cell responses and antigen-specific Ab production are realized. Also, since these animals likely would be reared in a conventional or Specific Pathogen-Free (SPF) environment to provide a practical source of IVIG, it remains unknown whether the human Abs produced in the pig will provide protection for the pig in such environments. Finally, significant purification steps during isolation of the humanized Abs will be required (as for any transgenic protein production system), to avoid any contamination with other porcine proteins or the potential horizontal transfer of zoonotic agents. Proof of concept for human Ig locus recombination in other species in production of 'humanized' Abs has already been provided, including mice and cattle (Lonberg et al. 1994; Nicholson et al. 1999; Tomizuka et al. 2000; Kuroiwa et al. 2009 ). Mice lack sufficient blood volume to make 'humanized mouse IVIG' practical. Pigs have several advantages over cattle, including shorter gestation length and time to puberty, and being large litter bearing provide a significantly larger blood volume to utilize per generation. In addition, a more efficient genetic engineering strategy can be utilized to generate the genetic platform. The latter is due to the fact that the pig only has one functional HC locus to target, and the targeted disruption of the porcine kappa (Ramsoondar et al. submitted) and lambda light chains is well underway. Therefore, 100% of all Ab produced in the pig would be fully human, generating more Ab overall and requiring less costly and less difficult purification processes. High volume, pathogen-free, fully-human IVIG from geneticallymodified pigs could improve current IVIG immunotherapy by alleviating safety and supply issues, and targeting production to specific viral infections (HIV, hepatitis C, SARS, Ebola, swine flu, etc.), antibioticresistant bacterial infections (e.g. MRSA) and biowarfare agents (e.g. Anthrax, Smallpox, etc.) (Waltz 2006; Butler et al. 2009 ).",

No J H -/-pigs have IgM ? lymphocytes at either age between follicles. Note that the pig contains MLNs with an inverted microanatomical structure(Jonjic et al. 1987). The MLNs from J H ?/? and J H \u00b1 piglets showed similar T and B cell zone features. In contrast, J H -/-MLNs and spleens were completely devoid of B cells. T cells appeared largely unaffected in the J H -/-piglets in comparison to the stains of the other genotypes. Thus, disrupting both J H alleles prevents follicular and germinal center formation and displays a lack of Ig isotypes and CD79a ? B cells in secondary lymphoid organs. These data are consistent with the lack of transcription and secretion of Ig isotypes and IgM ? B cells described earlier.",
