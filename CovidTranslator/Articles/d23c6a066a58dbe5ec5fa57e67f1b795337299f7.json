Since MHV pathogenesis is influenced by sex 26 , we performed independent experiments in male and female mice. Ly6e \u0394HSC mice of both sexes rapidly succumbed to MHV infection by day 6 ( Fig. 3a-b, Extended Data Fig. 6a-b) . To examine viral pathogenesis and immunopathology in infected mice, Ly6e fl/fl and Ly6e \u0394HSC mice were infected with the same high dose of MHV and euthanized 3-or 5-days post-infection. At both time points, female Ly6e \u0394HSC mice exhibited significantly higher levels of liver damage as measured by serum ALT while no difference was observed in male mice (Fig. 3c,i, Extended Data Fig. 6c,i) . However, hepatic viral burden did not differ in either sex ( Fig. 3d,j, Extended Data Fig. 6d,j) , possibly due to tissue saturation at this high dose. Indeed, female but not male Ly6e \u0394HSC mice exhibited increased liver damage and viral burden at a low dose (5 PFU) of MHV (Extended Data Fig. 7a -b, f-g). Spleen viral burden was elevated in female and male Ly6e \u0394HSC mice at both time points and doses of MHV (Fig. 3e,k, Extended Data Fig. 6e ,k, Extended Data Fig.   7c ,h). At 3 days post-infection, there was no difference in liver necrosis, but inflammation was moderately reduced in female but not male Ly6e \u0394HSC mice ( Fig. 3f-h, Extended Data Fig. 6f-h) . By 5 days post-infection and at both low and high doses of MHV, female Ly6e \u0394HSC mice had significantly higher levels of liver necrosis and a reduced presence of mononuclear immune cells ( Fig. 3l- Fig. 7k-n) . These data demonstrate that Ly6e in hematopoietic cells is important for controlling murine CoV infection.",

In Ly6e fl/fl splenocyte cultures, MHV infected macrophages, neutrophils, DC, and B cells, but not CD4 + or CD8 + T cells, as previously published (Fig. 4h, Extended Data Fig. 10c Together, our data demonstrate an important role for Ly6e in immune cell-mediated control of CoV infection. Higher viral burden and lower liver inflammation suggests that liver damage in MHV-infected female Ly6e \u0394HSC mice may be due to viral pathogenesis that exceeds the ability of the immune system to control the infection. Notably, we observed MHV-induced loss of three classes of cells: 1) cells that are not permissive to the virus (CD4 + T cells), 2) cells that are permissive to MHV but do not demonstrate Ly6e KO-dependent infection (NK cells, macrophages, and neutrophils), and 3) cells that are permissive to MHV in a Ly6e KO-dependent manner (B cells and DC).

Our findings are striking given that LY6E has been primarily associated with an enhancing phenotype in which LY6E promotes entry of multiple viruses 29 . However, our data clearly expand the role of LY6E during coronaviral infection and establishes a novel function in protecting the host immune cell compartment. Determining the precise molecular mechanism underlying how LY6E inhibits CoV S protein-mediated membrane fusion will advance our understanding of cellular antiviral defenses against these important human pathogens. Antiviral membrane fusion inhibitors have been successfully implemented for treatment of HIV-1 infection 30 . A therapeutic approach mimicking the mechanism of action of LY6E could provide a first line of defense against novel emerging CoV infections. Furthermore, delineating which Ly6e-expressing immune cells protect mice from MHV will provide new insight into how individual antiviral effectors in distinct cellular compartments modulate viral pathogenesis. author/funder.

In order to generate TMPRSS2-encoding retroviral vectors, the open reading frame of human TMPRRS2 was first PCR amplified with primers adding an N-terminal cMYC epitope to the TMPRSS2 coding sequence. The resulting sequence was inserted into a modified version of the pQCXIP plasmid that contains a blasticidin resistance cassette instead of the usual puromycin resistance cassette 17 .
