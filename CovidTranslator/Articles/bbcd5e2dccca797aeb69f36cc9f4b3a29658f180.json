Locked nucleic acid (LNA) comprises a class of RNA analogues in which the furanose ring of the ribose sugar is chemically locked in an RNA-mimicking conformation by the introduction of a O2 0 ,C4 0 -methylene linkage [1, 2] . Several studies have demonstrated that LNA-modified oligonucleotides exhibit unprecedented thermal stabilities when hybridized with their RNA target molecules [1] [2] [3] [4] . Thus, an increase in melting temperature (T m value) of +2 to +108C per LNA monomer against complementary RNA compared to unmodified duplexes has been reported. Here, we describe some basic properties of LNA followed by recent examples of applications based on LNA-mediated RNA targeting in vitro or in vivo.",

Examples of melting temperatures for LNAs complexed with RNA are shown in Fig. 2 . LNA:LNA base pairing is also very strong [9] (see http:// www.exiqon.com/ for LNA design tools to avoid extensive self-complementarity).

Complete stability against the 3 0 -exonuclease snake venom phosphodiesterase (SVPD) was reported for a fully modified LNA [10] while a significant increase in 3 0 -exonucleolytic stability was observed by blocking the 3 0 -end with two LNA monomers. In a study of oligonucleotide stability in serum, LNA mixmers were found to be very stable and LNA/DNA/ LNA gapmers (see section below for definition of gapmers) to be significantly more stable than DNA alone [11] . Furthermore, Kurreck et al. [12] reported that DNA oligonucleotides with LNA nucleotides at the ends are more stable in human serum than the corresponding oligonucleotides composed of phosphothioate DNA gaps with 2 0 -O-methyl-RNA flanks. DNAse I endonuclease degradation of end-modified 30mer dsDNA showed that incorporation of one or two terminal LNA nucleotides ensures markedly increased stability [13] . From these studies it is clear that LNA nucleotides impose significant protection against nucleolytic degradation, especially if more than one LNA nucleotide is incorporated into an oligonucleotide.",

            "text": "RNase H-mediated cleavage of the RNA target strand of a heteroduplex formed with an antisense oligonucleotide is considered beneficial towards efficient gene silencing. Because only very few fully modified oligonucleotide analogues support RNase H-mediated cleavage, so-called gapmers, that is, oligonucleotides composed of modified segments flanking a central DNA (or phosphorothioate DNA) segment that is compatible with RNase H activity, is often used. Wahlestedt et al. [11] found that an LNA/DNA/LNA gapmer, with a six-nucleotide DNA gap, elicited substantial RNase H activity. However, no RNase H-mediated cleavage was observed with a fully modified 11mer LNA or with an 11mer LNA/DNA mixmer [14] . Kurreck et al. [12] and Elm\u00e9n et al. [15] have investigated various LNA/DNA mixmers and gapmers and found that a gap of six DNA nucleotides is necessary for noteworthy RNase H activity, and that a gap of seven DNA nucleotides allows complete RNase H activity. In accordance herewith, Frieden et al. [16] concluded that a DNA gap size between 7 and 10 nucleotides is optimal for LNA/DNA/LNA antisense gapmers. The overall conclusion is that antisense LNA oligonucleotides can be designed to elicit RNase H activity while still containing LNA monomers for improved binding and target accessibility [17] .",

LNA-antisense constructs targeting the RNA moiety of telomerase are potent and selective inhibitors [20] with IC 50 values of 10 nM for a 13mer fully modified LNA and a 13mer LNA/DNA mixmer. By the introduction of two terminal phosphorothioate linkages, the potency was increased further by tenfold but this was accompanied by a decreased match versus mismatch discrimination. Notably, even very short 8mer fully modified LNAs are potent inhibitors (IC 50 values of 2 and 25 nM with and without terminal phosphorothioate linkages, respectively). Also in cells upon employing transfection, the 13mer LNA oligomers induced inhibition of more than 80% of the telomerase activity. No alteration of cell morphology was observed seven days after transfection of 8mer LNAs [20] . These results suggest that short LNAs may provide adequate affinity and selectivity for biologically relevant RNA targeting in cells.",

These findings have emphasized the potential of miRNA detection and expression profiling in cancer diagnostics. However, the detection of mature miRNAs has been technically challenging because of their small size and therefore calls for robust and improved technologies. In a recent paper, Valoczi et al. [31] describe highly efficient detection of miRNAs by northern blot analysis using LNA-modified oligonucleotide probes and demonstrate their significantly improved sensitivity by detecting different miR-NAs in animals and plants. Besides being efficient as northern probes, LNA-modified oligonucleotide probes have proven highly useful for in situ localization of miRNAs in cells and tissues. In a recent study, the temporal and spatial expression patterns of 115 conserved vertebrate miRNAs were determined in zebrafish embryos by in situ hybridizations using LNA-modified oligonucleotide probes [32] . Most miRNAs were expressed in a highly tissue-specific manner during segmentation and later stages, but not early in development. Thus these miRNAs may not be essential for tissue establishment but rather play crucial roles in the maintenance of tissue identity or in differentiation [32] .",
