Most medical schools have geneticists who understand evolution, but few have even one evolutionary biologist to suggest other possible applications. The canyon between evolutionary biology and medicine is wide. The question is whether they offer each other enough to make bridge building worthwhile. What benefits could be expected if evolution were brought fully to bear on the problems of medicine? How would studying medical problems advance evolutionary research? Do doctors need to learn evolution, or is it valuable mainly for researchers? What practical steps will promote the application of evolutionary biology in the areas of medicine where it offers the most?",

Some evolutionary technologies, such as population genetics, serial transfer production of live vaccines, and phylogenetic analysis, have been widely applied. Other areas, such as infectious disease and aging research, illustrate the dramatic recent progress made possible by evolutionary insights. In still other areas, such as epidemiology, psychiatry, and understanding the regulation of bodily defenses, applying evolutionary principles remains an open opportunity. In addition to the utility of specific applications, an evolutionary perspective fundamentally challenges the prevalent but fundamentally incorrect metaphor of the body as a machine designed by an engineer. Bodies are vulnerable to disease -and remarkably resilient -precisely because they are not machines built from a plan. They are, instead, bundles of compromises shaped by natural selection in small increments to maximize reproduction, not health. Understanding the body as a product of natural selection, not design, offers new research questions and a framework for making medical education more coherent. We conclude with recommendations for actions that would better connect evolutionary biology and medicine in ways that will benefit public health. It is our hope that faculty and students will send this article to their undergraduate and medical school Deans, and that this will initiate discussions about the gap, the great opportunity, and action plans to bring the full power of evolutionary biology to bear on human health problems.",

Many scientists thought that Lord Kelvin's arguments about the rate of the earth's cooling proved Darwin wrong (Kelvin 1862) . Others recognized that Darwin's theory of transmission by gemmules was inconsistent with his theory of natural selection (Richards 1987) . Natural selection was not re-incorporated into biology until its underpinnings in population genetics were developed in the early to middle years of the 20th century (Fisher 1930) . Even then, those foundations emphasized mutations and genetic variations, not the shaping of complex adaptations by selection, a field that was only developed by evolutionary and behavioral ecologists in the 1970s and later.

Somehow, from all of these jostling interest groups, priorities and multiple regulations and examination requirements, a Dean and faculty must come up with a curriculum. This makes it difficult to warmly welcome visitors who drop by to point out that a whole huge area of basic science has been omitted from the curriculum.

However, the intermediate step between heme and bilirubin is biliverdin, a chemical that is more soluble than bilirubin. So, why does the body go to the trouble to make a difficultto-excrete toxin? This is the evolutionary question.",

Oxidative damage is partially responsible for atherosclerosis, so many studies have looked to see if higher levels of bilirubin protect against heart attacks. They do, dramatically. Levels of bilirubin higher than normal are characteristic in Gilbert's disease; middle-aged people with this genetic condition have rates of heart disease sixfold lower than those with normal bilirubin levels (Vitek et al. 2002) . However, there is no mention of evolution or natural selection in the article that reviews the 11 studies of bilirubin protection against atherosclerosis (Novotny and Vitek 2003 ).",

When the enzyme is working, potentially damaging oxygen radicals react with bilirubin, turning it into biliverdin, thus reducing the concentration of dangerous peroxide radicals up to 10 000-fold. Without protection by bilirubin cells die quickly (Snyder and Baranano 2001; Sedlak and Snyder 2004) . This is a fine example of using the details of a proximate mechanism to test an evolutionary hypothesis. However, many relevant studies remain to be performed. No comparative study has investigated bilirubin levels in other primates to see if they are correlated with life span. More practically, researchers are now considering whether there could be possible disadvantages of using light exposure to reduce mildly elevated bilirubin levels in newborn infants (Hammerman et al. 1998) . High bilirubin levels in the first days of life could be merely a result of the changeover to adult hemoglobin, but they could also help protect against oxidative damage from higher levels of oxygen and free iron exposure. The decision is delicate because too much bilirubin in the early days of life causes irreversible damage.",

First, it tacitly views the genome as a product of design with a blueprint that defines 'normal.' The genome is, instead, a collection of those genes that have tended to increase reproductive success (or hitchhiked on the success of other genes) while interacting with each other and the environment to construct a functional organism. Second, while some DNA sequences can be accurately described as 'damaged', it is increasingly clear that many medically relevant genetic variations are helpful or harmful only in interaction with particular aspects of environments. Such genes have been called 'quirks' to distinguish them from defective genes that cause problems in all environments (Nesse and Williams 1994) . For instance, if you have the genes for nearsightedness, you will almost certainly become nearsighted. Unless, that is, you live in a culture where children are not taught to read (Norn 1997) . The problem comes only when certain genes and certain environments interact. Similarly, some genes that interact with high fat diets to cause atherosclerosis are quirks that would be harmless if we lived and ate the way people did thousands of years ago.",

Genes derived from male benefit if they somehow induce the female to make more or larger offspring. Energy reserves that a female mouse does not invest in the current litter will not benefit the male unless he happens to mate with her again. Conversely, genes from the female benefit by reserving fat stores for future reproduction. The size of offspring that maximally benefits the male is only slightly different from the size optimal for the female, but this small difference may have shaped a complex system.

They are modern equivalents of the old physiological method of extirpation. Taking out an organ or a gene and looking to see what goes wrong can generate hypotheses about how an organ or gene is useful. Often, no abnormality is observed. Of course, this does not mean that the gene is useless, only that its effects are covered by redundant systems, that its benefits are manifest only in special situations, or that the benefit is just too small to be observed in a laboratory setting. For instance, genes involved the capacity for shivering might well appear to be harmful, unless one happened to look at their effects in extreme cold. Similarly, some genetic variations associated with faster aging are likely to have compensating advantages, otherwise they would have been eliminated. As we are gaining technologies to manipulate genes, evolutionary thinking about their origins and functions becomes more crucial than ever.",

This knowledge gap is unfortunate for a trait so important to medicine. Half a century ago, Medawar (1952) saw that selection weakens with age because the surviving number of individuals declines, even in the absence of senescence. Then Williams (1957) had the insight that pleiotropic genes that cause aging and death can nonetheless be selected for if they also give benefits early in life when selection is stronger. He gave a vivid hypothetical example of a gene that makes bones heal faster in childhood, but that also slowly deposits calcium in the coronary arteries.

They also show how selection can shape special states of reduced metabolism that allow some species to survive periods of privation. These states slow aging dramatically, but they are special states precisely because they also so dramatically reduce reproduction.

A recent report about higher mortality rates for male than female mammals attributes it to both external causes and faster aging. The faster rates of aging for males are found mainly in polygynous species because a shortened reproductive span decreases the force of selection for older males (Clutton-Brock and Isvaran 2007 ). An evolutionary view of humans suggested looking at the ratio of male to female mortality across the lifespan in different cultures. This found surprising results (Kruger and Nesse 2004) . In every culture at every age through late adulthood, mortality rates are higher for men. In modern societies, for every woman who dies at reproductive maturity, three men die. The pattern is consistent in 20 cultures studied. Further work looking at the proximate causes of sex differences in mortality rates finds that they result not only from accidents and violence, but also from the full range of causes of mortality.",

Bacteria and fungi have been developing and testing the effectiveness of antibiotics for millions of years! Another important aspect of resistance is whether it has costs to the resistant bacteria that will select against the resistance if antibiotics are withdrawn. The answer is sometimes yes, but often the costs seem to be so low that resistance persists, an ecological insight of huge importance for controlling antibiotic resistance (Andersson and Levin 1999) . Continuous application of antibiotics also produces selection to reduce their costs, yielding resistant strains that persist after the antibiotics are withdrawn (Schrag and Perrot 1996) . However, restriction of antibiotic use in Danish farm animals resulted in decreased resistance (Aarestrup et al. 2001 ). More work on these evolutionary responses is of great importance.",

Individuals vary in how high fever rises during infection, how quickly immune cells are activated, and how much diarrhea is produced for a given level of infection. Most symptoms of infectious disease are not caused directly by the pathogens: they result from these useful defenses. Some are aspects of the inflammation and immune systems that attack pathogens.

The 'smoke detector principle,' applies signal detection theory to yield quantitative predictions about how selection shaped defense regulation mechanisms (Nesse 2005c ).

Most already know that using codeine to block cough after surgery is likely to result in pneumonia, and an increasing number recognize the utility of fever. However, only a few are thinking about how natural selection shaped the mechanisms that regulate defenses. Such thinking will lead to new studies that provide the evidence we need to make better clinical decisions.

A surprising amount of evidence is consistent with this hypothesis. The early term miscarriage rate is over 60% (Boklage 1990) , and siblings tend to be more different in their HLA immunological types than expected by chance. This suggests that other conceptions who received similar HLA genes from both parents may have been selectively lost (Ober et al. 1998) . While giving up a conception is inefficient, continuing to support a fetus who will likely succumb to infection is even more so, thus creating a selection force that could shape such a system. Related evidence shows that spouses in small local communities tend to have HLA types more different than expected (Ober et al. 1997) . Pheromone cues may guide individuals towards mates who differ sufficiently from themselves (Jacob et al. 2002) . That the human female reproductive tract has been shaped to screen defective gametes and concepti is now well supported. That humans detect and choose mates based on immune complementarity is suggested by several studies but not yet definitively confirmed (Loisel et al. 2007 ).",

One result is a decreased burden of parasites such as worms in the gut. During most of human evolution we lived with helminth parasites. Their absence in modern societies may help explain the vastly increased rates of autoimmune diseases, not just allergies, but diabetes and the childhood leukemias (Elliott et al. 2007 ). Regulation systems, including those that screen for antigens that react with self, were shaped with significant helminth loads on board (Weinstock et al. 2004) .

The length of telomeres, the bits of DNA that hang from the end of chromosomes, may protect against cancer. Each time a cell divides, the telomere get shorter; when it is gone, the cell dies. However, there is a side effect. Short telomeres also shorten life-span (Blasco 2005) .

Diabetes and obesity are strongly correlated (Neel et al. 1998a) . About 194 million adults worldwide have diabetes, and Type 2 diabetes (late onset) is exploding. Most diabetic patients are in India and China, and diabetes rates are expected to double, from 171 million in 2000 to 366 million in 2030 (Wild et al. 2004) . Much of the individual difference in vulnerability is accounted for by genetic differences (Echwald 1999) , but this does not mean the obesity epidemic results from genetic abnormalities. Instead, it means that novel aspects of our modern environment interact with genetic quirks to cause the problem, as it the case for nearly every polygenic disease. While not all ancestral environments were alike (Elton in press), it does seem clear that modern diets are vastly different from almost everything that came before.",

In their shared evolutionary foundations, anthropologists, geneticists, physiologists, mathematical modelers and parasitologists turn out to have much in common. This is not artificial interdisciplinarity; advances in understanding evolution illuminate all of these fields and research in each of these fields offers opportunities for advancing evolutionary biology.",

For now, the important observation is that workers in different field are increasingly finding commonalities in their shared foundation: evolutionary biology.",

However, does understanding evolution change dramatically what a physician does in her day-to-day work? In general it does not, and should not. Clinical decisions based on theory alone are notoriously suspect. Treatment should, whenever possible, be based on controlled studies of treatment outcomes. However, lack of evolutionary understanding among physicians fosters misunderstanding about issues as important as aging, diet, and when it is wise to use medications to block defensive responses. While there is a trend for doctors to just carry out protocols, we want doctors to have a deep knowledge base so their decisions are informed by understanding the body and disease. Better decisions come from doctors who understand the ecology of immune responses, the evolutionary reasons for polygenic diseases, the phylogeny of cancer cells, and the origins of antibiotics.",

The process involves some chance factors, and also adaptations that monitor the early environment and shift development in ways that adjust the adult form to a particular environment. Some traits, such as a birth canal that passes through a narrow circle of bone, cause problems for the species. But there is no engineer with a drawing board to go back to. Rerouting birth via the abdominal wall would work better, but the intermediate stages between that and the current route would not work, so the system stays suboptimal.

Most such courses do not provide enough basic evolutionary knowledge, so a combination with a basic evolution course is essential. The logical outcome will be evolutionary questions on the examinations like the MCATS in the USA that are used to screen applicants to medical schools. Implementation of the above recommendations will require close collaborations among physicians, medical researchers, and basic scientists. Creating such connections tends to be difficult because rigid administrative barriers separate the units at most universities, leaving them ill-suited to take advantage of major opportunities such as those at the interface of evolution and medicine.
