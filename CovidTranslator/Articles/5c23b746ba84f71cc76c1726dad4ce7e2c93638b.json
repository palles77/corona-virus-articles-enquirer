The chief complaint was that the kitten had had diarrhea, characterized as loose and watery, for approximately one week. A tentative diagnosis of parasite infestation and a diet-induced diarrhea was made, and the cat was vaccinated for feline panleukopenia, rhinotracheitis, and eaticivirus. The cat was returned five days later (October 9) with the report that the diarrhea had continued and that the cat had been anorectie for three days. The diarrhea was reportedly more severe than on the initial visit. Physical examination revealed slight dehydration, poor body condition, gas-distended loops of small intestine, and a green, watery diarrhea. A fecal sample was submitted for EM examination for viral particles.",
