There are at least 3 imported cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome in Thailand, and the disease control is successful. All patients were from the Middle East and received early diagnoses for Middle East respiratory syndrome. All patients were treated in the same tertiary hospital with a standard isolation unit. 2 The key factors for success in disease control are early diagnosis, prompt treatment, and sufficient facilities for management of contagious disease. Focusing on prevention of further nosocomial infection to medical personnel, strict infection prevention and control is proven for effectiveness. According to a recent survey on the hospital that was used for management of imported Middle East respiratory syndrome cases, \"all contacts reported 100% compliance with hand hygiene, using N95 respirator, performing respirator fit test, wearing gown, gloves, eye protection, and cap during their entire working period. 3 \" Nevertheless, a big concern is availability of standard ventilation-filtration units for respiratory isolation. Sufficient respiratory isolation units are required. ",

Although these devices are considered semicritical, studies have shown that their internal surfaces can become contaminated with patient materials during use. If these devices are not properly cleaned and heat sterilized, the next patient may be exposed to potentially infectious materials. 3 The authors paid meticulous attention to the surface disinfection protocols. However, they neglected to test the internal components when assessing the level of contamination of the disinfected handpiece. Surgical power tools can be considered the weak link in the decontamination cycle and present a potential for iatrogenic transmission of infection, mainly because their internal complex designs may restrict access to cleaning and sterilization agents. 4 Indeed, after surface disinfection of these dental instruments, the internal turbine mechanism retains blood and saliva, as well as viruses and bacteria. [5] [6] [7] [8] Viable microorganisms could therefore be expelled during subsequent patient treatment, making strict adherence to dental handpiece sterilization a professional imperative.",
