            "text": "Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) is a prototypic enveloped animal virus that has been used extensively to study virus entry, replication and assembly due to its broad host range and robust replication properties in a wide variety of mammalian and insect cells. Studies on VSV assembly led to the creation of a recombinant VSV in which the glycoprotein (G) gene was deleted. This recombinant (rVSV-\u0394G) has been used to produce VSV pseudotypes containing the envelope glycoproteins of heterologous viruses, including viruses that require high-level biocontainment; however, because the infectivity of rVSV-\u0394G pseudotypes is restricted to a single round of replication the analysis can be performed using biosafety level 2 (BSL-2) containment. As such, rVSV-\u0394G pseudotypes have facilitated the analysis of virus entry for numerous viral pathogens without the need for specialized containment facilities. The pseudotypes also provide a robust platform to screen libraries for entry inhibitors and to evaluate the neutralizing antibody responses following vaccination. This manuscript describes methods to produce and titer rVSV-\u0394G pseudotypes. Procedures to generate rVSV-\u0394G stocks and to quantify virus infectivity are also described. These protocols should allow any laboratory knowledgeable in general virological and cell culture techniques to produce successfully replication-restricted rVSV-\u0394G pseudotypes for subsequent analysis.",

            "text": "The entry of all enveloped viruses requires a membrane fusion event that is mediated by one or more viral glycoprotein found on the surface of the lipid envelope of the virus. These envelope proteins are responsible for binding virus to the cell surface and for inducing fusion of the viral envelope with either the plasma membrane of the host cell, or with an internal membrane following endocytosis of the virion. Identifying host proteins, glycans, or lipids that serve as cellular receptors for viruses has been one of the major goals of virology. However, for viruses that require BSL-3 or BSL-4 containment, the identification of receptors is not trivial and often requires indirect methods that do not utilize live virus. Recent developments that allow pseudotyping of glycoproteins from risk group-3 (RG3) or \u22124 viruses onto RG-2 viruses that require BSL-2 containment have facilitated the study of virus entry, and have also provided facile methodology to perform high-throughput screening of entry inhibitors for these viruses.",

Laboratory strains of VSV, such as VSV-Indiana, can be handled using BSL-2 containment and have been used as models to study many aspects of negative-strand RNA virus entry and replication. VSV assembly occurs at the plasma membrane and involves budding of virions from the cell surface. During budding, VSV acquires an envelope consisting of a lipid bilayer derived from the plasma membrane and spike proteins consisting of trimers of the VSV glycoprotein (G protein).",

            "text": "One of the remarkable properties of VSV is that VSV virions are not particularly selective in regards to the type of membrane protein that can be incorporated into the viral envelope. Early studies in which cells were coinfected with VSV and other enveloped viruses demonstrated that VSV forms pseudotypes readily (Huang et al., 1974; Weiss et al., 1977; Witte and Baltimore, 1977; Zavada and Rosenbergova, 1972) . A pseudotype has the envelope protein of the heterologous virus assembled into the VSV membrane. The ability to form pseudotypes is likely due to the mechanism of VSV budding (Jayakar et al., 2004) , which has been shown not to require VSV G protein (Schnell et al., 1997; Takada et al., 1997) . Therefore, noninfectious \"bald\" particles are produced in the absence of G protein, albeit at a much lower efficiency than when G protein is present (Robison and Whitt, 2000) . The fact that VSV particles can bud in the absence of G protein, coupled with the promiscuous nature with which heterologous glycoproteins can be incorporated into VSV lead to the development of recombinant viruses in which the VSV glycoprotein gene was deleted and replaced with genes encoding fluorescent reporter proteins (e.g. GFP and RFP), luciferase, or other easily assayable, secreted enzymes (SEAP; secreted human placental alkaline phosphatase). When a glycoprotein or glycoprotein complex from a heterologous virus is expressed transiently in cells infected with these recombinants, pseudotype particles are released at high efficiency. These rVSV-\u0394G pseudotypes, when plated on susceptible cells, undergo a single cycle of infection and the entry of the pseudotypes is dictated by the cell tropism and entry properties of the heterologous glycoprotein(s). Since the first description of this system in 1997 (Takada et al., 1997) rVSV-\u0394G pseudotypes have been used in numerous studies examining virus entry (Abe et al., 2007; Fukushi et al., 2005; Glende et al., 2008; Hanika et al., 2005; Ito et al., 1999; Kaimori et al., 2004; Matsuura et al., 2001; Okuma et al., 2001; Perez et al., 2001; Saha et al., 2005; Tamura et al., 2005; Tatsuo et al., 2000a) , for identification of novel host cell receptors (Tatsuo et al., 2000b) , for screening antiviral libraries and development of neutralizing antibody tests (Fukushi et al., 2008; Ge et al., 2006; Ogino et al., 2003; Porotto et al., 2007) , and as vaccine vectors (Klas et al., 2002; Lee et al., 2006; Miller et al., 2004; Publicover et al., 2005) .",

A fraction of the T7-expressed antigenomic RNA will be encapsidated by the VSV N protein and this encapsidated RNA will serve as the template for synthesis of genomic RNA by the VSV polymerase complex consisting of the VSV L and P proteins. Once genomic RNA has been produced, which can only occur through the activity of the VSV polymerase complex acting on the encapsidated anti-genome, viral mRNAs are synthesized and the replication cycle is completed. In addition to more N, P, and L proteins, the VSV matrix (M) protein is produced from the virally encoded M gene. The M protein is required for RNP condensation and virus budding. Because rVSV-\u0394G does not encode the viral glycoprotein (G), this must be provided in trans to produce infectious G-pseudotyped rVSV-\u0394G virions.
