Study design: Systematic review. Methods: Five databases were searched using predetermined strategies in March 2016, and 1927 citations were identified. Articles were selected according to inclusion and exclusion criteria. Key information was extracted from selected studies using a predesigned sheet. Both authors assessed study quality using the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) or Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) checklist. Results: Thirty-six articles were selected. A new framework was proposed that contributes to shared understanding of factors influencing health behaviour. Possible determinants of influenza vaccination among elderly people were knowledge, health promotion factors, all constructs of the HBM, and some concepts of the TRA. Key factors were threat perception, behavioural beliefs, subjective norms, recommendations, past behaviour and perceived barriers.",

            "text": "Seasonal influenza is an acute infectious disease that may lead to severe illness and death, especially among young children, elderly people and those with chronic illnesses. The annual burden of seasonal influenza is estimated to be 3e5 million cases of severe illness and approximately 250,000e500,000 deaths globally. 1 In the United States, elderly people (aged 65 years) account for approximately 90% of influenza-associated deaths. 2 Vaccination is recommended as the most effective way to prevent seasonal influenza by the World Health Organisation, 1 the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 3 and the European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention. 4 These agencies urge elderly people to be vaccinated against influenza each year. Evidence suggests that the influenza vaccine has a moderate preventive effect among elderly people and that it significantly decreases the morbidity of influenza and pneumonia, 5 respiratory or cardiovascular complications 6 and risk of hospitalisation and death. 7e10 A Cochrane review 11 confirmed the safety of the influenza vaccine but found no convincing evidence for its effectiveness. However, the use of inappropriate analytic techniques cast doubt on these findings. Beyer et al. 12 reanalysed the same data using a biological and conceptual framework and found meaningful predictions for the effectiveness of the influenza vaccine that supported ongoing efforts to vaccinate elderly people.",

In Mainland China, only 4.3% of adults aged 60 years reported receiving the influenza vaccine during the 2011/2012 season. 17 The vaccination coverage of those aged >65 years was 10% in Romania, 12% in Poland and 14% in South Africa in the 2005/2006 influenza season. 18, 19 It is imperative to understand key factors influencing influenza vaccination among elderly people to develop effective strategies to increase vaccination coverage. Previous studies have tried to summarise the reasons for accepting or refusing vaccination 20 or to identify predictors of vaccination with more attention on organisational factors. 21 as it neglects the influence of emotions on behaviours, including threat and fear, 26 which could be complemented with threat perception in the HBM. Therefore, the two theories have been integrated into one research framework in many studies. 27e29 This review aimed to determine the factors influencing influenza vaccination behaviour among elderly people using an integrated framework derived from these two theories.",

Vaccinated elderly people tended to believe that they were vulnerable and could contract influenza easily, 42, 48, 51, 53 whereas unvaccinated elderly people perceived that they had low susceptibility to influenza. 33, 36, 38, 40, 49, 52 Perception of a greater likelihood of contracting influenza also facilitated the first influenza vaccine. 30 A qualitative study in the United States with African-American elderly people revealed that perception of susceptibility was influenced by perceived health status, age and prevalence of influenza. 62 Perceived severity. Perceived severity was weakly correlated with vaccination acceptance. 34, 41, 56 Vaccinated elderly people agreed more strongly that influenza would cause serious complications and change daily activities 48 while unvaccinated elderly people did not think that influenza or its complications were serious. 49 This result was supported by a qualitative study. 59 Of 50 interviewees aged >75 years in the UK, 40 felt that influenza was fatal for very old people and those with low resistance or severe diseases. However, they did not think that influenza was a risk to their own health. Interviewees who had experienced severe symptoms previously perceived that influenza was fatal or exacerbated comorbidities. 62 Some studies examined perceived susceptibility and severity together as perceived risk. In a qualitative study in Thailand, vaccinated participants reported a risk perception of contracting influenza, whereas others stated that they might be vaccinated only when an outbreak occurred. 63 Two qualitative studies found that self-perceived low health status, and experiencing or observing influenza and its complications, increased threat perception, which made those who initially refused vaccination decide to receive the vaccine in the subsequent season. 60, 64 Perceived barriers Perceived barriers predicted vaccine refusal by elderly people, including perceived transportation inconvenience and financial burden. Some studies suggested that perceived transportation inconvenience and perceived long travelling time to obtain the influenza vaccination were associated with less willingness to be vaccinated. 37,48e50,53,58 Perceived financial difficulties were a hindering factor for previous vaccination history and vaccination in the last 6 months. 47 Another study suggested that elderly people would consider vaccination if it was free. 63 Cues to action Recommendations. Elderly people cited recommendation from medical staff as a reason for accepting vaccination. 33,45,52 A qualitative study reported that an individual prompt from a general physician was the most significant motivator. 61 In addition, 14 studies indicated that advice or a reminder letter from a health provider was strongly associated with vaccination uptake. 30,31,34,37,39,41,46e48,51,55e58 A study found that provider recommendations could overcome negative beliefs about vaccination. 41 Some studies showed that the health professional's identity influenced the adoption of the advice. Medical talks presented by physicians promoted vaccination compliance, while talks presented by nurses or other providers did not. 31 Recommendations from a family physician were more effective than those from a general physician. 36 Recommendations from families/friends also had an influence. Elderly people in Hong Kong who received advice from family members/friends were more likely to have been vaccinated. 51 Other studies showed that visiting elderly social/community centres was associated with ever being vaccinated, 47 and this was the only longitudinal predictor for first-time vaccination. 42 Kwong et al. 48 also demonstrated that family encouragement was a positive factor but recommendation from a friend was not. Another study found that advice from friends hindered vaccination behaviour among elderly people. 39 Heard of or experienced influenza/respiratory diseases. A study in the United States suggested that knowing someone with influenza was a key predictor for vaccination among elderly people. 40 Elderly people were more likely to have been vaccinated if they often suffered from a upper respiratory tract infection. 53 A qualitative study showed that elderly interviewees or their friends/relatives contracting influenza led to a sudden increase in threat perception, which was a key factor in subsequent vaccination acceptance. 60 Behavioural beliefs Positive beliefs about influenza vaccination/perceived benefits.",

Elderly people were more likely to have been vaccinated if they believed that their doctor wanted them to receive the influenza vaccine, regardless of whether they were chronically sick or healthy. 31 Madhavan et al. 40 found that elderly people who believed that 'people who are important to me think that it is important to get immunised' scored higher on perceived benefits and were more likely to have been vaccinated. Kwong et al. 64 revealed that vaccination coverage was higher in countries where normative beliefs were in favour of vaccination (i.e. South Korea, the UK and Greece).

This finding demonstrates that government and healthcare institutions play a crucial role in eliminating these barriers. Methods to improve transportation convenience include establishing express vaccination clinics 42 and providing home visits 18 for elderly people with accessibility problems. Recently, some researchers refitted an ambulance into a mobile 'flu stop' and attracted many people to receive the vaccine. 70 Other factors should also be taken into consideration. Sociodemographic variables (i.e. age and sex) can be used to identify target groups whose decisions can be influenced more easily by health providers. The impact of health status could also be designed as an intervention. A study showed that coverage was increased by assessing elderly people's health problems using a health risk appraisal and giving recommendations accordingly. 71 Family encouragement and subjective norms influenced the vaccination behaviours of elderly people, which suggests that family members should also be included in interventions.",
