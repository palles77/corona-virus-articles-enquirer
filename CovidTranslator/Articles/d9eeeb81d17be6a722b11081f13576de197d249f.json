However, Impacts of COVID-19 epidemic on HD center and HD patients are still unknown. In this report, we reviewed the whole course of the epidemic emerged in the HD center of Renmin Hospital, Wuhan University from January 14, 2020, the day the first case was confirmed, to February 17, 2020, the day the epidemic extinction. There are totally 37 cases among 230 HD patients (16.09%) and 4 cases among 33 (12.12%)staff being diagnosed with COVID-19. The epidemiology, clinical presentation and immune profile of dialysis patients contracted COVID-19 were further studied. We found that the two key measures we took in response to the epidemic, one was upgrading level of prevention and protection on January 21 and the other one starting universal screening, isolating, and distributing the infected cases on February 4, were effective in the epidemic control. No new COVID-19 case had been diagnosed since February 13. During the epidemic, 7 HD patients died, including 6 with COVID-19 and 1 without COVID-19. The presumed causes of death were not directly related to pneumonia, but due to cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, hyperkalemia, etc. Most of the leukocytes in the peripheral blood of the HD patients infected with COVID-19 decreased, and the CT images of the chest mostly showed the ground glass like changes on the right side. The symptoms of most of the patients were mild, and there were no cases admitted to ICU. The frequency of lymphocytes in PBMCs and the serum level of inflammatory cytokines were assessed in HD patients : medRxiv preprint progress to severe pneumonia due to the impaired cellular immune function and incapability of mounting cytokines storm. More attention should be paid to prevent cardiovascular events, which may be the collateral impacts of COVID-19 epidemic on HD patients.",

As of February 17, 2020, the confirmed COVID-19 case in Wuhan city, nationwide of China, and world globally reached to 37152, 70635, and 71429 respectively [4, 5] . In the patients with COVID-19, some special population should be paid special attention to. Epidemiological survey shows that COVID-19 patients with underlined conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease or the elderly are not only susceptible, but also often more serious. These patients are at higher risk of admission to intensive care or death [6, 7] . In addition, the profound impact inflicted by COVID-19 on pregnant women and newborns has also been noticed [8, 9] . However, as far as we know, the impact of COVID-19 epidemic on chronic kidney disease patients, especially uremic HD patients has not yet been reported. Considering the large population size of HD patients (There are 7184 registered patients receiving HD treatment in 61 centers in Wuhan city.), the high aggregation and mobility of HD center population, and the low immune function of uremic patients [10] , the situation of HD patients under the COVID-19 epidemic should not be ignored.",

The reason why the nucleic acid of pharyngeal swab virus was not adopted was that, on the one hand, the detection resources were limited, and on the other hand, the reported positive rate of nucleic acid detection was not high. Because HD patients come to the center for dialysis treatment at intervals, and during the epidemic period, many patients are worried about being infected, reducing the number of dialysis times and prolonging the dialysis interval, resulting in the screening work of more than 230 patients being completed until February 13.

The main causes of death were cardiovascular and cerebrovascular complications or hyperkalemia, which was presumed due to the reduction of dialysis times for fear of contracting the virus. It should be noted that although HD patients are highly susceptible to COVID-19, the infection for them is likely less severe or fatal. Actually, none of the 37 infected patients in our center has been admitted to ICU due to severe pneumonia. Some infected patients even have no obvious clinical symptoms. These suggest that in the face of the COVID-19 epidemic emerging, measures of prevention and protection certainly should be taken to avoid infection, but the sufficient dialysis remains the key issue for patients to survive the epidemic.",

Considering the high biological similarity between therefore tested the frequency of immune cells in the PBMCs of patients with and without SARS-CoV-2 infection and the level of cytokines in the body of patients. The results showed that compared with the general population, the T cells, Th cells, killer T cells, as well as NK cells was reduced remarkably in PBMCs of HD patients, irrespective of SARS-CoV-2 infection. In addition, the serum level of serial cytokines of IL-4, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1 in SARS-CoV-2 infected HD patients remain relatively lower in comparison with non-HD patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. This indicates that the impaired immune system seems to be unable to mount effective cellular immune response upon the invasion of SARS-CoV-2, thus results in no cytokine storm and no severe organs damage. In the current clinical guidelines and practice for COVID-19 therapy, glucocorticoids are regularly recommended and usually prescribed, for the purpose of inhibiting the overactive immune response and reducing the cytokine storm [6, 11] . However, with regard to the management of COVID-19 in HD patients, we suggest the administration of glucocorticoids should be prudent since the immune system in HD patients have already been suppressed [19] [20] [21] . .

The proportion of these cells in HD patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection was decreased much more.(Figure 4)In addition, we observed that the serum levels of IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, TNF -\u03b1, inf -\u03b3 in non HD patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection were significantly higher than the normal level, while the serum levels of these cytokines in HD patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection or not are comparable in significantly lower than those in non HD patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection.(Figure 5) These results show that the immune system of HD patients is compromised, which may be worsened furthermore upon SARS-CoV-2 infection, and unable trigger effective immune response and cytokine release.",

Totally 230 maintained HD patients and 33 medical staff were included in this study. Diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia was based on the New Coronavirus Pneumonia Prevention and Control Program (5th edition) published by the National Health Commission of China [11]. In brief, the suspect case of COVID-19 is defined as the one has the epidemiological history or clinical presentations of fever, respiratory symptoms, or decreased white blood cells or lymphocytes count. The clinical diagnosed case is recognized when the suspect case displays the imaging features of pneumonia. The confirmed case is identified if the suspected cases or clinical diagnosed case is positive in pathogenic test. According to the guidance of the government, all patients were transferred to the corresponding designated hospitals for treatment after infection and disease assessment and classification. We followed up all patients and examined some patients with their consent. The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University (WDRY2020-K064). Written informed consent was waived by the Ethics Commission of the hospital for emerging infectious diseases. Data collection tomographic (CT) scans.
