Here, we focus on the role of CD4 CD8 double negative T (DN T) cells involved in the mechanisms of viral persistence in hepatitis. C3H/HeJ mice infected with murine hepatitis virus strain 3 (MHV-3) were used to display chronic viral hepatitis. DN T cells dramatically increased in MHV-3 infected mice. Adoptive transfer of DN T cells from MHV-3 infected mice led to a significant increase in mice survival. The DN T cells with production of IFN-c and IL-2 are able to kill virus-specific CD8 + T cells via the Fas/FasL dependent pathway. The delicate balance of multiple effects of DN T cells may lead to viral persistence in MHV-3 induced hepatitis. In short, our study identified DN T cells contributing to viral persistence in MHV-3 induced hepatitis in C3H/HeJ mice, which provides a rationale for modulating DN T cells for the management of viral hepatitis.",

The direct killing of infected cells by virusspecific CD8 + cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) is considered as the central mechanism resulting in both liver damage and virus control.

In mice, DN Treg cells could kill activated CD8 + T cells with the same TCR specificity, and infusion of in vitro-activated DN Treg cells led to significant prolongation of donor-specific skin and heart graft survival [17, [25] [26] [27] . Recently, increasing attention has been focused on these novel Treg cells. Crisp\u00edn et al. demonstrated that DN T cells produce IL-17/IFN-c and contribute to the pathogenesis of kidney damage in patients with SLE [28] . Another study showed that DN T splenic cells from young NOD mice could provide long-lasting protection against type 1 diabetes [29] . In SIV-induced CD4 + T cell depletion in sooty mangabeys which do not present immune dysfunction and clinical AIDS, DN T cells partially compensates for CD4 + T cell function in these animals [30] . In cutaneous leishmaniasis infection, TCRab + DNT cells present an increased bias in their capacity to induce inflammatory immune responses, and TCRcd + DNT cells show a regulatory profile [31] .",

MHV-3 belongs to the coronavirus family and has a singlestranded positive-sense RNA genome. As reported, susceptible inbred mouse strains such as Balb/cJ or C57BL/6 develop fulminant hepatitis and die within 3-5 days following peritoneal inoculation of the virus. In contrast, A/J mice are resistant and develop no clinical signs of hepatitis, and clear the virus within 10 days of infection [41] . C3H/HeJ mouse, a semisusceptible mouse strain develops acute hepatitis which progresses to mild chronic hepatitis [42] . In our study, the mice have presented acute inflammation from 6 to 15 days after infection, and a proportion of the infected mice died. However, after this phase, the liver injury in the survived mice was alleviated, accompanied with the recovery of the liver function. Only mild inflammation has been observed in the livers of the survivors, with persistent low-level virus replication, suggesting the persistence of viral infection. Since the disease course, histopathology, and serum biochemical changes observed in the mouse model are similar to those observed in patients with chronic viral hepatitis, this mouse model could be useful to understand the pathogenesis of chronic viral hepatitis in humans.",

            "text": "Host immune response exercises a great influence on the pathogenesis and outcome of viral hepatitis. Some viruses can be eliminated by the host immune system in the acute phase of infection, but certain viruses, like HBV and HCV, can evade the host immune responses, resulting in viral persistence [43] . In order to better understand the mechanisms leading to virus persistence in the model of MHV-3 infected C3H/HeJ mice, we studied the variations of different subgroups of T cells in C3H/HeJ mice after MHV-3 infection. The results showed that the frequency of DN T cells rose significantly in blood, liver, and spleen after MHV-3 infection. We also observed an increase of CD4 + CD25 + Tregs (data not shown) in the liver, but the increase of DN T cells was more pronounced than the increase of CD4 + CD25 + Tregs, indicating that DN T cells might play a critical role in controlling the pathogenesis of the disease.",

We assumed that the adoptive transfer of DN T cells at this time point might interfere the development of liver injury. Therefore, we chose to transfer DN T cells to recipient mice at 5 days post infection. The results demonstrated that DN T cells could lead to both the dramatic increase in the survival rate of recipient mice and amelioration in liver histology. However, differences in the virus titers of liver tissue had barely been observed between DN T group and control groups. We presume that DN T cells may play a role in inhibiting the host immune responses which cause liver injury. Nevertheless, the virus replication and clearance appear to reach a dynamic balance in the process.",

Since the virus-specific CD8 + T cells play a key role in causing liver damage, this result made a sensible explanation to the survival increase and improvement of liver histology in recipient mice in adoptive transfer experiment. Transwell experiments indicated that cell-cell contact is necessary to the cytotoxicity mediated by DN T cells. Moreover, the Fas/FasL pathway instead of perforin/granzyme pathway plays a vital part in DN T cell killing. Thus we presume that, in MHV-3 infected C3H mice, DN T cells rapidly proliferated following the development of liver inflammation, and contributed to the control of liver injury by killing the virus-specific CD8 + T cells. The phenomenon observed here is in agreement with what has been described for TCRab + CD25 + CD30 + DN T cells, which are able to prevent the rejection of skin and heart allografts by specifically inhibiting CD8 + T cells through Fas-FasL interaction [17] . However, Zhang et al. reported that B220 + CD25 + DN T cells can control B and T cell responses in perforin/granzyme-dependent mechanisms [25] . Voelkl also reported that human DN Tregs do not eliminate effector T cells by Fas/FasL-mediated apoptosis, but to suppress by an active cell contact-dependent mechanism [44] . Thus, it seems that the functions of DN Tregs change in accordance with the different phenotypes in specific settings.",

            "text": "We found that the splenic DN T cells of the infected mice bear a distinctive array of phenotypes (TCRab + CD4 -CD8 -CD25 -CD28 -CD30 -CD44 + ) which were completely different from previously described T cells [45, 46] . Meanwhile, these DN T cells showed a relatively increased production of IFN-c and IL-2, but low IL-4, IL-10, TNF-a. It is reported that, in other disease models, DN T cells with different phenotypes present different cytokine profiles. In autoimmune diseases like SLE, TCRab + TCRVa24 \u00c0 DN T cells are the major producers of IL-17, one of the key inflammatory cytokine involved in SLE. And the results suggested that these DN T cells contribute to the pathogenesis of kidney damage in patients with SLE [28] . In CD4-low mangabeys, DN T cells have increased expression of IFN-c(Th1), IL-4(Th2) and IL-17(Th17), suggesting these cells may be capable of performing multiple functions, including CD4 helper-like function and regulatory function. And the latter could potentially contribute to controlling immune activation during nonpathogenic SIV infection [30] . In our study, we assume that the DN T cells may, to some degree, exert the role of Th1 cells, which promote viral elimination. Nevertheless, the limited quantity of these cytokines constrained their power for viral clearance and allowed the low-level viral persistence. We postulate that it was the delicate balance of multiple effects of DN T cells contributing to the viral persistence in this model.",
