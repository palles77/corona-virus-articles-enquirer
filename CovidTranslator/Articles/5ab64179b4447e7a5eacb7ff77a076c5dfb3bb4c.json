Interhospital and intrahospital collaboration and functional ICU communication are critical for success. Pre-event planning and preparation are required for a no-notice evacuation. A Critical Care Team Leader must be designated within the Hospital Incident Command System. A threestage ICU Evacuation Timeline, including (1) no immediate threat, (2) evacuation threat, and (3) evacuation implementation, should be used. Detailed suggestions on ICU evacuation, including regional planning, evacuation drills, patient transport preparation and equipment, patient prioritization and distribution for evacuation, patient information and tracking, and federal and international evacuation assistance systems, are also provided. CONCLUSIONS: Successful ICU evacuation during a disaster requires active preparation, participation, communication, and leadership by critical care providers. Critical care providers have a professional obligation to become better educated, prepared, and engaged with the processes of ICU evacuation to provide a safe continuum of critical care during a disaster.

Th e Evacuation and Mobilization topic panel developed seven key questions, and four literature searches were conducted to identify evidence on which to base suggestions, using the PubMed/ MEDLINE database (see e-Appendix 1 for a list of key questions and corresponding search terms and results). Searches were limited from 1980 to 2012. Inclusion criteria included English-language articles with a focus on patient evacuation (either in general or during a disaster), emphasis on hospital-based care and considerations, specific disaster episodes, and critical care transportation experience or systems. Exclusion criteria included disaster articles without information on patient transport and evacuation or with an emphasis on prehospital care or care of chronic, stable populations requiring technology and ongoing medical care during disasters. A total of 139 of 519 articles were selected for critical review. Despite this exhaustive search of the literature, no studies of suffi cient quality were identifi ed upon which to make evidence-based recommendations. Th erefore, the panel developed expert opinion-based suggestions using a modified Delphi process. Figure 1 -ICU Evacuation Timeline. We recommend this timeline as a general approach for ICU evacu ation preparation and performance. Th e suggestions included in this article correspond by number to these steps. Similar to the three tiers for Crisis Standards of Care (con ven tional, contingency, and crisis), ICU evacuation comprises three stages: (1) no immediate threat, (2) ICU evacuation threat, and (3) ICU evacuation. Note that the ICU Evacu ation Timeline is a continuum, with overlap between stages because many of the later-stage steps are actually initiated at an earlier stage (eg, preparation of patient information). and proper credentialing of outside providers have been cited as signifi cant challenges. 18 Hospitals and coalitions should consider defi ning the process of provider credentialing, repatriation, and payment for services rendered once a crisis resolves. 18 Prepare for and Simulate Critical Care Evacuation 2a.

Th is can be accomplished by adding a transport staging team to the hospital. Staging patients in place will minimize handoff s and decrease their exposure to the transport environment. However, in some circumstances, it is necessary to create a staging area adjacent to an airfi eld that will serve as a point of embarkation.

We suggest that every ICU routinely categorize every ICU patient by (1) ICU resource requirement, (2) transport skill requirement, and (3) transport type. Ideally, this ICU patient categorization would occur at least daily during routine care and be entered into an electronic checklist, such as a whiteboard or portable computer device (with a backup paper checklist). During a threatened or actual ICU evacuation, every ICU would categorize its patients more frequently, even hourly. Categorization should be performed by each unit leader most aware of patient details (ie, ICU attending physician or ICU charge registered nurse) and then relayed directly to and verifi ed by the Critical Care Team Leader. Additionally, there should be a mechanism for electronically collating these data so that both the Critical Care Team Leader and the Incident Command can have real-time ICU situational awareness.
