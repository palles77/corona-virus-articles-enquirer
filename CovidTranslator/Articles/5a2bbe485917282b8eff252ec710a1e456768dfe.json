The 135 participating herds were randomly selected from those in The Norwegian Dairy Herd Recording System that had at least 15 cow-years. Each herd was followed for 1 yr. Fecal samples from calves with (n = 68) or without (n = 691) diarrhea were analyzed for the presence of Cryptosporidium, Giardia, and Eimeria species. Diarrheic samples (n = 191) were assayed for rotavirus group A, bovine coronavirus (BCoV), Cryptosporidium, and Escherichia coli F5 by antigen ELISA. Blood samples (n = 1,348) were analyzed for antibodies against BCoV and rotavirus. Potential risk factors for diarrhea were analyzed by using Cox regression analysis adjusted for herd frailty effect. Rotavirus and Cryptosporidium were the most commonly detected enteropathogens in diarrheic samples. A high level of Cryptosporidium shedding or BCoV seropositive calves in a herd was associated with an increased risk of diarrhea. Other factors found to increase the risk of diarrhea were use of slatted concrete floor in group pens versus other floor types [hazard ratio (HR) = 8.9], housing of calves in free-stalls compared with tie-stalls (HR = 3.7), purchasing of calves into the herd versus not purchasing calves (HR = 4.1), and calves being born during winter compared with other seasons of the year (HR = 1.5).",

Diarrhea accounted for nearly 40% of all calf disease recordings in The Norwegian Dairy Herd Recording System (NDHRS) in 2005, with an incidence of 3.8%.

Rotavirus, bovine coronavirus (BCoV), Escherichia coli F5, and Cryptosporidium species are internationally recognized as the most important enteropathogens in acute diarrhea in young calves (Krogh and Henriksen, 1985; De Rycke et al., 1986; De la Fuente et al., 1999) . Among the protozoa, species of Eimeria are considered relevant causes of diarrhea in calves beginning at approximately 3 wk of age (Svensson, 1993) , whereas the importance of Giardia intestinalis as a cause of diarrhea in calves remains unclear (Bj\u00f6rkman et al., 2003) . Hamnes et al. (2006) concluded that both Cryptosporidium and Giardia species are widespread in Norwegian dairy herds, with herd prevalences of 53 and 93%, respectively, but did not investigate the association of these parasites with diarrhea. Bovine virus diarrhea virus (BVDV) is relevant as a cause of calf diarrhea in most countries (Werdin et al., 1989; Kelling et al., 2002) , but BVDV has been eradicated in Norway, and freedom from this disease is monitored in a national surveillance and control program (Kampen et al., 2007) .",

Most likely, not all calves reported to have diarrhea had impaired general condition at the time of sampling. Several of the diarrheic cases might have been short term and the symptoms were possibly caused by malnutrition or rapid change in diet. Also, some samples could be false negatives, especially for pathogens with low or intermittent shedding. Furthermore, other pathogenic bacteria as well as viruses or protozoa may cause diarrhea. Because of a national eradication program, Norway was declared free from BVDV in 2006 (Kampen et al., 2007) . Salmonella spp. are rarely detected in Norwegian cattle (Lyngstad et al., 2007) . Recently, more than 500 fecal samples from 37 dairy herds with various calf health problems were analyzed for Salmonella, and all samples were negative (S. M. Gulliksen The cluster effect within herd is assessed by the frailty effect (Kendall's \u03c4). unpublished data). The isolated geographic location of Norway, together with efficient surveillance and restrictive rules regarding import and trade of animals and animal products have contributed to the freedom from several infectious diseases that Norway benefits from today. That rotavirus and Cryptosporidium were the most frequently detected enteropathogens in diarrheic samples concurs with results from studies from other European countries (De la Fuente et al., 1999; Bj\u00f6rkman et al., 2003; Uhde et al., 2008) . Based on the serological results, both BCoV and rotavirus are common in Norwegian dairy herds. A high number of seropositive calves suggests an active or newly introduced infection in a herd, hence an increased risk of diarrhea. Low sensitivity of the antigen-ELISA for BCoV may explain why animals shedding BCoV were not detected. Interestingly, real-time PCR results from a recent Norwegian study (E. Jor, National Veterinary Institute, Oslo, Norway; personal communication) support the negative results from the antigen-ELISA.",

Among the protozoa, Cryptosporidium was the only agent more prevalent in diarrheic samples than in normal samples. Furthermore, a high number of calves shedding Cryptosporidium in a herd was associated with an increased risk of diarrhea. This is in accordance with Trotz-Williams et al. (2007) who found that calves shedding Cryptosporidium oocysts had an odds ratio of 5.3 of diarrhea compared with nonshedding calves. Only 50% of the diarrheic samples were analyzed by both antigen-ELISA and immunofluorescence microscopy because of the limited amounts of feces sampled. A considerably larger proportion of the samples were found positive for Cryptosporidium by the latter method (4.4 vs. 38.3%, respectively). As a diagnostic test, the cut-off of the antigen-ELISA was probably set to discriminate between clinically relevant and irrelevant numbers of oocysts. Thus, samples containing small numbers of oocysts might have been classified as negative by this test. Immunofluorescence microscopy is a more sensitive and specific method compared with the antigen-ELISA. In addition, it has the advantage of quantifying the level of shedding compared with the ELISA, which only provides a positive or negative result. Trotz-Williams et al. (2008b) found a prevalence of 30% of Cryptosporidium shedding calves in their study, using microscopic slide flotation, which corresponds to 33 and 38.3% in normal and diarrheic samples, respectively, found in the current study.",

However, concurrent infection with both Cryptosporidium and Eimeria was the only combination found more frequently in diarrheic samples than in normal samples. Other mixed infections with protozoa were equally common in diarrheic samples as normal samples. This could be, in part, because a fecal sample from a calf found to be normal on the day of sampling might have been diarrheic before or after sampling. Calves that previously had diarrhea but returned to normal on the day of sampling could still be shedding oocysts or cysts, making it appear as if these organisms were isolated from normal feces. The age distribution of the diarrheic samples corresponds to the distribution of clinically reported first cases of diarrhea in the NDHRS (Gulliksen et al., 2009) .",

This finding might indicate that calves born to purchased cows are protected against newly introduced infectious agents through passive immunity, whereas the other calves are not.

This contrasts with the result of the present study, in which both the risk of shedding Cryptosporidium oocysts and the risk of diarrhea were increased in calves kept on slatted concrete floors compared with other types of flooring. Because one would expect solid floors to be more dirty than slatted floors if not scraped and cleaned properly, this finding is somewhat difficult to explain. Draft and local chilling from the dung basement through the slatted floor could be part of the explanation, as draft has been shown to be associated with the risk of infectious diseases in calves from 0 to 90 d of age (Lundborg et al., 2005) . Local temperature, ammonia concentration, and pH have an effect on the survival of Cryptosporidium oocysts (Reinoso et al., 2008) , and these are all factors likely to be influenced by floor type. Further research is needed in this area.",

An increased risk of diarrhea during winter might be caused by higher levels of infectious agents during this season due to higher animal density per housing unit, lower ambient temperature, and higher humidity of inside air. A cool, humid environment supports the survival of several infectious agents for extended periods (Fayer et al., 2005) . Maddox-Hyttel et al. (2006) found higher excretion levels of Cryptosporidium oocysts during winter than during summer, as did Hamnes et al. (2006) . Furthermore, Norwegian dairy cows calving during winter produce colostrum of poorer quality than that produced by cows calving during any other season of the year (Gulliksen et al., 2008) . The importance of adequate consumption of colostrum by calves and its effect on calf health is well recognized. Hence, intake of colostrum with a lower concentration of IgG could further increase the risk of diarrhea in calves born during this season. However, no variables, including colostrum feeding routines, were found to influence the risk of diarrhea in this study (Table 1) .",
