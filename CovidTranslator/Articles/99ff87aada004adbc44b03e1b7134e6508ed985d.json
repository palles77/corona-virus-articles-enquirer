            "text": "Background The emergence of influenza A (\"swine flu\") in early 2009 led to widespread public concern. However, little research has examined the factors that underlie initial worry about infection and subsequent behavioral responses to such worry. Purpose This study seeks to model some key predictors of worry and behavioral responses in the early stages of the swine flu pandemic (WHO pandemic stage 5). Method A cross-sectional internet questionnaire study (N=186). Results Twenty-five percent of respondents rated themselves as worried about being a victim of swine flu, 40% that they were worried of a family member contracting the virus. Twenty percent had bought, or intended to buy, preparatory materials (e.g., face masks), 20% intended to delay or cancel air travel. In a structural equation model, conservation values and family or friends perception of risks predicted worry about infection, while worry correlated with the purchase of preparatory materials, a lesser willingness to travel by public transport, and difficulty in focusing on everyday activities. Conclusion While previous research on pandemic risk perception has focused on cognitive risk judgments, our data suggests that initial \"emotional\" concerns about infection are also significant predictors of behavioral responses to pandemic threat. Such worry is likely to be influenced by a variety of individual factors, such as personal values, as well as normative pressures. Practitioners can use and expand on such models of pandemic response when tailoring health campaigns to meet newly emergent threats.",

In one of the few studies of swine flu, Cummings et al. examined determinants of immunization behavior in the 1976 swine flu influenza outbreak in the USA [4] . They found perceived susceptibility and severity of swine flu, alongside the perceived barriers to, and benefits of, action, were all significant determinants of vaccination.",

            "text": "Most of these previous studies on psychological responses to influenza pandemics have, however, viewed risk primarily in cognitive terms, paying little attention to the more emotional correlates of health-related behaviors [5] . During a rapidly spreading influenza epidemic, when there is often limited evidence-based information, emotion may become of greater importance [5] , and in our study we focus on the \"emotional\" dimension of worry about contracting swine flu. We define worry as an affective, emotional response to threat, and an important predictor of protective behaviors independent of severity of risk and risk likelihood estimates [6] .Several factors are likely to influence worry about influenzas and subsequent behaviors, and new combined models may be required to analyze emergent threats [6] . We adapted an analytic framework derived from recent work response to terrorist threat [7] . This model suggests that demographic factors, social context factors (such as group norms), and individual values are all predictors of worry about a threat. This worry then predicts behaviors that address that threat, as well as the presence of intrusives that may interfere with daily activities. Following the SARS outbreak, women were more concerned than men about themselves or their family contracting the virus [8] , and we also expect this sex difference in worry. Consistent with other research on avian influenza [9] , we anticipate that older respondents will be less worried about swine flu. Worry about threat does not occur in a \"vacuum,\" and individuals may rapidly \"catch\" the emotional reactions of others [10] . As a result, the perception that significant others are worried is likely to positively correlate with personal concern [5, 11] . In line with previous work on external threat, we anticipate that those who hold \"conservation\" values (security, conformity, and tradition) are more likely to be concerned about threats to their personal and family safety [7] . Worry has been seen as a positive correlate of precautionary activities following a swine flu outbreak [12] , and we also predict such an association. In addition, worry about a future threat has been significantly correlated with difficulty in focusing on everyday life and work activities [13] and we anticipate a similar association.",

This can then lead to apparently conflicting worry-behavior correlations [5, 15] . Data were collected early in the pandemic (WHO phase 5, prior to the announcement of the stage 6, global pandemic).

Thus, we concluded that the data were normal at the multivariate level.

Cultural experiences with pandemic threat are likely to modify pandemic responses [22] and it is therefore perhaps unsurprising that only a minority of our primarily European respondents reported high levels of personal concern, or had purchased, or intended to purchase, preparatory materials for the epidemic. Responses to pandemics are likely to be partly dependent on mortality rates [8] , and may be highly time sensitive [3] . Worry at Time 1 can lead to later diminution of concern: coping mechanisms, such as the avoidance of crowds, can feed back into new, reduced worry [5] . Such reappraisals may be particularly significant if the coping is costly-for example, when avoiding crowds threatens an individual's travel to their workplace. Unfortunately, major influenza outbreaks often occur in waves, with a real risk that escaping infection in a first wave may lead to a misleading sense of immunity [5] .",

            "text": "Our study has a number of theoretical and practical implications. Our findings demonstrate the strong correlation between perceptions of family and friends' anxieties and personal anxieties, underlining the potential risk of \"emotional contagion\" [10] between groups during a time of collective concern. This suggests a particular need to understand and address the functioning of social networks during times of pandemic threat. Recognizing the significance of individual value variations may also have a number of practical implications when attempting to motivate particular groups towards appropriate behaviors during a pandemic. Just as those who value conservation values may be sufficiently concerned to take particular actions, those with opposing values (in Schwartz's model [16] , those who are high on self-direction, stimulation, and hedonism) may be less amenable to behavioral change. Indeed, work on the sexual behavior of such individuals suggests this latter group may have relatively little concern for their personal safety [23] . Health campaigners need to recognize this value diversity when attempting to promote particular behaviors during a pandemic and to modify their campaigns accordingly. Finally, our results emphasize the significance of emotional determinants of actions [6] , particularly when there is considerable uncertainty about the magnitude of the threat [5] . Understanding these emotional responses has implications not only for healthrelated behaviors but for whole economies, with pandemics posing severe economic challenges to the tourism, transport, and leisure industries [14] .",

This was an online study, and while this method is useful for rapid collection of data, and is likely to produce similar results to paper and pencil methods [24] , ours was a small size convenience sample, with respondents selectively recruited. As such we did not use a true random sample, and the distribution of data in our sample cannot be seen as descriptive of different attitudes or behavioral responses in a general population. Such a voluntary sample may differ significantly from a general population on key personality variables, such as neuroticism, a concept which often includes indicators of concern and worry [25] . Although link between education and worry about infection from influenza viruses is uncertain [2] , we also recognize the need for broader population sampling, particularly as our European sample was primarily from just three European countries-the UK, Portugal, and Finland. We measured normative concerns indirectlyassessing our respondent's perceptions of the risk estimates of their friends and family-and future work could directly measure such risk assessments from these friends and family. Our data were collected cross-sectionally, limiting our ability to examine causal relations between the variables in our model, with prospective studies needed to help unpack the relationship between worry and behavior [15] . As the pandemic develops, and as individuals have greater opportunities to consider the range of possible behavioral responses and the personal implications of these, other factors (e.g., the cost of avoiding particular areas, the perceived effectiveness of an action) should be included. Additional cognitive risk perceptions might mediate the relationship between emotional concern and behavioral response, and a full test of the relative contribution of emotional concerns requires testing its impact on behavior above and beyond the cognitive dimension of risk perception. Finally, the use of dichotomous outcome measures to assess relatively \"rare\" outcomes (e.g., the purchasing of goods) can lead to an underestimation of the clinical significance of concern as a predictor of behavior [26] .",
