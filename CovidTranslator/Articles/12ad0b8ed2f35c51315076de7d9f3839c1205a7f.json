            "text": "Research about disasters in tourism has emerged in earnest since the 1990s covering insights for preparedness and response. However, recently, authors have called for more systematic and holistic approaches to tourism disaster management research. To address this gap, this study adopted a public relations perspective to refocus attention to relationships and stakeholder expectations of destination communities across multiple phases of disaster management. The authors used a mixed method approach and developed a battery of disaster management attributes by conducting interviews and analysing industry documents and the extant literature. These attributes formed part of a survey of tourism businesses. Exploratory Factor Analysis resulted in a two factor solution: i) business disaster preparedness, and ii) destination disaster response and recovery. Findings also show that participants reported a gap between the importance and destination performance of these attributes. In particular, tourism businesses perceived destinations did not adequately engage in disaster preparedness activities, which had implications for disaster response and recovery.",

Although past disaster experience can motivate action (Cioccio & Michael, 2007) , the traditionally low levels of disaster preparedness amongst tourism businesses are attributed to beliefs that disasters are not likely (Faulkner & Vikulov, 2001; Hystad & Keller, 2008) , and a lack of funds, staff, and time (Spillan & Hough, 2003) .

The lack of alignment between organizational and stakeholder interests can reflect in social and economic performance (Sloan, 2009) . In this regard, there has been a relatively small stream of research investigating tourism destination stakeholder perceptions of the effectiveness of the DMO's destination leadership (see for example Bornhorst, Ritchie, & Sheehan, 2010; Donnelly & Vaske, 1997; Dwyer, Cvelbar, Edwards, & Mihalic, 2012; Evans & Chon, 1989; Selin & Myers, 1998; Wagner & Peters, 2009) . Within these studies, a noticeable gap is the extent to which destination stakeholders are satisfied with their destination's disaster management. A DMO's disaster management activities are vital in ensuring resilience in the tourism industry. In the context of disaster management, the lack of alignment has the potential to affect how stakeholders, in this case tourism businesses prepare, respond to and recover from disasters.",

            "text": "Expectation confirmation theory (ECT) was originally developed by Oliver (1980) who suggested expectations and perceived performance lead to satisfaction. This effect is mediated through a positive or negative confirmation or discrepancy between expectations and performance. For example, if a service exceeds the expectations of the consumer (positive confirmation), satisfaction will occur and if a service falls short of expectations (negative confirmation), dissatisfaction is likely to result (Chou, Lin, Woung, & Tsai, 2012; Oliver, 1980) . ECT has been widely used to study satisfaction amongst consumers in marketing environments, urban services and information technology (Bhattacherjee, 2001; Chou, Kiser, & Rodriguez, 2012; Thong, Hong, & Tam, 2006; Van Ryzin, 2004) . Satisfaction levels are predicted through two constructs: expectation of the service and confirmation of that expectation following the experience (Bhattacherjee, 2001) . The expectation provides the base line against which confirmation is assessed in order to determine overall satisfaction. This is due to the fact that high satisfaction implies a number of positive outcomes such as purchase, endorsement, profit or return on investment (Bowden, 2009 ). In tourism, ECT has been applied to examine individual tourist satisfaction with destinations (Hui, Wan, & Ho, 2007; O'Rourke & O'Rourke, 1984; Pizam & Ellis, 1999; Pizam & Milman, 1993; Van Raaij & Francken, 1984; Weber, 1997) and with tourism trends such as medical tourism .",

Participants consisted of two tourism operators, two employees of DMOs, and two individuals from local government. The semistructured interviews consisted of four open-ended questions. These real-world insights consequently added a new dimension to the emerging list of attributes. Interviews were then transcribed and coded, in an attempt to derive disaster management attributes from the text. Manual coding was undertaken, whereby the raw data were first transformed into preliminary codes, then final codes (Salda\u00f1a, 2012) . The three lists of attributes were triangulated by comparing and contrasting, and integrating the separate lists into a definitive battery of attributes (Berg & Lune, 2004) . Similar attributes were combined, and attributes that were only mentioned in one of the lists were eliminated. From these tables, a final list of 14 attributes was developed, as shown in Table 2 .",

When effectively applied, stakeholder engagement has the potential to enhance tourism business' capabilities in disaster management (Taylor & Kent, 2014) . The attributes identified above included a number of areas that have the ability to improve owner/operator and business capability for disaster preparedness, response and recovery. At the same time, seven attributes sat above the scale mid-point with the majority belonging to factor two, destination disaster response and recovery. This finding suggested that destinations were perceived to do a better/adequate job at destination level than at the individual business level. Overall, this analysis focused on stakeholder perceptions of performance rather than actual performance.

First, despite the relatively large overall sample size within this study, participant numbers for some Australian States have been undererepresented, which restricts the ability to generalise findings. Difficultly gaining business participants as opposed to individual consumers is an issue faced frequently by researchers, as acknowledged by Pike, Murdy, and Lings (2011) . As such, the use of an external panel organisation was vital in ensuring an adequately sized sample, yet use of such a panel poses limitations for the current study. The utilisation of judgement sampling, specifically the panel organisation's offer of a small incentive to complete the survey may have resulted in cases of self-selection bias. Self-selection bias occurs when participants decide entirely for themselves whether or not to participate in the survey. This occurs to the extent that the participants' propensity for participating is correlated with the phenomenon the researcher is attempting to investigate (Hall, 2008) . While acknowledging these shortcomings, results of this research reveal useful insights into the relationship between communities and the tourism operators they represent, and contributes to current understanding of disaster management in Australia.",
