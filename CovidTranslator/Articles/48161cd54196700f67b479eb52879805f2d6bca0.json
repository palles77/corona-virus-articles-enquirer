In 2013, there were 33 active conflicts worldwide, with seven accounting for more than a thousand lives lost each in that year, and many more injured. 1 Most of these occur in poorer regions of the world where there is little resilience in the basic healthcare infrastructure, and little or no availability of specialist healthcare to support the rehabilitation of injured personnel. Both governments and non-governmental organizations in developed countries have arranged at short notice the temporary transfer of civilian casualties with salvageable and recoverable injuries to specialist centres in their countries, offering services such as plastic and reconstructive surgery, treatment of burns, neurosurgery and orthopaedics. These patients may be infected or colonized with a variety of micro-organisms of infection control significance. Although some western countries have considerable recent experience of managing repatriated injured service personnel, the infection control risks presented by civilian casualties should not be considered to be comparable; the latter differ substantially in their pre-morbid levels of fitness and prior exposure to communicable diseases.",

First, there will be an early general request to take patients from the war zone; once a plan is made on the ground to transfer patients, hospitals will ideally get 48 h notice that patients will be arriving, but in reality this second period of notice may be much shorter. The key is therefore to start planning as soon as it is announced that patients may be transferred. As no specific evidence or guidance exists, infection control teams will likely draw upon a number of national guidelines relevant to transfer of hospitalized patients from overseas, the febrile returned traveller, and revise universal standard precautions. 3, 4 The most important consideration in the risk assessment is what micro-organisms of infection control significance may be imported with the patient. Virtually all civilian casualties of conflict will have had some days of hospital treatment in their country of origin, and will be medically stable when transferred. The most obvious infection control risk they present is possession of multidrug-resistant bacteria, for which national screening guidelines exist. 3 However, there are other important considerations. Blood-borne virus infections may be endemic in the patient's homeland, or the patient could be incubating such an infection acquired during locally delivered healthcare. A wide range of infectious diseases, sometimes exotic, may be present in the country of origin as well as the more mundane ones that complicate surgical procedures all over the world. Suitable sources of information on current disease outbreaks include ProMED-mail (http://www. promedmail.org), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Travellers' Health Notices (http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/ travel/notices), the World Health Organization (http://www. who.int/csr/don/en), and the National Travel Health Network and Centre website (http://www.nathnac.org/ countrysearch.aspx).

Because they are ambulant, they present different infection control challenges.
