As transmission between ferrets is considered a surrogate indicator of transmissibility between humans, these studies raised concerns about the risks of gain-of-function influenza A virus research. Here we present an approach to strengthen the biosafety of gain-offunction influenza experiments. We exploit species-specific endogenous small RNAs to restrict influenza A virus tropism. In particular, we found that the microRNA miR-192 was expressed in primary human respiratory tract epithelial cells as well as mouse lungs but absent from the ferret respiratory tract. Incorporation of miR-192 target sites into influenza A virus did not prevent influenza replication and transmissibility in ferrets, but did attenuate influenza pathogenicity in mice. This molecular biocontainment approach should be applicable beyond influenza A virus to minimize the risk of experiments involving other pathogenic viruses.",

Owing to the segmented nature and replication dynamics of its RNA genome, influenza A virus can undergo gene reassortment and/or accumulate mutations that permit its persistence and evolution in nature as well as its adaptation to new hosts 3 . For example, influenza A virus circulates in birds as a pathogen of the digestive and respiratory tracts but, on occasion, gains the capacity to jump species and establish respiratory infections in mammals 3 . Although many strains of IAV circulate in migratory bird species at any particular time, the H5N1 strain has caused several hundred human deaths since 1997, and public health authorities are concerned that it may evolve to become as deadly as the 1918 H1N1 4 . The recent emergence of H7N9 infections in humans in China is causing similar concerns 5 .",

            "text": "Although H5N1 is already capable of causing significant morbidity and mortality in humans, transmission thus far has been largely restricted to birds 6, 7 . Humans infected with H5N1 seem to acquire the virus from direct contact with birds. Human-to-human, ferret-to-ferret and pig-to-pig transmission of H7N9 viruses also appears to be inefficient 5, 8 . However, as mutations may confer human transmissibility of H5N1 and H7N9 strains, defining the determinants of avian influenza virus transmission and using this information to monitor circulating avian strains regularly for transmission potential may improve global preparedness in the face of a novel pandemic. Recent findings suggest that three amino acid substitutions are sufficient to enable airborne transmission of H5N1 strains between ferrets 1, 2, 9 ; however it should be noted that when introduced into currently circulating strains these particular mutations are not sufficient to switch HA binding preference from avian to human receptors 10 . In addition, natural recombinations between the seasonal H1N1 and avian H5N1 can confer transmissibility in guinea pigs 11 . These findings raised serious public concern about whether the scientific community should be generating mammalian transmissible influenza A viruses, even within the controlled setting of enhanced biosafety level three containment 12 . Here we present an approach to mitigate safety concerns associated with avian influenza A virus gain-of-function studies. Building on previous work showing that microRNA (miRNA)-binding sites engineered into the influenza A virus genome can suppress influenza A virus gene expression and infection 13, 1415 , this approach relies on endogenous miRNAs to limit viral tropism. Specifically, we exploit speciesspecific differences in miRNA expression to engineer a virus that is transmissible among animals of a desired experimental species but not among humans.",

As ferrets are routinely used in influenza A virus transmissibility experiments, and MDCK cells are often used to grow influenza A virus, we searched for miRNAs that are abundant in human A549 lung cells but absent in ferret lung cells and MDCK cells (the latter two species are both of the order Carnivora). Small RNAs from human lung A549 cells, MDCK, and primary ferret lung were isolated, cloned, and deep sequenced. Plotting specific reads over total reads allowed us to identify miRNAs that were abundant in A549 human lung cells (defined as over 1% of total) but absent or nearly absent, in both ferret lung and MDCK cells ( Fig. 1 Northern blot of small RNAs isolated from human A549 cells and ferret lung was performed to corroborate the miRNA expression pattern observed using sequencing ( Supplementary  Fig. 1a) , and to rule out potential binding of other miRNAs to the Northern blot probe, a labeled antisense oligonuclotide used to detect small RNA which can also act as a surrogate for miRNA target sites. In contrast to the sequencing data, Northern blot revealed substantial expression of miR-193b in ferret lung; Northern blot supported only miR-138 and miR-192 as miRNAs with the potential to facilitate 'molecular biocontainment'. We next measured the abundance of miR-192 and miR-138 in murine lung; only miR-192 was detectable at levels sufficient to silence influenza A virus ( Supplementary Fig. 1b) . Furthermore, Northern blot analyses of human lower respiratory tract bronchus and alveolar cell lines revealed robust miR-192 expression ( Supplementary Fig. 1c) . Additionally, quantitative PCR revealed that upper respiratory tract primary human nasal epithelial cells express approximately two-fold more miR-192 than do alveolar cells ( Supplementary Fig. 1d ). These data are consistent with previous studies demonstrating miR-192 expression in primary human tracheal bronchial epithelial cells 16 . Given the disparate expression of miR-192 between ferret versus human and murine respiratory tracts, we pursued miR-192 as a miRNA potentially capable of restricting influenza A virus replication in humans and mice but neither ferrets nor MDCK cells.",

However, to prevent the possible reassortment of the hemagglutinin (HA) segment, here we chose to insert the miR-192 target site into segment four, which encodes HA. To this end, we duplicated the 5\u2032 packaging sequence of segment four viral RNA (vRNA), thus creating an untranslated region (UTR) at the 3\u2032 end of HA mRNA (Fig. 2a) . Without modifying the duplicated packaging sequence, we inserted scrambled non-coding (nc) RNA (ctrl) or four fully complementary miR-192 target sites (192t) into this region (Fig. 2a) . These modifications did not alter the amino acid composition of HA or the biology of segment four, as the miRNA target site is inserted downstream of the HA stop codon but upstream of the duplicated packaging sequence.",

Consistent with miR-192 expression and in vitro virus growth (Fig. 2b, c) , mice infected with 192t virus demonstrated no signs of morbidity and did not succumb to the infection (Fig. 3a, b) . In contrast, infection with WT or ctrl virus resulted in weight loss and all animals succumbed to infection within eight days after infection. Strikingly, even when the dose of 192t virus was increased by one order of magnitude, the mice showed no signs of morbidity or mortality. These results illustrate that species-restricted miRNA targeting of HA can provide robust protection even when the lethal dose is exceeded by at least 10-fold. Consistent with the weight loss and survival data, we detected a reduction in pulmonary titers of 192t compared to WT or ctrl viruses at three and five days post infection; we also noted a reduction in the amount of 192t HA and NP protein (Fig. 3c , d and Supplementary  Fig. 3 ). To determine if the reduced, but not absent, levels of virus replication in the 192t infected animals is a result of virus escape from miRNA targeting, either through mutation or complete excision, 5 days after infection we plaque purified 192t virus from the lungs of mice and sequenced all isolates. All seventeen of the 192t virus plaques isolated contained perfect miR-192 target sites (data not shown). These data are consistent with previous studies describing miRNA-mediated influenza A virus targeting, where no evidence of virus escape in vivo was detected; these results demonstrate the safety of this molecular biocontainment platform 13, 14 . Taken together these data demonstrate that species-specific miRNAs expressed in the lung are capable of blunting in vivo influenza A virus infections and preventing virus-induced disease.",

Adding this proposed molecular biocontainment measure to existing physical safety precautions, such as the use of enhanced biosafety level 3 facilities and protocols, would greatly reduce the possibility of viral escape. One potential concern regarding this approach is the possibility of escape mutants. However, the absence of escape mutants in this study and in studies of comparable miRNA-targeting strategies suggest that escape is unlikely 13, 14 . No escape was observed even in viruses with polymerases of lower fidelity, suggesting that the selective pressure imposed by RNAi is too great to yield bona fide escape mutants 22 . In events where escape does occur, the entire targeted sequence is excised 23, 24 ; we did not detect such an event in either of our in vivo systems. In any case, additional measures could be employed to further enhance safety including the targeting of multiple segments with either the same or unique species-specific miRNAs. Compounded targeting would not only minimize the possibility of escape, but also further blunt replication in desired cells and hosts.",

Briefly, transmission studies were performed in an ABSL2+ facility at the Department of Veterinary Medicine, University of Maryland. Animal studies described were carried out according to the guidelines of the Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Maryland (protocol RO-09-93). For these studies ferrets were not randomized and investigators were not blinded. Prior to inoculation, 23-week-old female ferrets (Sayre, PA) were housed in holding BSL2 for 1.5 weeks to establish a baseline for temperature, weight, and general health. Serum from each ferret was assayed by NP-specific ELISA to rule out prior IAV exposure. Transponders were implanted subcutaneously to provide a means of identification and temperature determination. Ferrets were inoculated with 10 5 tissue culture infectious dose 50 (TCID 50 ), the amount of virus required to infect 50% of infected cell cultures, diluted in PBS (0.5ml total volume, 0.25ml/nostril was administered intranasally). Directly infected ferrets were inoculated one day prior to the introduction of the na\u00efve direct contact and respiratory contact ferrets. Ferrets were nasal washed (0.25ml PBS/nostril) every day following the administration of anesthesia and assayed by FluDetect (Synbiotics Corp.). Nasal washes continued until animals tested negative for two consecutive days. To prevent cross contamination, ferrets were handled in the following order: RC, DC, DI. Gloves were changed between every virus group. Once an RC ferret tested positive, they became the last to be nasal washed. All viruses, including nasal wash samples and virus stocks, were titrated in MDCK cells by TCID 50 . Titers were read using 0.5% Turkey RBC three days postinfection.",
