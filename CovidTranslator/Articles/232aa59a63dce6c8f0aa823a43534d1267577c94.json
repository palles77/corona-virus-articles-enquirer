However, mechanisms underlying coronavirus-induced autophagy remain largely unknown. In this study, we demonstrate that autophagosome formation and apparent autophagic flux are induced in cells infected with infectious bronchitis virus (IBV)a gammacoronavirus. Notably, IBV-induced autophagy was dependent on autophagy related 5 (ATG5) but not beclin1 (BECN1), although both are essential proteins in the canonical autophagy pathway. Moreover, the ER stress sensor inositol requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1), but not its substrate Xbox protein 1 (XBP1), was also essential for the induction of autophagy during IBV infection. Finally, the antiapoptotic extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) also contributed to IBV-induced autophagy. Our findings add new knowledge to the regulatory mechanisms governing coronavirus-induced autophagy, highlighting an extensive cross-talk among cellular signaling pathways during coronavirus infection.",

Under basal conditions, autophagy allows cells to break down long-lived proteins and damaged organelles. When cells are under starvation or growth factor deprivation, autophagy is also induced to recycle amino acids and fatty acids, thus maintaining the cellular metabolism and ensuring the cell survival. Autophagy is also activated under a variety of cellular stress conditions, such as hypoxia, reactive oxygen species, DNA damage, protein aggregation, or infection by intracellular pathogens (Kroemer et al., 2010) . In most scenarios, autophagy facilitates stress adaptation and cell survival. However, in other settings, autophagy constitutes an alternative pathway of cell death called autophagic cell death (Maiuri et al., 2007) .",

Each step is tightly regulated by numerous highly conserved autophagy-related genes (ATGs) (Mizushima et al., 2008) . In the canonical signaling pathway of starvation-induced autophagy, the coiled-coil, myosin-like BCL2 interacting protein (BECN1, also known as ATG6 in yeast) is an essential component of the class III phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase (PI3K) complex, which is essential for the isolation membrane nucleation and phagophore assembly (Liang et al., 1999; Furuya et al., 2005) . On the other hand, autophagy related 5 (ATG5), together with ATG12 and ATG16, constitutes a ubiquitination-like system that is essential for the elongation of isolation membranes and autophagosome formation (Mizushima et al., 1998; Suzuki et al., 2001) . A critical event catalyzed by the ATG12-ATG5-ATG16L1 complex is the conversion of microtubule-associated proteins 1A/1B light chain 3 (MAP1LC3, hereafter referred to as LC3) from a soluble form (LC3-I) to a lipidated form (LC3-II). LC3-II is stably associated with both the inner and outer membrane of autophagosomes, and its biochemical and microscopic detection has been commonly used to monitor autophagy (Klionsky et al., 2016) .",

Inside the infected cells coronavirus infection induces the formation of double membrane vesicles (DMVs), to which viral replication/transcription complexes (RTCs) are associated (Knoops et al., 2008a; Lim et al., 2016; . The morphological similarity between autophagosomes and coronavirus-induced DMVs led to some early speculations that cellular autophagy machineries may be hijacked to benefit coronavirus replication. However the co-localization of autophagosomal markers and the viral replicase proteins (Snijder et al., 2006; de Haan and Reggiori, 2008) . Remarkably, Reggiori et al. have recently shown that mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) hijacks short-living, ER-derived and LC3-coated vesicles (called EDEMosomes) for the formation of DMVs, but the conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II is not required for this process (Reggiori et al., 2010) .

By adopting the RNA interference approach, it was found that while ATG5 was required for IBV-induced autophagy, BECN1 -another upstream protein of the canonical starvation-induced pathway is dispensable. Among the three sensors of the unfolded protein response (UPR), only inositol requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1) was required for the induction of autophagy during IBV infection. Interestingly, neither of the two known downstream effectors of IRE1 -X-box protein 1 (XBP1) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), is required for IBV-induced autophagy. On the other hand, the mitogenactivated protein (MAP) kinase extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/ 2 (ERK1/2) was found to be involved in autophagy induction, which may protect the infected cells from apoptosis during IBV infection. Taken together, this study provides new insights into the cellular factors modulating coronavirus-induced autophagy. Moreover, the current data suggest that intricate cross-talks between multiple cellular signaling pathways contribute to the host response during coronavirus infection.",

To validate that IBV also induces autophagy, and to obtain a temporal profile of IBV-induced autophagy, a time course experiment was performed. As shown in Fig. 1a , H1299 cells were infected with IBV at MOI\u223c2 or incubated with UV-IBV for the indicated time. The conversion of the LC3 protein from the non-lipidated LC3-I form into the lipidated LC3-II form was widely used as an indicator of autophagy induction. According to a well-established guideline for autophagy study, the ratio between LC3-II and the loading control (such as \u03b2-actin or \u03b2-tubulin) should be used as a measurement of autophagy induction (Klionsky et al., 2016) . The LC3-II/actin ratio remained stable from 0 to 8 hpi in both IBV-infected cells and the UV-IBV-treated control (Fig. 1a) . In cells infected with IBV, the LC3-II/actin ratio significantly increased at 12 hpi, peaked at 16 hpi, and remained stable till the end of the time course. In cells incubated with UV-IBV, the LC3-II/actin ratio also gradually increased. Serum withdrawal has been known to induce autophagy (Klionsky et al., 2016) . Since cells were incubated in serumfree medium in both the IBV-infected group (to prevent the inhibitory effect of serum on IBV replication) and the UV-IBV-treated control group, the high LC3-II/actin ratio observed at later time points may be partially contributed by the effect of serum withdrawal. Nonetheless, the LC3-II/actin ratio was always higher in the IBV-infected cells compared with control of the same time point after 12 hpi, and almost 2 times higher at the peak of 16 hpi (Fig. 1a) .",

Therefore, we shifted to use another well-characterized autophagy reporter system in which the coding sequence of LC3 was fused with an Nterminal EGFP tag. We reasoned that, since the GFP-LC3 reporter is overexpressed at a much higher level than the endogenous LC3 protein, more pronounced GFP-LC3-I to GFP-LC3-II conversion would be expected in IBV-infected cells compared with that of the UV-IBV control. To this end, H1299 cells were stably transfected with the pEGFP-LC3 plasmid DNA to generate the H1299-GFP-LC3 cell line. As shown in Fig. 1b , H1299-GFP-LC3 cells were treated with the commonly used autophagy inducer rapamycin. A considerable conversion of GFP-LC3-I into GFP-LC3-II was observed in the rapamycin-treated cells, whereas only a very low basal level of GFP-LC3-II could be detected in the solvent control, suggesting that the GFP-LC3-II to actin ratio could be used as an indicator of autophagy induction. The stable cells were then infected with IBV at MOI\u223c2 or incubated with UV-IBV. As shown in Fig. 1c , the protein level of GFP-LC3-I in UV-IBV-treated cells was significantly higher than that of GFP-LC3-II throughout the time course, with the GFP-LC3-II/actin ratio steadily reduced. In sharp contrast, in the IBV-infected H1299-GFP-LC3 cells, significant conversion of GFP-LC3-I to GFP-LC3-II could be observed starting from 16 hpi. Indeed, the GFP-LC3-II to actin ratio significantly increased at 16 and 24 hpi in the IBV-infected cells (Fig. 1c) . Band intensities of total GFP-fusion proteins were gradually decreased in both the IBV-infected cells and the UV-IBV control, possibly due to the degradation of the reporter protein. As expected, the GFP-LC3 reporter system was less sensitive to autophagy induced by serum withdrawal (as observed in the UV-IBV control), thus autophagy specifically induced by IBV infection could be determined with a low background.",

            "text": "Another advantage provided by the GFP-LC3 reporter is that autophagy induction could be determined by the formation of GFP-LC3-II puncta using fluorescent microscopy (Klionsky et al., 2016) . As shown in Fig. 1d , the GFP-LC3-I in DMSO-treated cells was distributed diffusely in the cytoplasm. Rapamycin treatment caused the lipidation of GFP-LC3, thus the cytosolic GFP-LC3-II puncta were clearly visible. Next, H1299-GFP-LC3 cells were infected with IBV or mock infected before subjecting to immunofluorescence analysis using an antiserum against IBV N. As shown in Fig. 1e , no specific signal for IBV N was detected in the mock-infected cells and the GFP-LC3 protein had a diffuse pattern, suggesting an absence of autophagy induction. In cells infected with IBV for 12 h, most cells were positively stained with IBV N protein, featuring a cytoplasmic localization as previously reported (Masters, 2006) . Moreover, clusters of cells expressing a high level of IBV N protein fused with each other to form multinucleated syncytia. Notably, GFP-LC3-II puncta excluded from the nuclei could be readily detected inside these syncytia. On the other hand, in the surrounding mononucleated cells expressing a low level of IBV N, the GFP-LC3 protein is still diffusely located in the cytoplasm (Fig. 1e) . At a later time point (16 hpi), infected cells underwent massive fusion and generated large syncytia that was stained strongly with the IBV N antiserum. Moreover, extensive GFP-LC3-II puncta were observed scattered in the cytoplasm of the syncytia but were excluded from the nuclei (Fig. 1e) . The result consolidates the Western blot data and further suggests that autophagy induction is dependent on the stage of IBV infection. Significant LC3 lipidation and puncta formation can be observed only at a relatively late stage of infection when extensive syncytia are formed. In the following experiments where the GFP-LC3 reporter was used, cells were harvested for analysis at late time points.",

In this system, LC3 is fused with monomeric red fluorescence protein (mRFP) and GFP in tandem at the N-terminal. Inside the pH neutral autophagosomes, both GFP and mRFP could be detected. However, as the autophagosomes fuse with the lysosomes, GFP is quenched by the acidic lysosomal environment whereas mRFP retained its fluorescence. Therefore, only red but not green fluorescence could be detected for the autolysosomes. As a result, in a GFP/mRFP channel merged image, the autophagosomes will appear as yellow puncta (colocalized GFP and mRFP), while the autolysosomes will appear as red puncta (mRFP-only). H1299 stably expressing the tfLC3 reporter was generated (referred to H1299-tfLC3). As shown in Fig. 2b (first row), in the mock-infected and PBS-treated cells, GFP signal was diffusely distributed in the cytoplasm (similar to GFP-LC3 localization in mock-infected cells), while mRFP exhibited both a diffusely cytoplasmic and a punctated localization. H1299 cells were infected with IBV at MOI\u223c2 or incubated with UV-IBV. Protein lysates were harvested at the indicated time points and subjected to Western blot analysis using antibodies against LC3 and IBV N. Betaactin was included as the loading control. Sizes of protein ladders in kDa were indicated on the left. The ratio of LC3-II to the corresponding \u03b2-actin band was determined and normalized to the IBV-infected 0 h sample. The experiment was repeated three times with similar results, and the result of one representative experiment is shown.

The GFP/mRFP merged image indicated almost complete colocalization of GFP and mRFP, with bearly any mRFP-only puncta. Therefore, the CQ treatment almost completely inhibited the conversion of autophagosomes into autolysosomes, resulting in the blockage of autophagy flux.

In the canonical starvation-induced autophagy pathway, BECN1 is essential for the early step of nucleation of the isolation membrane, while ATG5 is required for the later step of membrane expansion and autophagosome formation. To see whether these two canonical proteins were required for IBV-induced autophagy, the siRNA-mediated knockdown approach was adopted. H1299 cells were transfected with siATG5, siBECN1, or siEGFP before infected with IBV at MOI\u223c2. As shown in Fig. 3a , the knockdown of ATG5 and (a) H1299-GFP-LC3 cells were infected with IBV at MOI\u223c2 or mock infected. After 2 h of adsorption, cells were washed, treated with 5 \u03bcM chloroquine or an equal volume of PBS, and incubated before harvested. Cell lysates were subjected to Western blot as in Fig. 1c except for that antibody of IBV S was used in the place of IBV N. Beta-actin was included as the loading control. Sizes of protein ladders in kDa were indicated. GFP-LC3II to actin ratio was determined as in Fig. 1b and normalized to the mock infected PBS treated control. The experiment was repeated three times with similar results, and the result of one representative experiment is shown. (b) H1299-tfLC3 cells were infected with IBV or mock-infected as in (a). After 2 h of adsorption, cells were treated with CQ or an equal volume of PBS as in (a). Cells were harvest and fixed, and cell nuclei were stained as in Fig. 1d . The confocal images from GFP and mRFP channels were merged to show the co-localization of GFP and mRFP. The experiment was repeated three times with similar results, and the result of one representative experiment is shown. BECN1 could be determined by the reduced protein levels in the Western blot. Notably, a significant level of LC3 lipidation was detected even in the siEGFP-transfected mock-infected cells. The high basal level of autophagy induction most likely resulted from transfection with cationic liposomes, which has been reported by others previously (Man et al., 2010) . Nevertheless, knockdown of either gene did not significantly affect IBV replication, as suggested by the similar levels of IBV N protein compared with the siEGFP control. As expected, IBV infection induced a \u223c2-fold increase of the LC3-II/actin ratio in the siEGFP control, as compared with the mock-infected cells (Fig. 3a) . Notably, no significant increase of the LC3-II/actin ratio could be detected in the ATG5-knockdown cells infected with IBV compared with the mock-infected control. In cells transfected with siBECN1 and infected with IBV, LC3-II/actin ratio was considerably higher than the mock-infected cells, although slightly lower than the IBV-infected siEGFP control (Fig. 3a) .",

As shown in Fig. 3b , a similar knockdown experiment was performed in H1299-GFP-LC3 cells and the knockdown efficiency was determined as described above. A non-targeting siRNA (siNC) was used in place of siEGFP, because siEGFP would suppress the expression of the GFP-LC3 reporter. A similar low level of GFP-LC3 lipidation was observed in the mock-infected cells, providing a relatively low background to examine autophagy specifically induced by the IBV infection. Compared with the mock-infected cells, \u223c5-fold and \u223c3-fold increase in the GFP-LC3-II/ actin ratio could be observed in cells transfected with siNC at 16 hpi and 20 hpi respectively, indicating a potent induction of autophagy (Fig. 3b) . Similarly, \u223c5-fold increase in the GFP-LC3-II/actin ratio could be observed in the IBV-infected BECN1-knockdown cells compared with mock-infected control. In sharp contrast, in ATG5-knockdown cells infected with IBV, the GFP-LC3-II/actin ratio remained at a similar level as in the mock-infected cells, indicating that IBV-induced autophagy was significantly inhibited by the depletion of ATG5. The result was further confirmed by the GFP-LC3 puncta analysis. As shown in Fig. 3c , significant levels of GFP-LC3-II punta formation induced by IBV infection could be observed in the siNC or siBECN1-transfected cells. In contrast, the GFP-LC3 puncta formation was detected at a much lower level in the IBV-infected ATG5-knockdown cells compared with the siNC control. In summary, our result shows that IBV-induced autophagy is only dependent on ATG5 but not BECN1.",

No specific protein band could be detected for ATF6, thus its knockdown was determined by RT-PCR.

Consistent with the above results, the knockdown of ATG5 reduced the lipidation of GFP-LC3 during IBV infection. In contrast, in the ATF6-, PERK-, or CHOP-knockdown cells infected with IBV, the GFP-LC3-II/ actin ratios were all similar to that of the siNC control of the same time points (Fig. 5a and b) .

There are several limitations with either of these methods. For instance, commercial LC3 antibodies are known to display higher specificity against LC3-II than LC3-I, therefore densitometry analysis comparing LC3-I and LC3-II bands is usually misleading, and thus autophagy induction should be gauged by the ratio of LC3-II normalized to internal control such as \u03b2-actin (Klionsky et al., 2016) . On the other hand, because LC3 is known to be hijacked by coronaviruses for the formation DMVs (Reggiori et al., 2010) , the LC3-II puncta detected by fluorescent microscopy might represent coronavirus-induced, LC3-Icoated vesicles but not genuine LC3-II-coated autophagosomes.

Also, because Western blot is performed using an antibody against GFP, comparison of the intensities of GFP-LC3-I and GFP-LC3-II bands is meaningful and represents their true stoichiometric ratio. Importantly, compared to endogenous LC3, the GFP-LC3 reporter is also far less sensitive to the \"background\" autophagy induced by the siRNA/plasmid DNA transfection and/or the serum withdrawal during IBV infection, making it possible to determine the autophagy specifically induced by IBV infection. Furthermore, we also examine the apparent autophagy flux using the lysosomal inhibitor chloroquine and the tfLC3 reporter system. Because the lipidation of GFP-LC3 was further increased by the chloroquine treatment and mRFP-only autolysosomes could be observed in H1299-tfLC3 cells infected with IBV, it was concluded that IBV infection did not significantly inhibit the lysosomal fusion of autophagosomes.

Notably, the co-expression of SARS-CoV nsp3, nsp4 and nsp6 is sufficient to induce DMV formation in the transfected cells (Angelini et al., 2013) . However, it is worth noting that in coronavirus-infected cells, non-structural proteins are usually produced at levels significantly lower than those in the transfected cells where their overexpression was driven by a strong promoter. Therefore, the phenotypes observed in the transfection studies might not always be physiologically relevant, and further characterization is required using suitable recombinant viruses in a genuine time course infection experiment. Unfortunately, despite our best efforts, FLAG-tagged IBV nsp6 could not be expressed at a detectable level in either H1299 or H1299-GFP-LC3 cells (data not shown). However, our result suggested that neither the BECN1-dependent signaling of the canonical autophagy pathway nor the PERK-CHOP branch of UPR is required for IBV-induced autophagy, which is consistent with the previously published result that nsp6 overexpression did not activate the starvation-induced mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)-mediated signaling or induce the expression of CHOP (Cottam et al., 2011) .",

Previously, it has been shown that the inhibition of PI3K does not affect autophagy induction in MHV-infected cells, while the knockdown or knockout of ATG5 significantly reduces autophagy induction in cells infected with MHV or IBV (Zhao et al., 2007; Cottam et al., 2011) . Consistently, we found that the GFP-LC3 lipidation/punctation during IBV infection was not affected in BECN1-knockdown cells, but almost abolished in ATG5knockdown cells. Therefore, autophagy signaling in IBV-infected cells may utilize alternative upstream pathways independent of BECN1, eventually converging with the canonical autophagic signaling at the ATG5-dependent stage of isolation membrane expansion.",

A recent study showed that three RNA viruses (poliovirus, dengue virus, and Zika virus) utilize ATG9 for membrane sculpting and recruit LC3 directly to the membranes, bypassing the requirement of ATG5-mediated LC3 lipidation (Abernathy et al., 2019) . Additionally, BECN1 is not required for the replication of poliovirus or dengue virus, while the upstream Unc-like autophagy-activating kinase may or may not be required for poliovirus-induced autophagy (Abernathy et al., 2019; Corona Velazquez et al., 2018) . Similarly, it has been previously shown that LC3 is hijacked by MHV-infected cells to facilitate the formation of DMVs, although this process appears to be independent of LC3 lipidation (Reggiori et al., 2010) . In this study, we found that ATG5 was required for LC3 lipidation/punctation in IBV-infected cells, but its knockdown did not affect IBV replication. Thus, the proteins co-opted to support coronavirus replication (such as LC3-I) may constitute only a subset of the components in the autophagic pathway, while other proteins (such as ATG5) may still be required for autophagy induction in the coronavirus-infected cells.",

In this study, we found that among the three ER stress sensors, only IRE1, but not ATF6 or PERK, was required for autophagy induction during IBV infection. As for the two proteins downstream of IRE1 signaling pathway, neither XBP1 nor JNK was required for the induction of autophagy in IBV-infected cells. This is quite different from cells treated with tunicamycin or thapsigargin, where ER stress engages the IRE1-JNK pathway to induce pro-survival autophagy (Ogata et al., 2006) . Presumably, during IBV infection, some unknown protein(s) may be responsible to mediate the signaling from activated IRE1 to ATG5 (or other ATGs in the complex), thereby bridging the signaling pathways of ER stress and autophagy.",

Whereas for other viruses such as Sindbis virus, vesicular stomatitis virus and herpes simplex virus-1, autophagy acts as a host defense mechanism to either eliminate the virus or to activate the innate immune response (Kim et al., 2010) . For coronaviruses, the membrane-associated papain-like protease 2 (PLP2) has been shown to interact with BECN1 and induce incomplete autophagy, which in turn modulates antiviral innate immunity (Chen et al., 2014) . On the other hand, selective autophagy of mitochondria was observed in cells infected with TGEV, which counteracts oxidative stress and apoptosis induced by TGEV infection (Zhu et al., 2016) . Therefore, although not essential for coronavirus replication, autophagy constitutes a very crucial aspect of virus-host interaction.
