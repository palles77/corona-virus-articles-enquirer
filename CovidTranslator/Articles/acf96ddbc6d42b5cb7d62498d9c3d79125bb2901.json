YHV (designated genotype 1) was first reported as the cause of mass mortalities in shrimp ponds in Thailand in 1990 (Limsuwan, 1991) and has since been reported in other shrimp farming regions in Southeast and East Asia (Walker et al., 2001) . It is a highly virulent pathogen that can cause total crop loss within several days of the first appearance of disease Chantanachookin et al., 1993) . GAV (genotype 2) was first observed as a persistent low-level infection in healthy P. monodon shrimp in Australia in 1994 (Spann et al., 1995) . Although far less virulent than YHV, GAV causes mortalities following experimental infection of shrimp and has been associated with a slowly progressing disease called mid-crop mortality syndrome (MCMS) (Spann et al., 1997 (Spann et al., , 2003 Callinan and Jiang, 2003) . The prevalence of GAV infection in healthy P. monodon in eastern Australia approaches 100% and it occurs commonly in healthy shrimp from Vietnam and Thailand (Walker et al., 2001; Wijegoonawardane et al., 2008a) . The four other known genotypes in the yellow head complex also occur commonly in healthy P. monodon with a distribution that extends from Mozambique in the west through South, Southeast and East Asia (Wijegoonawardane et al., 2008a) . None of these four genotypes has yet been associated with disease.",

            "text": "The yellow head complex viruses are enveloped, rod-shaped, (+) sense RNA viruses that are classified as a single species (Gill-associated virus) in the genus Okavirus, family Roniviridae, order Nidovirales (Walker et al., 2004) . The 26,662 nt YHV genome contains four long open reading frames (ORFs). ORF1a encodes a large polyprotein (pp1a) containing cis-acting papain-like protease (PLP) and 3C-like protease (3CLP) domains (Sittidilokratna et al., 2008) . ORF1b overlaps ORF1a and is expressed only as a result of a (\u22121) ribosomal frameshift at a 'slippery' sequence upstream of a predicted pseudoknot structure in the overlap region. The extended polyprotein (pp1ab) contains 'SDD' RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, helicase, metal-ionbinding, exonuclease, uridylate-specific endoribonuclease and ribose-2\u2032-O-methyl transferase domains of the replication complex (Sittidilokratna et al. 2002 (Sittidilokratna et al. , 2008 . ORF2 encodes the nucleoprotein (p20) which is the only polypeptide component of the helical nucleocapsid (Soowannayan et al., 2003; Sittidilokratna et al., 2006) . ORF3 encodes a polyprotein (pp3) that is processed at signal peptidase type 1 cleavage sites to generate the two virion envelope glycoproteins gp116 and gp64, and an N-terminal triple-membrane-spanning fragment of unknown function (Jitrapakdee et al., 2003) . The 26,235 nt GAV genome is smaller, primarily due to significant deletions in intergenic regions (IGRs), but shares \u223c79% overall nucleotide sequence identity with YHV Sittidilokratna et al., 2008) . The GAV genome organisation is similar to YHV and all identified functional domains are preserved, but GAV contains an additional small open reading frame near the 3\u2032-terminus (ORF4, 83 aa) that may be expressed at low levels in infected cells Cowley et al., 2004a; Cowley and Walker, 2008) . Like other nidoviruses, YHV and GAV transcribe a nested set of 3\u2032-coterminal, polyadenylated, genomic and sub-genomic mRNAs Sittidilokratna et al., 2008) . Partial genome sequence analysis of genotypes 3, 4 and 5 has indicated that they share a similar genome organisation and transcription strategy and are more closely related in sequence to GAV than to YHV (Wijegoonawardane et al., 2008a) .",

Total RNA was extracted from lymphoid organs and used as a template for RT-PCR amplification of a genomic region spanning the recombination breakpoints identified in the natural recombinants.

In product BL4-2, the recombination breakpoint was located in the same ORF1b region as identified in the YHV/GAV recombinants and sequence ambiguities at multiple sites indicated the likely presence of several similar recombinant genomes with similar but distinct breakpoints. In product BL4-3, the breakpoint occurred within a 16 nt region of a highly conserved domain that contains the transcription regulatory sequence (TRS) and the 5\u2032-end of the ORF2 mRNA , and its location beyond the YHV sequence insertion accounted for the smaller amplicon size.

YHV (genotype 1) was detected only in shrimp from Thailand and Taiwan with typical signs of yellow head disease. GAV (genotype 2) occurs commonly in healthy P. monodon in Australia and parts of Southeast Asia, and it has been associated with a condition called mid-crop mortality syndrome. The four other genotypes were detected in healthy P. monodon from Mozambique, India, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, Vietnam, the Philippines and Taiwan. In this paper, we report evidence of homologous genetic recombination involving four of the six genotypes (genotypes 1, 2, 3 and 5). Natural recombinants derived from genotypes 2, 3 and 5 were detected by their differential clustering in phylogenetic analyses of sequences amplified from two distant regions of the genome, and this was confirmed for several of these viruses by sequencing and SimPlot analysis of the \u223c4.6 kb genomic region encompassing the two amplicons. Genetic recombination was also demonstrated experimentally in shrimp co-infected with two of the genotypes (YHV and GAV) that have been associated with disease outbreaks in farmed shrimp in Thailand and Australia. This is the first evidence of homologous genetic recombination in viruses infecting crustaceans.",

In experimental co-infections, recombination between coronavirus strains can occur at a frequency as high as 25% (Baric et al., 1990) . Natural recombination in nidoviruses also appears to occur commonly and to have resulted in gene rearrangements and the generation of chimeric viruses with ancestors of vastly different lineages (Luytjes et al., 1988; Snijder et al., 1991; Motokawa et al., 1995) . The data reported here indicate that homologous genetic recombination between yellow head complex viruses of the Roniviridae can also occur readily, both in experimental co-infections and naturally. In this study, 10 of 30 viruses were identified as recombinant genotypes by comparative phylogenetic analysis. Although the frequency with which recombinants were generated experimentally has not yet been assessed, the identification of multiple recombinant genotypes of different conformation in individual moribund shrimp following co-infection with YHV and GAV indicates that recombination occurs readily and that at least some recombinant genomes survive multiple rounds of replication.",

            "text": "The creation and survival of a viable recombinant virus are subject to many molecular and biological constrains . There must be opportunity for co-infection of the host and simultaneous infection of an individual host cell, replication must occur at the same intracellular location, template switching must occur and generate a viable genome, and any viable recombinant virus must be suitably fit to survive competition from both parental and other recombinant viruses. The high frequency at which natural recombinant genotypes were detected in this study indicates that these requirements are readily met by roniviruses and this may reflect the frequency with which mixed infections occur in shrimp. Yellow head complex viruses occur very commonly in healthy P. monodon shrimp throughout their natural distribution range across the Indo-Pacific (Wijegoonawardane et al., 2008a) . The prevalence of GAV infection in healthy P. monodon postlarvae, juveniles and broodstock sourced from the wild and from shrimp hatcheries and farms along the east coast of Australia between 1998 and 2001 was observed to approach 100% (Walker et al., 2001) . A survey conducted in 2000 identified genotype 3 in 25 of 38 healthy P. monodon broodstock collected from hatcheries in central Thailand and a survey of \u223c200 P. monodon sampled from across the Indo-Pacific region between 1997 and 2004 detected evidence of ronivirus infection in N25% of the shrimp (Wijegoonawardane et al., 2008a) . Although there has been no systematic study of the prevalence of natural co-infection with ronivirus genotypes, co-infection with multiple shrimp viruses appears to occur commonly (Manivannan et al., 2002; Chayaburakul et al., 2004; Flegel et al., 2004; Hoa et al., 2005; Natividad et al., 2006) . This is likely a consequence of life-long persistent infections, the efficiency of both vertical and horizontal transmission, the lack of adaptive immunity in shrimp, and husbandry practices which commonly mix the progeny of multiple broodstock to seed aquaculture ponds (Walker et al., 2001; Johnson et al., 2008; Walker and Mohan, 2009) .",

This most likely reflects the bias of sample numbers from this region where these three genotypes are most prevalent (Wijegoonawardane et al., 2008a) . However, it may also indicate that the natural course of virus-host co-evolution has been disrupted by the vast international trade in live shrimp. In Australia, where the importation of live crustaceans is prohibited, GAV is endemic and occurs at very high prevalence in P. monodon. No other genotype has been detected in Australia despite the analysis of very large numbers of shrimp Fig. 4 . Differential RT-PCR amplification of a genome region spanning the C-terminus of ORF1b to the N-terminus of ORF2 using RNA isolated from shrimp infected with YHV or GAV alone or co-infected with YHV and GAV (samples AL9 and BL4). PCR utilised the YHV-specific and GAV-specific primer combinations YHV-ORF1b-2f:GAV-ORF2-2r and GAV-ORF1b-2f:YHV-ORF2-2r (Table S1 ). Amplified DNA was resolved in a 2% agarose-TAE gel.

Analysis of the limited numbers of samples sourced from India and Mozambique also suggests geographic isolation of genotypes 4 and 6 in regions where importation of live shrimp for aquaculture is rare (Wijegoonawardane et al., 2008a) . This suggests that P. monodon is the natural host of GAV and possibly other genotypes and that there has been long-term co-evolution of the genotypes in this species. However, contrary to the situation in Australia, India and Mozambique, there has been a prolific trade in live P. monodon amongst countries in Southeast and East Asia, including the importation of stock from Australia and elsewhere. This appears to have provided adequate opportunity for new genotypes to be introduced and mixed with genotypes endemic to the region.",

            "text": "Although YHV/GAV recombinant viruses were readily generated in experimental co-infections, no evidence of natural recombination involving YHV was found. There are reports that YHV (genotype 1) can occur as a persistent infection in healthy shrimp (Pasharawipas et al., 1997; Natividad et al., 2002; de la Rosa-Velez et al., 2006) . However, in the only published prevalence study in which genotypes have been determined (Wijegoonawardane et al., 2008a) , genotype 1 was detected only in P. monodon from yellow head disease outbreaks in Thailand and Taiwan. There is no evidence that any other genotype can cause yellow head disease and, although GAV can cause mortalities, the LD 50 of YHV (10 \u2212 11.5 ) determined in bioassays is 10 6 to 10 8 -fold lower than GAV (Sittidilokratna et al., 2009) . This suggests that YHV may have undergone a recent genetic change that has substantially elevated its virulence for P. monodon or that it may be naturally endemic in another, more resistant, penaeid or metapenaeid shrimp species. If the latter, the opportunity for co-infection involving YHV and another genotype could be relatively rare. Nevertheless, the widespread prevalence of infection with other genotypes and the capability for YHV to recombine experimentally with GAV indicate that the generation of natural YHV recombinants may be inevitable and have significant consequences for the spread of virulent genotypes and disease in penaeid shrimp.",

            "text": "Sequence analysis of three of 10 natural recombinant viruses identified a likely recombination hotspot just upstream of the Cterminus of the ORF1b coding region. Recombination hotspots have been identified in many animal and plant viruses, including coronaviruses (Makino et al., 1986; Banner et al., 1990; Jia et al., 1995; Lee and Jackwood, 2000; van Vugt et al., 2001) , bromoviruses (Nagy et al., 1999) geminiviruses (Monci et al., 2002) and luteoviruses (Moonan et al., 2000) . Although specific sequence elements, such as stretches of AU-rich sequence, may enhance recombination frequency (Shapka and Nagy, 2004) , a study of mouse hepatitis coronavirus has shown that recombination events are generally random and that hotspots arise as a result of subsequent selective pressure on the pool of recombinant genomes rather than elevated site-specific recombination rates (Banner and Lai, 1991) . Analysis of YHV/GAV recombinants generated experimentally under conditions in which the selective pressure was relatively limited identified recombination breakpoints in a similar genomic region to the hotspot identified in natural recombinants (the ORF1b Cterminus and the downstream IGR). However, as PCR primers used to detect the experimentally-generated recombinants were intentionally targeted to this region, the possibility that recombination has occurred with similar frequency in other regions of the genome has not yet been exhaustively explored. The location of the identified hotspot in the natural recombinants is near the junction between the 5\u2032-terminal ORF1a and ORF1b genes encoding non-structural replicase proteins and downstream ORF2 and ORF3 genes encoding the virion structural proteins. Natural selection of such recombinants may be driven by a need to maintain efficient interactions amongst these functionally distinct sets of proteins.",

As yellow head complex nidoviruses occur at high prevalence in healthy wild and cultured shrimp, methods that specifically detect pathogenic types are essential for farm-level diagnosis and the containment of transboundary disease spread. These methods are currently based on detection of YHV and GAV and their discrimination from other 'nonpathogenic' genotypes (Wongteerasupaya et al., 1997; Cowley et al., 2004b; Wijegoonawardane et al., 2008b) .

A maximum LR value is determined from the values calculated by random division of the aligned sequences into two regions to determine which possess the longest tree branch lengths between the recombinant and each parent. The breakpoint nucleotide is predicted to that flanked by sequences possessing the highest maximum LR. To assess whether the recombination model provides a significantly better fit to the data set than the null hypothesis, a Z test is used to analyse the maximum LR values against a null distribution of LR values generated using the Monte Carlo simulation of randomised sequences. Sequences were simulated 300 times using the maximum-likelihood model parameters and sequence lengths from the real data using Seq-Gen (Rambaut and Grassly, 1997) . Simulated sequences were then subjected to the same breakpoint analysis as the real data to produce the distribution of likelihood ratios expected if no recombination had occurred among them.",
