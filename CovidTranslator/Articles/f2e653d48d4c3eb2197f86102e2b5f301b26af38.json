            "text": "A B S T R A C T Acute hepatopancreatic necrosis disease (AHPND), also known as Early mortality syndrome (EMS), is a recently emerged lethal disease that has caused major economic losses in shrimp aquaculture. The etiologic agents are Vibrio spp. that carry Photorhabdus Insect-Related (Pir) toxin genes pirA and pirB. A multiplex SYBR Green realtime PCR was developed that detects pirA, pirB, and two internal control genes, the shrimp 18S rRNA and the bacterial 16S rRNA genes in a single reaction. The pirB primers amplify the 3'-end of the pirB gene allowing the detection of Vibrio spp. mutants that contain a complete deletion of pirA and the partial deletion of pirB. The assay also detects mutants that contain the entire pirA gene and the deletion of the pirB gene. Since both toxin genes are needed for disease development, this assays can distinguish between pathogenic strains of Vibrio spp. that cause AHPND in shrimp and mutants that do not cause disease. The amplicons for pirA, pirB, 18S rRNA and 16S rRNA showed easily distinguishable melting temperatures of 78.21 \u00b1 0.18, 75.20 \u00b1 0.20, 82.28 \u00b1 0.34 and 85.41 \u00b1 0.21\u00b0C respectively. Additionally, a duplex real-time PCR assay was carried out by designing TaqMan probes for the pirA and pirB primers. The diagnostic sensitivity and specificity was compared between the SYBR Green and TaqMan assays. Both assays showed similar sensitivity with a limit of detection being 10 copies for pirA and pirB, and neither assays showed any cross reaction with other known bacterial and viral pathogens in shrimp. The high sensitivity of both assays make them suitable for the detection of low copies of the pirA and pirB genes in AHPND causing Vibrio spp. as well as for detecting non-pathogenic mutants.",

The binary toxin pirAB has been confirmed to be the etiological agent for AHPND [11] . To date, two conventional PCR based methods have been reported to detect both toxins genes pirA and pirB, a duplex conventional PCR reported by Han et al. [3] and a two-tube nested AP4 PCR developed by Dangtip et al. [13] . However, the two-tube nested AP4 PCR cannot detect deletion mutants that have only one gene pirA or pirB. A qPCR assay that detects pirA but does not detect mutants with the deletion of pirB has been reported [14] . The detection of both types of mutants is fundamental for the study of plasmid transmission dynamics and for recording the presence of the virulence plasmid since a recent study [2] suggests that the pirA and pirB genes may be lost or acquired by horizontal gene transfer via transposition or homologous recombination. In fact, the genome of a mutant strain of V. parahaemolyticus has been published that lacks the entire pirA gene and has a partial deletion of the 5\u2032-end of the pirB gene [15] . In this study, we report a multiplex SYBR Green real-time PCR that detects the pirA and pirB toxin genes, and two internal control genes, the shrimp 18S rRNA and the bacterial 16S rRNA. Furthermore, we report a duplex TaqMan PCR that also detects pirA and pirB simultaneously. These assays will greatly aid in the detection and monitoring of low quantities of AHPND causing Vibrio spp. and mutant strains containing either pirA or pirB.",

In AHPND-causing Vibrio spp., the binary toxin genes are flanked by transposes [11] . It has been proposed that due to a unique genome organization of the V. parahaemolyticus virulence plasmid, it may be lost or acquired by horizontal gene transfer via transposition or homologous recombination [2] . Further evidence of the transfer of these genes between bacteria is reported by Duran-Avelar et al. [10] . These authors detected the first non-Vibrio bacterium, M. luteus, that contains the pirA and pirB genes. It has not been reported if M. luteus is capable of causing AHPND. The discovery of several species of Vibrio and non-Vibrio bacteria carrying the binary toxin genes and causing AHPND suggest that there is an active transmission of the pirA and pirB genes between different bacteria and that these bacteria could acquire or lose pathogenicity. Therefore, the assays reported in this manuscript are fundamental tools for the study of plasmid transmission dynamics and for the detection of mutant strains that contain either pirA or pirB.",

            "text": "Multiplex SYBR Green real-time PCR using melt curve analysis has been previously used for the simultaneous detection of human pathogens (metapheumovirus, rhinovirus, enterovirus and coronavirus), plant pathogens (Plum pox virus), avian pathogens (avian influenza viruses) and bovine pathogens (Clostridium botulinum) [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] . The SYBR Green real-time PCR has been used for the detection and quantification of several shrimp pathogens including IHHNV, WSSV, TSV and YHV [24, 25] . Considering the sensitivity and specificity of the SYBR Green assay when compared with the TaqMan assay and the low cost of the SYBR Green dyes, the method described here is a suitable tool for the detection of Vibrio spp. that cause AHPND and mutants strains that contain either the pirA or pirB gene. Furthermore, the SYBR Green assay described here has two internal controls (the shrimp 18S rRNA and the bacterial 16S rRNA) to avoid false negatives due to the Table 4 Mean Ct and melt temperatures of the different strains of Vibrio spp. and five samples of infected tissue. The poor DNA quality or the inhibition during amplification. Based on the need, the assay can be performed in a single or duplex format for the detection of either one or both toxin genes. Duplex TaqMan real-time PCR has also been extensively used for the simultaneous detection of avian pathogens (avian reovirus and Myoplasma synoviae), human pathogens (Eschrichia coli O157), amphibian pathogens (Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis and Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans) and shrimp pathogens (WSSV, Taura Syndrome Virus and PstDNV1) [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] . The sensitivity and specificity of the TaqMan assay was equal to the SYBR Green assay and it can also be used in a single format to detect just one of the two toxin genes. An added advantage of the TaqMan assay is it requires much less time for completion (27 min) since no melt curve analysis is needed making this a valuable tool in detecting Vibrio spp. that causes AHPND as well as mutant strains. However, TaqMan assay is costlier than the SYBR Green assay due to the higher cost of the reagents and the probes.",
