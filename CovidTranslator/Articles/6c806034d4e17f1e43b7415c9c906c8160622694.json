Although there is growing literature on influenza transmission at national and international scales, little attention has been paid to a city scale. This article aims to understand the spatial-temporal transmission of influenza and identify its health risks in the urbanized area of Buffalo, New York. An individual-based spatially explicit model is established to replicate an urban contact network, and simulate influenza epidemics. The resulting epidemic curves and infection intensity maps are used to analyze the transmission dynamics, possible contributing factors, and high-risk places and times.",

The places and times associated with higher risk are closely related to spatial heterogeneity in the population, and travel behaviors of individuals. Interestingly, these high-risk places and times are insensitive to where infection sources are introduced. This research suggests that high-risk places can be pre-identified as control targets using census and land use data. In addition, a better understanding on the city-wide travel of individuals is critical for designing proper timelines for influenza control. These suggestions will be valuable for local health agencies as they prepare to combat new waves of H1N1 influenza.",

The total economic burden of influenza epidemics amounted to $87.1 billion/year (Molinari et al., 2007) . In recent years, influenza has obtained unprecedented attention due to widespread occurrence of novel influenza viruses, such as the bird flu and H1N1 flu. A major public health concern is the possibility of a pandemic, which could be as severe as the 1918 Spanish flu (Webby & Webster, 2003) . This great concern has motivated scientists and health policy makers to model influenza epidemics and predict transmission dynamics (Coburn, Wagner, & Blower, 2009) .",

The transmission is often fostered and amplified in cities and urban areas. The dense human contacts in a city form fast and uncontrolled channels for transmission (Meade & Earickson, 2005) . In addition, cities can serve as hubs that transmit diseases to small ''satellite\" towns, resulting in regional or even global pandemics (Grenfell, Bjornstad, & Kappey, 2001) . Although the importance of cities is widely recog-nized, little research has been devoted to modeling and understanding the city-wide influenza transmission. A possible challenge is to represent and analyze much detailed information at such a small scale. In recent literature, there has been seen a few efforts to model city-scale disease epidemics, such as the Epi-Sims model by Eubank et al. (2004) , and the BioWar model by Carley et al. (2006) . These studies have been focused on modeling issues at the city scale, but little attention has been paid to the spatial-temporal transmission of influenza, possible factors contributing to transmission, and resultant urban health risks.",

These individual-based models use a bottom-up approach, which starts with discrete individuals of a population, and tries to understand how the population's properties emerge from interactions among individuals (Grimm & Railsback, 2005) . This approach offers three advantages for modeling disease transmission. First, the heterogeneity of both individuals and their interactions can be explicitly represented, as can the subsequent heterogeneity in disease transmission (Keeling, 1999; Koopman & Lynch, 1999) . Second, the randomness of disease infection between a pair of individuals can be captured as a stochastic process. Third, by aggregating individual infections, the outcome of disease transmission can be studied at multiple scales, such as the community, city, national and international scales. These three advantages bring the epidemic modeling closer to reality than other traditional models. However, the increased realism demands more assumptions to be made and more parameters to be estimated, bringing more complexity in modeling (Judson, 1994; Koopman, 2002) .",

Individuals are assigned to different communities to satisfy a set of real demographic distributions, such as the distributions of age, gender, and household size. Nationwide workplace data and traveling statistics are utilized to simulate individual travel behavior within and between communities, often following a distance-decay law. These models successfully replicate wave-like and hierarchical diffusion patterns that occur in geographically extensive areas. However, by covering such larger geographic areas, these models often simplify or neglect the detailed information within a city, such as the specific locations of households and workplaces, the urban transportation network, and the daily activities of individuals.

The information about who infects whom, and where and when the infection happens can be traced and recorded. The increased details, however, introduce more complexity to the model, and thus only a few city-scale models exist so far. Another issue is that few of these city-scale models have been used to explore the potential patterns, contributing factors, and health risks of influenza transmission. The relevant literature mainly reports model establishment and tests control strategies, but influenza transmission itself is under-studied. This study aims to fill this knowledge gap using an individual-based city-scale model.",

The contacts among individuals are assumed to take place during three time periods in a day and at four types of locations (Fig. 2 ). The three time periods include the daytime (e.g., 9 am-6 pm), pastime (e.g., 6 pm-12 am), and nighttime (e.g., 12 am-9 am), while the four types of locations include homes, workplaces, service places, and neighbor households. Under this spatial-temporal frame, individuals may have two types of contacts: close contacts and occasional contacts. Close contacts happen at homes, workplaces, and neighbor households, where an individual has contact with all the other individuals in the same location. Occasional con-tacts happen in service places, where an individual only has contact with a limited number of individuals.

A worker is randomly assigned to a workplace that satisfies two criteria (Bian et al., 2008) . First, the employer type of the workplace from the business databases should match the employer type of the worker from the census data. Second, the shortest distance between the home and workplace in the real road system should match the trip distance to work estimated from the census data (trip duration to work \u00c2 speed of a trip mode). Unlike ordinary workers, school-aged individuals in each household are assigned to a nearest school as their workplace.

The first set is detailed travel survey data from GBNRTC, providing information about types and frequencies of services needed. The second is a subset of workplaces that are identified as service places based on their NAICS code (8109 out of 36,839 workplaces). The third is the attributes for individuals and households created for the nighttime and daytime populations. Using the frequency statistics in travel survey as constraints, the total number of trips for a household is first determined. The trips of a household are then allocated to workers in the household and then other members of the household. Each trip is assigned, according to frequency statistics, with a trip mode, a trip duration, one of three types of ser- vice trips (workplace-to-service, home-to-service, and service-toservice), and one of five types of services (Table 2) . Given a type of service trip and a type of service, the model assigns an individual to a service place or a neighbor household that matches the trip distance (speed of trip mode \u00c2 trip duration) (Bian et al., 2008) . In this manner, a set of attributes regarding pastime activities of individuals can be generated, as shown in Fig. 3 . These activity attributes help create the pastime population and link it to the other two populations. The establishment of the three linked populations forms a spatially explicit and temporally dynamic contact network. The contacts among individuals within a location cause the local transmission of influenza, while the travel of individuals between the four types of locations leads to spatial dispersion of influenza.",

At some point in time, a susceptible individual comes into the latent status after receiving influenza virus. The receipt of infection starts a 2-day latent period, during which influenza develops internally and cannot be transmitted. At the end of the latent period, the individual becomes infectious and can transmit influenza to other susceptible individuals. The length of infectious period varies from 4 to 7 days depending on the age or health status of the individual (Heymann, 2004) .

To initialize the epidemic, five infectious individuals, as infection sources, are seeded into the study area on the first day of the simulation. For a comprehensive analysis, four seeding scenarios are devised based on the aforementioned three-in-one urban structure. Specifically, the five infection sources are randomly distributed: (1) in the entire study area, (2) only in the CBD (e.g., at bus terminals), (3) only in the transition zone (e.g., at local medical centers), and (4) only in the suburbs (e.g., at airports). The influenza epidemic is simulated over 50 realizations under each scenario, resulting in a total of 200 (50 \u00c2 4) realizations.",

The peak time and the number of new cases at the peak time are two major characteristics of the curve. To reduce the randomness, the epidemic curve and two associated characteristics are estimated by averaging 50 model realizations. To display the spatial spread of influenza, infection intensity maps are created by the following three steps. First, every infection event occurring in a given time interval is plotted as a point at the location of infection, such as the home, workplace, service place, or neighbor household. Second, the study area is divided into a cell grid for subsequent estimation. The reason for rasterization is because plotting tens of thousands of points produces unclear spatial patterns, while rasterization helps provide a clear and reasonable representation. Third, a kernel density function is used to estimate the magnitude of new infections occurring within every cell during a time interval, i.e., the infection intensity at a cell location. A high-intensity value indicates that the corresponding cell location is undergoing a rapid growth in the number of infections.",

            "text": "To calibrate the age-specific infection rates I age , three indices are estimated and compared to established literature, including a basic reproductive number (R 0 ), an overall attack rate, and proportions of infection by location. First, R 0 is the number of individuals in a susceptible population that are directly infected by the introduction of a single infectious individual (Diekmann, Heesterbeek, & Metz, 1990) . Recent studies on observed data have reported that the R 0 of influenza ranges from 0.9 to 2.1 with a mean of 1.3 (Chowell, Miller, & Viboud, 2007; Ferguson et al., 2005; Mills, Robins, & Lipsitch, 2004) . In this study, R 0 is estimated by tracing the number of infections directly caused by the infection sources. Second, the overall attack rate is the proportion of total population that is infected during an epidemic. The observed overall attack rate for influenza epidemics ranges from 10% to 20% of the population (CDC., 2008; Cox & Subbarao, 2000) . Third, the proportion of infections at households (including homes and neighbor households), workplaces, and service places are estimated to be in the ranges of 47-51%, 37-42%, 11-12%, respectively (Longini & Halloran, 2005; . To match the three indices to established literature (Table 3 ), the infection rates I age for children, adults, and seniors are calibrated to 0.1, 0.08, and 0.09, respectively. In addition, the effectiveness of occasional contacts for infection E ocassional_contact is calibrated to 0.2. To validate the model, weekly reports of laboratory confirmed specimens in the 2004-2005 influenza season are collected from New York State Department of Health (NYSDOH, 2005) . As shown in Fig. 6 , the time course of the epidemic is well predicted by the model, although the magnitude of simulated cases is much larger than the laboratory data. The first possible reason is that a large number of infected individuals (more than 80%) may choose selfcare and are reluctant to seek health care (McIsaac, Levine, & Goel, 1998; Stoller et al., 1993) . These infected individuals cannot be identified and reported. Second, for those who seek health care, only a small portion of their specimens are submitted for laboratory testing. Therefore, the number of influenza cases is always highly under-reported, and a complete data is rather difficult to collect. The laboratory data, so far, may be the best available touchstone for model validation. In this sense, our model performs well in predicting the trend, and at least allows the estimate of a worse case result. The calibration and validation indicate that the established model is a close representation of influenza transmission. Based on this model, the information about every infection event can be traced, such as who infects whom, and where and when the infection occurs. This information provides detailed clues for analyzing the spatial-temporal transmission of influenza. ",

An abrupt rise begins approximately after Day 40, and subsequently the number of daily new cases peaks at around Day 70. The average peak number is 5450 new cases, about 5.54\u2030 of the population. After the peak, the number of daily new cases drops quickly until the end of the epidemic.

In addition, there are a few lowintensity areas distant from the seeding locations, most likely to occur within the downtown Buffalo, the downtown Niagara Falls, the University of Buffalo, and the Niagara University. After Day 40, as the number of new infections increases exponentially, the spatial spread of influenza tends to be similar for all four seeding scenarios. For this reason, Fig. 9 only displays the spatial spread of influenza under the random seeding scenario, while the other three scenarios are reported in the supplementary document.

This is because the number of influenza cases increases slowly before Day 40, and the response time is relatively sufficient. The epidemic can potentially be avoided by applying voluntary control strategies, such as mass vaccination programs, and campaigns that promote preventive behaviors. If the early control cannot be achieved, the number of cases would increase dramatically. Under this circumstance, mandatory control strategies, such as case isolation, contact tracing, and household quarantine, should be implemented to mitigate the impacts of the epidemic. The weekly variation in the epidemic curves also suggests a possible control strategy that extends the weekend period by 1 or 2 days. Because most workplaces and schools are closed simultaneously during the weekends, fewer close contacts may occur than those in weekdays, resulting in fewer infections. The effectiveness of this weekend extension strategy is worthy of investigation.",

Next, the new infections rapidly spread over the entire study area (expansion), probably because of the frequent travel of individuals between the CBD, transition zone, and suburbs. Subsequently, most locations in the study area experience a rapid and heterogeneous growth in infections (fast city-wide growth). As time proceeds, the growth of infections remains widespread but starts to slow down (slow city-wide growth).

High-risk times occur when the total number of infections rises significantly, or when the spatial extent of affected areas expands rapidly. Days 41-60 and Days 61-80 are two high-risk time periods corresponding to the stages of expansion and fast city-wide growth, respectively. On the other hand, high-risk places can be identified as areas with extremely high intensity of infection. The downtown areas of both cities are at high risk because they have the highest densities of residents and businesses. Similarly, the town center of Kenmore is also sug-gested to be a high-risk place because of its intensive land use for residences, commerce and industry. The university campuses are large groups of individuals with dense within-group contacts, and they thus are at high risk. Likewise, the industrial park in southern Buffalo is another high-risk place, because it is a cluster of large-scale chemical factories with a large number of workers. Once influenza is identified in the study area, these high-risk places should be monitored under close surveillance and be targeted by control efforts with priority.",

One of the two major factors is the spatial heterogeneity in the city, in terms of the population distribution and land use patterns (households and businesses). This factor directly influences the spatial layout of disease transmission. Areas with dense population or intensive land use patterns always end up with a high intensity of infection, while sparsely populated areas have relatively low intensity. The other major factor is the travel of individuals in the city, which has a profound effect on the temporal sequence of transmission. Without frequent travel of individuals between the CBD, transition zone, and suburbs, the infection can only expand locally around the infection sources. The city-wide travel of individuals quickly transports influenza viruses to everywhere else, leading to the rapid expansion of affected areas.",

Regardless of where the infection sources are seeded, both the spatial layout and the temporal sequence of influenza transmission are similar, except for the early stage. It is intuitive that the spatial layout of transmission is similar under different seeding scenarios, because it is primarily determined by the inherent population distribution and land use patterns. Surprisingly, the temporal sequence of transmission also remains similar, and is insensitive to where infection sources are seeded. A possible reason is that individuals commute frequently between the three zones of the city, and can easily reach everywhere in the study area. Once the infection sources infect a sufficient number of surrounding individuals, the influenza viruses can be transported to places of high risks, from where similar spatialtemporal patterns of infection start to occur. This finding implies that wherever the initial infections are found, the control plan does not need a major change, and the control efforts may be only applied at fixed times and places. Further investigations of this finding are warranted.",

            "text": "There are three limitations of this study due to the complex disease system in a city. First, the behaviors of susceptible individuals do not change during the epidemic. In reality, these individuals may be influenced by their contacts, and spontaneously take preventive behaviors to protect themselves. Second, the simulation of population involves the disaggregation of census data, and assumes independence between a few of demographic variables. This independence assumption helps reduce the modeling complexity, but may also introduce biases in simulation. Existing individual data, such as Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS), could be used to improve the simulation. Finally, this study assumes that immunity is obtained through early vaccination before the epidemic or through infection during the epidemic. It is also possible that individuals can gain immunity from previous epidemics, and therefore the immunity rate may be under-estimated. Although compensation for these limitations may improve the results, it also greatly increases the complexity of the model. It has been argued that the goal of modeling is not to predict exactly what may happen during an epidemic, but rather to observe how the epidemic may proceed and encourage appropriate questions. In this sense, the model results provide valuable knowledge regarding city-wide influenza transmission.",

An individual-based spatially explicit model has been developed to simulate influenza transmission through an urban contact network. The simulation results indicate a complex pattern of influenza transmission in a five-stage process. The complexity is attributable to three factors: the spatial heterogeneity in the population, the frequent city-wide travel of individuals, and the distribution of infection sources. The first factor primarily contributes to the spatial layout of disease transmission, while the second has a profound effect on the temporal sequence of transmission. The third factor, the infectionsource distribution, only affects spatial-temporal transmission at the early stage, but its effect is largely weakened later by the city-wide travel of individuals. Therefore, the high risks of infection occur not only at the same locations, but also at almost the same times, regardless of where the infection sources are introduced. A number of studies may have reported the spatial similarity in high-risk places, but the temporal similarity has not been revealed before this study.",
