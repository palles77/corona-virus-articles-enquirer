As of this time, there is no known effective pharmaceutical treatment, although it is much needed for patient contracting the severe form of the disease. The aim of this systematic review was to summarize the evidence regarding chloroquine for the treatment of COVID-19. Methods: PubMed, EMBASE, and three trial Registries were searched for studies on the use of chloroquine in patients with COVID-19. Results: We included six articles (one narrative letter, one in-vitro study, one editorial, expert consensus paper, two national guideline documents) and 23 ongoing clinical trials in China. Chloroquine seems to be effective in limiting the replication of SARS-CoV-2 (virus causing COVID-19) in vitro. Conclusions: There is rationale, pre-clinical evidence of effectiveness and evidence of safety from long-time clinical use for other indications to justify clinical research on chloroquine in patients with COVID-19. However, clinical use should either adhere to the Monitored Emergency Use of Unregistered Interventions (MEURI) framework or be ethically approved as a trial as stated by the World Health Organization. Safety data and data from high-quality clinical trials are urgently needed.",

As much of the data on COVID-19 are coming from Asia, no language restrictions were imposed (see detailed search strategy in Supplement 1). The search was expanded using a snowballing method applied to the references of retrieved papers. We also searched the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry, Clinicatrial. gov and the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) to identify ongoing trials. Two authors (AC, MI) independently screened the databases and the trial registries and extracted relevant information (MI, GI). Discrepancies and doubts about relevance of the sources were solved by consensus with two more authors (AG, SE). We did not register the systematic review protocol because we anticipated the very limited available evidence on the topic and due to the urgency of the matter.

The authors described that chloroquine is known to block virus infection by increasing endosomial ph and by interfering with the glycosylation of cellular receptor of SARS-CoV.

No information was provided on the method used to achieve consensus [7] . Based on in vitro evidence and still unpublished clinical experience, the panel recommended chloroquine phosphate tablet, at a dose of 500 mg twice per day for 10 days, for patients diagnosed as mild, moderate and severe cases of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, provided that there were no contraindications to the drug. The panel recommended using several precautions, including blood testing to rule out the development of anemia, thrombocytopenia or leukopenia as well as serum electrolyte disturbances and/or hepatic and renal function dysfunction. Also recommended were routine electrocardiography to rule out the development of QT interval prolongation or bradycardia and patient interviews to seek the appearance of visual and/or mental disturbance/deterioration. The panel recommended avoiding concurrent administration of other drugs known to prolong the QT interval (i.e. chinolones, macrolides, ondansetron) as well as various antiarrhythmic, antidepressant and antipsychotic drugs [7] . The Dutch Center of Disease control (CDC), in a public document on its website, suggested to treat severe infections requiring admission to the hospital and oxygen therapy or admitted to the ICU with chloroquine, [8] . However, the document also stated that treating patients only with optimal supportive care is still a reasonable option, due to lack of supportive evidence. The suggested regimen in adults consists of 600 mg of chloroquine base (6 tablets A-CQ 100 mg) followed by 300 mg after 12 h on day 1, then 300 mg \u00d7 2/die per os on days 2-5 days. This document also underlined 1) the needs for stopping the treatment at day 5 to reduce the risk of side effects, considering the long half-life of the drug (30 h); 2) the need to differentiate between regimens based on chloroquine phosphate and chloroquine base since 500 mg of the first correspond to 300 mg of the second [8].",

The results of these trials will be the first available on humans, since studies published to date on the characteristics and management of patients with COVID-19 did not report data about chloroquine use [1, [12] [13] [14] [15] . Of note, the WHO published a generic protocol for randomized clinical trials to investigate the clinical efficacy and safety of drugs in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 (i.e. a \"master template\" for researching drugs in this setting) [16] .",

Additional information on chloroquine will soon be released in the context of the evolving outbreak. Timely release of this information can be of importance due to the growing number of infected patients, and the absence of licensed specific drugs. Meanwhile, the recommendations for \"Clinical management of severe acute respiratory infection when novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection is suspected\", published by the WHO, confirm that there is currently no evidence from RCTs to inform on specific drug treatment of COVID-19 and that unlicensed treatments should be administered only in the context of ethically-approved clinical trials or the Monitored Emergency Use of Unregistered Interventions Framework (MEURI), under strict monitoring [17] . The WHO therefore seems to view chloroquine as experimental. The authors tend to agree with this viewpoint. But even off-label use of chloroquine may be accompanied by several concerns; the first is patient safety. Such use should be accompanied by close monitoring. An epidemic is hardly the ideal setting to do this. The ethical approach to off-label drug use also differs between countries, raising questions regarding equity. Finally, chloroquine remains a pivotal drug in the treatment of Malaria in many places in the world. Off label drug use can create major drug shortages [18] .",
