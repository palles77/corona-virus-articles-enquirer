The water phase separated by centrifugation was layered onto a linear sucrose density gradient (10-60%) in a Beckman SW25.2 rotor and centrifuged at 24 000 r.p.m, for 4 h. Fractions with densities of 1.18--1.20 g ml -I were pooled and centrifuged at 77 000 \u00d7 g for 1 h.

The plates were allowed to stand overnight at 4\u00b0C, washed four times with 0.85% NaC1 solution containing 0.02% Tween-20, and 100 pl of the test serum diluted 100-fold with PBS containing 10% calf serum and 0.05% Tween-20 was added to each well. After incubation at 37\u00b0C for 1 h, the plates were washed, and 100 gl of optimal dilution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit antibody against porcine IgG (Miles Lab., U.S.A.) was added to each well. After incubation at 37\u00b0C for 1 h, each well was washed, received 100 pl of substrate solution and was incubated at 25\u00b0C for 20 min in a dark room. The substrate solution was prepared by dissolving 0-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride at a concentration of 0.1 mg m1-1 in 0.1 M citric acid--0.2 M Na2HPO4 buffer (pH 4.8) and adding 0.2 pl m1-1 of 30% H202. At the end of incubation, the reaction was stopped with 3 N H2SOa solution and absorbancy measurement was performed at a wave length of 492 nm. The value obtained by subtracting the absorbance of the control antigen from that of the viral antigen was taken as the ELISA value.",
