In this study, we investigated molecular diversity, phylogenetic relationships, and protein characterization of Fujian field samples with other PEDV reference strains. Sequence analysis of the S1 and sM genes showed that each sample had unique characteristics, and the sample P55 may be differentiated from the others by the unique deletions and insertions of sM gene. Phylogenetic analysis based on S1 or sM gene, which have high levels of variations, indicated that each sample was related to the specific reference strain, and this finding was consistent with the protein characterization prediction analysis. The study is useful to better understand the prevalence of PEDV and its prevention and control in Fujian.",

The alignment analysis indicated that five sequences including P68, F422, CH/ Interestingly, most of the mutations were observed in the N-terminal region. These variations of P68 and F422 were probably due to mutation of the gene with filed strains. P55 and DR13 consists of another group (Group 2, Fig. 1 ) with 8 specific nucleotide changes, and the mutations occurred in the middle of S1 gene, interestingly, the purine (C/G) and pyrimidine (A/T) was found interchanged (C/G$A/T). The relationships of Group 1 and Group 2 were testified by their deduced amino acids. The sequences of Group 1 were found to have a long deletion at the initial followed by a short deletion. The mutations of Group 2 were found to have a deletion at position 157 and a substitution at position 329 (S?F). In terms of potential asparagine (N)linked glycosylation sites, only 11 sites were found in Group 1, much less than Group 2 (14 for P55 and 15 for DR13). Unlike the result by Lee et al.

Although there were so many mutations in this segment, the first unique characteristic was the deletion in the sM gens of CH/GSJIII/07 and P55. Compared to CH/GSJIII/07, P55 was found to be more viable due to the existence of insertion within the C-terminus domain, the unique point mutations and less asparagine (N)linked glycosylation sites. The long deletion of sM gene, which was also found in the field strain DR13 (Accession number: JQ023161) and its attenuated strain (Accession number: JQ023162) [25] , led to reduced pathogenicity and induced protective immune response in pigs [24] . Remarkably, similar results were found in P55 and there were no significant mutations found in the sequences of other structural protein genes including M, N (data not shown), and S gene, whether the mutated strain reduced its pathogenicity or not needs further study. The loss of sM resulted in attenuation of the virus in the natural host. However, we found that the PEDV with long deletion of sM gene also caused typical clinical signs of PEDV infection, the pathogenesis mechanism of the virus and how the sM mutant strain comes from also need to be clarified. In general, the variation in sM gene Different from the various diversities of sM gene, the S1 region of the 3 Fujian samples have unique mutations in common. Coronaviruses have transcription regulatory sequences (TRSs) that include a highly conserved core sequence 5 0 -CUAAAC-3 or a related sequence at upstream of encoding genes [26] . Though the sequence ATAAAC, AGAAAC, and CTAGAC were found respectively upstream of the initiator of M, N (data not shown), and sM gene, the sequence GTAAAC reported in the Korean strains [23] was not found upstream of the S1 gene of the Fujian PEDV samples.
