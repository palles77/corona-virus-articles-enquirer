            "text": "The regulation of the interferon type I (IFN-I) response has been shown to rely on posttranslational modification by ubiquitin (Ub) and Ub-like interferon-stimulated gene product 15 (ISG15) to stabilize, or activate, a variety of IFN-I signaling and downstream effector proteins. Unlike Ub, which is almost perfectly conserved among eukaryotes, ISG15 is highly divergent, even among mammals. Since zoonotic viruses rely on viral proteins to recognize, or cleave, ISG15 conjugates in order to evade, or suppress, innate immunity, the impact of ISG15 biodiversity on deISGylating proteases of the ovarian tumor family (vOTU) from nairoviruses was evaluated. The enzymatic activities of vOTUs originating from the Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus, Erve virus, and Nairobi sheep disease virus were tested against ISG15s from humans, mice, shrews, sheep, bats, and camels, which are mammalian species known to be infected by nairoviruses. This along with investigation of binding by isothermal titration calorimetry illustrated significant differences in the abilities of nairovirus deISGylases to accommodate certain species of ISG15. To investigate the molecular underpinnings of species preferences of these vOTUs, a structure was determined to 2.5 \u00c5 for a complex of Erve virus vOTU protease and a mouse ISG15 domain. This structure revealed the molecular basis of Erve virus vOTU's preference for ISG15 over Ub and the first structural insight into a nonhuman ISG15. This structure also revealed key interactions, or lack thereof, surrounding three amino acids that may drive a viral deISgylase to prefer an ISG15 from one species over that of another.

Unlike the case with ubiquitin, the amino acid sequences of ISG15s from various species are notably divergent. We illustrate that vOTUs have clear preferences for ISG15s from certain species. In addition, these observations are related to the molecular insights acquired via the first X-ray structure of the vOTU from the Erve nairovirus in complex with the first structurally resolved nonhuman ISG15.

            "text": "T he majority of emerging viruses in the human population have an origin in an animal reservoir host. Arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) are transmitted to vertebrates by blood-feeding arthropods and are a major cause of zoonotic diseases (1) . Arboviruses of medical importance include the positive-sense RNA viruses Dengue virus, West Nile virus, Chickungunya virus, and Zika virus and the negative-sense RNA viruses (NSVs) Rift Valley fever virus and Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) (2) . The recent identification of diverse NSVs suggests that even circulating vertebrate-specific viruses have originated from arthropod virus ancestors, supporting the notion that virus spillovers are the origin of currently circulating vertebrate-restricted viruses (3) . Multiple factors contribute to virus spillover events from the reservoir species to other organisms. The type I interferons (IFN-Is) represent one of the first and critical lines of defense against invading viruses and are likely a major obstacle not only for a zoonotic virus's ability to spill over to another organism but also for that organism to become a reservoir itself (1) . Not surprisingly, many viral proteins considered to be virulence factors are known to block the innate immune system, enabling viruses to replicate and cause disease.",

            "text": "The majority of nairoviruses are tick-borne pathogens, but they infect vertebrate hosts, resulting in a wide range of speciesspecific disease outcomes. CCHFV, Erve virus (ERVV), and Nairobi sheep disease virus (NSDV) are nairoviruses that have been implicated in human and other animal diseases. NSDV is a tickborne nairovirus that causes mild febrile illness in humans but severe disease with a mortality rate of up to 90% in infected animals, such as sheep and goats (18, 19) . In humans, CCHFV causes a severe disease that often progresses to fatal hemorrhagic syndrome associated with a mortality rate in humans ranging from 5% to 70% (20, 21) . ERVV and other virus from the Thiafora genogroup were isolated from the white-tooth shrew of the genus Crocidura. ERVV has been cited as one of the possible causative agents of thunderclap headaches (22) . In addition, the brains of mice that have been inoculated with ERVV have shown acute encephalitis and necrosis (23) . With no clear tick-borne vector, mice or shrews have been suggested as a reservoir and possible vector for ERVV (24) . In addition to causing overt disease in certain species, these nairoviruses have a unique ability to cause viremia in a multitude of other species (25) . For example, CCHFV has been experimentally inoculated in sheep, goats, cattle, horses, mice, and hamsters, with no signs of serious disease even with circulating antibodies being detected (25) . Serological evidence of ERVV infection in animals, including boar, deer, gulls, sheep, and rodents, has been found (26) .",

In previous studies, nairovirus vOTUs illustrated a capability of operating as deISGylases, deubiquitinases, or both (16) . Interestingly, ERVV uniquely employs deISGylases and shows little to no deubiquitinating activity, while CCHFV and NSDV utilize both deISGylases and deubiquitinases. Intriguingly, through indirect means, ERVV vOTU appears to show a greater affinity for mouse ISG15 (mISG15) than its CCHFV counterpart. This has spurred speculation that like NS1 of influenza B virus, the species origin of an ISG15 may also impact the ability of vOTU to cleave corresponding ISG15 conjugates. Regrettably, all of the current studies and structural data available only involve human ISG15 (hISG15). Additionally, there is no mechanism to explain why ERVV encodes a dedicated deISGylase and shows little to no activity as a deubiquitinase or why CCHFV does not prefer to cleave mISG15 (27) .",

As a result, an ISG15 protease activity assay was created in order to determine if vOTUs from different nairoviruses do indeed have a specificity for certain species' ISG15s and if the specificity correlates to the poorly conserved ISG15 sequences. In addition, the first crystal structure of the principally deISGylating vOTU from ERVV not only was revealed but also was captured in complex with the previous structurally uncharacterized C-terminal domain of mouse ISG15. This structure, when compared to the vOTU from CCHFV in complex with C-terminal human, has unlocked key residues that begin to answer the question of species specificity utilized by viral proteases. These insights could serve as the lynchpin in determining how these viruses are able to circumvent certain host innate immune systems that may contribute to virus replication, disease outcome, and persistence in particular host species.",

With no suitable assays to rapidly assess the impact interspecies sequence diversity of ISG15s has on viral deISGylase activity, an assay was developed leveraging the ability of these proteases to cleave immature forms of ISG15 (27) . Naturally, the immature form of ISG15 may not be the most naturally pertinent substrate for viral deISGylases; however, this setup provides a manner in which to rapidly screen for differences between ISG15s from numerous species without the need for extensive chemical synthesis or knowledge pertaining to the identity of ISG15-specific E1 ligases within the species being investigated (35) . For the ISG15 protease assay, homologues of hISG15 from species that have been proposed as hosts for deISGylase-containing viruses, or closely related to those species, were chosen. Specifically, species included human (pro-hISG15), sheep (pro-shISG15), northern tree shrew (pro-nsISG15), dromedary camel (pro-cISG15), and mouse (pro-mISG15) in relation to NSDV, ERVV, and CCHFV. Vesper bat (pro-bISG15) was also included, as multiple nairoviruses and even CCHFV appears to infect certain bat species (36) (37) (38) . In order to include an ISG15 with lower sequence identity than 60%, a distant homologue of human ISG15 from jackknife fish was also included (pro-fISG15). To focus the assay on detecting difference originating from the mature ISG15 component of the substrate, the C-terminal sequence from imma-ture hISG15 comprised the immature portion of all the pro-ISG15 substrates. Samples were collected at intermittent time points over the course of an hour, and cleavage was determined by SDS-PAGE.",

Surprisingly, a wide range of diversity of cleavage patterns was observed. CCHFV vOTU processes human and sheep pro-ISG15s rapidly, with all of these pro-ISG15s cleaved within a 10-min time frame. CCHFV vOTU also appears to have the ability to process pro-ISG15 from the northern tree shrew. Similar to CCHFV vOTU, ERVV vOTU also robustly cleaves the pro-forms of hISG15 and shISG15, albeit slightly slower than CCHFV vOTU. As suggested by a previous report, CCHFV vOTU cleaves pro-mISG15 markedly less than for its human counterpart, whereas ERVV vOTU appears process pro-mISG15 faster than CCHFV vOTU but still slower than pro-hISG15 (16) . Intriguingly, the substrate preference of vOTUs from ERVV and CCHFV differ for pro-ISG15 forms from northern tree shrew and vesper bat. There is an absence of activity of ERVV vOTU for ISG15 from the northern tree shrew. However, it does possess the ability to cleave the pro-bISG15. CCHFV vOTU has the reverse activity, preferring the pro-nsISG15 to the pro-bISG15. Unlike the vOTUs from CCHFV and ERVV, NSDV vOTU has a significantly broader range of activity. As expected, NSDV vOTU has the most activity toward pro-shISG15 but also has robust activity toward the pro-forms of hISG15 and mISG15. In addition, it also has moderate activity toward the pro-forms of cISG15, nsISG15, and bISG15.

Based on the divergence of activity observed by several of the viral deISGylases, isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) was employed to gain a better sense of scale related to the differences observed in the protease assay. In addition, this also was used to provide a thermodynamic perspective of the ability of ISG15s to bind to representative vOTU members. Specifically, CCHFV vOTU or ERVV vOTU were added to the cell and were titrated with mature forms of mISG15, hISG15, or shISG15 in the injector (Table 2; Fig. 3 ). The binding stoichiometry was 1:1 between the proteases and the ISG15s. Both endothermic and exothermic interactions were observed, suggesting multiple modes of binding between the ISG15s and the proteases. While CCHFV vOTU has been shown to bind Ub in an entropically driven manner (39), its interactions with ISG15s ranged from exothermic for shISG15 and endothermic for hISG15 and mISG15. The highest affinity was seen for hISG15 and shISG15, with K D s (equilibrium dissociation constants) of 3.51 \u03ee 1.30 and 1.80 \u03ee 0.24 M. The binding of mISG15 was more than 20-fold weaker, with a K D of 72.00 \u03ee 27.10 M. These results mirror the differences observed in the ISG15 protease activity assay, illustrating the magnitude of affinity difference between human and sheep ISG15s for CCHFV vOTU. Unexpectedly and unlike CCHFV vOTU, ERVV vOTU was exothermic for all of the ISG15s and had the lowest overall K D s, suggesting that hydrophobic interactions play a diminished role in ERVV vOTU binding of ISG15s. ERVV vOTU also possessed the lowest K D seen for the ISG15s tested, with its K D for hISG15 at 0.36 \u03ee 0.05 M. Its affinity for shISG15 was not much higher, with a K D of 1.05 \u03ee 0.05 M. As expected from the ISG15 protease activity assay, affinity for mISG15 was significantly lower, with a K D of 7.48 \u03ee 0.26. However, this was 10-fold tighter than CCHFV vOTU's affinity for mISG15. Overall, the affinities of ISG15 by ITC not only parallel the results of the ISG15 protease assay but also provide quantitative insight into the substantial differences in those affinities.",

Comparing ERVV vOTU with its CCHFV counterpart, one area of particular interest is immediately apparent, providing insight not only into the ERVV vOTU's substrate preferences, but also into vOTUs at large. Specifically, the substrate interface of ERVV vOTU is considerably more charged than that of CCHFV vOTU ( Fig. 4c and d) . Several residues were identified by homology to be responsible for this change: Arg21/Val18, Ser132/Ala129, and Asn134/Ile131 from ERVV/CCHFV, respectively (Fig. 4d) . The presence of this RSN motif within ERVV vOTU lines up with the thermodynamic observations that hydrophobic interactions play a more minor role in ERVV vOTU substrate binding than that of CCHFV vOTU (Table 2 ). In short, this pocket in CCHFV vOTU accommodates Leu8 of Ub, which corresponds to Glu87 of CmISG15 and in general is found to be either a polar or acidic residue within ISG15s ( Fig. 1 and 4e) . As a result, this ERVV vOTU surface appears to be at odds in accommodating Leu8 of Ub and likely is one of the major contributing factors in the lack of deubiquitinase activity found in ERVV vOTU.",

Activity for each mutant toward a 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin conjugate with human ISG15 (hISG15-AMC) and ubiquitin (Ub-AMC) was measured and compared against wild-type ERVV vOTU (Fig. 4f) . In contrast to S132A, which had a minimal effect, N134I and R21V each increased activity toward Ub-AMC 15-and 20-fold, respectively. For R21V, there was a corresponding reduction in activity toward hISG15-AMC by an order of magnitude. The triple mutant showed activity toward Ub-AMC similar to that of the R21V mutant, with a partial recovery of activity toward hISG15-AMC.

Broadly, the CmISG15 domain shares the same secondary structure composition of Ub and the C-terminal domain of hISG15 consisting of five \u2424-sheets and one \u2423-helix. Similar to Ub and the C-terminal domain of hISG15, 3 10 helices are present between the \u2423-helix and sheet 7 as well as between sheets 8 and 9 ( Fig. 1 and 5a ). An overlay of CmISG15 with the C-terminal domain of hISG15 illustrates that the tertiary fold is also conserved (Fig. 5b) . However, this is where the similarity largely ends. Although ISG15s originating from both humans and mice share a hydrophobic patch centered around a well-conserved tryptophan at positions 123 and 121, respectively, mISG15 has an additional hydrophobic path located around Phe97. Unlike mISG15, its human counterpart has a strong positively charged surface centered around Arg99. Intriguingly, this region within hISG15 has been shown to form domain-domain interactions with the N-terminal lobe, suggesting that mISG15's domain-domain interactions potentially differ from those observed in hISG15.",

While CmISG15 possesses analogous residues, its surface charge distribution forms a truncated form of this acidic ridge (Fig. 5c ). This truncation occurs by the presence of mISG15 His116 in place of Gln118 in hISG15. This substitution creates a substantially different hydrogen bond network in the region than that observed in hISG15. Specifically, in the reported CCHFV vOTU-hISG15 complexes, the oxygen on the side chain of Gln118 is well within hydrogen bonding distance of Glu120, suggesting that the alternative rota- mer configuration is more likely in those structures (42, 43) . However, in mISG15 the equivalent glutamate, Glu118, prefers to form a hydrogen bond with the amide of Gln119 (Fig. 5e) . Another similar indirect change occurs at position 148 in mISG15. This lysine occupied position is typically a methionine or other hydrophobic residue in other ISG15s. Although not immediately present on the surface, this internal difference between mISG15 and hISG15 allows for a hydrogen bond to form between mISG15 residues Lys148 and Glu87. This has the impact of reorienting the position of Glu87 compared to its human counterpart Asn89 away from the surface (Fig. 5f) .",

            "text": "These types of electrophilic interactions surround three areas of hydrophobic interactions. One of these is formed by mISG15 Pro128 inserting into a hydrophobic cavity of ERVV vOTU formed by Ile83 and Pro80. The second involves mISG15's Ile147 and elements of His149 packing with the Ile15 of ERVV vOTU. The third appears to serve as the basis for the sole major tertiary fold difference between CCHFV vOTU and ERVV vOTU (Fig.  4b) . Specifically, this tertiary structural difference is observed between the vOTUs of CCHFV and ERVV originating in the \u24233helix. From a primary structure perspective this suitably named selectivity helix is weakly conserved among nairovirus vOTUs (Fig. 1a) (16) . Within the structure of the Dugbe nairovirus vOTU, this helix was observed to be flexible and a key factor in that vOTU's inability to cleave ISG15 conjugates. Intriguingly, alternate orientations of \u24233 appear to be driven by an effort to provide a hydrophobic pocket for accommodation of the ISG15s' wellconserved Trp121 (Fig. 6c) . In the ERVV vOTU-CmISG15 complex, the alkyl side chain portion of the protease's Glu81 and backbone between this residue and Pro80 creates the floor of this pocket. The Glu81 also facilitates a water-mediated hydrogen bond network involving the indole nitrogen of CmISG15's Trp121. ERVV vOTU's Pro80 closes off one side of the pocket. This is a composition similar to that found in CCHFV vOTU. However, the manner in which each of these vOTUs forms the other wall of the pocket is interesting. Both utilize a leucine; however, the origin of the leucine within the helix differs greatly. This suggests that the tertiary structural divergence between the \u24233 of ERVV and CCHFV vOTUs is likely driven in a manner to ensure that the well-conserved Trp121 of ISG15s can be accommodated by this Pro-Glu-Leu-formed pocket.",

Intriguingly, the structure of ERVV vOTU reveals the basis for this protease's unique substrate specificity for ISG15s. Similar to vOTUs from CCHFV and Dugbe virus (DUGV), ERVV vOTU contains a number of hydrophobic residues, Ile15, Leu19, Ile121, and Phe155, that can create a hydrophobic valley at the bottom of its ubiquitin binding motif (Fig. 1) . These residues are relatively highly conserved among all known nairovirus vOTUs. Although ERVV vOTU includes this motif, suggesting that it too would be able to accommodate Ub's conical Ile44 centric hydrophobic patch, the hydrophobic valley's presence appears not to be sufficient to infer robust deubiquitinase activity ( Fig. 1) (16) . In light of the mutational evidence of ERVV vOTU's RSN motif, this feature is the principal obstacle to ERVV vOTU possessing deubiquitinase activity.",

At first glance, this is not very surprising given the mixed charged surface previously observed in hISG15 as well as the enthalpic nature of hISG15 and mISG15 observed via ITC. However, unlike the previously observed CCHFV vOTU-hISG15 structures where these interactions are almost entirely direct residue-to-residue interactions, the ERVV vOTU-CmISG15 structure is based almost solely on water-mediated hydrogen bond interactions (Fig. 6) . Taking into consideration that ERVV vOTU still possesses the ability to engage the well-conserved ISG15 Trp123 through the flexibility of its \u24233 selectivity helix, the presence of other conserved hydrophobic interactions, and ERVV vOTU's lower K D for hISG15, the binding strength of this network appears significantly robust.",

Comparison of the ERVV vOTU-CmISG15 with those of CCHFV vOTU-hISG15 appears to offer some insights into CCHFV vOTU's weaker affinity for mISG15 (Fig. 7a) . Centric to the interfaces of the CCHFV vOTU-hISG15 and ERVV vOTU-ISG15 complexes are three ISG15 positions. In hISG15 they encompass Asn89, Phe149, and Asn151. Strikingly, their counterparts in mISG15 are Glu87, Ile147, and His149, respectively. The impacts across the interface appear to be multifold. CCHFV vOTU uses Glu128 to form a hydrogen bond with hISG15 Asn89. However, driven by the substitution of a lysine for methionine residue at mISG15 position 148 coupled to the longer negatively charged side chain of glutamate at mISG15 position 87, the ability of a comparable CCHFV vOTU-mISG15 hydrogen bond to form is doubtful (Fig. 7a ). In addition, CCHFV vOTU relies on F149 to fit into a hydrophobic pocket created by the CCHFV vOTU residue side chains of Val12 and Val18 as well as the methyl group on Thr10. At the mISG15 position equivalent to Phe149, there too is a hydrophobic residue. However, instead of the bulkier and longer phenylalanine, mISG15 has Ile147, which appears to be less likely to create the hydrophobic interaction seen in the CCHFV vOTU-hISG15 structure. Apart from these, the change from an Asn151 in hISG15 to its counterpart His149 in mISG15 would appear to create a steric clash with CCHFV vOTU residue Val18 if CCHFV vOTU were to engage mISG15 in a manner similar to that of hISG15. As the divergence at these three positions between mISG15 and hISG15 includes the interplay of differences in hydrogen bond interactions, hydrophobicity, and steric volume within a close proximity to each other, the impact of these partic-ular sites on weaker mISG15 affinity for CCHFV vOTU likely could be synergistic.",

For instance, ISG15s from humans and sheep are the closest in terms of simi- larity at these three positions, with NFN and DFN, respectively (Fig. 1) . The vOTUs from ERVV, CCHFV, and NSDV, which show strong affinity for pro-hISG15, also appear to robustly cleave pro-shISG15 (Fig. 2) . In contrast, when the homology among these positions wanes, such as in the northern tree shrew ISG15, with a DYH motif in these positions, similarity in activities between ERVV, CCHFV, and NSDV vOTUs toward this ISG15 vary. Examining the sequence homology of the three positions and cor-responding biochemical activity of the jackknife fish ISG15 adds further support for this concept. The fISG15 possesses an LHV motif at hISG15-equivalent positions 89, 149, and 151 as well as no measurable cleavage of the pro-fISG15 by the three nairovirus vOTUs tested. Although the interfaces of ERVV vOTU-CmISG15 and CCHFV vOTU highlight a number of residues responsible for their interfaces, the biochemical results appear to suggest that for nairovirus vOTUs, divergence at hISG15 positions 89, 149, and 151 plays a significant role in determining compatibility.

This suggests that these proteases, along with other host proteins that engage the N-terminal ISG15 lobe in addition to the C-terminal lobe, could exhibit even greater variances in their abilities to cleave ISG15 conjugates originating from different species.",

Previously, deISGylase activity was largely tied to the ability of a viral protease to cleave the human variant of ISG15 attached to 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin. This has led to the classification of many viral proteases as solely deubiquitinases. With nairoviruses exhibiting wide differences in the ability to cleave certain species' ISG15s, we propose that some proteases that exhibit only weak, or no, affinity for hISG15 may possess deISGylase activity for other species' ISG15s. This would stress that testing a wide range of ISG15s from various species will be necessary to clarify if their deISGylase is specific to particular species.",

            "text": "Currently, there is a dearth of information surrounding the full extent of the biodiversity of ISG15 in animals and the propensity of nairoviruses to replicate in or cause disease among vertebrates. Most nairoviruses can establish a persistent infection in ticks (46, 47) . In contrast to the lifelong infection of tick host reservoirs, certain vertebrate hosts parasitized by ticks carrying CCHFV usually develop only transient viremia (46) . Since no ISG15 homologues appear to exist in ticks, likely deISGylase activity is conserved to evade the immune response of vertebrate hosts and could be critical for virus transmission from ticks to certain species and its maintenance in nature. Linking the efficacy of vOTUs to engage a certain species ISG15 for a nairovirus to replicate or cause disease in vertebrates is not fully straightforward, as many factors are required for a virus to successfully infect a host. For example, ERVV was isolated from a white-tooth shrew and its vOTU is not able to cleave ISG15 originating from the northern tree shrew. This could be the result of differences in ISG15 between the white-tooth shrew and its northern tree shrew counterpart, but this issue cannot be directly resolved, as there is no sequence available for the white-tooth shrew. Erve virus belongs to the recently identified Thiafora genogroup, which comprises only two nairoviruses (Thiafora virus and ERVV) (3). Interestingly, both viruses were isolated from shrews and no tick or insect vector could be identified (23, 26) . Therefore, shrew species could act as a reservoir for the Thiafora genogroup and deISGylase activity could be silent in the reservoir host. However, trends can be ob- Consurf surface rendering of conserved residues in the C-terminal lobe of human, sheep, northern tree shrew, mouse, camel, and bat ISG15s with human ISG15 as the reference structure. Sequences were derived from the same sources as those in Fig. 1b . Variable regions are shown in teal, conserved residues in burgundy. served for tick-borne nairovirus vOTUs that originate from viruses known to cause viremia or disease in a certain species and vigorously cleave the said species of ISG15. For example, ERVV vOTU robustly cleaves ISG15 from mice and humans, in which ERVV causes subdermal hemorrhaging and is implicated in thunderclap headaches, respectively (22) (23) (24) . NSDV appears to have the most robust activity for ISG15 originating from sheep, but it can also cleave ISG15 from humans, in whom it also causes disease (18) . This along with CCHFV vOTU's weaker affinity for mISG15 over hISG15 may suggest that there is a certain threshold of deIS-Gylase activity needed to impact disease outcome from a vOTU perspective. At a minimum, this trend would propose that there is some evolutionary pressure for tick-borne nairoviruses to possess vOTUs that are optimized to ISG15 of susceptible vertebrate species.",
