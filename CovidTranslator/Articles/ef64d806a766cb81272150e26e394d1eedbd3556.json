In infants and young children, infection with Bordetella pertussis or B parapertussis, the bacterial causes of classic pertussis syndrome, share overlapping features with viral LRTI, as at least 2 of these virus groups (RSV and adenovirus) are known causes of pertussis syndrome.",

Moreover, several of the common etiologic agents are not easily cultured using standard techniques. 18 Rapid immunoassay antigen detection tests are routinely available for the detection of RSV and influenza, but are known to have suboptimal sensitivity. 18 In contrast, detection of viral antigens in respiratory secretions by immunofluorescence has greater sensitivity but is labor intensive and is highly dependent on the experience and skill of the observer. 19 The recent emergence of PCR based technology has substantially increased the sensitivity of viral diagnostics. 18 Such assays allow for confirmatory diagnoses of agents that do not grow in standard tissue culture, and have led to the emerging recognition that simultaneous infection with multiple viral pathogens occurs regularly in children. 1, 2 We sought to determine whether virus-virus and/or virus-Bordetella co-infections are more frequent or more severe than previously recognized now that sensitive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays are available to detect a more complete set of pathogens.",

The clinical virology laboratory underwent an operational change beginning October 2008. Respiratory viral cultures from nasal wash samples were no longer performed routinely. Instead, nasopharyngeal flocked swabs (Copan Diagnostics, Corona, CA) were submitted and used for RVP testing. The RVP assay, as performed for routine patient care, allowed for detection of 11 of the abovelisted respiratory viruses (the tests for PIV4 and the 4 coronaviruses were not included in the Food and Drug Administration-approved version of the RVP assay), but these results were still available to us through this research protocol.",

            "text": "Inclusion criteria for enrollment dictated that all patients in our study had a febrile respiratory illness. Nine (4%) of our patients also had prominent gastrointestinal complaints, 6 with gastroenteritis and 3 with hepatitis. Those with gastroenteritis were diagnosed with rhinovirus/enterovirus infection (n = 1), adenovirus infection (n = 1), and coronavirus infection (1 with coronavirus OC43, 3 with coronavirus NL63). Of the patients with hepatitis, 1 had adenovirus infection, the other 2 had dual infections with coronavirus HKU1 and either RSV or rhinovirus/enterovirus. Although it is unclear whether the HKU1 coronavirus caused or contributed to the hepatitis in either case, it is of interest that several animal species of coronaviruses are primarily tropic to the gut and/or liver. [22] [23] [24] During our study period, the global H1N1 pandemic caused a substantial burden on our health care system resulting in more than 86 000 pediatric hospitalizations in the United States alone. We were therefore surprised to find only 3 patients with influenza infection in our study group. There are several possible explanations for this observation. A study from Melbourne, Australia found that the majority of influenza-like illnesses in children younger than 2 years during the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic was actually caused by RSV. 25 Infants infected with influenza virus often present with fever no source, lacking respiratory symptoms altogether. 26 Such patients would not have been eligible for inclusion in the present study.",

Patients hospitalized with RSV, rhinovirus/enterovirus, hMPV, coronavirus, or PIV infections are placed on contact precautions. In contrast, patients infected with adenovirus, influenza, or B pertussis require droplet precautions. Unless we carefully identify which patients are co-infected with multiple agents, we may unknowingly use improper isolation or cohorting procedures. Because the frequency of virus co-infection is so high, we encourage testing for alternative respiratory pathogens even if a viral rapid diagnosis has already been established. Our results do not support routine testing or screening for Bordetella infection in young children hospitalized with febrile respiratory illness. Clin Pediatr (Phila).
