The pathological and physiological processes and diagnostic methods of COVID-19 are still in the exploratory stage. Clinical monitoring and appropriate treatment strategies were essential to improve case fatality. CT scan played an important role in assessing the disease [2] . Other sensitive indicators able to reflect lung lesion changes and disease severity had to be explored. C-reactive protein (CRP) levels can be used in the early diagnosis of pneumonia [3] , and patients presenting with severe pneumonia had high CRP levels. We assessed the correlation between CRP levels, lung lesions, and disease severity to provide reference for clinical treatment.",

COVID-19-related case J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f fatality is also rapidly increasing. COVID-19 is a new threat for populations [6, 7, 8] , and treatment options need to be evaluated [9] . Early monitoring of key indicators was an important basis to guide treatment strategies, and early assessment of the severity of patients' condition was of great value [10] . The main pathological changes of COVID-19 are lung and immune system damage [4] . Serous, fibrin exudate and clear membrane form in the alveolar cavity and congestion and edema appear in the lung [11] . CT dynamic monitoring may be used to identify the characteristic imaging of lung changes: multiple small patch shadows and stromal changes are observed in the early stage and the lung exudate is obvious [12] , which then develops into multiple ground-glass shadows and infiltrating shadows in both lungs [13] . CT scan examination, as a quick and simple method to screen for pulmonary infection, can not only determine the presence of pulmonary infection but it can also provide a reference for determining the type of pathogen, with unique diagnostic advantages. According to Zhong Nanshan's latest research, the sensitivity of COVID-19 diagnosis with CT scan alone was 76.4%, and the application of CT scan in COVID-19 was evaluated as useful [14] . A 50% increase in lung X-ray findings within 24 to 48 hours was considered an early warning indicator of impending conversion to critical disease. The CT scan can sometimes predict the prognosis of patients [15] . CRP levels are correlated with the level of inflammation, and its concentration level is not affected by factors such as age, sex, and physical condition [16] . CRP levels can activate the complement and enhance phagocytosis, thus clearing the pathogenic microorganisms invading the body. CRP levels can be used for early diagnosis of Page 6 of 9 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f pneumonia [3] , and patients with severe pneumonia had high CRP levels. It is an important index for the diagnosis and assessment of severe pulmonary infectious diseases [17] . Matsumoto's study also showed the value of CRP levels in severe pneumonia [18] . This study showed that CRP levels and the diameter of the largest lung lesion increased as the disease progressed. CRP levels were positively correlated with lung lesion and disease severity. This suggests that in the early stage of COVID-19, CRP levels could reflect lung lesions and disease severity.",
