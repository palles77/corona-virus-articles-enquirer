In our opinion, prote in\u00b1 prote in inte ractions are responsible for food prote in attachme nt to BBM. This kind of interaction was obviously not in\u00afuence d by the diffe re nt composition and physicoche mical characte ristics of the investigate d cow's milk prote ins, gliadin pe ptide s, and ovalbumin. O n the contrary, common or at le ast adjoining binding site s e xist for the diffe re nt food prote ins, as indicate d by western blot \u00ae ndings. Inhibition by unre late d food prote ins supports this possibility. Control e xpe riments could exclude artifacts cause d by biotinylation of food prote ins. V e sicle de struction leading to re le ase of brush borde r cytoske leton prote ins could possibly in\u00afuence binding characte ristics re corde d in We ste rn blots. For example , actin as a major compone nt of adult brush borde r might have caused the positive signals in the are a of 45 kDa. There fore furthe r e xpe rime nts have to be conducte d to ide ntify structure s in membrane binding and their orientation towards the intestinal lume n in vivo.",

It has to be ke pt in mind that any experimental de sign using isolate d BBM vesicle s in vitro lacks important parts of the mucosal barrie r (41) . Diffe rences in prote in re sistance to inte stinal hydrolysis (gliadin, BLG in contrast to CAS) (42) in\u00afue nce the ir acce ss to small intestinal e pithe lial cells in vivo. For e valuation of conseque nces of change s in food prote in binding capacity cause d by alte rations in BBM composition, it should be inve stigate d whe the r proce sse s of uptake and intrace llular processing or signal transduction occur. It is well-known that endocytosis is stimulate d by prior membrane adsorption (43, 44) . Moreover, diffe rence s of intrace llular proce ssing after uptake of membranebound prote ins or pinocytosis of\u00afuid-phase molecule s have bee n re porte d for small intestinal e pithelial cells (4, 5, 45) .
