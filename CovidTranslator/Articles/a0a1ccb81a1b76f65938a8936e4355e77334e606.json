Remarkably, South Korea lost control and regained it with no lockdown and simply strong application of the above principles, enhanced by using novel digital technologies for contact tracing. 4 The consequences of noncontainment will be measured in lives lost and socioeconomic disruption, which will be far worse than the cost of rigorously implemented containment combined with mitigation efforts. \"Containment of COVID-19 is feasible and must remain the top priority for all countries\", WHO's Director-General said at a media briefing on COVID-19 on March 2, 2020. 5 WHO still does not waver from this message. China implemented extraordinary public health measures at great socioeconomic cost, moving swiftly and decisively to ensure early identification of cases, prompt laboratory testing, facility-based isolation of all cases, contact tracing, and quarantine. 2 In the community, mobility was at a near standstill, with social distancing implemented at a grand scale. China's massive transmission rates called for extreme measures, and the measures were successful.",

A differentiated risk-based containment strategy is needed based on the different stages of the outbreak, with different measures during the different phases of the response. Countries with no or few identified cases and only limited local transmission need to invest in aggressive case detection by testing for COVID-19 in all atypical pneumonias and all cases of acute respiratory infection. A wide net should be cast on contact tracing with legally enforced implementation. Singapore managed to contain COVID-19 with such measures but without lockdown or major social disruption by maximising all efforts to interrupt new transmission chains and keeping clusters under control. 3 Countries with widespread community transmission need to follow the China approach, with wide-reaching (and possibly unpopular) mobility restrictions, limited social interaction, and cancelled gatherings. People should be strongly encouraged to stay home and work from home when possible. In addition, all countries need to continue liberal testing, proactive case detection, prompt isolation, rigorous contact tracing, and enforcement of quarantine of all contacts, irrespective of which phase of the outbreak they are in.",

This includes fully engaging the public on the seriousness of, and their role in, the response. Policy makers need to ensure that trained epidemiology teams are in place, along with quarantine facilities, revised hospital workflows, and laboratory processes (who to test, how, and in which laboratory). Surveillance needs to be expanded to test all patients with atypical pneumonias for COVID-19, and COVID-19 testing needs to be added to existing surveillance systems for influenza-like illness and severe acute respiratory infections. The demand on facilities, the number of test kits, personal protective equipment, and medication stockpiles should be forecast to enable scaleup. Health systems vary whereby people in under-resourced countries will be particularly at risk. Vulnerable countries will therefore need extraordinarily intensified support from other countries. WHO freely provides online resources that include training courses, downloadable standardised case report forms, guidance on clinical management and infection control, protection of health-care workers, ",
