            "text": "The length of sequence obtained for each TGEV isolate ranged from 393 to 414 nucleotides, depending on the presence of insertions and or deletions. The new data were aligned with the published sequences of the prototype Purdue isolate (nucleotides 250\u00b1648) and that of TGEVs 70\u00b1772, Toy56, Neb72, Miller [16] and TF1 [2] , as shown in Fig. 1 . Our own sequence of Purdue, from a virus obtained via The Czech Republic (V91) differed at one nucleotide from the published sequence. Similarly, a previous sequence of 70\u00b1772 [1] differed at a single nucleotide compared to our own data. Four isolates had either additional or deleted nucleotides, none of which altered the reading frame of the S gene. The English isolate 83\u00b13289 had a deletion of six nucleotides between position 286 and 291, overlapping antigenic site B [9] . The two Dutch isolates Erica and Slagharen, shared the same insertion of 15 nucleotides between positions 496 and 497. The two nucleotides preceding the insertion and the \u00aerst twelve nucleotides of the insertion itself, are identical in sequence to a region within the published polymerase Ia gene of the Purdue isolate of TGEV (nucleotides 1 054\u00b11 065 [5] ). The last three nucleotides of the insert are the same as those at positions 494\u00b1496 which immediately precede the insertion. The Belgian isolate V63 had the most complex rearrangement, in which \u00aeve nucleotides were inserted, also after position 496, followed by a deletion of eleven nucleotides at position 497\u00b1507. The \u00aeve nucleotides inserted into V63 were the same as the \u00aerst \u00aeve nucleotides inserted into the Dutch isolates Slagharen and Erica. The 5 H end of the S protein of TGEV is that which differs greatest from canine and feline coronaviruses which otherwise have sequences very similar to those of TGEV. PRCV and other coronaviruses have been found to contain large deletions in this part of the S gene [14, 15] , whilst it has been reported that the S protein of the Purdue and Nebraska 72 isolates from America were two amino acids shorter than in other TGE viruses [16] . Our new data provide further evidence for the plasticity of this region of the S gene. The three isolates, Erica, Slagharen and V63 all share similar and has also been omitted from the alignment. The two boxed areas indicate areas of the gene which have been shown to encode parts of antigenic site B of the S protein [9] rearrangements to one another and are geographically and temporally linked, suggesting that the changes arose in vivo in a common precursor. In the case of the two isolates, Erica and Slagharen, template switching between the polymerase and S gene of the TGEV genome could account for the insertion, since there is a region of secondary structure predicted in front of the insertion site, and the same three nucleotides are present before the insertion and at its end. The greatest sequence dissimilarity was between isolates 96\u00b11933 and Slagharen with 35 nucleotide sequence differences (91% identity), discounting the 15 nucleotide insertion in Slagharen. All of the isolates were more closely related to one another than to the related coronaviruses from dogs and cats. If insertions and deletions are excluded, approximately 60% of nucleotide positions where sequence differences are observed give rise to amino acid changes. Alignment of the deduced amino acid sequences showed greatest variability around amino acid positions 97 and 144, previously shown to be part of mAb binding site B [9] . Interestingly, mAb 1D.B12, previously shown to bind to site B, showed a different reactivity with two isolates (64\u00b1216 and 84\u00b13 658) that had no sequence differences, suggesting that some other region may in\u00afuence this antigenic site. Figure 2 shows the similarity of the isolates to one another deduced by comparison of the nucleotide sequences. A number of clusters of similar The phylogenetic tree shown in Fig. 2 reveals a number of clusters of similar viruses, but in several cases there is no obvious correlation between clustering and the date or place of isolation. Some viruses are identical or nearly identical over the region examined despite being apparently isolated many years apart, and even from different continents. For instance the large group of viruses closely related to the prototype Purdue isolate. Other examples were IA-139 and Miller viruses and the 64\u00b1216, 70\u00b1772 and 84\u00b13 658 viruses isolated in US and England respectively, in each case over a time period of approximately 20 years. To be certain that these identities did not arise from crosscontamination during RT-PCR procedures, we repeated the sequencing on all viruses appearing genetically identical, using freshly obtained amplicons derived from an earlier passage of the virus. Where possible, sequencing was repeated after direct ampli\u00aecation from virus stocks as received from abroad. Further support that the similarities identi\u00aeed were genuine, is provided by the mAb typing, which generally suggested the same virus groupings, and which was performed on the same virus stocks used for the RT-PCR. All of the above-mentioned Purdue-like group of viruses reacted identically with the mAbs, whilst the similarity of the three English viruses, 64\u00b1261, 70\u00b1772 and 84\u00b13 658 was demonstrated by their unique reactivity with the mAb 7A6.",

It is tempting to speculate that a more rapid rate of evolution could somehow be caused by the spread of PRCV. However, since the sequenced region is deleted from PRCV, immunological cross-reactivity between PRCV and TGEV seems an unlikely cause. Since few outbreaks of TGE have been con\u00aermed in Britain in recent years, it was uncertain where the 96\u00b11 933 isolate responsible for a recent episode of TGE [12] had come from. Interestingly, there is a unique nucleotide at position 426, present in all of the English isolates as well as in the sequence of TF1 from Taiwan, an isolate that appears phylogenetically closest to English isolate 83\u00b13 289. This also suggests a common origin, but in the absence of a representative set of sequence data from viruses circulating elsewhere outside Britain, no \u00aerm conclusions on the immediate origin of any of these viruses is possible. As well as obtaining S gene sequence data from more viruses, there is a need to compare other parts of the TGEV genome using phylogenetic analysis, in order to check for evidence of recombination between strains, a known feature of coronaviruses [13] .",

The country of origin and year of isolation (where known) is given in parenthesis. BE Belgium, BU Bulgaria; JP Japan; NL Netherlands; TA Taiwan; UK United Kingdom; US United States isolates are evident. The largest cluster includes isolates similar or identical to the prototype Purdue virus. These viruses were isolated in Japan in 1962 (V66), in Czechoslovakia in 1968 (V126), in Bulgaria (V347), and in USA in the 1990's (IA-136 and KS-204). The next closest group, included two viruses with a distinctive respiratory tropism, one isolated in Japan in 1956 (Toy56), the other isolated in Russia in the 1980's (V355). Three English viruses (64\u00b1216, 70\u00b1772, 84\u00b13 658) isolated between 1964 and 1984 had identical sequences and were similar (3 nucleotide differences) to the published sequence of the 1965 Miller isolate from the USA. Another US isolate from the 1990s (IA-139) was identical to Miller. The three isolates from The Netherlands and Belgium were a clearly distinct lineage. The remaining three viruses from England were isolated between 1983 and 1996 and show an increasing divergence from the other TGEVs over time. The sequence obtained for the 96\u00b11 933 virus was identical when obtained from ampli\u00aeed cell culture material (passage 4) or directly from faeces.",
