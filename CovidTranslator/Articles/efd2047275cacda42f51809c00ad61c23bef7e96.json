            "text": "a b s t r a c t GSK983, a novel tetrahydrocarbazole, inhibits the replication of a variety of unrelated viruses in vitro with EC 50 values of 5-20 nM. Both replication of the adenovirus Ad-5 and the polyoma virus SV-40, and episomal maintenance of human papillomaviruses (HPV) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) are susceptible to GSK983. The compound does not inhibit all viruses; herpes simplex virus (HSV-1), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and lytic replication of EBV were not susceptible at concentrations below 1 M. GSK983 does inhibit the growth of cell lines immortalized by HTLV-1, EBV, HPV, SV40 and Ad-5, with EC 50 values in the range of 10-40 nM. Depending on the cell line, the compound induces either apoptosis or cytostasis at concentrations over 20 nM. GSK983 also inhibits cell lines immortalized by non-viral mechanisms, but has little effect on primary cells. The CC 50 values for keratinocytes, fibroblasts, lymphocytes, endothelial, and bone marrow progenitor cells are all above 10 M. The pattern of inhibition, which includes diverse viruses as well as growth of immortalized cells of varied origins, suggests the target is a host cell protein, rather than a viral protein. Preliminary mechanism studies indicate that GSK983 acts by inducing a subset of interferon-stimulated genes.",

Success stories include acyclovir and its prodrug for herpes simplex virus (HSV), two neuraminidase inhibitors for influenza, five antiviral drugs for hepatitis B (HBV), and almost two-dozen human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) drugs. Despite these significant advances, however, many common viral infections still do not have safe and effective treatments. For example, there are no antiviral drugs for either the Dengue virus, which causes 50-100 million cases of Dengue fever a year (Morens and Fauci, 2008) , or the oncogenic human papillomaviruses, which cause cervical cancer and have a prevalence of 26.8% in U.S. women (Dunne et al., 2007) .",

The drawback to this approach is that, unless viruses are closely related, separate drug discovery and development efforts are required for each virus. In some cases, multiple inhibitors are needed in combination to combat the rapid development of resistance. This is clearly the case with HIV, and it is expected to be the case with hepatitis C (HCV) (Grunberger et al., 2008) . Inhibiting pathogen targets still has great value and will clearly continue to yield beneficial new drugs, but use of host targets in antiviral therapy is growing. For example, one of the newest classes of HIV inhibitors, the CCR5 antagonists, targets the cell surface receptors and blocks entry of the virus (Schlect et al., 2008) .",

This is particularly attractive for emerging infections, such as the 2002-2003 SARS coronavirus outbreak. In such cases, a broad-spectrum agent could allow for effective treatment without the lead time necessary to develop a virus-specific therapy. A broad-spectrum inhibitor would also be welcome in the treatment of niche indications, such as progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) caused by uncontrolled JC virus infection in the central nervous system of immune-compromised patients. In such cases, medical need is acute, but the patient population is not large enough to provide an economic incentive for development of a virus-specific drug.",

The median effect concentration (K) was 7.5 nM and the maximum inhibition (I max ) was 88%. In this case interpretation of the data is complicated by the fact that growth of the host Vero cells is also inhibited with a similar median effect concentration (K) of 12 nM. The maximum inhibition of cell growth (I max ), however, was only 37%, which is significantly lower than that for viral replication. The difference in I max val- ues between the antiviral and growth effects suggests that GSK983 has an antiviral effect distinct from the effect on cell growth. To address this issue, we calculated the ratio of SV40 DNA to MTS activity of the infected Vero cells. This ratio is proportional to viral DNA per cell and as seen in Fig. 3 , falls with increasing GSK983 concentration. The median effect concentration (K) for reduction of the ratio is 12 \u00b1 2 nM, and the maximum inhibition (I max ) is 79 \u00b1 2%. This result suggests that GSK983 does reduce SV40 replication, but because of the different forms of the dose-response curves for inhibition of the viral yield and inhibition of growth of the host Vero cells we are unable to calculate a selectivity index. There was no system available to study SV40 infection of primary cells, limiting our ability to calculate a true selectivity index.",

The median effect concentration determined using the hybrid capture assay is 5 nM, the maximum inhibition (I max ) of HPV levels by GSK983 is greater than 95% of the control, and the I max value is reached at concentrations below 100 nM ( Fig. 5 and Table 3 ). As in the case of the Vero cells above, however, GSK983 has effects on the growth of the W12 cells. The K values for the compound's effects on viral DNA and growth are similar, but there is a difference in the I max values (Table 3 ). In the case of W12 growth inhibition, I max does not approach 100%, but rather is asymptotic at 60% of control. When the ratio of HPV DNA to MTS activity is calculated, the resulting dose-response curve is not significantly different from that for inhibition of total HPV DNA ( Fig. 5 and Table 3 ). Since this ratio is proportional to viral DNA copy number per cell, it suggests GSK983 reduces HPV viral copy number independent of the effect on the W12 cells' functioning. The reduction in copy number was confirmed by measurement of HPV and cellular actin DNA by quantitative PCR (Table 3) . Similar values of K were observed, and the I max values were only slightly lower. Calculation of gene numbers from these data showed that at 100 nM GSK983, the copy number, expressed as HPV genomes per actin gene, was reduced from 460 to 150.",

The values of K for inhibition by GSK983 of the lines with integrated Ad-5 (HEK293), SV40 (Wi38 VA13) and EBV (Namalwa) were not significantly different from those for inhibition of the corresponding productive or episomal infections. The four keratinocyte lines with integrated HPV, however, were less susceptible than the episomally infected lines by about 2-fold. In contrast to the observed maximum inhibition of viral DNA of 86-99% in the productive or episomal infections, I max values in all of the integrated lines were asymptotic at significantly less than 100%. The I max values varied from 28% (Wi38 VA13) to 66% (Namalwa). Experimental design for all cell types was as described in the legend for Fig. 6 .

Vero cells are African Green monkey kidney cells immortalized by an unknown event, which is probably not a viral infection. This led us to study the effects of GSK983 on the growth of five other cell lines of human origin, immortalized by non-viral transformation events (Table 5 ).

In each case, the CC 50 for inhibition of primary cell growth was greater than 10 M. Table 6 shows additional data on HFF cells and measurements of the effects of GSK983 on growth of other types of primary cells. These include PBMCs, resting B and T cells, WI38 fibroblasts, HUVEC endothelial cells, and two types of bone marrow progenitors. None of the primary cell types tested was significantly inhibited by GSK983 at concentrations below 1 M, and 50% inhibition was seen in the range of 10-100 M. Unlike the viral assays, in which GSK983 was clearly more potent than its enantiomer GSK984, in the primary cells, similar CC 50 values were observed for both enantiomers (data not shown). This suggests that the inhibition of primary cells by GSK983 is likely separate from the mechanism responsible for the antiviral data presented above. Erythroid and granulocyte/macrophage toxicity assays were run by Cambrex Bio Science Walkersville, Inc. using the methods described by Eaves (1995) . The other cell types were grown using the media indicated in Supplementary Materials. Cells were plated in 96-well plates with medium containing serial dilutions of GSK983 with a concentration range of 3 nM to 100 M. Measurement of cell growth was determined by CTG (HFF, B and CD4 T cells) or MTS (HFF, PBMC, WI38, HUVEC) after 72 h of incubation at 37 \u2022 C. CC50 values were calculated by fitting data to Eq.

We measured the inhibition over the course of 72 h to determine the reason for these two distinct patterns. During this time period, the cell lines double 2-3 times. To see >95% inhibition in this experiment, cell death must occur. If the maximum inhibition is significantly below 100% the inhibition is most likely due to cytostasis. Fig. 7 shows measurements of growth of W12, U937 and IM9 cells for a period of 3 days after addition of a range of concentrations of GSK983. Growth of all three-cell lines was exponential throughout this time with doubling times of 33 \u00b1 0.3, 20 \u00b1 0.5 and 17 \u00b1 0.5 h for W12, U937 and IM9, respectively. For W12 and U937 in the presence of GSK983, a concentration-dependent decrease in the rate of growth was seen which reached zero between 20 and 50 nM and remained at zero at higher concentrations. These results indicate induction of cytostasis by GSK983, consistent with the asymptotic dose-response curves for these cells. Similar studies with Vero cells (data not shown) also indicated cytostasis, consistent with the dose response. In contrast, the growth rate of the IM9 cells becomes negative at higher concentrations of GSK983. This indicates cell death, consistent with the observed dose response with I max approaching 100%.",

Of the 22 genes induced in W12 cells, seven (IFIT1 (ISG56), IL6, ISG15, OAS1, OAS2, OASL and TNFSF10 (TRAIL)) are known to be interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs).

Thus of any 22 genes of the set selected at random, only one would be expected to be an ISG. In the set of genes induced by GSK983 in W12 cells, ISGs are 7-fold over-represented, and calculations of Chisquare showed that the probability that this over-representation was due to chance is 0.001. Two chemokines, IL8 and CCL5, occur in the 22 genes induced in W12 cells. This number is also significantly greater than expected by chance.

All of these lines have two things in common. First, their growth is dependent on the virus. Second, their growth is inhibited at similar median effect concentrations (K), and these K values for growth are also similar to the median effect concentrations for inhibition of viral yield. As we consider the mechanism, we can envision three possible explanations for GSK983's role in the observed activity. First, GSK983 could inhibit the viral replication, and that inhibition could lead to cytostasis, since growth of the cell line is dependent on the virus. If this is the case, the observed inhibition should be dependent on copy number, and it is not. The W12 cell line has approximately 1000 episomal copies of HPV (Stanley et al., 1989) , the HKC/HPV16 line has 60-80 episomal copies (Lee et al., 2004) , and the integrated line has even fewer copies, but all of these lines have similar growth rates (data not shown) and K values for inhibition (Table 3) . Furthermore, we observed similar effects on growth in both episomal lines, where the copy number can decrease, and the integrated lines, where copy number is fixed (Tables 3 and 4 ). The second possible explanation is that reduction of viral copy number is a simple consequence of the induction of cytostasis by GSK983. This is also unlikely, since cytostasis is not induced in uninfected keratinocytes, but clearly requires the presence of the virus (Table 3) . Consequently, the third explanation seems to be the most likely: reduction of viral copy number and cell growth rate are parallel consequences of the effects of GSK983 on a single target.",

Comparing the potent inhibition of the viral-immortalized cell lines with the lack of effect on related primary cells gives a selectivity index of approximately 1000. As above, this is an imperfect comparison, since the genetic lineages of the primary and immortalized cells are not identical, but it is very suggestive of a selective effect and clearly shows that GSK983 does not cause apoptosis in the primary cells, even when they are activated. We also note that the number of cell line passages since the viral immortalization event does not influence the outcome of the assay. The freshly immortalized 5/2/1 B-LCLs behave in the same fashion as the much older IM9 cell line.

All of the susceptible cell lines, whether immortalized by viral infection, integration of viral genes or by other non-viral means, have abnormal cellular DNA replication and loss of normal cell cycle control. By definition, the primary cell types do not have these features. Furthermore, we showed that two viruses that actively turn on cellular DNA replication during their productive replication are susceptible to GSK983. Ad-5, SV40 and HPV share this property (Knipe and Howley, 2007) . Ad-5 and SV40 were inhibited by GSK983 (Figs. 2 and 3 ), but we were unable to study productive replication of HPV due to lack of a suitable experimental system. The viruses we studied that are not susceptible to GSK983 either do not actively promote cellular DNA replication, as in the case of HIV, or they actively block it, as in the case of lytic replication of the herpesviruses EBV (Kudoh et al., 2006) and HSV (Song et al., 2000) .
