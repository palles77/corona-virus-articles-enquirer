            "text": "Studying gene-environment interactions requires that the amount and quality of the lifestyle data is comparable to what is available for the corresponding genomic data. Sweden has several crucial prerequisites for comprehensive longitudinal biomedical research, such as the personal identity number, the universally available national health care system, continuously updated population and health registries and a scientifically motivated population. LifeGene builds on these strengths to bridge the gap between basic research and clinical applications with particular attention to populations, through a unique design in a research-friendly setting. LifeGene is designed both as a prospective cohort study and an infrastructure with repeated contacts of study participants",

A comprehensive questionnaire addressing cutting-edge research questions will be administered through the web with short follow-ups annually. Biosamples and physical measurements will also be collected at baseline, and readministered every 5 years thereafter. Event-based sampling will be a key feature of LifeGene. The householdbased design will give the opportunity to involve young couples prior to and during pregnancy, allowing for the first study of children born into cohort with complete pre-and perinatal data from both the mother and father. Questions and sampling schemes will be tailored to the participants' age and life events. The target of LifeGene is to enrol 500,000 Swedes and follow them longitudinally for at least 20 years. In only a few years the methods used to study genetics of complex traits have evolved almost beyond recognition. The result has been unprecedented advances in our understanding of the genetic architecture of almost all common complex diseases. The main driving force behind these discoveries has been the rapid development and application of genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Although there has been remarkable recent progress in defining the genetic basis of common complex diseases, a new generation of epidemiological studies that undertake standardised, fine-scale phenotyping and exposure assessments of many thousands of individuals measured repeatedly during many years of follow-up will be required to maintain this trajectory. New approaches for storing, processing, and characterising the tissue samples collected in these individuals will be necessary, as will the application of novel, comprehensive, and multi-factorial statistical methods to analyse data harvested from these biosamples. Worldwide, there are several large-scale genetic epidemiological studies such as the UK Biobank [1] , deCODE in Iceland [2] , Millennium in Japan [3] , the Kadoorie study of Chronic Diseases in China [4] and CONOR/HUNT in Norway [5] . These studies focus on chronic diseases diagnosed later in life, and some also collect detailed data on lifestyle factors. There are, however, very few large prospective studies focusing on disorders that emerge early in life, in some instances during infancy or early adolescence. LifeLines in Holland [6] , a three-generation population-based study with a household recruitment approach differs from most other ongoing cohorts because data on diseases with onset early in life is collected. The Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort study (MoBa) [7] , ALSPAC (the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children) [8] and the US National Child Study [9] have followed pregnant mothers from early pregnancy and their offspring throughout childhood, whilst other prospective birth cohort studies were brought together under the Global Asthma and Allergen European Network (Ga2len) [10] . The Southampton Women's Survey [11] is of particular interest because it collected parental exposure data before the pregnancy and thus could assess associations to perinatal and infant outcomes. Pre-pregnancy exposure data are also likely to be valuable in long-term studies of chronic disease later in life, although to date no such studies have been undertaken.",

As a complement to the registerbased epidemiologic tradition, Sweden is also at the forefront of developing and implementing information technology, cutting edge biotechnology and biobanking. In order to adequately address gene-environment interactions, acquisition of phenotype and exposure information repeatedly, biosamples and physiological assessment are important. A prospective study combining information on exposures as early as pre-conception and in early life throughout young and mid-adulthood, with the possibility to study a variety of diseases with onset relatively early in life and co-morbidities later in life will open up new research opportunities.",

Biosamples are collected and stored in a manner that facilitates the full range of 'omics', and physical measurements are also sampled repeatedly at 5 year intervals.

In preparation for the LifeGene pilot, a protocol for webbased questionnaires and in-person testing (biosamples and physical examinations) was developed. Names and addresses of potential index participants will be randomly sampled from the general population, and an invitation letter with personal log-in information sent out. After agreement and consent on the LifeGene webpage, they will be able to respond to the LifeGene survey, book an appointment at the test centre for in-person testing and invite household members to participate. After the first invitation letter, up to three reminders will be sent out. Questions that potential participants may have can be directed to the toll-free number of the LifeGene Support Centre, or via the internet.",

The analysis of samples for research takes place after retrieval from storage. Through stringently standardized sampling protocols and modern biobanking, LifeGene will provide an opportunity to evaluate the full 'omics'-set including proteomics, metabolomics, genomics and epigenomics.
