            "text": "Genome sequence analysis of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) variants from patient specimens has revealed the evolutionary dynamics and mechanisms of pathogenesis of the virus. However, most studies have analyzed the consensus sequences of MERS-CoVs, precluding an investigation of intrapatient heterogeneity. Here, we analyzed non-consensus sequences to characterize intrapatient heterogeneity in cases associated with the 2015 outbreak of MERS in South Korea. Deepsequencing analysis of MERS-CoV genomes performed on specimens from eight patients revealed significant intrapatient variation; therefore, sequence heterogeneity was further analyzed using targeted deep sequencing. A total of 35 specimens from 24 patients (including a super-spreader) were sequenced to detect and analyze variants displaying intrapatient heterogeneity. Based on the analysis of non-consensus sequences, we demonstrated the intrapatient heterogeneity of MERS-CoVs, with the highest level in the super-spreader specimen. The heterogeneity could be transmitted in a close association with variation in the consensus sequences, suggesting the occurrence of multiple MERS-CoV infections. Analysis of intrapatient heterogeneity revealed a relationship between D510G and I529T mutations in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the viral spike glycoprotein. These two mutations have been reported to reduce the affinity of the RBD for human CD26. Notably, although the frequency of both D510G and I529T varied greatly among specimens, the combined frequency of the single mutants was consistently high (87.7% \u00b1 1.9% on average). Concurrently, the frequency of occurrence of the wild type at the two positions was only 6.5% \u00b1 1.7% on average, supporting the hypothesis that selection pressure exerted by the host immune response played a critical role in shaping genetic variants and their interaction in human MERS-CoVs during the outbreak.",

As of March 1, 2016, 1638 laboratoryconfirmed cases (587 deaths; 36% case fatality rate [CFR] ) have been reported to the World Health Organization. A South Korean outbreak of MERS began in May 2015, and its transmission continued until early July, resulting in 186 laboratory-confirmed cases with 38 deaths (20.4% CFR). In contrast to previous studies, which have suggested limited person-to-person transmissibility of MERS-CoV (Breban et al. 2013; Cotten et al. 2013b ), many secondary and tertiary cases of transmission occurred during the South Korean outbreak. Importantly, more than half of the tertiary cases were transmitted from one particular super-spreader, called Patient 14 in this study. This unusual transmission pattern raised questions related to transmissibility as well as the potential adaptations of MERS-CoV to the human host. To address these questions, several researchers have investigated MERS-CoV sequences. However, all previous studies on the South Korean outbreak have focused only on the consensus sequences of MERS-CoVs Kim et al. 2016a,b; Park et al. 2016; Seong et al. 2016) .",

Multiple rounds of replication of a given viral genome can generate a cloud of diverse variants or a heterogeneous viral population. Previous reports on other RNA viruses have suggested that quasispecies diversity, rather than the selection of individual variants, correlates with pathogenicity and enables adaptation to new environments (Vignuzzi et al. 2006; Lauring and Andino 2010) . The importance of characterizing viral populations as swarms with similar variants has led several groups to use next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies on clinical samples to explore the complexity of the spectrum of mutant viruses, including HIV-1 and hepatitis B virus (Bushman et al. 2008; Eriksson et al. 2008; Margeridon-Thermet et al. 2009 ). Although the description of MERS-CoV quasispecies is far from completion, previous studies that recovered whole MERS-CoV genome sequences from dromedary camels revealed the existence of intrahost single-nucleotide variants (Briese et al. 2014; Borucki et al. 2016) .",

Because deep sequencing not only generates a consensus sequence but also identifies non-consensus nucleotides at each position, Cotton et al. (2013a) analyzed nucleotide variants present at >1% frequency to determine the variants important for intrahost evolution. In the previous study, the nucleotide variants present at a frequency greater than the sequencing error rate (i.e., 1%) were considered to be true variants, although this estimate may be conservative for most applications. However, errors introduced during reverse transcription and PCR amplification can significantly distort estimates of allele frequencies, especially if a limited amount of RNA is used as an input. Thus, in this study, we evaluated the reproducibility of allele frequencies of non-consensus nucleotides. For this purpose, duplicate libraries generated by independent complementary DNA (cDNA) synthesis using the same RNA samples were sequenced and compared. Allele frequencies of duplicate samples from Patients 80 and 162 were significantly correlated, implying that the majority of mixed bases were a reflection of intrapatient heterogeneity rather than a result of sequencing errors (Fig. 1A ,B).",

Positions where a nucleotide variant was present at a frequency of \u226530% in any of the eight isolates were selected for further investigation using additional samples. Targeted deep sequencing was performed on an additional 27 samples targeting 3003-bp regions that included the variable sites. Eleven libraries from independent cDNA syntheses of five samples, including four libraries in duplicate and one in triplicate, were constructed to evaluate the technical noise in measuring allele frequency. Only variants with frequencies significantly greater than those from technical noise were considered true variants. Technical noise is described in Methods and was based on a 5% significance level after performing Bonferroni adjustment. A total of 16 positions displaying intrapatient heterogeneity were identified through statistical testing. The results from seven specimens were validated using Sanger sequencing. We tested nine sites and confirmed concordant mixed bases at seven positions-namely, positions 6884, 7317, 11257, 21726, 22356, 22984, and 23041 (Fig. 1C ), but found discrepancies at positions 7322 and 19075. Although we were not able to validate all variants by Sanger sequencing owing to a limited sample volume, the results from the test set showed a 78% validation rate. In addition, the frequencies of the two variants at positions 22984 and 23041 (i.e., G at position 22984 and T at 23041; A at 22984 and C at 23041) were highly correlated in the specimens (Supplemental Fig. S3 ), suggesting a tight linkage between these variants instead of random sequencing errors. Fourteen positions exhibiting mixed bases are presented in Figure 2 . These include all seven nucleotide variants identified in the full-genome sequences of the eight MERS-CoV isolates, indicating that intrapatient MERS-CoV heterogeneity was closely associated with isolate-specific variants in the consensus sequences.

Based on the genetic linkage, a functional relationship was expected between the variants at these two positions.

Therefore, we selected sequencing reads covering both positions in each specimen to measure the frequencies of the double mutants (i.e., D510G, I529T), the single mutants (i.e., D510G, I529 and D510, I529T), and the wild type (i.e., D510, I529). On average, the frequency of the double mutant was only 1.4% \u00b1 0.3%, whereas the single mutants and the wild type were present at 87.7% \u00b1 1.9% and 6.5% \u00b1 1.7%, respectively (Fig. 3) . Recently, both D510G and I529T mutations in RBD were shown to reduce its affinity for human CD26 compared with the wildtype RBD (Kim et al. 2016c ). Although the previous study did not test the binding affinity of the double mutant, in our data the two mutations are mutually exclusive, suggesting that the double mutant severely impairs viral fitness. Notably, although the frequency of each single mutant varied greatly among specimens, the combined frequency of both single mutants was consistently high in most samples. At the same time, the frequency of the wild type was no more than 10% in most samples (31 of 35 specimens). Thus, our data suggest that there was strong selection pressure favoring the variants of the spike glycoprotein with reduced affinity for the host receptor.",

After removal of the two nonvalidated candidates, we ultimately listed a total of 14 non-consensus variants, expecting an 89% validation rate. There was a tight correlation between the frequencies of the two variants at positions 22984 and 23041. These results suggest that technical artifacts were highly unlikely to have generated such non-consensus variants. Our analysis was limited to relatively high-frequency variants because the sequencing error rate presents certain limitations for the study of RNA as opposed to DNA viruses. Technical advances such as the use of unique molecular identifiers to remove PCR errors may produce more accurate descriptions of MERS-CoV populations in patients (Kinde et al. 2011) .

Among sequences from patients exposed to Patient 14, a subset displayed either C or T alone with little intrapatient heterogeneity, whereas others showed similar intrapatient heterogeneity to Patient 14. In addition, we could not find any significant differences in genetic variants based on disease severity group (Supplemental Tables S3  and S4 ). Taken together, genetic variant composition in each patient varied, regardless of the transmissibility or disease severity, suggesting that transmission of individual genetic sequences was stochastic rather than selective.

The study showed that D510G and I529T mutations resulted in reduced affinity of RBD for the human CD26 receptor compared with the wildtype RBD. Based on the spread of a mutant MERS-CoV with reduced affinity for the receptor, the authors suggested that MERS-CoV adaptation during human-to-human spread might be driven by host immunological pressure such as neutralizing antibodies (Kim et al. 2016c) . Consistent with the previous analysis, our data showed that the I529T and D510G mutations were observed in the consensus sequences from 29 and 4 of 35 samples, respectively.

In such cases, a reduction in host immune pressure might increase the frequency of the wild type. Four specimens displaying relatively high frequency (i.e., >10%) of the wild type belonged to Patients 77 and 80. We noticed dramatic changes in routine blood test results such as white blood cell (WBC) counts and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels in these patients. We analyzed 19 serial specimens from eight patients. For this, we used normalized WBC count values expressed as a percentage of the first of a series of samples from each patient. Serial samples from Patients 77 and 80 displayed a dramatic decrease in the normalized WBC count and a simultaneous increase in the frequency of the wild-type allele (Supplemental Fig. S4 ). Whereas WBC counts significantly decreased in those patients, the CRP level increased during the period of MERS-CoV infection, indicating an impaired immune response. Although these data are limited owing to the small sample size and the lack of direct measurement of host immunological pressure, our results suggest that the selection pressure exerted by the host immune response might favor variants with reduced affinity to the host receptor; therefore, a reduction in this selection pressure resulted in the expansion of viruses with the wild-type allele. The characterization and quantification of neutralizing antibodies in patients over time is required to determine their association with the mutants and to validate the hypothesis. Moreover, more accurate descriptions of MERS-CoV populations within patients will advance our understanding of the complex molecular evolution of MERS-CoVs.",

Combining the eight MERS-CoV genome sequences from our study with the downloaded sequences, a phylogenetic analysis was performed after aligning the sequences using MUSCLE (http://drive5.com/muscle). A total of 30,130 aligned nucleotides were input into MEGA 7.0 (http://www.megasoftware.net) (Tamura et al. 2013) , and a phylogenetic tree was constructed using the neighbor-joining method. The GenBank accession number followed by a brief description of the sequence, including the virus variant name and the country of isolation, is provided for each sequence in Supplemental Figure S2 . Evolutionary distances were computed using the Kimura two-parameter model. The scale bar at the bottom of the figure indicates nucleotide substitutions per site.",
