            "text": "Medical anthropology operates as a focal area within anthropology that draws on all five of the discipline's major subfields: biological, cultural, and linguistic anthropology, archeology, and applied or engaged anthropology. Medical anthropologists study health and illness as biosocial states of being in the lifeworlds of different populations, are attentive to links and flows between macro-and microenvironments, and pay close attention to the distribution (and maldistribution) of diseases and resources promoting health. They are invested in several lines of research, of which five are highlighted. The first is the biocultural examination of health and illness across the life course given changing social, cultural, material, and environmental conditions that affect biological processes. The second is the study of how cultural values and social institutions, socioeconomic processes, and power relations inform regarding the way illness and risk of illness is experienced, represented, and responded to by different groups and (ethno)medical systems. The third is an examination of health care provision and exclusion, disease surveillance, and control as a means of understanding the politics of responsibility locally, nationally, and globally. The fourth involves the critical assessment of interventions developed in the name of health and development, and the ways they have been implemented, monitored, and evaluated. And the fifth line of research is attentive to the production of knowledge about health, the way health problems are framed (and by whom), and the ways in which framing problems and groups in particular ways serve as charters for thinking about and solving problems in particular ways.",

            "text": "Environmental health is a central concern for medical anthropologists, who view this field broadly using several different theoretical lenses. One lens is political ecology, which focuses on political and economic factors and the way they change ecological conditions that affect relationships between humans and other species that cohabit common landscapes, environmental practices and policy, and representations of environments. In terms of scale, medical anthropologists frequently analyze biosocial phenomena on a continuum extending from the local to the global to document how social and economic relations play out in space and time. Medical anthropology's approach to environmental health begins with how human beings populate and move within and between environments, considers how their presence affects and is affected by ecosocial conditions within these environments, and considers how these conditions are shaped by local, regional, and global factors that span religion and cosmology, science and technology, economics and politics. This perspective expands the framing of environment beyond that of a discrete physical space in which humans reside, to nested and overlapping environments that synergistically affect each other in the context of rapid globalization. Today, local communities and economies are increasingly subject to pressures and opportunities associated with emerging global markets, changing patterns of consumption, and expanding networks of transportation and communication. Local environments are modified, manipulated, and affected by regional and global processes such as changing agricultural patterns and practices, industrial development and resource extraction, demographic trends associated with transitions from rural to urban economies, and the movement of goods, humans, and microorganisms. Environment is not simply where people live, but where they are positioned given local ties, individual and community identity, and emergent global ecological flows and social networks.",

They build on contributions from scholars outside anthropology, and are often involved in research partnerships with related disciplines such as public health, medical sociology, economics, geography, ecology, and the health sciences.

For example, medical anthropologists study the policies, politics, and bureaucracies responsible for the regulation of water and sanitation, forestry, food safety, etc., as they relate to health outcomes. They also study the activities and linkages between local and global NGOs devoted to environment and health oversight as well as the ways in which NGO hiring practices impact on government health infrastructure. Global policies related to the control of environmental pollutants ranging from pesticides to tobacco smoke, and the accessibility and regulation of pharmaceutical products, also fall under the purview of medical anthropology. In keeping with an important shift in analytical focus from 'international health' to 'global health,' medical anthropologists have become increasingly interested in health diplomacy and what it takes to introduce and enforce global policies across national boundaries for global good. Much of the driving force behind global health is the recognition that emerging diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or influenza (both swine and avian) move quickly and require well-coordinated global disease control policies that demand the surveillance of local environments and the interface between animal and human ecosystems. Medical anthropologists are involved with both documenting examples of local-global disease linkages and representations of such linkages by the popular press and political parties, as well as the response of citizens and activists.",

In the following section, a brief discussion of a few of these conceptual frameworks is provided, beginning with those provided by political ecology and biocultural anthropology. Then these concepts are expanded to consider how environmental health is linked to issues of risk and risk perception, the accumulation and persistence of meaning and memory in cultural landscapes, and the consequences of disproportionate exposure to risks and hazards. Also, implications are examined for effective governance in light of these disparities and the mobilization and response of emergent social movements as they address disparities and inequality.",

It looks upstream at the actors and actions responsible for setting environmental changes in motion, and downstream at those subject to such changes. Political ecology is attentive to the impact of ecological changes on not just humans, but other species as well, which may ultimately have an effect on human health. They are also attentive to disparities that result from ecological changes such as unequal access to resources and uneven exposure to risks. There are numerous examples of political ecological studies that look at poor health as an outcome of poor environmental policy related to deforestation, the creation of dams and irrigation systems, shifts from food crops to cash crops like tobacco, misuse of chemical fertilizers and pesticides, the explosion of consumer culture that generates vast quantities of waste, increasing fossil fuel consumption that alters climate and weather patterns, natural or man-made disasters that are exacerbated by environmental modification and degradation, and the loss of local and global biodiversity as wilderness areas are lost or degraded.",

Political ecology embraces complex systems thinking and points to the limitations of adopting a narrow definition of the natural environment and treating local and global environments as independent from one another. A basic assumption is that the natural and cultural are so thoroughly intertwined that it is difficult to consider either in abstraction, and that it is necessary to consider the ecological and the sociopolitical as coextensive. Recent scholarship on the social construction of nature addresses this arbitrary distinction between nature and culture and considers the way human behavioral patterns are embedded within environmental contexts. This critical stance serves as a useful corrective against simplistic depictions of nature as bounded and an empty space within which social processes play out.",

Embodiment refers to the lived experience of one's body, as well as one's experience of life mediated through the body, as this is influenced by its physical, psychological, social, political, economic, cultural, and technologically mediated environments. Medical anthropologists investigate the cumulative effect of factors such as insufficient or excessive food, living in crowded spaces not conducive to physical activity, exposure to risks and hazards, and stressors ranging from the material to the psychosocial across the lifespan (and beyond). Common outcomes they assess include the incidence and prevalence of chronic illness, and precursors of disease like blood pressure, life expectancy, and birth weight. They are further attentive to variations in health outcomes both across and within populations, and search for differences that make a difference under such rubrics as positive deviance (see below). Opinions range on the relative contributions of biological, sociocultural, genetic, and environmental factors to states of health, but all biocultural oriented medical anthropologists agree that the 'action is in the interaction'meaning that individual factors are less important than the intersection of them all.",

Medical anthropology is attentive to the ways in which perceptions of risk alter behavior, shape government policy, enable governance, frame health care interventions, and influence consumer behavior as well as marketing. Research focuses on issues that include surveillance and regulation of populations at risk, social and technological strategies to reduce risks, perceptions and experiences of risk exposure (risk subjectivity) that lead to the adoption of risk-related practices, and social responses to perceptions of being at risk.",

These stakeholders range from medical and public health professionals working with diagnostic tests to identify risk to marketers cashing in on collective anxieties. The preoccupation with risk in popular literature is symptomatic of one of the paradoxes of modernity. Citizens of the risk society strive to gain mastery over nature through technology, yet increasingly recognize that tangible risks occur as local and global environments are modified by this very technology.

The consequences of chronic disease are presently under-appreciated in contexts where acute illness is so visible, but in reality, the two are often interrelated. For example, fighting malnutrition is at once a child survival priority to prevent stunting and wasting during a child's peak period of development, and a way of reducing chronic disease later in life for children who do survive and are more likely to suffer from diseases like diabetes or heart disease.",

One of the most dangerous effects of structural violence is degradation of social networks and loss of social capital, which results in loss of family or community security and safety nets.

An analysis focused on syndemics invites to look upstream and consider the importance of how these variables translate into elevated disease concentrations, and to consider not only the current impact of interactions between social factors and health problems, but future problems that result from such interactions. Some examples of syndemics that are of interest to medical anthropologists include the interrelated problems of drug abuse, violence, tuberculosis (TB) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) in North American inner cities; or the increasing proportion of overweight residents of the United States, and the linked diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, and heart disease.",

A syndemic framework applied to zoonoses and human-animal interactions points in a more complex direction, encouraging a consideration of not only the consequences of habitat encroachment or environmental degradation in specific cases or regions, but the large-scale practices such as industrial farming, monoculture agriculture, or deforestation as part of a larger global problem, since individual practices or events cannot be isolated from the larger impacts of the human footprint on both local and global environments.

This has radically altered the notion of personal, social, and political networks, as well as that of 'the local,' which can no longer be viewed in isolation. The local is now part of an interconnected global network that exchanges information, commodities, images, and ideas, and is facilitated by technologies such as the Internet, cell phones, text messaging, and emerging social media sites such as Twitter or Facebook. The extent and speed of this exchange means that the plight of a community or the goals of a local environmental group can be communicated almost as fast (or faster!) across the globe as it can to the next town, and new social groupings of individuals coalesce around shared environmental experiences and mutual advocacy interests. Paul Rabinow coined the term biosociality to refer to groups that come to share a common biologically understood identity due to illness, health-related condition, or perceived risk. In some instances, shared biological affiliation has led members of a community of affliction to make demands on institutions, governments, and scientists as a form of biopolitics. Medical anthropologists are interested in how such groups (ranging from NGOs to patient advocate and environmental health groups) are formed and mobilized as new actors on the global health stage, how their activism is responded to by those in power, and the novel sorts of social organization that result from these novel groupings centered on biosociality.",

Likewise, international news is being reported locally, along with commentary on global health threats that are colored by political rhetoric and subject to sensationalism or attempts to allay public fears. Media environments also include advertising copy and marketing campaigns, which are often difficult to distinguish from legitimate science in the health-medical field, so that much of the public's information about health and illness is gleaned from information and advertising generated by the pharmaceutical industry, an industry that also influences publications in scientific journals cited in support of their products. Mediated environments at once facilitate the transfer of credible information and foster epidemic fear, which raises concerns over responsible reporting and oversight as well as the need to study how the public understands and responds to news stories and advertisements that inform the public about risk. Analysis of media environments does not assume comprehensive availability of information, but focuses on the myriad forces that affect what information is made available or chosen for dissemination, the global network of media conduits that convey this information, the multiple social contexts that receive this information via official (e.g., politics, news media) and unofficial (e.g., rumor) networks, and the impact these flows of information have on risk perception, epidemic fear, and behavior change.",

Medical anthropologists are interested in translational research that studies how health information is presented to the public, received, and understood, as well as in monitoring the impact of news stories and advertising campaigns on different sectors of the population.

Popular epidemiology describes an example of an emergent social movement within the United States wherein members of local communities who are dissatisfied with governmental policies and oversight are undertaking their own analyses of local problems related to poor health outcomes. They are using tools increasingly at their disposal to communicate with scientists, environmental activists, policy makers in other places, and so on, and taking well-informed proactive stances against politics and business as usual. Medical anthropologists study popular forms of social empowerment and local responses to environmental and occupational health crises. They are also interested in how local groups that share a common sense of biosociality find and support one another on the Internet as well as communicate their plight to larger audiences and inspire other groups to mobilize.",

            "text": "Anthropologists working on environmental health draw on a robust literature that has grown up alongside a discussion of the tragedy of the commons. The idea of global commons has been used to describe various shared resources that are both managed through community oversight and are undermined by greed, poor regulation, and poor enforcement of existing regulations. The management of resources like clean air, water, a stable local food supply, and so on, and practices such as sustainable agriculture and water conservation demonstrate ways that groups come together to preserve/conserve resources. Examples of mismanagement, overuse of limited resources, and the cumulative effects of seemingly small negative impacts illustrate the tragedy of these commons, as resources are squandered, degraded, or polluted. At a local scale, people develop a relationship with land and the surrounding environment, and the knowledge, ideas, and informational resources embedded within the local cultural and physical landscapes are lost when these landscapes are destroyed or altered by habitat loss, environmental degradation, or pollution. Globally, issues such as loss of biodiversity; cumulative impacts of pollution; the overuse of pesticides, antibiotics, and fertilizers; and widespread environmental modification and degradation all point to potential global impacts. Global versus local governance of the commons is a contentious political issue especially as it pertains to issues of national sovereignty and the locus of responsibility, for example, in governing the availability and use of valuable antibiotics like the drug rifampicin (an important TB drug) or antiretroviral drugs for HIV. If they are misused or sold in diluted doses, resistant pathogens will emerge that affect all nations. Medical anthropologists interested in health diplomacy investigate when and under what circumstances a sovereign state allows global bodies to dictate policy within its border or engage in global surveillance.",

Local populations are shown maps depicting higher and lower prevalence rates of a focal problem or syndemic, and then asked to participate in problem solving about what factors contribute to the patterns visually shown. The method then layers maps with existing information on who inhabits different places and what is known about the space and the people who inhabit these places.",

By broadening analytical focus beyond physical and material landscapes to include ideological, representational, and perceptual landscapes, medical anthropologists have been attempting to capture the dynamic interplay between (1) political representations of environments of risk; (2) media representations as influenced by local, national, and international information streams; (3) public health representations; and (4) community-and NGO-based representations. The issue is how various representations of the environment and environmental health problems are associated with the politics of responsibility, and how these politics play out in health policy. For example, much research on emerging and reemerging infectious disease centers on the epidemiology of these diseases, and environmental and behavioral factors that are thought to catalyze their emergence or facilitate their spread. Medical anthropologists are contributing to this field of study by assisting public health teams in their efforts to identify routes of disease transmission as well as routes of information flow about diseases that affect community responses to them. This includes the monitoring of rumors associated with epidemic fear, whether expressions of current collective anxieties are tied to social memory of past epidemic disease or politically motivated and strategically disseminated.",

Patterns of consumption create environments of risk through pollution (air, water, garbage disposal), increases in traffic fatalities (road congestion, alcohol consumption, cell phone use while driving), new breeding sites for disease vectors (tires, plastic containers), and breeding grounds for violence (availability of firearms, illegal drugs, etc.). On a structural level, poor planning of urban environments encourages unhealthy consumption habits. For example, lack of safe walkable communities contributes to car-centric transportation and decreases in physical activity. The decreased presence of fresh food vendors due to high rents or lack of space for markets leads to greater consumption of fast foods. The proliferation of advertising of fast food, liquor, and cigarettes in spaces inhabited by the poor predisposes them to lifestyle illnesses.",

Harm reduction behavior is diverse, ranging from the consumption of dietary supplements to detoxify the body, to air filters to clean the air, bottled water, and ways of coping with stress that include everything from yoga classes to the taking of drugs like Prozac. Medical anthropologists are presently studying both how individuals exposed to environments of risk attempt to protect themselves, and how an emphasis on self-care averts attention from the consequences of unhealthy living spaces and hazardous work environments. To what extent does this reduce pressure to alter these unhealthy environments? Taking a life span perspective, medical anthropologists are also interested in studying the biological sequelae of shifts in a population's consumption of food and food drugs, and new living and working arrangements. To what extent does this change the age of puberty, increase the incidence of obesity, or predispose populations to chronic diseases like diabetes?",

Medical anthropologists are beginning to take a greater interest in monitoring and examining arguments about global policies that relate to transnational regulation. These arguments are being advanced by various stakeholders, which range from governments to NGOs, and local to transnational business interests. They consider issues such as the following. What types of arguments are being made in the name of health diplomacy? What is the relative success or failure of these arguments? What types of data do stakeholders find compelling? And what sets of issues, stakeholders, and social processes are involved in successful and unsuccessful attempts at diplomacy and governance?

Medical anthropologists are interested in studying how this policy plays out in countries that are presently undergoing decentralization. How will global funds for surveillance and control be distributed locally, and how will oversight of disease control programs be managed? Medical anthropologists have begun to critically assess the local impact of transnational techniques of governance associated with agenda setting policies and programs, audit, and evaluation.

Medical anthropologists have become interested in studying the ways in which local social organizations are supported by, and interface with, transnational movements, and how national governments and international organizations enlist the assistance of these advocacy groups to further differing agendas.

It will be important to study the resources communities draw on following periodic and relatively rare crises, as well as recurrent or endemic events that chronically persist. Medical anthropologists have become interested in studying not just groups at risk, but positive deviance groups or individuals that fare better than expected in a difficult situation or harsh environment. It is hoped that the study of positive deviance will provide insights into the resilience of households and social networks, and suggest ways that these social formations may be buffered and strengthened.",
