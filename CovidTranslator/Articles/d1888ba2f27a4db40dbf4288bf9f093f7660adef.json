In this retrospective study, serum IgG antibodies to two bovine enteric caliciviruses, GIII.2 Bo-NoV (Bo/CV186-OH/00/US) and genetically and antigenically distinct nebovirus (Bo/NB/80/US), were evaluated in feedlot and veal calves from different regions of the US during 1999-2001. Three groups of 6-to 7-month-old feedlot calves from New Mexico (NM) (n=103), Arkansas (AR) (n=100) and Ohio (OH) (n=140) and a group of 7-to 10-day-old Ohio veal calves (n=47) were studied. Serum samples were collected pre-arrival or at arrival to the farms for the NM, AR and OH calves and 35 days after arrival for all groups for monitoring seroconversion rates during the period. Virus-like particles of Bo/CV186-OH/00/US and Bo/NB/80/US were expressed using the baculovirus expression system and were used in ELISA to measure antibodies. A high seroprevalence of 94-100 % and 78-100 % was observed for antibodies to GIII.2 BoNoV and nebovirus, respectively, in the feedlot calves tested. In the Ohio veal farm, an antibody seroprevalence of 94-100 % and 40-66 % was found for GIII.2 BoNoV and nebovirus, respectively. Increased seropositive rates of 38-85 % for GIII.2 BoNoV and 26-83 % for nebovirus were observed at 35 days after arrival and commingling on farms for all groups. Infection of calves with either GIII.2 BoNoV or nebovirus, or both viruses, appeared to be common in the regions studied in the US during 1999-2001. These two viruses likely remain endemic because no commercial vaccines are available. C. Thomas and K. Jung contributed equally to this work.",

They were initially identified in fecal samples from calves (under 7 days of age) in farms with histories of diarrhea in England (Newbury-2 strain) and Germany (Jena strain) in 1978 and 1980, respectively [10, 34] . In the US, two distinct bovine enteric calicivirus strains were discovered by electron microscopy and RT-PCR and later characterized genetically by sequence analysis. Bo/CV186-OH/00/US is a GIII.2 BoNoV that was identified in a stool sample from veal calves in Ohio in 2000 [29] . Bo/NB/80/US, detected in a fecal sample from a diarrheic calf from Nebraska in 1980, is a nebovirus that is genetically unrelated to the BoNoVs [28, 29] . Notably, the NB strain was the first nebovirus to be completely sequenced, and based on sequence data, it represented a potentially new calicivirus genus [28] . It is noteworthy that Newbury-1 virus, which was detected from diarrheic calves in the UK in 1978, also belongs to the genus Nebovirus, as confirmed by sequence analysis in subsequent studies [22] . In the US, other GIII.1 BoNoVs were later detected and characterized molecularly from calves in Michigan and Wisconsin [32] . Previous study showed no antigenic relatedness between the Bo/NoV/GIII.2/Newbury-2 and Bo/Nebovirus/Newbury-1 strains [5] . Another study has shown that BoNoV GIII.1 (Jena) and GIII.2 (Newbury-2) are also antigenically unrelated, suggesting that they are distinct serotypes [23] .",

Similarly, recombinant baculovirus carrying the VP1 gene of the nebovirus NB/80/US strain was also generated. Briefly, the NB/80/US capsid gene was ligated into the pBlueBac4.5 baculovirus transfer vector (Invitrogen) to create the pBac-NB vector, which was then introduced into Spodoptera frugiperda 9 (Sf9) cells by transfection using a Bac-N-Blue Transfection Kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Recombinant clones (rBac-NB) were plaque purified and confirmed to contain the NB/ 80/US capsid gene by PCR.",

            "text": "There have been detailed studies on the seroprevalence of BoNoVs in Europe [6, 21, 24] ; however, to our knowledge, no such studies have been performed in the US. Furthermore, there have been no studies on the seroprevalence of nebovirus. Our retrospective serological study demonstrates a high seroprevalence (up to 100 %) of antibodies to GIII.2 BoNoV and nebovirus in cattle from 1999 to 2001 in the US, indicating that these two viruses were endemic in cattle during the period tested. However, further serological surveys of contemporary serum samples are needed to determine if these viruses remain endemic in US cattle. The distribution of nebovirus is unknown, and these viruses have been detected in the US, UK, France, Italy, and Tunisia [7, 13, 18, 22, 28] . In contrast, the distribution of GIII.1 and GIII.2 BoNoVs appears to be worldwide. Bovine NoVs have been detected in North and South America, Asia, and Europe [1, 14, 16, 18, 21, 25, 29, 34] . The prevalence is likely to be variable, depending on the location and the diagnostic test used. In addition, our study demonstrates that the GIII.2 BoNoV CV186-OH/00/US strain and the nebovirus NB/80/US strain are antigenically unrelated, which coincides with data reported previously showing no antigenic relatedness between the GIII.2 Bo-NoV Newbury-2/76/UK strain and the nebovirus Newbury-1/76/UK strain [5] . The seroprevalence rates for GIII.2 BoNoV and nebovirus in the feedlot calves tested ranged from 78 to 100 % on arrival at the feedlots, which indicates that most animals had been exposed to this virus previously. In the US, feedlot calves are usually assembled in order-buyer barns. After the animals are purchased, they may be transported long distances and commingled with animals assembled from other farms into feedlots. During this shipping and commingling process, calves become naturally infected with many pathogens whose spread may be enhanced by stressful conditions during the transport and close confinement. Based on this calf collection system practiced in auction barns in the US, where animals are purchased from different regions of the country, it can be inferred from the samples tested that both GIII.2 BoNoV and nebovirus infections are widespread in the feedlot calves in the areas of the US represented. It is notable that a majority of feedlot calves tested had antibodies to both viruses, indicating that infection of US calves with both of these viruses is common. Consistent with our current findings of archival samples (1999) (2000) (2001) , recent studies in Germany and in the UK have shown that GIII.1 (Jena) and GIII.2 (Newbury-2) BoNoVs are endemic in cattle in those countries, with seroprevalence rates ranging from 66 to 99 % [6, 24] . Likewise, a recent study in Belgium has shown that GIII.2 BoNoVs are endemic in the cattle of that country, with a detected seroprevalence rate of 93 % for the group of calves studied [21] . Such high seroprevalence rates are expected for BoNoVs because these viruses are stable, highly contagious, and easily transmitted [12, 17] . Human NoVs are also stable in the environment, and the infectious dose may be as low as 10-100 virus particles [15] . The high seroprevalence rates may also reflect the prolonged shedding of BoNoVs in the feces as detected in conventional or gnotobiotic calves infected with GIII.2 BoNoVs [12, 16, 17] .",

Similar results were observed in a recent study in Belgium, where antibody levels against GIII.2 BoNoV were higher in adult cattle (older than 1 year) than in younger calves [21] .

To date, no commercial vaccines for these two viruses are available in the US. Thus, the seropositive rates reflect natural field exposures. The increased seropositive rates of calves to nebovirus or GIII.2 BoNoV also indicate that cattle might be infected at a young age and re-exposed to either virus at auction barns or in feedlots. However, further serological surveys of contemporary serum samples are needed to determine if these viruses remain endemic in US cattle. Although GIII.1 BoNoVs have also been detected in US cattle in the limited surveys conducted [29, 32] , future GIII.1 BoNoV seroprevalence studies in the US are also needed.",
