Coughing and dyspnea were the predominant clinical signs. All dogs in group 1 (6 dogs) and group 3 (10 dogs) exhibited various degrees of coughing, which lasted an average of 2.7 days and 4.5 days, respectively. On the other hand, only 60% (6 of 10) of the vaccinated dogs in group 4 exhibited a mild cough, which lasted an average of 1.3 days. One dog in group 1 was euthanized at 9 days postchallenge due to respiratory distress and pneumonia. One dog in group 3 died at 8 days postchallenge due to severe pneumonia. None of the 6 dogs challenged with S. equi subsp. zooepidemicus alone exhibited any clinical signs. Dogs challenged with CIV plus S. equi subsp. zooepidemicus showed significantly higher clinical scores than dogs challenged with CIV alone (median score of 17.8 versus 7.0, respectively; P \u03ed 0.012). The CIV vaccine significantly reduced the clinical scores induced by CIV plus S. equi subsp. zooepidemicus (median score, 2.5; P \u03fd 0.0001). The results suggest that CIV causes severe respiratory disease in dogs that could lead to mortality. S. equi subsp. zooepidemicus acts as a secondary pathogen and enhances CIV-induced disease. In this study, S. equi subsp. zooepidemicus did not induce any clinical disease on its own. Virus shedding. Nasal virus shedding was monitored in all CIV-challenged dogs (groups 1, 3, and 4) on the day before challenge and then every day from day 1 through day 10 postchallenge. The average virus titer for each group, expressed as log 10 TCID 50 /ml, was plotted against days postchallenge (Fig.  2) . Fifty percent of the dogs in groups 1 and 4 and 100% of dogs in group 3 started shedding CIV in nasal secretions from day 1 postchallenge. By day 2 postchallenge, all dogs in groups 1, 3, and 4 were positive for nasal virus shedding. Viral shedding in groups 1 and 3 reached its peak between day 4 and day 5 after challenge with CIV, followed by a precipitous drop on day 6 (Fig. 2) . Peak viral shedding in group 4 was on day 2 post-CIV challenge, followed by a precipitous drop by day 3. Dogs in group 4 continued to shed virus at low levels until day 7 postchallenge.

In the current study, the CIV (H3N8) vaccine significantly reduced the severity of clinical disease, viral shedding, bacterial shedding, and lung pathology in dogs infected with CIV and S. equi subsp. zooepidemicus. Hence, CIV vaccine could be used to aid in protecting dogs against CIV as well as against opportunistic bacterial pathogens, such as S. equi subsp. zooepidemicus. These findings are important because most, if not all, dogs will be infected with a variety of pathogens commonly found in the canine respiratory tract (e.g., S. equi subsp. zooepidemicus), and concomitant infection with CIV could further complicate respiratory disease and may result in mortality. Therefore, vaccination of dogs at risk for infection, such as those housed in shelters or kennels or those that are frequently boarded or go to dog day care and dog parks, is the best way to protect against CIV as well as against other secondary pathogens.",
