Named because of their wheel-like appearance in negatively stained extracts examined by electron microscopy (rota \u00bc Latin for wheel) rotaviruses have since become established as causes of severe acute diarrhoea in the young of many mammalian and avian species worldwide.

RotaTeq (Merck & Co., USA) is a live-attenuated pentavalent vaccine that contains five genetically distinct human-bovine reassortant virus strains (Vesikari, 2006) . Each reassortant strain contains a human gene, encoding one of the outer capsid proteins (G1, G2, G3, G4 and P[8]), within a bovine strain backbone (G6P[5]). RotaTeq is administered orally as a three dose schedule, recommended at two, four and six months of age. Rotarix (GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals, Rixensart, Belgium) is a monovalent vaccine containing a single strain (RIX4414) of the most prevalent genotype worldwide (G1P[8]) and is administered orally at two and four months of age. Several other vaccine candidates are in various stages of development and licensure including neonatal strains isolated in India and Australia and bovine-human reassortant vaccine strains.",
