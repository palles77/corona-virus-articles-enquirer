The aim of this study was to evaluate the attack rate of HCP by the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus during the 2009 pandemic influenza season in Korea. HCP infected with H1N1 virus were asked to fill out a questionnaire, which included job type, method of diagnosis, facility type, history of contact with patients infected by H1N1 virus, vaccination status, and use of personal protective equipment. A total of 328 HCP (female 68.6%, 225/328) were infected with H1N1 virus at the nine study centers. The highest attack rate was in physicians, followed by nurses and nurses' aides. Transmission occurred J. S. Yeom and J.-H. Lee contributed equally to this work primarily after contact with outpatients (27.8%), followed by contact with inpatients (21.6%). Most (77.3%) of the infected HCP never used an N95 mask during contact with patients. Surgical masks were always used by 29.4% of the subjects and usually or intermittent used by 46.9%. The peak incidence of the H1N1 infection among HCP preceded that among the general population. Among HCPs, physicians, nurses, and nurses' aides were at the greatest risk of H1N1 infection. HCP should be more vigilant and protect themselves with appropriate personal protective equipment during the influenza season.",

Given these findings, physicians, nurses, and nurses' aides should wear appropriate protective equipment and should be the first among HCP to be vaccinated.

This was followed by exposure to infected family members and infection due to unknown origin. In a previous report, 46% of cases were due to contact with patients with either H1N1 infection or an undiagnosed respiratory illness [12] . Meanwhile, 23.0% of HCP infections were due to contact with a friend or In the healthcare setting, personal protective equipment are used to protect patients from healthcare-associated infections and to protect HCP from occupational exposure through droplet or airborne spread [8, [13] [14] [15] [16] . Face masks (N95 or surgical masks) are crucial for the successful management of an outbreak of pandemics, keeping susceptible HCP safe from hospitalized patients and outpatients shedding droplet and airborne influenza particles [8, 17, 18] . In this study, the usage rate of N95 was very low (77.3% of HCP did not use an N95 mask, Table 4 ). Surgical masks, on the other hand, were used relatively often (29.4% of HCP always used a surgical mask). Gloves were not used 60.6% of the time, and goggles were used only 1.2% of the time. Gowns were not used 68.4% of the time. These results are very similar to those of other studies of behavior in the hospital setting [12] .",

The vaccination of HCP was a top priority in Korea, and after vaccination of the high-risk population, the number of patients with H1N1 influenza decreased rapidly. Early vaccination of these groups including HCP may have attributed to the decline of transmission. There were no deaths among the infected HCP surveyed in this study. Most infected HCP were young and were diagnosed soon after symptoms began. We believe that young age, early diagnosis, and rapid treatment were the main reasons for the lack of deaths occurring in this study.",

First, we did not calculate attack rates with full-time equivalent (FTE), which gives a rate controlled for different intensities of exposure to source patients. The proportion of part-time workers in the tertiary hospital is very low (<1.0%) in Korea. Even if we could use FTE in analysis, the attack rates associated with exposure to source patients would be similar to the results reported in this investigation. Second, we compared the HCP infection with all patients receiving anti-viral therapy. Therefore, there is a possibility of an overestimation of influenza patients. However, during the 2009-2010 pandemic influenza season in Korea, the total number of the isolated influenza viruses reported by the influenza sentinel surveillance was 3,852 (A/H3N2, 2; A (2009 H1N1), 3,842; B, 8) [20] . Among the 3,852 isolates, 99.7% were 2009 H1N1, suggesting that the estimation of influenza patients in this report is slightly over the actual number.",
