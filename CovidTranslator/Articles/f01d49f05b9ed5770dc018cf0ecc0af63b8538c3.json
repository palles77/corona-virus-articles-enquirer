Being one of America's 7 uniformed services (Box 1), it fills essential public health leadership and service roles within major federal agencies and programs.

John Maynard Woodworth was appointed as the first supervising surgeon of the Marine Hospital Service; this position later became the US Surgeon General. Woodworth adopted a military model for his physicians, requiring them to wear uniforms and pass examinations.",

The DHHS and non-DHHS agencies, descriptions of the nurses' duties, and the number of nurses assigned are outlined in Box 2 and in Table 1 . Nurse officers provide direct care or perform administrative duties. For example, they provide direct clinical care in the Indian Health Service (IHS) and community health centers, the Department of Justice's Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP), and US Marshals Service and the Department of Homeland Security's Division of Immigration Health Services. About 30% of PHS nurses have previous military experience. They transfer from other uniformed services, such as the Army or Navy, through a mechanism known as an ''interservice transfer.''",

Federal personnel staff the stations when deployed in support of regional, state, or local venues. Even when FMSs were in the early developmental stages, they were used in response to hurricanes Katrina and Rita. Ten 250bed adaptations of the stations were created within days of Hurricane Katrina. Although the FMSs were designed to be staffed by federal personnel, they were adapted during the hurricanes to support state-run medical needs shelters. Current plans are to expand the program to include stations that are specifically designed to support the states in providing care to evacuee populations with chronic medical conditions. As FMSs continue to develop, there is ongoing discussion regarding their use as quarantine stations in the event of a pandemic influenza epidemic.",

The primary on-site team was a PHS Tier 2 team, with additional staff assigned as needed. Approximately 100 members of this team were nurse officers who staffed first aid stations on the Mall or the US Capitol grounds. Others were assigned to medical stations in the DHHS building to distribute medication. In addition, the PHS nurses operated roaming BLS teams, walking in designated areas of the US Capitol and Mall. Teams were ready to provide needed care to thousands of people who attended the event. Given the diversity of the population,as well as the frigid weather conditions, the teams saw numerous cardiac, diabetic, hydration, and cold injuries. Approximately 750 patients were seen; Corps officers treated 697 of these patients, and 48% of the injuries were cold related.

Corps nurses are the largest health profession represented in the PHS and are called on to deploy and respond with identified teams to national and international crises and disasters.

Like individuals enlisted in sister military services with unique missions, the PHS nurse may serve ''in harm's way'' to protect and defend public health during times of need. Times of need are exemplified by past national emergencies, such as the terrorist and anthrax attacks of 2001, the 2004 to 2005 tsunamis and earthquakes in Indonesia, Hurricane Katrina, and the continuing threat of the H1N1 virus (swine flu).
