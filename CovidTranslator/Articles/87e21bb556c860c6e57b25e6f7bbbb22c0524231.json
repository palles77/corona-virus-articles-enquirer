            "text": "Lassa fever is an acute viral haemorrhagic illness caused by Lassa virus (LASV), which is endemic throughout much of West Africa. The virus primarily circulates in the Mastomys natalensis reservoir and is transmitted to humans through contact with infectious rodents or their secretions; human-to-human transmission is documented as well. With the exception of Dengue fever, LASV has the highest human impact of any haemorrhagic fever virus. On-going outbreaks in Nigeria have resulted in unprecedented mortality. Consequently, the World Health Organization (WHO) has listed LASV as a high priority pathogen for the development of treatments and prophylactics. Currently, there are no licensed vaccines to protect against LASV infection. Although numerous candidates have demonstrated efficacy in animal models, to date, only a single candidate has advanced to clinical trials. Lassa fever vaccine development efforts have been hindered by the high cost of biocontainment requirements, the absence of established correlates of protection, and uncertainty regarding the extent to which animal models are predictive of vaccine efficacy in humans. This review briefly discusses the epidemiology and biology of LASV infection and highlights recent progress in vaccine development.",

Lassa fever is endemic to several West African countries. Sierra-Leone, Liberia, Guinea, and Nigeria are most heavily affected; however, LASV infections have also been detected throughout the C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Togo, Benin, Ghana, Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of Congo, Senegal, and southern Mali [4] [5] [6] [7] . As a nonspecific febrile illness with a high proportion of asymptomatic cases, LASV infection is often unreported or misdiagnosed, precluding accurate determination of its true burden.",

Viral genome and structure LASV belongs to the Arenaviridae family; it is an enveloped, singlestranded RNA virus with a bisegmented, ambisense genome [1] . The virus is spherical in shape with a diameter ranging between 70 and 150 nm. The envelope surface is smooth with T-shaped glycoprotein spikes, and encloses the genome containing the helical nucleocapsid of 400-1300 nm in length [1] . The viral genome consists of a large (L) and small (S) RNA fragment, 3.4 and 7 kb in size, respectively [10] . The L fragment encodes the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and a small, zinc-binding (Z) protein [11] . Meanwhile, the S fragment encodes the viral glycoprotein precursor (GPC) and the nucleoprotein (NP) [12, 13] . The glycoprotein (GP) spike complex drives host cell entry [14] . The mature form of GP is a trimer of heterodimers, each containing the receptor-binding subunit GP1 and the transmembrane, fusion-mediating subunit GP2 [15] . GPC also encodes a stable signal peptide (SSP) that aids in polyprotein processing into GP1 and GP2, regulation of the pH of infectivity, and provision of chaperone functions during GP maturation [16] . been the focus of recent LASV antiviral and vaccine research. Structural analyses of GP indicate that it is a primary target for neutralising antibody binding [17, 18] . However, the role of NP-specific T cells in controlling acute infection and mediating heterosubtypic immunity in animal models and Lassa fever patients, offers some justification for the inclusion of NP in LASV vaccines [19] [20] [21] .",

For several decades, the natal multimammate rat, Mastomys natalensis, was assumed to be the only host of LASV [2] . However, recent evidence indicates that LASV circulates in other rodent species. In fact, the isolation of LASV from the African wood mouse, Hylomyscus pamfi, in Nigeria and the Guinea multimammate mouse, Mastomys erythroleucus, in Nigeria and Guinea, revealed previously undiscovered LASV strains and the identification of new a phylogenetic lineage [22] . In these rodents, the virus exhibits persistent, asymptomatic infection. Due to their ubiquitous geographic distribution across the West African region, the population-at-risk for Lassa fever is estimated at nearly 60 million people [3, 4, 7] . LASV fever cases are typically the result of rodent-tohuman transmission events, facilitated by contact with infectious rodent urine or faeces in the household environment [2] . This humanvector interface predominantly occurs in resource-limited communities, where access to health care and laboratory diagnostic testing is scarce. Therefore, it is thought that many potential cases of infection are never tested [3] . Human-to-human transmission of the virus is observed, but is most often confined to nosocomial outbreaks [2, 3] . In addition to implementing vector-control strategies, vaccination is a key approach to preventing and controlling Lassa fever outbreaks.",

The dramatic increase in cases during the 2018 Nigerian Lassa fever season launched investigations into the possible emergence of a new strain with a higher transmission rate [28, 29] . Two sequencing studies, analysing 220 and 120 LASV genomes from infected patients, revealed high variability and derivation from previously circulating viruses rather than from a single dominant strain [29, 30] . The data did not indicate phylogenetic clustering of LASV from samples collected at similar time points, which would be expected in the event of increased human-to-human transmission. Therefore, Lassa virus transmission continues to principally occur via independent cross-species transmission events [29, 30] . No clear reason for the increase in Lassa fever cases has been found; changes in the distribution of the rodent reservoir population or improved disease diagnosis and surveillance remain possible explanations [30] .",

The virus primarily targets myeloid lineage cells and antigen-presenting cells (APC), such as dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages [40, 41] . These cell types support high levels of viral replication. LASV infection antagonizes the activation and maturation of APC resulting in impaired antigen processing and presentation. Despite the fact that infected APC migrate to the draining lymph nodes, their maturation remains impeded throughout the course of LASV infection, causing dysregulation of the adaptive immune response and reduced viral clearance [40, 41] . The more complete disruption of the function of APC by LASV may correlate with the lack of adaptive immune responses observed in fatal cases. The presentation of LASV antigens by immature DCs may lead to immune tolerance and ultimately immunosuppression [40, 41] .",

Neutralising antibody titres continue to rise months after convalescence, perhaps due to low levels of persisting virus that continue to stimulate B cells [48] . In seroconverted individuals, antibodies are primarily specific to GP and NP. Structural studies of B-cell antigenic epitopes have identified two binding sites on GP1, six sites on GP2, and four sites on NP [17, 54] .

Finally, a recent study of an inactivated LASV and rabies virus vaccine has provided evidence for the role of non-neutralising antibodies in virus clearance via antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis in an in vitro model of infection [58] .

Animal models will be also useful in studying vaccine-induced heterosubtypic immunity. Challenge experiments using heterologous strains of LASV would provide the clearest information on cross-protective efficacy; however, representative and reliable lethal models of infection have not been widely established for many different LASV strains. Almost all vaccine efficacy studies have been performed with wildtype or species-adapted Josiah strain LASV (lineage IV). An important area of future research will be the development of susceptible rodent and NHP models of LASV infection for epidemiologically relevant strains, particularly those currently circulating in Nigeria. A more feasible approach to collecting preliminary evidence of heterosubtypic immunity is to conduct antibody and T-cell cross-reactivity assays. Purified antigen and peptide cocktails synthesised for different strains may be used to detect cross-reactive antibody and T-cell responses in in vitro assays, such as ELISA and ELISpot. Notably, this same approach can be used to assess cross-reactive responses to diverse LASV strains in human samples obtained during future clinical trials.",

Antiviral testing and studies of disease pathogenesis have relied on immune knock out strains, such as STAT-1 KO and IFN-\u03b1/ \u03b2R \u2212/\u2212 that develop fatal infection, but are not optimally suited for the study of immune responses to vaccination [46, 60] .

Intraperitoneal infection with Josiah strain LASV produces a uniformly lethal disease in inbred strain 13 guinea pigs characterised by fever, weight loss, and death within two weeks. Lymphopenia, neutrophilia, and reduced levels of serum albumin are also observed [64, 65] . Viraemia is first detectable four days after infection and peaks 10-12 days after infection. High viral titres are found in lymph nodes, salivary glands, spleen, pancreas, and lungs; viral replication is also detected in the liver, heart, brain, kidney, and adrenal glands. LASV infection in guinea pigs may be more myocardiotropic and less hepatotropic than in humans [64, 65] . In Hartley guinea pigs, the lethality of Josiah strain LASV infection varies from 30% to over 60%. Viral titres are lower in Hartley guinea pigs and viral replication is limited in comparison with inbred animals [64, 65] . Recently, a lethal model of Lassa fever in outbred Hartley guinea pigs was developed after four passages Josiah strain LASV in the host strain [66] . After intraperitoneal inoculation with 1 \u00d7 104TCID 50 of LASV, animals uniformly succumbed to disease by 15 days post-infection.

An acceptable vaccine should at least be suitable for use in healthy adults and children, but preferably also safe in infants and pregnant women. Only mild, transient adverse effects related to immunisation will be tolerated and additional data indicating that vaccination does not induce neurological complications associated with Lassa fever (including sensorineural hearing loss and neuropsychiatric side effects) will be advantageous [73] . Demonstration of at least 70% (but preferably over 90%) protective efficacy against infection or disease in clinical trials will be required. However, if trials to measure clinical efficacy are not feasible, animal efficacy data alongside clinical immunogenicity data may be considered instead. While a single-dose regimen will be ideal, up to three-doses conferring protection against LASV lineages IeIV for a minimum of three (but preferably over five) years may be deemed acceptable. Longer term protection should be maintained through booster vaccination. Finally, vaccines must have a minimum shelf life of 12 months at \u221220\u00b0C and six months at 2-8\u00b0C; however, an optimal candidate would possess a shelf life of at least five years and thermostability at higher temperatures [73] .",

Epidemiological observations of Lassa fever in West Africa suggest surviving a single LASV infection may confer long term protection against fatal disease. Re-infection with different strains further boosts Table 1 Additional efficacy data for Lassa fever vaccines in Guinea pig and NHP models of infection. immunity. Although it is estimated that up to 18% of Lassa fever cases experience re-infection annually, recurrence of clinical disease has never been documented [74] . Cellular immune responses are implicated as having a major role in resolving LASV infection; live vaccines provide the most effective natural pathway to present antigens to MHC molecules. Moreover, given the potency of live vaccines, they are more likely to meet WHO TPP recommendations by conferring protection after one dose. Multiple replication-competent vaccinia virus-vectored candidates encoding LASV antigens are featured in Table 1 and have achieved variable efficacy in guinea pig and macaque models of Lassa fever [67, [75] [76] [77] . Vaccinia-Lister encoding NP from strain GA391 (lineage III) protected 100% of vaccinated outbred Hartley guinea pigs against challenge with strain GA391 LASV [67] . A vaccinia-NYBH-vectored vaccine encoding Josiah strain LASV NP conferred 94% protection against homologous virus challenge in inbred strain 13 guinea pigs. Meanwhile, in the same study, vaccinia-NYBH encoding Josiah strain LASV GPC protected only 79% of immunised guinea pigs [75] . However, when vaccinia-NYBH-GPC was evaluated in a homologous challenge experiment in rhesus macaques, 100% protective efficacy was observed [76] . These studies first indicated that guinea pig models of infection may not be entirely predictive of responses in NHPs. A study comparing vaccinia-NYBH vaccines in inbred strain 13 guinea pigs expressing different regions of Josiah strain LASV GPC and NP, revealed that full length GPC, including both GP1 and GP2 subunits, are necessary for protection against LASV challenge [75] . A follow-up investigation in rhesus and cynomolgus macaques indicated that vaccination with both GPC and NP antigens provided a modest increase (88% versus 90%) in protection compared to vaccination with GPC alone [77] .",

Thus, they maintain the preferred safety profile of 'killed' vaccines while possessing greater immunogenicity. Immunogenicity studies of RNA replicons derived from Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) show that the vector serves as an adjuvant to promote CD8 + T cells responses to the delivered antigen, which is a particularly attractive feature for LASV vaccine design [53] . VEEV RNA replicons, expressing either GPC or NP of Josiah strain LASV, fully protected inbred strain 13 guinea pigs from lethal infection with Josiah strain LASV [82] . However, three doses of VEEV were required to achieve protection, which while meeting the minimum requirements of WHO TPP, would be far more difficult to deploy in LASV-endemic regions that are rural or limited in their infrastructure than a single-dose vaccine. However, a multi-dose immunisation regimen may be more feasible to administer to certain groups, such as healthcare professionals or military personnel, who would be accessible for follow-up at the designated intervals. Recently, a multivalent VEEV vaccine encoding LASV GPC (LASV VLPV) from distantly related strains, LP (lineage I) and Josiah (lineage IV) was developed [53] . LASV VLPV was protective in inbred CBA/J mice and upregulated CD11c + /CD8 + dendritic cells were implicated as playing a major role in cross-presentation.

This candidate bears the additional advantage of relative ease and speed of manufacture in comparison to recombinant viral vector platforms. Despite these advantages, DNA vaccines exhibit low immunogenicity requiring multiple doses delivered via dermal electroporation in order to enhance vaccine potency and achieve full protection. Widespread adoption of DNA electroporation devices and a multi-dose immunisation regimen will be challenging to implement in rural regions of West Africa where Lassa fever is endemic, particularly during an outbreak. However, as in the case with a VEEV-vectored LASV vaccine, a multi-dose electroporation-delivered DNA vaccine may be administrable to localised groups of priority vaccinees (i.e. to hospital/clinic employees).",

Both VSV platforms are replication competent. Clinical trials provide evidence for the safety and immunogenicity of attenuated recombinant VSV vectors in humans. Perhaps most notably, following the 2013-2016 EBOV disease outbreak in West Africa, a VSV vaccine expressing the EBOV GPC (VSV\u0394G/EBOVGP) demonstrated 100% efficacy in a ring vaccination trial [88] . Protection is determined to be primarily antibody-mediated and to last for up to 14 months in NHP models of infection [89] . Perceived advantages of using the VSV system are its high level of immunogenicity and the fact that there is little preexisting immunity to the vector that might limit vaccine potency. Limitations of this platform include the absence of a thermostable formula, necessitating unbroken cold-chain for transport and storage. Second, despite replicating to high titres in several cell lines, as a negative-sense RNA virus, rescue of recombinant VSV from plasmid DNA can be cumbersome-requiring co-transfection of five plasmids into a permissive cell line [90, 91] . Finally, the reactogenicity of VSV-vectored vaccines may pose a concern; in phase I trials of VSV\u0394G/EBOVGP, high incidence of fever, headache, chills, fatigue, and myalgia was observed after immunisation [92, 93] .",

A randomised-controlled phase 2 trial enrolled 263 healthy volunteers aged 18-55 years to receive MV-CHIK (n = 195), measles prime vaccine and MV-CHIK (n = 34), or a control vaccine (n = 34). MV-CHIK was delivered intramuscularly, at 5 \u00d7 10 4 or 5 \u00d7 10 5 TCID 50 , in two different administration regimens. The primary endpoint was immunogenicity, which was defined as the presence of neutralising antibodies against chikungunya virus. Virus-specific neutralising antibodies were detected in all MV-CHIK-vaccinated groups after one or two doses. No serious adverse events related to the vaccine were reported. Overall, MV\u2212CHIK, was found to be safe, well tolerated, and highly immunogenic in healthy adults. Moreover, pre-existing immunity to the measles vector did not affect the vaccine's immunogenicity. These data support the broader use of this platform for other emerging pathogens, such as Lassa fever [101] . Recombinant adenoviruses have been used in gene therapy and as vaccine vectors for decades [102] . However, the widespread presence of pre-existing neutralising antibodies to common serotypes of human adenoviruses has precluded their immunogenicity and protective efficacy in clinical trials by inhibiting vector-mediated delivery of the antigen [103, 104] . Adoption of simian adenoviral vectors, to which humans population are less exposed, has circumvented the problem of anti-vector immunity [105] .",
