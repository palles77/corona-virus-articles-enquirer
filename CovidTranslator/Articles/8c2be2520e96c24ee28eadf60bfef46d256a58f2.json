SARS-CoV-2 is a betacoronavirus that infects humans and the disease presents mostly with fever, cough, and dyspnea (3) . Healthcare workers (HCWs) are at the front-line of COVID-19 outbreak, and their constant exposure to infected patients and contaminated surfaces can put them at risk for acquiring and transmitting the infection (4). SARS-CoV-2 appears to be transmitted person-to-person through respiratory droplets and close contact, as previously seen in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the two other zoonotic coronaviruses. In healthcare settings, this highlights the necessity of practicing respiratory hygiene and hand hygiene, and using appropriate personal protective equipment (5, 6) . Additional airborne precautions such as N95 masking should be used by HCWs during aerosolgenerating procedures when caring for COVID-19 patients (6) . The World Health Organization (WHO) has strongly recommended HCWs to ask patients to cover their nose and mouth with a tissue or elbow when coughing or sneezing, to provide masks for patients who are suspected for COVID-19, and perform appropriate hand hygiene (6) .",

            "text": "Hand hygiene with alcohol-based handrub (ABHR) is widely used around the world as one of the most effective, simple and low-cost procedures against COVID-19 cross-transmission (6) . By denaturing proteins, alcohol inactivates enveloped viruses, including coronaviruses, and thus ABHR formulations with at least 60% ethanol have been proven effective for hand hygiene (7) . ABHRs such as those recommended by the WHO, containing ethanol (80% v/v) or isopropanol (75% v/v) as active components, have a marked virucidal effect against SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (8, 9) . Accordingly, during outbreaks and periods with increased demand, in case of the absence or shortage of commerciallyproduced ABHRs, the WHO formulation can be produced locally (10) . HCWs should adhere to the WHO's My 5 Moments for Hand Hygiene: before touching a patient, before clean or aseptic procedures, after body fluid exposure or risk, after touching a patient and after touching patient surroundings (9) . The WHO guidelines promote a six-step technique by applying a palmful of ABHR, covering all surfaces of the hands and rubbing until dry (9) . However, low hand hygiene compliance levels are still a disquieting challenge worldwide despite the numerous interventions and campaigns performed in promoting this action (11) . According to existing reports, hand hygiene, an essential component of infection prevention and control (IPC), is often neglected by HCWs both in developed and developing countries, with compliance rates sometimes dipping below 20% (12) . Overcrowding of healthcare facilities, and the absence of distinct patient zones and lack of access to reliable and adequate ABHR, are among the many challenges preventing effective hand hygiene procedure in resource-limited healthcare settings (13) .",

Their frequent exposure to pathogens, long working hours, stressful work environment and fatigue predispose them to acquire or transmit infections such as COVID- 19 (15, 16) . Their adherence to IPC guidelines is vital in combatting the current COVID-19 pandemic (15). Most healthcare-acquired infections could be avoided by well-trained nurses with appropriate hand hygiene compliance and use of protective equipment (17) . In order to ensure safety and quality of care, having adequate number of nursing staff and access to equipment is crucial (18) . The growing rate of nosocomial transmission of COVID-19 magnifies the global demand to implement IPC more effectively in all healthcare settings (2, 6).",
