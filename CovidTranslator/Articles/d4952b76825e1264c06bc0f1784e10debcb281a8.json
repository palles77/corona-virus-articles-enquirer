            "text": "Cottonseed meal (CSM) has long been recognized as an excellent and economical source of protein in starter and grower rations for dairy calves (3, 12) . After the solvent extraction of oil from prepared cottonseeds, the resulting CSM is available for feeding. Gossypol, a polyphenolic binaphthyl aldehyde contained in the seed pigment glands, is released during the extraction process (I, 3, 21) . The gossypol content of CSM is influenced by the species of cotton plant, growing conditions, and the method of oil extraction used (8, 22, 27) . Because gossypol is toxic to animals, a limiting factor of CSM is its potential toxicological effect (8, 10, 16, 18) . Gossypol in unprocessed seed is in the free fonn, not bound to proteins. During processing, some of the free gossypol (FG) complexes with proteins, primarily the e-amino group of Lys, and becomes bound (8) . Toxicity generally is attributed to FG; however, some recent evidence suggests that bound gossypol may be converted to FG in the gastrointestinal tract (6, 18) .",

            "text": "Monogastric species, such as swine and poultry, are quite susceptible to gossypol toxicity. In contrast, ruminants detoxify gossypol in the rumen by binding it to soluble proteins or by dilution and slowed absorption. The gossypol-protein complex is less toxic. In monogastric species, this binding mechanism is less effective (26) . Calves with undeveloped rumens (preruminants) function essentially as monogastrics, and gossypol cannot be efficiently detoxified. Despite years of favorable practical experiences with the feeding of CSM to calves, especially in California, recent reports (14, 16, 19) have described gossypol poisoning in calves and lambs. In those reports, the variability in calf responses to CSM feeding was due to different undefined dietary and management conditions, raising questions about the actual safe concentration of FG in the ration. In addition, there has been a paucity of research evaluating CSM with various concentrations of gossypol fed to preruminant calves. Therefore, the purpose of our study was to establish a safe concentration for FG in concentrate rations containing CSM fed to calves under commercial calf production conditions typical of large dairy herds.",

            "text": "This investigation was conducted for 120 d beginning December 12, 1989 at a commercial calf ranch in southern California. Sixty 1-d-old Holstein bull calves from local dairy farms were assembled at the calf ranch and allocated randomly to five treatment groups of 12 calves each. Each treatment provided the calves with an 18% protein starter ration that was fed for ad libitum intake during the entire investigation from d 1 to 120. The final calculated FG content for each of the treatments was 0, 100, 200, 400, and 800 ppm. The control ration (0 ppm) lacked any cottonseed product. All rations were isocaloric and isonitrogenous. During the investigation, the calves were not fed any hay or ferrous salt supplementation. The total CSM content for rations containing 100, 200, 400, and 800 ppm of FG was 31 %. The control ration contained soybean meal (SBM) as the main protein source (Table 1) . Graded Journal of Dairy Science Vol. 75, No. 10, 1992 concentrations of FG for the treatment rations were obtained by mixing two sources of CSM that contained 3850 and 230 ppm as reported by the feed mill. A third source of a 250-ppm CSM was added to balance the total CSM percentage in the rations. The three sources of CSM were analyzed for FG content prior to ration mixing and before the meals were pelleted. Mixed rations containing the CSM pellets and the other feed ingredients were analyzed for FG content three times during the study. The composition of the trace mineral mix and vitamin supplement used in the rations is shown in Table 2 . Feed consumption was measured at five intervals by measuring the total amount fed to all calves of each group. The average daily feed consumption per calf per each group for each time period was determined using the following formula (feed consumed per time period divided by calf days per time period) for each group. Using that formula, multiplied by the calculated FG in each group (0, 100, 200, 400, and 800 ppm), an estimate of the accumulated FO intake per group was determined. Feed consumption periods were\u00b0to 36, 37 to 59, 60 to 82, 83 to 93, and 94 to 120 d. Calf days per group was defined as the number of live calves times the number of days that each calf was alive. This calculation equalized and removed any bias of reduced calf numbers occurring during the study.",

            "text": "Literature attempts to define the maximum allowable nontoxic concentraiton of dietary FO are confusing in regard to young ruminants. This confusion can be attributed to two groups of variables. First, variation in the amount of FO is relative to amount and nature of other components of the diet, management factors, treatment of the gossypol in the cottonseed during processing and mixing in the feed (whole seed vs. CSM), limited feeding (sheep trials) versus free choice feeding (calves), whether the concentration of FO in feed was based on feed analysis or calculated from analysis values of the CSM before mixing, concentration and source of other protein in the diet (availability of amino groups for binding to gossypol), concentration of iron and other divalent cations in the diet, availability of hay, and length of time that milk is fed prior to weaning. Second, genetics or other ill-defined variables of animals, including natural disease and growth rate of the calf, confound results. Hollon et al. (13) reported high death losses in calves fed starters containing above 350 ppm of FO. No mortality was observed in their calves fed starter with 230 ppm of FO. In contrast, gossypol toxicity in housed calves occurred at concentrations above 840 ppm by Rogers et al. (24) . In the study reported by Morgan et at. (19) , 100% mortality occurred prior to 30 d of age in lambs administered 900 ppm of FO. and myocardial lesions were evident in euthanatized lambs consuming 100 ppm. However, in that investigation, FO was provided orally in gelatin capsules, which could have resulted in a more concentrated, undiluted dose of FO being made available for intestinal absorption within a very brief period.

            "text": "In general, calves fed CSM had good feed consumption, BW gains, and clinical health during the study. These parameters were not different compared with those of calves fed SBM. Disease was only obvious in those calves in the high FO group that eventually died or were euthanatized. In similar comparison trials using calves fed CSM, Claypool et at. (11) showed no differences in BW gains or performance when those calves were compared with calves fed SBM. The FO content in the CSM in this study (11) was not reported. Except for those calves that died in the group fed 800 ppm and 1 calf that was euthanatized from the group fed 400 ppm, there was no difference in the clinical appearance of all calves during the investigation. Of the calves that died in these groups, poor appetite and labored breathing were noted shortly before death. These findings are similar to those of The mortality rates from FG toxicity at all but the highest concentrations fed were surprisingly low in the present investigation, particularly in that protective measures, such as feeding hay or iron salts, were not used (ingredients reported to mitigate the effect of FG in ruminants) (28) . Of the many factors affecting the response of calves to FG consumption, factors involved in the prevention of absorption, intake, and detoxification are of major importance. Diarrhea may speed transit time of the gossypol through the digestive tract and alter the functional mucosal surface area in a way that decreases gossypol absorption. Although we did not observe a difference in incidence of diarrhea among groups, the possibility that diarrhea reduces gossypol absorption in certain calves cannot be ruled out. The amount of feed intake and, thus, FG consumption could have been reduced in calves with clinical illness. However, clinical disease was similar for all groups and, therefore, was not a factor in group differences in early feed consumption and mortality. Furthermore, deaths in the group fed 800 ppm occurred in calves with both highest and lowest BW gains, indicating that feed intake was not a major factor in resistance to gossypol effects. Gossypol is detoxified in the rumen by being bound to soluble microbial proteins and by dilution and slowed absorption (23) . It is not known precisely when the rumen becomes functional in growing calves, and evidence is lacking to identify factors that accelerate its development.",

Death of calves in the group fed 800 ppm occurred after clinical symptoms of respiratory distress were noted a few days prior to death. Post-mortem and histological findings in these calves were compatible with gossypol toxicity as reported by Holmberg et al. (14) and Smith (26) . They included widespread edema and congestion, particularly in the lungs and body cavities. In addition, a straw-colored effusion was noted in the abdominal and thoracic cavities. In some calves, the heart was flabby and dilated. The livers in these calves were enlarged and congested; microscopically, there was central lobular degeneration of all but the most peripheral parts of hepatic cords. This Journal of Dairy Science Vol. 75, No. 10, 1992 change in the liver could be related both to anoxia from circulatory failure and to direct toxic effects of the gossypol on hepatocytes. Gossypol concentrations of all deaths in the group fed 800 ppm were greater than 160 Jlglg of wet liver, whereas concentrations in calves fed nontoxic concentrations of FG were less than 50 Jlglg.",

Decreased hemoglobin concentration, hematocrit, and erythrocyte numbers were most pronounced at 90 d of age and returned to normal by 120 d. Decreased hematocrit and hemoglobin concentrations have been reported in calves with gossypol toxicoses (18) . Brahan et al. (9) reported that FG binds to iron when it is fed to pigs and is associated with decreased hematocrit. When ferrous ions were added to the diet containing gossypol, normal erythrocyte measures resulted, but toxicity resulted also (9) . It has been suggested that iron bound to FG is unavailable for normal biosynthesis of hemoglobin and other processes in cattle (7) . It is worth noting that iron deficiencies in the liver of calves with clinical, identifiable gossypol toxicity were not found (C. L. Holmberg, 1991, unpublished data). Decreased hematocrit could have resulted from a direct effect of FG on erythrocytes. Kuhlman et al. (17) demonstrated a linear decrease in erythrocyte fragility in cattle from 7.7 to 20% as FG intake increased from 5.9 to 18.5 gld. Similarly, Wyse et al. (29) reported an increase in erythrocyte fragility in beef bulls consuming >2 gld of FG. No signs of gossypol toxicity were observed in either of these studies.",

This accounts for the chronically labored breathing, fluid-filled lungs, hepatomegaly, and histopathological changes noted in the 4 dead calves consuming 800 ppm of FG. In swine and dogs, gossypol content of the liver was related directly to changes in electrical patterns of the heart (2, 20) . Affected changes in the electrocardiogram were the T-wave amplitude, T-wave duration, and the isoelectric S-T segment. This pattern of changes is similar to humans with hyperkalemia (18) . Elevated K were reported in two calves with gossypol toxicity (18) . Electrical pattern alterations were prominent after prolonged gossypol feeding and may have led to a loss of electrical rhythm, predisposing calves to cardiac failure (2) .

The standard analytical method used to determine FG concentrations in CSM is unsatisfactory when it is applied to mixed feeds (22) . The problem with the standard method is that incomplete recovery of FG from feed mixtures and the extraction of other feed constituents interfere in subsequent colorimetric determinations. Pons and Hoffpauir (21) described a procedure using mixed isopropyl alcohol hexane water solvent containing a gossypolcomplexing agent, 3-amino-l-propanol, which prevents interference by feed constituents and stabilizes FG during extraction. These compounds were not used in our methodology to determine FG and total gossypol in the mixed rations. Means for FG obtained from the pelleted and unpelleted CSM, using the proce-dures employed in this study, are reliable, and mathematical calculations were relied upon to give valid concentrations of FG in the mixed feeds. Barraza et al. (7) recently demonstrated that pelleted CSM reduced FG as much as 50%. However, in this study, the measured FO in the pellet was 3274 ppm compared with 3600 ppm (9% reduction) based on the FO value of the CSM after purchase. This reduction reflects both the effect of pelleting on the measurable FO and the effect of reduction that occurred during storage of the product prior to trial initiation. Therefore, calculated values closely reflect actual mixed feed levels. This observation has been made and commented on by other researchers (22) .",

Thus, we conclude that the feeding of 400 ppm of FG is mildly toxic for calves under 90 d of age. Feeding of 800 ppm of FG, however, resulted in significant death losses compatible with previous reports of gossypol toxicity.
