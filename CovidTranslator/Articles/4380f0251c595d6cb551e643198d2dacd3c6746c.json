We used automated chemiluminescent immunoassay to detect serum IgM and IgG antibodies to 2019-nCoV of 736 subjects. COVID-19 patients were becoming reactive(positive) for specific antibodies from 7-12 days after the onset of morbidity. Specific IgM and IgG increased with the progression of the disease. The areas under the ROC curves of IgM and IgG were 0.988 and 1.000, respectively. Specific antibody detection has good sensitivity and specificity.",

First, only 3 confirmed COVID-19 cases were included, and although the continuous dynamic process of anti-2019-nCoV antibody production and its relationship with disease progression have been carefully observed, a large sample of cases is still needed for verification. Second, changes in anti-2019-nCoV antibodies were only tracked for 4 to 20 days after the morbidity, with no longer-term observation. However, the trend of anti-2019-nCoV IgG and IgM antibodies production from beginning to increasing has been preliminarily found.Third, anti-2019-nCoV nucleic acid testing has not all been performed in every groups, asymptomatic infections may be missed in other disease group, which might have a certain impact on the evaluation of the diagnostic efficacy of antibodies.",
