These two genes encode RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RDRP) and envelope E protein. The RDRP plays an essential role in viral RNA replication where envelope E protein is involved in envelope formation and virus assembly. The RDRP and envelope E genes, based on published sequences, have been synthesized and cloned into mammalian expression vectors. In addition, four siRNA sites for the RDRP gene and two siRNA sites for envelope E gene were designed and tested. The siRNA or short hairpin RNA (shRNA) expression cassettes were co-transfected with the SARS viral RDRP or envelope E expression vectors into NIH 3T3 cells. The expression levels of RDRP and envelope E genes were examined by reverse transcription followed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Two of the siRNA expression cassettes for RDRP successfully inhibited the expression of the gene, whereas both of the siRNA expression cassettes for envelope E decreased approx 90% of the envelope E gene expression. The siRNA and shRNA for one of the siRNA sites of the RDRP gene were also tested, and it was found that both inhibited exogenous RDRP expression in a dose-dependent manner. These siRNA molecules could be used to examine the function of these genes in SARS virus replication and assembly. Furthermore, these molecules could potentially be developed into therapeutic agents for the treatment of patients with SARS.",

In addition siRNAs that could effectively inhibit certain gene expressions can be developed potentially as therapeutic drugs for the treatment of human diseases (7-9). Many technologies have been developed to inhibit gene expression using RNA interference (RNAi), including polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based approaches (10,11). For example, sense and antisense strands of siRNA could be generated under the control of specific promoters to form double-stranded siRNA in mammalian cells. Another possible way to produce siRNA is through a hairpin structure; in this case, the siRNAs are expressed as hairpin structures and then processed to siRNA intracellularly. In this report, both approaches have been used to test a number of siRNA molecules focusing on severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) envelope E protein and RDRP.",

Detailed sequencing analysis of the viral genome shows that several genes play an essential role in viral replication and formation. These genes, including RDRP, N protein, and envelope E protein, could be therapeutic targets for antiviral drug development (14) . Inhibition of the expression or activity of RDRP could block replication of the viral genome. On the other hand, N protein and envelope E protein are important structural proteins and inhibition of their expression may therefore interfere with the structure of nucleocapsid, and arrest envelope formation and virus assembly. The siRNAs for these genes have been designed and screened. Results obtained demonstrate that a number of siRNA molecules could effectively inhibit the expression of RDRP and envelope E genes in transfected NIH 3T3 cells. These siRNA molecules could act as a useful tool for the study of SARS virus replication and assembly.

Envelope E and RDRP genes were synthesized and transfected in NIH 3T3 cells. A real-time PCR experiment showed that both envelope E and RDRP RNA were expressed in the cells after transfection (data not shown). PCR-based RNAi technology was applied to knockdown the expression of these two viral genes. Two siRNA molecules for envelope E gene and four siRNA-targeting RDRP genes were designed and used. The RNAi targets were selected based on published strategies (17) and on-line siRNA design tools (Ambion siRNA Target Finder). First, the AAGN17C sites from 70 to 100 nucleotides downstream of the initiation codon was searched initially. It is important to avoid 5' or 3' untranslated regions as these sequences may contain regulatory protein-binding sites. The target sequences had approx 30-50% of G and C. It is also essential to avoid 4-5 continuous stretch of \"A\" and \"T\" as it may act as internal terminator. Finally, the Blast program for each selected site was carried out to ensure the specificity. The siRNAs for envelope E gene used in the experiment were located at positions 157 to 177 (Ei1) and 206 to 227 (Ei2). The PCR products of the siRNA were transfected in NIH 3T3 cells expressing the envelope E gene. Forty-eight hours after transfection, the envelope E RNA was measured using quantitative real-time PCR. The result showed that the expression of envelope E gene was downregulated with statistical significance after both siRNA treatments. Figure 2A shows Ei1 siRNA downregulated 89% of the gene expression (Student's t-test, p < 0.05), and Ei2 siRNA inhibited approx 97% (student's t-test, p < 0.01).",

            "text": "It has been shown that siRNAs were interactive with various protein factors to form the RNAinduced silencing complex (RISC) (18). The RISC was activated and guided by the antisense strand of siRNA and recognized the complementary RNA. The RISC and complementary RNA complex recruited endoribonucleases. Subsequently, the complementary RNA was cleaved by the endoribonucleases. The recognition may be biased to the strand selection during siRNA-RISC assembly and contribute to the final RNAi  efficiency (19,20) . Based on statistical analysis, the effective siRNA had A/T at the 5' end of the antisense strand and G/C at the 5'end of the sense strand. In addition, the sequence should have high A/T content in the 5' terminal one-third of the antisense strand without any GC stretch for more than nine nucleotides in length (18). In the current experiment, Ri1 and Ri3 siRNAs may have higher affinity for protein factors and form stable RISC. It is also possible that these siRNAs were more stable and performed strong catalytic activity in the cell. This may lead to an explanation for the different inhibition efficiency of these four siRNAs of the RDRP gene. This could provide important information to design and identify highly effective siRNA molecules for the SARS genes. Furthermore, it was shown that the PCR-based siRNA expression cassettes as well as the shRNA were effective.",

A number of siRNAs have been identified that effectively blocked the expression of these genes. These siRNA molecules may be useful for further studies on the mechanism of the SARS coronavirus action, and could potentially be developed as therapeutic agents for SARS treatment. Fig. 3 . Dose-dependent RNAi effect on SARS RDRP gene using siRNA expression cassettes or shRNA expression cassettes. RDRP-pcDNA3.1 was co-transfected with either Ri3 or shRNA into NIH 3T3 cells. The ratio of Ri3 and shRNA to RDRP-pcDNA3.1 were shown. A nontransfection NIH 3T3 sample was included as a blank control. The relative expression levels of RDRP gene were measured by quantitative real-time PCR, and 2 -\u2206Ct method was used. The columns present the mean of the relative gene expression, with the beta-actin as the reference gene. Black columns represent the relative gene expression treated with Ri3 siRNA expression cassettes; gray columns show the relative gene expression treated with shRNA expression cassette. The bars present the standard errors of the mean (SEM) of the relative gene expression. One-way ANOVA, p = 0.002.",

The 2 -\u2206Ct method was used to analyze envelope E gene and RDRP gene expression. (A) NIH 3T3 cells were co-transfected with envelope E gene and RNAi targets at Ei1and Ei2 sites. (B) NIH 3T3 cells were co-transfected with RDRP gene and RNAi targets at Ri1, Ri2, Ri3, and Ri4 sites. Con: NIH 3T3 cells transfected with envelope E/pcDNA3.1 or RDRP/pcDNA3.1; WT: nontransfected NIH 3T3 cells. The columns present the mean of the relative gene expression with the beta-actin as the reference gene. The bar presents the standard errors of the mean (SEM) of the relative gene expression. Student's t-test; *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01 vs control.",
