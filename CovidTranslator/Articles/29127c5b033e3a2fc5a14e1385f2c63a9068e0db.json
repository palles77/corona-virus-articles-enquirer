It is primarily associated with the clinical syndromes of bronchiolitis and pneumonia. hMPV may predispose to bacterial pneumonia; coinfection with respiratory syncytial virus may lead to increased severity of clinical disease, and complications include asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations. Given its high prevalence and potential clinical implications as these patients present to the Emergency Department with initial infection or subsequent complications, a better understanding of hMPV will aid in their care. We report the case of a 13-month old who developed lobar pneumonia 3 weeks after being diagnosed with hMPV. The epidemiology, clinical presentation, complications, and treatment of hMPV are then discussed.",

            "text": "Given that hMPV is a ubiquitous virus with widespread seroconversion by age 5 years, adult illness is presumed to be the result of re-infection. The presentation of hMPV in adults is quite similar to the symptoms seen in young children, with a few noteworthy exceptions. Unlike the pediatric presentation, fever is rarely present. Symptoms primarily involve the upper respiratory tract, with congestion, cough, and rhinorrhea being the most prevalent (1). The highest incidence of infection is found in young adults, yet the elderly patients with multiple comorbidities have the most clinically significant infections. Dypsnea, wheezing, and hypoxia are usually confined to the elderly and immunocompromised, who present with bronchitis or pneumonitis. In Rochester, New York, 11% of hospitalized adult patients with acute respiratory infections had an associated hMPV infection (1) . Exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) due to hMPV also contributes to the increased severity of illness in the elderly. Similar to other common viruses, hMPV infection may predispose the host to bacterial pneumonia. An increase in host susceptibility to pneumococcal infection due to infection with influenza virus, parainfluenza virus type 3, and RSV has been shown in animal and in vitro studies (16) . In African children without human immunodeficiency virus, Madhi et al. were able to decrease the incidence of hospitalization for pneumonia associated with influenza A virus by 39%, pneumonia associated with parainfluenza virus types 1-3 by 44%, and pneumonia associated with RSV by 32% by immunizing children with 9-valent pneumococcal polysaccharideprotein conjugate vaccine (PCV) (17) . These findings suggest that viral infections predispose to pneumococcal coinfection. Bacterial pneumonia coinfection with hMPV was first reported by Boivin et al. in two Canadian children hospitalized for acute respiratory illness. Isolated organisms were Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae (2) . Similar to their previous study with other viruses, Madhi et al. recently reported a 58% overall reduction in the incidence of pneumonia associated with hMPV by immunizing with PCV (18) . The authors suggest that this is \"a conservative estimate of the prevalence of pneumococcal coinfection in children with hMPV\" (18) .",

In addition to bacterial coinfection, simultaneous infection with RSV and hMPV may lead to increased severity of disease compared with either virus alone. In one series of patients admitted to the ICU with positive hMPV cultures, 75% were also positive for RSV (19) . hMPV may also be a significant inciting agent of asthma exacerbations. The incidence of acute asthma exacerbation after hMPV infection has been measured at 8 -14% (2, 3, 14, 20) . There also have been reports of detection of hMPV in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which adds this virus to the list of potentially lethal pathogens. However, a definitive correlation has yet to be established (3, 4, 21, 22) . Finally, a fatal case of encephalitis in an infant has also been reported (23) . Although these associations are in the preliminary stages, as testing for this virus becomes more readily accessible, the impact of hMPV on the ED is likely to be established.",
