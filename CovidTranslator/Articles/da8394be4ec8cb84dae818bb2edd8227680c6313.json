In a study by the National Acute Chest Syndrome Study group, 27 different infectious pathogens were identified in 671 episodes of ACS in 538 patients with sickle cell disease [1] . Chlamydophila pneumoniae was the most frequent, followed by Mycoplasma pneumoniae, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), coagulase-positive Stapyhylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Mycoplasma hominis, and parvovirus. C. pneumoniae [2, 3] , M. pneumoniae [4] , and influenza [5] , have been well recognized as pathogens associated with ACS in other studies. However, these studies did not use molecular methods of detection to study infections by human rhinovirus (HRV), human coronavirus (hCoV), human bocavirus (hBoV), human enterovirus (hEV), and human metapneumovirus (hMPV). HRV [6] and hCoV [7] infections are common in children, and associated with hospitalization for acute respiratory illness. However, little is known about the clinical impact of infections from these and other emerging respiratory viruses in children with sickle cell disease.",

Respiratory viruses were detected in 36 (77%) patients from October through March, and 11 (23%) patients from April through September (Fig. 1 ). There were 21, 10, and 5 patients with HRV, hBoV, and hCoV infections detected from October through March, compared to 8, 2, and 1 patients, respectively, from April through September. The difference was statistically significant for HRV (P=0.03) and hBoV (P=0.04) but not for hCoV (P=0.22). Influenza and RSV infections were only detected from October through March. PIV infections were detected year-round.",
