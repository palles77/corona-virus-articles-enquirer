We found a significant increase in the proliferation of splenocytes in the presence of thymol and it proved to be a good mitogen. Uptake capacity of macrophages was enhanced due to increased membrane fluidity after treatment with thymol and it also increases lysosomal activity of macrophages. Data of superoxide anion generation revealed the involvement of thymol in the generation of respiratory burst as it potentiated this property of macrophages at a concentration of 150 \u03bcM. In the case of TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u00df and PGE 2 a decreased level of secretion was observed 154 \u03c1g/ml, 736.1 \u03c1g/ml, and 151 \u03c1g/ml respectively when compared with lipopolysaccharide treated cells, where the level of these cytokines was significantly high. We also determined the anti-complementary activity of thymol which showed to be more effective than rosmarinic acid. Thus, the results obtained from the study suggest the potential role of thymol as a natural immunostimulatory drug which can be used in the treatment of various immunological disorders.",

The crucial thing about the immune system is its proper modulation. Any kind of alteration in the immune system either by activating or inhibiting its function is termed as immunomodulation. Those substances which have the potential to interact with immune system and are involved in the modulation of immune response i.e. stimulation or suppression are coined as immunomodulators [1, 2] . There are vast varieties of immunomodulators which includes natural compounds, some bacterial products, lymphokines and synthetic drugs. There are three targeting areas for a potent immunomodulator i.e. stimulation, suppression and restoration of the immune system. Unlike vaccine, most of the immunomodulatory agents are not real antigens but antigenomimetics or so called mitogens. Production of memory cells is not observed by immunomodulator because of its non-specific and non-antigenic properties. Due to this reason, the effect of immunomodulator agents is reduced after a short period of time [3] .",

A plant Thymus ciliates is found to have immense amount of thymol [7] . Most of the food and cosmetic industries use thymol as a preservative and antioxidant compound. Its protective nature against caries and plaques attracts the field of dental medicine. Thymol is a potent compound used to elicit the release of calcium from skeletal and smooth muscles to activate ryanodine receptors and suppress the transient outward K + and the L-type Ca 2+ current in mammalian ventricular cardiomyocytes. Release of the stored intracellular calcium in neural cells and potentiation of GABAA receptor properties of thymol has been reported. Recent studies reported on thymol demonstrate its activity as a \u03b11-adrenergic agonist in circular smooth muscle cells isolated from guinea pig stomach, which activates the transient receptor potential channel TRPV3 of the tongue and nasal epithelium and also inhibition of acetylcholinesterase activity in vitro. Its strong property of neutralizing COX1 activity or elastase released by neutrophils suggests its anti-inflammatory potential too [8] .",

Thereafter, cells were incubated for 48 h at 37\u00b0C in a humidified 5% CO 2 atmosphere, after the incubation period 20 \u03bcl of MTT per well was added and further incubated for 4 h. A total of 100 \u03bcl acidified isopropyl alcohol was added to the culture and homogenized for at least 10 min to fully dissolve the colored material. The absorbance at 570 nm was measured in an ELISA reader. The direct mitogenic effect of the compounds tested was expressed as Stimulation Index of mitogenic (SImit) = mean A570 test compound/mean A570 control, and the comitogenic effect was expressed as Stimulation Index of co-mitogenic (SIco-mit) = mean A570 (conA + thymol)/mean A570 con A. Each substance was tested minimally in at least three independent experiments. To examine the effect of the thymol on membrane fluidity of macrophages we used the RAW264.7 cell line. Assay was based on the neutral red uptake capacity of cells as described previously [9] , with some minor modifications. Briefly, RAW 264.7 cells (1 \u00d7 10 5 cells/well) with various concentrations of thymol as well as with PBS for control group were incubated in 96-well plates for 24 h at 37\u00b0C in a humidified 5% CO 2 incubator.

These organelles are intended to secrete proteins and deliver integral proteins to the cell surface and phagosomal membranes [16, 17] . These secretions include proteases, myeloperoxidase, lactoferrin, vitamin B 12 -binding protein and lysozymes [17, 18] . Macrophages possessing an acid phospholipase A 2 were reported earlier which was secreted in response to phagocytic stimuli such as zymogen [19] . We evaluated this crucial step in our experiment by using p-nitrophenyl phosphate (p-NPP) assay, and found a concentration dependent stimulation in lysosomal activity. At a low concentration of thymol (50 \u03bcM) significant stimulation index was recorded which increased by gradual increase in concentration.",

This phagosomal and plasma membrane-associated enzyme complex is normally in dormant state but rapidly get in action when cells are in contact with antigen or inflammatory stimuli [19, 20] to generate superoxide which is a precursor to numerous microbicidal oxidants, including hydrogen peroxide and myeloperoxidase-catalyzed formation of hypochlorous acid [21] . An alteration of superoxide generation or absence of these enzymes leads to formation of inflammatory granulomas which is a distinctive feature of chronic granulomatous diseases [21] . We determined this activity with the help of nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) chemiluminescence assay. As some of reactive oxygen intermediates have a very short time existence at high energy state, but the release of this energy is in the form of chemiluminescence which can be easily determine spectrophotometrically [22] . The results obtained from NBT test evidenced that even at a low concentration; thymol can potentiates this mechanism of macrophages which further we observed was increased in a concentration dependent manner. We hypothesized, that thymol is probably involved in the small GTP-binding protein i.e. Rac, which act as molecular switches through conformational changes between the GDP and GTP-bound forms. Rac-GTP binds to the membrane and to p67phox, and is required for NADPH oxidase activity [21] .",

They can impair the potency of macrophages which ultimately cause inflammatory disorders and among these factors cytokines are critical one. The network of cytokines and their signaling pathways have been well recognized in regulation of both innate and acquired immune responses [23] . One of the important cytokine which is involved in inflammation is tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1). TNF-\u03b1 can induce fever, either directly via stimulation of PGE 2 synthesis by the vascular endothelium of the hypothalamus, or indirectly by inducing release of IL-1 [23] . We determined that thymol possess a potency to alter the level of TNF-\u03b1 in a dose dependent pattern. A significantly decreased level of TNF-\u03b1 by thymol was observed at a concentration dependent manner when compared with LPS treated cells which indicates its anti-inflammatory property. Another important cytokines which is either stimulated by TNF-\u03b1 or directly activated and involved in inflammatory responses is IL-1\u00df a potent pro inflammatory cytokine which is engaged in various type of cellular function including proliferation, activation and differentiation [24] . Through induction of IL-8 and activation of neutrophils IL-1\u00df induces the chemotaxis of leukocytes [25] . Thus in the present study we determined the effect of thymol on release of IL-1\u00df, and found a decrease in its level as the concentration was increased of thymol, suggesting its involvement in signal transduction pathway essential for the production of IL-1\u00df.",

Synthesis of PGE 2 is dependent on two cyclooxygenase (COX) isoforms, COX-1 or COX-2, through conversion of arachidonic acid to PGH 2 [26, 27] . Expression of COX-1 is observed in most of the tissues to maintain homeostasis by producing PGE 2 [28] . An up-regulation of COX-2 is seen in the case of inflammatory condition, so it is believed to have a role on production of PGE 2 [29] . This was the reason why we concentrated to identify the possible role of thymol against PGE 2 . As we were expecting, we found a decrease in the production of PGE 2 by thymol in accordance with concentration. The reduction in the PGE 2 level by thymol is supposed to be due to its inhibitory effect on COX-2 [30] .",

We decided to evaluate anti complementary activity (classical pathway) of thymol which works on a principle of hemolysis of erythrocytes after binding with free complement. There was no significant difference between two initial concentrations but a significant percentage of complement inhibition was observed at highest concentration used. Data obtained from this experiment demonstrated the involvement of thymol in classical complement pathway which potentially inhibits its activation.",
