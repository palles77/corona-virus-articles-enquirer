The current approach to clinical management of MERS-CoV infection centers on general supportive care, with provision of critical care and organ support when necessary [2] . It has recently been suggested that administration of convalescent plasma or hyperimmune immunoglobulin will yield a clinical effect for treatment of MERS-CoV infection [3] . However, numerous uncertainties remain because the clinical course, viral replication kinetics, and host interactions are yet to be fully established [4] . Furthermore, the underlying evidence is based on studies of varying size and quality that describe clinical experience in treating other viral infections, including those due to SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Spanish influenza A(H1N1), avian influenza A(H5N1), and 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) (hereafter, \"influenza A[H1N1]pdm09\") [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] .",

Meta-analysis of crude CFRs, using a random-effects model, was undertaken. Statistical heterogeneity was ascertained using the I 2 statistic, and meta-analyses were abandoned when this reached 85% [16] . Sensitivity analyses were undertaken to investigate the impact of excluding studies with \u22645 patients in the exposed group.

Four studies reported outcomes for 29 patients infected with avian influenza A(H5N1) [23, 26, 27, 36] , 4 studies reported outcomes for 104 patients infected with influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 [24, 30, 37, 48] , and 8 studies reported outcomes for 214 patients with SARS [8, 25, 28, 29, 31, 32, 45, 46] . The clinical status of patients at the time of treatment administration varied, as did concomitant treatments and comorbidities. Convalescent plasma was used in all observational studies of SARS-CoV, influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, and avian influenza A(H5N1) infections (Supplementary Table 2 ). For Spanish influenza A(H1N1) infection, 2 observational studies used convalescent plasma, and 11 used convalescent serum (Supplementary Table 2 ).

Figure 2 summarizes the risk of bias assessments for 44 outcomes from 25 observational studies. Studies reported outcomes that were either at moderate risk (11 outcomes) or moderate to high risk of selection bias (33 outcomes). The majority of studies lacked a comparator group, and 28 studies were at high or very high risk of reporting bias. This suggests that the observational study data included are at moderate to high risk of bias.",

Table 3 summarizes our narrative synthesis, and Supplementary  Table 3 shows results of the individual studies that included an all-cause mortality outcome. Meta-analyses, sensitivity analyses, and assessments of publication bias, by viral etiology, proved unfeasible due to a paucity of suitable data. There were no data available to address study questions relating to organ failure and sepsis or to hospital readmission and recurrence of severe disease. Table 3 and Supplementary 3 summarize 8 observational studies at moderate to high risk of bias that reported improved mortality after patients received various doses of convalescent plasma [8, 25, 28, 29, 31, 32, 45, 46] . A retrospective case-comparison study showed a CFR reduction after plasma treatment that reached statistical significance (absolute reduction in CFR, 23%; 95% CI, 6%-42%; P = .049) [46] . A second study with a comparator group described a cluster of 29 cases of SARS-CoV infection in which 1 patient received convalescent plasma and survived (absolute reduction in CFR, 7%; 95% CI, \u22122% to 17%; P = .93) [32, 49] . Three small studies reported treatment of 5 patients with no deaths, and a case series by Cheng et al reported a CFR of 12.5% (10 of 80 patients) following treatment (Supplementary Table 3 ) [8, 9, 25, 28, 31, 45, 50] . Within this series, a subgroup analysis of 30 patients found that those treated when PCR-positive but seronegative for SARS-CoV were more likely to be discharged within 22 days of admission than those who were seropositive at the time of plasma infusion (67% vs 20%; P = .001). A further subgroup analysis of 48 patients found that receipt of convalescent plasma treatment <14 days after onset of symptoms improved the likelihood of discharge within 22 days of admission (58% vs 16%; P < .001); this remained significant after adjustment for age, viral status, time of administration, and lactate dehydrogenase level, suggesting that early treatment with convalescent plasma may be beneficial. However, allocation of treatment was mostly based on the physician's decision and the availability of plasma, and this study was at high risk of bias.",

Univariate analysis showed a significant absolute reduction in CFR of 35% (95% CI, 14%-56%; P = .01) after treatment. Multivariable analysis also showed a significant reduction in the relative risk of mortality (OR, 0.20; 95% CI, .06-.69; P = .011), although the factors adjusted for were not clearly stated. Both groups received other treatments, such as neuraminidase inhibitors and steroids (Supplementary Table 2 ). This nonrandomized study was at moderate risk of bias.

Of the 6 studies included in the meta-analysis, 2 reported use of convalescent whole blood; however, these studies only contributed 84 patients (25%) in the treatment group. When timing of treatment was recorded, patients who received early treatment (<4 days from pneumonia onset) had a CFR of 19% (28 of 148), compared with 59% (49 of 83) for those treated later [21] . Only 2 studies of convalescent serum reported a comparator group [38, 47] . Both reported absolute reductions in CFR after treatment, with a reduction of 19% (95% CI, 11%-48%) in one and 22% (95% CI, 11%-32%) in the other; the reduction in the latter reached statistical significance (P = .008). The remaining studies observed a CFR ranging from 0% (0 of 2) to 48% (12 of 25) after treatment (Supplementary Table 3) . A significant absolute reduction in the CFR was observed in a case series of 157 cases, 46 of whom received convalescent plasma (absolute reduction in the CFR, 18%; 95% CI, 8% to 30%; P = .0075) [33] .

A recent multicenter, prospective, double-blind, randomized control trial compared the use of hyperimmune immunoglobulin (derived from influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 convalescent plasma) to intravenous immunoglobulin manufactured before the 2009 pandemic [5] . For 22 patients from this study who received treatment within 5 days of symptom onset and were excluded per protocol, a multivariate subgroup analysis demonstrated that hyperimmune immunoglobulin had a protective effect (OR, 0.14; 95% CI, .02-.92) [5] . Evidence from studies of SARS-CoV infection [31] and Spanish influenza A(H1N1) infection [21] showed a survival benefit following convalescent plasma treatment within 14 days and 4 days of symptom onset, respectively. These findings suggest that early initiation of treatment may be of critical importance to reducing mortality in patients with SARI of viral etiology.",

Observational studies were predominately case reports or series, had no control groups, and had a moderate to high risk of bias. Findings were commonly at high risk of confounding by indication. Although selection or reporting bias may favor the intervention, recruiting patients who are clinically deteriorating or moribund would bias the result in the opposite direction. Adequate methodological or statistical measures were infrequently used to control bias and confounding, and we identified numerous sources of clinical and methodological heterogeneity. We cannot be assured that all Spanish influenza A(H1N1) infection studies were included since our protocol did not include hand searching of literature from 1918-1920. Although our post hoc metaanalyses were undertaken to help inform clinical decision making, the theoretical rationale for pooling mortality data from different viral etiologies remains to be fully established. The results obtained must be considered experimental and interpreted with an appropriate level of caution.",

The evidence for a reduction in mortality associated with convalescent plasma is strongest for SARS and influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 infection. Although it is clinically rational to consider novel therapies for critically ill patients, there is evidence that maximum benefit from convalescent plasma might be realized through early initiation of therapy. However, many treatment protocols currently mention convalescent plasma as a treatment of last resort. If this treatment is considered for MERS-CoV-infected patients with SARI, it should ideally only be administered in acute centers able to manage potential treatment-related complications, such as transfusionrelated acute lung injury. We consider this a precautionary approach because of the limited clinical experience of administering convalescent plasma to this patient group.",

This would help clarify the potential benefits and harms of treatment, identify optimal dosage, and ascertain whether repeated treatments are relevant factors for clinical practice. Randomized controlled trials or observational studies that adopt a standardized minimum data set are needed to better evaluate convalescent plasma as a therapeutic option for MERS-CoV infection before it can be fully recommended or before refinements can be made over its current use, other than our current recommendation for early use. The WHO and the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium are currently developing a clinical trial protocol to investigate the effectiveness of passive immunotherapy for patients with SARI.",
