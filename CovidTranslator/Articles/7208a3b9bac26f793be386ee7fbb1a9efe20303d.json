            "text": "The Dioctophyma renale (Goeze, 1782 ) is a worldwide occurring nematode, known as giant kidney worm. It is the largest parasite nematode infecting domestic animals. Parasitism by this nematode has been described in different animal species, including in humans. Among the domestic species, it affects especially dogs, but it has been also observed in felines, swine, horses and cattle (Beaver and Theis, 1979; Kommers et al., 1999; Urquhart et al., 1998; Verocai et al., 2009) . In Brazilian wild animals the parasitism was observed in coati (Nasua nasua), little grison (Galictis cuja), maned wolf (Chrysocyon brachyurus), bush dog (Speothos venaticus) and two-toed sloth (Choloepus didactylus) (Ribeiro et al., 2009) . Vermins are ovipare and the female can reach more than 60 cm length and 1 cm diameter. The prepatent period for Dioctophyma is approximately 155 days and the entire life cycle can take up to two years to complete (Dyer, 1998; Measures and Anderson, 1985; Senior, 1980) . Transmission of this parasite involves eggs being passed in the urine of the infected definite host. Eggs develop in the aquatic environment and are then ingested by the intermediate host, an aquatic oligochaete annelids (mud-worm), where the development of the first and second stages larva occurs. From this stage on, more than one route of transmission has been reported. In the first of them, maturation to third and fourth stages larva may occur within the annelid, which is then directly infective to mammal hosts; in the second route, an annelid containing a second stage larva may be ingested by a fish, or a frog, where the larva encysts in tissue and develops into third and fourth stages. In the third route, the infected annelid parasitic on crayfish (Cambarus spp.) may be ingested together with the crayfish by fish or frogs. As a result of these possible modes of transmission, some investigators consider fish or frogs as transporters rather than true intermediate hosts (Dyer, 1998) . All routes of transmission converge on the mammal host. In the definitive hosts, the dioctophymas larva A B S T R A C T This study reports a case of parasitism by the giant kidney worm, Dioctophyma renale, diagnosed in the right kidney of a domestic dog. An adult female German Shepherd was attended with clinical history of prostration and hyporexia. The hemogram showed changes compatible with an inflammatory process, for that reason, an abdominal ultrasound was requested. Ultrasound image suggested the presence of D. renale in the right kidney. The diagnosis was confirmed after urinalysis due to the presence of dioctophymas ova in the urinary sediment. Surgical treatment was made and the animal had an excellent recovery after the nephrectomy was performed. Generally, in almost all cases, parasitism by D. renale in domestic dogs is a necropsy finding, nevertheless imaging techniques as sonography and laboratorial exams as urinalysis have been proven to be important tools to achieve diagnosis. The purpose of this study is to report a case of parasitism by D. renale where diagnosis and treatment were made in time to allow the patient's recovery.",

This way, the adult nematode is commonly found in the renal pelvis, but has been seen encysted within the abdominal cavity, the uterus, ovary, mammary gland, urethra, subcutaneous tissues of the inguinal region and mesenteric lymph nodes. In dogs, the nematode has been more frequently observed in the kidney or free in the abdominal cavity (Georgi and Georgi, 1991; Nakagawa et al., 2007) . Usually, just one of the kidneys is affected, the right kidney more often than the left one, due to its anatomic proximity to the duodenum. Affected animals may demonstrate compressive atrophy of the renal parenchyma, dilation of the renal pelvis and ureteral obstruction, but the main lesion is the progressive destruction of the renal parenchyma leaving only a thin capsule containing the worm and hemorrhagic exudates inside (Nakagawa et al., 2007; Soler et al., 2008; Urquhart et al., 1998) .",

The diagnosis of dioctophymatosis can also be confirmed by the observation of the D. renale ova in the urine.

Some authors recommend surgical treatment with nephrectomy, when just one kidney is affected, and nephrotomy, when both kidneys are affected (Birchard and Sherding, 1994) . Nevertheless, there are also authors that recommend performing an intravenous pyelography in order to estimate the magnitude of the residual function in the affected kidney, before opting for surgical treatment.

Both dogs were fed with commercial dog food, vaccinated with anti-rabies vaccine and V10 (vaccine against Hepatitis, Distemper virus, Parvovirus type 2, Parainfluenza, Leptospirosis, Coronavirus, Adenovirus) and received profilactic treatment for ixodidiosis, with fipronil, each three months, whereas the non-defined breed already presented a picture of hemoparasitosis.",

The hemogram showed leucocytosis by neutrophilia with left shift toxic granulation neutrophils, lymphopenia, eosinophilia and basophilia (Table 1) . The animal's renal function was normal with creatinine values of 0.94 mg/dl (reference value: 0.8-1.8 mg/dl) and urea of 26.6 mg/dl (reference value: 15-40 mg/dl). At the initial treatment, enrofloxacine dose of 5 mg/kg each 12 h and dipiron sodium 25 mg/kg each 8 h was prescribed. An ultrasound exam to evaluate the abdominal organs was requested, whereas the hemogram suggested an active inflammatory process. Two days after the initial admission, the animal returned to the clinic for accomplishing this exam. The dog presented no fever, although prostration. The exam revealed an uncharacteristic presented right kidney and on its topography a ring-like structure involved by a thin hypercogenic capsule of 5.64 cm in diameter in transversal image could be observed (Fig. 1 ) and left kidney with normal topography (Fig. 2) . The ultrasound findings suggested parasitism by D. renale. Urinalysis confirmed the diagnosis by the presence of parasite ova in the urine (Fig. 3) . Treatment was surgical. The patient's right kidney was removed (Fig. 4) . This kidney was enlarged due to the presence of 3 parasites inside the renal capsule, with lengths of 52 cm, 53 cm and 57 cm respectively. The kidney's parenchyma was totally destroyed and only the renal capsule with the nematodes and hemorrhagic exudates inside could be found (Figs. 5-7) . The animal presented excellent surgical recovery and was released one week after surgery.",

However, it is important to remark, that the eggs will only appear in the urine sediment, if a gravid parasite female is in the kidney causing the infection (Soler et al., 2008) . This patient was submitted to nephrectomy and 3 parasites were found inside the right kidney. The dog's clinical signs were associated to the parasitic infection, since the patient's recovery was excellent with significant improvement of the clinical condition after removal of the affected kidney. For the same reason, additional blood tests were not performed. The animal was released after removing the cutaneous surgical wound stitches. In this case, the prognosis was favorable, due to the unilateral parasite localization. Sometimes, the D. renale finds itself free in the abdominal cavity causing a process of peritonitis, or even parasiting both kidneys of one animal. In such cases it is necessary to perform an exploratory laparotomy or nephrotomy to remove the parasites (Birchard and Sherding, 1994) .",
