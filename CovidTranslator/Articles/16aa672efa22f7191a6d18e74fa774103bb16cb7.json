            "text": "To study the role of the precursor to the membrane protein (prM) in flavivirus maturation, we inhibited the proteolytic processing of the Murray Valley encephalitis (MVE) virus prM to membrane protein in infected cells by adding the acidotropic agent ammonium chloride late in the virus replication cycle. Viruses purified from supernatants of ammonium chloride-treated cells contained prM protein and were unable to fuse C6/36 mosquito cells from without. When ammonium chloride was removed from the cells, both the processing of prM and the fusion activity of the purified viruses were partially restored. By using monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) specific for the envelope (E) glycoprotein of MVE virus, we found that at least three epitopes were less accessible to their corresponding antibodies in the prM-containing MVE virus particles. Amino-terminal sequencing of proteolytic fragments of the E protein which were reactive with sequence-specific peptide antisera or MAb enabled us to estimate the site of the E protein interacting with the prM to be within amino acids 200 to 327. Since prM-containing viruses were up to 400-fold more resistant to a low pH environment, we conclude that the E-prM interaction might be necessary to protect the E protein from irreversible conformational changes caused by maturation into the acidic vesicles of the exocytic pathway.",

            "text": "For enveloped viruses to enter into their target cells, virus-cell membrane fusion must take place to release the nucleocapsid into the cytoplasm. This occurs either directly at the plasma membrane, as with paramyxoviruses and herpesviruses, or in the endosomal vesicles after the viruses are taken up by receptor-mediated endocytosis, as with togaviruses and orthomyxoviruses (for review see Marsh and Helenius, 1989) . Generally the fusion-mediating envelope proteins are activated by proteolytic cleavage of the spike precursor proteins by a host protease late during virus assembly. Cleavage activation of the glycoproteins involved in fusion has been demonstrated with the gPE2 of murine coronaviruses (Sturman and Holmes, 1984; Sturman et al., 1985) the HA of influenza viruses (Wiley and Skehel, 1987 ) the gP160 of retroviruses (McCune et al., 1988; Willey et al., 1991) and the PE2 of alphaviruses (Lobigs and Garoff, 1990; Lobigs et a/., 1990; White et al., 1983) . The cleaved glycoprotein (e.g., HA) undergoes an irreversible conformational change in the acidic pH milieu of the endocytic vesicles which exposes a hydrophobic fusion site that mediates the virus-cell membrane fusion. This cleavage of the precursor protein is essential for virus infectivity but not particle formation. A Semliki Forest virus (SFV) mutant defective in PE2 cleavage expressed PE2 at the cell ' To whom reprint requests should be addressed.",

            "text": "Murray Valley encephalitis (MVE) virus is a member of the Flaviviridae, a family of small, positive-strand RNA viruses. The mature flavivirions contain three structural proteins: capsid (C), membrane (M), and envelope (E), with molecular masses of 14-15, 7-8, and 50-60 kDa, respectively. The E protein is the only structural protein responsible for the induction of neutralizing, hemagglutination-inhibiting, and protective antibodies, it is the receptor-binding protein and is also involved in acid-catalyzed membrane fusion (Heinz and Roehrig, 1990; Guirakhoo et al., 1991) . Little is known about the function of the M protein. The M protein is cleaved from its precursor protein (prM) after the consensus sequence R-X-R/K-R shortly before or after virus release Westaway, 1987) . This cleavage is associated with a rearrangement of the oligomeric structures on the surface of the virion (Wengler and Wengler, 1989) . By using monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) and protease maps, we previously demonstrated that the E glycoprotein of tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) virus undergoes an irreversible conformational change, predominantly in the epitopes of domain A, at mildly acidic pH . Consistent with this, purified TBE virus demonstrated fusion from without (FFWO) of the mosquito cell line C6/36 only after exposure of cell-bound virus to low pH. The FFWO was abolished if the processing of prM to M was interrupted using the acidotropic agent ammonium chloride (Guirakhoo et a/., 1991) .",

Cells were infected with MVE virus (strain Ord River) at a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 10 in D-MEM with 29/o FCS. Ammonium chloride (25 m/M) was added at 48 hr postinfection (p.i.) and the viruses were harvested on Day 6. At this time, ammonium chloride-containing medium was replaced with D-MEM, 2% FCS, without ammonium chloride, and the viruses were reharvested on Day 9 p.i. Viruses were precipitated with 8% polyethylene glycol 8000 (Fisher Scientific, Fair Lawn, NJ), purified by two cycles of glycerol-tartrate gradients (Obijeski et al., 1976) , and resuspended in 0.3 ml of D-MEM. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Richmond, CA). Untreated MVE viruses (without ammonium chloride) were propagated and purified as described above and were used as positive controls in all experiments. For the acid resistance experiments (see below) MVE viruses were also grown in SW1 3 mammalian cells in the presence or absence of ammonium chloride. To quantify the amount of viral structural proteins in each propagation, the purified viruses were subjected to SDS-PAGE on 12.5% acryamide gels (Laemmli, 1970) and proteins were stained using a rapid silver stain kit (ICN, Cleveland, OH) according to the manufacturer's protocols. Gels were scanned by a microprocessor-controled spectrophotometer (Gilford System 2600) and the peaks corresponding to each viral protein were identified and integrated to determine areas under the peaks, and the area ratios of prM to E were calculated.",

For the proteolytic digestion of the predenatured virus, 60 pg of purified MVE virus in D-MEM was precipitated in 60% TCA (end concentration 12%) on an ice bath for 30 min, washed with cold acetone, and resuspended in 50 ~1 0.125 M Tris, pH 6.8, containing 0.5% SDS and 10% glycerol.

After addition of SDS and 2-mercaptoethanol (final concentrations 4%) the samples were boiled and separated on 12.5% SDS gels.

Ammonium chloride has been shown to accumulate in the post-Golgi acidic vesicles and interrupt the processing of prM to M protein (Randolph eta/., 1990) . The unprocessed prM protein was incorporated into the released viruses grown in the presence of ammonium chloride at 6 days p.i. (Fig. 1 A, lane 2) . When ammonium chloride was removed, the cells partially recovered, and the normal processing of the prM to M resumed (Fig. lA,  lane 3) . Since some unprocessed prM proteins were also found in MVE-infected cells in the absence of ammonium chloride ( Fig. 1 A, lane l) , we attempted to quantify the amount of prM in each sample. This was achieved by scanning the stained viral proteins following separation by SDS-PAGE. By using nonradioactive viruses it was not always possible to clearly demonstrate the presence of the small M protein in minigels. The fact that the ratios of the viral structural proteins in the absence of ammonium chloride remain constant enabled us to evaluate the amount of prM processing indirectly by calculating its ratio to other structural proteins (E or C) which are more abundant in virions. The ratio of the area of each peak corresponding to C or prM proteins to E as well as prM to C protein was calculated. The ratio of C to E protein remained constant in the presence or absence of ammonium chloride (data not shown) whereas the ratio of prM to E protein was significantly increased in the presence of ammonium chloride (from 0.15 to 0.86) and reduced to 0.55 following removal of ammonium chloride (Fig. 1A) . Similar results were obtained when the ratio of prM to C was calculated (data not shown). These data confirm that partial recovery of prM processing has occurred once the ammonium chloride has been removed.",

The antigenicity of the prM-and M-containing virus supernatants was equivalent in end-point ELISA antigen titration using a 1:500 dilution of polyclonal rabbit anti-MVE virus capture sera and anti-MVE virus mouse hyperimmune ascitic fluid (HIAF) as detector. Therefore, a 1:5 dilution of each supernatant was used in subsequent epitope mapping with MAbs. The equivalent antigenicity was confirmed by end-point ELISA titration of the MVE HIAF in the standardized capture assay (Fig. 2B) .

As can be seen neither the E-4b nor E-6 MAbs recognized the E protein in its re- duced form (treated with 2-mercaptoethanol), whereas E-8 Mab was still reactive after protein reduction. This reactivity was further sustained after the reduction and alkylation of the cysteine residues of the E glycoprotein using DlT/SDS followed by iodoacetamide treatment (Johnson et a/., 1990) (data not shown). Since the reactivity of the E-8 MAb was reduced with prM-containing viruses and the fact that it could recognize the E protein in immunoblots in its linear conformation, we attempted to obtain more information about the site involved in prM-E interaction by identifying the E-8 binding site. The proteolytic digestion of the native E protein with trypsin (which cleaves after K or R) or V8 endoproteinase (which cleaves after E or D) did not produce fragments smaller than 30 kDa that were reactive with E-8 MAb (Fig. 4B) . In order to produce smaller fragment reactive with the E-8 MAb, the MVE virus was denatured by SDS prior to protease digestion. Using chymotrypsin (which cleaves after F, T, or Y) or V8 protease, 20-and 22-kDa fragments, Fr 20 and Fr 22, were identified, respectively. These two fragments, which reacted with E-8 MAb, were also recog-nized by mouse antiserum immunized with synthetic peptide MVE 06 (Figs. 4C and 4D). A 23-kDa fragment, Fr 23, and a 19-kDa fragment, Fr 19, were produced using V8 or chymotrypsin, respectively, which were recognized by MVE 04 antibodies but not by MVE 06 antibodies or E-8 MAb. Antisera prepared against MVE 17 also recognized a V8 fragment of 16 kDa Fr 16 (Fig.  4D ). Fr 23, 22, 16, and 14 were sequenced at their amino-terminal ends and the results are shown in Ta (Dalgarno et a/., 1986) predict only one potential Nlinked glycosylation site on the E protein at position N-l 54 and the fact that this site might contain carbohydrate of the complex type (endo H resistant) (Winkler Because it has been shown with West Nile virus that the E and prM glycoproteins remain as heterodimers during transport and maturation through acidic compartments of the exocytic route (Wengler and Wengler, 1989) , we compared the infectivity of the prM-containing MVE virus with that of the M-containing MVE virus following virus exposure to acidic conditions. Equal PFUs of the prM-and M-virus containing supernatants from C6/36 or SW1 3 cells were subjected to environments of different pH values and their resultant infectivity in a plaque assay was examined (Fig. 6) . No significant difference in infectivity of either virus preparation was observed after the incubation of viruses at pH values between 7.5 and 6.5. Upon incubation at pH 6.0, the infectivity of both M-containing viruses (grown in C6/36 or SW1 3 cells) was drastically abolished; however, this loss of infectivity was less dramatic for prMcontaining viruses than for M-containing viruses (150fold loss versus 1360-fold loss for viruses grown in C6/ 36 cells, Fig. 6A tion 199) or Fr 16 (starting at position 327), we predict its binding site to be between amino acids 200 and 327 on the E glycoprotein (Fig. 5) .",

Recently, an enzyme designated paired basic amino acid cleaving enzyme (PACE) has been cloned and purified from a human liver cell line (Wise et al., 1990) . A similar endoprotease was also isolated from the trans-Golgi membranes of rat liver cells, which was shown to cleave in vitro the F, protein of New Castle disease virus after a dibasic residue motif (Sakaguchi et al., 199 1) . We believe that the late maturational processing of prM at the R-X-R/K-R cleavage motif is the mechanism used to activate the flavivirus fusion protein (E glycoprotein). The infectivity of prM-containing viruses (grown in C6/36 cells) for mammalian cells was lo-fold lower than that of the mature MVE (M-containing) viruses, although the amount of antigen detected by polyclonal antibodies was similar for both viruses. These results indicate that prM processing is required for full virus infectivity. A similar observation has been made with West Nile (WN) virus in which the ratio of physical particles to PFU was about 600 for the fully infectious extracellular (M-containing) viruses and was about 60-fold higher for the cell-associated (prM-containing) viruses (Wengler and Wengler, 1989) .",

            "text": "Upon subsequent infection and endocytosis, the E glycoprotein probably undergoes a conformational change in the acidic environment of endocytic vesicles, which results in membrane fusion and release of the nucleocapsid into the cytoplasm. Consistent with this hypothesis are our previous findings that the E glycoprotein of TBE virus undergoes irreversible conformational changes at pH less than 6.2. These changes, which predominantly occur in the A-domain epitopes and the i2 site Mandl et al., 1989) , are probably necessary to trigger the fusion activity of the E glycoprotein. It has been shown that the fusion activity of the TBE virus can be blocked effectively by three MAbs, two of which were specific for epitopes of the A-domain, and one recognized the i2 epitope (Guirakhoo et al., 1991) . The A-domain contains an amino acid sequence (G L F G) that is conserved in the fusion sequences of other enveloped viruses. We have also observed with dengue virus that the region containing the conservative fusion sequence is more accessible to antipeptide antibodies following low pH treatment . By using MAbs specific for MVE virus E glycoprotein in a capture ELISA, we demonstrated that if the processing of prM was interrupted at least three of these epitopes on the E glycoprotein were less accessible on the virus particle. The observation that all of the epitopes were acid sensitive indicates that they are probably located in the A-domain. The sensitivity of the HIAF to low pH also suggests that these epitopes are the predominant epitopes recognized following immunization with intact virus. It may be significant that these three epitopes are associated with hemagglutination of red blood cells. At least one of these epitopes (E-8) also elicits virus-neutralizing antibodies. Since other functionally important epitopes which induce neutralizing, hemagglutinationinhibiting, and protective antibodies (Hawkes et a/., 1988) are still present in the prM-containing viruses (Fig. 2 A) , and the fact that these viruses are still capable of binding to and infecting their host cells, we did not expect that the fusion peptide or the receptorbinding sites would be directly involved in the prM-E interactions. This was confirmed when the immunereactive fragments generated by V8 protease were sequenced. It was shown that predominantly three sites on the E glycoprotein were exposed to the proteolytic attack of the V8 enzyme. This cleavage, which occurred on positions 138, 199, and 326, generated four fragments reactive with sequence-specific antipeptide antibody or E-8 MAb. Similar segments on the E pro-tein of WN virus, which are located in Ll and R3, have also been shown to be exposed to proteolytic attack (Wengler er a/., 1987) . Combining results of the reactivity pattern of the antipeptide antibodies with proteolytic fragments and also information obtained from N-terminal sequence analysis of the immune fragments, we were able to map the binding site of the E-8 MAb which was covered or dissociated by the presence of prM. This site which reside between amino acids 200 and 327 on the E protein includes more than 80% of the R2 domain proposed for WN (Nowak and Wengier, 1987) and MVE (Roehrig et a/., 1989) viruses. No actual biological function of the R2 domain had been previously identified. It is noteworthy that the synthetic peptide MVE 06, which consists of 21 amino acids within the R2 domain (230-251), was cross-reactive with other members of the flaviviruses (Roehrig et al., 1989) , indicating the biological importance of this region.",

            "text": "Several studies have indicated that when influenza A virus and Semliki Forest virus were incubated at low pH they became irreversibly inactivated (Doms et a/., 1985; Kielian and Helenius 1985; Stegman eta/., 1989; White et a/., 1982) . This is probably due to exposure and self-aggregation of the hydrophobic fusion peptide which, therefore, can no longer interact with target membranes (Nir et al., 1990) . If the flavivirus E glycoprotein were not protected during transport to the cell surface, the acidic milieu of the post-Golgi vesicles could inactivate it. Because it has been shown with WN virus that the E and prM proteins remain as heterodimers during exocytosis (Wengler and Wengler, 1989) we reasoned that the function of the prM is to prevent conformational changes in the E glycoprotein at low pH, thus assuring safe transport of these proteins through post-Golgi acidic vesicles during maturation until the virions are released. A similar role has also been proposed for the PE2 of alphaviruses, which forms a stable dimer with the El protein (critical for infection and fusion) in the acidic compartment of the exocytic route (Lobigs and Garoff, 1990; Presley et a/., 1991; Wahlberg et al., 1989) . Different approaches might be utilized by other viruses to secure the authentic expression of the envelope proteins on the infected cells. It has been shown that the M2 protein of influ-enza virus raises the pH of the post-Golgi vesicles by about 0.8 unit, thus preventing the expression of the low pH conformation of the HA molecules on the plasma membranes of the infected cells (Ciampor et a/., 1992) . The high resistance of the prM-containing viruses to low pH might indicate that the prM could shield some segments of the E protein which are otherwise protonated in a low pH environment, leading to the exposure of the fusion peptide and consequent loss of infectivity. Concomitant with the low pH sensitivity of the M-containing viruses was a loss of epitope reactivity in ELISA following incubation at pH 6.0 or below. Because prM-containing viruses are still infectious, apparently the prM protein can be cleaved after the virus has undergone endocytosis. Using chymotrypsin, trypsin, and thermolysin it was demonstrated that the prM protein of the WN virus is highly sensitive to proteases . In our laboratory we also observed that by using a low concentration of trypsin, the prM protein of the MVE virus is cleaved prior to the E protein (data not shown).",
