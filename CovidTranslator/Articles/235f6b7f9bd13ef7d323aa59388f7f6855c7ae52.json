Most attempts at neuronal grafting have been performed with inbred strains of rodents or in other donor-host combinations with few transplantation antigen differences, thus avoiding complex immunological reactions.

Indeed, results from some clinical trials involving transplantation to the brains of PD patients have already been published'.'443151 with several more studies underway. In these trials the graft tissue was not neuronal in origin, but consisted of endocrine catecholamine-producing cells of the adrenal medulla from the patients themselves (autologous grafts, see Table I ). In addition to the published cases, to our knowledge at least 150 more patients have undergone surgical procedures with autologous adrenal medullary tissue. Whereas the autografting procedure avoids the problem of immunological rejection, studies in experimental animals have indicated that the adrenal medulla grafts do not possess the same functional capacity as neuronal grafts containing DA neurons79*145,182*236. Therefore, it is of interest to seek a source for neuronal donor tissue for grafting to PD patients and also for other neurological diseases where there are no other tissues available that can substitute for the neurotransmitters lost in the disease process. The intraparench~al grafting of DA neurons to the adult brain seems to require that the donor tissue is fetal or immature for good survival to occur16 '30.35 . The most suitable donor tissue for grafting in PD patients may thus consist of immature mesencephalic DA neurons from aborted human fetuses. Inevitably, such tissue will be immunologically incompatible with the PD patients, and therefore it is clear that an understanding of the immunology of the brain will become increasingly important in the future.",

Although several studies have shown that immunologically incompatible tissue can survive grafting to the brain, little is known about the laws governing graft survival under these conditions. We will discuss the possible underlying reasons for the immunological privilege of the brain, the limitations of the privileged site, the likely sequence of cellular events after the entry of allo/xenogeneic tissue into the brain, the use of immunosuppression to prevent graft rejection, and finally present a hypothesis on how the immune reactions are regulated within the brain tissue.",

Furthermore, good intraparenchymal graft survival requires that the transplants should be rapidly vascularized by the host which limits the size of the grafted piece.

Class I and II are cell surface glycoproteins, which display a high degree of polymorphism, i.e. interindi~dual differences. They serve as guidance and recognition molecules in the immune system. Class III molecules have a low degree of polymorphism and are found in the blood as complement factors. Strong transplantation antigens are the MHC class I and II gene products. Class I MHC molecules form complexes with the non-variable /3* microglobulin. In the mouse MHC there are other class I structures with little or no polymo~hism and which have hitherto been considered to play minor roles in the regulation of immune reactions. These molecules are encoded in the MHC regions called Tla (18 genes in the mouse) and Qa (8 genes in the mouse).

The proliferation of host helper T-cells can be greatly enhanced if IL-l is produced by donor-derived antigen presenting cells, so called 'passenger leukocytes'. These cells are not only capable of producing IL-l, but also possess high levels of MHC class I and II and are thought to be the strongest stimulus of a rejection process133,153,221. A likely mode of activation of the immune system in an allograft situation is summarized in Fig. 3 . donor antigen-presenting cells can pick up foreign antigens that, once presented, can cause a graft rejection ( Fig. 2) . The antigen-presenting cells may be located in the graft-bearing tissue (resident antigenpresenting cells) or in lymphatic tissues that drain the grafted area. In order to reach lymphatic tissues, graft antigens either flow in a free fluid phase to the regional lymphatic tissue, or bind to resident antigenpresenting cells that in turn migrate to a regional lymphatic tissue. Here the antigens are associated with the host MHC class I and II antigens, possibly after antigen processing. They are also presented to lymphocytes. It has been proposed that some non-MHC transplantation antigens may not have to be processed in order to cause rejection, whereas other minor transplantation antigens do require process- In a xenograft combination, the immunological reactions are not necessarily dominated by anti-MHC reactivity, although it is likely that it is an important antigenic stimulus. In support of MHC reactivity in xenografts Sachs et al.'\"' have found antibodies reactive with species-specific MHC epitopes and also strain-specific MHC epitopes in rats immunized with mouse cells. However, it is also conceivable that the non-MHC antigens may play a more important role in xenografting than in allografting in determining graft survival. Empirical data have shown that the survival time of xenografts is often, but not always, relatively short. Apart from strains with immunodeficiencies, all mammalian species have a complete graft rejection capacity. However, in certain host-recipient combinations there may be a variation in graft survival time depending on the actual combination made107*'\"\". A graft between the strains A to B may survive a long time, whereas a graft from B grafted onto A may survive a shorter time. However, these cases are rare, and occur in inbred strains only. In outbred strains, this paradigm does not apply and the rejection capacity is usually intact, unless the animals have other compromising diseases. Transplantation laws are summarized in Table V .",

In 1907, Del Contess grafted a variety of non-neurunal fetal tissues to the cerebral cortex of adult dogs with some minor success. However, at best he found that there was only partial survival of certain types of tissue and he concluded that the brain was an unfavorable site for im- plantation of most types of fetal tissue. In 1913 came, to our knowledge, the first report of successful intracerebral grafting of an allogeneic tumor, thus identifying the brain as a suitable site for the study of transplants (study mentioned in ref. 67 ). Since then, many reports have been published reporting that allogeneic and xenogeneic tumors can grow in the brain (e.g. refs. 67, 92, 93, 94, 103, 146, 164, 209, 210, 219) .

All the cells in the body that expressed the LCM viral antigens in association with the MHC were killed within two weeks.

With an increased understanding of the factors underlying the regulation of the immunological response in grafting in the brain across immunological barriers it would perhaps be possible to interfere with these steps and in a relatively mild way ensure prolonged graft survival. ultimately also in a clinical setting.
