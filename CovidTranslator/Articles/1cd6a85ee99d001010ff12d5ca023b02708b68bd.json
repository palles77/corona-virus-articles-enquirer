            "text": "Coronaviruses devote more than three quarters of their coding capacity to encode two large polyproteins (1a and 1ab polyproteins), which are proteolytically processed into 15-16 mature, nonstructural replicase proteins (nsp1 to 16). These cleavage products are believed to play essential roles in replication of the giant RNA genome of \u223c 30 kb and transcription of a nested set of 5 to 9 subgenomic RNA species by a unique discontinuous transcription mechanism. In this report, one of these replicase proteins, nsp9 of the coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is systematically studied using both biochemical and reverse genetic approaches. The results showed that substitution mutation of a conserved Gly (G98) residue in the C-terminal \u03b1-helix domain with an Asp greatly destabilized the IBV nsp9 homodimer and abolished its RNA-binding activity. Introduction of the same mutation into an infectious IBV clone system showed that the mutation totally abolishes the transcription of subgenomic RNA and no infectious virus could be recovered. Mutation of a semi-conserved Ile (I95) residue in the same region showed moderately destabilizing effect on the IBV nsp9 homodimer but minimal effect on its RNA-binding activity. Introduction of the mutation into the IBV infectious clone system showed recovery of a mutant virus with severe growth defects, supporting that dimerization is critical for the function of this replicase protein. Meanwhile, mutations of some positively charged residues in the \u03b2-barrel regions of the IBV nsp9 protein significantly reduced its RNA-binding activity, but with no obvious effect on dimerization of the protein. Introduction of these mutations into the viral genome showed only mild to moderate effects on the growth and infectivity of the rescued mutant viruses.",

            "text": "Coronavirus is a family of RNA viruses with the largest RNA genome known so far. In cells infected with coronavirus, a nested set of genomic and subgenomic RNA species is produced and used for translation of viral structural and nonstructural proteins. Among these proteins, the 1a and 1ab polyproteins are post-translationally processed to smaller, mature proteins (Ziebuhr et al., 2000; Ziebuhr, 2005) . It is generally believed that replication of the large RNA genome and transcription of a nested set of 5 to 8 subgenomic RNA species are carried out by these replicase proteins. However, the exact functions of individual replicase proteins are largely unknown. In recent years, determination of the crystal structures of some of these proteins, including the proteinase domain of nsp3, nsp5, nsp7 and 8, nsp9, nsp10 and nsp15, led to the revelation of many important functions for these proteins (Saikatendu et al., 2005; Ratia et al., 2006; Peti et al., 2005; Zhai et al., 2005; Anand et al., 2002 Anand et al., , 2003 Yang et al., 2003; Egloff et al., 2004; Sutton et al., 2004; Su et al., 2006; Joseph et al., 2006; Ricagno et al., 2006) , but most of these functions are not rigorously tested in a biologically relevant system. In this study, residues critical for dimerization and the RNA-binding activity of nsp9 protein from coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) were systematically studied by mutagenesis, based on the structural studies of SARS-CoV nsp9 protein.",

Searching for structural homology between SARS-CoV nsp9 and other RNA binding proteins suggests that the SARS-CoV nsp9 protein is a nucleic acid-binding protein and has nonspecific RNA-binding activity (Egloff et al., 2004) . Biophysical evidence has also shown an interaction between SARS-CoV nsp9 and nsp8 proteins (Sutton et al., 2004) . Based on sequence comparison, a number of evolutionarily conserved amino acid residues in different domains of the IBV nsp9 protein were systematically mutated to assess their roles in viral replication and infectivity by introducing into an infectious cDNA clone system derived from the genomic RNA of IBV. Subsequently, dimeri-zation and the RNA-binding activity of the purified wild type and mutant IBV nsp9 protein were studied by immunoprecipitation, gel filtration, chemical cross linking and Northwestern blotting. These studies led to the identification of amino acid residues essential for dimerization and the RNA-binding activity of IBV nsp9 protein. This study thus presents biochemical and genetic evidence that directly links dimerization and the RNA binding activity of the coronavirus nsp9 protein to virus replication and infectivity in cultured cells. This information would be of help in design of preventive and treatment approaches against coronavirus infection.",

The primer pair was chosen so that the IBV sequence from nucleotides 14,931 to 15,600 would be amplified by the RT-PCR reaction. If replication of viral RNA occurred, a 670 bp PCR fragment would be expected. As shown in Fig.  2b , RT-PCR fragments amplified from both positive (lanes 2 and 5) and negative (lanes 3 and 6) strand RNA templates were obtained from cells transfected with wild type and the mutant transcripts. The amount of negative strand RNA was approximately one third of the positive strand RNA (Fig. 2b) . RT-PCR amplification of subgenomic mRNAs was then carried out to check whether a low level of subgenomic mRNA transcription occurred in cells transfected with the mutant transcripts. The forward primer used in this reaction corresponds to the leader sequence from nucleotides 26-46 in the genomic RNA and the downstream primers covers IBV sequences from nucleotides 24,784 to 24,803.

For this purpose, wild type and mutant fragments with a 6-His tag at their N-terminus were cloned into a bacterial expression vector, expressed in E. coli and purified to near homogeneity. After removing the 6-His tag, the purified proteins were treated with 0-2% of glutaraldehyde, a short self-polymerizing reagent that reacts with lysine, tyrosine, histidine and tryptophan residues, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Gradually increased detection of the homodimer was observed following cross-linking of wild type and mutant proteins with increasing concentrations of the cross-linking agent (Fig. 3a) . Interestingly, it was noted that G98D mutant protein showed much less, if any, dimer formation without cross-linking with glutaraldehyde (Fig. 3a) . The I95N mutant protein also showed significantly reduced dimer formation under the same conditions (Fig. 3a) . These results suggest that the I95N and G98D mutations may destabilize the IBV nsp9 homodimer.",

            "text": "This possibility was further studied in the following two ways. First, the purified wild type and mutant proteins were analyzed by gel filtration after removing the 6-His tag. The results showed the detection of two peaks for wild type and the I95N mutant (Fig. 3b) . Analysis of the two peaks by mass spectrometry confirmed that they indeed represent the nsp9 monomers and dimers, respectively. However, only one peak was observed for the G98D mutant protein (Fig. 3b ). Once again, analysis by mass spectrometry confirmed that it represents the nsp9 monomers containing the right point mutation. Second, wild type, I95N and G98D mutant nsp9 were cloned into a mammalian expression vector with either a Flag or a Myc tag at the N-terminus. The Flag-tagged wild type nsp9 were coexpressed with the Myc-tagged wild type nsp9, I95N and G98D mutants, respectively. The association of wild type nsp9 protein with either wild type or mutant nsp9 proteins was analyzed by coimmunoprecipitation experiment with anti-Flag antibody. The immunoprecipitated proteins were separated on SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting with either anti-Flag or anti-Myc antibody. As shown in Fig. 3c , Western blot analysis of total cell lysates showed the detection of similar amounts of wild type and mutant nsp9 proteins either expressed on their own or co-expressed with the Flag-tagged wild type nsp9 (Fig. 3c, top panel) . Analysis of the precipitates with anti-Flag antibody showed the presence of approximately equal amounts of the Flag-tagged wild type nsp9 either expressed on its own or co-expressed with the Myc-tagged wild type and mutant nsp9 (Fig. 3c, middle panel) . Analysis of the same precipitates with anti-Myc antibody showed that efficient G98A and G98D mutant IBV nsp9 protein after chemical cross-linking. The purified wild type and mutant nsp9 proteins were treated with 0-2% of glutaraldehyde, and analyzed by SDS-15% polyacrylamide gel. The monomeric (m) and dimeric (d) forms of the protein are indicated. Numbers on the left indicate molecular masses in kiloDalton. (b) Analysis of wild type and I95N and G98D mutant nsp9 proteins by gel-filtration. The purified wild type and mutant nsp9 proteins were analyzed by gel filtration assay using BioSuiteTM 250 HR SEC column (7.8 \u00d7 300 mm, Waters) on Shimadszu chromatograph (LC-10ATvp) equipped with a photodiode array detector (SPD-M20A). The column was equilibrated at a flow rate of 1 ml/min with PBS buffer at room temperature. The protein samples (300 \u03bcl) were injected at a given concentration and detected. The first peak was formed by the nsp9 dimer (\u223c24 kDa), and the second peak indicated the monomer (\u223c12 kDa). (c) Analysis of the dimerization of wild type and I95N and G98D mutant proteins by co-immunoprecipitation. HeLa cells overexpressing the Flag-tagged wild type, Myc-tagged wild type and mutant nsp9 protein either on their own (lanes 1-4) or in different combination (lanes 5-7) were lysed, separated on SDS-15% polyacrylamide gel and analyzed by Western blotting with anti-Myc antibody (top panels). The same lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Flag antibody, separated on SDS-15% polyacrylamide gel and analyzed by Western blotting with either anti-Flag (middle panel) or anti-Myc (bottom panel) antibodies. detection of the Myc-tagged wild type nsp9 was made only when it was co-expressed with the Flag-tagged nsp9 protein (Fig. 3c , bottom panel, lane 5). Interestingly, much reduced detection of the Myctagged I95N was observed when it was co-expressed with the Flagtagged wild type nsp9 (Fig. 3c , bottom panel, lane 6), demonstrating that this point mutation destabilizes the nsp9 homodimer. When the Myc-tagged G98D construct was co-expressed with the Flag-tagged wild type nsp9, the mutant protein was not detected in the coimmunoprecipitation experiment (Fig. 3c, bottom panel, lane 7) . Taken together, these results confirm that the G98D mutation totally abolishes the nsp9 homodimer formation.",

Approximately equal amounts of the purified wild type and G98D mutant proteins were separated on SDS-PAGE either before or after removal of the 6-His tag (Fig. 4a, top panel) . Once again, formation of reasonable amounts of dimer was detected in the purified wild type protein (Fig. 4a , top panel, lane 3). After transfer to a Hybond C extra membrane, the RNA-binding activities of wild type and G98D mutant proteins were analyzed by Northwestern blot with two probes corresponding, respectively, to the positive-and negative-sense 3\u2032-UTR of IBV. The results showed that both wild type and G98D mutant proteins with the 6-His tag could efficiently bind to either probe (Fig.  4a, middle and bottom panels, lanes 1 and 2) . It was noted that efficient detection of the dimeric form of the two proteins was achieved when either probe was used (Fig. 4a , middle and bottom panels, lanes 1 and 2), suggesting preferential binding of the probes to the homodimer of the protein. After removal of the 6-His tag, both the monomeric and dimeric forms of the purified wild type protein could still efficiently bind to either probe (Fig. 4a , middle and bottom panels, lane 3). However, very weak, if any, binding of the G98D mutant protein to either probe was observed after removal of the 6-His tag (Fig. 4a, middle and bottom panels, lane 4) , suggesting that this point mutation abolishes the RNA-binding activity of IBV nsp9 protein. The other three mutant proteins showed similar RNA-binding activity as wild type protein, except that G98A mutant showed greatly reduced binding activity to the negative RNA probe (Fig. 4a, lane 7) . The binding efficiency of wild type and the four mutant proteins was then quantified by densitometry measurement of bands from three independent experiments. The relative RNA-binding efficiencies of the mutant proteins to wild type protein are shown in Fig. 4b . The results demonstrated that the G98D mutant protein maintained 0 and 4% binding efficiencies, and the G98A mutant showed 75 and 10% binding efficiencies to the positive and negative probes, respectively (Fig. 4b) . The I95A and I95N mutant proteins showed 80 to 100% binding efficiencies to both probes (Fig. 4b) .",

In cells infected with K10A and K90A and mutant viruses, plaques with slightly smaller size were observed (Fig. 5c) . Analysis of the growth curves of wild type and mutant viruses demonstrated that the Y31A and K51A exhibited similar growth kinetics as wild type virus, reaching the peak at 16 h post-infection (Fig. 5c ). At this time point, the titers of the two mutant viruses were approximately 5 fold lower than that of wild type virus (Fig. 5c) . The other two mutant viruses, K10A and K90A, grew slightly more slowly than wild type virus, reaching the peak at 24 h post-infection (Fig. 5c) .

It is generally believed that the functionally active form of the coronavirus replicase proteins would consist of 15-16 smaller, mature proteins (nsp1-nsp16) derived by proteolytic cleavage of these two polyproteins. In this study, systematic mutagenesis of one of these proteins, nsp9, was carried out to study the functional roles of this protein in coronavirus RNA replication and infectivity. Our results are consistent with structural data that indicate that nsp9 forms homodimers, and we have identified residues that are essential for nsp9 function during virus replication. Substitution of a negatively charged amino acid (Asp) for a conserved G98 residue in the C-terminal \u03b1-helix greatly destabilized the IBV nsp9 homodimer and abolished the RNA-binding activity of the protein.",

In each monomer, seven-\u03b2 strands and one \u03b1-helix form a cone-shaped \u03b2-barrel flanked by the C-terminal \u03b1-helix (Fig. 6 ). The C-terminal \u03b1-helix has a high content of hydrophobic residues, yielding two hydrophobic sides. One side faces the \u03b2-barrel and the other interacts with the C-terminal \u03b1-helix of the second crystallographic monomer to form the homodimer (Fig. 6) . This homodimer is therefore assembled by hydrophobic interactions (Egloff et al., 2004; Sutton et al., 2004) . Analysis of the purified SARS-CoV nsp9 protein by surface plasmon resonance demonstrated that it is a single strand RNA-binding protein (Egloff et al., 2004) . This single strand RNA-binding activity was further confirmed by fluorescence experiments (Egloff et al., 2004) . By structural modeling, the IBV nsp9 protein was found to adopt a very similar folding as the SARS-CoV nsp9 protein (Fig. 6 ). Based on these structural studies, the topology of nsp9 protein was shown to most closely resemble the domains of the 3C-like proteinase (3CL pro ) which belongs to the serine proteinase superfamily (Berman et al., 2000) . Structure alignments revealed that it best matches to the domain II of the coronavirus 3CL pro and subdomian I of the picornaviral 3C pro , suggesting that the two groups of proteins may share certain evolutionary relationship and may play some regulatory functions (Sutton et al., 2004) . The direct correlation of the RNA replication efficiency and infectivity of IBV with the stability of the nsp9 homodimer confirms that dimer is the functional form of the protein.",

In HCoV-229E nsp9, dimerization is mediated by a disulfide bridge, a few hydrogen bonds, and hydrophobic interaction between the C-terminal helix of each monomer. The structural difference between HCoV-229E and SARS-CoV nsp9 may be due to the presence of extra residues from the cloning procedure at the N-terminus of the SARS-CoV nsp9 preparation used for structure determination, which could result in different homodimer forms and different biological functions of proteins. In this study, we observed that the six His-tags in the N-terminus of IBV Nsp9 rendered drastic effects on dimerization and RNA-binding activity of the protein. The six-His tag was removed by factor Xa from all wild type and mutant constructs in our biochemical studies of the protein.",

This form of nsp9 dimer can bind to single-stranded RNA more tightly and therefore promote replication of the viral genome (Ponnusamy et al. 2008 ). The SARS-CoV nsp9 has three Cys residues and one of them (Cys 73) is corresponding to Cys 69 in HCoV-229E nsp9. However, these residues are not involved in the formation of intermolecular disulfide bond (Ponnusamy et al. 2008) .

As explained, no infectious virus was recovered from cells transfected with G98D mutant transcripts. Evidence present suggests that G98D mutation may lead to the disruption of subgenomic RNA transcription and the protein is therefore directly involved in the viral replication. As the RNA-binding assay used in this study involves binding of RNA probes to the denatured, momomeric form of the nsp9 protein, it is quite unlikely that the loss of RNA-binding activity for this mutant is the direct consequence of destabilization of the nsp9 homodimer by this point mutation.

The structural characteristics of nsp9 suggested that its nucleic acid-binding activity is not strictly sequence-specific (Egloff et al., 2004; Sutton et al., 2004) . The nsp9 protein may bind RNA through wrapping of the ssRNA around the nsp9 dimer (Egloff et al., 2004; Sutton et al., 2004) . In this study, we show that mutations of some positively charged residues in the \u03b2-barrel regions could significantly reduce the RNA-binding activity of the protein. However, introduction of the same mutations into the viral genome showed only mild or moderate effects on the growth and infectivity of the rescued mutant viruses, though positive correlation between the lowered binding activity and the reduced infectivity of the mutant viruses was observed. It seems that mutations that destabilized the nsp9 homodimer render more profound effect on IBV infectivity than mutations that reduced the RNA-binding activity of the protein per se. We are currently uncertain if this may reflect the limitation of the assay used to analyze the RNAbinding activity of the protein in the study. On the other hand, it would suggest that formation of the nsp9 homodimer may play functions not directly related to the RNA-binding activity of the protein.

Biophysical evidence has also been presented for an interaction between nsp9 and nsp8 of MHV (Sutton et al., 2004) . Interaction between other replicase proteins was also documented. For example, a co-crystal structure of SARS-CoV nsp7 with nsp8 revealed a complex of eight monomers of each protein forming a hollow cylindrical structure. This hexadecameric assembly was proposed to be able to encircle an RNA template, possibly acting as a processivity factor for the RNA polymerase (Zhai et al., 2005) . Structural analysis indicated that nsp9 may play multiple roles in coronavirus replication cycle, and its interaction with other proteins may be essential for the formation of the viral replication complex together with its ability to interact with RNA (Egloff et al., 2004; Sutton et al., 2004) . However, we were unable to demonstrate direct interaction between IBV nsp9 and the two putative essential components of the replication complex, RdRp and RNA helicase in the overexpression system (data not shown).

Briefly, five fragments spanning the entire IBV genome were obtained by RT-PCR from Vero cells infected with the Vero cell-adapted IBV p65. The PCR products were purified from agarose gels and cloned into pCR-XL-TOPO (Invitrogen) or pGEM-T Easy (Promega) vectors. Subsequently, fragment A was removed from pCR-XL-TOPO by digestion with NheI and EcoRI, and subcloned into pKT0 vector. Plasmids were digested with either BsmBI (fragment A) or BsaI (fragments B, C, D and E). The digested plasmids were separated on 0.8% agarose gels containing crystal violet. Bands corresponding to each of the fragments were cut from the gels and purified with QIAquick gel extraction kit (QIAGEN Inc.). Fragments A and B, and fragments C, D and E were first ligated with T4 DNA ligase at 4\u00b0C overnight. The two reaction mixtures were then mixed and further ligated at 4\u00b0C overnight. The final ligation products were extracted with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1), precipitated with ethanol and detected by electrophoresis on 0.4% agarose gels. Full-length transcripts were generated in vitro using the mMessage mMachine T7 kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). The N transcripts were generated by using a linearized pKTO-IBVN containing IBV N gene and the 3\u2032-untranslated region (3\u2032-UTR) as templates. The in vitro synthesized full-length and N transcripts were treated with DNase I and purified with phenol/chloroform. Vero cells were grown to 90% confluence, trypsinized, washed twice with cold phosphatebuffered saline (PBS), and resuspended in PBS. RNA transcripts were added to 400 \u03bcl of Vero cell suspension in an electroporation cuvette, and electroporated with one pulse at 450 V, 50 \u03bcF with a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser II electroporator. The transfected Vero cells were cultured overnight in 1% FBS-containing MEM in a 60 mm dish or a 6-well plate and further cultured in MEM without FBS. Mutations were introduced into the corresponding fragments by using QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), and confirmed by sequencing of the whole fragments.",

(a) Northwestern analysis of the RNA binding activity of wild type and I95A, I95N, G98A and G98D mutant nsp9 proteins. The purified wild type and mutant nsp9 proteins with or without the 6xHis tag were separated on two SDS-15% polyacrylamide gels. One gel was directly detected by staining with Commassie blue (top panel), and the second was transferred to Hybond C extra membrane. The RNAbinding activity was probed with either positive (middle panel) or negative (bottom panel) sense, digoxin-labeled RNA corresponding to 26,539-27,608 nucleotides of the IBV genome. The bands corresponding to the dimeric form with the His tag (d-His), the dimeric form without the His tag (d), the monomeric form with His tag (m-His) and the monomeric form without the His tag (m) are indicated. Numbers on the left indicate molecular masses in kiloDalton.(b)",
