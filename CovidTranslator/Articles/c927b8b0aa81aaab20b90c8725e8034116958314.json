A mouse RPE/choroid DNA expression library was screened using sera from virus infected BALB/c mice. Two clones were identified, villin-2 protein and \u03b1-fodrin protein. \u03b1-Fodrin protein was used for further analysis and western blot reactivity was seen only in sera from virus infected BALB/c mice. CD4 T cells were shown to specifically react with MHV antigens and with \u03b1-fodrin protein.

Sera from MHV infected BALB/c mice reacted strongly with a 71 kDa rat protein and a 60 kDa bovine protein from rat and bovine RPE extracts. There are no identified retinal autoantigens within this molecular weight range (60-71 kDa). However, there is an RPE protein, RPE65, with a size within this molecular weight range. It has been reported that defective functioning of the RPE65 protein causes photoreceptors to die (Hooks et al., 1989; Redmond et al., 1998) . We examined the sera from MHV infected BALB/c mice and found no immunoreactivity to RPE65 (data not shown). Using sera pooled from BALB/c mice infected with MHV to screen a mouse RPE/choroid cDNA expression library, two unique clones were isolated. The DNA sequence of these clones showed high homology to the genes for \u03b1-fodrin/spectrin 2A and villin 2. A truncated form of \u03b1-fodrin was expressed and purified, and only sera from MHV infected BALB/c mice demonstrated reactivity to this protein. We are in the process of expressing villin 2.",

Like erythroid spectrin, nonerythroid spectrin, also called fodrin, consists of heterodimers of \u03b1 and \u03b2 subunits. Two forms of fodrin have been found in the retina of mice, differing only in the \u03b2 subunits. Immunoreactivity to fodrin occurred in the cytoplasm of cell bodies in the INL and ganglion cell layer. Fodrin has been localized to the apical plasma membrane of RPE in vivo but to both the apical and basolateral membranes in cultured RPE (Davis et al., 1995) .",

The 120 kDa \u03b1-fodrin breakdown product results specifically from cleavage by caspase-3 (Janicke et al., 1998) , and the 150 kDa \u03b1-fodrin fragment results from breakdown of \u03b1-fodrin by calpain (Dutta et al., 2002) .

ECOR susceptible mice may produce antibodies to \u03b1-fodrin due to damage caused by the viral infection which could include chronic activation of caspases and calpain.

A splenocyte population that was enriched for CD4 T cells also proliferated when exposed to purified antigen. This population of CD4 T cells could also contribute to retinal degeneration in ECOR possibly by altering the cytokine/chemokine environment in the retina to either cause direct damage to retinal cells or by increasing infiltration into the retina by other immune cells. CD4 T cells have been found to contribute to the development of disease in other models of autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS) (Wu et al., 2001) and autoimmune type 1 diabetes (Anderson and Bluestone, 2005) . The same virus used to induce ECOR is also used to study a mouse model of MS. In this virus triggered MS model system, CD4 T cells appear to contribute more to the severity of clinical disease than CD8 T cells. Wu et al. also showed that macrophage infiltration into the CNS was greater in CD4 T cell enriched recipients. Studies by Lane et al. (2000) indicated that CD4 T cells played a role in demyelination by regulating the expression of RANTES and thus augmenting the infiltration of macrophages into the CNS.",

In the eye, villin 2 is found in the apical microvilli of both M\u00fcller and RPE cells (Bonilha et al., 2006) . Autoantibodies to villin 2 have not been found in any human autoimmune diseases, but autoantibodies to villin have been detected in patients with colon cancer (Rimm et al., 1995) . Photoreceptor loss was noted in ezrin knockout mice and this loss was probably due to morphological defects in RPE and M\u00fcller cells since ezrin is not found in the photoreceptors (Bonilha et al., 2006) .

            "text": "In summary, we have identified two retinal autoantigens, \u03b1-fodrin and villin 2, in ECOR. After ECOR susceptible mice were infected with MHV JHM, they produced antibodies to \u03b1-fodrin and their CD4 T cells were specifically activated by \u03b1-fodrin. These data suggest that both antibodies to \u03b1-fodrin and CD4 T cells specifically sensitized to \u03b1-fodrin may contribute to the retinal degeneration seen in the ECOR susceptible mice. Identification of the mechanism of retinal degeneration in our ECOR model may provide new targets for therapeutic intervention in human retinal degenerative disorders. 6 . (A) Effects of phytohemagglutinin (PHA; 1 \u03bcg/well), UV-inactivated mouse hepatitis virus (UV-MHV; 2 \u00d7 10 5 PFU/well) and purified \u03b1-fodrin peptide (10 \u03bcg/well) on proliferation of splenocytes from MHV infected BALB/c mice (black bars) and uninfected BALB/c mice (gray bars). The bars represent the mean fold change in splenocyte proliferation \u00b1 SEM for each group. The data shown here is representative of two separate experiments, and three to six animals were in each group for each experiment. Treatment with PHA resulted in significant increases in splenocyte proliferation for both MHV infected (p = 0.02) and uninfected (p = 0.004) BALB/c mice. Incubation with UV-MHV significantly increased splenocyte proliferation only for MHV infected BALB/c mice (p b 0.0001). Splenocytes from MHV infected BALB/c mice (p = 0.04) responded to a peptide of \u03b1-fodrin, whereas, splenocytes from uninfected BALB/c mice did not respond. (B) Effects of a peptide of \u03b1-fodrin (10 \u03bcg/well) on proliferation of splenocyte populations enriched for CD4 + T cells, adherent cells or B cells from MHV infected BALB/c mice (black bars) and uninfected BALB/c mice (gray bars). Treatment with an \u03b1-fodrin peptide resulted in increases in proliferation of CD4 + T cells (p = 0.01) and adherent cells (p = 0.04) but not of B cells. Results were normalized by arbitrarily setting the change in proliferation of untreated cells to 1.0.",

(A) Effects of phytohemagglutinin (PHA; 1 \u03bcg/well), UV-inactivated mouse hepatitis virus (UV-MHV; 2 \u00d7 10 5 PFU/well) and purified \u03b1-fodrin peptide (10 \u03bcg/well) on proliferation of splenocytes from MHV infected BALB/c mice (black bars) and uninfected BALB/c mice (gray bars). The bars represent the mean fold change in splenocyte proliferation \u00b1 SEM for each group. The data shown here is representative of two separate experiments, and three to six animals were in each group for each experiment. Treatment with PHA resulted in significant increases in splenocyte proliferation for both MHV infected (p = 0.02) and uninfected (p = 0.004) BALB/c mice. Incubation with UV-MHV significantly increased splenocyte proliferation only for MHV infected BALB/c mice (p b 0.0001). Splenocytes from MHV infected BALB/c mice (p = 0.04) responded to a peptide of \u03b1-fodrin, whereas, splenocytes from uninfected BALB/c mice did not respond. (B) Effects of a peptide of \u03b1-fodrin (10 \u03bcg/well) on proliferation of splenocyte populations enriched for CD4 + T cells, adherent cells or B cells from MHV infected BALB/c mice (black bars) and uninfected BALB/c mice (gray bars). Treatment with an \u03b1-fodrin peptide resulted in increases in proliferation of CD4 + T cells (p = 0.01) and adherent cells (p = 0.04) but not of B cells. Results were normalized by arbitrarily setting the change in proliferation of untreated cells to 1.0.",
