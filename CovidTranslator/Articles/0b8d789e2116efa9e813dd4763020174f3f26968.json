The magnetically impregnated tumour cells could then be killed by exposing the tissue to a DC magnetic field. This is a potentially complementary technique to PDT, as Prasad explained, 'If photodynamic drugs can be encapsulated within such nanoparticles, they can work as dual-killers, by the magnetic as well as photodynamic action.'",

Stan Brown of the University of Leeds, UK (http://www.leeds.ac.uk/), a PDT expert not connected with the study, has mixed feelings. ' The two fundamental problems to be overcome in developing PDT are to achieve good selectivity and lack of generalized skin photosensitivity,' he said. 'If this approach can achieve either of these then that would represent significant progress.' However, he cautioned that without in vivo data, it is not quite clear whether the nanoparticle approach will do everything the authors expect. ",
