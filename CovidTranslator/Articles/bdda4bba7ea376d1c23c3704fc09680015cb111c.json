            "text": "Since pyrithiobac (PTB) is a successful commercial herbicide with very low toxicity against mammals, it is worth exploring its derivatives for an extensive study. Herein, a total of 35 novel compounds were chemically synthesized and single crystal of 6e6 was obtained to confirm the molecular structure of this family of compounds. The novel PTB derivatives were fully evaluated against various biological platforms. From the bioassay results, the best AHAS inhibitor 6e22 displayed weaker herbicidal activity but stronger anti-Candida activity than PTB did. For plant pathogenic fungi, 6e26 showed excellent activity at 50 mg/L dosage. Preliminary insecticidal activity and antiviral activity were also observed for some title compounds. Strikingly, 6e5 exhibited a promising inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV M pro with IC 50 of 4.471 mM and a low cellular cytotoxicity against mammalian 293 T cells. Based on the results of molecular modeling, HOMO-1 was considered to be a factor that affects AHAS inhibition and a possible binding mode of 6e5 with SARS-CoV M pro was predicted. This is the first time that PTB derivatives have been studied as biological agents other than herbicides. The present research hence has suggested that more attentions should be paid to compounds belonging to this family to develop novel agrochemicals or medicines.",

            "text": "Pyrithiobac (PTB) is a particular thioether compound in that the sulfur atom is connected by a phenyl ring and a pyrimidine ring, which in fact is a powerful herbicide used in cotton fields with excellent selectivity [7] . The target of this herbicide is acetehydroxyacid synthase (AHAS, EC 2.2.1.6), a special biological enzyme that exists only in plants and microbes [8] . A recent crystallography study showed that PTB binds with plant AHAS in a similar cavity provided by two neighboring subunits [9] . Nevertheless, PTB derivatives have not been fully explored till now. As is known, compounds containing heterocycle ring such as pyrimidine or triazine often show diverse agricultural or medicinal activities. For instances, pyramat is a successful insecticide with a pyrimidine ring developed in the 1960s and anilazine is a traditional fungicide with a triazine ring that have been used for over 60 years [10, 11] . Recently, some aromatic disulfides with pyrimidine ring (exampled) were discovered to be potent inhibitors of main protease of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV M pro ) [12] . The chemical structures of dimethyl sulfide, phenyl sulfide, diallyl sulfide, methionine, example-a, example-b, example-c, pyrithiobac, pyramat, anilazine and example-d mentioned above are shown in Fig. 1 .",

To our delight, the title compounds exhibited multiple bioactivities, against agricultural weeds, insects, pathogenic plant fungi or plant virus, and medicinal infections caused by fungus or SARSassociated coronavirus. For compounds that showed remarkable activity against SARS-CoV M pro , very low cellular cytotoxicity was observed against mammalian 293 T cells. In addition, the chemical structure of 6e6 was elucidated clearly from single crystal X-ray diffraction, which evidently indicated that these PTB derivatives were chemically prepared successfully. Molecular simulations were performed and it was found that HOMO-1 might contribute to AHAS inhibition from DFT calculation and a plausible binding mode of inhibitor 6e5 with SARS-CoV M pro was generated via molecular docking.",

Although 2 and 3 were commercially available, they were chemically synthesized in our laboratory. Various mercaptobenzonitriles 2 were prepared from corresponding fluorobenzonitriles 1 via a nucleophilic substitution attacked by a sulfhydryl group provided by sodium sulfide nonahydrate to give desirable outputs. 2 were further hydrolyzed under alkaline condition from mercaptobenzonitriles to mercaptobenzoic acids 3 with satisfactory yields. Some intermediates were hard to be purified and were used directly in the following reaction. According to the literature [13] , hydrolysis of 2 occurs easily under the condition of 15% sodium hydroxide at 150 C, however, this reaction was not observed until the condition was changed to 30% sodium hydroxide at 175 C with 0.9 equivalent of sodium sulfide nonahydrate added to the solution in an autoclave reactor. It should be noted that when there is a trifluoromethyl group in the ortho or para position of the hydrosulphonyl group of 2, the trifluoromethyl group itself will be hydrolyzed at the same time when the cyanogroup is hydrolyzed, however when the trifluoromethyl group is at the meta position of the hydrosulphonyl group, the hydrolysis of trifluoromethyl group does not happen, which has been confirmed by the final compounds. This is in agreement with an early report by Jones in 1947 [14] . The synthesis and characterizations of the intermediates 2 and 3 are detailed in the supplementary material.",

For the synthesis of compound 6e22 to 6e33, intermediate 2 or 3 reacted with 4,6dimethoxy-2-(methylsulfonyl)pyrimidine 5 in ethanol to give the final product, which is also a nucleophilic substitution but in this case the leaving group is a methanesulfonyl group in the pyrimidine ring and the corresponding base is sodium bicarbonate [17] .

For the anti-Candida activity, there is some difference between the results from RPMI 1640 media and that from YNB media, and from the latter the activity is higher. It is known that, YNB media does not contain the BCAAs while RPMI media contains these amino acids, therefore there will be a shift of the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values between the data from the two medias if AHAS inhibition is the cause of the antifungal activity. The results here indicated that the observed anti-Candida activity was due to this reason, which is also in accordance with our previous report [19] . When the observation time changed to 48 h instead of 24 h, MIC data increased to different extent (data now shown), which means that the anti-Candida activity here was an inhibitory effect, not a fungicidal effect. There exists a strong correlation between the fungal AHAS inhibition data and the antifungal activity for 6e9, 6e22 and 6e27. No antifungal activity was found for any compound with very weak AHAS inhibition. For comparison, PTB did not have any inhibitory activity in the cell based assay at all the conditions, however, ethoxysulfuron was a very potent inhibitor in the YNB media, with MIC values of 0.39 mg/L against all the three fungal isolates. These experimental results were similar to the reported potencies of the two commercial AHAS inhibitors [18, 19] .",

This implied that the two family of herbicidal AHAS inhibitors are different when subjected to fungal inhibition. Nevertheless, here the synthesized new derivatives demonstrated some interesting difference with PTB. For instance, 6e22 was more potent regarding the fungal AHAS and anti-Candida activity than PTB was, while the herbicidal activity of 6e22 was significantly weaker than that of PTB. In both fungal AHAS and plant AHAS inhibition tests, 6e22 was one of the best inhibitor. For 6e22, there is a fluorine atom at the para position of the sulfur atom, while for PTB, a chlorine atom locates at the meta position of the sulfur atom. This minor structural difference has led to significant difference in their biological activities. A compound that combines the feature of PTB and 6e22 has been designed, which has fluorine atoms or chlorine atoms at both para and meta positions of the sulfur atom in the molecule.

The concentrations for 50% of the maximal effect (EC 50 ) of 6e11, 6e23, 6e25, 6e26, 6e27, 6e35 and PTB against R. cerealis were determined subsequently and the corresponding EC 50 data were 12.4 mg/L, 14.1 mg/L, 11.8 mg/L, 9.2 mg/L, 11.4 mg/L, 10.9 mg/L and 15.4 mg/L, respectively. The control chlorothalonil was active against all the selected fungi with inhibition data >75%, and EC 50 against R. cerealis was 5.3 mg/L. Compound 6e26 was the best inhibitor among all the compounds, showing >75% inhibition against three fungi and the best inhibition of 60.6% against R. bakanae, which might be considered as a potential fungicide for further study. It should be pointed out that the media for this assay contains the amino acids and we failed to try these assays under YNB media, therefore antifungal activity determined here does not necessarily have direct relationship with AHAS inhibition, or AHAS inhibition might not be the sole factor. Although 6e22 was not subjected to the plant fungi assay, there were some overlaps between the anti-Candida activity and antifungal activities against plant fungi disease, such as 6e3, 6e5 and 6e27. Obviously, C. albicans and the plant pathogenic fungi are different species. PTB did not exhibit any anti-Candida activity, but it was an inhibitor of R. cerealis. Table 4 presents the larvicidal activity of the target compounds against Mythimna separata at 600 mg/L concentration. 6e3, 6e14 and 6e20 exhibited >75% insecticidal activity, while 6e6 and 6e9 showed no activity for this test. In contrast, the commercial pesticide rynaxypyr displayed 100% insecticidal activity at a much lower concentration of 10 mg/L, much stronger than any of the tested target compounds. This is a valuable attempt despite that these compounds possess very weak insecticidal activity, and it implies that some PTB derivatives might be useful for the research of novel insecticides.",

            "text": "It is generally accepted that frontier molecular orbital contributes significantly to the inhibitor-enzyme interaction [20e23]. Among the title compounds, 6e22 showed potent inhibitions for both fungal AHAS and plant AHAS, as well as its desirable anti-Candida activity and herbicidal activity. Meanwhile, 6e8 and 6e12 were very weak inhibitors towards both AHASs, and no in vivo activities were observed. These compounds were then subjected to theoretical calculations by means of DFT/B3LYP method. From the crystal structure of PTB bound with A. thaliana AHAS, it is clear that the pyrimidine ring forms a p-p interaction with a neighboring residue Trp574 [9] , which means that the pyrimidine ring or the triazine ring in the newly synthesized compounds might be involved in this interaction. The HOMO-1, HOMO, LUMO and LUMO\u00fe1 of these compounds were drawn Fig. 4 or Fig. S1 . Comparisons of these maps revealed that here HOMO-1 might be an important factor in AHAS inhibition. For 6e22, HOMO-1 covers not only the pyrimidine ring, but also the phenyl ring, whereas for 6e8 and 6e12, the HOMO-1s only distribute in the heterocycle ring (Fig. 4) . This suggests that 6e22 is possible to have more interactions with the enzyme than 6e8 and 6e12 do. However for HOMO, LUMO and LUMO\u00fe1 maps (seen in Fig. S1 ), there are either no obvious differences (HOMO and LUMO\u00fe1), or the difference is in conflict with the known p-p interaction with W574 (LUMO). Based on these thoughts, it is concluded that HOMO-1 is a non-negligible element for the further molecular design of AHAS-inhibiting PTB derivatives.",

Now that we have identified that a lot of the target compounds are good inhibitors of this enzyme and 6e5 even showed very low cellular cytotoxicity, it is interesting to dock the inhibitor to the binding site to investigate the probable mode of action. FlexX is a fast, flexible docking method that uses an incremental construction algorithm to place ligands into an active site [24] , which has been used previously to successfully predict the binding modes of several families of inhibitors [12, 19, 25] . This program was utilized to divine the binding mode in this study. Fig. 5a is a two-dimensional illustration of the interactions between 6e5 and the surrounding residues of SARS-CoV M pro drawn by LIGPLOT [26] . As can be seen, multiple hydrophobic interactions were formed by 6e5 with Thr26, Leu27, Phe140, Leu141, Gly143, His163, Glu166 and His172, while four intermolecular hydrogen bonds could be seen between 6e5 and Asn142, Ser144 and Cys145. Fig. 5b shows the three-dimensional molecular surface of the cavity generated by PyMOL (DeLano Scientific, South San Francisco, CA), and 6e5 adopted a relaxed conformation to inhabit in the cavity. The predicted binding mode has provided meaningful information for design more potent SARS-CoV M pro inhibitors.",

Since thioether compounds are always associated with considerable biological activities, it is necessary to investigate different bioactivities to widen their agricultural or medicinal use. As PTB itself is a highly safe compound towards mammals, compounds with similar structures are expected to have biologically safe property. In this research, a total of 35 PTB derivatives were synthesized and characterized, and this is the first time that such derivatives have been evaluated comprehensively against different bioassays. The target compounds were found to have anti-Candida activity, herbicidal activity, antifungal activity against plant fungi, insecticidal activity, anti-TMV activity and inhibitions against SARS-CoV M pro . As a promising AHAS inhibitor, 6e22 exhibited desirable C. albicans inhibition and potent herbicidal activity. Interestingly, 6e26 displayed potent antifungal activity against plant pathogenic diseases. 6e22 also showed desirable passivation efficacies against TMV. Furthermore, some compound such as 6e5 was identified to be potent inhibitor of SARS-CoV M pro . From a DFT calculation, HOMO-1 might have impact on AHAS inhibitory activity. A feasible binding mode was constructed to explain the interaction of 6e5 with SARS-CoV M pro . Overall, because 6e5 displayed activities from all the bioassays and its cell cytotoxicity data was very low, it is regarded as a lead compound for further molecular design.",
