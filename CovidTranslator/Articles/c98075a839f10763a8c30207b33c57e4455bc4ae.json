            "text": "The host inflammatory response in pneumococcal disease contributes significantly to morbidity and mortality. 1 As in other infections with Gram-positive bacteria, the inflammatory response in pneumococcal infection is primarily driven by immunoreactive bacterial cell wall components [lipoteichoic acid (LTA)] or the release of intracellular proteins. 2 LTA is recognized by Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2), a pattern recognition receptor on macrophages. Binding of LTA to TLR2 induces the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g. IL-1, IL-6 and TNF) and neutrophil influx. 3, 4 Bacterial cell wall components are released when bacteria are killed by autolysis or host immune cells, and are important determinants of the severity of inflammation. 5 An acute breakdown of the bacterial cell wall occurs upon exposure to b-lactam antibiotics, 6 the first-line treatment for pneumococcal infections in many guidelines. 7, 8 Reduction of release of bacterial cell wall products may decrease inflammation, reduce tissue damage and, ultimately, reduce morbidity and mortality. Strategies to dampen the host inflammatory response have been studied extensively. Currently, dexamethasone adjunctive treatment in patients with pneumococcal meningitis is used in high-income countries to diminish inflammatory responses and, consequently, neurological sequelae. 9 In community-acquired pneumonia, macrolides seem to have an immune modulatory effect by enhancing the antibacterial effect of neutrophils and by quashing the immune response after bacterial killing. 10 However, in a clinical trial, b-lactam monotherapy was non-inferior to macrolide with b-lactam combination therapy. 11 Another potential approach is to kill the bacteria without immediately lysing them, thus preventing the release of pro-inflammatory cell wall products. 12 This would reduce the complete inflammatory trigger by interfering at the beginning of the inflammation cascade.",

After inclusion of the eighth Non-lytic antibiotic treatment effect on inflammation in CAP JAC study patient, we extended our inclusion criteria to patients having a specific risk factor for pneumococcal pneumonia to speed up inclusions. 17 We applied extensive testing for pneumococcal infection to ensure the identification of all patients with pneumococcal pneumonia. 23 We were able to confirm a pneumococcal infection in 41% of patients. This percentage is higher than in comparable hospital and intensive care studies with community-acquired pneumonia. 11, 26, 27 In vitro studies and animal models have demonstrated differences in LTA release and inflammatory responses within hours in lytic versus non-lytic antibiotic treatment of S. pneumoniae. 12, 28, 29 Although extensive sampling is a challenge in human trials, it is essential for the testing of our hypothesis.

With only four patients with pneumococcal pneumonia treated with b-lactam therapy only, this assumption was imperfect and the small group hindered comparisons. For example, in the analyses of biomarkers for inflammation, at the start of treatment, the PCT value seemed higher in the b-lactam group, while those of CRP and MR-proADM were higher in the rifampicin group.

Rifampicin would be the antibiotic of choice, since it is most effective in killing S. pneumoniae while causing the least release of LTA per killed bacterial cell. 41 Unfortunately, we could not compare monotherapy of a nonlytic (rifampicin) antibiotic versus monotherapy of a lytic, b-lactam, antibiotic. This would be a highly relevant but different research question. The reasons for this are that the current Dutch guidelines for community-acquired pneumonia recommend b-lactam antibiotic (e.g. benzylpenicillin) treatment and the fact that rifampicin monotherapy may induce resistance during treatment. Therefore, it would have been unethical to withhold this first-line treatment from patients with community-acquired pneumonia. A significant difference in LTA release has been demonstrated in a rabbit model of S. pneumoniae meningitis, when comparing b-lactam monotherapy with rifampicin followed by b-lactam antibiotic therapy 6 h later. 42 In the rifampicin treatment group in our study, rifampicin was frequently (56%) given before b-lactam treatment, but with a median time frame of 5 min only (IQR \" #10 to 60 min).

Further studies in selected groups of patients, such as those with pneumococcal meningitis, will be necessary to confirm the hypothesis that non-lytic antibiotic treatment attenuates inflammatory response and improves clinical outcome.
