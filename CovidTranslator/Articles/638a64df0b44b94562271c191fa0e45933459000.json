Estimating the eff ects of smoking and indoor air pollution on COPD and lung cancer requires incorporation of how fast risk accumulates after initiation, or reverses after cessation.

            "text": "PAF estimates the proportional reduction in disease or death that would occur if the observed exposure to a risk factor (P) were modifi ed to an alternative exposure scenario (P\u00b4). 9 The generalised version of the PAF relationship allows both exposure and relative risk to vary over time. Relative risk at time (t) depends on time since exposure initiation or cessation, because the eff ects of smoking and indoor air pollution accumulate gradually after exposure begins (eg, smoking initiation) and reverse gradually after exposure stops (eg, smoking cessation). 10, 11 We did separate analyses for lung cancer and COPD and for men and women, because they have diff erent relative risks. For both lung cancer and COPD, we fi rst computed PAFs separately for smoking and solid-fuel use. COPD and lung cancer are caused by multiple risk factors acting simultaneously, and hence a proportion of deaths might be prevented by reducing exposure to either factor. 9, 12, 13 For example, some COPD deaths among smokers who cook with solid fuels may be prevented by smoking prevention or by use of clean fuels. As a result of multicausality, the PAFs for multiple risk factors overlap, and cannot be combined by simple addition. We estimated the PAFs for the combined eff ects of smoking and solid fuel, accounting for multicausality and avoiding double-counting the overlap of multiple risk factors: 9, [12] [13] [14] PAF i =PAF of the i th risk factor n=number of risk factors Three conditions must hold when using the above equation. First, exposures to risks should be uncorrelated. The cross-province correlation coeffi cient between solidfuel use and smoking, from the data sources described in webappendix 1, was 0\u00b704 (95% CI -0\u00b732 to 0\u00b740, p=0\u00b782) for men and -0\u00b711 (-0\u00b745 to 0\u00b726, p=0\u00b756) for women, indicating small and non-signifi cant correlation. We also examined individual-level correlation with the 2006 panel from The China Health and Nutrition Survey (a multistage, random cluster survey, including 9788 adults in nine provinces throughout China with signifi cant variation in socioeconomic and health status). 15 61% of men and 4% of women had ever smoked in homes that did not use solid fuels and 63% of men and 4% of women had ever smoked in homes that did. The odds ratios for smoking, comparing solid-fuel users to non-users, was 1\u00b707 (0\u00b795-1\u00b720) for men and 1\u00b702 (0\u00b776-1\u00b736) for women, showing uncorrelated exposures. The second condition is that the hazardous eff ects of one risk are not mediated through other risks. Smoking and solid-fuel combustion are both sources of respirable pollutants, but the eff ects of pollutants from one source are not mediated through exposure to the other. The third condition is that the proportional eff ects of one risk do not depend on exposure to the other risk factor. The proportional mortality study of smoking in China showed that the relative risks of lung cancer and respiratory-disease mortality among Chinese smokers were not modifi ed by background disease levels, 16",

We used a dynamic tuberculosis transmission model, specifi cally the deterministic compartmental susceptiblelatent-infectious-recovered model (fi gure 1), described in detail elsewhere. 17, 18 The susceptible-latent-infectious-recovered model parameters were based on previous epidemiological studies on the natural history of tuberculosis and risk factors, China-specifi c demographic parameters, and calibration to epidemiology in China (webtable 1). We introduced smoking and indoor air pollution into the model by stratifying the model population into the four possible combinations of exposure to these risk factors, proportional to their actual (time-varying) prevalence in each province. We fi tted a time-varying transmission parameter, defi ned as the rate at which infectious individuals are able to infect people who are susceptible. Available data and previous modelling suggested that the transmission parameter declined almost linearly in England and Wales from about 20 in 1900 to about 1 at the end of the 20th century. 19 We set the value of the transmission parameter to 20 in 1900, and it declined linearly to an empirically-fi tted lower bound; the rate of decline and the lower bound were fi tted to minimise the root mean square of the diff erences between the modelled and observed tuberculosis prevalence by province. The fi tted lower bound, which determines tuberculosis incidence after 2000, was not sensitive to the initial transmission parameter in 1900. Model fi tting also considered that chemotherapy was unavailable before 1960 20 and that the mean duration of disease is 2 years without treatment, 0\u00b78 years under eff ective DOTS (directly observed treatment, short course), and 1\u00b75 years for programmes other than eff ective DOTS. 21 We applied the calibrated model to estimate future tuberculosis incidence under diff erent scenarios of smoking, solid-fuel use, and DOTS coverage.",

We used China Data Online 31 for data on provincial populations. The future projections of the national population came from the Population Division of the Department of Economic and Social Aff airs of the UN Secretariat 32 and those of the disease-specifi c mortality from the global burden of disease study conducted by the WHO. Global burden of disease forecasts disease-specifi c mortality on the basis of projections of economic and social development, smoking, obesity, and selected other disease determinants. 1 We constructed scenarios that represent the range of policies and programmes that can reduce smoking and solid-fuel use on the basis of experiences and trends in other countries and some parts of China (tables 1 and 2 and webfi gure 2). All scenarios covered a period of 30 years (2003-33). We constructed prevalence of risk factors over time in the scenarios for each province with a linear time trend, and aggregated the provincial prevalences to the national level. More than 99% of the tobacco market share in China is controlled by the Chinese National Tobacco Corporation. Tobacco prices and taxes are low and there are only a few tobacco control measures in place. 38 However, China ratifi ed the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control in October 2005, which came into eff ect in January, 2006. Future smoking prevalence will largely depend on the extent to which economic and regulatory approaches to tobacco control are pursued. Although male and female smoking prevalences probably have common policy determinants, the analyses of lung cancer and chronic disease mortality were done separately for men and women and included all sex-specifi c scenarios. The analysis for tuberculosis was done for men and women combined because relative risks were for both sexes combined and because there are indirect eff ects of smoking on tuberculosis between sexes. National adult smoking prevalence was 49\u00b76% for men and 3\u00b70% for women in 2003 according to the National Health Service Survey. Another National Tobacco Prevalence Survey in 2002 reported current smoking prevalence of 57\u00b74% for men and 2\u00b76% for women. The two surveys had slightly diff erent defi nitions of current smoking. 22, 33 Tobacco consumption per person in China peaked around 1990 and has declined slowly since then. 38 Data from three National Health Service Surveys (1993, 1998, 2003) show that smoking prevalence declined from 60\u00b73% to 49\u00b76% among men (standardised to the 2003 population); smoking in women declined from 4\u00b77% to 3\u00b70% in this period.",

But tuberculosis incidence can decline signifi cantly because treatment reduces the risk of infection through reducing the duration of infectiousness. Nonetheless, smoking and solid-fuel interventions should be components of tuberculosis control for at least three reasons. First, irrespective of coverage and eff ectiveness of DOTS, risk-factor interventions can further reduce incidence of tuberculosis. The complementary eff ects of risk-factor interventions occur through reducing the risk of latent infection and progression from latent infection to infectious disease. Second, reducing smoking in patients with tuberculosis might further strengthen DOTS eff ectiveness because smoking has been associated with delayed response to treatment. 63 Third, reducing smoking may itself lower the risk of drug resistance as recent studies have suggested a link between smoking and drug-resistant tuberculosis. 64, 65 Our quantitative analysis of the eff ects of the two leading environmental and lifestyle sources of respirable pollutants on a common set of infectious and chronic diseases used models that incorporated the aetiological risk factors in disease incidence and mortality over time. Specifi cally, our models and data sources accounted for the fact that eff ects on lung cancer and COPD accumulate or reverse gradually after exposure begins or stops and for dependency of tuberculosis incidence on prevalent infectious cases. We used several large sources of data to reconstruct consistent and comparable trends of smoking, solid-fuel use, and tuberculosis in China's provinces. Scenarios were constructed on the basis of policy experiences in China and other countries, and can provide programme targets and benchmarks. Current and projected mortality from COPD and lung cancer from the global burden of disease analysis used Chinese mortality data sources and accounted for demographic and socioeconomic development. 1 The relative risks and how they change over time were based on meta-analyses and large high-quality epidemiological studies in China and elsewhere.",

We quantifi ed selected major sources of uncertainty in sensitivity analyses (webappendices 2 and 3, webfi gures 6 and 7, and webtables 3-5). These analyses show that the largest source of uncertainty for COPD and lung cancer is whether the relative risks of smoking related diseases in China will reach those observed in western populations. One recent study in China is consistent with increasing relative risks, 66 but the possibility of ethnic diff erences cannot be ruled out. 67 Benefi ts of tobacco control in diff erent scenarios would be 23-81% smaller for men and 84-94% smaller for women if the relative risks for eff ects of smoking on COPD and lung cancer do not rise signifi cantly after the peak of the smoking epidemic (webfi gure 6). The eff ects of all other sensitivity analyses on the number of averted deaths from COPD and lung cancer were less than 11% for the combined eff ects of smoking and solid-fuel use, and less than 18% for the eff ects of individual risk factors.",

These analyses show that the largest source of uncertainty for the tuberculosis model is the future trend of transmission parameter, which depends on how sociodemographic change aff ects the patterns of contact and other determinants of transmission in China. If factors such as higher population density and increased travel increase the number of contacts that lead to tuberculosis transmission, the transmission parameter might not continue its expected decline. In this case, reducing smoking and indoor air pollution will have an even greater eff ect on tuberculosis control than estimated. For example, if the transmission parameter in Jiangsu doubles over the next 30 years, the benefi ts of the diff erent scenarios of smoking, solid-fuel use would be 58-77% greater than the original analysis in fi gure 4. Multiparameter uncertainty analysis showed the interquartile range of the estimated eff ects was within 14-33% of its central value in all provinces and in all scenarios of DOTS, smoking, and solid-fuel use. Finally, the causal link between smoking and tuberculosis is based on a larger number of epidemiological studies than that of indoor air pollution from solid-fuel use. If the causal eff ect on tuberculosis were only from smoking, the benefi ts of reducing exposure would be smaller than those in fi gure 4, by 19-37% for diff erent scenarios in Jiangsu, by 23-32% in Guizhou, and by 9-13% in Shanghai. In addition to the above sources of uncertainty, fundamentally new technologies for early detection and treatment of chronic diseases could signifi cantly aff ect future burden. Discovery and large-scale use of such technologies over the duration of our analysis are less likely for COPD, but cannot be ruled out for lung cancer and tuberculosis. Finally, relative risks from meta-analyses may not be generalisable to population-level eff ects; nevertheless, such estimation is necessary and indispensable to inform policy making.",

In China, in 2003 passive smoking was responsible for an estimated 17 000 and 7000 deaths from COPD and lung cancer, respectively, among men (compared with 412 000 and 170 000 from direct smoking) and 126 000 and 25 000 deaths among women (compared with 113 000 and 16 000) because substantially more women are non-smokers and exposed to passive smoking 33 (webappendix 2). The quantitative evidence on the eff ects of passive smoking on tuberculosis is more limited, although a causal eff ect is likely. 5 Ambient urban air pollution, which in China might be partly due to household solid-fuel use, was responsible for an estimated 32 000 lung cancer deaths and 317 000 cardiopulmonary deaths in the Western Pacifi c region in 2000 (no independent eff ects on COPD were estimated for ambient urban air pollution) and selected occupational exposures for an estimated 34 000 lung cancer deaths and 161 000 COPD deaths in the same region. 4 The eff ect of ambient air pollution on tuberculosis has not been investigated in epidemiological studies.",

            "text": "Infectious and chronic respiratory diseases, smoking, and indoor air pollution are either already concentrated or increasingly prevalent in developing countries. In addition to their disease burden, these diseases have large and inequitable household and societal economic burden associated with health-care costs, reduced labour-market participation, and decreased accumulation of human capital, described in detail elsewhere for China and for other developing countries. [68] [69] [70] [71] [72] Our results show that reducing common risk factors could have a substantial eff ect on future burden of COPD and lung cancer, and be an important contributor to tuberculosis control. Our fi ndings have several potential policy and programme implications at the national, community, household, or individual levels. At the national level, our results on the projected burden of disease from COPD and lung cancer alone reinforce the need for regulatory and economic policies that reduce smoking and promote clean household energy sources in China. Tuberculosis control however cannot rely on risk-factor reduction as its main intervention, and the core of national or regional tuberculosis control programmes should remain interventions that can reduce and eventually interrupt transmission under generalisable circumstances, currently DOTS. Nonetheless, at the community level, some interventions could increase the coverage or community eff ectiveness of others. For example, case detection and treatment completion under DOTS in China have been constrained by limitations of physical and human infrastructure, fi nancial factors, and compliance, especially in rural areas and marginalised social groups. [73] [74] [75] [76] Low-income or marginalised communities could be enrolled in programmes that provide cleaner fuels or stoves and nutritional supplements, conditional on periodic tuberculosis tests and DOTS treatment completion. At the individual level, tobacco cessation can be added to tuberculosis treatment, possibly with fi nancial incentives. 77, 78 If multiple interventions are implemented, the management structure of DOTS, including its standardised approach to registration, recording, and reporting of enrolled individuals (or households) and their status in receiving intervention, can strengthen planning and implementation of interventions for indoor air pollution and smoking. 79 Tobacco taxes might also be used to subsidise DOTS, clean energy technology, and nutrition for low-income households that take part in integrated programmes. An important next step would be a policy dialogue between the diff erent economic, energy, and health-sector agencies in China as well as community-based intervention studies that assess the eff ectiveness of combining risk factor interventions with tuberculosis case fi nding and treatment under actual conditions of implementation.",
