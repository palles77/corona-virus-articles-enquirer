It has been reported that SERCA2a and PLN expressed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) not only are translatable to the myocardial setting, but also significantly decrease in dogs with degenerative mitral valve disease. The aim of this study is to clarify how effectively the target genes reflect hemodynamic overload, a primary determinant of myocardial distress.",

In paired comparison between pre-and post-operation, their expression levels significantly increased one week after surgical correction in both PDA (0.74 AE 0.22 for SERCA2a and 0.68 AE 0.24 for PLN) and PS (0.74 AE 0.18 for SERCA2a and 0.65 AE 0.20 for PLN).

However, the pleural fluid BNP-POC test is of limited clinical utility, since a positive result is a non-diagnostic finding due to low specificity, although a negative result helps rule out cardiac causes of pleural effusion. There is evidence in human patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) that therapy designed to achieve a certain reduction in N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) improves outcomes. In one previous study, dogs with CHF that experienced lower NT-proBNP following conventional therapy survived longer than those with persistently high measurements. It is unknown whether it is possible to purposely change plasma NT-proBNP concentration by adjusting medical therapy in dogs. The aim of the present study was to determine whether a prespecified therapeutic algorithm would result in reductions in plasma NT-proBNP concentration in dogs with chronic CHF secondary to MMVD.",

Loading condition should be considered when evaluating the left atrial phasic function by indices derived from left atrial phasic sizes. This study aimed to evaluate noninvasive values of +dP/dt and -dP/dt in dogs in different stages of chronic mitral valve disease (CMVD), and to correlate these values with systolic and diastolic echocardiographic indexes of left ventricular function. A crosssectional prospective observational clinical study of 36 dogs with CMVD was performed; 11 patients were in stage B1 and 9 in stage B2 without congestive heart failure (CHF) and 16 in stage C with CHF. Physical exam, systolic arterial blood pressure, thoracic radiography, electrocardiogram and transthoracic echocardiography were obtained. Dogs in CHF presented lower +dP/dt (2461 mmHg/s, P 25 -P 75 = 2065-3177, P = 0.0292) and -dP/dt (931.7 mmHg/s, P 25 -P 75 = 742.2-1141, P = 0.0053) compared to those without CHF (+dP/dt=3085 mmHg/s, P 25 -P 75 = 2560-4309; -dP/dt=1393 mmHg/s, P 25 -P 75 = 974.3-2144), despite the fact that ejection fraction and fractional shortening were not different. Values of -dP/dt were correlated with diastolic indexes, as IVRT (r = 0.3821; P = 0.0235), E/IVRT (r = -0.5093, P = 0.0019), E wave (r = -0.4548; P = 0.0060) and %LVDd (r = 0.6679; P < 0.0001). Both -dP/dt and +dP/dt were negatively correlated with LA/Ao ratio (r = 0.6476; P < 0.0001 and r = -0.4619; P = 0.006). It was concluded that -dP/dt can be a complementary index to assess diastolic function in dogs with CMVD. In this study, +dP/dt was more efficient detecting impairment of systolic function than the routinely used indexes, possibly due to a lower load dependence. Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) is a common congenital heart defect usually diagnosed and closed in young dogs due to a poor long-term prognosis.

With reduced heart rate, transmitral flow waveforms may separate. Detection of diastolic dysfunction can aid in the early detection of cardiomyopathies. Timolol, an ophthalmic, nonselective beta-blocker used in cats with glaucoma is demonstrated to be safe and transiently decrease heart rate in clinical trials. Here we hypothesize that topical timolol ophthalmic suspension will decrease heart rate and allow E and A wave separation during echocardiogram, without significant adverse effects.

Each dog was classified into one of eight major groups: Normal (n = 35); inconsequential mitral and/or aortic valve insufficiencies (n = 28); IWH type DCM with AF (n = 10); AF with equivocal IWH Type DCM (n = 1); equivocal elevations in left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) velocities (1.7-2.25 m/sec.) (n = 7); presence of ventricular arrhythmias (VPCs) with normal echocardiogram (n = 7); lone AF (n = 1); and chemodectoma (n = 1). NT-proBNP and cTnI levels were run on all 90 dogs and the results are summarized below. Based on 35 normal dogs in this study, reference interval upper limits for NT-proBNP and cTnI were calculated at 2937pmol/L and 0.99 ng/mL, respectively. NT-proBNP and cTnI correlated well with cardiac disease in a small sampling of cardiac diseased Irish Wolfhounds and showed significant differences between groups by Kruskal-Wallis test (P < 0.0001 and P = 0.0007, respectively). NT-proBNP shows promise as a screening tool for differentiating the presence of equivocal or overt DCM/AF from the absence of DCM/AF in the Irish Wolfhound (AUC = 0.967 by ROC) but is likely to be significantly increased in the absence of DCM for dogs with lone AF. Lesser potential was exhibited by cTnI (AUC = 0.783 by ROC) as a screening tool for IWH-type DCM. Follow-up studies with both echocardiography and ECG on the Irish Wolfhounds found to have either elevated NTproBNP and/or cTnI along with normal echocardiography/ECG will be required to determine if NT-proBNP may have a predictive factor for the development of overt cardiomyopathy and/or atrial fibrillation in this breed of dog. Arterial thromboembolism (ATE) is a common and devastating complication of feline cardiovascular disease. There is limited evidence supporting the efficacy of traditional strategies for ATE prophylaxis in cats. Apixiban is a novel oral factor Xa inhibitor that is superior to warfarin in preventing stroke or systemic embolism in people with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. Apixaban is FDA approved for this indication as well as for the treatment and secondary prophylaxis of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) in people. Preliminary pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) data for a single oral dose of pure apixaban in cats were obtained during a previous study at Colorado State University. However, multidose PK and PD data using the commercially available tablet are needed. The purposes of this study were to obtain PK and PD data after multi-dose oral administration of the commercially available apixaban tablet and to establish appropriate oral dose and dosing intervals for this formulation. Additionally, side effects associated with multi-dose administration were documented.",

Furthermore, PD data in these cats showed cyclical inhibition of FXa activity that is typical of novel oral anticoagulant drugs and a property that is considered important for their safety profile. PK data from this pilot study showed a lack of drug accumulation and a consistent elimination half-life between the first and last oral doses at approximately 2.5 hours.

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) in the cat is difficult to easily and rapidly detect in clinical practice by physical examination in both sub clinically and clinically affected cats. Auscultation of the heart is insensitive for the diagnosis even in clinically affected cats. A rapid and reliable diagnosis is desirable before decisions on e.g.: sedation/anesthesia, therapy of acute dyspnea, or screening for breeding purposes. Standard diagnostic tools such as echocardiography, radiography or sampling of blood for analysis of biomarkers are time consuming, not always affordable, or unavailable. A simple, rapid and easily available method to diagnose HCM would be beneficial for many clinicians and clients. Electrocardiographic abnormalities are reported in both subclinical and clinically affected cats. A simple electrocardiographic instrument would simplify the detection of these.

The heart was located by auscultation and the middle of the telephone placed over the point of maximal heart sounds. This to ensure that the electrodes were placed one cranial to the heart base and one distal to the heart apex. All ECGs recorded in the iPhone (iPECG) were stored and read blindly later after magnification on the screen of the iPhone. Cats with QRS duration >0.04 sec on both iPECG and StECG were categorized as abnormal. Comparison of iPECG and StECG revealed that only 2 of 17 of the normal cats had QRS duration >0.04s on ECG, producing two false positives using iPECG. On iPECG 8 of 23 cats had QRS duration >0.04s, including all 6 cats positive for HCM on echocardiography (sensitivity = 1.0, specificity = 0.83, j = 0.8). StECG lead II with cut off QRS duration of 0.04s to detect HCM produced 1 false negative and 1 false positive (sensitivity = 0.83, specificity = 0.94, j = 0.77).

QTc was calculated using Bazett's (QTc= QT/\u221aRR) and Fridericia's (QTc=QT/ 3 \u221aRR) equations, with RR and QT intervals obtained from lead II. QT dispersion (Qt max -QT min ) was calculated among 10 leads (I, II, III, aVR, aVL, aVF, rV 2 (CV 5 RL), V 2 (CV 6 LL), V 3 (CV 6 LU) and V 10 at 50 mm/s). QTc was significantly prolonged in pyometra dogs when calculated by Bazett 0 s equation (QTc control =264.5 AE 24.1 ms vs QTc pyom =277.4 AE 21.6 ms; P = 0.038), while QTc calculated by Fridericia 0 s equation and QT dispersion were not significantly different. The prolonged QTc in pyometra dogs, evaluated by Bazett 0 s equation, suggests increased susceptibility to arrhythmias in this group. The lack of difference when using Fridericia 0 s equation must be better evaluated in larger samples, and these variables should be assessed in a prospective study, including the outcome of arrhythmia occurence during and after surgery. Dogs with myxomatous mitral valve disease (MMVD) in Class C of the congestive heart failure (CHF) show clinical signs along the progression of the disease, changes in the size of the heart chambers, rhythm cardiac, heart rate, participation of the autonomic system.",

However, further studies with more animals trained over a longer period of time might clarify whether exercise might play a beneficial role in sympathetic-parasympathetic balance in dogs with cardiac diseases. Circulating omega-3 fatty acid concentrations are decreased in dogs with congestive heart failure (CHF) and supplementation of omega-3 fatty acids has some benefits in people and dogs with cardiac disease. Cats with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), however, have higher serum concentrations of docosahexanoic acid (DHA) and total omega-3 fatty acids. This raises the question of whether omega-3 fatty acid supplementation would be beneficial in cats with cardiac disease. Therefore, the goal of this study was to determine if serum omega-3 fatty acid concentrations are related to survival time in cats with HCM. Cats with HCM from which serum fatty acid profiles were available and outcome was known were eligible for the study. Cats were excluded if they had significant concurrent disease (e.g., cancer, diabetes, chronic kidney disease) or were receiving fish oil supplementation. Echocardiography was performed on all cats. Serum fatty acid analysis was performed using chloroform methanol extraction and gas chromatography. Fatty acids were categorized as \"high\" if they were \u2265 the median for the group and \"low\" if they were < the median for the group. Date of death was determined by contacting the owner or the primary care veterinarian. This study was approved by the Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine at Tufts University Clinical Studies Review Committee. Kaplan-Meier curves and log-rank tests were used to compare survival times between cats with high vs low omega-3 fatty acid concentrations using commercial statistical software. 25 cats with HCM were eligible for the study. Median age was 8 years (range, 1-16 years), with 20 castrated males and 5 spayed females. Breeds included 14 domestic shorthairs, 5 domestic longhairs, 3 Persians, 2 Ragdolls, and 1 Himalayan. Initial presentation was CHF (n = 16), arterial thromboembolism (ATE; n = 2), and asymptomatic (n = 7). Median survival time was 688 days (range, 2-4043 days). 9 cats were still alive at the time of analysis. Serum eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and DHA concentrations were not significantly different between cats with and without CHF or cats with and without ATE. Cats with CHF (P = 0.007) or ATE (P = 0.02) had significantly shorter survival times compared to asymptomatic cats. Cats with a high EPA concentrations had a significantly longer survival time compared to cats with a low serum EPA concentration (P = 0.04). There was no significant difference in survival times between cats with high vs low DHA concentrations. Results of this retrospective study suggest that supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids, particularly EPA, may have benefits in cats with HCM, but prospective studies are needed. The aim of this study was to compare the clinical efficacy and safety between angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) imidapril and ramipril in dogs with myxomatous mitral valve disease (MMVD).",

Moreover, the results indicate that imidapril is not inferior to the earlier ACEI ramipril, and treatment with the imidapril is well-tolerated. Myxomatous mitral valve disease (MMVD) is the most common acquired canine heart disease, characterized by various severities of clinical signs from asymptomatic state to sudden death. Because of potential deleterious consequences and high prevalence of MMVD in veterinary medicine, it is important to detect progression of the disease early and accurately. Of tools for evaluation of myocardial function, tissue Doppler imaging (TDI) and strain imaging were relatively recent technique and independent of load conditions compared with conventional echocardiography. Although valuations of TDI and strain imaging have been performed in MMVD dogs, the classification was quite broad to examine changes with progression of the disease. Therefore, we sought to investigate the alterations of TDI and strain imaging in MMVD dogs with different stages divided into 4 groups. In addition, we aimed to investigate the correlation between variables of conventional echocardiographic, and TDI and strain imaging examination.",

Radial strain and strain rate seemed decreased with severity. Longitudinal motions showed systolic and diastolic TDI and strain variables increased to moderate stage (class II or IIIa) and decreased in severe stage. Intra-ventricular dyssynchrony, measured as difference in time-to-peak between LV and IVS, was observed in MMVD dogs with high prevalence. Dyssynchrony among segments in each wall was also revealed in MMVD dogs. Left atrial to aortic ratio was positively correlated to mitral E wave to peak early diastolic velocity in the LV basal segment (E/Em), and fractional shortening (FS) and ejection fraction (EF) was positively correlated to radial strain. Mitral E wave velocity was negatively correlated to LV systolic time-to-peak and strain time-to-peak. Circumferential variables had no significant correlations to conventional echocardiographic variables. Coccygeal arterial blood pressure measurement is better tolerated than radial arterial measurement in cats, but discordant results are common. The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of age, body condition score (BCS), and muscle condition score (MCS) on radial and coccygeal blood pressure measurements.",

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is the most important feline heart disease and it is characterized by ventricular hypertrophy in absence of dilated left ventricle. In humans, the prevalence is 1 to 500 individuals and the familial HCM occurs in at least 60% of cases. There are more than 1400 mutations in more than 11 sarcomeres genes related to HCM. In some families of cats, HCM is an autosomal dominant genetic disease very similar to the human HCM. A mutation in myosin binding protein C gene (MYBPC3) is observed in Maine Coon cats with HCM. In Ragdoll cats, HCM is associated with a mutation in the same gene, but in a different codon highly conserved in feline species. In other breeds such as Persian, British Shorthair and Norwegian Forest there is also evidence of familial HCM, but the type of genetic inheritance is unknown.

Two-dimensional (2D) echocardiography has been widely used for years to assess left ventricle (LV) systolic function. However, there are some limitations by using the conventional measurement of LV ejection fraction (EF). Two-dimensional speckle tracking imaging is a simplified and angle-independent echocardiographic tool which has been recently used for the evaluation of the quantitative global and regional ventricular functions. Syngo Velocity Vector Imaging (VVI) is a speckle tracking-based method for direct analysis of myocardial motion. The purpose of this study was to investigate the left ventricle systolic function (septal, free wall and global) by using VVI in healthy awake Beagle dogs.",

Animals were restrained in right lateral recumbency and echocardiographic evaluation was performed (Acuson X300 Premium Edition, Siemens Medical Solutions USA, Inc.). Echocardiographic clips were obtained in right parasternal short-axis LV with papillary muscles view and evaluated offline at VVI software (Syngo \u00d2 Velocity Vector Imaging TM , Siemens Medical Solutions). Once a reliable endocardial tracing over a single frame was manually drawn, endocardial borders were automatically tracked throughout the cardiac cycle. Accuracy of border tracking was visually confirmed by viewing the cardiac cycle in slow-motion while only border information was displayed. Systole was manually selected by moving the left and the right cursor to the onset of the QRS complex and the end of T wave, respectively. For each dog, the mean result of 3 consecutive cardiac cycles was used. Besides LV global peak systolic circumferential strain (St) time to peak (TPK) and mean value of peak systolic circumferential strain rate (SR), we also considered values obtained at the ventricular septum and the LV free wall. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is often performed in dogs following cardiopulmonary arrest. In patients with pulseless electrical activity (PEA) or asystole, intravenous therapy with vasoactive medications, such as epinephrine or vasopressin is currently recommended. During CPR, catheter placement may be challenging, and due to concurrent chest compressions, placement in the saphenous vein (SV) may be technically easier. In critically ill dogs, with pre-existing catheters in place, any readily accessible catheter may be chosen. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the time to reach the heart following intravenous administration of contrast material in the SV, the cephalic vein (CV) or jugular vein.",

This is the first study describing morphometric and echo measures in cats in the 1 st year of life. Further research is needed to investigate a possible association between growth rate at young age and development of cardiac pathology later in life. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of dantrolene (DAN) and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in acute spinal cord injury (SCI). Sixty three-months-old male Wistar rats were divided into five groups: MSCs; MSCs + DAN; DAN; positive control (PC) (trauma and placebo); and negative control (NC) (no trauma + placebo). All procedures were performed according to the principles adopted by the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and by the Ethics Committee on Animal Use (CEUA-UFMG -protocol number 46/2012). Laminectomy was performed at T12 level in all animals, followed by a weight-drop model of SCI, except for the NC group. One hour later, the MSCs + DAN and DAN groups received 10 mg/kg of DAN intraperitoneally and after 7 days, the MSCs and MSCs + DAN groups received 1x10 6 MSCs intravenously. At those times, other groups received the same volume of placebo. Basso, Beattie, Bresnahan (BBB) scale was performed for 30 days to access neurological status. Spinal cords were evaluated through H.E. histology, immunohistochemistry (anti-NeuN) and qRT -PCR to assess quantitative gene expression of neurotrophic factors (BDNF and NT-3), antiapoptotic (Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl) and proapoptotic proteins (caspase-3, caspase-9 and Bax), four milimiters rostral and caudal to the epicenter of the lesion. Traumatized animals showed paraplegia. There was a significant neurological recovery in groups CTM and CTM + DAN from the 22 th and 25 th days, respectively (p < 0.05) compared to CP. There was severe spinal cord injury characterized by axonal degeneration and neuronal loss, which extended rostrocaudally from epicenter. All groups showed average number of NeuN-positive neurons significantly higher when compared to CP (p < 0.05). The SCI in PC group resulted in reduced BDNF, NT-3 and Bcl-xl gene expression, and increased Bax and caspase-3 expression compared to non-traumatized rats (NC). After treatments, there was a significant increasing in BDNF expression in MSCs, MSCs + DAN and DAN groups compared to PC group (p < 0.05). The NT-3 expression was higher in MSCs + DAN and DAN groups in cranial segments (p < 0.05), and DAN group in the caudal ones (p < 0.01). The Bax expression was significantly lower in the MSCs + DAN (p < 0.05) and DAN (p < 0.001). The caspase-3 and 9 expression were significantly lower in DAN, MSCs and MSCs + DAN groups (p < 0.05). It was concluded that DAN, MSCs or both in association promote functional recovery and neuroprotection through neurotrophic and antiapoptotic effects. In the 1970s a syndrome of early onset weakness and exercise intolerance was described in Jack Russell Terrier (JRT) puppies by Palmer and Lennon. A positive response to an edrophonium chloride challenge was noted, a decremental response of the compound muscle action potential (CMAP) to repetitive supramaximal nerve stimulation supported a disorder of neuromuscular transmission, and an end-plate deficiency of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR) was confirmed. Recently, two intact male 7 week-old JRTs were presented to the Ontario Veterinary College for evaluation of generalized weakness. Similar to the original JRTs, a positive response to edrophonium chloride, a decremental response of the CMAP to repetitive nerve stimulation, and end-plate AChR deficiency were identified.",

The purpose of the study was to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of zonisamide administered per rectum via commercially available encapsulated powder mixed with either sterile water or polyethylene glycol and to determine whether a dose of 20 mg/kg or 30 mg/kg would result in target serum concentrations (10-40 mcg/mL). Eight healthy mixed-breed dogs were randomly assigned to 4 groups of 2 dogs each in a crossover-design study. Zonisamide was administered rectally in a suspension with sterile water or polyethylene glycol at a dose of 20 mg/kg or 30 mg/kg, and blood samples were collected at predetermined time points. After a 7-day washout period, each group received an alternate treatment until all groups had received all treatments. Serum concentrations of zonisamide were analyzed via high-performance liquid chromatography. Serum concentrations of zonisamide were within the targeted range at > 1 time point after rectal administration in only 2 dogs. These concentrations were reached after 3 hours (n = 1 dog) or 6 hours (n = 1 dog). In the remaining 6 dogs, serum concentrations of zonisamide were below the target range at all time points. On the basis of these results, rectal administration of 20 mg/kg or 30 mg/kg of zonisamide via a sterile water or polyethylene glycol suspension used in the present study cannot be recommended.

Feline dysautonomia (FD) is a disease of domestic cats characterised by extensive degeneration of the autonomic nervous system. It was first reported in 1982 in the UK but has now also been reported in the USA, UAE, New Zealand, and several European countries. The aetiology of this condition remains unknown but it has clinical and pathological similarities to primary dysautonomias affecting dogs, hares, rabbits, and horses. FD has been reported to cause a variety of clinical signs including reduced tear secretion, dry oral mucosa, dry nasal planum, mydriasis, prolapsed nictitating membranes, bradycardia, regurgitation and oesophageal dysmotility, constipation, proprioceptive deficits, dysuria, and anal areflexia. Clinical signs typically develop over a matter of days and less than a third of affected cats have survived. Diagnosis is by demonstration of chromatolytic change within neurons in autonomic ganglia but a clinical scoring system (CSS) and ocular pharmacological tests (OPT) have been proposed for ante-mortem diagnosis [Sharp NJH, Gookin JL (1995) BSAVA Manual of small animal neurology 2 nd Ed; 179-188]. OPT have included a reduction in pupil size within 15 minutes of topical application of 0.1% pilocarpine or retraction of prolapsed nictitating membrane within 15 minutes of topical application of 1:10,000 Epinephrine. The UK FD study group has investigated suspected cases of FD within the UK reported to us by veterinarians. We have used this data to assess the proposed CSS and the ocular pharmacological tests.",

After confirmation of the disc space, we made 19 or 23 mm skin incision, located spinal process of the vertebrae and removed it with Luer Rongeur. Puncture needle was installed at 45 degree to the base of removed spinal process and then sequential dilators are used for bloodless access to the bone. After surgical field is exposed, we installed a throacar with 360 degree rotating head. The throacar and the rotating head are used allow endoscope movement down to the spinal canal for the surgical field visualization. From this point on, the surgery is guided by continuous endoscopic vision. Remnant muscle tissues are removed with forceps and bleeding is stopped with bipolar electrocautery. Shaver is used for drilling the bone, with irrigator and suction used to remove bone particles. Kerrison's rounger is used to widen the entrance into the spinal canal. Extruded disc material is grasped with a forceps and removed from the spinal canal. Spinal cord is evaluated via endoscopic visualization. Two adjacent disc spaces were fenestrated before closure of the surgical wound. All dogs became ambulatory after surgery, 9 dogs return to normal gait between day 2 and day 9 post operatively.

Riluzole and dantrolene has been shown to be neuroprotective by reducing neuronal apoptosis after brain and spinal cord injury in several animal models of neurological disorders. In this study, we investigated the effects of the association of riluzole and dantrolene on experimental spinal cord injury (SCI). Twenty-nine Wistar rats were laminectomized at T12 and divided in five groups: GI (n = 6) underwent laminectomy alone and was treated with placebo. GII (n = 6) underwent laminectomy followed by SCI and was treated with placebo. GIII (n = 5) underwent laminectomy followed by SCI and was treated with riluzole and placebo 15 min and 1 h after laminectomy, respectively. GIV (n = 6) underwent laminectomy followed by SCI and was treated with placebo and dantrolene 15 min and 1 h after laminectomy, respectively. GV (n = 6) underwent laminectomy followed by SCI and was treated with riluzole and dantrolene 15 min and 1 h after laminectomy, respectively. A compressive trauma was performed to induce SCI. After euthanasia, the spinal cord was evaluated using light microscopy, TUNEL staining and immunochemistry with anti-NeuN. All procedures were performed according to the principles adopted by the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and by the Ethics Committee on Animal Use (CEUA-UFMGprotocol number 186/ 2010). Animals treated with the association of riluzole and dantrolene showed a larger number of NeuN-positive neurons adjacent to the epicenter of injury (P \u2264 0,05). Furthermore, the TUNEL staining was similar between animals treated with riluzole and dantrole and those that did not receive spinal cord trauma (P > 0,05). These results showed that riluzole and dantrolene protects spinal cord tissue after traumatic SCI by decreasing apoptotic cell death, especially when used in association. Zonisamide (ZNS) and levetiracetam (LEV) are utilized with increasing frequency as first-line anticonvulsant medications in dogs with epilepsy, but little information is available regarding their use. The purpose of this study was to evaluate clinical outcome in idiopathic epileptic dogs administered ZON or LEV monotherapy, and compare this to dogs on phenobarbital (PB) monotherapy. Medical records from 2003-2013 were retrospectively searched for dogs diagnosed with idiopathic epilepsy administered either ZON, LEV or PB monotherapy. Information on duration of therapy, adverse effects, and outcome was collected from medical records, referring veterinarians, and owner questionnaire. A total of 121 cases were included; 16 dogs on LEV, 40 dogs on ZON, and 65 dogs on PB. Dogs in the PB group were younger at the time of the first seizure compared to the LEV and ZON groups (p = 0.05). Mean duration of therapy was similar between groups (437, 583, and 488 days for LEV, ZON, and PB, respectively). For dogs alive at the time of writing, the PB group was more likely to still be on monotherapy than the LEV or ZON groups (p = 0.04). Seizure frequency was the most common reason for monotherapy failure in all groups. The incidence of adverse effects was higher in the PB group (78%) compared to the LEV (17%) or ZON groups (36%) (p = 0.0001), although the incidence of sedation was similar. These results suggest that when compared to PB, ZNS and LEV monotherapy are associated with fewer adverse effects in dogs, although add-on therapy might be required sooner. The purpose of this retrospective study was to describe the use and efficacy of a midazolam continuous rate infusion (CRI) in dogs with cluster seizures (CS) or status epilepticus (SE).",

The main objectives of this study were 1-to propose an objective method for the determination of ideal implant placement in the atlantoaxial joint, 2-to develop a mathematical model allowing calculation of implants 3D position and 3-to assess the validity of the mathematical model. Current literature on atlantoaxial anatomy and ventral atlantoaxial stabilization techniques was reviewed to identify safe bone corridors. Each bone corridor was geometrically simplified and ideal implant placements defined as axes centered within the simplified corridor. CT images of the craniocervical junction were obtained in 27 dogs and each previously defined ideal implant was positioned using OsiriX. For each implant an insertion point, an exit point and 4 safety margin points were localized. Mathematical equations calculating 2 projected angles (ProjA) and 4 safety angles (SafA) from those point coordinates were determined. A sample of 12 simulated implants was randomly selected and each angle was mathematically calculated and compared to direct measurements obtained with OsiriX measurement tools (2 observers x 2 repeats). 9 bone corridors and 13 ideal implant placements could be objectively defined. OsiriX could be used successfully to simulate the ideal implant positions in all cases. There was excellent agreement between the calculated and measured values for both ProjA (q c =0.9992) and SafA (q c =0.9997). Absolute differences between calculated and measured values were respectively [Pro-jA=0.44 AE 0.53\u00b0; SafA=0.27 AE 0.25\u00b0] and [ProjA=0.26 AE 0.21\u00b0; SafA=0.18 AE 0.18\u00b0], for each observer.",

Overall survival with traditional chemotherapy in this disease has not improved for many years, and so additional research into new therapeutic targets is needed.

            "text": "(VCS Award Winner): Platinum compounds, including cisplatin (CDDP), are highly active anticancer agents for use against solid tumors. Like most chemotherapeutics, platinum compounds are toxic to non-tumor tissues and development of unwanted side effects, including neuropathy and nephrotoxicity, often limits treatment dose and duration. Mechanisms of these side effects, particularly neurotoxicity, are undefined. However, accumulation of platinum in spinal cord tissues is associated with development of neuropathy. Remarkably, the clinical and histologic features of CDDPinduced neurotoxicity are similar to those seen in vitamin E (aT) deficiency. Using a preclinical model of epithelial ovarian cancer we tested the hypothesis that adjuvant aT would improve CDDP antitumor efficacy while reducing CDDP-induced oxidative stress and non-tumor toxicity. Tumor-bearing immune competent female rats received one of 4 treatment regimens: (1) saline (2X/ week), (2) aT (2X/week), (3) CDDP (2X/week), or (4) CDDP + aT (2X/week). All regimens were administered for a period of 4.5 weeks. At necropsy, tumor burden was reduced to undetectable levels in 10/16 CDDP + aT treated rats compared to 2/16 rats treated with CDDP alone. CDDP decreased indices of tumor proliferation (measured by Ki-67 immunohistochemistry) by 28% (p < 0.05), while CDDP + aT decreased tumor proliferation by >75% (p < 0.01), compared to saline. Importantly, adjuvant aT decreased accumulation of platinum in spinal cord tissue by >30% (p < 0.05) without altering tumor platinum levels, compared to rats treated with CDDP alone. Interestingly, the presence of tumors in saline treated rats increased plasma F2isoprostane and F2-isoprostane metabolite levels 40%, compared to non-tumor controls; aT (with or without CDDP) returned these levels to those of non-tumor controls. Finally, adjuvant aT prevented CDDP-induced plasma and tissue aT depletion. These data are the first to document the ability of adjuvant aT to (1) improve chemotherapeutic antitumor efficacy, (2) decrease tumor proliferation, and (3) improve antioxidant/oxidative stress status in an immune competent tumor-bearing animal. Further elucidation of the ability of adjuvant aT to improve antitumor efficacy and quality of life outcomes is essential for development of improved treatment regimens for both human and veterinary patients. During the last 20 years, the survival times in dogs with osteosarcoma (OSA) treated with surgery and postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy has not changed. Therefore, new treatment approaches are needed. The antiangiogenic chemotherapy hypothesis proposes that tumors cannot growth more tan a few millimeters without recruiting blood vessels that will supply oxygen and nutrients to the neoplastic cells. One of the major players in the new blood vessel growth is vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF).

Emily Rout 1 , Robert Burnett 1 , Courtney Abbott 1 , Stacey George 1 , Anne Avery 1 . 1 Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO, USA Canine B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is common in dogs and shares many features with human CLL. In human CLL, immunoglobulin (Ig) gene usage and mutation status are important markers for disease behavior, but these factors have not been assessed in canine B-CLL. We sequenced the immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region (VH) genes from neoplastic peripheral blood B cells in 45 dogs with B-CLL. Thirteen VH genes were used. Excluding the Boxer breed, the most commonly used genes were VH1-44, VH1-62, and VH1-35. In non-neoplastic B cells, VH1-44 and VH1-62 are the most commonly used genes. 59% of all genes used in the B-CLL patients had greater than 2% mutations compared to germline sequence and were classified as mutated, while 41% were unmutated. Of the cases using VH1-44, one third used an unmutated gene. All the cases using VH1-62 and VH1-35 used mutated genes. VH1-41 is overrepresented in Boxers with B-CLL, but is not preferentially used in Boxers with other B-cell neoplasms. Of 8 Boxer dogs with B-CLL that were sequenced, 6 used an unmutated VH1-41 gene. These findings suggest that antigen selection may play a role in the pathogenesis of B-CLL in Boxers. These data lay the foundation to correlate VH gene usage and mutation status with outcome in dogs, further establish canine patients as good models of human CLL, and identify groups, like the Boxers, that may be useful in studying the pathogenesis of CLL. Imatinib has potent anti-tumor activity against canine mast cell tumor (MCT) carrying c-kit mutation. Although the tumors initially respond well to imatinib, they eventually develop resistance. Here, molecular mechanisms that confer imatinib resistance to neoplastic mast cells were investigated using an imatinib-sensitive canine neoplastic mast cell line VI-MC carrying a KIT c.1523A>T activating mutation. Two imatinib-resistant sublines were established by culturing VI-MC cells in increasing concentrations of imatinib (1 \uf06dM-resistant, rVI-MC1; 10 \uf06dM-resistant, rVI-MC10). Both sublines had a second KIT mutation c.2443G>C. Recombinant KIT with the second mutation was insensitive to 1 \uf06dM but sensitive to 10 \uf06dM imatinib. The effect of imatinib on the phosphorylation of KIT and its downstream signalling proteins was then examined using these sublines. KIT and ERK were constitutively phosphorylated in both sublines and their phosphorylation was suppressed by 10 \uf06dM imatinib in rVI-MC1 cells. However, KIT but not ERK phosphorylation was supressed in rVI-MC10 cells. The phosphorylation of ERK in rVI-MC10 cells was also not diminished by the Src family kinase (SFK) inhibitor dasatinib. This second mutation in KIT may play an important role for imatinib resistance in neoplastic mast cells. Furthermore, KIT/SFK-independent activation of ERK would be involved in imatinib resistance when the neoplastic cells are exposed to higher concentrations of imatinib. Gemcitabine is an antimetabolite chemotherapy agent with clinical activity against a number of human malignancies. Gemcitabine is activated to its cytotoxic triphosphate form (dFdCTP) and in a concentration-dependent manner, competes for incorporation into the DNA and induces apoptosis. Whereas intracellular accumulation of dFdCTP is schedule dependent and relies on achieving and maintaining optimal extracellular plasma concentrations (10-20 \uf06dm), excess gemcitabine plasma concentrations inhibit the critical activation process. There is no current standard dosing scheme for the use of gemcitabine in feline patients with cancer.",

Metformin is used for management of non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus in humans. Clinical evidence suggests patients taking metformin have a reduced lifetime incidence of cancer.

The purpose of this study was to compare lomustine content in FDA approved and compounded capsules. The a priori acceptance range was 90-110% of the stated capsule content. Capsules were obtained from an FDA approved manufacturer (Next-Source Biotechnology) and 3 national (USA) compounding pharmacies at 10 mg and 40 mg capsules or the nearest available content. Replicates of 5 capsules per source and strength were assessed by validated high pressure liquid chromatography with ultraviolet detection method. Contents of capsules were emptied individually into methanol to yield a stated concentration of 1 mg/mL, vortexed for 30 seconds and sonicated for 10 minutes. The samples were then vortexed, centrifuged and further diluted in 50% methanol to a final stated concentration of 50 lg/mL. The lomustine concentration was determined by comparing to a standard curve in 50% methanol. The FDA approved capsules had 100% of the capsules for both strengths within 90-110% of stated content. Compounder A had 60% and 0% of 11 mg and 42 mg capsules, respectively within 90-110%. Compounder B had 20% and 0% of 10 mg and 40 mg capsules, respectively within 90-110%. Compounder C had 60% and 0% of 7 mg and 48 mg capsules, respectively within 90-110%. All product failures were <90% of stated content. In conclusion, compounded lomustine capsules failed to have the stated amount of drug, but the FDA approved formulation contained the stated amount of drug. The clinical implications of using compounded lomustine may include treatment failures and increased risk of tumor resistance. Alimentary lymphoma is a common neoplasia in cats and systemic chemotherapy is indicated for the treatment. Although most of cats can achieve a complete remission with chemotherapy, relapse can be associated to the multidrug resistance, that occurs with the use of cytotoxic agents or a previous intrinsic cellular resistance, provided by transmembrane proteins that decreases intracellular drug bioavailability. Furthermore, the lung resistance-related protein (LRP) known as the human major vault protein was found to be overexpressed in many chemoresistant primary tumors of different origins, including lymphomas, that did not express ABCB1 (P-gp) The aim of this study was to investigate ABCB1 and LRP expression in cats with alimentary lymphoma. Immunohistochemistry was performed in 16 samples of cats with alimentary lymphoma without previous treatment, using the monoclonal antibodies: mouse anti-P-glycoprotein (C494; Enzo) and mouse anti-LRP (1014; Santa Cruz Biotech). ABCB1 and LRP immunoreactivity were analysed by degree of labeling intensity, between 0 (no expression) to 3 (strong expression). Lymphoma was classified as B cell in 6 cats (one small and 5 large cells) and as T cells in 10 cats (small cells). ABCB1 expression as well as LRP was higher in cats with B cell lymphoma than in T cell lymphoma. The survival time was longer in cats that did not express or had slightly expression of ABCB1, even in B cell lymphoma. The same was not observed for LRP. More studies are necessary to verifiy if ABCB1 expression could be associated with complete or partial response and survival time. Alimentary lymphoma comprises one of the most common neoplasia in cats. Ki-67 antigen is expressed in proliferating cells during all phases of the cell cycle, but is not found in G0. Metal-lothionein (MT) is a low molecular weight protein that increases significantly during oxidative stress to protect the cells against citotoxicity and DNA damage and these properties contribute to the anti-apoptotic function. MT as well as Ki-67 represents a poor prognostic factor in DLBCL. The goal of this study was investigate Ki-67 and MT expression in cats with alimentary lymphoma. Immunohistochemistry in paraffin samples was performed in 16 cats with alimentary lymphoma without previous treatment, using monoclonal antibodies: mouse anti-PAX-5 (PAX5 Clone 24; Invitrogen); polyclonal rabbit anti-CD3 (DAKO); mouse anti-Ki67 (clone MIB-1; DAKO); and mouse anti-metallothionein (clone E9; DAKO). The Ki-67 immunoreactivity was determined by count 1,000 cells in 40X fields, while metallothionein was analyzed by degree of labeling intensity between 0 (no expression) to 3 (strong expression). Six cats had B-cell (one small cell and 5 large cells) and 10 had T-cell (small cell) lymphoma. The mean of Ki-67 expression was 60.5% in cats with B-cell and 10.8% in T-cell lymphoma (p < 0.0001), and the median of survival time was 3 and 27 months, respectively. Only one cat expressed MT (grade 2) associated with low levels of Ki-67 (5%) and had a long survival time. In conclusion Ki-67 had relation with immunophenotype and survival time and MT was rarely express in alimentary lymphoma in cats. Surgical resection of the primary tumor is an effective treatment for mammary neoplasms in dogs. Nevertheless, the surgical stress response may provide conditions for persistence of residual minimal disease and the development of pre-existing micrometastases. Several mechanisms underlying these processes have been proposed, including postoperative suppression of cell-mediated immunity, the first-line defense mechanism against cancer. Existing data in human patients suggest that an increase in the level of interleukin 6 (IL-6) and interleukin 8 (IL-8), in combination with a decrease of T helper cell-induced cytokine production, interleukin 2 (IL-1) and interferon gama (IFN-c), could account for the profound suppression of natural killer cytotoxic activity in the perioperative period. Given the lack of related studies evaluating the immune response associated with mastectomy in dogs, the aim of this study was to evaluate the serum concentration of IL-2 and IL-6 in the perioperative period of unilateral total mastectomy (UTM) alone or in association with ovariosalpingohisterectomy (OSH) in bitches with mammary tumors.",

Venous blood samples were taken preoperatively (M0), at the end of surgery (M1), 3 hours (M2), 6 hours (M3), 24 hours (M4), 72 hours (M5) and 10 days postoperatively, for serum IL-2 and IL-6 levels. Data were logarithmically transformed and then submitted to Friedman test for differences between moments within the group and Mann Whitney test for moments between groups. There was no significant difference between moments or groups in any of the studied parameters. Results are summarized in Table 1 . Under the conditions of this study and based on the observed results it can be concluded that UTM alone or in association with OSH does not induce significant changes in serum levels of IL-2 and IL-6 in the postoperative period. Increased secretion of pituitary hormones, activation of the sympathetic nervous system and the release of cytokines and acute phase proteins are the main metabolic changes associated with surgical trauma. The intensity of the organic response depends on the magnitude, duration and nature of the stimuli. Minor surgery commonly induces smaller responses compared to medium and large procedures. Excessive release of hormones and humoral mediators after surgical trauma may be responsible for multiple adverse events in the postoperative period, included high protein catabolism, metabolic acidosis, blood hypercoagulability, interstitial edema, immune depression and delayed healing. Given the lack of related studies evaluating the metabolic response associated with mastectomy in dogs, the aim of this study was to evaluate the serum concentration of cortisol, glucose and albumin in the perioperative period of unilateral total mastectomy (UTM) alone or in association with ovariosalpingohisterectomy (OSH) in bitches with mammary tumors.",

Introduction: A recent study documented the activity of the antihypertensive medication minoxidil in a murine model of sarcoma. Specifically, minoxidil inhibited in vitro cell migration at 0.5 mM and reduced pulmonary metastasis in mice at 1-3 mg/kg. A proposed MOA involves the down-regulation of the collagenmodifying enzyme PLOD2, which occurred at 0.5 mM minoxidil. The activity of minoxidil and role of PLOD2 as a druggable target in osteosarcoma have yet to be investigated. PK/PD data are needed to clarify the anti-metastatic mechanism of minoxidil.",

Feline acromegaly is an increasingly recognised endocrinopathy, caused by chronic excessive serum growth hormone concentration produced by a functional somatotrophinoma in the pars distalis of the anterior pituitary gland. The underlying pathogenesis for the development of most human somatotrophinomas is poorly understood. The majority of human somatotrophinomas are sporadic, however up to 20% of familial isolated pituitary adenomas are caused by germline mutations of the aryl-hydrocarbon-receptor interacting protein (AIP). Feline acromegaly has phenotypic and biochemical similarities to human families with AIP mutations, such as male predominance, somatotroph macroadenoma and resistance to octreotide therapy.",

Recent reports indicate that the canine TSH assay (Immulite Canine TSH, Siemens) can be used to measure feline TSH, and that this may be used to help diagnose or exclude hyperthyroidism in cats suspected of having the disease. Because high circulating T4 suppresses TSH secretion, serum TSH levels should be low in hyperthyroid cats, possibly even before serum T4 or free T4 are clearly elevated.

Results of urine ketone measurement by dipstick, when available, were compared to BHB measurement. Incer Serum BHB concentrations were above the reference range (>0.11 mmol/l) in 6/28 cats (21.4%) with CKD, 7/34 cats (20.6%) with HT, and 11/15 cats (73.3%) with HL.

For the HL group, this increase had a wider range (0.12-2.78 mmol/l) and was more marked, as 3/15 HL cats had a serum BHB concentration >2 mmol/l.

Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a common endocrine disorder in cats. Most cats have a form of DM equivalent to type-2 diabetes (T2D) in humans. One new therapeutic strategy for T2D in humans involves use of synthetic incretin hormones, including Exenatide, a GLP-1 hormone agonist. These can be used alone or as an adjunct treatment with insulin to improve overall glycemic control and promote weight loss. Use of Exenatide has recently been shown to be safe and effective at lowering blood sugar concentrations and promoting weight loss in healthy cats.

With 10 and 20mcg/kg IM no side effects were observed, however, the 10mcg/kg dose resulted in inadequate stimulation of blood glucose concentrations (BG). The 20 mcg/kg dose significantly increased BG from baseline (mean of -15 and 0 minutes pre-glucagon, BG [mean AE sd] = 79.5 AE 6.6 mg/dL) to peak at 15 minutes (165.4 AE 24.2 mg/dL).

Day-to-day variability differs between insulin formulations but was previously reported only for porcine lente in dogs. Here we report on the day-to-day variability of BGC in well controlled (based on stable clinical signs including body weight) dogs treated with human-recombinant NPH (n = 5) or insulin detemir (n = 3). In each dog, four successive 12-h BGC's were performed at home by the owners, during no more than a 28 days period. Insulin dose and meals (including quantities, type, time of administration etc.) as well as blood sampling times remained unchanged throughout this time period. Recorded BG parameters included: BG obtained just prior to insulin injections (BG fast 0 , BG fast 12), maximum (BG max ), minimum (Nadir), mean (BG mean ) and Delta [BG fast 0-Nadir]. Day-to-day variability was calculated as previously described (Fleeman & Rand, JAV-MA 2003) except that for each dog, for each parameter, the 2 most extreme values (out of the 4 BGC's) were used to calculate maximal differences (Delta max ). For each parameter, the mean AE sd and CV (CV=SD/mean) of Delta max were calculated for all dogs in each insulin group and presented below. In conclusion, for each parameter, mean maximal differences were smaller between BGC's in the detemir group compared to the NPH group, suggesting overall lesser day-to-day variation in insulin action and greater confidence when interpreting the results of BGC's.",

Addition of 1 g/dL glucose is expected to change the specific gravity of water by 0.003-0.005. A commonly held belief, therefore, is that concentrated USG in a diabetic patient is due to the presence of glucose, and renal concentrating ability cannot be accurately assessed if glucosuria is present. However, the effect of glucose on USG has not been evaluated. Thus, the purpose of our study was to assess the change in USG in relation to the degree of glucosuria.",

A solution of 0.1 g/mL glucose was added to an aliquot of each pool to obtain a final concentration of 2,400 mg/dL. Serial dilutions were performed with the remainder of each pool to obtain glucose concentrations of 1,200, 600, 300, 150 and 50 mg/dL. The USG was measured in the undiluted samples and all spiked samples with a handheld refractometer (Reichert TS 400). For statistical comparisons, the change in USG from the undiluted sample was calculated and divided by the final glucose concentration (in g/dL) in the sample. A repeated measures ANOVA on ranks was used to compare the change in USG per g/dL glucose between the USG ranges. Post hoc comparisons were made with the Tukey test. Median values are reported. Significance was set at the p < 0.05 level.",

In cats, non-thyroidal illness (NTI) may result in decreased total thyroxine (T4) concentration, similar to the \"euthyroid sick syndrome\" in dogs. The pathogenesis of this phenomenon is not completely understood, but may involve suppression of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and reduced thyroid hormone protein binding. Although high TSH and normal T4 concentrations have been reported in humans with chronic kidney, liver, or heart disease, low serum concentrations of T4 and TSH commonly develop with severe NTI in humans. Serum TSH concentrations have not been evaluated in cats with NTI, except for a small number of cats with mild chronic kidney disease in which TSH levels were normal. The objective of this study was to measure TSH in a larger series of cats suffering from a variety of mild-tosevere NTI to determine if the spectrum of TSH concentrations reported in humans also develops in cats.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate epidemiological characteristics of adrenal tumors (AT) in dogs. A retrospective study was conducted based on clinical records considering age, breed, sex, clinical signs, laboratorial findings, hormonal tests, medical or surgical treatment, histological findings and survival from dogs diagnosed with AT between January 2012 and November 2014 at the Naya Especialidades Veterinary Clinics. Among 49 dogs diagnosed with AT, 37 (76%) were female and the mean age was 11.3 AE 2.5 years. Forty-four (89,79%) dogs were purebred, mainly Shih Tzu (11), Lhasa apso (6) and Dachshund (6). The mean body weight was 12.37 AE 11.6 kg (Median 7 kg; range, 3.4 to 60 kg). Body weight was \u2264 10 kg in 69.4% of dogs. Polyuria, polydipsia (59.2%), polyphagia (59.2%) and abdominal distension (36.7%) were the most frequent clinical signs. Increased ALP (86.7%) and ALT (40%), hyperlipidemia (45.6%), low urinary density (57.5%), thrombocytosis (30.2%) and hypertension (51.4%) were reported. A diagnosis of adrenal-dependent hyperadrenocorticism on the basis of nonsuppressed serum cortisol concentration by use of an LDDS test or an inappropriately high serum cortisol concentration after ACTH stimulation was observed in 48,5% and 38,8%, respectively. Forty-eight per cent of dogs had right AT, 36.7% left and 22.4% bilateral. Adrenalectomy was performed on 20 dogs (40,8%). The histological findings revealed adenoma in 65%, carcinoma in 20% and pheocromocitoma in 15% of dogs. Twenty dogs were treated only with trilostane and 8 had no therapy. Of the 49 dogs, 45 (92%) are still alive in a 2 years follow up. Primary AT incidence may be increasing, especially in small dogs (< 10 kg). Cortex adrenal tumors are more common, but some animals may be asymptomatic and have negative LDDS and ACTH stimulation test. Therapy with adrenalectomy or trilostane should be encouraged. Pancreatitis is the most common exocrine pancreatic disease in dogs and has a multifactorial etiology. Endocrine abnormalities and hyperlipidemia are considered risk factors. The aim of this study was to investigate the association of acute pancreatitis with diabetes mellitus (DM), confirmed hyperadrenocorticism (HAC), possibility of HAC (adrenomegaly on ultrasound without previous diagnosis of HAC), hypothyroidism (HYPOT), hypertriglyceridemia (HYPERTRI) and hypercholesterolemia (HYPER CHOL). A retrospective study was performed in dogs admitted to a private veterinary hospital in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil. Dogs with symptoms and sonographic diagnosis of pancreatitis in the years 2012 and 2013 (group 1, n = 50) and control group dogs without sonographic pancreatic alterations, but with chronic kidney disease from 2013 to 2014 (group 2, n = 41) were studied. The past history was evaluated for the diagnosis of diabetes (blood glucose > 200 mg/dL, positive glycosuria), HAC (cortisol after low dose dexamethasone > 1.4 ug/dL or post ACTH > 21 ug/dL) and HYPOT (thyroid-stimulating hormone > 0.5 ng/mL and dialysis free thyroxine < 0.82 ng/dL). Fasting triglyceride and cholesterol measurements during hospitalization identified the presence of HYPERTRI (triglycerides > 150 mg/dL) and HYPERCHOL (cholesterol > 300 mg/dL). Twenty-one (42%) dogs in group 1 had HYPERTRI, 18 (36%) had HYPERCHOL, 11 (22%) had adrenomegaly, nine (18%) were diagnosed with DM, five (10%) were diagnosed with HAC, two (4%) were diagnosed with HYPOT. In group 2, 12 (29.26%) dogs had HYPERCHOL, five (12.19%) had HYPERTRI, two (4.87%) had adrenomegaly, two (4.87%) were diagnosed with HAC, two (4.87%) were diagnosed with HYPOT, one (2.43%) was diagnosed with DM. DM, adrenomegaly and HYPERTRI showed significant association (p \u2264 0.05) with pancreatitis. The inclusion of the variable DM in the logistic regression model showed no significance, mainly due to colinearity with the variable HYPERTRI. Dogs with HYPER-TRI and adrenomegaly had increased odds ratio (OR=5.3 and 7.2 respectively; 95% confidence intervals) for pancreatitis. Results in this study suggested that HYPERTRI and possibility of HAC (represented by adrenomegaly) are associated with pancreatitis in dogs. An association has been suggested between developing acute pancreatitis (AP) and concurrent endocrinopathies including diabetes mellitus (DM), hyperadrenocorticism (HAC) and hypothyroidism, although no conclusive data are available to confirm it. Moreover, there has been much debate whether hormone imbalances can directly affect the development of AP and/or whether hyperlipidemia induced by endocrinopathies might play a role. The objectives of the present study were to examine the prevalence of AP in dogs with endocrinopathies and to examine the association between those endocrinopathies and hyperlipidemia in dogs with AP. Medical records of 104 dogs newly-diagnosed with AP from 2012 to 2014 were examined for the presence or absence of HAC, DM, and hypothyroidism. Two age-and breedmatched randomized controls for each AP dog were examined for the same endocrinopathies. A matched case-control analysis was performed, and the association between hyperlipidemia and endocrinopathies in the AP group was subsequently evaluated using binary logistic regression analysis.",

This study showed that hyperlipidemia caused by DM was associated with AP in dogs, but an association was not observed between HAC and hyperlipidemia in dogs with AP.

Dysregulation of adipokines has been described in humans with cardiovascular disease, but information is lacking on concentrations of circulating adipokines in dogs with myxomatous mitral valve disease (MMVD). The objective of this case-controlled observational study was to determine whether serum adipokine concentrations differed between healthy dogs and dogs with MMVD. Initially, a preliminary study was performed on 21 client-owned dogs with MMVD and 30 healthy dogs with the same body condition score, and several adipokines were measured. Based on the preliminary results, serum leptin and adiponectin concentrations were re-evaluated in 46 dogs newlydiagnosed with MMVD which were divided into 3 groups according to the International Small Animal Cardiac Health Council (ISACHC) classification.",

In the subsequent study, the dogs classified as ISACHC class III significantly showed the highest serum concentrations of leptin and adiponectin. These results indicated that dogs suffering from progressed MMVD showed increases in the serum concentrations of leptin and adiponectin. Our results suggest that the dysregulation of adiponectin and leptin might at least play a role in the pathogenesis of MMVD in dogs. However, further studies will be necessary before an association between adipokines and the progression of MMVD can be clearly understood. Diabetes mellitus is a common endocrinopathy in cats, characterized by impaired beta-cell function and loss. Most of the current knowledge on the molecular mechanisms that negatively affect beta cell function and viability has been obtained in vitro in species other than cats. Although feline diabetes is similar to human type 2 diabetes, species-dependent differences in the pathophysiology of the diseases may exist. Therefore, by establishing a method for the isolation and culture of pure pancreatic islets in cats, we aim at providing an in vitro tool for specific diabetes research in cats.",

The perfused pancreas was then digested in a shaking water bath at 37\u00b0C. The degree of dissociation of islets from acinar tissue was checked every 5 min by examination with dithizone which specifically stains Zn-complexes in beta cells under a phase-contrast microscope. Collagenase digestion was stopped when nearly 50% of islets were free of acinar tissue. Further purification of islets was achieved by using a filtration method and discontinuous density gradient solutions (1.077 and 1.100 g/cm3; Biochrom). The quality and purity of the final islet product was assessed by DTZ staining. Islet viability was assessed by visual assessment of the membrane integrity of islet cells after double fluorescent staining with fluorescein diacetate and propidium iodide (FDA/PI). In vitro functional activity of purified islets was evaluated by measuring the amount of insulin release (Mercodia Feline Insulin) upon glucose stimulation.",

The objective of the present study was to examine whether, in healthy beagle dogs, the endogeneous adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and cortisol concentrations was affected by oral administration with mirtazapine. In 12 laboratory beagle dogs, oral administration with mirtazapine (1 mg/kg) was maintained once daily for 14 days. The corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH) stimulation test and ACTH stimulation test were performed before administration, and for 7 days and 14 days after the administration, respectively.

In dogs with chronic gastrointestinal (GI) disease, fecal S100A12 concentrations were increased and correlated with the severity of clinical disease, endoscopic changes observed in the intestine, and the severity of histologic lesions in the colon. Higher fecal S100A12 concentrations also correlated with a negative outcome in dogs with inflammatory bowel disease. However, the effect of GI pathogens on fecal S100A12 concentrations in dogs has not yet been reported, and this information will be important for any further evaluation of the clinical utility of fecal S100A12 as a marker for GI inflammation.

H2 receptor staining intensity was significantly greater in the gastric glands of the deep mucosa than the epithelial cells of the superficial mucosa. H2 receptors were located in the superficial mucosal epithelial cells and deep mucosal cells of intestinal glands, lymphoid tissue, and ganglia of the duodenum, jejunum, ileum and colon. In all tissues, H3 receptors were located in the smooth muscle and ganglia. H3 receptors were also located in ileal and colonic lymphoid tissue. H3 receptor staining intensity was significantly greater in the epithelial cells of the colonic and gastric superficial mucosa compared to the deep mucosal cells of these tissues, and H3 receptors were not identified in the duodenal, ileal, or jejunal mucosa, except one dog that had weak staining in the jejunal deep mucosa. H4 receptors were located in the ganglia, lymphoid tissue, and occasionally in the gastric glands of the deep mucosa. The density and distribution of H4 receptors in the gastrointestinal tract were decreased in comparison to the other histamine receptors. Western blot demonstrated both specific and non-specific staining of the H1 and H3 receptor antibody but good specificity of the H4 receptor antibody. The H2 receptor antibody was not compatible with Western Blot techniques, despite excellent immunohistochemical specificity and consistency.",

Further studies to compare the density and distribution of these receptors in dogs with gastrointestinal disease are needed. Intestinal dysbiosis in dogs is defined as a relative shift in the bacterial populations of the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) and has been associated with chronic enteropathy (CE). Our group has previously reported small intestinal or fecal dysbiosis and decreased species richness in canine spontaneous inflammatory bowel disease. However, due to functional redundancy between bacterial groups, determining the biochemical changes in the GIT requires direct analysis of the biomolecules that are present. The study aim was to evaluate differences in fecal metabolite profiles between dogs with chronic gastrointestinal inflammation and healthy control dogs.",

Both vitamins influence each other in biochemical processes including the homocysteine remethylation cycle and the transsulfuration pathway. It is well known that cobalamin deficiency can alter folate metabolism by decreasing intestinal absorption of folate. Also, increased serum folate concentrations have been observed in dogs with small intestinal dysbiosis. A previous study comparing changes in serum amino acid concentrations between healthy dogs, hypocobalaminemic dogs, and dogs with biochemical evidence of cobalamin deficiency has shown significant differences in serum concentrations of glycine, glutamic acid, methionine, tyrosine, tryptophan, and lysine in dogs with hypocobalaminemia.

Digestibility is directly affected by the amount of pancreatic enzymes available for food breakdown in the gastrointestinal tract.

The exact cause of these changes requires further investigation.

Current therapeutic options for canine inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are focused on reducing intestinal inflammation and achieving clinical remission, but often result in side effects especially due to the use of immunosuppressant drugs. In IBD patients, activation of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-jB) causes intestinal inflammation. Chondroitin sulphate (CS) inhibits NF-jB phosphorylation and therefore could help to reduce the inflammatory response associated with IBD. Large-bowel fermentation of certain resistant starches increases butyrate production, which helps maintaining the intestinal barrier integrity. Orally administered prebiotics promote the growth of beneficial gut microflora. The aim of this study was to evaluate, in a multicentric randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial in dogs with IBD, the effects of an oral nutritional supplement containing butyrogenic resistant starch, CS, b-glucans and mannanoligosaccharides on serum biomarkers, intestinal histology, and canine IBD activity index (CIBDAI).",

Biopsies were scored based on the WSAVA guidelines for the assessment of endoscopic intestinal biopsy samples. A one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) of repeated measures and an uncorrected Fisher's Least Significant Difference (LSD) test were used to compare the values in each group at different times before and during treatment. Unpaired t test was performed to compare pretreatment values between groups. Analytes that did not follow a parametric distribution were log transformed before applying the test.

Ultrasonographic images were reviewed by a single radiologist and assessed for lesions such as abnormal wall thickness, layering, echogenicity, or mural masses. Pathologists graded all histopathologic samples according to WSAVA standards. For both ultrasound and biopsy, each wall layer of SI was evaluated for lesions in each section available for review.

Diagnoses in cats with SI pathology included: inflammatory bowel disease (105), small cell lymphoma (16), intermediate-large cell lymphoma (14), other neoplasia (13), and suspected feline infectious peritonitis (10). Twenty five cats had no histologic lesions. Overall ultrasonographic lesions in the SI had high positive predictive value (PPV) for histologic SI lesions (duodenum 82%, jejunum 91%, ileum 88.1%) but poor negative predictive value (NPV) (duodenum 27.1%, jejunum 27.3%, ileum 40.4%). Table  1 shows the ability of ultrasound to predict histologic lesions in specific SI wall layers. The 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) are also reported. These results show that most cats with SI mucosal ultrasonographic lesions will have mucosal histologic changes. Mucosal biopsy may effectively identify these lesions. However, SI muscularis ultrasonographic lesions are not predictive of histologic disease in the muscularis layer, suggesting that full thickness biopsy may not be essential to obtaining a diagnosis in cats with ultrasonographic muscularis lesions.

While most of the changes were reversed 14 days after the end of antibiotic administration, some of the evaluated bacterial groups remained significantly altered up to 4 weeks after administration. In conclusion, metronidazole has a profound effect on the fecal microbiome and leads to a more variable microbiome over time. Further studies are needed to evaluate the functional changes in the microbiome that occur due to metronidazole, to better understand the mechanisms of antibiotics in gastrointestinal disease.

In particular, it is unknown whether there are abnormalities involving the extrinsic nerves, the enteric nerve plexuses, interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC) or the intestinal smooth muscle. Abnormalities of any of these components could lead to gut dilatation and impaired motility. Chronic constipation and megacolon occurs more often in the cat than the dog. In humans, probiotics have been increasingly investigated in the management of these colonic motility dysfunctions, particularly their effect on gut transit time, stool output, and constipation relief. While probiotics are used frequently in small animal practice, there are no published studies regarding their clinical efficacy in cats with CC and IMC. The aim of the study was to investigate the clinical and histological effects of a commercial multi-strain probiotic (SI-VOY TM ), containing 200 billion lactic acid bacteria comprised of the following strains: L. acidophilus DSM24735, L. plantarum DSM24730, L. paracasei DSM 24733, L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus DSM24734, L. brevis CD2 #11988, Streptococcus thermophilus DSM 24731, B. longum DSM 24736, and B. infantis DSM 24737.",

Three of these 10 cats suffered from IMC and full thickness biopsies were sampled for histology. In all animals enrolled in the study, the colon was found to be dilated and impacted with faeces, with the most severe dilatation occurring in the transverse and descending colon, as observed via imaging. CC (n = 7) and IMC (n = 3) cats received orally 200 billion lyophilized bacteria daily for 90 days. Cats were assessed clinically, endoscopically, and histologically at baseline (T0) and after the end of treatment (T1). Histological samples were scored, then evaluated for the immunohistochemical (IHC) expression of CD117 + ICC, enteric neurons, glial cells, and gangliar cell apoptosis (these three latter parameters were evaluated only in the full thickness biopsy obtained at T0 from cats with IMC). Concerning CD117 IHC for ICC evaluation, mast cells, which are known to express the same antigen, were differentiated by staining with Alcian blue, and numbered. Data from constipated cats were compared before and after therapy, and with those obtained from healthy control tissues (archived material from five healthy cats) using paired t-tests or Wilcoxon matched pairs tests, where appropriate. Statistical significance was set at P < 0.05.",

Chronic pancreatitis (CP) in dogs is a clinically underdiagnosed condition characterized by acinar cell atrophy, fibrosis, and loss of exocrine function. Currently, there is no approved pharmaceutical treatment for chronic pancreatitis in dogs, thus management relies heavily on supportive care. Camostat mesilate (CM; FOY-305) is a synthetic protease inhibitor, which has been shown to have inhibitory effects on trypsin, the kinin system, as well as inflammatory and fibrotic cascades. CM has been approved for the treatment of chronic pancreatitis in humans in Japan for over 20 years. However, data on the efficacy of CM in dogs with chronic pancreatitis are lacking. Thus, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of oral CM therapy on markers of acinar cell damage, inflammation, and fibrosis in dogs with suspected CP.",

Thromboembolic events are a common complication of many diseases in veterinary patients, and anti-platelet therapies can be ineffective in their prevention. n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFA) can inhibit platelet function in people, and enhance efficacy of anti-platelet therapy. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the effects of low-dose acetylsalicylic acid (ASA; 1 mg/ kg/day) alone, n-3 PUFA (100 mg/kg/day) alone, and combination ASA and n-3 PUFA therapy on platelet function and activation markers in healthy dogs. Platelet function was measured using platelet function analyzer (PFA) closure time and whole blood aggregometry. Flow cytometry was used to measure platelet activation (P-selectin) and platelet leukocyte aggregates. Above tests were evaluated at baseline, during therapy with ASA and n-3 PUFA alone, and during combination therapy to assess effects on platelet function. This study demonstrated that n-3 PUFA alone did not cause a significant change in platelet function tests. ASA alone decreased platelet function as measured by PFA-epinephrine following one week of therapy (P < 0.0001). ASA plus n-3 PUFA decreased platelet function significantly more versus ASA alone when measured by whole blood aggregometry (agonists: arachidonic acid P = 0.008; collagen P = 0.006). No change in platelet activation was detected via flow cytometry after any therapies. In conclusion, ASA plus n-3 PUFA appear to have a synergistic effect on inhibition of platelet function in healthy dogs. This combination therapy may increase efficacy of anti-platelet therapy in dogs at risk of thromboembolic complications. Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are webs of DNA and proteins that protect against infection, but are pro-thrombotic. Mortality from canine immune-mediated hemolytic anemia (IMHA) largely results from thrombosis, and IMHA is associated with two triggers of NET formation: heme and hypoxia. Therefore, NETs may be prognostic markers or therapeutic targets in IMHA. However, NETs have not been previously demonstrated in dogs. Study aims were (1) to develop a method for in vitro generation of NETs by canine neutrophils and (2) to determine if dogs with primary IMHA have higher circulating nucleosomes (a marker correlated with NETs) than healthy dogs. Neutrophils were isolated from 5 healthy pet dogs and cultured with increasing concentrations of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) or platelet-activating factor (PAF). Extracellular DNA release was measured using Sytox green fluorescence. Confocal, immunofluorescent (IF) imaging was performed to visualize NETs using DAPI and Cy5 labeled anti-elastase antibodies. Nucleosomes were measured in serum from 20 healthy dogs and 11 IMHA dogs using a commercial ELISA. Four IMHA dogs were excluded due to positive interferences from hemolysis and icterus. Cells stimulated with PAF of \u226531 lM or PMA of \u22650.1 lM released significantly more DNA than unstimulated cells (P < 0.05). DNA release was maximal by 1 hour for PAF and 2 hours for PMA. IF imaging confirmed NET formation. IMHA dogs had significantly higher nucleosomes than controls (median absorbance [arbitrary units] 0.90 and 0.12 respectively, P = 0.01).",

Storage of blood products creates an unnatural environment that can accelerate red blood cell (RBC) degradation. One well recognized indicator of RBC degradation is translocation of phosphatidylserine to the outer cell membrane layer. In units of stored human blood, an increase in phosphatidylserine expression is associated with a subsequent reduction in the circulating survival time of transfused RBCs, and an increased incidence of transfusion-related complications. With the addition of a leukoreduction step which extracts leukocytes and platelets from blood products prior to storage, these removed cells are unable to influence the degradation of the RBCs within the unit.

Three of fifteen dogs were thrombocytopenic, three had thrombocytosis, three were hyperfibrinogenemic, one had low vWF:Ag, three had mild prolongations of PT and none had abnormal aPTT. Based on the TEG G value, 13/15 dogs were hypercoagulable (meanAESD 13.5 AE 5.4kd/s). Antithrombin deficiency was identified in 9/15 dogs (mean AE sd 68.7 AE 22.7%) with 5/9 having concurrently elevated TAT suggesting active thrombin generation. There was no significant difference in hemostatic biomarkers or outcome for the 8/15 dogs with malignancy compared to those with benign lesions (p > 0.05). No dogs developed PVT and all achieved 30-day survival. Pre-operative hypercoagulability was recognized commonly and may in part contribute to the risk of postoperative PVT in dogs after splenectomy.",

Using the currently available MAX-ACT tube, visual end clot formation at 37\u00b0C was reported as mean 66 sec, and range 55-85 sec ( 2 Aust Vet J 2009; 87: 292-295). In the present study, MAX-ACT was measured in 49 healthy client-owned cats with normal hematology and hemostasis. Cats were sedated with ketamine 2 mg/kg and butorphanol 0.2 mg/kg, given via a saphenous vein. Using jugular venipuncture with a 21ga butterfly needle, after blood draw into vacuum tubes for hematology, blood was collected by syringe. Blood draw quality was graded from 1(easy) to 3 (difficult) 1 . 0.5 mL was dispensed into a MAX-ACT tube, warmed by axillary incubation (35.4-36.6\u00b0C), and after 60 sec visually inspected q10sec for first clot formation, and then q5sec until end clot formation. Another 0.5 mL was synchronously dispensed into a second MAX-ACT tube, and incubated at 38.4\u00b0C in an instrument that mechanically detects end clot formation (Actalyke MINI II).",

Further studies are warranted evaluating the EPOC in non-healthy animals. The osmotic fragility (OF) of erythrocytes determines their fragility in hypotonic solutions. The goals of this study were to determine the mean OF (MOF) in cats with anemia and to evaluate the suitability of this test for diagnosing anemic patients. The study included 108 anemic cats with various forms of anemia. Anemia was categorized into the following groups: acute/chronic blood loss anemia (BA), hemolytic anemia (HA), anemia of inflammatory and neoplastic diseases (AID), intramedullary (INR) or extramedullary nonregenerative anemia (ENR). OF was performed by mixing red blood cells in a serial dilution of NaCl solution (0 -0.85%). MOF was determined from the lysis curve as concentration of NaCl at which 50% of the erythrocytes were hemolysed. The test was assessed by three different people. Statistical analysis was done using SPSS (IBS, Version 22). The 115 cats used as controls exhibited an MOF between 0.39 -0.62% (mean 0.51). There was a significant difference in measurements of MOF among the three examiners (Kruskal-Wallis-Test, pvalue <0.001). Therefore the 95%-percentile was used as reference value (0.44 -0.58%), i.e. MOF above 0.58% was regarded as increased, below 0.44% as decreased. Cats with HA (n = 38) exhibited the highest MOF (0.44 -0.85%, median 0.72); two cats with chronic BA had the lowest MOF values (0.38 -0.40%). Overall, each of the groups exhibited the following rates of increased MOF: HA 86%, INR 67%, ENR 62%, AID 46%, and acute BA 28% (n = 38, 9, 13, 28, and 18, respectively). MOF may be a useful tool in diagnosing HA and BA and helpful to differentiate nonregenerative immune-mediated hemolytic anemia from other forms of nonregenerative anemia. Low MOF values can be an indicator of a chronic BA.",

Sara Wennogle 1 , Allison Bradley 1 , Christine Olver 1 , David Twedt 1 . 1 Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO, USA Hypofibrinogenemia has been described in humans with advanced liver disease and dogs with chronic hepatitis. Addition-ally, hypofibriongenemia has recently been correlated with perioperative bleeding during liver transplantation in humans. Plasma fibrinogen concentrations have not been compared among different categories of liver disease in dogs. The goal of this study was to retrospectively evaluate fibrinogen concentrations in dogs with various histologic types of liver disease. Fibrinogen was measured in stored citrated plasma from 41 dogs that underwent liver biopsy at Colorado State University from June 2013-November 2014. The fibrinogen assay was performed on the Destiny AMAX Plus TM analyzer and results reported in mg/dL. The reported normal reference range for this assay is 117 to 392 mg/dl. Based on the histological diagnosis dogs were grouped into one of the following categories: non-specific reactive hepatopathy/NSR (n = 13); chronic hepatitis/CH (n = 9); hydropic/vacuolar hepatopathy (n = 8); cholangiohepatitis (n = 4); neoplasia (n = 4); or other (n = 3). Groups were compared via one-way ANOVA with Tukey adjusted pairwise comparisons and significance was defined as P < 0.05. Plasma fibrinogen summary data are shown in the figure below. Dogs with histologically confirmed CH had significantly lower mean fibrinogen concentrations than other histological categories: NSR (P = 0.004), hydropic/vacuolar (P < 0.0001), cholangiohepatitis (P = 0.0001), neoplasia (P = 0.0009) or other (P = 0.0328). Mean fibrinogen levels were not different among other histological types of liver disease. Hypofibrinogenemia is more likely to occur in dogs with CH than other types of hepatobiliary disease. Plasma fibrinogen concentrations may be a useful indirect indicator of hepatic function and hypofibrinogenemia may also predispose a patient to perioperative bleeding. Further studies are needed to better characterize hypofibrinogenemia in dogs with hepatobiliary disease. The prevalence of cobalamin deficiency in cats with hepatic lipidosis (FHL) is unknown. Cobalamin serves as a cofactor in metabolic reactions responsible for the generation of carnitine, which promotes the oxidation of fatty acids, and the antioxidant glutathione. Cobalamin deficiency could therefore play a role in the pathogenesis of FHL. The aims of this study were to determine the prevalence of hypocobalaminemia in cats with FHL and to compare serum methylmalonic acid (MMA) and homocysteine (HCY) concentrations between healthy cats and cats with FHL.",

Standard Poodles have been suggested to suffer from a breedrelated chronic hepatitis, and the Poodle Club of America lists chronic hepatitis as a health issue. The purpose of this prospective study was to characterize the liver histology and clinical course of Standard Poodles suspected to have chronic hepatitis. Liver tissue from Standard Poodles suspected to have chronic hepatitis were solicited over a period of approximately three years. Patients receiving immunosuppressive therapy were excluded. Veterinarians and owners were contacted for long-term outcome information. Liver samples were submitted for histologic diagnosis, and case histories were reviewed. Inflammation was grouped into the following categories: Acute Hepatitis, Chronic Hepatitis (including Copper-associated Hepatitis and Cirrhosis), and Reactive Hepatitis. Lesions were also assigned a total score out of 30 points for 7 histologic features: lobular collapse; bile duct hyperplasia; interface hepatitis; focal lytic necrosis/apoptosis/random inflammation; portal inflammation; zonal necrosis; and fibrosis. Hepatic metal quantification (copper, zinc, and iron) was performed when adequate tissue was available, and in the remainder, copper and iron content was assessed semiquantitatively through histochemical staining. 42 eligible liver biopsies were received, 35 of which were available for quantitative histologic review, and the results are summarized below. Chronic hepatitis was the most common diagnosis (57% of submissions) in this group of Standard Poodles with clinicopathologic evidence of liver disease. In general, these patients responded well to immunomodulatory therapy; however, patients with a total histologic score greater than 18 had a poor prognosis. Nonspecific reactive hepatitis was also common (38% of submissions), and dogs in this group were frequently also affected by gastrointestinal or pancreaticobiliary disease. In this group of Standard Poodles, both chronic and reactive hepatitis were frequently identified. Reactive hepatitis was nonspecific and often associated with concurrent extra-hepatic disease. There were no consistent histologic features of chronic hep-atitis that appear unique to the breed, and primary copper-associated hepatitis was not the main etiology in this group of dogs. Whether chronic hepatitis is a breed-specific condition in the Standard Poodle remains to be elucidated through further studies. The cause of gallbladder mucocele formation in dogs is unknown. Drugs used for the prevention of flea and tick infestation, heartworm infection, and those commonly used for adjunctive treatment of degenerative joint disease, represent a newergeneration of xenobiotics to which dogs are chronically exposed. We speculate that pharmacogenomic differences in drug metabolism may be a reason for gallbladder mucoceles to develop. In this study, we examined the medical records of dogs diagnosed at our institution with a gallbladder mucocele and matched controls (1 to 2 ratio) based on age, breed, and admission date. The aim was to determine if there was an association between gallbladder mucocele diagnosis and reported administration of preventative drugs.",

Despite correction of prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (PTT) with parenteral vitamin K and the presence of normal platelet counts, many cats with cholestatic hepatobiliary disease develop progressive anemia while hospitalized or after provocative procedures. We hypothesized that bleeding tendencies in these cats might be associated with decreased clot strength or fibrinolysis both which can be monitored with thromboelastography (TEG). Thus this study was conducted to compare TEG analysis in cats with cholestasis with conventional coagulation tests. Seventeen cats with serum hyperbilirubinemia > 3 times the upper limit of normal, serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) activity > 2 times the upper limit of normal and a PCV greater than 28% were recruited. All cats were treated with 3 doses of vitamin K1 subcutaneously for 36 hrs prior to coagulation testing. The mean values for the TEG parameters (R, K, angle, MA), PT, aPTT and platelet count in cholestatic cats did not differ significantly from the reference range. The one excep-tion was a significantly increased G (10.1 AE 5.6 dynes/s vs 6.9 AE 1.9 dynes/sec, P = 0.038). The TEG G value labeled 8/17, 6/17 and 3/17 cats as hypercoagulable, normocoagulable or hypocoagulable, respectively. Compared to normal cats, hypercoagulable cats had a significant decrease in aPTT (15.4s AE 2.1s vs 18.3s+/-6.8s, P = 0.014) and K (1.23 AE 0.43s vs 1.63 AE 0.54s, P = .031) and an increase in angle (74.1 AE 5.6 0 vs 66.5 AE 8.7 0 , P < 0.006). Compared to normal cats, hypocoagulable cats had significantly lower platelet counts (224 K/uL AE 42 K/uL vs 377 K/uL AE 195 K/uL, P = 0.02), prolonged K (4.1s AE 0.41s vs 1.62s AE 0.54s, P < 0.001) and decreases in angle (52.8 AE 11 0 vs 66.5 AE 8.6 0 , P = 0.016). LY30 was increased in only one cat (32%, normal <20%)) that was hypocoagulable. In conclusion, by TEG analysis cholestatic cats replete with vitamin K rarely have hyperfibrinolysis, but have a variety of coagulation profiles with a tendency to be normo-or hypercoagulable.",

Whitney Fry 1 , Carrie Lester 1 , Nahv Etedali 1 , Armelle DeLaforcade 1 , Cynthia Webster 1 . 1 Cumming School of Veterinary Medicine at Tufts University, Grafton, MA, USA Due to the liver's role in synthesis of the majority of pro-and anti-coagulants as well as most regulators of fibrinolysis, a complex rebalance of coagulation exists in dogs with chronic hepatitis (CH). On conventional plasma based coagulation testing thrombocytopenia, prolongations in prothrombin (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) as well as decreases in fibrinogen have been reported in dogs with CH. Despite these alterations which should result in hypocoagulability, spontaneous bleeding is rare. In fact, CH is a risk factor for portal vein thrombosis presumably related to decreased production of anticoagulants or to endothelial dysfunction secondary to portal hypertension. The aim of the current study was to gain a better perspective on the state of coagulation in dogs with CH by performing thromboelastography (TEG) and comparing it with conventional coagulation testing. Seventeen dogs with biopsy proven CH and 3 dogs with clinical evidence of end stage liver disease were recruited. PT, aPTT, platelet count, PCV and kaolin activated TEG were performed according to published standards. In some dogs fibrinogen, anti-thrombin activity (AT), protein C activity (PC), D-dimers and vWF activity was performed. Eleven breeds with a mean age of 7.3 AE 3 yrs were enrolled. All dogs had PCV's in the normal range. When compared to reference ranges dogs with CH had longer R (5.4s AE 2s, P = 0.009) and K (3.64s AE 3.2s, P = 0.002) values, smaller angles (55.0 0 AE 14.5 0 , P = 0.006) and an increase in LY30 (4.26% +/-10.4%, P = 0.018). Fibrinogen (P = 0.03), AT activity (P = 0.0001) and PC activity (P = 0.021) were significantly decreased. TEG G value defined 8/20, 7/20 and 5/20 dogs as normocoagulable, hypercoagulable and hypocoagulable, respectively. G was positively correlated with PC activity (P = 0.688, P = 0.02) and negatively correlated with PT (-0.459, P = 0.05) and aPTT (-0.443, P = 0.05). Four dogs were hyperfibrinolytic with mean Ly30 of 20.9%, AE 15.2%. In conclusion, on TEG analysis dogs with CH have a variety of coagulation states. PT, aPTT and PC activity predict the state of coagulation as determined by TEG. Some dogs with CH are hyperfibrinolytic a condition that would be missed on conventional coagulation testing.",

Further studies are warranted to confirm these findings more broadly, and to determine the specific mechanism by which the identified variants may alter canine immune system function. Type 1 regulatory T (Tr1) cells play a pivotal role in the maintenance of peripheral tolerance. In contrast to their extensive characterization in humans and mice, little is known about Tr1 cells in the dog, an important veterinary species and an animal model for various human diseases. Secretion of high-level interleukin-10 (IL-10) is considered to be a defining hallmark of Tr1 cells. To date, a well-validated assay for intracellular IL-10 in the dog has not been described. Our goal was to develop a robust flow cytometric assay for canine intracellular IL-10 as a precursor to the study of Tr1 cells in this species. We screened three commercially available antibodies (Abs): a monoclonal antihuman IL-10 Ab (clone JES3-9D7) marketed for use in flow cytometry and Western blots, and both polyclonal (catalog number AF735) and monoclonal (clone 138128) anti-canine IL-10 Abs marketed only for use in Western blots. Cross-reactivity of the anti-human monoclonal Ab was predicted on the basis of 81% amino acid sequence identity of the canine and human proteins. Canine IL-10 was cloned into two vectors, pcDNA3 and pMIG. Both constructs were used to transfect human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells. Surprisingly, canine IL-10 expressed by transfected cells failed to be detected by the anti-human monoclonal Ab by either Western blots or flow cytometry. Both anticanine IL-10 Abs detected canine IL-10 expressed by transfected HEK 293T cells, the polyclonal Ab performing better in the setting of Western blots and the monoclonal Ab performing better in the setting of flow cytometry. In summary, two commercially available Abs have been validated for the detection of canine intracellular IL-10. Studies examining the expression of this cytokine by both in vitro-generated IL-10-producing cells and the peripheral blood monoclonal cells of dogs with immune-mediated and neoplastic diseases are ongoing. The use of mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) therapy to treat clinical disease may be optimized through selection and pre-conditioning methods that would enhance their immunomodulatory functions. We investigated the effects of several pre-conditioning methods and gender of the tissue donor on parameters of feline adipose-derived MSC in vitro that may be applicable to and opti-mize the clinical effect of MSC application in this species. Passage 3 feline MSC were generated from cryopreserved subcutaneous adipose tissue from 6 healthy cats, three males and three females. MSC were subjected to six different pre-conditioning agents or conditions for 24 hours: control, poly I:C, IFNc, TGFb, serum-free, and hypoxia. Supernatants from the MSC were harvested after 24 hours, aliquoted, and frozen for batch analysis. Levels of IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and MCP-1 in the supernatants were determined by ELISA. Both pretreatment and gender of donor significantly affected measured cytokine levels in the 24 hour supernatants from feline adipose-derived MSC: IL-6 and IL-10 were affected by donor gender whereas all of the measured cytokines were affected by at least one of the pretreatments. Although further study is necessary, this initial study shows that specific pre-conditioning methods hold promise for tailoring and augmenting feline adipose-derived MSC immunomodulatory properties to treat specific diseases, and gender of donor cat may be significant in this species depending on the desired therapeutic outcome. Infectious pathogens linked to canine immune-mediated hemolytic anemia (IMHA) and immune-mediated thrombocytopenia (ITP) include viral, bacterial, protozoan or rickettsial organisms. The purpose of this study was to retrospectively screen for canine vector borne diseases (CVBD) using serology and PCR methods in IMHA/ITP cases from the Southeastern region of the United States. Archived serum from a population of dogs being tested for tick-borne diseases (IFA for Ehrlichia canis, Rickettsia rickettsii, Babesia canis, Bartonella henselae, Bartonella vinsonii subsp berkhoffii, and SNAP \u00d2 4Dx \u00d2 for E. canis, Anaplasma spp., Borrelia burgdorferi, and D. immitis) from 2008 to 2012 were further characterized by retrospective screening using SNAP \u00d2 M-A, an experimental, diagnostic ELISA assay that uses synthetic, species-specific peptides to differentiate between exposure to E. canis, E. chaffeensis, E. ewingii, Anaplasma phagocytophilum, A. platys and Borrelia burgdorferi. Of the retrospectively screened canine sera, 56 dogs were identified with accessible clinical data, a diagnosis of IMHA and/or ITP, and corresponding stored EDTA-anticoagulated whole blood for retrospective PCR testing. A total of 19/56 (34%) dogs were seroreactive for a CVBD pathogen. SNAP \u00d2 M-A identified an additional 7/56 (13%) dogs that were initially non-seroreactive for all pathogens by IFA or SNAP \u00d2 4Dx \u00d2 . The most prevalent antibody reactivity was to R. rickettsii antigens 6/56 (11%), followed by B. burgdorferi 5/56 (9%), Anaplasma spp. 5/56 (9%), E. ewingii 5/56 (9%), E. canis 4/56 (7%) E. chaffeensis 4/56 (7%) and B. henselae 1/56 (2%). Only 10/56 (17.8%) dogs were screened for vector-borne pathogens by PCR at initial diagnosis; of those, 6/10 (60%) requested Babesia PCR only; 1/10 (10%) Ehrlichia PCR only; 2/10 Babesia and Ehrlichia PCR; and only 1/10 (10%) requested Babesia, Bartonella and Ehrlichia PCR. Based on PCR results done at the time of diagnosis, only 1/10 (10%) dogs was PCR positive for a vector-borne pathogen (E. ewingii). Retrospective PCR testing, which included RT-PCR assays to detect Anaplasma spp., Babesia spp., Bartonella spp., Canine Hemotropic Mycoplasma, Ehrlichia spp., Hepatozoon spp., Leishmania spp., Neorickettsia risticii and Rickettsia rickettsia, identified 5/56 (9%) PCR positive dogs, 1/5 (20%) Mycoplasma hemocanis and 4/5 (80%) E. ewingii. These results underscore the importance of a multimodal diagnostic approach to detect tick-borne pathogens and support further evaluation of a potential role for E. ewingii and other CVBD in the pathogenesis of IMHA and ITP in dogs.",

Bacterial cystitis is common in dogs as both a primary disorder and as a complication of co-morbid conditions. An increase in urinary isolates resistant to antimicrobial drugs has been reported in recent years. Multiple drug resistant (MDR) organisms, defined as organisms with acquired resistance to at least one member of 3 or more classes of antimicrobials, seem to be commonplace in the Veterinary Medical Diagnostic Laboratory at the University of Missouri. We undertook a descriptive retrospective study of drug resistance of urinary isolates from the MU-VMDL from Jan. 1, 2014 1, to Nov. 19, 2014 Urine cultures were performed using calibrated loops delivering urine to both blood agar and MacConkey agar plates for aerobic bacterial isolation. Plates were incubated under routine culture conditions. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing of resultant isolates was accomplished with the MIC technique using commercially prepared lyophilized trays. Breakpoints for determination of resistance or susceptibility were based on the standards set by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards. Antimicrobials included on routine susceptibility profiles differed slightly depending on organism (to exclude intrinsic resistance) but included aminoglycosides (amikacin and gentamicin), potentiated penicillin and carboxypenicillin (amoxicillin-clavulanate, ticarcillin-clavulanate), natural and synthetic penicillins and carboxypenicillin (ampicillin, penicillin, oxacillin +2% NACL, ticarcillin), 1st generation cephalosporins (cefazolin, cephalothin), 2nd generation cephalosporins (cefoxitin, ceftiofur), 3rd generation cephalosporins (cefovecin, cefpodoxime), chloramphenicol, clindamycin, doxycycline, erythromycin, fluoroquinolones (enrofloxacin, marbofloxacin), imipenem, rifampin, and trimethoprim sulfa (TMS). The 4 most common isolates (E. coli, Staphylococcus spp., Enterococcus spp., and Streptococcus spp) were evaluated. Innate antimicrobial resistance was defined for each of the four microbes of interest as follows: E. coliclindamycin, erythromycin, penicillin; Staphylococcus spp.aminoglycosides; Streptococcus spp.aminoglycosides; Enterococcus spp.aminoglycosides, all generations of cephalosporins, and TMS.",

The agreement between the 2 laboratories was good even though some discordant results were detected with the second laboratory appearing to have a higher sensitivity for E. ewingii DNA. However, 100% concordance was not expected because the samples were not handled identically and the assays use different technologies. The sequence homology between E. ewingii and E. chaffeensis is very high and so a different result from two different sequencing laboratories can occur. Alternately, dog may have had dual infection. Babesia conradae is a small, intraerythrocytic piroplasm found in dogs from southern California. In domestic dogs, B. conradae infection causes lethargy and hemolytic anemia. In March 2014 a greyhound used to hunt coyotes in Oklahoma presented with lethargy and pale mucous membranes. Evaluation of stained blood film revealed small piroplasms in red blood cells. Subsequent DNA extraction of whole blood, PCR amplification using piroplasm-specific primers, and DNA sequencing confirmed infection by B. conradae. The index case dog was euthanized by the owner due to deteriorating condition. Follow-up evaluation of the majority of dogs in the owner's kennel revealed that 3 of 6 (50%) greyhounds and 0 of 4 (0%) walker hounds were PCR positive for infection with B. conradae. No dogs were known to have travel histories west of Oklahoma. Two of the greyhounds subclinically infected with B. conradae were treated with an 8 day course of azithromycin (10 mg/kg [4.5 mg/lb], PO, q 24 hour) plus atovaquone (13.3 mg/kg [6 mg/lb], PO, q 8 hour). The third B. conradae-infected dog was sold and lost to follow-up. Approximately 1 month after completion of azithromycin and atovaquone treatment, both dogs were PCR negative for infection with B. conradae. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first report of B. conradae in dogs outside of California.",

Christian Leutenegger 1 , Hongwei Liu 2 , Niels Pedersen 2 . 1 IDEXX Laboratories, Inc., West Sacramento, CA, USA, 2 Center for Companion Animal Health, University of California, Davis, Davis, CA, USA A recent study of shelter cats in the UK provided strong evidence that healthy cats may shed strains of canine parvovirus type 2 (CPV2). The purpose of this study was to confirm these findings among healthy cats in shelters and in privately owned sick cats in the USA. We developed and validated a CPV2 realtime PCR assay to discriminate CPV2a, CPV2b, and CPV2c from feline panleukopenia virus (FPV). The specificity of the typing assays was confirmed by sequencing. The typing assays were then used to test CPV2 strains obtained from puppies with naturally acquired parvovirus infection and high fecal viral loads. All samples could be typed successfully and confirmed again by sequencing. After confirming the specificity of the strain typing assays in puppies, the same assays were used to test feces from healthy shelter kittens. In the group of the healthy shelter cats 58% shed parvovirus in their feces. Low levels of parvovirus shedding can be explained by chronic infection, gastrointestinal passage of environmental parvovirus or presence of vaccine virus. But 21% of these were shedding high parvovirus load indicating infection. Within the group of high shedders, 6% of kittens tested positive for canine parvovirus strain 2a.",

This assay cannot be used alone to accurately distinguish a cat with naturally occurring FIV infection from a cat that has been vaccinated against FIV. In an attempt to understand the immune response of cats infected by Leishmania infantum chagasi, the aim of this study was to evaluate the level of expression of genes encoding interleukins IL-4, IL-10, IL-12p40 and IFN-c in spleen samples of naturally infected cats, by quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR). Disease diagnosis was based on the finding of amastigote forms of the parasite by cytological examination and confirmed by DNA amplification of L. infantum chagasi in bone marrow tissue. Three groups of cats were evaluated; the first group composed by six symptomatic naturally infected cats, the second composed by six asymptomatic naturally infected cats and the third composed of six clinically healthy and uninfected cats. Prior to cats inclusion in the study owners were informed of the necessary interventions and their consent was obtained for each cat. The study was approved by the Committee for Ethics in Animal Research, of S\u00e3o Paulo State University. Total RNA was extracted from spleen and converted into cDNA. Cytokines gene expression was measured and final quantitation was evaluated by 2 -DDC T method. An endogenous \"housekeeping\" gene (beta-actin) was quantified and used to normalize the results. The mRNA expression of IL-4 was reduced in both groups in comparison to healthy cats, with gene expression of symptomatic and asymptomatic cats supressed 2.52 and 2.22 times, respectively. The mRNA expression of IL-10 gene was reduced in all naturally infected cats. The reduction was slightly higher in symptomatic (supressed 2.40 times) than in asymptomatic (supressed 2.15 times) cats when compared to the control group. The mRNA expression of IL-12 was reduced in both groups in comparison to healthy cats, with gene expression of asymptomatic and symptomatic cats supressed 2.52 and 2.30 times, respectively, in comparison to healthy cats. The mRNA expression of IFN-c gene was reduced in all naturally infected cats, regardless of the presence or absence of symptoms, when compared to the control group. The reduction was more significant in asymptomatic (supressed 1.15 times) than in symptomatic (supressed 0.57 times) cats. The results of this study suggest that there is reduced expression, and eventually production, of the four cytokines in the spleen of cats naturally infected by L. infantum chagasi, regardless of the clinical status of animals, and that spleen cells of the studied cats did not to elicit a specific immune response to Leishmania infection.",

Due to the heightened prevalence in the number of cats diagnosed with obstructive ureterolithiasis in recent years, surgery on the feline upper urinary tract has become more commonplace. Several techniques have been described for treatment of ureteral pathology in cats, including ureterotomy, neoureterocystostomy, ureteral stenting, and subcutaneous ureteral bypass. However, there is currently a paucity of veterinary literature documenting the success of these procedures. The objective of our study was to report on the perioperative complications and mortality rate in cats undergoing ureterotomy, neoureterocystostomy, and surgical ureteral stent placement. We also describe the long-term success of intervention, both with regards to the prevalence of persistent clinical signs of urinary tract dysfunction and the prevalence of urinary tract re-obstruction.",

The high incidence of reobstruction warrants appropriate client counseling and judicious follow up. Derangements of sodium and water balance are clinically significant consequences of kidney failure. During hemodialysis, sodium will equilibrate between the patient and the dialysate, providing an opportunity for changes to occur in the patient's plasma sodium concentration (PNa).

The kidneys play an important role in magnesium homeostasis and the renal handling of magnesium is highly adaptable, and when renal function declines significantly, increase in serum magnesium is detected. However, hypomagnesemia is also common in chronic kidney disease (CKD) in human, and it has been associated with the development of vascular calcification and the poor clinical outcomes. Most of studies of serum magnesium concentrations in veterinary medicine were related to a few diseases such as feline and canine diabetes mellitus, canine parvoviral enteritis, and protein-losing enteropathy in dogs, but so far, there is no data in dogs with CKD. The goal of this study was to evaluate the serum total magnesium in dogs with chronic kidney disease in stages 2 and 3 (IRIS). Sixteen CKD dogs were included in the study (stage 2, n = 6; stage 3, n = 10), and they were followed-up for two to 12 months, and the measurements of serum total magnesium (kit MG3880, Randox) were performed monthly. Serum total magnesium was also measured in 10 clinically normal dogs (mean AE SD; 2.24 AE 0.31 mg/dL); the normal range considered for this study was from 1.93 to 2.55 mg/dL. Mean of serum magnesium concentrations in CKD dogs stage 2 and stage 3 were 2.32 mg/dL (SEM AE 0.10) and 2.40 mg/dL (AE 0.07), respectively. Hypermagnesemia (>2.55 mg/ dL) was detected in all dogs in stage 2 (6 out of 6) and in 8 out of 10 (80%) dogs in stage 3, and it was noticed at some point of the follow-up, and usually it was associated with the highest level of serum creatinine. Hypomagnesemia (<1.93 mg/dL) was detected in 5 out of 6 dogs (83%) in stage 2 and in all dogs (100%) in stage 3 at some point, and usually it was detected in the beginning of the follow-up. No correlation was observed between serum magnesium and serum urea, creatinine, ionized calcium, total calcium, bicarbonate and phosphorus. In conclusion, magnesium may be considered as an indicator or a marker of progression of CKD in dogs, since the impairment of renal function may result in hypermagnesemia, as it has been observed in humans with CKD. In other hand, it has been well proven that in humans and rats, hypomagnesemia is associated with faster deterioration of kidney function and vascular calcification. The role of magnesium in dogs with CKD has not been investigated yet, and its clinical importance could be underestimated. Thus, additional studies are needed for the better understanding of magnesium in the pathophysiology of mineral metabolism in dogs with chronic kidney disease.

Median time from neuter to UI signs was 3.43 years, and from first signs to veterinary consult was 21 days. 85.7% of dogs were diagnosed with USMI at initial presentation. Phenylpropanolamine (PPA) was prescribed in 77.45%, diethylstilbestrol in 19.61%, and combination therapy in 2.94% of dogs. This data supports previous studies showing heavier dogs have increased risk for USMI and that its onset occurs within a few years of neuter. Risk association with age at neuter remains controversial. Owners appear likely to seek veterinary care relatively soon after the onset of clinical signs, and in most cases diagnosis of USMI is prompt. Treatment choices may reflect the differences in availability of PPA and estrogenic compounds during the period studied.

Clusterin has been shown to be upregulated during proximal and distal tubular injury. uClus is part of the FDA and ICH renal toxicity biomarker panels for drug development. Clusterin changes are more profound and significant in urine compared to serum during kidney injury events. A commercial EIA kit from Biovendor is available for the quantification of canine clusterin in both serum and urine. A recent study validated the biomarker using this kit in dogs with leishmaniasis. In healthy dogs serum concentrations of clusterin are 1000-fold higher (60-70 lg/mL) than the urinary concentrations (<100 ng/mL).

The results show that the HPC diet was more effective than the LPC diet in promoting the loss of body fat. To evaluate the impact of environmental and dog-specific factors influencing core body temperature (CBT) following exercise, exercise conditioned dogs (n = 12; 7M/5F; age 7-42 months), owned and in training as detection dogs through the University of Pennsylvania, were evaluated on 6 separate occasions over 3 weeks. Exercise training included 5-minute searching, 5-minute agility and 10-minute ball retrieve, with 5-minute rest between bouts. Exercise period was 30-minute or until one designated trainer determined that the dog was not performing adequately (e.g. panting excessively, seeking shade or reluctance to retrieve). Pre-and postexercise heart rate, CBT (ingested temperature monitor; CoreTemp), and venous blood for lactate (Lactate Scout) and blood gas (ISTAT) were collected. A backward stepwise regression was used to evaluate factors predicting CBT. Combining all exercise occasions, median exercise time was 27.5 minutes (range 20-0 minute), median outdoor temperature was 84\u00b0F (range 71-94\u00b0F), and median humidity was 48% (range 36-76%). Mean postexercise CBT was 105.9\u00b0F (range 102.4-108.8\u00b0F). No dog showed signs of heat stress requiring veterinary intervention. Regression analysis determined that the dependent variable peak CBT could be predicted from a linear combination of the independent variables: average duration of exercise (P = 0.019), peak heart rate (beats/min) (P = 0.029), postexercise blood pH (P = 0.027), lactate (P = 0.011), and pCO2 (P = 0.052). Model not significantly influenced by individual dog, dog-age, outdoor temperature, humidity, change from baseline for body weight, venous pO2, or hematocrit. This study suggests that the influence of temperature and humidity are less important in peak body temperature than the metabolic parameters associated with exertion.",

Clinical signs related to capromorelin were limited to salivation and loose stool noted sporadically during the study. Occasional episodes of emesis were observed and considered unrelated to treatment. The higher dose treatments were associated with an increased incidence of reddening/swollen paws. One dog in the 52.4 mg/kg group died when capromorelin was accidentally delivered into the respiratory tract during gavage as confirmed by necropsy. Electrocardiogram data indicated slight increases in the PRQ interval in the 52.4 mg/kg and 9.2 mg/kg groups 1-2 hours following dosing. However, no histological lesions were observed in the heart. In general, clinical pathology and urinalysis parameters were within normal ranges or lacked a consistent dose/time relationship. However, there were slight decreases in red blood cells, hemoglobin and hematocrit that did not appear to be clinically significant in the 52.4 mg/ kg group. Cholesterol, HDL and alkaline phosphatase serum levels were statistically significantly increased in the 52.4 mg/kg group compared to placebo and individual animal values tended to be at the high end or slightly above the normal reference range. Increased absolute liver weights in dogs treated with the 52.4 mg/kg dose of capromorelin were noted. A slight increase in hepatocellular cytoplasmic vacuolation was seen in all capromorelin treated groups. Capromorelin plasma levels increased with increasing dose, were similar on Days 90, 181 and 349 indicating no accumulation of drug and there were no gender-related differences. GH plasma levels increased modestly as expected on Days 1, 170 and 351 following capromorelin treatment. The GH response was controlled by a physiological negative feedback so that the magnitude of the GH response to capromorelin treatment lessened over time. As expected, IGF-1 plasma levels increased following capromorelin treatment and increased levels were sustained over time as evidenced in plasma collected on 1, 7, 14, 21, 28, 62, 121, 170 and 351. The results of this study demonstrated that capromorelin was well-tolerated in dogs dosed up to 52.4 mg/kg for 12 months.

Aratana Therapeutics, Inc., Kansas City, KS, USA Capromorelin, a ghrelin agonist, is under development for use in cats. This controlled, non-GLP, study evaluated the safety of capromorelin in laboratory cats. Two treatment groups were included, following an 11-day acclimation phase, with 4 adult cats receiving an oral placebo solution (Group 1) and 8 adult cats receiving an oral capromorelin solution at 6 mg/kg (Group 2) for 91 consecutive days. All cats were weighed on Days \u00c011, \u00c01, 1, 14, 30, 59, 75 and 91. Physical examinations were performed on Days \u00c011, 1, 30, 59 and 91 and animals were observed at least once daily throughout the study period. On Days 1 through 91, animals were administered a flavored oral solution of placebo or capromorelin once daily via syringe. Hematology, serum chemistry (including fructosamine) and urinalyses were conducted on Days -5 (acclimation) and Days 30, 59 and 91, approximately 1 hour following dose administration. On Days 1, 30, 59 and 91, blood samples were collected prior to daily dose administration and 8 hours post-dose and serum IGF-1 and GH levels measured. Beginning 1 hour post-dose, all cats were offered food during a 6-hour period. Variables of interest included weight gain/loss, food consumption, clinical pathology (hematology, chemistry, and urinalysis), and serum analysis of IGF-1 and GH.",

Additionally, there were no capromorelin-related serum fructosamine level trends and no fructosamine values exceeded normal limits in treated cats. Finally, urine glucose levels were negative except trace readings in one capromorelin treated cat and one placebo treated cat. BUN and creatinine levels were similar for cats in both treatment groups and all values were within the normal reference ranges. Since renal disease is prevalent in cats, the lack of change in the renal parameters might suggest that capromorelin may be used in these patients. This will need to be confirmed in safety studies in these patients. Serum GH levels increased in cats treated with capromorelin compared to placebo controls as expected. The increase of GH was pronounced on Day 1 of capromorelin treatment; however, this increase was attenuated as daily capromorelin treatment progressed, indicating intact negative feedback of IGF-1 on GH secretion. In contrast, the increase of IGF-1 became sustained as daily treatment of capromorelin continued and this peaked at Day 30 and decreased further over time.",

In contrast to humans, canine a 1 -PI (ca 1 -PI) has not convincingly been demonstrated to be an acute-phase protein. This may be due to its species-specific physiologic and pathophysiologic role.

Cardiopulmonary resuscitation is often performed in hospitalized patients, typically based upon the prior establishment of a \"CPR\" code based upon a conversation between the owner and a veterinary team member. Animals may be placed on a do-notresuscitate (DNR) code status. However, in human medicine there often exists confusion as to what a DNR order does and does not mean.

The aim of this study was to determine if cats with urinary obstruction have an inflammatory acute phase response. For that, the concentrations of haptoglobin (HP) and serum amyloid A (SAA) were determined in cats with clinically urinary tract obstruction at the time of diagnosis. Thirty-four cats were included in the study. The animals were between 6 months to 15 years old. Cats were assigned to groups according to clinical signs, hemogram and urinalysis. 16 cats showed clinical signs of urinary tract obstruction and 18 cats were clinically healthy control cats. The HP serum concentrations were measured via haemoglobin binding assay modified for automation on an ABX Pentra Analyser (Horiba Medical, Montpellier, France). SAA concentrations were determined using LAT Eiken Chemical Co. (Japan) modified for automation on ABX Pentra Analyser. The HP concentrations in the control group ranged from 2.02 to 4.12 g/L (median 3.08 g/L) and SAA concentrations in this group were all <5 mg/L. In the clinically obstructed cats the HP concentrations ranged from 2.5 to 6.04 g/L (median 4.04 g/L), SAA concentrations ranged from <5 to 228.5 mg/L (median <5 mg/L), white blood cells (WBC) ranged from 7100 to 24,200/ lL (median 12,195/lL) and neutrophils ranged from 5760 to 18,030/lL (median 11,320/lL). All these parameters were significantly higher (P < 0.05) when compared to the clinically healthy cats. The increases seen in HP and SAA values were accompanied by increases in WBC and neutrophils in the clinically obstructed cats demonstrating an acute phase response in cats with urinary tract obstruction. However, there was no correlation between HP and WBC indicating that these analytes respond with differing dynamics to urinary obstruction and that measurement of acute phase protein could add value to the diagnostic regime for this condition in cats. Serum amyloid A (SAA) is a major acute phase protein in many species. SAA has been reported to be a sensitive biomarker of inflammation in dogs, cats, and horses. The high level of identity between SAA from different species allows measurement of canine, feline and equine SAA using the same immunoassay. The aim of this study was to select antibodies with cross-reactivity for canine, feline and equine SAA from the panel of murine monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) developed against either human or canine SAA.

Cyclosporine is a potent immunosuppressive agent that exerts its effects by decreasing cytokine production by lymphocytes, especially T-cell production of IL-2 and IFN-c. Recent research in dogs has shown that high dose cyclosporine reliably reduces expression of IL-2 and IFN-c, while lower doses of cyclosporine affect cytokine expression more variably.

The plasma amlodipine concentration and the dose in mg/kg remained positively and significantly associated with decrease in SBP in the multivariable model (P < 0.05).",

            "text": "This study showed that the decrease in SBP associated with amlodipine treatment was independently and positively associated with the plasma amlodipine concentration. Cats that required a higher dose to control their SBP below 160 mmHg had a significantly higher SBP at diagnosis of hypertension and therefore required a greater decrease in SBP in order to achieve normotensive control. Administration of the higher dose needed to achieve the target SBP was associated with proportionately higher plasma amlodipine concentrations, suggesting that the difference in dose of amlodipine required is unlikely to be due to a difference in individual cat pharmacokinetics or owner compliance. Based on these results it could be suggested that cats with a SBP\u2265200 mmHg should be started on 1.25 mg amlodipine daily. Further studies are warranted to determine whether differences exist in the pathophysi-ological mechanisms underlying hypertension in the more severely hypertensive group. Sucralfate is a gastroprotectant that has been reported to impair absorption of certain antimicrobials. Our objective was to determine if co-administration of sucralfate and a fluoroquinolone impairs fluoroquinolone bioavailability in dogs and to determine the effect of a 2-hour delay of sucralfate on fluoroquinolone pharmacokinetics. Five Greyhounds were incorporated into a randomized crossover design and administered either ciprofloxacin (25 mg/kg PO) or enrofloxacin (5 mg/kg PO) alone, concurrent sucralfate (1 g oral suspension PO) with ciprofloxacin or enrofloxacin, or sucralfate administered 2 hours after either fluoroquinolone. Fluoroquinolone concentrations were evaluated with liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry. Area under the curve (AUC), time to maximum plasma concentration (T MAX ), and maximum plasma concentration (C MAX ) were compared between groups. Dogs had variable absorption of ciprofloxacin (AUC range: 5.52-22.47 hour lg/mL) compared with enrofloxacin (3.86-7.50 hour lg/mL). Relative bioavailability (%F) of ciprofloxacin was 48% when administered concurrently with sucralfate (with one dog at 8%), and improved to 87% when sucralfate was delayed by 2 hours. In contrast, no significant difference in absorption was demonstrated based on AUC or C MAX when enrofloxacin was administered concurrently with sucralfate as compared with enrofloxacin alone, and %F for concurrent administration was 104%. This study confirmed that oral bioavailability of ciprofloxacin is variable, which could lead to treatment failures or drug toxicity in some treated dogs. When sucralfate and ciprofloxacin are both indicated, a 2 hour delay should be considered to allow improved bioavailability. On the contrary, no drug interaction was documented for concurrent sucralfate and enrofloxacin, and concurrent administration may improve compliance. Transdermal mirtazapine (TM) would be beneficial for ill cats intolerant of pill administration. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the pharmacodynamics of transdermal mirtazapine (TM) in client-owned cats.",

When PHTN is due to left heart disease it is termed post-capillary and is WHO classification II. Pre-capillary causes of PHTN include WHO classification Types I, III, IV and V and may result from many causes including heartworm disease, COPD, and pulmonary vascular diseases. Pulmonary hypertension of all causes has been associated with a guarded prognosis in dogs. In our practice, pre-capillary PHTN, typically without heartworm disease and without thrombotic disease, is a common cause of respiratory signs in Shih Tzu dogs. The purpose of this study is to describe the clinical attributes of a series of Shih Tzu dogs with severe pre-capillary PHTN.",

Foals with hyperproteinemia also had higher mortality rates. We recommend immediate assessment of IgG concentrations in hospitalized foals and those with FTPI should receive prompt immunotherapy. The purpose of this pilot study was to compare both systemic and local immune responses following intranasal or oral vaccination for Streptococcus equi var equi. Eight healthy horses with Streptococcus equi M protein titers <1:1600 were vaccinated with a live-attenuated vaccine intranasally per label instructions or transmucosally (orally) in a two-vaccine series. Both serum and nasal secretions were collected for baseline and 2-and 4-week post booster vaccinations for detection of IgG and IgA. Antibody assessment was performed using a commercially available ELISA for M protein titers and using a novel microbead assay analyzed by the Luminex TM Magpix instrument which utilizes flow cytometric principles. Horses vaccinated by the intranasal route demonstrated a substantial increase in both serum IgG and serum IgA M protein antibody levels post vaccination (P = 0.0006 and P = 0.007, respectively). Horses that were vaccinated by the oral route also demonstrated an increase in the serum IgG M protein antibody levels post vaccination (P = 0.0150), though the increase was of approximately one third the magnitude of that observed in intranasal vaccinates. Orallyvaccinated horses did not show any evidence of response in serum IgA post vaccination (P = 0.15). Because of the small scale of the study, study design limitations, and the unknown protective level of IgG against S. equi, the findings of this study should be interpreted carefully. Results from this study indicate that horses that received the live-attenuated Pinnacle \u00d2 Streptococcus equi var equi vaccine either through intranasal or oral routes showed an increase in serum IgG M protein titer, though the magnitude of the response differed between administration routes.

Placental steroids have been suggested as useful diagnostic markers for pregnancy loss in mares; however, there are few controlled studies that have examined changes in steroids in mares with placentitis. The objectives were to compare plasma concentrations of estradiol 17b and estrone sulfate in mares with placentitis with gestationally age-matched control mares. Pregnant mares (260-280d of gestation) were allocated to a control group (n = 17) and to a group with experimentally induced placentitis (n = 17). Induction of placentitis was achieved via intracervical inoculation of Streptococcus equi ssp zooepidemicus. Plasma was collected at inoculation for mares in the placentitis group or commence for control mares (day = 0), and then daily until abortion or for 12 days post inoculation (DPI). Estrone sulfate concentration was determined by ELISA, whereas estradiol 17b was determined by a chemiluminescence immunoassay. Data were analyzed by mixed models, for DPI and for days from abortion (DFA) for the different steroids. Mares with experimentally induced placentitis aborted within 5-25 DPI. There were significant effects of time (DPI, P < 0.0001; DFA P = 0.0008) and time by group interactions (DPI or DFA P < 0.001) for the concentrations of estradiol 17-b. Concentrations of estradiol 17-b were significantly reduced at 4 DPI and at -2 DFA (P < 0.05).

During the summer and fall months of 2012 Kansas and its neighboring states in the Central Midwestern United States witnessed an unprecedented number of pigeon fever cases, which is typically an arid region disease in horses. This study presents a retrospective Bayesian geostatistical analysis and environmental risk factors associated with the pigeon fever cases received at the Kansas State University Veterinary Health Center and the Kansas State Veterinary Diagnostic Lab. Disease caused by Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis in horses were determined by positive test results for characteristic abscess formation, positive bacterial culture on purulent material obtained from a lanced abscess (n = 82), or positive serologic evidence of exposure to organism (>1:512) (n = 11). Horses negative for these tests (n = 172) were considered absence of disease. Horse demographics, stabled location as well as stabling history 3 months prior to development of clinical signs were obtained through review of medical records or contact with client via telephone. Environmental covariate information was collected from publicly available sources using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and remote-sensing methods; soil attributes from USDA State Soil Geographic Survey (SSURGO), land use/land cover attributes from the USGS National Land Cover Dataset (NLCD), and climate data from NASA Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Prediction of Worldwide Renewable Resources (POWER). The candidate covariates were screened using a linear univariate regression model with individual testing of each covariate and those with significance (P < 0.2) were kept. A Bayesian geostatistical model was performed both with and without covariates. The DIC was lower when covariates were added, giving them some spatial autocorrelation in pigeon fever status among horses. The covariates that remained statically significant after the addition of the covariates into the Bayesian model included: soil moisture, total edge contrast index, and land surface temperature (>33\u00b0C). Increased soil moisture with an OR of 0.53 appeared protective while both total edge contrast (OR 1.27) and land surface temperature >33\u00b0C (OR 1.31) were risk factors for development of disease. This data may lead to future investigations regarding prevention or better management of disease outbreaks. This study represents a small component of a larger study looking to identify potential risk factors for Equine Infectious Anemia (EIA) in Canada. This smaller study used information that accompanied serum sample submissions to the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) National Reference Laboratory between 2009 and 2012 for the purposes of disease investigation, export testing to countries other than the US and Mexico (excluding testing of feedlot horses), and confirmatory testing of laboratory referrals. All disease investigation and export samples were taken by CFIA veterinarians or veterinary inspectors and all laboratory referral samples were taken by CFIA-accredited private veterinarians. An animal was considered positive for EIA when it tested positive by agar gel immunodiffusion (AGID), and only one positive test per animal was retained for the analysis. The association between potential risk factors (equid species, breed, sex, age, coat color, month and year of submission, province and region (Eastern vs. Western Canada)) and a positive test result was examined using binary logistic regression with binomial distribution to calculate odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). A final multivariable model based on nonmodifiable horse characteristics was created from the dataset and P < 0.05 was considered significant. Samples with missing data were excluded from the analysis. Information was available for 5981 submissions, which included 420 animals that tested positive. Based on univariate analysis, breed, province, region, year and month of submission were significant risk factors for a positive EIA result. Age and breed were retained in the final multi-variable model and showed significant interaction. Conclusion: Breed and province/region may be a risk factor for EIA in Canada and may indicate effects of use-specific management factors.",

Patricia Dowling 1 , Ron Johnson 2 , Joe Boison 3 . 1 Western College of Veterinary Medicine, Saskatoon, SK, Canada, 2 Ontario Veterinary College, Guelph, ON, Canada, 3 Canadian Food Inspection Agency, Saskatoon, SK, Canada Phenylbutazone (PBZ) is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug commonly used to treat musculoskeletal pain and inflammation in horses. It is approved for use in horses in Canada and the United States, but product labelling carries the warning \"not for use in horses intended for human food\". This is not a legal prohibition against the use of PBZ in horses intended for slaughter in Canada, but rather a disclaimer that there is no legal Maximum Residue Limit (MRL) established for PBZ in horse tissues, so the detection of any amount of PBZ constitutes a residue violation. Globally, the use of PBZ in horses that may eventually be used for food has been very controversial and the detection of undeclared horse meat in food products in the European Union (EU) in 2013 caused much concern that people were exposed to unsafe residues of PBZ. Because it is very effective, inexpensive and generally safe in horses, PBZ continues to be extensively used in many countries. Because of the human safety concerns and lack of residue depletion data and MRLs for PBZ, the European Union adopted the \"precautionary principle\" and banned PBZ for use in all food animals. Because of the valid and wide spread use of PBZ in North American horses, a lifetime ban is impractical and detrimental to equine welfare. This project was undertaken to provide information on the depletion of PBZ from urine and tissues of horses and to address concerns regarding the risk of PBZ residues in horse meat.",

            "text": "Validated liquid chromatography-mass spectrophotometry (LC-MS/MS) assays were developed for the detection of PBZ and its metabolite oxyphenbutazone (OXPBZ) in equine serum and urine (Maxxam Analytics) and tissues (Canadian Food Inspection Agency). The limits of quantification (LOQ) for the assays were 1 ng/mL for PBZ and 2 ng/mL for OXPBZ residues in serum and urine and 0.5 ng/g for PBZ and OXPBZ in all equine tissues. These LOQs are well below the EU's Minimum Required Performance Limit (MRPL) for analytical methods for phenylbutazone of 5 ng/g. Utilizing horses destined for slaughter and a high dose PBZ treatment regimen (8.8 mg/kg/day for 4 days), we conducted a pilot study to determine the sampling time points for a full drug depletion study. As we predicted, pilot study results indicated that blood concentrations of PBZ and OXPBZ depleted rapidly and did not reflect tissue concentrations. Both PBZ and OXPBZ depleted rapidly from equine muscle, being readily detectable only at the first slaughter time point of 7 days post-PBZ administration. In the full depletion study, using 20 horses slaughtered in groups of 5, we confirmed that even with a very high dose treatment regimen, PBZ depleted very rapidly from equine muscle and that liver is the tissue from which PBZ residues deplete at the slowest rate. While OXPBZ concentrations exceeded PBZ concentrations in urine and were still detected 42 days post-PBZ administration, no residues of OXPBZ were detectable in muscle, kidney, or liver from 21 days post-PBZ administration. Our results indicate PBZ should be the regulatory marker compound and liver should be the target tissue for regulatory enforcement. In conclusion, even after a high dose PBZ treatment regimen, PBZ and OXPBZ deplete rapidly from equine muscle and a lifetime ban on its use in horses intended for human food is not justified. If the medication history of a horse is questionable, pre-slaughter testing of urine or postslaughter testing of liver will prevent PBZ contaminated horse meat from entering the human food chain. Previous work by the authors showed that erythromycin-associated hyperthermia is caused by impaired sweating. The effect of rifampin on erythromycin-induced anhidrosis is unknown. This study compared terbutaline-induced sweating in erythromycintreated foals with sweating responses in foals given rifampin alone or in combination with erythromycin. In separate experimental sessions, 12 pony-cross foals (nine female, three male), 1 month old at enrollment, were each treated for 5 days with erythromycin base (25 mg/kg orally, three times daily), rifampin (10 mg/kg orally, twice daily), or a combination of the 2 medications according to a duplicated 6 9 3 counterbalanced measures design. Quantitative intradermal terbutaline sweat tests were performed on each of three successive days before treatment (baseline) and on days 1, 2, 5, 9, 24, and 39 after treatment began. There was significant (P < 0.0005) suppression of sweating in foals given erythromycin with or without rifampin but no effect (P = 0.800) of rifampin alone. Compared with terbutalineinduced sweating at baseline, values were significantly reduced (P < 0.0005) in foals given erythromycin with or without rifampin at all evaluation days except d 39. The addition of rifampin treatment to the standard erythromycin regimen did not change overall sweating responses to intradermal terbutaline (P = 0.071). Results show that, despite evidence that rifampin reduces bioavailability of a related macrolide (clarithromycin) by more than 90%, the potent anti-sudorific effect of erythromycin is undiminished by concurrent rifampin administration. Development of a voriconazole-containing thermogel for subconjunctival space (SCS) injection could allow for sustained drug delivery to target tissues and improved success in treating keratomycosis. The purpose of this study was to determine if sustainedrelease of voriconazole occurs when combined with a thermosensitive Poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid)-b-Poly(ethylene glycol)-b-Poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA-PEG-PLGA) hydrogel in vitro and to characterize SCS thermogel injection in ex vivo equine eyes.",

Only 10-20% of horses have naturally occurring alloantibodies and cross-match is not always performed prior to whole blood transfusion. We hypothesized that cross-match incompatibility predicts shortened RBC survival time after autologous transfusion in horses. Twenty healthy adult horses were used. Blood type, anti-RBC antibody screen and major and minor cross-match determined 10 pairs. Two pairs were cross-match compatible, and the remainder were incompatible. Donor blood (4L) was collected into citrate phosphate dextrose adenine-1, labelled with NHS-biotin, and transfused into recipients. Post-transfusion samples were collected at 1 hour and 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 14, 21, 28, and 35 days. Proportions of biotinylated RBC were detected by flow cytometry using streptavidin-phycoerythrin. Cross-match incompatibility was significantly associated with decreased survival time (P < 0.001). The half life of transfused incompatible (cross-match >1+) allogeneic equine RBC was 4.7 days versus 33.5 days for compatible RBC. Cross-match >1+ was significantly associated with febrile transfusion reaction (P = 0.0083).

The aims of this study were to evaluate the level of agreement between 1) a modified FLASH protocol (mFLASH, thoracic and left middle third windows excluded) and the surgical diagnosis and 2) transrectal abdominal palpation and the surgical diagnosis. Specific diagnoses of interest included nephrosplenic entrapment, right dorsal displacement, large colon volvulus, and surgical small intestinal lesion. Sequential cases of client-owned horses presenting for evaluation of acute abdominal pain were enrolled in the study. Only horses that were \u22651 year of age and large enough for transrectal abdominal palpation were included. Transrectal abdominal palpation was performed first by the attending clinician and the descriptive findings and tentative diagnosis were recorded in a standardized recording sheet. An mFLASH was then completed and descriptive findings and ultrasound diagnosis recorded. Horses that underwent exploratory celiotomy within 6 hours of evaluation were included in the statistical analysis. Kappa two-way agreement comparisons were performed to assess agreement. Sixty-one cases fit the inclusion criteria. Results showed that mFLASH was in moderate agreement with the surgical diagnosis (Kappa = 0.42, P < 0.001), while transrectal abdominal palpation was in slight agreement with the surgical diagnosis (Kappa = 0.18, P = 0.005).

A diagnostic test with good sensitivity and specificity in early disease remains to be identified. Cortisol accumulates in hair and reflects chronic cortisol levels (i.e., over the entire period of hair growth).

Sepsis is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in neonatal foals. Relative adrenal insufficiency (RAI), defined as an inadequately low cortisol concentration for the severity of disease, has been associated with sepsis in newborn foals. In addition to cortisol, adrenal gland synthesizes a number of biologically important steroids, steroid precursors and neurosteroids.

Cortisol binding globulin (CBG) binds circulating cortisol in plasma, and regulates the amount of free cortisol available in circulation by influencing metabolic clearance rate. Free cortisol is the only form that is able to enter cells to bind cytosolic cortisol receptors, and thus has long been presumed to be the biologically active form of cortisol. However, recent research in rodents and humans suggests CBG-bound cortisol may interact with cell-surface receptors on neutrophils to mediate some of cortisol's antiinflammatory effects. Previous research has shown that neonatal foals have dramatically increased serum free cortisol levels compared to adult horses, but many septic neonatal foals still exhibit exaggerated pro-inflammatory responses consistent with criticalillness related cortisol insufficiency (CIRCI). This disparity between increased circulating free cortisol but clinical evidence of cortisol insufficiency in some septic neonatal foals could be explained by limited CBG availability in foals, if CBG-bound cortisol is important for regulating some of cortisol's anti-inflammatory effects in foals as in other species. However, our current understanding of cortisol binding dynamics in neonatal foals is limited, and measurement of CBG concentrations in septic foals has not been reported to date.",

The purpose of this study was to provide an objective evaluation of the wellbeing of a population of working horses. This study investigated wellbeing parameters in a population of working New York City carriage horses. Samples were collected over the course of a 3 day period (August 3-5, 2014). The parameters measured included fecal cortisol, salivary cortisol, and infrared thermography (IRT) of the medial canthus. The parameters used in this study have all been utilized in previous investigations to quantify stress levels in horses in a variety of settings. Collection Day 1, 2 and 3 involved 11, 7 and 8 horses, respectively. Collection days included four collection time points. At time point 1 (TP1), subjects were at rest in their stalls prior to work or the arrival of employees (06:00-08:00am EST). TP2 occurred as harnessed subjects were being hitched to carriages and prepared for work. TP3 occurred immediately after being placed in their stall at conclusion of work day. TP4 occurred 1 hour after horses were returned to their stall. Fecal cortisol samples were collected at TP1 and are used to evaluate chronic glucocorticoid levels. Salivary cortisol and IRT were collected at all four time points and reflect a more acute state of wellbeing. Preliminary evaluation of the salivary cortisol show differences among the time points (v 2 3 = 8.7; P = 0.03) with TP3 (0.96 AE 0.06 ng/mL) being greater (t 25 = 2.5; P = 0.02) than TP4 (0.77 AE 0.07 ng/mL); however, all other time point comparisons were not different (P > 0.05). For the IRT, student t-test indicated that measures between the left and right eye did not differ within time assessments (T = 141.5-144.5 12,12 ; U = 63.5-66.5; P = 0.644-0.773); therefore measures between left and right eye were averaged for comparisons of eye changes among the sampling time points. A One Way Repeated Measures Analysis of Variance revealed no difference (F = 0.114; P 0.952) among time points (TP1-4) eye measures. A similar trend was not evident between the cortisol and IRT data sets. The salivary cortisol variation among TP3 and 4 is a reflection of increased metabolic activity driven by exercise rather than stress. Stress as the driving factor behind salivary cortisol increase would have resulted in a similar increase in IRT which was not observed. Evidence collected thus far indicate no significant perturbation in the state of wellbeing of this population of working horses. Colic is common in horses. Accurate and timely interpretation of clinical and laboratory data at admission are important to determine the need for surgery and the probability of survival. Many studies have evaluated clinical and laboratory findings as indicators for surgery and survival, but few studies were as comprehensive as published by Reeves et al in 1989 and 1990. 1,2 The model was based on a retrospective evaluation of medical records from horses presenting to referral institutions. The model was validated using a subpopulation of horses taken from the medical records, but was never validated in a prospective population of horses with acute colic. The purpose of this study was to prospectively validate surgical and prognosis colic prediction models. 1,2 We hypothesized that the previously developed surgical and prognosis colic model will accurately predict the probability of surgery and survival in horses presented to Louisiana State University Veterinary Teaching Hospital (LSU-VTH) with acute colic.",

The feral population originated from the Dartmoor and Exmoor regions of the UK. History on the horses such as age, sex, breed or discipline for the horses was not available. Once classified as feral or domesticated horses were slaughtered in accordance with appropriate UK legislation. Following slaughter, the gastrointestinal tract was removed and the stomachs separated by an abattoir employee.

A 14 G 9 5.25\" catheter (Angiocath, Becton Dickinson, Utah, USA) was inserted through the skin and into the stomach until it could be observed endoscopically. A 3 m length of high tensile fishing line was passed through the catheter from the outside and into the stomach. Biopsy forceps were used to grasp the fishing line and draw it into the endoscope which was then withdrawn, drawing the fishing line out the nostril. A 20 mm button was attached to the fishing line. Gentle traction was then placed on the fishing line to draw the button back through the nostril and down the esophagus and into the stomach. The endoscope was reinserted to confirm the positioning of the button against the stomach wall. A second button was placed approximately 3-5 cm away from the first button using the same technique. The ends of the two lines were then tied together to create a gastropexy, similar to the abomasal toggle technique described in cattle.

In both horses the tube was located within the ventral glandular fundus approximately 10 cm below the margo plicatus adjacent to the lesser curvature. At this point a pH probe (Comfortec PLUS, Sandhill Scientific, CO, USA) was fitted retrograde through the PEG tube with its location confirmed endoscopically. The probe's insertion distance was noted for future placement. The horses were then adapted to one of two diets; a hay only diet (HAY) or a high grain/low fiber (HG/LF) diet. The HG/LF diet consisted of 1% BW each of grain and hay per day, divided equally into two meals. Each horse was then monitored on their diet for a period of 5 consecutive days. To achieve this; the pH probe was attached to a continuous data logger (Zephyr pH, Sandhill Scientific, CO, USA). The probe was calibrated prior to placement each day and then inserted the previously determined distance and secured. Data recording commenced at 8 am and continued for 23 hours each day. The probes contained two measurement points, 5 cm apart. The location of probe 1 was approximately 1 cm from the glandular mucosa while the second probe sat 5 cm deeper, presumably within the ingesta. Data (median (IQR)) for each horse is shown below. This report describes the successful instrumentation of horses with permanent PEG tubes and their use for the measurement of intra-gastric pH using a technique that allows measurement at multiple points within the stomach. Further, the technique allows for the monitoring of intragastric pH without disturbance to the horse's normal eating behavior, a major limitation of many other models. The procedure can be performed in the standing, sedated horse with minimal specialized equipment. This report describes severe myelosuppression in four American Quarter Horses associated with ingestion of mycotoxin-contaminated hay. The index case (11 year old mare) presented with lethargy, acute perineal edema, hematochezia, fever, patchy alopecia, and petechiation. The horses had recently been fed a new batch of hay (which was later revealed to be improperly cured), which initially caused feed aversion. Bloodwork from the mare showed severe neutropenia and thrombocytopenia and prolonged prothrombin time. Profound myeloid and megakaryocytic hypoplasia was found on evaluation of bone marrow. The mare developed septic peritonitis and was treated aggressively for 8 days with anti-inflammatories, antibiotics, and blood transfusions prior to acute decompensation necessitating euthanasia. Of the remaining horses, two developed similar hematologic findings and all three had alopecia. A second case (19 year old gelding) was referred for treatment with milder signs of petechiation and patchy alopecia and was noted to have similar bone marrow findings to the mare; this horse recovered after treatment with antiinflammatories and antibiotics. The two remaining horses (8-and 6-year old mares) were managed conservatively and recovered. Toxicological testing on the hay revealed high levels of mycotoxins, including T-2 toxin and vomitoxin (both known myelotoxicants; 1627 ppb and 1.1 ppm, respectively).",

The clinical course of these cases suggests that spontaneous recovery is possible following severe myelosuppresion due to tricothecene intoxication in horses. Placentitis is an important cause of pregnancy loss and neonatal death in mares. Fetal hypoxia and placental abnormality can be associated with hyperlactatemia in foals; however, data on field cases is scant. The objective of this study was to measure lactate in plasma of foals born from mares suffering with placentitis and from mares carrying and delivering normal pregnancies. A total of 58 Thoroughbred newborn foals were included in this study. Immediately after placental passage, fragments of chorioallantois and amnion were collected and preserved in formalin for histopathologic evaluation. Immediately post-delivery and by 24 hour of birth, each foal underwent clinical examination and blood sampling Plasma lactate was determined by spectrophotometry using a commercial colorimetric kit. Based on placental histopathology and clinical evaluation foals were allocated into four groups as follows: group I (healthy control n = 22) no placental lesions and apparently health foals, group II (placentitis and apparently healthy n = 12), group III (placentitis and abnormal upon clinical examination); and group IV (immature foals and placenta with histopathological lesions compatible with placentiti n = 10). Normality of the data was assessed by Shapiro-Wilk test. Oneway ANOVA was used to evaluate the lactate concentrations in different groups Significance was set at P < 0.05. Concentrations of lactate were significantly increased in groups III and IV at 24 hours after birth; however, foals in groups I and II concentrations presented a reduction in lactate from birth to 24 hours post-delivery. Our findings demonstrate that lactate can be used to identify sick foals which screen apparently normal foals born from mares with placentitis. It is important to emphasize that groups I and II presented lactate concentrations within normal ranges, demonstrating full capacity of neonatal adaptation of group II, despite placental pathology. Borrelia burgdorferi causes Lyme disease via Ixodes scapularis and pacificus tick vectors. A safe and effective vaccine is essential in the prevention of equine Lyme borreliosis. A USDA canine approved outer surface protein A (OspA) vaccine may be promising in this regard and has been used by many equine practitioners. The purpose of this study was to identify the humoral immunogenicity of this vaccine in horsess Forty-three healthy horses were identified for this study. These horses were selected for their improbable contact with Borrelia burgdorferi due to their life long desert habitat. Serological testing for OspA+C+F was completed prior to vaccination. Group-TD (20 horses, mixed breed, five females, 15 geldings) was administered 1 mL (1/2 mL/site) vaccine transdermally over the pectoral region. Group-SQ (20 horses, mixed breed, four females and 16 geldings) were administered 2 mL at the right cervical region. Group-C (3 horses, mixed breed 2 females and 1 gelding) were untreated. Vaccine was administered on day 0 and 21, and 225. Antibodies to OspA + C + F were quantified on day \u00c045, 22, 42, 93, 179, 244, 313, 361 using diagnostic laboratory multiplex assay. At day 41 all horses responded. Median Fluorescent Intensity (MFI) was 15829.3 AE 2031.7 (MeanAESE) in the Group-TD with a 39 AE 9.0 fold increase over baseline. Group-SQ responded with a 14580.2 AE 1671.1 MFI which translated to a 44.43 AE 7.6 fold increase over baseline. Group-TD responded at Day 244 (postvaccine 3 at 225 days) with 15682.4 AE 2773.38 MFI, which translated to a 44.43 AE 7.6 fold increase over baseline. Group-SQ responded on Day 244 with 16140.1 AE 2431.1 MFI which translated to a 39.99 AE 6.7 fold increase over baseline. There were no evident differences in OspA between age, sex, breed or route. The lack of difference between the routes would suggest the lesser dose via the transdermal route in the pectoral region elicits an equivalent OspA response as a 2 mL dose administered subcutaneously. Minor reactions (<4 mm swelling) occurred at the vaccination sites in Group-TD and Group-SQ at 24.6% and 34.5% respectively. The reactions occurred most commonly in the same horses at 75% and 53% of the time in TD and SQ groups respectively.",

Pneumonia is the most common cause of morbidity and mortality in foals <6 months of age. In contrast, pulmonary immunocompeteny in adult horses appears more robust given resistance to the same diseases that cause clinical manifestations in foals. We speculated that there would be quantitative and qualitative differences in the cell populations recovered in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) that could provide insight into the progressive age-related gain in immunocompetency. Serial BALF was collected from a cohort of healthy foals at 1 week; 1, 2, 6, 12 and 18 months of age. BALF from foals was then compared to BALF collected from healthy adult horses. Cellular morphologic evaluation and 300 cell differentials were performed on cytocentrifuged BALF samples. Foals had significantly higher percentages of macrophages than adult horses at 1 week, 1 month, 2 months, and 6 months of age; this difference was no longer noted at 12 months of age. Foals had significantly lower percentages of lymphocytes in BALF than adult horses (week 1, months 1, 2, and 6). Furthermore, foals had a significantly higher percentage of macrophages compared with adults, characterized by a progressive increase in percentage of macrophages concurrent with an increase in age. To better define potential qualitative differences in pulmonary-alveolar macrophages (PAMs) between adult horses and foals, a longitudinal analysis of reactive intermediate activity between adult and foal PAMs was performed with samples from a subset of foals (n = 3) at age 1 week, 1, 6 and 12 months. In vitro measurements of superoxide and peroxynitrite were obtained using oxidation of dihydroethidium (DHE) and dihydrorhodamine (DHR) as indicators, respectively. PAMs were gated and sorted as live cells expressing CD172a, seeded in triplicate into 96-well plates, and allowed to adhere for 2 hours. PAMs were then stimulated with LPS (2 lg/mL) + IFNc (10 ng/mL); opsonized zymosan (0.5 mg/mL) or R. equi antigen (75 lg/mL) and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 30 hours. DHE or DHR was added 30 minutes prior to fluorimetry (BMG Labtech FluoStar Omega). For all stimulants, we documented an age-related progressive increase in production of superoxide and peroxynitrite with foals exhibiting lower levels of reactive intermediates at week 1 compared to month 12 (P < 0.05). Taken together, these results reveal a decreasing shift in percentage of PAMs in BALF as foals age along with a concurrent age-related increase in reactive intermediate production by PAMs. These results support the notion that the pulmonary cell population changes as foals age, with a large percentage of macrophages having decreased capacity for reactive intermediate production early in life. Collectively, these findings are consistent with age-related susceptibility of foals to pneumonia caused by the macrophage-tropic bacterium, R. equi. Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis biovar equi infection in horses, also called pigeon fever, has not been reported in Alabama. Our previous studies had surprisingly identified positive synergistic hemolysis inhibition (SHI) titers in a number of healthy horses. The purpose of this study was to investigate the seroprevalence of C. pseudotuberculosis in this non-endemic population; and to determine the association of detectable titers with exposure to small ruminants with or without history of caseous lymphadenitis, or with previous travel to endemic states.",

Mixed linear model (MLM) analysis using a dominant model identified one marker that surpassed the threshold for genome-wide significance (P = 9.50 9 10 \u00c07 ) after Bonferroni correction. The marker is in an intron of TSPAN9, a gene expressed in endothelium and platelets. Four of the top 20 markers (P \u2264 2.58 9 10 \u00c04 ) were in an immune gene cluster including an interferon gamma receptor. A separate Bayesian analysis of the same marker set identified four windows that each accounted for >1% of the genetic variance and harbored significant quantitative trait loci.",

Maternal antibodies have been reported to exert a significant inhibitory effect (maternal antibody interference) on the immune response of foals to various antigens contained in commercial vaccines. Based on previous information, it has been recommended that primary immunization of foals born to vaccinated mares should not begin prior to 6 months of age following the decline of maternally-derived antibodies.

Previous work by the authors showed that erythromycin-associated hyperthermia is caused by impaired sweating. Whether or not the macrolides clarithromycin and azithromycin also induce anhidrosis is unknown. This study evaluated the sweat response in foals treated with azithromycin, clarithromycin and erythromycin. In serial experiments, 12 foals (four females, eight males), aged 1 month, were treated orally for 5 days with erythromycin (25 mg/kg, 3 times daily), azithromycin (10 mg/kg, once daily) and clarithromycin (7.5 mg/kg, twice daily) according to a masked, duplicated, 6 9 3 counterbalanced design. Quantitative intradermal terbutaline sweat tests were performed on 3 successive days before treatment (baseline) and on days 1, 2, 5, 9, 24, and 39 after treatment began. There was significant (P < 0. 05) suppression of sweating when foals were given any of the 3 macrolides. Compared with terbutaline-induced sweating at baseline, values were significantly lower on all evaluation days when foals were given erythromycin, on days 2 and 5 after beginning treatment when given clarithromycin, and on days 1, 2, and 5 when given azithromycin. Overall suppression of sweating by erythromycin at the dose used in the study was significantly greater than that induced by either clarithromycin or azithromycin; however, there was no difference between the effects of clarithromycin and azithromycin. Results show that all of the macrolides commonly used for treating or preventing Rhodococcus equi pneumonia in foals suppressed sweating responses to varying degrees. Foals treated with any of these antibiotics should be considered at risk for hyperthermia. Lower airway inflammatory diseases (Inflammatory Airway Disease and Heaves) are common conditions of variable severity in horses. While alterations in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) cytology is a characteristic finding in affected horses, the degree of lower airway inflammation is not correlated with the severity of lung function impairment. Furthermore, currently, little is known of the inflammatory and remodeling processes affecting the central airways in these horses. We developed a semiquantitative scoring system for the assessment of endobronchial biopsy morphology and hypothesized that it would allow differentiating horses with heaves from controls, independently from their clinical status (exacerbation or remission).",

If blood is measured using the Precision Xtra \u00d2 , then we recommend using the following equation: Interleukin-10 (IL-10) is expressed by intraepithelial lymphocytes of calves following infection with Cryptosporidium parvum but its role in the pathogenesis of diarrhea is unknown. Studies have shown that IL-10 knockout mice become resistant to C. parvum infection. Oral administration of chicken egg yolk antibodies as a means of controlling enteric disease in calves is of significant interest to the dairy industry. Egg yolk IL-10 antibodies have been shown to survive gastrointestinal transit, are accessible in the intestinal lumen and remain locally active, without interference of natural immunity or persistence of systemic residues. A double-blinded, randomized, prospective clinical trial was conducted to investigate the effects of feeding IL-10 antibodies on calf health, C. parvum oocyst shedding, days of diarrhea, fecal pH, antibiotic use and average daily gain in dairy calves. The study included 134 calves randomly assigned into a treatment group (fed 0.96 g egg yolk powder with IL-10 antibody per day for 11 days) or a control group (fed 0.96 g of egg yolk powder without IL-10 antibody per day for 11 days). Each calf received a health score based on attitude, appetite, temperature, ocular and nasal discharge, cough, ear position, navel and joint assessment daily for 14 days. Hydration status, fecal pH, and fecal pathogen (C. parvum, Coronavirus, Rotavirus, and Salmonella) testing were conducted two or three times in the first 14 days and growth, respiratory health and antibiotic use were assessed at the conclusion of the trial on day 56. Results showed 8% of calves in the treatment group had respiratory disease compared to 21% of calves in the control group at day 56 (P < 0.04). In addition, 11.1% of calves in the treatment group were administered antibiotics by farm personnel compared to 25.8% of control calves (P < 0.03). Fecal pH was significantly increased in the treatment group on day 14 compared to enrollment day (P < 0.0001). The average of the days of diarrhea was not significantly different between the two groups except during the first 4 days. The treatment group had 0.49 days of diarrhea compared to the control group that had 0.36 days of diarrhea (P < 0.02). There was no difference between groups in fecal shedding of C. parvum at day 5 or day 14 (as measured by RT-PCR CT values). Although, no significant difference in average daily gain was noted between groups, the hipometer estimated weight at day 56 was significantly greater for calves in the treatment group compared to the control group (P < 0.02). We suggest that the increased fecal pH in the treatment group may be an indication of improved gastrointestinal health. Using the common mucosal immune hypothesis, we surmise that enhanced mucosal immunity and host defenses in the gastrointestinal tract resulted in less respiratory disease in treated calves. Future directions include dose response and duration of treatment studies with more detailed focus on parameters of gastrointestinal and respiratory tract health.",

Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, USA Fenbendazole (FBZ) is a widely used anthelmintic that interferes with microtubule formation and is considered safe in ruminants. Studies have evaluated a 39 dose (15 mg/kg, PO, q24h for 3 days) for treatment of Giardia-induced diarrhea without complications. Other benzimidazoles have been toxic in a variety of species, resulting in bone marrow hypoplasia and intestinal crypt epithelial necrosis. This abstract describes the clinical findings and necropsy examinations of three 2-monthold Holstein heifer calves with presumptive FBZ toxicosis. The calves had received two courses of greater than 39 the labeled dose of FBZ for 3 days, no FBZ for 3 days, then another 3 days of treatment for presumptive Giardia-induced diarrhea. Clinical signs included fever, tachycardia, dyspnea, profuse diarrhea, and recumbency. All three animals had a persistent and absolute neutropenia. Despite treatment, one calf was euthanized due to a poor response and one calf died. Histologic examination of liver, lung, and intestinal epithelial cells revealed hyperplasia, cell atypia, irregular mitotic figures, and/ or ring mitosis and abnormally clumped chromatin. The bone marrow was hypoplastic with an overall cellularity <5%. The feces were negative for Salmonella spp., bovine viral diarrhea virus, rotavirus, and parasites, and positive for bovine coronavirus. The third calf was treated on-farm and recovered over several weeks. Based on histopathology and history of multiple animals affected, a toxic etiology was suspected, with the only common exposure being repeated administration of high-dose FBZ. This suggests that judicious use of FBZ in calves is warranted. The purpose of this study was to use molecular techniques to determine if dairy heifers are colonized with the same coagulase negative staphylococci (CNS) species before calving that are causing CNS intramammary infections (IMI) at parturition. Holstein and Guernsey heifers at the University of Missouri Foremost Dairy were longitudinally enrolled in the study. Samples including pre-partum mammary quarter secretions and swabbing samples of the teats, muzzle, perineum, and inguinal region were collected at approximately 14 day from expected calving date. Swabbing samples were collected using gas-sterilized electrostatic dusters (Swiffers \u00d2 ). At calving, mammary quarter foremilk samples were collected twice, at approximately 3-5 and 7-9 days post-partum, for bacterial culture and somatic cell counting.",

The footage was consolidated into a 3-second segment with each animal's identification followed by 15 seconds of the animal standing in the alley. Students viewed the videos and estimated weights to the nearest pound. Seventy-one students participated, 30 Animal Science and 41 DVM students. Goats ranged from 78-208 lb (mean 121.9 lbs). Overall, students underestimated weights 65.2% of the time. Weight estimations were within 10% of the actual weight only 36.6% of the time. Prior livestock experience and student classification had no significant effect on the number of estimates within 10% of the actual weight. The weight of the goat was also not significantly associated with accuracy of liveweight estimation. Results indicated that underestimation of goat live-weight is frequent, and that livestock experience prior to and during veterinary education does not have a significant effect on weight estimation accuracy. This study highlights deficiencies in live-weight estimation of goats in animal science and veterinary trainees, which may be a contributor to anthelmintic resistance. Chronic or vagal indigestion refers to a group of functional and/or mechanical disturbances of the stomachs that result in impairment of the gastrointestinal transit. The term chronic indigestion (CI) is generally used to describe a ruminant presented with the following clinical signs: poor appetite, weight loss, abdominal and ruminal distension, dehydration, reduced fecal output and bradycardia. Many other terms have been used over the years, vagal indigestion being the one bringing the most confusion since it implies that the vagus nerve is necessarily involved in the pathophysiology of the disease.",

Study population included 832 goats of which 106 had silica uroliths and 16,366 control goats. Information about age, breed, sex, reproductive status, geographic location, season of the year, and anatomic location, were used to identify risk factors. Pygmy, Nubian, Nigerian dwarf and mixed breeds were more likely to develop silica urolithiasis than other breeds. Breeds of African origin (including Pygmy and, Nigerian Dwarf) comprised 56% of cases. Neutered male goats had significantly increased risk of developing silica uroliths. A significant association was found between breed, sex, reproductive status, geographical location, season, and anatomic location and detection of silica uroliths in goats.

Calves that received intravenous isotonic sodium bicarbonate, hypertonic 7.2% NaCI, sodium lactate and sodium acetate solutions along with oral electrolyte solution had an increase in venous blood pH, HCO 3 concentration, and base excess within 4 hours after the beginning of the administration. Increase in plasma volume and sodium concentration, but decrease in serum total protein were observed within 0.5 hours following administration of hypertonic 7.2% NaCI +oral electrolyte solution combination compared to other solution. The results of the study show that administration of IV hypertonic 7.2% NaCI solution in small volume along with oral electrolyte solution provided fast and effective improvement of dehydration and acid-base abnormalities within short time in treatment of calf diarrhea with mild -moderate dehydration and metabolic acidosis, compared to other treatment groups. This study aimed to describe the signalment, history, clinicopathologic and ultrasound findings, and outcome of adult cattle with histopathological diagnosis of cholangiohepatits. This is a report of 10 Holstein cows older than 12 weeks of age suffering from cholangiohepatitis. The diagnosis of cholangiohepatitis was based on the presence of a portal inflammatory infiltrate surrounding and/or infiltrating bile ducts, with or without epithelial damage, and extending into the adjacent lobules. Six cases were diagnosed with based on liver biopsy and four on post-mortem examination. Reasons for veterinary consultation were mostly decreased appetite and obtundation. The median age of the cows was 5 years (range: 3 months-7 years). At admission, five cows had complete anorexia and five had decreased appetite. The median rectal temperature was 38.9\u00b0C (37.7-40\u00b0C). Median heart rate was 98 bpm (78-120 bpm). Icterus was present in three cows. Four cows were mildly dehydrated (5-7%), three moderately (8-10%) and one severely (>10%). Four cows had absence or scant feces, one diarrhea with melena. Comorbidity included photosensibilization (n = 3), abomasal dilation/displacement (n = 2), salmonellosis (n = 2), peritonitis (n = 2), glomerulonephritis (n = 1) obstruction of the bile duct (n = 1). The most remarkable hematology findings include leucocytosis (>12.000 cells/lL) in six cases, marked neutophilia (>4.000 cells/ lL) in eight cases, four cows had toxic changes identified in the neutrophils and hyperfibrinogenemia (>500 mg/dL) was determined in seven cases. Alteration in the serum biochemistry profile included increased globulin levels (>4.9 mg/dL) in six cases, hypoalbuminemia (<3 g/dL) in six cases, elevated AST (>127 IU/L) in six cases, elevated GGT (>39 IU/L) in six cases, and increased total bilirubin (>75 lmol/L) was detected in four cows. Ultrasonographic examination of the liver and the gall bladder may reveal dilation of the extrahepatic and intrahepatic bile ducts, dilation of gallbladder and increased thickness of the wall. Two out six cows diagnosed by biopsy did not survive and 4 were discharged. The median time of hospitalization for the surviving cows was 9.5 days (range: 8-12). On post-mortem examination E. coli was isolated from hepatic/gallbladder tissue from two cases.",

Ante mortem diagnosis may be challenging because clinical signs are unspecific and laboratory results resemble those of a cow suffering of hepatic lipidosis in combination with an inflammatory process (e.g acute metritis or acute mastitis). Although the number of animals included in this study was small, it appeared that the diagnosis of cholangioheaptitis carries guarded prognosis. Values for pharmacokinetic variables are usually obtained in healthy animals, whereas drugs are frequently administered to diseased animals. There is therefore an urgent need to determine whether dosage protocols need to be altered in sick animals.

Of nine pool samples from fleas, the most prevalent pathogen detected was Rickettsia felis (66.7%), followed by Bartonella spp. (22.2%). Of 18 PCR positive samples from dogs, 15 (27.3%) and 3 (16.7%) samples were infected with one and two pathogens, respectively. Of 8 PCR positive samples from ticks, 62.5%, 25%, and 12.5% carried one, two and three pathogens, respectively. Of 6 PCR positive samples from fleas, 66.7% and 33.3% carried one and two pathogens, respectively. Genetic information revealed the presence of E. canis, A. phagocytophilum, B. canis vogeli, B. gibsoni, M. haemofelis, 'Candidatus M. haemominutum', 'Candidatus M. haematoparvum', B. henselae, B. clarridgeiae, and R. felis in dogs or vectors evaluated in this study. Allowing free roaming (P < 0.001) and presence of thrombocytopenia (P = 0.018) were significantly associated with vector-borne pathogen infection. Other factors were not significantly associated with the infection.The findings suggest that infection of vector-borne pathogens in dogs in Chiang Mai, Thailand is common. Dogs can be a potential reservoir for vector-borne infection in cats. Effective tick and flea control in this population is suggested. Thrombocytopenic dogs in the region should be evaluated for vector borne infectious agents. Multiple pathogen detection of vector-borne pathogens in Thailand may be beneficial as some pathogens are sensitive to different medication.ID25PERFORMANCE OF THE ANIGEN RAPID CANIV-4 TEST KIT USING CHARACTERIZED CANINE SAMPLES.

Lauren Wiley 1 , Emily Herrold 2 , Philip Fox 1 . 1 The Animal Medical Center, New York, NY, USA, 2 Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, USAThe tricuspid valve apparatus (TVA) plays a key role in maintaining valvular-ventricular interaction. Little information describing its morphology exists. We prospectively evaluated 16 archived feline hearts to characterize TVA (HCM-n = 8; [median, range] [14 yrs, 2-17 yrs]; DCM-n = 8; [13.5 yrs, 5-17 yrs]; P = 0.66). Using steriomicroscopy, gross structures were examined, photographed, and measured from long axis, four-chamber sections.The TV comprised two mural leaflets (anterior, anteriolateral) and a septal leaflet. Myxomatous degeneration occurred in 1/8 HCM and 4/8 DCM TVs. RV pectination was hypoplastic (6/8 DCM), normal (6/8 HCM, 2/8 DCM), and hyperplastic (2/8 HCM). Broad, 'strut' pectinate muscles (median 4/valve) inserted at the annular junction of mural leaflets in all hearts. Distinctive apical nexuses of obliquely directed pectinate muscles occurred in 2/8 HCM and 7/8 DCM (P = 0.041). At least 1 mural PM occurred in all HCM and 6/8 DCM hearts. Numbers of mural or septal PMs between HCM vs DCM respectively, were NS different (P > 0.05); mural PM diameter (HCM [2.3, 1.1-4.4 mm] vs DCM [1.9, 1.1-3.5 mm] was NS [P = 0.41]); septal PM diameter (HCM [1.1, 0.4-3.4 mm] vs DCM [1.4, 0.4-3.3 mm] was NS [P = 0.21])",

            "text": "The objective of this study was to assess, using a systematic review of the literature, the accuracy of acute phase proteins (AAP): Haptoglobin (Hp), Serum amyloid A (SAA), and Fibrinogen (Fib) as diagnostic tools for cattle with naturally occurring bovine respiratory disease (BRD) when compared with clinical reference standards.A systematic review was performed with eligible studies selected from CAB and MEDLINE from 1946 to 2014. Results were subsequently screened for inclusion and exclusion criteria. The methodological quality of these studies was assessed (by 2 or 3 independent reviewers) using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 (QUADAS-2) to evaluate any risk of bias and applicability concerns for each study. The definition of the reference standards (which always included clinical parameters) was noted. Measures of accuracy (sensitivity (Se), specificity (Sp)) were obtained from the articles or through contact with the authors.A total of 312 studies were identified after removal of duplicates. Based on the title and abstract, 188 studies were non-relevant and 66 studies were experimental BRD, leaving 58 studies selected for full review; from them 23 met our inclusion criteria as diagnostic studies for naturally occurring BRD using one or more of the mentioned APP. Each study used a different BRD/ non-BRD definition. Results of QUADAS-2 assessment of the selected studies are summarized in the following From the 18 authors contacted to obtain data concerning accuracy between the APP and BRD status (i.e. those papers where an email contact for the corresponding author was provided), data from only 5 studies were obtained. Additionally, 1 study contained accuracy information (a 2-by-2 table) for Hp and SAA. Consequently, up to 6 studies (depending on the APP) were included in the meta-analysis. The Se/Sp for each of the selected APP varied from study to study. For Hp, the Se varied from 0.70 to 0.94 and Sp from 0.75 to 1.0 (n = 6). For SAA, Se varied from 0.59 to 1.0 and Sp from 0.43 to 0.87 (n = 4), and for Fib, Se varied between 0.43 and 0.89 and Sp varied between 0.68 and 0.85 (n = 4). Unfortunately due to the low number of stud-ies, we could not assess publication bias or the impact of study design or methodological flaws on test accuracy.In conclusion, the standards for reporting the accuracy or clinical utility of APP in diagnosing naturally-occurring BRD are inconsistent. The absence of a consistent case/non-case definition was frequently observed during this systematic review. The most common types of biases noted during the review processspectrum (patient selection), verification (inclusion of non-consecutive cases) or differential reference (different reference standard for BRD and non BRD cases)could potentially overestimate the apparent accuracy in the studies. Even if several authors have mentioned that the APP could be helpful in BRD diagnosis, it is not possible to conclude this in terms of accuracy from the present study (especially the incremental value of the tests based on the pre-test probability using Bayes' rule). Reporting studies on diagnostic tests following the Standard for the Reporting of Diagnostic Accuracy studies (STARD) is encouraged to improve capability for future meta-analyses. Four antemortem sample collection methods are commonly used to determine the causative agents of bovine respiratory disease (BRD)in dairy calves: nasal swabs (NS), deep nasopharyngeal swabs (DNP), bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), and transtracheal wash (TTW). The objective of this study was to evaluate the agreement between these methods with respect to the isolation of pathogens commonly associated with BRD in dairy calves.Pre-weaned dairy calves identified as having acute BRD were sampled with all four methods. Each sample was submitted for aerobic culture and viral multiplex PCR. The pathogens isolated by each method were compared to the TTW, our antemortem gold standard. Agreement between methods and significance of the results were determined by calculation of the kappa statistic and McNemar's chi-square test, respectively.For the NS, DNP, and BAL, very good agreement was seen with respect to the isolation of P. multocida and M. haemolytica relative to the TTW. For bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV), agreement of the NS relative to the TTW was moderate, good for the DNP, and very good for the BAL. For bovine coronavirus (BCV), agreement of the NS and DNP relative to the TTW was moderate, and good for the BAL. The McNemar's test was only significant for NS and DNP compared to TTW when isolating BCV, indicating that the proportions of positive results were not equal for those methods.Based on this study, BAL has the best agreement with TTW and gives the most diagnostic utility for sampling dairy calves with BRD. Acute and chronic frontal sinusitis in cattle may occur in association with dehorning, traumatic horn injuries, or with respiratory tract disease. The disease is more common in young animals than in adults. A limited number of reports describe sinusitis in beef cattle. The objective of this retrospective study was to provide case-based evidence describing the signalment, history, clini-",
