Although thrombocytopenia is frequently observed in dengue patients, its pathogenesis is still not fully understood. Previous studies have suggested that DENV-induced thrombocytopenia occurs through viral-replication-mediated megakaryopoiesis inhibition in the bone marrow; however, the exact mechanism for megakaryopoiesis suppression remains elusive. In this study, a reductionist approach was applied, in which C57B/6J mice were inoculated with recombinant DENV-envelope protein domain III (DENV-EIII) instead of the full viral particle. Our results demonstrated that DENV-EIII-suppressed megakaryopoiesis is similar to those observed with DENV infection. Furthermore, in agreement with our in vivo analyses, DENV-EIII sufficiently suppressed the megakaryopoiesis of progenitor cells from murine bone marrow and human cord blood in vitro. Additional analyses suggested that autophagy impairment and apoptosis are involved in DENV-EIII-mediated suppression of megakaryopoiesis. These data suggest that, even without viral replication, the binding of DENV-EIII to the cell surface is sufficient to suppress megakaryopoiesis.",

[8] [9] [10] DENV NS1 protein elicited platelet-bound immunoglobulins (Igs) accelerated clearance by phagocytes, complement-mediated lysis, and that activation of platelets, leading to the development of thrombocytopenia. 11 Studies have revealed that platelets were infected by DENV and produced dengue viral-like particles in patients with dengue. 12, 13 All of these studies have demonstrated that thrombocytopenia can be induced by anti-DENV NS1 antibody elicited-platelet destruction or directly through DENV infected platelet induced-platelet dysfunction in the peripheral blood.",

Furthermore, direct infection of the bone marrow MKs by DENV has been demonstrated in a nonhuman primate model and in dengue patients, [17] [18] [19] and the production of viral particles in MK-erythrocyte progenitor cells 20 has also been demonstrated.

The virion contains 3 structural proteins [capsid (C), membrane (M), and envelop (E)] and the RNA genome. The E protein is the major protein on the virion surface. The E glycoprotein can be divided into 3 functional domains: the central domain (domain I; EI), the dimerization and fusion domain (domain II; EII), and the receptorbinding domain (domain III; EIII). 21 In the absence of direct viral infection, human hepatitis C virus envelope glycoprotein 2 can induce an inflammatory response and apoptosis in human umbilical vein endothelial cells. 22, 23 However, whether the binding of DENV-EIII to the cellsurface receptors can similarly induce cellular signaling and toxicity remains unclear. The differentiation of haematopoietic progenitor cells, including MKs, is extremely sensitive to the perturbation of cellular signaling. [24] [25] [26] Accordingly, in this study, we hypothesized that DENV-EIII could suppress megakaryopoiesis. To test this hypothesis, the in vivo effect of DENV-EIII on megakaryopoiesis suppression was evaluated in a mouse model. A colony-forming unit (CFU) assay of MKs (CFU-MK assay) and megakaryocytic differentiation were performed in vitro using human cord blood-derived CD34 C cells and mouse bone marrow cells.",

To achieve a sufficient quantity and easy purification of the induction protein, a DNA fragment encoding DENV-EIII was subcloned into a pET28a expression vector (Novagen, Madison, WI) through EcoRI cutting. The BamHI cutting site was filled in to enable the in-frame construct to translate recombinant DENV-EIII protein fused to a 6-His-Tag. The plasmid Den2E3/pET28a was transformed into the Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3), which was induced to express recombinant protein at 37 C for 4 h by adding isopropyl b-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside at a 1 mM final concentration when the culture medium reached the mid-log phase (OD 600 between 0.6-0.8). Recombinant DENV-EIII protein was purified using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) metal-affinity chromatography matrices (Qiagen, TAIGEN Bioscience, Taipei, Taiwan) under denaturing conditions, according to the manufacturer's instructions with some modifications. Briefly, the inclusion body containing DENV-EIII obtained after sonication in a lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 50 mM NaCl, and 1 mM EDTA) was denatured by 8 M urea. The cell lysate and Ni-NTA resin were incubated in a binding buffer (8 M urea, 100 mM NaH 2 PO 4 , and 10 mM Tris-HCl; pH D 8) at room temperature for 1 h and were then loaded into a column and washed with a washing buffer (8 M urea, 100 mM NaH 2 PO 4 , and 10 mM Tris-HCl; pH D 6.3) containing 1% Triton X-114 (Sigma-Aldrich) to remove endotoxins. 27 The recombinant protein was eluted by an elution buffer (8 M urea, 100 mM NaH 2 PO 4 , and 10 mM Tris-HCl; pH D 4.5) and refolded using a linear 4-0 M urea gradient in a dialysis buffer (2 mM reduced glutathione, 0.2 mM oxidized glutathione, 80 mM glycine, 1 mM EDTA, 50 mM Tris-HCl, 50 mM NaCl, and 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) at 4 C for 2-3 h. Glutathione-S transferase (GST) recombinant protein was used as the control protein. The expression plasmid pGEX-2KS 28,29 was transformed into the E. coli strain BL21 (DE3) and induced to express the protein, which was purified according to the protocol of our previous study. 30 Endotoxin contamination was verified through the Limulus Amoebocyte Lysate assay (Lonza), according to the manufacturer's instructions as described previously. 28, 31 Antibodies generation and purification Antibodies against DENV-EIII were generated and purified following the procedure detailed in a previous study with some modifications. 30 Protein G Sepharose 4 Fast Flow (GE Healthcare) was used to purify immunoglobulin G (IgG) from the serum of DENV-EIII immunized rabbits according to the manufactory's instructions. Eluted IgG was dialyzed using normal saline (0.9% NaCl) and concentrated using polyethylene glycol 20000. The IgG from preimmunized rabbit serum was purified using the same protocol.",

[37] [38] [39] Flow cytometry and propidium iodide (PI) staining revealed that the percentages of differentiated MK (large, CD61 C cells in the R1-gated region) and polyploid cell (DNA content 4N) populations in the R1 region were significantly suppressed in DENV-treated mice compared with saline-treated mice (Fig. 1C , D, and E), suggesting that DENV suppressed megakaryopoiesis in mice. To investigate whether DENV-EIII is sufficient to suppress megakaryopoiesis in mice, experimental mice were treated with DENV-EIII (3 mg/kg) every 12 h for 3 cycles (Fig. 2A) . Our data revealed that compared with saline and GST-treated groups, DENV-EIII-treated mice displayed significantly lower counts of R1 cells and a lower percentage of polyploid cells in the R1 region (Fig. 2C, D, and E) ; a similar response was observed in DENV-treated mice (Fig. 1C , D, and E).

DNA content analysis using PI staining revealed that compared with GST, DENV-EIII reduced the percentage of polyploid cells and increased the percentage of sub-G1 cells significantly ( Fig. 3B and D) . This suggests that DENV-EIII suppresses megakaryopoiesis in primary cultured mouse haematopoietic progenitor cells present in the bone marrow. To investigate whether DENV-EIII can directly bind MKs, murine MKs purified from the bone marrow were incubated with DENV-EIII at 4 C for 1 h. Then, they were stained with anti-CD61 antibody to identify MKs and stained with anti-DENV-EIII antibody (Western blot analysis revealed that anti-DENV-EIII antibody specifically bound to DENV-EIII, Fig. S2 ). After flow cytometry analysis, the data revealed that the percentages of CD61 and DENV-EIII double positive cells are significantly increased when compared with controls without adding DENV-EIII or anti-DENV-EIII antibodies (Figs. 3E and F). This indicated that DENV-EIII could bind directly on the surface of MKs.",

            "text": "Next, we investigated the mechanism through which DENV-EIII treatments lead to megakaryopoiesis suppression. Megakaryocytic differentiation was performed using human umbilical cord blood-derived CD34 C cells in a 16-day experiment (Fig. 5A ). Consistent with a previous report, 24 the cell size (FSC) and cellular granularity (SSC) were increased after the induction of differentiation ( Fig. 5B ; Day 0 vs. Day 16-Vehicle). Compared with the vehicle and GST treatments, DENV-EIII decreased the cell number in the R1 region and increased the cell number in the R2 region (Fig. 5B, C, and F) . Flow cytometry and PI staining revealed that the percentages of CD61 C (premature MK), CD61 C /CD42b C (mature MK), and sub-G1 cells in the R2 region were increased significantly in the DENV-EIII-treated groups compared with the vehicle and GST-treated groups (Fig. 5D, E, and G) . These results suggest that DENV-EIII suppresses megakaryopoiesis partly by initiating cell death in premature and mature MKs. Recent studies have revealed that autophagy plays an essential role in megakaryocytic differentiation, and the loss of autophagy leads to failure in megakaryopoiesis. 40, 41 Our data revealed that the percentage of autophagic cells was decreased in the R1 region and increased in the R2 region in the DENV-EIII- . DENV-EIII killed differentiated MKs derived from mouse bone marrow. Murine bone marrow cells (erythrocyte-depleted fraction) were isolated and triggered to differentiate into MKs in the presence of mouse thrombopoietin. The GST protein was used as a control. DENV-EIII or GST protein was added on Day 0 and Day 3, and data were analyzed on Day 6 through flow cytometry (A). Cells were stained with CD41 antibodies, and CD41 C cells were gated to analyze DNA content through PI staining (B). The percentages of R1 cells among all analyzed cells (C), and the percentages of polyploid cells (DNA content 4N) and sub-G1 hypoploid cells in the R1 region are shown (D). Murine MKs were isolated from bone marrow, incubated with DENV-EIII proteins for 1 h, and stained with antibodies against DENV-EIII and CD61. IgG isolated from preimmunized rabbit serum served as control Ig (CIg). Cells were divided into 3 groups: anti-CD61 C anti-EIII, EIII C anti-CD61 C CIg, and EIII C anti-CD61 C anti-EIII. The percentages of CD61 C /DENV-EIII C double positive cells among the total cells and total CD61 C cells were analyzed (E) and quantified (F). Data are reported as the mean \u00a7 SD and represent 4 ((C)and D) and 3 (F) independent experiments. \u00c3 P < 0.05, \u00c3\u00c3 P < 0.01 compared with the GST-treated groups (C, D). treated groups compared with the vehicle-treated and GST-treated groups ( Fig. 6A and D) . In addition, the intensity of Cyto-ID in the R2 region was lower than that in the R1 region in the DENV-EIII treated groups [ Fig. 6A , Day 16-EIII (R1) vs. Day 16-EIII (R2)]. These results indicate that DENV-EIII triggers impaired autophagy. Furthermore, to verify whether the cell death of these CD61 C (premature MK), CD61 C /CD42b C (mature MK), and autophagy-impaired cells was associated with apoptosis, annexin V and activated caspase-3 staining was performed in flow cytometry. Our results revealed that compared with the vehicle and GST treatments, DENV-EIII produced significantly more annexin V C and active caspase-3 C cells in the R2 region (Fig. 6B , C, and D). Taken together, our data indicate that DENV-EIII suppresses megakaryopoiesis in human cord blood CD34 C cell cultures through autophagy impairment and apoptosis.",

Our data suggested that DENV-EIII can directly bind MKs ( Fig. 3E and F) and that DENV-EIII alone is sufficient to elicit MK suppression and decrease platelet numbers, similarly to the in vivo effect of DENV ( Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 , 24 hr). The result is consistent with the in vitro data obtained from mouse (Fig. 3 ) and human cells (Fig. 4 -6) . Our reductionist approach (use of mouse cells/mouse models) supports a simple way to focus on the effect of DENV-EIII on megakaryopoiesis irrespective of any viral replication; however, the approach can't totally mimic real DENV infections especially in vivo models. DENV cannot replicate in mice, DENV nonetheless induces elicitation of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-a, 36 which is well known to elicit thrombocytopenic responses. 44, 45 This is probably the reason why DENV injections have a higher potency than DENV-EIII on the elicitation of thrombocytopenic response (Fig-1B vs. Fig-2B, 48 hr) .",
