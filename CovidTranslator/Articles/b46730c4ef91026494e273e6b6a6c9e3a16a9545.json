This technique mixes patients' serum with neutrophils. The presence and pattern of any binding by ANCA can then be revealed by subsequent fluorescent staining. A cytoplasmic ANCA staining pattern is typically associated with IgG antibodies to proteinase 3 (PR3) and a perinuclear (p-) pattern to myeloperoxidase (MPO).",

Significant variability in results occurs due to differences in slide preparation and operator experience, and co-existing inflammatory conditions also cause a high frequency of false positive results. 3 In 2003, it was recommended that initial IIF screening for ANCA should be confirmed with a solid phase assay 4 such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). However, the clinically significant epitopes of the target antigens PR3 or MPO can be poorly exposed in the ELISA microtiter well, 5 falsely low concentrations being reported. Newer assays now use an antibody that binds to a distinct \"nonfunctional\" epitope of the antigen to \"anchor\" or \"capture\" the molecule in the support medium. This allows for increased assay specificity and sensitivity. However, variation in antigen preparation, techniques, and a lack of international reference materials means that there is still significant variation in ANCA results. Every patient will also make a slightly different IgG antibody to a particular antigen, and the epitopes of the antigen to which a patient responds may also change during the course of a disease or treatment.",
