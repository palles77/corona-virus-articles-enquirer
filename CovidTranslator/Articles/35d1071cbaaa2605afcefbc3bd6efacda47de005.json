Other multiplex panels and microarrays are being developed or are already available on the market as analyte-specific reagents (ASRs) [2**]. Comparative studies have shown increased sensitivity of real-time PCR assays and of these new multiplex panels compared with traditional viral culture and immunofluorescence testing [1, 3*, 4*].",

Reported rates of infection and progression to lower respiratory tract disease vary by virus, and are in part dependent on viral detection methodology and study design. Table 1 summarizes data from prospective and large retrospective published studies of RVIs among HCT recipients in the last 10 years, and Figure 1 provides cumulative incidence estimates from a recent prospective study in allogeneic HCT recipients [22] . In general, rates of progression to lower respiratory tract infection and deaths attributable to infection have decreased compared with earlier studies from the previous decade. The reasons for this are likely multifactorial, including less immunosuppressive transplant regimens, improved supportive care, more sensitive diagnostics, and early treatment strategies. For example, some studies did not report pneumonia or progression to pneumonia with influenza or RSV, but did specifically note that early diagnosis and treatment of upper respiratory tract infection appeared to be effective in preventing lower tract disease [13, 16] .",

Lung transplant recipients have the highest disease severity and long-term impact related to RVIs, but other organ transplant recipients may also have severe disease and complications. One study of RVIs in 152 SOT non-lung transplant recipients found the most complications among recipients of heart transplants (27.5%), followed by liver (10.7%) and kidney (7.8%) [39**]. A total of 3.7% of RVIs were complicated by pneumonia, and there was no relationship between infection and organ rejection [39**]. Table 2 provides an overview of recent relevant studies of RVIs in lung transplant recipients, highlighting short and long-term consequences. One study using Luminex technology to detect a respiratory virus in 14% of bronchoalveolar (BAL) samples from 52% of lung transplant recipients found an association between RVIs and acute rejection [42**]. Conversely, a similar study using PCR found a respiratory virus in 17% of BAL samples, but acute rejection was not associated with viral detection [46*]. However, detection of respiratory viruses in samples from patients with acute rejection was associated with worse lung function and slower recovery [46*]. Two retrospective pediatric studies showed no association between RVI and acute or chronic allograft rejection, but RVI was independently associated with decreased 1-year survival in one large multicenter cohort [43, 44*]. Thus far, a firm association has yet to be established between RVIs and either acute rejection or chronic allograft dysfunction after SOT, and large prospective studies with comprehensive viral testing and well-controlled multivariable models are needed to further evaluate these consequences.",

Another study reported a higher incidence of KiPyV of 17.8% in respiratory samples from 45 HCT recipients with acute respiratory illness; WUPyV was not detected [27*]. Preliminary results of a prospective study of 196 HCT recipients found KIPyV and WUPyV in nasal wash samples in 18.4% and 7.1% of patients, respectively. Although some positive episodes lasted many weeks, and the viruses were detected in high copy numbers in some patients, detection was not associated with the presence of serious respiratory symptoms in this cohort [29] .",

A recent study in HCT recipients found that, although there was no difference in mortality, pH1N1 infection was significantly associated with pneumonia, hypoxemia, and prolonged viral shedding compared with seasonal influenza A [93] . Importantly, in a multivariable model, even delayed administration of antivirals was shown to be protective in preventing pneumonia, and corticosteroids (\u2265 1 mg/kg) were associated with a reduced risk for mechanical ventilation [93] . One case report describing the detection of influenza RNA in plasma of a patient with respiratory failure suggests that this may be a biomarker for severe disease [114] . Table 3 highlights studies describing pH1N1 in SOT recipients. Many case reports have highlighted the varied severity of pH1N1 disease among specific solid organ recipients [120] [121] [122] [123] [124] [125] . In general; death rates appear consistently lower for SOT than HCT recipients, although one report describes significant mortality after lung transplantation [110] . Delayed antiviral therapy (>48 hours) and diabetes mellitus have been identified as risk factors for poor outcomes [108**, 112] . The largest SOT study included 237 patients from 26 centers with kidney, liver, lung, heart and other organ allograft transplantation [108**]. Adults had more risk of pneumonia and death than children, but children were significantly more likely than adults to receive antiviral therapy within 48 hours [108**] .

With advancements in molecular diagnostics, data are rapidly emerging regarding the overall morbidity associated with these infections. HMPV appears to cause a similar spectrum of disease as RSV, with the potential for severe pneumonia. Recent studies suggest that lower respiratory tract disease appears to be uncommon, although possible, with coronavirus and rhinovirus, and even rarer with bocavirus and polyomavirus infections. Further study is needed to determine long-term sequelae of respiratory virus infections after transplantation, and to define the clinical manifestations associated with new viruses such as HBoV, KIPyV, and WUPyV. Delayed antiviral therapy and lymphopenia were consistently associated with severe disease from 2009 pH1N1, and pH1N1 seemed to cause increased disease severity compared with seasonal influenza A in HCT recipients. The development of oseltamivir-resistant pH1N1 in immunocompromised patients is of concern, and highlights the need for optimized management with early and aggressive therapy and close monitoring. Well-designed studies are essential to fully characterize the epidemiology and long-term sequelae of respiratory viruses so that treatment and prevention strategies can be developed for highly immunosuppressed transplant recipients.

Bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) is a progressive lung alloreaction characterized by airflow obstruction that can occur following allogeneic HCT or allogeneic lung transplantation [35*]. Pneumonia with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) or parainfluenza virus (PIV), and even upper respiratory tract infection with PIV, has been identified as a risk factor for BOS [34, 36]. A recent pediatric study in 104 HCT recipients found RVI to be a predictor of idiopathic pneumonia syndrome and BOS [37*]. Only one study has evaluated BOS prevalence and risk factors since 2005 NIH consensus criteria were defined to standardize the diagnosis of BOS [38*]. In this analysis, the prevalence of BOS after HCT was higher using the new criteria definition, and there was no association with RVI [38*]. Additional investigation using the 2005 criteria will be necessary to further study whether RVI confers risk for the development of BOS.",
