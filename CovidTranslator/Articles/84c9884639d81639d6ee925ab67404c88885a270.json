            "text": "Expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), especially MMP9 correlates with blood brain barrier (BBB) disruption during many neuroinflammatory diseases. During neurotropic coronavirus virus (JHMV) induced encephalomyelitis, MMP9 activity is restricted to neutrophils. Furthermore, myeloid cell depletion implicated MMP9 in facilitating leukocyte central nervous system (CNS) infiltration via loss of BBB integrity. The requirement of MMP9 in BBB disruption was thus assessed in JHMV infected MMP9 deficient (MMP9 \u2212/\u2212 ) mice. Depletion of neutrophils reduced CNS accumulation of monocytes and T cells, albeit without affecting overall pathogenesis. By contrast, infected MMP9 \u2212/\u2212 mice revealed no differences in CNS leukocyte infiltration, composition or localization, consistent with BBB disruption similar to wild type (WT) mice. Unimpaired T cell mediated virus control supported an unexpectedly redundant role of MMP9 in promoting leukocyte access to the brain parenchyma. While MMP9 deficiency did not expand the overall limited pattern of MMP expression during JHMV infection, it coincided with MMP3 upregulation. MMP3 expression remained largely confined to astrocytes, similar to WT mice. These data demonstrate that neutrophil-derived MMP9 is not the sole mediator facilitating parenchymal leukocyte entry via BBB disruption during viral encephalomyelitis. Moreover, significantly enhanced MMP3 expression by astrocytes in infected MMP9 \u2212/\u2212 mice suggests an active role of resident cells in participating and potentially collaborating with infiltrating cells in regulating BBB permeability. Overall, these results highlight the complexity of targeting individual MMPs as a strategy to regulate inflammation.",

However, leukocyte entry into the CNS parenchyma is essential to protect the host following CNS infection. Among key factors controlling BBB permeability are matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), which belong to a large family of endoproteinases primarily involved in turnover and remodeling of the extracellular matrix (Candelario-Jalil et al. 2009 ). CNS infections, degenerative diseases, autoimmune inflammation, as well as stroke are all associated with upregulation of MMPs, which degrade components of the basement membrane and extracellular matrix, thus facilitating leukocyte invasion (Hartung and Kieseier 2000; Parks et al. 2004; Rosell and Lo 2008; Wang et al. 2008) . Intracranial MMP injection into na\u00efve mice supports the role of MMPs in increasing BBB permeability and CNS leukocyte migration (Anthony et al. 1998) . Conversely, inhibition of MMPs decreases BBB breakdown, limits parenchymal leukocyte entry and ameliorates clinical symptoms (Liedtke et al. 1998; Toft-Hansen et al. 2006; Tran et al. 1998) . Furthermore, broadspectrum MMP inhibitors retain leukocytes in the perivascular space supporting a role for MMPs in degrading the glia limitans (Toft-Hansen et al. 2006) .",

The present study used a viral encephalomyelitis model characterized by a highly limited MMP expression pattern (Zhou et al. 2005) to define the role of MMP9 in BBB disruption at the glia limitans. Infections with both lethal and sublethal neurotropic JHM strains of mouse hepatitis virus (JHMV) induce only three MMPs: MMP9 is produced by inflammatory neutrophils (Savarin et al. 2010; Zhou et al. 2003) . MMP3 expression is largely restricted to astrocytes (Zhou et al. 2005; Zhou et al. 2003) . Lastly, MMP12 is produced by both CNS resident cells and infiltrating leukocytes (Zhou et al. 2005) . Compared to the sublethal infection, the lethal infection is characterized by significantly increased neutrophil inflammation as well as MMP expression; combined neutrophil/ monocyte ablation abrogated CNS MMP9 expression and BBB disruption (Zhou et al. 2003) . Anti-CXCR2 treatment to block CNS neutrophil migration during the sublethal infection also reduced CNS leukocyte accumulation, impaired viral control and accelerated mortality (Hosking et al. 2009 ). Together, these data supported a protective role of neutrophils in promoting BBB disruption via MMP9 release.",

Sublethal infection is characterized by early CNS neutrophil and monocyte recruitment, followed by T and B cell infiltration, both critical for virus control (Bergmann et al. 2006) . Neutrophil depletion reduced infiltrating monocytes and T cells by ~50-60%, but did not affect clinical disease or viral control. Surprisingly, infected MMP9 \u2212/\u2212 mice exhibited identical BBB permeability, CNS leukocyte recruitment and distribution as wild type (WT) mice. Analysis of potential MMP dysregulation in the absence of MMP9 revealed a marked, transient increase specifically of MMP3 in the CNS. Similar to WT controls, MMP3 expression was restricted to astrocytes, suggesting that enhanced focal MMP3 activity at the parenchymal side of the BBB contributes to BBB disruption and may compensate for the absence of MMP9. Overall these results demonstrate that neither neutrophils nor MMP9 are essential in mediating protective lymphocyte access to the CNS parenchyma during sublethal viral encephalomyelitis. Limited MMP activation in this model further implicates compensatory or alternative mechanisms breaching BBB permeability.",

            "text": "Sustained BBB integrity coincident with the absence of MMP9 expression in neutropenic mice infected with lethal JHMV suggested that neutrophil-secreted MMP9 disrupts the BBB (Zhou et al. 2003) . However, the rapid mortality after lethal JHMV infection prevented an assessment of altered BBB permeability specifically on CNS T cell recruitment. In addition, a subsequent study using sublethal JHMV infection revealed a role of monocytes in promoting BBB disruption at the glia limitans (Savarin et al. 2010) . To more precisely characterize the role of neutrophil-derived MMP9 in enhancing CNS leukocyte access during sublethal JHMV infection, mice were treated with anti-Ly6G mAb to selectively deplete neutrophils (Daley et al. 2008) . Neutrophil depletion did not affect disease severity or mortality compared to control animals ( Figure 1A and data not shown). Clinical symptoms during sublethal JHMV infection are largely determined by lymphocyte infiltration and antiviral effector function, rather than magnitude of viral replication (Ireland et al. 2009; Kapil et al. 2009; Savarin et al. 2008) . The similar disease course therefore suggested that neutrophils expressing MMP9 were redundant in promoting CNS leukocyte infiltration. Analysis of total numbers of CD45 hi cells within the CNS showed that overall leukocyte infiltration was not affected by neutrophil depletion at day 3 and 5 p.i. ( Figure  1B ). However, at the peak of inflammation (day 7 p.i.) and subsequently, infiltrating cells were reduced by ~50% ( Figure 1B ). In control mice CNS neutrophil recruitment peaked at day 3 p.i. and decreased between day 5-7 p.i., but comprised an overall small fraction of infiltrating cells ( Figure 1C ). Very few neutrophils were detected at any time in the CNS of anti-Ly6G treated mice confirming depletion efficiency ( Figure 1C ). Neutrophil depletion resulted in decreased macrophages (CD45 hi F4/80 + ), CD4 + and CD8 + T cell populations at day 7 p.i., although no differences were evident prior to peak leukocyte accumulation ( Figure 1C ). By day 10 p.i., macrophages were decreased relative to day 7 p.i. in both groups reaching similar overall levels. By contrast, both CD4 + and CD8 + T cell subsets remained reduced in neutropenic mice relative to controls, with differences waning by day 14 p.i. (Figure 1C ). Despite decreased T cell numbers between days 7 and 10 p.i., viral replication was controlled below the level of detection by day 14 p.i. similar to neutrophil sufficient mice (data not shown). These data indicate that neutrophils promote, but are not essential for T cell migration across the BBB or viral control during sublethal JHMV infection.",

MMPs enhance leukocyte penetration through the endothelial cell tight junction, as well as through the glia limitans (Toft-Hansen et al. 2006) . Neither flow cytometry nor NaF measurements distinguish a specific role of MMP9 in this two-step process. To assess whether the absence of MMP9 had more subtle effects on leukocyte localization within the BBB, the distribution of inflammatory cells was quantified following laminin staining to visualize the two basement membranes that define the perivascular space (Savarin et al. 2010) . CNS leukocyte accumulation was too sparse at day 3 p.i. for quantitative analysis. At day 5 p.i. the majority of infiltrating cells were already localized in the parenchyma in both groups of mice ( Figure 3B ). Furthermore, no difference in leukocyte distribution within the perivascular space versus parenchyma was detected comparing WT and MMP9 \u2212/\u2212 mice at days 7 and 10 p.i. (Figure 3B ). Sublethal JHMV primarily infects glial cells and requires T cell interaction with infected cells to diminish viral replication (Bergmann et al. 2001; Savarin et al. 2008) . Similar parenchymal T cell entry was thus further verified by monitoring viral control as a measure of T cell function. The peak, magnitude and decline of infectious virus were all identical in both groups (data not shown), supporting the concept that MMP9 deficiency did not interfere with anti-viral T cell activity. Overall, these results demonstrate that MMP9 does not affect leukocyte entry into the CNS parenchyma during viral encephalitis.",

Unlike other inflammatory models, e.g. EAE (Pagenstecher et al. 1998) , JHMV infection only induces a restricted number of MMPs, namely MMP3 and MMP12 (Zhou et al. 2005) . Therefore, MMP3 and MMP12 were initially monitored as compensatory candidates for MMP9. MMP3 mRNA expression was increased greater than 10-fold in MMP9 \u2212/\u2212 compared to WT mice at day 3 p.i., coincident with peak neutrophil recruitment ( Figure 4B ). While levels remained significantly elevated at day 5 p.i., they declined to similar levels as in WT mice after day 7 p.i. By contrast, no differences in CNS MMP3 mRNA levels were observed comparing neutrophil-depleted and control mice at days 3, 5 and 7 p.i. (Figure 4C ). MMP12 mRNA expression was also elevated in the absence of MMP9, most prominently at day 5 p.i. (Figure 4B ). Similar to MMP3 however, no significant variations in MMP12 mRNA expression were observed comparing neutropenic with control mice ( Figure 4C ). The only MMP inhibitor, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 (TIMP-1), induced during JHMV infection (Zhou et al. 2005) , was also identical in WT and MMP9 \u2212/\u2212 mice. Expression of MMP2, MMP7 and MMP14, upregulated during other neuroinflammatory disorders (Hartung and Kieseier 2000; Rosenberg 2002) , was also assessed to determine if the absence of MMP9 diversified the pattern of MMP expression. MMP2 mRNA was constitutively expressed in the CNS of na\u00efve mice and increased to similar levels in infected WT and MMP9 \u2212/\u2212 mice ( Figure 4B ). However, as previously described (Zhou et al. 2005) , MMP2 enzymatic activity could not be detected in the CNS after JHMV infection suggesting post-transcriptional regulation ( Figure  2A ). In addition, neither MMP7 nor MMP14 mRNA were upregulated in the CNS of either group following infection. Finally, expression of ADAM12 and ADAM17, proteases related to the MMP family (Seals and Courtneidge 2003) , also remained undetectable in the CNS of infected WT and MMP9 \u2212/\u2212 mice (data not shown).

However, in WT mice MMP3 expression by astrocytes is parenchymal (Zhou et al. 2005) , while MMP9 is likely to act on the endothelium and/or glia limitans, posing a physical discrepancy. To address whether MMP3 expression remains restricted to astrocytes in the absence of MMP9, MMP3 mRNA levels were determined in purified populations of CNS infiltrating leukocytes (CD45 hi ), microglia (CD45 lo ) and glial (CD45 neg ) cells. Elevated MMP3 in total CNS RNA from MMP9 \u2212/\u2212 mice was recapitulated primarily in the CD45 \u2212 CNS resident population containing astrocytes, in which MMP3 mRNA was already detectable at day 3 p.i. and increased further at day 5 p.i. ( Figure 5A ); in WT mice MMP3 was not detected until day 5 p.i. and levels were substantially lower. At day 5 p.i. MMP3 mRNA was also elevated in microglia (CD45 lo ) and infiltrating leukocytes (CD45 hi ) derived from MMP9 \u2212/\u2212 mice ( Figure 5A ), albeit at lower levels compared to the astrocyte enriched population. MMP3 protein expression by astrocytes was confirmed by immunofluorescence. At day 3 p.i. all MMP3 positive cells in infected MMP9 \u2212/\u2212 mice co-expressed GFAP ( Figure 5B ), supporting MMP3 expression primarily by astrocytes, similar to WT mice (Zhou et al. 2005) . Moreover, higher MMP3 mRNA levels did not correlate with an increased number of cells expressing MMP3 but rather enhanced expression per cell ( Figure  5C ). As astrocytes are integral components of the glia limitans, their significantly elevated MMP3 production may contribute to disruption of the basement membrane in MMP9 \u2212/\u2212 mice.",

A direct effect of MMP9 in down-regulating MMP3 was ruled out as abrogation of MMP9 via neutrophil depletion in WT mice did not upregulate MMP3. Early MMP3 upregulation following infection suggested the innate immune response might thus provide the induction signal. This is supported by IL-1\u03b2 and TNF mediated induction of MMP3 and MMP9 in cultured astrocytes and microglia (Crocker et al. 2006; Gottschall and Yu 1995) . However, similar magnitude and kinetics of TNF and IL-1\u03b2 mRNA expression in the CNS of infected WT and MMP9 \u2212/\u2212 mice ( Figure 6A ) did not support a direct relationship between these proinflammatory cytokines and MMP3. To investigate a correlation between MMP induction and proinflammatory signals in vivo in the absence of infection and inflammatory cell recruitment, innate responses in the CNS were initiated by injection of WT mice with poly (I:C), as a viral RNA mimic. Although TNF and IL-1\u03b2 mRNA were specifically upregulated by poly (I:C) as early as 2 h post injection, expression was transient and returned to baseline levels by 6 h ( Figure 6B ). By contrast, MMP3 mRNA upregulation did not reach peak levels until 12 h. MMP12 mRNA levels were already induced at 6 h and remained constant until 12 h. These data suggest that neither TNF, IL-1\u03b2 nor innate immune signals are primary factors inducing MMP3 upregulation in vivo. Overall the data support alternative or additional factors distinct from neutrophil-secreted proteases, TNF and IL-1\u03b2, underlying dysregulated MMP3 expression in the absence of MMP9 during viral encephalitis.",

However, rapid mortality following neutrophil/ monocyte ablation during lethal JHMV infection preceded peak lymphocyte accumulation (Zhou et al. 2003) , leaving the role of neutrophils and MMP9 on T cell migration through the BBB inconclusive. Using a sublethal virus variant, the present study shows that neutrophil depletion decreased CNS leukocyte recruitment by ~50%, predominantly at the peak of inflammation. Although macrophage and T cell infiltration were both reduced in neutropenic mice, similar virus clearance and disease severity as in control mice suggested that T cells accessing the CNS parenchyma are sufficient to exert effective anti-viral responses. By contrast, a similar decrease in CNS macrophage and T cell recruitment after blocking ELR + CXC chemokine to limit CXCR2-mediated neutrophil migration resulted in increased mortality and delayed virus clearance (Hosking et al. 2010) . CXCR2 expression on CNS resident cells (Omari et al. 2006; Omari et al. 2005) or a role of CXCR2 in oligodendrocyte protection during JHMV infection (Hosking et al. 2010 ) may explain this discrepancy. Altogether, our data suggest that while neutrophils participate in leukocyte accumulation in the CNS, they are not essential to protect the host from JHMV infection. Monocytes have also been implicated in facilitating T cell migration through the glia limitans at early time points during JHMV infection (Savarin et al. 2010) . Neutrophils and monocytes are the first cells to access the CNS and are both a reservoir of proteases. We propose cooperation between these two innate cells in breaching the BBB early following infection. By releasing granule-sequestrated proteases, neutrophils may induce initial BBB disruption, which is amplified by monocytes to enhance leukocyte migration through the glia limitans. This scenario is supported by the transient retention of leukocytes, including CD4 + and CD8 + T cells, in the absence of monocytes.",

Similar clinical disease and CNS inflammation were also observed in MMP9 \u2212/\u2212 and WT mice during EAE (Dubois et al. 1999) . The absence of MMP9 may thus be overcome by additional neutrophil derived proteases contributing to degrading BBB components (Hager et al. 2010) . Indeed, neutrophil elastase compensates for MMP9 deficiency in a model of experimental peritonitis (Kolaczkowska et al. 2009 ). However, neutrophil elastase, MMP8 and Cathepsin G were not significantly upregulated in JHMV infected MMP9 \u2212/\u2212 compared to WT mice, suggesting that neutrophil-derived proteases did not compensate for MMP9 deficiency at the BBB. Potential compensation by other MMPs in MMP9 \u2212/\u2212 mice is difficult to test during EAE due to the wide range of MMPs upregulated in this model (Rosenberg 2002) . However, upregulation of the limited array of MMPs characteristic of JHMV infection was conserved in MMP9 \u2212/\u2212 mice. Moreover, enhanced MMP3 expression specifically in astrocytes further demonstrated that the source of MMPs also remained unaltered in MMP9 \u2212/\u2212 mice. As astrocytes endfeet are part of the glia limitans (Bechmann et al. 2007 ), MMP3 release from the parenchymal side may exert similar degrading effects as MMP9 released from the luminal side of the perivascular space. A role for MMP3 in regulating BBB permeability has previously been suggested using a lipopolysaccharideinduced neuroinflammatory model (Gurney et al. 2006 ). However, our data are distinct in suggesting that MMP9 activity at the luminal side of the BBB may be compensated by MMP3 expressed by astrocytes at the abluminal side. Unfortunately, to our knowledge there are no in vivo specific MMP3 inhibitors available to test this notion. It is also noted that the absence of MMP upregulation at the mRNA level does not rule out compensatory mechanisms by other MMPs, as MMP activity may be enhanced by post-translational cleavage. However, as noted above, activity measurements of individual MMPs are difficult due to the limited assays currently available. Nevertheless, our data emphasize an important role of astrocytes in maintaining BBB integrity, especially at the glia limitans.",

Moreover, the specific role of neutrophil-derived MMP9 in BBB breakdown, especially at the glia limitans, remains unclear due to potential alternative/compensatory pathways dependent on MMP3. These data emphasizes the difficulty of targeting MMPs to alter CNS inflammation due to their complex regulation and dual roles (beneficial versus detrimental).",

In addition to MMP9, neutrophil granules contain a variety of proteases involved in endothelial cell interactions, vascular permeability and anti-microbial activity (DiStasi and Ley 2009; Hager et al. 2010). Thus, neutrophil elastase, MMP8 and Cathepsin G, all upregulated during neuroinflammatory diseases (DiStasi and Ley 2009; Hager et al. 2010; Toft-Hansen et al. 2004), were examined as potential alternative mediators of BBB disruption in absence of MMP9. Neutrophil elastase was upregulated at day 3 and 5 p.i. in WT mice, when neutrophils peak in the CNS (",
