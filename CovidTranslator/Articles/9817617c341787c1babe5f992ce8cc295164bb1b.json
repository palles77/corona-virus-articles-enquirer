            "text": "To evaluate sequential nearest-neighbor effects on quantum-chemical calculations of 13 C a chemical shifts, we selected the structure of the nucleic acid binding (NAB) protein from the SARS coronavirus determined by NMR in solution (PDB id 2K87). NAB is a 116-residue a/b protein, which contains 9 prolines and has 50% of its residues located in loops and turns. Overall, the results presented here show that sizeable nearest-neighbor effects are seen only for residues preceding proline, where Pro introduces an overestimation, on average, of 1.73 ppm in the computed 13 C a chemical shifts. A new ensemble of 20 conformers representing the NMR structure of the NAB, which was calculated with an input containing backbone torsion angle constraints derived from the theoretical 13 C a chemical shifts as supplementary data to the NOE distance constraints, exhibits very similar topology and comparable agreement with the NOE constraints as the published NMR structure. However, the two structures differ in the patterns of differences between observed and computed 13 C a chemical shifts, D ca,i , for the individual residues along the sequence. This indicates that the D ca,i -values for the NAB protein are primarily a consequence of the limited sampling by the bundles of 20 conformers used, as in common practice, to represent the two NMR structures, rather than of local flaws in the structures.",

            "text": "Recent progress with the use of automatic and semi-automatic protocols for the structure determination of proteins by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy calls for improved structure validation procedures to assess the quality of the newly produced structures. Such validation procedures should contribute to increasing the quality of the NMR structures without requiring the acquisition of additional NMR data. For this purpose, the validation method should be able to provide a global structure quality score and at the same time be sensitive enough to identify flaws in local polypeptide segments. In this context, a new quantum-chemistry-based method for the evaluation of NMR structures was recently introduced, which can be used for any type of protein with available 13 C a chemical shifts (Vila et al. 2007b ) and may replace statistical or semi-classical descriptions of protein properties. This new strategy provides a unified, self-consistent method to validate and determine high-quality protein structures, which does not rely on knowledge-based information (Vila et al. 2007a (Vila et al. , b, 2008a . It makes use of the ever-increasing computational power available to achieve a detailed analysis of protein structures with physics-based strategies.",

(2) In addition to the impact of the covalent structure, 13 C a chemical shifts are modulated mainly by the intraresidue backbone and side-chain dihedral angles (Spera and Bax 1991; de Dios et al. 1993; Kuszewski et al. 1995; Luginb\u00fchl et al. 1995; Havlin et al. 1997; Pearson et al. 1997; Iwadate et al. 1999; Xu and Case 2001; Sun et al. 2002; Villegas et al. 2007 ). (3) 13 C a is ubiquitous in proteins. (4) 13 C a chemical shifts can be computed with high accuracy at the quantum chemistry level of theory. This methodology has been used recently to validate and determine the structures of several proteins that differ in size and in 3D structure (Vila et al. 2007a (Vila et al. , b, 2008a .",

Because computation of the Boltzmann factors on the quantum mechanical level of theory was not possible with our present computational facilities, we used the approximation that each conformer contributes equally to the average chemical shift obtained by fast conformational averaging, i.e., k k = 1/X. Whether a computation of a Boltzmann average, rather than the arithmetic average, of the 13 C a chemical shifts given by Eq. (1) would lead to a more accurate representation of the 13 C a chemical shifts needs further investigation. This is currently beyond our computational capability, since it would require computation of the total energy at the quantum mechanical level of theory for each of the conformers in the ensemble used to represent the NMR structure.",

From the fits of the 13 C a chemical shifts the two ensembles are also of similar quality. The validation of a given protein structure in terms of both the NOEs and the 13 C a chemical shifts should, according to the present data, be improved if based on the use of larger ensembles of conformers compatible with the available data.",
