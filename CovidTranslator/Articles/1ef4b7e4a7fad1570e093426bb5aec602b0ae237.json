In this paper, we construct a stochastic variant of the SEIR model to make a quasi-worst-case scenario prediction of the COVID-19 outbreak in the US West and East Coasts. The model is then fitted to current data and implemented using Runge-Kutta methods. Our computation results predict that the number of new cases would peak around mid-April 2000 and begin to abate by July, and that the number of cases of COVID-19 might be significantly mitigated by having greater numbers of functional testing kits available for screening. The model also showed how small changes in variables can make large differences in outcomes and highlights the importance of healthcare preparedness during pandemics.",

CoVs have been prevalent worldwide for several decades [8, 26] and cause diseases generally associated with the respiratory, gastrointestinal, hepatic, and nervous systems. To date, there are seven CoVs that are known to infect humans and are associated with respiratory symptoms. Four CoVs (HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43, and HKU1) present relatively mild respiratory tract infections [26] , [6, 15] , the 2012 MERS outbreak [36] , and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic [37] . As CoVs have a global distribution, exhibit considerable genetic diversity and genomic recombination, and have zoonotic potential while sympatry between humans and wildlife increase [5, 26] , it is very likely that there will be new CoV outbreaks in the future.",

While the first case was reported in December 2019, it has since been thought to emerge as early as November 2019 [25] . Since then, COVID-19 has continued to spread around the world, and at this date, over 150 countries have been affected [3] . Although some countries have managed to contain COVID-19 efficiently, others previously thought to have been well-prepared for outbreaks due to higher living standards and healthcare quality have witnessed an unexpected number of cases [24] . As a result, the scale of COVID-19 within each nation has become relatively uncertain and has only heightened social and economic unrest. COVID-19 was first reported in the US on January 20, 2020 [11] . While little initial action was taken during the initial days, an exponential increase in the number of cases [24] spurred immediate actions in an attempt to contain COVID-19. For instance, social distancing is being enforced via the closure of educational institutions, restrictions on travel, and suspension of events, and research funding for SARS-CoV-2 has increased. Unfortunately, containment of COVID-19 has been hindered by various factors, such as the initial production of defective test kits [27] , a current limited availability of test kits [28, 29] , and lack of medical supplies [30, 31] . It is currently unclear how well the US healthcare system will cope with the COVID-19 pandemic over the next few months, especially in view of the lack of adequate projections of the scale of COVID-19",

The basic reproduction number 0 , which represents the average number of new infections an infectious person can cause in a na\u00efve population, generally range from 2.3 to 2.9 [22, 33, 38] . The incubation period (the time between initial exposure and development of symptoms) is approximately 5.2 days on average [16, 19] , and the infectious period (the time from onset of symptoms to isolation) is approximately 3 days on average [20, 21] .

For instance, if 50% more people had been tested ( = 0.15) since the start of the outbreak, the model would predict 40% of the projected severity However, the sudden onset of COVID-19 and the overall unpreparedness of the United States make these data inaccessible. It should also be noted that while the global mortality during COVID-19 is currently 3.8%, it is noticeably different across nations [24] . As a result, we chose a 5% mortality rate ( = 0.05) in our quasi-worst-case scenario prediction of COVID-19 in the US. Other factors at a molecular level can further modulate our variables. For instance, the actual 0 in the US might be different as the transmissibility and infectivity of CoVs have been shown to be modulated by abiotic factors such as temperature and humidity [1] , and the robustness of host immunity further affects the etiology, pathogenesis, and overall virulence of CoVs [9] .
