The office was ventilated by three different total volume (TV) ventilation strategies, i.e. mixing ventilation (MV), displacement ventilation (DV), and under-floor air distribution (UFAD) system respectively as background ventilation methods. Concentrations of particles with aerodynamic diameters of 0.8 mm, 5 mm, and 16 mm as well as tracer gas were numerically studied in the Eulerian frame. Two indexes, i.e. intake fraction (IF) and concentration uniformity index R C were introduced to evaluate the performance of ventilation systems. It was found that without PV, DV performed best concern protecting the exposed manikin from the pollutants exhaled by the polluting manikin. In MV when the exposed manikin opened RMP the inhaled air quality could always be improved. In DV and UFAD application of RMP might sometimes, depending on the personalized airflow rate, increase the exposure of the others to the exhaled droplets of tracer gas, 0.8 mm particles, and 5 mm particles from the infected occupants. Application of PV could reduce R C for all the three TV systems of 0.8 mm and 5 mm particles. PV enhanced mixing degree of particles under DV and UFAD based conditions much stronger than under MV based ones. PV could increase the average concentration in the occupied zone of the exposed manikin as well as provide clean personalized airflow. Whether inhaled air quality could be improved depended on the balance of pros and cons of PV.",

More and more evidences have identified the transmission route of infectious diseases through respiratory droplets in enclosed environments [1e3]. Li et al.

They believed that there is a strong and sufficient evidence of the association between spread of infectious agent (including measles, tuberculosis, chickenpox, influenza, smallpox, and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)) and ventilation and airflow pattern indoors. With the successive outbreaks of SARS, avian influenza and recently A/ H1N1 influenza, understanding of infectious aerosol transmission behaviors between occupants in typical ventilation rooms becomes not only important but also emergent.",

Mui et al. [10] investigated transmission of exhaled droplet nuclei between a polluting manikin and a receiver under MV and DV in an empty room. These investigations mainly focus on the dispersion characteristics of exhaled droplets under different total volume (TV) ventilation systems.

If the clean core region of PV airflow could effectively reach the breathing zone of occupants, the inhaled pollutant concentration would decrease significantly [11] . Pantelic et al. [12] found the protective role of PV for an exposed manikin against droplets released from a 'coughing machine' in three distances experimentally. They found that PV combined with TV could both reduce the peak aerosol concentration levels in the breathing zone and shorten the exposure time compared with TV alone. However, when the occupant using PV is infected, the PV airflow would help promote infectious exhaled droplets mixing with TV airflows and would enhance their spread indoors. These could cause a higher infection probability of other people in the same room. Cermak and Melikov [13e15] studied the transmission of infectious agents between two occupants under different total volume ventilation strategies combined with two types of PV using tracer gas method in a full-scale test room. However, the diameters of exhaled droplets may span a wide range from O(1 mm) to O (1000 mm) [16] . In a recent experimental study carried out by Morawska et al. [17] , the exhaled droplets for all respiratory activities were most in the mode with diameters below 0.8 mm.",

Table 1 shows the detail of the geometry and center coordinates of the numerical thermal manikins used in this study. Constant heat-flux boundary conditions were set for the skins of the manikins. The front one was a polluting source (denoted as P) which exhaled infected airflow at 6 l/min and 35 C [14] through the mouth (20 \u00c2 10 mm) [27] at 45 downward [22] . The back one was an exposed person (denoted as E) which inhaled airflow at 6 l/min through the mouth (20 \u00c2 10 mm) at 45 upward. Although the breathing rate is various in different studies [20] , the experimental results of Rim and Novoselac [28] indicated that breathing of a sedentary manikin has little influence on the airflow field in the breathing zone and it has very small impact on the occupant's thermal plume. The experimental results of Pantelic [12] also demonstrated that droplets concentrations measured in the breathing zone of a thermal manikin were similar with and without a normal breathing process. Therefore, the fixed breathing rate set in the current simulation instead of transient breathing curve is rational in regard to the evaluation of inhaled concentration of the exposed manikin and spatial distributions of pollutants.",

There was a peak concentration value for all particles and tracer gas at the height of 1.1e1.4 m above the floor because this is the height of exhalation of the polluting manikin.",

Generally, IF of UFAD alone for 0.8 mm particles and 5 mm particles were slightly higher than that of DV. This is because UFAD is a partial stratified ventilation system. High momentums from swirling diffusers of UFAD enhance mixing of pollutants in the lower region of the room which results in relatively higher concentrations in the occupied zone of the exposed manikin (also shown in Fig. 10 ). It could be envisaged that weak mixing and strong stratification in the occupied zone is able to restrict lateral dispersion of particles and consequently protect the occupants.

UFAD held the highest IF for 16 mm particles because the upward swirling airflows hinder local deposition and promote mixing of heavy 16 mm particles greatly in the lower region near the exposed manikin.

It could be seen that the velocity magnitude at the mouth of the exposed manikin at the PV flow rate of 15 l/s was around 0.55 m/s to 0.40 m/s. This agreed well with the result of about 0.48 m/s by Cermak and Melikov [13] . The velocity magnitude at the PV flow rate of 7 l/s was around 0.21 m/s to 0.09 m/s.

For tracer gas, 0.8 mm, and 5 mm particles, when both the exposed and the polluting manikin used RMP at 7 l/s, IF of the exposed manikin was much higher than that of DV alone. When PV airflow rate was 15 l/s each, IF of the exposed manikin was a little smaller than using DV alone. This is because personalized air promotes dispersion of the exhaled particles as well as protects the exposed manikin by direct supply of fresh air in the breathing zone. Whether IF of the exposed manikin would decrease or increase depends on the balance of these two factors, one of which is positive and the other is negative. Fig. 9 illustrates normalized concentration contours of 0.8 mm particles in the center plane of x-direction under DV based conditions. It was observed that in stratified DV based conditions using RMP for the polluting manikin could increase particle concentrations around the exposed one greatly. The jet of PV airflow at 7 l/s decayed remarkably before it reached the breathing zone of the exposed manikin. Generally the effect of providing a small flow rate of clean personalized air cannot counteract the increment of concentration in the occupied zone. At the flow rate of 15 l/s, the effect of local fresh air supply almost matched the concentration augment caused by the personalized air of the polluting manikin. Therefore, the IF values in case DV50 \u00fe P15 \u00fe E15 and DV alone in Fig. 7 (b) are comparable. The worst situation appeared if RMP for the polluting manikin opened and for the exposed manikin closed.

For 5 mm particles, R C s of DV and UFAD were also similar but only about 1.2 times higher than R C of MV.

For 0.8 mm particles, R C in the case DV66 \u00fe P7 \u00fe E7 and UFAD66 \u00fe P7 \u00fe E7 was only about 20% of that in DV80 \u00fe P0 \u00fe E0 and UFAD80 \u00fe P0 \u00fe E0, respectively. R C of MV66 \u00fe P7 \u00fe E7 was about 57% of that in MV80 \u00fe P0 \u00fe E0. The trend of R C reduction for 5 mm particles was similar in the corresponding conditions, although it was less pronounced. Table 3 also shows that using PV led to much higher reductions of R C for DV and UFAD than for MV. This is reasonable, because DV and UFAD are . 10 . Average normalized concentrations in the exposed occupied zone. The concentration of the exhaled air from the polluting manikin is denoted as 1.0. stratified ventilation systems whereas MV is a well-mixed system. Therefore, additional mixing caused by PV would promote the concentration uniformity much more strongly for DV and UFAD than for MV, compared to the cases without PV. R C changed by a small value in all the cases when the total PV flow rates increased from 14 l/s to 30 l/s. For 16 mm particles, the influence of additional mixing through using personalized air was not obvious for all the cases. R C is an overall index to estimate the level of pollutant mixing in the whole office. In present study, using PV can reduce R C which could increase pollutant concentration in the office room. However, generally speaking, since in essence R C is a normalized value and has the characteristics of a standard deviation, there is no certain relationship between R C and the concentration level. Fig. 10 illustrates average normalized concentrations in the occupied zone of the exposed occupant (see Fig. 3 ). Total amount of inhaled pollutants of the exposed manikin can be expressed as follows: (10) in which C E is area-weighted average concentration of pollutant at the mouth of the exposed manikin, C A is volume averaged concentration in the exposed occupied zone, C PV is pollutant concentration in the PV airflow which is zero in the current study. f is the mass fraction of personalized air in the total inhaled air. Fig. 10 shows that using RMP for both manikins always increased C A except for 16 mm particles. Whether C E could be decreased or increased depends on the balance of pros and cons of using PV. For example, for 0.8e5 mm particles, in the case MV66 \u00fe P7 \u00fe E7 and MV50 \u00fe P15 \u00fe E15, C A was just slightly higher than in MV80 \u00fe P0 \u00fe E0 due to the well-mixed characteristic of MV. The positive effect of f could always overcome the negative influence of increased C A .",
