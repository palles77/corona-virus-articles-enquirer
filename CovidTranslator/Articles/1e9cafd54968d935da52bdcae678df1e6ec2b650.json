Validated serologic assays are important for contact tracing, identifying the viral reservoir and epidemiological studies. Here, we developed serological assays for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing, spike-and nucleocapsid-specific antibodies. Using serum samples from patients with PCR-confirmed infections of SARS-CoV-2, other coronaviruses, or other respiratory pathogenic infections, we validated and tested various antigens in different in-house and commercial ELISAs. We demonstrate that most PCRconfirmed SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals seroconverted, as revealed by sensitive and specific in-house ELISAs. We found that commercial S1 IgG or IgA ELISAs were of lower specificity while sensitivity varied between the two, with IgA showing higher sensitivity. Overall, the validated assays described here can be instrumental for the detection of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies for diagnostic, seroepidemiological and vaccine evaluation studies.

The virus was identified to be a betacoronavirus related to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and thus, was named SARS-CoV-2 (2) . In less than two decades, this virus is the third known coronavirus to cross the species barrier and cause severe respiratory infections in humans following SARS-CoV in 2003 and Middle East respiratory syndrome in 2012, yet with unprecedented spread compared to the earlier two. Due to the rapid rise in number of cases and uncontrolled and vast worldwide spread, the WHO has declared SARS-CoV-2 a pandemic. As of March 14th 2020, the virus has infected over 130,000 individuals in 122 countries, 3.7% of which had a fatal outcome (3) . The rapid identification of the etiology and the sharing of the genetic sequence of the virus, followed by international collaborative efforts initiated due to the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 have led to the rapid availability of real-time PCR diagnostic assays that support the case ascertainment and tracking of the outbreak (4) . The availability of these has helped in patient detection and efforts to contain the virus. However, specific and validated serologic assays are still lacking at the moment and are urgently needed to understand the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2.",

Epidemiological studies are urgently needed to help uncover the burden of disease, in particular, the rate of asymptomatic infections, and to get better estimates on morbidity and mortality. Additionally, these epidemiological studies can help reveal the extent of virus spread in households, communities and specific settings; which could help guide control measures Serological assays are also needed for evaluation of the results of vaccine trials and development of therapeutic antibodies. Among the four coronavirus structural proteins, the spike (S) and the nucleocapsid (N) are the main immunogens (5) . Here, we describe development of serological assays for the detection of virus neutralizing antibodies and antibodies to the nucleocapsid (N) protein and various spike (S) domains including the S1 subunit, and receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 in ELISA format. Using a wellcharacterized cohort of serum samples from PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 and patients PCR-confirmed to be infected with seasonal coronaviruses and other respiratory pathogens, we validated and tested various antigens in different platforms developed in-house as well as a commercial platform.",

Since the N protein of SARS-CoV-2 is 90% similar to that of SARS-CoV ( Table 2) , we used SARS-CoV N as an antigen to test for SARS-CoV-2 N-directed antibodies in an ELISA format. We found that, following infection, antibodies were elicited against the N protein and when tested in a PRNT assay these sera were able to neutralize SARS-CoV-2. We observed cross-reactivity with the SARS-CoV S and S1 proteins, and to a lower extent with MERS-CoV S protein, but not with the MERS-CoV S1 protein (Figure 1 G-H) . This was evident from analyzing the degree of similarity of the different CoV S protein domains to their corresponding SARS-CoV-2 proteins ( Table 2) , where SARS-CoV showed high similarities in all different S domains. The analysis showed that the spike S2 subunit is more conserved among CoVs and thus plays a role in the cross-reactivity seen when the whole S was used as an antigen. Thus, S1 is a more specific than S as an antigen for SARS-CoV-2 serological diagnosis. All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.",

            "text": "Validated SARS-CoV-2 serological assays are currently lacking, yet urgently needed for contact tracing, epidemiological and vaccine evaluation studies. Since the N and the S proteins are the main immunogenic CoV proteins, we developed ELISA-based assays, which were able to detect antibodies to these two proteins along with the two spike domains, S1 A and RBD. Those correlated strongly with virus neutralizing antibodies detected by a PRNT50 assay. Since the majority of the human population has antibodies against the four endemic human coronaviruses, it was crucial to verify the specificity of these assays to avoid false positive results. Additionally, the two zoonotic coronaviruses, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, are also beta-coronaviruses, raising potential for cross-reactivity. Among the spike protein antigens tested, the S1 was more specific than S in detecting SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, as MERS-CoV-S cross-reactive antibodies were detected in the serum of one of the COVID-19 patients which was not seen when MERS-CoV S1 was used for testing. This could be explained by the high degree of conservation in the CoV S2 subunit relative to the S1 ( Table 2) . Therefore, consistent with our earlier findings for MERS-CoV serology (6), S1 is a specific antigen for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics. All rights reserved.

This -not-unexpected -cross-reactivity resulted from the high degree of similarity between the S1 and RBD of the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 ( Table 2) . However, SARS-CoV has not circulated in the human population since 2003, i.e. 17 years ago, and an earlier study reported waning of SARS-CoV-specific antibodies which made them undetectable in serum samples of 91% (21/23) of samples tested 6 years following infection (11) . It is therefore unlikely that antibodies to this virus are present in the population and thus there could hardly be a chance that false positives result from SARS-CoV-antibodies reactivity. Meanwhile, we made use of the high degree of similarity between the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 proteins for the development of our inhouse N ELISA, where we used SARS-CoV N (90% similar to SARS-CoV-2) as an antigen. The N-ELISA could detect SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies with high specificity and sensitivity. Using the three different validated ELISAs, we found that antibody levels were higher following the severe infection compared to the mild ones; similar findings has been reported earlier for MERS-CoV (12, 13) . However, this needs to be confirmed with a larger cohort of patients with varying degrees of severity, while it still highlights the potential need of a sensitive assay to avoid missing those with milder infections in epidemiological studies. Among the 3 inhouse ELISAs tested, the RBD and N ELISAs were more sensitive than S1 ELISA in detecting antibodies in mildly infected patients and showed stronger correlation with PRNT50 titers. Therefore, detecting antibodies against two different antigens might be needed to confirm the findings and avoid false negatives in surveillance studies. However, the sensitivities of the assays need to be further validated with a larger cohort.",

While the IgA-based ELISA showed higher sensitivity than the IgG-based ELISA, the opposite was true for the specificity where the IgG ELISA was more specific than the IgA ELISA. Yet, we noted some cross reactivity in both ELISAs with serum samples from the same two HCoV-OC43 patients that cross reacted in a MERS-CoV S1 IgG ELISA (6) despite the different antigen coated. This indicates a response to another protein which could be in the blocking or coating matrix, apart from the specific antigen coated, resulting in this consistent false positive result.

However, since various studies will be carried out in different labs, it is crucial to calibrate and standardize assays developed by different labs using well defined standard references as a part of diagnostic assay validation. This is not only needed to reduce interassay variability, but to also harmonize the results obtained from different labs using various assays (14) . This is crucial for better comparison and interpertaion of results from different studies as well as evaluation of vaccine trials, allowing for uniform assessment of immunogenicity, efficacy and better understanding of correlates of immune protection (15) .
