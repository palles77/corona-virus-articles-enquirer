Social contagions may cause irrational \"fever\". Isaac Newton, having lost \u00a320,000 in the speculative South Sea Bubble, commented that he could \"calculate the movement of the stars, but not the madness of men\" (3). Systems where both types of contagion are coupled to one anotheran infectious disease spreading by biological contagion and a social contagion concerning the disease-offer unique scientific challenges and are increasingly important for public health (4-15).",

This dynamic may have occurred during whole cell pertussis vaccine scare in the United Kingdom during the 1970s and the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine autism scare more recently (4) .

However, if social contagions have clear similarities to well-understood biological contagions that can be captured in models, and if the focus is on predicting aggregate population behavior rather than individual actions, predictive models may be feasible.

For example, some models predicted that cervical cancer vaccine uptake would be below recommended levels in the United States, which is what ended up occurring (12, 15) . Other models have retrospectively predicted vaccine coverage and endemic disease dynamics for historical pediatric vaccine scares (4) . Empirical validation of models could be facilitated by more long-term data on the determinants of control measure uptake in the specific context of disease-behavior systems. Also, the field must develop a common lexicon. For example, social contagion is often referred to differently even when the underlying mathematical formulation is identical. This can create confusion. We have much to learn from those who \"calculate the movement of stars\"-astronomers routinely agree to standardize their nomenclature through committees.",

Thus, population behavior may replace accessibility as the most challenging barrier to higher uptake of control measures. On the other hand, for many novel zoonoses like SARS-CoV, there are initially no pharmaceutical interventions. Hence, public health must rely on quarantine, movement restrictions, and other measures that require cooperative behavior. Also, where there is lack of epidemiological knowledge in the early stages of a new zoonosis, fear and supposition can easily rush in to fill the void. In all cases, an improved understanding of the interplay between social contagions and biological contagions will help to improve disease control efforts. When a social contagion on a social network (A) and a biological contagion on an infection contact network (B) are coupled to one another (C), the resulting interplay can create complex dynamics that are not present in either network layer in isolation, such as the fall and rise of vaccine coverage during a vaccine scare (4) . Each person 1, 2, 3, 4\u2026 is a node in both the social contagion network and the biological contagion network.",
