            "text": "The small envelope (E) protein of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is a hydrophobic 73 amino acid protein encoded in the internal open reading frame (ORF) of the bicistronic mRNA2. As a first step towards understanding the biological role of E protein during PRRSV replication, E gene expression was blocked in a full-length infectious clone by mutating the ATG translational initiation to GTG, such that the full-length mutant genomic clone was unable to synthesize the E protein. DNA transfection of PRRSV-susceptible cells with the E gene knocked-out genomic clone showed the absence of virus infectivity. P129-\u0394E-transfected cells however produced virion particles in the culture supernatant, and these particles contained viral genomic RNA, demonstrating that the E protein is essential for PRRSV infection but dispensable for virion assembly. Electron microscopy suggests that the P129-\u0394E virions assembled in the absence of E had a similar appearance to the wild-type particles. Strand-specific RT-PCR demonstrated that the E protein-negative, non-infectious P129-\u0394E virus particles were able to enter cells but further steps of replication were interrupted. The entry of PRRSV has been suggested to be via receptor-mediated endocytosis, and lysomotropic basic compounds and known ion-channel blocking agents both inhibited PRRSV replication effectively during the uncoating process. The expression of E protein in Escherichia coli-mediated cell growth arrests and increased the membrane permeability. Cross-linking experiments in cells infected with PRRSV or transfected with E gene showed that the E protein was able to form homo-oligomers. Taken together, our data suggest that the PRRSV E protein is likely an ion-channel protein embedded in the viral envelope and facilitates uncoating of virus and release of the genome in the cytoplasm.",

PRRSV is a member of the family Arteriviridae, which includes equine arteritis virus (EAV), lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus (LDV) of mice and simian hemorrhagic fever virus (SHFV) (Meulenberg et al., 1993; Snijder and Meulenberg, 1998) . Along with the family Coronaviridae, arteriviruses are grouped in the new order of Nidovirales (Snijder et al., 2005) . Despite the similar virion morphology and genome organization, PRRSV is divided into two genotypes, the European genotype (Lelystad virus; LV) and the North American genotype, based on their antigenic and genetic characteristics (Meng et al., 1995; Nelsen et al., 1999; Nelson et al., 1993; Wootton et al., 2000) .",

The PRRSV genome consists of the 5\u2032 untranslated region (UTR) , nine open reading frames (ORF1a, ORF1b, ORF2a, ORF2b and ORFs 3 through 7) and the 3\u2032 UTR (Meulenberg et al., 1993; Snijder and Meulenberg, 1998; Wootton et al., 2000) . Two large ORFs la and lb occupy the 5\u2032 two-thirds of the genome and encode 13 non-structural proteins, which are suggested to be involved in the genome replication and transcription (Bautista et Virology 355 (2006) 30 -43 www.elsevier.com/locate/yviro al., 2002; van Dinten et al., 1999) . The remaining ORFs, 2a through 7 in the 3\u2032 terminal 3 kb region, encode six membraneassociated proteins (GP2, E, GP3, GP4, GP5 and M) present in the envelope and nucleocapsid (N) protein (Meulenberg et al., 1995; Wootton et al., 2000) . Mature virions are spherical, enveloped particles with a diameter of 50-65 nm and contain a 20-to 30-nm isometric core structure enclosing the genomic RNA (Benfield et al., 1992; Dea et al., 1995) . The small envelope (E) protein is a newly identified structural component in arteriviruses. The PRRSV E protein, also known as 2b protein, is translated from the internal ORF (ORF2b) starting from the + 6 nucleotide position in mRNA2 (Fig. 1A) . The E protein is 73 and 70 amino acids for the North American and European type of PRRSV, respectively. The E protein is highly hydrophobic but contains a cluster of basic amino acids in the hydrophilic C-terminal region. The E protein is non-glycosylated and intracellular membrane-associated Wu et al., 2001) . In PRRSV-infected pigs, the E protein induces specific antibody (Wu et al., 2001) . Recent studies with a European PRRSV isolate showed that the E protein is incorporated into the virions in association with GP2-GP3-GP4 heterotrimers, suggesting a critical role for the heteromultimeric complex in the virus entry process (Wissink et al., 2005) . Although the E protein of North American genotype PRRSV contains two cysteine residues at positions 49 and 54, a study has shown that E is unable to form disulfide-linked homodimers . In that study, cysteine residues of the E protein were shown to be non-essential for virus multiplication. The function and significance of E in PRRSV replication remain to be determined.",

The dual staining demonstrated the expression of nsp2/3 and N proteins in transfected cells, indicating the synthesis of both non-structural and structural proteins, which in turn suggests that the PRRSV genome replicated and mRNA transcription occurred upon transfection of P129-\u0394E DNA. The results demonstrate that E protein expression is required for PRRSV infectivity, but genome replication and transcription may occur without E protein.

BHK-T7 cells were also suitable for transfection of the full-length cDNA clone as N-specific staining was detected in many cells (Figs. 2B and E) . To determine whether P129-\u0394E in the E gene-transfected cells leads to the production of infectious virus particles, BHK-T7 cells were co-transfected with P129-\u0394E and E gene. The culture supernatant was harvested at 48 h post-transfection from BHK-T7 cells and transferred to Marc-145 cells.

Attempts to pass the passage-1 culture supernatant to Marc-145 resulted in no virus replication, confirming that the P129-\u0394E virus particles generated by the provision of E in trans was only capable of a single round of replication.

Due to a low transfection efficiency in Marc-145 cells, BHK-21 cells were used to achieve higher transfection efficiency. When stained with N-specific MAb at 2 days post-transfection, numerous cells showed N-specific fluorescence (data not shown), indicating high levels of transfection in BHK-21 cells, which may be sufficient for the study of particle formation. BHK-21 cells were transfected with P129-WT or P129-\u0394E, and at 30 h post-transfection, the transfected cells were radiolabeled for 1 day with [ 35 S]methionine/cysteine. The cells were harvested and lysed with RIPA buffer. The culture supernatants were collected separately and centrifuged through a 20% (wt/vol) sucrose cushion, and the resulting pellets were dissolved in RIPA buffer. The lysates prepared from cells or supernatants were immunoprecipitated with a mixture of individual antibody specific for E, N, or M and resolved by SDS-PAGE. As shown in Fig. 3A , intracellular major viral-specific proteins were detectable in all lysates (lower panel), confirming the ability of P129-\u0394E for transcription. Similarly, in the culture supernatants, the three major virion proteins GP5, M and N were clearly identified (upper panel), showing that, without E protein, virus particles can be produced and released. It was not possible to detect the E protein in the cell lysates or supernatants from P129-WT-transfected cells, and this is probably due to the low abundance of E protein in BHK-21 cells as E is a minor protein (Wu et al., 2005) .

The culture supernatants, prepared from BHK-21 cells transfected with P129-WT or P129-\u0394E, were first incubated with both RNase A and DNase I to remove any possible contamination of viral RNA and the transfected DNA from cells. The digestion was carried out in the presence or absence of detergents, followed by proteinase K treatment to inactivate the nucleases. RNA was extracted from samples and treated again with DNase I, and the E gene region of PRRSV was RT-PCR-amplified and sequenced. In cell culture media mixed with the full-length cDNA clone as a negative control, no PCR fragment was amplified in the presence or absence of detergents (Fig. 3B , lanes 2 and 3), indicating the appropriateness of DNase I treatment. Although no amplification was identified for controls ( Fig. 3B , lanes 5 and 7), a 260-bp product was specifically amplified for both samples of P129-WT and P129-\u0394E treated with the nucleases but in the absence of detergents (Fig. 3B , lanes 4 and 6). Sequencing of the 260-bp product confirmed the stable incorporation of the 'A12062G' mutation at the start codon of the E gene in the genome from P129-\u0394E particles.

RT-PCR from P129-WT-inoculated cells yielded a specific product of the expected size for both positive-and negativestrand genomes and also for positive-and negative-strand mRNA7 (Fig. 4C , lanes 3 in all panels). In contrast, only a minimal amount was amplified for the positive-strand genome from cells inoculated with passage-1 P129-\u0394E virus (Fig. 4C , panel i, lane 4). This product was likely derived from the incoming genomic RNA of P129-\u0394E virus. These results indicate that P129-\u0394E virus was unable to replicate, suggesting that the lack of RNA replication of P129-\u0394E virus was likely due to an interruption during virus uncoating, a stage prior to genome replication.",

            "text": "The E-protein-negative PRRSV particles were shown to contain the viral genome and able to enter cells but unable to release the viral RNA for initiation of genome replication. This suggests that PRRS virions may contain ion channels and the E protein may function as an ion channel protein embedded in the viral envelope. It is postulated that PRRSV replication may be suppressed by ion channel blocking agents if ion channel activity is an essential requirement for PRRSV infection. This aspect was investigated in Marc-145 cells using amantadine and verapamil. Amantadine is known as a proton channel blocker and verapamil is the calcium channel blocking agent. Because it has been reported that an acidic environment is required for PRRSV infection (Kreutz and Ackermann, 1996) , basic lysosomotropic agents including ammonium chloride and chloroquine were also included in the study to examine their inhibitory effects on PRRSV replication. Strand-specific RT-PCR experiments were carried out and demonstrated that PRRSV-infected Marc-145 cells produced reduced levels of positive-sense genomic RNA at 2 days post-infection in the presence of the drugs chloroquine, amantadine and verapamil (Fig. 5A, upper panel) . A relatively moderate level of suppression was observed in ammonium chloride-treated cells (lane 4). Negative-sense genomic RNA was not detectable in cells treated with any of the four drugs until 2 days post-infection (middle and lower panels, lanes 4-7), showing that the initiation of viral RNA synthesis was inhibited by the ion channel blockers. Furthermore, the number of PRRSV-infected cells determined by the N protein staining was significantly reduced by individual drugs in comparison to untreated cells (Fig. 5B , upper panels). PRRSV-specific CPE was visible but significantly delayed by the ion channel blockers, indicating the negative effects on virus production (lower panels). The yields of virus production were determined by plaque assays from the supernatants in the presence of each drug. The virus titer in untreated cells reached 3 \u00d7 10 6 PFU/ml by 3 days post-infection (Fig. 5C ). In contrast, Fig. 4 . The E protein is essential for PRRSV replication. (A) Immunofluorescence of N protein in P129-\u0394E inoculated cells. The 'passage-1' virus was prepared as culture supernatant harvested from BHK-21 cells transfected with P129-WT or P129-\u0394E clone. Marc-145 cells were inoculated with 'passage-1' and fixed at the indicated times post-inoculation, followed by staining with N-specific MAb. (B) Detection of viral RNA in culture supernatants and in Marc-145 cells inoculated with 'passage-1' or 'passage-2' virus. Total RNA was extracted and treated with DNase I followed by RT-PCR for E gene. (C) Strand-specific detection of viral RNA in cells by RT-PCR. Marc-145 cells were inoculated with 'passage-1' P129-WT or 'passage-1' P129-\u0394E, and total cellular RNA was extracted at 2 days post-inoculation. The RNA was treated by DNase I and RT-PCR was conducted to amplify the region as illustrated in the figure. Numbers in parenthesis indicate the 5\u2032 most nucleotide position in each primer with respect to the PRRSV genome. Expected sizes of amplified products are indicated on the right of the gel. there was no detectable virus production at 1 day post-infection in the presence of amantadine or verapamil, and the titers of virus production in the presence of these drugs reached only to a maximum of 5 to 8 \u00d7 10 1 PFU/ml by 3 days post-infection (Fig.  5C) . These results showed that the treatment of infected cells with ion channel blockers greatly reduced the growth rate of PRRSV. However, when Marc-145 cells were treated with the drugs at 30 min post-infection, no significant inhibitory effect of virus production was observed (data not shown). Therefore, it seems that the ion channel blockers effectively interfered with virus uncoating, a step preceding genome replication and consequently affected PRRSV production. It is interesting to note that the inhibitory effect by amantadine are due to the blocking of pores that are necessary for post-internalization during uncoating of the virus (Wang et al., 1993) .",

We examined whether the E protein possessed general features commonly shared by other viroporins (ion channel proteins). Viroporins generally contain the properties of membrane permeability alteration and oligomerization (Liao et al., 2004; Maldarelli et al., 1993; Paterson et al., 2003; Sakaguchi et al., 1997; Torres et al., 2005) , and so these two common properties were examined for the E protein. The effect of E expression on bacterial growth was first examined in an inducible protein expression system. When the inner bacterial membrane is intact, intracellular lysozymes cannot reach the cell wall. However, permeabilized membranes allow the lysozymes to gain access to the peptidoglycan, leading to cell lysis. This approach has been shown to be suitable as a permeabilization test of the inner bacterial membrane for viral proteins (Bodel\u00f3n et al., 2002; Ciccaglione et al., 1998; Liao et al., 2004; Madan et al., 2005) . The PRRSV E protein gene was first cloned in the GST-fusion vector and expressed in Escherichia coli. The growth rates of transformed cells were analyzed spectrophotometrically. A drastic arrest of cell growth was observed in the E gene-transformed cells upon IPTG induction, whereas bacteria carrying the empty plasmid or the PRRSV N gene had no effects on their growth during the 300-min period following induction (Fig. 6A ). This finding suggests that the expression of E affected the cell growth negatively by altering the membrane permeability to intracellular lysozyme.",

Hygromycin B is normally impermeable to the membrane barrier during a short period of time at low concentration, but it can readily penetrate the permeabilized membrane to cause strong inhibition of intracellular protein synthesis. The hygromycin B permeability assay therefore is widely used to study changes of membrane permeability as well as to identify proteins that can form pores in lipid membranes (Aldabe et al., 1996; Arroyo et al., 1995; Bodel\u00f3n et al., 2002; Chang et al., 1999; Ciccaglione et al., 1998; de Jong et al., 2003; Doedens and Kirkegaard, 1995; Han and Harty, 2004; Liao et al., 2004; Madan et al., 2005) . At 1 h induction for E protein expression, hygromycin B was added to the culture media. The cultures were further incubated for 15 min and metabolically labeled with [ 35 S]methionine/cysteine for 15 min, followed by SDS-PAGE of cell lysates. The Coomassie blue staining showed that equal amounts of proteins were loaded on the gel (Fig. 6B, left panel) . Autoradiography indicated that hygromycin B entered cells that expressed the E protein, and protein synthesis was completely blocked in those cells (Fig. 6B, right panel, compare lanes 5 and 6, lanes 7 and 8) . For cells expressing the GST or PRRSV N protein, hygromycin B did not inhibit protein synthesis (compare lanes 1 and 2, lanes  3 and 4) . These results indicate that the PRRSV E protein enhanced membrane permeability in bacterial cells.",

Although PRRSV N-N dimers of 30 kDa were readily detected in cells expressing the N protein (lane 1), no band corresponding to the predicted dimeric form of E was identified in non-reducing conditions (lane 3), concluding that the PRRSV E protein does not undergo cysteine-linked homodimerization.",

Radiolabeled PRRSVinfected cells were treated with the membrane-permeable cross-linking reagent DSP, and the cell lysates were immunoprecipitated by N-specific MAb or E-specific antiserum followed by SDS-PAGE under non-reducing conditions (Fig.  7B) . The PRRSV N protein formed a number of higher-order oligomers (lanes 1, 2) , as reported previously (Wootton and Yoo, 2003) . When the E protein in virus-infected cells was subjected to cross-linking, numerous multimeric forms of E protein were identified (lane 3). The E protein multimerization also was examined in the absence of other PRRSV proteins in HeLa cells expressing E protein by T7 vaccinia virus, and again higher-order multimeric forms of the E protein were observed (lane 4), indicating that oligomerization of E is independent of other viral proteins. Altogether, our data indicate that the PRRSV E protein exists as non-covalently linked oligomers in virus-infected cells and suggest that the multimerization may be the physical basis for viroporin formation of PRRSV E.",

            "text": "The present study was conducted to investigate the role of PRRSV E protein during virus infection. A reverse genetics approach was used to modify the translation initiation of ORF2b, so that the modified genome was unable to express the E protein. Our experiments show that the absence of E protein expression does not affect genome replication transcription but impairs the production of infectious virus. These data indicate that the PRRSV E protein is an essential structural component for infectivity. The E protein however appears not to be an essential component for particle assembly nor genomic encapsidation. The virion particles devoid of E still contained the viral genome and had a similar appearance to that of wildtype virions. For infection, virus particles must proceed through a multiple-step cycle of entry and uncoating, replication and transcription and assembly and release. According to our findings, the E protein does not exert an important function at later events in the infection process such as genome replication, particle assembly and release of virus. We have observed that the E protein-negative, non-infectious virion particles are able to enter cells but subsequent steps of replication are inhibited. This suggests that the particles lacking the E protein most likely remain in the endosome and the viral genome is not released, which is the step between virus entry and genome replication. The uncoating is a critical step for virus infection, during which the lipid envelope is shed and the viral capsid is disassembled to release the genome to initiate a replication cycle in the cytoplasm. For viruses entering cells by receptor-mediated endocytosis, the uncoating process occurs in the endosome where an acidic environment triggers fusion between the viral membrane and the endosomal membrane (reviewed by Smith and Helenius, 2004) . PRRSV enters cells through receptormediated microfilament-dependent endocytosis in which a low pH is required to trigger fusion for proper uncoating by an unknown mechanism (Kreutz and Ackermann, 1996; Nauwynck et al., 1999) . It is possible that an acidic pH in the endosome may lead to conformational changes of viral protein (s) to expose hidden fusogenic domains that facilitate the fusion between viral and endosomal membranes. However, no direct fusion of PRRSV with the cell membrane, and no arterivirus membrane proteins possessing the fusogenic property have been reported. It is therefore tempting to speculate that PRRSV may contain a viral ion channel protein to promote the uncoating process in the endosome during the early stage of infection. In the present study, we have shown the inhibitory effect of ion channel blockers on PRRSV replication, indicating that PRRSV may indeed possess virus-coded ion channels whose activity is essential for proper uncoating for infection.",

            "text": "The PRRSV E protein structurally resembles a number of viroporins found in other RNA viruses, in that it consists of 70-73 amino acid residues and contains central hydrophobic sequences with a cluster of basic amino acids at the Cterminus. The E protein localizes mainly in perinuclear regions including the ER and the Golgi complex and associates with intracellular membranes (Wu et al., 2001) . Interestingly, coronaviruses, another family member of the order Nidovirales, also code for a small hydrophobic membrane, designated E protein, which may play a crucial role during virus morphogenesis (Fischer et al., 1998; Liu and Inglis, 1991) . In recent studies, the coronavirus E protein has been shown to modify membrane permeability (Liao et al., 2004; Madan et al., 2005) as well as to form cation-selective ion channels in an artificial membrane (Wilson et al., 2004) . Our data in the current study also demonstrate the alteration of membrane permeability by the PRRSV E protein and the inhibition of bacterial growth by the increase of hygromycin B penetration into bacterial cells. However, we were not able to show similar results in mammalian cells by infection or E gene transfection, which may be due to the different intracellular localization of E in mammalian cells. In PRRSV-infected cells, the E protein appears to remain in the ER and Golgi complex, where it likely participates in assembly of infectious progeny virus, rather than traveling to the plasma membrane. Bacterial cells do not possess such intracellular organelles and the expressed E protein may accumulate at the inner bacterial membrane, leading to membrane perturbation, and thus enhancing membrane permeabilization. Failure to observe the direct alteration of membrane permeability by E in mammalian cells implies that the role of E is not linked to membrane disorganization and cell lysis in facilitating virus release. The cross-linking studies show that the E protein can form homo-oligomers, including dimers, trimers and tetramers by non-covalent interactions. All information obtained in the present study support the hypothesis that the PRRSV E protein contains a potential for a pore-forming activity and thus may function as an ion channel for virus uncoating. The functional and structural features of the PRRSV E protein resemble the influenza A virus M2 protein that is best characterized as an ion-channel protein. The M2 protein forms a homo-tetramer in the viral membrane and functions as an ion channel. The M2 channel allows the translocation of protons from the acidic environment of the endosome to the inner space of virions and alters the pH in the virion. As a consequence, the M1 protein in the virion is dissociated from the viral ribonucleoprotein complex, which promotes the ribonucleoprotein complex traveling to the nucleus where the influenza replication takes place (Pinto et al., 1992; Sakaguchi et al., 1997) . It is noteworthy that PRRSV replication could be inhibited by amantadine, an antiviral drug for influenza virus (Kreutz and Ackermann, 1996; Fig. 5) . In summary, we propose a model for PRRSV uncoating based on our findings. In this model, E proteins form pores (ion channels) in the viral envelope. Upon internalization by receptor-mediated endocytosis through small clathrin-like coated vesicles, the virion particles are transported to the endosome. There, the E-protein ion channels in the viral membrane undergo conformational changes upon exposure to low pH in the endosome, and allow ions to enter the virion, which triggers the disassembly of inner capsid and the release of viral genome in the cytoplasm, such that further steps of genome replication and infection cycle can proceed.",
