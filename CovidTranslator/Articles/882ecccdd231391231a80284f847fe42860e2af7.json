Recently, AI Mashat and Taylor (1980b) and Firehammer and Myers (1981) have shown that it can induce fever, diarrhea -sometimes with dysentery-and lesions similar to those described by Jones and Little. In addition, Garcia et al. (1983) suspect that C. jejuni is one of the many etiological agents of winter dysentery. However, C. jejuni was isolated also from the feces of normal calves (Allsup et al., 1972) , and in Great Britain Campylobacter fetus subspecies fetus was identified in cases of winter dysentery <(A1 Mashat and Taylor, 1980a) .",

Afterwards, the following viruses were eliminated: IBRV, BVDV-MDV, BAV-3 and BAV-7, reovirus type 3, PI3 virus, bovine rotavirus, enterovirus, syncytial virus, BPoV and Chlamydia psittaci (Scott et al., 1973; Takahashi et al., 1980; Espinasse et al., 1981 Espinasse et al., ,1982 . In Israel, Komarov et al. (1959) isolated a virus by inoculation of egg embryos and mouse brain. In France, Charton et al. (1963a,b) found that the disease was related to an enterovirus able to induce hemorrhagic diarrhea in two 12-13-month-old heifers following intravenous inoculation. Andersen and Scott (1976) found this virus to be different from the agent involved in New York state.",
