Religious, cultural, and social norms discourage females from having physical contact with strangers including male patients. 8, 9 Moreover, nurses avoid cleaning jobs because they perceive that cleaning tasks lower their social status. 8, 9 Cleaners and ward support staff generally do not clean up after patients or empty bedside waste receptacles unless they receive unofficial fees from family caregivers. 8, 9 These staff members have links with workers' unions and have a strong bargaining position with respect to workload. 9, 10 Consequently, family caregivers stay in patient wards and often perform most patient care activities.",

The more severe the patients' disease, the more hands-on care they received. Family caregivers poured water on the patients' heads, gave them sponge baths, and placed a small cloth on their foreheads 140 times during observations. After those events, the team observed caregivers wiping the patients' bodies, faces, and heads with a small cloth 106 times and with the edge of the caregiver's shari (a long unstitched cloth worn by the female caregivers) 7 times. Family caregivers wiped patients' mouths after vomiting, coughing, sneezing, and after feeding 84 times. The team observed caregivers using a small cloth to wipe patients' mouths 4 times after vomiting and 11 times after coughing, and they used a small cloth 8 times to wipe nasal secretions. They also observed caregivers using the edge of their sharis once after coughing and 4 times to wipe patients' nasal secretions. For 1 patient who was severely ill and frothing at the mouth, family caregivers were observed wiping the patient's respiratory secretions continuously with a small cloth. Family caregivers also used a small cloth or the edge of a shari to wipe their own hands and faces. Family caregivers provided more bedside nursing for children than for adults (48% vs 30%, respectively, of the total care was provided by family caregivers). Family caregivers reported that health care workers informally taught them to do some bedside nursing tasks. One caregiver of a child said, \"I give gas (nebulizer) to my child. I also give oxygen (held the oxygen mask). They (nurses) taught us to do some jobs ourselves.. The doctors taught me to clean the saliva from my child's mouth using one finger wrapped in a piece of cloth so that the child can breathe easily\" (26-year-old female caregiver).",

Family caregivers' full-time involvement in hospital care is largely the outcome of professional staff's reluctance to carry out close contact care and cleaning tasks Raising awareness about contagious disease prevention 2 because of social, cultural, political, and infrastructural factors that prevail in public hospitals. 9,10 Indeed, public hospitals that are overcrowded and lack adequate handwashing infrastructure, sanitary facilities, and infection control programs and depend on family caregivers to provide direct patient care create an environment that increases risk of the transmission of infections from patients to family caregivers. Family caregivers fed the patients food and medicine, shared the same food while feeding them, and cleaned their secretions and excretions without wearing gloves or cleaning their hands with soap afterwards. Through similar patient-caregiver contact, transmission of pathogens such as Nipah virus have repeatedly been reported in hospital settings in Bangladesh. 3, 6 Moreover, wiping patients' respiratory secretions with a cloth or caregivers' sharis and then using that same cloth or shari for their personal use places caregivers at risk for respiratory infections because some respiratory viruses can survive on surfaces for 8 to 12 hours. 5, 9, 13 Hospital-acquired respiratory infections transmitted by respiratory droplets have also been reported from Bangladeshi hospitals. 11 Pulmonary tuberculosis, which is transmitted by airborne transmission, has been reported among community health care workers who had contact with pulmonary tuberculosis patients. 14 Thus, family caregivers may not only be exposed to infectious agents from patients they are caring for through close contact and droplets but may also be exposed to airborne infections from other patients who shared these wards. The day-to-day exposure to a crowded ward containing patients with infectious diseases is highly conducive to transmission of diseases to a large number of family caregivers. 15 Caregivers suggested reasonable ways to prevent infections; however, their understanding of transmission pathways was somewhat inconsistent with the biomedical model of transmission, and their daily practices did not reflect the prevention methods they described. For example, they perceived that washing hands with soap could reduce disease transmission; however, we rarely observed caregivers washing their hands with soap after cleaning patients' anuses, vomit, or mucus. Family caregivers' lack of handwashing with soap after cleaning patients' excretions and secretions increased the possibilities of transferring viruses and bacteria to other objects and surfaces that may have the potential to infect themselves or nearby patients and attendants. 16 The traditional practice of rinsing fingers with just a little water on a dinner plate before putting food on it was unlikely to reduce the risk of nosocomial infection. Indeed, through this practice, both the plate and the food might be contaminated by the viruses and bacteria on the caregivers' hands. 2, 3 We conducted this study in only 3 government public tertiary care hospitals and had limited observation time, but we have no reason to believe that the study team's observations were exceptional. Public tertiary care hospitals play a crucial role in the health care of lower income groups in Bangladesh and are consistently overcrowded; on average, 11 patients are hospitalized for every 10 beds. 11 Because the study sites were large government tertiary care hospitals in Bangladesh, we would expect similar conditions in other public tertiary care hospitals, although not necessarily in private and specialized health facilities. Another limitation is that, because each researcher was responsible for observing multiple patients and caregivers, he/she might have missed activities that occurred simultaneously. Therefore, the observational methods used in this study may underestimate the actual frequency of caregiving activities performed by family caregivers.",

Immediate strategies are needed to reduce family caregivers' exposures to infectious agents. One strategy would be to simply restrict family members' access to the wards. However, this would be difficult because of health care workers' unwillingness or inability to provide patient care and because of the psychologic support needed and expected by patients from family caregivers. 8, 9 A possible short-term strategy would be to engage family caregivers in interventions to prevent hospital-acquired infections. 17 In a community-based intervention in Bangladesh, improved understanding of germ theory contributed to high acceptability of hygiene practices including hand hygiene. 18 Considering family caregivers' perspectives on contagious disease transmission and prevention, a health education intervention that uses culturally appropriate messages based on awareness of infections and the importance of hand hygiene could be developed. Such interventions would need to be simple enough for health care workers to implement them daily in the setting of high turnover rates of patients and family caregivers. Pilot interventions in some public tertiary care hospitals in Bangladesh could explore the feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness of such an approach. However, even when family caregivers are highly motivated, poor hospital infrastructure, including lack of water and handwashing stations, may be barriers to handwashing practices. In settings where handwashing stations with running water and soap are unavailable, use of hand sanitizer could be one alternative for cleaning hands. Hand sanitizer has been found to be effective in killing viruses and bacteria and has the added advantage that it does not require water. 19 However, family caregivers in Bangladesh may be unfamiliar with this cleansing agent and would require training on its use. In a low-income country like Bangladesh where the annual total per capita spending on health is $12 per person per year, 20 an additional training expense and cost of the hand sanitizer (US $2.5 per 200 mL; Square Toiletries Ltd, Dhaka, Bangladesh) could be cost prohibitive.
