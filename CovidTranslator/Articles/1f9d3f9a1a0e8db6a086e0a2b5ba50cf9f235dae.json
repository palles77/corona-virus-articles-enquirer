            "text": "A pattern in which nucleotide transitions are favored several-fold over transversions is common in molecular evolution. When this pattern occurs among amino acid replacements, explanations often invoke an effect of selection, on the grounds that transitions are more conservative in their effects on proteins. However, the underlying hypothesis of conservative transitions has never been tested directly. Here we assess support for this hypothesis using direct evidence: the fitness effects of mutations in actual proteins, measured via individual or paired growth experiments. We assembled data from 8 published studies, ranging in size from 24 to 757 single-nucleotide mutations that change an amino acid. Every study has the statistical power to reveal significant effects of amino acid exchangeability, and most studies have the power to discern a binary conservative-vs-radical distinction. However, only one study suggests that transitions are significantly more conservative than transversions. In the combined set of 1239 replacements, the chance that a transition is more conservative than a transversion is 53 % (95 % confidence interval, 50 % to 56 %), compared to the null expectation of 50 %. We show that this effect is not large compared to that of most biochemical factors, and is not large enough to explain the several-fold bias observed in evolution. In short, available data have the power to verify the \"conservative transitions\" hypothesis if true, but suggest instead that selection on proteins plays at best a minor role in the observed bias.",

            "text": "In many early works, this bias is presented as a ratio of differences, which makes the expected ratio a complex function of the degree of sequence divergence. As the use of rate models became routine in comparative sequence analysis, the phenomenon of transition bias was redefined as a bias in instantaneous rates, relative to a null model of equal rates. Because every nucleotide site (e.g., a G site) may experience 1 type of transition (G A) at rate \u03b1, and 2 types of transversion (G C, G T) at rate \u03b2, the aggregate rate ratio of transitions to transversions has a null expectation of R = \u03b1/(2\u03b2) = 0.5. In some contexts, the ratio is expressed differently as \u03ba = \u03b1/\u03b2 = 1. When considering amino acid changes, it is more relevant to compare the 116 possible transitions and 276 possible transversions that change a codon so as to encode a different amino acid (assuming the canonical genetic code), leading to a null expectation of R = 116 \u03b1 / (276 \u03b2) = 0.42 \u03b1/\u03b2. Thus, the observation of roughly equal 4 indicates a bias of over 2-fold. Kumar (1996) estimates 2-fold to 5-fold rate biases in vertebrate mitochondrial genes (excluding 3 rd positions). Other estimates may be found in work cited by Rosenberg, et al. (2003) , but there is not (to our knowledge) a systematic contemporary review of this issue.",

We find that, for every mutation study, even the smallest, there is a significant correlation with one or more of these predictors; half of the studies show a highly significant correlation (P < 0.001). More importantly, for most studies, measured fitness values correlate significantly with a conservative-vs-radical distinction based on EX or U. Specifically, a replacement designated as \"conservative\" has a 65 % (EX) or 64 % (U) chance of being more fit than a \"radical\" replacement.",

The EX matrix, based on a meta-analysis of early mutation studies (which reported phenotypes other than fitness), was designed specifically to serve as a mutationally unbiased measure of exchangeability in models that separate selection from mutation. In a comparative evaluation, EX was shown to be as powerful, or more powerful, than a representative sample of other predictors (Yampolsky and Stoltzfus 2005) . The \"universal evolutionary index\" or U matrix of Tang, et al (2004) is based on modeling evolution of thousands of genes, using a method designed to separate codon-level mutational effects from protein-level effects.

The measure of effect-size used here is the chance that a mutant designated as \"conservative\" is more fit than a randomly chosen \"radical\" mutant. This statistic is not affected by the relative sizes of the 2 classes; its range is from 0 to 1, with a null expectation of 0.5; higher values indicate that nominally \"conservative\" changes are indeed conservative.

There is another point where AUC = 0.5 (no power) and evolutionary bias = 1 (no effect). We can fill in the relationship further by randomizing U B , as shown in Figure 3 . The results show that, when about 75 % of the values are randomized, U B has an AUC of 0.53, equal to that of the transition:transversion distinction. This corresponds to an evolutionary bias of 1.3. The confidence interval of AUC from 0.50 to 0.56 for the transition:transversion distinction corresponds to the interval of 1.0 to 1.6 in evolutionary bias. That is, the expected evolutionary effect of the transition:transverion bias is a 1.3-fold bias, with a confidence interval from 1.0 (no effect) to 1.6. This makes it unlikely that selection plays the major role in causing the evolutionary transition:transversion bias, which typically is several-fold favoring transitions.",

For many, years the mutationist view has suffered from an association with neutral evolution (e.g., the two remain conflated in Nei 2013). This may explain the ongoing popularity of the conservative transitions hypothesis: a mutation bias is the obvious explanation for transition bias in the evolution of introns and other non-coding sequences, but was not accepted for protein sequences, which are assumed to be \"under selection\" and thus not subject to such biases. Yet it is clear theoretically that mutation-biased adaptation is possible and, more generally, that mutation and selection can both contribute to orientation or direction in evolution (Yampolsky and Stoltzfus 2001; Stoltzfus 2006) .",

However, though the effect of conservativeness is strong, the link reported between transitions and conservativeness is weak. According to Zhang (2000) , the chance that a transition is conservative by Miyata's measure is 35 %, compared to 33 % for transversions, a proportional difference of only 6 % (i.e., 2 / 33 = 0.06).

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/027722 doi: bioRxiv preprint obvious. In ROC analysis of a binary classifier, each instance has a binary state (e.g., disease vs. non-disease), and the classifier makes a ranking of instances and predicts the binary state based on a threshold. The ROC curve plots the true-positive rate against the false-negative rate, and the area under this curve is equivalent to the chance that a randomly chosen positive instance is ranked higher than a randomly chosen negative one (Hanley and McNeil 1982) . If we treat the fitness study as the classifier that supplies a ranking for each mutant, and the conservative-radical distinction as the binary state of a mutant, then the AUC is the chance that a mutant of a nominally conservative type has a higher fitness than a randomly chosen mutant of a nominally radical type. The relationship of AUC to the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test is explained by Manley (1982) . Calculating AUC from the test statistic is an algebraic conversion based on the formula AUC = (pairs -WMW_statistic(x, y)) / pairs, where x and y are vectors representing the two samples, and pairs = length(x) * length(y). This formula applies specifically to wilcox.test in the R \"stats\" package (some other implementations define the test statistic in a different way).",
