            "text": "Surfactant protein D (SP-D) plays important roles in antiviral host defense. Although SP-D shows a preference for glucose/maltose, the protein also recognizes D-mannose and a variety of mannoserich microbial ligands. This latter preference prompted an examination of the mechanisms of mannose recognition, particularly as they relate to high-mannose viral glycans. Trimeric neck +carbohydrate recognition domains from human SP-D (hNCRD) preferred alpha1-2 linked dimannose (DM) over the branched trimannose (TM) core, alpha1-3 or alpha1-6 DM, or D-mannose. Previous studies have shown residues flanking the carbohydrate binding site can fine-tune ligand recognition. A mutant with valine at 343 (R343V) showed enhanced binding to mannan relative to wild-type and R343A. No alteration in affinity was observed for D-mannose or for alpha1-3 or alpha1-6 linked DM; however, substantially increased affinity was observed for alpha1-2DM. Both proteins showed efficient recognition of linear and branched sub-domains of high-mannose glycans on carbohydrate microarrays, and R343V showed increased binding to a subset of the oligosaccharides. Crystallographic analysis of an R343V complex with 1,2-DM showed a novel mode of binding. The disaccharide is bound to calcium by the reducing sugar ring, and a stabilizing H-bond is formed between the 2-OH of the non-reducing sugar ring and Arg349. Although hNCRDs show negligible binding to influenza A virus (IAV), R343V showed markedly enhanced viral neutralizing activity. Hydrophobic substitutions for Arg343 selectively blocked binding of a monoclonal antibody (Hyb 246-05) that inhibits IAV binding activity. Our findings demonstrate an extended ligand binding site for mannosylated ligands and the significant contribution of the 343 side chain to specific recognition of multivalent microbial ligands, including high-mannose viral glycans.",

In the case of IAV, binding was localized to specific high-mannose glycans associated with the hemagglutinin (HA) (14) , while binding to HIV was localized to glycans on gp120 (15) . Subsequent studies have correlated SP-D reactivity with IAV in vitro, clearance in vivo, and delayed clearance in SP-D deficient mice with the presence or absence of specific glycans associated with the head of the HA (8, (19) (20) (21) (22) . For example, an IAV strain that is reactive with SP-D in vitro, show decreased clearance in SP-D deficient mice, while a strain that binds poorly to SP-D showed no alteration in clearance (8, 19, 20) . Although SP-D can also bind to glycans associated with the neuraminidase (14) , inhibitory effects on neuraminidase activity appear to primarily depend on steric interference as a consequence of binding to the HA (23) .",

Notably, chimeras consisting of the N-terminal peptide and collagen domains of SP-D combined with the neck and CRD of bovine conglutinin show enhanced interactions with IAV, in part attributed to the greater IAV binding activities of the lectin domains (26, 27) . The ligand binding surfaces of the serum conglutinin and CL-43 diverge from SP-D at several locations, but are most notably characterized by insertions near the ligand binding site and by the substitution of valine or isoleucine for arginine at position 343. We have previously shown modest increases in antiviral activity with the insertions of RAK (or AAA) to resemble CL-43 (24) . Our recent studies have shown that residue 343 plays a critical role in mediating interactions of SP-D with phosphatidylinositol (PI), its major surfactant-associated ligand (28) , and with the core oligosaccharide domain of rough bacterial lipopolysaccharides (29) . In addition, earlier studies by Allen and coworkers demonstrated that a full-length human SP-D with valine at position 343 shows altered saccharide preferences with enhanced affinity for GlcNAc and certain other monosaccharide ligands (30) .",

Tagless proteins were isolated by maltosyl-agarose affinity chromatography (12) prior to purification of trimers by gel filtration on Superose 12 in 150mM NaCl, 10 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, containing 10mM calcium chloride (HBSC). The trimer fractions were pooled and the protein was concentrated by ultrafiltration to approximately 15 mg/ml prior to freezing at \u221280\u00b0C. Protein concentrations were determined using the bicinchoninic acid assay (BCA, Pierce, Rockford, Il) with BSA as standard. Purity was verified by SDS-PAGE and homogeneity was confirmed by dynamic light scattering using a 1mg/ml solution in the above buffer.",

All three monoclonals bound to wild type SP-D dodecamers (not shown) and to hNCRDs (Figure 9, panel A) . However, there were differential interactions of the antibodies with the 343 mutants. Although 246-02 bound to all three mutants and 246-06 show some decrease in binding, binding of 246-05 was largely abrogated by the substitution of valine or alanine for Arg343. The more conservative R343K mutation caused a less pronounced reduction of binding to 246-05. As shown in Panels B & C, the 246-02 and 246-05 mAbs blocked HA inhibitory activity of SP-D, while 246-06 did not.

Preferential binding of the wild-type protein to the linear \u03b11-2 linked trimannose (ligand #4), as compared to a tetramannose with the same terminal disaccharide (5), is consistent with secondary interactions and/or other significant effects of non-terminal sugars on binding affinity.

This was quite selective for the \u03b11-2 linkage; there was no significant increase in affinity for \u03b11-3 and \u03b11-6 dimannoses or the trimannose core in competition assays. Comparison crystallographic complexes of wild type and R343V with \u03b11-2 DM showed that the sugar ring conformations and geometry of the saccharide linkage were highly similar in the two complexes ( Figure 6 ) and consistent with the preferred solution conformation. However, the orientation of the bound disaccharide was very different in the two complexes. Whereas the wild-type protein bound \u03b11-2 DM in the more typical orientation, i.e., with the non-reducing terminal sugar bound to calcium, the binding orientation of the dimannose was flipped in R343V. In this alternate orientation, the reducing sugar is bound to calcium, while the terminal sugar participates in a strong H-bond with another conserved residue, Arg349. This flipped orientation has not been previously described for SP-D. However, we infer that loss of the Arg343 side chain increases steric access of oligosaccharides to the primary sugar binding site, while permitting additional H-bonding interactions with residues even more remote from this site. We cannot yet prove that this alternative binding orientation can be utilized by a solid-phase oligosaccharide. However, the alternate orientation, which is selected by R343V, should permit interactions with non-terminal mannoses of more complex glycans. For example, the alternate would position the reducing sugar of a linear trimannose or the corresponding internal residue of a high mannose glycan in the region of Asp325. This region has been previously implicated in interactions with mannan and IAV (24) . Thus, these observations offer a possible structural basis for the distinct binding preferences and enhanced interactions with high-mannose oligosaccharides exhibited by R343V as compared with wildtype SP-D.",

As indicated previously, the wild-type protein shows no detectable IAV binding and negligible HAI or viral neutralization in these same cells. These findings are consistent with data from collectin chimeras which suggested greater affinity of the conglutinin and mannan binding lectin CRDs for collectin-sensitive strains of IAV (19, 20) . Notably, both of these serum collectins have valine at the position corresponding to 343. Because the affinity for D-mannose was not significantly altered for these proteins, we attribute their enhanced binding to additional secondary interactions with the IAV oligomannoses. The available data strongly suggest that the valine side chain contributes to the enhanced recognition of viral glycans. In particular, the SP-D mutants R343A and R343I showed significantly lower viral binding, HAI, and neutralizing activity than R343V. R343K also showed no detectable binding to IAV. The reason for these differences is not yet apparent. Our inference is that the valine substitution eliminates the bulky Arg343 side chain, allowing the second sugar ring to make additional interactions with the Arg349 side chain. The longer isoleucine and lysine side chains could impose similar steric constraints as arginine, while the short alanine side chain might permit alteration of local backbone properties, leading to other functional consequences. Future crystallographic studies of these mutants should resolve these questions. Studies designed to examine the antiviral properties of R343V in vivo are in progress.",

Likewise, SP-D dodecamers can bind efficiently to PI liposomes, even though the hNCRDs and native trimeric subunits bind poorly (31) . Given that all the examined glycans are too small to engage more than one CRD of a trimer, preferential binding to longer linear or branched oligosaccharides might result from cooperative interactions among the CRDs of a trimer, but with each CRD showing only incremental increases in binding affinity as a result of secondary interactions at the ligand binding surface. On the other hand, a more complex ligand could also provide more opportunities for energetically favorable binding at any given ligand density. Planned studies comparing the interactions of wild-type and mutant dodecamers should be informative. A) Binding to mannan. Trimeric hNCRD fusion proteins were incubated with mannan coated plates as described in the Methods. Bound protein was detected using an S-protein peroxidase conjugate as previously described. Specific binding of the wild type hNCRD is compared to mutant hNCRDs with substitutions of valine (R343V) or alanine (R343A) for Arg343.
