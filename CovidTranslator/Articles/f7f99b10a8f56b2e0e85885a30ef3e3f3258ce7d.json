[1] [2] [3] The virus targets airway epithelium using angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a receptor and causes a novel coronavirus related pneumonia (NCP). Some severe cases develop into acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which can be fatal. [4] The infection spread throughout China and all over the world within 2 months. As of Feb 25 th , 2020, report from world health organization (WHO) indicated a total of 81,109 lab confirmed cases, from 38 countries and regions. Of them China had more than 78000 cases, and deaths had exceeded 2700. [5] Current epidemic evidence suggested the SARS-CoV-2 was highly contagious and humans were generally susceptible. [6] While most of the cases were mild or moderate and recovered after proper treatment, patients with underlying morbidities carried a substantial higher mortality than those without, especially those with cardiovascular disease. Also, severe cases can develop complications other than respiratory syndromes, and reports suggest 7-12% of the patients experience acute cardiac damage. [2, 7] Solid organ transplantation (SOT) recipients including heart transplant (HTx) recipients have a higher infection risk compared to the normal population due to immunosuppression by 4 anti-rejection therapy. (8.9) However, epidemiological and clinical characteristics of HTx recipients during the SARS-CoV-2 epidemics is largely unknown so far. We designed a comprehensive questionnaire to collect exposure history, clinical manifestations and treatments of HTx recipients in our hospital.",

Severe manifestations even death with SARS-CoV-2 has been associated in elderly patients with comorbidities, including 8 hypertension, diabetes, heart and/or kidney disease. [3] This finding is similar to increased severity and death in elderly patients following both SARS and MERS-CoV infection.

[15] Data from Ju Chunrong suggest that the number of SOT recipients in China suffering from SARS-CoV-2 infection are few, including only 9 confirmed cases altogether.

[17, 18] Epithelial cell surface components are exploited as primary receptors to mediate viral entry and the establishment of a viral infection. [19] One integral protease of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is a major physiologic regulator of the cardiovascular system, facilitates cellular entry of human CoVs. [20, 21] Most recently, the ACE2 had been identified as a receptor for SARS-CoV-2. [22, 23] ACE2 is thought to be a key regulator in maintenance of RAS homeostasis. [24, 25] Several studies illustrate the possible mechanism of immunosuppressants in activating RAS. [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] Ferrario et al. demonstrated that the treatment of cultured astrocytes with Ang-II caused a marked reduction in neural ACE2 mRNA and protein, mediated with either losartan or both losartan and lisinopril by the AT1 receptor. [31] It is unclear what, if any, difference in the expression of pulmonary ACE2 exists in the presence of immunosuppression and Investigating the difference of ACE2 between the recipients and normal population would provide further evidence.",

All these three CoVs induce excessive and aberrant non-effective host immune responses that are associated with severe lung pathology, leading to death. [32] The autopsy results of dead patients indicate diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) with alveolar edema, focal hemorrhage and hyaline membrane formation, [33] which are similar to the pathological manifestations of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). [34] However, most SARS-CoV-2 were mild or moderate cases, meanwhile cases report showed that the clinical manifestations and progression of SARS-CoV-2 infection in renal transplant recipients were generally consistent with common SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. [15] According to our investigation of epidemiologic history, we could not deny the possibility of contacting and getting infected with SARS-CoV-2 in HTx recipients. It is important to note that laboratory data may be misleading in HTx since several of our patients already exhibited lymphopenia which may be a result of use of immunosuppressants which prevent lymphocyte development and proinflammatory cytokines genes expression, such as interleukin (IL)-2, IL-3, IL-4, IFN-\u03b3, and TNF-\u03b1. [36] [37] [38] [39] Glucocorticoids inhibit immune responses by negative regulating immunocytes, [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] and especially weaken the strength of the T-cell receptor (TCR) signal, which is important in T cells activation and differentiation [46] . Thus, we imply that if HTx recipients were infected with SARS-CoV-2, they may not exhibit typical manifestations in the early stage due to the presence of immunosuppression. Our data suggest that maintaining the blood trough concentration of FK506 at (7.9\u00b12.9) ng/mL is appropriate. Yet the appropriate degree of immunosuppression needs further verification.",

First, the detailed clinical data for the recipients with airway symptoms were not fully extracted due to the variation of the database in different hospitals. Second, it's reported SARS-CoV-2 may have an extremely long incubation time, so longer observation and following-up are warranted. Furthermore, larger sample size will contribute to more reliability of the data. Furthermore, recall bias, which would be hard to avoid in a survey based investigation, should also be noted as a limitation. 11 In conclusion, according to our investigation we suggest that HTx recipients who used enhanced protection measures during the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak did not have a substantially higher rate of infection among the population. It is also important to note that immunosuppressed patients may not exhibit typical manifestations and might present confusing laboratory data thus obfuscating diagnosis in some cases. These early data will require confirmation as the pandemic establishes around the world.",
