Objective: To compare the plasma SARS-CoV RNA concentrations in ribavirin-treated patients who received early hydrocortisone therapy with those who received placebo. Study design: Serial plasma SARS-CoV RNA concentrations measured in the setting of a prospective, randomized double-blinded, placebocontrolled trial designed to assess the efficacy of \"early\" (<7 days of illness) hydrocortisone use in previously healthy SARS patients were analyzed. SARS-CoV RNA was quantified using a one-step real-time RT-PCR assay targeting the nucleocapsid gene. Results: Among 16 non-ICU cases, SARS-CoV RNA was detected in plasma since day 3-4 after fever onset; viral concentration peaked in the first week, which then rapidly declined in the second week of illness. On days 8, 12, 16, and 20, the cumulative proportion of patients with undetectable virus in plasma was 31%, 69%, 92%, and 100%, respectively. Plasma SARS-CoV RNA concentrations in the second and third week of illness were significantly higher in patients who received initial hydrocortisone treatment (n = 9), as compared to those who received placebo (n = 7)(AUC; Mann-Whitney, P = 0.023). The median time for SARS-CoV to become undetectable in plasma was 12 days (11-20 days) versus 8 days (8-15 days), respectively. Conclusion: Our findings suggested \"early\" corticosteroid treatment was associated with a higher subsequent plasma viral load.",

We previously described a real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) plasma/serum assay for early diagnosis of SARS (Ng et al., 2003) .

Ethics approval was obtained from the Instituional Review Board of the Chinese University of Hong Kong. However, the study was terminated because the Hong Kong outbreak ended in June 2003. The study inclusion criteria were: (1) \"Probable\" cases of SARS with or without laboratory confirmation according to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) case definition (CDC, 2003) and (2) age 18-65 years. Exclusion criteria were: (1) late presentation on \u22655 days after symptom onset; (2) presence of co-morbidity (e.g. renal impairment, liver failure, congestive heart failure, major cardiovascular diseases, chronic lung diseases, malignancy, etc.); and (3) evidence of respiratory failure on admission as defined by blood oxygen saturation (Sa O 2 ) \u2264 90% or oxygen tension of Pa O 2 < 8 kPa without supplemental oxygen therapy (i.e. in room air). Informed consents from patients were obtained. Routine serial laboratory investigations and plain chest radiographs were performed as described Sung et al., 2004) . Extent of pulmonary infiltrates on each frontal chest radiograph was scored in percentages by radiologists (Wong et al., 2003) . Conventional, qualitative SARS-CoV RT-PCR assays were performed weekly on throat gargles and stool specimens for each patient; and paired SARS-CoV serology (indirect immunofluorescence assay, 2-4 weeks apart) were also obatined (WHO, 2003; Chan et al., 2004) .

Its immunosuppressive effect (SARS is a viral induced pneumonia), potential side effects (e.g. superimposed bacterial/fungal infections, hyperglycemia, electrolyte imbalance, psychosis), and lack of evidence on clinical efficacy from randomized/placebo-controlled studies were the main concerns (Wang et al., 2003; Peiris et al., 2003a) . Corticosteroid was given to reduce possible immunopathological damage. Preliminary data from retrospective, non-randomized studies did demonstrate some clinical benefits in SARS patients receiving corticosteroid treatment (Sung et al., 2004; Ho et al., 2003) . However, the optimal timing and dosage of such therapy is uncertain. Results from our analysis do not support the use of corticosteroid therapy early in the illness because of delayed viral clearance, especially when no concomitant effective antiviral therapy is given. In fact, as shown in a separate study, \"early\" low-dose corticosteroid/hydrocortisone therapy failed to halt disease progression in >80% of cases (Sung et al., 2004) . Although we did not observe abrupt rebound of viraemia in our cohort after \"pulse\" methylprednisolone therapy given after the first week, further study is needed to clarify the issue. Meanwhile we call for cautious use of such therapy; and if used, preferably given in later course of the disease, when an overexuberant host immune response is causing pathological lung damage (e.g. in the second week following clinical deterioration) (Peiris et al., 2003b; Loutfy et al., 2003; Wong and Hui, 2003) , and when SARS-CoV viral load had declined significantly.",
