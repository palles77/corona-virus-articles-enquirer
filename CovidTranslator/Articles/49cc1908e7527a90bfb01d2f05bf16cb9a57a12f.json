This paper investigates this changing pattern of health insurance coverage in China using panel data from the China Nutrition and Health Survey (1991 2000). It is the first attempt in this literature that tries to identify precisely the effects of specific policies and reforms on health insurance coverage in the transitional period of China. The fixed effects linear model clustering at the province level is used for estimation, and results are compared to alternative models, including pooled OLS, random effects GLS model and fixed effects logit model. Strong empirical evidence is found that unemployment as a side effect of the Open Door Policy, and the deregulation of SOE and collective enterprises were the main causes for the decreasing trend. For example, urban areas that were highly affected by the Open Door Policy were associated with 17 percentage points decrease in the insurance coverage. Moreover, I found evidence that the gaps between SOE and non SOE employees, collective and non collective employees, urban and rural employees have considerably decreased during the ten years.",

            "text": "China has achieved great economic success as a result of economic ''reform and opening up'' since 1978. The annual economic growth rate was among the highest of all countries during the 1990s; GDP per capita has been increasing dramatically. China's economy has taken rapid steps to open up its doors to investment from foreign countries and competition. In addition, the economic structure has undergone dramatic changes. State owned Enterprises (SOEs) reformed from government protected units to profit maximizing enterprises. Deregulation has allowed collective enterprises (enterprises owned by local government: province, city, county, etc) to become either contract responsibility system 1 or individual firms. Meanwhile, there was a big boom in private, foreign funded and other source funded enterprises.",

However, rela tively few studies emphasized that dramatic reform also affected employment and associated welfare benefits. Chen (2005) has noticed unemployment and social security sustainability problem after reforms. Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping directed the Chinese economy to build ''socialism with Chinese characteristics''. This direction essentially allowed all enterprises to participate in a market economy while still keeping the ownership of the state. However, there was no clear statement as of how this goal would affect the welfare provision in China. As state firms faced fierce competition and financial troubles, were they still able to continue providing welfare benefits? Moreover, the urban and rural gap in the economic conditions has become larger. The report in the New York Times (Jan 14th, 2000) noted that ''the collapse of socialized medicine and staggering cost increases [opened] a yawning gap between health care in the cities and the rural areas'', which had the consequences that ''absence of adequate health care.spread infectious diseases like hepatitis and tuberculosis and making the country and the world more vulnerable to epidemics like severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, and possibly bird flu. '' This paper looks at health insurance benefit as one of the most important components of welfare benefits. The purpose of this paper is fourfold: (1) to illustrate the changing pattern of health insurance in the transitional economy during 1990 2000; (2) to investigate the causes of declining coverage of public health insurance; (3) to examine the impact of recent economic restructuring on China's workers' health insurance coverage; and (4) to determine whether there is a rural and urban difference in insurance coverage.",

TVEs were referred to as rural collective enterprises here. 4 TVEs and non state enterprises were allowed to hire labor through contract and determine wages independently. More and more TVEs and non state enterprises were reformed into individual owned or private owned firms if they were small. Since in China non state owned enterprises were not required to provide health insurance, workers who remained in the reformed collective enterprises were likely to lose health insurance. In addition, in the middle and later 1990s, the rural collective enterprises had slower growth which further troubled the insurance coverage. 5",

(2003) demonstrated that economic restructuring as the consequence of economic reform from 1996 to 2001 caused a large unemployment shock that in turn led to ''health benefit arrears'' and new jobs created by government programs could not guarantee workers' health insurance benefits.",

In contrast, other private had only 6% coverage rates and unemployed had 8% coverage. This may be because some of the unemployed workers still had their registered work units status (a status called xiagang), so they still maintained welfare relationships with their work unit. SOE and collectives experienced great loss of insurance overt time whereas other private and unemployed had relatively constant coverage (with a slight increase in 1997 and a slight drop in 2000) (See Fig. 2 as well). Retirees also had a slightly higher insurance coverage (around 12%) than the non SOE and the non collective employees, as retirees from the SOEs or the collective enterprises could still keep their insurance. House wife's insurance status depended on whether any household member worked in a SOE or a collective enterprise. Most college students were insured through the school medical insurance as most universities were state owned. To summarize, SOEs and collective enterprises decreased provision of health insurance to their workers greatly, whereas other private had slightly increased insurance coverage (6% in 1991 and 7% in 2000) and unemployed remained relatively constant (around 8%). (3) Urban residents (65%) had much higher insurance coverage than rural residents (11%) did at the beginning of 1990s. However, dramatic decreases in insurance coverage occurred in urban areas (from 65% to 44%), whereas rural areas had only small decline (from 11% to 8%). Migration from rural areas to urban areas may cause loss of health insurance as they were not officially registered in the cities. 8 (4) Predictably, the poor group had the lowest insurance rate (11% in 1991), whereas the rich group had the highest insurance rate (49% in 1991). However, over time insurance coverage decreased more for the rich group, so that the difference between the rich and poor narrowed. The associated phenomenon was also noticed in the literature.",

But it has the detraction that it is only estimable for individuals that switch insurance status at some stage (Cameron & Trivedi (2005) , pp 796). For this reason the original 12,264 individuals (most of whom had either no insurance in all periods they were observed or insurance in all periods they were observed) is reduced to 2017 individuals. Thus, the results from the fixed effects logit model are deemphasized due to the sample size loss, but they are given in last column of Table 5 . Y is a binary variable which indicates health insurance status of an individual in a given province and a given year. Although private insurance existed in China in the later 1990s, not many people had private insurance. There were few cases of ''opting out'' of the publicly provided insurance. Those who had the choice of private insurance tend to choose to be insured by both public and private insurance. This is why temporary health status is treated as exog enous in the regression as not many Chinese people are able to purchase or choose private insurance by themselves. The time invariant fixed effect term a i represents individual unobserved factors. Open jt is the indicator of the degree of openness. Collective jt is the indicator of the number of collective enterprises in each province. The parameters of interest are 4 and p since they measure the reform effects and we call them ''heterogeneous treatment effects''. Z it are individual level control variables which include work unit type (SOE, Collective, Others, Unemployed) and registration status (urban or rural). Since we are also interested in how the gaps between different types of workers change over time, interaction terms between Z it and Open jt are included in the regression as well. X it are other individual level control variables and include age, education, gender, health status, marital status, household income and the number of bread earners in the household.

The reason for more insured in the selected sample is that in order to be selected the person had to have had insurance in at least one year. This will inevitably lead to higher insurance rates when the original insurance rate was only 29%.

I also constructed the reform variables for the year 2000 following the methodology of Woo et al. (2002) . The Open Door Policy variables differentiate across provinces and years, which can be used to identify the effects of economic reforms. ''Open degree 1'' is a binary variable indicating whether or not the Open Door Policy was in place in a certain province. ''Open degree 2'' is a binary variable indicating whether or not the policy had been developed to a certain level in a certain province and it indicates how much the province had been affected by the policy.

In the case of the FE logit estimator, a cluster bootstrap is used to get the cluster robust standard errors. 9 Results are summarized as follows. The reform variables (''Collective 2''), interaction terms (SOE*Open Degree 1, Collecti ve*Open Degree 1) are negative and statistically significant at 5% in all models using the full sample. Fixed effects model (Table 5 column 2 and column 4) also gives statistically significant estimates for three more interaction terms (Collective*Open Degree 2, Reg*Open Degree 1, and Reg*Open Degree 2). On one hand, declining insurance coverage were strongly associated with economic reforms. On the other hand, the statistical significance of the interaction terms indicates the gap between SOE and non SOE workers, collective and non collective workers, and urban rural areas were shrinking. This is consistent with Fig. 1 where SOE and collective workers had the largest decline in insurance coverage whereas others had relatively small decline or even a slightly increase. Work unit type indicators are statistically significant at 5% in all models, which indicates strong association between welfare and employment status.",

            "text": "insurance coverage. In particular, in urban areas insurance coverage was reduced by, respectively, 3.3% and 17.4% due to the beginning (''Open Degree 1'') and the developing (''Open Degree 2'') of the Open Door policy. The Open Door Policy was associated with two counter effects: decrease in SOE insurance and increase in provision of private insurance. However, the positive effect was dominated by the negative effect since private insurance was not widely purchased in China during the 1990s. The reforms in collective enterprises (refer to coefficient of ''Collective 2'') is associated with 8% points decrease in health insurance. The transition to contract system and individual owned firms, and the slower growth of collective enterprises especially rural collective enterprises were the key factors affecting the provision of public health insurance. The falling of rural collective enterprises was largely due to overall economic downturn, financial intermediation inadequacy and migration of skilled labors. The negative signs of the interaction terms are strong evidence that the gaps between SOE and non SOE employees, collective and non collective employees, urban and rural employees have considerably decreased. In particular, when China began to open up (see the interaction terms with ''Open Degree 1''), the gap between SOE and non SOE employees decreased 8.6%; the gap between collective and non collective employees decreased by 15.7%; and the gap between urban and rural workers decreased by 5.16%. The gap decreased further when the economy became more opened up (see the interaction terms with ''Open Degree 2''). The decrease in gap was largely due to the lost in welfare benefits of SOE and collective workers rather than the better off of non SOE and non collective workers. Even though the increases in income disparities in the 1990s were found in many studies (Tyler (1995) , Ying (1999) , Liu, Hsiao, and Eggleston (1999) ), the gap in welfare benefits had shrank during the economic open up and deregulation process. Fixed effects linear model (Table 5 column 5) and fixed effects logit model (Table 5 column 4) use the selected sample that had their insurance status changed over time. The signs of all the coefficients do not change, which indicate our results are pretty robust. The FE logit coefficients are scaled differently to linear case so coefficients are not directly comparable. The magnitudes for statistically significant variables are about 2 3 times larger in the selected sample (compare column 5 with column 2). The enlarge ment of the policy effects in the selected sample is expected since this sample excludes individuals whose insurance status did not change. Fig. 3 (top) demonstrates the relationship of the Open Door Policy and health insurance coverage. Health insurance coverage declined gradually as the Open Door Policy expanded in China. Also shown in Fig. 3 (bottom) is the collective index. The collective enterprises employment ratio in each province increased (the index has dropped) while the health insurance coverage rate dropped from 1991 to 1993, however we also observe that from 1997 to 2000 the most dramatic decrease in the health insurance coverage was associated with the most decline in the collective enterprises employment ratio (the index has increased).

However, the continuing decline of health insurance coverage and its association to the Open Door Policy served as strong evidence that only those SOEs that can survive market competition are more likely to continue their provision of welfare benefits.",
