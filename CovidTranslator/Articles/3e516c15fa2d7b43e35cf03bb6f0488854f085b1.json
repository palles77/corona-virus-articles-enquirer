Diarrhoea is a common and important cause of morbidity and mortality in calves; therefore, we investigated whether the presence of AstV is associated with calf diarrhoea. We identified diverse AstV lineages from faecal samples of both healthy and diarrhoeic calves and healthy adult cattle in South West Scotland. AstV was common in calves (present in 74% (85/115) of samples) but uncommon in adult cattle (present in 15% (3/20) of samples). No association was found between the presence of AstV and calf diarrhoea or the presence of a specific AstV lineage and calf diarrhoea. AstV was strongly associated with the presence of rotavirus Group A (RVA), and a protective effect of age was evident for both AstV and RVA. Co-infections with multiple AstV lineages were detected in several calves and serial infection with different viruses could also be seen by longitudinal sampling of individuals. In summary, our study found genotypically diverse AstV in the faeces of calves in South West Scotland. However, no association was identified between AstV and calf diarrhoea, which suggests the virus does not play a primary role in the aetiology of calf diarrhoea in the group studied.",

Approximately half of the mortality in dairy calves up to 1 month old has been attributed to diarrhoea (Brickell et al., 2009) . Diarrhoea in calves has many causes including infectious agents. The four pathogens most often associated with the disease are the protozoal parasite Cryptosporidium parvum, the viruses rotavirus and coronavirus, and enterotoxigenic strains of the bacteria Escherichia coli (Cho and Yoon, 2014) . Other viral pathogens which have a less well defined association with calf diarrhoea include bovine torovirus, bovine calicivirus and bovine astrovirus.",

Astroviruses have long been recognised as an important cause of paediatric diarrhoea in human infants (reviewed in (Moser and Schultz-Cherry, 2005) ); however, their role in enteric disease in other species is less clear. A diverse range of AstVs have been detected in faecal samples from diarrhoeic (Englund et al., 2002; Snodgrass et al., 1979; Toffan et al., 2009; Xiao et al., 2013) and healthy animals (Luo et al., 2011; Ng et al., 2013; Reuter et al., 2011; Tse et al., 2011) from a wide variety of species; however, their presence has only been convincingly linked with enteritis in mink and turkeys (Behling-Kelly et al., 2002; Englund et al., 2002) .

In contrast to the results from calves, AstV was uncommon in older cattles from the herds examined, being detected in only 3 out of 20 adult cattles (15.0%) none of which had signs of diarrhoea ( Fig. 1(a) ). We also investigated the presence of rotavirus Group A (RVA), a common cause of calf diarrhoea (Dhama et al., 2009) , by analysing the faecal samples from healthy and diarrhoeic calves for RVA using PCR directed against highly conserved sequences in the RVA segment VP1.

However, AstV was also found to be strongly associated with RVA ( Fig. 1(b) ), which could therefore be acting as a confounding factor. Indeed, after adjusting for the presence of RVA using a Mantel-Haenszel adjusted odds ratio the relationship between AstV and diarrhoea was no longer statistically significant ( Fig. 1(b) ). To examine this further a multivariable model was developed to estimate the association between AstV and diarrhoea after adjusting for both RVA and animal age using a Firth logistic regression model (Table 1 ). The model suggests that adult animals have a lower odds of having diarrhoea (OR = 0.53; 95% CI 0.004-0.459) and that animals with RVA presence have $15 (OR = 14.6: 95% CI 5.80-41.2) times the odds of having diarrhoea compared to those without.

We also tested for any evidence of a statistical interaction/effect modification between the two viruses but this was not significant and not included for simplicity.

In order to determine if particular bovine AstVs are differentially associated with calf diarrhoea, amplicons from AstV PCRs selected to represent all positive farms and a variety of amplicon intensities were cloned and sequenced. A total of 209 individual clones from 48 amplicons (1-8 clones per amplicon from 28 diarrhoeic calves, 17 healthy calves and 3 healthy adults) were sequenced. Primer sequences were trimmed and a 220 nucleotide region equivalent to nucleotides 3316-3535 in the bovine AstV sequence HQ916313 was used for further analysis. 76 unique sequences were identified from the 209 clone sequences analysed. Phylogenetic analysis of these sequences revealed the presence of three distinct viral lineages (Fig. 2) with varying degrees of relatedness to previously described AstV from cattle, deer and pigs. The overall diversity of clones from healthy and diarrhoeic calves was similar with comparable numbers of clones from these two sample sets in the three viral lineages identified. The sequences in each of the three groups were diverse, with those classified as lineage 2 showing the highest variability with a mean pairwise nucleotide divergence across the analysed region of 18.1% compared to 11.9% and 6.2% in lineages 1 and 3, respectively. Pairwise distances between lineages were 30.0% (lineage 1 vs 2), 23.3% (lineage 1 vs 3) and 28.8% (lineage 2 vs 3). While the majority of AstV clones from a single individual contained identical or closely related sequences, there were three cases (Fig. 2 , nodes marked *, + and #) where sequences of multiple lineages were cloned from a single individual's PCR amplicon indicating concurrent infection with multiple, diverse AstVs. Overall, many different AstVs were found in the faeces of calves; however, no association of a particular lineage with calf diarrhoea was identified.",

No significant change was seen in viral sequences detected from samples on the 29th November, 17th December and 20th December with all being within lineage 3 and differing at most by 5 out of 223 nucleotides. However, from the sample taken on the 28th of December, lineage 1, 2 and 3 sequences were detected, demonstrating a clear mixed infection. From the sample collected on the 10th of January only lineage 2 sequences were detected. Overall these results show marked variation in the AstVs in the faeces of a single animal over time, with different AstVs present at different times and presence of multiple AstV lineages at the same time. In the three animals examined no temporal link was found between a change in AstV and the outcome of disease.",

Here we report a high prevalence of genetically varied astroviruses in faecal samples from both healthy and diarrhoeic calves in South West Scotland. No association between diarrhoea and presence of AstV was detected, neither was there an association between diarrhoea and specific AstV genotypes. This suggests that AstV were not an important cause of diarrhoea in our case animals. The finding is in contrast to the well-characterised enteric pathogen RVA which was found to be significantly associated with diarrhoeic calves in our study.",

It is possible that different PCR design may explain the difference since during optimisation of the AstV PCR in our study we found that the use of primers designed specifically for bovine AstV strains resulted in more sensitive and reproducible detection of AstV from bovine faeces compared to use of pan-AstV primers (data not shown).",

This age stratification is similar to reports from human medicine where AstV diarrhoea occurs predominantly in children (Afrad et al., 2013) and reported disease outbreak tend to be in children (Dalton et al., 2002; Li et al., 2010) and the elderly (Lewis et al., 1989) , suggesting that protection against AstV is acquired after an initial infection and later wanes.

            "text": "Sequencing of the RNA dependent RNA polymerase gene of the bovine AstV species found in Scottish cattle revealed several highly divergent lineages within the Mamastrovirus genus. By sequencing sequential samples from the same animals, we have shown AstV infection to be highly dynamic with different AstVs present in the same animal concurrently and sequentially. It is unclear whether this absence of genotypic consistency is due to constant reinfection with viruses from different lineages, differential shedding of certain lineages over time or detection of non-infecting viruses acquired through dietary contamination. Our ability to classify the Fig. 3 . Phylogeny of unique AstV clones as inferred from partial RdRp sequences (equivalent to nucleotides 3316-3535 of the bovine AstV sequence HQ916313). The tree was constructed using representative AstV sequences from humans (HuAstV), pigs (PoAstV), rodents (MuAstV), cattle (BoAstV), mink (MiAstV) and deer (CcAstV). Nodes with different symbols represent clones collected on different dates from four calves as indicated by the key. The evolutionary history was inferred using maximum likelihood methods. The optimum maximum likelihood models (lowest Bayesian information criterion score and typically greatest maximum likelihood value) for the nucleotide sequence alignment was first determined and used for phylogenetic reconstruction. This was the Tamura 3-parameter model with a gamma (g) distribution. Bootstrap support of branches (500 replications) is indicated. viral sequences detected was restricted by the limited size of the screening amplicons; however, further characterisation of complete genomes from these viruses will better inform classification and investigate the potential for recombination given the detection of concurrent infection with multiple AstV lineages. The use of the more specific PCR in this study compared to the published pan AstV assay (Chu et al., 2008) may have resulted in a restriction of viral lineages detected although the diversity of sequences reported here and obtained in an initial screen of these samples with the published assay was comparable (data not shown). Importantly, no sequences identified in the initial screen were shown to cluster with the recently described bovine neurotropic AstV (marked with red node labels in Fig. 2 ) (Bouzalas et al., 2014; Li et al., 2013) indicating that this lineage of viruses may have a more restricted prevalence or different tissue tropism. We investigated co-infection of AstV with a common viral enteric pathogen-RVA. Co-infection with AstV and other enteric pathogens has been reported previously in calves (Oem and An, 2014; Woode et al., 1984) and humans (Afrad et al., 2013; Li et al., 2010) , and our study found that presence of AstV and RVA in calf faeces were strongly associated. We were unable to determine if this association is causal, for example if AstV presence predisposes calves to RVA infection or vice versa, or the clinical significance of the association for example if AstV potentiates the severity of diarrhoea caused by RVA, as has been reported experimentally (Woode et al., 1984) . Definitive determination of bovine AstV as an enteric pathogen, either singly or in combination with another pathogen such as RVA, would require viral isolation and experimental infections under natural conditions. However, our study, with the important inclusion of age and geographically matched controls, found no evidence that detection of AstV, or even specific AstV lineages, in the faeces of calves is associated with diarrhoea.",
