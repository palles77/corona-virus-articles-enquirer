This autoimmune syndrome is a CNS complication after infections with a number of different enveloped viruses, e.g. mumps, measles, rubella, influenza and varicella. However, the pathophysiological mechanism leading to this breaking of natural self tolerance in the course of viral infection remains an enigma. A long-lasting hypothesis has suggested that incorporation of cellular (self) proteins into the envelope of budding viruses might be a possible mechanism leading to autosensitization. In a model study we demonstrate here that vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), grown in myelin protein-expressing cell cultures, is highly efficient in triggering T cell responses to MBP in vitro and can prime autoreactive T cell immune responses in vivo. On the basis of these findings, we suggest that incorporation of CNS membrane components into the viral envelope and subsequent priming of self-reactive immune responses might be the common pathogenic mechanism underlying the postinfectious encephalomyelitis syndrome.",

            "text": "Virus infections are often accompanied by transiently appearing self-reactive T cell responses, which might occassionally be even high enough to cause destruction of self components, i.e. to manifest clinical signs of an autoimmune disease. In fact, experimental models of virus-mediated autoimmune diseases are still nowadays the only satisfying models to exemplify naturally occurring induction of autoimmunity [5, 13, 21, 24] . However, the exact mechanisms leading to the breakdown of natural tolerance in the course of viral infections remain largely obscure. Postinfectious encephalomyelitis syndrome (PES) is an infrequent complication after infections with a number of different evenloped viruses [3, 9, 10] . PES is an acute and monophasic disease, where neurological manifestations may be severe and sometimes even with a fatal outcome. Clinical symptomatology comprises seizures and motor deficits, such as hemiparesis, cranial nerve palsies, and cerebellar ataxia (reviewed in [9] ). Interestingly, in most cases infectious virus can no longer be isolated from the brain or cerebrospinal fluid of patients with postinfectious encephalomyelitis at the onset of clinical disease. This has led to the assumption that a transient viral infection of the brain, which is per se not exerting a vast destructive effect on the integrity of brain functions, is subsequently followed by an (auto-)immune-mediated destruction of the cerebral tissue [6] . Pathological similarities to experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) and post-rabies vaccine encephalomyelitis, such as perivenular inflammatory foci in white matter and the spinal cord, give further support to the hypothesis that the disease might have an autoimmune character. Indeed, significant primary T cell responses specific for myelin basic protein (MBP) can frequently be observed in patients with PES, both in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and in cells derived from the cerebrospinal fluid [3, 7, 9, 10, 14, 15] . This high degree of autoreactivity against a particular antigen strongly suggests a crucial role of the autoantigen in pathogenicity.",

Such a common pathogenic mechanism could explain the puzzling observation that PES is found after infections with a great variety of different enveloped viruses, including influenza, rabies, rubella, measles, varicella, and many others [9] , which makes immune cross-reactivity (i.e. molecular mimikry [5, 8] ) as the underlying pathogenic principle highly unlikely. The hypothesis of enveloped viruses as carriers of autoantigens gains further support from an older observation that brain tissue infected with viruses exhibits a greatly enhanced encephalitogenic potential, when administered to experimental animals. Furthermore, neuroparalytic reactions have been documented in humans immunized with rabies vaccines prepared from neuronal tissue, which can be regarded as the direct human equivalent to various models of virus-mediated EAE [22] .",

When testing PLP-specific T cells in the presence of oligodendroglia-grown virus, no stimulation was observed (Fig. 1 b) . Interestingly, this result parallels the situation in PES, where patients have been shown to exhibit a specific T cell reactivity for MBP but not for PLP [7] . . SJL mouse T cell lines specific for rat MBP (a) or PLP (b) were established as described recently [19] . T cells (3xl04/well) were incubated with various doses of soluble MBP or a synthetic PLP oligopeptide [single letter amino acid (aa) code: QAHSLERVCHCLGKWLGHPDK; aa 130-150] or oligodendroglia-grown V SV (\"VSV * \"; with the respective dilution of a stock solution indicated) in the presence of macrophage-enriched irradiated syngeneic thymocytes (2xl0S/well).

The most often discussed postulates comprise molecular mimicry based on the homology between antigenic determinants of viruses and host cells [5] , generation of anti-idiotypic responses, and polyclonal activation of B cells and T cells by virus-evoked cytokine release. All of these mechanisms can hardly explain the phenomenon of PES, where an astoundingly Oligodendroglia-grown VSV or HeLa cellgrown control virus was prepared as described in detail in Material and methods. For detection of MBP antigen, virions were ether-disrupted, dotted onto a PVDF membrane and incubated with a mixture of three MBP-specific monoclonal antibodies, a Oligodendroglia-grown VSV; b the same amount of HeLa cell-grown VSV; c 100 ng/ml of purified soluble rat MBP large variety of rather distantly related viruses cause an immune response to one and the same autoantigen, MBP. However, incorporation of myelin proteins into viral envelopes could define the common basis leading to MBP-specific autoreactivity in this syndrome. It is nowadays generally assumed that autoimmune diseases in man are entities that are caused by many factors. Since inflammatory demyelinating signs, even after measles or rabies vaccine remain an infrequent and very rare complication, many factors are likely to contribute to disease, such as genetic factors, humoral immune responses and autoreactive T cell responses. For the induction of the latter, which may be a necessary but alone not sufficient event to ultimately manifest clinical symptoms in man, we describe here a new mechanism.",
