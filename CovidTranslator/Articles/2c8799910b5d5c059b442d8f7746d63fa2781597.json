            "text": "The Disease and Its Impact Trevor R. Ames, DVM, MS Pneumonia of dairy calves or enzootic calf pneumonia is an important component of the bovine respiratory disease complex31; also included in this complex are shipping fever of feedlot cattle and acute respiratory distress syndrome or atypical interstitial pneumonia. 31 Dairy calf pneumonia (DCP) has traditionally been described as affecting calves from 2 to 6 months of age. ll Recent prospective studies examining cohorts of calves have found calves may be affected with DCP as early as 2 weeks of age,56 with peak incidence occurring at 5 to 6 weeks.44, 57 Biss et al found that 53 of 26, 765 dairy calves aged 4 to 14 days were condemned at slaughter for lesions of enzootic pneumonia. 8 Of the 370 carcasses reported condemned, enzootic pneumonia was second only to navel ill in reason for condemnation. 8 These slaughter condemnation data further reinforces the concern that DCP may start much earlier in life than previously recognized. Virtala et al 56 found that veterinarydiagnosed DCP occurred at a younger age than did caretaker-diagnosed DCP. Studies relying solely on owner diagnosis of DCp57 have usually found later ages of disease onset than those using veterinary diagnosis. 56 Pneumonia of dairy calves occurs both as endemic diseases and as outbreaks of respiratory disease. 4 ,44 Chronic endemic disease is the most common manifestation of this disease, and as a result, pneumonia of dairy calves is often called enzootic calf pneumonia. This distinction between enzootic and epizootic DCP may be especially important in reference to cause, as different causes are more important in each form of the disease. 4 ,44 DCP is manifest as calves with fever, nasal discharge, lacrimination, cough, increased respiratory rate, depression, rough hair coats, poor weight gains, and partial anorexia. Auscultation will reveal abnormal lung sounds, including increased bronchial sounds, crackles, and wheezes, with evidence of consolidation heard in advanced cases. Cranial tracheal compression may induce a cough response. Advanced cases of DCP may exhibit dyspnea and emaciation. Virtala et aP6 found that the earliest sign of DCP was often fever, and that signs referable to respiratory system followed this initial fever. Early symptoms of DCP remain subclinical to many caretakers, raising concern that more established refractory disease will be present when it is recognized by the caretaker. Acute outbreaks of DCP often produce more recognizable disease for the caretaker, as multiple animals are depressed and febrile, with some calves having symptoms referable to the respiratory system.",

Prospective studies that examine seroconversion to various respiratory pathogens in calves experiencing respiratory disease may provide some useful information. Three studies have followed calves over the first 3 to 4 months of life, monitoring the serologic response to the respiratory viruses (BRSV, PI-3, BVDV, BHV-l). 44, 54, 56 Seroconversion to BHV-l, BVDV, PI-3, or BRSV was a rare occurrence for any of the viruses in healthy and pneumonic calves, and was not found to be significantly correlated with cases of respiratory disease. 44 ,56 These studies would suggest that respiratory viruses are not commonly associated with enzootic calf pneumonia or endemic DCP. Seroconversion to BRSV was documented on farms where outbreaks of DCP occurred. 44 This is consistent with previous work that demonstrated that BRSV was the causal agent most commonly associated with the outbreaks of DCP. 4 Prospective studies have examined the serologic response to M. bovis and M. dispar in dairy calves over the first 3 to 4 months of life. 54 ,56 One study found calves with higher passive antibody titers to M. dispar in the first month of life, had fewer cases of pneumonia, and better growth rates than did calves with low antibody titers to M. dispar. 54 This would imply that high antibody titers to M. dispar protects calves from DCP and subsequent poor growth. Virtala et al 56 found that seroconversion to M. dispar was a common event in dairy calves that occurred in both clinical cases and healthy calves. The role of mycoplasmal agents as initiators of DCP needs further documentation, but research to date suggests these agents may play an important initiating role.",

Numerous studies have examined the importance of failure of passive transfer in the DCP morbidity or mortality. 36, 44, 54, 56 In one study, postcolostral immunoglobin levels were found to be negatively correlated with cases of pneumonia and positively correlated with growth rate. 54 Davidson et aP9 found that calves with low immunoglobin levels were treated for pneumonia earlier and longer than calves with high immunoglobin levels, and that in some groups, low immunoglobin levels were associated with increased respiratory morbidity. Other studies have failed to show an association between immunoglobin levels or failure of passive transfer and the occurrence of respiratory disease or calf mortality. 36 One study concluded that unless large numbers of calves are examined it may be difficult to detect a significant difference in calf morbidity or mortality in calves with failure of passive transfer. 44 Rea et aP6 concluded that calves with lower passive transfer values had increased risk of death, but that failure of passive transfer is not an infallible predictor of mortality. The morbidity and mortality attributable to DCP accounts for less than half of the total calf morbidity and mortality typically reported. As a result, the effect of the immunoglobin levels on DCP-related morbidity and mortality will be even more difficult to document than total calf morbidity and mortality. An additional explanation for the difficulty in documenting a correlation between immunoglobin levels and DCP is that a significant amount of DCP occurs in calves over 2 months of age, and immunoglobins to many pathogens of DCP have waned by 2 months of age. 14 Regular herd vaccination, especially in dry cows, should increase the levels of specific antibody in calves receiving adequate amounts of colostrum. Vaccination of calves with vaccines after colostral immunity has declined or with intranasal vaccines in the face of passive immunity may produce a protective immune response in calves that prevents or limits the severity of DCP for certain infectious agents.",

Ambient temperature is an important factor affecting dairy calf health. 51 Cold weather is especially important for young calves, which have little body insulation. Increased humidity or precipitation in the calf's environment worsens the calf's ability to maintain thermal neutrality. Warm weather can also be undesirable, as young calves are capable of greater perspiration per pound of body weight than adults, and warm weather may predispose young calves to dehydration. 51 The bacterial content of air in cattle barns can be as high as 10 6 organisms/m 3 . 2o Disease incidence can be affected by length of pathogen survival time as an aerosol and the concentration of the pathogen in the air space. Humidity is an important limiting factor affecting pathogen survival. The optimum zone for limiting survival time of bovine pathogens is 55% to 75% relative humidity.7 Adequate fresh air flow into the calf's environment is important in limiting humidity and reducing the concentration of noxious gases and pathogens. 6 The flow of air should be from younger, more susceptible cattle to older, less susceptible cattle to limit moving pathogens from older cattle to younger cattle. Adequate fresh air flow and proper directional movement of air are important goals of ventilation.",

Individual calf hutches that are properly located provide the calf with adequate fresh air free of pathogens and noxious gases and overcome many of the problems found with the calf barns. 3 Calves moved out of hutches can then be put into small groups separated from older cattle using super hutches. 3 Like the calf hutch, the super hutch also serves to limit pathogen transmission and build-up of noxious gases in this susceptible group of calves.",

Oxender et al 34 found lower mortality rates when calves are raised away from the cows, but other studies have not found this to be true. 46 The type of housing is also important when calves are housed separately from adults. Waltner-Toews et a1 58 found lower mortality rates in calves housed in hutches as opposed to those housed in group pens, which agrees with a number of other studies suggesting outdoor hutches are superior to all other methods of calf raising. 28 ,44 Calf level risk factors that affect mortality include dystocia, assisted first-colostrum feeding, and birth outside the maternity pen. 58 Calf level risk factors that have been reported to increase the risk of DCP morbidity are birth from a first-calf heifer,17 concurrent disease,I7,59 and pail feeding of colostrum. 59 Housing the calves in hutches and prophylactic antibiotics at birth had a protective effect on calf morbidity associated with DCP.59 Other calf level risk factors for DCP that were discussed earlier in this article were reported by Virtala et a1 56 and Van Donkersgoed et al. 54 Those risk factors having a negative association included low serum immunoglobin,54 low first-month titers to P. haemolytica,54 cultures of P. multocida and M. dispar from a tracheal wash,3 and rising titers to M. dispar. 56 Large-scale epidemiologic investigation poses a significant challenge for researchers. Selecting cohorts of calves to study that are representative of the population as a whole, including large enough sample size in the study and collecting data in a manner that gives accurate representation, are but a few of the challenges. These types of studies are major undertakings that rarely provide conclusive answers to the large number of questions being asked.

Evaluation of lungs at slaughter has been used as a diagnostic screen for enzootic swine pneumonia, with the finding that every 10% of pig's lungs affected with pathology equates to a depression in growth of 37.4 g. 24 Beef calves with lung lesions at slaughter have decreased mean daily gain (0.076 kg/day) compared to those without lesions. 62 Cross-bred beef and dairy calves also had reductions in mean daily gain as well as carcass weights if lung lesions were present at slaughter. 50 Similarly, veal calves with lung lesions at slaughter had carcass weights of 4.3 kg less than carcasses of calves that lacked lesions. 55 Beef calves that are treated for respiratory disease have been shown to be associated with increased amount of pulmonary lesions when compared to untreated cohorts. 62 Feedlot calves that received treatment for respiratory disease did not perform as well as cohorts not receiving treatment when average daily gain was examined for both groups.5 Taken together, these studies suggest that when respiratory disease is present, it will result in decreased growth rate of calves experiencing respiratory disease regardless of whether these calves have been treated for respiratory disease or not.

Goodger et aFi has stated that the investment in replacement heifers is the second largest financial input into the dairy enterprise,2i with feed costs representing the largest dollar input. As discussed previously, the cost of DCP can be considerable. Control programs combined with housing and management practices aimed at elimination of DCP could have a profound effect on the costs associated with heifer replacements. The most profound effect would be through a reduced age at first calving, as this would decrease the time period of expenditures made on the heifer prior to reaching the lactating herd. Death loss and the cost of treatment for clinical cases would be virtually eliminated, and heifers would enter the lactating herd free of chronic pneumonia, which limits lifetime productivity.",

            "text": "The decision that modern dairy farmers must now make is if they are capable and willing to raise the heifers in housing that will maximize their genetic potential. Dairy farmers that use facilities with inadequate housing and ventilation and fail to use herd vaccination will be faced with the reality that they must adopt the changes needed to be competitive or consider having their heifers raised by a contract heifer raiser. Contract heifer raisers typically take the calves from dairy farms from birth to weaning and raise the heifers until they are returned as bred heifers 1 month before calving. Contract heifer raising can provide a number of advantages, including increased time and labor for the dairy farmer to concentrate on the lactating herd and proper forage harvesting and storage. Space may be freed up for uses, such as dry cow facilities, maternity facilities, or adding cows to the lactating herd. The competitiveness of most contracts for heifer raising necessitates that optimum housing and management practices be in place so that financial rewards can be realized. One concern of contract heifer raising arrangements is that the returning heifers may bring infectious agents, such as Johne's disease or bovine leukemia virus, back to the dairy farm. Hopefully, contract raisers will use control measures to prevent such disease and demonstrate to the dairy farmer that there is a real advantage to their services. In addition, for some farms, raising the heifers at a separate facility may significantly decrease the incidence of currently experienced conditions, like Johne's disease, because of age segregation. A final option for the producer not wanting to raise his own replacements would be to purchase heifers from other dairies or sales barns. This would increase the risk of purchasing cattle with disease and would not guarantee heifers that had been raised under ideal housing and management unless the seller was known to the buyer. Purchasing heifers would also not lend itself to genetic improvement of the herd.",
