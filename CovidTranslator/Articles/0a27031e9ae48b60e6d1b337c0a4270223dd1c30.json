Climate change extends the suitable environment for vectors previously confined to particular geographic areas; consequently, tropical diseases are no longer constricted in tropical areas. However, the most important parameter for \"globalization\" of infectious diseases is the restless mobility of humans. International travel has been steadily increasing beyond travel for business and tourism. Visiting friends and relatives, pilgrimage, medical tourism, and voluntary humanitarian and healthcare work may contribute to increasing risk for infectious diseases and cross-border spread [1] . On top of that, in the last 3 years, conflicts, poverty, and political instability in several countries produced a huge flow of migrants and refugees into Europe. Locally and internationally displaced people are temporarily settled in organized or random overcrowded camps. Until now, the most common infections reported in refugee populations have been skin infections, common viral respiratory syndromes, gastrointestinal syndromes, cases of inadequately treated tuberculosis, and outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases. However, concerns about emerging and re-emerging diseases in migrants and refugees include more severe diseases like viral hemorrhagic fevers, cholera, and severe respiratory syndromes. On the basis of the incubation periods, most infections concern transit and temporary settlement countries, whereas malaria, tuberculosis, HIV, and hepatitis B and C may also emerge in final destination countries. Migrants and refugees are prone to endemic infections in the transit countries, including vector-borne diseases [2, 3] .",

It is the second most commonly diagnosed cause of fever after malaria in the returned travelers from low-and middle-income countries. Its primary vector is Aedes aegypti, but its secondary vector Aedes albopictus has a considerable adaptability to temperate climates and constitutes a threat for European countries. Local transmission was reported in France and Croatia in 2010; an outbreak on Madeira in 2012 caused travel-related cases in mainland Portugal and other countries. The disease is generally non-fatal, but persons previously exposed to a different serotype of the virus who develop dengue hemorrhagic fever present with substantial mortality; severe dengue is a leading cause of death among children in some Asian and Latin American countries [4] .",
