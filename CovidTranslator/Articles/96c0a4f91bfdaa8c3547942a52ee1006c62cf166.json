General interest flourished after a series of events in the 1990s and early 2000s. In 1992, a report by Russian General Kuntsevich followed by Boris Yelstin's decree in April of that year to end all offensive biological weapons programs revealed that the former Soviet Union had an extensive biowarfare program and that facilities and expertise still existed which would enable Russia to unleash deadly pathogens on the world [8] . In 1996 when Shoko Asahara, the spiritual leader of a Japanese religious cult, was arraigned, the magnitude of the organization's attempts to deploy anthrax in 1993 was exposed [9] . In October 2001, the United States was transfixed by the first bioterrorism attacks on its own soil: envelopes containing Bacillus anthracis spores were sent through the mail to targets ranging from media companies to government officials [10] . Five people died and thousands were treated with prophylactic antibiotics. The attacks and other attempted and planned attacks, along with widely publicized outbreaks such as West Nile Virus in 1999 [11] and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 [12] , brought the topic of infectious disease to the forefront. In addition, more incessant threats such as influenza and lower respiratory infections continue to kill and cause economic harm through lost productivity and hospitalizations. Furthermore, zoonotic diseases such as salmonella and listeria, which represent more than two-thirds of emerging and re-emerging diseases [13] , raise the visibility of the economic and human and animal health issues caused by pathogens. In April 2015, the Sabra Dipping Company voluntarily recalled about 30,000 cases of hummus potentially contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes. At the same time, Blue Bell recalled nearly 30 products also similarly contaminated. While there were no known casualties as a result of the Sabra contamination, authorities in Kansas and Texas reported that three deaths in each state might be attributed to the Blue Bell incident [14] .",

One organism alone, Clostridium difficile, is estimated to cost the United States between $1 and $3 billion per year [18] , with its primary impact on American children [19] . Initially identified in the early 1900s as a commensal organism in the digestive tract, C. difficile infection (CDI) has only been recognized as a significant threat to pediatric health over the last decade [19] . The threat to both children and adults is global. Infections since 2003 have become more common, more acute, less treatable by standard therapy, and more likely to reoccur [20] . Initially, the C. difficile infections were associated with the use of the antibiotic clindamycin, but fluoroquinolones and cephalosporins are currently the more likely cause of disturbed gut microbiota, which increasingly lead to colonization with ribotype 027, a severe variant of C. difficile [20] .",

These include infections resulting from changes or evolution of existing organisms and changes in the geographic distribution of an organism or populations affected by the organisms.

These issues have led to a reduction in the efficacy and number of responses available to physicians and their patients. The biological processes that lead to resistance are extremely complicated and not fully understood, resulting in sometimes limited progress in the control and treatment of resistant microorganisms and the diseases they cause [41] despite recognition of the problem nearly a century ago. Davies and Davies [41] compiled a list of \"suberbugs,\" which have increased pathogenicity and are more impervious to treatment. Their list includes the following: Multidrug-resistant (MDR) M. tuberculosis; nosocomial (hospital-linked) infections with Acinetobacter baumannii, Burkholderia cepacia, Campylobacter jejuni, Citrobacter freundii, Clostridium difficile, Enterobacter spp., Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella spp., Serratia spp., Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Their list does not include the New Delhi Metallo-beta-lactamase-1 (NDM-1) resistant strains discussed below. As the authors point out, in addition to the direct human toll, treatment is often more costly [42] when resistant organisms are involved. In fact, the issue has become so acute that new terms have developed over the past decades: microorganisms that are pan-drug resistant (PDR) or extremely drug resistant (XDR).",

In many organisms, such as enteric bacteria which are acquired both in community and hospital settings, resistance (often to \u03b2-lactam antibiotics in this case) spreads through horizontal gene transfer on plasmids; however, there have been no documented cases of this in tuberculosis, where all resistance occurs by spontaneous mutation [40] .

These studies included nearly 4000 patients, a third of whom were infected with methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Mortality was significantly lower in the group infected with susceptible bacteria. In another study, Cosgrove's group found that MRSA bacteremia also increased median length of hospital stay by almost 30 % and not surprisingly (given the longer stay), increased hospital charges from an average of $19,212 to $26,424 [52] . A prospective study found similar results in hemodialysis patients at the Duke University Hospital [53] as did a study on orthopedic patients [54] . Vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) [55] and Enterobacter species resistant to third generation cephalosporins [56] showed a similar trend; however, penicillin-and cephalosporin-resistant Streptococcus pneumonia results were dissimilar, and the authors surmised that this might be due to the specific use of vancomycin [51] . Chemicals in daily use may also change microorganism susceptibility to antimicrobial agents. For instance, it has been regularly demonstrated in the laboratory that resistance to triclosan, an antimicrobial agent used in many household products including hand sanitizer, and crossresistance to antimicrobials increases with use of triclosan containing products; however these results have not yet been observed in the community. Based on the available evidence, the risk of potential antimicrobial resistance outweighs the benefit of widespread triclosan use in antimicrobial soaps [57] .",

In part because of the United States hard line on drug use, United States incarceration rates are the highest in the world with minorities accounting for a disproportionate percent of the prison population. Incarceration rates disrupt community and sexual relationships and compound poverty issues, amplifying the exposure of communities and individuals to HIV infection and other infections [59] . In a second example, methamphetamine use has been shown to affect a person's judgment and may lead to unsafe behaviors such as reduced condom use, multiple partners, and increased drug injection. Methamphetamines also increase physical susceptibility because their use dries mucosa intensifying chafing and abrasions, which, in turn, allow microorganisms to enter the body during sexual and other activity [58, 60] .",

Without additional treatment, this water is commonly used on crops; humans and animals then consume the products, and serious outbreaks have occurred that are difficult to treat because the microorganisms do not respond to commonly used antibiotics [63] [64] [65] [66] . Pruden et al. [66] found concerning levels of ARGs in Colorado (United States) dairy lagoon water, irrigation ditch water, river sediments, treated drinking water, and recycled wastewater. Ramsden et al. [67] similarly found antibacterial resistance in municipal wastewater treatment plants. Zuccato et al. [68] discovered that the concentrations of atenolol, bezafibrate, clofibric acid, cyclophosphamide, diazepam, erythromycin, furosemide, lincomycin, oleandomycin, ranitidine, salbutamol, spiramycin, and tylosin were in the nanogram per liter range in river or drinking water or river sediments in several sites in Italy. Munir et al. [69] examined the presence of antibiotic-resistant genes and bacteria in several types of wastewater effluents in Michigan and found that advanced water treatment systems such as membrane bioreactors were significantly more effective than conventional wastewater treatment at removing the tetracycline-resistant gene tetO and sulfonamide-resistant gene (Sul-I) as well as tetracycline and sulfonamide-resistant bacteria. Anaerobic digestion and lime stabilization treatment of wastewater was more effective than the conventional dewatering and gravity thickening methods for removing antibiotic-resistant genes and bacteria [69] . Burch et al. [70] were able to significantly reduce the concentrations of the ARGs tet(A), tet(W), and erm(B) using conventional wastewater treatment (aerobic); however, removal of intI1 required batch treatment, while the others required relatively long-term semi-continuous treatment. Tet(x) increased in concentration.",

            "text": "According to the World Bank, nearly 70 million travelers visited the United States and approximately one billion people traveled globally in 2012 [71] . The incidence of tuberculosis in the United States is largely due to foreign visitors and citizens and residents born in other countries [23] . Another, travel related resistance threat emerged in the United States in 2010 when three patients were reported to have the gene for New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase (NDM-1), an enzyme that destroys beta-lactam antibiotics including commonly used penicillins, cephalosporins, and carbapenems. The first case was reported in India in 2009 [72] , and to date, India and Pakistan have reported the most instances of NDM-1, but the gene is spreading globally, and cases have now been detected in many countries, including Great Britain, Canada, Sweden, Australia, Japan, and the United States. Antibiotics are widely used in India and some researchers [73] have demonstrated that overuse of carbapenems led to the development of NDM-1 [71] . Research also points to medical tourism as a cause [74] [75] [76] [77] . NDM-1 is a newly identified problem, only recognized since about December 2009 in the medical literature, but it is only one example of diseases transmitted through medical tourism which is defined as travel to a country to get medical care that is not available or is more expensive in one's own country. Precise data on the economic value and the number of patients seeking medical procedures are not easily available. In 2009, Smith et al. [75] estimated that approximately four million patients crossed borders seeking treatment. In 2011, guidelines to unify definitions of medical tourism and methodologies for reporting its extent were published and accuracy of the types and amounts of medical tourism may improve in the near future [76] . A greater potential threat is related to the increasing travel of immunocompromised patients. Lortholary et al. [77] illuminated the fact that as more and more people are living with HIV, having organ transplants, using immunodilators, or suffering from diabetes, more individuals are infected when traveling. The authors suggested preparations and responses to prevent severe illnesses when traveling.",

The FDA introduced new regulations for clinical trials at the beginning of the twenty-first century, which led to a cooling of antimicrobial development in the pharmaceutical industry [80] . First, the newly required approach doubled the cost of phase III clinical trials, already a substantial barrier for development. In phase III, it is expected that testing will include pairs of relatively large (usually >750 total subjects per study) groups of people conducted for the selected pathogen at the relevant body location(s). This has become challenging as new antibiotics focus on particular pathogens including resistant pathogens, making it difficult to enroll large numbers of patients [81] . In part because of the cost of the new regulations, Eli Lilly, Bristol-Myer Squib, Glaxo SmithKline, Proctor and Gamble, Roche, and Wyeth left the development business [7, 79] . In addition, while the amount of antibiotics prescribed has continued to grow, the market value has not changed and was estimated at $32 billion in 2010 [79] as compared to a $19.7 billion market in 2012 for statins alone [82] . Companies are getting out of the market because the regulatory burden is high, antimicrobials are typically used for short periods of time, public pressure is building to lower use, and the medicines are often subject to price controls outside of the United States [79, 83] .",

At the outset, 70 % of the patients died of the infection, and after the medical staff developed enhanced protocols, the death rate was only reduced to 40 %. Scientists isolated a hantavirus [87] , and later, researchers determined that an unusually wet spring led to increased rodent carrier density which in turn impacted human infection rates; however, these factors alone are not enough to explain persistent hantavirus infection in the southwestern United States [88] . Ecosystem changes and human interactions with the environment may increase the transmission of infectious disease [89] .

Zoonotic diseases kill more than two million people per year and transmission occurs from both wild and domesticated animals [92] . Halsby et al. [93] reviewed the English literature with respect to infectious diseases caused by pet store animals and found 57 discussions of infections related to pet shops. The most commonly observed diseases were Salmonellosis and psittacosis: other diseases such as tularemia were also identified. The human animal interaction has impacted civilization throughout history. According to Daszak et al. [94] , \"Parallels between human and wildlife emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) extend to early human colonization of the globe and the dissemination of exotic pathogens. In the same way that Spanish conquistadors introduced smallpox and measles to the Americas, the movement of domestic and other animals during colonization introduced their own suite of pathogens. The African rinderpest panzootic of the late 1880s and 1890s is a paradigm for the introduction, spread, and impact of virulent exotic pathogens on wildlife populations. This highly pathogenic morbillivirus disease, enzootic to Asia, was introduced into Africa in 1889. The panzootic front traveled 5000 km in 10 years, reaching the Cape of Good Hope by 1897, extirpating more than 90 % of Kenya's buffalo population and causing secondary effects on predator populations and local extinctions of the tsetse fly.\" More recently, bovine tuberculosis, while responsible for only 22 cases of human tuberculosis in the UK, prompted the slaughter of tens of thousands of cattle in the first decade of the twenty-first century [95] . In 2015, throughout the United States, domestic poultry and wild birds have been suffering from a highly pathogenic strain of avian influenza (HPAI) H5 [96] . Through June 17, 2015, more than 48 million birds were put to death. The cost of the government response is tagged at $500 million primarily to fund the work of 3400 staffers and contractors [97] . On the commercial side, analysts used economic models and found that for a million dollars in direct losses there are $1.8 million in overall economic losses. In mid-May direct losses in poultry production were estimated at $113 million leading to overall losses of more than $300 million [98] . Transmission to humans in the United States has not been detected, although related viruses have caused serious illness and death around the world [97] .",

Similarly in 1950, 5796 cases of diphtheria were reported resulting in 410 deaths. In 2011, there were no reported cases of diphtheria [103] . Up to two % of parents in the United States refuse vaccination completely for their children with up to 19 % more who are cautious or elect to delay vaccination [103] . The reduction in vaccination coverage is typically attributed to the lack of perceived threat due to the success of vaccination, combined with false medical research and media reporting [103] .",

The travel of both goods and people during World War II set the stage for the spread of dengue fever. In the post war era with unparalleled urban growth and travel, serious epidemics occurred more frequently.

Recent research such as that performed by Ling et al. [110] found new ways to identify antibiotics [111] in the environment and companies are beginning to invest again. Under the direction of Dr. Kim Lewis, Ling and colleagues identified teixobactin. To do this, the team used the novel screening method to examine 10,000 strains. In both in vitro and in vivo tests, teixobactin was demonstrated to be operative, without major side effects, against the organisms that cause common illnesses such as pneumonia, tuberculosis, and staph infection, diseases which sicken more one million Americans yearly. While teixobactin was effective against diseases of public health concern, it was ineffective against gram-negative bacteria. Teixobactin binds on several targets triggering cell wall break down. The ability to bind on multiple sites lessens the chance of early Teixobactin resistance. In addition to developing the new antibiotic, the researchers commercialized the screening technology, which can examine organisms that cannot typically be cultured in the lab [111] . Researchers are also developing techniques to enhance the impact of probiotics in fighting infections and other diseases such as cancer [112] .",

In 1900, the average lifespan in the United States was 46.3 for men and 48.3 for women, and one of the predominant causes of death was infectious disease. By the end of the century, lifespan had increased to 73.8 for men and 79.5 for women [113] . In 1848, infectious diseases accounted for more than half of all deaths: in 1971, this percentage was reduced tenfold [114] . The increases in life expectancy have been distributed across the world, although some areas have benefitted more than others from breakthroughs in sanitation, nutrition, and medical advances. One of the primary contributors to the reduction in the death rate was the reduction of infant deaths due to infectious diseases. Prior to the mid-1930s, infectious disease played the predominant role in infant mortality with half of the 100 (out of 1000) infant deaths due to pathogens [115, 116] . By 2014, the United States infant mortality rate had decreased to 6.1 per 1000 live births [117] . Also in the United States, in the midnineteenth century, foodborne and waterborne diseases such as typhoid, cholera, and dysentery resulted in 214 deaths per 100,000. These diseases were eliminated in the United States by the early 1970s [114] . One noteworthy exception to the steady progress in increased life expectancy is due to an infectious disease: HIV/AIDS decreased life expectancy dramatically in parts of Africa over the past 30 years [118] .",

Even before there was prevalent proof that bacteria could quickly evolve to thwart antibiotics, evidence indicates that bacteria exhibit resistance in nature even without human pressure [122] ; however, mechanisms of resistance impacting disease treatment were first noticed in the late 1930s with regards to the use of sulfonamides [41] . Due to overuse, underuse, and incorrect disposal, antibiotic resistance has become a worldwide threat to public health [41] .

In President Obama's September 2014 Executive Order [133] , he directed the \"National Security Council staff, in collaboration with the Office of Science and Technology Policy, the Domestic Policy Council, and the Office of Management and Budget to coordinate the development and implementation of Federal Government policies to combat antibiotic-resistant bacteria [133] .\" The President also created both a Task Force and an Advisory Council; however, he did not put a single individual in charge. Identifying and developing a central, qualified, trusted person in charge of coordinating the investments in research, infrastructure and outreach; policies to incentivize behaviors to improve medicine development, infection control in medical and community settings; and communicate risks and responses in a directed and trusted manner at the federal government level, will enhance accountability and the likelihood of success. During times of low or chronic threat (e.g., flu season), the named person can develop a trusted relationship with the public, the medical and public health communities, the pharmaceutical industry, the defense department, international peers, and others involved in infectious disease response and defense. This is particularly difficult in diverse countries with divided political parties. A history of purposeful and innocent ethical lapses and scientific mistakes have contributed to a lack of trust such as the inaccurate flu vaccine in the 2014-2015 season and the confusing messages from the Texas hospital and the CDC on Ebola in 2015. When a man traveled from Africa and came down with a high fever and other symptoms, he was sent home by the hospital with antibiotics for two days [134]: Ebola was not well diagnosed in Texas.",

Fauci is a natural leader for the US infectious disease/public health message, \"He is someone who is really trusted by all the different organizations and people surrounding the AIDS challenge, ranging from the scientific community, the academic community and the activist community,\" according to Louis Sullivan, M.D., secretary of Health and Human Services during the first Bush administration and president emeritus of Morehouse School of Medicine in Atlanta. \"I don't know of anyone as broadly accepted by all those disparate groups [136] .\" The head of the CDC can also be a valuable spokesperson, but the CDC may have lost some of the public's trust during the Ebola crisis [137] . To centralize response, President Obama appointed Rob Klain as the Ebola Coordinator. He was neither a doctor nor a scientist, and he left the job after six months, while Ebola was still spreading in Africa. While additional capability was developed at medical centers in the United States under Klain's tenure, there were few noticeable signs of progress; he was not open to the media [138] ; and likely as a result, was not embraced by the public.

Mechanisms for early reporting would avoid punishment such as travel bans for acknowledgement of dangerous infectious diseases within countries' borders. In addition, leaders in the United States would work to develop trusted relationships with peers in other countries. With more US foreign aid directed towards building public health infrastructure, the funds would have the primary impact of bolstering response and reducing transmission and casualties from infectious diseases within a country and secondary impacts of stabilizing societies (studies have shown that countries with healthy populations are more stable [141] ).

For instance, adoption of advanced wastewater treatment systems can reduce exposure to antibiotics and ARGs. This can be accomplished by tax incentives and partial payment by the federal government when wastewater treatment systems are replaced and advanced systems are used. In 2014, $109 billion federal dollars were spent on water utilities (water supply or treatment) accounting for approximately one quarter of public infrastructure spending [143] . State and local governments spent $208 billion for the operation and maintenance of infrastructure double the spending on capital improvements ($112 billion). \"Although state and local governments rely primarily on their own revenues to purchase capital, federal grants also are an important source of funds. Since 1960, federal grants have accounted for one-third or more of the capital spending on infrastructure by states and localities. That share was considerably larger from the mid-1970s through the mid-1980s as a result of federal support for water utilities after passage of the Clean Water Act in 1972 [143] .\" A renewal of this investment, with a focus on improving water treatment to remove antibiotics, ARGs and other pollutants and destroying resistant organisms, would expand the positive results. Regulations limiting the concentrations of antibiotics and ARGs in treated municipal water, if enacted, in concert with meaningful financial penalties for those violating these standards, may significantly reduce the risk of population exposure. This can be difficult because the source of the contamination is often hard to identify. Current antiviral drugs have several disadvantages including their specificity, toxicity and expense. Researchers at the Charles Draper Stark Laboratories developed DRACO (Double-stranded RNA Activated Caspase Oligomerizer). In lab-grown cells, DRACO killed 15 different viruses, including ones that cause the common cold, influenza, polio and dengue fever with minimal effects on healthy cells [144] ; however, there is still much work to be done before this drug can be FDA approved and used by the general public. Vectored vaccines use a live-vaccine made with a partial pathogen. They have been developed against SARS-CoV and demonstrated in mice, but the safety of vesicular stomatitis virus vaccine (VSV) in humans requires further research. Newcastle disease virus, a host range-restricted virus, has been developed as a vaccine vector for intranasal immunization against emerging pathogens [145] .",

This requires both a long-term investment as well as an acute response capability. President Obama recognized both of these in the fall of 2014. First on September 24, 2014 at the Global Health Summit, President Obama discussed long-term capacity building: \"We, collectively, have not invested adequately in the public health capacity of developing countries.\" \"This speaks to a central question of our global age-whether we will solve our problems together, in a spirit of mutual interest and mutual respect, or whether we descend into the destructive rivalries of the past. When nations find common ground, not simply based on power, but on principle, then we can make enormous progress. [147] \" A few weeks later, President Obama discussed the acute strategic needs, \"As I have said from the start of this [Ebola] outbreak, I consider this a top national security priority. This is not a matter of charity-although obviously the humanitarian toll in countries that are affected in West Africa is extraordinarily significant. This is an issue about our safety [148] .\" The President also signed the Executive Order on Combating Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria in September of 2014 [133] .",

            "text": "Recent outbreaks of diseases thought banished from the United States demonstrate the need for full vaccination. Several communities resist vaccination, and incentives to vaccinate will increase population safety and prevent those who cannot be vaccinated from coming down with vaccinepreventable diseases. One common incentive is the requirement to be vaccinated to enter public school. Waivers can be sought, but to boost the vaccination rates, state and local governments can reduce the numbers of exemptions provided. Mississippi has already followed this course, and it has the highest vaccination rates in the United States. Other potential policies include requiring exemption forms to be filed yearly; requiring parents to complete an education component; and requiring private as well as public school children to be vaccinated [149] . Several states are implementing one or more related measures. While only four states do not recognize a religious exemption from vaccinations, 33 states do not allow exemptions for personal reasons (all states allow exemptions for medical reasons). In part due to the 2015 measles outbreak, on July 1 of 2016 California will eliminate all non-medical vaccine exemptions. Pennsylvania is also pondering eliminating personal exemptions. Colorado has made the exemption process more burdensome [150] . Dina Fine Maron of Scientific American [151] suggested the following common sense approach: improved education and communication, sustain and enhance immunization outreach, maintain vigilance and rapidly contain imported infections. Anthony Fauci proposed partnerships, among government, industry, and academia to develop additional timely solutions to the threat of new and resurgent infectious diseases [152] . One example of a successful academia-industry partnership is the response to the HIV/AIDS epidemic. AIDS was first recognized in the early 1980s and the death rate steadily increased through the mid-1990s when it was recognized as a worldwide epidemic. Research at and collaboration among academic institutions (including Wayne State University) and investment by the public and private sectors (Burroughs Wellcome which later became GlaxoSmithKline) led to the development of the antiretroviral treatments used today. The partnerships transformed a deadly infection into a principally chronic disease within two decades [153] [154] [155] . Partnerships now work to ensure prevention, testing, distribution of anti-HIV/AIDS drugs and treatment worldwide.",

According to the FDA Guidance [156] , a non-inferiority (NI) study is used to demonstrate that the degree of inferiority of the drug being tested as compared to the control (an already approved drug) is less than the noninferiority margin. Recently, to facilitate the development of biopharmaceuticals, a cross-industry group, including members from Astra Zeneca, University of Texas Medical School Houston and smaller pharmaceutical companies, proposed a tiered evidence-based regulatory approach. In this approach Tier A is the typical large Phase IIl approach and Tier D is equivalent to the Animal Rule, which states that \"for drugs developed to ameliorate or prevent serious or life threatening conditions caused by exposure to lethal or permanently disabling toxic substances, when human efficacy studies are not ethical and field trials are not feasible, FDA may grant marketing approval based on adequate and well-controlled animal efficacy studies when the results of those studies establish that the drug is reasonably likely to produce clinical benefit in humans [157] .\" Tiers B and C rely heavily on preclinical data and combined animal and human pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) data fully integrated into a limited clinical program [158] .",

Handwashing with soap from dispensers with sealed refills instead of open refillable dispensers can lower the risk of infection [159] and is just one example of a common sense technique to prevent the spread of many bacterial infections. Another common sense response is increased monitoring. Cryptosporidium parvum did not appear to pose a risk until 400,000 people became ill, and approximately 100 people died of cryptosporidiosis in Milwaukee's water service area in 1993. Today, regulators and public health scientists are trying to identify microbes that pose a similar risk in the future. If these microbial contaminants occur in raw water supplies, they may need monitoring and treatment prior to these waters entering the potable water distribution system. The Contaminant Candidate List (CCL) developed by the United States Environmental Protection Agency outlines a series of biological contaminants of concern that are not currently regulated but may pose a threat. Should these contaminants move from the CCL to a regulatory framework, water supply utilities will incur added monitoring and testing of their water supply sources, and potentially added monitoring and treatment costs in their operations, but safety will likely increase as a result of these expenditures.",

While the virus itself was isolated from the Zika Forest in Uganda in the first half of the Twentieth Century, it did not begin to take a serious human toll until 2015 when it traveled from the Pacific Islands to Brazil [160] : it is now considered a global threat, with its vector, the Aedes species mosquito living on all continents [161] . There have been more than one million cases in Brazil, and researchers noticed a surge in fetal microcephaly, a small head size for gestational age and sex indicating issues with brain growth, in Zika-prone locations [160] . It is now widely accepted that maternal infection with Zika can lead to serious consequences for a fetus. For most infected, the effects will be minimal, but in addition to the fetal effects Guillain-Barre increases have been associated with Zika infections. Reliable diagnosis is not yet widely available, but reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing of serum in the first seven days after symptom onset or IgM-capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (MAC-ELISA) analysis of samples are the most promising methods [158] . Animal models for further research, therapeutics and vaccines are required [160] to stop the negative impacts of the disease since the vector is widespread and difficult if not impossible to eradicate.",

This funding falls short of the $1.9 billion in emergency money President Obama initially requested, and the shortfall is likely to delay a complete, effective response.

It took nearly 100 years to develop a vaccine and implement widespread vaccination so that in 1994 polio was eradicated in the western hemisphere. Polio is now endemic in only three countries: Afghanistan, Nigeria, and Pakistan. More recently effective prevention and treatment options for HIV/AIDs did not take hold for decades. This timeline is now significantly reduced. Research is already underway on vaccines for Zika as well as prevention through vector control.
