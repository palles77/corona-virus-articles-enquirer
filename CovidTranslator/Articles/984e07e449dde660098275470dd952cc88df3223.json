The sensitivity of 34 the rS-based ELISA for IgM detection was significantly higher than that of the 35 rN-based ELISA. We observed an increase in the positive rate for IgM and IgG with 36 an increasing number of days post-disease onset (d.p.o.), but the positive rate of IgM 37 dropped after 35 d.p.o. The positive rate of rN-based and rS-based IgM and IgG 38 ELISAs was less than 60% during the early stage of the illness 0-10 d.p.o., and that of 39 IgM and IgG was obviously increased after 10 d.p.o.",

As of March 1, 2020, 49 more than 80,000 laboratory-confirmed cases have been reported in China (5), and the 50 disease has spread over 58 countries in Asia, Australia, Europe, and North America identified it as a Beta coronavirus and showed it is closely related (with 96% identity) 56 to Bat CoV RaTG13, but distinct from SARS-CoV (6). SARS-CoV-2 has a 57 receptor-binding domain (RBD) structure similar to that of SARS-CoV. Functionally 58 important ORFs (ORF1a and ORF1b) and major structural proteins, including the 59 spick (S), membrane (M), envelope (E), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins, are also well 60 annotated (7). According to previous reports, the M and E proteins are necessary for 61 virus assembly (8, 9) . The S protein is important for attachment to host cells, where 62 the RBD of S protein mediates the interaction with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 63 (ACE2) (6). The S protein is located on the surface of the viral particles and has been 64 reported to be highly immunogenic (10). The N protein is one of the major structural 65 proteins of the virus and is involved in the transcription and replication of viral RNA, 66 packaging of the encapsidated genome into virions (11, 12) , and interference with cell 67 .

Specifically, we evaluated IgM and IgG production and their diagnostic 224 value. rN-and rS-based ELISAs were used to detect IgM and IgG in serum samples 225 of confirmed COVID-19 patients. The results revealed that the rS-based ELISA is 226 more sensitive than the rN-based one in the detection of IgM antibodies (Fig. 1) . We 227 speculate that this difference is due to the relatively high sensitivity and early 228 response to the S antigen compared to the N antigen in patients with COVID-19.

Moreover, in many coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV, the N protein has high immunogenic activity and is abundantly expressed during infection (14-16). Both S and N proteins may be potential antigens for serodiagnosis of COVID-19, just as many diagnostic methods have been developed for diagnosing SARS based on S and/or N proteins (10, 14-17).Currently, diagnosis of COVID-19 is confirmed by RNA tests with real-time73 (RT)-PCR or next-generation sequencing. Studies have shown that SARS-CoV-2 mainly infects the lower respiratory tract, and that viral RNA can be detected from nasal and pharyngeal swabs and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) (3, 6, 18). However, the collection of the lower respiratory samples (especially BAL) requires both a suction device and a skilled operator. A previous study showed that except for BAL, the sputum from confirmed patients possessed the highest positive rate, ranging from 74.4% to 88.9%. The positive rate of nasal swabs ranged from 53.6% to 73.3%, and throat swabs collected \uf0b38 days post-disease onset (d.p.o.) had a low positive rate, especially in samples from mild cases (19).
