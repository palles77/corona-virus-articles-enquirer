The disease was characterized by the lack of response to conventional antibiotic therapy and the occurrence of clusters of cases within a family or healthcare setting. In retrospect, these were the first known cases of the disease that was later to be called severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Through January, the numbers of cases of this unusual 'atypical pneumonia' continued to increase with examples of 'super-spreading incidents' that were to punctuate the course of the subsequent SARS epidemic. Between 16 November and 9 February, 305 cases were identified, one-third of them in healthcare workers ( Table 1) .",

He had treated patients with 'atypical pneumonia' in Guangzhou and had been ill himself since 15 February. His 1-day stay on the ninth floor at this hotel led to the infection of at least 17 other guests or visitors, some of whom traveled on to Hanoi, Toronto, Vancouver, Singapore, USA, Philippines, Guangzhou, and Australia. Five of these secondary cases initiated clusters of infection in Hanoi, Singapore, Toronto and two clusters of infection within Hong Kong. This was the most significant single event in the global spread of SARS, and arguably the most dramatic known event in the global spread of any infectious disease. However, because the secondary cases had largely dispersed outside of Hong Kong, this cluster of cases remained 'invisible' until the epidemiological linkages were reconstructed in mid-March.",

Coronaviruses are classified on genetic and antigenic characteristics into three groups and SARS CoV is presently regarded as a group 2b coronavirus. It is an enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus with a genome size of approx 29.7 kbp. The virus particle is approximately 100-160 nm in diameter with a distinctive corona of petal-shaped spikes on the surface which is comprised of the spike glycoprotein (S). The S protein is in a trimeric form on the viral surface. It has an N-terminal variable subdomain (S1) which contains the motifs responsible for receptor binding. A more conserved subdomain (S2), which contains heptad repeats and a coiled-coil structure, is important in the membrane fusion process. The S1-S2 subdomains remain in a noncleaved form in the intact SARS CoV virion and cleavage is believed to occur within the endocytic vesicle during the viral entry process. The envelope also contains a transmembrane glycoprotein M and in much smaller amounts, an envelope (E) protein. The M protein is a triple-spanning membrane protein and has a key role in coronavirus assembly. The hemagglutinin-esterase (HE) glycoprotein, found in some group 2 coronaviruses, is absent in SARS CoV. The nucleocapsid protein (N) interacts with the viral genomic RNA to form the viral nucleocapsid. Viral replication complexes are believed to be localized within double-membraned vesicles or autophagosomes.",

            "text": "The genome of SARS CoV is that of a typical coronavirus. The viral genomic RNA has at least 14 open reading frames (ORFs) (Figure 1 ). The genome codes for 16 nonstructural proteins (nsp1-16), 5 structural proteins, and 7 accessory proteins. The genomic RNA encoding the replicase gene functions as mRNA to generate polyproteins 1a and 1ab. The translation of ORF1b is directed by a -1 ribosomal frameshift (RFS) signal that contains a nucleotide slippery sequence (5 0 -UUUAAAC-3 0 ) and an RNA pseudoknot. By contrast, the structural and accessory proteins are products derived from subgenomic RNA (sgRNA 2-9) which are synthesized by discontinuous RNA transcription. Translated products from ORF2 (S), ORF4 (E), ORF5 (M), and ORF9a (N) are viral structural proteins as described above. Recently, it was reported that the protein encoded by the ORF3a, which is able to interact with S and contains ion channel activity, is also a structural protein. However, the full function of this protein is yet to be determined. The polyproteins 1a and 1ab generated from the replicase gene are cleaved by a papain-like proteinase (part of nsp3) and a 3C-like proteinase (nsp5) to generate 16 nonstructural proteins (Figure 1(b) ). Nsp12 is a primerdependent RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), whereas nsp8 is a noncanonical RdRp (nsp8) synthesizing primers utilized by nsp12. In addition, eight nsp7 and eight nsp8 subunits are able to form a hexadecamer with a hollow, cylinder-like structure. RNA-binding studies and the overall architecture of this nsp7-nsp8 complex suggest that it might encircle RNA and confer processivity of nsp12. The nsp9 is a single-stranded RNA-binding protein and is able to interact with nsp8. The nsp13 is a helicase and unwinds duplex RNA (and DNA) in a 5 0 -to-3 0 direction. The nsp3, nsp14, nsp15, and nsp16 have been shown to have ADP-ribose 1 0 -phosphatase, 5 0 -to-3 0 exonuclease, endoribonuclease, and 2 0 -O-ribose methyltransferase activities, respectively. These four proteins are distantly related to cellular enzymes involved in RNA metabolism. These observations may be relevant to viral RNA processing. The nsp10 contains two zinc finger motifs and is suggested to be a regulator of vRNA synthesis. The biological functions of nsp1, nsp2, nsp4, nsp6, and nsp11 are largely unknown. The nsp1 is reported to induce chemokine dysregulation and host mRNA degradation. The nsp2 is dispensable for virus replication. The nsp4 and nsp6 each contain a putative transmembrane domain.",

Genetically modified recombinant viruses without these accessory ORFs have been shown to be replication competent in cell cultures, indicating that the accessory ORFs may not be essential for virus replication in vitro. However, recombinant viruses with deletions in these regions are attenuated, suggesting that these proteins might have functions that are important for viral replication and pathogenesis in vivo. The accessory proteins from ORF3b and ORF7a induce apoptosis in transfected cells. There is also evidence suggesting that the 7a protein is incorporated into virions. The protein encoded in ORF6 has been shown to inhibit the nuclear import of STAT-1 and function as an interferon antagonist in infected cells. These properties might relate to virus virulence. Interestingly, comparative sequence analysis of SARS CoV isolated from palm civets (see below) and humans showed that all animal isolates contained a 29-nucleotide (nt) sequence which is absent from most human isolates obtained in the later phase of the SARS outbreak. As a result, the ORF8 in these human SARS CoVs encodes 8a and 8b proteins, whereas the corresponding ORF in the animal isolates encodes a single protein, known as the 8ab protein. These proteins from the animal and human ORF8 have differential binding affinities to various SARS CoV structural proteins. Furthermore, the expression of E can be downregulated by 8b but not 8a or 8ab in infected cells. These observations may suggest that the 29-nt deletion might modulate the replication or pathogenesis of the human SARS CoV. The crystal structure of the 9b protein suggests that it might be a lipid binding protein but its function is yet to be identified. Overall, these accessory proteins may play roles in viral replication and pathogenesis.",

            "text": "Until the end of January 2003, 39% of patients with SARS in Guangdong had handled, killed, or sold wild animals or prepared and served them as food. However, such risk factors were found in only 2-10% of cases from February to April 2003 when the virus had adapted to efficient human-to-human transmission. Thus, the early epidemiological evidence pointed to the live game animal trade as a potential source of the SARS CoV. SARS-like coronaviruses were identified in a number of small mammalian species sold in the live game animal markets in Guangdong, including the palm civet (Paguma larvata), raccoon dog (Nyctereutes procyonides), and the Chinese ferret badger (Melogale moschata). A high proportion of individuals working in these markets were observed to have developed antibodies to SARS CoV, although none of them had a history of the disease. Viruses isolated from the re-emergent SARS cases in Guangdong in December 2003-January 2004 were more similar to those found in civets in these markets, rather than to viruses causing the global outbreak in early 2003. These observations strongly implicated the live game animal trade as the interface for interspecies transmission of a precursor animal SARS-like coronavirus to humans. SARS CoV can be shed for weeks in experimentally infected palm civets but many of the other species appear to clear the virus rapidly. While civets in live animal markets were often observed to be positive for SARS-like coronavirus RNA, civets tested in the farms that supply these markets and those caught in the wild rarely have evidence of infection. Thus, palm civets were believed not likely to be the natural reservoir of the precursor SARS CoV (see below). More recently, group 2b coronaviruses related to SARS CoV have been identified in Rhinolophus bats in Hong Kong and mainland China. Such bats are also sold live in these game animal markets. It is now believed that these or related bat coronaviruses may be the precursor from which SARS CoV originated (see below).",

Genetic and phylogenetic analysis indicates that the viruses associated with the early phase of the human SARS outbreak are more closely related to the viruses found in palm civets and other small mammals in the live game animal markets in Guangdong. The genomes of viruses in the early phase of the human outbreak in 2003 were observed to be under strong positive selective pressure, suggesting that the virus was rapidly adapting in a new host. Furthermore, virus in civets was also found to be under strong positive selective pressure, supporting the view that civets were not the natural host of the precursor SARS-like coronavirus. The search for the precursor of SARS CoV led to the discovery of a number of novel coronaviruses in bats which are related to group 1 and group 2 coronaviruses. Some of these bat coronaviruses are genetically related to SARS CoV (group 2b) and are likely to be the direct or indirect precursor of SARS CoV (see below).",

A few unconfirmed studies have also reported the detection of virus particles or viral RNA in multiple organs but these findings require independent confirmation.",

Viral RNA has been detected in respiratory specimens, feces, serum, and urine. Specimens from the lower respiratory tract such as endotracheal aspirates have higher viral load than those from the upper respiratory tract and are better diagnostic clinical specimens. As viral load is low during the first 5 days of disease, a negative PCR result from specimens collected at this time does not exclude the diagnosis. Testing multiple specimens improves the detection rate of SARS. Virus culture on Vero E6 or FRhK-4 cells and viral antigen detection tests are much less sensitive than reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) for detecting the virus. While viral RNA remains detectable in the respiratory secretions and feces for many weeks after the onset of illness, specimens rarely yield a virus isolate after the third week of illness.",

Infection of epithelial cells, macrophages, and myeloid dendritic cells fails to induce a type 1 interferon response although other interferon response genes are activated. Viral proteins expressed from ORF3b, ORF6, and the N gene have interferon antagonist effects in vitro. In contrast, macrophages and dendritic cells respond to infection in vitro with strong chemokine responses, including those (e.g., CCL10) that are elevated in the serum of SARS patients, and macrophagechemoattractant chemokines (CCL2).

As none of the civet or bat SARS CoV has yet been successfully grown in vitro, the cross-reactive neutralizing antibody response has been studied using lentiviruses pseudotyped with CoV S protein from a civet virus (SZ3), a civet-like virus causing re-emergent SARS in humans in December 2003 (GD03), and from a human SARS CoV (Urbani-strain) isolated from the major human SARS outbreak in 2003. The viruses pseudotyped with human Urbani virus S protein were neutralized by antibodies to the civet SARS-like virus but pseudotypes with the civet-like S protein were not neutralized by antibodies to the human SARS CoV (Urbani). On the contrary, antibody to the Urbani virus appeared to enhance the infectivity of the GD03 and SZ3 pseudotyped viruses. These findings appear to reflect receptor usage of these viruses as it has been shown that GD03 and SZ3 bind poorly to human ACE-2 (see above).

Consequently, when human infection with the civet SARS-like CoV occurred in December 2003-January 2004, there was no human-tohuman transmission and clinical disease was mild. While SARS-like coronaviruses have been found in bats, they are genetically distinct to SARS CoV and the bat SARS-like CoV S protein appears unable to bind to human or civet ACE-2. Thus, it is likely that re-emergence of a virus capable of causing human disease from this source probably requires extensive adaptation in an intermediate host (e.g., small mammals such as civets).

It is therefore possible that, like Ebola, SARS may re-emerge at intervals in the future. However, a number of epidemiological characteristics of SARS (see above) should allow it to be contained by public health interventions, once the disease is diagnosed. Indeed, the chain of community transmission arising from a laboratory escape of SARS CoV in February 2004 was contained by such public health measures and community transmission was aborted. However, if the dynamics of transmission of a re-emergent virus are different, and particularly if transmission occurs earlier in the illness and there are more asymptomatic infections, the options for control and the ultimate consequences may be very different. It remains important, therefore, to understand better the ecological and viral factors that predispose to interspecies transmission and the emergence of animal viruses with efficient competence for transmission in humans. Attention should be directed toward the adaptation strategies and the ecological factors that are important in determining interspecies transmission, rather than focus on the disease itself (i.e., SARS). Efforts to understand better the molecular basis for interspecies transmission that led to the genesis of SARS CoV will help us to prepare better for the next emerging infectious disease challenge; whether this comes from SARS CoV, avian influenza H5N1, or a yet unknown virus.",
