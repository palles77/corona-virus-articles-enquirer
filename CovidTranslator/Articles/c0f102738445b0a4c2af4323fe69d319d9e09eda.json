The pathogenesis of SLE and the induced factors of active SLE are not completely clear, but it is generally considered that SLE is caused by both hereditary and environmental factors that ultimately lead to an abnormal immune response. Sunlight and ultraviolet (UV) rays have been considered to be the most important environmental factors in the induction of SLE. 1 Based on this, a high incidence of SLE should occur in summer and autumn when there is stronger sunlight and more intense UV rays. However, in clinical practice, we have found that more patients with SLE visit hospital at the end of autumn and at the end of winter, as well as at the beginning of winter and the beginning of spring, while in the summer and the autumn, less patients with SLE visit hospital. In order to confirm that high incidences of SLE should occur in summer and autumn when sunlight and UV rays are strong, we retrospectively analyzed the characteristics of seasonal distribution of active SLE and its correlation with meteorological factors in 640 patients, who live in the city of Zhanjiang, China and had active SLE between January 1997 and December 2006.",

However, there have been different reports regarding seasonal distribution of active SLE.

Our hospital is the largest hospital in the local area (Zhanjiang City, Guangdong Province, China) and is also the control center for rheumatic autoimmune disease. The majority of patients with SLE in Zhanjiang City attend the hospital for diagnosis and treatment. Patients with active SLE in this study reside in Zhanjiang City. According to the SLEDAI score system, SLEDAI ,5 was considered as mild SLE, 5-10 as moderate and .10 as severe. 13 Hormones and immunosuppressive agents are generally given when the SLEDAI is $6. 14 After administration of hormones and immunosuppressive agents, most patients still have moderate SLE (SLEDAI: 5-10) for a lengthy period. Although therapy is effective, SLEDAI fails to decrease to 0. To ensure patients had active SLE, only patients with a SLEDAI of $10 were included in this study. These patients, therefore, basically reflect the distribution of active SLE in Zhanjiang City.",

We also found that the relative ratio of patients with active SLE was significantly higher in winter than in other seasons. Zhanjiang City is located at east longitude 110.3\u02daand northern latitude 21.2\u02da, and has a subtropical climate regulated by the ocean. Based on collected meteorological data, the annual mean temperature is 23.2\u02daC. In July, the mean temperature is 29.1\u02daC, there is the most daylight and sunlight intensity is strongest. In January, the mean temperature is 16.6\u02daC, there is least daylight and sunlight intensity is weakest. In contrast with the traditional viewpoint that the highest incidence of SLE should occur when sunlight and UV rays are strong, our results show that the number of patients with active SLE is fewer in summer when UV rays are stronger, while there is a higher incidence in winter when UV rays are weaker. Our study failed to discover whether various lupus lesions have seasonal distribution; however, Schlesinger et al. 15 found that the incidence of membranous lupus nephritis increased in winter.",

In order to eliminate the influence of infection factors on seasonal distribution of active SLE, patients who had active SLE combined with an infection were excluded from the study. Therefore, it can be discounted that infection causes a high incidence of active SLE in the winter and a low incidence in the summer.",

Some scholars speculate that a high incidence of SLE in winter may be caused by UV accumulation after exposure to strong sunlight in summer. 11 Leone et al. 18 found that the level of serum anti-dsDNA is increased, while the levels of C3 and C4 are decreased in patients with SLE from August to January.
