Several members of this group of human and animal pathogens are shown to cross-react in one or more type of test, but one member, avian infectious bronchitis virus, was shown to be unrelated. Mouse hepatitis virus (MHVs) was found to be antigenieally related to a number of human types of coronavirus. Difficulties were encountered in the investigation of paired human sera in demonstrating the specificity of antibody rises, placing doubt on the values of some serological studies. The significance of these interrelationships is discussed in the light of other investigations.

The results of this are shown in Fig. 2 . It can be seen that, apart from the serum resulting from a normal infection with MHVs, the sera do not have a uniform response over the complement range of 2 to 1.25 units and show maxima and minima in their reactions. This variation in complement-fixing equivalence is reproducible in terms of the maxima and minima shown but not in the actual titres obtained, probably because of the difficulty in the exact determination of the dose of complement. At about 1.5 units of complement, most of the sera are showing their maximum reactivity. Using crude tissue culture fluids as antigens, very few volunteer convalescent sera showed detectable levels of complement fixation. Therefore tissue culture fluids were concentrated 10-to 20-fold by dialysis, but the resulting fluids were often anti-complementary. It was found that the anti-complementary activity was removed by filtration on \"Sephadex\" G-200 gel, as described in \"Materials and Methods\". Using these antigens, significant antibody rises to LP were found in 8 of 20 serum pairs taken from volunteers who had colds induced by the 229E or LP viruses. As with neutralizing antibody rises, infection with either of these viruses produced a rise in complement-fixing antibody to both. Of 18 serum pairs taken from volunteers infected with 229E or LP viruses, none had rising CF titres to 0C43, but 4 pairs showed rises to MHV3.",

It is interesting to note that very few of the heterologous lines produced showed reactions of identity with homolog-Antigenic Relationships a m o n g s t Coronaviruses the human coronaviruses were not neutralized by antiviral antisera to any greater degree when complement was added to the system. This contrasts with the neutralization of avian infectious bronchitis virus in which complement increases the neutralization index of some sera by up to three orders of magnitude (BERRY and ALMEIDA, 1968). This virus is also neutralized by anti-host cell antisera which in the presence of complement (unheated guinea-pig serum) produce 80 2~ holes in the virus envelope. These holes are also produced by heterotypic (rabbit) but not by homotypic (chicken) antisera. Anti-human antisera did not produce any significant neutralization of either the 229E or LP viruses and complement holes are produced in the envelope of 229 E virus by both homotypic and hcterotypic (human) antisera (ALM~IDA and BRADBVa~, unpublished data). This suggests that these two viruses differ somewhat in assembly from infectious bronchitis virus, though such differences have not been detected in electron-microscopic studies by other workers (B]~cKER et al., 1967) . This could be due, amongst other things, to differences in surface structure or in susceptibility to complement enzymes.",

            "text": "These studies have demonstrated that viruses which were grouped together as \"coronaviruses\" because they were morphologically similar show several serological similarities as well. A summary of the cross-reactions detected in these studies is shown in Table 6 . The cross-reactions found have not revealed common or group antigens as are found with the influenza viruses, but rather haphazard inter-relationships like those found between the different parainfluenza viruses, mumps and Newcastle disease virus. As might be expected, the less specific serological tests of immuno-diffusion and complement fixation produced more evidence of cross-reaction than did neutralization and HI tests.Some of these results confirm other studies on antigenic relationships amongst coronaviruses (~r et al., 1969 ; KAY]~ and DOWDLE, 1969) particularly in that avian infectious bronchitis virus does not seem to be related to the others by any of the tests used.The viruses tested here showed some anomalies in their neutralization by antisera. Neutralization of a virus may involve several immunological reactions and not enough is known about the neutralization of coronaviruses. Complement or fresh rabbit serum will enhance the neutralization of, for example, rubella (~Evx and W~T.LER, 1964) and respiratory syncytial virus (SToTT et aI.. 1967) ; nevertheless",
