The angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) converts angiotensin I into angiotensin II. Angiotensin II, which binds the angiotensin II type-1 receptor (AT1R), is a potent vasoconstrictor. On a pathophysiological basis, both ACE I/D and AT1R A1166C polymorphism lead to an enhanced activity of the angiotensin II-AT1R axis, thereby possibly contributing to circulatory disturbances. A mutually facilitatory effect may be presumed between the two polymorphisms. We examined whether this synergistic effect is involved in the evolution of different types of ischemic stroke. Genetic and clinical data on 308 consecutive patients with acutely developing ischemic stroke were analyzed. A total of 272 stroke and neuroimaging alteration-free subjects served as a control group. Univariate and logistic regression statistical approaches were used. The ACE D allele combined with the AT1R 1166C allele did not yield a risk of ischemic stroke. However, the co-occurrence of the homozygous ACE D/D and at least one AT1R 1166C allele was more frequent in the ischemic stroke group than in the control group (22.4 vs 11%, p < 0.005, OR, 2.33; 95% CI, 1.46-3.7). After specific subgroup analysis, this synergistic association was even stronger for small-vessel ischemic stroke (OR, 3.44; 95% CI, 1.9-6.24; p < 0.0005). Multivariate logistic regression analysis of the data confirmed this association (adjusted OR, 3.54, 95% CI, 1.88-7.16; p < 0.0005). Our results demonstrate that ACE D/D and AT1R 1166C NeuroMolecular Medicine",

Both ACE and AT1R display polymorphisms that can alter their functions. The ACE D/D polymorphism, associated with an elevated angiotensin II level, has been demonstrated to play an important role in the development of ischemic stroke and leukoaraiosis (Szolnoki, 2002 (Szolnoki, , 2003 (Szolnoki, , 2004 . The AT1R A1166C polymorphism, which leads to an enhanced responsiveness of the AT1R, has been suggested as a mild susceptibility factor for ischemic stroke (Rubattu, 2004; Brenner, 2005) . As both polymorphisms are associated with an enhanced activity of the angiotensin II-AT1R axis, we postulated at a clinical level, a synergistic effect between them as regards the evolution of ischemic stroke.

These subjects had been admitted to our Department of Neurology and Neurophysiology between January 1998 and 2004 after being examined by an internist in the local emergency unit or by a family physician at their homes. All 308 subjects underwent a detailed clinical scrutiny, including the medical history, the family history, an evaluation of vascular risk factors, general physical and neurological examinations, urine analysis, extensive laboratory examinations, electrocardiography, extracranial and transcranial Doppler sonography of the brain-supplying arteries, transthoracic and/or transoesophageal echocardiography where appropriate, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examinations within 2 d after the onset of the symptoms. All scans were read by an experienced investigator without knowledge of the clinical and laboratory data. The patients were enrolled immediately after the clinical neurological and MRI examinations. Subjects on whom MRIs could not be recorded or for whom the examined clinical parameters and risk factors could not be obtained with certainty in consequence of some technical cause or death were excluded from the study groups. Patients with atrial fibrillation and cardio-embolic source were also excluded in order to make the study groups more homogeneous.",

In order to decrease this possibility, we randomly divided our groups into two identical-sized samples and carried out statistical calculations independently for them. We considered an association between ischemic stroke and the occurrence of a given genotype biologically valid if that association was calculated to be statistically significant (p < 0.05) in both independent samples (data not shown).

On a pathophysiological basis, however, 358 Szolnoki et al. NeuroMolecular Medicine Volume 8, 2006 both unfavorable polymorphisms result in an enhanced activity of the angiotensin II-AT1R axis. This enhanced activity can lead to an endothelial dysfunction and vasoregulation disturbances (De Ciuceis, 2005; Watanabe, 2005) . The local vasoregulation of the cerebral blood flow takes place at a small-vessel level. A normal endothelial function is essential for this process. Accordingly, an endothelial dysfunction leads primarily to small-vessel circulatory disturbances. This association explains why the synergistic interaction we observed led to small-vessel infarction. The presence of the ACE D/D genotype produces an elevated ACE level, and thereby yields an increased level of the angiotensin II (Malik, 1997) .",
