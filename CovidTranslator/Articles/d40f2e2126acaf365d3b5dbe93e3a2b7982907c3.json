The success can be largely attributed to intensive donor testing for TTIs, supplemented by donor education and deferral of donors with risk factors. The two latter approaches have reduced the number of donors with window-period infections and contributed to a decrease in confirmed transmissible disease-positive allogeneic donors over the last decade in Canada, most notably for HBV and HCV [9] . Thus, the residual risk of TTIs is low by any standard.",

Other emerging infections are being monitored (eg, babesiosis, hepatitis E, CHIKV) while others such as influenza feature in contingency planning, in spite of not being transfusion-transmitted, due to their potential to disrupt blood donation and the health care system.

Since most cases are asymptomatic, TTI testing is the primary means of preventing transmission [11] . Universal donor testing was adopted in 2003 using nucleic acid testing (NAT). However, given the seasonal nature of WNV outbreaks, a more nuanced testing methodology was introduced by CBS in June 2015 that recognizes the lack of local transmission during the winter months. Now, all donors are tested from June 1 to November 30 and only donors who travel outside of Canada are tested during the rest of the calendar year.",

With increasing northward immigration of people from these regions, it is estimated that N 300,000 people are infected in the United States, and most American blood services have implemented universal donor testing [13, 14] . The rates of immigration from endemic countries are lower in Canada and thus CBS tests donors who are identified to be at risk based on the donor questionnaire. Those considered at high risk include those who were born or lived in an endemic country, or had a mother or maternal grandmother that was born or lived in an endemic country. The safety of this approach was demonstrated in a recent study that identified no 60 61  61  63  63  65  66  66  66  66 evidence of infection amongst donors without risk factors identified on the questionnaire (with the exception of one very unusual transfusion transmissionvertical transmission case) [15] . Interestingly, the selective testing approaches used for WNV and Chagas disease at CBS represent a change from the universal testing approach of the last three decades, which can be summed up as \"test everyone for everything\". The newer approach to certain TTIs takes into account geographic location, seasonal effects, and other risk factors in setting the optimal testing strategy.",

Babesiosis is caused by the protozoan parasites B microti, B duncani, and others in this genus, and spread by infected ticks. Most infections are asymptomatic or unrecognized, but the spectrum of clinical severity also includes flu-like symptoms, ranging to more severe illness and death in the immunocompromised [16] . Babesia microti is the most frequently transfusion-transmitted microbial pathogen in the United States, especially in the Northeast and Upper Midwest states [17] . There were 160 transfusion-transmitted cases reported from 1979 to 2009 in the United States with one case reported in Canada [18] . Hepatitis E is clinically similar to hepatitis A and it causes water-borne outbreaks in developing countries. In Canada, where it was previously thought to be primarily a disease of travelers, the actual prevalence of endemic hepatitis E is unknown. No cases of transmission by transfusion have been reported in North America, but transfusion transmission has been reported in endemic countries and recently in the United Kingdom [19] . CHIKV and dengue are two viruses common in the tropics that are spread by mosquitos. Both lead to similar acute illnesses with fever, rash, and muscle/joint pain. Transfusion-transmitted cases of dengue have been reported. CHIKV arrived in the Caribbean in 2013 and was thus identified as a threat to North America [20] . However, no transfusion transmitted cases of CHIKV have been reported to date. Current malaria travel deferral provides some protection with respect to many but not all of the affected areas, particularly in the Caribbean.",

Testing data provided by the National Microbiology Laboratory on travel-acquired chikungunya was used by CBS to calculate an estimated risk of a case of transfusion transmitted CHIKV in Canada of less than 1 in 11 million.",

A recent Babesia seroprevalence study for B microti in Canadian blood donors demonstrated that donor testing is not warranted in Canada at this time [22] . Dr Fearon presented as-yet-unpublished data on a collaborative CBS and H\u00e9ma-Quebec (the transfusion service for Quebec province) hepatitis E seroprevalence study that indicated that age is the only significant factor for increasing seroprevalence of hepatitis E. The absence of polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-positive results suggests that the risk of transfusion-transmission of hepatitis E in Canada is extremely low; however, further prevalence data needs to be collected.",

In a general sense, this evolution can be potentiated by the consumption of wild meat (meat from non-domesticated mammals, reptiles, amphibians, and birds). Through careful phylogenetic analysis of simian and human viruses, Africa has been recognized as the \"hot spot\" for HIV emergence, probably due to consumption of primate bush-meat by humans, [29] .

In other words, outbreaks are not likely to start from a transfusion, and transfused patients are not necessarily more likely to acquire an infection than the general population. For an infectious disease to be considered a transfusion-transmissible disease, certain pathogen-related and recipient-related characteristics have to be present. First, the pathogen must have an asymptomatic blood-borne phase (such as hepatitis B), which may either be acute or chronic. Second, the pathogen must be able to survive the donated blood processing and storage procedures, including temperature changes, leukoreduction, and centrifugation. Third, the disease must be transmissible by the intravenous route. Fourth, the recipient has to be susceptible to infection. Fifth, the disease must be a recognizable entity in the recipient once symptoms appear.",

Each EID was categorized based on the threat it poses to transfusion safety, the level of regulatory concern, the lack of effective intervention, and the amount of public concern. The top priority was assigned to 3 pathogens towards which intellectual and future resources should be focused: dengue viruses; Babesia species; and prions causing human vCJD [34] . The list also included CHIKV, Plasmodium species, T cruzi, human parvovirus B19, HIV, and hepatitis E. An EID tool-kit (Fig 2) was subsequently developed as a framework to guide health professionals and public health officials in triaging and managing infectious threats to the blood supply [35] . The EID tool-kit presents: a variety of methods for EID surveillance; key questions to be asked when a threat is suspected; and potential courses of action based on the situation. The Risk-Based Decision-Making framework. The Risk-Based Decision-Making framework was designed by the Alliance of Blood Operator to help blood operators identify, assess, act on, and communicate risk in decisions related to blood safety. It is a flexible tool, and its objectives are to optimize the safety of the blood supply while recognizing that elimination of all risk is not possible; allocate resources in proportion to the magnitude and seriousness of the risk and the effectiveness of the interventions to reduce risk; and assess and incorporate the social, economic, and ethical factors that may affect decisions about risk [23] [24] [25] .",

Due to increasing reports of transfusion-transmitted cases, their poor prognosis in immunocompromised transfusion recipients, and the lack of effective prevention strategies, Babesia species have been classified as a top priority for future blood supply safety efforts in the United States. Prions such as vCJD are being monitored closely and donor screening has been successful in preventing their spread into the donor pool [28] . Prions are currently being investigated for their potential relationship with other protein-folding diseases such as Alzheimer's disease [36] . Although respiratory infections (eg, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus) are not transfusiontransmissible, they do disrupt donor availability and organizational aspects of the blood collection and donation system. Dr Dodd expanded upon WNV, adding American insights into those earlier provided in the Canadian context by Dr Fearon. West Nile fever is caused by a flavivirus transmitted by culicine mosquitoes. The virus spread from southern Europe, Africa, and the Middle East to India, and arrived in the United States in 1999. By 2004 WNV was endemic in most of the continental US and Canada [33] . The experience of WNV in the US demonstrated that imported infections can be overwhelming and unpredictable. While WNV was considered a stable disease elsewhere in the world, in North America it was experienced as an explosive outbreak in 2002 and 2003 infecting over 400,000 individuals. Public concern was high as WNV, previously unknown in North America, spread rapidly across the continent via infected birds, and then to humans via mosquitoes. Although human to human transmission is not possible, there is potential for transfusion-associated transmission if the donation occurs during periods of pre-symptomatic viremia. NAT of pooled donor samples offered a rapid route to testing. Like other North American blood operators, CBS tests donors in pools. If a pool tests positive, individual donor testing is initiated. After NAT was initiated in the US in 2003, cases of transfusion-transmitted WNV have only rarely been encountered [33] .",

Dr Dodd described several emerging agents for which there is some evidence that that have or an assumption that they may be transfusion-transmitted including Severe Fever with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome Virus (no reported transfusion transmission [TT]), Q Fever (one report of TT, but no definitive evidence), Hepatitis E Virus (good evidence of occasional TT), vCJD, and other prions (evidence for TT) [35] . Dr Dodd focused on two viruses that are current causes for concern. Dengue virus is an important arbovirus. Like WNV, it is a flavivirus and is spread by mosquitos (Aedes genus). Humans are the amplifying host, and while a vaccine is under investigation there is currently no vaccine or specific treatment. Vector control is the only effective intervention. There are an estimated 390 million infections per annum worldwide [37] . In 50% to 80% of cases infection is asymptomatic. Dengue viruses have been found to be transfusion-transmitted in 7 separate geographic clusters in Hong Kong, Singapore, Puerto Rico, and Brazil. Currently, there is no FDA-licensed test for dengue RNA [37, 38] . CHIKV, which has caused recent massive outbreaks in the Caribbean and co-exists with dengue virus, is a potential threat to the North American blood supply due to its geographic proximity and donor travel Emerging Infectious Disease ToolKit. The Emerging Infectious Disease ToolKit is a framework developed by the AABB Transfusion-Transmitted Diseases, Emerging Infectious Diseases subgroup to guide health professionals and public health officials in triaging and managing infectious threats to the blood supply. The EID tool-kit presents: a variety of methods for EID surveillance; key questions to be asked when a threat is suspected; and potential courses of action based on the situation [35] .",

This topic was addressed by Dr Marc Turner, Medical Director at the Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service and Professor of Cellular Therapy at the University of Edinburgh. Dr Turner began by mentioning some milestones in the history of blood transfusion, highlighting a number of events that took place in his adopted home city of Edinburgh, Scotland. For example, in 1816 the first systematic experiments in intra-species transfusion were carried out by John Henry Leacock, who was studying in Edinburgh at the time. James Blundell, a University of Edinburgh medical school graduate, is credited with conducting the first successful human transfusions several years later. Since early in the last century, transfusion has become a mainstay of clinical practice with around 92 million RBC transfusions conducted annually worldwide [57] . For the most part, and particularly in developed countries, blood transfusion is safe. However, limitations remain, including sufficiency of supply, immunological compatibility of the donor and recipient, the risk of TTIs, and the risk of other complications such as iron overload. Many of these limitations could potentially be overcome by the production of RBCs for transfusion in the laboratory. Dr Turner's talk focused on human stem cells and their potential use for the ex vivo generation of RBCs for transfusion. Dr Turner discussed the biological and engineering limitations that must be overcome in order for ex vivo generated cells to become viable alternatives to donor-derived RBCs.",

In vivo, HSPCs are found in a hypoxic environment at the edges of the bone marrow. As they differentiate, they move more centrally in the marrow into an environment with a higher O 2 tension. It has long been known that when placed into agar/semisolid medium and provided with the right cytokine support, HSPCs can differentiate along different hematopoietic lineages, forming granulocyte/monocyte, and erythroid colonies with 7 to 14 days [59] . Culturing HSPCs in suspension using a two-phase culture system has several advantages over solid-phase culture [60] , the in vitro environment can be more precisely controlled and can be separated more easily [61, 62] . Dr Turner provided an overview of a two stage culture system which uses combinations of cytokines to control cell differentiation and proliferation and can be used to produce erythroid cells from CD34 + adult peripheral blood cells. During the enucleation process, which moves the cells into the early reticulocyte stage, the nucleus is extruded from the cell, and engulfed by macrophages. By days 10 to 14 of the two-stage culture, the population consists of approximately 50% normoblasts and 50% early (R1) reticulocytes. Other 3-stage systems have had demonstrated success expanding CD34 + HSPC from peripheral blood, bone marrow, or cord blood into functional RBCs [63] . These proofs-of-principle demonstrated that RBC generation ex vivo is possible, but processes described to date have limited scalability and do not yet constitute a workable approach to generate RBCs for transfusion.",

            "text": "Dr Turner spent the remainder of his talk discussing the two major types of challenges facing the ex vivo generation of RBCs for transfusion: biological challenges and engineering/logistical challenges. From the biological point of view, one major challenge is to determine the best source from which to derive the cells. Adult hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), one potential source of ex vivo RBCs, have a limited replication capacity; they could generate a small number of units of RBC but the reliance on donors remains. Unlike HSCs, hESCs have indefinite expansion capabilities and can self-renew, and were a source of much excitement when their derivation was first described [64] . hESCs are pluripotentthey can be cultured indefinitely as cell lines and are able to differentiate into all the cells of the body including hematopoietic cells [65] . In 2006, a considerably less ethically-controversial source of pluripotent stem cells was discovered-induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) [66, 67] earning the discoverer the Nobel Prize for Medicine in 2012. Initially generated by Takahashi and Yamanaka from human somatic skin fibroblasts by the use of four genes (Oct4/Sox2/Klf4/Myc), iPSCs are very similar to hESCs, can be differentiated into all three germ layers and have huge potential for regenerative medicine applications and disease modeling. Like hESCs, human iPSCs can be differentiated into hematopoietic cells in vitro [68] [69] [70] [71] , and this is an area of intensive research [72] . Dr Turner provided an overview of a system by which RBCs can be derived from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSC) in vitro using a feeder/serum free approach and cytokine mixes that drive the hPSC to HSPCs, then erythroblasts, normoblasts, and eventually reticulocytes over an approximately 30-day time frame. The differentiation process is complex and uses mixes of multiple cytokines and small molecules. Several issues remain including the long differentiation time, and the fact that while hPSC-derived RBCs can enucleate, the resulting cells are fragile and difficult to maintain in culture. The hPSC-derived RBCs express \u03b1/\u03b3 globin chains, the same combination of hemoglobin polypeptides expressed in fetal RBCs (as opposed to \u03b1/\u03b2 globin chains in adult RBCs); however, the oxygen-delivering characteristics of the hPSCderived RBCs are acceptable and therefore this would not preclude their use. Efforts are underway to optimize erythrocyte differentiation and enucleation and modify the hemoglobin to a more adult form [73, 74] .",

This approach has several benefits over PSC-as a starting material: the process is less complex and the differentiation time is shorter; there are reduced costs related to cytokines, growth factors, and media; and the final RBC phenotype is closer to an adult phenotype. The feasibility of this approach to produce enucleated RBCs has been shown [75] .

The key issues here are scale-up, process control, and intensification. Dr Turner described the use of the Ambr bioreactor technology (from TAP Biosystems, part of the Sartorius Stedim Biotech Group) as an approach to optimising the in vitro culture environment. Stirred tank bioreactors are a mature technology that is scalable and well-established for production of biotherapeutics. They allow for precise control of several physico-chemical parameters and economic/ rapid development screening at a variety of scales (10 mL, 250 mL, multi-liter). There are two gross limits to system efficiency. The first is the absolute density limit, which is calculated from specific oxygen uptake rate of cells and the mass transfer coefficient of the system. In this regard, the bioreactor system performs well; high density can be achieved, and the potential is certainly there to succeed in scaling it up to the needs of producing erythroid cells. The second limit is media volumetric productivity (liters of media/units of blood). Volumetric productivity is precisely determined by cell growth rate and specific support capacity of the media-consumption and supplementation. Specific rates are unstable and supplementation with glucose and glutamine does not improve growth, suggesting these are not limiting factors. In order for potential scale-up of this system, the limiting factors need to be identified.",

Sanger sequencing was based on the selective and partial incorporation of chain-terminating dideoxyribonucleotides into copies of the DNA strand being sequenced, and their separation by denaturing electrophoresis into a readable sequence \"ladder\". Dr Naccache stressed that Sanger sequencing, even in later, high throughput versions, was employed on one limited piece of DNA (typically a small DNA sector amplified using PCR) at a time to yield a single output sequence. Although this method was sufficiently advanced to be used to sequence first the human mitochondrial genome [81] and then the entire human genome [82, 83] , its robustness pales in comparison to NGS approaches. NGS yields huge amounts of DNA sequence in parallel; in other words, many sequences in a sample can be analyzed simultaneously [84] . For this reason, NGS is also called deep or massively parallel or high throughput sequencing. Its information output is such that thousands or millions of sequences can be provided concurrently, in a matter of hours. NGS has made possible metagenomic approaches, in which all DNA sequences from all genomes present in a clinical sample can be identified. This approach can now be used to determine if a blood sample contains only human DNA, or human DNA plus the DNA of an infectious pathogen, as well as to identify that pathogen if its sequence is known.",

All DNA/RNA present in a sample is first rapidly extracted (or copied using PCR) and fragmented into pieces of uniform length, providing a library. Short artificial DNA sequences are then bonded onto either end of all library DNA fragments. These adaptors allow hybridization of one strand of the modified DNA to complementary, tethered pieces of DNA in a flow cell. They are then \"sequenced by synthesis\" using fluorescent deoxyribonucleotide triphosphate building blocks. As each base is added to the growing chain, its position is noted via imaging and the positional information is captured in parallel. NGS can therefore provide 10 to 100 Gigabytes of data-much of it \"redundant\" in that the same sequence has been detected and read multiple times-to ensure sufficient coverage of all DNA sequence present in a sample. This huge amount of data is first processed using algorithms that detect and remove low quality reads, and then the \"host\" or human genome sequence information is subtracted. The remaining DNA is assembled into contiguous arrays by alignment of overlapping sequences, and compared to reference genomes of known pathogens. If an identified pathogen differs slightly from reference genomes, taxonomic classification can then be done to determine how recently the variant has diverged from known sequences. Dr Naccache stressed that this approach will work on bacterial, viral, fungal, and parasitic pathogens, all encoded by RNA-or DNA-based genomes, but not on prions, which are protein-based pathogens that infect by causing host proteins to take on pathological conformations.",

Dr Naccache surveyed the rapid development of commercial deep sequencing machines [85] . First to market in 2005 was Roche, with its 454 Sequencer, capable of 500 000 reads of 350 to 550 bp. Illumina and Ion Torent produced instruments that generated millions to billions of reads of slightly shorter sizes of 50 to 300 bp, with similar overall run times, between 2009 and 2014. These products all worked on the paradigm of sequencing by synthesis. The most recent entries into this instrumentation field work on a different principle, called nanopore sequencing: Pac Bio's RS apparatus (2011); and Oxford Nanopore Technology's MinION (2014). Both instruments are capable of a smaller number of reads than earlier machines (up to 100,000) but the reads are much longer, up to 40,000 bp. The technology works on the principle of detecting a growing DNA chain electrically when the chain is extruded through an engineered protein pore of nanometer diameter. The MinION instrument is amazingly small to essentially the size of a large memory stick [86] .",

Dr Naccache and co-workers developed a bioinformatics platform for these tasks called SURPI, Sequence-based Ultra-Rapid Pathogen Identification [87] . Such platforms are necessary given the size of the NGS output DNA sequence, the size of pathogen reference sequence databases, and the fact that pathogen sequences typically constitute no more than 0.001% to 1% of reads in the NGS output. This presents a needle in a haystack-type problem. To achieve rapid and robust detection, SURPI employs two analyzer programs that work on both DNA and translated protein alignments, using bacterial and viral databases. The platform can be employed in either fast or comprehensive mode; in fast mode pathogenic sequences can be identified in a clinical sample in minutes to hours, while comprehensive mode is more appropriate for detection of a novel pathogen's entire genome or to rule out infection in a clinically complex case. Dr Naccache noted that 20% to 30% of clinically significant respiratory infections are currently of unknown etiology.",

            "text": "In wrapping up her presentation, Dr Naccache discussed the likelihood that NGS would contribute directly to blood donation screening. She assessed this outcome as somewhat improbable over the near term, in part because blood donation screening is currently highly effective. NGS is currently quite expensive in its most accurate form, leading Dr Naccache to estimate the cost of a well-covered NGS study of around 10 samples using a total of 300 million sequences on the HiSeq platform at US$3000 , and a more shallow study, of the kind described above for rapid detection of Ebola and CHIKV, of around 6 samples using a total of 30 million sequences on the MiSeq platform, at US$1500. However, these estimates do not truly take into account the substantial infrastructure in place at UCSF/AVVDC, which comprises specialized equipment for sample extraction, library generation, and validation, NGS sequencing, and extensive computational analysis, not to mention the skills of medical technologists, researchers, and bioinformatics specialists. The relevance of NGS with respect to keeping the blood system safe from emerging pathogens will more likely lie in determining patterns of disease transmission and providing the confidence necessary to re-qualify a previously deferred blood donor. Suspected transmission by transfusion can be identified rapidly with great sensitivity and specificity using NGS of all implicated donors and recipients. It can also be used in a general, epidemiological sense, to trace patterns of infection and adaptation and speciation of infectious agents. While the contributions of NGS to clinical diagnosis of intractable cases and to public health, with respect to tracking and understanding disease outbreaks are already substantial, and will likely continue to accumulate exponentially, the prospects of using NGS for routine blood donation screening remain remote due to cost and throughput considerations.",

He compared the currently available PI technologies and their mechanisms of action, and discussed the potential impact of this technology on product quality. Dr Schubert noted that blood safety has historically been achieved by mitigating known risks with interventions such as donor screening and universal donor testing for specific pathogens. However, risks remain, as all tests have a detection limit and current testing does not account for unknown or unexpected pathogens. Thus, PI has the potential to improve the safety of blood products by preventing TTIs, especially in platelet products, where bacterial contamination is a particular risk [93] .",

The common trend is a negative impact on routine quality measures as well as newer tools introduced to further characterize platelet quality and functionality; however, the magnitude of the effect can be different dependent on the PI technology. Amongst other effects, PI treatment increases metabolism, apoptosis development, and platelet activation. These features lead to decreased platelet responsiveness and in vitro clot formation [103] . Furthermore, the effect of PI treatment on novel aspects of platelet function has also been extensively investigated. These studies show PI-dependent effects on cytokine [104] , mitochondrial DNA and microparticle release [105] [106] [107] , generation of reactive oxygen species and initiation of signaling cascades [108] , and expression profiles of mRNA and miRNA [109, 110] . These \"novel\" platelet features might assist with explaining PI-effects associated with increased inflammation, cell damage, and apoptosis, transfusion-related acute lung injury, and modulation of endothelial cell functions. In addition, studies of the effects of PI on the proteome of platelets could provide further insights into mechanisms, although the overall impact on the protein expression profile is relatively small [111] , suggesting PI-triggered modulations of protein activities. Finally, some of Dr Schubert's own work on elucidating signaling cascades in Mirasoltreated platelets revealed a central role of p38MAPK in regulating platelet activation and apoptosis development [112, 113] .",

The Cerus S-303 system for PI of RBCs demonstrated similar 24-hour recovery to standard RBCs, but these products would not meet Canadian standards due to their decreased shelf life [114] . Dr Schubert then discussed how PI of whole blood may be a more efficient approach compared to PI of individual components. Potential benefits of whole blood PI include early removal of pathogens, protection against transfusionassociated graft versus host disease due to WBC inactivation, and increased safety of all blood product components. The application of the Mirasol technology on whole blood has demonstrated efficacy against HIV [115] , Trypansoma cruzi [116] , and B microti [117] . Most recently, a study using Mirasol for malaria inactivation in whole blood has been performed in Ghana [118] . However, reduction of TTIs must be balanced against the effect that whole blood PI has on blood component quality. A study of in vivo viability of stored RBCs derived from Mirasol-treated whole blood suggests decreased viability that correlates with quality variables such as hemolysis and ATP concentration [119] . This approach was complemented by a study by Schubert and colleagues further demonstrating that platelet product quality seems to be less affected when produced from whole blood illumination compared to platelet component treatment [120] . Dr Schubert concluded by acknowledging that there are two sides to the PI coin, and that a balance must be achieved between safety and quality. Further research is needed to understand molecular mechanisms that lead to changes in quality with PI and to balance potential reductions in component effectiveness against reduction in TTIs. Ultimately, clinical trials are essential when it comes to making decisions regarding the implementation of pathogen inactivation into blood banking.

The second concept, choice, has to do with choosing how to allocate the limited resources available. The third basic economic concept is opportunity cost, which relates to the next best alternative use of resources. In other words, opportunity cost is the benefit willingly forgone when we do not choose the next best alternative. These three notions summarize the challenge of the decision making process when it comes to economic information.",

For example, the FDA annually tracks data on fatalities related to blood collection, transfusion reactions, and transmissible diseases (http://www.fda.gov). Microbial fatalities from transfusion are tracked using variables that experts deem important for focusing future pathogen testing and inactivation efforts such as by the type organism and blood product. These fatality reports help determine the relative burden of fatalities from different causes. As a result, it was shown that in the United States, plateletrelated deaths are mainly caused by bacteria and red cell-related deaths are mainly attributable to Babesia. Data sources, such as the FDA fatality data, help health authorities to understand the most important infection risks blood recipients face.",

Scientists may make various assumptions when measuring health resource outcomes, from choosing the wrong outcome to choosing an inappropriate test to measure it. These limitations, as well as an incomplete knowledge base, lead to uncertainty in data used for health economic analyses. When measuring health costs, one assumes that some expenditures are more important than others for the health care system; when measuring consequences from an intervention, one assumes that there is a sufficient understanding of the risks and benefits associated with that intervention. Cost per QALY provides a common denominator for comparing interventions, but cannot reduce uncertainty introduced by unavoidable assumptions.",

When implementation of a cost-effective blood donor test is needed, QALY has been applied to several patient populations and several interventions. Bell et al compared platelet PI using INTERCEPT in leukemia, lymphoma, orthopedic, and cardiac patients [124] . The authors found that the new method's cost effectiveness ($/QALY) is similar to other accepted blood safety interventions. This means the method can be considered cost-effective in the blood safety context while preserving patient quality of life. Dr Custer and colleagues have modeled the costeffectiveness of PI as an addition to current pathogen testing based on Canadian data. Comparing Mirasol treatment of whole blood, and of platelet and plasma, costs per QALY of $1,276,000 and $1,423,000, respectively (CDN, in this instance), were shown [125] . A more recent cost-utility analysis of implementing PI in Poland suggest high costs, but better cost-effectiveness than found in previous analyses of PI and nucleic acid testing in North America [126] .",

Broad implementation of PI for blood safety may thus prove unpalatable to funders without compensatory cost reductions in other aspect of component production. Either a more focused application of PI or lack of implementation until lowercost alternatives are developed may ensue. Decision making based on health economics and on risk assessments is likely to become the new norm in blood transfusion. This would comprise a strikingly different approach to blood safety implementation and decision making than in the past, when novel interventions were added to older ones, sequentially increasing costs and overall blood safety budgets.

The 2014 West African Ebola virus epidemic reinforced concerns about environmental change fueling the rapid emergence of pathogens not previously thought to have potential global significance. Pathogen inactivation of blood products may further reduce residual risk from established agents and provide protection from new agents in the medium term; however, the most likely driver for a paradigm shift to the use of pathogen inactivation is to reduce the ever-present risk of bacterial contamination of platelet products. Longer term, the possibility of donor-free cellular products and rapid next generation sequencing could drive down transfusion-transmission rates even further than the impressive safety margins now in place in Canada and other developed countries. Health economic analysis and risk-based decision making will be required to determine if anticipated benefits outweigh the considerable costs of these potential steps.",
