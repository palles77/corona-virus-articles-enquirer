Studies seeking an infectious cause frequently fail to isolate a specific pathogen. A delay in seeking medical care after the onset of symptoms, which may bring the patient to medical attention beyond the period of viral shedding, may be one explanation. Determination of a causative agent is further complicated in patients with chronic lung diseases who may have tracheobronchial colonization by potentially pathogenic bacteria, including H. influenzae, S. pneumoniae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. An increase in serum antibody titers to bacteria associated with acute bronchitic symptoms suggests that bacteria may have a causative although analysis of antibody coating of bacteria in sputum is not helpful.lZ5 In addition, severity of attacks of acute bronchitis may be increased by exposure to cigarette smoke and air pollutants. These substances in association with recurrent acute bronchial infection may result in permanent injury to the bronchial tree. Some epidemiologic studies support the potential role of acute respiratory infections in the pathogenesis of chronic obstructive lung 79 The relationship between acute bronchitis and heightened airway reactivity has also been studied extensively.

The cough may be accompanied by variable amounts of hemoptysis or retrosternal pain that is often described as a burning sensation. It is usually accentuated on inspiration. Generally, the temperature is only minimally to moderately elevated. Physical examination often shows harsh breath sounds, rhonchi, and variable amounts of expiratory wheezing. Occasionally, focal areas of diminished breath sounds are present, which suggest that inspissated mucus has caused atelectasis. Atelectasis may be relieved by the use of humidifiers; bronchodilators; vigorous coughing; and, if needed, tracheal suction. Sometimes, diffuse diminution of air intake or inspiratory stridor is present. These findings indicate obstruction of major bronchi or the trachea.

A complete history should include information on exposure to toxic substances and cigarette use, epidemiologic considerations, and vaccination history. A thorough physical examination is essential to exclude other causes of cough, including cardiovascular and parenchymal lung diseases. Routine bacterial cultures of expectorated sputum are not helpful because of the sampling problem of contamination by nasopharyngeal flora and the usual technical difficulties with cpllecting, transporting, and interpreting an adequate lower respiratory tract sample. Occasionally, the nature of sputum may provide some diagnostic clues. For instance, except for adenovirus infections, the sputum in viral infections almost always shows a marked predominance of mononuclear cells on Gram or Wright's stain. In contrast, in bacterial infections, the sputum shows a predominance of polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Mycoplasma infections are usually associated with mononuclear cells, but a predominant polymorphonuclear cell population may be present. Culture methods and a microimmunofluorescence test have been developed for the laboratory diagnosis of C. pneumoniue. The use of a gamma M immunoglobulin (1gM)-specific conjugate helps detect current infection. Patients in whom cough persists beyond the expected duration of the acute illness should have further diagnostic examination, including chest radiography, sputum cytology, and bronchoscopy, to exclude other diseases of the tracheobronchial tree and lungs.",

The pattern of antibiotic prescribing for these infections varies from country to country, but there is rationale for these antimicrobial choices exists. 38 Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a progressive disease characterized by reduced expiratory airflow that is relatively stable over several months of observation6 Chronic bronchitis is defined clinically as excessive cough, with productive of sputum on most days, for at least 3 months during at least 2 consecutive years. 76 The major risk factor for chronic bronchitis is cigarette smoking, and cumulative smoking history is most closely related to symptom development.2l Other factors implicated in the development of chronic bronchitis include occupational and environmental exposures (e.g., to dust, air pollution, sulfur dioxide, or nitrogen dioxide) and childhood respiratory tract infection.23* 75, lz4 Passive smoking may also be a risk factor for chronic bronchitis, but the evidence to suggest this is less clear.% The prognosis of COPD is affected most when lung function as reflected by the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV,) falls below 50% of predicted va1ues.lo When the FEVl falls below 1 L, the 5-year survival rate is approximately 50%.11* Very poor correlation exists between the amount of sputum produced and the degree of airflow obstruction.66s 91 Frequent acute exacerbations of bronchitis have not been associated with an accelerated decline in FEV1.19~49",

            "text": "An acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive lung disease is usually defined as an episodic respiratory decompensation without an objectively documented cause, such as pneumonia. The role of bacterial infection in acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis is controversial. Many patients are treated with antibiotics, but whether this treatment is efficacious is debatable.\"] Several groups have demonstrated increased numbers of bacteria and neutrophils in sputum during exacerbations.48, 77 A causal relationship can be inferred by the appearance of an acute antibody response in serum to these bacteria and an increase in inflammatory mediators in purulent ~puturn.8~, lO9 The relationship between bacterial infection and symptoms is complicated by a high spontaneous remission rate; this can be expected because bacterial exacerbations are usually limited to the bronchial mucosa. 81 In a landmark study, Anthonisen and co-workersg demonstrated for the first time that patients could be stratified according to symptoms to predict a response to antimicrobial therapy. In patients with at least two of increased dyspnea, sputum volume, and sputum purulence, broad-spectrum antibiotics (e.g., amoxicillin, trimethoprim-su~famethoxazole, or doxycycline) lead to improved clinical outcomes, fewer therapeutic failures, and a more rapid rate of lung function recovery compared with placebo. Overall, the length of illness was 2 days shorter for the antibiotic-treated group compared with the group receiving placebo. A meta-analysis of nine randomized, placebo-controlled trials of patients treated with antibiotics for acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis concluded that a small but statistically significant clinical and physiologic improvement could be expected in antibiotic-treated ss, mc 92* 97 Table  1 demonstrates the results in seven of the nine trials and a recently completed, large, randomized, placebo-controlled Italian trial that was not included in the meta-analysis? A beneficial impact of antibiotics was demonstrated in studies that included the largest number of patients. In the six trials that reported peak expiratory flow rates, an improvement of 10.75 L/min favoring the antibiotic group was noted. Although this improvement is small, it may be clinically relevant, particularly in patients with limited respiratory reserve. Design flaws in the earlier studies, such as small number of study patients, unclear selection criteria, uncertain microbiology, nonstandard evaluation criteria, and lack of stratification of patients, may account for the discrepancy in outcomes.",

Because the cost of failure of treatment of these patients is high, an aggressive approach to treatment of this high-risk group may improve outcome. Routine antimicrobial therapy fails in 13% to 25% or more of exacerbation^.'^, 74 Therapeutic failure leads to increased cost of care because of extra physician visits, further diagnostic tests, and repeated courses of antibiotics. It may also lead to more hospitalizations and prolonged absence from work.",

Group 2 patients had simple chronic bronchitis with minimal or no impairment of pulmonary function and without any other risk factors. Treatment was recommended because Anthonisen and co-workers9 demonstrated a beneficial effect of antibiotics. An aminopenicillin was suggested as first-line therapy for an acute exacerbation because the consequences of a treatment failure were expected to be relatively few. Group 3 patients were described as having moderate to severe chronic bronchitis. They may be elderly (> 65 years), and were likely to have frequent exacerbations (four or more/year). Treatment with antibiotics directed toward p-lactamase-producing strains of H. injluenzae and M. catarrhalis, such as a second-or third-generation cephalosporin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, second-generation macrolide, or quinolone was suggested. Group 4 was similar to group 3 but had other significant comorbid illness, such as congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus, chronic renal failure, or chronic liver disease.

The suggested antimicrobial choices for this group included oral amoxicillin, doxycycline, co-trimoxazole, or a macrolide. \"Second-degree\" patients were defined as having a longer history of chronic obstructive lung disease, several exacerbations each year, and impaired lung function. Because of the concern of gram-negative pathogens, Lode proposed the use of oral cephalosporins, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, or quinolones. \"Third-degree\" patients were described as hospitalized patients with significant comorbidity, prolonged history of COPD, severe functional impairment, and frequent infections with gram-negative pathogens. He suggested oral therapy with cephalosporins, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, or quinolones. In hospitalized patients, these same drugs, administered intravenously or an aminoglycoside in combination with p-lactam antibiotic, were recommended. In the United Kingdom, Wilsonll* classified patients into four groups ( Table  5) . Group 1 patients have acute bronchitis that is usually viral in origin. Because no underlying lung disease is present in this group, the illness is usually selflimited and runs a benign course. Group 2 patients have simple chronic bronchitis, are younger, have only mild to moderate impairment of lung function (FEVl > 50% predicted value) and have less than four exacerbations per year. In this group of patients, typical pathogens, including H. influenme, S. pneurnoniae, and M . ~t a r r~Z i s are present, although viral infection often precedes bacterial superinfection. Treatment with a @-lactam is usually successful, and the prognosis is excellent. Group 3 patients are older and may have poor underlying lung function (FEV1 < 50% predicted). Alternatively, they may demonstrate only moderate impairment of lung function (FEVI 50%-65% predicted) but have significant comorbidity (eg., diabetes mellitus, congestive heart failure, chronic renal disease, or chronic liver disease) or, experience four or more exacerbations per year. H. infuenzae, S. pneumoniae, and M. catarrhalis continue to be the predominant organisms. In this group of patients, initial treatment failure has major implications for the patient and health-care system, including increased time lost from work, hospitalization, or both. Treatment with medications directed toward resistant organisms, such as a quinolone, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, second-or third-generation cephalosporins, or a second-generation macrolide should perform better than amoxicillin. Group 4 patients suffer from chronic bronchial infection with frequent exacerbations characterized by increased spu- tum production, increased sputum purulence, cough, and worsening dyspnea. Many of these patients have evidence of bronchiectasis if subjected to highresolution CT scanning. These individuals tend to have a chronic progressive course, and an aggressive therapeutic approach should be offered.

Although the overall results indicated no preference for either treatment arm, in patients with risk factors (i.e., severe underlying lung disease, more than four exacerbations/year, duration of bronchitis > 10 years, elderly, or significant comorbid illness), the use of ciprofloxacin led to improved clinical outcome, higher quality of life, and lower costs.

Therefore, smoking cessation and vaccination strategies are cornerstones of management in terms of halting disease progression and reducing the frequency of infectious exacerbations. Bacterial infection is the main culprit in acute flares of the disease. Routine antimicrobial therapy fails in a significant number of patients, and therapeutic failures lead to increased costs.
