Several optical imaging methods and probes have been used to track how stem cells incorporate and regenerate themselves in vivo over time. However, these approaches are limited by photobleaching, toxicity and interference from background tissue autofluorescence. Here we show that fluorescent nanodiamonds, in combination with fluorescence-activated cell sorting, fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy and immunostaining, can identify transplanted CD45 -CD54 1 CD157 1 lung stem/progenitor cells in vivo, and track their engraftment and regenerative capabilities with single-cell resolution. Fluorescent nanodiamond labelling did not eliminate the cells' properties of selfrenewal and differentiation into type I and type II pneumocytes. Time-gated fluorescence imaging of tissue sections of naphthalene-injured mice indicates that the fluorescent nanodiamond-labelled lung stem/progenitor cells preferentially reside at terminal bronchioles of the lungs for 7 days after intravenous transplantation.",

            "text": "T he lung is a complex organ consisting of at least 40 different cell lineages 1 . Following postnatal growth, the lung epithelium slowly turns over under normal conditions, but its regenerative capacity can be activated substantially after injury 2 . Resident lung stem/progenitor cells (referred to collectively as LSCs throughout this Article) are responsible for this epithelial repair and tissue homeostasis. Several stem cell niches have been identified as being located in terminal bronchioles or bronchoalveolar junctions [3] [4] [5] [6] . These putative LSCs are susceptible to infection by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) associated coronavirus 6, 7 , leading to deterioration of lung tissue and loss of lung repair capacity. LSCs have also been found to be able to renew and proliferate to form epithelial cells in vivo 4 . They are potentially useful in regenerative therapy, for example, in repairing damaged lung tissue in patients. The advances and obstacles of using various strategies and assays to establish the regenerative potential of endogenous LSCs have been reviewed recently 8,9 . To enable the aforementioned therapeutic applications of LSCs, it is crucial to determine their tissue-specific engraftment and regenerative capacity in animals. Achieving this goal requires the use of a highly sensitive imaging modality, together with a highly stable (both biologically and photophysically) imaging probe, to allow tracking of the transplanted cells in vivo over an extended period of time. Compared with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), optical imaging offers the advantages of higher sensitivity, larger in vitro and in vivo throughputs, and greater potential for clinical translation 10 . However, existing fluorescence-based technologies such as dye labelling 11 and in vitro transfection of cells with plasmids to express fluorescent proteins (for example, GFP) 12, 13 or non-fluorescent compounds (for example, luciferase) 14 often suffer from the problems of photobleaching, interference from background tissue autofluorescence and/or low transfection efficiency for primary cells. Although quantum dots have been adopted and highly regarded as alternatives 15, 16 , their application is hampered by their potential toxicity and facile degradation in vitro 17 as well as in vivo 18 .",

            "text": "Fluorescent nanodiamonds (FNDs) 19 , a new member of the nanocarbon family 20 , have emerged recently as a novel nanotechnology imaging probe for biological applications 21, 22 . The nanoscale diamond material is chemically robust, biologically inert, and non-toxic at both cellular 23, 24 and whole-organism levels 25, 26 . A number of experiments have demonstrated that bare FND particles can be readily taken up by cells through clathrin-mediated endocytosis 27 , but with an exceptionally low exocytosis activity 28, 29 . When excited by green-yellow light, the fluorophores (for example, negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy centres, NV 2 ) built into the FND emit perfectly stable far-red emission ( 600-800 nm) with a fluorescence lifetime (t) greater than 15 ns, even in cells 30, 31 . This lifetime is substantially longer than that (t \u2248 1-4 ns) of the endogenous and exogenous fluorophores commonly used in cell biology 32 , making it possible to separate FND emission from the strong autofluorescence background of host tissue using fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) and various nanosecond time-gating techniques 31, 33 . In this work, we show that primary cells such as LSCs can be spontaneously labelled with FNDs by endocytosis, and that the labelling does not eliminate cellular functions such as division, proliferation and differentiation. By combining FND-FLIM with fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and immunostaining analysis, we have been able to identify, unequivocally, transplanted cells in histological lung sections after intravenous (i.v.) injection of the FND-labelled LSCs into mice for more than a week, with singlecell resolution. The tissue-specific engraftment capacity of these cells is further elucidated with lung injury models.",

To carry out FND labelling, the cultured CD45 2 CD54 \u00fe CD157 \u00fe cells (identified hereafter as LSCs) were incubated with 100 nm FNDs in DMEM at 37 8C with 5% CO 2 for 4 h, after which the cells were washed thoroughly with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to remove free FNDs, and then collected by trypsin treatment. Flow cytometric analysis showed that the amount of 100 nm FNDs taken up by the LSCs reached a plateau at a concentration of 100 mg ml 21 ( Supplementary Fig. S6 ). This behaviour closely resembles that of many other cell types including HeLa cells, 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes and 489-2.1 multipotent stromal cells 27, 29 . An extraordinary feature of the FND labelling is that in addition to far-red fluorescence, data collected in the side scatter (SSC) channel also provide useful information on FND uptake (Fig. 2a) 29 . This is attributable to the fact that diamond has the highest refractive index of all transparent minerals 36 , and diamond nanocrystallites scatter light strongly in the visible region and thus produce strong SSC signals. By properly gating the bivariate plot (SSC versus Far-Red) in quadrants, two distinct separate populations of FND-labelled and unlabelled cells could be detected in these two channels (Fig. 2a) . The double-positive cell population, denoted SSC \u00fe Far-Red \u00fe , was subsequently identified as FND-labelled cells without additional staining.",

Organs and tissues including lungs, kidneys, liver and spleen were collected for examination on days 1, 4 and 7 after injection. Flow cytometric analysis confirmed that the injected LSCs preferentially resided in the lungs, and not in other organs ( Supplementary Fig. S7 ). On day 1, 1.64% of the total population of viable pulmonary cells appeared as FND-labelled LSCs (Fig. 3a) . This fraction, however, markedly decreased to 0.22% and 0.12% on days 4 and 7, respectively. In this analysis, the gating thresholds in the bivariate plots were carefully chosen by referring to the in vitro result (Fig. 2a) as well as the profiles of the saline controls ( Supplementary Fig. S8 ) to ensure good reliability. With a false positive rate of less than 0.05%, as determined from the controls, the observed approximately tenfold decline in the SSC \u00fe Far-Red \u00fe subpopulation was a reflection of the fact that most of the transplanted cells were not functionally engrafted.

This capacity could be substantially activated after tissue injury 2 . To illustrate this effect, we tracked LSCs in vivo using mice pretreated with naphthalene, which selectively ablated club cells in the epithelium of terminal and respiratory bronchioles 39 . Club cells (or Clara cells) are secretory cells that play a protective role in the bronchial tissue against damage. In this experiment, 5 \u00d7 10 5 FND-labelled LSCs were injected into the mice after lung injury for 2 days. Because LSCs express CCSP (Fig. 1a) , the extent of the injury and the repair of the bronchiolar epithelium could be examined by immunostaining against CCSP (club cell secretory protein). On day 1, the bronchiolar epithelium in the lung-injured mice was sparsely surrounded by CCSP \u00fe cells in both the control and treatment groups (Fig. 4a) , showing low degrees of lung repair. Although some progress in club cell regeneration occurred in the control on day 7, the bronchiolar epithelium of the mice injected with FND-LSCs displayed a significantly greater repopulation of CCSP \u00fe cells, that is, a greater regenerative capacity or a more rapid restoration of the lung epithelium (Fig. 4a) .",

In comparison, the percentages of transplanted non-LSCs (such as mouse embryonic fibroblasts, MEFs) in the recipient lungs of the injured mice were significantly lower (0.33% and 0.17% on days 1 and 7, respectively) and should be attributed to non-specific entrapment (Supplementary Fig. S10 ). Further analysis by compound imaging with H&E staining and time-gated fluorescence (t \u00bc 9-18 ns) revealed that the FND-labelled LSCs were preferentially localized in the terminal bronchioles of the lung-injured mice (Fig. 4c) , in contrast to the localization of the cells in the subepithelium of bronchiolar airways in uninjured mice (Fig. 3b) .",

It is therefore speculated that the pattern of the distribution of these FND-labelled cells may reflect different degrees of injury in the lung tissues. For instance, the clustered cells may represent regions that have sustained more injury from the naphthalene. A close examination for the co-localization of the FND-labelled cells with the CCSP (Fig. 5a) and pan-cytokeratin (Fig. 5b) epithelial markers by high-power fluorescence imaging with single-cell resolution confirmed that the transplanted LSCs were not entrapped in the microvascular network of the lung, but rather had been functionally engrafted and integrated in the bronchiolar epithelium.",

To provide a semi-quantitative estimate 40 , we calculated the percentage (P h ) of the transplanted LSCs engrafted to the lung based on the total number (N v ) of viable (PI 2 ) cells isolated from the mouse lung tissue, the percentage (P s ) of the FND-labelled cells identified in FACS analysis, and the number (N t ) of the cells actually transplanted, as P h \u00bc N v P s /N t . With N v \u2248 7 \u00d7 10 6 , P s \u00bc 1.64% and N t \u2248 5 \u00d7 10 5 , the P h for normal mice was estimated to be 23% on day 1. This percentage, however, markedly declined to 1.7% on day 7 (Fig. 3a) . In contrast, the P h for the lung injury model exhibited a much smaller decrease, with P h \u2248 13% on day 1 and P h \u2248 11% on day 7 (Fig. 4b) . The distinct contrast between these two results provides compelling evidence that the lodgement of the transplanted FND-labelled cells in the injury models represents a 'pro-active' tissue-specific engraftment, instead of non-specific (or passive) entrapment. A merit of the FND labelling technique is that it allows quantitative assessment of the distribution of transplanted LSCs in tissue due to the excellent chemical stability and photostability of the nanomaterial. We conducted this analysis by acquiring images of H&E staining using a bright-field section scanner. From these images, the cells showing FND labelling were counted visually in randomly selected regions. To reduce potential biases in the quantitative assessment, measurements were performed for more than 30 visual fields per section for six randomly selected sections of each sample, by independent workers. The results show that the percentages of FND-labelled LSCs nested in the terminal bronchioles and alveoli of the lung-injured mice are 59+5% and 41+5%, respectively, compared with 24+3% and 76+3% for the uninjured mice (Fig. 5c ). The marked difference in the histomorphometric distributions of the FND-labelled LSC population between these two animal models serves as additional evidence that the transplanted LSCs preferentially engraft to the terminal bronchioles of the mice after lung injury. Although the mechanisms by which the injected LSCs reach lung tissues and further engraft to the terminal bronchioles are still not yet fully understood 38 , our findings support the contention that specific microenvironments (or niches) in lungs play important roles in the regulation of tissue-specific engraftment, structural support and the signals for self-renewal and differentiation of the stem cells 41, 42 .",

Moreover, the FND labelling does not eliminate the cells' in vitro differentiation and in vivo migration. Using the combined techniques, we have been able to follow the fate of FND-labelled LSCs in vivo after transplantation, precisely locate their position in tissue with single-cell resolution, and quantify their engraftment capacity over a week for the first time. The platform is particularly suitable for the study of rare stem cells that are difficult to transfect to express fluorescent proteins or non-fluorescent compounds.

Fluorescence was collected through an oil-immersion objective (\u00d7100, NA 1.4) and detected with either a photomultiplier tube (PMT) for SP-C and DAPI or an avalanche photodiode (APD) for FND. To conduct FLIM, an external frequency-doubled picosecond Nd:YAG laser (IC-532-30, High Q Laser), operating at 532 nm with a pulse width of 7 ps and a repetition rate of 50 MHz, was coupled through a single-mode optical fibre into the Leica microscope featuring a FLIM system (Supplementary Fig. S11 ).

A time-correlated single-photon counting system (Pico-Harp 300, Pico Quant) was used to measure the fluorescence lifetimes, from which time-gated images were obtained with the SymPhoTime software.",

Mice were maintained until being killed on days 1, 4 and 7 (n \u00bc 3 per group), after which organs were collected for analysis with FACS and FLIM. All assays were repeated for at least three independent experiments. For fluorescence imaging, tissues were first fixed in 10% formalin overnight and then embedded in paraffin and sectioned. Sections (5 mm) were deparaffinized in xylene, rehydrated in a graded ethanol series, and incubated in blocking buffer. Sections were incubated overnight with antibodies against antigens including F4/80 (eBioscience), CCSP and pan-cytokeratin (both from Santa Cruz) and then analysed immunohistochemically with a peroxidase detection kit (Vector Laboratories) using diaminobenzene as the substrate according to the manufacturer's instructions. All sections were counterstained with Mayer's haematoxylin. Images of lung tissues after H&E staining or immunostaining were acquired using a bright-field scanner (Aperio Digital Pathology System) equipped with a \u00d740 objective. In separate experiments with lung injury models (n \u00bc 3 per group), naphthalene dissolved in Mazola corn oil was injected intraperitoneally at 275 mg kg 21 into sex-and backgroundmatched adult (four weeks old) CD-1 (ICR) mice. FND-labelled LSCs were then administered 52 h after the naphthalene treatment and subsequently analysed following the procedures described above. All assays were repeated in triplicate.",
