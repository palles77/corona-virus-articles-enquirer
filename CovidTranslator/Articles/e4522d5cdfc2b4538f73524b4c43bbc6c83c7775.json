These analytes were separated on a reverse phase C18 column using a mobile phase of acetonitrile:2% acetic acid in water (75:25, v/v) with a flow rate of 200 mL/min. The qTOF-MS was operated under multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode using the electrospray ionization (ESI) technique with positive ion polarity. A comparison of three different extraction techniques i.e. accelerated solvent extraction (ASE), extraction under ultrasonic waves (USW) and the classical extraction by percolation (CE) method was done and quantification of these extracts was also carried out by the proposed method.",

Glycyrrhizin (glycyrrhizic acid) is chemically 3-O-(2-O-b-D-glucopyranuronosyl-a-D-glucopyranuronosyl)-3b-hydroxy-11-oxo-18b, 20b-olean-12-en-29-oic acid. Roots of Glycyrrhiza glabra (liquorice) are extensively used in herbal medicines to treat diseases such as phthisis, contagious hepatitis, bronchitis and ague [1] and are also used in the treatment of various ailments such as spleen, sore throat, bronchitis, liver, kidney and ulcers [2] [3] [4] . Liquorice extract is largely used in confectionery, as a masking agent or taste corrective in pharmaceutical formulations and also to improve the taste of beer. It has anti-inflammatory, antiallergenic, antihepatotoxic, antiulcer and antiviral properties [5] [6] [7] . Glycyrrhizin presents in the roots as potassium or calcium salt and its content varies from 2% to 15% depending on plant species, as well as geographic and climatic conditions of its habitat.",

The quality of extraction procedure of a plant material is reflected in the percentage of a compound of interest extractable by a particular process. After extraction, the desired compound can be purified by normal reported methods of purification. Extraction values of glycyrrhizin from G. glabra with water and 50% aqueous ethanol were almost the same as with ASE and USW and were observed to be 3.50%, 3.48%, 3.40% and 4.12%, 4.00%, 2.82%, respectively ( Table 3 ). The comparison of extraction values in 50% aqueous ethanol by CE at ambient temperature with extraction under USW and ASE in the same solvent exhibited no significant increase in the yield of glycyrrhizin. However, in acidic conditions (pH 0.22) a maximum of 3.00% of glycyrrhizin was extracted, whereas under basic conditions (pH 11.85) the extractive value was to the tune of 12.70% (Table 3) . As G. glabra is one of the major plants used commercially, the ASE method with ammonium hydroxide is the most appropriate method of extraction. By this process the amount of extractable glycyrrhizin increases by more than 50% as compared to extraction by CE under similar conditions. The amount of glycyrrhizin and glycyrrhetic acid in the extract obtained by different extraction methods (Table 4) with 50% ethyl alcohol was 4.12% and 0.19% by ASE, and 4.00% and 0.17% by USW whereas 1.71% and 0.11% was observed by CE, respectively. It is clear from the results that ASE with liquid ammonia is the most suitable method for extraction of glycyrrhizin from the roots of G. glabra.",
