            "text": "Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are highly conserved type 1 membrane proteins that initiate a multiplicity of transient gene transcriptions, resulting in innate and adaptive immune responses. These essential immune responses are triggered by common TLR pattern recognition receptors of microbial products expressed through the cytoplasmic carboxy-terminal Toll/IL-1 domain. Toll/IL-1 adapter protein cascades are induced by an activated Toll/IL-1 to induce transient transcription responses. All TLRs, with the exception of TLR3, use an MyD88 adapter to Toll/IL-1 to initiate a proinflammatory cascade. TLR3 uses the toll receptor 3/4 induction factor adapter to initiate a different cytosolic adapter cascade with double-stranded RNA agonists. This non-MyD88 pathway induces both NF-kB and type 1 interferon responses. By using a TLR3-restricted double-stranded RNA agonist, rintatolimod, we demonstrate significant unexpected differences in toxic responses between rats and primates. The mechanism of this differential response is consistent with a relative down-regulation of the NF-kB inflammatory cytokine induction pathway in the cynomolgus monkey and humans, but not observed systemically in rat. Our findings suggest evaluation of TLR3 agonists in drug therapy. (Am J Pathol 2014, 184: 1062e1072; http://dx.",

A report by Seok et al 2 found a poor correlation between human and murine response to inflammatory stimuli, including responses to trauma, burn, and endotoxemia. Discordant results at the level of gene expression array, temporal gene response patterns, and major signaling pathways, in response to these injuries, were demonstrated across species, but well conserved in humans, pointing toward inadequate and nonpredictive nature of available inflammation murine models. This may further explain the difficulty in translating promising pharmacological compounds into successful novel therapies. Despite the heterogeneity of the patients and the causes of life-threatening trauma, the report found highly correlated genomic response profiles across the patient population, but not across species. Burn, trauma, and endotoxemia yielded highly correlated genomic responses within species, but not across species, rodent to human. We have observed a similar dissociation of toxicities in a parallel proinflammatory system, the toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) induction of innate immune responses.",

The cellular location of TLR3 is modulated by UNC93B1, which promotes trafficking of differentially glycosylated TLR3 to the plasma membrane; UNC93B1 transcription is up-regulated by dsRNA. 15 To address the observed toxic heterogeneity of response to PAMPs across species, we have used a restricted TLR3specific agonist, with much data reported in double-blind clinical trials 16, 17 and unpublished open-label safety trials. Rintatolimod (poly I:poly C 12 U; Ampligen) is a synthetic dsRNA analogue composed of a single polypurine (inosine) strand and a single polypyrimidine (cytosine and uridine) strand. These are assembled in a dsRNA structure that is maintained under physiological conditions by typical hydrogen bonding between purine and pyrimidine base pairs. The introduction of the pyrimidine base, uridine, at a 1:12 ratio into the polypyrimidine strand maintains the double-stranded structure but allows recurring sites of thermodynamic instability from nonhydrogen bonding of the mismatched base (uridine) with inosine of the polypurine strand. 18 This small difference in structure, however, restricts induction of transitory gene activities to TLR3, with its unique TRIF signaling pathways, with the exclusion of the mda5 and RIG-1 dsRNA proinflammatory dependence 19, 20 (Figure 1 ). By using the restricted specificity of rintatolimod and the unique TRIF pathway of TLR3 signaling, we have been able to identify the apparent mechanism for the discordance in TLR3-mediated toxicity between rodents and primates.",

Animals were dosed similar to the human schedule, with twice-weekly infusions of rintatolimod at 6, 18, or 36 mg/kg per dose, which were expected to be nonlethal on the basis of the acute toxicity studies. Dose levels were determined by the human dose of 400 mg per infusion, which is approximately 6 mg/kg for an average-sized patient. Results of these two chronic toxicological studies were consistent with the findings of the acute toxicological dosing (Table 2) , although lethality in the rat during the 6-month course of the study was commonly observed. The rat was extremely sensitive in multiple organs to both the 18-and 36-mg dosing regimens, and many animals in these groups did not survive the 6-month dosing period. In the rat, dose-dependent liver and renal toxicities were observed in all three dosage groups. Additional findings in the rat included anemia and polychromasia, increased alkaline phosphatase, and profound elevation of hepatic transaminases.

Preclinical studies in the rat and cynomolgus monkey assessed the induction of these three inflammatory cytokines, as well as IL-10, measured in the serum in response to three dosage levels (6, 18, and 36 mg/kg) of rintatolimod administered by i.v. infusion. The 4-hour time point in response to initial infusion in rats gave the strongest systemic signals, which are illustrated in Table 4 , with the expression pattern consistent, although less intense, at later time points. The monkey exhibited minimal evidence of systemic cytokine production. A minimal IFN-g response was observed that was significantly different from that in the rat. IL-12p70 at the highest 36 mg/kg dose level generated a small response in one monkey. In contrast, the rat showed a systemic cytokine response, with signals present for all three inflammatory cytokines and IL-10, even at the lowest 6 mg/kg dose. The species difference for systemic inflammatory cytokine expression is statistically significant for each cytokine (P < 0.02). For comparison with humans, serum was obtained from 14 patients participating in a concurrent open-label clinical study of chronic fatigue syndrome (AMP-511), with a similar time course to the animal pharmacological characteristics and quantified for the same panel of cytokines. The human clinical trial patients were dosed with 400 mg of rintatolimod i.v. over 30 to 60 minutes. Similar to the monkey response, serum cytokine increases were minimally expressed with IFN-g, the highest in the aggregate, with a large SD (Table 5 ). Finally, we assessed for evidence of chronic systemic cytokine changes at the week 32 time point, obtained Table 5 illustrates results similar to those of the monkey, with one patient exhibiting a relatively high systemic TNF-a level. Systemic inflammatory cytokines, observed in rats, are correlated with significant acute and chronic in vivo toxicities at doses that elicited no detectable systemic inflammatory cytokines and minimal toxicities in primates. Moreover, the elevated thyroid activity in the cynomolgus monkey has not been detected in humans. Again, systemic signals of cytokine change in association with 32 weeks of rintatolimod at 400 mg per dose i.v., twice weekly, were not evidenced. Human DCs do show phenotypic changes in association with exposure to rintatolimod, including shift in maturation profile and local release of cytokines (IL-12p70, ILs 4, 6, and 10, IFN-g, and TNF-a) and the chemokines, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (CCL2), and macrophage inflammatory protein-1a (CCL3) in the microenvironment of culture supernatants. 21, 22 As demonstrated in this communication, systemic elevations of inflammatory cytokines are observed in rats. In monkeys and humans, any local elevations (microenvironment) induced by rintatolimod were rarely detected systemically. The difference is in the magnitude of the response. It is this difference in humans that appears to be responsible, at least in part, with the relative lack of toxicity in primates. Toxicities associated with overwhelming infection are associated with systemic cytokine storms 23,24 of elevated measurable circulating cytokines. The lack of systemic cytokine detection is consistent with the observed minimal toxicity in primates, in contrast to the significant toxicities observed in nonprimates.",

Figure 2 demonstrates an in silico molecular model of rintatolimod bound to the human TLR3 ectodomain, forming a homodimer structure, and its close 2 \u00c5 amino acid contacts on the TLR3 variable nonhelical segments.

The substitution of a mismatched base (uridine) in the poly C strand of rintatolimod inactivates its ligand activity for the cytosolic helicases (MDA5 and RIG-1) while maintaining its agonist activity for TLR3. 19, 20 The helicases act through the inflammatory MyD88 pathway used by all mammalian TLRs, with the exception of TLR3, which uses the TRIF adapter to initiate innate immune responses. Figure 1 illustrates the pattern recognition of the ectodomain of the TLRs and their cytoplasmic adapter pathways responsible for their pleiotrophic effects. Figure 1A depicts the non-MyD88 pathway used by TLR3, and Figure 1B depicts the MyD88-dependent pathways used by all TLRs and the helicases, with the exception of TLR3. Our toxicological analysis demonstrated systemic dose-dependent inflammatory cytokine responses in rats. Although we did not examine inflammatory cytokine responses in rabbit or dog because of a lack of available test kits for the cytokines examined, we believe we would observe a similar quantitative cytokine response in the dog as observed in the rat. The rabbit was so The N-terminals of each TLR3 bind to opposite ends of the dsRNA, with a minimum length of 45 bp required for interaction with essential residues of TLR3 for activation of intracellular signaling.

There were, however, no significant detectable systemic inflammatory cytokines in either monkeys or humans. The data indicate that the parallel intracellular IFN and NF-kB transcriptional pathways are species dependent in magnitude of response because primate cells in culture respond to rintatolimod, with the biosynthesis of the IFNs and inflammatory cytokines insufficient in vivo to provide a detectable systemic response. The lack of a systemic inflammatory response in primates is consistent with our observation of discordant in vivo toxicities between rats, monkeys, and humans and is consistent with the differences in gross analysis and histopathological characteristics observed between the species. In the case of MyD88-dependent TLR pathways, primates are more sensitive. 2 In contrast, primates are much more resilient than rodents to inflammatory cytokine toxicity induced by noneMyD88-dependent, TRIF-mediated activation of TLR3. Redundant helicase pathways may reduce the toxicological distinction between species for agonists that activate these pathways, such as poly I:poly C, in contrast to rintatolimod. Potential mechanisms that may explain the speciesspecific differential toxicities observed with TLR3 activation by dsRNA are apparent on analysis of gene structural differences between species. In addition to the primary sequence differences between rodents and primates illustrated in Table 7 , rodent and human TLR3 gene structures are remarkably dissimilar in the proximal promoter domains, as well as TLR3 isoforms. 26, 27 An example of differential functional activity between mice and humans is the induction of TLR3 expression in murine macrophages by lipopolysaccharide (LPS; ie, not seen in humans). 7 Expression in human blood cells (including monocytes, granulocytes, natural killer cells, T cells, and B cells) and tissue macrophages is undetectable at the transcript level after LPS exposure and is only seen in myeloid DCs. 12, 28 Additional structural differences exist, resulting in possible differential TLR3 isoforms. TLR3 transcripts are initiated in either exon 1 or exon 2 of the mouse, indicating different promoters not present in humans. 27 The cloning of a human TLR3 isoform 29 suggests an alternate, but previously unrecognized, splicing pathway. The observed species-specific LPS responsiveness in macrophages could be conferred by consensus motifs for NF-kB binding present in the murine TLR promoter, which are absent in human promoter. 28 This has been confirmed by later studies that demonstrate that species-specific differences in tissue expression and responses to LPS coincide with the presence of different evolutionary nonconserved promoter sequences in both species. However, despite the overall nonrelatedness of TLR3 promoter sequences, mRNA expression of both TLR3 orthologs was induced by IFNs, particularly by IFN-b. The basal and IFN-beinduced activation of promoters from both species largely depended on similar IFN regulatory factor (IRF) elements, which constitutively Total monkey-expressed TLR3 contains 905 residues, versus 889 residues for the human TLR3.",

Also, LPS specifically up-regulates TLR3 expression through the induction of autocrine/paracrine IFN-b. In humans, however, IFN-be induced up-regulation of TLR3 was blocked by pretreatment with LPS, despite the efficient induction of IRF-1. 28 A recent publication provides additional evidence for differential cytokine responses between mice and humans. 30 Exposure of human primary DCs to agonist dsRNA did not induce TNF-a, IL-6, or IL-8. In human macrophages, the anti-inflammatory cytokine, IL-10, was induced, but TNF-a and IL-6 were not induced. This effect was specific for human cells because TNF-a or IL-6 was induced by dsRNA in murine DCs. Moreover, there was differential regulation of NF-kB by murine versus human cells. As shown in numerous prior communications from other laboratories, it was demonstrated that NF-kB was activated by dsRNA in murine cells but is absent in human DCs and macrophages, as was IkBa degradation present in murine cells. 30 Differences between the ectodomain of humans and nonhuman primates (20 of 23 LLRs) provide a potential mechanism to explain the small differential toxicity between the species. Length disparities between the cytoplasmic signaling domain of rodents and nonhuman primates, compared with humans, may contribute to the small differences in toxicity observed between monkeys and humans. There have been numerous reports comparing species specificity of TLR responses, especially TLR3, including mouse/ human, 12,27,30,31 monkey/human, 32 and fish/Drosophila/ human. 5,6 A comparison of TLR2 and TLR4 agonists demonstrated similar cytokine levels in humans and chimpanzees versus baboons, consistent with total DNA sequence homologies and the small differences we observed between cynomolgus monkeys and humans. 33 Although universal TLR responses were largely conserved across primates, chimpanzee-specific immune signaling is enriched for HIVinteracting genes that influence HIV disease progression. 34 Differences exist in the primate phenotypic responses to TLR agonists.
