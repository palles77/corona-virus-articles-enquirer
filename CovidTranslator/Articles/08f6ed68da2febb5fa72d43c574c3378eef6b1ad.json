Today, young women are less exposed to infectious agents, and breast feeding is less common and of shorter duration. Therefore, mothers transfer fewer protective antibodies to their infants. The consequence is that newborns are not protected against various pathogens and diseases, including cytomegalovirus, influenza virus, group B streptococcus, hepatitis B virus, meningococcus (groups A, B, C, Y and W135), pertussis, respiratory syncytial virus and tetanus. With the exception of the hepatitis B virus vaccine and bacille Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) that in some countries are given at birth, present immunization schedules start mostly at two months of age 5, 6 . Consequently, the present immunization schedules do not induce protection against the majority of these diseases until the fifth month of life or later. This leaves a period of vulnerability during the first 4-6 months of life, which is associated with significant mortality and morbidity. A recent increase in the frequency of pertussis cases and subsequent mortality in infants younger than 5 months is an example of this trend 7 .",

Although these schedules are designed to induce protective immunity early in life, they are not optimal for effective priming of the stillimmature immune system. Better priming, and different regimes, such as immunization at 3 and 5 months with a booster at 12 months may be considered. We need, however, to ensure that maternal immunization does not interfere with infant vaccination, since it is well known that the presence of maternal antibodies can prevent the infants from mounting optimal immune responses against live-attenuated viral vaccines, such as that used for measles, by interfering with viral replication. These effects are usually not present, even if in some cases they have been reported for inactivated vaccines, such as wholecell pertussis, and therefore their presence needs to be assessed for each new vaccine 10 .",

One example of a licensed adjuvant that has been efficiently used to boost immune responses in the elderly is the oil-in-water emulsion MF59 (Novartis), which is licensed for use as an adjuvanted seasonal influenza vaccine in European countries and in several other countries and has been shown to reduce hospitalization in the elderly 11 .

The risk of most cancers increases with age and the question is whether we can prevent or delay the age at which cancers strike. Tumours caused by infectious agents, such as certain liver 12 , cervical 13 and stomach 14 cancers, can be eliminated by preventing infection through vaccination. In addition, some cancers that are not associated with infectious agents, such as breast, colorectal and prostate cancer, could be prevented by vaccination with self antigens that are preferentially expressed by the tumour cells. Antigens such as lactalbumin and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2; also known as neu and ERBB2) have been shown to work as vaccination targets in animal models of breast cancer. In addition, vaccines targeting mucin 1 (MUC1) have shown promise against colorectal cancer in early trials, and several antigens are being evaluated against prostate cancer 15 . These vaccines would induce protective immunity before tumour formation and should be able to provide early protection against emerging tumours.

This institute has a non-profit mission and is the first entity of this type set up by a vaccine company. The institute has access to all of the technologies and knowledge of the Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics Company. This is a unique asset that is not available to any of the public institutes and provides the potential to develop state-of-the-art, innovative vaccines. NVGH focuses on diarrhoeal diseases caused by Salmonella typhi, Salmonella paratyphi, Salmonella enterica, Salmonella typhimurium and Shigella spp. Less than three years after its establishment, NVGH has developed and tested in clinical Phase I and Phase II trials a conjugate vaccine against S. typhi and has a vaccine against S. paratyphi in late preclinical studies.",

            "text": "In most cases, emerging infections require the fast development of new vaccines, and novel adjuvants have a key role in this. A great example has been the recent pandemic influenza caused by the H1N1 virus. In this instance, the availability of licensed oil-in-water emulsion adjuvants, such as MF59 and AS03 (GlaxoSmithKline) (see TABLE 1 on licensed adjuvants), allowed the production of more doses of vaccine, by reducing the quantity of antigen needed in each vaccine dose, and resulted in an effective vaccine for all age groups. An additional benefit of adjuvants is the possibility to anticipate pandemics. For instance, today we have the possibility to prevent the risk of avian influenza by priming the population with an adjuvanted vaccine containing an H5N1 strain 22, 23 or by vaccinating against H2N2, an old virus for which humans no longer have any immunity. This virus still circulates in birds and pigs, from which it could cross the species barrier and be newly introduced into humans, as has happened for H1N1 in 2009 (REF. 24 ). However, overall, even expanded cell culture production capacities and the use of adjuvants would not suffice to produce vaccine for the entire world population of approximately seven billion people in a timely manner in the case of a new and rapidly spreading pandemic disease agent. Therefore, the continued research into novel technologies, such as recombinant, vectored, nucleic-based and synthetic vaccines, remains a priority.",

            "text": "Infectious diseases can be a major cause of poverty. A study published in Science in 2008 (REF. 25) found that, in sub-Saharan Africa, when a case of meningococcal meningitis strikes a family, the entire family income of several years can be spent to take care of the sick family member. This causes a spiral of poverty from which the family will never recover. Conversely, in cases in which families remained free from infectious diseases, they could build their own sustainable economic basis. In his recent speech addressing the world health assembly, Bill Gates said that \"healthy people can drive thriving economies\" (REF. 26 ). Vaccines are by far the most effective tools to quickly eliminate infectious diseases in low-income countries and provide them the opportunity to fight poverty. There are many examples, such as the meningococcus C vaccination campaign in the United Kingdom 27 and the recent vaccination against meningococcus A in Africa 28 , in which successful vaccination campaigns have eliminated diseases in entire countries within one year. A number of vaccines are needed to help fight poverty in low-income countries (FIG. 2b) . Some of these vaccines are already available, or soon will be, in high-income countries, including vaccines against hepatitis A virus, hepatitis B virus, influenza virus, meningococcus (serogroups A, B, C, Y and W135), rabies, rotavirus and yellow fever virus. Other vaccines that may not be necessary for high-income societies but that are urgently needed in lowincome countries, include vaccines against cholera, dengue, ETEC, Japanese encephalitis virus, hepatitis E, malaria, meningococcus X, parasitic infections, Salmonella typhi, Salmonella paratyphi, Salmonella typhimurium, Salmonella enterica, Shigella spp. and tuberculosis. Today, there are two main obstacles to the development of vaccines for lowincome countries. First, our society has no mechanism to develop those vaccines that are only needed in low-income countries and for which there is no market in high-income countries. Second, those vaccines for which there is also a medical need in high-income countries are optimized mostly for the medical needs of these countries, and they are suboptimal for the medical needs of low-income countries. For instance, polio and rotavirus vaccines are less effective in the developing world. Furthermore, these vaccines only became available in low-income countries 10-20 years after their introduction in high-income countries.",

Their missions and activities are described in BOX 2. Progress has also been made in developing mechanisms to accelerate the availability of existing vaccines to low-income countries. The most innovative mechanism is the pneumococcal Advanced Market Commitment (AMC) of the GAVI alliance, an initiative in which five countries (Canada, Italy, Norway, Russia and the United Kingdom) and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation committed US$1.5 billion to purchase the newly developed pneumococcus vaccine and make it available to those countries that cannot afford it. Although these initiatives show that we are making progress in the field, a much stronger coordination between public sector, private sector, regulatory bodies and funding agencies will be necessary to make an impact in the short term and capture the unique opportunity to provide good health for every human being.

The initiative led by Mark La Force involved the transfer of technology to the Serum Institute of India to develop and manufacture the meningococcus A conjugate vaccine. The vaccine (MenAfriVac (Serum Institute of India)) was prequalified by the WHO and, starting in December 2010, 19.5 million people were vaccinated in Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger 34 .

Clearly, vaccines to prevent tumours are still at an early stage in their development, and we are struggling to develop effective vaccines against several infectious agents, including HIV, tuberculosis and malaria. However, thanks to the revolutionary technologies of the past 20 years, vaccines have become much safer and it is now possible to develop vaccines against infectious agents or diseases that could not be effectively targeted using early vaccination methods(FIG. 3). For example, recombinant DNA technology made possible the development and large-scale manufacture of the hepatitis B vaccine; conjugation technology made possible the development of vaccines against H. influenzae type b, pneumo coccus and meningococcus; genomics has allowed the discovery of new antigens by reverse vaccinology and made possible the development of a vaccine against meningococcus B. Following this example, the genome approach provided promising antigen targets for vaccines against group B streptococcus, group A streptococcus and pneumococcus, as well as for antibioticresistant bacteria, such as S. aureus. Novel technologies, such as the virus-like particles that allowed the development of a vaccine against papilloma virus, nucleic acid vaccines and synthetic vaccines are promising to start a revolution in the vaccine field. Furthermore, scientists have made great progress in understanding the human immune system and in developing novel adjuvants. For more than 70 years, aluminium salts have been the only adjuvants licensed for human use worldwide. In the past decades, oil-in-water emulsions and liposome-based adjuvants have been licensed in Europe. AS04 (GlaxoSmithKline), an adjuvant composed of aluminium salt and the Tolllike receptor (TLR) agonist MPL, has been licensed for use in a vaccine against human papilloma virus(TABLE 1). In addition, several novel adjuvants targeting other TLRs, such as TLR9, TLR7 and TLR2, are in the advanced developmental stage29",
