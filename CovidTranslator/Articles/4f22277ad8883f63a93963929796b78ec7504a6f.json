Among these, pulmonary toxicity is considered the most frequent and serious extracardiac side-effect, since it may occur in various atypical forms and often limits the drug's clinical use. We encountered a 67-year-old white male patient with suspected amiodarone pneumonitis characterized by multiple lung nodules associated with pleural and pericardial effusion and peripheral neuropathy. Because differential diagnosis with pulmonary infectious diseases may be extremely difficult, the attending physician should therefore bear in mind the possibility of amiodarone pneumonitis whenever the drug is given.

Drug-induced abnormalities in cells and tissues arise, due to various pathological mechanisms, such as induction of phospholipidosis, immune-mediated hypersensitivity and free-radical toxicity (8) . Tissue deposits of the anti-arrhythmic drug are a major source of side effects (such as skin decoloration). Experimental data showed that vacuolar sequestration of amiodarone occurs at concentrations close to therapeutic levels, is mediated by V-ATPase and evolves towards persistent macroautophagy and phospholipidosis. This cytopathology is not cell type-specific, but tissue macrophages appear to be particularly susceptible (9) . Amiodarone interferes with the endocytic pathway, inhibits proteolysis, and causes the formation of vacuoles, but uptake and intracellular distribution of the drug, and functional consequences of amiodarone accumulation remain unclear still today. Recent in vitro studies demonstrated that amiodarone associates with different cell membranes, accumulates in acidic organelles, and inhibits the spreading of the coronavirus responsible for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) at a post-endosomal level (10) .",

Chest CT scan showed multiple lung nodules with pleuro-pericardial effusion and thoracic lymphadenopathies, and the disease was initially considered as community-acquired pneumonia. The co-presence of pulmonary masses, monolateral pleural effusion and enlarged mediastinic lymphonodes, and the failure of empirical antibiotic therapy lead us to consider pulmonary tuberculosis, but all microbiological searches were negative for mycobacteria and the Quantiferon-TB test was negative. Amiodarone toxicity was considered at second observation, when the patient presented with a recurrence of the previous thoracic symptoms after steroid discontinuation and a new symptom: perioral anesthesia. Amiodarone toxicity may also be observed in the neuromuscular system and is characterized by polyradiculoneuropathy; anesthesia or paresthesia are possible aspecific symptoms (1, 13) . Our patient presented with probable peripheric nerve involvement due to amiodarone toxicity: the anesthetic sensation in the perioral area resolved after discontinuation of the drug, as did all the other symptoms. Radiological findings and clinical symptoms of amiodarone-induced pulmonary toxicity are aspecific: our patient developed the most common symptoms as fever and chest pain, and the late peripheral nerve involvement led us to consider a toxic and non-infectious cause of the syndrome. The rapid disappearance of toxic effects after amiodarone discontinuation was certainly remarkable, because of the previous extended accumulation of the drug in tissues.",
