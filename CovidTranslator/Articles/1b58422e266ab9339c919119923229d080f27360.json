This study aimed to identify the diagnosis based on clinical variables to differentiate pleural tuberculous exudates from other pleural effusions. We also investigated the role of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and matrix metalloproteinase (MMPs) in the pathogenesis of pleural exudates. Experimental design: The major components in RAS and extracellular matrix metabolism, including angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), ACE2, MMP-2 and MMP-9 activities, were measured and compared in the patients with transudative (n = 45) and exudative (n = 80) effusions. The exudative effusions were come from the patients with tuberculosis (n = 20), pneumonia (n = 32), and adenocarcinoma (n = 28). Results: Increased ACE and equivalent ACE2 activities, resulting in a significantly increased ACE/ACE2 ratio in exudates, were detected compared to these values in transudates. MMP-9 activity in exudates was significantly higher than that in transudates. The significant correlation between ACE and ACE2 activity that was found in transudates was not found in exudates. Advanced analyses showed significantly increased ACE and MMP-9 activities, and decreased ACE2 activity in tuberculous pleural effusions compared with those in pneumonia and adenocarcinoma effusions. The results indicate that increased ACE and MMP-9 activities found in the exudates were mainly contributed from a higher level of both enzyme activities in the tuberculous pleural effusions. Conclusion: Interplay between ACE and ACE2, essential functions in the RAS, and abnormal regulation of MMP-9 probably play a pivotal role in the development of exudative effusions. Moreover, the ACE/ACE2 ratio combined with MMP-9 activity in pleural fluid may be potential biomarkers for diagnosing tuberculous pleurisy.",

Several diseases such as congestive heart failure, liver cirrhosis, tuberculosis, adenocarcinoma, and pneumonia are common diseases that cause pleural effusions, but there is no rapid and accurate diagnostic method for pleural effusion. Conventional diagnosis of tuberculous pleurisy is based on pleural fluid cytology, culture of pleural effusions, and pleural biopsy tissue culture, but these methods have very low sensitivity and recognised limitations in clinical use, and they usually require weeks for a positive culture report [1] . Therefore, a reliable clinical marker providing simple, rapid, and accurate diagnosis is required for patients with pleural effusion.",

Recently, a local tissue-based RAS has also been described and appears to play a key role in injury/repair responses [2, 3] . The expression of RAS components and the elevation of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) in a number of lung diseases suggest the existence of a pulmonary RAS and that angiotensin II (Ang II) could mediate, at least in part, the response to lung injury. The central role of ACE is to generate Ang II from Ang I. Ang II is a key effector peptide of RAS that causes vasoconstriction and exerts multiple biological functions. Ang II can also cause the development of interstitial fibrosis via physiological regulation of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) expression and/or activation [4] .",

ACE2 reduces the generation of Ang II by catalysing the conversion of Ang I to Ang1-9 and facilitating hydrolysis of Ang II to Ang1-7. Ang1-7 has been recognised as a potential endogenous inhibitor of the classical RAS cascade [7] . Hence, the ACE2\uf02dAng1-7 axis may be an important negative modulator of Ang II bioactivity, counteracting the effects of ACE in determining net tissue Ang II levels. Abnormally elevated ACE combined with decreased ACE2 expression may be involved in fibrotic processes in vitro and in vivo, and the mechanism may involve expression and activation of specific MMPs [8] . Recently, abnormal pleural MMP levels, e.g., MMP-2 and MMP-9, have been reported, and the association between MMPs and development of pleurisy has been investigated [9, 10, 11] .",

Enzyme activity was expressed as ng\u00b7ml -1 . [13] . The assay was performed in a micro-quartz cuvette with 20 \u03bcl pleural fluid, 50 \u03bcM fluorogenic substrate and protease inhibitor cocktail (1:200; Sigma-Aldrich) in a final volume of 100 \u03bcl in ACE or ACE2 assay buffer. The reaction was followed kinetically for 1 hour using a fluorescence reader at an excitation wavelength of 330 nm and an emission wavelength of 390 nm. Data were fitted and plotted using Grafit v.4.0 (Sigma-Aldrich), and enzyme activity was expressed as RFU\u00b7h -1 \u00b7ml -1 . Parallel samples were incubated with the above-mentioned reaction mixture in the presence of 1 \u03bcM captopril (Sigma-Aldrich), a specific ACE inhibitor for determining specific ACE activity, or 1 \u03bcM DX600 (AnaSpec), a specific ACE2 inhibitor for determining specific ACE2 activity.",

            "text": "It is interesting that significantly increased ACE activity combined with markedly decreased ACE2 activity was measured in tuberculous effusions. This result confirms that abnormal RAS metabolism in pleural spaces may be related to tuberculous pleurisy. It was reported that overexpression of ACE2 may inhibit MMP-9 activity [19] , and ACE2 deficiency leads to increased MMP-9 levels [20] . In inflammatory signalling pathways study, Ang II could stimulate human monocytic U-937 cells to increase MMP-9 expression and activity significantly via activated NF-\u03baB, JNK, and p38 [21] . The ACE inhibitor, captopril, was administrated to isoprenaline-induced left ventricular fibrosis rats and showed that captopril significantly enhanced the isoprenaline-induced myocardial fibrosis and augmented the isoprenaline-induced MMP-9 expression [22] . In addition, ACE2 and Ang 1-7, the regulators in RAS opposed Ang II effect, could affect MMP-9 expression. Overexpression of ACE2 reduces the invasive ability in vitro according to the down-regulation of MMP-2 and MMP-9 [23] . Ang 1-7 revealed the anti-migration and anti-invasion effect mediated through inactivation of the PI3K/Akt, P38 and JNK signal pathways to reduce the expression and activity of MMP-2 and MMP-9 [24] . According to our results, we conclude that reduction in ACE2 along with induction of MMP-9 activity occurred. Our observations of decreased ACE2 and increased MMP-9 activity in tuberculous effusions confirm this conclusion.",

            "text": "A number of studies have indicated that the ACE-Ang II axis and ACE2-Ang1-7 axis not only regulate the metabolism of ECM proteins, but also modulate MMP expression and activity levels [8] . MMPs have been implicated in the pathogenesis of various lung diseases, including pleural effusions [25, 26] . The activity of MMPs within the pleural space may play a role in the formation of pleural effusions by altering the integrity of the mesothelial and endothelial cell layers and by increasing vascular permeability [10, 27] . Proteolysis by MMPs may be involved in the formation of pleural effusions by increasing vascular permeability, and thus by facilitating fluid influx into the pleural space [28] . Therefore, the presence and enzymatic activities of MMPs have been identified in pleural effusions [15, 25, 29] . Previous studies have shown that the expression of MMPs in the pleural space is altered in a variety of inflammatory and malignant diseases, suggesting that certain members of the MMP family may participate in the formation of pleural effusions [10, 15, 29] . Tissue damage is a characteristic manifestation of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. Proteolysis by macrophage-secreted proteases has been implicated in such destructive processes. In this regard, the proteolytic action of MMPs may be involved in the pathogenesis of tuberculosis, like many other diseases associated with tissue destruction. Several studies have reported that macrophages and monocytes release MMP-9 in response to tuberculosis or its cellular components [30, 31] . Studies have evaluated MMPs in tuberculous pleural effusions and found that the MMP activity in pleural fluid are higher in patients with tuberculosis compared with patients with transudative effusions [10, 32] . Our results are in agreement with the above findings, as the MMP-9 activity was highest in tuberculous effusions among the exudates we examined.",

In the RAS, ACE2/Ang-(1-7) axis has been recently highlighted as the counter balancing arm of the RAS to the ACE/Ang II axis. The regulatory mechanisms focused on the alternating ACE and ACE2 regulation are still lack; therefore, the mechanism of reduced ACE2 found in the pleural effusion of patients with tuberculosis remains to be further explored.",
