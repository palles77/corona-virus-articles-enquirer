This paper will attempt to estimate global infection rates and potential resultant mortality in the absence of effective treatment and/or vaccination. Calculations are based on World Health Organisation data from Wuhan in China: 14% of infected cases are severe, 5% require intensive care and 4% die. Estimated infection rates and mortality rates at the level of continents and some individual countries (when these are of sufficient size) are tabulated. This pandemic may cause close to half a billion deaths, i.e. 6% of the global populationand potentially more. At the risk of sounding sensational, but with a sober sense of realism, healthcare risks being plunged into the Middle-Ages if the public do not do their part. Infection cannot occur in the absence of contact. The only way to mitigate these numbers is to apply social distancing and take the standard precautions so frequently reiterated by Public Health: hand washing, avoid touching the face and so on. These measures are crucial as the human cost is going to be unthinkable even in the best-case scenarios that epidemiologists are modelling.",

(9) Severity is associated with increasing age and co-morbidities such as chronic heart and lung disease.(9) This virus is highly contagious with an R0 of \u22653 i.e on average it appears that each case infects some 3 others. This sets off a chain reaction, in this particular case, with a doubling time of one week or less, so that populations reach 60-80% infection rates. It is naturally difficult to estimate rates as quite a few individuals are infected and remain well (especially children) but are contagious. (9) For this reason, unless large proportions of populations are tested, we cannot possibly accurately estimate the total that have actually contracted the disease. (8) J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Draconian containment measures in China have reduced new cases by more than 90%. (10) This has not been the case elsewhere, and Italy has been severely affected with the number of patients infected since February following an exponential trend.(10) Intensive care units have been overwhelmed, with the bottleneck being availability of ventilators to tide critically ill patients over their intensive care stay. (10) This had led to suggestions that multiple patients could be ventilated with one machine, effectively multiplying intensive care capacity to deal with such -surges\u2016. (11) The careful application of basic containment measures cannot be overestimated: hand washing with soap and water, avoiding touching the face and social distancingstaying home, avoiding crowds and refraining from touching one another.",

(13) The situation may be even more dire in low income regions with fewer health care resources, such as Africa, where the relatively high prevalence of HIV, tuberculosis and other pathogens might not only serve as additional co-morbidities for COVID-19 infected individuals, but also contribute to diagnostic uncertainty.(13)",
