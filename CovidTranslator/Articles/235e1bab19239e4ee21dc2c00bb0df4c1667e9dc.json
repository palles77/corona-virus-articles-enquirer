Although an important route of disease transmission, our understanding of the process of airborne transmission is rudimentary for most infectious agents. In large part, this is due to technical challenges in achieving quantitative estimates of excretion, dissemination, stability, and probability of infection by exposure dose.",

Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) an enveloped RNA virus in the family Arteriviridae (Cavanagh, 1997) with a recognized potential for airborne transmission was used to validate the method. Veterinary Microbiology 133 (2009) This paper describes a method to provide improved probability estimates that exposure to a specific dose of an airborne infectious pathogen will result in animal infection. Individual animals were exposed to a specific dose of airborne pathogen. Following exposure, animals were individually housed and monitored for evidence of infection. The detection of specific antibodies and/or the pathogen in diagnostic specimens was evidence that the exposure dose resulted in infection. If replicated over a range of doses, the results can be used to derive a dose-response curve for a variety of animal species and infectious pathogens. This information is useful in estimating the likelihood of infection associated with exposure to airborne infectious microorganisms. Applications include predicting the risk of transmission associated with exposure to airborne pathogens, modeling the transmission of airborne pathogens, and determining requirements for effective exposure doses for vaccines delivered in aerosols.",

Seven replicates composed of 10 pigs per replicate were conducted. Within each replicate, 9 pigs were exposed to specific doses of airborne PRRSV. One pig served as an environmental sentinel, i.e., was in the room throughout the time treatments were administered, but was not intentionally exposed to PRRSV. Following treatment, pigs were housed individually to preclude transmission among animals. Serum samples collected at 0, 5, and 10 days post inoculation were assayed for the presence of PRRSV by virus isolation (VI) and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to determine whether the exposure resulted in infection. The proportion of pigs infected at each exposure dose was used to derive the dose-response curve.",

Historically, most transmission experiments in aerobiology have focused on testing whether the pathogen of interest could be transmitted via aerosol, i.e., sentinel animals became infected by exposure or not. A variety of experimental designs have been used to that end, but most have failed to provide for an estimate of the exposure dose. In addition, this ''animal in a box'' approach usually fails to take into account a variety of factors that affects exposure doses, e.g., differences in excretion rates of infected donor animals (Alexandersen et al., 2003) , respiratory tidal volumes of the host animal (Alexandersen et al., 2002) , sedimentation and/or dilution rates of airborne particles (Morawska, 2006) , rate of airborne pathogen inactivation (Hermann et al., 2007) , and air sampling methods which produce inconsistent estimates of pathogen concentration (Bourgueil et al., 1992) . Consequently, descriptive transmission experiments are difficult to interpret or apply to the field. Thus the objective of this paper was to describe an improved methodology for calculating the probability that a dose of airborne pathogen will result in animal infection. To accurately calculate exposure dose, the volume of air respired by the animal during the exposure period is measured and multiplied by the concentration of aerosolized pathogen per unit of air. The method described applies several solutions to the problem of arriving at a precise estimate of exposure dose.",

Rotation of the DAT, typically 3-5 revolutions per minute (rpm), reduces the rate of pathogen-contaminated droplet loss through sedimentation (Goldberg et al., 1958; Songer, 1967; Sattar et al., 1987) . Although particle suspension is maximized, physical loss of airborne pathogen within the DAT over time must be monitored in order to differentiate inactivation of infectious pathogen from sedimentation of particles. Depending on the pathogen, this can be done by testing samples collected at uniform intervals using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Alternatively, an inert dye, e.g., Rhodamine B, can be incorporated into the suspension fluid containing the pathogen at the time of aerosolization. The decline in the concentration of pathogen or dye in the air within the DAT reflects physical sedimentation (Hermann et al., 2007) . Pathogen infectivity can be preserved by maintaining the DAT at a temperature appropriate for pathogen stability. For example, in this study PRRSV virus infectivity was preserved by holding the DAT at \u00c019 8C (Hermann et al., 2007) .",
