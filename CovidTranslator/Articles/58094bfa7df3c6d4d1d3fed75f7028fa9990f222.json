This change has been driven by many factors, but most importantly by effective antiviral therapies. For many years, conventional virus isolation was the mainstay of viral diagnosis since it was sensitive and \"open-minded.\" However, cell culture is a specialized technique that requires highly skilled personnel. In addition, growth in conventional cell culture entails an inherent delay that limits its clinical impact. Although rapid culture and viral antigen methods detect fewer pathogens and are less sensitive than conventional culture, both require less expertise and have greatly reduced time to result. In the previous edition of this text, nucleic acid hybridization was highlighted; however it was more esoteric and expensive than other methods, yet not more sensitive and thus had limited clinical application.",

As the variety of available test methods and commercial products proliferate, the challenge for clinicians and laboratories is selecting which tests to utilize in which clinical scenarios, and understanding how to interpret the results. Each test modality has advantages and limitations (Table 5 .1), which will be discussed in this chapter, with special attention to neurologic disease.

In an idealized viral infection ( Fig. 5.1 ), viral replication, clinical symptoms, the appearance of immunoglobulin M (IgM) and IgG antibodies, the elimination of virus, and resolution of disease occur in a predictable progression. When disease is a consequence of viral replication and host cell lysis, diagnostic efforts should be focused on detection of virus, and samples should be collected as early as possible in illness when virus titers are maximal. Alternatively, some disease processes are mediated by the host response to viral infections, and detection of antibody is key. Viruses associated with immunemediated diseases include Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), and parvovirus B19. Unfortunately, there are important deviations from the scenario of acute infection progressing to viral clearance, such as viral persistence, latency, reactivation, and late disease. Thus the pattern for a particular virus, as well as the immune competence of the host, should be considered when ordering tests and interpreting the results.",

The recognition that viruses could be propagated in cultured human and animal cells led to the Nobel prize for Enders, Weller, and Robbins, and isolation in cell culture became the gold standard for viral diagnosis (Mortimer, 2009) . A variety of different cell lines are needed to culture a broad spectrum of clinically significant viruses (Landry, 2009a) . In the clinical laboratory, three basic categories of cell lines are used: primary, diploid, and continuous or heteroploid (Table 5 .2). Most laboratories performing conventional viral culture will inoculate a clinical specimen into two or three different cell lines depending on the viruses sought (Leland and Ginocchio, 2007) . Cultures are incubated and monitored for 1-3 weeks for the appearance of characteristic viral cytopathic effects (CPE) (Fig. 5.2A ). Time to detection of CPE in conventional culture is determined by the virus inoculum, the growth pattern of the specific virus, the cell line(s) inoculated, whether the culture is rotated, the temperature of incubation, and the frequency of examination. If CPE is seen, the virus isolate is identified most commonly by immunofluorescence (IF) staining of the cultured cells.",

An acid lability test can be used to differentiate between rhinoviruses (acidlabile) and enteroviruses (acid-stable). Advantages of conventional viral culture include the ability to detect many viruses, to obtain a viral isolate for Unfortunately, identification of viruses by conventional culture can take several weeks due to slow growth of some viruses and low viral inocula. Accurate interpretation of CPE requires a technically skilled and experienced laboratory staff that may not be available. When the volume of sample for testing is limited, for example, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), fewer cell types can be inoculated and the yield of conventional culture is reduced (Landry et al., 2003) . In addition CSF contaminated with blood may be toxic for cultured cells, some viruses cannot be grown using common cell lines, and culture for some viruses is restricted to higher biosafety-level facilities. Indeed, laboratories should be notified promptly when there is the possibility of recovering biosafety level 3 or 4 viruses, such as some arbovirus and zoonotic viruses (http://www.cdc.gov/biosafety/publications/), and alternative tests should be selected.",

For arboviruses, detection of IgM antibodies in CSF is preferred to molecular tests for viral nucleic acid, although use of both tests is necessary for maximum sensitivity (Prince et al., 2009 ). Detection of virus-specific IgG in CSF requires samples collected later in the course of infection than for IgM and exclusion of passive transfer of IgG from blood into CSF. IgG molecules more easily diffuse across the blood-brain barrier, and their presence in the CSF may simply reflect high serum antibody levels. Thus paired CSF and serum samples must be tested for antibody to the suspected pathogen, as well as to a control virus pathogen (Andiman, 1991) . While commonly used for diagnosis of HSV encephalitis in the past (Aurelius et al., 1993) , most CSF antiviral IgG testing has been replaced by IgM testing or by PCR.",

The term \"solid-phase immunoassay\" refers to the immobilization of an antigen or antibody on a solid phase such as a microtiter plate or microparticle. These assays take several forms (Fig. 5.3 ), but the most common type of SPIA is the non-competitive indirect enzyme immunoassay (EIA) (Fig. 5 .3A). In indirect EIAs, patient serum is allowed to react with immobilized viral antigens, and the presence of bound virus-specific antibodies is detected using an MAb coupled to an enzyme (e.g., alkaline phosphatase or horseradish peroxidase) that, in the presence of an appropriate substrate, produces a colorimetric or fluorescent signal whose intensity is directly related to the amount of antibody present in the original sample. While the enzyme-coupled antibody could be specific for any isotype, nearly all non-competitive EIAs use an IgG-specific antibody for detection. Most commonly used assays to detect antivirus IgM have a different format (see below).",

Virus-specific antibody present in the patient serum competes with the enzyme-coupled antibody, and the resulting signal is indirectly related to the amount of antibody present in the patient's specimen. This type of assay is able to detect both IgM and IgG in the same assay, and is most commonly used in the HBV core total 128 D.R. PEAPER AND M.L. LANDRY antibody and hepatitis A virus (HAV) total antibody assays. Another format that allows detection of IgM as well as IgG is the \"double-antigen sandwich\" (Fig. 5 .3C). Immobilized viral antigens bind antiviral antibodies in the patient sample. The bound antibodies are then detected by an enzyme-coupled viral antigen rather than by an anti-IgG conjugate, followed by the addition of a substrate. A number of advances in immunoassays over the past 20 years are evident in the evolution of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) serologic tests. The first generation of HIV assays were performed manually using microplates or beads in tubes, and the target antigens were derived from whole-virus lysates. To increase specificity, second-generation assays used recombinant proteins or synthetic peptides as antigen sources, and included HIV-2. Third-generation HIV assays include antigens to detect group O variants of HIV-1, and these employ the double-antigen sandwich design that detects IgM as well as IgG and reduces the antibody-negative window period to 3-4 weeks (Burgisser et al., 1996) . Finally, the fourth-generation HIV assays, which have been available in Europe but first became available in the United States in 2010, detect HIV p24 antigen as well as anti-HIV-1/HIV-2 antibodies (Miedouge et al., 2011) . Antigen-antibody combination assays allow for early detection of infection before antibodies emerge and shorten the window period to approximately 2 weeks (Sickinger et al., 2004; Branson, 2007) .",

For traditional microplate-based serology assays, samples are batchtested on a plate and progress as a unit through the reagent additions, incubations, washes, and detection steps in order to reduce costs and increase efficiency. One batch must be completed, which requires 3-4 hours, before the next batch can be loaded on to the instrument. Samples may be held in a queue for several days until a sufficiently large number of specimens are available to test. In contrast, random-access platforms allow for samples tested for a variety of analytes to be loaded and tested continuously, dramatically reducing turnaround time. Random access or \"on-demand\" methods often use chemiluminescent labels which produce light when excited by chemical energy. Chemiluminescent immunoassays (CLIA) are more sensitive, less prone to interference, and have a lower background signal than EIA or IF (Kim et al., 2008) . Random-access instruments are also being developed for molecular testing (see below).

Methods to remove interfering IgG and rheumatoid factor from sera prior to testing have been developed (Martins et al., 1995) . An alternative to pretreatment of serum is the IgM class capture assay, also called reverse capture or m capture ( Fig. 5.3D ). In this method, anti-IgM is immobilized on the solid phase, and binds all IgM antibodies in the patient's serum regardless of specificity. Viral antigens are then incubated with the bound IgM, and enzyme-coupled virus-specific antibodies are used to detect bound viral antigens. IgM capture assays are considered the most sensitive and specific format (Besselaar et al., 1989) .

            "text": "Viruses are too small to be seen by conventional light microscopy, and electron microscopy (EM) is the only technique that allows for the direct visualization of viruses (Biel and Gelderblom, 1999) . Recognition of viral morphology and ultrastructural details of virus-infected cells is the basis of viral identification by EM and requires substantial expertise. The two EM methods used for viral identification are negative staining and thin sectioning. Contrast between viruses and the background in EM images depends on differences in the electron density of the structures being examined. In negative staining, electron-dense, fine-grained, heavy-metal salts are added to samples and staining material accumulates around the virus and within features of the viral capsid or envelope. Areas lacking stain appear white against a black background, and viral structures that have accumulated stain may appear as different shades of gray. Approximately 10 6 virions/mL are needed for visualization by negative staining. Some specimens may require high-speed centrifugation to concentrate viruses, and vesicular fluid, stool, CSF, tissue culture supernatants, urine, and serum are all amenable to EM analysis. In immune EM, addition of specific antibody leads to aggregation of viral particles, facilitates visualization, and led to the discovery of many gastroenteritis viruses in stool extracts. Thin sectioning is performed on tissue biopsies or cells when histopathologic findings are suggestive of a viral infection. After fixation and embedding in polymer resin, samples are sectioned, analogous to paraffin-embedded tissues in pathology, but the prepared sections are much thinner. Staining is then performed using heavy-metal salts. EM for viral diagnosis is offered by very few laboratories. However, EM has proved invaluable in the identification of novel and unculturable viruses, including the recently described severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (Drosten et al., 2003; Ksiazek et al., 2003) .",

When a novel variant emerges, such as pandemic influenza A H1N1, the performance of antigen tests for the detection of the new strain is not known, and indeed for pandemic H1N1 influenza, was lower than for seasonal influenza (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2009; Ginocchio et al., 2009; Landry and Ferguson, 2010) .

IF detection of CMV matrix protein pp65 in the nuclei of peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL; CMV pp65 antigenemia) was the first CMV viral load test in blood and retains some advantages over molecular methods (van der Bij et al., 1988; Gerna et al., 1992; Landry and Ferguson, 1993) . DFA can be performed on many cellular sample types, especially nasopharyngeal washes, aspirates or swabs, bronchoalveloar lavage, skin and mucosal lesions, PBL and tissue biopsies. Cells collected from a patient are pelleted by centrifugation, applied to glass slides, fixed, stained with antibodies coupled to fluorophores, then examined under a fluorescence microscope for virus-specific staining (Fig. 5.4 A and B) . The color and intensity of the stain, the distribution of viral proteins within the infected cell, the infection of specific cell types, and the number of positive cells all impact the interpretation (Landry, 2009b) . For CMV antigenemia, 200 000 PBL are applied per slide and the number of positive cells is counted. Some reagents are comprised of a pool of MAbs to different viruses that cause a similar clinical syndrome; thus a single reagent can screen for multiple viruses in a single cell spot. Examples include respiratory virus screening reagents for seven or eight respiratory viruses (RSV, influenza A and B, parainfluenza types 1, 2, 3, adenovirus, and hMPV) (Landry and Ferguson, 2000) . If the screening reagent is positive, additional slides are stained to identify the specific pathogen, using either single fluorescein-labeled antibodies or dualantibody reagents with two different fluorophore labels. Dual fluorophore-labeled antibody pools can also be used to detect and differentiate between HSV and VZV (Brumback et al., 1993) .",

Antigen-antibody complexes move along the strip by capillary action until captured in the test area by virus-specific antibodies, leading to the appearance of a visible band (Fig. 5.5 ). Excess labeled antibodies continue to migrate up the strip until captured in the control area by anti-IgG. IC assays have largely replaced membrane EIA and other rapid test formats since IC simply requires the addition of the sample followed by setting of a timer to 10-20 minutes depending on the test. In contrast to EIA, there are no reagent additions or wash steps (Newton et al., 2002; Landry et al., 2004) . IC tests require no equipment and can be performed by non-laboratory personnel. Limitations of IC include low sensitivity compared to other detection methods (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2009; Ginocchio et al., 2009; Uyeki et al., 2009 ) and ability to detect only one or two different viruses (influenza A and B, or RSV).

Thus the extraction method used can greatly impact the sensitivity of the final result. Traditional nucleic acid isolation techniques using phenol/chloroform have been supplanted by other methods. Single-sample spin column kits isolate either DNA or RNA by binding to a resin following alkaline lysis of cells. After washing, nucleic acids are eluted into an aqueous solution. Binding of nucleic acids to silica beads in solution, followed by washes and centrifugation to remove impurities, then elution into a buffer is another common strategy.

However, Taq polymerase is relatively stable at the higher temperature (approximately 95 C) required to \"melt\" the larger strands of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) generated by PCR into single strands. The thermostability of Taq polymerase allows for multiple amplification cycles consisting of raising the temperature to 95 C to melt dsDNA, lowering the temperature to 55 C to allow primer annealing, and raising the temperature to 72 C for polymerase activity.

A small volume of the PCR reaction is loaded on to an agarose gel impregnated with ethidium bromide, a highly carcinogenic fluorescent molecule that tightly binds DNA, and products are separated based on the length of the dsDNA fragment. Amplified PCR products are then visualized as distinct bands of an appropriate size after illumination with ultraviolet light. Alternatively, amplicons can be transferred by Southern blot or spotted directly on to nitrocellulose for hybridization with a specific probe. Conventional PCR requires relatively inexpensive thermocyclers and gel visualization systems. However, vials must be opened in order to remove an aliquot for detection, and this can aerosolize DNA amplicons, leading to contamination of instruments, surfaces, gloves, and clothing. This presents a high risk for contamination of subsequent PCR reactions, and unidirectional work flow protocols using three separate rooms for extraction, amplification, and detection are widely used in molecular laboratories. Another common strategy is substitution of uracil (dUTP) for thymidine (dTTP) in the reaction master mix to generate DNA amplicons containing uracil instead of thymidine. Subsequent addition of uracil-N-glycosylase (UNG) to all reactions prior to PCR will prevent uracil-containing amplicons, but not native DNA, from serving as templates for amplification (Pang et al., 1992) .",

PEAPER AND M.L. LANDRY DNA-binding dyes such as SYBR green, analogous to ethidium bromide in gel electrophoresis, or hybridization with fluorescent DNA probes (Livak et al., 1995; Wittwer et al., 1997) . Thus, real-time assays require the use of thermocyclers with built-in light sources, filters, and detectors. SYBR green and similar dyes become fluorescent upon DNA binding and have a higher affinity for dsDNA molecules. As the amount of dsDNA created by PCR increases, the fluorescent signal arising from the dyes also increases. These assays do not require a complementary DNA probe for detection, and could be beneficial for the detection of viruses with sequence variability. However, the dyes bind all dsDNA, including primer dimers and non-specifically amplified material, and this also renders SYBR dyes less amenable to multiplex assay development (see below).

TaqMan assays use a DNA probe that is complementary to a region of DNA in the amplified PCR product and labeled at the 5' and 3' ends with fluorophores of different excitation and emission spectra (a reporter and quencher). When the probe is intact, fluorescence is quenched. This is referred to as fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). When the target sequence is present, primers and probe anneal, and, as the primers extend, degradation of the TaqMan probe (also called hydrolysis probe) leads to separation of the reporter fluorophore from the quencher (Fig. 5.6A ). With each ensuing cycle of amplification, fluorescence accumulates until it crosses the threshold to positive at a specific cycle of amplification, also known as the cycle threshold or Ct value (Fig. 5.6B ). The Ct value provides an indication of the amount of viral target in the original sample: the lower the Ct value, the higher the viral load. When standards of known viral concentration are run in parallel with patient samples, absolute values for viral load can be calculated using a standard curve (Figs 5.6C and 5.7). FRET hybridzation probes, also referred to as LightCycler probes, and molecular beacons are two other common probe detection formats used in real-time PCR (Espy et al., 2006) .",

Both SYBR green and TaqMan assays can be performed on a variety of real-time PCR instruments, and these may vary in the speed at which they cycle, the reaction vessel used, and the number of samples that can be tested in a single run. The LightCycler instrument utilizes glass capillaries as reaction vessels to reduce the time required to raise and lower temperature for each amplification cycle, and thus shorten assay time. The Smartcycler also has a unique reaction vessel that allows faster cycling; in addition, each reaction in the 16-sample unit works as an independent thermocycler, so samples do not need to be batch-tested. Applied Biosystems instruments such as the ABI 7500 use 96-well plates for higher throughput, and a rapid-cycling option (ABI 7500 Fast Dx) that utilizes smaller reaction volumes is available.

            "text": "Several commercial platforms use non-PCR molecular techniques for viral diagnosis (Table 5 .3). Nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (NASBA) and transcription-mediated amplification (TMA) are highly related and demonstrate comparable performance to PCR assays (Guatelli et al., 1990; Giachetti et al., 2002) . NASBA and TMA both amplify an RNA target sequence, but, in their commercial applications, use different techniques to detect the amplified material, molecular beacons and hybridization protection assays (HPA), respectively (Giachetti et al., 2002; Landry et al., 2003) . Like TaqMan probes, molecular beacons 136 D.R. PEAPER AND M.L. LANDRY are oligonucleotide probes with reporter and quencher fluorophores at the 3' and 5' ends. Molecular beacons have areas of complementary DNA within the probe that lead to hairpin formation placing the fluorophores in close proximity leading to FRET and no signal. Upon DNA binding, the molecular probe unfolds, and the FRET is eliminated, leading to increasing signal. NASBA with molecular beacons is a real-time technique (Leone et al., 1998) . HPA uses a nucleic acid-binding acridinium ester that, in its unbound form, is inactivated by chemical treatment. When material is amplified by TMA, the acridinium ester hybridizes to the double-stranded nucleic acid and is protected from inactivation. Addition of an activating compound leads to the production of visible light from protected, nucleic acid-associated acridinium ester that is read by the instrument. HPA is an endpoint detection technique rather than real-time.",

LANDRY they offer, including sample type and volume, proper container, transport media or stabilizers if needed, transport temperature, and other special instructions. For optimal results, sample collection instructions should be strictly followed. Some general principles will be provided here. Nasopharyngeal swabs should be inserted deep into the nasopharynx, past the point of resistance, and rotated to collect ciliated cells. Lesions should be unroofed with a sterile needle or scalpel and cells at the base of the lesion collected. Vesicle fluid, which contains high titers of virus, can also be absorbed on to the swab. For viruses shed in stool, stool samples, which contain more virus, are preferred to rectal swabs. Samples submitted for culture require the most careful handling in order to preserve viral infectivity. Swabs and tissue biopsies are placed in viral transport media with antimicrobials to prevent drying and reduce overgrowth of bacterial and fungal pathogens. Body fluids, aspirates, washes, and stool samples should be placed in sterile containers. Transport of specimens at 4 C is preferred. Freezing samples at -20 C leads to loss of viral infectivity and should be avoided. Freezing at -70 C and subsequent thawing reduce infectivity for many enveloped viruses, and are only recommended if transport to the laboratory is delayed for several days. If rapid viral antigen detection kits are used, such as rapid influenza tests, the manufacturer's guidelines for sample type, collection device, and transport should be followed. Especially for non-amplified tests such as rapid flu tests, sample dilution in transport media should be minimized as dilution can further reduce already limited test sensitivity.",

DFA is a very valuable method when done well, due to its relative speed, multiplex capability, and greater sensitivity compared to other rapid antigen tests. Indeed, a single positive cell can be detected. DFA has also been shown to improve care and reduce costs (Barenfanger et al., 2000) .

When disease symptoms are immune-mediated, diagnosis by antibody response plays a central role. Examples include EBV, parvovirus B19, HAV, and HBV. Serologic tests have transitioned from manual, laboratory-developed tests using serial dilutions of serum, to commercial kits that test a single serum aliquot. Rather than whole virus grown in cell culture as the antigen source, current tests commonly use synthetic peptides or recombinant proteins to improve test specificity and reproducibility. Instrumentation allows automation, random access (on demand) or batched testing, and can interface directly with the laboratory computer system. In order to detect early HIV infections before IgG has developed, current SPIA formats allow detection of IgM as well as IgG in the same assay, or include antigen detection. Class capture has become the preferred test for IgM to reduce false positives and false negatives. Simple pointof-care tests for HIV antibody now allow results to be reported while the patient is still in the clinic. Nevertheless, it is important to remember that initial antibody tests may be negative, and a sample in the second week of illness, such as with West Nile virus IgM in CSF, may be needed to establish the diagnosis (Busch et al., 2008) . In addition, cross-reactivity among viruses in the same family can lead to misdiagnoses. For example, past infection or vaccination with a flavivirus can lead to spurious ELISA or IF antibody results for other flaviviruses, and PRNT may be needed to establish etiology. Primary infection with EBV can lead to a false-positive CMV IgM and vice versa; thus antibody to EB nuclear antigen to confirm a primary EBV infection or CMV viral load in blood to assess CMV activity may be needed for an accurate diagnosis.",

EBV is carried for life in lymphocytes and in the presence of CSF lymphocytosis and immunosuppression, EBV DNA can be detected in CSF but is not linked to disease (Davies et al., 2005) . Blood contamination of CSF can give rise to positive CSF PCR results that reflect viremia, not CNS infection. VZV can be detected in CSF in uncomplicated zoster with no CNS disease. HHV-6 can be found in high titer in the blood of persons without disease due to integration of the virus into the host cell chromosome of 0.5-1.0% of the population.
