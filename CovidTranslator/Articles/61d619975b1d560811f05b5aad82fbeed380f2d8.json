It provides evidence of the economy-wide impact of each approach, as well as the impact that vaccine development may have in reconciling the two objectives of minimising both the health and economic effects of a pandemic. A key consideration in this analysis is the role of public perception and confidence, expressed by \"prophylactic absenteeism,\" where healthy people avoid social contact, including going to work. This response is likely to emerge at higher case fatality rates and to be moderated by the availability of effective vaccines (the current strain of H1N1 influenza seems to be highly infectious but not very deadly, and this may explain its limited economic impact to date).",

Mitigation actions can also affect the labour supply by (a) reducing labour when people are kept away from the workplace to avoid infection or (b) by increasing labour supply compared with non-mitigated pandemic scenarios by reducing the number of infections and deaths 10 and reducing the extent to which people feel the need to engage in prophylactic absenteeism.",

Vaccine shelf life is currently about one year. 22 We assumed two vaccination strategies-a pre-pandemic vaccine with 20% efficacy and a matched vaccine with 40% efficacy (single dose) and 80% efficacy (double dose). 23 For all vaccines we assumed sufficient stocks for 60% coverage. Vaccination would have two potential impacts on a pandemic, reducing the number of infected individuals and moderating the extent of prophylactic absenteeism because people feel protected from infection.",

Our assumptions dictate that for such a serious pandemic the transition point would be passed, and the low, medium, and high infection scenarios yield reductions in gross domestic product of 6.0%, 7.4%, and 9.6%, respectively. School closure increases this impact by 0.63-0.77%, which is smaller than for the less severe scenarios as the mitigation impact of school closure reduces the severity of the disease. Pre-pandemic vaccine has some effect on reducing the impact of the Alternative scenarios Alternatives to these scenarios have also been modelled but are not reported in detail here. In brief, schools closing for about 95% of the 15 weeks of the pandemic's duration and assuming a mitigation equivalent to 2% if the clinical attack rate was 34%, as outlined by Ferguson et al, 10 produces a 2.5% further reduction in gross domestic product compared with our four week closure scenarios; it reduces the infection rates, but the dominance of the case fatality rate in determining the transition point is such that the degree of prophylactic absenteeism remains the same. Similarly, informal care by grandparents and friends, reducing the level of prophylactic absenteeism from 16.1% to 8.7%, 32 reduces the loss to gross domestic product by 0.56-0.58% in the four week school closure scenarios and by 1.8-2.0% in the longer closure scenario. Assuming the higher mitigation rate of 15% suggested by Cauchemez et al, 30 which would apply to longer school closure scenarios, the severity of the economic impact of school closures is reduced in proportion to the severity of the pandemic. This reduction is quite small-up to 0.25% of gross domestic product for non-extreme scenarios and up to 0.9% of gross domestic product in the most extreme and unmitigated scenario-so overall reductions in gross domestic product are still between 1% and 2% larger than with the four week school closure scenarios. School closure's failure to mitigate the impact of the disease despite the assumption of its efficacy is due to the large amount of absenteeism induced by school closures, which, in our model, is not affected by the clinical attack rate.",

School closure, and its related absenteeism, causes a notable increase in economic loss, and caution might therefore be advised in pursuing this policy when the case fatality rate is low. A pre-pandemic vaccine with moderate efficacy and 60% coverage could result in large relative savings for any low or high fatality pandemic of \u00a32.2bn-\u00a310.8bn, or \u00a320.2bn-\u00a339.0bn for extreme scenarios. A matched vaccine, even if only available in sufficient time for a single dose to be administered to 60% of the population, would result in substantially higher savings, in both low and high fatality scenarios, and a double dose of a matched vaccine could keep the loss in gross domestic product to below 3%, even with the most extreme pandemic and long school closureswhich is little more than half the impact of the current recession, although recovery from a severe flu event would probably be much more rapid. Estimates suggest that the planned H1N1 flu vaccination will cost about \u00a36 per person (www.bloomberg.com/apps/ news?pid=20601124&sid=auYQiQYJ.73I), yielding a total cost of about \u00a3792m, compared with savings that start from \u00a32.2bn for the mildest pandemic.
