Expression of the 3a protein has been demonstrated during both in vitro and in vivo infection. Here we present biochemical data to show that 3a is a novel coronavirus structural protein. 3a was detected in virions purified from SARS-CoV infected Vero E6 cells although two truncated products were present predominantly instead of the full-length protein. In Vero E6 cells transiently transfected with a cDNA construct for expressing 3a, a similar cleavage was observed. Furthermore, co-expression of 3a, membrane and envelope proteins using the baculovirus system showed that both full-length and truncated 3a can be assembled into virus-like particles. This is the first report that demonstrated the incorporation of 3a into virion and showed that the SARS-CoV encodes a novel coronavirus structural protein.",

A novel coronavirus was identified as the etiological agent of SARS [1] . Like all coronaviruses, the SARS-CoV genome encodes for four major structural proteins, nucleocapsid (N), spike (S), membrane (M), and envelope (E). The RNA is packaged by the N protein into a helical nucleocapsid [2] . The S protein, which forms morphologically characteristic projections on the virion surface, mediates binding to host receptors and membrane fusion [3] .",

Three groups have independently reported the expression of 3a in SARS-CoV infected cells [13] [14] [15] and it was also detected in a SARS-CoV infected patient\u00d5s lung specimen [14] . Antibodies against 3a were also found in convalescent patients [12, 14, 16] . 3a was localized in the perinuclear region and was also transported to the cell surface, where it could undergo internalization [13, 14] . It is tempting to postulate that 3a is a structural protein as only the coronavirus structural proteins, S, HE, and E, have been shown to be transported to the plasma membrane/cell surface [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] .",

As shown in Fig. 1A , a spe-cific protein band of 35 kDa was detected in cell lysates obtained from SARS-CoV infected cells but not in cell lysates from mock infected cells (lanes 1 and 2). Therefore, 3a was expressed in the SARS-CoV infected cells, which is consistent with previous studies [30] . The 3a protein was also specifically immunoprecipitated from the culture supernatant of SARS-CoV infected cells (Fig. 1A, lanes 3 and 4) , indicating that 3a protein was secreted into the culture supernatant. Consistently, Zeng et al. [15] recently reported the detection of disulfide-linked complexes of S and 3a in the culture supernatant of SARS-CoV infected cells. Four other proteins, with molecular weights less than 35 kDa, in the cell lysates also co-immunoprecipitated with 3a (Fig. 1A, lane 2) . The sizes of these proteins are 24, 20, 15, and 8 kDa and they could be host or viral proteins that bound to 3a or they could be cleaved/degraded forms of 3a. The smallest of these co-immunoprecipitated proteins (8 kDa) and another protein of 10 kDa that co-immunoprecipitated with 3a from the culture supernatant have similar molecular weight to that predicted for the E protein (Fig. 1A, lanes 2 and 4) . As the interaction between 3a and E has been previously demonstrated [13] , it is likely that the E protein (8 and 10 kDa in the cell lysate and culture supernatant, respectively) expressed in the infected cells has co-immunoprecipitated with 3a. Interestingly, the relative amount of E to 3a in the immuno-complexes from culture supernatant was significantly higher when compared to the cell lysate, suggesting that 3a may need to be complexed with E before secretion out of the cells, whilst there was a pool of free 3a intracellularly. The molar ratios of E:3a, as computed by quantification of the autoradiograph shown in Fig. 1A , were 3:2 in the culture supernatant and 7:8 in the cell lysate. Based on this assumption, we estimated that the molar ratio of E to 3a in the virion is 3:2. It should be noted that this is only an approximation and future analysis of highly purified virus samples by immunoprecipitation with specific monoclonal antibodies, as recently described for transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus by Escors et al. [31] , will be required to determine an accurate stoichiometric ratio of 3a in the virion relative to E and the other structural proteins.",

Due to the highly contagious nature of the SARS-CoV, it was not feasible to subject SARS-CoV to the standard sucrose gradient purification. Instead, the virus was subjected to size exclusion chromatography and the presence of virion in the eluted fractions was confirmed by electron microscopy studies (data not shown). As this was performed as part of a vaccine development program at the Wuhan Institute of Biological Products (China), infected cells were collected at late infection (90% CPE) in order to obtain the highest titer of virus. Western blot analysis showed that two truncated forms of 3a, 24 and 20 kDa, were detected in purified virion using specific anti-3a antibody (Fig. 1B, lane 3) . These two truncated forms of 3a may correspond to the two protein bands of the similar sizes observed in Fig. 1A (lane 2) . Curiously, the full-length 3a was not easily detectable although it was clear that the full-length 3a was expressed in and secreted from the infected cells at earlier phase of infection (50% CPE) (Fig. 1B, lane 2 and results above) . No cellular tubulin, which is highly abundant in the cell lysates, was associated with the purified virion (Fig. 1B, lanes  1-3) , indicating that the purification process successfully eliminated proteins that were not associated with the virion.",

Collectively, the probable explanation for our observation of only truncated forms of 3a in the virion is that the virion was purified from infected cells at a much later phase of infection and that 3a is sensitive to cleavage over time. Unfortunately, it was not possible to repeat the purification of virion from an earlier phase of infection as the incidents of laboratory acquired SARS-CoV infections [32] have led to a restriction on unnecessary protocols, like purification of virions that requires high virus titer and specialized instrumentations, using live SARS-CoV.",

Interestingly, both the full-length 3a and a truncated 3a product of 24 kDa were specifically observed in the infected insect cells (lane 1) but not in the control cells (lanes 2 and 3).

The S protein could also be incorporated into VLPs when it is expressed together with M and E [22, 23] . In order to determine if SARS-CoV 3a protein can be incorporated into VLPs, insect cells co-expressing 3a, M, and E were subjected to sucrose gradient centrifugation, followed by Western blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 3A , the 3a protein was found mainly in the fractions 17 and 18. The same fractions also contained the majority of the M and E proteins (Figs. 3B and C). Previously, electron microscopy showed that VLPs containing S were also found in fraction 17, which corresponded to 43% (w/w) sucrose and a density of 1.2 mg/ml [22] . Therefore, our data showed 3a, like the S protein, is not essential for the formation of VLPs but it is incorporated when present. In addition, both the full-length 3a and the truncated 3a were efficiently incorporated into VLPs, which is consistent with the observation of truncated 3a products in virions purified from SARS-CoV infected cells (Fig. 1B) . In the VLPs from insect cells (Fig. 3A) , the 3 forms of 3a observed were also similar in size to those observed in the purified virion, i.e., 35 kDa (and 32 kDa, which was not clearly resolved from the 35 kDa band) for full-length 3a, 24 and 20 kDa for the truncated products, indicating that the post-translational modifications of 3a in insect and mammalian cells were similar. However, the relative amounts of the different forms of 3a in virus or virus-like particles obtained from these 2 systems were quite different. In insect cells, the percentages of the 35, 24, and 20 kDa, products are 23%, 35%, and 42% respectively (Fig. 3A, fraction 17) . And in mammalian cells, the corresponding percentages are 7%, 32%, and 61% respectively (Fig. 1B, lane 3) . This indicates that the kinetics of processing as well as the incorporation into virions in insect and mammalian cells may not be identical.",

Interestingly, when Liu et al. [33] used phage-display technology to characterize B cell epitopes recognized by antibodies from SARS patients, they found one consensus motif VKIXN which corresponded uniquely to 18-22 amino acids of the N-terminus ectodomain of 3a. Detailed studies, like electron microscopy analysis, will be necessary to determine the precise topology of full-length 3a (and its truncated products) in virus particles. As 3a can interact with S, M, and E proteins [13, 15] , it is also critical to determine how these viral-viral interactions contribute to the incorporation of 3a and/or S into the virion. Interestingly, sequence comparison of isolates from different clusters of infection showed that both S and 3a [15, 34, 35] showed a positive selection during virus evolution. Collectively, these findings suggest that 3a could play important roles during viral infection, replication, and/or pathogenesis. Future studies will yield more information on the structural and functional significance of the incorporation of 3a into virions of SARS-CoV and such knowledge may have important implications for anti-viral or vaccine developments.
