Previous studies have shown that PEDV ORF3 encodes an ion channel protein. However, its influence on cell cycle and subcellular structure still require more research. In this study, we developed a Vero cell line that stably expresses PEDV ORF3 gene. Subcellular localization and influences of PEDV ORF3 on host cells were investigated. We further verified whether or not this gene enhances virus production. The results showed that PEDV ORF3 protein localizes in the cytoplasm and affects cell cycle progression by prolonging the S phase. In addition, the ORF3-expressing Vero cells had more vesicles than the host Vero cells. Furthermore, the attenuated PEDV rather than virulent PEDV could grow better in ORF3-expressing Vero cells. The expression level of the PEDV nucleocapsid protein also increased. These results provided information on the function of PEDV ORF3 and were helpful in understanding the mechanisms of PEDV replication.",

The genome of PEDV contains seven open reading frames (ORFs), which encodes three non-structural proteins (ORF1a, ORF1b, and ORF3) and four structural proteins (spike glycoprotein, envelope protein, membrane glycoprotein, and nucleocapsid protein), arranges in the order 5 0 -ORF1a/1b-S-ORF3-E-M-N-3 0 [7, 8] .

A continuous 49 or 51 nucleotide region is deleted within the ORF3 gene when PEDV is continuously passaged in cell culture, indicating a possible involvement in viral pathogenicity [10, 11] . These features made ORF3 gene a potential target to conduct the [12, 13] . The ORF3a protein of SARS-CoV reportedly forms an ion channel and may modulate virus release [14] . Also, the SARS-CoV 3a protein is necessary for Golgi to plasma membrane transport [15] . Considering the similar genome structure between SARS-CoV and PEDV, a previous study adapted same methods used for the SARS-CoV 3a protein to demonstrate that the PEDV ORF3 protein also functioned as an ion channel and regulates virus production [16] . However, the mechanism by which the ORF3 gene affects PEDV replication remains unclear to date. Presently, no data were reported about the influence of PEDV ORF3 on cell cycle and vesicles formation. In the present work, we developed a Vero cell line that could stably express the ORF3 protein of PEDV to explore its properties. Our results demonstrated that the ORF3 gene of PEDV could prolong S-phase, facilitate formation of vesicles and thus promote the proliferation of PEDV. These findings have potentially important implications for understanding the molecular mechanisms of PEDV pathogenesis.",

Our results showed that attenuated CV777 and AH-M of PEDV strains generated more mRNA in Vero-ORF3 cells compared to the control parent cells. However, virulent PEDV showed no significant differences. These results demonstrated that ORF3 could promote the proliferation of attenuated PEDV but not essential. The complete ORF3 gene encodes a transmembrane protein that functions as an ion channel, while the truncated ORF3 protein of attenuated PEDV lacks the ion channel activity. A wide range of viruses encode proteins that function as ion channels. These proteins may influence viral replication and assembly, as well as virus entry and release from infected cells, and serve as promising anti-viral drug targets [39] . Ion channel proteins are important for virus replication, which may be associated with depolarization and ion balance.",
