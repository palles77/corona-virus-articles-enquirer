Tremblay, DVM, DVSc* Oral and intravenous fluid therapy is aimed at restoring circulating blood volume as well as correcting specific acid-base, electrolyte, and energy deficits. Solutions for parenteral use should be selected on their ability to correct specific volume and electrolyte deficits and, if possible, ability to correct acid-base and blood glucose abnormalities. In general, solutions intended for replacement of losses should have a composition similar to that of the fluid or electrolyte lost by the animal. 45.47 For example, solutions that contain electrolytes in preparations similar to extracellular fluid (ECF) are best used to restore losses of ECF incurred through diarrhea. 44 \u2022 45 ,47 It would be inappropriate to correct diarrheic losses with isotonic dextrose since diarrhea-induced deficits in electrolytes are not addressed with isotonic dextrose therapy alone. Selection of the appropriate parenteral solution is dependent on a knowledge of the properties of commonly used parenteral solutions and an understanding of the pathophysiology of fluid and electrolyte abnormalities associated with common conditions in calves.",

Examples are sodium bicarbonate, dextrose, or hypertonic saline solutions. Isotonic (1.3%) or hypertonic solutions of sodium bicarbonate are used to correct metabolic acidosis as discussed below. Isotonic (5%) or hypertonic dextrose solutions are used to provide metabolizable energy but also provide a convenient source of free water in excess of sodium after metabolism of the dextrose. Dextrose solutions should not be considered adequate to meet complete nutritional needs, although they may be used to provide caloric requirements in calves. 2 Hypertonic saline solutions (5.2-7.2%) administered in small volumes (4-5 ml/kg) have proven useful as adjuncts to replacement therapy in cases of cardiovascular collapse from hemorrhage or hyponatremic, hypoosmolal fluid loss. 16,23 Infusion of hypertonic saline solutions results in improvement in cardiac performance by increasing myocardial contractility and decreasing vascular resistance in pulmonary, systemic, and coronary circulations. 16, 23, 60 Colloidal fluids are solutions containing high molecular weight, nondiffusible compounds. Examples are plasma and dextrans in crystalloid solution. Nondiffusible osmotically active colloidal compounds do not freely traverse the vascular endothelium, assuring that the colloid remains within the vascular compartment. The resultant colloid osmotic pressure or oncotic pressure retains water within the intravascular space. Therapeutic use of colloids reduces the volume of crystalloid necessary to restore losses of circulating blood volume. For general use in replacement therapy, colloidal solutions have not shown consistent advantages over crystalloid solutions. 23 In calves, use of plasma can provide a valuable source of immunoglobulin for passive immunity.",

The animal will, however, have a history of decreased fluid intake or signs of increased losses such as fecal staining of the perineal area. As loss approaches 6 -8 % of body weight, clinical signs become apparent. Eyes become slightly sunken, as evidenced by appearance of a noticeable gap between the globe and bony orbit (enophthalmia). In addition, there is loss of skin turgor, reflected in persistence of a skin tent produced on the upper eyelid or side of the neck for 3 -5 seconds. At 8 -10% loss in body weight, eyes become more substantially sunken, and the persistence of a skin tent extends up to 10 seconds. Mucous membranes are dry and tacky at this stage. Calves are often depressed and unwilling to suckle. Maximal clinical dehydration occurs with loss of 10-14% of body weight. Such animals have markedly reduced peripheral perfusion with cool extremities and poor peripheral pulse quality. They are severely depressed and may be comatose. Eyes are deeply sunken in the orbit and a skin tent usually persists indefinitely. Clinical evaluation of dehydration should include a rapid but thorough physical examination to identify other abnormalities that will influence choice of therapy or prognosis. Particularly important are signs of injury, respiratory disease, septicemia, or localized sepsis such as omphalitis, arthritis, and uveitis. If dehydration has occurred rapidly, loss from the ECF space may be more severe than indicated by clinical signs. Neonatal animals may rapidly lose large quantities of extracellular fluid and electrolytes into the gastrointestinal tract. These losses occur from the entire extracellular space but are most severe from the intravascular compartment. 55 Loss of body weight can be an unreliable indicator of severity of dehydration. Rarely is weight recorded prior to fluid loss to serve for comparison. Even in cases in which pre-loss weight is known, extracellular fluid loss may be underestimated if a substantial quantity of fluid is sequestered in a body space such as the gastrointestinal tract or, less commonly, the peritoneal or pleural cavity. Sequestered fluid contributes to total body weight while not contributing to extracellular or intracellular fluid volumes.",

Lactated Ringer's solution contains lactate as an alkalizing agent. Dehydrated diarrheic calves have a reduced ability to metabolize L-Iactate. 8 Even healthy calves utilize D-Iactate poorly. As a result, the racemic mixture of D-and L-Iactate present in lactated Ringer's solution is expected to be poorly metabolized in dehydrated calves. Neonatal calves with diarrhea have metabolic acidosis characterized by elevated blood levels of L-Iactate consistent with decreased utilization of endogenously generated lactate. 49 Because of this decreased utilization as well as the low concentration of L-Iactate in lactated Ringer's solution, it may be used to replace water and electrolyte losses in diarrheic calves, but it has limited value in correction of metabolic acidosis. 3o However, if L-Iactate is provided in greater concentration (50 mmolfL), it can be used to effectively correct metabolic acidosis.

If blood volume is restored with solutions of low-sodium concentration or if the dehydrated calf consumes large volumes of water, plasma sodium concentration may be markedly reduced as a result of the disproportionate restoration of the ECF volume by sodium-free fluid. 44 -47 Fluid mixtures with sodium concentrations similar to those in plasma are indicated to replace both volume and sodium deficits. In cases of severe sodium depletion, isotonic or hypertonic saline will provide additional sodium, although saline does not correct deficits in other electrolytes and may exacerbate a preexisting acidosis. 23 ,47 Calves may experience dehydration with hypernatremia in situations of reduced water intake or when water is lost without simultaneous sodium loss, as occurs with uncorrected insensible losses. Severely dehydrated diarrheic calves may also exhibit some degree of hypernatremia. 73 Calves may suffer hypernatremia secondary to consumption of improperly diluted oral electrolyte solutions. 59 In cases of hypernatremic dehydration from decreased water intake or excess free water loss, sodium chloride (O.3%}/dextrose (3.3%) may be slowly infused as a replacement fluid. Free water will be provided by an initially isotonic solution following metabolism of the dextrose. In the presence of extreme hypernatremia, treatment is aimed at slowly correcting dehydration, while simultaneously reducing plasma sodium concentration.

In severe cases that progress to cardiovascular collapse, metabolic acidosis develops and is superimposed over the preexisting alkalosis. As in adults, calves with experimentally induced gastric outflow obstructions develop hypochloremia with hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis. 12, 21 Unfortunately, there is insufficient published information to allow prediction of the electrolyte and acid-base status of a calf with naturally occurring abomasal outflow obstruction. In one case of naturally occurring abomasal dilation in a calf, there was no alteration in plasma electrolyte values, and mixed respiratory and metabolic acidosis was observed. 17 Similar to dogs with gastric dilation-volvulus, calves with abomasal volvulus may be expected to experience a range of electrolyte and acid-base abnormalities that cannot be predicted and can only be assessed by measurement of electrolyte and acid-base values. 48 ,78 In situations in which abomasal outflow is impaired, balanced electrolyte solutions present the optimal first choice for volume replacement, unless specific electrolyte abnormalities can be identified and treated.

The vein can be distended by gentle massage in the jugular groove with strokes moving from the mandible toward the thoracic inlet. Elevation of the hind end and lowering of the head may facilitate distention and visualization of the jugular. Once the vein has been identified, a site approximately one third of the distance from the head to the thorax should be selected and clipped. A complete surgical preparation should be performed; then a small stab incision may be made through the skin at the insertion site. The dermis should be incised, but the vein should be avoided, since a hematoma will result if it is punctured. The final skin preparation should be repeated. With care taken not to handle the plastic indwelling portion, the catheter is introduced into the vein and directed toward the thoracic inlet.

In general, thrombus size is related to catheter size,24,26,54 with small catheters inducing small thrombi that are less likely to occlude the vein. 24 The type of plastic used in catheter construction and the method of construction also has an influence on the tendency to induce Figure 6 . Placement of an over-the-needle catheter in a jugular vein. The area has been clipped and prepared as for surgery. An incision has been made through the dermis. A, The catheter is inserted at an acute angle and should enter the vein immediately after traversing the skin. Note that the catheter is held by the hub only and is directed toward the thoracic inlet. B, The catheter is inserted as a unit then the insertion needle is withdrawn. C, The catheter may be flushed with heparin-saline to assess proper placement and prevent thrombosis. An extension set, previously filled with heparin-saline, has been attached to the catheter. D, Nonabsorbable suture is secured around the catheter hub. Illustration continued on opposite page thrombosis. Catheters constructed of polyvinyl chloride and polyethylene cause more local irritation than do fluorethylene propylene {Tef-lon} or tetra-fluoroethylene resins.14 Ethylene acrylic acid catheters were less frequently associated with thrombus formation then Teflon, polyvinyl chloride,71 polypropylene, or polyethylene catheters.64 Polyurethane is less thrombogenic than either polyvinyl chloride or silicone. 68 A major determinant of the variation in the tendency to induce thrombus formation between different types of polymers is roughness of the catheter surface. Catheters constructed of polymers with rough surfaces promote greater thrombus formation than those with smoother surfaces. 25 ,26 Manufacturing technique also influences surface roughness such that catheters made of identical polymers can have marked Figure 6 (Continued). E,F,G, A disposable needle is placed subcutaneously, to emerge 3 to 4 mm from the ligature on he hub and the suture passed through the needle. The free ends of the suture are tied to retain the catheter hub in a fold of skin. differences in surface roughness and thrombogenicity as a result of differences in manufacturing conditions. 24 The risk of catheter complications increases with increasing duration of catheter placement. 6 ,9,34,71 In humans, thrombophlebitis most often develops within 70-75 hours of placement,27,52 which has led to the recommendation that catheters should be removed within 24 -48 hours of insertion. Conscientious removal of a catheter does not completely alleviate risk, however, as thrombophlebitis may still develop up to 48 hours after removal. 27 ,52 The chemical properties of solutions infused have an important influence on development of thrombophlebitis. Solutions that are hypertonic (e.g., 50% dextrose and some total parenteral nutrition solutions) are prone to production of chemical injury of the intima and ultimately to thrombophlebitis. Such solutions should only be administered in veins with high blood flow rates, such as the jugular veins, or via central venous catheters. 3 ,34 Solutions and drugs that are strongly acidic or alkaline also induce injury to the intima. Dextrose solutions and normal saline with pH values ranging from 4.3 to 5 3 ,34 may predispose to thrombophlebitis. Irritating drugs such as thiobarbiturates, phenylbutazone, and the aminoglycosides are also associated with chemical damage to vessels. 3 ,52",

The first step in developing an intravenous fluid plan is determination of the volume needed to replace the fluid deficit, estimated on the basis of clinical signs. The parenteral solution to be used is chosen to be similar in electrolyte composition to the fluid lost. Abnormalities of specific electrolytes, acid-base balance, and energy metabolism can be addressed during volume replacement; this requires an understanding of the pathophysiology of the primary clinical abnormality.",
