In a two-stage study we investigated Immunoglobulin G reactivity in plasma from MDS, Acute Myeloid Leukemia post MDS patients, and a healthy cohort. In exploratory Stage I we utilized high-throughput protein arrays to identify 35 high-interest proteins showing increased reactivity in patient subgroups compared to healthy controls. In validation Stage II we designed new arrays focusing on 25 of the proteins identified in Stage I and expanded the initial cohort. We validated increased antibody reactivity against AKT3, FCGR3A and ARL8B in patients, which enabled sample classification into stable MDS and healthy individuals. We also detected elevated AKT3 protein levels in MDS patient plasma. The discovery of increased specific autoantibody reactivity in MDS patients, provides molecular signatures for classification, supplementing existing risk categorizations, and may enhance diagnostic and prognostic capabilities for MDS.",

MDS pathogenesis involves multifaceted factors, related to intrinsic hematopoietic precursor cell abnormalities. The prevalent shared pathogenesis causing the ineffective hematopoiesis in MDS involves varying degrees of apoptosis of the hematopoietic cell linage [3] [4] [5] . Recent genomic approaches have concentrated on the effects of specific gene mutations and their associated signaling pathways, and their role in MDS development and outcome, including the tendency of transitioning to more aggressive disease stages 6, 7 . Currently, the prognosis of patient outcomes is greatly facilitated by the establishment of the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS 8 , recently revised as IPSS-R 9 ). The IPSS takes into account multiple clinical markers to classify lower risk patients (Low, Intermediate 1) as having improved prognoses compared to those with higher risk features (Intermediate 2 and High).",

Reactive antibody profiling with protein microarray is in principle the same as Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assays (ELISA) with the same antigen-primary antibody-secondary antibody format, with additional advantages including 1) a higher throughput and 2) using fluorescent signals from secondary antibodies instead of the less reproducible enzyme-linked chromogenic signals. Protein microarrays have been reported to have higher throughput, sensitivity and a wider detection range compared to traditional ELISA methods in various applications 10, 22 . Our main hypothesis is that MDS elicits specific autoantibody responses, and hence we searched for autoantigen biomarkers related to various MDS patient subgroups compared to control plasmas using protein microarray technology (ProtoArrays v. 5 by Invitrogen). We focused on a retrospective classification of subjects into stable MDS patients (s-MDS), which had not transformed into acute myeloid leukemia (AML) for at least 14 months, and generally for multiple years, transforming MDS (t-MDS), where patients eventually acquired AML within a 14-month period, and AML post MDS (L) where the patients had already transformed to AML, after previously having being classified as MDS patients 23 . The MDS and AML patients were compared to a healthy cohort of individuals.",

The finding that increased antibody reactivity for these proteins predominantly occurred in s-MDS patients is consistent with prior data indicating early stage MDS having a higher degree of immune-related abnormalities than later stage patients 16, 17 .

            "text": "The three proteins validated in Stage II of our investigation present a more robust set, showing increased autoantibody reactivity in MDS patients. The detected autoantibody reactivity to the above proteins offers possible new connections between immune response and tumor formation and detection. Of these, we particularly note that AKT3 (v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog 3 /protein kinase B, gamma), has been known to be actively involved in multiple cancers, including breast cancer 28, 29 , tumorigenesis in melanomas 30,31 , lung cancers 32 and ovarian cancers 33 (cell cycle involvement). In previous studies AKT3 gene overexpression, and deregulation of AKT pathways, have been detected by gene expression profiling 23, 34 . In addition, our observation of differential autoantibody reactivity, and corresponding protein levels, make this a compelling case for the involvement of AKT3 in MDS and highlight its potential as a biomarker for the condition in s-MDS. FCGR3A (an IgG receptor) is involved in multiple antibody processes. Fc-receptors have been the target of multiple therapeutic approaches for cancer and inflammatory states 35 , including FCGR3A 36 (genotype association to rituximab response). The FCGR3A protein levels as determined by ELISA showed an opposite trend as compared to the corresponding autoantibody reactivity. While the FCGR3A protein levels may reflect the possibility that the observed autoantibody reactivity is due to ''non-specific'' Fc-Receptor interaction rather than increased amount of specific anti-FCGR3A antibody, it does not necessarily imply a correlation between the amount of antigen and the strength of reactivity. In fact, many highly expressed proteins are not autogenic (e.g. albumin, which is a negative acute-phase protein with decreased plasma levels during immune response [37] [38] [39] , while a small amount of allergen could trigger severe immune response. ARL8B (ADP-ribosylation factor-like 8B) is involved in lysosome trafficking and positioning, influencing mTOR expression (mammalian target of rapamycin) and autophagosome formation 40 , and may also be associated to metastasis and tumorigenesis 41 . Patient classification may be made into two separate classification schemes, prospectively by IPSS or retrospectively (s/t/L or healthy) as considered above. These classification schemes show good overlap as the IPSS Low and Intermediate 1 risk categories account for 27% and 68% respectively of our s-MDS patients (85% total). Using the autoantibody reactivities we classified patients into each of these two classification schemes (retrospective or IPSS), showing better concordance of autoantibody reactivity in stable patients with the retrospective classification rather than IPSS, but slightly lower with healthy patients (90%). As the classification into IPSS does better on healthy patients (100%), this suggests that combining the IPSS classification scheme with the autoantibody reactivities may improve clinical diagnosis of s-MDS patients while maintaining low numbers of false positives in healthy individuals. Furthermore, autoantibody reactivity-based classification relies on direct molecular marker signatures, and may have possible application as an alternative or supplement to the IPSS risk estimation, especially for early detection of s-MDS patients. Finally, the detection of autoantibody reactivity would only require plasma, and be minimally invasive for the patients. Our study discovered differential autoantibody reactivity in MDS, and identified autoantibodies particular to prognostic MDS subsets, demonstrating that protein microarrays provide a powerful approach to identify unique biomarkers associated with this disease. In our investigation we chose the more sensitive focused protein array approach over traditional chromogenic ELISA for our validation purposes. While we envision that high-throughput, fluorescence-based methods such as protein microarrays may eventually replace traditional chromogenic ELISA in clinical tests, we expect ELISA clinical tests may also be developed in the future based on our findings. Regarding the possible specificity of our findings, although such autoantibody studies have not as yet been reported in other hematologic malignancies, the combined autoantibody reactivity we observed in our MDS patients was distinct from those reported in patients with ovarian 13 and prostate 14 cancer, diabetes 11 and after respiratory infections 10 . We expect our findings of the increased autoantibody reactivity in MDS patients with relatively prolonged clinical courses will encourage future studies with larger patient cohorts, that will be helpful to further substantiate the prognostic importance of such data and exploration of the underlying molecular mechanisms. The identified autoantibody reactivity may greatly enhance our diagnostic and prognostic capabilities for MDS. Plasma autoantibody reactivity profiling with protein arrays. In Stage I the autoantibody reactivity was profiled on the retrospective patient subsets (Table 1a) using Invitrogen ProtoArray Protein Microarrays, v5.0 (9,483 unique human proteins spotted in duplicate, 23,232 signals total including controls), as described previously 12, 13 . In parallel, duplicate negative control arrays were probed. The plasma samples were diluted 1:100 in 5 ml Washing Buffer (13 PBS, 0.1% Tween 20, 13 Roti-Block). The ProtoArrays were dried and scanned using a Genepix 4200AL Microarray Scanner (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). The obtained array images were analyzed (Genepix Pro 6.1, Molecular Devices), obtaining feature locations, signal foreground and background intensity quantification and corresponding identification information (.gpr file format). In addition to probing for IgG reactivity (532 nm channel), the arrays were spotted with proteins containing a glutathione Stransferase (GST) fusion tag, and a second channel (635 nm) screening allowed us to probe GST intensity, which is used as a proxy for protein concentration per array spot (see also Supplementary Fig. S2) .",

Additionally, the study was expanded to a much larger cohort (Table 1b) . The protein arrays were scanned as described above, with each block corresponding to a different patient, and patient samples performed in duplicates. We used the same inter-and intra-array normalization as in Stage I (Fig. 2a) , applied per block, and the signals for each protein spotted were transformed to a normal distribution using a Box-Cox transformation 44 . Each protein was analyzed using an ANOVA model 45 , checking for variance in subject subgroup (retrospective classification), replication (duplicate samples, duplicate protein spots), subject age, gender, marrow blast levels (healthy, IPSS blast categories, leukemic status), and randomization effects (batch effects between Stage I or II of the investigation), Fig. 3a . The possible interactions between all the above were also considered. Signals showing significant primary effects but no significant interactions, using Bonferroni post-hoc tests to correct for multiple group and feature comparisons, were selected as high-confidence signals of interest. Additionally, the ANOVA was used to screen out signals showing significant effects due to replication, subject age and randomization.
