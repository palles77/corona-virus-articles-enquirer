However, cathepsin B activity was negative or extremely low in NIH3T3 cells. How did CA-074Me attenuate the Eco-MLV infection? The CA-074Me treatment of NIH3T3 cells inhibited cathepsin L activity, and a cathepsin L specific inhibitor, CLIK148, attenuated the Eco-MLV vector infection. These results indicate that the suppression of cathepsin L activity by CA-074Me induces the inhibition of Eco-MLV infection, suggesting that cathepsin L is required for the Eco-MLV infection in NIH3T3 cells. The CA-074Me treatment inhibited the Eco-MLV infection in human cells expressing the exogenous mouse ecotropic receptor and endogenous cathepsins B and L, but the CLIK148 treatment did not, showing that only the cathepsin L suppression by CLIK148 is not enough to prevent the Eco-MLV infection in cells expressing both of cathepsins B and L, and CA-074Me inhibits the Eco-MLV infection by suppressing both of cathepsins B and L. These results suggest that either cathepsin B or L is sufficient for the Eco-MLV infection.",

The R peptide-truncated Env protein induces syncytia in susceptible cells, but the R peptide-containing Env protein does not. However, the R peptide-containing Env protein successfully induces syncytia in rat XC and fu-1 cells (Jones and Risser, 1993; Wong, Yuen, and Kaufman, 1977) . We have previously reported that treatment of XC cells with tunicamycin, an N-linked glycosylation inhibitor, significantly suppresses the syncytium formation of XC cells by the R peptidecontaining Env protein, but does not that by the R peptide-truncated Env protein, suggesting that an unknown glycosylated cellular protein is involved in the XC cell-specific syncytium formation by the R peptide-containing Env protein (Kubo, Ishimoto, and Amanuma, 2003) . Because XC and fu-1 cells were both derived from muscle tissues, it was speculated that the cellular factor is also associated with syncytium formation in myogenesis.",

It has been reported that cathepsin Bdeficient myoblast cells undergo differentiation with impaired cell fusion (Gogos et al., 1996) , and a cathepsin B inhibitor, CA-074Me, inhibits L6 myoblast differentiation (Jane et al., 2002) . We found that cathepsin B was expressed in XC cells, but was undetectable in NIH3T3 cells. However, it has been reported that CA-074Me suppresses the Eco-MLV infection in NIH3T3 cells (Kumar et al., 2007) .

We found in this study that CLIK148 significantly inhibits the Eco-MLV infection in the cathepsin B-undetectable NIH3T3 cells, but does not in cells expressing both of cathepsins B and L, showing that cathepsin L is required for the Eco-MLV infection in the cathepsin B-undetectable NIH3T3 cells, but not in cathepsin B-expressing cells.

To confirm this result, we analyzed the effects of CA-074Me on the Eco-MLV vector infection in mouse NIH3T3, rat XC, and human cells (293T, TE671, and NP2) expressing mouse CAT1 (mCAT1). These cells were pretreated with CA-074Me for 5 h, and were inoculated with the Eco-MLV vector having the LacZ gene as a marker. As already reported (Kumar et al., 2007) , the CA-074Me treatment attenuated the Eco-MLV vector transduction in a dose-dependent manner in all cell lines examined (Figs. 1A and B), but did not significantly affect cell viability (Fig. 1C) . The inhibitory effect of CA-074Me on the Eco-MLV vector infection was statistically significant by ANOVA and Tukey's test in all the cell lines (p b 0.05). The CA-074Me treatment moderately inhibited VSV-G-pseudotyped MLV vector transduction (Fig. 1D ) as already reported (Kumar et al., 2007) , but the inhibitory effect on the VSV vector transduction was lower than that on the Eco-MLV vector transduction (Figs. 1A and B) . These results suggest that cathepsin B is required for the Eco-MLV vector infection.",

Cathepsin B activity was more effectively inhibited by CA-074Me in 293T cells than in TE671 cells, because 293T cells were treated with CA-074Me at higher concentration (50 \u03bcM) than TE671 cells (25 \u03bcM). The fluorescence strength of NIH3T3 cells stained with the cathepsin B detection reagent was not reduced by the CA-074Me treatment (40 \u03bcM), supporting that cathepsin B activity is negative in NIH3T3 cells, although the CA-074Me treatment at the same concentration significantly reduced the Eco-MLV vector transduction (Fig. 1A) .
