            "text": "Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection is a major cause of morbidity in the recipients of organ transplants and in the congenitally infected infants. HCMV vaccine has emerged as an effective approach to prevent HCMV infection particularly for the development of multiple viral antigens vaccination and human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-restricted polyepitope technology. As the Chinese population makes up more than one fifth of the population worldwide, it is important to develop HCMV vaccines more specific for the Chinese population by targeting Chinese-restricted HLA alleles and antigens. In the present study, we designed a novel chimeric polyepitope vaccine based on the replication-deficient adenovirus Ad5F35, which encodes 83 HCMV T cell epitopes from 15 different HCMV antigens, restricted to 14 HLA I and 7 HLA II alleles that cover 92% of the Chinese population. Our results show that the recombinant adenovirus vaccine Ad5F35-CTL\u00c1Th can be efficiently transfected and expressed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) with little cytopathic activity. Ad5F35-CTL\u00c1Th can also be endogenously processed and presented by PBMCs. Ad5F35-CTL\u00c1Th-stimulated HCMV-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) showed strong cytolytic activity against HCMV polyepitope-sensitized target cells. The CTL activity was accompanied by high levels of IFN-c production after Ad5F35-CTL\u00c1Th stimulation. The specificity and vigorous response to the recombinant adenovirus vaccine in vitro makes it a potential candidate to be used for transplantation recipients or congenitally infected infants.",

            "text": "Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is found universally throughout all geographic locations and socioeconomic groups, with seroprevalence ranging from 45% to 100% . HCMV can cause clinical disease in the fetus, neonate and immunocompromised individuals such as transplant recipients and HIVinfected patients. Congenital HCMV infection is an important cause of hearing, cognitive, and motor impairments in newborns (Dollard et al., 2007; Hyde et al., 2010) . In the allograft recipient, viremic dissemination can cause end-organ disease, such as hepatitis, pneumonitis, gastroenteritis and retinitis, and can predispose for transplant rejection. Developing a vaccine in the two populations has been rated as high priority. Recently, two HCMV phase 2 clinical trials have now been completed with positive results from the induction of humoral immunity, which showed that HCMV glycoprotein B (gB) vaccine has the potential to decrease incident cases of maternal and congenital CMV infection (Griffiths et al., 2011; Pass et al., 2009) . We have also generated vaccine Ad5F35-AD-1 that expressed the conserved conformational epitope AD-1 from gB protein (Zhao et al., 2009) . Moreover, cellular immunity provided by the CD8+ and CD4+ T lymphocytes has shown to play a key role in resolving the primary infection, providing long-term immune surveillance, and the clearance of replicating virus (Crough et al., 2007; Fornara et al., 2011; Nebbia et al., 2008) . Therefore, it is of great importance to develop an effective HCMV vaccine based on viral antigens that activate cellular immunity to prevent HCMV-associated disease (Bunde et al., 2005; Einsele et al., 2002) .",

            "text": "Over the past 30 years, various strategies of cellular immunity, including the use of subunit vaccines, its DNA or dense bodies to vaccinate, have been developed and promising results in preclinical studies have been demonstrated (Khanna and Diamond, 2006; Plotkin, 1999; Schleiss, 2005 Schleiss, , 2007 of the strategies is hindered by the limited range of epitopes and HLA alleles that could be included to develop the HCMV vaccine. Ideally, a formulation should cover most viral antigens, which could induce a broad repertoire of HCMV-specific cellular immune responses. Recently developed polyepitope technology allows the presentation of multiple HLA class I-restricted CTL (cytotoxic T lymphocyte) epitopes derived from different antigens within a single reading frame and thus provides a new platform to achieve this goal. The epitope-based vaccine should also contain a minimal number of epitopes which cover a vast majority of the human population (Buteau et al., 2002; Fischer et al., 2007; Khan et al., 2006) . T-cell epitopes that bind to multiple alleles of HLA are prime targets for vaccine and immunotherapy development due to their relevance to a large proportion of the human population, for example, SARS coronavirus nucleocapsid (Gupta et al., 2006) , HIV-1 proteins (Berzofsky et al., 1991; Brown et al., 2003; Surman et al., 2001) , and Chlamydia trachomatis outer membrane protein (Kim and De-Mars, 2001) . Epitope-based vaccines can effectively induce cellular immunity by selecting a small number of hotspots that can elicit most of the required T-cell functions. To date, many studies have focused on HLA-restricted HCMV epitope vaccines and progress has been made (Elkington et al., 2003; Rist et al., 2005) . However, these investigations were mainly aimed at the Caucasian population or for a general population with limited coverage of HLA alleles or antigens. Since Chinese population with more than 50 different ethnic groups makes up one fifth of the world population, it is essential to develop HCMV epitope vaccines more specific to the Chinese population by targeting on more Chinese-restricted HLA alleles and broader antigens.",

The CPF algorithm allows the identification of alleles that represent a desired percentage of a population, and also allows prediction of theoretical responder status in any given population where HLA gene frequencies are known. Briefly, the CPF of 14 HLA allele sites (A2, A24, A1, A3, A11, A68, B44, B7, A23, A26, B35, B38, B8 and B27) in the Chinese population was forecasted and the immunoactivity of HLA-restricted HCMV polyepitope nucleotide vaccine in different geographical locations was evaluated. Utilizing literature data on HLA-restricted HCMV epitopes that have been published, we selected 76 CTL epitopes and 7 Th epitopes derived from different HCMV protein antigens that can induce cellular immunologic response and stably bind corresponding class I and class II HLA molecules. Through SYFPEITHY (Rammensee et al., 1999) combined with MAPPP algorithms (Hakenberg et al., 2003) , the selected Fig. 1 . Schematic view of the construction of a recombinant adenovirus that expresses a synthetic DNA encoding for a polyepitope protein which contains 83 HCMV T-cell epitopes. The DNA sequence encoding this polyepitope protein was synthesized using overlapping epitope sequence specific primers as described in ''Section 2''. This synthetic insert was cloned into a T plasmid prior to cloning into the pHMCMV5 vector. After amplification in E. coli, the expression cassette from pHMCMV5 was excised and ligated into the pAd5F35 expression vector. Following linearization of the DNA using Pac I restriction enzyme, the recombinant pAd5F35 vector was packaged into infectious adenovirus by transfecting HEK 293 cells, and recombinant adenovirus (referred to as Ad5F35-CTL\u00c1Th) was harvested from transfected cells by repeated freeze-thawing cycles. epitopes and polyepitope were predicted for the specific HLA-binding value and proteasomal cleavage site.",

HCMV has 165 open reading frames (ORFs), and accumulating evidence has shown that HCMV specific immune responses are not only restricted to gB, pp65 and IE-1 antigens, but also are directed towards more than 70% of the HCMV reading frames (Elkington et al., 2004; Manley et al., 2004; Schleiss, 2008; Sylwester et al., 2005) which includes ''non-essential'' genes encoding modulators of adaptive immune responses, such as US2, US3, US6, US11. In this study, computational methods such as CPF algorithm, SYFPEITHI algorithm and MAPPP algorithm for predicted as well as experimentally determined epitopes were incorporated into the selection of the optimal polyepitope.

In our study, the HCMV epitopes encoded by this polyepitope were endogenously expressed and processed by human cells. We found that stimulation with Ad5F35-CTL\u00c1Th rapidly expanded multiple antigen-specific human CTL cells from healthy virus carriers in vitro, and these CTL cells exhibited a strong HCMV epitope-specific cytolytic activity against HLA restricted target cells. IFN-c-producing cells were largely induced from PBMCs stimulated by Ad5F35-CTL\u00c1Th or expanded antigen-specific CTL, which indicated T cell reactivation.

Compared with traditional adenoviral vectors, Ad5F35 used in this study is being increasingly recognized for its high efficiency and low toxicity and has been used in multiple human gene therapy clinical trials. The Ad5F35 vector contains a chimeric fiber gene encoding the fiber tail of Ad5 in combination with the fiber shaft and knob domains of Ad35. Cell entry of Ad5F35 is thought to be mediated by CD46, a receptor expressed on most human cells (Gaggar et al., 2003) . Liver tropism and hepatoxicity are significantly lower for Ad5F35 than for Ad5 (Xin et al., 2005) . Importantly, Ad5F35 infection does not induce acute responses or the production of proinflammatory cytokines. Ad5F35 has been used as a vaccine delivery vehicle in other infectious disease models including hepatitis C (Thammanichanond et al., 2008) and HIV (Xin et al., 2007) , where potent transgene product-specific antibody and T-cell responses were reported. In terms of efficacy, Ad5F35 appears to be more effective than other comparable vectors for recombinant protein expression in hematopoietic cells (Yotnda et al., 2001) . In this study we successfully constructed a novel HCMV vaccine based on the replication-deficient Ad5F35 that encodes HLA-specific HCMV polyepitope nucleotide vaccine. Ex vivo infecting PBMCs with Ad5F35-CTL\u00c1Th consistently demonstrated high expression of CTL\u00c1Th polyepitope antigen and low toxicity, which in turn resulted in strong stimulation of antigen specific CTLs. Thus, combination of the Ad5F35 expression system with polyepitope technology provides a potential strategy for the expansion of T cells.",

(B, C) Ad5F35-CTL\u00c1Th was highly efficient in stimulating multiple CTL responses, and strong cytolytic activity against four different epitopes (VTE, HLA A1-restricted; NLV and VLE, HLA A2-restricted; GPI, HLA A11-restricted) was observed at an E:T ratio as low as 1:1. (D) PBMCs from four healthy virus carriers JXX (A2, A11, DR4, DR15), ZNN (A1, B44, B35, DR7, DR11), HSB (A1, A2, B35, DR4, DR13) and GH (A1, A2, B8, DR4, DR9) were used in this assay. Unstimulated PBMCs were used as negative controls, while sensitized PBMCs with peptide epitope (GPISGHVLK for JXX, VTEHDTLLY for ZNN, NLVPMVATV for HSB, VLEETSVML for GH) were positive controls. PBMCs infected with Ad5F35-CTL\u00c1Th at MOI 100:1 or 50:1 served as the experimental group. The secretion of IFN-c was tested. The results show that IFN-c-producing cells has been largely induced from PBMCs stimulated by Ad5F35-CTL\u00c1Th. The results were expressed as mean \u00b1 SE of spot forming cells (SFC) per 10 6 PBMCs from four individual volunteers.
