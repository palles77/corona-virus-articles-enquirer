            "text": "Avian infectious bronchitis (IB) is an acute, highly infectious and contagious viral disease of chickens caused by avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) belonging to the genus Coronavirus and family Coronaviridae. It can affect all age groups of birds. The toll-like receptors (TLRs) are a major class of innate immune pattern recognition receptors that have a key role in immune response and defense against various infections.The TLRs are essential for initiation of innate immune responses and in the development of adaptive immune responses. An in ovo model was employed to study the antiviral activity of TLR ligands (Pam3CSK4, LPS and CpG ODN) on replication of IBV. It was hypothesized that optimum dose and specific timing of TLR ligands may reduce viral load of IBV in specific pathogen free (SPF) embryonated chicken eggs (ECEs). Further, the mechanism involved in the TLRmediated antiviral response in chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) of ECEs was investigated. The ECEs of 9-11 days old were treated with different doses (high, intermediate and low) of TLR-2 (Pam3CSK4), TLR-4 (LPS) and TLR-21 (CpG ODN) ligands. In addition, to know the timing of TLR ligand treatment, six time intervals were analyzed viz. 36, 24 and 12 h prior to infection, time of infection (co-administration of TLR ligands and avian IBV) and 12 and 24 h post-IBV infection. For studying the relative expression of immuno-stimulatory genes (IFN\u03b1, IFN-\u03b2, IFN-\u03b3, IL-1\u03b2, iNOS and OAS) in CAM, TLR ligands were administered through intra-allantoicroute and CAM were collected at 4, 8 and 16 h post treatment. The results demonstrated that intermediate dose of all the three TLR ligands significantly reduced virus titers and used in the present study. However, the LPS reduced virus titer pre-and post-IBV infection but Pam3CSK4 and CpG ODN reduced only pre-IBV infection. Further analysis showed that TLR ligands induced IFN-\u03b3, IL-1\u03b2 and IFN stimulated genes viz. iNOS and OAS genes in CAM. The present study pointed towards the novel opportunities for rational design of LPS as immuno-stimulatory agent in chickens with reference to IBV. It may be speculated that in ovo administration of these TLR ligands may enhance resistance against viral infection in neonatal chicken and may contribute towards the development of more effective and safer vaccines including in ovo vaccines.",

The IBV is an enveloped virus having positive-sense and single stranded RNA of 27.6 Kbp (Boursnell et al., 1989; Cavanagh, 2007) . IB is a major problem of poultry industry causing huge economic losses to poultry industry through decrease in quality of eggs & production and increase in the susceptibility for secondary bacterial infections in chickens. Emergence of new variant serotypes and genotypes of IBV in the field is frequent because of mutations and/or recombination of the hypervariable region of the S1 gene which do not cross-protect and therefore hinder complete control of the disease by the routinely used vaccination programs (Cavanagh et al., 1992; Chhabra et al., 2015) . A large number of IBV serotypes exist worldwide and several serotypes can co-circulate in a region (Capua et al., 1999) .",

            "text": "In IBV infections, melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5) is a primary sensor in chicken cells that leads to production of interferon (Kint et al., 2015; Chhabra et al., 2016) . The innate immune response activates when IBV binds to the receptors on the mucosal linings of the tracheal tissue (Rahman et al., 2009 ) and this immune response may be due to pathways in which TLRs are activated (Guo et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2006) . TLRs are evolutionarily conserved pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) present across various species including human, mice, fish and chicken and recognize pathogen associated molecule patterns (PAMPs) (Keestra et al., 2013) . In chicken, TLR1A and B, TLR2A and B, TLR3, TLR4, TLR5, TLR7, TLR15 and TLR21 have been identified. TLR15 is unique to chickens and TLR21 is a functional homologue of mammalian TLR9 which recognizes CpG ODN in chickens . These TLR mediated responses interlink innate with adaptive immunity (Akira and Takeda, 2004) and play a critical role in inducing appropriate immune responses against pathogens by influencing the polarization of antigen-specific CD 4 + T cell responses. Several TLR ligands have been used as an prophylactic agents against various diseases and also as an adjuvants in different vaccines like CpG Oligodeoxynucleotides (CpG ODN) with avian influenza virus (AIV) subtype H5N1 inactivated oil emulsion vaccine (Wang et al., 2009) . The TLR-2 ligand Pam3CSK4 administered as an adjuvant has been shown to enhance antibody titer against human serum albumin (Erhard et al., 2000) . Monophosphoryl lipid A (MPLA), a LPS derivative enhanced antigen specific antibody titer by 10-to 20-fold when compared to vaccine alone. Purified MPLA has been approved as an adjuvant in hepatitis B vaccine, Fendrix\u2122 (Thoelen et al., 2001) . When polyinosinic :polycytidylic acid (Poly I:C), CpG ODNand lipopolysaccharide (LPS) were given to chickens 24 h prior to infection with AIV, it significantly reduced the viral shedding . Further results demonstrated that treatment with these ligands enhanced the protective effect of vaccination against influenza virus in vivo (Paul et al., 2014) .",

However, there are only a few different serotypes of IBV vaccines available for use, whereas countless different types and variants of the virus capable of causing disease are found throughout the world. For protection against IBV through a successful vaccination program, it is essential to identify the prevalent genotypes in the region and to determine the role of TLR ligands in enhancing the protective potential of IBV vaccine. The in ovo vaccination has been recognized as an attractive choice for vaccination in poultry. However, there is some problem with in ovo vaccination like low immunogenicity in case of killed vaccine and embryo lethality due to live vaccines (Rautenschlein et al., 1999; Sharma et al., 2002) . These challenges may be resolved by use of TLR ligands. Further, the TLR ligands may also act as an immune enhancer with killed vaccine or reduce embryo mortality by enhancement of innate immune responses in live vaccines .",

The previous studies have shown that the pre-treatment of LPS provided protection against the lethal influenza virus challenge in mice (Shinya et al., 2011) and pre-treatment of chicken macrophages with LPS reduced the ability of AIV to infect these cells . Bandoro and Runstadler (2017) have shown antiviral effects of LPS on influenza virus. The LPS induced NO production can lead to antiviral response against ILTV replication (Haddadi et al., 2013) . Further, the LPS also increased the expression of IFN-\u03b3, IL-1\u03b2, IL-8, IL-10, iNOS, and MHC-II in the spleen at 2 h post treatment in chicken (Sijben et al., 2003; Paul et al., 2011) . These cytokines may play an important role in antiviral response of LPS. In our study, the Pam3SCK4 and CpG ODN significantly reduced virus titer only when administered prior to infection. The antiviral activity of Pam3CSK4 and CpG ODN has been demonstrated by Barjesteh et al. (2014) in which the pre-treatment of chicken macrophages with Pam3CSK4 and CpG ODN reduced the ability of AIV to infect these cells. This transient response induced by Pam3CSK4 and CpG ODN may be due to different profiles of immune responses induced by these TLRs or difference in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of these TLR ligands.

For example, the CpG ODN was rapidly degraded when exposed to serum and decreased its half-life. This may explain, to some extent, the duration of response after administration of these TLR ligands. Furthermore, the treatment of TLR ligands prior to viral infection in ECEs may provide sufficient time for expression of antiviral response, including IFN, ISG and non-ISG proteins. These TLR ligands also increased the expression of different antiviral genes. The previous studies have proved that these antiviral factors can block viral replication at different stages of their replication (Goubau et al., 2013) . Conversely, treatment of chicken embryos with LPS induced antiviral response post-infection. This may be due to the ISGs that interfere with the translation, assembly and release of virus (Goubau et al., 2013) .",

Following treatment with LPS, Pam3CSK4 and CpG ODN, the expression of type-1 interferon (IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2) did not increase in the CAM of ECEs. This result is also supported by the findings of Paul et al. (2011) in which expression of IFN-\u03b1 did not change after treatment of chicken with CpG ODN and LPS in spleen of chicken. Similar results were also observed by Dar et al. (2009) wherein expression of IFN-\u03b1 was not significantly increased after CpG ODN treatment in spleen of chicken embryos. There is possibility that the expression of type-1 interferon may be increased in later time points (not included in the present study). In IBV infection, the main source of proinflammatory cytokine is macrophages in respiratory tract (Amarasinghe et al., 2018) . Induction of type-1 interferon is one of the earliest responses of host immune system to any viral infection (Diebold et al., 2004) . Also, they form a bridge between innate and adaptive immune response as dendritic cells produce as well as undergo maturation by IFN-\u03b1/ IFN-\u03b2 (Le Bon and Tough, 2002) . They promote antiviral state directly through production of interferon inducible genes which inhibit viral transcription and translation, promote apoptosis of infected cells and activate antigen presenting cells (Samuel, 2001) .",

In addition, the IL-1\u03b2 has also been demonstrated to be mainly involved in innate immune responses (Dinarello, 1996) . In the present study, following embryonic treatment with LPS and Pam3CSK4, the IL-1\u03b2 expression was increased in the CAM of ECEs. Conversely, no change in IL-1\u03b2 expression in CAM of ECEs was noticed after treatment with CpG ODN. Similar results were observed in an in vivo study, in which expression of IL-1\u03b2 significantly up-regulated in chicken spleen after treatment with Pam3CSK4 and LPS (Paul et al., 2011) . These results are also supported by Barjesteh et al. (2015) in which Pam3CSK4 and LPS significantly up-regulated the expression of IL-1\u03b2 in CAM of ECEs. Contrary to our findings the expression of IL-1\u03b2 was significantly increased in spleen of chicken embryos by treatment of CpG ODN (Dar et al., 2009) . This difference may be due to type of cells present in CAM (Parvizi et al., 2012) . The expression of IL-1\u03b2 in CAM may recruit other cells like macrophages to the site of virus replication and these cells may be the source of iNOS. The iNOS catalyzed the production of NO from L-arginine using NADPH and molecular oxygen (Aktan, 2004). Nitric oxide (NO) plays an important role in host defense against infectious agents and tumors (Eisenstein, 2001) . Various TLRs upon recognizing their respective ligands can activate macrophages and other immune cells to secrete iNOS and NO. In chickens, the ability of NO synthesis after stimulation with various TLR ligands in monocytes have been evaluated (He et al., 2006) . Antiviral activity of NO has been demonstrated against ILTV in chicken macrophage (Haddadiet al., 2013) . In the present study, Pam3CSK4 and LPS significantly up-regulated the expression of iNOS in CAM of ECEs. However, no change was observed after CpG ODN treatment. Similar findings were observed by Paul et al., (2011) in which expression of iNOS was significantly increased by LPS in chicken spleen. In another in vitro study, LPS treatment up-regulated the transcription of iNOS and NO production in chicken macrophages (He et al., 2011) and monocytes (He et al., 2006) . These results are also supported by Barjesteh et al. (2015) in which Pam3CSK4 and LPS significantly up-regulated the expression of iNOS in CAM of ECEs. The inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS or NOS-2), one of the enzymes secreted by macrophages in response to intracellular pathogen, certain tumor cells, microbial products such as lipopolysaccharide and cytokine IFN-\u03b3 are of importance in immune response.",

Although, CpG ODN significantly increased the expression of OAS in spleen of chicken embryos (Dar et al., 2009 ) and lung & spleen of chicken .

The timings of TLR ligands treatment also had significant impact on the inhibition of virus replication in a way that only LPS reduced virus titer pre-and post-IBV infection but Pam3CSK4 and CpG ODN reduced virus titer only when administered pre-IBV infection. On the basis of these results, the LPS appeared to be the better candidate for adjuvant against IBV. All TLR ligands tested in the present study up-regulated the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and antiviral genes in CAM of ECEs that may play an important role in inhibition of IBV replication. It may also be speculated that in ovo administration of these TLR ligands may enhance resistance to viral infection in neonatal chickens and that these TLR ligands may contribute towards the development of more effective and safer vaccines including in ovo vaccines. Further studies are required to confirm the dose and time of treatment with different TLR ligands in SPF eggs as well as commercial birds.",

Subsequently, the ECEs were infected with 100 \u03bcl of IBV (10 4.8 EID 50 ), allantoic fluid collected and IBV titres quantified by relative real time PCR. The treatment of ECEs with LPS @2 \u03bcg/egg at 24, 12 h prior to infection and at time of virus infection significantly (P < 0.05) reduced virus titres (0.2 to 0.3 fold) in allantoic fluid. A non-significant increase in virus titre was also observed at 36 h prior to IBV infection. The LPS treatment non-significantly reduced the virus titres at 12 h post-IBV infection. Moreover, the ECEs treated with Pam3CSK4 @ 10 \u03bcg/egg at 36 and 24 h prior to IBV infection significantly (P < 0.05) reduced virus titres(0.3 to 0.4 fold) in allantoic fluid while non-significant increase in virus titres were also observed at 12 and 24 h post IBV infection. Treatment of ECEs with CpG ODN @4 \u03bcg/egg at 36, 24 and 12 h prior to infection significantly (P < 0.05) reduced virus titer (0.2 to 0.03 fold) in allantoic fluid. The CpG ODN showed non-significant increase in IBV titre at the time of virus infection (0 h), 12 and 24 h post IBV infection (Figs. 3(a), (b), (c)). 4.4. Induction of gene expression in the CAM by TLR ligands All the three TLR ligands (Pam3CSK4, CpG ODN and LPS) did not show significant (P < 0.05) increase in the expression of IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2 in CAM of ECEs at any time point. CpG ODN and LPS demonstrated non-significant down regulation of IFN-\u03b1 at 4 h post treatment and the expression of IFN-\u03b2 was down regulated at 4 and 8 h posttreatment with CpG ODN while, Pam3CSK4 showed down regulation at 8 and 16 h post-treatment. The LPS induced 35-, 12-and 5-fold increase (significant at P < 0.05) in expression of IFN-\u03b3 in CAM at 4, 8 and 16 h post-treatment, respectively (Fig. 3c). The CpG ODN showed significant up-regulation (approximately 10 fold) at 16 h post-treatment and Pam3CSK4 induced four-fold increase in IFN-\u03b3expression at 16 h posttreatment (Figs. 4(a), (b), (c)). The expression of IL-1\u03b2was significantly up-regulated in CAM treated with LPS at 4, 8 and 16 h post treatment by 452-, 300-and 56fold, respectively (Fig. 5). Treatment of ECEs with Pam3CSK4 significantly up-regulated the expression of IL-1 \u03b2 in CAM at 4, 8 and 16 h post treatment by 96-, 30-and 15-fold, respectively. The CpG ODN demonstrated very low or little effect on expression of IL-1\u03b2 in CAM at all the three intervals.The LPS induced 16-and 10-fold significant (P < 0.05) increase in expression of iNOS in CAM at 4 and 8 h post treatment, respectively",
