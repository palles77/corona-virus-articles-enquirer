            "text": "Asthma, one of the most common chronic diseases of childhood, develops through complex interactions between genetic susceptibilities and environmental exposures. 1, 2 In the United States, acid-suppressant medications (ASMs) are available widely, either by prescription or over-the-counter purchase, and are commonly used throughout the lifespan, including during pregnancy. 3, 4 Recent evidence from outside the United States suggests that prenatal exposure to ASMs may be associated with an increased risk of asthma in children. 5, 6 These previous studies were performed in mostly European populations and were conducted retrospectively in large databases and thus relied primarily on prescription records and diagnosis codes to identify exposures and outcomes. 7 Despite efforts to control for bias and confounding, these retrospective observational studies were potentially affected by misclassification of both the exposure and outcome and inability to adjust for various factors, including maternal atopy. 7 Our objective was to evaluate whether prenatal exposure to ASMs increases the risk of recurrent wheeze in a population of racially/ethnically diverse US children who already are at high risk of developing asthma due to severe bronchiolitis in infancy. We investigated the 35th Multicenter Airway Research Collaboration (MARC-35) cohort composed of children with a history of severe bronchiolitis in infancy. This population is novel due to their racial/ethnic diversity as well as their increased risk of developing asthma due to their bronchiolitis event. 8 Among the 921 participants in the MARC-35 longitudinal cohort, 900 (98%) had complete exposure and outcome data. Exposure was defined by parental report of maternal use of ASMs during pregnancy with either histamine-2 receptor antagonists or proton pump inhibitors. The outcome of recurrent wheeze by age 3 years was defined per the 2007 National Institutes of Health asthma guidelines: (1) having at least 2 corticosteroidrequiring exacerbations within 6 months, or (2) having at least 4 wheezing episodes within 1 year, each lasting at least 1 day and affecting sleep. 9 Unadjusted and adjusted analyses were performed using Cox-proportional hazards modeling stratified by age, with multivariable models adjusted for 9 potential confounders using STATA SE 15.1 (College Station, Texas) (for detailed methods and results, see this article's Online Repository www.jaci-inpractice.org).",

            "text": "To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate prenatal exposure to ASMs and recurrent wheeze in a prospective US based-cohort, and the first to investigate this issue among infants at high risk of developing asthma. The study design and analysis enabled us to limit several potential sources of bias. Direct ascertainment of maternal ASM use from the parent decreases misclassification of the exposure. In the United States, maternal report of ASM use is likely superior to medical record documentation due to availability of these medications by over-thecounter purchase. We report that 16% of mothers used ASMs during pregnancy; however, the baseline population rates of ASM use in pregnancy in the United States have not been accurately identified because of easy over-the-counter purchase. Recurrent wheeze was determined by detailed parental interviews every 6 months and is consistent with current National Institutes of Health guidelines. 9 Thus, we expect less outcome misclassification. Our cohort is racially/ethnically diverse (>50% nonwhite), which may be more generalizable to the US population than previous studies performed primarily in European populations. Finally, we gathered detailed information directly from the children's parents regarding many potential confounders including parental history of allergic disease and sociodemographic and perinatal factors. Despite these adjustments, prenatal ASM exposure had a consistent association with the development of recurrent wheeze in all main analyses.",

            "text": "The underlying mechanism by which ASMs may increase the risk of recurrent wheeze and subsequent asthma is not known. There is evidence to suggest that ASMs, including proton pump inhibitors and histamine-2 receptor antagonists, may predispose to allergic sensitization, the propensity to express T H 2 cytokines, and dysbiosis of the microbiome. 7,10,11 These effects are thought to be related to their common function of suppressing gastric acid. In our study, we found no significant difference in the total IgE between exposed and unexposed infants. However, these samples were collected at enrollment (median age, 3.2 months), which may either be too distant from the exposure or too early in infancy to detect meaningful differences. Likewise, the role of the microbiome is increasingly recognized in the development of asthma 7 ; however, more research is needed to determine whether ASM use is associated with alterations in the microbiome that predispose individuals to developing asthma. Limitations of our study include the observational design, which precludes strong statements about causality. Despite efforts to adjust for confounding, it is possible that unmeasured confounding remains, including confounding by indication. Prenatal exposure to ASMs was obtained at the time of study enrollment, which raises the possibility of recall bias. However, all children were young infants (median age, 3.2 months) at the time of enrollment and all were currently hospitalized for an acute illness; thus, we would not expect maternal recall bias. On the basis of the nature of the data, we are limited in our ability to determine the trimester of exposure in which the effect of ASMs may be the greatest. Most mothers (52%) reported the use of ASMs for at least 4 months, inherently accounting for exposure in more than 1 trimester. All the children in the cohort are at high risk for developing recurrent wheeze due to their shared history of severe bronchiolitis in infancy, which limits the generalizability of the study. However, bronchiolitis is not a rare infection in childhood and is the most common cause of hospitalization in US infants (130,000 hospitalizations/y); thus, although our study is not generalizable to all children, it is generalizable to a large patient population. 8 In conclusion, prenatal ASM exposure appears to further increase the risk of recurrent wheeze in children with a history of severe bronchiolitis in infancy. This finding is important because prenatal exposure to ASMs is modifiable. Although further research is needed in low-risk populations, clinicians may wish to discuss the potential risks and benefits of elective ASM therapy before initiation in pregnancy. We will continue to follow these children for the development of asthma and plan to investigate the association of ASM exposure with this important outcome. We encourage future research on the risk of ASM exposure in a low-risk general population, the risk of bronchiolitis after prenatal exposure to ASMs, the potential for a dose-dependent or trimester-dependent effect of ASM exposure, potential confounding (including confounding by indication), and elucidating the potential underlying mechanism.

Unadjusted and adjusted HRs were calculated using Cox-proportional hazards modeling stratified by the age of the child at enrollment. The assumption of proportional hazards was verified using Schoenfeld residuals. The hazards for age at enrollment were not proportional over time; thus, all multivariable models were specified to stratify by age. Two adjusted models were used to assess for the effect of potential confounders. The first model adjusted for sociodemographic factors including sex, race/ethnicity, and median household income. The fully adjusted model adjusted for sex, race/ethnicity, median household income, maternal history of atopy (asthma, allergic rhinitis, food allergy, or eczema), maternal smoking during pregnancy, gestational age at birth, multiple gestation (eg, twin), mode of delivery, and maternal use of antibiotics during pregnancy before labor. All covariates included in the model were determined a priori on the basis of current understanding of the biologic model. We performed stratified analysis by race/ ethnicity (NHW, NHB, and Hispanic) including full adjustment for the potential confounders listed above. In addition, we performed analysis on the basis of duration of exposure to ASMs during pregnancy (No ASM use, <2 months of use, and 2 months of use) including full adjustment for potential confounders. Statistical significance was determined by a 2-sided P value of less than .05.",
