The dynamics of epidemic spread in large-scale populations are very complex. Further, human behavior, social contact networks, and pandemics are closely intertwined and evolve as the epidemic spread. Individuals' changing behaviors in response to public policies and their evolving perception of how an infectious disease outbreak is unfolding can dramatically alter normal social interactions. Effective planning and response strategies must take these complicated interactions into account. Mathematical models are key to understanding the spread of epidemics. In this chapter, we discuss a recent approach of diffusion in network models for studying the complex dynamics of epidemics in large-scale populations. Analyzing these models leads to very challenging computational problems. Further, using these models for forecasting epidemic spread and developing public health policies leads to issues that are characteristic of big data applications. The chapter describes the state of the art in computational and big data epidemiology.",

Further, just six deadly infectious diseases-pneumonia, tuberculosis, diarrheal diseases, malaria, measles, and more recently HIV/AIDS-account for half of all premature deaths, killing mostly children and young adults. For example, malaria is said to be the primary cause of between 650,000 and 1.4 million deaths just in 2010. Key events related to the history of infectious diseases can be traced as far back as the middle ages (see Fig. 1 ). 1 An epidemic is an occurrence in a community or region, of cases of an illness, specified health behavior or other health-related events in excess of what would be expected normally. The word epidemic is derived from two Greek works: epi (upon) and demos (people) meaning \"upon people.\" A pandemic is an epidemic that spans a large portion of the world, such as the H1N1 outbreak in 2009. In contrast, an endemic disease is one wherein new infections are constantly occurring in the population. Epidemics are thought to have influenced significant historical events including the plagues in Roman times and middle ages, the fall of the Han empire in the third century in China, and the defeat of the Aztecs in the 1500s, due to smallpox outbreak. The 1918 pandemic was responsible for more deaths than those due to World War I. The last 50 years have seen epidemics caused HIV/AIDS, SARS, and influenza-like illnesses (see, e.g., Brauer et al., 2008) .",

By its very definition, the focus of epidemiology is on population-level issues as opposed to medical sciences, which is individual centric. Epidemiologists are primarily concerned with public health, which includes the design of studies, evaluation and interpretation of public health data, and the maintenance of data collection systems. They are interested in studying questions such as (1) What is the spatial extent of the outbreak? (2) How does the disease progress and how can we control it? (3) How did the disease originate and how does this compare to past outbreaks? Such questions have been asked repeatedly throughout human history. The 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa is an example of an epidemic that has caused thousands of deaths, along with significant social and economic impact on the affected countries. 2 An important concern in epidemiology is to control an outbreak. With the advent of modern science, pharmaceutical measures have been widely used to control and prevent outbreaks. For example, vaccines have become a critical method of controlling, preventing, and possibly eradicating infectious diseases in host populations. Despite their success, nonpharmaceutical methods, such as quarantining and social distancing, continue to play a central role in controlling infectious disease outbreaks; they are especially important during an outbreak caused by an emerging pathogen. In such a case, pharmaceutical methods are usually not available.",

Their importance is further highlighted by controlled physical experiments used to understand scientific phenomena being much harder and often impossible in epidemiology due to ethical and practical reasons. The first mathematical model in epidemiology is credited to Daniel Bernoulli in 1760 (Brauer et al., 2008) . Using mathematical techniques, Bernoulli established that variolation 3 could help increase the life expectancy in the French population. Another systematic and data-driven investigation of the spread of epidemics was by John Snow, a British physician, who analyzed a cholera outbreak in London in 1854 and attributed it to a source of contaminated water (Brauer et al., 2008) .",

In 1911, Sir Ronald Ross discovered the malaria vector and transmission due to a species of mosquitoes and later developed a spatial model for the spread of the disease. One of the most significant results from his model was that the spread of malaria could be controlled by reducing the population of malaria below a \"threshold\"-this is the first instance of the concept of an epidemic threshold. Kermack and McKendrik extended this to develop the first general epidemic model, popularly known as the SIR model, involving ordinary differential equations (ODEs) based on a mass-action model (Brauer et al., 2008; Newman, 2003) ; we discuss this later in Section 2.",

Figure 2 illustrates the four key components of variety, velocity, volume, and veracity in epidemiology. The role of computation and big data in epidemiological science has been progressively increasing over the last 20 years. There are several reasons for this change. First, mathematical models have become increasingly complex; it is virtually impossible to solve these models without the use of computers. Second, there is an increasing acceptance of networked models-these models represent the underlying population as a complex interaction network and study the spread of diseases over these interaction networks. These network models are more natural than the traditional compartmental models, but this comes at an increased computational and data cost. For example, the network models we discuss later in Section 6 integrate over 34 public and commercial data sets, leading to over 100 GB of input data for constructing a population model for the USA, with over 300 million people and 100 million locations. In turn, analysis of such data sets requires very powerful computing resources, and novel high-performance computing approaches (Barrett et al., 2008; Bisset et al., 2009a) . Often, many parameters of the models are not known, especially in the early days of an epidemic (e.g., the transmission probability), necessitating parametric studies. Additionally, most policy questions involve comparison and evaluation of different interventions to control epidemics, such as vaccinations and school closures. Individual behavior can have significant impact on the 3. Interestingly, it appears that the idea of variolation to control smallpox was known to Indians and Chinese as early as the eighth century AD. This method involved exposing people to material from smallpox scabs from infected individuals; see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inoculation for more details. disease dynamics (Funk et al., 2010; Lipsitch et al., 2009 ) and further increase the number of instances that need to be done. Third, epidemiologists are collecting increased amounts of data from the field. New methods are being developed for disease surveillance and detection. Although extremely valuable, the data need to be managed at all levels. Computational methods for data management, including methods to collect, store, clean, organize, search, fuse, and analyze data, are all important. Finally, with the advent of the world wide web, there is a growing demand for developing web-based tools that can be accessed by epidemiologists in a pervasive manner. An example of this is the HealthMap tool, which collects data about disease incidence all over the world, through news and social media data (Fig. 3a) . Another tool is Google's FluTrends, which infers flu incidence from search queries, e.g., related to flu medication, news, etc. (Fig. 3b) . Overall, big data play a large and important role in epidemiology (Salath\u00e9 et al., 2012) .",

R 0 is known as the \"reproductive number\" and is key in characterizing an epidemic. At the start of an epidemic, much of the public health effort is focused on estimating R 0 from observed infections (Lipsitch et al., 2003) . Further, public health decision making for controlling an epidemic is often translated to reducing R 0 -this can be done in many ways, such as by reducing \u03b2 through better protective measures, such as washing and face masks, in the case of flu (Dimitrov and Meyers, 2010) . While the notion of R 0 has given a lot of insights into the spread of epidemics, it has several limitations, especially in practice. For instance, during the SARS outbreak in 2003, R 0 was estimated to be in the range [2.2, 3.6]. However, despite its spread over many countries, it I R S",

Figure 5 shows an example of the SIR model on a network. The time series (|I(t)|, t = 0, 1, . . .) is referred to as an epidemic curve corresponding to a stochastic outcome; this is a very commonly used quantity related to an epidemic. The total number of infections for an outcome is given by t |I(t)|. The peak value is max t |I(t)|, while the time to peak is the largest time t that maximizes |I(t)|. These quantities are illustrated in Fig. 6 . Also observe that the epicurve is not very smooth; this is in contrast with the epicurve in an ODE model. A popular variant of the SIR model is the SIS model, in which an infected node switches to state S after the infectious duration. Some of the notation used in the paper is summarized in Table 1 . Such a network model captures the interplay between the three components of computational epidemiology: (i) individual behaviors of agents; (ii) unstructured, heterogeneous multiscale networks; and (iii) the dynamical processes on these networks. It is based on the hypothesis that a better understanding of the characteristics of the underlying network and individual behavioral adaptation can give better insights into contagion dynamics and response strategies. Although computationally expensive and data intensive, network-based epidemiology alters the types of questions that can be posed, providing qualitatively different insights into disease dynamics and public health policies. It also allows policy makers to formulate and investigate potentially novel-and context-specific interventions. Such epidemic models are instances of a more general dynamical systems framework, called graph dynamical systems (GDSs) (Mortveit and Reidys, 2007) . Therefore, the theory of GDS can be used as a ",

A fundamental question is to characterize the conditions under which there is a \"large\" outbreak, which is defined as one which infects (n) individuals, where n = |V|. We mention a few of the main results of this kind for the SIR and SIS models. These are somewhat involved to derive here, and we give references for more details. A common approach is to try to characterize the dynamics in terms of the degree distribution of the graph. The simplest case is when G is a complete graph, with a uniform probability \u03b2 of the disease spread from u to v, and \u03c4 (u) = 1. The classical result by Erd\u0151s-Renyi (Marathe and Vullikanti, 2013; Newman, 2003) implies that there is a large outbreak with (n) infections, if and only if \u03b2 > 1/n. The main technique is a branching process analysis. We note that this result for the complete graph is a discrete analogue of the characterization in terms of R 0 , with n\u03b2, the expected number of infections caused by a node, being the equivalent of R 0 . The existence of such a threshold for disease spread has been shown to exist in other well-structured graph classes, such as lattices and random regular graphs (Newman, 2003) . It is much more challenging to prove such statements in heterogeneous graphs with less symmetry. Pastor-Satorras and Vespignani (2001) use techniques from statistical mechanics to show that in scale-free network models, under mean-field assumptions the threshold for epidemics propagation is 0, i.e., no matter how small the probability of infection is, there would be a large outbreak. Two settings for which rigorous results are known, without using any mean-field assumptions, are (i) the Chung-Lu model (Chung and Lu, 2002) , which is a random graph model in which the probability of an edge (i, j) is proportional to w i \u00b7 w j , for a given weight sequence w; and (ii) classes of expander graphs (Alon et al., 2004) .",

Similarly, the transmission probability and the initial configuration, such as the source of the infection might not be known.

At the onset of an outbreak (e.g., in every flu season), recurring problems for public policy planners include determining where the epidemic might have started, characteristics of the specific disease strain, and if there will be a large epidemic or pandemic. These are significant data and computational challenges, where statistical and machine learning approaches have an important role. General abstractions of this problem are to determine the transmission probability or other disease characteristics, or the probability that the source of the epidemic is a node v, conditioned on observed surveillance data and some assumptions about the prior distribution, or to find a maximum likelihood estimator for them. A related class of problems is to infer the underlying contact network properties, based on such observations. These are very challenging problems because (i) surveillance data on who is infected are limited and noisy-only a fraction of the infected people are detected; (ii) the underlying contact graph is only partially known and is dynamic.

They also develop a heuristic, called rumor centrality, which allows faster estimation of the source probability. The related problem of inferring the contact network based on the disease spread information has been studied by Netrapalli and Sanghavi (2012) and Gomez-Rodriguez et al.

Many of such interfaces around the world have been identified as hot spots of emerging zoonotic infectious diseases, in which an array of ever-increasing human activities such as farming, mining, logging, and hunting are being conducted against the backdrop of significant wildlife biodiversity, of course, with concomitant microbial diversity (Morse et al., 2012) . Perhaps the regions in which environmental changes have been occurring most rapidly, and where people and wildlife live in close proximity, are located mostly in the developing world, and which, ironically, have limited resources and capacity to monitor and respond to zoonotic outbreaks. Morse et al. (2012) described a three-stage model for typical dynamics of transmission of zoonotic diseases from a localized hot spot to a global pandemic. In preemergence stage 1, a pathogen is localized in its natural animal reservoir but could be driven by certain major ecological or environmental disturbances, which increases the likelihood of its coming to contact with, and spilling over to, new species including livestock or humans that are in increasingly close contact. For instance, the recent outbreak of Ebola has been brought back to focus the issue of \"growing human activity and deforestation in previously untouched forests.\" 5 The 2002 SARS outbreak in China was traced to hunting and trading of bats that are natural reservoirs of SARS-like corona viruses (Li et al., 2005) .",

A large-scale pandemic occurs in stage 3 and is quite rare. It is usually attributed to global travel and trade and characterized by sustained interpersonal transmission and international spread of reservoir hosts or vectors. To address the problem of zoonosis, clearly the most desirable objective is to tackle and limit the transmission of a zoonotic pathogen, if possible, in stage 1. Unfortunately, the global trend in emerging infectious diseases has seen increasing incidence since 1940, despite controlling for effects of higher reporting (Jones et al., 2008) . It was found that 60% of known human infectious diseases, and more than 75% of emerging infections, have zoonotic origin (King et al., 2006; Taylor et al., 2001) . In fact, 71.8% of zoonotic pathogens originated in wildlife species. Approximately 80% of the identified reservoirs are mammalian, and almost half of the observed 1000 pathogens noted in livestock and pets are zoonotic. Indeed, almost 80% of the viruses and 50% of the bacteria that infect humans are of zoonotic origin. A conservative estimate puts the number of viruses present in vertebrate species at 1 million, which suggests that more than 99.9% of the viruses are currently unknown (Lipkin, 2009 ). While such staggering numbers are a matter of great concern, it also presents a perspective to the researchers so that they may be prepared to approach the problem in a comprehensive and systematic manner. Data on such pathogens and their evolution help in disease surveillance and 5. http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2014/07/08/how-deforestation-andhuman-activity-could-be-to-blame-for-the-ebola-pandemic/.",

Importantly, the need for a concerted, interdisciplinary approach has been felt in public health research, bringing together teams of epidemiologists, clinicians, veterinarians, microbiologists, wildlife biologists, ecologists, data analysts, and public health officials. Apparently, a global strategy seems to be emerging for monitoring and biosurveillance, partly driven by concerns of bioterrorism. However, the coverage or efficiency of public health surveillance systems worldwide is still far from uniform. Notable efforts in this direction are made with the help of social media (Lipkin, 2013) . ProMED (Program for Monitoring Emerging Infectious Diseases) was created in 1994. In a bottom-up manner, a network of reader at the grassroots submits entries that are then curated by an expert panel that sends ProMED-mail with commentary in five languages to a listserv exceeding 60,000 subscribers in 185 different countries. A private subscription-based service GPHIN (Global Public Health Intelligence Network) receives information on global outbreaks by scanning worldwide news in nine languages. In 2001, GPHIN joined the WHO Global Outbreak Alert Response Network (GOARN), which included additional verification services to its reporting. HealthMap. org, launched in 2006, is a user-friendly map-based online display system for real-time crowd-sourced submission of reports of worldwide georeferenced observations from news media, either through its web site or through a number of smart-phone-based apps (e.g., Outbreaks Near Me).

As an example of this approach, the PREDICT project of the Emerging Pandemic Threats (EPT) program launched by US Agency for International Development (USAID) in 2009 aims to facilitate predictive modeling for the identification of the most likely regions, hosts, and human-animal interfaces for forthcoming emergence of zoonoses (Morse et al., 2012) .",

To create sophisticated models for forecasting, the researchers must consider high-dimensional data on a large number of parameters: socioeconomic drivers (e.g., population growth and density, mixing patterns, migration, trade, agricultural practices, sanitation, age, diet, vaccination, drug and antibiotic use, cultural norms, occupational exposures, nutritional and immunological status), wildlife diversity, contact frequency, relatedness of host species, relatedness of microbial species present in host, evolvability of pathogens, host-pathogen coevolution, and several general factors such as capacities for reporting and response on the ground, geographical, and ecological conditions, and so on. An array of tools designed for predictive analytics, ranging from neural networks and tree models and regression models based on the observed parameters, to complex representations such as Bayesian network models that can capture their underlying dependence structure, are gaining in popularity (Buczak et al., 2013; Cooper et al., 2006) .",

Just like weather systems and markets, epidemics are complex systems; as a result forecasting the future incidence rates is challenging. See (Shaman and Karspeck, 2012; Shaman et al., 2010a,b) . An important contribution of their work was to elucidate the role of weather (humidity) on the incidence rates. In a recent paper (Chakraborty et al., 2014b) , as a part of the IARPA-funded EMBERS project, we analyzed the generation of robust quantitative predictions about temporal trends of flu activity, using several surrogate data sources for 15 Latin American countries. We also recently participated in the CDC flu challenge and used our models to develop real-time flu forecasts for the nine US regions. An important consideration in both cases was to produce predictions in real time before the event and compare these forecasts retrospectively using curated data sets from CDC and PAHO. See https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/ 2013/11/25/2013-28198/announcement-of-requirements-and-registration-forthe-predict-the-influenza-season-challenge. Recently, other agencies have also put out similar competitions, e.g., a similar competition for chikungunya was initiated by DARPA (see https://www.innocentive.com/ar/challenge/9933617). The challenges have helped focus renewed interest on developing innovative techniques for infectious disease forecasting.",

Classically, Koch's postulates, formulated by Koch and Loeffler in 1884, have served as the gold standard criteria to establish a causative relationship between a microbe and a disease. They require that the agent must be present in all cases of the disease, it must be specific, and it must be isolated and cultivated as culture, which, if inoculated in a healthy host is, must be sufficient to reproduce the original disease. With the advent of molecular methods, these criteria were modified to allow sequence-based identification of microbial pathogens by Fredricks and Relman. Recently, \"metagenomic Koch's postulates\" were proposed such that metagenomic markers (individual sequence reads, assembled contigs, genes, or genomes) could be used to detect viruses, most of which are not easy to culture (Mokili et al., 2012) . An integrative approach to establish causation was described by Lipkin (2013) in terms of possible, probable, and confirmed causal relationships.",

In the 1990s, the advent of high-throughput \"omic platforms revolutionized rapid, cost-effective molecular data generation, enabled by important methodological advances in statistics and bioinformatics, paved the way for unbiased, data-driven discoveries\". Multiplex PCR arrays, mass spectrometry, microarrays, and high-throughput sequencing are now routinely used for microbial analysis.

In fact, with a flexibly designed set of probes, and the compactness of 8-10 million spots, the possibility of having a single chip that can test for all the known viruses, at least for narrowing down to the level of genus or family, for the price of just $20 or less, is not far-fetched (Vaidyanathan, 2011) . The ViroChip was used to detect the presence of coronavirus family in the respiratory samples of SARS in less than 24 h and without the need for culturing the virus (Chen et al., 2011) . Besides the pan-viral ViroChip, there are also the pan-microbial microarrays such as GreeneChip (Palacios et al., 2007) and LLMDA (Gardner et al., 2010) . The trend is to use components that can make such platforms in the future even more specific in their detection capacity and smaller in size so that they could be more effective and easily deployed in the field.

However, the more recent and currently the most widely used HTS systems are from Illumina, which include the massively parallel HiSeq 2000, and the faster but lower throughput MiSeq (Firth and Lipkin, 2013) . The selection of an HTS system for pathogen discovery is determined by various factors. First, as the pathogen genomes, especially viral genomes, are relatively small compared to that of hosts, the amount of template required for input must not be prohibitive. In particular, in tissue or fecal samples, the ratio of viral to background material is often quite low. This leads to steps of careful steps toward enriching the agent (or host depletion) during sample preparation for HTS (Firth and Lipkin, 2013) . The two key HTS parameters for pathogen discovery are the read length and the depth of coverage. While reads must be long enough (at least 100-300 bases) to allow unambiguous identification of the agent as distinctively as possible from the host or background sequences, the read depth (i.e., the number of sequence reads per run), on the other hand, must be reasonably high to allow easy assembly of the microbial genome and thus enable sensitive detection. Illumina platforms generate almost 10-1000 times more data per run with much smaller read lengths (HiSeq 600 Gb, 150 bases; MiSeq 3 Gb, 250 bases) as compared to GS FLX (0.7 Gb, up to 700 bases) but they also take significantly longer runtime (HiSeq 11 days, MiSeq 27 h, GS FLX 8 h) (Chiu, 2013; Firth and Lipkin, 2013) . Clearly, running time and costs are critical factors, especially during an outbreak. Fortunately, the per-base cost of sequencing has fallen steadily, from $5000 per megabase in 2001 using classical dideoxy methods to $0.50 per megabase in 2012 using the Illumina platform (Lipkin, 2013) . A virus that might have taken a week to sequence a decade ago (say, SARS-coronovirus in 2003) now requires at most a day to finish. Further, access to HTS labs is also gradually increasing worldwide.",

Traditionally, the computational pipelines for pathogen detection have involved the key steps of (a) computational subtraction of the host or background sequences using reference databases, and (b) BLAST homology search of the target agent against all known microbes. If BLASTn search by nucleotide homology does not work well for identification of distantly related or novel pathogens, then protein-level similarity with translated BLASTx query is used to explore further, especially for long reads exceeding 150 bases (Firth and Lipkin, 2013) . More divergent relationships are explored with frameworks such as PHI-BLAST or HMMER (Finn et al., 2011) . In the recent years, several analytical pipelines, such as PathSeq, CaPSID, and READSCAN, were developed specifically for HTS-based pathogen discovery, e.g., Kostic et al. (2011 ), Borozan et al.

Single-cell analysis (SCA), followed by metagenomics using HTS, can significantly improve the sensitivity of microbial detection (Blainey, 2013) . In SCA, individual cells are first isolated from the sample, captured separately (say, in microfluidic chips), and then sent for metagenomic or metatranscriptomic analysis. This obviates the need for post hoc computational separation of the microbial genomes. While multiple projects in single-cell genomics have been conducted with bacterial species, recently single viral genomics (SVG) was conducted by Allen et al. (2011) . Using platforms such as flow cytometry, single virions were selectively isolated before sequencing was carried out. Interestingly, by incorporating an intermediate reverse-transcription step prior to HTS, the SVG approach could be particularly useful in the genomic analysis of viral heterogeneity, especially for RNA viruses, which have much higher mutation rates during replication (and absence of error-correction), and thus form viral quasispecies (Holmes, 2009) . With their high mutation and replication rates, and under selective pressures from the use of drugs and vaccines, RNA viruses can quickly evolve to use new cell receptors or routes of transmission in unexpected host species (Firth and Lipkin, 2013) .",

While the overall genomic collection of the discovered viral pathogens continues to grow, simultaneously, the pathogens keep on evolving and there are both new emergence as well as reemergence of infectious diseases. In particular, the evolvability of RNA viruses, given their high mutation rates and large population sizes, allows such evolution to take place in actual timescales of human observation. The field of phylodynamics, therefore, seeks to combine data from both phylogenetics and epidemiological dynamics (Grenfell et al., 2004) . This combined approach can allow more effective prediction of the epidemiological impact of newly emerged or evolved viruses. Further, Holmes and Grenfell (2009) suggest simultaneous collection of data of different types such as (a) spatiotemporal dynamics of the disease , (b) viral genome sequences, (c) contact networks of susceptible host individuals, and (d) the immune history of the individuals in contact networks, which, taken together, \"are key for understanding both the dynamics of epidemic spread and the evolutionary pressures that shape virus diversity.\" An example of such integrative analysis is given in Cottam et al. (2008) .",

By analyzing possible interactions between the viral and immune dynamics within the infected hosts, one can determine the trajectory of pathogenic adaptations in real time. Algorithms to model normal immunologic profiles in the population can help in both outbreak prediction and detection (Pyne et al., 2009 (Pyne et al., , 2014 Ray and Pyne, 2012) . It can provide critical insights into the spatiotemporal spread of specific infections in given populations, help in estimation of R 0 , and inferring viral phenotypes (e.g., virulence, transmissibility) (Volz et al., 2013) . Under different phylodynamic processes, the viral phylogenetic tree shapes assume different spatiotemporal patterns depending on the strength of the immune-driven selection (Grenfell et al., 2004) . Finally, phylodynamics also allows viral diversity to be studied statistically using the coalescent theory, which links phylogenetic structures with ecological processes, often to reconstruct demographic histories of infected individuals, or to estimate the parameters of infectious disease dynamics (Pybus and Rambaut, 2009; Suchard and Rambaut, 2009) . For this purpose, parallel algorithms and high-performance computing have been used to support computationally intensive Bayesian frameworks to run on large data sets, e.g., Suchard and Rambaut (2009) and Ayres (2012) . New platforms like OutbreakTools provide special formats to represent epidemiologic and sequence data together to allow statistical analysis, simulation, and visualization (Jombart et al., 2014) . Owing to the HTS platforms, presently more than 16,000 human and avian isolates have been completely sequenced in the Influenza Genome Sequencing Project. In the near future, programs for discovery of pathogens and prediction of their transmission dynamics in host populations thus clearly seem to belong to the field of big data analytics.",

As discussed earlier, a common approach to deal with lack of realistic data is to use simplified stochastic models, which match aggregate properties, e.g., degree distribution (Chung and Lu, 2002; Newman, 2003) . However, as argued by Li et al. (2004) , and many other researchers subsequently, there are significant limitations to such simplified models. We describe first-principles-based methods for generating synthetic regional and national scale social contact networks (Barrett et al., 2005; Eubank et al., 2004b) . Unlike simple random graph techniques, these methods use real world data sources and combine them with behavioral and social theories to synthesize networks. This work builds on the TRANSIMS modeling environment (Barrett et al., 2000 (Barrett et al., , 2001 Beckman et al., 1996) and has since been extended (Barrett et al., 2009 ). This approach integrates over a dozen public and commercial data sets and involves four broad steps discussed below; see Barrett et al. (2005 Barrett et al. ( , 2009 Eubank et al.

Each synthetic individual is created in the context of a household with other synthetic individuals, and each household is located geographically. The second step involves the construction of a set of activity templates for households, based on several thousand responses to an activity or time-use survey. These activity templates include the sort of activities each household member performs and the time of day they are performed. Locations are selected for all activities, following capacity constraints, and models from transportation literature. Detailed route plans are assigned to individuals in the third step, based on the locations where activities are performed and the road network that connects the locations.

Both of these modifying factors imply that the underlying social network is constantly changing. In fact, individual behaviors, public policies, disease dynamics, and the social contact networks that they generate interact and coevolve as the outbreak progresses. The recent SARS epidemic served as an excellent example of how individual behavior as well as public policies played an important role in changing the social network.",

            "text": "Health scientists have developed verbal or conceptual behavioral models (Bandura, 1986; Becker, 1974) to understand the role of behaviors in public health. These models have played an important role in understanding behaviors and its relationship with diseases and maintaining a healthy life. These include the Health Belief Model (HBM) (Becker, 1974) , models based on the Social Cognitive Theory (SCT) (Bandura, 1986) , and the Social Ecological Model (SET). Verbal social and behavioral theories have proven useful in improving public health-but are often informal. These informal models need to be represented as formal computer procedures when using computer models to study epidemics. This turns out to be challenging. The role of information is critical in how such models are developed. We have investigated behavioral models based on (i) role of information (kind of information: space, time, and networked; type of information: local or global; and completeness of information), (ii) computational considerations (efficiency of encoding, computational resources required expressiveness of the language), and (iii) scale of behavior: individual, collective, and institutional, and it is quite demanding to identify the data necessary to instantiate in silico behavioral models. Recent advances in social media, computational turks, online games, online surveys, and digital traces are potentially exciting new ways to make progress in this direction. Of course availability of these data sets poses new kinds of questions, including (i) design to elicit truthful behavior, (ii) biases in data due to the demographics of participants, and (iii) translating behaviors in virtual world to the real world. See Funk et al. (2009 ), Salath\u00e9 et al. (2012 , and Barrett et al. (2010) for recent discussion on this emerging topic.",

            "text": "As discussed earlier in Section 3, phase-space properties of epidemic models have been analyzed mathematically for a small class of random and regular graph models. Computing disease dynamics over complex social contact networks is a computationally challenging problem, motivating the need for efficient simulations to calculate the spatiotemporal disease propagation. One of the first such simulations was EpiSims (Eubank, 2002; Eubank et al., 2004b; Mniszewski et al., 2008) , which had a powerful modeling environment, but was not able to scale to large networks very easily. We have developed three different tools, Episimdemics (Barrett et al., 2008; Bisset et al., 2009b) , EpiFast (Bisset et al., 2009a) , and Indemics (Bisset et al., 2010a (Bisset et al., ,b, 2011 Deodhar et al., 2012; Ma et al., 2011a,b )-these provide a trade-off between computation speed, model realism and sophistication, and ease of introducing new behavior and interventions. All three can be executed on traditional distributed memory clusters of varying sizes. EpiSimdemics is quite general and flexible, at the cost of decreased computational speed. It is an interaction-based, highly resolved modeling and simulation system for representing and reasoning about contagion diffusion across large (300 million nodes and 1.5 billion edges) networks. EpiFast (Bisset et al., 2009a ) is a reaction-diffusion model that runs on an explicit social networks. It is based on a client-serve bulk synchronous computing paradigm and runs extremely fast-a single run on a network with 10 million nodes and 500 million edges take about 40 s on a 40-core machine. Indemics is an extension to EpiFast that integrates database computing to enable the most general set of interventions that are the easiest to create, but at the loss of computational speed (Bisset et al., 2010a (Bisset et al., ,b, 2011 Deodhar et al., 2012; Ma et al., 2011a,b) .

The size and scale of the data and the expertise required to use the simulations demand a user friendly environment that provides an easy way to set up experiments and analyze the results. Recently, a number of visual analytics tools have been developed to support epidemiological research (see Livnat et al., 2010 Livnat et al., , 2012 . We have built a tool called the SIBEL. 6 See http://isisdemo.vbi.vt.edu/ didactic/isis.html for a demo version of SIBEL that allows a user to set up detailed factorial experiments (see Fig. 7 ). Using a simple interface to an underlying digital library, a user can choose from among many preconstructed instances: (i) a social contact network; (ii) a within-host disease progression model; and (iii) a set of interventions. Each intervention requires additional details such as compliance level, subpopulations to which the interventions are applied and intervention triggers. An experiment consists of sweeping one or more parameters across a user-specified range of values. After setting up the experiment, the user is provided access to the results of the simulations. A set of basic analyses are performed automatically and the results are displayed. The standard plots and epidemic curves provide very detailed information about the epidemic. Additional information such as the spatiotemporal dynamics and disease dendrogram (how the disease moved over the social network) is also available. A key aspect of this tool is its simplicity-we can train public health analysts to make effective use of the system in about 3 h. Several other groups are actively developing similar systems. They include: (i) The Biosurveillance Ecosystem (BSV) being developed by DTRA; (ii) The BARD model repository at the Los Alamos National Laboratory; (iii) The Texas Pandemic toolkit being developed at the University of Texas, Austin, http://flu.tacc.utexas.edu/; (iv) The MIDAS funded Apollo project at the University of Pittsburgh and the framework at RTI; (v) The FRED modeling framework at the University of Pittsburgh; and (vi) The EpiC framework being developed by MoBs laboratory at Northeastern University.
