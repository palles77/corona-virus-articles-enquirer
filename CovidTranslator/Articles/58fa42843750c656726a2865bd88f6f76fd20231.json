ADEM typically occurs as a post-infectious phenomenon, and usually presents a monophasic episode, but also includes recurrent and multiphasic forms. We report a case of ADEM associated with hepatitis B virus (HBV) reinfection. After steroid and IV immunoglobulin treatment, neurologic symptoms were improved. We suppose that the HBV reinfection was the cause of ADEM, but possible pathogenetic mechanism is still obscure.",
