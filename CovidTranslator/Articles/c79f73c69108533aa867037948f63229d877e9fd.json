This is especially evident for the cell surface membranes of eukaryotic cells in which glycoproteins aid the regulation of many cellular activities in response to various extracellular stimuli. In order to function the hydrophobic regions of the glycoprotein must interact specifically with the lipids of the membrane bilayer. Although information on the molecular basis of these interactions is still very limited one important aspect may be concerned with the covalent modification of membrane-bound glycoproteins through the attachment of fatty acids during biosynthesis.",
