Although TTF-1 inhibits the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition induced by transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) in lung adenocarcinoma cells, the mechanism through which TTF-1 inhibits the functions of TGF-\u03b2 is unknown. Here we show that TTF-1 disrupts the nuclear Smad3-Smad4 complex without affecting the nuclear localization of phospho-Smad3. Genome-wide analysis by chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing revealed that TTF-1 colocalizes with Smad3 on chromatin and alters Smad3-binding patterns throughout the genome, while TTF-1 generally inhibits Smad4 binding to chromatin. Moreover, Smad3 binds to chromatin together with TTF-1, but not with Smad4, at some Smad3-binding regions when TGF-\u03b2 signaling is absent, and knockdown of Smad4 expression does not attenuate Smad3 binding in these regions. Thus, TTF-1 may compete with Smad4 for interaction with Smad3, and in the presence of TTF-1, Smad3 regulates the transcription of certain genes independently of Smad4. These findings provide a new model of regulation of TGF-\u03b2-Smad signaling by TTF-1.",

Among patients with lung adenocarcinoma, those with TTF-1-positive cancer exhibit better prognosis than those with TTF1-negative cancer [4] [5] [6] . Using a transgenic lung cancer mouse model, deletion of TTF-1 has been shown to promote invasion and metastasis of lung adenocarcinoma, in part due to the role of TTF-1 in HMGA2 expression [7] . TTF-1 was also shown to reduce cell motility and metastasis through induction of MYBPH expression [8] . These findings strongly suggest that TTF-1 functions as a tumor suppressor in lung adenocarcinoma. In contrast, genomics analyses revealed that human TTF1/NKX2-1 gene was amplified in 10%-15% of lung adenocarcinomas; it is therefore called a lineage-survival oncogene [9] [10] [11] [12] . TTF-1 has been shown to exhibit a pro-survival effect by inducing ROR1 expression, which enhances AKT signaling through the EGF-ErbB3-PI3 kinase axis [13] . It has also recently been reported that amplified TTF-1 and FOXA1 cooperatively regulate expression of the LMO3 oncogene, which me-npg www.cell-research.com | Cell Research diates cell survival downstream of TTF-1 [14] . Although the precise mechanism(s) of favorable prognosis brought by TTF-1 remains unknown, it is possible that TTF-1 interacts with other transcription factors and alters their signaling activities.",

TGF-\u03b2 binds to type II and type I receptors, resulting in phosphorylation of the receptor-regulated Smads (R-Smads): Smad2 and Smad3. R-Smads form hetero-oligomeric complexes with Smad4, and translocate into the nucleus [15, 16] , where they regulate the transcription of target genes through interaction with other transcription factors. Smad3 and Smad4 bind directly to chromatin through their N-terminal MH1 domains; Smad2 does not bind directly to chromatin because of an insert sequence that is present in its MH1 domain [17, 18] . Several groups have reported genome-wide analyses of the binding patterns of TGF-\u03b2 receptor-regulated Smads in various cancer cell lines and embryonic stem cell-derived cells [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] . These results reveal varied Smad-binding profiles in different cell types, indicating that \"cell-specific context\" is important for the response to TGF-\u03b2 signaling.",

We previously reported that TTF-1 inhibits TGF-\u03b2-induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in lung adenocarcinoma cells [28] . Conversely, TGF-\u03b2 decreased endogenous expression of TTF-1 [28] . Thus, functional links between TTF-1 and TGF-\u03b2 signaling appear to be important for the progression of lung adenocarcinoma. Genome-wide analyses of TTF-1 binding have recently been reported [14, 29] ; however, how TTF-1 regulates TGF-\u03b2-Smad signaling remains to be elucidated. Here, we identified and compared Smad3-, Smad4-and TTF-1-binding sites in the H441 lung adenocarcinoma cell line to understand the mechanism by which TTF-1 inhibits TGF-\u03b2 signaling. Our data suggest that TTF-1 regulates TGF-\u03b2-Smad signaling by competing with Smad4, and that Smad3 acts together with TTF-1 to regulate expression of certain genes, e.g., LMO3, in a Smad4-independent manner. TTF-1 may therefore contribute to context-dependent regulation of TGF-\u03b2 and Smad3 signaling in lung epithelial cells and lung adenocarcinoma cells.",

Exogenous expression of TTF-1 strongly inhibited the binding of Smad3 to the plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1, also known as SER-PINE1) and SMAD7 promoters ( Figure 1E ). Next, we A549 cells were infected with adenoviral vectors as in A. Nucleic and cytoplasmic fractions of the cells were obtained 2 h after TGF-\u03b2 stimulation, and the levels of phosphorylated Smad3 (pSmad3), total Smad3 (tSmad3) and Smad4 were detected by IB. (C, D) A549 cells infected with the indicated adenoviral vectors (AdLacZ or AdTTF-1) (C) and H441 cells transfected with control siRNA (siControl) or TTF-1 siRNA (siTTF-1) (D) were treated with TGF-\u03b2 for 1.5 h, and the Smad3-Smad4 complex was detected using anti-Smad3 and anti-Smad4 antibodies. PLA signals (red) detected in the nuclei (blue) of A549 cells infected with AdLacZ or AdTTF-1 or H441 cells treated with siControl or siTTF-1 were counted (right panels).

(F) A549 cells were transfected with the TTF-1-expression vector or control vector and treated with TGF-\u03b2 for 12 h or SB431542 for 12 h. Luciferase reporter assays using PAI-1-luc containing PAI-1 natural promoter or 9\u00d7 CAGA-luc containing tandemly repeated SBEs were performed. npg www.cell-research.com | Cell Research examined the effects of TTF-1 on TGF-\u03b2-induced transcription using a luciferase reporter containing the PAI-1 promoter (PAI-1-luc) and a reporter containing tandemly repeated Smad-binding elements (SBEs; 9\u00d7 CAGA-luc). TTF-1 overexpression inhibited the promoter activity of PAI-1-luc induced by TGF-\u03b2, but did not affect that of 9\u00d7 CAGA-luc ( Figure 1F ). However, treatment with the TGF-\u03b2 type I receptor inhibitor SB431542 effectively reduced TGF-\u03b2-induced activation of both reporters ( Figure  1F ). These findings suggest that certain cis-regulatory element(s) other than the canonical SBE might be required for TTF-1 to inhibit Smad-induced transcription.",

We then calculated the siControl/siTTF-1 ratio of the read counts at each binding peak. If this ratio is high, then TTF-1 does not tend to inhibit Smad3 binding in the respective region. If the ratio is low, the binding strength of Smad3 in the respective region is likely to be attenuated by the presence of TTF-1. We arranged the Smad3-binding peaks with respect to these ratios, chose the top 2 000 and bottom 2 011 peaks and examined whether there were any TTF-1-binding region(s) within 200 bps of the peak summit. Interestingly, more than 80% of the top 2 000 binding peaks have TTF-1-binding regions within 200 bps of their binding summits, while TTF-1 binds to only 8% of the bottom 2 011 peaks ( Figure  2C ). Therefore, Smad3 colocalizes with TTF-1 on chromatin in the presence of TTF-1, and the inhibitory effect of TTF-1 on Smad3 does not appear to be induced by competition in chromatin binding.",

These Smad3-binding peaks were common to TTF-1 binding, and were therefore termed Smad3-TTF-1-requiring loci (STRL). We identified the genes nearest to these loci, and compared their expression in the presence and absence of TGF-\u03b2. Genes located near the STRL, whose expression levels were reduced by more than half after 24 h of TGF-\u03b2 stimulation, are shown in Supplementary information, Table S8 , including LMO3, which exhibits pro-survival effects in adenocarcinoma cells [14] . To determine whether Smad3 binding to the STRL is regulated by TGF-\u03b2 signaling, we performed ChIP-qPCR analysis at these loci in the presence of TGF-\u03b2 or the TGF-\u03b2 type I receptor inhibitor SB431542. Surprisingly, Smad3 bound strongly to these loci in the presence of SB431542, and TGF-\u03b2 treatment reduced the respective binding strengths of Smad3 to these loci ( Figure 4A, left) . Moreover, knockdown of Smad4 did not attenuate Smad3 binding to these loci ( Figure 4A , right), suggesting that Smad3 binds to these loci independently of Smad4. We confirmed colocalization of Smad3 and TTF-1 at the LMO3 region by sequential ChIP using TTF-1 and Smad3 antibodies (Supplementary information, Figure S5 ). We also found that Smad2 colocalized with TTF-1 at this region, possibly through interaction of Smad2 with Smad3. We examined whether Smad3 or Smad4 affects mRNA expression of these genes, and found that knockdown of either Smad3 or Smad4 cancelled the effects of TGF-\u03b2 ( Figure 4B ). By knocking down Smad3, the basal expression level of LMO3 was increased, whereas those of SDPR and FBP1 were reduced, suggesting that Smad3 could act as both a repressor and an activator of genes close to the STRL. Expression levels of those genes in A549 cells (which lack endogenous TTF-1 expression) were comparable to those in H441 cells (which express TTF-1) treated with TGF-\u03b2 for 24 h, suggesting that binding of TTF-1-Smad3 complex to these target regions is important for regulating the expression of these genes in H441 cells.",

Smad3 colocalizes with TTF-1 in certain chromatin regions ( Figure 2B ), while Smad4 was not detected at chromatin in the presence of TTF-1 in the PAI-1 regions ( Figure 2D ). In addition, Smad4-binding strengths were weaker than those of Smad3 at the Smad3-binding sites where TTF-1 strongly bound, and this tendency was cancelled by knockdown of TTF-1 ( Figure 2H ).

Also, SARS-associated coronavirus nucleocapsid protein was reported to interact with Smad3, acting competitively with Smad4, and modulate the expression of target genes of TGF-\u03b2 signaling [34] .

In the present study, we have shown that LMO3 expression was regulated by the Smad3-TTF-1 complex in H441 cells. On the other hand, TTF-1 inhibits TGF\u03b2-induced EMT [28] , and thus functions as a tumor suppressor gene. TTF-1 may thus have two different effects that are opposite to the effects induced by TGF-\u03b2 signaling: pro-survival and anti-EMT functions. The ontology analysis of the microarray data of H441 cells by DAVID ( Figure 3B and 3C) supports these observations. TTF-1 regulates specific genes in alveolar epithelial cells, while TGF-\u03b2 induces EMT. Thus, the balance between TTF-1 expression and TGF-\u03b2 signaling may be very important for differentiation of lung epithelial cells and progression of lung adenocarcinoma. TTF-1 inhibits parts of TGF-\u03b2 signaling, and TGF-\u03b2 conversely inhibits the function of TTF-1. Interaction of Smad3 with TTF-1 did not alter the binding profiles of TTF-1 to chromatin (Supplementary information, Figure S6A and S6B). Of note, TGF-\u03b2 reduced the expression of TTF-1 mRNA only at later time points (Supplementary information, Figure S4A ), while TTF-1 binding to chromatin was rapidly inhibited by TGF-\u03b2, suggesting that some other mechanisms are important in regulation of the function of TTF-1 by TGF-\u03b2 signaling.",

Furthermore, we observed that expression levels of some other genes that are known to be involved in EMT are regulated by TGF-\u03b2 and TTF-1. ITGA5 is reportedly up-regulated during EMT. Moreover, integrin \u03b15 (encoded by ITGA5) interacts with the extracellular matrix and enhances cell migration [36] . Using the 3C assay, we observed enhanced Smad3 binding to the ITGA5 promoter and the interaction of distant chromatin regions around the ranscription start site in H441 cells upon TTF-1 knockdown. Thus, ITGA5 might be another direct target of TGF-\u03b2, which is suppressed by TTF-1.

In H441 cells, knockdown of TTF-1 enhanced the expression of pro-apoptotic genes in the absence of TGF-\u03b2 stimulation as well as the induction of EMT-related genes upon TGF-\u03b2 stimulation. TTF-1 inhibits apoptosis of lung epithelial cells, and the TTF-1-Smad3 complex may modulate the expression of apoptosis-related genes. LMO3 is one of such genes regulated by the TTF-1-Smad3 complex, though Smad3 has a suppressive effect on its expression ( Figure 4B ).",

One of the reasons that ectopic TTF-1 failed to upregulate some of its target genes in A549 cells might be due to epigenetic changes. Based on a public database (GEO accession no. GSM999365), CpG methylation was present in the LMO3 locus in A549 cells (data not shown). Moreover, cell growth assay revealed that TTF-1 inhibits the proliferation of A549 cells (Supplementary information, Figure S7B ), suggesting that the function of TTF-1 in cell proliferation and apoptosis varies according to cellular contexts, although inhibitory effects of TTF-1 on the Smad3-Smad4 complex and EMT are maintained.",

We have shown here that TTF-1, a lung epithelial-specific transcription factor, co-occupies with Smad3 on chromatin, and that loss of TTF-1 function greatly alters the binding profiles of Smad3, especially in regions where TTF-1 does not bind to chromatin. These tissue-specific factors seem not only to enable Smad3 to bind to specific regions, but also to inhibit Smad3 binding to certain regions. These factors may bind to unphosphorylated Smad3, as well as to the Smad3-Smad4 complex.

EcoRI was used for digestion. qRT-PCR analysis was performed using Taqman gene expression master mix, and a LightCycler 480 (Roche, Switzerland) was used. All samples were run in quintuplicate and the results were averaged. Amplification data were quantified using the \u2206\u2206C t method (comparative threshold cycle method) and normalized using the human internal control attached to the kit. The sequences of the Taqman probe and primers for 3C assays are shown in Supplementary information, Data S1.",

(A) i: Pink and green circles represent Smad3-binding regions in H441 cells treated with TGF-\u03b2 for 1.5 h with control and TTF-1 siRNA, respectively (FDR = 0.01). ii: Blue circle represents Smad4-binding regions in siTTF1-transfected H441 cells treated with TGF-\u03b2 (FDR = 0.1). (B) Yellow circle represents TTF-1-binding regions in H441 cells without TGF-\u03b2 stimulation. Orange (i) and green (ii) circles represent Smad3-binding regions in siControl-and siTTF-1-transfected H441 cells treated with TGF-\u03b2, respectively, and the blue circle (iii) represents the Smad4-binding regions as shown in A-ii. (C) The frequency of TTF-1-binding at the Smad3-binding sites. Smad3-binding strength at each binding region was defined as read counts normalized by total mapped reads of the dataset (14 145 Smad3-binding peaks determined in H441 cells transfected with siTTF-1). The read count ratio of each binding region was obtained by calculating the normalized read counts of siControl/siTTF-1. The frequency of Smad3-binding sites common to TTF-1 was calculated in two groups: the top 2 000 and bottom 2 011 regions with high and low siControl/siTTF-1 ratios, respectively. (D) TTF-1-, Smad3-and Smad4-binding regions in the PAI-1 gene locus. Peaks a-e indicate Smad3-only regions; peaks f and g indicate Smad3-TTF-1 common regions. (E) ChIP-reChIP analysis of Smad3-Smad4 co-binding to DNA in H441 cells. Cells were stimulated with TGF-\u03b2 for 1.5 h and fixed. Samples were eluted after anti-Smad3 ChIP, followed by secondary ChIP as indicated (IgG or anti-Smad4). Primers specific for the Smad3-binding region (peak e inFigure 2D) were used for evaluation by real-time PCR. (F) Read counts of Smad3-binding strength in the Smad3-TTF-1 common binding regions (upper panel) and the Smad3-only binding regions (lower panel) were obtained, and comparison was made in each region in TGF-\u03b2-treated H441 cells transfected with siControl and siTTF-1. Red dots (a-e) and green dots (f and g) indicate the binding regions shown in D. (G) Read counts in all Smad3-binding regions were obtained from the Smad3-ChIP-seq and Smad4-ChIP-seq data of TGF-\u03b2-treated H441 cells transfected with siControl (upper panel) or siTTF-1 (lower panel), and read counts of Smad3 and Smad4 were compared in each region. (H) Binding strengths of TTF-1 were determined as normalized read counts of TTF-1 and compared with the relative read counts' ratios of Smad4/Smad3 in the Smad3-binding sites in H441 cells transfected with siControl (upper panel) or siTTF-1 (lower panel).

(A) Comparison of the microarray data of genes induced by TGF-\u03b2 in H441 cells and ChIP-seq data of Smad3. Left column: data from the expression array. Genes expressed in H441 cells and induced by TGF-\u03b2 stimulation are selected and arranged with respect to siTTF-1/siControl ratios (changes in gene expression levels between siTTF-1 and siControl cells). Right column: Smad3 ChIP-seq data. Black bars indicate Smad3 binding with two-fold upregulation by siTTF-1. (B) Gene ontology analysis of the expression microarray data of H441 cells transfected with siControl or siTTF-1. Effect of the knockdown of TTF-1 on TGF-\u03b2-induced changes in gene expression was evaluated by comparing the enriched gene ontology clusters (left vs right) obtained by DAVID. (C) Gene ontology analysis of the function of TTF-1 in the absence of TGF-\u03b2 stimulation. Acquisition of gene ontology clusters was performed as in B. (D) The 3C assay. Left: if a Smad complex binds to multiple sites in the promoter and assembles different regions after DNA digestion, interaction between multiple binding sites can be detected. Right: if a Smad complex binds to a single site in the promoter and fails to assemble different regions after DNA digestion, interaction between multiple binding sites cannot be observed. (E) Left panels: designed 3C Taqman probes (blue triangles) and primers (orange triangles) in the PAI-1 and ITGA5 loci. We designed four primers (including one with the opposite direction). The scheme of the PAI-1 promoter (upper left) is a modification ofFigure 2D. Right panels: interaction ratios were normalized by input values. Rev1-Rev4 indicate the reverse primers shown in the left panels. Error bars = SD.",
