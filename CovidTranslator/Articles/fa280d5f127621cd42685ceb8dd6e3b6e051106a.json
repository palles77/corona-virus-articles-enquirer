Traditionally, public health was viewed as a realm of almost exclusive national jurisdiction and multilateral cooperation in this realm was restricted to discrete areas. Public health law today remains predominantly domestic and national, but the field of international public health law is extant and growing. Through the codification of binding global health law standards that regulate interstate behavior and national conduct as well as the creation of other global norms that influence state actions, international public health law has expanding significance in national public health law and policy.",

For example, the Conseil superieur de sant\u00e9 (Superior Council of Health) of Constantinople, composed of delegates of the Ottoman Empire and the chief maritime states, was established in 1838 to supervise sanitary regulation of the Turkish ports to prevent the spread of cholera. As a further example, the international legal activities of the first permanent international health organization, L'Office International d'Hygiene Publique, were restricted to the administration of international sanitary conventions, including the international exchange of epidemiological information. International communicable disease control remained the predominant area of international legal cooperation throughout the mid-nineteenth century and most of the twentieth century.",

WHO Member States also paid little attention to the potential contribution of international law in advancing global health during most of the last century.

Of particular importance was a pioneering human rights approach to the global HIV/AIDS pandemic adopted by WHO in the late 1980s. It is widely recognized that this novel emphasis on the linkage between public health and human rights law had a groundbreaking impact in that it compelled governments to be publicly accountable on an international stage for their actions against persons living with HIV/AIDS (Gruskin and Tarantola, 2002) . Ultimately, this innovative global political approach to public health issues publicly highlighted for the very first time the underlying legal responsibility of governments to protect and promote the health of their populations and has served as a forerunner for increasingly widespread links between human rights and other public health issues (Mann and Tarantola, 1998) .",

Of particular concern is the impact of international intellectual property protection under the World Trade Organization TRIPS Agreement, discussed in the section titled 'The World Trade Organization: 1994 Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Agreement and Access to Essential Medicines,' in restricting access to essential medicines, particularly HIV/AIDS antiretrovirals, in most developing countries. The unprecedented human catastrophe posed by HIV/ AIDS has led the international community to adopt a number of nonbinding resolutions at the United Nations General Assembly, the former United Nations Commission on Human Rights and the World Health Organization specifying the relationship between HIV/AIDS, human rights, and access to medicines. Most recently, in June 2006, the United Nations General Assembly adopted a Political Declaration on AIDS (UN Res. 60/262) reaffirming that access to medicines in the context of pandemics, including HIV/AIDS, is one of the fundamental elements to achieving full realization for everyone of the international right to health.",

In 1997, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) adopted a nonbinding instrument, the Universal Declaration on the Human Genome and Human Rights. In addition, in the wake of failed treaty negotiations, in 2005 the United Nations General Assembly adopted a declaration urging Member States to prohibit reproductive cloning as incompatible with human rights.

The evolution of the concept of human security provides another interesting example of this development. The traditional understanding of human security has come under increasing pressure in recent years, with growing support for a comprehensive approach to human security that addresses the wide-ranging factors that impact upon the vulnerability of people. In 2003, the UN Commission on Human Security released a report proposing a new security framework and recognizing the linkage between health and human security (United Nations Commission on Human Security, 2003). In addition, expanding global concern with weapons of mass destruction and terrorism has underscored the strong interconnection between public health and security.

Consequently, the elaboration of international law has focused on the establishment of consensual rules concerning the status of states and their fundamental rights and obligations as well as commitments.

In contrast to domestic political systems, there is generally no supranational authority within the international system to develop and enforce law against sovereign states. In the absence of a supranational authority, states establish the rules of international law. Article 38(1) of the Statute of the International Court of Justice is generally regarded as an authoritative list of the sources of international law ( Table 2) .",

The determination of whether or not a particular practice constitutes customary international law is a complex analysis that is more like an art than a science. But, generally, the determination requires near uniform state practice undertaken because of a sense of legal obligation. With some important exceptions, once a rule is recognized as part of customary international law, it is generally considered binding upon all states. For example, the Vienna Convention is accepted as declaratory of customary international law and binding for all states, including those that have not formally ratified it. Like treaty law, customary international law is said to emanate from the consent of states. States party to a treaty explicitly consent to be bound by codified rules, whereas with customary international law states implicitly agree to be bound to particular rules through consistent state practice.",

The concept of sovereignty looms large in the international system and states are generally loath to sacrifice their freedom of action through the development of binding international obligations. A related weakness stemming from the principle of sovereignty is the general lack of enforcement mechanisms in most contemporary economic and social agreements.

The scope of international law was only expanded in the twentieth century to include individuals and international organizations. However, the nature of global health and the major actors in health policy are changing in such a way that challenges this restricted approach to international legal cooperation. To begin with, in an era of globalization the exclusive focus on territorial statehood is irrelevant to global health policy. Non-states ranging from Taiwan to Palestine are excluded from a range of international agreements because of lack of statehood. In addition, the major actors in global health policy today, including foundations, most notably the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and a wide range of significant public-private partnerships, such as the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunizations and the Global Fund for AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, or civil society organizations, such as Medicines sans Frontiers, are also excluded from the international lawmaking process.

Regulations come into force automatically for all WHO Member States, except for those states that notify WHO's Director-General, the Organization's executive head, of any rejection or reservations. The drafters of the WHO Constitution severely circumscribed the scope of this simplified lawmaking process, however, by limiting the scope of the regulatory authority under Article 21 to traditional public health concerns ( Table 3 ). In the case of the new IHR, WHO Member States who do not opt out of the IHR pursuant to WHO's Constitution are legally required to update policy and law to comport with the provisions of the new instrument.",

Second, the WTO established a powerful dispute resolution procedure with a structured process, a prompt timetable, and the capacity to enforce rulings that is very rare in the international legal system. Pursuant to the WTO Dispute Settlement Understanding, a WTO Dispute Settlement Body is authorized to formally adjudicate trade disputes between members and can authorize the winning party to apply trade sanctions if the losing party does not modify the violating law or policy.

TRIPS is the most comprehensive agreement ever reached on intellectual property. Notably, TRIPS is one of the mandatory agreements that all WTO members, including developing countries, were required to ratify. Developing countries were given transition periods to bring their national intellectual property legislation in compliance with TRIPS. By 2005, all member states of the WTO, except for the poorest, were required to be TRIPS-compliant.",

A large part of the concern was settled in November 2001 in the Declaration on the TRIPS Agreement and Public Health, the so-called Doha Declaration, discussed above, in which WTO members reaffirmed the right of states to use TRIPS f lexibilities to protect public health and, in particular, promote universal access to essential medications.

In addition, the transition period for most developing countries to become TRIPS-compliant has recently come to an end.

The failure of the international community to secure an effective mechanism under TRIPS to ensure the production and export of essential medicines to meet the health needs of developing states as well as growing recognition of the link between access to medicines and human rights have led to proposals for a radical shift in the way in which pharmaceutical research and development is undertaken, including proposals for a new research and development treaty described above.

It is important to recognize that international law is not an appropriate policy instrument for all global health problems. Given the substantial limitations of international law and the international legislative process, careful consideration should be given to the selection of global health concerns and the construction of legal regimes in future international health lawmaking enterprises. Policy makers must give high priority to identifying if and how legal strategies can contribute to the agenda in international health cooperation, including, most importantly, the major challenges that plague many developing nations. At the same time, increased attention should be paid to the impact, both positive and negative, of existing international law on population health.
