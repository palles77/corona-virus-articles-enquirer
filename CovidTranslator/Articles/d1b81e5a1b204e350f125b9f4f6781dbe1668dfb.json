            "text": "Production of hepatitis C virus (HCV) core protein requires the cleavages of polyprotein by signal peptidase and signal peptide peptidase (SPP). Cleavage of signal peptide at the C-terminus of HCV core protein by SPP was characterized in this study. The spko mutant (mutate a.a. 189-193 from ASAYQ to PPFPF) is more efficient than the A/F mutant (mutate a.a 189 and 191 from A to F) in blocking the cleavage of signal peptide by signal peptidase. The cleavage efficiency of SPP is inversely proportional to the length of C-terminal extension of the signal peptide: the longer the extension, the less efficiency the cleavage is. Thus, reducing the length of C-terminal extension of signal peptide by signal peptidase cleavage could facilitate further cleavage by SPP. The recombinant core protein fused with signal peptide from the C-terminus of p7 protein, but not those from the C-termini of E1 and E2, could be cleaved by SPP. Therefore, the sequence of the signal peptide is important but not the sole determinant for its cleavage by SPP. Replacement of the HCV core protein E.R.-associated domain (a.a. 120-150) with the E.R.-associated domain (a.a.1-50) of SARS-CoV membrane protein results in the failure of cleavage of this recombinant protein by SPP, though this protein still is E.R.-associated. This result suggests that not only E.R.-association but also specific protein sequence is important for the HCV core protein signal peptide cleavage by SPP. Thus, our results suggest that both sequences of the signal peptide and the E.R.-associated domain are important for the signal peptide cleavage of HCV core protein by SPP.",

            "text": "Hepatitis C virus is a major cause of chronic hepatitis, liver cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. HCV belongs to the genus Hepacivirus in the family Flaviviridae. HCV genome is a single, positive-stranded RNA with a nucleotide length of about 9.6 kb, encoding a large polyprotein precursor of approximately 3,000 amino acids. This polyprotein precursor, processed co-and post-translationally into at least 10 different viral proteins by host and viral proteases, is arranged in the order of NH2-C(21Kd)-E1(31Kd)-E2(70Kd)-p7-NS2(23Kd)-NS3(70Kd)-NS4A(8Kd)-NS4B(27Kd)-NS5A(58Kd)-NS5B(68Kd)-COOH. C, E1, and E2 are structural proteins while NS2-NS5B are nonstructural proteins [1, 2] . The releases of C, E1, E2, p7 from the polyprotein are mediated by cellular signal peptidase located in the endoplasmic reticulum [2, 3] . The non-structural proteins (NS2, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, NS5B) are released from the polyprotein after cleavage by HCV NS2-3 and NS3/4A proteases [2] . It has been reported that an additional HCV protein (ARFP/F protein) can be produced at the N-terminal region of C gene fragment [4] .",

In addition to its structural property, HCV core protein has been demonstrated to regulate host cellular functions in cultured cells, e.g. gene transcription [5] , signal transduction [6] [7] [8] , and apoptosis [9, 10, 11] . Moreover, transgenic mice with HCV core protein developed liver steatosis and thereafter hepatocellular carcinoma [12, 13] . Thus, core protein is suggested to be involved in the pathogenesis of hepatitis C. HCV core protein is a 191-amino acid product released from the polyprotein by cleavage with cellular signal peptidase. This 191-amino acid core protein will be further processed by signal peptide peptidase (SPP) into the mature form of core protein with about 179 amino acids in size [14] . The cleavage by SPP promotes the release of core protein from ER membrane. Core protein is then free for subsequent trafficking to lipid droplets [15] . Furthermore, SPP was shown to promote the formation of HCV non-enveloped particles in yeast [16] and is required for HCV-like particle assembly in Semliki Forest virus replicon system [17] . Thus, SPP cleavage should play an important role in the HCV life cycle.",

The discrepancy between these two reports could be the different mutants used to block the cleavage by signal peptidase. To address this issue, the A/F and spko mutants of recombinant protein containing HCV core and E1 proteins were constructed separately and expressed in HuH7 cells (Fig.1) . As a control, expressing plasmid encoding wild type HCV 1-200 a.a. was transfetcted into HuH7 cells (lanes 2 and 3).

The effect of signal peptidase on SPP could be due to the reduction in length of the C-terminal extension of signal peptide after cleavage. To address this viewpoint, recombinant core spko mutants with various length of C-terminal extension were constructed and expressed separately (Fig. 2) . The expression level of different proteins was also quantified using software ''Quantity one'': Comparing with total intensity of processed and unprocessed proteins (as 100%), the intensity of core protein with 179 a.a. is 59.6% in HCV a.a. 1-200 with spko mutation construct (lane 6 and 7) , HCV a.a. 1-240 with spko mutation (lanes 8 and 9) , HCV a.a. 1-260 with spko mutation (lanes 10 and 11) , HCV a.a. 1-280 with spko mutation (lanes 12 and 13), SPP inhibitor (Z(LL) 2 -ketone) was treated in lanes 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13. After transfection, recombinant proteins were collected, subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis, followed by Western blotting assay using anti-core mAb. The arrow represents core protein with 179 a.a., straight represents core protein with 191 a.a., and bracket marks various unprocessed C-E1 proteins. The protein bands marked by dotted line may represent degraded products from precursor C-E1. 4), 43.4% in HCV a.a. 1-220 with spko mutation construct (lane 6), 21.2% in HCV a.a. 1-240 with spko mutation construct (lane 8), 12.4% in HCV a.a. 1-260 with spko mutation construct (lane 10), and 8.7% in HCV a.a. 1-280 with spko mutation construct (lane 12). Thus, the amount of core protein with 179 a.a. in length detected from these spko mutants is inversely proportional to the length of the C-terminal extension: the longer the Cterminal extension, the less SPP cleavage product was generated (Fig. 2) . Again, core protein with 191 a.a. in length could not be detected after addition of SPP inhibitors in these spko mutant constructs (lanes 5, 7, 9, 11, 13) .",

To determine whether the signal peptide sequence is the determinant to be a substrate for SPP, recombinant core proteins with its original signal peptide replaced with signal peptides at the C-termini of E1, E2, or p7 were constructed and expressed separately (Fig. 3) .

            "text": "It has been demonstrated that replacing Leu 139 , Val 140 , and Leu 144 of core protein with Ala inhibited its processing by SPP. Moreover, the mutated core protein was translocated into nucleus in spite of the presence of the unprocessed C-terminal signal-anchor sequence [21] . Why these hydrophobic residues are crucial for the processing of core protein by SPP is unknown. Previous studies have shown that core protein without the internal hydrophobic domain (a.a. 120-150) is localized in nucleus rather than in ER [21, 27] . One possibility is that these hydrophobic residues (Leu 139 , Val 140 , and Leu 144 ) help core protein anchor on ER and facilitate its processing by SPP which is located in the ER membrane. To test this viewpoint, truncated core proteins with this hydrophobic domain (a.a. 119-200) and without this domain (a.a. 151-200) were constructed with N-terminal Myc-tag and expressed separately (Fig. 5A) . Both of these truncated core proteins are ER-associated (center and bottom rows in Fig. 6 ) possibly due to lack of nuclear localization signal located at the N-terminus of core protein [28] . The signal peptide of truncated core protein without this hydrophobic domain was not processed by SPP (lanes 4 and 5 in Fig. 5A ) because only two proteins, representing unprocessed fusion protein (marked by arrowhead) and the processed fusion protein cleaved by signal peptidase (marked by straight line), were detected both in the absence (lane 4) and presence of SPP inhibitor (lane 5) with equal amount. On the other hand, when truncated core protein containing this hydrophobic domain was expressed, only unprocessed fusion protein (marked by arrowhead in lane 2 of Fig. 5A ) was detected in the absence of SPP inhibitor while two proteins representing unprocessed fusion protein (marked by arrowhead) and the protein cleaved by signal peptidase (marked by straight line) were detected in presence of SPP inhibitor (lane 3). The expected cleaved product of this truncated core protein by SPP (in lane 2) would be a little smaller than the protein cleaved by signal peptidase (marked by straight line in lane 3). The fact that it is not seen from the Western blotting (lane 2) suggesting that it is labile since the protein cleaved by signal peptidase (marked by straight line) could be detected in presence of SPP inhibitor (lane 3). The instability of this SPPcleaved product should not be through proteasome-degrading pathway since proteasome inhibitor MG-132 could not stabilize this protein (data not shown). The results that the truncated core protein without the internal hydrophobic domain can not be cleaved by SPP, suggesting that the sequence of this region but not ERretention contributes to the SPP processing at its C-terminal signal peptide. To strengthen this viewpoint, an ER-associated domain (a.a. 1-50) of SARS-CoV membrane protein (Hsieh and Lo, unpublished data) was constructed in front of the truncated core protein (a.a. 151-200) and expressed. Both unprocessed (marked by arrowhead) and signal peptidase processed (marked by straight line) fusion proteins were detected in equal amount, either in the absence (lane 2 in Fig. 5B ) or presence of SPP inhibitor (lane 3 in Fig. 5B) . Therefore, the signal peptide of this recombinant chimera core protein was not processed by SPP (Fig. 5B ) though it is ERassociated (top row in Fig. 6 ).",

However, no such principal modes of control seem to be valid for SPP [19] . Not all signal peptides are substrates for SPP. The chimera core protein with signal peptide from the C-terminus of p7 protein, but not those from the C-termini of E1 and E2, could be cleaved by signal peptide peptidase (Fig. 3) . Moreover, the signal peptide at the C-terminal of p7 in its native structure was not cleaved by SPP (Fig. 4) . Thus, the core protein sequence may facilitate the cleavage of some foreign signal peptides. These results suggest that the sequence of the signal peptide itself is an important but not the sole determinant for its cleavage by SPP. It has been demonstrated that helix-breaking residues within the transmembrane region of signal peptide are required for cleavage, and the flanking regions can affect the processing by SPP [20, 30] . A helixbreaking residue (Pro 804 ) in the signal peptide at the C-terminus of p7 may account for its cleavage by SPP when placed at the C-terminus of core protein.",

To determine whether ER retention or this protein sequence affects the cleavage of signal peptide by SPP, two truncated core proteins (a.a. 119-200 and a.a. 150-200) with or without this hydrophobic sequence were constructed and expressed. Only truncated core protein with this hydrophobic domain (a.a. 119-200) could be processed by SPP (Fig. 5A ) though both proteins are ERassociated (Fig. 6) . We also constructed a chimera core protein using the first 50 a.a. of SARS-CoV M protein to replace this hydrophobic domain. This chimera core protein could not be processed by SPP (Fig. 5B ) though it is ER-associated (Fig. 6) . Thus, these results suggest that not only E.R.-association but also the sequence of this hydrophobic domain is important for the HCV core protein signal peptide cleavage by SPP.",

In human, the signal peptides of polymorphic major histocompatibility complex class I molecules contain a highly conserved sequence that is capable of binding to HLA-E [31] . This peptide-HLA-E complex when exposed on the cell surface, will specifically interact with an inhibitory receptor on natural killer (NK) cells, thereby monitoring indirectly the level of class I molecule expression [32, 33] . The free signal peptide of core protein (i.e. a.a. 180-191) after cleavage by signal peptidase and SPP may have a similar role like that of HLA-E. Alternatively, this short peptide (a.a. 180-191) may bind to Ca 2+ /calmodulin and regulate the signal transduction pathway in the host cells, similar to the case of the hormone preprolactin (p-Prl) and the human immunodeficiency virus-1 gp160 [34] .",

Majority of the proteins detected in the A/ F and spko mutants were unprocessed ones (marked by bracket, lanes 4-7). Expression level of different proteins in the A/F and spko mutants was quantified using software ''Quantity one'': Comparing with total intensity of the processed and unprocessed proteins (as 100%), the intensity of core protein with 179 a.a. in A/F mutant is 12.9% (lane 4) while in spko mutant is 7.5% (lane 6).
