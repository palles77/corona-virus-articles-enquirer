The FTDRP assay correctly identified 26 diverse respiratory virus strains, 35 of 41 (85%) external quality assessment samples spiked with cultured virus and 232 of 263 (88%) archived respiratory specimens that tested positive for respiratory viruses by in-house assays. Of 308 prospectively tested respiratory specimens selected from children hospitalized with acute respiratory illness, 270 (87.7%) and 265 (86%) were positive by FTDRP and in-house assays for one or more viruses, respectively, with combined test results showing good concordance (K = 0.812, 95% CI = 0.786-0.838). Individual FTDRP assays for adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus and rhinovirus showed the lowest comparative sensitivities with in-house assays, with most discrepancies occurring with specimens containing low virus loads and failed to detect some rhinovirus strains, even when abundant. The FTDRP enterovirus and human bocavirus assays appeared to be more sensitive than the in-house assays with some specimens. With the exceptions noted above, most FTDRP assays performed comparably with in-house assays for most viruses while offering enhanced throughput and easy integration by laboratories using conventional real-time PCR instrumentation.",

Individual assays within each pool are distinguished by use of different probe fluorophores, with the exception of the EV and PeV assays, where both probes are ROX-labeled and therefore cannot be distinguished. Each kit also contains a positive plasmid control pool and detailed instructions on test performance. The FTDRP assay was performed following the manufacturer's recommendations. Briefly, 194 L of 2\u00d7 RT-PCR buffer was combined with 23.3 L of each primer/probe pool and 15.5 L of 25\u00d7 enzyme mix (AgPath-ID TM One-Step RT-PCR Kit, Applied Biosystems), and 15 L of each mixture was then added to 14 wells of a PCR plate (12 sample reactions plus one positive and one negative virus control). Ten L of sample TNA extract or controls were then added to the respective wells of each primer/probe pool. The following cycling conditions were performed on a 7500 Fast Dx Real-Time PCR Instrument (Applied Biosystems): 15 min at 50 \u2022 C, 10 min at 95 \u2022 C and 40 cycles of 8 s at 95 \u2022 C and 34 s at 60 \u2022 C. Threshold cycle (Ct) values were determined by manually adjusting the fluorescence baseline to fall within the exponential phase of the amplification curves and above any background signal. A positive test result was considered a well-defined curve that crossed the threshold cycle within 40 cycles. Positive and negative virus plasmid controls provided in the kit were included in all runs to monitor assay performance. The BMV internal control was spiked into clinical specimens to monitor sample extraction and reverse transcription. Previously extracted TNA samples were evaluated for RNase P only.",

The in-house EV and PeV assays as modified from previous reports (Kilpatrick et al., 2009; Nix et al., 2008) were performed on a MX3000P QPCR System using the SuperScript III Platinum \u00ae One-Step Quantitative RT-PCR System reagents (Invitrogen) with the following cycling conditions: 50 \u2022 C for 30 min, 95 \u2022 C for 5 min and 45 cycles of 95 \u2022 C for 15 s, 55 \u2022 C (EV) or 58 \u2022 C (PeV) for 45 s and 72 \u2022 C for 10 s. Universal Inf A and Inf B assays were performed on a 7500 Fast Dx Real-Time PCR Instrument with SDS software ver. 1.4 (Applied Biosystems) using the SuperScript III Platinum \u00ae One-Step Quantitative RT-PCR System with the following cycling conditions: 50 \u2022 C for 30 min, 95 \u2022 C for 2 min and 45 cycles of 95 \u2022 C for 15 s and 55 \u2022 C for 30 s (Stephen Lindstrom, CDC, personal communication). Following standard operating procedures, all in-house assays were performed in 25 L final reaction volumes containing 5 L of sample TNA extract. A positive test result was considered a welldefined curve that crossed the threshold cycle within 40 cycles. Positive and negative virus RNA transcript or whole virus extract controls were included in all runs to monitor assay performance.",

Some commercial assays in particular that have received FDA 510(k) clearance have made substantial inroads into the diagnostic laboratory (Rand et al., 2011) . However, these assays are often costly, require dedicated laboratory equipment, use highly multiplexed reactions where individual assay performance may be compromised, and can be difficult to modify quickly in response to the emergence of new medically important virus strains, as occurred during the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic.",

The FTDRP assay setup and runtime requires approximately 2.5 h for 12 samples and controls (assay reagents are aliquoted in 12 sample test units), excluding sample extraction, and with a kit list price of $27.34/sample (PCR enzyme kit costs not included). By combining assays into 5 multiplex reaction mixes, individual mixes could more easily modified if needed without impacting the other mixes and could allow for more efficient targeted testing based on epidemiologic findings.",

Overall, the FTDRP and in-house assays performed comparably for most viruses tested, particularly when the virus was abundant in the sample (low Ct values). With exceptions noted below, most discordant results were seen with samples containing lower concentrations of virus (high Ct values), suggesting that differences in assay sensitivity near their detection limits was responsible for these discrepancies rather than failure of primer/probe hybridization due to critical target sequence mismatches.",

The FTDRP RV assay showed clear evidence of dropouts with some RV strains (see further discussion below), and some prospectively tested specimens were negative for RSV and AdV, even when the viruses were abundant. It is notable that these three FTDRP assays are combined in the same reaction mix and these three viruses showed the highest co-detection rates by singleplex in-house in these specimens. It is possible that competing amplification reactions in some specimens containing multiple virus targets may have reduced the sensitivity of some assays for low abundant targets. This may have had a more noticeable impact on detection of AdV, where a disproportionate number of AdV positive specimens had lower virus loads. This would be expected in a population comprised of infants and young children where persistent low level AdV shedding is common.",

These data confirmed previous experience with the in-house EV and RV assays: both assays cross-react with some RV and EV strains, particularly if present in high copy number (Lu et al., 2008; Oberste et al., 2010) . Although this complicated efforts to evaluate the FTDRP EV/PeV and RV assays, several conclusions can be drawn from these findings. The FTDRP EV/PeV assay appeared to be more sensitive and specific than the in-house assay for detection of some EV strains, including the recently emergent EV68 (CDC, 2011), although cross-reactions with some RV strains identified in the archived sample collection could not be ruled out. Of particular concern, the FTDRP RV assay was insensitive with some sequence confirmed RV species B and C strains. This finding suggests that critical primer/probe mismatches with these viruses substantially diminished target amplification and/or probe hybridization. More extensive testing of culture purified RV and EV strains will be necessary to assess the full extent of this deficiency.",
