Studies of the evolution of phages and their role in natural ecosystems are flourishing. Practical questions, such as how to use phages to combat human diseases that are caused by bacteria, how to eradicate phage pests in the food industry and what role they have in the causation of human diseases, are receiving increased attention.

That science, once dubbed 'modern' as distinct from 'classical' biology, has long since been assimilated into the textbooks. However, recent research indicates that the historical contributions that phage studies have made to molecular biology might be overshadowed by their future influence on biology in general, and on genetics in particular.

Among the more marked examples of molecular chimerism is phage N15. Whereas most of its phage genes are related to, and in the same order as, the genes of a lambdoid phage, its prophage form persists as a linear plasmid that includes sequences that are related to the F plasmid of Escherichia coli as well as to coliphages P1 and P4 (REF. 6 ).",

This pool includes groups, such as the lambdoid phages, in which mixing is even more frequent. However, some gene blocks that are found in lambdoid phages might have resided elsewhere for much of their history, and have diverged over long periods during which they were not subject to frequent recombination with other lambdoid phages. It should be noted that molecular clock estimates indicate that some allelic variants of \u03bb-genes diverged long before the existence of E. coli, which is the host of \u03bb, perhaps even as long ago as the branching of bacteria from archaea and eukaryotes 4,7 . There are many reasons to question the accuracy of dating by molecular clocks 8 . However, the antiquity of viral genes is also indicated by an independent line of evidence 9 . There are marked examples (such as adenoviruses and reoviruses) in which the morphology of the viral capsid is similar in a group that includes animal viruses, plant viruses and bacteriophages. These similarities extend from the shapes of individual proteins to the overall morphology of the virus particle (composed of several protein species) and seem unlikely to represent evolutionary convergence. This indicates a common ancestry for reoviruses and phage \u03c66, for example, although the RNA and protein sequences show no significant similarities and, therefore, must have diverged anciently, perhaps before the separation of the main domains of the living world. Hendrix 4 offered the most comprehensive interpretation of these results. If different closely related phages, such as lambdoids, encounter one another in nature, they can recombine. The frequency of recombination depends on the degree of similarity of the two partners at the recombination points. So, between any two phages, shared segments of HOMOLOGY can serve as recombinational linkers, and even identities of oligonucleotide length can create preferred exchange points. None of this is new. However, breakage and joining sometimes occur even if there is no homology -which represents new ground -and over evolutionary time this happens often enough to generate the sharp boundaries between homology and non-homology that are observed in phages. Most such new junctions should be lethal or deleterious, but specificities for properties such as integration, repression and host range. These studies also showed that any two lambdoid phages are similar in some segments of their genomes and dissimilar in others, with abrupt transitions from similarity to dissimilarity 3 .",

Sequencing also verifies the sharpness of most boundaries between segments of close similarity and those of extreme dissimilarity. At the base of the natural food chain are the photosynthetic microbes: green algae and cyanobacteria. For both of these groups, a substantial fraction of their biomass is liberated as dissolved organic material by viral infection.

The cI gene, which encodes the repressor, is transcribed leftward from oR, whereas the secondary repressor Cro and other gene products come from the rightward message. Both repressor and Cro can bind to three sites in oR and shut-off transcription in both directions. However, one or the other will eventually get the upper hand. If repressor synthesis is established, Cro synthesis is shut off, and vice versa. The system, therefore, provides an elegant model for how switching events might be controlled in other contexts, such as in cell differentiation in multicellular eukaryotes 28, 34 .",

The shut-off of repressor synthesis by Cro depends on Cro binding to the oR3 operator site, which could be the crucial step in activating the lytic cycle. In this view, the establishment of repression depends on a race between Cro and the repressor. However, it has been known from early on that another protein, CII, which acts at the promoter site pRE, is crucial in repressor establishment 35 and that Cro that is bound to the other oR sites (oR2 and oR1) decreases CII production. This makes it equally possible that the decisive race is between Cro and CII, with oR3 having, at most, an ancillary role.",

In a series of incisive experiments, Ptashne and colleagues defined the modus operandi of the lysis/lysogeny decision in phage as a model genetic switch that operates in the right operator sites (oR) 29 (FIG. 3) . This work has recently been extended by the discovery that the natural switch is strongly influenced by the simultaneous interaction of the repressor with the leftward operator (oL), which is more than 3-kb away [30] [31] [32] ; this was the free 5\u2032 ends then rotate to exchange partners, followed by ligation with removal of the integrase protein from the 3\u2032 ends to form a HOLLIDAY JUNCTION. The assemblage then undergoes a rearrangement (isomerization) and resolves the Holliday structure by cutting the two previously uncut strands on the other side of the junction, which allows the exchange of partners by the freed 5\u2032 ends, followed by resealing 23 . The reverse reaction (excision from the chromosome) requires a second phage-specified protein (excisionase) and proceeds by an analogous mechanism, which is, however, not a simple chemical reversal of the integration reaction 24 .",

Most early attempts at phage therapy were unsuccessful or inconclusive, apparently for trivial technical reasons such as the absence of placebo controls or the rapid clearance of injected phage from the bloodstream before it had time to reach its intended target 38, 39 . With the advent of antibiotics, the development and use of phage therapy almost disappeared from the Western world, although it continued in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe 39 . As the incidence of antibiotic resistance continues to rise, the field has been reactivated 38 . Phage therapy has some inherent advantages over antibiotics, in both the specificity and the ability of the agent to propagate in the desired location (advantages that were seldom realized in earlier work with impure phage preparations) 39 . As with antibiotics, the efficiency is limited by bacterial mutation, which will doubtless be a great challenge to future development. (FIG. 1) , the phage can either enter the lytic cyle -in which it reproduces and then lyses its host -or the lysogenic cycle -in which the phage DNA is incorporated into the host DNA and is replicated indefinitely. Dashed boxes enclose operator sites that comprise a promoter-control complex. The three operator sites O R1-3 of the '\u03bb-switch' control the promoters P RM and P R . Cro and CI dimers bind to the three sites with different affinities and in the opposite order to control the activation of the P RM and P R promoters 29 . If protein N is available, transcribing RNA polymerases (RNAPs) can be ANTI-TERMINATED at the NUT R and NUT L sites; the termination sites T R1 and T L1 are inoperative for anti-terminated RNAPs. The CI dimer acts as either a repressor or activator of the promoter P RM , depending on its concentration. P1 and P2 are proteases that degrade the CII phage protein. CIII is a phage gene product that is also a substrate for P1. By binding to P1, CIII inhibits the degradation of CII. b | \u03bb-decision-circuit DNA organization. Phage-encoded genetic elements of the decision circuit are located in a 5,000-nucleotide region of the phage DNA. Genes are separated into leftward and rightward transcribed strands as indicated by the arrows. Rightward extensions of the anti-terminated P R transcript transcribe the O and P genes that are essential for phage genome replication, and the Q gene that controls the transcription of later genes on the lytic pathway. Leftward extension of the anti-terminated P L transcript transcribes xis and int genes, which are essential for phage-chromosome integration and excision both into and out of the host chromosome. The locations of four termination sites are indicated by T R1-2 and T L1-2 . Figure modified with permission from REF. 33 .",

The latter possibility is more likely if the toxin gene is not at a terminus of the prophage, but rather in the middle, as in the \u03bb-related coliphage 933W, which encodes a Shiga-like toxin 55 . The evolution of bacterial pathogenicity can only be understood by including the role of phages and pathogenicity islands. Prophages and pathogenicity islands seem to be closely related; however, assumptions about the nature of the relationship might be premature. Pathogenicity islands belong to a broader category of DNA known as specialization islands. Specialization islands are blocks of contiguous genes that are distinguished by several criteria. First, they are dedicated to a common function, such as pathogenicity, which is not directly needed for simple survival. Second, they differ from the surrounding DNA in molecular statistics such as the G+C content, codon usage and neighbour relations. Third, they are present in certain strains of a bacterial species and absent from others. Their widespread occurrence has only come to light through whole genome sequencing, and their molecular statistics indicate that such elements have been derived in the relatively recent past from other bacterial species, to which they might be indigenous 56 . Their intercalation in only certain strains of the species in which they are now observed indicates the operation of an insertion mechanism, such as phage integration or TRANSPOSITION; also, some islands are flanked by phage-insertion sites, which technically qualifies the whole unit, whatever its historical origin, as a defective prophage 57, 58 .",

Even from the vantage point of wholegenome sequencing, the prevalence of lysogeny might be underestimated because the identification of prophages requires homology to known phages. It has also long been known that complete prophages, which are able to generate plaque-forming particles, frequently deteriorate into incomplete (defective) prophages by changes that range from point mutations to extensive deletions and/or insertions. A particular type of defective phage -specialized transducing phages -can result from faulty excision from the chromosome, which replaces some phage DNA by host DNA adjacent to the insertion site 54 . This is one mechanism whereby phages might have acquired toxin genes. Another is Recent examples include fusions of domains of surface antigens of the human pathogen Neisseria meningitidis onto the surface protein of phage T4, for possible use in vaccine construction, and fusions of random five amino-acid sequences to identify possible binding partners for a nuclease that cuts T4 DNA for packaging 48, 49 .",

The phage particle encounters and attaches to the cell surface by the tip of its tail and phage DNA enters, which leaves an empty protein shell attached to the outside of the cell. Next, the ends of the linear DNA molecule join to form a circle. The point of closure is called the cohesive site (cos). In some infected cells, the DNA is transcribed, translated and replicated. There are two pathways of replication: \u03b8-form and rolling circle. Rolling-circle replication generates multigenomic tails of linear double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) from which DNA is drawn into preformed protein shells; tails are added and the cell lyses to liberate a crop of phage progeny. In other infected cells, phage development is repressed and phage DNA integrates into the bacterial chromosome. The resulting lysogenic cell can replicate indefinitely, but can be induced to return to the lytic cycle with the excision of phage DNA from the chromosome.",
