The 5' cap structure is important for protecting the RNA against exonuclease degradation 8 and for promoting translation initiation 9 of the mRNA. Therefore, RNA capping is an essential step for transfection experiments. The co-transcriptional (cap analog) method yields approximately 40 \u03bcg RNA that is 80% capped. The protocol utilizing Vaccinia capping enzyme caps up to 10 \u03bcg RNA (100 nt or larger) per reaction with nearly 100% efficiency. Figure 4 depicts the difference in luciferase expression between cultures transfected with capped and uncapped RNA samples. It can be clearly seen that cell cultures transfected with capped RNA show much higher expression of luciferase as compared to those transfected with uncapped RNA (which show no luciferase activity). In addition, Figure 4 also validates that both capping techniques, using cap analog and using the Vaccinia capping enzyme, successfully produce functional, capped RNA transcripts that can be translated into protein. The two tailed p-value obtained from the t-test was 0.2583 which indicates that there is no significant statistical difference between the luminescence data from the two capping methods. * Luminescence from untransfected cells was subtracted from GLuc and CLuc values before normalization.",

We have shown that both methods synthesize capped RNA that is functionally active post-transfection. The 5' cap structure improves stability of the RNA and translation efficiency, and hence is important for microinjection 11 and transfection 7 experiments. The co-transcriptional capping method generates 40-50 \u03bcg of~80% capped RNA. It is important to note that using 3'-0-Me-m 7 G(5')ppp(5')G RNA cap analog (ARCA), which is blocked at the 3'-hydroxyl of the m 7 G ensures incorporation of the cap in the correct orientation 17 . To cap larger quantities of RNA it is possible to scale up the standard reactions for both capping methods. However, using the Vaccinia Capping System would be a more feasible option cost-wise since co-transcriptional capping utilizes cap analog, which is a relatively expensive component. The Vaccinia Capping System is also a better method since it has capping efficiency of almost 100%.",

Also, they generate high bioluminescent signal intensity, and the activity assays are highly sensitive and easy to perform. It is important to note that the GLuc expression in the cells can be influenced by various factors other than the functionality of the RNA itself. Some examples are pipetting errors, varying cell numbers per well, transfection efficiency etc. Data normalization is used to account for these factors. In our protocol, we co-transfect CLuc RNA as an internal control with the GLuc RNA. When GLuc luminescence is divided by the CLuc control values, it gets normalized for the errors and variability in transfection 19 .",
