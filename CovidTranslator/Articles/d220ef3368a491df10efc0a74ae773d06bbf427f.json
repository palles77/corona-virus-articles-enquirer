Type I (allergic) diseases are associated with the IgE system, which is one of the primary defenses against parasite attacks. Type II (auto-and allo-antibody reactions) involve the formation of antibodies that react against self-antigens. Type III reactions involve the deposition and clearance of immune complexes, which are essential features of normal immune responses. Type IV diseases involve cellular immunity, which is the most important immune defense against pathogens or pathogenic states involving cells. Type V diseases involve excessive production of immunoglobulins or parts of immunoglobulins, while Type VI diseases occur when something impedes normal immune defense mechanisms, either innate or adaptive.",

About 60% of dogs are now purebred, and purebreeding always involves inbreeding. Because of the great diversity of immune mechanisms, and hence the genetic complexity of its development and regulation, it is understandable how inbreeding can result in a spectrum of disorders ranging from dysregulation of the immune system and autoimmunity at one extreme to cancers at the other. Although it may be oversimplistic, the susceptibility to autoimmune diseases is thought to be controlled by the interplay of environmental and heritable factors; the latter involving genes of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) (Campbell and Milner, 1993) .",

Immediate-type hypersensitivity reactions are mediated mainly by IgE, and to a lesser extent IgG, antibodies. IgA and IgM antibodies are only occasionally involved. Antibodies that participate in this reaction have the ability to sensitize cells, in particular mast cells and basophils. Sensitization is a process whereby specific cytotropic antibodies bind to the cell membrane. The binding of the corresponding antigen to these membrane bound antibody molecules triggers the allergic reaction. The cytotropic antibody system plays an important role in normal immune responses, particularly against parasites. It is somewhat analogous to the secretory (IgA, IgM) antibody system. It is localized to areas of the body where parasites are most apt to gain access or traverse, i.e., in the skin, mucous membranes of the GI and respiratory tracts, in the bloodstream, and around blood vessels in the porto-mesenteric system. The beneficial nature of this response is important to keep in mind; many people believe that cytotropic antibodies and immediate-type hypersensitivity reactions are only of nuisance value.",

Allergens are highly polar substances containing many sulfhydryl groups and will sensitize in nanogram to microgram amounts. Besides their size and chemical makeup, allergens that elicit IgE responses are often taken up by the host at low dosage and across some mucosal surface (Marsh and Norman, 1988) . Allergens can be parts of parasites, such as house dust mites or cockroaches. Conditions which allow an excessive build-up of these insects in the environment will also increase the exposure level to their allergens. Many allergens resemble proteinaceous substances on the cuticle of parasites (e.g., pollen, mold spores, dander). Drugs, cosmetics, and substances in cigarette smoke may also act as allergens.",

Mast cells and basophils possess cytoplasmic granules that contain potent inflammatory mediators and anticoagulants, such as heparin, histamine, serotonin, kinin protease, and slow reacting substance of anaphylaxis (SRS-A). They also contain substances that have reparative functions such as chymase, hyaluronic acid and platelet aggregating factor, as well as eosinophil and neutrophil chemotactic factors. SRA-A is not a single compound, but a mixture of spasmogenic and vasodilatory metabolites of arachidonic acid called leukotrienes. SRA-A is also not a sole product of mast cells, but a contribution from both mast cells and other activated tissue mononuclear cells.

Genetically predisposed dogs developed higher levels of specific IgE when exposed to pollen extracts several days following canine distemper immunization (Frick and Brooks, 1983) . Enhanced production of cytotropic antibodies to non-parasite antigens may also result from disuse of normal IgE mediated immunity. Heavily parasitized people may have less problems with nuisance type allergies (Buckley et al., 1985) , indicating that an IgE immune system engaged in normal parasite defenses is less likely to react to peripheral or related antigens.",

This is easily done when drugs are the offenders, because alternative products are usually available that are not allergenic. However, vaccines, which are the most common cause of such reactions, are more problematic for veterinarians. Many veterinarians believe that booster vaccinations are absolutely essential and are unwilling to forego their use even when they have previously evoked an allergic reaction. If systemic allergic reactions to vaccination are life-threatening (i.e., anaphylactic shock), the risk of subsequent immunizations will far out-weigh the negligible benefits provided by booster vaccinations. The chances of an older and well-vaccinated dog getting potentially fatal infections like canine distemper, infectious canine hepatitis, parvovirus enteritis, leptospirosis or rabies are extremely low, and the other vaccinatable diseases, such as kennel cough, parinfluenza, Lyme borreliosis, and coronavirus enteritis are of limited clinical relevance in the general dog population. Even concern about the legal requirement for rabies boosters should not override common sense; a waiver can usually be obtained for rabies vaccinations when the use of such vaccine is life threatening. If systemic allergic reactions to vaccines are severe, but not life threatening (hives, angioneurotic edema), pretreat the animal 1 h before immunization with antihistamine and prednisolone. Give 1/10th the vaccine dose; if no adverse reaction is seen in 10\u00b1 20 min, administer the remainder. Changing brands or types of vaccine will seldom prevent the problem, because most vaccines contain similar offending allergens.

Following allergic stimulation of the tracheal and bronchial mucosa, the mucosal cells secrete a thick and tenacious type of mucus.

Assays detecting allergen specific IgE in serum are increasingly being used to diagnose allergens in dogs. Treatment should be directed whenever possible to avoiding offending allergens.

It has been said that autoantigens are not so abundant that they induce clonal deletion or anergy, but not so rare as to escape recognition entirely (Janeway and Travers, 1996) . Corato et al. (1997) concluded that normal dogs had auto-erythrocyte reactive lymphocytes, but that these lymphocytes must be primed in individuals with AIHA or a heritable susceptibility to the disease. Therefore, the capacity to generate selfreactive immunity appears to be suppressed by the normal immune system. The T-cell system is particularly involved in down-regulating autoantibody production by B-cells, and when antibodies against a particular self-antigen are generated, some aspect of T-cell regulation must have failed. Normal T-cell regulatory function can be influenced by a number of conditions, including microbial (especially viral) infections, vaccines (McAnulty and Rudd, 1985) , diseases of the lymphoreticular system such as lymphosarcoma, certain drugs, genetic weaknesses resulting in instabilities in self/nonself-recognition, and unrecognized factors.",

Indeed, many body proteins are antigenic but are not recognized as such because they are sequestered from the host's immune system (Streilein, 1993) . There is also evidence that natural autoantibodies exist to deeply sequestered red cell membrane proteins (e.g., spectrin) in dogs (Barker and Elson, 1993; Barker et al., 1991) , and that these antibodies may help in the destruction of aged and worn red cells. Thyroglobulin is immunogenic if it is injected into other areas of the body, and anti-thyroglobulin antibodies are often secondarily associated with primary destructive diseases of the thyroid gland in dog and humans. Following myocardial infarction or hepatic necrosis in humans, antibodies to cardiac muscle, microsomes, and other cellular constituents appear transiently in the serum. Anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA) often appear in the serum of dogs with aural hematomas, and these antibodies probably result form the extravasation and destruction of blood cells (and thus release of sequestered nuclear antigens) into the ear tissues. In these examples, the autoantibodies may be markers of disease (as in hypothyroidism in dogs) and of no clinical significance. The autoantibodies cannot react with antigens that are sequestered deep within the cells. In other cases, however, autoantibodies that are generated in this manner may actually have a pathogenic effect. Brucella canis infection often localizes in the testicles of dogs and can induce an autoantibody reaction to sperm and infertility (George and Carmichael, 1984; Serikawa et al., 1984) .",

About three-fourths of dogs were Coomb's antibody positive (usually IgG without complement); sphereocytosis was observed in two-thirds, hemoglobinemia and hemoglobinuria in 10%; one-third had moderate to severe reticulocytosis, <30% had mild reticulocytosis, and over one-third had a non-responsive anemia at the time of diagnosis.

Some event, perhaps a subclinical viral or bacterial infection, triggers the rapid development of a high-titered, broadly reactive, hemagglutinin. A similar non-immune type of peracute hemolytic anemia has been observed rarely in dogs and commonly in cats with overwhelming gramnegative bacterial sepsis. The serum hemagglutinin in peracute IHA often reacts against red cells from virtually any canine donor and commonly crosses species lines to agglutinate human, cow, cat, goat, sheep and horse cells.

The production of in-saline agglutinins should be halted with immediate glucocorticoid and cyclophosphamide therapy. Incompatible transfusions should be avoided if at all possible. If it becomes necessary to transfuse, utilize the least incompatible blood, make sure that the dog is fully heparinized prior to transfusion, and give the blood slowly over several hours. If any untoward transfusion signs are noticed, i.e., hemoglobinemia, hemoglobinuria, facial edema, or cardiac problems, immediately discontinue the transfusion. Giving incompatible blood to a non-heparinized dog is counter-indicated because it will greatly enhance the DIC, thromboembolic phenomena, and the microangiopathic red cell destruction. Dogs can tolerate PCVs of 10 or so, providing they are resting comfortably and their hearts are functioning normally. Gradual improvement will occur beginning 48\u00b196 h after treatment is started. This will be first manifested by an improvement in the outward demeanor of the animal and a stabilization of the PCV. The PCV will then rise slowly to levels of 15\u00b120 over the next week or so, the platelet count will return to normal, and autoagglutination will subside.

Recovered dogs do not usually have recurrent bouts of the disease. Unlike other forms of AIHA, the prognosis of peracute disease has to be considered poor. If not treated aggressively, almost all animals will die. A 50% or more mortality is associated even with optimal treatment. Whether the prognosis is grave or poor is somewhat dependent on the following negative prognostic factors: (1) hemoglobinuria; (2) no compatible donors; and (3) severity of thromboembolic signs. Also, if the dog survives the first three days of optimal treatment, the prognosis becomes more favorable. Therapy takes several days to take effect, and the bone marrow in these animals usually has not had enough time to respond by the time the PCV reaches its lowest point (marrow takes a week or so to begin to respond to acute blood loss).",

The anemia develops over weeks or months and presenting clinical signs are lethargy, fatigue, and pallor. Unlike subacute IHA, the anemia is unresponsive, almost always Coomb's antibody negative, and systemic signs such as hepatosplenomegaly, lymphadenopathy and icterus are not apparent. This form of IHA is probably associated with autoantibodies that react with surface antigens present on red cells that are late in differentiation, but not yet released into the circulation. This explains the absence of Coomb's antibody positivity and spherocytosis. An indirect Coomb's test is sometimes positive when the animal's red cells are treated with bromelin, ficin or trypsin and then incubated with its serum. Such treatment may expose more deeply situated antigens not present on circulating mature red cells but that were arrayed on the surface at an earlier stage of differentiation. As expected, the bone marrow shows either a hyper-or normalresponsive erythroid series. Multiple incompatibilities are sometimes seen on cross-match even though the animal may never have been transfused before. Chronic IHA has to be differentiated from congenital red blood cell enzyme deficiencies (heritable spherocytosis) associated with erythrocyte phosphofructokinase (American Cocker spaniel; English Springer spaniel) and erythrocyte pyruvate kinase (Basenji) deficiencies (Giger and Noble, 1991; Giger et al., 1992) .",

Like the human disease, affected dogs usually manifest because of the anemia, and thrombocytopenia is detected during the clinical work-up, or vice versa. Many dogs with Evan's syndrome will also be leukopenic, suggesting a broad-based attack on the bone marrow. The various cytopenias may occur simultaneously, manifest variably during the same attack, or appear to one degree or another upon subsequent attacks. Care must be taken not to diagnose Evan's syndrome in dogs with immune-or non-immune-mediated blood loss and consumptive thrombocytopenias. For example, many dogs with peracute IHA will have an associated DIC and consumptive thrombocytopenia. The same is true for dogs with severe babesiosis or haemobartonellosis. Dogs with Evan's syndrome are less likely to respond to glucocorticoid therapy alone, and are more difficult to get into remission with combination immunosuppressive drug therapy, as is the case with the human disease (Matthew et al., 1997) . Relapses may occur at varying times after cessation of treatment. Glucocorticoid and cyclosporine therapy is indicated in difficult-to-treat cases in humans (Emilia et al., 1996; Rackoff and Manno, 1994) , and has proved useful in dogs.

When in doubt as to which donor to use, washed (plasma-free) RBCs from the bitch is an obvious choice because there is negligible chance that they will be destroyed by the puppy.",

In a study of 23 canine thymomas, 11 of the animals had megaesophagus, and myasthenia gravis was confirmed in seven of these 11 (Atwater et al., 1994) . Paradoxically, one dog developed clinical signs of myasthenia gravis after removal of the thymoma. None of the dogs had evidence of distant metastasis. Histologically, the predominant tumor types were differentiatedepithelial (9/23) and lymphocyte-rich (6/23). Shelton et al. (1997) studied 1154 dogs residing within the United States from 1991 to 1995 with acquired myasthenia gravis. Purebred dogs had a greater risk than mixedbreeds; dogs with the highest risk of acquired myasthenia gravis were Akitas, terrier group, Scottish Terriers, German Shorthaired Pointers, and Chihuahuas. Rottweilers, Doberman Pinschers, Dalmatians, and Jack Russell Terriers had low relative risks. Sexually intact males and dogs less than one year old had some protection from risk.",

Two dogs with thymomas, megaesophagus, and third degree heart blocks died of aspiration pneumonia within three months of surgical resection of their tumors (Hackett et al., 1995) .

Furthermore, SLE in people and animals sometimes occurs in the absence of detectable ANA (seronegative lupus). By definition, such individuals do not have SLE, because ANA is a diagnostic criteria. The disease syndrome in ANA negative individuals is otherwise indistinguishable. SLE has been called the prototypic immune complex disease; circulating immune complexes pass through endothelial cell junctions and are trapped in the underlying basement membranes. Complement is bound to the complexes, and this in turn can lead to the influx of polymorphonuclear cells and localized inflammation. This reaction is localized around blood vessels, hence vasculitis is one of the hallmarks of SLE. If the vascular reaction occurs in glomeruli, glomerulonephritis is the result. Vasculitis in synovial blood vessels results in synovitis; meningeal vessels-meningitis; retinal vesselsuveitis; serosal vessels-peritonitis or pleuritis; spinal cord vessels-transverse myelopathies; cardiac vessels-myocarditis; pericardial blood vessels-pancreatitis; GI tract-colic and ulcers, etc. Immune complexes in the skin are usually found around small dermal vessels and in the basal lamina. Deposition of immune complexes in the skin does not always cause lesions by itself, but is potentiated by exposure to solar radiation.

SLE is associated with a state of immunologic hyper responsiveness, mainly in the B-cell system.

Individuals with SLE also have a greater than normal propensity to make autoantibodies, especially to RBCs, platelets, and leukocyte antigens. Antibodies to coagulation proteins (circulating anticoagulants) develop in 10\u00b115% of humans with SLE and have been reported in a dog (Stone et al., 1994) . Anti-coagulants are against phospholipids and intrinsic clotting factors such as factor VIII. These antibodies can cause thrombotic or hemorrhagic complications in some people and dogs. Humans with SLE also frequently develop false positive serologic tests for syphilis. This is due to the development of cross-reacting antibodies to phospholipids that are present in many organs and on the syphilis spirochete. Some dogs with SLE will produce antibodies to heat shock proteins (Bell et al., 1995) . About 30% of the humans with SLE develop rheumatoid factors, as do a similar proportion of dogs with SLE (Chabanne et al., 1993) .

Polymyositis and polyneuritis may also occur in dogs; it is seldom seen by itself and usually accompanies polyarthritis (Krum, 1997) . Pleuritis is frequently seen radiographically in dogs with florid SLE, but is usually not clinically apparent. Skin lesions are uncommon accompanying features in dogs compared to humans. Macular erythematous, crusty, and sometimes ulcerative lesions. Usually on the face (bridge of nose, eyebrows, ears, margins of lips). Dermatitis, when seen, is often the predominant feature. Ulcerative (infarctive) lesions of the palate, tongue and digits can be an accompanying or primary feature of SLE in dogs. Neurologic signs are seen in 10\u00b150% of humans, but are uncommon in dogs. Transverse myelopathy is an uncommon sequelae of SLE in dogs and people. Leukopenia, a common sign of SLE in man, is uncommon in dogs. Glomerulonephritis, as a histologic or immunohistologic diagnosis, is common in dogs with SLE, but is much less likely to progress to renal failure than in people.",

            "text": "The diagnosis of SLE is based on signalment (breed predispositions, age), disease signs compatible with systemic vasculitis and/or autoimmune cytopenias, and ANA positivity. The fluorescent ANA (FANA) test is the standard screening test for all types of ANAs. The FANA is an indirect immunofluorescence assay where serial dilutions of patient serum are reacted with acetone fixed cell culture monolayers, usually human or mouse hepatoma cells, or with rat liver sections (McVey and Shuman, 1991; Thoren-Tolling and Ryden, 1991) . FANA titers in animals are usually low (1 : 16\u00b11 : 256) compared to man. Some normal animals will have ANA, so a positive ANA is diagnostic only when it occurs with appropriate clinical manifestations of SLE. The original lupus erythematosus (LE) cell procedure has many false positives and negatives in dogs and is seldom used. SLE in dogs is treated in a similar manner to SLE in people. The initial attacks of disease are usually the worst and must be treated the most vigorously. Initial treatment often consists of glucocorticoids alone, although combination immunosuppressive therapy is ultimately required in many affected dogs. Once the disease is brought into remission, it can be kept that way with a minimum of drug therapy. About one-half of the animals may be withdrawn from therapy after six months to a year, while the remainder must be treated indefinitely. Glomerulonephritis, when present, is the most difficult part of the syndrome to treat and the disease manifestation that is most apt to be clinically silent until substantial organ damage has occurred. Therefore, renal function should be periodically monitored even through other signs of SLE appear under control. ANA will disappear when animals are in full remission and reappear upon relapse and is therefore a good monitor of disease control.",

The disease occurs most commonly in purebreds with long nose confirmation, but especially in Collies and Shetland sheepdogs. The disease is considered to be a focal form of SLE, with deposition of immune complexes in the basement membrane. Nuclear antigens have been extracted from the lesions of at least one dog with discoid lupus, suggesting that they help make up the immune complexes (White et al., 1992) . Disease of the basement membrane renders the skin more susceptible to the effects of solar radiation, which are focused most intensely on the nasal planum and on to the nose. The result is a low grade inflammation of the nasal planum with depigmentation. Constant licking of the lesions can lead to additional damage to the nose. Increased numbers of epidermal langerhan cells expressing MHC class II have been seen in dogs with discoid lupus, but not with pemphigus foliaceous (Day, 1996a, b, c) . Antinuclear antibodies are usually not found in the circulation, but have been observed on occasion (Iwasaki et al., 1995b) . Treatment is with immunosuppressive drugs, usually Glucocorticoids, sun screens, and avoidance of sunlight. A combination of tetracycline and niacinamide has also shown promise in dog with discoid lupus (White et al., 1992) .",

A nondeforming arthritis associated with chronic infectious disease has been described in dogs (Pedersen et al., 1976b; Bennett, 1986; van der Wel and Meyer, 1995) . This type of arthritis has been associated with subacute bacterial endocarditis; pyometra; discospondylitis; chronic Actinomyces infections in the chest, abdomen, or paravertebral musculature; chronic salmonellosis; heartworm disease; urinary tract infections and severe periodontitis. Since these infections are often difficult to pinpoint, the arthritis may be the main or sole presenting complaint. It is important, therefore, to make a thorough search for secondary infections every time a non-erosive type of arthritis is found. This is especially important because immunosuppressive drugs are contraindicated in animals with underlying infections.",

Since the organisms involved in the primary disease process cannot be identified in the synovial membrane, it is likely that the joint disease is also of immune complex origin. A similar relationship between a sterile arthritis and chronic infections in other parts of the body was recognized much earlier in man (Coggeshall et al., 1941) . 4.2.5.3. Non-deforming arthritis associated with other immune disorders 4.2.5.3.1. Systemic lupus erythematosus. A non-deforming polyarthritis is the most common presenting clinical feature of canine SLE. Like virtually all immune-mediated arthritides, care must be taken to exclude underlying causes of disease, e.g., infections, drugs, neoplasia. A non-erosive polyarthritis has been observed in subacute bacterial endocarditis (SBE) in man and dogs, and indeed the entire syndrome of SBE can mimic SLE. Two dogs described by Bennett (1986) best document this point. Chronic bacterial endocarditis can lead to continuous low-grade damage to parenchymal organs, high levels of circulating immune complexes, and a heightened responsiveness of the hosts immune system. In man and animals this may result in the production of numerous autoantibodies, including antinuclear antibody and rheumatoid factors. Antinuclear antibodies result from chronic nucleoprotein release and heightened immunologic responsiveness, and rheumatoid factors are made in response to persistent immune-complex production. This phenomenon is important, because if such animals are mistakenly diagnosed as having SLE or rheumatoid arthritis, they will be treated with immunosuppressive drugs, with potentially serious consequences. 4.2.5.3.2. Immune-mediated polyarthritis and meningitis. A pauci-or polyarticular arthritis can be an accompanying feature of immune-mediated meningitis, although signs referable to joint inflammation are almost always masked by the signs of the meningitis. The exception is in Akita puppies (Dougherty et al., 1991) ; both meningitis and polyarthritis are clinically apparent.",

Hepatopathic arthropathy, which has been seen in several dogs with chronic active hepatitis and cirrhosis, is also a type of enteropathic arthritis.

It leads to pronounced joint laxity and instability, often manifested by cruciate ligament damage and instability. The synovium is grossly thickened, edematous, reddish-yellowish tinged.

Joint fluids contain large numbers of non-degenerative neutrophils. The first sign of the allergic reaction tends to occur from 10 to 21 days after drug treatment is initiated for some other condition. This is the time period during which sensitization occurs. Alternatively, drug reactions may occur within hours of administering a drug that had been used safely in the past. Affected dogs become acutely febrile, stiff and sore, and develop a generalized rash. The rash can take several forms, but individual lesions on the skin are clearly of a vascular origin with hemorrhagic blistering, focal necrosis with hemorrhage, severe focal petechiation, etc. Additional features may include lymphadenopathy, polymyositis, anemia, glomerulonephritis, focal retinitis, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia. The diagnosis is readily apparent, providing the clinician is astute enough to connect drug treatment with the onset of an acute vasculitis syndrome involving primarily skin and joints. This linkage may be missed, especially if it is assumed that the condition at hand is merely an extension of the condition for which the treatment was prescribed. There is a rapid resolution of signs upon discontinuation of drug treatment, although whirlpool baths and glucocorticoids may be required to speed the healing of the skin lesions. 4.2.5.8. Treatment of immune-mediated arthritides. The first imperative is to determine whether or not the arthritis is associated with some significant underlying disease process. When inciting diseases are present, treatment should be concentrated on the underlying cause first and the immune arthritis second. The objective of therapy should be complete remission, which correlates with the disappearance of synovial fluid abnormalities and not just a return to some perception of`outward normalcy'. Allowing the joint disease to slowly simmer during inadequate treatment can lead to secondary DJD over a period of months or years.

There is some debate on whether dogs with GN should be treated conservatively with low protein diet and blood pressure control (Lulich et al., 1996) , or vigorously with the addition of immunosuppressive drugs. Conservative therapy is often favored because of the relatively high incidence (about 20%) of spontaneous remission (Biewenga and Gruys, 1986) , and to the poor response and side-effects of prolonged immunosuppressive drug therapy. Cyclosporine treatment was found to offer no improvement over non-treated animals in treatment of glomerulonephritis and was associated with a number of side-effects (Vaden et al., 1995) . There is no question that some dogs, especially younger animals with minimal glomerular changes and acute onset nephrotic syndrome, will self-cure after several months of conservative treatment (diet change with or without glucocorticoids). However, the disease in other dogs will not self-cure and vigorous treatment will slow the course of renal disease. Glucocorticoids alone are usually not effective, and combination therapy with glucocorticoids and cytotoxic drugs such as cyclophosphamide or azathioprine is required. Unfortunately, most dogs with glomerulonephritis present late in their disease course when treatment is minimally effective. The mean survival of one large group of dogs with glomerular disease (glomerulonephritis and renal amyloidosis) was 28 days (Cook and Cowgill, 1996) .",

Genetics may play an important role in idiopathic amyloidosis; it has been described in Chinese shar pei dogs (DiBartola et al., 1990; Dubuis et al., 1998; Loeven, 1994; Rivas et al., 1993) , Beagles (Bowles and Mosier, 1992) , and in English Foxhounds (Mason and Day, 1996) .",

Like glomerulonephritis, primary forms of renal amyloidosis present mainly with nephrotic syndrome while secondary forms are often associated with underlying or overlying disease syndromes. Of the various glomerulopathies in dogs, amyloidosis and membranous glomerulonephritis are the most likely to be associated with nephrotic syndrome, azotemia, hypercoagulation and thrombotic disorders (Biewenga and Gruys, 1986; Cook and Cowgill, 1996) . If secondary, and the primary cause can be corrected, some reversal of signs may occur. Several dogs with idiopathic renal amyloidosis have been treated with DMSO orally; the substance is taken into the blood and secreted in the kidneys. The objective is to dissolve amyloid deposits and to prevent further amyloid deposition (Spyridakis et al., 1986) . However, it is hard to get animals to ingest sufficient quantities and there is a heavy garlic odor. DMSO treatment is not always effective and appears to prolong survival rather than curing the disease. Overall, renal amyloidisis in dogs carries a poor prognosis with a mean survival time of less than one month (Cook and Cowgill, 1996) .",

Because a single NK cell can recognize a wide spectrum of abnormal cells, NK cell immunity is not antigen specific. Therefore, NK cell activity is considered to be an integral part of innate, rather than adaptive, immunity. Most in vitro assay procedures for NK cell activity involve killing of tumor cell targets. NK cells recognize foreign or altered cells during their wanderings through the body; the same cell being capable of recognizing a wide range of abnormal cells. NK cells touch membranes of abnormal cells and kill them by releasing specific lymphokines. NK cell-mediated killing can be enhanced by antibodies specific for abnormal surface antigens on malignant or antigenically altered cells, a process known as antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). This is an example of how a more primitive form of immunity can be upgraded by the subsequent evolution of antigen specific humoral immunity.

CD8 Tcells function to suppress B-cell activity and are called suppressor cells. These cells are also important as effectors of adaptive cell-mediated immunity. T-cells have evolved immunoglobulin-like receptors on their surfaces. Unlike NK cells, each T-cell possess receptors to a single antigenic epitope. Therefore, hundreds of thousands of antigen specific T-cell subpopulations exist in the body. B-cell (humoral) immunity first appeared in higher fish and is a natural evolutionary step from T-cell immunity.

Other cytokines induce a clonal expansion of a subpopulation of Tcells that bear the identical antigen receptor. Some of these proliferating T-cells become antigen-specific effector or killer cells. T-effector cells can recognize and kill the abnormal cells by bringing themselves into intimate contact and releasing cytotoxic lymphokines. Because macrophages are a favorite reservoir for microbial growth or ingest organisms as part of their phagocytic function, they are an important target for Tcell responses. T-effector cells can either kill infected macrophages directly, activate surrounding macrophages to assist in direct cell killing, or`instruct' the macrophage to activate itself and to destroy any microbes that it might contain.

Whether these antigens are of host origin, or to some yet unknown agent, is unknown. The dense mixed-inflammatory reaction is centered in the synovial membrane and the subchondral bone. Cartilage is undermined by subchondral inflammation and overlain by a pannus of granulation tissue emanating from points of synovial attachment. The net effect is a progressive destruction of cartilage starting at the joint margins; this ultimately leads to joint instability, subluxation, and luxation. The synovial membrane undergoes a characteristic villus hyperplasia with dense infiltrates of plasma cells and lymphocytes. Lymphocytes in the infiltrate, in the human disease, result from an almost clonal expansion of selected CD4 Tcells which are autoreactive and lack functionally important CD28 surface markers (Martens et al., 1997) . However, the role of these cells in the pathogenesis or etiology of human RA is unknown (Breedveld, 1998) . The inflammatory changes observed in RA appear to be cytokine produced by macrophage/monocytes and T-cells (Smolen et al., 1996) .",

Rheumatoid factors, i.e., autoantibodies against sterically altered (e.g., immune complexed) antibodies, are the hallmark of human rheumatoid arthritis; they are present at high titer in about three-fourths of affected people. Rheumatoid factors probably serve a function in cross-linking immune complexes and aiding in their clearance by phagocytes. They are detectable, therefore, in many diseases where chronic immune complexing is occurring. Although of definite value in the diagnosis of human rheumatoid arthritis, the value of rheumatoid factor tests in canine rheumatoid arthritis is less certain. Some veterinary researchers have been able to detect rheumatoid factors in a majority of affected dogs, but in only a small proportion of normal dogs and animals with other conditions Bennett and Kirkham, 1987) . In one study, however, rheumatoid factors were detected at comparatively low titer and in only about one quarter of the cases of canine rheumatoid arthritis (Pedersen et al., 1976b) . Recent studies have also confirmed that rheumatoid factors are present at only low titer and in only about one-fourth of dogs with rheumatoid arthritis; they are also present at similar titer and incidence in unclassified polyarthritis, heartworm disease, pyometra, leishmaniasis and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) (Chabanne et al., 1993; Nielsen, 1992) .

Neurologic disorders (Jaggy et al., 1994a, b; Jaggy and Oliver, 1994) and reproductive failure (Johnson, 1994) have also been associated with hypothyroidism in dogs. The diagnosis of thyroiditis and hypothyroidism should take into account clinical signs, breed predisposition, and evidence of decreased levels of triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4), increased levels of TSH, and the presence of antibodies to T3, T4 and thyoglobulin. Some clinical researchers feel that post-TSH stimulation levels of T4 are the single most diagnostic test (Jaggy and Oliver, 1994) . The presence of autoantibodies to T3 and T4 cause serum T3 and T4 concentrations to appear falsely high; however, free T4 is nondetectable when measured with a dialysis assay (Kemppainen et al., 1996) . Comparative studies of several tests demonstrated that both serum free T4 and TSH concentrations should be used in reaching a diagnosis; although free T4 tests were highly sensitive, greater specificity was obtained by combining the two assays . The TSH test, although very specific, lacks sensitivity; about one-fourth of hypothyroid dogs will have values in the normal reference range. Antibody assays for thyroglobulin have also been found to be very sensitive and specific in diagnosing dogs with lymphocytic thyroiditis, when compared to antibody tests for T3 and/or T4 (Nachreiner et al., 1998) .",

An immune-mediated lacrimal gland inflammation of a type IV nature occurs frequently in dogs, most often in purebreds and with some selectivity towards Cocker spaniels. The latter condition in dogs is sometimes referred to as Sjo \u00c8gren's syndrome, a human disorder associated with immune destruction of salivary glands and a rheumatoid-like arthritis. The application of this term to the canine condition is premature.",

Animals on chronic drug therapy, especially sulfas, for other conditions should have their medications discontinued; however, permanent damage may have already occurred. Frequent applications of artificial tears and topical antibiotics is usually required as long as tear production is inadequate. Opportunistic fungal infections must be considered in cases with infections that do not respond to antibiotics (Smedes et al., 1992) . In the case of immune-mediated disease, which is the most common cause of keratitis sicca in dogs, the treatment of choice is cyclosporine eye drops, which brings about rapid remission in a majority of cases. 5.2.5.7. Sebaceous adenitis. Sebaceous adenitis is a disease recognized predominantly in Akitas and Standard Poodles (White et al., 1995) . The disease is manifested by scaling, alopecia and secondary pyoderma. The target of the disorder are the sebaceous glands and the inflammation is mainly of the lymphocytic/plasmacytic type. Earlier reports of the disease describe the use isotretinoin or etretinate; about one-half of the dogs had a 50% or greater improvement (White et al., 1995) . The treatment of choice, however, appears to be leflunomide in combination with glucocorticoids. 5.2.5.8. Perianal adenitis and perianal fistulae. Inflammation of the circumanal apocrine sweat glands, leading to severe perianal fistulae, occurs predominantly in German Shepherd Dogs, and to a lesser degree, Irish Setters (Killingsworth et al., 1988) . The incidence is higher in males than females and is greater in intact as compared to neutered animals. The perianal abnormalities have been associated with histological evidence of colitis as well (Harkin et al., 1996) . Perianal lesions vary greatly, even in the same dog, in degrees of fibrosis, severity of inflammatory response and depth of sinus tracts (Killingsworth et al., 1988) . Lesions tend to be in the zona cutanea, and hidradenitis with formation of epithelial-lined sinus tracts is apparent in over one-half of the biopsies examined. In another study dealing with anatomic predisposition, the only predisposing cause between German shepherds and other non-affected breeds was in the greater number of apocrine sweat glands in the zona cuneata (Budsberg et al., 1985) . Secondary bacterial infection, with a number of different bacteria, is inevitably present (Killingsworth et al., 1988) .",

The underlying immunologic basis appears to be a cell-mediated immune attack against melanotic tissues (Nakamura et al., 1996; Norose and Yano, 1996; Okada et al., 1996; Rao, 1997) , possibly through reaction to the MART-1/Melan-A (Sugita et al., 1996) . A VKH-like syndrome has been described in Akita dogs (Reusch et al., 1994a, b; Teifke et al., 1998) and in Huskies, Malamutes, Samoyeds and Chows. Although the lesions of the canine disease bear a superficial resemblance to VKH of people, it remains to be proven that the syndrome in dogs is the same. The eyes are much less likely to be involved in dogs than the skin, while the opposite is true in man. CNS signs are also not seen in dogs with VKH-like disease, but this may be due to the absence of melanocytes in the meninges of dogs compared to people. To further confuse the issue, many of these same breeds may have skin disease that superficially resembles VKH, but on closer examination and testing, the lesions are actually caused by pemphigus foliaceous. Human VKH can be strongly linked to certain HLA-types (-DR1 and -DR4); the exact predisposing HLA types differing somewhat according to the race under study (Arellanes-Garcia et al., 1998; Goldberg et al., 1998; Islam et al., 1994; Shindo et al., 1994; Weisz et al., 1995) .

Dogs with this disorder respond well to combination therapy with glucocorticoids and leflunomide . The nature of the lesions and response to immunosuppressive drug therapy suggest that the disorder is due to a type IV autoimmune reaction. 5.2.7.2. Old dog encephalitis. Old dog encephalitis, or delayed-onset canine distemper virus (CDV) encephalitis, results from cellular immunity directed against virus that persists in the brain long after the initial immune stage of infection. The CDV can be of wild-or vaccine-type (Evans et al., 1991) , but is probably mutated in some manner (Shapsak et al., 1987; Tobler and Imagawa, 1984) . The condition is analogous to subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SPE) of humans, a disorder associated with the persistence of a genetically defective measles virus in the brain. It is not surprising that CDV and human measles virus are closely related members of the genus Morbillavirus. The lesions of old dog encephalitis are more glial proliferative, diffuse, and spare the cerebellum, while lesions of classic CDV encephalomyelitis tend to be focal, necrotizing, and more concentrated in the cerebellum, brain stem and spine (Vandevelde et al., 1980) . Old dog encephalitis is a slowly progressive encephalitis that occurs in adult, vaccinated dogs, and is a differential in other types of chronic encephalitides such as GME. Signs are usually significant, although a mild encephalitis with the predominant sign being a loss of smell has been reported in a Beagle (Simpson and Myers, 1987) . Dogs with delayed-onset CDV encephalitis, unlike animals with acute demyelinating CDV encephalomyelitis, have high levels of CDV antibodies in their cerebral spinal fluid, indicating an active local immune response (Johnson et al., 1988 ). These antibodies have been shown to be directed solely to the M protein of CDV in 2/5 cases, which is the pattern observed in the homologous measles virus-induced SPE of humans; the remaining dogs demonstrated antibodies to nucleocapsid and phosoprotein antigens as well (Rima et al., 1987) .",

Chronic active hepatitis occurs most commonly in Doberman pinschers and is characterized by inflammation and scar tissue formation around branches of small hepatic veins and apoptosis of hepatocytes in zone 3 (Thornburg, 1998) . The inflammatory reaction consists predominantly of macrophages, lymphocytes, and plasma cells, indicating a type IV immune reaction. The exact etiology of this condition is unknown, but the strong breed predisposition tends to support autoimmunity. However, autoimmunity was suspected to be the cause of virtually all chronic active hepatitis in people before hepatitis B, C, D and G virus infections and a number of therapeutic drugs were a demonstrated as causal agents (Desmet, 1997) . The disease in Dobermans is more common in females and the usual age of onset of signs is 2\u00b18 years. However, biopsy studies indicate that actual lesions may be present for up to five years before the condition becomes clinical (Speeti et al., 1998) . Clinical signs include weight loss, atrophy and other irregularities of the liver parenchyma on ultrasonography, elevated liver enzymes, and sometimes jaundice. Corticosteroid therapy may be beneficial to some affected dogs (Dill-Macky, 1995) .",

Adaptive immune responses are characterized by the generation of antigen-specific cells (B-and Tlymphocytes) that specifically target the pathogen, as well as memory cells that allow rapid response to reinfection.",

The most common heritable deficiency of this type in man and animals involves IgA. About 1 : 500 people lack IgA. Absolute deficiencies of IgA are common in Chinese Shar peis, while partial deficiencies are common in German shepherd dogs (Day and Penhale, 1988a) . The disorder has also been observed in other breeds, such as the Beagle. IgA deficiencies are manifested by increased incidence of skin and respiratory infections (Felsburg et al., 1985) . Individuals with IgA deficiencies often have more problems with allergies, probably because the IgE system is called upon to compensate for the lack of IgA-mediated immunity. Several bloodlines in a colony of English cocker spaniels were reported to have relative IgA deficiency, a high incidence of ANA, Coomb's antibodies, SLE, hypothyroidism and idiopathic cardiomyopathy (Day, 1996a, b, c) . Attempts to link aspergillosis in German shepherd dogs to their variable IgA deficiency have been negative (Day and Penhale, 1988a) . Some German shepherd dogs appear to have a selective inability to mount normal humoral immune responses. The majority of dogs with systemic aspergillosis, caused by A. terreus, do not develop demonstrable antibody responses to the organism by agar gel diffusion, counter immunoelectrophoresis, ELISA and indirect immunofluorescence (Day and Penhale, 1988b) . However, these same animals have significantly increased polyclonal IgG production.",

The classical form of this SCIDs is the`boy in the glass bubble', associated with adenine deaminase deficiency. A similar disease, but with a different genetic basis, occurs in Basset hounds. Affected Bassett hounds often develop canine distemper at 10\u00b116 weeks of age, when their maternal immunity wane. The source of the distemper virus is from their live virus vaccines. Animals that do not develop distemper, will usually fail to thrive and die by 5\u00b16 months of age. SCID, associated with a X-linked defect in interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptor function, was described in a family of Cardigan Welsch corgis (Deschenes et al., 1994; Jezyk et al., 1989; Pullen et al., 1997) . The defect is caused by a single nucleotide insertion in the g chain of the canine IL-2 receptor (Somberg et al., 1995) . The same defect has been observed in a subset of people with SCIDS . Clinical features include failure to thrive, hypogammaglobulinemia, absent T-cell mitogen responses, and thymic dysplasia and lymphoid hypoplasia (Snyder et al., 1993; Somberg et al., 1996) . Dogs raised in conventional environments usually die of environmental or vaccine-virus associated infections by five months of age. Dogs with the defect can be maintained indefinitely in gnotobiotic environments, although the incidence of leukemias may be increased .",

Rottweilers are particularly susceptible to parvovirus infection, nasal and systemic fungal infections, and oral papillomavirus infection (Bredal et al., 1996) . Certain Dachshunds have developed severe Pneumocystis carinii infections of the lungs (Lobetti et al., 1996) , a disorder only described in human AIDS patients. A certain subset of young (Medleau and Willemse, 1995) , and occasionally aged (Duclos et al., 1994) , dogs appear to be more susceptible to systemic demodectic mange. Great Danes and Doberman pinchers are more susceptible to cryptococcal infections than other breeds (Malik et al., 1995) . Labrador and Golden retrievers are 5\u00b16 times more susceptible to a type of glomerulonephritis that has been putatively associated with Borrelia burgdorferi infection (Dambach et al., 1997) . Neospora caninum infection, in both neonatal and adult forms, is almost always observed in purebred dogs (Barber and Trees, 1996; Cuddon et al., 1992; Flagstad et al., 1995; Jacobson and Jardine, 1993; Poli et al., 1998; Pumarola et al., 1996) .

In some animals, recurrent disease signs involving the alimentary tract, joints, skin, peripheral lymph nodes, central nervous system and conjunctiva persist through adolescence . The condition has been reportedly associated with variable decreases in one or more immunoglobulin isotopes (Couto et al., 1989; Day et al., 1997) and possible neutrophil functional abnormalities (Couto et al., 1989; Hansen et al., 1995) . Although most breeders feel that the condition is triggered by vaccination (Dodds, 1999) , some puppies have developed the condition even when not vaccinated. The condition appears to fall in the category of common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) of humans. CVID is a heterogenous syndrome (Spickett et al., 1997) , characterized by humoral immunodeficiency involving one or more immunoglobulin isotypes, recurrent bacterial infections and a variety of other immunologic abnormalities (Eibl and Wolf, 1995; Eisenstein and Sneller, 1994) .

Anticancer drug therapy often leads to profound cytopenias during the induction stages of treatment, putting them at grave risk for infection. Autoimmune and drug induced neutropenias of immune origin are often manifested by fevers and sepsis.

Anti-neoplastic drug therapy, aplastic anemias, and myeloid tumors may all be associated with severe neutropenias and secondary infections in dogs.

The antigens on dog cells that define allogeneic differences are found on many cell types. In grafts, alloantigens are rich in passenger host lymphocytes and on graft endothelium. Leukocytes, being particularly rich in histocompatibility antigens and easy to collect from the blood, were the tissue of choice for early researchers. These early researchers used alloantibodies and mixedlymphocyte reactions to define histocompatibility differences between individuals. Antigens that define histocompatibility differences are coded for by genes within the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) and are called dog leukocyte (DL) antigens. The genes of the MHC are found on a single chromosome. The first group of DL antigens that have been defined are called A, hence the term DLA antigens. Current designations of genes and alleles of the MHC in the dog are increasingly derived from actual DNA sequence.",

It usually occurs over a period of 7\u00b114 days when histocompatibility differences are great, or it can take several weeks when histocompatibility differences are weak. It begins as soon as the graft is vascularized in the donor. Donor lymphocytes (present in the graft at time of donation) and the graft endothelium express significant surface concentrations of histocompatibility antigens. Donor or passenger lymphocytes contain the highest level of alloantigens on their surfaces, while normal resting donor endothelium has a much lower amount. Recipient T-lymphocytes surveying the tissues rapidly detect these differences and bind to the surfaces of these cell types. What follows is essentially a delayed type hypersensitivity reaction targeted against donor lymphocytes (passenger lymphocytes) and the graft endothelium. The latter tissue is the essential target of the response, although passenger lymphocytes may play an important primary sensitizing role. Activated lymphocytes specific for the alloantigens of the graft began to bind in low numbers to the graft endothelium and release their cytokines. One effect of the cytokines is to cause the graft endothelium to become activated, which upregulates the surface expression of the alloantigens. This increase in surface alloantigen expression makes the graft endothelium much more vulnerable to attack by immune lymphocytes. As more and more activated T-cells bind to the endothelium, the mass of cytokine release causes eventual death of the endothelium. With the death of the endothelium, thrombosis occurs and the graft dies.",

In this regard, they appear to have a favorable regulating effect on events leading to abnormal antibody production. Glucocorticoids cause a pronounced lymphopenia, which limits the number of these cells available for participation in cell-mediated processes. Glucocorticoids may reduce specific antigen-induced blastogenesis of lymphocytes. These drugs produce a monocytosis, but diminish the response of these cells to some inflammatory mediators.

They produce most of their effects, therefore, by interfering with cell division. Cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan) and chlorambucil (Leukeran) are the most potent immunosuppressive agents in this group. Alkylating agents act against many arms of the immune response. They inhibit normal primary and secondary responses as well as delayed hypersensitivity reactions. They prolong the survival of organ grafts, decrease the production of interferon, diminish antigen trapping in lymph nodes, and inhibit local inflammatory responses. Alkylating agents act on lymphoid cells by killing slowly proliferating antigen reactive cells as well as rapidly proliferating specifically stimulated cells. As such, they inhibit antibody synthesis from 48 h before to a week or more after antigen administration.",

The impression in animals has been that it is less effective than cyclophosphamide as an immunosuppressive agent, but that the decrease in efficacy is compensated for by its lesser toxicity. This drug will probably see increasing usage in veterinary medicine for the treatment of immunologic diseases as clinicians learn to use it to treat more conditions.

Leflunomide has also shown great promise in the treatment of immune diseases in dogs . One of the metabolites of Leflunomide, trifluromethylaniline (TFMA), is highly gastroenterotoxic for dogs. Therefore, the dose and dosage regimen must be closely followed. The drug is teratogenic in rats, so long-term use may lead to an increase in certain neoplasms. The dose for dogs is %2\u00b16 mg/kg/day per os until a serum trough level of 30 ug/ml is achieved.",

Mixed results have been described for splenectomy in dogs.
