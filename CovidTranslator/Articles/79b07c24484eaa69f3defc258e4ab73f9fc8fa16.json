Physiotherapy will have a role in providing exercise, mobilisation and rehabilitation interventions to survivors of critical illness associated with COVID-19 in order to enable a functional return to home.

Efforts were quickly prioritised to develop specific guidance for physiotherapists in the acute care settings.The AGREE II framework 15 was used to guide development, and recognising the expediency of this work required pragmatic and transparent reporting. Conduct was modelled after the GRADE Adolopment Process16 and Evidence to Decision framework17 for recommendations and decision-making. Expertise includes ICU and acute inpatient physiotherapy (all), Through a web search and personal files, recently developed guidelines for COVID-19 management of critically ill patients were identified from international agencies (eg, World A priori it was decided to develop consensus recommendations, given the time-sensitive nature of the guidance.

Class S rooms (standard single rooms, no negative pressure capability), which can be used for isolating patients capable of transmitting infection by droplet or contact routes12 and Class N rooms (single negative pressure isolation rooms), which are beneficial in isolating patients with transmittable airborne infections.12 The preference would be for patients with confirmed and/or suspected COVID-19 to be isolated in Class N rooms.12 If this is not possible, Class S single rooms with clearly designated areas for donning and doffing PPE are recommended.12 In the event of all single Class N and S rooms being fully occupied, the recommendation is for patients with COVID-19 to be separately cohorted to patients without COVID-19 within the hospital.12 In an open ICU or ward-cohorted areas with one or more patients with COVID-19, it is recommended that staff members in the whole area are required to use airborne PPE precautions.12 Box 5 describes how the movement from dedicated isolation rooms to open cohorting might evolve within an ICU.Box 5.Recommendations regarding personal protective equipment for physiotherapists. 5.1 All staff must be trained in correct donning and doffing of PPE, including N95 'fitchecking'.
