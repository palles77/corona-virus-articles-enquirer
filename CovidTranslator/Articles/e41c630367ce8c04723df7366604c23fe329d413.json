[2] [3] [4] The World Health Organization (WHO) definition is ''events attended by a sufficient number of people to strain the planning and response resources of a community, state or nation''. 5 Mass gatherings can be classified into two types: spontaneous gatherings (e.g., the Pope's funeral) and planned gatherings. Planned gatherings may be recurrent at different locations (e.g., Olympics and World Cup) or recurrent events at the same location (e.g., Hajj pilgrimage in Saudi Arabia). The numerous examples of mass gathering events and the number of attendees have been reviewed. 6 One of the major concerns regarding mass gatherings is the importation of infectious diseases resulting in outbreaks, or the exportation thereof, especially at events drawing visitors from different nations, regions, and cultures. 7 Infectious diseases associated with mass gatherings vary depending on the type and location of the mass gathering. 8 For example, religious gatherings are usually associated with respiratory and gastrointestinal diseases.",

Thus, in this review we present an overview of the preparation for the Hajj as an example of a mass gathering.

To simplify data gathering at the primary medical center, the use of digital pens was implemented in 2012 for the transformation of conventional forms into digital forms that provide demographic and medical data in a timely fashion. The system was enhanced in 2013, adding dressing and observation forms, and was also implemented in the outpatient departments of two hospitals (Mena Emergency Hospital and Jabil Arrahma Hospital). Figure 3 depicts an example of the data produced using digital pens to monitor the categories of diagnoses for patients visiting primary care clinics during the Hajj. Database-level integration with both statistics and the Hajj System was achieved and data smoothly transferred from the digital pen system to the other two systems. It is important to note that 1000 forms can be loaded electronically. Thus, it is easy to capture the different diagnoses of patients attending the clinics and to display this in a graph. The ambulance information system (AIS) saves all medical and administrative procedures performed for the patient in the ambulance and sends the data -via the Internet -to the responsible parties in the emergency room (ER) of the destination hospital. Automatic vehicle location (AVL) techniques have the potential to improve urban vehicle fleet operations. 10 The main purpose of this project has been to identify the location of ambulances and guide them via a map with live traffic densities. In addition, the technology allows the tracking of each ambulance's status -moving, idle or off, speed, etc.",

For example, during the 2012 Hajj season and due to the emergence of MERS-CoV a few weeks before the Hajj, 14 the KSA MoH utilized the case definition of MERS-CoV. The main objectives were the following: to monitor MERS-CoV closely during this mass gathering event, to detect any cases among pilgrims and local residents in a timely manner, and to collect information about the virus in the area in which the first case was located if this were to occur. Clinical samples were taken from all suspected cases during 2013 Hajj season and tested for all possible viral etiologies including MERS-CoV; all samples tested negative for MERS-CoV. 15 In addition, following the 2013 Hajj, a cohort of 129 French Hajj pilgrims were systematically sampled with nasal swabs prior to returning to France and were screened for MERS-CoV. The majority of them (90.7%) had respiratory symptoms and none tested positive for MERS-CoV. 16 Respiratory illnesses are common among pilgrims. The most common viral respiratory tract infections are influenza and rhinovirus. 17 The estimated incidence of upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) during the Hajj ranges from 20% to 80%, depending on the type of method used to confirm the diagnosis. 15 During the 2009 Hajj season, the emergence of pandemic H1N1 was of great concern. There was no increased risk of this virus during the Hajj season. 17 A cohort survey was conducted in collaboration between France and Saudi Arabia during the Hajj 2012. 18, 19 Participants were followed up and sampled before departing from France to the KSA, during their pilgrimage in the KSA, and just before leaving the KSA. 18, 19 Nasal swabs were collected from participants and tested for 11 respiratory viruses and four bacteria by real-time reverse transcription PCR. Of 165 participants who had nasal swabs collected before departing to the KSA, eight (4.8%) were positive for one virus or more, including rhinovirus, influenza virus, adenovirus, and enterovirus, and 7.3% had Streptococcus pneumoniae. 18, 19 Among symptomatic pilgrims, 27 (38.6%) were positive for one or more viruses. 18 The rate of S. pneumoniae carriage was 7.1% in the country of origin and 19.5% before departing from the KSA. 19 These data indicate the risk of acquiring respiratory tract infections during the Hajj and the potential for the spread of the acquired organisms upon returning home. 18, 19 ",

In addition, member states should support the efforts of the KSA MoH in making health-related advice available to all travelers departing for Umra or Hajj by working with the travel and tourism sectors and placing such materials at strategic locations. Various strategies for the communication of the health recommendations should be utilized, including pamphlets and radio and television programs. 37 In their guidance to countries, the WHO stressed the enforcement of the recommendation that pilgrims who develop a significant acute respiratory illness with fever and cough (severe enough to interfere with usual daily activities) during Umra or Hajj, or after return to their country of origin, should report to the medical health facility closest to them and cover their mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing and wash hands afterwards, or if this is not possible, cough or sneeze into the upper sleeves of their clothing; further they should avoid attending crowded places and preferably isolate themselves until the end of the respiratory symptoms and, if isolation is not possible, use a tissue to cover the nose and mouth or a surgical mask when in crowded places.",

This has been applied to Ebola this year, with a restriction on pilgrims from countries where outbreaks of Ebola are ongoing, such as Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. The current outbreak was initially reported from Guinea, including the capital city of Conakry, and then in March 30, 2014, cases were reported in the district of Foya in neighboring Liberia; in May 2014, the first cases were identified in Sierra Leone. 38 On August 8, 2014 the World Health Organization declared that the epidemic of ebola to be a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). In addition, the recent polio outbreak in Pakistan and Syria and the WHO International Health Regulation Emergency Committee recommendations have been enforced. Recently, Brazil was exposed to a poliovirus importation with no evidence of transmission and thus no additional measures were needed for travelers. 39 ",
