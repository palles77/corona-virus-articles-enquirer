However, the hypothesis that an individual's health depends not just on the individual's income but also on relative income (ie, the distribution of income within the society in which people reside) has produced mixed results. [1] [2] [3] [4] Many USA and crossnational studies have found income inequality considerably and positively related to all cause-specific mortality, life expectancy and self-rated health status, independent of individual poverty levels or median income. [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] However, some studies in other Western countries and in Japan have failed to find such associations. Subramanian and Kawachi 10 argue that the reason for the conflicting findings may be that many of these studies focus on countries such as Japan, Sweden, Denmark, New Zealand and UK, which are more egalitarian in their distribution of income than the USA and have more comprehensive welfare systems.",

            "text": "To date, we are not aware of any studies that have undertaken this research in China. China has experienced dramatic economic reforms with similar patterns of decentralisation and privatisation as observed in Chile. In fact, after the economic reforms initiated in the early 1980s, China has been experiencing one of the fastest-growing income inequalities in the world. The Gini coefficient increased from around 0.3 in the early 1980s to 0.38 in 1988 and to 0.42 in 1995. 15 The Gini ratio for China was reported to be higher than those for India, Pakistan and Indonesia in the 1990s. 16 On the other hand, China's health performance has slipped dramatically in the last 20 years when compared with preeconomic reform rates. 17 Although the Chinese are now enjoying relatively longer life expectancy (.70-years old) than many developing countries, it seems that most of this achievement was attained before the economic reforms. 18 New health problems appeared and started threatening the health of the nation. One third of the world's cigarettes were consumed in China, where 20% of the world population lived. HIV/AIDs cases are rising at the rate of 30% per year. Schitosomiasis, tamed in the 1950s, is again spreading. Tuberculosis, previously under control, is also on the rise. Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) still remains a threat and avian influenza is becoming increasingly problematic. Environmental deterioration and food safety issues are Abbreviations: CHNS, China Health and Nutrition Survey; GDP, gross domestic product also affecting the general health of the population. 18 Rapid economic growth has not been reflected in increasing public investment in health. Instead, the economic reforms have turned the public-financed and central-planned health system into a more commercialised and decentralised one. The government share in the total health expenditure has steadily declined from 32% in 1978 to 15% in 2002. About 80% of the population did not have health insurance in the 1990s. 19 As a result, health inequality is widening. The ratio of female to male infant mortality rate increased from 0.9 to 1.3 from 1981 to 1995. 20 The infant mortality rate in selected rural areas was as high as 96.2 deaths per 1000 births compared with cities, where it averaged 20 deaths per 1000 births. 21 Lower income groups in China bear a disproportionate share of the morbidity burden. 22 The nutrition intake for the poor also declined in the 1990s. 23 China represents a strong case in the developing world in terms of its changes in inequality and health. Therefore, a study on China, a country with a similar income inequality pattern as that of the USA and Chile, contributes to the literature in this area. In this paper, we examine how income inequality at the provincial level affects individual health, using longitudinal data from the China Health and Nutrition Survey in the 1990s. We hypothesise that provincial income inequality has an independent negative effect on individual health status.",

The first assumes a concave relationship between income and health. Therefore, transferring a certain amount of income from the rich to the poor will result in better average health, as the loss in health among the rich is less than the improvement in health among the poor. In other words, a society with a more equitable income distribution has better average health than a society with a less equitable income distribution. The pollution effect accounts for the contextual effects of income inequality on health. It represents an independent effect that is detrimental to the population health. Testing this independent effect in China is the main purpose of this study.",

In other words, both absolute and relative income may include some pollution effect. However, Wilkinson and Pickett argue that including both absolute income and relative income could therefore overcontrol for the effect of inequality. We argue for a more conservative approach by including both income levels into our model. If our results suggest an effect of income inequality after controlling for absolute income, there is clearly a pollution effect, nevertheless underestimated. Therefore, our model tests the following hypothesis: societal inequality, in terms of provincial-level income inequality, increases the likelihood of reporting fair and poor health status for people regardless of their own income in China between 1991 and 1997.",

In our analysis, the risk of reporting poor and fair health increased by 2.6% with each percentage increase in income inequality. Compared with those living in provinces with modest income inequalities, there was an increased risk of 10-15% of reporting poor and fair health for people living in provinces with greater inequalities in income after adjusting for both micro-level (household income) and macro-level (GDP per capita) income variables. The pattern of the income inequality effect is similar among the 3 years analysed. However, the effect of income inequality on health intensified from 1991 to 1993 to 1997, indicating that the health status in provinces with greater income inequality was increasingly influenced adversely by income inequality, all other things being equal.",

This suggests that vulnerable groups warrant more attention (eg, the elderly, females, less educated and those living in rural areas), as these groups also suffer more from the contextual and societal inequalities in our study.",

Typically, people living in urban areas enjoy better social welfare than those living in rural areas. But our study shows that even after controlling for several important socioeconomic variables, the effect of inequality on health related to income persists. Future studies need to consider using different measures of inequality in contemporary China and examine their effects on health.",

Use of the Gini coefficient of a period earlier than our study period is on the basis of our contention that there is a certain ''lag effect'' in terms of income inequality on health. To assess the validity of the Gini coefficients, we re-processed the model by calculating our own provincial Gini coefficients using the CHNS data and examined how Gini coefficients in an earlier year affect self-reported health in later years. The results remained unchanged. Further, the effect of the income inequality on health using the Gini coefficients from the CHNS sample was stronger than using the mean Gini coefficients from a 10-year period. The effect also consistently increased from 1991 to 1997. As the CHNS data are not nationally representative, we choose to use Xu and Zou's Gini coefficients in our analysis as their data resource is considerably bigger and more representative.",

There seems to be a clear contextual effect of income inequality on health status in China between 1991 and 1997. Further, this association is not confined to the poor. People with higher absolute individual income face societal income inequality when living in a province with higher income inequality. However, the strongest relationship between income inequality and health status is found among people of lower income levels. The findings of this study are consistent with many previous studies, such as those in the USA and Chile. The example of China as a country experiencing dramatic changes in income distribution amidst social and economic transitions suggests that income inequality is an important social determinant of population health. Although many developing countries are now focusing more on the absolute economic and income growth, the experience from China indicates that absolute increase in income does not necessarily guarantee the improvement of health for all.",
