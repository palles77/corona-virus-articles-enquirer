The overall prevalence of virus RNA was 55.8%. We found 2 groups of sequences that belonged to group 1 (genus Alphacoronavirus) and group 2 (genus Betacoronavirus) CoVs. Phylogenetic analysis of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene showed that groups 1 and 2 CoVs were similar to Bat-CoV/China/ A515/2005 (95% nt sequence identity) and Bat-CoV/ HKU9-1/China/2007 (83% identity), respectively. To propagate group 2 CoVs obtained from a lesser dog-faced fruit bat (Cynopterus brachyotis), we administered intestine samples orally to Leschenault rousette bats (Rousettus leschenaulti) maintained in our laboratory. After virus replication in the bats was confi rmed, an additional passage of the virus was made in Leschenault rousette bats, and bat pathogenesis was investigated. Fruit bats infected with virus did not show clinical signs of infection.",

Epidemiologic studies have demonstrated that the fi rst human cases of SARS were caused by CoVs closely related to those found in Himalayan palm civets and raccoon dogs in wildlife markets (1) . This fi nding accelerated surveys of CoVs specifi c for various animals in Southeast Asia to identify reser-voirs for SARS-CoV. These survey fi ndings suggested that palm civets and raccoon dogs are an intermediate host of, but not a primary reservoir for, SARS-CoV because of the low prevalence of SARS-like CoVs in these animals (2) . Moreover, a large variety of novel CoVs in these surveys, including bat SARS-like CoVs, were detected in many bat species in the People's Republic of China and Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (3) (4) (5) (6) .",

However, compared with primary infection by fi eld samples obtained from C. brachyotis, the level of viral genome amplifi cation was low in experimental infection. This fi nding may have been caused by a difference in viral replication in bats of different species. In the fi eld survey, partial nucleotide sequences of group 2d bat CoVs, were detected in 4 bat species. A high prevalence of virus RNA was observed in each bat species (Table 1) . These fi ndings suggest that the group 2d bat CoVs may infect fruit bats of many species. The oral infection study showed that CoV is easily transmitted across species. These results, and the fact that most reported bat CoV sequences have been detected in several bat species (12, 17) , imply that interspecies transmission in bats may be common.",

The 2 new viruses detected in this study are underlined. Percentage of replicate trees in which the associated taxa clustered in the bootstrap test (1,000 replicates) is shown next to the branches. The tree is drawn to scale, with branch lengths in the same units as those of the evolutionary distances used to infer the phylogenetic tree. Evolutionary distances were computed by using the Poisson correction method and are shown as number of amino acid substitutions per site. All positions containing gaps and missing data were eliminated from the dataset. The fi nal dataset included 120 positions. Phylogenetic analyses were conducted in MEGA4(14).
