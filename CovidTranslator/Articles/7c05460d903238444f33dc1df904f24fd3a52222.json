Malaria has been successfully eradicated since 1961 in Japan and now only imported malaria cases are encountered. However, as the number of Japanese people who are going abroad and also the number of foreigners who are visiting Japan increases (about 16 and 5 millions, respectively, in 2001), so does the chance for Japanese doctors to see imported malaria or transfusion-transmitted malaria cases. In fact, the total number of the patients with acute malaria in Japan has been around 100-150 annually for the last 10 years. Of those, about 75% are Japanese and 25% are foreigners, and about 75% are male and 25% are female. The peak age is in the 20 s. Recently, about 45% of patients are Plasmodium falciparum and another 45% Plasmodium vivax infections. The former species is likely to be seen in travelers coming back from African countries and the latter is mainly from Asian countries. The important issue is that patients in Japan have not been diagnosed promptly nor treated properly because doctors in Japan are no longer familiar with tropical medicine. Therefore, some patients are dying from severe malaria as a consequence. As it is, most of the effective medicines for drug-resistant malaria or severe malaria have not been registered in Japan. There is now a need for medical practitioners to focus on travel medicine in Japan.",

Owing to the dedicated effort made through the community-based malaria control programs in local settings in Japan, indigenous malaria has been eradicated since 1961 (Ishigaki City Office, 1999) . In time, the Japanese economy grew and the density of the responsible mosquitoes for the transmission such as Anopheles sinensis and Anopheles minimus decreased with the promotion of hygiene. However, the malaria situation in endemic areas, particularly in developing countries in the tropics, has not improved dramatically; in fact, it is reported to be worse partly because of the emergence of drug-resistant malaria and insecticide resistant mosquitoes. Deterioration of the current malaria situation has also been caused by global environmental changes and population movements. Many people now are traveling in malarious areas, visiting friends and relatives, and coming (back) to regions or countries where there is no malaria. Consequently, the spread of malaria is now a very big burden not only for people in malarious areas but also for those in non-malarious areas (Schlagenhauf, 2001) . Japan is not an exception to this problem, because the number of international travelers from/to Japan is steadily increasing (16,215,647 Japanese people traveled abroad and 5,286,310 foreign citizens came to Japan in 2001). As a result, no fewer than 100 imported malaria cases have been reported annually since 1990 (Ohtomo and Takeuchi, 1998) . A higher incidence of fatalities than that reported in other developed countries has also been seen in Japan, because prompt and proper diagnosis and treatment are not readily instituted by physicians. In this article, we review current trends of imported malaria cases in Japan.",

In order to conquer the situation of the shortage of the available drugs in Japan for the treatment of malaria and other tropical diseases, a Research Group on the Chemotherapy of Tropical Diseases has been established since 1980 supported by a grant from the MHLW. At last in 1987, \"Fansidar \u00ae (pyrimethamine/ sulfadoxine)\" was registered in Japan, and quite recently in October 2001, \"Mephaquin \u00ae SS tablets 275 (mefloquine)\" was allowed to be marketed in Japan as a result of the continuing effort of the Research Group.",

Purpose of the travels, destination and period of travels, prophylactic antimalarials used, initial diagnosis made, chief complaint, present and past histories, species of the parasites infected, and laboratory data during hospitalization, have been asked and compiled. The Research Group is also collecting data on the efficacy or adverse effects of the drugs when they are used. Table 1 shows the number of malaria cases through 1990-2000. During those 11 years, 103-132 cases were identified annually and, of them, 19-36% were foreign visitors. People coming from India have been the largest in number followed by those from the Philippines. The highest number of fatalities was observed in 1998 when the number of deaths was four (data not shown). Because of the increasing number of Japanese travelers to African countries nowadays, the proportion of falciparum malaria cases seems to be gradually increasing. This trend is illustrated in Fig. 1 . From 1994, the proportion of falciparum malaria patients became comparable to that of vivax patients, and the available data on Japanese patients show that nearly three-fourth of them were suffering from falciparum malaria (data not shown). Trends of malaria treatment have been analyzed and precisely reported by one of the present authors (Kimura et al., 2003) . Briefly, mefloquine was used for treatment only in 4.4% of cases in 1990, whereas it has now become more widely used at 78% in 2000. To our surprise, artesunate was administered initially for 36% of the total number of patients in 2000.",

The law before the revision was enacted in 1898 and was quite outdated after 100 years of application. In the new law, infectious diseases are categorized in five groups according to the severity and infectivity: \"Group 1\" consists of seven diseases namely Ebola hemorrhagic fever, Lassa fever, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, Marburg disease, Pest (Plague, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Smallpox); \"Group 2\" has six diseases namely Typhoid fever, Paratyphoid fever, Diphtheria, Cholera, Bacillary dysentery (Shigellosis), Acute poliomyelitis (Polio); \"Group 3\" has only Escherichia coli diarrhea such as O157; \"Group 4\" is currently made up of 30 diseases including such vector-borne diseases as Malaria, Yellow fever, and West Nile fever; and \"Group 5\" is of 42 other diseases i.e. Amoebiasis, Syphilis, and Influenza.

The reporting system has been simplified after the revision of the law by submitting a questionnaire in which the following questions are asked: (1) sex, (2) age, (3) how the diagnosis was made (microscopic, serologic, symptomatic, or by other instruments), (4) description of the chief complaints, (5) date of onset, (6) date of admission to hospital, (7) date of definitive diagnosis, (8) suspected date of contraction, (9) date of death (if the patient is already dead when diagnosed), (10) places of residence for the last few years, (11) suspected place of where malaria was acquired, (12) possibility of being bitten by the mosquitoes, (13) suspected route of infection, and (14) if there are friends or relatives around who are complaining of similar symptoms at the same time. Through this questionnaire, we cannot identify the patient or even know his/her citizenship. Doctors are not asked to submit slide smears of the patient to be re-checked by experts, therefore we suspect there might be some misdiagnosis in deciding the species. In fact, there were some symptomatically diagnosed malaria cases reported without our knowing whether the patients were showing parasitemia. Severity of the patient is not fully described, drugs used for the treatment are not reported, and, as it is, the outcome is not known at all. However, the number of cases reported has been increasing because, under the new law, doctors not reporting a case will be punished with a fine of no more than 300,000 Japanese yen (around 2150 ). ",

Totally 28 cases of transfused malaria were reported before World War II, in which most of the blood donors were patients' parents but 6 paid blood donors were included (Takada and Nakayama, 1948) . During wartime, those paid blood donors were likely to be veterans coming back from tropical pacific areas where malaria was very endemic. Of course, the possibility of transfusion-transmitted malaria was well known to medical technicians in those days, but there was no systematic way to identify the infectious blood. After the war, preserved blood was mainly used for the transfusion, which increased the chance of infection. Then, the first case of preserved blood transfusion-transmitted malaria was reported in 1955 in a 28-year-old man receiving totally 3400 ml of the blood during lung surgery (Takada, 1955) . Twenty-two transfused malaria cases after World War II were summarized by Ito et al. (1985) reporting also that the total number of reported transfusion-transmitted malaria cases in Japan was 57 (1 Plasmodium falciparum case, 41 Plasmodium vivax cases, 1 Plasmodium ovale case, and 14 cases from unknown species). In 1991, platelet transfusion-transmitted malaria was reported in a 70-year-old woman patient suffering from thrombocytopenia, who had been unsuccessfully treated as a consequence (Kano and Suzuki, 1994a) . This case was the last case of transfusion-transmitted malaria case in Japan, and is the 75th reported transfused case so far within the authors' investigation.",

The first case of malaria successfully treated with halofantrine in Japan was reported in 1992, who was a 39-year-old Pakistani male suffering from P. vivax malaria (Yodonawa et al., 1992) . Parasite clearance was rapid and fever dropped dramatically. No adverse reaction caused by the drug was reported except slight nausea. Following this case, the first author (S.K.) of the present paper and his group reported a total of 8 imported cases who were successfully treated with halofantrine: 5 P.f. and 2 P.v.; all Japanese male, 1 P.f. and P.m. mixed; foreign female (Masuda et al., 1992; Kano et al., 1993; Obana et al., 1994; Kano and Suzuki, 1994b) .

Then there were some spontaneous reports of serious ventricular dysrythmiasis with prolongation of QT intervals, so we attempted to monitor ECG while we were treating the patients with halofantrine. We instituted the treatment for two Japanese imported malaria cases (P.o.: male 22 years old and P.v.: male 51 years old) with informed consent, and monitored the ECGs. Consequently, we found that the QT intervals were slightly prolonged with unaffected QRS intervals. No symptoms or signs were observed on their cardiac system other than ECG findings Kano, 1995) . WHO announced a drug alert for halofantrine in which conditions were described which doctors should abide by (WHO, 1993) . Further careful studies on individual Japanese patients to confirm its efficacy or tolerance are needed before halofantrine can be generally used in Japan.",

This drug has been reported to be particularly useful for the treatment of severe and complicated falciparum malaria. The first case of severe malaria treated with artemether (i.m.) in Japan was a 28-year-old Japanese male who had been traveling in Africa (Kano et al., 1988) . On admission, he was already comatose with a parasitemia of 17%. Artemether (i.m.) was administered intramuscularly to the patient with the informed consent of his family. He was successfully cured with no consequent sequelae. In those days, artemisinin derivatives were only distributed by limited authorities in China, from whom the drug had been kindly given to the first author (S.K.). The second case treated with artemether (i.m.) in Japan was a much more severe case of a patient with mixed infection with falciparum and vivax malaria, who showed P. falciparum parasitemia at 29% (Hosaka et al., 1992) . His deep coma improved soon after the administration of the drug. We did not understand why the artemisinin derivatives were so effective, but an experimental study conducted on the morphology of P. falciparum in an owl monkey confirmed the effect of artemether (Kawai et al., 1993) .",

Quite recently, several new data have been reported by Looareesuwan and his group in Mahidol University, Thailand, that combination therapy with artesunate (i.v.) followed by mefloquine is quite effective for the treatment of both drug-resistant malaria and severe malaria. This combination has been tried in Japan on three patients and the outcomes reported (Yasuoka et al., 2001; Itoda et al., 2002 , Yoshizawa et al., 2002 . Now, trends in action towards multi-drug-resistant malaria are being developed with new combination therapies that include artemisinin derivatives. Artemether-lumefantrine (Coartem \u00ae / Riamet \u00ae ) will be one of the very promising combinations (Ishizaki et al., 2003) , which will be accepted for general use in Japan.",
