This resulted in diarrhea, intestinal lesions and extra-intestinal invasion, suggesting that factors affecting these pathogenic properties are located on pVir. In order to analyze the respective roles of the toxins CNF2 and CDTIII in the pathogenesis, colostrum-restricted calves were inoculated with isogenic mutants in the cnf2 and the cdt-III genes. The loss of cnf2 is associated with a reduction in the pathogenicity, since diarrhea does not occur in calves challenged, in spite of successful colonization of the intestine. Nevertheless, the mutant strain remains able to invade the bloodstream and to localize in the internal organs. Conversely, the calves inoculated with mutant in the cdt-III gene evolved in the same way as wild-type strain-inoculated calves with regard to clinical signs and macroscopic or microscopic lesions.",

This can be explained in different ways. CDT-III could play a role not in the pathogenicity itself, but only in the potentialization of the effects of CNF2 by facilitating invasion, for example. Or, CDT-III could play a role in the colonization process, and this effect is masked by the presence of the F17 adhesin. Or, the mutation in the CdtA subunit is not efficient in this case, as CdtB by itself is capable of recapitulating all the toxic effects of the CDT holotoxin when microinjected into host cells, whereas CdtA is more implicated in the translocation of the toxin [22] .",
