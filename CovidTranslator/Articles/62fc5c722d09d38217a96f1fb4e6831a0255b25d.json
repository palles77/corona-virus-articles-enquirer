            "text": "The first human coronaviruses were isolated by different techniques in the United States and Britain at approximately the same time. The British Medical Research Council's Common Cold Research Unit had been studying fluids collected from persons with natural respiratory infections both by standard cell culture isolation methods and by inoculating them into human volunteers. Rhinoviruses or other cytopathogenic agents could be recovered from a portion of the flu ds (36) . There was an additional substantial portion from which no agents could be isolated but which could still cause colds in the volunteers. Organ cultures of human embryonic trachea or nasal epithelium were then used in an effort at detecting the recalcitrant viruses present in the fluids. A specimen, B814, which had been collected in 1960 from a boy with a common cold had not yielded a virus on inoculation into cell culture. After the specimen had been passaged serially three times in human tracheal organ culture, it could still cause colds on inoculation into volunteers, which indicated that replication had taken place. When the specimen was passaged similarly in ferret tracheal culture it lost its ability to produce illness. Additional evidence of viral replication in human organ culture was interference with growth of a second challenge virus and some reduction in ciliary activity. (58) In Chicago during the winter of 1962, five agents were isolated in primary human kidney cell cultures from specimens collected from medical students with common colds. The viruses were ultimately adapted to WI-38 cultures and exhibited a type of cytopathic effect not previously seen. A prototype strain, 229E, was selected for characterization and was found to be RNA-containing, ether labile and 89 nm in diameter, but distinct serologically from any known myxo-or paramyxoviruses. Sera collected from the five medical students all exhibited a fourfold rise in neutralizing antibody titer against 229E (23) .",

            "text": "The fact that these \"novel\" viruses werc of more thanl passing significance became clear when organ culture methods were added to standard cell culture techniques in a study of acute respiratory infections of adults conducted at the National Institutes of Health. Six viruses were found which grew in organ but not cell culture and were ether labile; on electron microscopy the agents were shown to resemble avian infectious bronchitis virus in structure (39) . The B814 and 229E strains were soon also demonstrated to have a similar structure on electron microscopy and to develop in infected cells by budding into cytoplasmic vesicles (1, 2, 22) . As a result of the similarity of the human agents to infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) and also to mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), they were collectively considered to represent a group of vertebrate viruses distinct from the myxoviruses antigenically and structurally (3) . The name coronavirus was adopted for the group to describe the fringe of projections seen arounid them on electron microscopy ( 18) . Except for 229E, none of the human coronaviruses had been successfully propagated in a system other than organ culture. McIntosh et al. reported successful adaptation of two of the NIH isolates, OC (organ culture) 38 and OC43 to the brains of suckling mice. These strains were shown to be essentially identical antigenically but quite distinct from mouse hepatitis virus. Only OC38 and OC43 could be so adapted; the other four OC strains resisted such attempts (37) . Infectious bronchitis virus was known to exhibit hemagglutination under certain conditions but no such phenomenon had been demonstrated for the human strains until OC38 and OC43 had been adapted to mice. Kaye and Dowdle found that the infected brain preparations would directly agglutinate red cells obtained from chickens, rats and mice. The agglutination was specific and was not inhibited by receptor-destroying enzyme. This technique greatly expanded the ability to do epidemiologic studies since it was simple and reproducible (32) .",

Either mouse brain or organ culture material could be used as source of virus; CPE appeared in tube cultures of primary rhesus or vervet monkey kidney cells after two to three passages (11) . Further adaptation to other cell systems was also possible; cytopathic effects developed in BS-C-1 cells by about seven days after inoculation. Not only was cytopathic effect available for reading of neutralization tests; the OC38-43 virus was found to hemadsorb red cells of rats and mice, making available a more precise means of evaluating endpoints in tests involving these organ culture derived strains (30) . The other OC strains which could not be adapted to mouse brain resisted adaptation to cell culture. Finally, immune electron microscopy has been added to the methods available for identifying the presence of coronaviruses in organ culture harvests. This highly sensitive technique should improve the ability to detect virus, but is obviously not suitable for use in all but the most specialized studies (31) .",

            "text": "Since coronaviruses usually produce respiratory illnesses indistinguishable from those caused by many other types of viruses, it is not possible to obtain data on morbidity in the absence of laboratory identification of infection. The viruses are difficult to isolate, so that most workers have relied on serologic techniques to increase the numbers that can be studied. Investigations into coronavirus infection have usually formed part of overall evaluations of the role of viruses in general in respiratory illnesses. As indicated in the partial listing in Table 1 , a variety of different open and closed populations have been used for these studies. The 229E strain was originally isolated from medical students in Chicago as part of a longterm study of respiratory illnesses in young adults (21, 23) . Employee groups have been the source of specimens in the National Institutes of Health (29, 42) and in the studies at Charlottesville, Virginia (26) . Infection has also been evaluated in children's homes (34) or boarding schools (Kendall) (36) in the military (60) , and among children hospitalized for severe respiratory illnesses in various parts of the world (29) . Serologic methods have been used to detect occurrence in persons with acute exacerbations of asthma (40) or chronic obstructive respiratory (21) MIedical studeIlts~2 29E Washiington, DC (29, 42) hlospitalized childreni 2291EJ, 0C43 Bethesda, AID (29, 42) Adult emiployees 229E, OC viruses' Atlanta GA (34) disease (53) . Patterns of coronavirus infection have been identified among the general population residing in the Tecumseh community as part of a longitudinal study of respiratory illness (16, 49) . Human volunteers have continued to be employed, especially to determine characteristics of illness not yet well defined in natural infection because of problems associated with isolation of the viruses (7, 8) .",

The finding of mouse hepatitis antibodies in military recruits and in children and adults from the general population was surprising when first described in 1964 (25) . It is now recognized that this does not indicate past experience with MHV, but rather with human coronavirus strains which are known to cross react with it. In contrast, in a survey of antibodies to avian infectious bronchitis virus, none could be found in a military population. Low level antibodies were detected only in a portion of individuals who had close contact with poultry (45) . This virus is not known to cross react with the human strains.",

The antibody detected was of low titer and appeared to be present for only a short time after infection. This observation was subsequently confirmed in a large scale study, and it was suggested that the presence of CF antibody in a population could be interpreted as evidence for recent activity of the virus (15) . However, if the antigen was highly concentrated, antibody could be detected at a higher titer, and this antibody persisted in the population so that the method could be employed in surveys of prevalence (5) . An indirect HI test has also been described for 229E virus using tanned sheep erythrocytes. The procedure appears to be highly sensitive and no cross reactions with OC43 were observed (35) .",

The hemagglutination titer was higher for rat than chicken erythrocytes, but was sufficient with the chicken cells so that they could generally be employed in HI tests; this is of particular importance in view of spontaneous agglutination which often complicates working with rat erythrocytes. Serum to be tested did not require treatment with receptor-destroying enzyme but rather standard heat inactivation at 56\u00b0C.

In addition to hepatitis of mice and infectious bronchitis of chickens these viruses are responsible for transmissible gastroenteritis and encephalomyelitis in pigs and neonatal diarrhea in calves (44, 55, 56) . They are rather species-specific in their int vitro growth characteristics, especially on primary isolation, but such isolation is easily accomplished (54) . In contrast, the human coronaviruses produce relatively superficial infections of the respiratory tract. Species-specificity is observed here too but even in cell systems of human origin, isolation of some types has not been possible. It is conceivable that special conditions are required for propagation of these agents; this would be similar to the situation that obtained with the rhinoviruses, another surface pathogen, before the availability of WI-38 cells (52).",

The spikes of the virus are distinct in appearance from those of the myxoviruses and are reported to contain glycopolypeptides; both HA and CF antigens have been associated with the surface of the virion, and are presumably located in the projections. No neuraminidase has been demonstrated, and therefore, it has been concluded that the antigens belong to a single species present on the surface.

            "text": "The total number of serologic types infecting man has not been defined. The problem here again revolves around the difficulties encounterd in isolating the human coronaviruses. There is no way of estimating the proportion of existing types that have already been isolated. It is also difficult to determine the separate antigenic identity of types which grow only in organ culture as compared with those which grow in cell culture. Neutralization, CF, HI, gel diffusion and immunofluorescent techniques have been used in the antigenic analyses by McIntosh et al., Bradburne, and Bradburne and Somerset (41, 5, 8) . As would be expected, results have differed by each of these procedures, with neutralization tests the most specific. However, cross reactions were commonly demonstrable even by this method using animal antiserum or immune ascitic fluid, indicating that there must be many shared antigens. An attempt at placing the human coronavirus in broad groups is shown in Table 2 ; mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) is included because of its frequent interrelationships with the human strains and avian infectious bronchitis virus omitted because it is antigenically distinct. The unadapted organ culture strains have been listed separately; it has not been possible to prepare animal antisera against them, and they have been tested only against pairs of serum obtained either from individuals naturally infected or volunteers challenged artificially. Such sera would be expected to be considerably less specific than animal antisera. It has been clearly shown in several laboratories that 229E is quite different from OC38 and OC43 not only in growth characteristics, but also antigenically; cross reactions can be shown by neutralization tests but these are demonstrable only using very sensitive procedures. The LP virus was originally isolated in organ culture and not in cell culture but is closely related antigenically to 229E. The OC38-43 virus has a low level cross reaction with mouse hepatitis virus; in some reports this has been reciprocal and in some one way. Although B814 virus is quite different from OC38-43 virus they both share some antigens in common; again cross reactions with 229E are rare. Among the additional viruses, OC44 is closely related antigenically to OC38 and OC43 but has never successfully been adapted to mouse brain or cell cultures. The four other viruses are listed together by exclusion, not because of any demonstrated relationship to one another, but rather because they are not closely related to viruses in the first three groups. Some low level reactions with the agents in these three groups have been shown to be present, with OC16 virus being the most distinctly d;fferent strain. While neutralization methods are of value in grouping virus, the CF and HI tests and their specificity are of special importance in planning epidemiologic studies; these tests are generally available only for the 229E and OC38-43 viruses. Cross reactions between these two viruses have only rarely been reported when tested by CF against animal sera. With human serum, heterologous rises in antibody titer have been observed occasionally, but not frequently enough to create problems in studies involving significant numbers of specimens (10) . Of greater practical concern is the occurrence of cross reactions between OC38-43 and the other organ culture viruses. It is possible that rises in titer detected when using OC43 antigeni in a seroepidemiologic study may have been caused either by OC43 infection itself or by infection with one of these other viruses which share antigens with it. Indirect evidence that the infecting agent may not be OC43 itself is the apparent disseciation between the CF and HI tests for OC43 observed during a particular period of time. Rises in titer by CF should usually be accompanied by rises in titer by HI in the same serum pairs. If this does not ordinarily occur during one time period but does during a second period, it indicates that a related virus, but not OC43 was circulating during the first time (49) .",

By CF, 229E infection could be related to 3 % of the colds that occurred in the winterspring and to 0.4% of colds that occurred in the summer-fall. While there was some year-to-year variation in activity, differences in the number of specimens tested from various years did not permit complete identification of cyclic patterns. In particular, no specimens were available for the 1966-1967 winter-spring season (26) . Employees of the National Institutes of Health with respiratory illness were studied by both isolation and serology for 229E infection over a six-year period. Again attention was specifically directed toward certain segments of the six years, and no specimens were tested during other segments. Of particular interest once more is the segment from December 1966 to April 1967. Isolation of rhinoviruses and myxoviruses were uncommon at this time, but respiratory illnesses continued to occur. During that period, 24% of those persons with colds studied had rises in titer for 229E. As part of the same investigation, paired blood specimens collected from infants and children admitted to hospital with acute lower respiratory disease during the 1967 period of 229E activity were tested for rise in antibody against the virus but none was found (29, 42) .",

The investigation, carried out from 1960-1967, involved collection of serum specimens related to illness and also routine collection of sera from some non-ill individuals. Infections with the agent were detected in all years of the study but with definite cyclical variation. Seasons most involved were the winter and spring. Overall, 3% of the illnesses recorded in the seven years could be associated with OC43 infection, with a high of 7% in 1960-1961. Interestingly, testing of the sera collected routinely from non-ill individuals indicated that an additional equal number of OC43 infections were occurring without the production of symptoms (34) . The Charlottesville study of adult employees studied OC43 infections along with 229E. Here too the emphasis was on illness and it was found in all years studied that OC43 as associated with 5 % of colds in the winter-spring and with no illnesses in the summer-fall. Again there was cyclical variation from year to year in the number of rises in titer detected (26) .",

In the children hospitalized with lower respiratory disease up to 10% of illnesses during this period were associated with such a titer rise. However, it was impossible to show that the relationship to disease was truly etiologic. This finding was in contrast to that seen with 229E in which no rises in titer were detected in such cases (42, 38) . Another suggestion that OC43 might be involved in lower tract disease came from the study of coronavirus infection in acute respiratory disease (ARD) in the military. During a sharp outbreak of ARD in the winter of 1970-1971, many of the recruits had infections with other agents besides OC43. However, in 29.7%, there was evidence of only OC43 infection (60) .",

CF and HI tests were used on all specimens and neutralization tests were used as an aid in evaluating these results in selected specimens. During the total period, OC43-related infection was detected in 17.1% of the 910 persons studied for one year. Most of the infections took place in the winter-spring months of 1965-1966, 1967-1968, and 1968-1969 . The only winter-spring period without such activity was in 1966-1967 when the 229E outbreak had taken place. There was good agreement between the CF and HI tests for the 1965-1966 and the 1968-1969 periods but not for 1967-1968. The neutralization test was used to clarify the situation. It was found that most rises in titer for the periods in 1965-1966 or 1968-1969, whether they had occurred by CF or HI or both, were also accompanied by rises in neutralizing antibody. In -1968 CF rises in titer were not accompanied by rises in titer in the other test, nor was the reverse true; significant change in neutralizing antibody in this period was exceedingly rare. It was concluded that the outbreaks of infection in 1965-1966 and 1968-1969 probably were caused by agents closely related to OC43, while the 1967-1968 activity was due to one of the other OC viruses which shares some antigens with OC43 but is more distantly related to it. The 1968-1969 outbreak of OC43 infection was nearly as widespread as the prior 229E outbreak, with 25.6% of the population studied showing evidence of infection. Of special interest was the fact that children under five years of age had the highest infection rates (49) .",

The high prevalence of antibody has been confirmed in other studies (26, 34) . Bradburne and Somerset followed prevalence of antibody for OC43 over time, as they also had done with 229E.

Extensive studies have, of course, been carried out by the Common Cold Research Unit which has demonstrated the presence of the agents in Britain. The activity of 229E virus has been documented in Brazil in a study of children and adults with and without respiratory illness. Significant rises in antibody titer accompanied non-hospitalized respiratory infection in the children. Prevalence of antibody was determined by CF, and like the situation in some studies in the North Temperate Zone, children had little antibody while 26% of adults were antibody positive (15) . These findings suggest that coronaviruses will be found to be worldwide in distribution and to cause similar types of illness in different localities; such a situation has been noted with many other respiratory viruses (47) . An attempt was actually made to detect rises in antibody titer for 229E in paired sera collected from small children with lower respiratory infection in many tropical parts of the world.

            "text": "Epidemiic Behavior and Temporal Distribution Because most illnesses caused by coronaviruses are similar to those caused by other respiratory viruses, it is impossible to identify epidemic behavior of the viruses. There is, however, great variation in the frequency of infection both on a seasonal and on a cyclical basis. Isolation and rises in antibody titer for all types of coronaviruses have been rare events outside of the period from December through May. This is the portion of the year in which isolation rates for rhinoand other respiratory viruses often reach their low. In addition, a cyclic pattern can be discerned when individual virus types are considered. In Fig. 2 are summarized data from five longitudinal studies of coronavirus activity carried out in different parts of the United States. In all studies some sporadic activity did occur in nearly all years studied, but rises in antibody titer were concentrated in certain years which far exceeded the means for the entire studies. Those periods are indicated as darker areas in the figure. The times during which specimens were collected in each investigation are indicated in the figure by the large rectangle. For 229E, activity was detected in all four studies at the same times, even though two were in the Midwest and two in the Eastern United States. It seems possible, on the basis of these data, to postulate a two to three year cycle for this agent. The greatest number of infections in Chicago was seen in 1967, after absence of the agent for three years, which would suggest a role of herd immunity in determining the time of reappearance of the agent. With OC43 the situation is quite different. As with 229E, in no investigation did two years with high rates of infection or illness follow one another. A possible exception was in the Tecumseh study. However, the agent which caused the rises in titer in 1967-68 did not appear as closely related serologically to OC43 as the agent involved in the other two outbreaks. This observation indicates a problem in identifying cycling of OC43. The virus undoubtedly shares more antigens with other identified or perhaps unidentified coronaviruses than does 229E (see Table  2 ) and these other viruses may well have cycles of their own which may confuse the situation. In 1964-65 high activity occurred in Atlanta and Charlottesville. However, in Bethesda, just a short distance away, high activity was not seen in that year but in 1965-66, the same time as high activity occurred in Michigan, many miles away. In 1968-69, Charlottesville and Tecumseh data did agree with very high activity in both areas. Thus cycling of the agents was found in all studies but they did not agree on specific years. This may be a result of actually different patterns of occurrence or because of differences in the serologic techniques used to identify infection, which are of greater importance with OC43 because of the problem of cross reactions. The fact that cycling of coronaviruses does exist and occurs every two to four years with production of many infections, suggests that the number of truly different coronaviruses must be relatively small, unlike the situation with the rhinoviruses, in which cycling has been more difficult to demonstrate, in part because of the large number of serotypes (14) .",

In the Tecumseh study, a total population group was followed.

This finding is quite different from the situation that exists with other respiratory agents, such as respiratory syncytial virus, where a more distinct decrease in infection rates can be observed with increase in age (48) . The reversal of the pattern of age-specific infection rates customarily associated with the respiratory viruses becomes complete with 229E. Infection has been more difficult to demonstrate in small children with this agent than in adults. In Tecumseh, during the 1966-1967 outbreak, highest age-specific infection rates by CF were found among those 15-29 years of agc, following a steady increase in infection frequency from the 0-4 year olds. However, when neutralization tests were used to detect rise in antibody titer, the 15-19 year olds still had high infection rates; but the serial increase to that point among younger age groups was much less steep (16) . This would suggest that the appprent sparing of small children with 229E may be a result of the relative insensitivity in the young of the serologic procedures commonly employed. It would be surprising if two different coronavirus serotypes behaved so differently.",

In Tecumseh, adult females experienced higher infection rates with OC43 than adult males, which is in conformity with the usual patterns of all respiratory illnesses (46) . In the study of antibody prevalence of Cardeias, the results were examined by sex but no significant differences could be observed (15) . There are no available data on occupation or racial susceptibility to infection nor on the role of socioeconomic status in influencing rates. Occurrence of infection in closed or special populations, such as the military or children's institutions has been reported (34, 36, 60) . However, it is at present difficult to determine, based on the relative paucity of information on the behavior of the virus in open populations, whether they exhibit any unique features in other settings. The suggestion that OC43 virus might cause ARD in recruits, if confirmed, will be a distinct departure from the types of illness customarily associated with that virus in young civilian adults. The role of the school age child in dissemination of coronavirus has not yet been clearly defined, but it would be surprising if these infections differed in their transmission patterns so markedly from that documented with the other agents. Because of the high frequency of infection in older children and adults, other sites of dissemination may also be of significance. It has, actually, been possible to show that the family unit is of importance in transmission since clustering of 229E and OC43 infections in families was observed in the Tecumseh study.",

No other route of transmission for coronaviruses seems involved in man, although animal coronaviruses are infectious by the fecal-oral route (56) . There is no direct evidence to aid in identifying the main mechanisms of transmission. However, it is possible to compare the epidemiologic behavior of the coronaviruses with other respiratory agents whose transmission mechanisms have been more directly studied. Large scale outbreaks of coronavirus infections have taken place, as in Tecumseh in 1967 (16) . This is much more analogous to the situation seen with influenza than it is with the rhinoviruses. It is likely that the former agent can be transmitted by aerosol in addition to large droplet, which would explain its ability to spread quickly (19) . Rhinoviruses on the other hand are transmitted by large droplet and at times may spread via fomites (27), but not by aerosol. It is therefore probable that human coronaviruses can be spread by aerosol as well as by large droplet. Aerosol transmission has actually been documented in poultry by the agent of avian infectious bronchitis (20) .",

In studies involving human volunteers, the mean period from inoculation of virus to development of symptoms was from 3.2-3.5 days depending on the strain, with a range of from 2 to 4 days (7, 59) . Following exposure, the virus apparently multiplies superficially in the respiratory tract in a manner similar to that in which multiplication occurs in vitro. Virus excretion usually reaches a detectable level at the time symptoms begin, and lasts for 1 to 4 days. The duration of the illness is from 6 to 7 days on the average, but with some lasting up to 18 days. Serologic response to either induced, or to naturally acquired infection has been quite variable depending on the infecting strain and the serologic test employed. For example, among those experimentally infected with OC38-43 virus who had a cold produced, only 46% had rises in titer by HI and 23% by CF. Less than half of those infected with 229E showed a CF rise. It is not clear how the existence or titer of preinfection antibody affects the magnitude of the response detected by these tests. Rises in neutralizing antibody titer are much easier to detect, and have been found with sensitive techniques to be demonstrable in all experimentally infected (5, 8) .",

Possession of circulating OC43 HI antibody among the Atlanta children did not appear to play a role in modifying expression of the subsequent infection (34) . With 229E virus, Hamre and Beam demonstrated that frequency of rises in titers detected by neutralization was inversely proportional to prior neutralizing antibody, which would indicate that this antibody exerted some protective effect. However, the importance of this neutralizing antibody could not be confirmed when infection was detected by CF (21) . Thus, circulating neutralizing antibody as presently measured may bear a relationship to modification of infection but this association is not a very strong one. Since coronavirus infections mainly involve the surface of the respiratory tract, it is likely that secretory IgA antibody plays a more direct role in protection; this has in fact been demonstrated with a swine coronavirus (4).",

Sore throat has been somewhat less common, and in children has been associated with pharyngeal injection (34) .

The mean duration of coronavirus colds, at 6.5 days, is shorter than that seen in rhinovirus colds at 9.5 days (7). There is no clear evidence that these viruses cause severe lower respiratory illness in infants and young children. In fact, such infections were more common in one study among the control group than among the diseased (42). Mufson et al. have associated coronavirus 229E and OC43 infection with acute lower respiratory infections in children at Cook County Hospital (50) . The lack of a comparable control group makes assignment of an etiologic role to the viruses hazardous at present, but the relationship should be sought in the future when it is known that outbreaks are taking place in the community.
