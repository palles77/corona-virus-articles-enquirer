Here, we investigated the immunogenicity of an orf virus (ORFV) vector expressing the full-length spike (S) protein of PEDV (ORFV-PEDV-S) in pregnant gilts and its ability to confer passive immunity and protection in piglets. Three doses of ORFV-PEDV-S were given to two groups of PEDV-negative pregnant gilts, with the last dose being administered two weeks prior to farrowing. One of the two groups immunized with the ORFV-PEDV-S recombinant virus was also exposed to live PEDV orally on day 31 post-immunization (pi). Antibody responses were assessed in serum, colostrum and milk of immunized gilts, and passive transfer of antibodies was evaluated in piglet sera. The protective efficacy of ORFV-PEDV-S was evaluated after challenge of the piglets with PEDV. PEDV-specific IgG, IgA and neutralizing antibody (NA) responses were detected in ORFV-PEDV-S-immunized and ORFV-PEDV-S-immunized/PEDV-exposed gilts. PEDV NA, IgG and IgA were detected in the serum of piglets born to immunized gilts, demonstrating the transfer of antibodies through colostrum and milk. Piglets born to immunized gilts showed reduced morbidity and a marked reduction in mortality after PEDV challenge in comparison to control piglets. Piglets born to gilts that received ORFV-PEDV-S and were exposed to live PEDV showed stronger NA responses and lower clinical scores when compared to piglets born to gilts immunized with ORFV-PEDV-S alone. These results demonstrate the potential of ORFV as a vaccine delivery platform capable of eliciting passive immunity against PEDV.",

PEDV infects pigs of all age groups resulting in an enteric disease with high morbidity. High mortality rates (50%-100%) are observed in neonatal piglets; however, mortality is usually low in older animals [2] . PED is characterized by vomiting, watery diarrhea and dehydration, which are usually followed by death in suckling piglets [3] . After its introduction in the USA in 2013, PEDV caused the deaths of over 7 million piglets, resulting in significant economic losses to the US swine industry [4] . Since then, significant investments and efforts to develop PEDV vaccines have been made, with a few vaccines receiving a conditional license from the USDA. The efficacy of these vaccines in protecting newborn piglets, however, is still unknown.",

Therefore, passive transfer of antibodies through colostrum and milk is critical for protection of neonatal piglets against PEDV [5, 6] . Previous studies with transmissible gastroenteritits virus (TGEV), a coronavirus that is closely related to PEDV, have shown a high correlation between milk antibody levels and protection in piglets [7, 8] . Hence, a requirement for an effective PEDV vaccine is the ability to induce high levels of antibodies in colostrum and milk with their subsequent transfer to piglets born to immunized sows. Although several attenuated, killed, or subunit PEDV vaccines have been developed, most of them fail to induce sufficient levels of lactogenic immunity and protection in newborn piglets [9, 10] . Thus, it is critical to develop improved alternatives to currently available PEDV vaccines.",

            "text": "In the present study, we assessed the ability of ORFV-PEDV-S to induce passive immunity against PEDV following immunization of pregnant gilts. One of the goals of the study was to assess whether immunization with ORFV-PEDV-S alone would be sufficient or if live exposure to PEDV would be required for protection of piglets born to immunized gilts. This underlies our experimental design, in which pregnant gilts were either immunized with ORFV-PEDV-S (G2) or with ORFV-PEDV-S followed by oral exposure to live PEDV (G3). Similar to our findings in 3-week-old weaned pigs [11] , IM immunization of gilts with ORFV-PEDV-S elicited PEDV-specific IgG, IgA and NAs. As expected, the booster provided by live PEDV exposure in gilts from G3 led to higher antibody responses in serum, colostrum and milk of these animals. Notably, passive transfer of antibodies from gilts to piglets was observed in both G2 and G3, as PEDV-specific IgG, IgA and NAs were detected in serum of piglets born to immunized gilts following ingestion of colostrum and milk. NA antibodies detected in piglet serum showed a strong correlation with IgG and IgA levels ( Fig. 3E and F). Although the antibody responses elicited by immunization with ORFV-PEDV-S alone were lower in comparison with those induced by immunization with ORFV-PEDV-S followed by live PEDV exposure, the levels of antibodies induced by IM immunization with ORFV-PEDV-S were sufficient to reduce neonatal mortality after oral challenge with PEDV.",

            "text": "Antibodies present in sow colostrum and milk are derived either from serum or produced locally in the mammary tissue [14] , and transfer of pathogen-specific antibodies from the sow to the piglet via colostrum and milk is critical for protection against the pathogens during the neonatal phase of the piglet's life. In this context, IgA plays a key role in protection against enteric pathogens such as PEDV, mainly because it is stable to proteolytic degradation in the intestine. By remaining in the gut lumen, pathogen-specific IgA can effectively inhibit/ decrease virus infection/replication in the gut epithelium [8, [15] [16] [17] . The results of this study show that increasing levels of IgA in milk of immunized animals paralleled lower disease morbidity and mortality in piglets born to immunized gilts after challenge with PEDV. While severe PED and high mortality (50%) were observed in piglets born to control gilts in G1 (no antibody responses detected), piglets born to gilts in G2 and G3 (high levels of IgA in G2 and even higher in G3) showed less-severe clinical signs and reduced mortality rates (5 and 0%, respectively). These results suggest that PEDV-specific IgA detected in piglets in G2 and G3 may have contributed to reducing disease severity and mortality in piglets. The possibility that other antibody isotypes or T cell-mediated immunity may have played a role in protection, however, cannot be formally excluded.",

            "text": "One of the most important observations of our study was the reduced mortality in piglets from G2 (5% versus 50% in the control group, G1), which were born to gilts immunized IM with ORFV-PEDV-S. Notably, the lower piglet mortality in this group paralleled S-specific IgG, IgA and NA responses detected in the gilts and passively transferred to piglets. Together, these observations show that parenteral immunization with ORFV-PEDV-S is sufficient to induce protective levels of passive immunity against PEDV. These results corroborate the findings of previous studies in which PEDV specific-antibodies have been detected in serum and colostrum/milk and passively transferred to piglets after parenteral immunization with live, inactivated and/or subunit vaccine candidates [18] . Although the mechanism(s) underlying this phenomenon remain unknown, it is possible that systemic antibodies could be transferred from the sow's serum to colostrum and milk and then to the piglets. Alternatively, the immunomodulatory properties of the ORFV vector used here could potentially lead to migration of antibody-secreting plasma cells to the mammary gland, resulting in local antibody production. Future studies assessing local immune cells in the mammary gland and antibody isotypes in the intestinal lumen of piglets born to immunized sows will be critical for dissecting the precise mechanism(s) underlying the protective immune responses elicited by IM immunization with ORFV-PEDV-S observed here.",
