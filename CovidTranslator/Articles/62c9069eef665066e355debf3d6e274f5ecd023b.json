We use a mathematical model, structured on the location at which infection occurs and based on published parameters for influenza, to describe an epidemic in a community of one million people. The model is then modified to reflect a variety of control strategies based on social distancing measures, targeted antiviral treatment and antiviral prophylaxis and home quarantine, and the effectiveness of the strategies is compared. The results suggest that the only single strategy that would be successful in preventing an epidemic (with R 0 Z2.0) is targeted antiviral treatment and prophylaxis, and that closing schools combined with either closing work places or home quarantine would only prevent such an epidemic if these strategies were combined with a modest level of antiviral coverage.",

New Zealand is one example of such isolation, and this study addresses the threat to the country from pandemic influenza. Travel times from any other major land mass mean that the importation of infection through surface contamination is unlikely, and those arriving by sea would have had time to express symptoms en route. Hence, if pandemic influenza were to reach the country, the most probable scenario would be that an epidemic had already started elsewhere, and the virus would be introduced to New Zealand by an infected traveller. A response plan for dealing with such an event has been formulated (Jennings 2005; Coker & Mournier-Jack 2006) . The major point of entry to the country is Auckland, which is also by far the biggest city and the most probable region for an epidemic to be initiated.",

The assumed parameter values are summarized in table 1. These are mostly taken from other published modelling exercises, and would be revised in the event of a pandemic as data become available. See the papers cited and their citations for details of the assumptions that led to these estimates. The exception is the assumed 95% uptake of antivirals. It was observed that 81% of passengers on a cruise ship took antiviral prophylaxis when offered during an outbreak of seasonal influenza (Miller et al. 2000) . As pandemic influenza is a more serious threat to health, a higher uptake was assumed. We investigated the potential effects of control measures based on social distancing by determining how their implementation would modify the mixing matrix W to form a new matrix W c . The basic reproduction number under control is then R c Z kW c kR 0 . Hence, we determined the 'threshold' control effort, which reduces R c to 1. For example, reducing transmission in schools would multiply the second row of the matrix W by a factor c to obtain W c . The threshold value determined was that value of c which led to kW c kZ1/R 0 and hence R c Z1.",

If R c O 1.0 for an intervention, then the final size equation (1.1) was used to compute P, the proportion of the population that would be infected if those control measures were in place throughout the epidemic. These are also shown in figure 4. The equivalent results for R 0 Z1.1 and R 0 Z3.0 are shown in figure 5.",

            "text": "The final size of the epidemic, as computed, shows that should the basic reproduction number (R 0 ) be equal to 2.0 we could expect nearly 80% of the population to become infected. The population here is a homogeneously mixing community of one million people, motivated by the City of Auckland (population approx. 1.2 million). The epidemic would peak at approximately 65 days, with peak incidence of approximately 43 000 new cases per day. Increasing R 0 to 3.0 results in a faster epidemic infecting more than 90% of the population. For different size populations the proportion infected is determined only by R 0 , but a larger population size results in an epidemic that takes longer to complete. The basic reproduction number under control (R c ) and the proportion of the population infected in an epidemic (P) if R c O1. The numbers on the horizontal axis specify the control scenarios: 1. no control; 2. close schools; 3. close workplaces; 4. 2 and 3 combined; 5. TATP; 6. quarantine (70%); 7. quarantine (50%); 8. 2 and 6 combined; 9. 2 and 5 combined; 10. 5 and 6 combined; 11. 2, 5 and 6 combined; 12. 2, 3, 5 and 6 combined. For further details see text. The proportion of the population that is infected in an epidemic, as determined by equation (1.1) , is plotted in figure 2 , where it is compared with the results obtained by other authors from simulation models for outbreaks of pandemic influenza. The results suggest that the final size equation (1.1) overestimates the proportion infected in an epidemic as determined by the more complex models, except in the case of Wu et al. (2006) . This could be due, in part, to several reasons, apart from the obvious one that the structure of all these models is more complicated and the equation does not necessarily apply. For example, with a stochastic, spatially structured, individual-based model, local exhaustion of susceptible contacts will occur. In addition, the analytic final size equation is for the proportion infected over an infinite time-scale, whereas numerical simulations often cease when the incidence becomes small and the epidemic 'is largely over' (Ferguson et al. 2005) . For complicated models, it is not always clear how the value of R 0 relates to the parameters in the model, and the supplementary information to Germann et al. (2006) provides a discussion of this point. Hence, there are reasons for uncertainty about the points plotted in figure 2, in both the vertical and horizontal directions.",

If this were applied uniformly across all locations and at a level sufficient to prevent a major outbreak, then transmission would need to be multiplied by 1/R 0 to achieve R c Z1. The results in table 2 also show the effects of social distancing applied to specific locations, for example if R 0 were equal to 2.0, it would be necessary to eliminate 85% of transmission that takes place in schools and workplaces to prevent a major epidemic. This assumes that there is no compensatory increase in transmission, for example within the household. One can envisage that closing schools could result in increased household transmission, as the children would spend more time at home, and possibly the parents too. However, there could be a considerable educational component associated with taking this action, leading to improved hygiene and decreased transmission within the household. Hence, we have taken a neutral position, assuming no change in the model. If R 0 were less than 2.0, then the prospects for control would be more optimistic.",

All of the strategies successful in preventing an epidemic, with R 0 Z2.0 (R c !1), involved TATP, with the assumption of 95% uptake and 60% efficacy. However, the strategy of closing schools (100% compliance) combined with either closing workplaces or home quarantine (70% compliance; no. 4 and 8 in figure 4) resulted in values of R c just over 1. These strategies, combined with a modest amount of antiviral coverage would be sufficient to reduce R c below 1. Under the low basic reproduction number assumption (R 0 Z1.1), all strategies considered apart from closing schools were sufficient to contain epidemics. Under the high basic reproduction number assumption (R 0 Z3.0), the only strategies sufficient to contain epidemics involved the use of antivirals, school closure and home quarantine. These results are derived assuming that there is no delay from the start of the epidemic until putting the strategy in place. As the scenario is that a pandemic has started elsewhere and is subsequently imported, it is reasonable to assume that the authorities have a response plan in place and the delay is minimal. Hence, the proportion infected will be approximately as calculated. This caveat does not affect the basic reproduction number under control (R c ) for each strategy.",
