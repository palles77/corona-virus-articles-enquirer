The ease of propagation and identification of SARS by well-established, standard virological methods were also of significance. The causative virus was grown without particular difficulty or problems with detection in readily available standard cell-culture systems. Within a month of the identification of SARS as a new clinical entity of uncertain aetiology -in late February 2003 in Hanoi, Vietnam -the virus had been grown in several laboratories. Researchers at the University of Hong Kong 8 cultured the virus using foetal rhesus monkey kidney cells challenged with material from an open lung biopsy from a 53-year-old male Hong Kong resident, and a nasopharyngeal aspirate from a 42-year-old woman. Researchers at the Bernhard Nocht Institue for Tropical Medicine, Hamburg 9 used Vero cells inoculated with sputum from a 32-year-old male physician who had fallen ill in New York, after travelling from Singapore where he had treated a patient. Finally, at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Atlanta 10 , researchers cultured the virus in Vero cells inoculated with oropharyngeal samples from a 46-year-old male physician working in Vietnam, sputum from a 49-year-old male, a kidney sample from a 46-year-old male and oropharyngeal washings from an adult Vietnamese patient. In Hong Kong and Atlanta the results of thinsection and negative-staining electron microscopy showed unequivocally that the cytopathic effect was being caused by a coronavirus. In all three laboratories, reverse transcription PCR and comparison with known coronavirus sequences revealed the same sequence identity; this work also showed that the SARS virus was new, because its sequences were only distantly related to those from the wide range of previously sequenced coronaviruses that infect humans, dogs, cats, pigs, bovines, rats, mice, turkeys and chickens.",

The only other virus spread by the respiratory route with an R 0 value approaching that of SARS is smallpox. For isolated pre-twentieth century populations with negligible immunity, Gani and Leach 3 estimated the R 0 value for smallpox to be 3.5-6.0 and, for 30 importations into Europe between 1958 and 1973, to be about 5.5 for community-acquired disease. Although an R 0 value of this magnitude means that without control measures an outbreak would grow exponentially, in the case of smallpox outbreaks it was always possible to rapidly reduce the value of R 0 during the progress of an outbreak. Maintaining the R 0 value below 1 prevented the development of secondary cases; it was achieved by locating and isolating cases, and creating a ring of immune individuals around the outbreak by vaccination. Outbreaks lasted only for weeks, with case numbers rarely exceeding double figures; more than three-quarters of outbreaks ended with the generation that was infected immediately after the detection of infection.",

This was the case for both SARS and smallpox, and nosocomial transmission was indeed a characteristic feature. In 45 outbreaks of variola major in Europe between 1950-1971, reviewed by Mack 5 , transmissions in hospital settings far outnumber those in any other category.

It challenged microbiologists to identify the aetiological agent and satisfy Koch's postulates -in so far as they ever can be met for a virus -in real time. Not only were the patients' respiratory secretions and the agents grown in cultured cells put under the microscope, but so were the actions of politicians. What lessons can we learn from SARS?",

How severe a test did SARS pose? Were we lucky? The answer is 'yes, we were' . This is qualified by the number of deaths that it caused; however, it is due, at least in part, to the properties of the virus. Most important is the low R 0 value -the basic reproductive number -for the SARS virus, which represents the number of secondary infectious cases that are generated by an average infectious case in a susceptible population. The R 0 value predicts the likelihood that an infectious agent will start an outbreak, the amount of transmission that can be expected in the absence of control measures and the ability of these control measures to reduce spread. Studies on the SARS outbreak in Hong Kong 1 -after the exclusion of two 'superspread' events where special circumstances allowed index cases to infect many individuals (at the Prince of Wales Hospital and at the Amoy Gardens estate) -gave an estimated R 0 value of 2.7. This is much lower than for any other virus that is spread by the respiratory route; R 0 values for such infections in England and Wales have been estimated to be 16-18 for measles, 10-12 for chickenpox, 11-14 for measles and 6-7 for rubella 2 .",

Reports in early February 2003 from Guandong Province, China, of 305 cases and five deaths owing to an atypical pneumonia of unknown aetiology, coupled with the isolation of an avian influenza virus A subtype H5N1 from two members of a family that had visited Fujian Province, China, in January, caused the activation of the pandemic plan. From analyses of samples taken from Vietnam, Singapore and Hong Kong, laboratories in the network ruled out the possibility of infection by any of the known influenza virus strains or other established causes of pneumonia, and concluded that SARS was new. On 15 March 2003, the WHO issued emergency travel advice and, using the influenza network as a model, set up a network of scientists from 11 laboratories around the world to identify the causative agent and develop diagnostic tests. Laboratories were chosen owing to their experience in detecting a wide range of microorganisms, a history of collaboration in international investigations coordinated by the WHO, their technical capacity to fulfil Koch's postulates and their access to SARS samples. Rules governing the confidentiality of data were set -shared data and information would only be used to advance the project in a collaborative way, data would only be shared outside the network with the approval of the originating laboratory, and caused by a virus of subtype H1N1 -the possibility of the emergence of a virus strain capable of causing a similar event has, of necessity, been contemplated. The World Health Organization (WHO) initiated its international cooperation coordination programme in 1947. Pandemics with significantly lower mortalities occurred in 1957 (Asian flu, subtype H2N2), 1968 (Hong Kong flu, subtype H3N2) and 1977 (Russian flu, subtype H1N1) (TABLE 1). Although none have occurred since, the influenza outbreak that occurred in Hong Kong in 1997, although local and small in case numbers, had such a high mortality rate in confirmed cases that it stimulated a review of pandemic response policies both in Hong Kong and internationally. It meant that the Hong Kong Department of Health, Hospital Authority and laboratory surveillance facility 11 , and the WHO, were particularly well prepared to respond to the SARS outbreak.",

The virus strain resisted characterization with the available reagents; by August, detailed study in The Netherlands and the United States had revealed that the virus was closely related to the avian strains that were prevalent in March. In November, human cases caused by this virus began to occur; by late December, there had been 17 cases, of which five were fatal. Contact with chickens had occurred in all confirmed cases.

These guidelines were revised after the Hong Kong influenza epidemic to include two strategic steps that were important in the outbreakrisk assessment (data collection and data evaluation) and risk management (continuously considering and reviewing the stages of a response, defining the risks and benefits, and making recommendations for the next steps to be followed). These principles underpinned the WHO response to SARS. The WHO Global Influenza Surveillance Network of four collaborating centres (in Atlanta, London, Melbourne and Tokyo) and 112 committee was charged with the identification of lessons to be learned and with making recommendations for future epidemics. They focused on seven principles: a strengthened epidemiology capacity, systems for early detection and reporting, contingency planning, clear command and control structures, integrated responses, a surge capacity and transparency and effective communication.",

It could be said that this might be a reflection of the backgrounds and interests of the committee that generated the report -the two co-chairs (both from the United Kingdom) were experts in hospital management and administration and in public health, respectively. But it is very probable that it reflects another problem -the lack of regard that is paid to the importance of microbiology in the response to microbiological threats to public health. Reforming and improving healthservice administrative structures and information systems, and planning for unexpected rises in the number of contagious patients are all necessary, but by themselves they are insufficient. The flaw in Hegel's aphorism about lessons from history is that microorganisms evolve in real time; learning lessons from past failures (and successes) will be insufficient because evolution throws up new challenges. In their review 18 , MacLehose, McKee and Weinberg state that \"one of the greatest challenges facing surveillance systems is awareness of the unexpected, recognizing when things seem not quite right. Nipah virus was thought to be Japanese B encephalitis, West Nile virus in New York was thought to be St Louis encephalitis, and prions were thought not to cross species barriers. Focusing surveillance systems on the diseases of today fails to address the challenges of an uncertain future\". We were lucky with SARS due to the existence of a network of laboratories that were looking for new influenza viruses and which were linked by the mature surveillance network run by the WHO. Other microbiological networks also exist. For food-borne pathogens there are, for example, Pulse Net 19 in the United States (which uses standardized pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) protocols to generate and compare profiles of Escherichia coli O157, Salmonella spp. and Listeria monocytogenes), and Enternet more than \u00a38 billion. The conclusions of the 'Lessons to be Learned Inquiry' 16 regarding the role of British virologists before and during the outbreak speak for themselves. The report states that, although the Pirbright Laboratory is the world reference laboratory and holds data on reported outbreaks throughout the world, \"there is no coherent assessment of the full range of work undertaken by Pirbright in relation to the national surveillance and control strategies\" and \"the service arrangements in place in 2001 covered the processing of 300 samples a year\u2026but contained no procedure for increasing the level of provision in an emergency\".

Whether an early reversal of the denial of SARS by the Chinese authorities during the early part of the epidemic would have had a significant effect on later events can only be a matter for speculation.

There is a tradition in the United Kingdom of responding to disasters by holding rigorous inquiries afterwards, which are expected to leave the public feeling \"confident that a searching investigation has been held, that nothing has been swept under the carpet and that no punches have been pulled\" 15 . Although this is good, the pity is that the need for such inquiries seems to recur far too often. In 2001, the United Kingdom suffered a serious outbreak of foot and mouth disease (FMD). Millions of animals were slaughtered, and the overall costs totalled \"The lesson for microbiologists is a stark one -they operate in a political environment, and it can be unhelpful.\" (which uses phenotypic data for typing), Salmgene and PulseNet Europe (both of which use PFGE) in Europe. The European Commission has proposed the creation of a European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention 20 to standardize surveillance methods, ensure data compatability, provide scientific assessments, technical support, information to officials and to the public, and to assume responsibility for existing networks and early warning and response systems. However, it is proposed that it will only have a staff of 15. The European Health Commissioner David Byrne explained that \"it will be a hub, an intelligence centre. The core is already in place\". In this way it will be utterly reliant on national laboratories, national microbiologists and national infrastructures. Is this 'core' up to the job? Consider the United Kingdom. Its core is at least as effective as that of any other large European country. In universities, for example, it has many microbiologists of international rank 21 . However, recent inquiries have identified serious problems. The recent report of the House of Lords Select Committee on Science and Technology, 'Fighting infection' 22 , concluded that the infectious disease services in England that are \"expected to protect the population from both common and more unusual infections are under-resourced and over-stretched\u2026there is not enough surge capacity\". The report went on to predict that \"without improvements we fear that this country will suffer from major epidemics\". The Academy of Medical Sciences inquiry 23 into 'Academic medical bacteriology in the twenty-first century' focused on research. The inquiry concluded that although bacteriology has recently undergone a transformation with the introduction of several new techniques, \"medical microbiology departments in the United Kingdom, with a few exceptions, are in a state of torpor\u2026\". So microbiologists need to get their act together, and it will not do to rely on the bursts of funding and political approval that result from the panic engendered by disease outbreaks. Hegel was right; history tells us that this kind of support is short-lived. SARS proves the point. In July 2003, the WHO declared the world to be free of SARS, and in August 2003, Klaus St\u00f6hr, its SARS research coordinator, stepped down and returned to influenza work owing to a lack of money 24 .",
