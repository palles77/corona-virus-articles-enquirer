The pneumonia was highly contagious and affected those who had been in close contact with the patients, such as health care workers and family members of the patients. The etiologic agent of this atypical pneumonia was not identified initially, and in many patients, their chest condition rapidly deteriorated and resulted in death. 1 In late February 2003, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention termed this condition severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). 1 In Hong Kong, SARS was first seen in a tourist from southern China. He was a medical doctor who had been taking care of patients with atypical pneumonia in Guangzhou and had had symptoms of a respiratory tract infection for 1 week before checking into a hotel in Hong Kong. This 64-year-old physician died from his chest infection 2 weeks later. Those other hotel guests staying on the same floor as this medical doctor, as well as their visitors, contracted the disease through social contacts. When the visitors returned to their residences in Hong Kong, they brought with them the disease, which led to its dissemination. Other guests staying at the hotel in Hong",

Eventually, a virus belonging to the family Coronaviridae was isolated from a lung biopsy specimen and from a nasopharyngeal aspirate. Subsequent investigations found that patients with SARS showed a serologic response to this virus. 8 The family Coronaviridae includes the genus Coronavirus and Torovirus. Both of these are RNA viruses that are known to cause a variety of diseases in human beings and animals. A major cause of the common cold is related to the Coronavirus: types 229E and OC43. 9 These viruses occasionally are responsible for causing pneumonia in neonates or in elderly, debilitated, or immunocompromised patients. Some animal coronaviruses such as the avian infectious bronchitis virus might cause respiratory, gastrointestinal, or neurologic diseases. 10 Using the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction technique (RT-PCR), investigators first identified the sequence of a polymerase gene from a Coronavirus in the nasopharyngeal aspirate of 1 patient. 8 With the use of similar techniques, the isolation and identification of segments of this viral RNA were also confirmed from the throat swabs of patients with SARS. 11 The genome of the SARS-associated Coronavirus has now been sequenced, and this might be useful in the development of an antiviral agent or vaccine. 12",

This has posed a significant threat to medical and nursing staff caring for these patients, especially when the patients are receiving ventilatory support, in which frequent suctioning to remove bronchial secretions is mandatory. Postmortem examination of patients who died of SARS showed that most had diffuse alveolar damage affecting the lungs. The morphological changes identified included bronchial epithelial denudation, loss of cilia, and squamous metaplasia. The increased presence of macrophages and hemaphagocytosis suggests that cytokine dysregulation was responsible for the clinical picture. 24 The therapeutic regimens developed included the combined use of an antiviral agent, ribavirin, and pulsed methylprednisolone. More than 50% of patients showed a rapid and sustained response, and 45% showed steady improvement with these management strategies. 25 With this treatment regimen, the associated morbidity was acceptable, and the patient mortality rate was markedly reduced.",

            "text": "It has been reported that viral DNA is present in the aerosol generated by CO 2 lasers used to treat papillomavirus-infected verrucae. 26 Recent studies 27 have shown that these viral particles are infective and may be responsible for the transmission of disease. Thus, generation of aerosol should be reduced to a minimum during the care of patients with SARS so that transmission of the Coronavirus can be prevented. The size of aerosols considered to carry particles in a hospital environment is 0.3 to 0.5 \u00b5m, 28 and filters used to trap particles in the plume generated by laser therapy are 0.22 \u00b5m. 29 For health care workers taking care of patients with SARS, one piece of personal protective equipment is the N95 mask, which will filter 95% of particles 0.1 to 0.3 \u00b5m. 30 The effort to reduce the spread of disease through direct contact or droplet contact in hospitals managing these patients involved generating, implementing, and enforcing a series of guidelines. 31 These included the identification and reporting of affected patients, dissemination of information to the public, enforcement of infection control measures, development of diagnostic tests, evaluation of therapeutic regimens, and the coordination of clinical services. These measures are primarily directed at tracing and isolating the contact of patients as soon as possible before they spread the virus further. 32 The various measures used to prevent transmission of infection by direct contact include the use of gloves, surgical masks, gowns, goggles, N95 masks, face shields, and total body coverings such as Barrier Man suits. The choice of personal protective equipment has to balance the need for adequate protection with the need to easily move and carry out various procedures during patient care. Wearing masks, gowns, and gloves and frequent washing of hands were adequate in significantly reducing the risk of cross-infection during the care of patients with SARS. 33 Overall, about 20% of patients infected with SARS require endotracheal intubation and ventilatory support during the course of the disease; the risk of disease transmission at the time of intubation is quite significant. 34 Necessary precautions must be taken when caring for these patients who require the use of a ventilator. The risk of being infected with SARS when carrying out surgical procedures such as tracheostomies or other emergency operations for infected patients is high. Measures should be taken to reduce the risk of transmission during surgery.",
