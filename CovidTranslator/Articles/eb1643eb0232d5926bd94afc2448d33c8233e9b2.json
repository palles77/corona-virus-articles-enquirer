The sharing of experience and ideas among speakers and delegates from different countries and cultures was very fruitful. Although the Summit was widely publicized in our countries, June would have been a difficult month for many interested delegates to attend, and this author believes that an even greater attendance would have been achieved if the Summit had been held in the autumn.",

His understanding of the problems that we face locally in implementing standard infection control precautions, and his suggested solutions, set the scene for the rest of the Summit. After his talk he discussed with delegates the possibility of developing a Middle East Association of Infection Prevention affiliated to the HIS; this idea was attractive to many delegates, and we hope that it will progress.",

These animals are known to have a high rate of carriage in nose or lung tissue, and a recently published study has shown that the seroprevalence of MERS-CoV antibodies is significantly higher in camel-exposed individuals than in the general population. 1,2 Dr Omrani then discussed the importance of social media in dispersing the news among KSA cities during the MERS-CoV outbreak, emphasizing the importance of being transparent during outbreaks of infection, engaging with the public through effective communication. Although Dr Omrani showed the value of surveillance in relation to MERS-CoV, a later presentation by Dr Muhammad Halwani, giving an overview of infection control in the Middle East, focusing on multidrugresistant organisms, brought home the fact that limited surveillance data are available in most Middle East countries.",

In countries such as ours where attitudes towards safety among healthcare workers are quite different, where diagnostic facilities are limited, and where waste disposal and decontamination are less regulated, the threats posed by emerging infections are even greater. The presentations that followed from Dr Tim Boswell and Peter Hoffman highlighted the constraints imposed on infection control in countries with limited resources. The former speaker highlighted the role of the environment in the transmission of nosocomial pathogens and the role of cleaning and disinfection. The latter presentation was particularly interesting for those of us working with limited resources, and covered the safe reprocessing of reusable instruments, as well as reminding us of the importance of not reprocessing single-use items.",

            "text": "The free paper presentations were well received by local delegates; it was very useful to hear about local experiences, and I was only sorry that this session was not longer. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the predominant theme of these presentations was that of antibiotic-resistant Gram-negative bacteria. The first presentation was from colleagues at Mansoura University in Egypt who described how bloodstream infections were the commonest healthcare-associated infection in their hospital, with a predominance of multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria (and also a relatively high prevalence of MRSA). A presentation from Dr Abdalla Ahmed and colleagues used an investigation of isolates of Acinetobacter baumannii to show the future potential of next-generation sequencing in understanding the epidemiology of healthcare-associated pathogens. The presentation concluded with a reminder that automated data interpretation tools are required in order to generate easily understandable clinical reports. The final presentation in this session was from Dr Arif Al-Hamad, who described the epidemiology and aetiology of Gram-negative bacteraemia at Qatif Central Hospital, Saudi Arabia. Although there had been no significant changes in non-critical care areas of the hospital over the nine-year period studied, non-fermentative Gram-negative bacteria, especially A. baumannii, had become increasingly important in critical care units. This suggests that infection control measures have so far been more successful in preventing infections with Enterobacteriaceae than with non-fermenters, and reminds us of the threat posed by drug-resistant A. baumannii.",

I considered the use of personal protective equipment to protect against bloodborne virus infection, while Dr Valerie Harmon discussed hand hygiene and reminded us of some of the interventions that have been reported to improve hand hygiene in studies from around the world. At the end of our session we presented delegates with a clinical scenario, and heard a range of different responses from different cultures. This was a fitting reminder at the end of the conference that different cultural attitudes and access to resources are important even in countries from the same geographical area.",
