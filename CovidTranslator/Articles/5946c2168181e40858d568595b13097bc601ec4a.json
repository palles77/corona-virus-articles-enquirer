The general aircraft-cabin air-contaminant transport effect model seeks to build exposure-spatial relationships between contaminant sources and receptors, quantify the uncertainty, and provide a platform for incorporation of data from a variety of studies. Knowledge of infection risk to flight crews and passengers is needed to form a coherent response to an unfolding epidemic, and infection risk may have an airborne pathogen exposure component. The general aircraf-tcabin air-contaminant transport effect model was applied to datasets from the University of Illinois and Kansas State University and also to case study information from a flight with probable severe acute respiratory syndrome transmission. Data were fit to regression curves, where the dependent variable was contaminant concentration (normalized for source strength and ventilation rate), and the independent variable was distance between source and measurement locations. The data-driven model showed exposure to viable small droplets and post-evaporation nuclei at a source distance of several rows in a mock-up of a twin-aisle airliner with seven seats per row. Similar behavior was observed in tracer gas, particle experiments, and flight infection data for severe acute respiratory syndrome. The study supports the airborne pathway as part of the matrix of possible disease transmission modes in aircraft cabins.",

A review of previous studies showed that female flight attendants may be at increased risk of adverse reproductive outcomes (Waters et al. 2000) . Exposure assessments and epidemiologic studies in the areas of radiation and cabin air quality studies followed (Waters et al. 2000; Grajewski et al. 2002; Whelan et al. 2002) . Difficulties in conducting studies in the passenger aircraft cabin environment during flight led to the decision that further work be done using realistic cabin mock-ups and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to understand the behavior of any air contaminants present.",

It is no small accomplishment to provide a safe atmosphere at cruise altitude, say 35,000 ft. In addition to pressurization, the ECS provides clean outside air to the cabin, which has a high occupancy density compared to, for example, office buildings and classrooms. In newer aircraft, approximately 50% of the air supplied to the cabin has been recirculated and passed through a high-efficiency particle air (HEPA) filter, with the remaining supply volume coming from the outside. The ECS is designed to use the length of the cabin as a plenum, so that air is supplied and exhausted at a velocity that is constant with respect to the length of the plane. Also, the direction of flow out of the supply and into the exhaust slots is in the seat-row direction, perpendicular to the aisle. The movement of air between seat rows is thus minimized in the ECS design concept.",

Air contaminants, such as small droplets from an exhaled breath or a cough, are transported by the fluctuations, even though the average of the fluctuations is zero. The ECS then creates two competing processes, one that is intended and another that is perhaps impossible to avoid-(1) removal of potentially contaminated cabin air into the exhaust and replacement with clean air and (2) movement of contaminants within cabin air by flow fluctuations. Fluctuations are present, even in the hypothetical absence of obstructions, moving bodies, and thermal plumes.",

Variables that must be normalized are emission rate of the contaminant source and air change rate of the cabin. The ratio of these two terms is, under steady-state conditions and perfect mixing, the contaminant concentration.

In the current study, the data were then normalized by dividing the measured concentration at a given seat location by this reference concentration: (2) where C AVE is the spatial average concentration over all measurement locations, and C S is the maximum concentration (occurring usually nearest to the source). Since the cabin air is not well-mixed, inclusion of C S helps to make C REF more representative of source strength.

Since CO 2 is much denser than air, negative plume buoyancy results in distorted results if these measures are not taken to ensure neutral buoyancy. Calculations and experimental results show that turbulent diffusion is several orders of magnitude greater that molecular diffusion, so the molecular diffusion is expected to be a negligible consideration in these experiments.

A measured amount of talcum powder was placed in a small cup. A small copper tube connected to a source of pressurized air was directed downward at the cup. The airflow was turned on and off very quickly by a solenoid valve to generate a very short but intense puff of air that aerosolized the talcum powder without generating any large airflow.

The slopes of the two lines and the breakpoint between them, r = 2.48 m, were both determined in the regression. Thus, a physicality-the near-zone/far-zone distinction-was identified by the statistical analysis. The freedom to adjust for this phenomenon increased the R 2 value from 0.476 to 0.502, which is only a small improvement. Here also, the analysis passed the normality test (P = 0.375) but failed the constant variance test. The near-source behavior is perhaps not well described by any kind of model based on the isotropic assumption. However, performing the regression on only the far-field data-greater than 2.48 m from the sourceactually lowered the R 2 value. The benefit of more data points was apparently greater than the cost of the increased variance.",

While the authors indicated typical contact follow-up zones as being the index patient's row, two rows in front and two rows behind, lap-help children, and the flight crew, they attempted follow-up in this investigation, additionally, with all passengers who shared a cabin or, for smaller planes, all passengers. They reported that no passengers in the comprehensive follow-up (86% of all passengers) showed evidence of rubella infection.

Without a passenger distance exposure metric, it is difficult to know where four rows on a short flight or seven rows on a long flight lie on the continuum of cabin exposures. Considering SARS, Table 2 shows that the infection rate had decreased by 90% at a distance of approximately eight rows. Even though SARS is a different pathogen, this model suggests that a rubella-susceptible individual on the longer flight could have become infected if seated significantly closer to the index patient. It may be worth considering that the index patient row distances of three, four, and five are beyond the customary contact follow-up distance while being closer to the index patient than the closest susceptible passenger (six rows) on the international flight in Kim et al.

While momentum does play a role, as seen in the improved fit if the row in front of the index passenger's row is considered the source row, the behavior is that when the particle stopping distance is reached, the smaller particles remain in the air to mix. Also, if fomites had been the only route, more of a step function drop off in cases would have been observed, since the likelihood of contacting contaminated surfaces drops off very rapidly outside of the source row.",

Still, it seems plausible that contaminant transport variability among commercial passenger aircraft types is not larger than differences in pathogen infectivity or individual susceptibility. Also, exposure duration affects whether an airborne exposure level leads to infection, and this variable was not addressed in the current study.",
