Design: Four hundred one of 1,278 SARS cases treated in Guangzhou China between December 2002 and June 2003 fulfilled the diagnostic criteria issued by the World Health Organization for confirmed identification of SARS. Among them, the diagnosis of critical SARS was defined by criteria of SARS guidelines incorporated with a low oxygenation index (OI) [< 300 mm Hg]. Data of these patients retrieved from a database were retrospectively analyzed by logistic regression and Cox regression for the effect of corticosteroid therapy on death, hospitalization days, and complication presentation. Results: Among the 401 SARS patients studied, 147 of 249 noncritical patients (59.0%) received corticosteroids (mean daily dose, 105.3 \u060e 86.1 mg) [\u060e SD], and all survived the disease; 121 of 152 critical patients (79.6%) received corticosteroids at a mean daily dose of 133.5 \u060e 102.3 mg, and 25 died.",

However, when focused on 152 critical SARS cases, factors correlated with these end points indicated by univariate analysis included use of corticosteroid, age, rigor at onset, secondary respiratory infections, pulmonary rales, grading of OI, and use of invasive ventilation. After adjustment for possible confounders, treatment with corticosteroid was shown contributing to lower overall mortality, instant mortality, and shorter hospitalization stay (p < 0.05). Incidence of complications was significantly associated with the need for invasive ventilation but not with use of corticosteroids. Conclusion: This Guangzhou retrospective study revealed that proper use of corticosteroid in confirmed critical SARS resulted in lowered mortality and shorter hospitalization stay, and was not associated with significant secondary lower respiratory infection and other complications.",

Glucocorticosteroid administration for acute lung injury (ALI) or ARDS arising from critical SARS remains controversial, as does for ALI or ARDS arising from other etiologies. Many studies have looked into the use of corticosteroids in SARS management in terms of efficacy, duration, dose, and severe adverse events; however, further investigations are needed to characterize the treatment efficacy and safety profiles of steroids in this condition. 3 Some authors 4 -6 implied that large-dose steroids were indicated during the early phase once a diagnosis was made, to prevent further deterioration, while some others [7] [8] [9] thought that large-dose therapy was not advisable although steroids could help. Open clinical trials 6,9 -14 also demonstrated that pulse steroid therapy could reduce mortality without associating an increased rate of life-threatening complications. Unfortunately, all of these studies are selfcontrolling based; therefore, they are not convincing due to lack of control groups in study design, as the natural history and progression of SARS were yet unclear at time of study.",

We defined the rescue use of corticosteroid as the sudden increase of dosage after 3 weeks from the onset and 3 days before the patients died. In this way of calculation, we were able to include 87.3% of the total dosage of corticosteroid and avoid four cases of rescue use of corticosteroid with daily dosage from 1,000 to 2,000 mg of methylprednisolone. Methylprednisolone was the major steroid used in most of the patients, while a small percentage were treated with hydroprednisone or dexamethasone, the doses of which were converted into methylprednisolone equivalents by 25 mg of hydroprednisone/4 mg of methylprednisolone and 0.75 mg of dexamethasone/4 mg of methylprednisolone.",

Importantly, acute respiratory failure typically seen during the late phase of critical SARS, mainly presenting with dyspnea and hypoxia, meets the diagnostic criteria for ALI. For this reason, steroid therapy in critical SARS has become a focus of interest. After the report of clinical experience of expert panel 23 from Guangzhou, there have been several reports on steroids therapy in critical SARS, and also no lack of controversy as to their outcomes and usage. Ho et al 6 compared 17 cases receiving high-dose pulse methylprednisolone therapy (ie, 500 mg/d for 5 to 7 consecutive days, then tapered to 20 mg/d over a total course of 21 days) with 55 cases receiving low-dose non-pulse corticosteroid (equivalent to approximately 2 to 3 mg/kg/d of methylprednisolone) therapy. It was reported that patients receiving high-dose pulse corticosteroid had less oxygen requirement, better radiographic outcome, and less likelihood of requiring subsequent highdose pulse corticosteroid therapy than their counterparts. There was no significant difference between the two groups in severe secondary infections. However, in the study by Ho et al, 6 there was no control (receiving no corticosteroid) group. 4 Zhao and colleagues 4 compared the clinical outcome of four treatment protocols in 190 cases of SARS. It was Table 4 for expansion of abbreviation. suggested that on the basis of antibiotics and antivirals (ribavirin and recombinant interferon-\u2423), early high-dosage steroids (160 to 1,000 mg/d of methylprednisolone) resulted in best outcomes and no death as compared with low-dose steroid therapy. However, this was not a randomized controlled study. Patients admitted in different periods received different treatment protocol, and major confounders affecting the outcome of SARS were not adjusted with multivariate analysis. The study by Meng et al 7 indicated that early administration of steroids was helpful for symptom relieving and pulmonary resolution. It was shown that low-dose methylprednisolone (40 to 80 mg/d) was associated with significantly shorter hospital days vs high-dose drug (320 to 640 mg/d). Sung et al 9 reported the outcome a stepwise treatment protocol of steroid administra-tion in the treatment of SARS in Hong Kong. The initial treatment was broad-spectrum antibiotics, a combination of ribavirin and low-dose corticosteroid. (Table 6 ). Table 4 for expansion of abbreviation.",

Data from Li et al 24 showed that high-dose steroids further deteriorated the low level of CD4 \u03e9 , CD8 \u03e9 , and CD3 \u03e9 , giving rise to severe secondary infections. Lee et al 25 reported the effect of steroid therapy on SARS-CoV load. Serial plasma SARS-CoV RNA concentrations were measured using a one-step real-time reverse transcriptase-PCR assay targeting the nucleocapsid gene. It was found that plasma SARS-CoV RNA concentrations in the second and third week of illness were significantly higher in patients who received initial hydrocortisone treatment (n \u03ed 9), as compared to those who received placebo (n \u03ed 7) [area under the curve; Mann-Whitney, p \u03ed 0.023]. An increase in the 30day mortality associated with high-dose steroids was also implicated by Tsang et al. 26 The variability of results from all the studies may lie in several reasons. First, some of the cases in the above-mentioned articles 20, 21 were of seronegative SARS-IgG, which were responsible for a bias due to overdiagnosis. In our study, only 401 of 1,278 registered cases in Guangzhou fulfilled the criteria of case identification instituted by World Health Organization. Second, the matching of SARS cases was not strictly controlled in these studies. As was shown in present study, noncritical SARS was not associated with mortality, but 59.0% of the patients received steroid therapy. Mixing the noncritical and critical SARS information together would interfere with the ability of statistical analysis to evaluate the effects of steroid on mortality. This might be the reason that steroid showed no efficacy on mortality in SARS patients as a whole but was significantly effective in critical (Table 7) . Cum \u03ed cumulative. SARS. Third, the adjustment of confounders was crucial in minimizing the effects of incomparability of baseline condition. In the present study, much more attention was paid to adjustment of baseline condition of important confounders. After adjusting the confounders with multivariate analysis, it was shown that proper use of steroid resulted in less fatality, lower instant mortality, and fewer hospital days.",

As the clinical manifestations and diagnosis criteria for critical SARS are largely identical to those of ALI, the only difference being that critical SARS is definitely caused by SARS-CoV infection, whereas ALI may result from a variety of etiology, including infective and noninfective. The mechanism of corticosteroid in critical SARS might share the similarity with ALI/ARDS. In ARDS, [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] excessive systemic inflammation has been documented, in which, nuclear factor-B may be responsible for glucosteroid resistance, leading to relative adrenal insufficiency and subsequently aggravation of ARDS. Replacement with exogenous methylprednisolone may relieve the symptoms by ameliorating systemic inflammation. 30 Therefore, current opinion holds that steroid therapy in ARDS should be given only on the basis of relative adrenal insufficiency induced by systemic inflammation and oriented to suppression of systemic inflammation. The duration of steroids depends on the length of inflammation. In a word, the proper guideline for steroid administration in ALI/ARDS include initializing appropriate doses of steroids at time of relative adrenal insufficiency, which was reflected in our study in terms of the steroid use. However, steroids should not be delayed until ARDS is fully developed. Advanced ARDS with apparently severe pathology will set back the efficacy of steroids.",

The early phase was characterized by systemic symptoms related to the effect of viral replication. As the disease progressed into the mid-phase, systemic inflammatory response syndrome became prominent, giving rise to systemic inflammatory response syndrome-induced lung injuries (ALI or ARDS) and many complications during the late phase. It was noted that the timing of the IgG seroconversion that started on day 10 seemed to correlate with falls in viral shedding from nasopharynx. Severe clinical worsening also occurred at this time, possibly related to immunopathologic damage. The presence of immunopathologic damage was confirmed by Jiang et al 34 in their study that interferon-inducible protein 10 (IP-10) was markedly elevated in the blood during the early stage of SARS, and remained at a high level until convalescence; moreover, IP-10 was highly expressed in both lung and lymphoid tissues, in which monocyte-macrophage infiltration and depletion of lymphocytes were observed. The clinical worsening during the midphase of SARS may be a result from the immunopathologic damage due to overexuberant host response, which can be reduced by steroids. In a recent study 35 on cytokine profile of SARS patients, marked elevation of T-helper type 1 cytokine interferon-\u2425 and inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1, (IL)-6, and (IL)-12 was showed for at least 2 weeks after disease onset. Corticosteroid reduced significantly IL-8, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, and IP-10 concentrations from days 5 to 8 after treatment, confirming the activation of Thelper type 1 cell-mediated immunity in SARS through the accumulation of monocytes/macrophages and neutrophils. In another study, 36 IL-10, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-\u2425 were higher than normal before treatment, and corticosteroid treatment resulted in fall in IL-10 but not in IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor-\u2425. These data suggested that steroid therapy showed advantages in reducing inflammatory response and protection from lung injury.",

In a cluster sampling survey of health-care workers from four hospitals in Guangzhou, Shen et al 37 found that the rate of AVN was 3.2% (4 of 124 cases), which was much lower than other reports 38 -40 in correlation with the maximal single-day dose of steroids. The low incidence of AVN in SARS cases in Guangzhou may be related to the comparatively low dose and short duration of steroid use in this region.",
