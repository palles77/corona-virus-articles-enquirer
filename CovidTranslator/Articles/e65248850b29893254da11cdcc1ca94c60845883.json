In this review, we first describe the state of the art of medical-laboratory tests that can be performed near the patient. At present, POCT ranges from basic blood-glucose measurement to complex viscoelastic coagulation assays. POCT shortens the time to clinical decision-making about additional testing or therapy, as delays are no longer caused by transport and preparation of clinical samples, and biochemical-test results are rapidly available at the point of care. Improved medical outcome and lower costs may ensue.",

In contrast to this centralization and increased efficiency in laboratory diagnostics, there has been a recent trend towards a more decentralized diagnostic analysis, so-called point-of-care testing (POCT), which occurs directly at patients\u00d5 beds, in operating theatres or outpatient clinics, or at sites of accidents. This modern variety of laboratory medicine is characterized by minimizing instrument size and procedures and the increasing use of current information technology. There are analytical devices available that make it possible to process a whole blood sample in a simple manner, allowing untrained staff to carry out laboratory diagnostics. It is clear that the use of POCT shortens the time between sample acquisition and analysis (turnaround time). However, this type of diagnosis is only useful if the results produced lead to immediate therapeutic decisions [1] . However, there is still a paucity of evidence supporting the use of POCT and improved patient outcomes [2] .",

All outpatient or ward personnel will be expected to be able to use these analyzers. No previous knowledge in sample analysis should be required. However, there is a continual transition between POCT and laboratory-based methods. A generally accepted definition of POCT is still under debate. For example, viscoelastic coagulation tests, described below in this article as ''Type 4'' POCT, are to be performed near the patient in cases of active bleeding. The results have to be available quickly to allow instant therapeutic action. However, the caregiver is mostly overstrained when operating the viscoelastic apparatus, so often these analyses are performed in a central laboratory with online transmission of the sensorgrams to the operating room; so these analyzers can be called ''pseudo-POCT''.",

According to the IUPAC definition, a biosensor is an analytical device for the detection of analytes that combines a biological component with a physicochemical-detector component. This generally occurs through the use of miniaturized analysis systems, where biological components are immobilized on a solid-state surface, which, in turn, interacts with the analyte [5] . These interactions may be detected by using either electrochemical or optical methods. In the latter case, a large role is played by fluorescence or reflection spectroscopy.

The biosensor as the basis of analysis in many point-of-care testing (POCT) instruments. Note that the recognition layer may comprise attached recognition elements (antibodies, receptors, aptamers . . .) or immobilized enzymes. In the latter case, the addition of substrates is essential. Not illustrated is the fact that the amplified signal is finally processed by microelectronics and displayed. glucometers for home and the hospital POCT stations, as well as the i-STAT Abbott (Abbott Park, IL, USA), a multi-parameter unit-use POCT instrument [7] . Blood-sugar analysis is, both historically and financially, the most commonly used POCT technique. This is valid for in-patient and out-patient care, and for home testing by patients. Although generally either capillary or venous blood is used, the results can be presented as blood-glucose or plasma-glucose level, depending on the calibration by the manufacturers. This can make a relevant difference of over 11%, potentially resulting in false therapeutic measures. To minimize the risk of confusion between whole-blood and plasma-glucose results, the International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine (IFCC) suggested in 2005 that glucose values should be given as plasma levels only, independent of sample type or measuring method. The USA and other countries have already followed this recommendation, and it is also now being implemented in the German-speaking regions [8, 9] .",

The system is a 1-16-site, random-access instrument, integrating real-time cycler, amplification and fluorescence detection. The use of multiple fluorescence dyes permits multiplex assays for detection of several targets within a single sample. The system provides PCR-test results from a raw clinical sample in about 1 h, enabling time-critical NAT at the point of need.

This allows them to attach on vascular injuries and artificial surfaces (e.g., the sensor wires). When the platelets aggregate on the Multiplate wires, they enhance the electrical resistance between them, which can be continuously recorded. In order to enhance the resistance on the sensor wires, tight attachment of the platelets is required.

Further-more, applications of POCT must be scientifically grounded, evidence based {e.g., via outcome analysis, which has only partly been the case to date [9] } and financially viable.

Tight surveillance of POCT data can show error trends before they affect the results. However, a prerequisite for this is comprehensive connectivity of all POCT systems used within a hospital-wide network. Newer POCT devices have data-storage functions that can collect key information at the time the test is performed and later transmit the result together with the internal quality-control data to a server-based POCT data manager software linked to the information system of the hospital.

The current western systems (e.g., structured around a large central hospital) are largely unsuitable; rather a decentralized health system offers the most effective means. In this case, a decentralized diagnostic process with POCT systems can play a very useful part. There have been a few successful movements in this direction (e.g., in reserves of the Australian aborigines) [44] . However, widespread use of the currently available systems is hindered by costs, complexity and unreliability under extreme conditions of heat or humidity. The parameters offered often do not meet those required in these situations. The American National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB) has therefore begun co-operation with India, the aim of which is to develop devices, which are suitable for use at the point of need [45] . The International Council for Standardization in Hematology (ICSH) is working on a set of guidelines, which will be applicable worldwide for POCT standardization in hematology and which can also be used in developing countries [46] . Specialized, novel rapid microbiological tests must be developed to recognize the common infective agents in these countries. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has sponsored research in this direction in order to establish a simple POCT application for AIDS patients. This so-called CD4 initiative should make it possible to count the CD4 positive T-lymphocytes in HIV-infected patients, with a view to better control of anti-retroviral therapy.",
