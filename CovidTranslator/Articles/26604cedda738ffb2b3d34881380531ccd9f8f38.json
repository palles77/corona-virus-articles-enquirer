The nasal fossae are divided by a dorsal concha (the extension of an endoturbinate), a curved shelf of bone originating from the ethmoidal crest. The dorsal concha (previously nasoturbinate) separates the dorsal cavity into the dorsal meatus and the middle meatus. Ventrally, the ventral nasal concha (previously maxilloturbinate) extends from the conchal crest and divides into several delicate bony scrolls. The concha divides the nasal cavity into the middle meatus and ventral meatus before forming the alar fold rostrally. Caudally, the ethmoturbinates extend from the midline ethmoidal plate to the cribriform plate; these ethmoid tubinates fill the presphenoid sinus and continue up into the frontal sinus. The ethmoturbinates can be divided into long, medially lying endoturbinates (usually seven in the cat) and smaller, more superficial ectoturbinates. The nasopharyngeal meatus is formed by the confluence of the caudal ends of the dorsal, middle, and ventral meatuses and runs to the choanae. The turbinates are covered by mucosa and act to direct the inspired air into the meatuses and humidify inspired air prior to passage to the lungs. They also act as a heat exchange mechanism and remove inhaled foreign material.",

Thus a careful diagnostic approach is essential, involving blood profiles (and ideally feline leukemia virus (FeLV)/feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) status), imaging (including rhinoscopy if available), and histology. It can be difficult to obtain a representative sample of tissue for biopsy unless a mass is directly visualized on rhinoscopy and thus a histopathology report of lymphoplasmacytic rhinitis in a cat with a rapid onset of progressive clinical signs warrants a repeat biopsy. It is also worth considering that in approximately 50% of cases of rhinitis in cats a diagnosis is not achieved after workup. In a retrospective study of 75 cats, the overall diagnostic yield was 36%. However, in 16 out of 23 cats that underwent nasal imaging, rhinoscopy and nasal biopsy, a specific etiological diagnosis was obtained, demonstrating that if nasal disease is to be investigated the investigation needs to be thorough. 2 ",

A complete radiographic examination of the nose would include a lateral and dorsoventral skull and a dorsoventral intra-oral view; the latter being the most useful view. The dorsoventral intra-oral view gives good detail of the nasal chonchae and septum but requires non-screen film and thus cannot be performed with digital radiography. If digital radiography is being used, a ventro 30\u00b0 rostral-dorsocaudal view can be used. In cases with suspected sinus involvement, though the lateral view is useful, a rostrocaudal sky-line or ventral 10\u00b0 ventro-caudodorsal oblique sinus view is helpful, although in some cats, particularly brachycephalic breeds, this can be a very difficult view to achieve and perfect. Radiographic abnormalities include soft tissue opacity, loss of turbinate detail, lucent foci, displacement of midline structures, soft tissue opacity of the frontal sinus, and facial deformity. Unfortunately most of these changes can be seen in both rhinitis and neoplastic disease. In one study of 64 cats, rhinitis was more frequently associated with a normal radiographic appearance while neoplasia more frequently caused displacement of midline structures, unilateral soft tissue opacity, unilateral loss of turbinate detail, and evidence of bone invasion. 3 There was, however, considerable overlap between the two groups although none of the cats in the neoplastic group had normal radiographic changes. Computed tomography (CT) is better at localizing and determining the extent of nasal disease compared to radiography, but there is no difference in sensitivity of detection of the presence of nasal disease. 4",

Anterior rhinoscopy is then performed with a 2.7 mm or 0.9 mm diameter (for smaller cats) forward-viewing rigid endoscope (for details on equipment and technique, see Chapter 9). Isotonic fluid can be used during rhinoscopy to flush away blood contamination and aid hemostasis.

Cytologic analysis will often yield a cell population suggestive of neutrophilic or suppurative rhinitis, indicating that chronic changes are not easily detected via cytology. 8 Even with biopsy and histology, incorrect | 54 | cats with suspicious nasal lesions should have the other predilection sites inspected, such as the pinnae and eyelids. The typical history is one of a 'scratch' or superficial crusting lesion that fails to heal in an older cat. The tumors have often been present for weeks/months before veterinary advice is sought. In cats, the lesion usually originates from the external cornified part of the nasal planum ( Fig. 54-5 ). Initial staging for nasal planum tumors consists of radiography of the skull and inflated thorax. For more extensive lesions, MRI or computed tomography (CT) are useful for surgical planning.

Cryptococcocis can be diagnosed using an immunoassay for the crytococcal polysaccharide capsular antigen (CALAS), cytologic examination, histopathology, or culture. Treatment of local disease is usually successful using azole anti-fungal drugs. 27 In cases of aspergillosis, brachycephalic Persians and Himalayans are the most common breeds reported. This is the opposite of the canine cases that tend to be dolichocephalic breeds. There is no typical age group that is affected. Orbital involvement occurs in about onethird of cases with signs including exophthalmos, epiphora, anterior uveitis, resistance to retropulsion, and prolapse of the nictitating membrane. 24 Diagnosis is by imaging, rhinoscopy, and biopsy samples that are submitted for culture and histopathology ( Fig. 54-8 ).
