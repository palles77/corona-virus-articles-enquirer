Although it is relatively straightforward to study the effects of interventions on the physical risks associated with ageing, studying effects on cognitive function is more difficult. Age related cognitive impairment affects about 5% of people over 65 in the developed world, and about half of those affected have memory loss. 1 In this week's BMJ, Kang and colleagues assess the impact of aspirin on cognitive function in a subgroup of elderly women enrolled in the women's health study 2 -a randomised controlled trial of the effect of aspirin on cardiovascular morbidity and cancer.",

Drugs for dementia produce transient symptomatic improvements by enhancing cholinergic neurotransmission but they do not delay progress to severe dementia. Molecular neurobiological and epidemiological studies suggest several interventions (such the possible neuroprotective effects of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs 3 ) that may slow cognitive decline and postpone the onset of dementia. Many of these population based studies identify risk factors for vascular disease as targets for preventing dementia. These studies also highlight the fact that complex research designs are necessary to take account of confounding by the differential effects of survival and the contribution of lifelong habits associated with retention of good health. Persisting uncertainty about the timing and nature of the prodromal phase of dementia remains an important obstacle to assessing the efficacy of interventions. Including participants in trials who are not at increased risk of cognitive decline will reduce the likelihood of detecting efficacy.",

            "text": "So far, results have been encouraging. Treatment of hypertension is beneficial in older people, with well established cognitive benefits, possibly including reduced risk of transition to dementia. 4 Evidence is strengthening in support of folic acid supplementation to reduce hyperhomocysteinaemia (a putative vascular risk factor), which in turn improves cognition, 5 although it is unclear whether supplementation will prevent dementia. The case for antioxidant vitamin supplements remains weak, because although some reduction in the incidence of dementia seems plausible, good quality trials are lacking. Likewise, marine oil supplementation has not been adequately tested. 6 A case therefore exists for reducing vascular risk factors to maintain cognitive function. The preventive role of different drug groups with contrasting actions on the cascades of molecular events that lead to vascular disease also needs to be investigated. Aspirin has a 30 year track record as a candidate for overall reduction of cardiovascular risk. The women's health study offered a golden opportunity to examine its potential to delay cognitive decline. The study by Kang and colleagues 1 found no significant difference in cognitive function at any of the three assessments (the first one on average 5.6 years after randomisation) administered every two years. The mean difference in decline in the global score from the first to the final cognitive assessment was 0.01 (95% confidence interval \u22120.02 to 0.04). The study recruited healthy women over 45 and achieved high follow-up rates. Efforts were made to control for confounders (smoking, alcohol, exercise, body mass index, blood pressure, diabetes, and incident depressive and vascular disease). High completion rates of repeated cognitive assessment using telephone administered tests with prespecified \"real world\" outcome measures in a large well powered study allow conclusions to be drawn about the lack of effect of aspirin on cognition in this population.",

This may seem reasonable when memory impairment is a core concept in research into dementia. However, there is a contrary view that the prodrome of Alzheimer's disease (the most common form of dementia) extends beyond memory loss to include deficits in executive functions, mental speed, 7 and attention, 8 and that visuospatial learning may also be important. These reports, with others, lead to the proposition that the early signs of dementia arise not from selective damage to key anatomical (\"bottleneck\") structures crucial for verbal memory, but from pathology that breaks connections between brain structures serving several cognitive domains. 9 In these terms, impairment of verbal memory alone is not the best early indicator of the dementia prodrome-deficits in attention and executive function are better predictors. Some eDITORIALs support for this \"disconnection hypothesis\" is derived from the study's finding of impairments on \"category fluency,\" a seemingly explicit task of memory requiring the naming of as many animals as possible in one minute. While interpretation of this test is complex-involving effortful retrieval, loss of knowledge, and both directed and sustained attention 10 -its potential importance as a marker of frontal or executive integrity should not be overlooked if premature conclusions on aspirin are to be avoided.",

Ultimately, once multiple risk factors are identified, common pathways to the onset and prevention of Alzheimer's disease will be charted. 11 As this is achieved, measurements and study designs will need to move away from categorical approaches, and assess the confounding effects of ill health in old age and to place people in their correct social context in terms of dependency and lifelong cognitive abilities. The US health and retirement study design is informative about many of these issues. 12 Ongoing developments into the sources of individual differences in cognitive ageing acting across the life course 13 will provide some solutions to these taxing methodological problems. Some bereaved people develop severe long term reactions to their loss. This kind of reaction may be associated with adverse health outcomes and has recently been termed \"complicated grief.\" 1 The syndrome is more common after unexpected and violent deaths such as suicide. 2 3 People bereaved by suicide are also more likely than those bereaved by other deaths to experience stigmatisation, shame, guilt, and a sense of rejection. 4 People going through normal or uncomplicated grief reactions after a death usually do not need or benefit from specific interventions other than support-indeed these may be contraindicated. 5 The potentially severe implications for people who develop complicated grief suggest, however, that special treatment may be indicated.

            "text": "This study highlights the question of how complicated grief differs from normal grief, and other possible bereavement outcomes, and how clinicians-especially in primary care-should best manage people at risk. A syndrome of complicated grief has been proposed for inclusion in the fifth version of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders of the American Psychiatric Association. 1 In contrast to uncomplicated grief, people with complicated grief seem to be in a state of chronic mourning. The proposed criteria require that the bereaved person has persistent and disruptive yearning, pining, and longing for the deceased. The criteria include four out of eight symptoms that must be experienced frequently or to a severely distressing and disruptive degree (or both). The eight symptoms are trouble accepting the death, inability to trust others since the death, excessive bitterness related to the death, uneasiness about moving on with life, detachment from other people to whom the person was previously close, the feeling that life is now meaningless, the view that the future holds no prospect for fulfilment, and agitation since the death. Importantly, to fulfil the diagnosis these symptoms must have persisted for at least six months. They must also have resulted in considerable impairment in social, occupational, and other major areas of functioning. 1 Complicated grief may be associated with increased risk of cancer, hypertension, cardiac events, and suicidal ideation, 1 plus adverse health behaviours such as increased smoking and alcohol misuse. 7 Although complicated grief is associated with an increased risk of depressive disorders, it is clearly distinguished from depression. 8 Detection of people at risk is important. Sudden unexpected deaths appear to be associated with greater risk. Risk is also increased if the relationship with the deceased person was a dependent one. Other factors include early family experiences that may have undermined the person's sense of security-such as abuse and neglect or separation anxiety-and lack of a supportive network. 1 Practitioners may therefore be able to identify some people at risk. However, given the usual limitations of using risk factors for determining prognosis, monitoring the bereaved through occasional brief contact will also be important, especially as people who develop complicated grief may be reluctant to seek help from clinicians. 1 This will also provide opportunity for giving support. For people bereaved by suicide, self help can be encouraged through recommended reading material. 9 But what can be done to help people at risk, or those identified with a complicated grief reaction? The results of the trial by de Groot and colleagues indicate that specific interventions at an early stage may be helpful for people at risk who have experienced a sudden loss. The brevity of the intervention (four sessions) makes it attractive, although replication and improved results of such an intervention would increase confidence in recommending it. Once complicated grief has been identified, a more intensive approach designed to treat the condition seems to be effective, especially for people who have experienced a sudden violent loss. 10 Provision of cognitive behaviour therapy through an interactive internet based programme has also had impressive results. 11 Development of more resources to manage complicated grief is clearly required, together with further evaluations. However, current evidence indicates that not only is complicated grief a serious adverse outcome of bereavement, but that it may be dealt with effectively through carefully designed interventions. Socioeconomic differences in health have been described since the 16th and 17th centuries, 1 2 but only recently has reducing them been central to public health policy in many Western countries. 3 Over the past three decades, epidemiological studies have confirmed the existence of socioeconomic inequalities in a range of health outcomes, including premature mortality, cardiovascular disease, obesity, diabetes, self reported ill health, and smoking related cancers, and have explored potential mechanisms linking lower socioeconomic position to poorer health. 4 The Whitehall cohort studies have made important contributions to this literature. 5 Several studies, 6-9 including a publication from Whitehall II, 10 have found that poorer socioeconomic position is associated with worse morbidity, mortality, and self reported health in older people. In this week's BMJ, a new analysis of data from Whitehall II by Chandola and colleagues examines the extent to which socioeco-nomic inequalities in self reported physical and mental health continue into older age. 11 The paper adds to the literature by using repeated measures of socioeconomic position and self reported health, both of which may change with age. The paper demonstrates one of the strengths of prospective cohort studies-the ability to examine changing relations between health related characteristics over time.",

But their repeated measurements and detailed analyses allow other inequalities to be explored. Figure 2 in their paper shows the trajectories of health change with age by occupational grade for the final phase (2002-4) of the study. However, the authors do not highlight that the interactions of age with time period included in their statistical model suggest that these trajectories changed over time. We calculated the trajectories of physical and mental health for each time period that the study covered using data from the full results of model I, presented in the appendix to the paper (figs 1 and 2). 11 We found that in the first period (1991-3) physical health did not decline with increasing age, and during the rest of the 1990s the decline in self reported physical health with age was much less pronounced than that seen since 2000 (fig 1) . With respect to self reported mental health, in the early 1990s the increase with age was more noticeably linear-continuing to increase into later older age-than in more recent years, where at older age the improvement in mental health flattens off (fig 2) . The differing impressions given by trajectories in the different periods are a reminder of how difficult it can be to summarise the results of complex statistical models in a transparent way.",

The assumptions concur with WHO advice, again an area neglected in many national strategic plans and something likely to result in problems for international coordination and cooperation. 4 5 In their February 2007 report on the status of European Union preparedness for pandemic flu, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) highlighted several neglected areas. 6 One of these was making plans operational at local level, which is a profound challenge for all countries.

If it can, then preplanning is crucial-and these documents highlight the amount of planning needed at the local level. The UK's operational plans remain under development. A checklist for how the arms of the health system relate to health care in a community setting offers a useful way forward. However, this tells organisations only what needs to be done-not how to do it-and similar checklists are not available for all stakeholder organisations.

Among these is preparedness, \"all organisations and individuals that might have a role to play in emergency response and recovery should be properly prepared and be clear about their roles and responsibilities.\" 9 10 Ultimately, it will be a remarkable achievement if devolved operational authority is successful.

Yet timely and reliable information to help implement and monitor public health policies like smoking cessation is not always easy to find. Public health information exists in many forms in disparate locations. The UK government recognises the lack of a comprehensive collection of information for public health, and attempts are being made to rectify this. 3 Data, evidence, and narrative information form the three main types of public health information. Data-which is quantitative-usually describes a health service by its inputs (such as financial), outputs (such as hospital activity), and outcomes (such as survival rates). When displayed as trends over time or comparisons between places such data can be powerful. Secondly we have evidence, which comes from published research.
