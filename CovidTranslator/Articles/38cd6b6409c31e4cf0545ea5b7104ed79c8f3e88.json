Among a cohort of 741 symptomatic patients tested since 2003, the virus was diagnosed in six adults using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Of the six, two were from the community, two were hospital inpatients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and two were immunocompromised patients, both of whom required ventilation and later died. This report discusses the clinical features, epidemiology and diagnosis of hMPV, highlighting that this infection may be associated with death in high-risk adults. For adults presenting with respiratory symptoms and a background of pre-existing respiratory disease or who are immunocompromised, nucleic acid-based techniques are a cost-effective means of making the viral diagnosis in a clinically relevant time frame.",

            "text": "Acute respiratory tract infections are a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, and they account for a high percentage of hospital admissions. However, up to 50% of cases of community-acquired pneumonia in adults and 15-35% of cases of bronchiolitis and pneumonia in children are of uncertain aetiology [1] [2] [3] . It is clear that respiratory viruses are the principal pathogens in a proportion of such cases [4] . hMPV is a recently described respiratory pathogen of the subfamily Pneumovirinae, which is divided into the Pneumovirus genus, containing respiratory syncytial virus, and the Metapneumovirus genus, containing hMPV. In young children and elderly patients hMPV is most commonly associated with a clinical diagnosis of bronchiolitis or bronchitis, respectively, whereas in middle-aged adults, it may produce an influenza-like illness, which can be complicated by pneumonitis in the presence of immunocompromising factors [5] . hMPV has been detected as the sole pathogen in the nasopharyngeal aspirate of a haematopoietic stem cell transplant recipient who subsequently died of respiratory failure following an upper respiratory prodrome [6] .",

Both had been smokers, had received prednisolone as inpatients, and were discharged on maintenance oral steroids.

The fatalities occurred in individuals receiving immunosuppressive therapy for rheumatological conditions. Case 5 had rheumatoid arthritis for which she received prednisolone and methotrexate. She presented in a collapsed and unresponsive condition following a 1-week history of cough, nausea and increasing dyspnoea.
