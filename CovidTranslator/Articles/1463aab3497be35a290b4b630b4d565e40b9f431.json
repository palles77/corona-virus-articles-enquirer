The coding regions of the chicken and turkey genes are highly conserved, with IL-10 and IL-13 exhibiting 94.1% and 90% nucleotide and 92% and 79.9% amino acid identity respectively. Both showed consistent mRNA expression in turkey lymphoid and gut tissues. Expression in non-lymphoid tissues was more variable but generally highest in the skin and trachea. Recombinant turkey IL-10 was expressed and bioactivity demonstrated by inhibition of IFN-\u2425 synthesis from activated splenocytes. Chicken and turkey IL-10 cross-reacted in functional assays.",

            "text": "The immune system of the chicken has been characterised to a far greater extent than that of the turkey, primarily due to its greater economic status and stimulating more research interest. However, the increasing consumption of poultry meat other than chicken is driving a concomitant increase in the economic importance of other poultry species, including turkeys. There is a subsequent need for improved vaccination strategies, and therefore a greater understanding of the immune systems of these species (Kaiser, 2010; Meyerhoff et al., 2012; Schultz and Magor, 2008) . The release of the chicken genome sequence (International Chicken Genome Sequencing Consortium, 2004) revolutionised our under-standing of the repertoire and biology of immune-related molecules, including cytokines and chemokines, resulting in a large and expanding chicken immunological \"toolbox\" of reagents Kaiser, 2007 Kaiser, , 2010 Kaiser and St\u00e4heli, 2008) . The availability of genome sequences for other avian species, including the zebrafinch (Warren et al., 2010) , the turkey (Dalloul et al., 2010) and the duck (http://pre.ensembl.org/Anas platyrhyncos/Info/), should allow identification and subsequent characterisation of their immune gene repertoires. Dalloul et al. (2010) catalogued the majority of the turkey immune gene repertoire, which unsurprisingly is very similar to that of the chicken. However, only five cytokines have been biologically characterised in the turkey: type I IFN (Suresh et al., 1995) , IFN-\u2425 (Lawson et al., 2001; Loa et al., 2001) , IL-1\u2424 (Wu et al., 2007) , IL-2 (Lawson et al., 2000) , and IL-18 (Kaiser, 2002) , and a single chemokine, IL-8 (also known as CXCLi2) (Wu et al., 2008) . A partial sequence for turkey IL-12\u2424 had also been identified pre-genome (Balu and Kaiser, 2003) . All of these share high nucleotide (nt) and amino acid (aa) identities with their chicken orthologues. Only three (IFN-\u2425, IL-2 and CXCLi2) have been tested for cross-reactivity. All three cytokines cross-reacted, somewhat surprisingly in the case of IL-2 as chicken and turkey IL-2 share only 69.9% aa identity (Lawson et al., 2000 (Lawson et al., , 2001 Wu et al., 2008) . This leads to the hypothesis that other chicken and turkey cytokines would also show cross-reactivity. In addition, Powell et al. (2009a) identified and cloned three turkey T cell surface markers and demonstrated cross-reactivity of monoclonal antibodies recognising chicken CD8\u2423 and CD28 with the respective turkey orthologues.",

It was cloned in the chicken through genomic analysis based on the conservation of synteny with the rest of the Th2 cytokine gene cluster (Avery et al., 2004) . We and others have shown that during infection with extracellular pathogens, chicken IL-13 is induced to far greater levels than chicken IL-4 (Degen et al., 2005; Powell et al., 2009b; Schwarz et al., 2011) , the canonical Th2 cytokine in man and mouse.

            "text": "Our attempts to clone and sequence turkey IL-4 failed (data not shown), but turkey IL-13 cDNA was amplified from turkey RNA by RT-PCR using primers designed to chicken IL-13. The coding sequence of 420 nt from start to stop codon was identified (Fig. 4) , which included the insertion of an additional serine residue, at position 27 (CCA at 80-82 bp), compared to the chicken sequence. Sequence identity between turkey IL-13 and human IL-13 is 49.6% and 15.0% at the nt and aa levels, respectively, with similar levels of identity between turkey and murine IL-13. Mammalian and avian IL-13 each has five cysteine residues, four of which are conserved in location. Identity between chicken and turkey IL-13 is high, with 90.0% and 79.9% identity at the nt and aa levels, respectively. Amino acid changes show evidence of some clustering, with seven aa changes from positions 24 to 31, which is the region directly following the predicted cleavage site for processing of the signal peptide of mammalian IL-13. Five aa changes occur between positions 39 and 47 which lie within helix A of human IL-13 and four changes between positions 80 and 84, three of which lie within helix B of human IL-13. Five aa changes between positions 102 and 107 lie between helix C and the second \u2424-sheet (Avery et al., 2004) . Since the exon boundaries are consistent between species (http://www.ensembl.org/Meleagris gallopavo/), this shows that a high proportion of replacements occurs in exons 1, 3 and 4. All of the cysteine residues in IL-13 are conserved between the chicken and turkey. With the relatively high level of aa identity and the conservation of cysteine residues, we could speculate that the biological activities exhibited by chicken IL-13 are conserved between the two avian species, and that turkey and chicken IL-13 will cross-react. The sequence was submitted to Ensembl with the Acc. No. AM493431.",

In addition to the immune response of turkeys to foot pad dermatitis (Mayne et al., 2007) and histomonosis (Powell et al., 2009b) , it would be interesting to investigate the immune response to other commercially important turkey pathogens, including turkey rhinotracheitis, an avian pneumovirus which causes up to 30% mortality (10-100% morbidity), avian flu, coccidia and bacteria (including Salmonella, Campylobacter and Escherichia coli). Also of interest are re-emerging turkey diseases, such as Bluecomb disease, caused by a turkey coronavirus, and Poult enteritis mortality syndrome, an emerging disease whose etiology remains unclear. The reagents developed during this study will aid these efforts.",
