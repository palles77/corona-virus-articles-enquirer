Likewise, many viruses that replicate in the cytoplasm of eukaryotes have evolved 2\u2032-O-methyltransferases to autonomously modify their mRNAs. However, a defined biological role for 2\u2032-O-methylation of mRNA remains elusive. Here we show that 2\u2032-O-methylation of viral mRNA was critically involved in subverting the induction of type I interferon. We demonstrate that human and mouse coronavirus mutants lacking 2\u2032-O-methyltransferase activity induced higher expression of type I interferon and were highly sensitive to type I interferon.",

For cytoplasmic viral RNA, this involves detection by cytoplasmic RIG-I-like receptors, such as RIG-I and Mda5, and the initiation of signaling cascades that induce the expression of cytokines, including type I interferon. Interferon-\u03b1 (IFN-\u03b1) and IFN-\u03b2 are secreted and signal through the type I interferon receptor (IFNAR) to transmit a danger signal to neighboring cells. The activated IFNAR triggers a signaling pathway consisting of the kinase Jak and STAT transcription factors, inducing the expression of a large array of interferonstimulated genes encoding molecules with antiviral activity, thus establishing the so-called 'host cell antiviral state' 2-4 . These interferon-stimulated genes include those encoding the protein kinase PKR, as well as stress-inducible proteins such as IFIT1 and IFIT2 (also known as ISG56 and ISG54, respectively), which impair the host cell protein synthesis apparatus 4-7 . Although the distinction between self and non-self RNA is believed to rely on the molecular signatures found in pathogen-associated molecular patterns, the exact nature of such signatures remains elusive. Both cytosolic RIG-I-like receptors (RIG-I and Mda5) bind to double-stranded RNA (dsRNA); however, RIG-I seems to 'prefer' short dsRNA, whereas Mda5 can specifically bind long dsRNA 8 .",

In contrast, eukaryotic mRNA, which is not recognized by RIG-I or Mda5, usually has a 5\u2032 cap structure methylated at the N7 position of the capping guanosine residue (cap 0), the ribose-2\u2032-O position of the 5\u2032-penultimate residue (cap 1) and sometimes at adjoining residues (cap 2) 12 . Two evolutionary forces are thought to be responsible for the presence of 5\u2032 cap structures on eukaryotic mRNA: the appearance of 5\u2032 exonucleases in eukaryotes and the need for a means of directing mRNA to the eukaryotic ribosome 13 . Thus, eukaryotic mRNA 5\u2032 cap structures are known to increase mRNA stability and translational efficacy. Notably, although N7 methylation is important in many mRNA-related processes, such as transcriptional elongation, polyadenylation, splicing, nuclear export and efficient translation, there is no obvious reason for the evolution of 2\u2032-O-methylation of mRNA ribose in cap 1 and cap 2 structures in higher eukaryotes.",

The fact that RNA 5\u2032-triphosphate groups activate RIG-I (refs. 9,10) suggests that viruses must hide or modify their RNA 5\u2032 structures to evade innate immune recognition. In addition, RIG-I activation is diminished when 5\u2032-triphosphate RNA contains modified nucleotides 9 . Thus, RNA modifications such as methylation could be critical factors for the activation of RNA-specific pattern-recognition receptors. Notably, this idea of methylation-based distinction of self and non-self nucleic acids is well established for DNA, as the methylation status of CpG dinucleotide motifs in DNA is the structural basis of the activation of Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) 15 . Moreover, DNA methylation represents the basis for the ancient bacterial restriction and modification systems that allow bacteria to distinguish between foreign DNA and the bacterial genome.",

We demonstrate that human and mouse coronavirus mutants lacking 2\u2032-O-methyltransferase activity induced higher expression of type I interferon and were extremely sensitive to type I interferon treatment. Furthermore, a mouse coronavirus mutant with an inactivated 2\u2032-Omethyltransferase was attenuated in wild-type macrophages but replicated efficiently in the absence of IFNAR or Mda5. The coronavirus 2\u2032-O-methyltransferase mutants were apathogenic in wild-type mice; however, viral replication and spreading was restored in mice lacking IFNAR and in mice lacking TLR7 and Mda5, the two main sensors of coronavirus RNA. Collectively our results show a link between Mda5mediated sensing of viral RNA and 2\u2032-O-methylation of mRNA and suggest that RNA modifications such as 2\u2032-O-methylation provide a molecular signature for the distinction of self and non-self mRNA.",

We produced this mutant by substituting alanine for the aspartic acid at position 129 of the highly conserved catalytic KDKE tetrad of nsp16 (HCoV-D129A; Fig. 1b) .

The mutant virus had a small plaque phenotype and less replication in the human fibroblast MRC-5 cell line (Fig. 2a,b) . The transfer of 3 H-labeled methyl groups from the methyl donor S-adenosyl-methionine to mRNA was less efficient for mRNA derived from MHV-Y15A-infected cells than for mRNA from MHV-D130Ainfected cells but significantly more efficient than for mRNA from MHV-A59-infected cells (Fig. 3a) .

Also, there was no notable difference among cells infected with MHV-A59, MHV-D130A or MHV-Y15A in the formation and morphology of double-membraned vesicles in the cytoplasm, as observed by electron microscopy (Supplementary Fig. 1) . That observation is relevant to the cytoplasmic sensing of viral RNA, as coronavirus double-membraned vesicles are known to contain dsRNA. Infection with either of the 2\u2032-O-methyltransferase mutants (MHV-Y15A or MHV-D130A) resulted in more production of type I interferon in wild-type macrophages at 15 h after infection ( Fig. 3c and Supplementary Fig. 2a) . Likewise, type I interferon was efficiently produced in IFNAR-deficient macrophages infected with MHV-D130A or MHV-Y15A ( Fig. 3d and Supplementary Fig. 2b) , which indicated that the MHV 2\u2032-O-methyltransferase mutants triggered the production of type I interferon in the absence of IFNAR signaling. Neither MHV-A59 nor the two 2\u2032-O-methyltransferase mutant viruses induced any detectable expression of type I interferon in Mda5-deficient macrophages (Fig. 3e) , whereas the production of type I interferon was readily detectable in Mda5-deficient cells after infection with Sendai virus. Detailed analysis of the kinetics of IFN-\u03b2 mRNA expression showed that infection of wild-type macrophages (Fig. 3f) and IFNAR-deficient macrophages (Fig. 3g) with MHV-D130A or MHV-Y15A resulted in higher expression of the gene encoding IFN-\u03b2 (with a peak at 12 h after infection) than did MHV-A59 infection. Notably, the induction of IFN-\u03b2 was greatest after infection with MHV-D130A, which has a mutant 2\u2032-O-methyltransferase active site. These results indicate that deficiency in 2\u2032-O-methylation in viral RNA induces higher IFN-\u03b2 expression and that IFN-\u03b2 induction after infection with viruses with mutant 2\u2032-O-methyltransferases is Mda5 dependent.",

We investigated the viral replication kinetics of MHV-D130A and MHV-Y15A in primary macrophages, which represent the most important target cells for MHV 22, 27 . MHV-D130A replication was considerably impaired in wild-type macrophages (even after infection at a high MOI of 1), whereas the replication of MHV-Y15A was similar to that of MHV-A59 (Fig. 5a) . MHV-D130A replication was fully restored in Mda5-deficient macrophages, even after infection at a low MOI of 0.0001 (Fig. 5b) . This demonstrates that Mda5-dependent expression of type I interferon is a prerequisite for the induction of effective restriction of MHV-D130A replication. In agreement with the idea that MHV-D130A replication was impaired in wild-type macrophages, but MHV-Y15A replication was not, we observed much less replication of MHV-D130A in macrophages pretreated with IFN-\u03b1. Thus, in contrast to MHV-A59, MHV-D130A was not detectable at 24 h after infection after 4 h of pretreatment of wild-type macrophages with 50-200 units of IFN-\u03b1, whereas MHV-Y15A replication was not restricted much (Fig. 5c) . In Mda5-deficient macrophages, pretreatment with at least 200 units of IFN-\u03b1 was needed to restrict MHV-D130A replication to undetectable amounts (Fig. 5d) , which suggested that endogenous expression of type I interferon mediated by Mda5 affected the MHV-D130A restriction in wild-type macrophages. These data indicate that the D130A and Y15A substitutions of MHV nsp16 had different effects on the induction of type I interferon and viral replication. The D130A substitution led to more production of type I interferon as well as to considerable sensitivity to pretreatment with type I interferon.",

Thus, we conclude that in addition to triggering Mda5-dependent induction of type I interferon, loss of 2\u2032-O-methylation triggers a second antiviral mechanism that is induced by type I interferon and accounts for the restriction of viral replication during the host cell antiviral state. The replication of a mutant of West Nile virus (family Flaviviridae; genus Flavivirus) lacking 2\u2032-O-methylation is considerably inhibited by members of the IFIT family 28 , which are encoded by interferonstimulated genes linked to translational regulation. To assess whether this molecular mechanism is also relevant to coronavirus infection, we analyzed the replication kinetics of MHV-A59, MHV-D130A and MHV-Y15A in primary macrophages derived from wild-type or IFIT1-deficient mice. MHV-D130A replication was almost completely restored in IFIT1-deficient macrophages (Fig. 6) , analogous to the restoration of MHV-D130A replication in Mda5-deficient macrophages (Fig. 5a,b) . These results suggest that the Mda5-dependent induction of type I interferon and the IFIT-1-mediated restriction of viral replication are two distinct antiviral mechanisms based on the distinction between 2\u2032-O-methylated mRNA and nonmethylated mRNA.",

In contrast to MHV-A59, neither of the MHV 2\u2032-O-methyltransferase mutants was detectable in spleen or liver of C57BL/6 mice at 48 h after infection, which demonstrated the importance of 2\u2032-O-methylation of viral mRNA for efficient replication and spread in the host. However, the two MHV 2\u2032-O-methyltransferase mutants replicated and spread in IFNARdeficient mice. MHV-D130A was not detectable in spleens or livers of mice lacking either Mda5 or TLR7, which suggested that induction of the expression of type I interferon via either RNA sensor suffices to completely restrict the replication and spread of mutants with altered 2\u2032-O-methyltransferase active sites. However, we were able to detect small amounts of the cap 0-binding mutant MHV-Y15A in the spleens of TLR7-deficient or Mda5-deficient mice, which suggested that lower induction of type I interferon in these mutant mice did not fully restrict replication of the virus with partially impaired 2\u2032-O-methyltransferase. The replication and spread of the two MHV 2\u2032-O-methyltransferase mutants in mice deficient in both TLR7 and Mda5 was indistinguishable from that in IFNAR-deficient mice. These observations confirm that TLR7 and Mda5 represent the main sensors for recognition of coronavirus RNA and demonstrate that 2\u2032-Omethylation of viral mRNA serves as a mechanism by which viruses evade the recognition of non-self RNA by the host innate immune system in vivo.

            "text": "The correct functioning of host innate immune responses is based on reliable pathogen detection and is essential in limiting pathogen replication and spread. Using human and mouse coronavirus models of infection, we have shown here that 2\u2032-O-methylation of mRNA provides a molecular signature with a dual role in the interaction with host innate immune responses. First, 2\u2032-O-methylation of mRNA protects viral RNA from recognition by Mda5 and thus prevents Mda5-dependent production of type I interferon in virusinfected cells. Second, 2\u2032-O-methylation of viral mRNA contributes to evasion of the interferon-mediated restriction of viral replication. These distinct effects can be uncoupled either in the absence of type I interferon signaling (such as in IFNAR-deficient cells or mice) or through a genetic approach that targets the cap 0-binding residue Tyr15 of MHV nsp16. The lack of 2\u2032-O-methylation on a proportion of MHV-Y15A mRNA was sufficient to trigger the Mda5 pathway of the production of type I interferon while allowing the virus to evade the IFIT1-mediated restriction of viral replication. In contrast, the absence of 2\u2032-O-methylation on the MHV-D130A viral RNA activated the Mda5 pathway and resulted in restriction of viral propagation. Our study has described the effect of 2\u2032-O-methylation of mRNA on Mda5-dependent induction of type I interferon. The use of coronavirus greatly facilitated this analysis because coronaviruses encode their own 5\u2032 mRNA cap-methylation machinery, which allowed us to study the phenotype of recombinant viruses with mutant 2\u2032-O-methyltransferase proteins, and because expression of type I interferon is almost undetectable in infected cells other than plasmacytoid dendritic cells, with the notable exception of macrophages, which produce small amounts of Mda5-mediated type I interferon after infection [23] [24] [25] 29 . In contrast, most other RNA viruses that replicate in the cytoplasm induce considerable amounts of type I interferon, which may mask the specific effect of 2\u2032-O-methylation of mRNA on Mda5 activation 2,30 . It will be important to clarify whether viral mRNA lacking 2\u2032-O-methylation is directly recognized by Mda5, resulting in its activation, or whether 2\u2032-O-methylation represents an activation signal for Mda5, possibly in combination with dsRNA regions. The generation of recombinant viruses with defined substitutions in RNA-processing enzymes, combined with biochemical approaches, will thus be useful in the identification of naturally occurring Mda5 ligands.",

Other viruses, such as bunyaviruses and arenaviruses, that replicate in the cytoplasm but have not acquired the ability to autonomously generate and modify their 5\u2032 cap structures have evolved means for snatching the cap structure from cellular mRNA 31, 32 . Moreover, structural and functional analyses have shown that the cap-binding nucleoprotein of Lassa virus (family Arenaviridae) can antagonize type I interferon through its associated 3\u2032-to-5\u2032 exoribonuclease activity, probably by cleaving RNAs that function as pathogen-associated molecular patterns 33 . This protein has an unusually deep cap-binding pocket proposed to accommodate an entire cap 1 structure 33 and could potentially discriminate between 2\u2032-O-methylated and nonmethylated capped RNAs. Finally, members of the Picornavirales order and related viruses, which replicate in the cytoplasm but do not encode methyltransferases, have evolved alternative 5\u2032 ends of their RNA. These viruses covalently attach a small viral protein (VPg) to the genomic 5\u2032 terminus and have an internal ribosomal entry site at the 5\u2032 untranslated region 34 . The replication of encephalomyocarditis virus (family Picornaviridae) seems to be not restricted by IFIT proteins 28 ; however, infection with this virus is sensed through the Mda5 pathway 35 . Thus, we speculate that the use of internal ribosomal entry allows encephalomyocarditis virus to evade host restriction by IFIT family members, whereas the covalent attachment of VPg to the 5\u2032 end of picornavirus RNA does not prevent Mda5-dependent recognition and induction of type I interferon.",

Although most of those observations were made in vitro (for example, by transfection of short synthetic RNA), it seems that RNA modifications may affect sensing by the innate immune system on a wider scale 38 .

In contrast, in vitro 2\u2032-O-methylation of poly(A)-containing RNA derived from HCoV-229E-infected cells was indistinguishable from the 2\u2032-O-methylation of poly(A)-containing RNA obtained from mock-infected cells. We observed significantly higher IFN-\u03b2 expression in blood-derived human macrophages after infection with HCoV-D129A than after infection with HCoV-229E,(Fig. 2d)and complete restriction of HCoV-D129A replication in human macrophages pretreated with IFN-\u03b1(Fig. 2e). These results suggest a biological role for 2\u2032-O-methylation of mRNA in the context of the induction of type I interferon and antiviral effector mechanisms stimulated by type I interferon.Mda5-dependent induction of type I interferonTo extend our studies on the effect of 2\u2032-O-methylation on coronavirus-induced innate immune responses, we used an animal model of coronavirus infection with mouse hepatitis virus strain A59 (MHV-A59) as a natural mouse pathogen. Plasmacytoid dendritic cells have a unique and crucial role in sensing coronavirus RNA via TLR7 that ensures the swift production of type I interferon after viral encounter22,23 . Other target cells such as primary fibroblasts, neurons, astrocytes, hepatocytes and conventional dendritic cells do not have detectable production of type I interferon after infection with MHV23,24 . The exceptions to that are macrophages and microglia, which can respond with expression of type I interferon after MHV infection, although only to moderate amounts25,26 . The expression of type I interferon detected in macrophages and microglia is dependent on Mda5 (ref.25).Wegenerated a recombinant MHV lacking 2\u2032-O-methyltransferase activity by substituting alanine for the aspartic acid at the 2\u2032-Omethyltransferase active site at position 130 of nsp16 (MHV-The HCoV 2\u2032-O-methyltransferase mutant has altered replication kinetics and induction of and sensitivity to type I interferon.

Immunodeficient mice deficient in IFNAR, Mda5 or TLR7 or both Mda5 and TLR7 on the C57BL/6 background were bred in the animal facilities of the Kantonal Hospital St. Gallen. IFIT1-deficient mice were bred in the animal facilities of the Washington University School of Medicine. All mice were maintained in individually ventilated cages and were used between 6 and 9 weeks of age. All animal experiments were done in accordance with the Swiss Federal legislation and with approval from the animal studies committees of the Cantonal Veterinary Office (St. Gallen, Switzerland) andSt. Louis University. The HCoV-229E, HCoV-D129A, MHV strain A59, MHV-D130A and MHV-Y15A recombinant viruses were generated with a vaccinia virus-based reverse-genetic system as described 39 and were propagated on Huh-7 hepatocarcinoma cells (HCoV) or 17Cl1 mouse fibroblasts (MHV). BHK-21 baby hamster kidney cells, L929 mouse fibroblasts, NIH3T3 mouse fibroblasts, MRC-5 human fetal lung cells and CV-1 monkey kidney fibroblasts were from the European Collection of Cell Cultures. Huh-7 cells were a gift from V. Lohmann; D980R human epithelial cells were a gift from G.L. Smith; and 17Cl1 cells were a gift from S.G. Sawicki. All cells were maintained in minimal essential medium supplemented with 5-10% (vol/vol) FBS and antibiotics. Thioglycollate-elicited mouse macrophages were generated as described 40 . Human macrophages were isolated from peripheral blood of normal donors as described 41 . Experiments using human cells were in compliance with the Swiss federal legislation and institutional guidelines of the Kantonsspital St.Gallen (including informed consent) and were appoved by the ethical committee of Canton St. Gallen, Switzerland.Mice were injected intraperitoneally with 500 plaque-forming units of MHV. Organs were stored at \u221270 \u00b0C until further analysis. Human bloodderived macrophages and thioglycolate-elicited mouse macrophages (0.5 \u00d7 10 6 to 1 \u00d7 10 6 ) were infected at the appropriate MOI in a 24-well format. MHV titers were determined by standard plaque assay with L929 cells. HCoV titers were determined by plaque assay with Huh-7 cells overlaid at 1 h after infection with 1.2% (wt/vol) Avicel microcrystalline cellulose in 10% (vol/vol) DMEM and stained with crystal violet 3 d after infection. Immunofluorescence, IFN-\u03b2 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and IFN-\u03b1 pretreatment. IRF3 was detected in mouse macrophages (2 \u00d7 10 5 cells per well in 200 \u00b5l) 3 h after infection with MHV at an MOI of 1. Cells were stained with antibody to IRF3 (FL-425; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and with DAPI (4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole). Images were acquired with a DMRA microscope (Leica). The concentration of mouse and human IFN-\u03b2 in cell culture supernatants was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (PBL Biomedical Laboratories). Universal type I interferon (IFN-\u03b1 A/D; Sigma) was used for pretreatment of cells with IFN-\u03b1 before viral infection.",
