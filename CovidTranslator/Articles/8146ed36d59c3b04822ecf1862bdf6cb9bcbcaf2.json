Structural and biochemical studies have revealed that all confirmed 3CLpro cleavage sites have a conserved Gln residue at the P1 position, which is thought to be absolutely required for efficient cleavage. Recent studies on murine hepatitis virus (MHV) showed that processing of the 1a polyprotein at the position between nsp10-nsp11 is essential for viral replication. In this report, we investigated the requirement of processing at the equivalent position for replication of avian coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), using an infectious cloning system. The results showed that mutation of the P1 Gln to Pro or deletion of the Gln residue in the nsp10-nsp11/12 site completely abolished the 3CLpro-mediated processing, but allowed production of infectious recombinant viruses with variable degrees of growth defect, suggesting that cleavage at the nsp10-nsp11/12 site of IBV is dispensable for viral replication in cultured cells. This study would pave a way for potential vaccine development by generation of attenuated IBV from field isolates through manipulation of the nsp10-nsp11/12 cleavage site. Similar approaches would be also applicable to other human and animal coronaviruses.",

It mediates cleavage of the replicase polyproteins 1a and 1ab at 11 specific sites, generating 12 mature non-structural proteins (nsp) (from nsp5-16) and, probably, functional intermediates involved in the replication and transcription of viral RNA (Ziebuhr et al., 2000; Ziebuhr, 2005; Masters, 2006) . The substrate specificity of coronavirus 3CLpro is determined mainly by the P1, P2 and P1\u2032 positions. Comparative analyses of 77 cleavage sites of 3CLpro from seven coronaviruses suggest amino acid conservation at the P2 (Leu, Val, Ile, Phe, and Met), P1 (Gln) and P1\u2032 (Ser, Ala, Gly, Asn, and Cys) positions. Among them, the P1 position is exclusively occupied by a Gln and the bulky hydrophobic residues (mainly Leu) are dominant at the P2 position (Ziebuhr et al., 2000; Thiel et al., 2003; Gao et al., 2003) . Insights into the catalytic activity and substrate specificity of 3CLpros obtained by recent determination of the crystal structure of 3CLpros from coronavirus transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) confirm the necessity of conservation at the P1 position of the substrates (Anand et al., 2002 Yang et al., 2003; Xue et al., 2008) .",

However, the exact roles and necessity of 3CLpro-mediated processing at individual cleavage sites as well as the functions of specific cleavage intermediates in the life cycle of a given coronavirus are poorly understood. In a recent study, proteolytic processing at the cleavage sites between nsp6-nsp7, nsp7-nsp8, nsp8-nsp9, and nsp10-nsp11 of murine hepatitis virus (MHV) was shown to be essential for replication of MHV in cultured cells (Deming et al., 2007) . In this report, we used an established reverse genetic system to investigate the requirement of processing at the position between nsp10-nsp11/12 for IBV replication. In contrast to the results reported by Deming et al. (2007) for MHV, mutation or deletion of the conserved P1 Gln residue (Gln3928) showed that proteolytic processing of the IBV polyproteins 1a and 1ab at this position is dispensable for virus replication in cultured cells. Mutation of the Gln3928 residue to Pro (Q3928P) or deletion of Gln3928 (\u0394Q3928) completely abolished the 3CLpro-mediated processing at the position, but allowed recovery of mutant viruses with no detectable cleavage at the position between nsp10-nsp11/12 in cells infected with the recovered mutant viruses. The mutant viruses showed variable degrees of growth defect, revealing a potential way for generation of attenuated viruses for vaccine development.",

To check the effect of these manipulations on the cleavability of the substrate, IBV sequence (12100-12719 nucleotide) flanking this cleavage site was amplified by RT-PCR, and cloned into a vector in frame with a FLAG tag at the N-terminus (Fig. 1a) . To facilitate detection of the cleavage products, an additional T was inserted between nucleotides 12347 and 12348, resulting in the extension of the ORF1a frame to the end of the fragment (nucleotide position 12719) (Fig. 1a) . To analyze the 3CLpro-mediated processing, IBV 3CLpro was co-expressed with the mutant constructs in Vero cells using the recombinant vaccinia virus/T7 system. Western blotting analysis with anti-FLAG antibody showed that 3CLpro was able to completely cleave the wild type substrate; a cleavage product with predicted molecular mass of 9.1 kDa was detected (Fig. 1b, lane 2) .

A predominant cleavage product with an approximately molecular mass of 100 kDa, representing the nsp12 protein, was detected in cells infected with wild type rIBV (Fig. 2b, lane 2) . A minor band of approximately 120 kDa was also detected in the same cell lysates (Fig. 2b, lane 2) ; it may represent the nsp10-nsp12 intermediate cleavage product. In cells infected with the Q3928P and \u0394Q3928 mutant viruses, only the 120 kDa species was detected (Fig. 2b, lanes 4 and 5) . Unexpectedly, in cells infected with the Q3928N mutant virus, both the 100 kDa and the 120 kDa species were detected, although detection of slightly more 120 kDa species was observed (Fig. 2b, lane 3) , suggesting that this mutation did not completely ablate cleavage at this position in cells infected with the mutant virus. Attempts to detect the nsp10-11 intermediate in cells infected with wild type and mutant viruses were unsuccessful, due to the low quality of the available antibodies against nsp10. As a control for the efficiency of IBV infection, cells infected with wild type and the \u0394Q3928 mutant virus, respectively, were analyzed by immunoprecipitation analysis with anti-IBV S protein antibodies, showing the presence of glycosylated full-length (S a ), unglycosylated full-length (S b ) species (Fig. 2b, lanes 6-8) . The cleaved S1/S2 (S c ) species were also marginally detected in this gel (Fig. 2b, lanes 6-8) , and much more clear detection of these species was obtained in longer exposed gels (data not shown). These results confirmed that either mutation of the Q3928 residue to a Pro or deletion of the Q3928 residue totally blocked the IBV 3CLpro-mediated cleavage at the position. However, viable viruses with reasonably good replication efficiency could be recovered from in vitro transcribed full-length RNAs containing the mutation/deletion.",

Nsp12 encodes the putative viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, a critical enzyme that directly controls the replication and transcription of viral RNA. Coronavirus nsp10 may function in the formation of viral replication/transcription complexes. It was reported that IBV nsp10 may form dimers and localize to membranes associated with RNA synthesis (Ng and Liu, 2002) ; and MHV nsp10 colocalizes with nsp1, nsp2, nsp5, nsp7, nsp8, nsp9, nsp12, nsp13 and nucleocapsid protein at the site of replication complexes (Bost et al., 2000; Brockway et al., 2003) . More recently, the protein was shown to be involved in the synthesis of MHV RNA (Sawicki et al., 2005) , by functioning as a critical regulator of viral RNA synthesis (Donaldson et al., 2007b) . It may also play a role in regulation of polyprotein processing (Donaldson et al., 2007a) . Structural studies of the SARS-CoV nsp10 showed that it is a novel zinc finger protein with two zinc-binding motifs and 12 identical subunits assemble into a novel functional dodecameric architecture that forms a hollow, positively charged cylinder (Su et al., 2006; Joseph et al., 2006) . Based on this information, the protein was proposed to be a transcription factor (Su et al., 2006) . In this study, we provided concrete genetic and biochemical evidence that proteolytic processing at the cleavage sites between the two proteins is not required for their functions in viral replication. It suggests that the nsp10-12 intermediate may play the functions of both nsp10 and nsp12 in virusinfected cells. It is puzzling that two such critical functional proteins would retain their individual functionality in the form of a processing intermediate. Interestingly, our results are in sharp contrast to a recently reported result that processing of nsp10-nsp11/12 was essential for MHV replication (Deming et al., 2007) . The reason for this remarkable discrepancy is not known. Nevertheless, it demonstrates that different RNA viruses, even among viruses in the same family, may employ totally different strategies to regulate their RNA replication. In addition, our data would indirectly support the proposal that the fused nsp10-nsp11 could be crystallized into a novel functional dodecameric architecture (Su et al., 2006) .",

            "text": "Mutational analysis and peptide cleavage data have shown that replacement of the conserved P2 Leu residue with a Val could significantly decrease the cleavage efficiency in several positions (Fan et al., 2004 (Fan et al., , 2005 . The nsp10-nsp11/12 site of IBV has a Val instead of Leu residue at the P2 position and the P2 positions of nsp10-nsp11/12 in other coronaviruses are also occupied by noncanonical residues (Ziebuhr and Siddell, 1999, Fan et al., 2004) . In this study, a minute amount of the nsp10-nsp12 intermediate was detected in cells infected with wild type IBV. This intermediate cleavage product would therefore maintain the functions of both nsp10 and nsp12 proteins, making it more difficult to design peptide inhibitors. On the other hand, it is reasonable to speculate that the full functions of the two proteins may depend on one another. For example, it is not yet confirmed that nsp12 is the coronavirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase due to the lack of concrete biochemical data. One possibility is that inclusion of nsp10 in the in vitro experiment system would be needed in order to detect the full function of nsp12, especially the activity involved in de novo synthesis of the full-length coronavirus RNA using purified nsp12. The fact that minute amounts of the nsp10-12 intermediate were detected in cells infected with wild type IBV further supports that the two proteins may function synergistically.",

For example, infectious virus recovered from construct with deletion of the Q3928 residue is stable and showed slow growth kinetics with lower peak titer. Furthermore, infectious virus with even lower replication efficiency could also be recovered from construct with deletion of both Q3928-S3929 residues. Manipulation of this position would create attenuated viruses suitable for development of IBV vaccines from new isolates. Meanwhile, manipulation of the same position in other human and animal coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV, might be able to create attenuated viruses for the same purpose. Further insights into the practicality of this approach in vaccine development would be provided by systematic studies to confirm if mutant viruses generated by this manipulation were also attenuated in pathogenesis as well as the stability and recombination rate of the mutant viruses in animals.",
