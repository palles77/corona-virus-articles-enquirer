The effects of landscape heterogeneity on parasite communities are poorly understood, although it has been shown that anthropogenic impacts may contribute to outbreaks of both parasites and pathogens. We tested for effects of landcover type, composition, configuration, and urbanisation on avian diversity and avian malaria prevalence in 26 communities of wetland-associated passerines in the Western Cape of South Africa. We predicted that avian malaria prevalence would be influenced by the pattern of farmland and urban areas in the surrounding landscapes and the sizes of the wetlands in which birds were sampled. We quantified landscape pattern using a six-class simplification of the National Landcover data set at 35 9 35 m resolution and five extents of between 1 and 20 km from each wetland. The bird community was sampled using point counts and we collected blood samples from birds at each site. We screened these for malaria using PCR and molecular techniques. Passerine species richness and infection prevalence varied significantly between different landcover types. Host richness and parasite prevalence were highest in viticultural and cropping sites respectively and lowest in urban sites. Wetlands located in indigenous vegetation had intermediate numbers of bird species and intermediate parasite prevalence. Landscape composition and habitat type surrounding wetlands emerged as useful correlates of infection prevalence. Anthropogenic landscape modification appears to have both direct and indirect effects on avian communities and their associated parasite assemblages, with attendant consequences for avian health.",

Far less is known about the consequences of landscape heterogeneity, and of changes in landscape composition and configuration, for parasites and pathogens. As humans alter landscape pattern, a number of impacts on parasites and their hosts and vectors are likely to occur. Of particular relevance are changes in the abundance and species richness of host and vector species. These occur in response to changes in such variables as habitat structure, resource availability, predation rates, and ease of dispersal (With and Crist 1995; Flather and Sauer 1996) . Unless all hosts and all vectors are equally competent, changes in host and/or vector communities can be expected to alter the transmission rates of parasites (and their overall prevalence within the host community) by altering the numbers of suitable and available hosts (Kruess and Tscharnkte 1994; Brisson et al. 2011) , the number of successful transmission events that occur by either direct contact or via vectors, and/or the prevalence of infectious individuals among susceptible hosts (Roche et al. 2012) .",

            "text": "The problem of deriving general principles from which to predict impacts of landscape change on parasite communities is complicated by a set of indirect and idiosyncratic effects. For example, more diverse host communities may exhibit lower infection rates because more 'wasted bites' on incompetent vector species occur (Dobson et al. 2006) . Conversely, communities that are more diverse to begin with will be more likely to retain at least some highly competent hosts and vectors following anthropogenic habitat modification. Changes in landscape composition and configuration can influence dispersal rates and bring domestic and wild species (and people) into contact with one another, further altering parasite and pathogen dynamics. For instance, deforestation has been blamed for outbreaks of human malaria in the Amazon Basin (Vittor et al. 2006) , cutaneous leishmaniasis in Costa Rica (Chaves et al. 2008) , and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in South East Asia (Field 2009 ). Urbanization has similarly been linked to the proliferation of zoonotics such as Lyme disease (LoGiudice et al. 2003 ) and rabies (Singh et al. 2001) .",

Similarly, urbanization can have a negative effect on habitat quality and correspondingly on avian species richness in greater Cape Town (Dures and Cumming 2010) . These changes would be expected to both directly and indirectly affect parasite and pathogen prevalence. In the USA, research on West Nile Virus (WNV) showed that an increased prevalence of antibodies for WNV in songbirds corresponded to an increasing scale of urbanization (Bradley et al. 2008) . In American wetlands, WNV prevalence decreased with increasing wetland size (Ezenwa et al. 2007) . Similarly, wetland size has been linked to resource availability (Paracuellos and Tell\u00e9ria 2004) , and may subsequently affect local avian species richness as a result.",

The heaviest malarial infections and highest passerine species richness were both found in agricultural landscapes, whereas the lowest values occurred in urban landscapes (Figs. 2, 3) . Birds from the Ploceidae family also exhibited some of the heaviest infection prevalences. Many sampled passerine species were seed-eaters (Hockey et al. 2005) , occurring mostly in the Ploceidae and Passeridae (sparrows and allies). It is natural that seed-eaters would be commoner in agricultural landscapes, as these landscapes are presumably richer in available resources for seed-eating birds. The finding also concurs with previous studies, where bird species richness mirrored resource availability (Paracuellos and Tell\u00e9ria 2004; Child et al. 2009 ). ",

Model fit changed only minimally when configurational variables were added, indicating that landscape configuration was not as influential as landcover type. This result is comparable to the outcomes from related studies on disease prevalence in various landscapes, where infection prevalence varied significantly between different vegetation types (Boone et al. 2000) , and to more general studies that have indicated a larger effect of habitat amount than of habitat configuration (e.g., Flather and Bevers 2002) . Other studies on vectorborne disease prevalence and landscape composition and configuration have, however, indicated that both land use and connectivity can also play primary roles in influencing disease prevalence (Linard et al. 2007; Vanwambeke et al. 2010) . These outcomes suggest that host and vector ecology not only contribute to the influence of landscape factors in vector-borne disease, but also affect the magnitude of their influence. Wetlands in agricultural landscapes had the highest infection prevalences among those sampled (Fig. 3) . While this could be solely a consequence of the fact that passerine (host) species richness was highest in agricultural areas, vector-related factors may also have played a part in this outcome. Previous studies in Kenya and Ethiopia have demonstrated a positive link between Anopheles gambiae larval development and the agricultural modification of landscapes, which often enhances conditions for mosquito breeding (Kebede et al. 2005; Munga et al. 2009 ). It is feasible that the same mechanisms may be in effect in the Western Cape of South Africa, where crops can provide a rich nutrient source for the larvae of avian malaria vectors. Additionally, irrigation practices in agricultural landscapes in the Western Cape (Venter 2005) facilitate vector breeding and development, as virtually all avian malaria vectors have a waterdependent stage in their lifecycle (Valki\u016bnas 2005) .",

The largest influence of landscape structural factors was at local extents (1-5 km) and restricted to specific landscape types (agricultural and urban). This was also an indication that factors pertaining to species richness with the most influence on prevalence patterns were most intense at close proximity ( Table 2) . The low passerine species richness and correspondingly low infection prevalence in urban areas (Figs. 2, 3) suggested that most sampled passerine species either do not adapt Bradley et al. 2008 ). An alternative explanation is that the encounter rate in urban landscapes between passerine hosts and malarial pathogens is much lower than in other landscapes due to a lack of infectious vectors and/or susceptible hosts (Roche et al. 2012) .",

            "text": "Host adaptability to the landscape can have similarly significant implications for host viability and disease prevalence. Piersma (1997) postulated that some avian species are restricted to parasite-poor habitats as a trade-off with investing in immunocompetence, resulting in some species spending much more energy migrating to parasite-poor habitats in order to avoid infection. This hypothesis prompts several considerations: for instance, are migratory birds less prevalently infected than resident species? Do urban landscapes qualify as 'parasite-poor' habitats in the avian malaria model? There is also the possibility that birds act as sources of disease, as was the case in Chicago, USA, where migratory birds were the main hosts promoting the invasion of ticks (including nonendemic species) into the city (Hamer et al. 2012 ). Patterns of disease across a landscape are often the consequence of spatially explicit and interlinked factors that respond similarly to changes in landscape structure (Patz et al. 2000) . The response of pathogens and hosts to changes in the landscape may vary widely. Our findings contrast with those from a West African study on avian malaria, which reported a higher prevalence of avian malaria in undisturbed habitats compared to modified (deforested) habitats (Chasar et al. 2009 ). In our study, undisturbed habitats (fynbos) had lower infection prevalence than agriculturally modified habitats (agricultural and viticultural). Our findings also contrast with several other related studies, where the prevalence of a variety of diseases in wildlife populations increased with, or was promoted by, urban land development (Singh et al. 2001; Farnsworth et al. 2005 ). On the other hand, a human malaria study found a lower prevalence in urban areas, which concurred with outcomes seen in this study (Omumbo et al. 2005) . Our overall impression is therefore that landcover can act as either a positive and negative influence on disease, with its exact role being co-dependent upon a diversity of mechanisms in host and vector ecology (Patz et al. 2000) .",
