How these cascades contribute to hepatocarcinogenesis remains unknown. Here, we show that inhibition of RPS6 pathway via Rapamycin effectively suppressed, whereas blockade of the 4EBP1/eIF4E cascade by 4EBP1A4, an unphosphorylatable form of 4EBP1, significantly delayed, AKT/Ras induced hepatocarcinogenesis. Combined treatment with Rapamycin and 4EBP1A4 completely inhibited AKT/Ras hepatocarcinogenesis. This strong anti-neoplastic effect was successfully recapitulated by ablating Raptor, the major subunit of mTORC1, in AKT/Ras-overexpressing livers. Furthermore, we demonstrate that overexpression of eIF4E, the protooncogene whose activity is specifically inhibited by 4EBP1, resulted in HCC development in cooperation with activated Ras. Mechanistically, we identified the ENTPD5/AK1/CMPK1 axis and the mitochondrial biogenesis pathway as targets of the 4EBP1/eIF4E cascade in AKT/Ras and Ras/eIF4E livers as well as in human HCC cell lines and tissues.",

            "text": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common type of liver cancer and the fourth leading cause of cancer death worldwide. 1 Treatment options for HCC are limited and generally ineffective: only a small percentage of HCC is diagnosed at an early stage and amenable to potential curative treatments such as surgical resection, liver transplantation, and radiofrequency ablation. [2] [3] [4] The only approved drug for the treatment of advanced HCC is Sorafenib, a multi-kinase inhibitor, whose overall efficacy in terms of patient's survival extension is, however, rather limited. 5 Thus, the development of novel therapeutic strategies against advanced HCC is mandatory. For this purpose, a deeper knowledge of the molecular mechanisms underlying hepatocarcinogenesis is necessary. 6, 7 One of the most frequently activated pathways in HCC is the PI3K/AKT/mTOR cascade, 8 which has been implicated in tumor initiation, progression, and metastasis. 9,10 Following PI3K (phosphoinositide 3-kinase) activation by receptor tyrosine kinases or G protein coupled receptors, AKT (v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog) is recruited to the membrane and phosphorylated. 9, 10 In mouse hepatocytes, overexpression of an activated form of AKT (Myr-AKT) induces lipogenesis and hepatocyte proliferation, eventually leading to HCC development within six months. 11 AKT exerts many effects on target cells through its key downstream effector, the mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1). 10, 12 The mTORC1 axis is also frequently activated in human HCC. 13 Using mice with liverspecific deletion of TSC1 and Raptor (regulatory associated protein of mTORC1, an essential mTORC1 component), a recent study showed that mTORC1 controls ketogenesis in mice in response to fasting and its modulation by ageing. 14 Moreover, chronic activation of mTORC1 in mice with liver-specific deletion of TSC1 leads to hepatocarcinogenesis. 15 The major regulators downstream of mTORC1 are 4EBP1 and p70S6K1/2. 16, 17 4EBP1 negatively regulates eIF4E, a key rate-limiting initiation factor for cap-dependent translation. Phosphorylation by mTORC1 leads to 4EBP1 dissociation from eIF4E, allowing translation initiation complex formation at the 5' end of mRNAs. 4EBP1/eIF4E mediated translational control has been shown to be the key downstream signal of mTORC1 in AKTinduced lymphomagenesis in vivo, 18 and a critical mediator of mTORC1-induced cell proliferation. 19 Moreover, 4EBP1/eIF4E has been found to be a major effector of the oncogenic activation of AKT and ERK signaling pathways in tumor cell lines and xenograft models. 20 p70S6K1/2 is another downstream effector of mTORC1. Once phosphorylated and activated by mTORC1, p70S6K1/2 in turn regulates 40S ribosomal protein S6 (RPS6) as well as other regulators of translation initiation. 21 Ablation of RPS6 in mouse hepatocytes inhibits cell proliferation after partial hepatectomy. 22, 23 Also, when all the five phosphorylatable serine residues of RPS6 are substituted by unphosphorylatable alanine, knock-in RPS6(P \u2212/\u2212 ) mice display cell growth defect. 24 Using RPS6(P \u2212/\u2212 ) mice, a previous study showed that loss of phosphorylation of RPS6 is dispensable for AKT-mediated lymphomagenesis. 18 Rapamycin, an allosteric partial inhibitor of mTORC1, and its analogues (Rapalogs) have been tested clinically as anti-cancer agent in multiple tumor types. 25, 26 However, Rapalogs only showed modest clinical efficacy, presumably due to their capacity to suppress phosphorylation of RPS6 but not 4EBP1. 27, 28 Concomitant activation of AKT/mTOR and Ras/MAPK cascades is frequently observed in human HCC. 13, 29 To elucidate the molecular and biochemical crosstalk(s) between the two pathways, we generated a mouse model of liver cancer characterized by co-expression of activated forms of AKT and N-Ras. 30 In the current study, using genetic and pharmacological approaches, we systematically investigated the requirement of each of the two main mTORC1 downstream effectors, 4EBP1/eIF4E and p70S6K/RPS6, in AKT/Rasinduced hepatocarcinogenesis in vivo. Our data demonstrate that complete inhibition of mTORC1 is required to suppress hepatocarcinogenesis driven by N-Ras and AKT oncogenes in mice.",

Raptor fl/+ mice were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory (Stock: 013188), and intercrossed to generate Raptor fl/fl mice. 14 Hydrodynamic injections were performed as described previously. 11, [30] [31] [32] To delete Raptor while co-expressing AKT and/or Ras, we injected high dose of pT3-Cre (20\u00b5g) with low dose of AKT (4\u00b5g) and/or Ras (4\u00b5g). To ensure that all oncogene expressing cells also express Cre which led to deletion of the targeted floxed alleles, we injected pT3-Cre (20\u00b5g) with HA tagged AKT (4\u00b5g) into R26R-EYFP mice. In the R26R-EYFP mice, Cre-mediated excision of the floxed termination sequence leads to constitutive EYFP expression. 33 Subsequent double immunofluorescence staining showed that all HA positive AKT expressing cells were also EYFP positive ( Supplementary Fig. 1 ), supporting the notion that we were able to simultaneously delete the targeted floxed alleles while expressing the oncogene in the same set of hepatocytes. Rapamycin (6mg/kg/day) or vehicle was intraperitoneally administered for 7 or 11 weeks immediately after hydrodynamic injection. To block the 4EBP1/eIF4E cascade, high doses of 4EBP1A4 (20\u00b5g) with low doses of AKT (4\u00b5g) and/or Ras (4\u00b5g) were injected. To generate eIF4E and Ras/eIF4E mice, pT3-EF1\u03b1-HA-eIF4E (10\u00b5g) alone or with pT2CAGGS-NRasV12 (10 \u00b5g) was hydrodynamically injected into FVB/N mice. Wild-type (not injected) and mice injected with pT3-EF1\u03b1 empty plasmid were used as controls; since no difference in any parameter analyzed between the two control groups was detected, the data were merged. Mice were housed, fed, and monitored in accordance with protocols approved by the committee for animal research at the University of California, San Francisco. ",

Previous findings showed that 4EBP1A4 is able to efficiently block eIF4E mediated CAP-dependent translational initiation downstream of mTORC1. 18 Accordingly, we found that overexpression of 4EBP1A4, but not Rapamycin treatment, inhibited CAP-dependent translation in the AKT/Ras mouse liver tumor cell line ( Supplementary Fig. 3 ). This cell line was used since it accurately recapitulates the molecular mechanisms responsible for AKT/Ras induced hepatocarcinogenesis. 34 Seven weeks after hydrodynamic injection, none of the AKT/Ras/4EBP1A4 mice developed palpable liver masses (Fig. 2) . In contrast, all mice from the AKT/Ras/pT3 and AKT/Ras/ 4EBP1WT cohorts developed lethal burden of liver tumors (Fig.2, Supplementary Fig. 4, 5) . Grossly, only few very small nodules could be observed in the livers of AKT/Ras/4EBP1A4 mice whereas numerous large nodules equally developed in the livers of AKT/Ras/pT3 and AKT/Ras/4EBP1WT mice 7 weeks post injection (Fig. 2, Supplementary Fig. 4 , 5).",

Thus, we investigated whether complete suppression of mTORC1 by concomitant inhibition of RPS6 and eIF4E could completely abolish AKT/Ras hepatocarcinogenesis. For this purpose, mice co-injected with AKT, Ras and 4EBP1A4 were treated with Rapamycin (AKT/Ras/4EBP1A4/Rapa; n=5) or vehicle (AKT/Ras/4EBP1A4/Veh; n=3) for 7 weeks (Supplementary Fig. 2C ). Macroscopically, no tumor nodules could be detected on the liver surface of AKT/Ras/4EBP1A4/Rapa mice ( Fig.  4A and 4B ). Histological examination revealed that the liver tissues from AKT/Ras/ 4EBP1A4/Rapa mice were nearly normal: only few isolated but never clusters of cells showed the lipid-rich features of AKT/Ras preneoplastic cells (Fig. 4C ). The altered clearcell hepatocytes were HA-positive, demonstrating the stable transfection with injected AKT (Fig. 4D ). Of note, the few lipid-rich cells from AKT/Ras/4EBP1A4/Rapa mice show scarce or no activation of AKT, ERK, and mTOR proteins by immunohistochemistry (Fig. 4E) , implying the suppression of these cascades in the residual preneoplastic cells. In contrast, AKT and ERK proteins were still activated in the small clusters of preneoplastic cells from Rapamycin treated AKT/Ras mice (AKT/Ras/Rapa; Fig. 1 ) and in preneoplastic lesions of AKT/Ras/4EBP1A4 injected mice (not shown). In addition, no difference in proliferative activity was detected in AKT/Ras/4EBP1A4/Rapa livers when compared with livers from mice injected only with empty vector (0.23 \u00b1 0.2 vs. 0.25 \u00b1 0.1, respectively; P = 0.9228; n=5 per each group).",

Histologically, liver tumors from AKT/Ras/pT3 injected Raptor fl/fl mice were undistinguishable from those developed in wild type mice co-expressing AKT and Ras: 30 preneoplastic lesions and tumors occupied up to 90% of the liver parenchyma and tumor cells were highly proliferative (Fig. 5D ). In contrast, liver tissues from AKT/Ras/Cre injected Raptor fl/fl mice were completely normal with no signs of preneoplastic or neoplastic lesions (Fig. 5E, upper panel) . Only thorough histological investigation of the livers was able to detect very few single HA-positive clear-cell hepatocytes (Fig. 5E, lower panel) . Noticeably, the observed effect was due to ablation of Raptor by Cre, and not the results of non-specific effects of Cre, as when AKT/Ras/Cre was injected into wild-type mice, lethal burden of liver tumors developed in these mice by 6 to 8 weeks post injection, similar to that observed in AKT/Ras injected mice (data not shown). To determine whether liver tumors might eventually develop over long term, AKT/Ras/Cre injected Raptor fl/fl mice were aged until 20 weeks post injection (n=3).

In contrast, some inducers of glycolysis, such as LDHA/C, ENTPD5 and its downstream effector AK1, were downregulated almost exclusively in AKT/Ras/4EBP1A4 mice. Importantly, LDHA/C downregulation occurred independent of c-Myc, since the latter was mainly downregulated following Rapamycin administration (Fig.  6B) . Furthermore, although it has been demonstrated that ENTPD5 inhibits the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress pathway, 36,37 the levels of ER stress surrogate markers, including CHOP, BIP, and phosphorylated/activated PERK were not induced in AKT/Ras/4EBP1A4 mice (Fig. 6B) . Since it has been recently found that 4EBP proteins negatively regulate mitochondrial activity and biogenesis, 38 we tested the levels of the master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis, mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM). Of note, TFAM was only downregulated in AKT/Ras/4EBP1A4 mice (Fig. 6B ). An additional established target of the 4EBP1/eIF4E axis, namely Cyclin D1, was downregulated only in AKT/Ras/ 4EBP1A4 mice. Finally, the importance of ENTPD5 in AKT/Ras-induced hepatocarcinogenesis was assessed by its siRNA-mediated silencing in the AKT/Ras cell line ( Supplementary Fig. 7) . Inhibition of ENTPD5 resulted in decrease of proliferation and induction of apoptosis in AKT/Ras cells when compared with control cells ( Supplementary  Fig. 7B, C) . At the molecular level, AKT/Ras cells depleted of ENTPD5 did not show any relevant change in the levels of proteins involved in ER stress (BIP and p-PERK) or glycolysis (PKM2, LDHA/C, Hexokinase II or HXII, liver phosphofructokinase or PFKL, and aldolase A or ALDOA) ( Supplementary Fig. 7A ).",

In particular, the role of the 4EBP1/eIF4E pathway in cancer remains poorly understood. 4EBP1/eIF4E has been found to be a main effector of the AKT and ERK signaling pathways in in vitro and in vivo models. 20 As a consequence, it is not surprising that elevated levels of eIF4E have been described in multiple tumor types, including lung, bladder, colon, breast, prostate, cervix, ovary, and thyroid neoplasms 39, 40 With regard to HCC, a recent investigation showed an increased eIF4E expression in tumor samples and a significant association between eIF4E levels and tumor recurrence. 41 In the present study, we dissected for the first time the critical function of 4EBP1/eIF4E axis in the context of activated AKT/mTOR and Ras/MAPK cascades along hepatocarcinogenesis. Our data demonstrate that blocking eIF4E activity via the unphosphorylatable form of 4EBP1 (4EBP1A4) significantly delays both liver tumor development and progression induced by AKT and Ras oncogenes. Indeed, liver tumors were observed only after a long latency and consisted mainly of HCA and small HCC or ICC in AKT/Ras/4EBP1A4 mice. Nevertheless, despite the strong tumor suppressor activity, overexpression of 4EBP1A4 was unable to completely inhibit liver tumor development. This finding suggests that AKT/Ras driven hepatocarcinogenesis is able, at least in part, to overcome the deficiency of eIF4E and its related biologic effects.",

Despite the assumption that eIF4E regulates translation at global level, mounting evidence suggest that it contributes to tumorigenesis by regulating a small set of proteins, such as Cyclin D1, VEGF, and c-Myc. 39, 40 Here, we show that the ENTPD5/AK1/CMPK1 pathway is a major biochemical event downstream of eIF4E in mouse and human hepatocarcinogenesis. ENTPD5 is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) UDPase that, together with AK1 and CMPK1, regulates a futile cycle which converts ATP into AMP, leading to compensatory increased aerobic glycolysis. 36,37 Thus, eIF4E might play a major role in promoting ATP consumption to satisfy the energetic and biosynthetic requirements of AKT/Ras cells. In addition, it has been found that ENTPD5 favours protein glycosylation and refolding, which protects tumor cells from protein overloading induced ER stress. 37 Surprisingly, we did not detect any sign of ER stress induction following inactivation of eIF4E by 4EBP1A4 overexpression both in AKT/Ras/4EBP1A4 mice and AKT/Ras cells. Similarly, ER stress and glycolysis proteins were not affected by ENTPD5 depletion in AKT/Ras cells. These findings suggest that ENTPD5 might play distinct roles that are context-or cell-type dependent. Although additional studies are needed to identify ENTPD5 targets in liver cancer, we have confirmed the strong connection between the 4EBP1/eIF4E and the ENTPD5/AK1/CMPK1 axes both in human HCC specimens and HLF cells, substantiating the important link between the two cascades in liver cancer.",

            "text": "Interestingly, we found that eIF4E controls also the final step of anaerobic glycolysis, since overexpression of 4EBP1A4 suppressed LDHA/C expression much more efficiently than Rapamycin in AKT/Ras mice. Furthermore, inactivation of eIF4E but not RPS6 resulted in the downregulation of the TFAM transcription factor, in accordance with the recent finding that the 4EBP1/eIF4E axis regulates mitochondrial activity and biogenesis. 38 Based on this body of data, it is tempting to speculate that the 4EBP1/eIF4E axis might be a central player in modulating aerobic and anaerobic glycolysis as well as mitochondrial dependent metabolisms.",

We showed that eIF4E alone is not able to promote malignant transformation of murine hepatocytes, at least under our experimental conditions. Nevertheless, we found that eIF4E cooperates with activated N-Ras (whose overexpression per se is also unable to drive hepatocarcinogenesis 32 ) to induce liver tumor development in the mouse. It is intriguing to note that both the Ras/MAPK and eIF4E cascades are not inhibited by Rapamycin in AKT/Ras mice. 34 Also, hepatocellular tumors eventually developing in eIF4E/Ras mice did not display the activation of the AKT/RPS6 cascade. Thus, we have identified a crosstalk between the Ras/MAPK and the eIF4E axes that is sufficient to drive hepatocarcinogenesis independent of the AKT/RPS6 pathway.",

However, it has been recently reported that everolimus failed the Phase III trial for the treatment of advanced HCC (http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01035229? term=EVOLVE-1&rank=1), suggesting that partial inhibition of the mTORC1 cascade has very limited therapeutic efficacy in the treatment of liver cancer. Our current data strongly support the use of drugs which efficiently inhibit both p70S6K/RPS6 and 4EBP1/eIF4E cascades. Importantly, inhibition of eIF4E via 4E2RCat, a compound isolated from a high throughput screening of molecules that inhibit the interaction between eIF4E and eIF4G, has shown encouraging anti-neoplastic effects. 43, 44 Combinatorial administration of 4E2RCat (or similar drugs) and Rapamycin might represent an innovative approach for the treatment of cancers with elevated mTORC1 activity.",
