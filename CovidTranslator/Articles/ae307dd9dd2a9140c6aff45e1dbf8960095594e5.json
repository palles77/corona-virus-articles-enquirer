This disease has become one of the most serious infectious diseases of dogs. During 2014 in China, there were many cases of acute infectious diarrhoea in dogs. Some faecal samples were negative for the CPV-2 antigen based on a colloidal gold test strip but were positive based on PCR, and a viral strain was isolated from one such sample. The cytopathic effect on susceptible cells and the results of the immunoperoxidase monolayer assay, PCR, and sequencing indicated that the pathogen was CPV-2. The strain was named CPV-NY-14, and the full-length genome was sequenced and analysed. A maximum likelihood tree was constructed using the full-length genome and all available CPV-2 genomes. New strains have replaced the original strain in Taiwan and Italy, although the CPV-2a strain is still predominant there. However, CPV-2a still causes many cases of acute infectious diarrhoea in dogs in China.",

A third CPV-2 variant, which was initially believed to be a Glu-426 mutant and subsequently renamed CPV-2c, was detected in Italy in 2000 [3] and is now circulating there together with types 2a and 2b [4] [5] [6] . The new type 2c has also been reported in Vietnam by Nakamura et al. [7] , who developed monoclonal antibodies specific for that type [7] .

            "text": "In addition, both trees showed that isolates from China have long branch lengths; this may indicate an extensive process of accumulation of mutations and substitutions in Chinese lineages. Since it emerged in 1978, canine parvovirus has spread in the domestic and wild canine population, where it is continuously evolving into new adaptive viral variants. The variability and the intrinsically high mutation rate of the CPV-2 genome allowed the diversity of CPV-2 to rapidly increase as the virus spread through canine populations [21] . Because some viral variants replicate more successfully than others, the virus population changes over time [22] . CPV-2a and CPV-2b are the best examples of variants with a fast spread and replacement capacity since the emergence of CPV-2 [9, 23] . During 2014, there were many cases of acute infectious diarrhoea in dogs. Some samples tested negative for the CPV-2 antigen by a colloidal gold test strip, while they were positive for CPV-2 by PCR. One viral strain was isolated from the faeces of dogs that tested negative in the colloidal gold test strip but positive with PCR. CPV-NY-14, which was described in this study, was found in dogs that exhibited acute haemorrhagic enteritis. Based on the PCR results, the only virus consistently detected in the samples was CPV-2. Some samples tested with the serology method (colloidal gold test strip) failed to detect the virus, while PCR was able to detect CPV-2, which is a valid and important objective. This may be due to differences in the test sensitivity (PCR is more sensitive than the serological test) or due to a change in the viral genome that leads to a major change in the type of the antigen (viral protein) and the failure of the antibodies to recognize the viral antigen in the serology test. This question needs to be addressed by future experiments. The isolated virus was then cultivated in F81 cells, and we next inoculated adult dogs with the isolated CPV-2. These animals presented clinical conditions characteristic of CPV-2 infection. PCR was used to demonstrate that CPV-2 was the agent causing the disease in these experimental animals.",
