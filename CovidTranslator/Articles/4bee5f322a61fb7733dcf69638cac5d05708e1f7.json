Virus was optimally attached to nitrocellulose membranes when spotted in 1 x SSC, whereas 20 x SSC was superior for viral RNA. Denaturation and RNA fixation of both RNA, still encapsidated in virus particles and isolated genomic RNA, was achieved by baking of the blots in vacuum . Virus detection in the supernatant of infected HRT-18 cells was feasible, but improved significantly after proteinase K treatment . No homology was observed between virus cDNA with either plasmid DNA or nucleic acid isolated from non-infected HRT-18 cells . Hybridization with radioisotopic-labelled probes in higher formamide concentrations (up to 60%) increased the detection signals, possibly by reducing reassociation of the probe . Significant detection amplification (30-50 times) was achieved in the case of biotinylated probes by stimulation of hyperpolymer formation on already hybridized target sequences, by additional hybridization with biotinylated pUC-19 . A detection amplification was also obtained when hybridization was done with two probes (pBC-52 and pBC-247), containing non-overlapping viral sequences . Although the detectability was surpassed by biotinylated probes, sensitivity was superior in radioisotopic virus detection .",

Direct spotting of the virus is preferred since it is simple and eliminates timeconsuming preparation of RNase-free glassware and buffers, laboursome RNA extraction procedures, especially when many samples have to be processed, and exposure of the viral genome to potentially present RNases . Virus binding onto nitrocellulose was found to be feasible, but the detection signal was two to three times higher if spotting was done in low salt concentrations instead of the usual 20 x SSC (Figs 1 & 2) . In contrast, RNA extracted from the virus was optimally immobilized on the nitrocellulose filters in high-salt conditions (Fig . 4) . This differential effect of salt concentration might be due to their influence on the net charge of both the nitrocellulose membrane and the macromolecules . charge of nitrocellulose and nucleic acid, which would result in repulsion, can be shielded by high salt concentrations, whereas for the virus, hydrophobic attachment was optimal in low-salt conditions . Optimal formamide concentrations for hybridization were found to differ slightly for the various radioistopic probes . Formamide concentrations of 60-65% for pBC-52 were found to be optimal, most probably due to the preferential formation of RNA-DNA hybrids over that of DNA-DNA duplexes in these conditions?\"' Therefore, DNA-DNA reassociation in solution decreases, whereas the relative concentration of probe available for DNA-RNA hybridization increases . Moreover, background hybridization with immobilized DNA is decreased . This effect can be observed in Fig . 1 for the hybridization signals obtained with the probe and immobilized pUC-19, respectively, in the different concentrations of formamide tested . Not only external hybridization conditions may be of importance, but also intrinsic values such as the complexities and probe length . Reassociation in solution of nick-translated M13 probes was expected to be lower than that of pUC probes due to the relative higher complexities . However, a poor detection of the target sequences was obtained with these probes . This might be due to the relatively lower concentration of the M13 insert sequences, possibly resulting in a deviation from pseudo first-order kinetics and reduced thermal diffusion of single-stranded insert to the target sequences . Virus could also be detected directly in the supernatant of infected HRT-18 cells, although proteinase K treatment strongly increased the sensitivity due to elimination of macromolecules competing for binding sites on the membrane . The detectability did not change significantly, probably since the amount of competing molecules was also decreased by further dilution (Fig . 5 ). This signal was specific for BCV, as vector sequences did not hybridize with nucleic acid isolated from noninfected HRT cells (Fig. 1) . Proteins and lipids from purified virus did not seem to interfere with RNA fixation when purified virus was spotted, in contrast to the macromolecules of virus-containing supernatant of HRT cells (Figs 4 & 5) .",
