The maximum a posteriori (MAP) reconstruction methods have been successful in compensating for the missing information and suppressing noise with their intrinsic regularization techniques. There are two major problems in MAP reconstruction methods: (1) selection of the regularization parameter that controls the balance between the data fidelity and the prior information, and (2) long computation time. One aim of this study is to provide an adaptive solution to the regularization parameter selection problem without having additional knowledge about the imaging environment and the sample. The other aim is to realize the reconstruction using sequences of resolution levels to shorten the computation time. The reconstructions were analyzed in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency using a simulated biological phantom and publically available experimental datasets of electron tomography. The numerical and visual evaluations of the experiments show that the adaptive multiresolution method can provide more accurate results than the weighted back projection (WBP), simultaneous iterative reconstruction technique (SIRT), and sequential MAP expectation maximization (sMAPEM) method. The method is superior to sMAPEM also in terms of computation time and usability since it can reconstruct 3D images significantly faster without requiring any parameter to be set by the user.",

Then, these projections are used to reconstruct the biological sample in 3D. The accuracy and the resolution of the reconstruction are limited by two major factors: (1) due to the mechanical and physical limitations, the projections typically collected only from 7 60\u00b0to 70\u00b0tilt angle range are used in the reconstruction (missing wedge problem).",

One of these methods, the L-curve method, analyzes the images reconstructed for different values of regularization parameter [1] . For each reconstruction, the relationship between the squared norm of the solution and the squared norm of the residual error is analyzed to find the optimum regularization parameter. A similar approach, S-curve method, was implemented for wavelet-based reconstruction [2] and total variation regularization [3] making the assumption that the reconstructed data is sparse in wavelet domain and gradient domain, respectively. Both L-curve and S-curve methods require multiple reconstructions of the data with different regularization parameters, which heavily increases the computational cost of the overall image reconstruction. In another method, Wen and Chan used discrepancy principle for total variation regularization in the image restoration context [4] . Their method requires prior information about the SNR of the data, which is not always straightforward to obtain in tomographic imaging. In this study, one of our aims was to develop an adaptive regularization method, which does not require additional analysis, structural a priori information about the data nor the imaging system, or the user manipulation according to the application purpose.",

            "text": "The other aim of this paper was to reduce the computation time, which is realized by employing multiresolution reconstruction in a sequential scheme. Multiresolution reconstruction grids [5] and multiresolution detector space [6] was used previously to improve the convergence rate of maximum likelihood expectation maximization (ML-EM) method in positron emission tomography (PET). It was also utilized in scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) [7] and discrete tomography that reconstructs images composed of small number of intensity levels representing only a few different materials [8] . In this paper, we use the multiresolution method in electron microscopy for the reconstruction of biological specimens with maximum a posteriori probability expectation maximization (MAPEM) method. Multiresolution approach introduced in MAPEM reconstruction enables the weight of the regularization to vary from strong to weak throughout the reconstruction. One reason is that the image size is increased during the reconstruction while the regularization filter size is fixed. The other reason is the number of binned projection data and so its averaging effect decreases throughout different resolution stages. By decreasing noise with these two mechanisms, the reconstruction converges smoothly to a coarse estimate of the reconstructed image at the first resolution stages. Then the number of binned pixels is decreased step by step to improve the resolution of the estimates. Since each step is initialized with a spatially coarse estimate of the image, they give better results in fewer iterations compared to initialization with an image of random or constant value. The computations take shorter time also because the calculations are faster in the smaller reconstruction grids used in the lower resolution stages. We developed the adaptive regularization method first as a parameter-free reconstruction process and then introduced the multiresolution approach to obtain the final adaptive multiresolution reconstruction method.",

In the dark field imaging mode, the detection of scattered electrons plays the major role in image formation, whereas it is the detection of transmitted electrons in bright-field imaging mode. We consider the bright field mode, used conventionally for ET in life sciences, in this study. In this imaging mode, a parallel beam of electrons illuminates the specimen, and the image is formed in the back focal plane of the objective lens by the electrons that pass through the aperture. For the image contrast mechanism, we only consider the amplitude contrast generated due to the electrons that are blocked from reaching the detector and we ignore the phase shift created by the electron-specimen interaction. This model is sufficient for medium-resolution contrast (beyond 2-3 nm) imaging however phase contrast should also be considered at higher resolutions where the features to be detected are smaller than the coherence length of the electron [9] . We also assume that successive electrons do not interact with each other so that they can be treated independently. This assumption holds for TEM imaging of biological specimens since the specimen is thinner than the mean distance between two successive electrons [10] .

Instead of using one constant regularization parameter value, the method used a sequence of these in the decreasing order. At each regularization stage, predefined number of iterations was performed with constant regularization parameter value. The initial stages with high values of regularization parameters provided a rough but robust estimate of the image for the following stages by highly suppressing the noise. The regularization parameter value was decreased to enhance the resolution and contrast of the final reconstructed image. This sequential method was consistently superior to the conventional reconstruction methods, weighted back-projection (WBP) and a simultaneous iterative reconstruction technique (SIRT), in terms of accuracy and noise suppression due to its capability of filling the missing wedge [12] .

In this way, noise was highly suppressed in the reconstruction in the first regularization stages to have coarse but robust estimate of the structure. In the following stages, the regularization parameter value was decreased to enhance the resolution and contrast of the estimate. In addition to changing the regularization parameter value adaptively to control the noise penalization, adaptive multiresolution MAPEM (amMA-PEM) reconstruction method changes the reconstruction image size while keeping the filter size constant. In our experiments, we fixed the window size of the filter to its smallest value (3 \u00c2 3) in order to minimize the loss of resolution due to filtering (The reader may refer to [11] for the effect of different filter sizes on MRP regularization). The same size of filter affects the small size image more strongly than the large one. With amMAPEM method, the strength of the penalization filter is weakened by increasing the image size stage by stage sequentially. The advantage of this approach is its computational efficiency.",

However, it is still close to its original spherical shape in the sMAPEM and am-MAPEM reconstructions. In Fig. 8 , the gold particle images are analyzed in more detail using line profiles taken through the center of the particle shown in Fig. 7 . The profiles taken in the x and z directions show that the edges of the sMAPEM and am-MAPEM profiles are sharper than the WBP and SIRT profiles. The plateau with the high intensity values is supposed to be flat because of the homogeneity of the gold particle. This region is flatter for amMAPEM compared with sMAPEM. The gold particles in the reconstructed volumes were also analyzed quantitatively. For that purpose, randomly selected 5 gold particles were isolated and compared in terms of FSC with the ground truth generated using the known size of the gold particles. The x-z and x-y projection images for three of these gold particles are presented in Fig. 9 . The average of 5 FSC curves is presented in the figure. The images and the FSC curve show that sMAPEM and amMAPEM methods provide more accurate results with less elongation artifacts compared to WBP and SIRT.",

The proposed adaptive regularization method extracts all necessary information simultaneously from the reconstructed image throughout the iterations.

The methods provide a compensation for the missing angular gap in the frequency domain by using the prior information of local smoothness. The gap filling ability arises from the MRP regularization. The median filter used throughout the iterations acts as an interpolator in the frequency domain. The information source for the interpolation is the relation of the pixel values in the local neighborhood. The filter preserves the edges in the spatial domain while using this information. The reader may refer to the previous studies for the detailed analysis of gap filling capability of sMAPEM in comparison with the conventional reconstruction methods [12, 13] . One of the major drawbacks of sMAPEM is that it requires a large number of iterations for gap filling. We overcome this computation time problem with am-MAPEM method by employing multiresolution reconstruction.",

Therefore, we utilized the multiresolution approach instead of OS to reduce the computation time. It was shown with the phantom and experimental datasets that the computation time is much shorter for amMAPEM than for sMAPEM.
