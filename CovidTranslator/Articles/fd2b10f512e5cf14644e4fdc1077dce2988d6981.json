            "text": "The coronavirus M protein, the most abundant coronaviral envelope component, is invariably glycosylated, which provides the virion with a diffuse, hydrophilic cover on its outer surface. Remarkably, while the group 1 and group 3 coronaviruses all have M proteins with N-linked sugars, the M proteins of the group 2 coronaviruses [e.g., mouse hepatitis virus (MHV)] are O-glycosylated. The conservation of the N-and O-glycosylation motifs suggests that each of these types of carbohydrate modifications is beneficial to their respective virus. Since glycosylation of the M protein is not required for virus assembly, the oligosaccharides are likely to be involved in the virus-host interaction. In order to investigate the role of the M protein glycosylation in the host, two genetically modified MHVs were generated by using targeted RNA recombination. The recombinant viruses carried M proteins that were either N-glycosylated or not glycosylated at all, and these were compared with the parental, O-glycosylated, virus. The M protein glycosylation state did not influence the tissue culture growth characteristics of the recombinant viruses. However, it affected their interferogenic capacity as measured using fixed, virus-infected cells. Viruses containing M proteins with N-linked sugars induced type I interferons to higher levels than viruses carrying M proteins with O-linked sugars. MHV with unglycosylated M proteins appeared to be a poor interferon inducer. In mice, the recombinant viruses differed in their ability to replicate in the liver, but not in the brain, whereas their in vivo interferogenic capacity did not appear to be affected by their glycosylation status. Strikingly, their abilities to replicate in the liver correlated with their in vitro interferogenic capacity. This apparent correlation might be explained by the functioning of lectins, such as the mannose receptor, which are abundantly expressed in the liver but also play a role in the induction of interferon-\u2423 by dendritic cells.",

            "text": "Glycosylation is a frequent modification of proteins in eukaryotic cells. Basically, two types of protein glycosylation occur. Oligosaccharide side chains are attached to pro-teins either by N-linkage to asparagine residues or by Olinkage to hydroxyl groups of serine and threonine residues. A great variety of functions have been attributed to the oligosaccharide side chains. Carbohydrates have been shown to be important for protein folding, structure, and stability and to be involved in intracellular sorting of proteins (e.g., during quality control) and to play essential roles in molecular recognition processes (e.g., in the generation of immune responses) (Drickamer and Taylor, 1998; Helenius and Aebi, 2001; Rudd and Dwek, 1997 ; Van den Steen et al., 1998) . Most viral glycoproteins are structural proteins that become incorporated into the membrane bilayer of enveloped viruses. Glycosylation of these envelope proteins plays an essential role in establishing their bioactive conformation and has effects on receptor binding, fusion activity, and antigenic properties of the virus (Alexander and Elder, 1984; Braakman and van Anken, 2000; Schulze, 1997) .",

The spike (S) glycoprotein and the hemagglutinin-esterase protein-the latter only present in some virus strains-both carry many N-linked sugar side chains.

In the first mutant, the functional acceptor site as well as an alternative acceptor site of O-glycosylation were eliminated by changing threonine residues 4 and 5 to alanines (de Haan et al., 1998b) . In the second mutant, a consensus N-linked glycosylation site was created in the amino terminus of the M protein by insertion of two asparagine residues in place of serine residue 2, in addition to the substitutions of the threonine residues introduced to make the first mutant. Thus, the protein expressed from this latter mutant M gene would be expected to be N-glycosylated only. These mutations were first generated in the transcription vector pFV1 (Fischer et al., 1997) (Fig. 1A ) and subsequently were introduced into MHV through homologous RNA recombination with the N gene deletion mutant Alb4, which was counterselected on the basis of its thermolabile phenotype (Masters, 1999; Masters et al., 1994) . Two independent candidate glycosylation-null mutants, Alb244 and Alb246, and two independent candidate N-glycosylation mutants, Alb248 and Alb250, were isolated. The genotypes of these were confirmed by direct genomic RNA sequencing of the 5\u0408 end of the M gene (Fig. 1C ) as well as by sequencing of the region that is deleted in the Alb4 virus genome (not shown). As isogenic wild-type controls for subsequent experiments we used Alb138 and Alb139, two independent wild-type recombinants obtained previously from Alb4 using pFV1-derived donor RNA.

            "text": "To verify whether the viral genomic mutations resulted in the desired phenotypes, we analyzed the glycosylation status of the M protein in assembled virions. To this end, cells infected with the different MHV recombinants were labeled with 35 S-labeled amino acids and the culture media were collected and processed for immunoprecipitation with an anti-MHV serum, followed by sodium dodecyl sulfatepolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) through a 15% polyacrylamide gel. In some cases, tunicamycin was added during the infection to the culture media to inhibit N-linked glycosylation. As shown in Fig. 2 , when no tunicamycin was added, S, N, and M proteins could be precipitated from the culture media, indicating that virus particles had been assembled and released from the cells infected with the MHV recombinants. The S protein appeared as the mature 180 kDa glycoprotein (S/gp 180). A fraction of the S protein had been cleaved into two subunits, both with a molecular weight of approximately 90 kDa (S/gp90). The M proteins of the different viruses showed clear differences in their electrophoretic mobilities. The M proteins obtained with Alb138 or Alb139 (i.e., the \"wild-type\" recombinants) appeared as the typical set of O-glycosylated forms described before (Krijnse Locker et al., 1992; Tooze et al., 1988) . The predominant forms are the M protein species containing galactose and sialic acid (M 3 and M 4 ), but the unglycosylated form (M 0 ; the fastest migrating form) and the slightly slower migrating form containing only N-acetylgalactosamine (M 1 ) were also visible. In contrast, the M protein released from cells infected with Alb244 or Alb246 migrated in the gel as a single band with approximately the same electrophoretic mobility as the unglycosylated M protein species released from Alb138-or Alb139-infected cells. The M proteins released from cells infected with Alb248 or Alb250 appeared as a smear in the gel, quite similar to the M proteins from group I coronaviruses, which carry Nlinked sugars (Rossen et al., 1998; Vennema et al., 1990) . The appearance of the M proteins as a smear in the gel is probably the result of extensive, heterogeneous modifications of the sugar side chains. To verify that the M proteins released from Alb248-and Alb250-infected cells contained no O-linked sugars in addition to N-linked side chains, we treated the cells with tunicamycin, which blocks N-linked, but not O-linked, glycosylation. Since tunicamycin also affects protein synthesis (Rossen et al., 1998) a longer exposure of this part of the gel is shown in Fig. 2 . After treatment with tunicamycin the N and M proteins, but not the S protein, could be precipitated from the culture media. This is in agreement with experiments, mentioned previously, which demonstrated that noninfectious virions, devoid of S protein, are assembled in the presence of tunicamycin. Although the glycosylation state of the M proteins released from cells infected with Alb138 was not affected by treatment with tunicamycin, confirming that O-glycosylation was not perturbed, the electrophoretic mobility of the M proteins released from Alb248-or Alb250-infected cells was drastically changed by the presence of the drug. These M proteins now migrated as a single band with the same electrophoretic mobility as unglycosylated M protein, indicating that in the absence of tunicamycin these M proteins become N-glycosylated, not O-glycosylated. These results demonstrated that the recombinant viruses have the predicted M protein glycosylation phenotypes. Furthermore, each pair of independently obtained recombinant viruses behaved identically. Alb138 and Alb139 contain M proteins with O-linked sugars (O \u03e9 N \u03ea ) and Alb244 and Alb246 carry M proteins without any attached sugars (O \u03ea N \u03ea ), whereas Alb248 and Alb250 contain M proteins with N-linked sugars only (O \u03ea N \u03e9 ).",

These results were confirmed using independent recombinants, which showed that all recombinants behaved identically and caused extensive syncytia and cytopathic effects indistinguishably (data not shown). Passage 3 stocks of each mutant virus had titers in the range of 1.4 to 2.2 \u03eb 10 8 PFU/ml, which was similar to the titers obtained with wild-type recombinant virus. In addition, we compared the infectivity of the viruses to several other cell lines, including bone-marrow-derived macrophages, macrophage cells lines, dendritic cells derived from the spleen, and primary hepatocytes. No differences were observed; all cell types were infected to a similar extent and exhibited similar cytopathic effects (data not shown).

            "text": "The induction of type I interferons (IFNs) by most RNA viruses is initiated by virus-derived double-stranded RNA. However, several enveloped viruses were shown to stimulate interferon-\u2423 (IFN\u2423) expression in peripheral blood mononuclear (PBM) cells via an alternative pathway in which virus glycoproteins are involved (Ito, 1994; Milone and Fitzgerald-Bocarsly, 1998) . Also TGEV virions and TGEV VLPs, as well as fixed, TGEV-infected cells, are efficient inducers of IFN\u2423 (Baudoux et al., 1998b) . Cell cultures infected with several other coronaviruses, including MHV, have also been demonstrated to have interferogenic capacity (Baudoux et al., 1998a) . For TGEV it was demonstrated that the N-linked sugars on the M protein play an important role in the induction of IFN\u2423 (Laude et al., 1992) . The availability of the recombinant MHVs allowed us to investigate the influence of the M protein glycosylation state on the interferogenic capacity of these viruses. For this purpose we infected LMR cells, which are porcine cells susceptible to MHV due to their constitutive expression of the MHV receptor , with the different recombinant MHVs. LMR cells were chosen since they can also be infected with TGEV, which served as a positive control. LMR monolayers were infected with low (0.1) and high (10) multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.). After fixation at 9.5 h postinfection the cell monolayers were incubated overnight with porcine PBM cells. Serial 2-fold dilutions of the culture media were subsequently assayed for antiviral activity (i.e., IFN\u2423 activity) on LMR cells using vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) as a challenge virus. The IFN produced by the porcine PBM cells has been characterized as type I IFN, as it was neutralized for more than 90% by an antitype I IFN antiserum (Charley and Laude, 1988; La Bonnardiere et al., 1986 ). Fig. 3 shows the results from two typical experiments. LMR cells infected with Alb248 and Alb250 (O \u03ea N \u03e9 ) reproducibly induced the highest type I IFN activity, after infection at both low and high m.o.i. The interferogenic capacity of these monolayers was almost as high as that of the cells infected with TGEV, the positive control. The interferogenic activity of Alb138 and Alb139 (O \u03e9 N \u03ea ) was reproducibly lower (5-to 30-fold) than that of Alb248 and 250 (O \u03ea N \u03e9 ), whereas Alb244-and Alb246-(O \u03ea N \u03ea ) infected cells displayed an even lower interferogenic capacity (30-to 200-fold), especially at m.o.i. 0.1. Each pair of independent recombinant viruses behaved almost identically in the IFN assay, further demonstrating the reproducibility of the assay.",

It was therefore necessary to confirm that the effects we observed were not due simply to differences in M protein expression levels. Unfortunately, the amino acid changes in the ectodomain of the M protein are known to affect the antigenicity of this domain of the M protein (de Haan et al., 1998b) , which would make interpretation of M protein antigen levels exposed by the cells troublesome. As an alternative control the fixed monolayers, used to induce IFN synthesis by the PBM cells, were immunocytochemically studied for MHV infection. The different recombinant MHVs appeared to have infected the LMR cells to the same extent (data not shown). Additionally, MHV-infected LMR cells were labeled with 35 S-labeled amino acids, lysed and processed for immunoprecipitation using the anti-MHV serum that contains antibodies to domains other than the ectodomain, including the endodomain (Rottier et al., 1981 (Rottier et al., , 1990 .

At 9.5 h postinfection cells were fixed with 3% formaldehyde. PBM cells were induced to produce IFN\u2423 by overnight incubation at 37\u00b0C on the TGEVor MHV-infected, fixed cells. Supernatants were collected and serial twofold dilutions were assayed for IFN in an infection inhibition assay on LMR cells using VSV as a challenge virus. For each type of recombinant the mean value is shown, and the standard deviation is indicated.

Quantitation of the M protein expression levels, using a phosphorimager, indicated that the N-glycosylated, O-glycosylated, and unglycosylated M proteins were all expressed at similar levels (data not shown). These two controls, together with the knowledge that neither the ectodomain of the M protein nor its glycosylation is important for M protein intracellular transport (de Haan et al., 1998a (de Haan et al., , 1998b Mayer et al., 1988; Rottier et al., 1990) , led us to conclude that the differences in the induction of IFN can not be the result of different levels of M protein exposure at the cell surface. The most likely explanation for the differences found are the different glycosylation states of the M proteins. Thus, coronaviruses containing M proteins with N-linked sugars induced type I IFN to higher levels than viruses carrying O-glycosylated M proteins. MHVs in which the M proteins are unglycosylated appeared to be poor IFN inducers.",

When mice were inoculated intranasally with a low dose (1 \u03eb 10 3 PFU), virus could never be detected in the brain, but was detected in the liver, in approximately half of the animals. The recombinant viruses appeared to replicate in the liver to a different extent, MHV-Alb248 (O \u03ea N \u03e9 ) being able to replicate to the highest titers (data not shown). These results, however, did not differ significantly and therefore prompted us to study viral replication in the liver in a more controllable way by intraperitoneal inoculation. Mice were inoculated with 1 \u03eb 10 5 PFU, and replication in the liver was determined at day 4 postinfection. As Fig. 5A reveals, Alb248 (O \u03ea N \u03e9 ) appeared to replicate to a much higher extent than Alb138 (O \u03e9 N \u03e9 ), which in turn, replicated slightly better than Alb244 (O \u03ea N \u03ea ). Statistical analysis done by Student's t test revealed the significance of the differences between the titers (Fig. 5A) . Similar results were obtained with the other, independently generated recombinant viruses, which confirms the observed phenotypes. The results could further be confirmed by immunohistochemical analysis of the livers (Fig. 5B) . To this end, liver samples were fixed in phosphate-buffered formalin, embedded in paraffin, sectioned, and stained with hematoxylin. Viral antigen was detected with the polyclonal anti-MHV serum. A number of small lesions were seen in the livers of mice infected with Alb138 or Alb244. Lesions appeared slightly larger and showed larger necrotic centers after infection with Alb138. In animals infected with Alb248, hepatocellular degeneration and necrosis were so extreme that lesions were no longer separated. These results, reproduced in independent experiments, clearly demonstrated that MHV expressing M proteins with N-linked sugars replicated to a higher extent in the liver than MHV carrying O-linked sugars. MHV containing M proteins without any sugars replicated to the lowest extent.",

Also, when we measured the IFN\u2423 levels in livers of mice that had been infected with recombinant viruses carrying N-glycosylated or unglycosylated M proteins using a mouse IFN\u2423-specific ELISA, very similar IFN levels were observed both at day 1 and at day 3 postinfection (Fig. 6) . Apparently, although the glycosylation status of the coronavirus M protein modulates the interferogenic capacity of the viruses in the in vitro assay, the induction of IFN\u2423 in vivo does not appear to be affected. Finally, we analyzed whether the differences in viral replication in the liver might be explained by different sensitivities of the recombinant viruses to IFN\u2423. Therefore, the antiviral activity of IFN\u2423 against the three types of viruses was analyzed on LR7 cells, taking VSV along as a control.

The oligosaccharides exposed on the coronavirus M protein thus constitute a diffuse, hydrophilic cover on the outer surface of the virion. Oligosaccharide types and their attachment sites on polypeptides are ultimately defined by the viral genome. Due to the lack of editing functions in the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, replication of the coronaviral genome is prone to mutation at a high frequency. Nevertheless, a remarkably wellconserved dichotomy exists among coronaviruses with respect to the type of M protein glycosylation, which prompted us to search for the presumed function of these sugars. To this end, we used targeted recombination to generate mutant MHVs carrying M proteins that were Oglycosylated, N-glycosylated, or not glycosylated at all. Although no differences were observed between these recombinant viruses when grown in cell culture, in mice glycosylation appeared to influence the ability of the recombinant viruses to replicate in the liver but not in the brain. The glycosylation state of the recombinant viruses also affected the interferogenic capacity of fixed, virus-infected cells in a way that correlated with the extent of viral replication in the liver and, hence, with the degree of hepatic pathology. However, when the interferogenic capacity of the recombinant viruses in the liver was determined, no differences were observed.",

The M protein glycosylation state did not influence the tissue culture growth characteristics of the recombinant viruses in several cell types, nor did it affect replication in the mouse brain (de Haan et al., 2002; this study) . These results confirm and extend previous studies, using either glycosylation inhibitors or a viruslike particle assembly system, which demonstrated that glycosylation of the M protein does not play an appreciable role in virion assembly (de Haan et al., 1998a) . In addition, both for MHV (strain RI) and TGEV, mutants have been described that contain unglycosylated M proteins. Their M proteins have disrupted O-or N-glycosylation motifs, respectively. The TGEV mutant was demonstrated to replicate efficiently in vitro (Laude et al., 1992) , whereas MHV-RI appeared to differ from other MHV strains in its inability to use an isoform of the MHV receptor (mmCGM 2 or CEACAM1b) (Compton, 1994) . Since the recombinant viruses generated in this study were able to use this MHV receptor isoform to infect the same cells (data not shown), the result obtained with MHV-RI is not due to the lack of O-linked sugars on its M protein but can probably be attributed to mutations in its S protein. Recently, MHV-2 was demonstrated to carry both N-linked and O-linked sugars at its M protein, indicating that both types of glycosylation can occur side by side on the same M protein (Yamada et al., 2000) , as we had observed as well (de Haan et al., 1998a) .",

Apparently, the difference in their hepatitis inducing abilities does not result from the recombinant viruses having different replication kinetics. Previously, Navas et al.

Since the S protein is the viral attachment protein and mediates virus-cell fusion this is not surprising. However, we now show that, in addition to the S protein, mutations in the M protein that alter the glycosylation state of the protein affect, in a still unknown way, the outcome of infection in the liver. The strong hepatotropism of MHV-2, although mainly determined by the S protein, may therefore be supported by the attachment of sugars to the M protein both via O-and N-linkages (Navas et al., 2001; Yamada et al., 2000) .",

They are produced by cells in response to stimulation with several agents, including viruses, bacteria, and synthetic nucleic acids. The induction of type I interferons (IFNs) by most RNA viruses is initiated by virus-derived double-stranded RNA. In addition, many enveloped viruses are able to stimulate, via their glycoproteins, type I IFN production by dendritic cells (Fitzgerald-Bocarsly, 1993; Ito, 1994; Milone and Fitzgerald-Bocarsly, 1998; Siegal et al., 1999) . We now demonstrate for MHV that the glycosylation state of the M protein plays an important role in the induction of type I IFNs in vitro. MHVs in which the M proteins were unglycosylated appeared to be poor IFN inducers compared to MHVs containing glycosylated M proteins. Attachment of oligosaccharide side chains to the M protein via N-linkage resulted in a higher interferogenic capacity than when attached via O-linkage. These results confirm and extend previous studies that demonstrated that several coronaviruses, including MHV, BCoV and TGEV, were able to induce IFN\u2423 by their glycoproteins (Baudoux et al., 1998a (Baudoux et al., , 1998b . For TGEV, the oligosaccharides N-linked to the M protein were demonstrated to be important for efficient IFN\u2423 induction. Mutations in the M protein ectodomain that impaired N-glycosylation decreased the interferogenic activity (Laude et al., 1992) , whereas antibodies directed to the TGEV M ectodomain blocked IFN\u2423 induction (Charley and Laude, 1988) . The TGEV M protein by itself is not able to induce IFN (Baudoux et al., 1998a (Baudoux et al., , 1998b . It needs to be coexpressed with its assembly partner E, which suggests that the induction of IFN\u2423 is dependent on a specific, probably regularly organized structure of the M protein.",

            "text": "Strikingly, the extent of viral replication in the liver of the different recombinant viruses appeared to correlate with the different interferogenic capacities of the viruses in vitro. These observations seem paradoxical since type I IFNs play an important role in the host defence against viral infections (Muller et al., 1994) , whereas several other studies have demonstrated the protective effect of type I IFNs on MHV infection in mice (Aurisicchio et al., 2000; Matsuyama et al., 2000; Smith et al., 1987; Uetsuka et al., 1996) . We observed no differences in the sensitivities of our recombinant viruses to IFN\u2423 when analyzed in vitro. Furthermore, we also detected no differences in IFN levels in mouse sera and in liver after inoculation of mice with the different MHV recombinants. Apparently, the different interferogenic capacities of fixed, virus-infected cells in vitro do not necessarily reflect the interferogenic capacities of the replicating viruses in vivo. The different abilities of the recombinant viruses to replicate in the liver are difficult to explain. We speculate that they might correlate with differences in the binding of the viruses to hepatic lectins and, consequently, with their hepatic targeting efficiencies. The induction and production of IFN\u2423 in peripheral blood dendritic cells by several enveloped viruses is mediated by the mannose receptor (Milone and Fitzgerald-Bocarsly, 1998) . This receptor is a so-called pattern-recognition receptor (Stahl and Ezekowitz, 1998) , which has been implicated in the nonspecific recognition of enveloped viruses as well as of other pathogens (Milone and Fitzgerald-Bocarsly, 1998; Stahl and Ezekowitz, 1998) . The mannose receptor is also expressed on liver sinusoidal endothelium, where it is an essential regulator of serum glycoprotein homeostasis (Lee et al., 2002) . By recognizing their carbohydrates-supposed to function as tags-the receptor appears to target serum glycoproteins for degradation in the liver. Consequently, it is conceivable that the differential recognition of the differently glycosylated MHV recombinants by hepatic lectins such as the mannose receptor modulates the extent of viral replication in the liver in proportion to the in vitro interferogenic capacities of the viruses.",

An M gene mutant of pFV1, encoding the substitutions T4A and T5A, was made by transfer of the mutations from the previously described plasmid pTUG3-M-A 4 A 5 (de Haan et al., 1998a) . A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) product was obtained from pTUG3-M-A 4 A 5 with primer PM303 (5\u0408ATCTAATCCAAACAT-TATGAGTAGT3\u0408), which produces half of the EcoRV site immediately upstream of the M coding region, and primer LK10 (5\u0408CAACAATGCGGTGTCCGCGCCAC3\u0408), which is complementary to the 3\u0408 end of the M coding region. The PCR product was restricted with BssHII and ligated in place of the EcoRV-BssHII fragment of pFV1 to produce plasmids pCM1 and pCM2. An M gene mutant of pFV1 designated M-N 2 N 3 , encoding an M protein in which Ser2 was replaced by two Asn residues in addition to the substitutions T4A and T5A, was generated by PCR using primer 932 (5\u0408CAAACATTATGAACAACAGTGCTGCTCAGG3\u0408), which directs the desired mutations, and primer 509 (5\u0408GTCTAACATACACGGTACCTTTC3\u0408), corresponding to a unique KpnI site in the M gene, and cloned into pTUG3 in a similar way as described for M gene mutant M-A 4 A 5 (de Haan et al., 1998a) . The mutations were transferred from pTUG3-M-N 2 N 3 into pFV1 via a PCR product obtained with primers PM304 (5\u0408ATCTAATC-CAAACATTATGAACAACAGT3\u0408) and LK10. The PCR product was restricted with BssHII and ligated in place of the EcoRV-BssHII fragment of pFV1 to produce plasmids pCM3 and pCM4.

Mice were anesthetized with Isoflurane (IsoFlo; Abbott Laboratories, North Chicago, IL). Viruses were diluted using PBS containing 0.75% bovine serum albumin. A volume of 25 l was used for injection into the left cerebral hemisphere. Five animals were analyzed for each dose of virus.

For analysis of viral replication in the liver, 8-week-old C57BI/6 mice were inoculated by injection of 100-l virus dilution into the intraperitoneal cavity. Mice were sacrificed and the livers were removed at day 4 postinfection. Livers were placed in 1.5 ml DMEM, weighed, and then frozen at \u03ea80\u00b0C until titered for virus. Virus titers were determined by plaque assay on LR7 cell monolayers following homogenization of the organs. For immunohistochemical analysis, the liver samples were fixed in phosphate-buffered formalin, embedded in paraffin, sectioned, and stained with hematoxylin. Viral antigen was detected with k134 at a 1:400 dilution. Peroxidase-conjugated swine immunoglobulins to rabbit immunoglobulins (Dakopatts) were used as secondary antibodies at a 1:100 dilution. Peroxidase was visualized using diaminobenzidine.",
