We demonstrated that CQ affects the activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). Furthermore, p38 MAPK inhibitor, SB203580, inhibits CPE induced by HCoV-229E infection and viral replication. Our findings suggest that CQ affects the activation of MAPKs, involved in the replication of HCoV-229E.",

CQ (10 and 25 M) inhibited the release of HCoV-229E into supernatants significantly in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1a) . Since CQ has both prophylactic and therapeutic antiviral effects for SARS-CoV (Vincent et al., 2005) , its effect on the internalization of HCoV-229E into cells was evaluated. We quantified the HCoV-229E RNA incorporated into the cells at 3h post infection by real-time RT-PCR. The ratios of viral mRNA to 18s rRNA in the reactive units of quantitative real-time PCR were determined. The amount of viral RNA incorporated into the cells was not significantly influenced by CQ (Fig. 1b) . These data demonstrate that CQ has no influence on the process prior to the internalization of HCoV-229E into L132 cells.",

Additionally, our results revealed that CQ inhibits the activation of p38 MAPK in HCoV-229E-infected cells and evokes the activation of ERK independently of infection. Our study demonstrated that CQ inhibits the activation of p38 and SB203580 (p38 inhibitor) suppresses viral replication. This suggests that CQ may inhibit the CoV replication by suppressing the p38 activation.",
