The Integrated Urban Hydro-Meteorological, Climate and Environmental Services and systems are a new initiative from the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) that seeks to provide science-based integrated urban services supporting safe, healthy and resilient cities. Various cities have already started development and implementation of such Integrated Urban Services and successfully test and use them following specific requirements of local stakeholders. This paper demonstrates the novel concept and approach of Integrated Urban Hydro-Meteorological, Climate and Environmental Services (IUS) from a set of four case study cities: Hong Kong, Toronto, Mexico City and Paris, that use different IUS configurations with good existing practice. These cities represent a range of countries, climates and geophysical settings. The aggregate main joint similarities of the IUS in these cities and synergy of the cities' experience, achievements and research findings are presented, as well as identification of existing gaps in knowledge and further research needs. A list of potential criteria for identifying and classifying IUS demonstration cities is proposed. It will aid future, more detailed analysis of the IUS experience, and selection of additional demonstration cities.",

These alterations to the atmosphere from urban to global scales have consequent impacts on human health and the environment. But the urban setting also provides exciting opportunities for scientific advancement in the field of new observations, data assimilation, high resolution coupled modeling and user-specific systems and services for sustainable and climate smart cities.",

They are essential to provide context and support for urban analyses and model applications addressing issues, including policy requirements, urban planning and assessments, emergency response, human behavior, etc. Development of urban database tools, like the World Urban Database and Access Portal Tools (WUDAPT; www.wudapt.org) is extremely important. WUDAPT (Ching et al., 2018) is an international community-based initiative to acquire and disseminate climate relevant data on the physical geographies of cities for modeling and analyses purposes. The current lacuna of globally consistent information on cities is a major impediment to urban climate science towards informing and developing climate mitigation and adaptation strategies at urban scales. WUDAPT consists of a database and a portal system; its database is structured into a hierarchy representing different levels of detail and data are acquired using innovative protocols that utilize crowdsourcing approaches, Geowiki tools, freely accessible data, and building typology archetypes. The base level of information (Level 0, or L0), categorizes and maps city landscapes into Local Climate Zones (LCZ), each category of which is associated with a range of values for model relevant surface descriptors (e.g. roughness, impervious surface cover, roof area, building heights, etc.). L0 data and the protocol for acquisition, storage and dissemination is best developed and provides a framework for gathering other data. WUDAPT Levels 1 (L1) and 2 (L2) will provide values for other relevant descriptors at greater precision, such as data morphological forms, material composition data and energy usage.",

The conceptual and methodological part of the Guide was recently issued (WMO, 2018) and adopted in June 2018 by the WMO Executive Council. It documents the best available knowledge, principles, integration methods and practices for producing and providing the relevant services cities require to respond to the hazards posed by extreme weather, severe pollution episodes and climate change. The guide includes a multidisciplinary approach (i.e., not just meteorological agencies) to better serve the social-economic needs of urban areas, and identifies the required A. Baklanov, et al. Urban Climate 32 (2020) 100610 partnerships to establish and sustain urban services, including research, city governments, international organizations, and private sector stakeholders. The combination of hazards and risk factors can be different for different cities. They depend on geographical (e.g., coastal, river, mountainous, polar, deserts and others) and geophysical (e.g., fault lines, volcanoes, dust storm, fire danger, space weather and others) factors, climate conditions and the existing environment of the city itself. In general, Integrated Urban Services include monitoring and prediction for physical and environmental impacts (WMO, 2018) and should include also societal impact predictions, as presented in Table 1 .",

The advent of automatic weather station (AWS) networks of HKO and other government departments since the mid-1980s has significantly expanded data coverage both in terms of spatial and temporal resolution with over 200 AWSs providing a wide range of meteorological measurements (e.g. rainfall, temperatures, winds, etc.). Regular upper-air soundings and the increasing availability of high-resolution remote sensing observations (e.g. Doppler weather radar, wind profilers, LIDARs (light detection and ranging), satellite reception systems, etc.) also enable the monitoring of meteorological parameters beyond the near-surface levels through the depth of the atmosphere. The implementation of the Community Weather Information Network (Co-WIN) in 2007 further extended the meteorological measurement network to the school and community levels (Tam and Ong, 2012). EPD has been monitoring the air quality in Hong Kong since 1990, and currently Baklanov, et al. Urban Climate 32 (2020) 100610 operates a network of 16 air quality monitoring stations in Hong Kong (EPD, 2018) .

ECCC and the University of Toronto have successfully built a high-resolution (2.5 \u00d7 2.5 km 2 ) emission inventory 'SOCE' (Southern Ontario Carbon Emission) for CO 2 based on air quality emission maps for the TO15 domain (Pugliese et al., 2018) . Significant differences of up to 40% for total annual emissions were found in the urban domain when compared to existing inventories. In comparison, the climate action plan for the city of Toronto is to reduce GHG emissions by 30% between 1990 and 2010. Furthermore, the contribution of different emission categories is also significantly different as e.g. SOCE predicts traffic to contribute 24 MTCO 2 a \u22121 , while EDGAR V4.2 (EDGAR, 2010) predicts nearly twice the amount, i.e. 41 MTCO 2 a \u22121 . To build confidence and investigate the differences in these emission datasets we compared their ability to correctly predict atmospheric CO 2 concentrations. As a benchmark, a forward simulation using an air-quality model was compared to CO 2 observations at ECCC sites, i.e. the mean daily cycle for winter 2016. Pugliese et al. (2018) showed that the novel SOCE inventory displays the best performance with only minor deviations from observed atmospheric CO 2 at the Downsview measurement site as seen in Fig. 7 .",

A cool dry season from November to February is followed by a warm dry season until May and a rainy season from June to October.

These conditions promote photochemical processes that induce the formation of ozone and other oxidants as well as an increase of secondary aerosol loadings through chemical reactions, dust and biomass burning. Weak winds and strong temperature inversions at night also lead to high primary pollutant concentrations during rush hour that persist into the morning, followed by very rapid boundary layer growth to about 2 to 4 km in the early afternoon. As a consequence, there is relatively little recirculation or day-to-day carry-over of pollutants within the basin. The dry cool season has stronger surface inversions and higher morning concentrations of primary pollutants. The rainy season has lower particulate matter but continues to have relatively high ozone concentration due to intense photochemical reactions occurring before the afternoon showers. Air pollution is therefore a year round concern for the residents of the MCMA (Molina et al., 2007 (Molina et al., , 2010 .",

Using a complete vegetation and soil model to represent green roofs, De Munck et al. (2018) showed that green roofs would not have a significant effect on air temperature at street level, contrary to ground vegetation and trees. Impacts on hydrology are now included in the model (Stavropulos-Laffaille et al., 2018) and will allow study of the combined UHI-hydrology impacts on Paris and its suburbs. The model developments also permitted testing of implementing alternative urban energy systems; Masson et al. (2014b) showed that solar panels could be widely implemented without adverse effect on the UHI (where a slight cooling, of approximately 0.2\u00b0C, was simulated). Air conditioning can increase night-time temperatures in more densely built parts of Paris by more than 1\u00b0C (De Munck et al., 2013) , so a Building Energy Module is also a desirable component of the modeling system to evaluate anthropogenic heat fluxes to the atmosphere. Energetic human behavior has been including in TEB (Schoetter et al., 2017) thanks to a collaboration with sociologists ). The modeling system then permits testing the impacts of not only changes to the character of the urban structure (insulation), but also eventually, societal change, such as aging of the population, who may demand greater use of building cooling during summertime. This emphasizes the interdisciplinary interactions that are needed to study the urban system and build UCS.",

Urban-scale greenhouse gas studies provide additional scope for IUS that try to link stakeholder demand with existing technical skills. An improved understanding of GHG emissions from combustion sources can also lead to a better prediction of air pollutants that are co-emitted in the same process. For example, the ability to identify leakages of CH 4 and related VOCs in an urban area that can have significant impact on air quality (increased ozone levels) and thus important health implications. Greenhouse gas studies in Paris (France), Indianapolis, Los Angeles, Salt Lake City (USA), Recife (Brazil) (Staufer et al., 2016; Turnbull et al., 2015; Newman et al., 2016; Wu et al., 2016) have contributed to efforts under WMO's IG3IS (https://ig3is.wmo.int/) and the CO2-USA (http://sites.bu.edu/co2usa) network. Work can range from simple surveys of atmospheric GHGs to identification of major GHG sources to long-term monitoring to track emission changes and even into processspecific studies. It is obvious that GHG are targeted by many policies to achieve the Paris agreement, but beyond this they are also an important puzzle piece in the IUS approach that is intrinsically linked with understanding urban circulation (weather) and air pollutants.",

Assessment of integration can also vary for different components of an IUS so that the same city may receive multiple categorizations. A crude categorization by quadrants (Q) recognizes IUS with low levels of integration on either axis (Q1), strong integration across sectors, so a city with partners, but reliant on simple data provision (Q2), a more comprehensive integration of data products from service providers tuned to urban needs but without a lot of urban partners (Q3) and, at its most mature, maximum integration on both axes (Q4), which represents specialized products developed collaboratively with urban partners (WMO, 2019). Table 3 shows the level of integration according to these quadrants. Not surprisingly, the case study cities show maturity of IUS (Q4) in at least one component of their IUS. In Hong Kong, the Hong Kong Observatory partnered with the Environmental Protection Department and other government departments to create an integrated system where users are supported by various weather, climate and environmental services through a combination of communication approaches (Fig. 2) . Mexico City's C5 Centre provides a broad mechanism for communication of hazards to the public. In Toronto, a major international sporting event provided the opportunity to build initial relations with select end users (event organizers, security, and public health) and to facilitate partnerships among government agencies at different levels. However, the legacy of these relations and partnerships has to be strengthened and organized, and gaps were noted in the training and ability of local agencies to use research outputs provided by forecasters. In Paris, urban planning elements of the IUS directed towards modeling for climate change adaptation was most advanced, with research projects providing the basis for integration among sectors with incorporation of researchers from different academic backgrounds providing key input on the research.
