Nodular or diffuse infiltration of the posterior or anterior uveal tract is possible. Although isolated ocular lymphosarcoma is rare, many cats present primarily for ocular signs. A search for neoplastic involvement of other organs should be made. Cats with lymphosarcoma should be staged (I-V) and FeLV status should be determined because both are related to treatment response and prognosis (see Chapter 68). Ocular involvement is by definition stage V lymphosarcoma. Aqueous humor cytology may be diagnostic in cases in which obvious lymphosarcoma cannot be identified in other organs. Testing for FeLV is always indicated in cats with uveitis whether or not lymphosarcoma is suspected, because opportunistic infection may be present. The enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for detection of the p27 antigen in the blood (serum) is a useful screening tool for FeLV, but a positive immunofluorescent assay (lFA) correlates better with persistent viremia (see Chapter 76). A positive FeLV test does not prove ocular disease due to the virus, nor does a negative test rule out lymphosarcoma. Most FeLV-positive cats do not have lymphosarcoma, and 20-70% of cats with confirmed lymphosarcoma are FeLV-negative.",

Cats with ocular toxoplasmosis may be seropositive for IgM and seronegative for IgG, particularly if they are FIV-seropositive. Detection of local antibody production or T. gondii DNA in aqueous humor may aid in the diagnosis of ocular toxoplasmosis (Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory, College of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, Colorado State University, Fort Collins. CO). 15. What are the ocular signs of FIP? Bilateral granulomatous anterior uveitis may be present. Clinical findings range from iritis, large keratic precipitates, clots of fibrin and blood in the anterior chamber, pyogranulomatous cuffing of the retinal vasculature, and chorioretinitis to retinal hemorrhage and retinal detachment. 16. Are ocular lesions most often seen with the effusive or noneffusive form of FIP? Ocular lesions are most often seen with the noneffusive, or dry form of FIP. Uveitis 17. How do you diagnose FIP? Diagnosis of FIP-associated ocular disease is difficult because of the nonspecific nature of available coronavirus serum antibody tests. Positive coronavirus serum antibodies document only exposure to coronavirus and do not correlate with FlP. In addition, results of blood reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) do not correlate with FIP. Characteristic ocular lesions in the presence of rising serum antibody titers suggest the diagnosis particularly, if the appropriate signalment and history are also present (see Chapter 38). If effusions are present, characteristic findings aid in the diagnosis of FIP (see Chapter 38).",

This form of treatment should be used only in cases of severe intraocular inflammation as an adjunct to topical or systemic steroids or in cases in which frequent topical therapy is not possible.
