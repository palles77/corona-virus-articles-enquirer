Viruses were detected in 57.6% (320/556) of moderate-to-severe ILI episodes, of which approximately one-third were influenza A. RSV, rhinovirus/enterovirus, coronavirus, and human metapneumovirus were also important pathogens in this age group, with RSV detected in 7.4% of samples. Moderate-to-severe ILI episodes that were RSV-positive were more likely to result in hospitalization than other viral respiratory infections; however, influenza vaccination may have attenuated the severity of influenza A in the study population. The virus detection rate of 57.6% in this study is higher than what has been reported in a number of previous studies [6] and can be at least partially explained by the use of a sensitive multiplex RT-PCR, which can detect 18 different viruses and subtypes. However, it is important to recognize that multiplex RT-PCR may have different analytic sensitivities for the different viruses, which can affect the diagnostic yield. In addition, viral load may vary for specific viral infections with RSV viral load typically low in the upper airways of adults [5, 17, 18] . Another factor that may explain the variability of virus detection rates in the literature is the clinical definition used to trigger swab collection and further laboratory testing. There is currently no universally accepted definition of all ILI or moderate-to-severe ILI, in particular in the elderly population where the clinical presentation may be atypical. We attempted to define moderate-tosevere ILI using objective and subjective criteria, which we felt were relevant to respiratory illnesses rather than minor colds. Fever occurs less commonly in the elderly; our definition of ILI, which did not require the presence of fever, is an important difference from other studies using ILI definitions to evaluate noninfluenza viruses. The inclusion of fever as an obligatory part of the ILI case definition would have excluded around 30%-60% of cases, depending on virus type. The majority of subjects with moderate-to-severe ILI were identified by an ISS >2. Although every attempt was made to capture all cases, proportionally more swabs (up to 44%) were missed from episodes with pneumonia and hospitalization. This may mean that subjects presenting with an ILI that resulted in pneumonia deteriorated so rapidly that no swab could be collected in time. Thus, our data may have missed part of the most severe spectrum of disease (no deaths occurred in the test cohort). Of note, as per protocol, swabs were only to be taken if an ILI occurred. A subject presenting with pneumonia without a preceding ILI as per the protocol definition, would have had no swab taken.
