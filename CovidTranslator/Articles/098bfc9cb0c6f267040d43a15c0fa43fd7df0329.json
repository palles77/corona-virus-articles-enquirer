            "text": "Medical records and magnetic resonance (MR) images of 14 cats with inflammatory diseases affecting the central nervous system (CNS) were reviewed retrospectively. Cases included eight cats with feline infectious peritonitis and two cats with toxoplasmosis. Abnormalities affecting the CNS were observed in MR images in 10 (71%) cats. Intracranial lesions appeared as slightly hypointense foci in T1-weighted images in two (14%) cats, as hyperintense foci in T2-weighted images in seven (50%) cats and as hyperintense foci after intravenous administration of a gadolinium-based contrast medium in 10 (71%) cats. In six cats with lesions in T1-and/or T2-weighted images, additional lesions were visible in T1-weighted images obtained after gadolinium-based contrast medium administration. In three cats, lesions were visible only after contrast medium administration. In our study, MR imaging (MRI) did not appear to detect all cases of CNS inflammation in the population of cats with inflammatory cerebrospinal fluid (CSF); however, MRI adds information about the sites and morphology of intracranial lesions that should help to distinguish between neoplasia and inflammatory conditions and, possibly, between different inflammatory conditions. M eningoencephalitis in cats is most frequently associated with infections, including feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) and toxoplasmosis (Foley et al 1998 , Gunn-Moore 2005 . In a recent histological review of tissues from 286 cats with neurological disorders, 92 (32%) had inflammatory and/or infectious lesions affecting the central nervous system (CNS) (Bradshaw et al 2004) . Of these, 47 (51%) had FIP, 33 (36%) had non-specific encephalitis or meningitis, eight (9%) had protozoal tissue cysts (presumed to represent toxoplasmosis) and one (1%) had cryptococcosis (Bradshaw et al 2004) . Other reported causes of meningoencephalitis include feline immunodeficiency virus (Gunn-Moore et al 1996) , mycosis (Lavely and Lipsitz 2005) , immune-mediated (Rand et al 1994b) and extension of bacterial infection from the inner or middle ear (Foley et al 1998) .",

Although increased CSF white cell count and protein concentration can occur secondary to other pathological conditions, such as neoplasia (Rand et al 1994a) , animals with confirmed CNS inflammatory disease rarely have normal CSF, hence it is a sensitive but nonspecific test (Rand et al 1994b) .",

In animals with CNS signs, MRI may be used before CSF collection to identify any intracranial mass that may be considered a contraindication for subarachnoid puncture, or to gain more information in animals with non-specific CSF results. Potential MRI findings in cats with inflammatory conditions include hydrocephalus, ependymal, neural or meningeal enhancement in T1-weighted images after gadolinium-based contrast medium intravenous administration and focal, diffuse or multifocal hyperintensity in T2-weighted images (Foley et al 1998 , Mellema et al 2002 , Pfohl and Dewey 2005 ; however, this is a lightly documented subject.

Two cats had material in the tympanic cavity compatible with otitis media; one of these had no intracranial signs, but the other had a focal lesion affecting the metencephalon and adjacent meninges and a diagnosis of bacterial meningitis.

For this reason, it has been suggested that only positive serum titres >1:1600 should be considered indicative of FIP (Hartmann et al 2003) . The dry form of FIP is said to have relatively high FCoV antibody titres and to be rarely seronegative (Foley et al 1998 , Green 2006 ; however, cats with neurological FIP can have negative serum titres (Kline et al 1994 , Baroni and Heinold 1995 , Foley et al 1998 . This was observed in four of seven (57%) cats with histologically confirmed FIP in the present study. One reason for negative titres in cats with FIP may be that immune complexes already conjugated with the body's antibodies cannot be recognised by immunological tests (Green 2006) . Positive CSF antibody titres were found in both cats with toxoplasmosis.",

Although the number of patients is insufficient for firm conclusions about the sensitivity of MRI, it is apparent that a negative MR scan cannot rule out presence of neurological FIP, as only half the cats with FIP had lesions in MR images. MRI did not appear to detect all cases of CNS inflammation in the population of cats in our study with CSF findings suggestive of CNS inflammation; however, MRI adds information about the sites and morphology of intracranial lesions that helps to distinguish both between neoplasia and inflammatory conditions and, to some extent, between different inflammatory conditions. Compared to computed tomography (CT) (Plummer et al 1992) , MRI is thought to have slightly higher overall sensitivity . Increased sensitivity for multiple lesions and meningeal enhancement makes MR more likely than CT to enable identification of the signs that aid differentiation of intracranial inflammation from neoplasia.",

This observation reflects the typical histological distribution of FIP lesions, which principally involve the inner and outer surfaces of the brain (Summers et al 1995) . Ventricular dilation in cats with FIP may reflect abnormal CSF drainage, as dilated ventricles have been always observed in association with meningeal and/or ependymal involvement, two structures largely involved in CSF flow regulation (Summers et al 1995) . Ventricular dilation may lead to increased intracranial pressure and cerebellar herniation through the foramen magnum. In MR images the cerebellum is usually considered herniated when the caudal tip of the vermis is within the foramen magnum; this is best assessed in sagittal images. Cerebellar herniation was observed in three of five cats with ventricular dilation in the present study. Anecdotal evidence suggests that there is marked variability in the shape of the cerebellar vermis in cats, which may complicate the assessment of herniation. Further studies, with larger numbers, are necessary to validate the MR assessment of the cerebellum in cats.",
