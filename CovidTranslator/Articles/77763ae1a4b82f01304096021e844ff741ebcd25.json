The vaccine was found to be safe and eficacious in one population of cats that had low antibody titre against feline coronavirus (FCo V) at the time of vaccination. Although clinically healthy at the time of vaccination, retrospectively some vaccinees that later came down with FIP were found to be RT-PCR positive for FCoV in plasma and showed changes in blood parameters consistent with early stage of FIP. It is concluded that vaccination can protect cats with no or low FCoV antibody titres and that in some cats vaccine failure was probably due to pre-existing infection. 0 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.",

In Switzerland, infections with FCoV in domestic cats are widespread. About 80% of the cattery cats and 50% of all cats with access to outdoors were found to be seropositive3. Five to 12% of these develop lethal FWt. Certain cat populations seem to be more susceptible to FIP. Young cats are especially prone: 54% of all FIP cases affected cats younger than 12 months of age and 70% cats younger than 4 year?. A genetic disposition in certain breeds and in cheetahs was described5-', and cats living in multiple-cathouseholds such as catteries or cat shelters and cats with access to outdoors are more likely to get exposed to FCoV and develop FIP than animals from single-cathouseholds'.",

Antibodies to these FECV and the virulent FIP-causing viruses (feline infectious peritonitis virus: FIPV) do crossreact. These authors formulated the hypothesis that most of these seropositive cats are actually infected with FECV and that FIPV is just a mutant of FECV which has the ability to infect macrophages. At this time, no molecular or immunological differences are known between FECV and FIPV which can explain the difference of virulence between these coronaviruses\". Therefore, it appears to be justified to generally designate them as FCoV and to consider every FCoV infection in cats as a potential risk4,\".",

Two populations with a high risk for FCoV infection and FIP were included in this trial. The first population consisted of 138 cats from 15 catteries with FIP problems. In all of these catteries, FIP cases had occurred in the last 18 months prior the beginning of this trial either in the cattery itself or in kittens which had been re-homed to new owners. We expected that some of these cats had been already exposed to FCoV. The second population consisted of 609 cats < 12 months of age, which were vaccinated by veterinarians in Switzerland. As already mentioned, this 2ge group is more susceptible to FIP than older cat?,-. The cats of each population were further subdivided into two groups, vaccine and placebo, respectively, which were comparable regarding age, sex, breed and living conditions. Only clinically healthy cats older than 16 weeks of age were vaccinated and pregnant queens were excluded from the study. In week 0 and 3-4 weeks later the cats were vaccinated intranasally with either the coded vaccine or the placebo. After the vaccination the two coded groups were kept separately for 48 h to prevent spread of the vaccine virus to cats of the placebo group.",

In this study, the placebo and vaccine group were indistinguishable regarding distribution of age, sex and living conditions and no statistically significant difference in laboratory parameters (haematology, clinical chemistry, serology, CD4+/CD8+-lymphocyte subsets) were observed at the time of first vaccination.

It can be argued that in these three cats vaccine induced acceleration of FIP may have happened. However, if the incidence of FIP cases during the first 150 days after vaccination were compared in vaccinated vs placebo cats, there is absolutely no difference in that 12 cats in the vaccine group and 11 cats in the placebo group died during this time. In the population of the cattery cats where prevalence of FCoV antibodies was especially high (95%) the average time of death after vaccination was 3.5 weeks in the vaccine group and 20 weeks in the placebo group.

Not only the vaccine group, but also the placebo group showed an increase of titres in week 8 compared to week 0 and a decrease in week 30 compared to week 8 (Figure 1 ). Increase of antibodies could be explained by vaccination in the vaccine group, but not in the placebo group. As animals of the vaccine and placebo groups were separated for 48 h after the vaccination, spreading of the vaccine virus to cats of the placebo group seems unlikely. During the 8 weeks between vaccination and the collection of a second blood sample, antibody titres increased in cats of catteries, where FIP cases occurred. A similar rise of antibody titres was observed in cattery cats where no FIP cases were seen during this time period. It is well known, that stress can influence the immune system. Therefore, we speculate that the stress caused by the handling during vaccination and the collection of blood samples led to a weakening of the CM1 and to a reactivation of a persistent FCoV infection and an increase of the antibody titres. Surprisingly 50% of the clinically healthy pet cats younger than 12 months showed antibodies to FCoV (Figure 2) . Pure-bred cats showed higher titres and were more frequently seropositive for FCoV than domestic cats (Figure 3) , which is probably due to different living conditions.",

It can be concluded that the exposure to FCoV was extremely high for these cats. As these animals were vaccinated after they had already been housed in the shelter for some time, it can be concluded that most of the vaccine failures in this population were due to previous infection with FCoV. If cats with high FCoV antibody titres at the time of first vaccination (400 or higher) were excluded and only cats with titres of 100 or lower at the time of first vaccination were examined in our study, vaccination significantly decreased the incidence of FIP (P=O.O30) ( Figure 5 ). This observation suggests that low antibody titres are related with some degree of immunity, probably through a strong cell-mediated immune response via the Thl pathway35,36 and presumably with a lower virus load compared to cats with titres of 400 or higher. This interpretation would also be in agreement with the finding that high titres (in the placebo group) are associated with a higher risk for the development of FIP (Figure 4) .",
