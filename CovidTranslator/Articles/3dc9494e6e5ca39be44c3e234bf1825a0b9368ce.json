An effective vaccine has not yet been developed against this virus, despite considerable efforts in basic and clinical research. HRSV replication is independent of the nuclear RNA processing constraints, since the virus genes are adapted to the cytoplasmic transcription, a process performed by the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. This study shows that meaningful nuclear RNA polymerase II dependent expression of the HRSV nucleoprotein (N) and phosphoprotein (P) proteins can only be achieved with the optimization of their genes, and that the intracellular localization of N and P proteins changes when they are expressed out of the virus replication context. Immunization tests performed in mice resulted in the induction of humoral immunity using the optimized genes. This result was not observed for the non-optimized genes. In conclusion, optimization is a valuable tool for improving expression of HRSV genes in DNA vaccines.",

In both experiments, neither the N protein nor the P protein could be detected for plasmids containing the natural sequence of the genes. However, robust expression of both proteins was obtained after optimization. The study shows that these proteins are expressed in different intracellular localizations compared with HRSV infected cells.

As we can see in Fig. 4 , for three of five mice immunized with the optimized N gene, high antibody levels were generated against the N protein. On the other hand, for the mice immunized with the non-optimized N gene and for those in the N control cohort, unexpressive antibody levels were generated. Mice immunized with either the optimized or non-optimized P gene, presented low antibody levels; however, the immune response against the optimized P gene was higher than the immune response against the non-optimized gene. All mice of the P control group presented no significant antibody levels (Fig. 4) .",

(2007a,b) study of the HRSV F envelope protein and this study of the HRSV N and P nucleocapsid proteins; namely, without optimization of the genes, the expression of HRSV proteins by an RNA polymerase II dependent system is ineffective. Ternette et al. (2007a,b) showed that HRSV genes have several differences when compared with cellular genes. The evolution in the cytoplasmic environment causes the accumulation of numerous modifications in HRSV genes, which would be negatively selected if these genes were transcribed in the cell nucleus. The accumulation of premature polyadenylation sites for example, which hinder the synthesis of full mRNA, was shown to be a critical feature. As shown in this report, the premature poliadenilation sites of the N and P genes were reduced to zero after the optimization process and their CAI values were improved to approximately 0.9.",

The different cellular localizations, observed between the recombinant proteins and those expressed by HRSV, revealed that N and P proteins are unable to aggregate in inclusion bodies by themselves. It is known that the interaction of N, P and L proteins with the viral RNA and cellular structures form the inclusion bodies (Garc\u00eda et al., 1993) , but more studies are needed to fully understand their individual roles in this process.",

It is possible that the N protein may be interacting with cellular RNAs that are presented in the nucleus. The perinuclear localization can be explained by the interaction of the N protein with RNAs that are being exported from the nucleus, or that are being translated at the rough endoplasmic reticulum (Jansen, 2001) . It has been shown that the coronavirus N protein contains a nucleolar localization domain and that it can localize to the nucleus and affect cell division (Wurm et al., 2001) .
