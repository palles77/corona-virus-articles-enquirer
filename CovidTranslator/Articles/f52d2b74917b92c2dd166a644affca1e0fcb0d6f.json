Multilateral organizations are also called intergovernmental organizations and international organizations. Member States come together under a charter of rules and responsibilities they have drawn up and agreed on. Multilateral organizations may be regionally based (e.g., the European Union [EU] , the Association of South East Asian Nations [ASEAN]), organized around a common issue or function (e.g., the North Atlantic Treaty Organization [NATO] , the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries [OPEC]), or globally based (e.g., the United Nations [UN] ). Like sovereign states, they are recognized as having an established legal status under international law. The UN is the most well-known and largest of all of the multilateral organizations because its membership draws from nearly every nation, and because it covers a wide range of issues.",

In 2001, the UN General Assembly held a special session on HIV/AIDS and declared that through UNAIDS: [The UN would] develop and begin to implement national strategies that incorporate HIV/AIDS awareness, prevention, care, and treatment elements into programs or actions that respond to emergency situations, recognizing that populations destabilized by armed conflict, humanitarian emergencies, and natural disasters, including refugees, internally displaced persons, and in particular, women and children, are at increased risk of exposure to HIV infection; and, where appropriate, factor HIV/ AIDS components into international assistance programs. (UN 2005) \u2022 United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA). UNFPA works to promote basic human rights throughout the world, and to increase the possibilities of women and young people to lead healthy and productive lives. Their work focuses specifically on reproductive health and safe pregnancies and deliveries. During humanitarian crises, there is often a demand for reproductive health services even though distribution and health care systems have broken down. UNFPA works closely with its humanitarian relief partners to support early and effective action to meet the reproductive health needs of refugees, IDPs, and others caught in crisis situations. Supply shortages compound health risks in already dangerous situations and are a major obstacle to reproductive health in emergencies. Existing supplies may fall far short of demand when large numbers of people move into a safer location. Supplies, equipment, and medicine are organized and stored by UNFPA for immediate distribution when an earthquake, flood, violent conflict, or other crisis arises. A rapid-response fund enables UNFPA to mount a quick response to emergencies, especially in the initial stages. Supplies are packaged in 12 different emergency reproductive health kits, including a \"clean birthing kit.\" Once an emergency situation stabilizes, the procurement of reproductive health materials becomes a regular part of a more comprehensive healthcare program. \u2022 United Nations Human Settlement Programme (UN-Habitat) . UN-Habitat is mandated by the UN General Assembly to \"promote socially and environmentally sustainable towns and cities with the goal of providing adequate shelter for all\" (UN 2014). UN-Habitat is mandated through the Habitat Agenda (a global settlement plan adopted in June 1996 by the international community) to take the lead in mitigation, response, and post-disaster rehabilitation capabilities in human settlements. The Habitat Agenda clearly outlines the link between human settlement development and vulnerability to disasters. In addition, it emphasizes the need for coordination and close partnerships with national and local governments, as well as civil society. Finally, the Habitat Agenda recognizes the strong impact disasters have on women, and affirms the need for women's active involvement in disaster management. These steering principles underpin all normative and operational activities of the UN-Habitat Disaster Management Programme (DMP). DMP operates under the Disaster, Post-conflict and Safety Section (DPCSS), Urban Development Branch. It was created to marshal the resources of UN-Habitat and other international agencies to provide local government, civil society, and the private sector with practical strategies for mitigating and recovering from conflicts and natural disasters in the context of human settlements. Specific areas of attention include: \u2022 Protecting and rehabilitating housing, infrastructure, and public facilities \u2022 Providing technical and policy support to humanitarian agencies before and after crisis in the context of human settlements \u2022 Building partnerships and providing complementary expertise in resettlement of displaced persons and refugees \u2022 Restoring local social structures through settlement development \u2022 Rehabilitating local government structures and empowering civil society \u2022 Land and settlements planning and management for disaster prevention UN-Habitat launched the City Resilience Profiling Programme (CRPP) to support local government efforts to build capacity to reduce disaster risk. Through their guidance, governments are assisted in the development of comprehensive and integrated urban planning and implementation of a resilient management approach. The City Resilience Profile is a baseline assessment of a city-system's ability to withstand and recover from potential hazards. Examples of cities that have participated in the program include Balangoda, Sri Lanka; Barcelona, Spain; Beirut, Lebanon; Dagupan, Philippines; Dar es Salaam, Tanzania; Lokoja, Nigeria; Portmore, Jamaica; Talcahuano/Concepcion, Chile; Tehran, Iran; and Wellington, New Zealand.",

The purpose of this section is to provide guidance to project teams on the implementation of the Bank's Disaster Risk Management Policy Directive A-2: Risk and Project Viability. This Directive is designed to promote the incorporation of DRM in a systematic manner during project preparation and execution. The objective is to reduce risk to levels that are acceptable to the Bank and the borrower, as indicated in Directive A-2 of the Policy: 3.2. Identification and reduction of project risk. Bank-financed public and private sector projects will include the necessary measures to reduce disaster risk to acceptable levels as determined by the Bank on the basis of generally accepted standards and practices. The Bank will not finance projects that, according to its analysis, would increase the threat of loss of human life, significant human injuries, severe economic disruption, or significant property damage related to natural hazards. During the project preparation process project teams will identify if the projects have high exposure to natural hazards or show high potential to exacerbate risk. The findings will be reported to the Bank through the social and environmental project screening and classification process. Project teams should consider the risk of exposure to natural hazards by taking into account the projected distribution in frequency, duration, and intensity of hazard events in the geographic area affecting the project. Project teams will carry out a natural hazard risk assessment for projects that are found to be highly exposed to natural hazards or to have a high potential to exacerbate risk. Special care should be taken to assess risk for projects that are located in areas that are highly prone to disasters as well as sectors such as housing, energy, water and sanitation, infrastructure, industrial and agricultural development, and critical health and education installations, as applicable. In the analysis of risk and project viability, consideration should be given to both structural and nonstructural mitigation measures. This includes specific attention to the capacity of the relevant national institutions to enforce proper design and construction standards and of the financial provisions for proper maintenance of physical assets commensurate with the foreseen risk. When significant risks due to natural hazard are identified at any time throughout the project preparation process, appropriate measures should be taken to establish the viability of the project, including the protection of populations and investments affected by Bank-financed activities. Alternative prevention and mitigation measures that decrease vulnerability must be analyzed and included in project design and implementation as applicable. These measures should include safety and contingency planning to protect human health and economic assets. Expert opinion and adherence to international standards should be sought, where reasonably necessary. In the case of physical assets, the Bank will require that, at the time of project preparation, the borrower establish protocols to carry out periodic safety evaluations (during construction as well as during the operating life of the project) and appropriate maintenance of the project equipment and works, in accordance with generally accepted industry norms under the circumstances. The Bank's social and environmental project screening and classification process will evaluate the steps taken by project teams to identify and reduce natural hazard risk. 3.3. Under the Bank's new risk management development effectiveness framework, a common approach to the management of project risks is proposed. Disaster risk is one of several project risks. These guidelines are an input to the Bank's approach on project risk management. They apply to Bank-financed investment loans and technical cooperation projects in the public and private sector as well as to operations supported by the Multilateral Investment Fund.",

The project team will report its findings to the Bank unit responsible for social and environmental screening and classification of projects, as part of the Bankwide safeguards and risk management procedure.

The project will typically be classified as high-risk if one or more of the significant natural hazards may occur several times during the execution (construction) period and/ or the operational life of the project and/or the likely severity of social, economic, and/or environmental impacts in the short to medium term are major or extreme. These impacts are of sufficient magnitude to affect project viability and may affect an area broader than the project site. As such hazards may affect project viability, a more detailed investigation of disaster risk, in the form of a DRA, is required. Moderate-Risk Projects 3.12. The project will typically be classified as moderate risk if one or more of the prevalent natural hazards are likely to occur at least once during the execution (construction) period and/or the operational life of the project and/or the likely severity of impact in the short to medium term is average. These impacts are typically confined to the project site and can be mitigated at reasonable costs. Projects associated with a moderate disaster risk do not typically require a DRA. However, a more limited DRA may be required, depending on the complexity of the project and where the anticipated vulnerability of a specific project component may compromise the achievement of project outcomes. Low-Risk Projects 3.13. The project will typically be classified as low risk if natural hazards are not likely to occur during construction and/or the operational life of the project and/or associated with a low severity of impact in the short to medium term. Those impacts that occur do not lead to a disruption in the normal functioning of the operation and can be corrected as part of project maintenance. The occurrence of the hazard event does not impact on the achievement of project outcomes. A DRA is not required. 3.14.

The loan reformulation addressed by these guidelines provides financing for postdisaster response to the impacts of natural hazard events and physical damage (such as structural collapse and explosions) caused by technological accidents or other types of disasters resulting from human activity. Loan reformulation includes the diversion of existing loan resources to specific analysis needs to determine performance indicators, based on the possible revisions and reformulations being considered. Analysis of Loans Used as a Source of Funding 4.11. The impact of redirecting loan resources from existing loans will be estimated taking into account the intended uses and project objectives of the loan or loans to be used as a source relative to the new proposed use of the funds, thereby creating the conditions for more informed decisions. Resource transfers could be done between cost categories within a project (in which case more streamlined approval procedures will apply), or between separate loans as stipulated by Bank procedures. 4.12. For choosing existing projects as origin of resources, following factors (in order of priority) would be considered: a. Public sector projects. Only public sector loans would be considered. Loans to the private sector should not be included in the package of loans for possible reformulation as a result of disasters. b. Development impact in the reformulated operations. The loans that are having a relatively low economic/financial impact in the country should be considered first as a source for redirecting resources from existing loans toward emergency funding. Redirecting resources that are within a loan generally have a smaller effect than those involving several operations. The original development objectives may not be achieved due to the new social or economic situation created by the disaster or it could be considered too expensive to reorient the resources within the old operation. Recommendations regarding the redirection of resources will be based on project performance indicators used by the Bank. c. Level of execution. Operations with a low level of physical execution or disbursements and commitments could be chosen for redirection, except for those loans with a very high development impact. The selection should not only be based on a low disbursement rate of the existing loans alone, but also on an analysis of the underlying causes of the poor performance and any remaining opportunities for attaining project goals. d. Loans in affected sectors. Resource transfers within an affected sector will be preferred due to the greater similarity of their respective objectives compared with those of loans in different sectors. e. Loans in affected region(s). In general, existing projects in the disaster area will not be used to provide resources to be transferred to other programs in the same area. However, when damage is so severe that the attainment of the original development objectives is in jeopardy, or the continuation of a certain component of the project as a whole is unjustifiable on account of excessive costs, parts or all of the undisbursed balances may be re-channeled toward emergency or rehabilitation and reconstruction projects in the same area. Factors to be Considered in Projects Receiving Funding 4.13. The following are the recommended actions to be considered by project teams, while preparing the funding analysis: 4.14 i. Technical analysis. For emergencies, the technical analysis will be aimed at re-establishing basic services and critical infrastructure in a time efficient manner. The attainment of fully functioning facilities and productive capacity through rehabilitation and reconstruction will be measured through a detailed technical analysis with the objective of reaching disaster resistance, and fulfilling technical standards across the board and performance criteria required by the Bank. 4.15 ii. Socioeconomic analysis. For emergency response, the socioeconomic analysis will be limited to the evaluation of the cost-effectiveness of restoring the basic services and critical infrastructure. If information is scarce, the analysis may be done based on comparable data from similar operations elsewhere. Any delays in the analysis and processing of the emergency financing may limit the Bank to have a meaningful contribution to resolve critical needs that are affecting the population, urgent re-establishment of basic services and critical activities. The analysis for rehabilitation and reconstruction investments will follow standard Bank practices. If future project benefits cannot be estimated, cost-effectiveness analysis will be carried out. 4.16 iii. Evaluation of institutional capacity and coordination. In order to gain sustainability, existing agencies are preferred to the establishment of new, ad hoc entities. A rapid analysis will be carried out of the institutional capacity, procurement management capability, and financial track record of the existing agencies. Based on its results, it will be determined if the resources will be disbursed on an ex post or on a concurrent basis.",
