Diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), avian influenza, or bioterrorism caused by the deliberate release of biological agents, all represent new challenges for outbreak alert and response worldwide. Only early detection of disease activity, followed by a rapid response, can reduce the impact of epidemics and prevent harm caused by disease outbreaks [1] . The World Health Organisation defines a disease outbreak as the \"occurrence of cases of disease in excess of what would normally be expected in a defined community, geographical area or season.\" An outbreak may occur in a restricted geographical area or may extend over several countries. It may last for a few days or weeks, or for several years [2] . A single case of a communicable disease long absent from a population, or caused by an agent (e.g., bacterium or virus) not previously recognized in that community or area, as well as the emergence of a previously unknown disease, may also constitute an outbreak and should be reported and investigated immediately after its occurrence.",

Furthermore, despite the development of new approaches for the detection of previously unknown threats (e.g., monitoring of syndromes, death rates, drug prescriptions), these are still insufficient, because signals leading to a public health alert can originate from other sources.",

Consider the following example: many people suffer from flu every year and many of them search for relevant information in the internet, and share their health problems with others online. In this way, a description of their symptoms, time-stamped and even geo-tagged, is available through search logs, social networks, or other social media tools. Therefore, the internet provides a rather detailed picture of the health of the population, coming from digital sources, through all of our connected devices, including smartphones.",

Crisis communication is an ongoing process associated with the exchanging information of opinions on a crisis and the coordination of resources including equipment, personnel, and information to avoid or reduce harm and for coordinating resources during a crisis [5, 6] . It also includes the strategy to make people's behavior more rational that they could make informed decisions. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) is claiming in a report that \"Social media are revolutionizing communication\" [5] . They report three ways to use social media in crisis management: (1) as situation awareness tool, (2) as state communication tool, or (3) as a platform for dynamic interaction. Natural disasters such as the 2010 Haiti earthquake or flood in Thailand revealed already the utility of internet-based social media for risk and crisis communication [7] . In these contexts, social media represented an opportunity to broaden warnings to large population groups. OECD acknowledges a \"great potential to support two-way crisis communication at low cost and with high efficacy\" [5] .",

For example, PatientsLikeMe (https://www.patientslikeme.com/, last accessed 17.11.2015) is a social network for patients that allows them to share health-related experiences and compare treatments. The community currently comprises more than 350,000 patient members (November, 2015) . Over 2500 conditions are reported in the platform. Data is collected in a rather structured manner: for the various features such as quality of life or single symptoms, categories are predefined (e.g., quality of physical life on a scale of 4 between best and worst, see Fig. 4 .1). Access to health social networks is often restricted to members, i.e., only registered members can connect to others and read through their content. For applications in digital epidemiology, posted messages would need to be collected and analyzed automatically. Given the restricted access, this is difficult if not impossible, also due to legal issues (see Section 4.6). However, social networks offer the opportunity to be used in crisis communication, either for coordinating emergency services and volunteers, or to share information inside a community.",

Twitter's limit is set such that a standard text message, which is limited at 160 characters, can include one entire tweet plus address information. Besides individuals, organizations are tweeting. For example, the U.S. Center of Disease Prevention and Control (https://twitter.com/cdcflu) and the organization Med\u00e9cins sans Frontiers (https://twitter.com/MSF) are tweeting updates on disease activity (Table 4 .1). Systems that collect information on disease activity have channels where detected activities are posted [e.g., HealthMap (https://twitter.com/healthmap), ProMED-mail (https:// twitter.com/ProMED_mail)].

In contrast to traditional surveillance systems that rely on subscriber input, GPHIN gathers information on disease outbreaks and other public health events by monitoring global media sources on a 24/7 basis. GPHIN's two main sources of outbreak information are the global news services Factiva and Al Bawaba in Arabic language.

Collected data is processed by means of automated filtering, and visualization of reports through the utilization of automated text processing algorithms that classify alerts by location and disease. A mean against information overload, the articles are further categorized for improved filtering.

In this section, we briefly summarize the architecture of the M-Eco system and its functionalities, as well as report on experiences in its evaluation and testing. The M-Eco system could so far not been established into regular use by health organizations due to missing personnel resources from implementation. More details about the technology and studies can be found in papers by Denecke et al. [22] and Velasco et al. [10] .",

But, M-Eco brought such reports quickly to a broader attention. It was not possible to present an example where M-Eco was the first to detect an outbreak by a clustering of social media contributions with similar symptoms in space and time, and where the outbreak was afterwards confirmed by the traditional notification system. Another lesson learnt is not to underestimate the legal and ethical issues related to IT solutions for digital epidemiology. We discuss relevant issues in Section 4.6.",

More timely information and networking among the \"helping hands\" could become the most driving factor. Challenges are related to the increased information overload, including the amount of unauthorized information which is information not officially confirmed by health officials, which might be addressed by technology, e.g., by including sophisticated filtering algorithms to prefilter the information before showing to the user. A challenge is the high risk of manipulation, in particular the risk of analyzing postings containing wrong or misleading information. The usefulness of social media for disease surveillance depends clearly on the willingness of people to share (correct) information online and to use online tools. In particular, we will need in future ethical and legal standards to ensure that people will continuously use these tools for reporting on disease activity.
