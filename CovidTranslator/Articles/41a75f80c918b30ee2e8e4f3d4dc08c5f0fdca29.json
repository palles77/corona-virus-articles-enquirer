We have examined the growth properties of three JHM virus isolates in primary rat glial cultures and found a correlation with their ability to cause disease. Wild type JHM virus has the propensity to cause lytic infections in glial cultures, and a temperature-sensitive mutant designated JHM-ts43 invariably produces persistent infections with reduced cytopathic effects (CPE) as compared to the wild type. Moreover, a non-neurotropic isolate, designated JHM-Pi virus, produces either non-productive persistent infections at low multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) or productive persistent infections at high m.o.i., with, however, no CPE. The phenotypic expression of persistence is glial cell-dependent, since all three viruses produce similarly lytic infections when grown on various susceptible cell lines. The genetic basis of JHM virus persistence can be explained at the level of direct virus-glial cell interactions.",

Infection of Lewis rats with the JHM strain of murine coronavirus in particular can lead to a demyelinating encephalomyelitis, which is triggered by a persistent virus infection and is associated with autoimmune reactions against myelin basic protein (Watanabe et al., 1983; Massa et al., 1986a) . JHM virus causes in rats both a short term acute encephalomyelitis with involvement of neurons and glial cells and a subacute demyelinating encephalomyelitis (SDE) with predominant involvement of glial cells (Nagashima et al., 1978 (Nagashima et al., , 1979 Koga et al., 1984; Wege et al., 1984a) . This SDE is caused by a persistent virus infection, and neuropathological changes consist of inflammatory demyelinating lesions. Recovery from the acute disease and progression to viral persistence depends on the type of JHM virus utilized for intracerebral inoculation.",

Other JHM isolates do not cause productive infections in the brain (Baybutt et al., 1984) . The ability of different neurotropic JHM virus isolates to cause fatal acute disease or persistent infections may depend on various factors, including the target cells of the virus, efficiency of virus production, the ability of the virus to spread to other cells and the particular type of immune response to the infection (Sorensen et al., 1982 (Sorensen et al., , 1984 Beushausen and Dales, 1985; Taguchi et al., 1985 Taguchi et al., , 1986 Dubois-Dalcq et al., 1982; Massa et al., 1986b) . The degree to which direct virus-neural cell interaction or the immunological response to infection controls the frequency of acute versus persistent infection by JHM virus is unknown. We have therefore examined the growth properties of three different JHM isolates in primary rat glial cell cultures. We show that the degree of neurotropism associated with each individual virus in the animal correlates with growth properties of the virus in the glial cell cultures. The differences seen in tissue culture are glial cell-specific, as all three viruses display similar properties when grown on susceptible cell lines.",

Immunoperoxidase staining of JHM virus antigen most clearly demonstrates the differences in the extent of plaque formation at 1 day, 1 wk and 3 wk p.i. (Fig. 4) . As can be seen, the growth of plaques, produced by JHM-wt and ts43 after infection with low m.o.i., proceeds steadily for at least 3 wk (Fig. 4 , a-f). In contrast, JHM-Pi remains restricted mainly to single cells or cell doublets as seen at 1 day p.i. (Fig. 4, g) using a low m.o.i., and the infection appears abortive during the first week of infection. However, at high m.o.i., single or doublet infected cells positive for virus antigen persist for 1 to at least 3 wk p.i. (Fig. 4, h) . Whether low multiplicity infection by JHM-Pi is abortive or simply undetectable by immunoperoxidase staining is unclear; however, in some instances, productive infections were apparent after co-cultivation with susceptible cell lines (not shown). This would indicate a propensity of JHM-Pi virus to produce non-productive low level persistent infections after inoculation with low m.o.i. and persistent productive infections using high m.o.i. Infection by JHM-wt at high m.o.i. invariably led to a lytic infection that was complete by l-2 wk p.i., with the exception that fibroblasts and numerous oligodendrocytes remained apparently uninfected, as previously described (Massa et al., 1986b). As described above, at low m.o.i., the cultures usually survived an initial lytic phase and then plaque expansion ceased. This situation was invariably produced by JHM-ts43 regardless of m.o.i. and persisted until at least 8 weeks pi. (Fig.   4 , f>. In contrast to Sac( -) cells, infection of cultivated brain cells with the three JHM virus variants resulted in different virus growth curves. At high m.o.i. JHM-wt virus release peaked at 4 days p.i. and declined thereafter to undetectable levels by 10 days p.i. (Fig. 5, a) . At low m.o.i. JHM-wt was released at constant levels (103-lo4 p.f.u./mI) between 4 and 24 days pi. (Fig. 5, b) with a development of restricted focal CPE. After infection with JHM-ts 43 at high m.o.i. (Fig. 5, a) virus release rose at a steady slow rate starting 6-10 days p.i. whereas at low m.o.i. (Fig. 5, b) no evidence for a productive infection was obtained. JHM-Pi infection at high m.o.i. (Fig. 5 , a) led to extremely high virus titers over prolonged periods without the development of a detectable CPE. With low m.o.i., infectious JHM-Pi was found on day 2 to day 4 at about lo2 p.f.u./ml, and then became undetectable thereafter, except in rare instances in some samples (Fig. 5, b ).",

However, the fusion capacity of the avirulent JHM-Pi virus was strongly impaired in primary rat glial cultures even at m.o.i. higher than that routinely used in this study (m.o.i. = 10-100) .The viral peplomer glycoprotein E2 (also termed spike protein) is the structural entity responsible for cell fusion, attachment to cells and binding of neutralising antibodies (Collins et al., 1982; Wege et al., 1984b) . It has been shown for the murine coronavirus, A59, that cell fusion can only be induced after proteolytic cleavage of this large glycoprotein into two smaller subunits of similar size (Sturman et al., 1985) . The extent of cleavage and the degree of fusion differs with the host cell (Frana et al., 1985) . The spread of virus by fusion could therefore be influenced by cell-specific factors like glycosylation and protease activities. In our system, such host factors may contribute to differences of spread in glial cells. However, the prerequisite for such different outcomes of infection is probably due to structural differences between E2 proteins of the particular JHM virus population used for infection.JHM virus variants with enlarged RNA encoding the JHM E2 glycoprotein are selected for both in vivo (Taguchi et al., 1985) and during replication in rat astrocytes in vitro (Taguchi et al., 1986) . This probably is an important virus-glial cell interaction involved in the establishment of growth potential and persistence of JHM virus in astrocytes within the brain. A similar phenomenon of spontaneous transition of lytic to persistent infection involving alteration of the E2 glycoprotein has also been observed in cell lines (Baybutt et al., 1984) . Antigenic differences between JHM-wt virus and JHM-Pi are detectable by monoclonal antibodies against E2-glycoprotein (Wege et al., 1984b) . Furthermore, JHM virus variants selected by escape from neutralisation with monoclonal antibodies revealed distinct changes of antigenic determinants which may be related to reduced neurovirulence (Fleming et al., 1986; Dalziel et al., 1986) .Defective replication within astrocytes by temperature-sensitive mutants of JHM virus and the related A59 coronavirus has been described in mouse CNS cultures (Dubois-Dalcq et al., 1982; van Berlo et al., 1986) . Similar observations have been described for human coronavirus 0C43 in mouse or human glial cultures (Pearson and Mims, 1985) . Therefore, the tropism and cytopathogenicity of coronaviruses for astrocytes may be a major determinant during establishment of persistency in brain tissue. The behavior of different JHM virus isolates during infection of glial cells in vitro will allow the analysis of both virus-and cell-specific properties leading to viral persistence which are independent of factors associated with immunomodulation.
