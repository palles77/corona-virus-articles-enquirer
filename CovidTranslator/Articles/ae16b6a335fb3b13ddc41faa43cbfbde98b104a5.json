The past 15 years has seen a more uniform, world-wide approach to the management of sepsis, severe sepsis and septic shock with improved survival. Recognizing the early symptoms and signs of sepsis are key: the confused, hypoxic, hypotensive patient with pyrexia, tachycardia, tachypnoea and leucocytosis. Examination must include search for a source of infection and early drainage or debridement. Next to take appropriate cultures, give fluids and broad-spectrum antibiotics. If the picture does not improve over the next 6 hours step-up the treatment to include urine output monitoring, blood gases for base excess, lactate, haemoglobin and glucose. These will guide the management of vasopressors, insulin, fluids, transfusion and bicarbonate. If the hypotension persists (septic shock) the patient should be moved to intensive care. The most recent recommendations include the withdrawal of starch based colloids, dobutamine in place of dopamine and a higher threshold for the use of steroids. This should be instituted within 24 hours of the start of sepsis. Advanced care includes mechanical ventilation using the ARDSnet protocol. Prevention by screening, stopping cross infection and appropriate use of antibiotics remains the first priority.",

A medical ICU will have far more communityacquired infections than an ICU admitting elective surgical patients.

In other studies a haemoglobin range of 7e9 g/dl has been compared with higher haemoglobins and shown no detriment with the lower values. Thus a target of 7e9 g/dl or Hct 21e27% is recommended although higher values may be desired in specific patient groups. 14 The use of fresh frozen plasma and platelets is for the bleeding patient or if a surgical intervention is planned, in which case platelets are given if the count is <50,000/mm 3 . Current guidelines do not recommend the use of cryoprecipitate for measured values of fibrinogen degradation products. 6 However, both fresh plasma and cryoprecipitate are used when faced with coagulopathy.",

Non-invasive ventilation is desirable but is less effective in sepsis compared to other respiratory diseases. Half of these patients will have an acute lung injury, caused by the effects of septicaemia. At this time they are vulnerable to barotrauma caused by ventilation-modes used in the operating room. This in turn will result in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) which carries a very high mortality and morbidity especially in patients over 45 years of age. The basic principle is to use low tidal volumes, <6 ml/kg, keep inspired plateau pressures <30 cm H 2 O, recruitment strategies and allow permissive hypercapnia, the so called 'ARDSnet strategy'. 15 Though precise values for the PaCO 2 are not established it is considered reasonable to allow a respiratory acidosis of around pH 7.25.",

It seemed intuitively correct that running high blood glucose was a bad thing in the presence of bacteraemia. However, subsequent studies showed far less dramatic findings and many found hypoglycaemia a problem. In 2009 the NICE-SUGAR study with over 6000 patients comparing 'tight glucose control' (normal values) with 'glucose kept below 10 mmol/l' found increased mortality and more episodes of hypoglycaemia in the 'tight' group. 17 Nutrition When and how? Feeding septic patients remains controversial. Because the source of sepsis is so variable it is difficult to compare like with like. A survey of 454 ICUs in 310 German hospitals specifically looking at feeding in septic patients found that patients fed with parenteral or mixed parenteral/enteral nutrition had a greater than 57% mortality compared with enteral alone which was 38%. 18 However a multicentre Italian study showed an excess mortality in septic patients receiving enteral immune-nutrition compared to parenteral nutrition and the study was stopped. 19 The current position does not recommend specific immune-nutrition.",
