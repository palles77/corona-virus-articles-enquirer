The approach of doing no non-pharmaceutical measures results in the lowest total costs if the infection fatality rate falls below 0.15%.",

In the herd immunity approach, food services, arts and recreation shut down completely.

The average cost per in-patient stay in the US is around 2000 USD, but varies across states and hospital types 3 . We assume that each day in an ICU increases hospital's costs by 2000 USD and hence the average stay costs $20000 per each critical care patient with COVID-19.",

            "text": "Next, we consider the labor supply effects on output. The large part of output effects comes from employment losses due to sickness, home quarantines and school closures. Sickness losses equal to the number of symptomatic mild cases multiplied by 5 days (duration of symptoms) plus the number of critical cases multiplied by one month (average duration of critical cases). Total employment losses due to sickness are approximately equal for the laissez-faire approach and for the herd immunity approach as in both approaches the virus ends up infecting around 80% of population.Home quarantines imposed in the herd immunity approach involve 14-day shelter-in-place orders for all the household members if one household members gets diagnosed with COVID-19. Consistent with Ferguson et al (2020), we assume that only 50% of household comply with quarantine orders. The average number of workers per household weighted by household size represents the expected number of workers affected by the household quarantine per each diagnosed case. Based on the American Community Survey 2018 obtained from I-PUMS 4 , this number is 1.15. Excluding workers which already quarantine due to sickness, the additional loss of labor supply is 14 * (1.15 * (1 \u2212 s) + (1.15 \u2212 1) * s) days, where s is the proportion of workers in the population (41% in the US). School closures decrease labor demand by requiring that at least one adult needs to be present at home during school hours if the household includes any schoolchildren younger than 12 years old. To find all the affected households, we consider households in which the number of 18-80 individuals is equal to the number of full-time workers commuting to work and which have at least one child with age between 6 and 12 years. In the ACS 2018, these criteria describe approximately 7mln households and correspond 4. Steven Ruggles, Sarah Flood, Ronald Goeken, Josiah Grover, Erin Meyer, Jose Pacas and Matthew Sobek.

Stated preference literature typically finds somewhat lower estimates. For example, the OECD recommends using the value of statistical life range of $1.8-5.5 mln based on the meta-study of stated preference literature. To account for this uncertainty, we calculate the total costs of each program for two values of statistical life at opposite points of the plausible range. The low value of statistical life in our analysis is $3mln. The high value of statistical life is $10mln. For comparison, the US Environmental Protection Agency uses the value of statistical life of around $8.6mln (based on Alberini et al, 2019). There are indications that people are willing to pay similar amounts to save themselves from risks of death from SARS respiratory illnesses (Liu et al, 2005).",

The effect is much smaller as would be expected just based on expected years to live. Given the small size of this effect and the potential moral dilemmas, we avoid accounting for age variation in the VSL.Mortality costs of the disease are highest for the laissez-faire approach in which the demand for critical care exceeds healthcare capacity starting from May 2020. It results in a large number of excess deaths: 3.5 mln vs 2.4 mln in the herd immunity approach.Accordingly, total mortality costs of the laissez-faire approach add up to $10.6 trillion for low VSL and $35.47 trillion for high VSL. Total mortality costs of the herd immunity approach are accordingly 7.1 and 23.8 trillion USD. Total mortality costs are almost negligible in the aggressive approach ($6.4bln and $21bln).",
