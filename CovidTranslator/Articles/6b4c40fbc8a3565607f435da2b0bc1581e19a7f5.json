In February 2014, the Obama Administration launched the Global Health Security Agenda (GHSA) with the aim of moving toward a world safe and secure from infectious disease threats. 1 Foundational to this agenda is the World Health Organization (WHO) Revised International Health Regulations (IHR) of 2005, which provide the legal framework for countries to strengthen their health systems in order to be able to respond to any public health emergency of international concern. The IHR goals are ''to prevent, protect against, control and provide a public health response to the international spread of disease in ways that are commensurate with and restricted to public health risks, and which avoid unnecessary interference with international traffic and trade.'' 2 The regulations call on countries to meet 8 core public health capacities, one of which is laboratory testing.",

To that end, in 1999, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), in partnership with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Association of Public Health Laboratories (APHL), launched the LRN to strengthen the nation's ability to rapidly detect biological and chemical agents that could be used by violent, nonstate actors. 5 The LRN-B began with only 17 laboratories and has since expanded to approximately 160 member facilities, which include both domestic and international laboratories, and thousands of sentinel clinical laboratories, 6 which form the foundation of the system. The LRN-B is diverse and encompasses public health, military, veterinary, environmental, and food laboratories that provide reference testing for a wide array of sample types including environmental samples and clinical specimens. The network has many strategic partners, which allows for coordination among federal, state, and local public health agencies, clinical laboratories, first responders, and law enforcement. 7 The foundation of the LRN is a unified operational plan and standardization of laboratory testing, so that a test result generated from one LRN member laboratory is the same as a result generated from another network laboratory, thus providing for rapid, high-confidence results to inform public health decisions.",

Over the years, the LRN mission has expanded to include response to chemical threats 8 and other public health emergencies, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), monkeypox, influenza A virus subtype H5N1 (avian influenza), influenza A virus subtype H1N1 (2009 pandemic influenza), and, in 2014, the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and Ebola virus.

The public health infrastructure had deteriorated over the years due in large part to a lack of resources, the migration of laboratory workers away from laboratories and into higher-paying positions, and a decrease in the number of students pursuing careers in microbiology. In the face of these challenges, the LRN employed the existing public health infrastructure as the backbone of its network and rebuilt it through funds awarded to states by HHS's CDC Cooperative Agreement on Public Health Preparedness and Response for Bioterrorism (now called the Public Health Emergency Preparedness [PHEP] Cooperative Agreement). 9 Since the inception of the PHEP Cooperative Agreement, LRN-B public health laboratories have used the funding to build, expand, and maintain BSL-3 suites. 10 A BSL-3 suite is a contained area that must meet stringent biosafety requirements, including biosafety cabinets, controlled double-door access, and engineering controls, such as negative air pressure relative to surrounding rooms and microfiltration of air. BSL-3 agricultural facilities have additional safeguards, including decontamination of liquids prior to release into the sewage system, separate HEPA filtration of exhausted air, and pressure-impervious walls, floors, and ceilings designed to protect workers and the environment from accidental exposure to certain regulated agents. 11 Finally, BSL-3 enhanced facilities have even more safety features.",

Examples of the projects supported include: In 2009 APHL established a WHO twinning partnership specific to quality, biosafety, and biosecurity systems between the New Mexico Department of Health, Scientific Laboratory Division, and the Paraguay National Laboratory that could be replicated in other countries to support the GHSA (Figure 3 ). Despite a limited program budget, technical assistance and training exchange visits coupled with distance mentorship provided a solid mechanism for knowledge transfer and capacity building. This partnership yielded the following for the Paraguay laboratory: Development of quality assurance and biosafety manuals; Institution of a pipette calibration program; Biosafety training sessions delivered; BSL-3 facility planning and design completed; and Establishment of a quality committee at the laboratory.",

This twinning agreement will center on the 6 pillars of the IHR laboratory core competencies outlined by the WHO-Afro office: Coordination of laboratory services; Laboratory capacity for the high-priority diseases; Laboratory quality management systems; Specimen collection and transportation; Biosafety and biosecurity; and Laboratory-based surveillance and public health actions. 13 The twinning model has proven a sustainable and costeffective method for technical assistance and knowledge transfer, in part because of the efficiency gained by linking entire institutions. Technical assistance visits, training, and informational tours are able to be conducted across laboratory disciplines and departments, allowing for results that can affect the accurate identification and control of infectious diseases. Leveraging the LRN model and instituting twinning agreements to support the model could significantly accelerate progress in efforts to strengthen laboratory systems. Laboratory twinning could also be considered and implemented for ''South-to-South'' collaborations, allowing for countries with similar laboratory systems to support each other and establish regional laboratory networks.",

LRN member laboratories must have a secure mechanism to share laboratory data on threat agents with the CDC. Currently, most laboratories use an application called LRN Results Messenger (LRN RM), which allows LRN member laboratories to instantly manage and share standard LRN-related laboratory data. LRN RM represents the first iteration in an incremental approach to providing full standards-based electronic data exchange for this vital laboratory network. However, the nature of the application requires laboratorians to enter their data into LRN RM and their Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS), a time-consuming double entry process that could take up critical time in an emergency. Over time, increased capabilities have allowed for improved methods, and the LIMS Integration (LIMSi) project is the LRN's next step in electronic data exchange. The LIMSi project addresses the delay by aiding laboratories in connecting their existing LIMS to CDC, enabling LRN member laboratories to fulfill electronic data exchange needs for the LRN using their own systems and eliminating the need for LRN RM and double data entry. To implement LIMSi, CDC is collaborating with APHL to provide public health laboratories with necessary resources. There is still much to be done with LIMSi, and thus LRN RM remains a vital platform for many laboratories to rapidly exchange data with CDC.",

Mills LEVERAGING THE LRN MODEL FOR GHSAanthracis to MERS-CoV. This work is possible because of the interconnected and tiered network approach. Without a strong foundation of sentinel clinical laboratories, standard protocols,14 and the connections with the reference (eg, public health) and national (eg, CDC) laboratories, it would take a much longer time to detect and reduce infectious disease threats. A prime example of real-time surveillance was seen in May 2014 when a patient in a hospital in Indiana exhibited symptoms consistent with MERS-CoV. The hospital staff sent specimens to the Indiana State Department of Health Laboratories, which presumptively identified MERS-CoV, using a CDC LRN deployed assay, and reported the result to CDC on May 1, 2014. The Indiana state laboratory also sent specimens to CDC that confirmed MERS-CoV on May 2, 2014. Prior to this novel case, CDC deployed the MERS-CoV assay via the LRN to 44 state public health laboratories, 1 large local public health laboratory, and DoD laboratories both domestic and international, and further the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) 15 for the CDC Novel Coronavirus 2012 real-time reverse transcription PCR assay.",
