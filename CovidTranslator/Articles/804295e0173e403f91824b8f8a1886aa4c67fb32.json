            "text": "The development of the innate immune system is essential for new-born animals to survive, especially when exposed to infectious diseases that are responsible for high morbidity and mortality. During the first few months of life new-born calves have a weakened immunity as the granulocyte function and complement activity are low (Cervenak and Kacskovics, 2009; Cortese, 2008) ; and the calves also lack specific immunity (Boysen et al., 2006; Stefaniak et al., 2012) . Protection obtained from colostrum falls as the immunoglobulins decline usually from the seventh day of life. This is at a time when their specific antibodies are at a low concentration; which then develops as the calves grow . During this period of low immunity the animals are more susceptible to infections including bovine respiratory disease (BRD). BRD is a complex and multifactorial disease caused by bacteria and viruses and is one of the most important diseases of cattle. Estimated losses to the cattle industry from BRD is more than US$3 billion every year (Griffin, 1997) . The main causative bacteria are: Mycoplasma bovis, and Mycoplasma dispar for which there are currently no commercial vaccines; and the Pasteurellaceae family of which the most pathogenic is Mannheimia haemolytica (Singh et al., 2011) . Viruses including PI3V and BRSV have an important role in BRD, not only in the patho-genesis of the disease but also by suppressing the host immunity (Cusack et al., 2003) . Calves are usually vaccinated during the first weeks of life. However, calf immunisation may be adversely affected by interference from maternal antibodies or unfavourable environmental conditions. Therefore, the effective vaccination of pregnant cows and the subsequent colostrum intake by their offspring can enhance the immune response of new-born calves.",

This model for protecting calves was used in preventing diarrhoea caused by both bacterial and viral pathogens. Pre-partum vaccination of cows with different virulence factors of enterohaemorrhagic serotype of Escherichia coli effectively stimulated the production of specific antibodies in the colostrum and milk fed to the offspring. Therefore, the passive protection of calves may prevent the early colonisation of the bacteria and then the development of diarrhoea in the calves (Rabinovitz et al., 2012) . Similar results were shown in another study, where a combined vaccine against rotavirus, coronavirus and E. coli was used to immunise pregnant cows. In these studies high titres of specific antibodies were measured in the colostrum and milk of dams to three components of the applied vaccine (Crouch et al., 2001) . Makoschey et al. (2012) have shown the effect of colostral antibodies from cow's vaccinated pre-partum with Bovilis \u00ae Bovipast RSP on the passive immunity of their offspring. Pre-vaccination of the cows partially protected the calves against the infection with M. haemolytica which was evident from the higher level of M. haemolytica specific antibodies and lower calf mortality when compared to the control group.",

M. haemolytica is considered to be a primary bacterial pathogen involved in BRD (Reddy et al., 2012) . The high mortality of cattle following infection with M. haemolytica results from numerous virulence factors of the bacteria responsible for cytolysis and apoptosis of leukocytes, endotoxin activity, colonisation, modulation of leukocyte activities like phagocytosis, avoiding the immunological system of the host by the resistance to Fig. 7 .

Some of the virulence factors of M. haemolytica have strong immunogenic properties, like leukotoxin (Bednarek et al., 2009) or outer membrane proteins (OMPs) (Ayalew et al., 2011) . Bovilis \u00ae Bovipast RSP vaccine contains the so-called iron regulated outer membrane proteins (IROMPs) of M. haemolytica. The phenomenon of IROMPs relies on facilitating the survival of the bacteria in a state of iron deficiency (sideropenia); this is also used by the host as one of its natural defences against infection. Therefore, the ability of the bacteria to survive in adverse conditions may affect its growth and the effective stimulation of the humoral immune response.",

These viruses are also important in BRD aetiology due to their immunosuppressive properties (Cusack et al., 2003) . High level of specific antibodies to M. haemolytica and the vaccine viruses, observed in this study in experimental calves from the first weeks of their life, pointed to the transfer of passive immunity derived from the vaccinated dams. However, specific antibody titres to adenovirus type 3, BHV1 and BVDV in the experimental calves were constant while the titres in the control groups changed throughout the course of the study. Following the colostrum administration derived from the vaccinated dams a more stable innate immunity status was observed in the calves fed with the natural secretion than in the controls. This passive intake of specific antibodies with colostrum in the experimental calves also enhanced their immune response against other infectious viral agents. In contrast this response in the control animals was expressed less which may account for the increase in the adenovirus type 3 titre observed in the control calves. One explanation for this response in the control group is the possible inverse correlation between colostrum administration and protection against adenovirus type 3 (Corbeil et al., 1984; Valarcher and H\u00e4gglund, 2006) .",

(2011) on heifer calves showed positive correlation between the high serum level of gamma globulins and the health status of the animals. In this study an unexpected increase in gamma globulin concentration in the control group could be as a result of an observed increase in IgM which coincided with infection and the humoral immune response. The gamma globulins also increased in the experimental calves which also correlated with raised IgG concentrations, resulting from the passive immunity transfer from the pre-partum vaccinated dams. The transfer of IgG via colostrum is very important to calves especially due to the lack of the maternal immunoglobulin ability to permeate through the placenta (Barrington and Parish, 2001) . The increased IgA levels in experimental calves observed here could be as a result of both the passive colostrum transfer and the mucosal immunity stimulation within the mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) which effectively prevents pathogen colonisation and its proliferation (Underdown and Schiff, 1986) .",

APPs are synthesised in response to infection or inflammation and their production is mediated by proinflammatory cytokines. In cattle the most indicative and useful APPs are Hp and SAA (Eckersall and Bell, 2010) . Changes in concentrations of these proteins were found in the course of infections with different microorganisms, such as M. haemolytica, Pasteurella multocida, BRSV and many other bovine diseases like bovine viral diarrhoea, foot and mouth disease, mastitis, respiratory disease, metritis and hepatic lipidosis (Petersen et al., 2004) . Our previous studies showed an increase in the concentration of both APPs in response to experimental infections in calves with a pathogenic strain of Mycoplasma bovis (Dudek et al., 2010) and from natural mycoplasmal infections (Dudek et al., 2011) . In this study, the ninth week of the calf's life was critical for the control animals, as this was when the Hp concentration increased and the most of the changes in the immunological parameters analysed here were observed. This suggests that the pre-partum specific immunisation of the cows stabilised the acute phase response in their offspring, which was most visible during the infections. It was also observed in this study which may be as a result of an adenovirus type 3 infection in the control calves, which was not confirmed. The Hp changes in these animals correlated with an increase in the adenovirus type 3 titre.",
