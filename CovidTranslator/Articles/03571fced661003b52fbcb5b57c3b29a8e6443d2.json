The pneumonia cases were found to be linked to a large seafood and animal market in Wuhan, and measures for sanitation and disinfection were taken swiftly by the local government agency. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and Chinese health authorities later determined and announced that a novel coronavirus (CoV), denoted as Wuhan CoV, had caused the pneumonia outbreak in Wuhan city (CDC, 2020) . Scientists from multiple groups had obtained the virus samples from hospitalized patients (Normile, 2020) . The isolated viruses were morphologically identical when observed under electron microscopy.",

The sequences of the six Wuhan CoV genomes were found to be almost identical ( Figure S1A in Supporting Information).

The results showed the Wuhan CoVs were clustered together in the phylogenetic tree, which belong to the Betacoronavirus genera ( Figure 1A ). Betacoronavirus is enveloped, single-stranded RNA virus that infects wild animals, herds and humans, resulting in occasional outbreaks and more often infections without apparent symptoms. The Wuhan CoV cluster is situated with the groups of SARS/SARS-like coronaviruses, with bat coronavirus HKU9-1 as the immediate outgroup. Its inner joint neighbors are SARS or SARS-like coronaviruses, including the human-infecting ones ( Figure 1A , marked with red star). Most of the inner joint neighbors and the outgroups were found in various bats as natural hosts, e.g., bat coronaviruses HKU9-1 and HKU3-1 in Rousettus bats and bat coronavirus HKU5-1 in Pipistrellus bats. Thus, bats being the native host of the Wuhan CoV would be the logical and convenient reasoning, though it remains likely there was intermediate host(s) in the transmission cascade from bats to humans. Based on the unique phylogenetic position of the Wuhan CoVs, it is likely that they share with the SARS/SARS-like coronaviruses, a common ancestor that resembles the bat coronavirus HKU9-1. However, frequent recombination events during their evolution may blur their path, evidenced by patches of high-homologous sequences between their genomes ( Figure S1B in Supporting Information).",

It comprises two domains, the N-terminal domain and the C-terminal RBD domain that directly interacts with host receptors (Li, 2012) . To investigate the Wuhan CoV and its host interaction, we looked into the RBD domain of its S-protein. The S-protein was known to usually have the most variable amino acid sequences compared to those of ORF1a and ORF1b from coronavirus (Hu et al., 2017) . However, despite the overall low homology of the Wuhan CoV S-protein to that of SARS-CoV ( Figure S1 in Supporting Information), the Wuhan CoV S-protein had several patches of sequences in the RBD domain having a high homology to that of SARS-CoV_Tor2 and HP03-GZ01 ( Figure 1B) . The residues at positions 442, 472, 479, 487, and 491 in SARS-CoV S-protein were reported to be at receptor complex interface and considered critical for crossspecies and human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV (Li et al., 2005) . Despite the patches of highly conserved regions in the RBD domain of the Wuhan CoV S-protein, four of the five critical residues are not preserved except Tyr491 ( Figure 1B) . Although the polarity and hydrophobicity of the replacing amino acids are similar, they raised serious questions about whether the Wuhan CoV would infect humans via binding of S-protein to ACE2, and how strong the interaction is for risk of human transmission. Note MERS-CoV S-protein displayed very little homology toward that of SARS-CoV in the RBD domain, due to the different binding target for its S-protein, the human dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) (Raj et al., 2013 ).",

A, Phylogenetic tree of coronaviruses based on full-length genome sequences. The tree was constructed with the Maximum-likelihood method using RAxML with GTRGAMMA as the nucleotide substitution model and 1,000 bootstrap replicates. Only bootstraps \u226550% values are shown as filled circles. The host for each coronavirus is marked with corresponding silhouette. Known human-infecting betacoronaviruses are indicated with a red star. B, Amino acid sequence alignment of the RBD domain of coronavirus S-protein. Residues 442, 472, 479, 487, and 491 (numbered based on SARS-CoV S-protein sequence) are important residues for interaction with human ACE2 molecule. C, Structural modeling of the Wuhan CoV (WH-human_1 as representative) S-protein complexed with human ACE2 molecule. Middle panel: The model of the Wuhan CoV S-protein (brown ribbon) is superimposed with the structural template of the SARS CoV S-protein (light blue ribbon). The protein backbone structure of human ACE2 is represented in magenta ribbon. Left panel: The region is shown for hydrogen bonding interactions between Arg426 in S-protein and Gln325/Glu329 in ACE2. The relevant residues are presented in ball and stick representations. Right panel: The region is shown for hydrogen bonding interactions between Tyr436 in S-protein and Asp38/Gln42 in ACE2.",
