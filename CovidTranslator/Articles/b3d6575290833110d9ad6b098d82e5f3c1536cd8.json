Lepidopteran-specific Alphabaculovirus and Betabaculovirus are two large genera in the family of Baculoviridae. In this study, we analyzed the codon usage patterns in 17 baculoviruses, including 10 alphabaculoviruses and 7 betabaculoviruses, which were isolated from seven insect species, and we characterized the codon usage patterns between Alphabaculovirus and Betabaculovirus. Our results show that all the baculoviruses possessed a general weak trend of codon bias. The differences of ENc (effective number of codons) values, nucleotide contents and the impacts of nucleotide content on ENc value within alpha-/betabaculovirus pairs were independent of whether the host species are the same or different. Furthermore, the majority of amino acid sequences adopted codons unequally in all viruses, but the numbers of common preferred codons between alpha-and betabaculoviruses hosted by the same insect species were not significantly different from the differences observed between alpha-and betabaculoviruses hosted by different insect species. In addition, the amino acids that adopt the same synonymous codon composition between alpha-and betabaculoviruses hosted by the same insect species were statistically as few as those between alpha-and betabaculoviruses hosted by different insect species. Correspondence analysis revealed that no major factors resulted in the codon bias in these baculoviruses, implying multiple minor influential factors exist. Neutrality plot analysis indicated that selection pressure dominated mutations in shaping the codon usage. However, the levels of selection pressure were not significantly different among viruses hosted by the same insect species. We expect that evolution would cause the alpha-and betabaculoviruses hosted by the same insect species to share more patterns, but this effect was not observed.",

            "text": "Synonymous codon usage bias (codon usage bias or codon bias) refers to the preference for a particular codon in a given organism. Codon bias in a genome or between different genomes is usually caused by adaptive changes (Goodarzi et al., 2008; Ingvarsson, 2008) and is widely present in biological systems from viruses to mammals (Eyre-Walker, 1991; Mirsafian et al., 2014; Shi et al., 2013) . Synonymous codon usage affects protein biogenesis, such as translation efficiency and gene function, beyond specifying the amino acid sequence of a protein (Chaney and Clark, 2015; Supek, 2016) . Hence, understanding codon bias is central to fields from molecular evolution to biotechnology (Isaacs et al., 2011; Plotkin and Kudla, 2011) . Selection and/or mutation bias are two general explanations for the existence of codon bias (Chen et al., 2014a; Chithambaram et al., 2014) . Selectional explanation assumes that codon bias contributes to the efficiency and/or the accuracy of protein expression and is thus generated and maintained by selection, while the mutational or neutral explanation posits that codon bias exists because of nonrandomness in the mutational patterns (Hershberg and Petrov, 2008) . At present, there is no common rule about the influential factors on codon bias. It is hard to predict whether selection or mutation dominates the codon usage in a given organism. As commonly known, mutational bias is the main force in shaping codon usage in certain viruses (Cristina et al., 2015; Zhou et al., 2015) , whereas natural selection pressure plays important roles in others (Chen et al., 2014b; Shi et al., 2013) .",

According to the ninth virus taxonomy report (King et al., 2012) , this family includes four genera: Alphabaculovirus, Betabaculovirus, Gammabaculovirus and Deltabaculovirus. Alphabaculovirus includes lepidopteran-specific nucleopolyhedroviruses, and Betabaculovirus comprises lepidopteran-specific granuloviruses. Several studies focused on baculovirus phylogeny and evolution and are useful for improving the application of baculoviruses as pesticides, foreign gene expression and display systems, and mammalian cells transducing vectors (Herniou and Jehle, 2007; Herniou et al., 2003; Volkman, 2015) . Presently, we know little about the synonymous codon usage pattern in baculoviruses. A previous study demonstrated that notable codon usage differences exist in Autographa californica multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus (Ranjan and Hasnain, 1995) . Later, it was determined that codon bias in nucleopolyhedroviruses correlates with GC content but not with the gene length and gene expression level (Levin and Whittome, 2000) . A recent study revealed that 40 of the 42 baculovirus genomes lack strong codon bias (Jiang et al., 2008) . However, much remains unknown about codon usage in baculoviruses.",

Under this assumption, the codon usage between alpha-and betabaculovirus hosted by the same insect species should be more similar than that between those hosted by different insect species. If we select alpha-and betabaculoviruses hosted by the same insect species to compare their codon usage, then the host's influence is controlled, and the differences obtained can represent the differences between the two virus genera, not only between the two virus species. In the present study, we used 17 baculoviruses that share common insect host species to differentiate the codon usage patterns between Alphabaculovirus and Betabaculovirus.

If only one codon is used for each amino acid, the ENc value would be 20 (extreme codon bias), and if all codons are used equally, the value would be 61 (no codon bias). In a genome, the majority of genes possess ENc values lower than 61, and only small number of genes possess ENc values equal to 61. As a result, the mean ENc value of a genome is always lower than 61. In general, ENc values less than or equal to 35 are described as strong, N 45 are described as weak, and values in between these values are described as moderate (Chen et al., 2014b; Roychoudhury et al., 2011) . ENc values correlated with total GC content (GC%) and GC content at the third synonymous codon position (GC3s%). ENc values were plotted against GC3s contents (ENc-plot analysis) to examine the influence of nucleotide composition on codon usage. The expected ENc value assumes equal use of G and C (A and T) in degenerate codon groups and can be calculated from GC3s content according to the equation provided by Wright (Wright, 1990) . In the plot, a gene or genome spot whose codon choice is subject to mutation pressure will lie on or just below the curve of the predicted values. In our plot, the spots represent individual genes. We used software CodonW (http://codonw.sourceforge.net/) to calculate ENc values and nucleotide composition. We employed one-way analysis of variance to compare ENc values, GC contents and GC3s contents, and employed Games-Howell's method to perform post hoc comparisons. We employed non-parametric Spearman rho to indicate correlation, and used Benjamini-Hotchberg correction (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995) with false discovery rate q* = 0.05 to set the significance level. The one-way analysis of variance and the correlation analysis were performed using software SPSS 16.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).",

We identified preferred codons by comparing their RSCU values. For each amino acid, we selected the first two highest frequently used codons to perform a chi-square goodnessof-fit test to examine whether their frequencies are significantly different. When the p value was b 0.05, we referred to the highest frequently used codon as the preferred codon. When the p value was N 0.05, we reselected the first three highest frequently used codons to do a second round of chi-square goodness-of-fit test. Again, if the p value was b 0.05, we referred the two highest frequently used codons both as the preferred codons. If the p value was N 0.05, we tried another round of testing for the four highest frequently used codons. In any round of the chisquare goodness-of-fit test, the RSCU value of the codon selected should be greater than one (N1); in other words, the preferred codon selected must be positively biased. We used CodonW to calculate RSCU value, and used SPSS 16.0 to perform the chi-square goodness-of-fit test.",

In general, the third codon position of synonymous codons includes an equal number A/T and G/C nucleotide pairs for most amino acids except for tryptophan (TGG), methionine (ATG) and one (ATA) of the three isoleucine codons. In the analysis, P 1 , P 2 , and P 3 are the observed GC contents of the first, second, and third codon positions of an individual gene; P 12 is the average of P 1 and P 2 . In the calculation, six codons (ATG, TGG, ATA, TAA, TAG, or TGA) were excluded (Sueoka, 1999a (Sueoka, , 1999b . The removal of these six codons from the analysis eliminates odd-numbered synonymous codon sets and therefore avoids an extra cause of potential bias from Parity Rule 2, an intrastrand rule where A = T and G = C are expected if there is no bias in mutation and selection between the two complementary strands of DNA (Sueoka, 1999a (Sueoka, , 1999b . Difference existed between P 1 and P 2 in their regressions against P 3 due to directional mutation pressure. Consequently, researchers usually use P 12 instead of using P 1 and P 2 separately in the regression analysis. We used Bioperl (Stajich et al., 2002) script to calculate P 1 , P 2 , P 12 , and P 3 values. The perl script is freely available on request from the author. We used SPSS 16.0 to plot P 12 against P 3 , to perform the simple linear regression analysis, and to compare the regression slopes by covariate analysis.

Understanding the extent and causes of synonymous codon usage bias is essential to research focused on viral evolution and transmission and is particularly important for interpreting the interplay between viruses and their hosts (Shackelton et al., 2006) . In the present study, we compared the synonymous codon usage between alpha-and betabaculovirus hosted by the same insect species to infer viral evolution at codon usage level.",

A possible explanation for weak codon bias in baculoviruses is that it is essential for efficient replication, re-adaption and survival in host cells with potentially distinct codon preferences (Cristina et al., 2015; Shi et al., 2013; Zhou et al., 2015) . Natural selection and mutation pressure are two main factors that account for codon usage variation in different organisms. We found that selection pressure dominates over mutation in determining the codon usage bias in the 17 baculoviruses, which is similar to the results we obtained in family Parvoviridae (Shi et al., 2013) , but the selection pressure exert on viruses hosted by the same insect species are similar or not significantly different. As to the impact of a host on the codon usage of viruses, the early study demonstrated that the codon usage in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus is not host specific (Gu et al., 2004) . However, more studies have indicated: a) codon usage bias of viruses is related with their hosts during the adaptation process (Bahir et al., 2009; Chantawannakul and Cutler, 2008; Ma et al., 2015; Nasrullah et al., 2015) , and b) viruses coincide their codon usage with hosts (Cheng et al., 2012; Kattoor et al., 2015) . In the present research, we aimed to differentiate the codon usage patterns between Alphabaculovirus and Betabaculovirus by comparing their ENc values, nucleotide contents, preferred codons, synonymous codon compositions for each amino acid and the influential factors of codon usage. We found that the differences of these indices within alpha-/betabaculovirus pairs are independent of whether the host species are the same or different. This result disagrees with our assumption that the viruses hosted by the same insect species should share more common codon usage patterns because the hosts' impacts are similar.",
