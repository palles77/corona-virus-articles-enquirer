Visceral lesions consisted of extensive fibrinopurulent bronchopneumonia, multiple renal cortical infarcts, severe coalescing centrilobular hepatic fatty change with minimal random hepatic necrosis, and multifocal splenic haemorrhage with lymphoid depletion. Moderate chronic diffuse enteritis was associated with intraluminal adult ascarids. Identification of type I and type II coronavirus in this subject had been previously confirmed by genotype-specific real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays of the intestinal contents, while only Coronavirus type II was detected in visceral organs.

The mouse EnVision system (Dakocytomation) was applied as described by the manufacturer and DAB (3,3 1-diaminobenzidine) (Peroxidase Substrate Kit DAB, Vector Laboratories Inc.) was used as chromogen.

The small intestine had moderate diffuse postmortem changes affecting the superficial mucosa, but there were also diffuse hyperemia, mild fibrosis and chronic inflammation (lymphocytes and plasma cells) within the lamina propria, and multifocal, moderate crypt ectasia with lumens containing cellular debris (crypt necrosis, ''crypt abscesses''). In the liver, multifocal, centrilobular and midzonal, moderate microvascular hepatocellular fatty change were present as well as necrosis of individual hepatocytes or small groups of hepatocytes. Periportal (limiting plate) hepatocytes showed slight hyperplasia with binucleation and mild thickening of cordons. Within the spleen there was multifocal hyperemia and diffuse, severe lymphoid depletion. The remaining lymphoid follicles contained pyknotic and karyorrhectic lymphocytes (leukocytolysis), rare plasma cells and scattered macrophages with intracytoplasmic pigment (haemosiderin) and cellular debris. In the kidney there were large multifocal areas of coagulative necrosis, associated with marked marginal hyperemia that extended from the superficial cortex to the medulla.

            "text": "CCoV infection has been always considered an intestinal disease characterized by lesions affecting the apices of the villi and caused by group I CoVs, sub-grouped as type I (genetically related to type I FCoV) and type II (classical mildly pathogenic strains, genetically more related to type II FCoV) (Pratelli, 2006) . Interestingly, some respiratory endemic CCoVs infections have been recently identified and assigned to a third CCoV that has been classified within group II on the basis of the genetic similarity with some bovine and HCoV (OC43) and evidence of the HE gene, suggesting a crossing of species barriers (Erles et al., 2003; Erles and Brownlie, 2005) . Furthermore, in recent studies a CCoV was associated with mortality in puppies that exhibited both gross pathology and histopathology changes indicative of canine parvovirus type 2 (CPV-2) infection (i.e. crypt necrosis), similarly to what was found in our case (Evermann et al., 2005) . No DNA analysis was performed to establish the specific CCoV genotype in these enteric lethal CPV2-like outbreaks. It is therefore not surprising that a highly pathogenic canine coronavirus would present with systemic pathological changes different from the classical enteric disease. The intestinal pattern found in our pup would be more suggestive of a CPV2 infection, despite the presence of autolytic changes that precluded the adequate assessment of the intestine for lesions, but no evidence of CPV was found with molecular tests in this dog . Additionally, adult ascarids are frequently detected in puppies and generally are not responsible for specific histological changes but may cause clinical disease by their physical presence (i.e. impaction).",

            "text": "FIP and SARS have some common features despite different pathogenetic mechanisms that are not completely understood (Gu et al., 2005; Perlman and Dandekar, 2005) . They both originate from highly pathogenic mutated CoV strains, and they are typically associated with severe alveolar damage within the lungs, marked fibrinous exudation, prominent histiocytic/macrophagic involvement (often in SARS with pronounced evidence of erythrophagocytosis) and lymphopenia (Gu et al., 2005) . All these features were evident in our case; specifically, lymphopenia was documented by the splenic lymphocytolysis and subsequently documented in experimental infections performed with this CCoV strain . In addition, in this case, positive immunohistochemical staining was detected in mononuclear phagocytes, suggesting a similarity to FIP in its pathogenesis in which virus-positive monocytes migrating through blood vessel walls are responsible for the vasculitis and perivasculitis and associated fibrinous/granulomatous lesions (Kipar et al., 2005) . Additional immunohistochemistry needs to be undertaken and other markers should be included for more precisely identify the positive staining cells as macrophages/histiocytes. Evaluation of additional cases may help our understanding of the role or vascular lesions in the pathogenesis of the disease. The latter may have been responsible for the renal infarcts and the abdominal effusion. A disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) associated with a respiratory failure can be considered as causes of death. Lack of visceral thrombi might be due either to a hyperacute course of the disease or to predominance of respiratory failure on DIC.",

Virus isolation in cell cultures confirmed the presence of coronavirus within the tissue and by RT-PCR a type II CCoV could be identified, with some mutations in non-structural genes when compared to other CCoVs . Although, several tissues (i.e. brain) were not submitted for histopathology, the submitted fresh tissue was positive for CCoVs and negative for other significant viruses (i.e. morbillivirus, parvovirus, adenovirus) when tested with molecular assays Decaro et al., 2005a) . The histopathologic changes found cannot rule out an enteric CPV2 infection in association with more classical canine respiratory diseases (i.e. Bordetella bronchiseptica, Mycoplasma spp, CAV-2). Virological and bacteriological investigations did not detect any other pathogens, and because no data was available about any treatment of this animal, concomitant and/or secondary respiratory bacterial infections cannot therefore be completely excluded. Nevertheless, our findings emphasise that CCoV infection can be systemic and fatal in dogs, but that they may also be mistaken for a different infection (morphological mimicry) and/or secondary lesions.",
