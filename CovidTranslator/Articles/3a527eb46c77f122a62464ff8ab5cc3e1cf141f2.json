            "text": "Zoonotic pathogens, including hantaviruses, are maintained in the environment by causing persistent infection in the absence of disease in their reservoir hosts. Spillover of hantaviruses to humans can cause severe disease that is mediated by excessive proinflammatory responses. The mechanisms mediating hantaviral persistence in rodent reservoirs remain largely unknown. Male Norway rats were inoculated with their species-specific hantavirus, Seoul virus (SEOV), and viral RNA, cytokine, and chemokine responses were evaluated in spleen and lung tissue. More viral RNA was detectable in the lungs than spleen, with copies of SEOV peaking 15-30 days postinoculation (p.i.) and persisting for 60 days p.i. In the lungs, the expression and production of proinflammatory mediators (i.e. IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3, CCL5, CCL2, CX3CL1, CXCL10, VCAM, VEGF, and NOS2) remained at or below baseline throughout SEOV infection; whereas, regulatory factors, including TGF-\u03b2 and FoxP3 were elevated. Conversely, in the spleen, proinflammatory responses were induced while regulatory responses remained unchanged during infection. To determine whether reduced proinflammatory responses mediate hantavirus persistence in the lungs, male rats were administered rIL-1\u03b2 or vehicle for 30 days during SEOV infection. SEOV persistence and shedding were not affected by IL-1\u03b2 treatment. Proinflammatory responses were elevated in rIL-1\u03b2-treated rats, but remained within physiological levels, suggesting that supra-physiological concentrations may be necessary for viral clearance at the cost of causing disease. Elevated regulatory responses may suppress excessively high proinflammatory responses at a site of elevated SEOV replication to contribute to viral persistence and prevent proinflammatory-mediated disease in reservoir hosts.",

In such highly coevolved systems, virulence and host antiviral responses have evolved to ensure survival of both the host and the pathogen [Hudson et al., 2002] . Several zoonotic viruses are persistently maintained in their natural reservoirs without causing disease, including Lassa virus in multimammate rats (Mastomys natalensis), SARS-CoV in horseshoe bat species (Rhinolophus spp.), Nipah virus in flying foxes (Pteropus spp.), Macupho virus in large vesper mice (Calomys callosus), Sin Nombre virus in deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus), and Seoul virus (SEOV) in Norway rats (Rattus norvegicus) [Botten et al., 2003; Calisher et al., 2006; Childs et al., 1989; Johnson et al., 1965; Walker et al., 1975; Wang et al., 2006] . Spillover of these viruses to incidental human hosts often results in host-mediated disease, including Lassa fever, SARS, Nipah virus-associated disease, Bolivian hemorrhagic fever, hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS), and hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS), respectively. Clinical symptoms in humans generally are caused by excessively elevated proinflammatory responses, often termed a \"cytokine storm\" [Huang et al., 2005; Khaiboullina and St Jeor, 2002; Mori et al., 1999; Villinger et al., 1999] .",

A notable exception is the persistence of an arenavirus, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), in mice (Mus musculus), which is mediated by suppression of CD8+ T cell and proinflammatory responses [Hahm et al., 2005; Moskophidis et al., 1993] . Suppression of proinflammatory and cytotoxic T cell responses can be caused by the activity of regulatory T cells, including production of TGF-\u03b2, and recent studies demonstrate that these cells contribute to persistence of hantaviruses in their rodent hosts Schountz et al., 2007] . During SEOV infection, expression of Foxp3 and production of TGF-\u03b2 is elevated during the persistent phase of infection at a site of elevated virus replication (i.e. lungs). Inactivation of regulatory T cells reduces persistence of SEOV in the lungs and the duration of shedding in rats . Whether host regulatory responses indirectly mediate hantavirus persistence through suppression of proinflammatory responses has not been examined and was one goal of the present study.",

In the lungs (i.e. a site of elevated SEOV replication), proinflammatory responses generally were reduced, whereas regulatory responses were elevated throughout infection. In the spleen (i.e. a site of low SEOV replication and high immunological activity), proinflammatory responses were elevated and regulatory responses were not induced during infection. To establish whether reduced proinflammatory responses mediate SEOV persistence in rats, exogenous IL-1\u03b2 was administered at physiological levels throughout infection. Moderate elevation of proinflammatory cytokines, including IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1, did not reduce SEOV persistence, as initially hypothesized. Thus, these data illustrate that the balance between proinflammatory responses clearing virus and causing immunopathology may be tightly regulated in highly co-evolved host-pathogen systems.",

Serial dilutions of control cDNA from selected rats were used to generate a standard curve, ranging from 2.5 ng/\u03bcl to 25 pg/\u03bcl cDNA, which was run on each plate. Gene expression patterns from SEOV infected animals were normalized to Gapdh expression and are presented as relative to the expression levels from uninfected rats (i.e. Day 0 p.i.) and expressed as fold change.",

In humans, concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines are elevated during acute hantavirus infection and if survival is the final outcome, then virus is cleared [Krakauer et al., 1995; Mori et al., 1999] . Proinflammatory responses are consistently reduced or remain unchanged in male rats at sites of elevated virus replication, throughout SEOV infection. Whether the lack of induction of proinflammatory responses directly influences the ability of SEOV to persist in its host in the absence of clinical pathology was evaluated by administering rIL-1\u03b2 or vehicle during the course of infection at a dose (1 \u03bcg/day, s.c.) reported to elevate circulating IL-1\u03b2 without causing manifestations of sickness [Busbridge et al., 1993] . Because we were interested in the role of proinflammatory cytokines in mediating SEOV persistence, the effects of exogenous IL-1\u03b2 were measured at a time-point during persistent infection when viral replication was high (i.e. Day 30 p.i.). Administration of rIL-1\u03b2 significantly elevated circulating concentrations of IL-1\u03b2, as well as expression of Il6 and Tnf\u03b1 in the lungs, as compared with uninfected rats that were administered vehicle alone ( Figure 5 ; IL-1\u03b2: T = 17.5, P = 0.032; Il6: t = -2.13, df = 7, P = 0.071; Tnf\u03b1: t = -2.52, df = 7, P = 0.04). Administration of exogenous IL-1\u03b2 did not, however, affect the amount of SEOV RNA in the lungs and saliva nor did it affect the proportion of rats shedding virus in saliva ( Figure 6A and B) .",

Hantaviruses do not appear to cause cytopathic effects in their rodent hosts, but whether apoptosis occurs has not been determined [Botten et al., 2000; Yanagihara et al., 1985] . Similar percentages of apoptotic cells were observed in the lungs of uninfected male rats and males infected with SEOV for 30 days; exogenous administration of rIL-1\u03b2 had no effect on the number of cells undergoing apoptosis ( Figure 6D ).

Following the innate response to hantavirus infection, hantavirus-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells are recruited to infected tissues and overall activity of CD8+ T cells (e.g. production of IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1) is elevated during symptomatic hantavirus infection in humans and contributes to the manifestations of disease and mortality [Ennis et al., 1997; Kilpatrick et al., 2004; Klingstrom et al., 2006; Terajima et al., 2007] .",

The absence or suppression of chemokine stimulation in the lungs of male rats may contribute to reduced lymphocyte infiltration to sites of viral replication, which may prevent proinflammatory-mediated pathology and contribute to viral persistence. Reduced expression of Nos2 in the lungs of infected male rats suggests that macrophage activity may be reduced during SEOV infection [Lyons et al., 1992] . By contrast, proinflammatory responses, including production of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, were elevated in the spleen. Male rats that are infected with SEOV do not appear to be globally immunosuppressed, but rather have a site-specific reduction of proinflammatory responses. There is no evidence that male rats that are naturally infected with SEOV are more likely to acquire additional pathogens, further demonstrating that infected rats are not immunocompromised during hantavirus infection . Responses mounted in the spleen may represent an attempt by the rodent host to control viral replication, but do not appear to eliminate viral RNA in other organs.",

Regulatory T cells (CD4+CD25+FoxP3+) contribute to the persistence of several pathogens, including hantaviruses, by suppressing host proinflammatory and effector T cell responses locally at the site of infection [Belkaid and Rouse, 2005; Schountz et al., 2007] . Consistent with previous data, the expression of Foxp3 and the production of TGF-\u03b2 were elevated in the lungs, but not in the spleen, during persistent SEOV infection in male rats . The effects of regulatory T cells on virus persistence likely are mediated by TGF-\u03b2, and not IL-10, as IL-10 transcription and synthesis consistently was suppressed in both the lungs and spleen throughout infection. Functional inactivation of regulatory T cells eliminates the suppression of proinflammatory cytokines in the lungs during the persistent phase of SEOV infection in male rats , but whether regulatory T cells suppress proinflammatory or CD8+ T cell responses to mediate hantavirus persistence in rodents has not been determined.",

            "text": "To test the hypothesis that suppression of proinflammatory responses during infection may be a critical component of hantavirus persistence in rodents, IL-1\u03b2 was manipulated in vivo. Male rats were administered doses of rIL-1\u03b2 that elevated circulating IL-1\u03b2 and expression of IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 in their lungs, but that did not cause pathology, as is observed in humans during acute hantavirus infection [Khaiboullina and St Jeor, 2002; Krakauer et al., 1995; Mori et al., 1999] . Treatment of male rats with physiological doses of rIL-1\u03b2 had no effect on the amount of SEOV RNA present in the lungs or shed in saliva. From these data, we conclude that suppression of proinflammatory cytokines below baseline concentrations may not be the critical factor in mediating SEOV persistence, as elevation of proinflammatory cytokines within physiological ranges is not sufficient to affect persistence of SEOV in rats. Supra-physiological concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines may be necessary for viral clearance, but at the cost of causing immunopathology and disease. An alternative hypothesis is that enhanced regulatory T cell activity in the lungs may reduce local CD8+ T cell responses to cause SEOV persistence. Several viruses, including LCMV and HCV suppress CD8+ T cell activity to establish and maintain persistent infection [Moskophidis et al., 1993; Neumann-Haefelin et al., 2007] and although a non-natural host, in newborn mice, Hantaan virus persistence is correlated with reduced IFN\u03b3-producing CD8+ T cells [Araki et al., 2004] . Whether SEOV-specific CD8+ T cell activity (e.g. production of IFN-\u03b3 and TNF\u03b1) is altered by infection requires further investigation.",

Additionally, cyclical accumulation of deletions and insertions in areas of the SEOV genome necessary for the initiation of transcription has been observed in infected VeroE6 cells and presents another alternative mechanism of virusmediated persistence .

Future studies must continue to determine whether hantaviral persistence, mediated by regulatory T cells in the lungs, is due to suppression of excessively high proinflammatory or CD8+ T cell responses at a site of elevated virus replication that may otherwise be necessary for viral clearance.
