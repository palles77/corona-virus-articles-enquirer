            "text": "Feline leukaemia virus (FeLV) is an enveloped singlestranded RNA virus belonging to the Retroviridae family, genus Gammaretrovirus, and it infects feline species. The predominant subgroup, designated FeLV-A, represents the transmissible form of the virus spread cat to cat in nature and from which the other subgroups, FeLV-B, 1,2 FeLV-C and FeLV-T, 3 arise de novo during the course of infection. [4] [5] [6] The infection is common worldwide and is transmitted by secretions via the oronasal route, predominantly by prolonged contact, but also by direct inoculation. 7 Feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) is a member of the Lentivirus genus within the Retroviridae family and it infects species of the families Felidae and Hyaenidae. 8 It causes an acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) in cats, resembling AIDS caused by HIV in humans. Transmission is usually by direct inoculation (eg, bite and scratch wounds). The strains are grouped into seven phylogenetic subtypes A-F and U-NZenv. [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] Distribution of discovered subtypes is illustrated in Figure 1 . 11, [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] To test the infection status of cats, point-of-care ELISA tests are widely used, which detect antibodies against the p24 protein of FIV and the p27 antigen of FeLV. The most frequent test used to confirm ELISA results, or in case of false/non-interpretable results, is PCR. 26 Studies report a relative low prevalence of these viruses worldwide. In North America, FeLV prevalence ranges between 2.3% and 7.5%, and is 2% in Australia, whereas in Europe it is slightly higher (3.6-15.6%). FIV prevalence levels are quite similar: 2.5-7.5% in North America, 15% in Australia and 3.2-8.3% in Europe. [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence of these retrovirus infections in domestic cats in Hungary, to evaluate the main factors affecting the infection rate and to examine the phylogenetic relations of the FIV strains detected.",

Nucleic acid was eluted in 60 \u03bcl RNase-free distilled water (Qiagen). The preparation of endpoint PCR for FIV, TopTaq Master Mix Kit (Qiagen) was used in accordance with manufacturer's instructions: 25 \u03bcl master mix, 0.5 \u03bcl forward primer (40 \u03bcM), 0.5 \u03bcl reverse primer (40 \u03bcM), 5 \u03bcl CoralLoad Concentrate, 18 \u03bcl RNase-free water and 1 \u03bcl template DNA, and were mixed together for each sample. The hot-start PCR amplification with the given protocol was carried out as follows: 95\u00b0C for 15 mins; 95\u00b0C for 45 s, 60\u00b0C for 45 s and 72\u00b0C for 1 min (40 cycles); and 72\u00b0C for 15 mins. The FIV primers used in the study amplify early reverse transcription products (process of reverse transcription Figure 1 Worldwide distribution of feline immunodeficiency virus subtypes (map scheme: www.outline-world-map.com). Subtypes A and B are spread widely, subtypes C, D, E, F and U-NZenv are distributed only regionally RNA to DNA); both bind in the long terminal repeat (LTR) region, which enables the detection of low-dose and/or recent infections (primer sensitivity was 10 2 -10 3 cell-associated virus). 41, 42 For the detection of FeLV, a One Step RT-PCR Kit (Qiagen) was used. A master mix containing 5.7 \u03bcl RNase-free water, 2 \u03bcl 5\u00d7 buffer, 0.4 \u03bcl dNTP, 0.4 \u03bcl enzyme mix, 0.1 \u03bcl RNase inhibitor, 0.2 \u03bcl forward primer (40 \u03bcM) and 0.2 \u03bcl reverse primer (40 \u03bcM) were added into tubes for each sample (0.5 \u03bcl each). The amplification was 50\u00b0C for 30 mins and 94\u00b0C for 3 mins (reverse transcription and initial denaturation); 95\u00b0C for 15 s, 60\u00b0C for 1 min and 72\u00b0C for 1 min (45 cycles); and 72\u00b0C for 10 mins. FeLV primers were obtained from a publication. 43 The 163 base pair (bp) (FIV) and 150 bp (FeLV) long amplicons were visualised by electrophoresis in 1.5% agarose gel.",

Previous publications and our statistics show a higher occurence of retroviral infection in intact (usually male) outdoor cats. 53 Another possible explanation for the higher observed prevalence data could be the weak positive predictive value of every diagnostic test that does not have 100% specificity in the case of low prevalence rates in a population ('false positive paradox').",

In the case of FIV, the Witness test detects antibodies, whereas the PCR amplifies and detects part of the LTR region of the virus. In the early stages of infection there are no detectable antibodies (most cats produce antibodies within 8 weeks of exposure); 54 moreover, there might be extremely low levels of antibodies in the terminal phase of the disease, causing a false-negative ELISA result, whereas the PCR result will be positive as a result of increased viral load in the circulation. 37 However, a positive ELISA and negative PCR result can suggest extremely low levels of circulating proviral DNA/viral RNA (which can be the case in the asymptomatic phase of FIV infection) or viral genetic diversity (where nucleotide sequence dissimilarity can result in failure of primer binding). 37 The presence and interference of maternal antibodies with the ELISA can be excluded in our cases, as the youngest animals included in the study (5-6 months of age) were FIV negative. Maternal antibodies can be present in kittens up to 6 months of age. 55 In the case of FeLV, the Witness test detects the p27 antigen, whereas the PCR amplifies and detects the U3 part of the LTR region. A negative ELISA and positive PCR result can also suggest an early phase of infection or illness in a regressive stage, when small amounts of proviral DNA/viral RNA are already present in the circulation, but the amount of the antigen is still below detectable levels.",

FeLV-FIV coinfection was observed in 10 (0.03%) cats. In some cases, only the ELISA test or the PCR test was positive. In the case of FIV, 11/51 ELISA tests and 4/47 PCR test results were positive, when the parallel assay was negative. In the case of FeLV, 4/44 ELISA results and 14/58 PCR results were single-positive. Total apparent prevalence, counted from data obtained with the Witness test, was 14.03 (95% confidence interval [CI] 10.72-18.16) in the case of FeLV and 15.22 (95% CI 11.77-19.46) in the case of FIV. True prevalence was also calculated with the previously estimated sensitivity and specificity of the Witness test: 11.78 (95% CI 8.08-16.4) for FeLV and 9.89 (95% CI 5.93-14.75) for FIV. Apparent prevalences calculated from the PCR results were 17.31 (95% CI 13.64-21.73) and 13.13 (95% CI 9.93-17.17) for FeLV and FIV, respectively. Cross-compliance was analysed by calculating Cohen's \u03ba coefficient. P = 0.033) times higher chance of infection with FeLV and a 4.14 (95% CI 1.62-14.07; P = 0.0083) times higher chance of FIV was found in correlation with outdoor access, according to the Witness test results. Calculating the PCR results, a 2.51 (95% CI 1.156-6.29; P = 0.0306) and a 3.41 (95% CI 1.32-11.64; P = 0.0235) times higher possibility was found in correlation with FeLV and FIV infection, respectively. No significant correlation was found with the animals' age regarding FeLV infection (either with results of ELISA or PCR), but a 1.12 times higher chance (both with the Witness test and PCR [95% CI 1.04-1.19 (P = 0.0012) for ELISA] and [95% CI 1.04-1.19 (P = 0.0014) for PCR])",
