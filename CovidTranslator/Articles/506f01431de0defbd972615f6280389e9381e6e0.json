In March 2017, the World Health Organization (WHO) convened a meeting to identify policies and activities to promote access to vaccination of older adults, specifically in LMICs. Participants included academic and industry researchers, funders, civil society organizations, implementers of global health interventions, and stakeholders from developing countries with adult immunization needs. These experts reviewed vaccine performance in older adults, the anticipated impact of adult vaccination programs, and the challenges and opportunities of building or strengthening an adult and older adult immunization platforms. Key conclusions of the meeting were that there is a need for discussion of new opportunities for vaccination of all adults as well as for vaccination of older adults, as reflected in the recent shift by WHO to a life-course approach to immunization; that immunization in adults should be viewed in the context of a much broader model based on an individual's abilities rather than chronological age; and that immunization beyond infancy is a global priority that can be successfully integrated with other interventions to promote healthy ageing. As WHO is looking ahead to a global Decade of Healthy Ageing starting in 2020, it will seek to define a roadmap for interdisciplinary collaborations to integrate immunization with improving access to preventive and other healthcare interventions for adults worldwide.",

The World Health Organization (WHO) convened a meeting in March 2017 to review policies on immunization of adults (with a focus on older adults), to discuss vaccine performance in this group and to review the pipeline of vaccines under development that might be of benefit to adults and older adults in the future. While the meeting was relevant to HICs as well as LMICs, the focus was intentionally on the latter. The only vaccines with WHO recommendations for specific use in elderly adults are influenza vaccines [1] , therefore influenza and influenza prevention represented an important case study and area of discussion in the meeting for vaccine policy and implementation needs globally. Finally, the meeting aimed to discuss the challenges and opportunities for strengthening adult immunization in LMICs and to identify activities and policies that can be pursued to this end.",

Participants included academic and industry researchers, funders, civil society organizations, implementers of global health interventions, and stakeholders from developing countries with adult immunization needs. The agenda and list of participants are in the Online Supplement. The two-day meeting was organized around a series of background topic areas, followed by case studies in LMICs, and then discussion on data needs for policies and investments of vaccine programs targeting older adults.

            "text": "Healthy ageing is defined by the WHO as ''the process of developing and maintaining the functional ability that enables wellbeing in older age\" [11] . This ability depends on both an individual's physical and mental capacities and on the environments one inhabits (for example access to transport and assistive devices) [10] . As described in the WHO's World Report on Ageing and Health [11] , while intrinsic capacity tends to decline with increasing age, a primary characteristic of older ages is great diversity. Even in the poorest settings, an eighty year old may be healthy, independent, and vibrant, while a sixty year old may need significant care and support. Chronological age is thus a poor marker of health state, and there is no fixed age when someone becomes ''old\". Furthermore, this diversity is often a consequence of the cumulative impacts of advantage or disadvantage across a person's life. This means that those with the greatest health needs in older age may have the least access to the specific required resources. In any population in the second half of life, three groups can be proposed: those with high and stable capacity; those with decreasing capacity; and those with substantial loss of capacity [10] , although individuals can transition between these states. Rather than defining target groups for vaccination solely by their chronological age, assessing an individual's level of capacity may add important information on their need for vaccination, response to vaccination, or the functional benefits likely to arise. For example, where a vaccine is currently recommended for those above 65 years [12] , some individuals may benefit from vaccination at an earlier age because of declining capacity. While implementing this approach would require development and adoption of simple and robust measures of capacity in a clinical setting, discussions of this topic may be beneficial in order to better understand optimal target groups for vaccination.",

Countries considering strengthening immunization platforms for older adults would benefit from strategies and lessons learned from similar efforts in other age groups [74] .

Some MICs have parts of their population with some characteristics of HIC and other parts that are under-developed. They could represent good settings to compare interventions in different subpopulations of the same country exposed to different conditions. In some settings, society places a lower value on the health of older people than that of children [101, 102] Promote change in societal values to recognize intergenerational connections",

Further, new ways to look at impact of vaccine programs, that take into account the contributions of healthy older adults and the consequences of their declining intrinsic capacities to society, are needed. Two clear conclusions from the meeting were that immunization of adults should be viewed as a key component of a comprehensive approach to health, and that protecting older adults from vaccine-preventable diseases might mean achieving high vaccine coverage in all age groups (including infants), and not simply older adults. Additionally, the need for vaccine research and development related to immunosenescence was identified, given the remarkable increase in the population of older adults.",

Equally important will be the need for a shift in overall thinking about providing protection against vaccine-preventable diseases, which has to date focused nearly exclusively on vaccination of infants [86] . Activities to improve coverage with infant vaccines should not diminish, but an increasing emphasis needs to be placed on lifecourse approach to immunization schedules to protect adults and older adults, especially given the significant and changing demographics of the global population. There is already some evidence from HICs of the benefits of using existing vaccines in older adults [49, 82] . Although the efficacy of some vaccines might be lower in older adults than is usually seen with infant vaccines, these data need to be viewed in the context of the increased risks from disease and broader social and economic benefits of prevention in older populations. Misconceptions about the benefits of vaccination of older adults should not prevent its use.",

The ''business case,\" that is, the direct and indirect associated health-care and broader societal costs and benefits, is critical to justify a life-course approach to vaccination.
