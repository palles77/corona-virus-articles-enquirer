The specificity of this recognition is conferred by the clonotypic \u03b1\u03b2 T cell receptor (TCR), which is made from two separate chains manufactured from variable (V), diversity (D), joining (J) and constant (C) gene fragments through a process of somatic gene rearrangement. This process involves nucleotide insertions and deletions at V(D)J junctions in each chain. The 'randomization' of V(D)J junctions and the fact that the TCR is a heterodimer of two separately rearranged chains results in a theoretical repertoire of >10 15 unique \u03b1\u03b2 TCRs in the mouse 2,3 . The theoretical number of possible TCRs in humans is likely to be orders of magnitude larger, as humans possess 54 TCR\u03b2 variable genes as compared with the 35 genes in mice, with all other variables being comparable 4 .",

            "text": "Abstract | Clonal selection theory proposed that individual T cells are specific for a single peptide-MHC antigen. However, the repertoire of \u03b1\u03b2 T cell receptors (TCRs) is dwarfed by the vast array of potential foreign peptide-MHC complexes, and a comprehensive system requires each T cell to recognize numerous peptides and thus be cross-reactive. This compromise on specificity has profound implications because the chance of any natural peptide-MHC ligand being an optimal fit for its cognate TCR is small, as there will almost always be more-potent agonists. Furthermore, any TCR raised against a specific peptide-MHC complex in vivo can only be the best available solution from the naive T cell pool and is unlikely to be the best possible solution from the substantially greater number of TCRs that could theoretically be produced. This 'systems view' of TCR recognition provides a plausible cause for autoimmune disease and substantial scope for multiple therapeutic interventions. The diversity of TCRs is based on the six complementarity-determining regions (CDRs), which engage both the peptide and the MHC molecule 5 (FIG. 1) . Typically, MHC class I and class II molecules present peptides from endogenous and exogenous antigens, respectively. The MHC class I molecule has a closed-ended peptide-binding groove and binds peptides of 8-14 amino acids in length. Longer peptides become increasingly distorted in the central region of the MHC class I molecule as the peptide length increases, resulting in peptide 'bulging' 6, 7 . By contrast, the ends of the MHC class II peptide-binding cleft are open, allowing even longer peptides to extend beyond this groove without bulging (FIG. 1b,c) .",

For many years the concept of huge numbers of TCRs successfully providing immunity to all foreign peptides in a 'one-clonotype-one-specificity' paradigm was accepted. However, several workers questioned this concept [10] [11] [12] [13] . Most notably, Don Mason called for the abandonment of such a notion in his seminal thesis on the topic (see REF. 10 ). Many of the reasons for this paradigm shift were based on the simple arithmetic of effective immunity requiring the recognition of >10 15 potential foreign peptides. Indeed, put in the context of 10 15 T cells weighing >500 kilograms, the notion of immune coverage by a naive pool of 10 15 monospecific TCRs as suggested by the clonal selection theory is clearly absurd 10 . There are only 10 12 T cells in a human, and more recent studies have estimated that there are <10 8 distinct TCRs in the human naive T cell pool 14 .",

            "text": "In humans, MHC molecules are encoded within the HLA locus. The HLA locus is the most polymorphic region of the human genome and is known to encode more than 7,000 allelic variants across the population, with a large number of these variants present at appreciable frequencies 15 . Some HLA loci are among the fastest evolving coding regions in the human genome 16 . Each individual expresses six different classical peptide-presenting HLA class I molecules (two HLA-A, two HLA-B and two HLA-C) and six HLA class II molecules (two HLA-DR, two HLA-DQ and two HLA-DP). The expression of a wide variety of HLA molecules ensures that individuals across the population present different antigenic peptides and provides the greatest chance that some individuals may survive any emerging infection. It is extremely difficult to link HLA diversity to past pandemics, but evidence of the importance of infectious diseases in driving HLA selection can be seen with current emerging infectious diseases. For example, homozygosity at HLA class I alleles results in faster disease progression during HIV infection 17 , and some HLA class I alleles are associated with lower viral loads and protection from disease 18 . Various factors in addition to T cell immunity are thought to contribute to the maintenance of HLA diversity, including natural killer cell recognition 19 , mate selection 20,21 and transmissible tumours 22 . Overall, the fact that mutations that alter the amino The closed ends of the MHC class I binding groove cause long peptides to 'bulge' out of the binding groove, and this bulging increases with each additional amino acid in the peptide. By contrast, the ends of the MHC class II binding cleft are open, which allows the accommodation of much longer peptides without the need for peptide kinking. d,e | The images show HLA-A*0201 (in grey) presenting the immunodominant GLCTLVAML peptide (stick model) from Epstein-Barr virus and HLA-DR4 (in grey) presenting a peptide from myelin basic protein (MBP). TCRs dock on a peptide-MHC complex in a diagonal mode that is conserved for binding to MHC class I and class II molecules. The colours indicate the docking footprints of the AS01 TCR 96 and MSC-2C8 TCR 97 on their cognate peptide-MHC complexes and show the 'footprints' on the MHC complex of the six CDR loops. In general, the germline-encoded CDR1 and CDR2 loops interact mainly with the MHC molecule itself, whereas the hypervariable CDR3 loops sit over the peptide. However, the small structural database that has been compiled to date already contains examples in which CDR1 and CDR2 make substantial interactions with the peptide and in which CDR3 has an important role in contacting the MHC molecule 98,99 . TCR binding degeneracy and structure The recognition by TCRs of all HLA molecules and a roughly conserved diagonal mode of binding on peptide-MHC complexes suggest that TCR interactions conform to some 'rules of engagement' (FIG. 1) . Such rules have been proffered in the form of a TCR 'interaction codon' 32 that interacts with MHC class II molecules, and in the form of a 'restriction triad' 7 that consists of three largely conserved residues in MHC class I molecules that interact with TCRs. These rules fit the generally observed arrangement of TCR-peptide-MHC interactions, in which the germline-encoded (that is, non-rearranged) CDR1\u03b1, CDR1\u03b2, CDR2\u03b1 and CDR2\u03b2 elements of the TCR contact the germline element of the MHC molecule, whereas the non-germline (that is, somatically rearranged) CDR3\u03b1 and CDR3\u03b2 loops contact the 'random' peptide element (FIG. 1) . However, these convenient rules fail to match all the structures of TCR-peptide-MHC complexes that have been generated to date 5 , and MHC mutational studies show that the dependency on fixed pairwise interactions between a TCR and a peptide-MHC complex varies widely between individual TCRs 33 . The peptide-MHC complex itself can also change its confirmation following TCR binding [34] [35] [36] . Thus, it is clear that TCR-peptide-MHC interactions are not rigidly conserved but rather allow for considerable flexibility within the confines of some general orientation and binding rules.",

T cells are specific because any given T cell can recognize only a tiny fraction of the 'universe' of peptides that can be presented by any given MHC molecule, but they are multispecific because the peptide universe is so large. By way of example, a T cell that recognizes 1 million 10-mer (10-amino-acid) peptides will have less than a 1 in 10 million chance of recognizing any 10-mer peptide chosen at random from the entire peptide universe. These numbers indicate that if a T cell that recognizes 1 million different 10-mer peptides was tested for recognition of random 10-mer peptides at a rate of 1 every minute then on average it would take over 20 years before a cross-reaction was seen! Even the total number of overlapping peptides that can be made from the entire human proteome is an extremely small fraction of all possible peptides (for example, fewer than 10 7 of the total possible number of 10-mer peptides (>10 13 ) can be made from the human proteome).",

Thus, the sheer size of the possible peptide universe allows T cells to be enormously cross-reactive while appearing to be very specific within the environment in which they are required to operate. acid sequence of HLA class I and class II molecules are clustered around the peptidebinding cleft and often alter the peptide sequence that is preferentially bound by the HLA molecule [23] [24] [25] strongly suggests that HLA diversity is upheld to increase the variety of peptides displayed.",

This inevitable, extensive T cell cross-reactivity has some profound consequences, including providing a plausible cause for autoimmune disease. I also discuss how the consequences of TCR binding degeneracy offer substantial scope for multiple therapeutic interventions. The recently described 1E6 TCR -which was isolated from a patient with type 1 diabetes and which recognizes residues 15-24 of the preproinsulin molecule (PPI [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] presented in the context of HLA-A*0201 (REF. 45) -does not undergo structural rearrangements following ligand binding 46 but is still hugely cross-reactive. Despite a rigid 'lock and key' binding mode, T cells expressing the 1E6 TCR respond to over 1.3 million 10-mer peptides at least as strongly as they respond to the PPI 15-24 peptide 46, 47 . Peptides were identified that were >100-fold more potent than PPI 15-24 at activating 1E6 TCR-expressing T cells but that differed from PPI 15-24 at seven of the ten amino acid positions 47 . This promiscuity is explained by the structure of the 1E6 TCR-PPI 15-24 -HLA-A2 complex, in which the TCR exhibits peptide-centric binding that is focused on just two amino acids in the peptide 46 . This residue-focused mode of binding presumably allows for substitutions at other positions that, in some cases, must considerably stabilize the interaction. In another example of such peptide-centric binding, a single amino acid interchange within two HIV envelope epitopes was shown to reciprocally swap the specificities of two CD8 + T cell clones 48 , suggesting that a dominant focus on a single amino acid residue in the peptide within a peptide-MHC complex might be reasonably common. Indeed, the TCR-peptide-MHC structures that have been described to date show that usually only a few upward-facing residues from the peptide contribute to the inter action of the TCR with the peptide-MHC complex. Thus, data from the limited number of TCR structures available indicate that TCRs can exhibit substantial binding degeneracy by being extremely flexible and/or through a focused interaction that is dominated by a few peptide residues (FIG. 2) .",

Further compelling evidence that T cells can exhibit extensive cross-reactivity comes from studies with combinatorial peptide libraries that comprise almost all possible peptides of a particular length 11, 47, [53] [54] [55] [56] . These libraries are usually used as a series of sub-libraries laid out in positional-scanning format such that there is a sub-library with each amino acid fixed in each position and with all other positions made up of an equimolar mix of the remaining amino acids (of note, cysteine is generally excluded from the 'random' positions to avoid problems of oxidation) (see Supplementary information S1 (figure)). Studies with these libraries in T cell activation assays indicate that agonist ligands can contain several different amino acids at many positions. Several studies have gone on to use this approach to prove the 'Mason hypothesis' and show that individual T cell clones really can recognize over a million different individual peptides in the context of a single MHC molecule 47, 56, 57 .",

Memory T cells can recognize concentrations of a peptide antigen that are >50-fold lower than those recognized by naive T cells 58, 59 , and individual T cell clones can generate progeny with both high and low antigen sensitivities 60 . Antigen sensitivity can be regulated by changes in TCR expression levels or clustering on the cell surface, by changes in the expression or function of co-stimulatory molecules, by differential control of phosphatase pathways that dampen T cell signalling or by alterations in the glycosylation status of the TCR or other cell-surface molecules (reviewed in REF. 61 ). Although these mechanisms may regulate the antigen sensitivity of T cells, and thus the ability of T cells to cross-recognize weak TCR ligands, it is difficult to conceive how they might be used to tune the biophysics of TCR engagement with a specific ligand. By contrast, the CD4 and CD8 glycoproteins have a unique role in 'co-receiving' peptide-MHC molecules by binding to largely invariant sites on MHC class II and MHC class I molecules, respectively 62 . Thus, these coreceptors might possess an ability to differentially regulate the responsiveness of the TCR to the ligand and thereby modulate TCR specificity 63 . Indeed, CD8 is known to affect both the on-rate 64,65 and off-rate 66,67 of TCR-peptide-MHC class I engagement and therefore can modulate the kinetics of TCR binding by different peptide-MHC ligands. We have demonstrated how the strength of the peptide-MHC class I-CD8 interaction can have substantial effects on T cell cross-reactivity 53 . It is important to realize that, although the TCR sequence is invariant, TCR sensitivity to agonist ligands (and therefore T cell cross-reactivity) is not fixed and can be varied throughout development by a number of parameters 53 .",

First, a cross-reactive T cell repertoire generates a near perfect solution to the huge challenge of providing effective immune cover by allowing a limited number of T cells to provide immunity against virtually all foreign peptides that can bind to self MHC molecules. Second, a system with a limited number of hugely cross-reactive T cells is both temporally and spatially favourable, as far fewer T cells are needed to scan any infected cell than if the clonal selection theory was rigidly upheld. Third, the corollary of extensive T cell crossreactivity is that several TCRs are likely to recognize any one peptide (and thus that T cell responses are polyclonal). Polyclonal recognition of peptide-MHC molecules makes it substantially more difficult for pathogens to escape immune recognition, as a mutation that escapes recognition by one TCR might be recognized by another.

Similarly, CD8 + T cells specific for the human papillomavirus HLA-A2-restricted YMLDLQPET peptide also recognize the HLA-A2-restricted TMLDIQPED peptide from coronavirus 72 .

Although strongly selfreactive T cells are deleted in the thymus 50 , weakly cross-reactive T cells may survive and become activated in the periphery through the cross-recognition of peptides from infectious agents, a phenomenon known as molecular mimicry [78] [79] [80] [81] . Memory T cells can be stimulated by peptide concentrations more than 50-fold lower than those required to stimulate naive T cells 58, 59 . It is therefore likely that a memory T cell could be stimulated by a cross-reactive peptide with an affinity for the TCR that is far lower than that of the original pathogen-derived peptide. In such a situation, pathogen-mediated priming would be obligatory before functional crossrecognition of a self peptide, a notion that is consistent with the observation that infection can precipitate autoimmune diseases 79, 82 .",

Indeed, yeast display 83 , phage display 84 and computational design 85, 86 have been used to produce TCRs that bind to peptide-MHC complexes with extremely high affinities (K d <10 pM) and half-lives of many hours. The MHC class I pathway is predicted to present at least one peptide at the cell surface from every internally produced protein 10 . This allows TCRs to potentially target any cell based on its expression of any protein (FIG. 4a) . Consequently, TCRs might have considerable advantages over regular antibody-based therapies, as they can target a substantially greater number of cellular proteins. Furthermore, there is now substantial evidence that it is possible to improve the affinity of almost any peptide antigen for a given natural TCR. Thus, there is ample scope for the rational design of therapeutic interventions that exploit the fact that most natural TCR-peptide-MHC interactions can be improved upon.",

APLs can have advantages over natural ligands, as they can bind strongly to TCRs and can break tolerance to self ligands (including tumour-derived ligands). Previous assumptions about APLs, such as the suggestion that altering a buried anchor residue will not substantially alter TCR binding, have proved to be incorrect 93 . Nevertheless, combinatorial screening of peptide (or non-peptide) ligands can be used to determine the preferred binding 'landscape' of any TCR and circumvent the requirement for any assumptions. The nature of the system makes it highly likely that each TCR has a different preferred binding landscape. This then enables relatively precise targeting of specific TCRs within populations of antigen-specific T cells through a process termed TCR-optimized peptide skewing of the repertoire of T cells (TOPSORT), which can be used to sort the most effective clonotypes (FIG. 5) . The widespread applicability of Figure 4 | Enhanced TCRs as soluble therapies. a | The MHC class I presentation pathway presents peptides at the cell surface from intracellular proteins. This potentially allows soluble high-affinity 'monoclonal' T cell receptors (TCRs) to target any cell based on its expression of any protein. 'Monoclonal' TCRs are able to use the MHC class I presentation pathway to 'see inside' cells and scan them for internal anomalies. This 'X-ray vision' opens up access to a far greater range of disease-relevant antigens than are available for monoclonal antibodies. TCRs can be engineered to deliver a variety of molecules that stimulate or suppress the immune system. Potential 'payloads' include antibody Fab fragments that then deliver a signal to immune cells. As MHC-bound peptides are often present at low copy numbers (<50 copies per cell), the payloads delivered by TCRs must act at very low concentrations. b | High-affinity tumour-specific TCRs that are manufactured as bispecific T cell-engaging molecules by linking them to CD3-specific Fab fragments can direct the lysis of tumour cells by CD8 + T cells and thereby induce the regression of established tumours 92 . These molecules do not activate T cells as monomers at the concentrations used. T cell-engaging TCRs bind to the cognate antigen on the tumour cell surface with long half-lives and 'present' the linked CD3-specific Fab fragments. These Fab fragments then crosslink TCRs on the surface of antigen-experienced CD8 + T cells, resulting in cellular activation and elimination of the target cell 92 . The delivery of toxins with soluble TCRs is not recommended, as the soluble TCR constructs are taken up by scavenging cells such as macrophages. Thus, molecules that deliver a particular signal to a specific effector cell are preferable. For example high-affinity TCRs could be used to downregulate immune responses by signalling through inhibitory receptors such as cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA4) (not shown). this approach is dependent on the effective clonotype being 'public' 94 (that is, occurring in all individuals with the restricting HLA molecule) or having a public motif that is shared by all individuals with the relevant HLA molecule. Our own preliminary studies using ex vivo peripheral blood mononuclear cells show that this approach can be used to skew the clonotypes that respond to a tumour antigen (J. Ekeruche-Makinde et al., unpublished observations). A similar approach could be used to skew the clonotypes induced by a vaccination against HIV towards those that are known to be more difficult for HIV to escape from.",

Clonotypic T cell receptors (TCRs) that recognize the same antigen are not all equal, and one TCR may provide the most effective immunity. In the case of HIV for example, one TCR may be more difficult for the virus to escape from than other TCRs. If the required TCR is public (that is, it occurs in all individuals with the restricting HLA molecule) or has a public-type motif, then a TCR-optimized peptide for this clonotype could be used to skew the response towards the most effective clonotype(s).
