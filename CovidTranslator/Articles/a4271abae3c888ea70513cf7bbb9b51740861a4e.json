Two 200 \u03bcL BAL aliquots were centrifuged at 18,000 \u00d7 g for 2 hrs at 4\u00b0C. DNA and RNA were separately extracted from 100 \u03bcL of each supernatant and pellet (AllPrep DNA/RNA kit, Qiagen, Valencia, CA). The cDNA syntheses were carried out using a first strand kit and random hexamer primer (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). DOP-PCR was carried out separately on DNA and cDNA purified from one BAL aliquot in a reaction containing 1.5 mM MgCl 2 , 10 mM KCl, 10 mM Tris pH 8.4, 200 \u03bcM dNTP, 2.4 \u03bcM DOP primer (5'-CCGACTCGAGINNNNNNTGTGG-3') and 2.5 U Low DNA Taq (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA); cycling conditions were 5 min at 95\u00b0C; 5 cycles of 1 min at 94\u00b0C, 1.5 min at 30\u00b0C, slow ramping to 72\u00b0C at 0.2\u00b0C/sec, and 3 min extension at 72\u00b0C; and 35 cycles of 1 min at 94\u00b0C, 1 min at 55\u00b0C, and 2 min extension at 72\u00b0C, with the addition of 14 seconds per cycle to each extension step. DOP-PCR products were analyzed and purified by gel electrophoresis (results for cDNA are shown in Figure 1a ). Four individual bands were purified from the cDNA amplification and ligated into a TOPO-TA cloning vector and transformed into competent bacteria (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). DOP-PCR of DNA extracted from the BAL yielded a non-discrete smear consistent with non-specific amplification of cellular nucleic acids, and was not analyzed further. Sequencing was performed using a 3130xl Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Sequences from the obtained clones were compared with the non-redundant (nr) database in GenBank using TBLASTX (NCBI, Bethesda, MD).",

However, we detected signals in supernatant as well as in pellets, implying that both virus capsids and free viral nucleic acid were present.

Our findings imply that the DOP-PCR based universal virus assay is useful for finding viruses in patient samples where other methods have failed to identify a pathogen. This can be particularly important when sample quantity is limited, making it difficult to perform many additional tests. A single generic assay that is capable of detecting all DNA and RNA viral genomes, paired with an appropriate purification technique, thus has significant advantages. The major strength of the DOP assay is its ability to amplify viral sequences without prior knowledge of those sequences, increasing the likelihood of finding mutated or novel viruses or viruses with substantial sequence heterogeneity, including as-yet undiscovered, unexpected, or non-human viruses. This is of major importance because most (about 75%) emerging infectious diseases and 80% of select agents are of zoonotic origin 6 .",

As compared with amplification methodologies using primers based on consensus sequences shared among related viruses 7,8,9 (e.g., those that were used to discover new herpes viruses 10 and to identify West Nile virus as the etiologic agent of human encephalitis in the New York outbreak 11 ), the DOP assay does not require the performance of multiple assays directed at different virus families, which may be impractical when sample is limited. The DOP assay also does not require accurate sequence information for each virus included in the screening 12 in order to establish the assay, as do consensus primer and microarray-based techniques. Other recently described alternatives to classical virological methods used to identify a new arenavirus 13 , a virus linked to colony collapse disorder of bees 14 and a polyomavirus playing a role in human Merkel cell carcinoma 15 use a combination of degenerate PCR and high-throughput sequencing, an approach that can be expensive and is not readily available. Enrichment of viral nucleic acids in the present approach permits identification of viral sequences even by traditional sequencing, making this approach accessible to laboratories with access to PCR, cloning, and standard sequencing. The DOP-PCR assay requires three days from sample receipt to sequence.",
