Since then, at least 33 other countries have been affected and there is a possibility of a global outbreak. A tremendous amount of effort has been made to understand its transmission dynamics; however, the temporal and spatial transmission heterogeneity and changing epidemiology have been mostly ignored. The epidemic mechanism of COVID-19 remains largely unclear.",

To describe the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 at different spatio-temporal scales, we used a three-stage continuous-time Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) meta-population model based on the characteristics and transmission dynamics of each stage: 1) local epidemic from December 1, 2019 to January 9, 2020; 2) long-distance spread due to the Spring Festival travel rush from January 10 to 22, 2020; and 3) intra-provincial transmission from January 23, 2020 when travel restrictions were imposed. Together with the basic reproduction number (\u0734 ) for mathematical modelling, we also considered the variation in infectivity and introduced the controlled reproduction number (\u0734 ) by assuming that exposed individuals to be infectious; we then simulated the future spread of COVID across Wuhan and all the provinces in mainland China. In addition, we built a novel source tracing algorithm to infer the initial exposed number of individuals in Wuhan on January 10, 2020, to estimate the number of infections early during this epidemic.",

There had been 2,666 deaths in China, of whom most were elderly people or people having underlying health conditions. While sustained human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is clear, there remain many questions about specific transmission characteristics of the virus 3 . Because disease control efforts change dramatically over time and vary across geographic regions, the epidemic of COVID-19 shows temporal and spatial transmission patterns. The few studies to date on transmission modelling and forecasting of COVID-19 have estimated the basic reproduction number (R 0 ) based on limited data in the early stage of the COVID-19 epidemic 4-8 , commonly with an assumption of no changes in the dynamics of transmission, surveillance and control of the epidemic. Transmission and disease control change over time and the epidemic mechanism of COVID-19 still remains largely unclear. In this study, we developed a spatial-temporal transmission model for the spread of COVID-19 in China. We characterized the transmission dynamics in three epidemic stages defined by population movement (Lunar New Year (Spring Festival)), implementation of control measures and location. Instead of applying the commonly-used \u0734 metric to describe infectivity, we estimated the controlled reproduction number, \u0734 , and forecasted the future trend of this epidemic for different provinces of mainland China. We also retrospectively estimated the number of individuals infected in the early stage of the epidemic when under-reporting was common.",

Heilongjiang and Jilin in northeast China, and some provinces (e.g., Gansu and Guizhou) had relatively large values of \u0734 , for which there is currently no clear explanation. Further investigation of local disease spread conditions are warranted.The dynamics of the epidemic was also time-varying, and the commonly-used basic reproduction number \u0734 does not take this variation of infectivity into account.

Most provinces reached their epidemic peaks between February 1 and 16, 2020. The nationwide epidemic peak, excluding Hebei province, occurred on February 3, but there are some uncertainties concerning the potential second great population movement brought by the resumption of work and education 18. We also calculated the maximum number of infectious individuals, which is another key indicator for epidemic control. Our simulation results revealed that most provinces would approach the peak of total confirmed cases before April, assuming that the epidemic in each province evolves independently without a large inter-provincial population movement. Since Spring Festival holidays are largely extended, a huge returning flow of population can invalidate our assumption and therefore model predictions.
