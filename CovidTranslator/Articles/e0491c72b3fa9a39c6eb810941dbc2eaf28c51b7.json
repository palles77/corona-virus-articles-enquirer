An apparatus used to grow protein crystals in capillaries and to compare the background X-ray scattering of the components, including thin-walled glass capillaries against Teflon, and various fluorocarbon oils against each other, is described. Using thaumatin as a test case at 1.8 \u00c5 resolution, this study demonstrates that high-resolution electron density maps and refined models can be obtained from in situ diffraction of crystals grown in microcapillaries.",

The in situ collection of X-ray diffraction data from macromolecular crystals could significantly decrease the time and effort with which structures are obtained. Furthermore, by eliminating loop handling, the gene-to-structure pathway is streamlined, and crystals are less prone to damage caused by mechanical and environmental shock. While crystals from microcapillaries can be easily extracted for cryocooling (Zheng et al., 2004) , the in situ method is not amenable to flash-cryocooling in general, making radiation damage a significant disadvantage. However, data sets from multiple isomorphic crystals can be used to overcome this drawback. With the advent of improved data processing software and faster CCD detectors (Yagi et al., 2004) , this approach is now more feasible.",

Commercial products (Watanabe, 2005) are now offered that can be used for plate-based X-ray exposures, for predicting resolution limit and space group. These products are impractical for complete data collection because of crystal dehydration and obstruction of the X-ray beam by the crystal container. In this paper, in situ collection is used in conjunc-tion with a modern crystallization screening technique, where thin glass capillaries are filled with approximately 100 (replicate or unique) 20 nl microbatch trials (naming such capillaries as 'microcapillaries') via poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) stamp-based microfluidics (Chen et al., 2005; Tice et al., 2003) . The aqueous 'plugs', containing protein and precipitant, are separated by immiscible fluorocarbon oil at both ends ( Fig. 1) . This system has been used previously to obtain space-group and unit-cell information from crystal diffraction at room temperature (Zheng et al., 2004) . In the present study, microcapillaries containing plugs which have crystals are mounted directly in a coldstream set to 277 K, and multiple frames of diffraction data are collected using synchrotron radiation. Despite the lack of cryocooling, here we demonstrate that sub-2.0 \u00c5 data sets and refined models are achievable, and that the collection of data from multiple crystals is convenient, given the large number of microbatch trials in a single capillary.",

We suggest that this steadfastness may be a consequence of the small 20 nl volumes and small dimensions of the plugs. The inertial effects for fluids become less significant at lower values of the Reynolds number. The Reynolds number decreases as the dimensions of the system decrease, as viscosity increases and as velocity of fluid flow decreases. The confinement of crystals at the water/fluorocarbon or the water/ glass interface may provide additional stability. Furthermore, data collection on home sources necessitates the use of much larger crystals, which often dislodge owing to gravity. The intense synchrotron beam allows much smaller samples to be used, which are less likely to be dislodged.",

As an initial proof of concept, we have biased our experiments towards large crystals of thaumatin (100 mm scale), offsetting primary radiation damage effects which are independent of temperature. For crystals of this size, the total radiation exposures required for minimally complete data sets are well below the Henderson (1990) limit. Secondary damage from the diffusion of reactive radiolytic products is likely to be a much larger effect in the case of non-frozen microcapillaries than it is in flash-cryocooled experiments. We tried to minimize secondary damage and local heating effects by setting the cold stream to 277 K. Despite these measures we can still, as expected, observe weakening of diffraction spots much more rapidly than is typically seen under cryoconditions. This can be observed in both data sets by the decreased overall intensities between the initial and final frames, and in the decreased signal-to-noise ratios of the outer shell of reflections between the initial and final frames ( Table 1) .",

The final difference in unit-cell lengths for both data sets is only about 0.1%. There is no clear inflection point or threshold that would indicate a reasonable frame at which to cut off the integration. The two data sets were merged with a low R int (4%) and are free of the non-isomorphism that can be introduced from flash-cryocooling (Teng & Moffat, 2000) . Although thaumatin crystals are hardy and of high symmetry, we describe the collection of two adjacent crystals as a minimal representation of the realistic situation where crystals may be more sensitive to decay and orientation, and multiple samples might need to be employed to obtain a complete high-quality data set. Thaumatin has been refined up to 1.05 \u00c5 (PDB ID 1rqw), and crystals grown in agarose gel have provided room-temperature data sets from synchrotron radiation yielding 1.2 \u00c5 resolution atomic models , but the crystals used in the present study are about a tenth of the scale of those used by Sauter et al. We suggest that our observed diffraction limits of about 2.0 \u00c5 are due, at least in part, to short, highly attenuated exposures and progressive weakening of the outer shell of reflections from radiationinduced decay. The I/( I ) outer values decrease about twofold between the initial and final frames for each data set, and the outer shell limits themselves drop in resolution (Table 1) . As a control experiment, several flash-cryocooled thaumatin crystals were prepared using hanging-drop vapor diffusion conditions analogous to the microcapillary conditions using glycerol as a cryoprotectant. We found that no crystal (despite being much larger than those in the microcapillaries) exceeded a visible diffraction limit of 1.7 \u00c5 (with similar exposure times).",

Instead, 100 of data were collected at random orientation. Data set 1 was processed to 2.0 \u00c5 , and we discovered that it had only 94% completeness even though 100 of data were collected from a tetragonal crystal (Table 1) . The capillary was then translated along the goniometer z axis and a fresh crystal was recentered in the beam, a process that has become semi-automated at some beamlines (McPhillips et al., 2002) . An additional 100 frames were collected on a second crystal (which was processed to 1.9 \u00c5 ), and the data sets were merged to form a virtually complete data set, with higher redundancy and resolution. The thaumatin model was refined against this data set to achieve R factors about as low as any entry found in the PDB for thaumatin (in the same tetragonal space group and at a comparable resolution). We note that minimally complete data sets (merged and unmerged) also yielded virtually identical R factors, and no striking differences in electron densities (Table 1) are observed. Isomorphic crystals are an important underlying assumption for the microcapillary approach. However, some biological crystals exhibit notorious non-isomorphism (Yonath et al., 1998) and would be impossible to analyze using multiple crystals. The use of multiple isomoprhic crystals does not offer any obvious disadvantage in data quality, but modern protein crystallographers seem to be apprehensive about introducing errors from subtle non-isomorphisms. Virus crystallographers routinely use multiple crystals [see Grimes et al. (1998) for an example of 1000 crystals] in merging complete data sets.",

A specific example for a conserved domain of SARS-CoV protein nsp3 (Saikatendu et al., 2005) is shown in Fig. 7 . We were successful in growing single crystals in most cases, which suggests a surprising equivalence between vapor diffusion and microbatch type screening. The crystals grown in the microcapillary apparatus appear to be identical to those grown using traditional methods, under X-ray diffraction. Current efforts are focused Increasing mosaicities of both crystals as X-ray dose accumulates.",

Plug-based microfluidics using PDMS stamp lithography to load nanovolume crystallization experiments into glass capillaries offers an inexpensive platform to increase volume efficiencies by tenfold over conventional techniques. This method is amenable to automated sparse matrix screening (Zheng & Ismagilov, 2005) and gradient fine screening (Zheng et al., 2003) . Microcapillaries provide convenient handling of multiple crystals for data collection, and this technique can be used to offset the shortened lifetime of exposed crystals without the aid of cryocooling. We have validated this approach by using thaumatin as a model system to the point of providing sub-2.0 \u00c5 structures. The overall approach is well suited towards the automation of macromolecular structure determination.",
