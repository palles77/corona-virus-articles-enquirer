Symptom onset was defined as the first day when the subject reported at least 1 of 5 symptoms and signs: fever (37.8\u00b0C or higher) cough, headache, sore throat, or aches or pains in muscles or joints.",

We adjusted for potential bias from truncation by study design (eAppendix, http://links.lww.com). This was necessary because index cases were not recruited if secondary cases had already appeared. Our resulting estimate for the serial interval is longer than the generation time used in some transmission models. [3] [4] [5] [6] The serial interval is the sum of 2 distinct phases of the natural history of influenza infection, namely, the infectious period (from exposure to infection) and the incubation period (from infection to symptoms). An often-used estimate of the incubation distribution is based on 36 laboratory-confirmed secondary cases from a single infector on an airplane where symptom onset mostly appeared within 1-2 days of infection (median 1.5 days). 19 Even less is known about the duration of infectiousness and its variability over time. Experimental infections suggest that viral shedding peaks around the time of symptom onset and declines with time; viral shedding can persist for up to 1 week after infection20 (perhaps longer in children). Our finding of a mean serial interval of 3.6 days suggests that the average time from symptom onset in the index case to secondary infection in the household setting may be around 2 days, assuming that time from secondary infection to secondary onset is 1.5 days (based on the airplane data19).",

Second, our data correspond only to transmission of interpandemic influenza within the household; the serial interval of transmission in other settings or in a pandemic may be different. Third, we may have misinterpreted some coprimary cases as secondary cases, leading us to underestimate the serial interval. With a small sample size and no obvious bimodality in the distribution of onset times, it is difficult to separate possible coprimary cases from the left-hand tail of the distribution. However, most coprimary cases would be excluded by our study design. Some secondary cases may be wrongly attributed to the household index where infection of the household contact actually occurred outside the home from another infected person. Our main analysis does not explicitly allow for community transmission. However, the external force of infection is thought to be orders of magnitude lower than the force of infection within the household. 21 Incorporating this in sensitivity analyses did not change our estimates of the serial interval (eTable 3, http://links.lww.com).",
