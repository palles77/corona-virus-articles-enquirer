Re reached its highest value in mid-February and fell below unity around mid-March, when vaccination coverage was 7.5%-45.7% and vector-suitable environmental conditions were maintained. The epidemic fade-out likely resulted first from the immunization of animals following natural infection or vaccination. The decline in vector-suitable environmental conditions from April onwards and further vaccination helped maintain R e below unity. Increased availability of vaccine use data would enable evaluation of the effect of RVF vaccination campaigns.",

The main vectors are specific Aedes and Culex spp. mosquitoes, and primary hosts are sheep, goats, and cattle (1, 2) . RVF epidemics usually occur after heavy rainfalls, which inundate ephemeral wetlands and enable large numbers of Aedes spp. mosquito eggs to hatch; it has been hypothesized that these mosquitoes harbor RFV virus (3) (4) (5) . Virus transmission is sustained in locations with more persistent surface water, which provides suitable breeding conditions for other vectors, such as Culex sp. mosquitoes (6) . RVF epidemics among animal herds cause abortion storms, affecting all stages of pregnancy, and high death rates among neonates. Epidemics among humans often cause influenza-like illness, although severe conditions (e.g., hemorrhagic fever and death) have been reported (1, 2) .",

The 2010 wave started in January and February in Free State Province and subsequently spread to almost all provinces in South Africa ( Figure 1 , panel A). Animals from a variety of species were affected (e.g., cattle, sheep and goats, buffaloes, camels, and other wild animals), and 95% (n = 470) of the affected farms raised cattle, small ruminants (sheep/goats), or both (9) . The incidence peaked in March, and the last case of that wave was reported in August 2010. The epidemic resumed in January 2011, affecting 124 farms, mainly in Eastern Cape Province (Figure 1, panel B) (10) . The start of the 2010 epidemic was attributed to heavy rainfall in January and February (11, 12) . The fade-out of the 2010 wave could be attributed to several factors: a depletion of susceptible hosts after natural infection or vaccination (13) ; a change of environmental conditions affecting the sustainability of vector breeding, such as a decrease in temperature (14) ; the drying of wetlands; or a combination of these factors.",

This probability, p ij , is equal to the probability that farm j infects farm i, divided by the probability that farm i had been infected from any other farm (k) in the dataset ( Figure 2 ). These probabilities depend on the number of days separating the onset of symptoms on the 2 farms (i and j) and the distance (in kilometers) separating i and j, and the probabilities were extracted from a probability density function of the generation interval (online Technical Appendix, wwwnc.cdc.gov/ EID/article/19/6/12-1641-Techapp1.pdf). The generation (or serial) interval was defined as the time between onset of symptoms for a primary case and the onset of symptoms for its secondary case (18) . In the stylized example in Figure 2 , the most likely time difference was 4 days (determined on the basis of the serial interval distribution, given below the x axis), and the most likely distance is short (<1 km). Therefore, farm j is the most likely farm to have infected farm i (this maximized the probability in both dimensions). Because no independent dataset (i.e., from another epidemic in another country) was available to estimate a generation interval for RVF at the farm level and in 2 dimensions (i.e., distance and time), we used the dataset for the 2011 RVF outbreak in South Africa. In a previous analysis, M\u00e9tras et al. (19) estimated the spatiotemporal interaction (or proximity) from the 2011 dataset [denoted D 0 (s,t)] by using the space-time K-function (20) . These D 0 (s,t) values were used as a generation interval distribution to calculate p ij (online Technical Appendix).",

By using this generation interval for the duration of the epidemic, a constant and high importance of short-distance transmission mechanisms was assumed. However, as the epidemic grew, these short-distance transmission mechanisms were likely to be less important; or in, other words, as farms around a case became infected and immune, short-distance transmission was likely to be less involved in disease spread. Thus, we investigated the variations of R e by giving less weight to short-distance transmission and more weight to long-distance transmission. To obtain such serial interval distributions, the D 0 (s,t) distribution was flattened by using a 2-dimensional double exponential kernel function with bandwidth values equal to 1, 3, and 5, resulting in 3 smoothed surfaces ( Figure 3 ). It was assumed that the bandwidth equal to 1 would better correspond to the serial interval distribution at the early stage of the epidemic and that bandwidth values 3 and 5 would better describe the intensity of the transmission when the population started to be immune (i.e., at the later stages of the epidemic).",

In addition, the lower bound of the 95% CI dropped and remained below 1.0 from mid-February onwards. In January and February, the most highly infectious farms (R e >2) were located in Free State Province ( Figure 5 , panels A-C), and although the data suggest the epidemic was still contained in Free State Province in February, a rapid fall in the R e value was observed ( Figure 4 ). In March, the epidemic had spread to other provinces, mainly Northern Cape, and transmission was ongoing. In April, the spatial extent of the virus was similar to that in March, but most of the affected farms were not sources of ongoing transmission (R e <1). By May, only 7 spatially isolated farms had R e above unity. Figure 6 shows the variability of R e for the different serial interval distributions used in our analyses. In the early stages of the epidemic, R e was smaller when using input distributions that gave more weight to short-distance transmission [D 0 (s,t) and bandwidth 1] because it used only those cases closer in time and space, whereas when R e was estimated with flatter distributions (bandwidths 3 and 5), it also encompassed longer-distance transmission. However, for all distributions, the important variations of R e followed the same trend over time: a marked peak in January and February and stable transmission between late February and early March.",

The virus originated from infected Aedes mosquito eggs (5, 26) or possibly from other sources (e.g., long-distance vectors or movement of infected animals). Despite the decline in rainfall during January-March (from 152 mm to 73 mm/month) in Free State Province, transmission of RVF virus continued, although at a lower intensity. The continued transmission suggested that the lower amount of rainfall was sufficient to keep water bodies with good retention capacity filled and, thus, enable secondary vectors (e.g., Cx. theileri and Anopheles cinereus) (25) to sustain virus transmission in Free State and Northern Cape Provinces. From April onwards, the drop in rainfall may have contributed to a decreased abundance of Culex spp. mosquitoes; lower temperatures may have also slowed virus replication and shedding in Culex spp. vectors, as has been observed for Cx. pipiens (27, 28) , and thereby reduced virus transmission.",

However, a depletion of susceptible animals after natural infection or vaccination probably caused the R e to fall below unity 2 weeks earlier (mid-March) and the lower bound of its 95% CI to fall in mid-February. In addition, the minimum HIT was estimated at 50.0%, but at the end of March, the estimated maximum vaccination coverage in Free State was 45.7% (Scenario C). By the end of May, vaccination coverage was higher, rainfall was very low, and temperatures continued to decrease, all of which probably contributed to preventing further virus transmission. Several limitations with regard to the methods and data used might have altered the results of this study and their interpretation. First, the validity of the Wallinga and Teunis method assumes that all cases are reported and reported in a timely manner. The RVF cases used were those reported to the World Organisation for Animal Health. RVF is a notifiable disease that causes obvious signs in affected herds, so it is unlikely that underreporting was a major limitation. However, underreporting cannot be excluded, and we acknowledge that an assessment of its extent would increase the quality of the data. Another assumption of the Wallinga and Teunis estimation method is that the generation interval remains constant over the course of the epidemic. The sensitivity analysis showed that the shape of the generation interval chosen was important only in the early stages of the outbreak, when a high number of initial cases in the epidemic would equally involve short-and long-distance transmission mechanisms. Another limitation is that in the absence of identified distinct cases resulting from initial virus emergence or introduction, we considered that all cases for the entire epidemic as resulting from transmission from a single index case. In that setting, the initial values of R e could have been overestimated. If multiple index cases could be identified, the model could be improved by studying transmission within clusters. The algorithm could also be extended to include other information, such as contact between farms caused by movement of animals or environmental data at a higher resolution.",

Although the use of an external dataset would have been more appropriate, the fact that the 2010 and 2011 waves occurred 1 year apart and had a different spatial extent ( Figure 1 ) suggested that both datasets were reasonably independent. However, as a consequence of the 2010 wave, it is possible that (19, 20) and are a measure of the spatiotemporal proximity between cases. The horizontal dashed line represents the threshold value R e = 1. vaccination was implemented in the 2011 affected area before the second wave actually started. If applied, vaccination would not modify the shape of the space-time interaction in 2010 and 2011, but it might explain the difference in the intensity of the interactions (19) . In all cases, the values measuring the intensity of the spacetime interaction [D 0 (s,t)] in 2010 would lie between the 2011 values smoothed with a bandwidth between 1 and 3, and because the sensitivity analysis suggested that the key variations of R e over time were not affected by these various surfaces, results remain robust. Another limitation is that vaccine, rainfall, and temperature data used to discuss the plausibility of different reasons for fade-out of the 2010 epidemic were centered on Free State Province. This is where the epidemic started, where vaccination by the government was first applied (13) , and where 53.9% of the cases were reported by the end of May. Rainfall and temperature data were recorded for Free State Province, which is centrally situated with respect to the outbreak. There is great spatial variation in temperature and rainfall across Free State Province and the country. However, rainfall countrywide was higher than usual that year (11, 12) ; observations from the field confirmed a decreased winter temperature in Free State Province, starting in April-May (14) ; and trends in environmental variables in Northern Cape Province were similar to those in Free State ( Figure 5) .",

It is likely that a large proportion of the 3.4 million vaccine doses sold during April 2009-March 2010 were used in Free State Province at the early stages of the 2010 epidemic (13) . However, some of those doses would have been used by farmers earlier in 2009 in KwaZulu-Natal and Northern Cape Provinces, where RVF cases were reported and vaccination was applied (29, 30) , and in early 2010 because of the perceived risk of further outbreaks. However, detailed figures on this were not available. Therefore, the most likely scenario might have been between Scenarios B and C, corresponding to vaccination coverage of 28.2%-45.7% in Free State Province.",

Disentangling and quantifying the relative importance of these factors would have benefited from detailed data on monthly vaccine sales and geographic use information. Increasing the public availability of vaccine use data would enable further evaluation of the effect of RVF vaccination campaigns.

(Onderstepoort, South Africa), the sole provider of RVF vaccine in South Africa, calculates its yearly sales from April of one year to March of the next year (21). During April 1, 2009-March 31, 2010, \u22483.4 million RVF vaccine doses (live attenuated Smithburn and inactivated) were sold, and during April 1-May 31, 2010, \u22485.8 million doses were sold (Table 1) (22). In our study, Period 1 corresponded with the time before the 2010 epidemic (April 1, 2009-January 18, 2010); Period 2 corresponded with the start of the 2010 epidemic and the end of the 2009 vaccine sales year (January 19, 2010-March 31, 2010); and Period 3 corresponded with April 1, 2010-May 31, 2010, beyond which no vaccine sales data were available (Table 1).
