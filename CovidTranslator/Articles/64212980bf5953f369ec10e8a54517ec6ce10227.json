            "text": "Examples of such changes are the fluctuations in the levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1), interleukins, S100 proteins, metalloproteinases, angiogenins, etc [4] [5] [6] [7] . Since a different task is carried out by each of these biomarkers, it has been proposed that IBD induces multifarious responses which in turn, may affect the levels of different compounds via feedback mechanisms, consumption or reprioritisation of synthesis [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . These observations along with the inflammatory nature of IBD itself seem to encourage the study of novel proteins that tend to become affected by the establishment of systemic inflammation [3, 8] . Such a candidate is fetuin A or \u03b12-Heremans-Schmid glycoprotein (AHSG), a substance synthesized in the liver, bone marrow and fetal organs, exhibiting properties similar to those possessed by negative acute-phase proteins [9] . AHSG has been shown to carry out various immunologic tasks, including regulation of macrophage-related lipopolysaccharide-triggered opsonisation, TNF-\u03b1 and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-\u03b2) levels [10] [11] [12] [13] . AHSG is also an inhibitor of ectopic tissue calcification such as that taking place in coronary arteries and heart valves, while at the same time promoting mineralization within fibrils and subsequently, proper bone formation [13] [14] [15] . Other recently discovered properties of AHSG include a binding ability to insulin receptor, modifying its sensitivity, participation in wound healing as well as tumor growth processes, through the induction of a more effective cell migration [8, 9] . Increased AHSG levels have been recorded in fetal organs (probably reflecting an additional role for AHSG in normal organ development), in adults with either metabolic syndrome or increased insulin resistance alone, patients infected with the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus as well as individuals at high risk for future cardiovascular events: stroke and acute myocardial infarction [8, 9, 16] . Low levels of AHSG have been recorded in patients on hemodialysis, those with cirrhosis, hepatoma or rheumatoid arthritis (RA), an entity sharing common inflammatory pathways with IBD, and have been linked to vascular -excessive valvular and coronary artery calcification, ischemic events-and skeletal disorders -osteopenia [14, 17, 18] . Moreover, similar phenomena: upregulation of TNF-\u03b1 and TGF-\u03b2, remodelling in intestinal microvessels, both on an acute and chronic basis, as well as manifestations linked to mineral homeostasis i.e., osteoporosis and urolithiasis, are all exerted in IBD. When bearing in mind these characteristics, the idea of examining AHSG levels in IBD, seems more than tempting [4, [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] .",

After additional washing, incubation with a substrate solution took place, the reaction was stopped and the developed colour was quantified spectrophotometrically. The enzymatic activity of the detecting antibodies, bound to the AHSG on the wall of the microwells, was directly proportional to the amount of AHSG in the sample.

For variables without comparable variations, Welch's correction has been applied. AHSG was tested for its ability to predict IBD, UC and CD, separately, using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, while area under the curve (AUC) and cut-off values, with the optimal sensitivity and specificity, were also calculated. For the simple correlation studies, Pearson's rank test was used. Statistical significance was set at P < 0.05. Whenever statistical significance or trend (0.05 < P < 0.1) was recorded in univariate analysis, multivariate testing was also performed. Using multiple linear regression and a backward selection process independent variables affecting AHSG levels -confounders -were identified. As candidate confounding factors were initially considered age, sex, smoking, DM, treatment modalities, disease duration and behaviour, age at onset. For the associations originating from multiple linear regression, partial correlation coefficients -quantifying the relationship between two variables while controlling for other factors-are reported. Whenever a categorical parameter was treated as dependent variable, logistic regression analyses, simple and multiple, were applied and odds ratios (ORs) as well as 95%CIs, unadjusted/adjusted for confounding, were calculated.

The recorded difference between the IBD and control groups was statistically significant (P < 0.0001) and this was also the case when CD and UC were compared separately with IBS patients and HC. AHSG levels in the CD group were 0.31 \u00b1 0.01 g/L, significantly lower than those of IBS patients and HC (P < 0.0001). Likewise, UC patients also exhibited lower AHSG levels (0.34 \u00b1 0.01 g/L) compared to IBS patients and HC (P < 0.001).

During comparison, IBD patients requiring surgical intervention or the use of anti-TNF\u03b1 therapy exhibited lower AHSG concentrations (0.26 \u00b1 0.07 g/L and 0.3 \u00b1 0.05 g/L), compared to those adequately treated with 5-ASA (0.33 \u00b1 0.05 g/L) or corticosteroids (0.35 \u00b1 0.1 g/L) (P < 0.05, in both cases). Further evaluation of the recorded associations, using simple linear regression analysis, showed that AHSG levels were inversely associated with the need for anti-TNF\u03b1 treatment (r = -0.31, P < 0.05) and surgery (r = -0.36, P < 0.05). After multivariate analysis -also considering age, sex, activity, duration, smoking status-the inverse association between AHSG and need for anti-TNF\u03b1 therapy or surgery remained statistically significant (partial correlation coefficients: -0.33 and -0.41, respectively -P < 0.05, in both cases). Since these results are suggestive of a link between a more profound downregulation of AHSG levels and the need for anti-TNF\u03b1 treatment or surgical intervention, AHSG concentrations were classified into quartiles. Using logistic regression, AHSG levels in the lowest quartile were found to be an independent predictor of the need for anti-TNF\u03b1 treatment, in a model adjusted for other treatment modalities, age, sex, smoking status and disease duration (OR = 5.22, 95%CI: 1.58-17.3, P < 0.01). Similarly, by applying the same adjusted model, it was shown that need for surgery could be independently predicted by the presence of AHSG levels within the lowest quartile (OR = 5.51, 95%CI: 1.11-27.3, P < 0.01).",

Furthermore, a more profound downregulation of AHSG was very well associated with complicated disease behavior and the need for biological anti-TNF\u03b1 treatment or surgery. Additional associations with CRP and anti-glycan antibodies offered better insight into AHSG's link with acute-phase response and 443 January 21, 2017|Volume 23|Issue 3| WJG|www.wjgnet.com IBD course. The finding of an IBD-induced downregulation of AHSG is nothing but surprising since, AHSG levels decrease in the presence of robust inflammation [9, 11, 18] . Moreover, an interplay had already been documented between AHSG and the \"notorious\", in IBD, TNF-\u03b1 and TGF-\u03b2 [11] [12] [13] . An additional finding further confirming the tight link of AHSG with TNF\u03b1, was the discovery of a binding site for TNF\u03b1, within the AHSG gene. As a consequence of TNF\u03b1's binding on this region, the expression of AHSG gene is suppressed, leading to decreased AHSG production while other substances are favored-repriorisation of liver synthesis [8, [11] [12] [13] . Due to the magnitude and rather IBD-selective character of this suppression, however, an evaluation of AHSG's ability to differentiate between entities has been performed. When a cut-off of 0.44 g/L was used, AHSG levels were shown to discriminate IBD from IBS and HC with a sensitivity and specificity of 90%.",

According to the study by Ma et al [30] significant differences in AHSG levels exist between IBD patients with active or inactive disease. On the other hand, a correlation between AHSG and CRP was confirmed, in our study. This may be, at least in part, due to limitations of the indices themselves although one should bear in mind that apart from the negative acute phase protein properties attributed to AHSG, its downregulation is also a part of a more complex liver deregulation, resulting from an excessive uptake and processing of signals [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] . Perhaps, possible associations of AHSG with other indices should also be evaluated [31] [32] . At this point, however, an asset of the present study has to be underlined: the AHSG levels recorded in IBD patients correspond to a prior-to-therapy status and therefore, could not have been altered by any of the known drugs used to treat IBD.",

Moreover, in many organs inflammatory stress leads to fibrosis and subsequently tissue calcification [34] .

Likewise, microvascular calcification, reduced blood flow and microthrombosis, exerted phenomena in the presence of low AHSG levels are also major findings during a chronic phase in the intestinal vasculature of IBD patients, leading to diminished intestinal perfusion and in turn to ulceration and fibrosis [21, 35] .",

A robust downregulation of AHSG levels correlated with the need for anti-TNF\u03b1 therapy. This finding is within reason since, a more profound and persisting upregulation of TNF\u03b1, requiring subsequently the use of an anti-TNF\u03b1 agent, would result in a greater AHSG decrease. As far as the link between AHSG levels and need for surgery, is concerned, one should also bear in mind that this subgroup predominantly consisted of CD patients with stricturing and penetrating disease. In the case of a refractory UC, requiring colectomy, safe conclusions could not be drawn due to the small number of colectomised patients, in our study.",

As already mentioned, AHSG is an inhibitor of unwanted, ectopic, tissue calcification and its decreased levels, as in this case, have been linked with excessive valvular and arterial calcification [4] . Although, initial reports originated from animal studies and those recruiting dialysis patients, similar results were obtained in patients with ischemic heart disease, alone [37] . Since a decrease in circulating AHSG is present in IBD, it would be logical to hypothesize that an accompanying reduced inhibition of vascular and valvular calcification would also be present. As this study was not designed to \"tackle\" these matters, the actual contribution of low AHSG levels in vascular changes and related acute or chronic ischemic events in IBD [38] , remains to be clarified.",

            "text": "Apart from the implication of AHSG in vascular pathology, another role, that of bone mineralisation has been identified [13] [14] [15] . Under the influence of AHSG, a \"reliable\", stress-resistant bone structure is formed, while in the absence of AHSG, minerals deposit outside fibrils, leading to defective osseous formation and finally osteoporosis [15] . As IBD patients are at high risk for osteoporosis, resulting from corticosteroids, malnutrition and inflammation-induced osteopenia [22] the examination of possible contribution of AHSG suppression for the onset of osteopenic manifestations might prove fruitful. In a rather similar manner, a defective coordination in mineral use, predominantly that of calcium, due to decreased AHSG levels, may lead to urolithiasis. Indeed, in the study of Stejskal et al [39] lower levels of AHSG in urine have been associated with the presence of urolithiasis. Although, in the case of IBD, wellestablished mechanisms-i.e., hyperoxaluria, reduced citric acid etc [18] -for urinary compications exist, when bearing in mind that still 80% of urinary stones consist of calcium salts it is within reason to test for additional candidates involved in calcium homeostasis and urinary manifestations, such as AHSG [40] . Conclusively, AHSG seems to emerge as a molecule of potential diagnostic and perhaps predictive value in IBD, as its downregulation shows a tight link with acute-phase. As well as with chronic inflammatory responses in both CD and UC. This link also encompasses the more challenging cases, those with complicated disease behavior, as well as those requiring advanced treatment strategies such as biological agents or surgery. As far as the pathogenetic role of AHSG in IBD is concerned, further studies designed to assess the impact and the association of low AHSG levels with respect to micro-and macro-vascular changes, skeletal and urinary complications recorded in patients with CD and UC, are needed.",
