            "text": "In the follow-up period, specific items will be collected (see online supplementary appendix 1). 155 During the remedial period, participants will be required to register a daily record of symptoms. The To ensure the safety of patients, blinding of the study design, data quality and adherence to the 186 study protocol, personnel who participate directly in this study will be adequately trained and 187 follow guidelines for good clinical practice (GCP). Table 2 . 197 If the participants meet rejection criteria, they will be removed, and the data will not be included 198 in the final statistical analysis. However, termination standards relate to enrolled patients that may 199 be terminated during the remedial period and data from these patients will be included in the final 200 statistical analysis. The rejection criteria and termination standards are detailed in Table 3 . Table 4 and 207 are based on the detailed symptoms shown in Table 1 . Patients will be divided into two types 208 according to two TCM practitioners 23 . sufficient time (in their own opinion) to fully consider trial entry and to ask questions of 215 investigators. The written informed consent from will be signed by the patient who is willing to 216 participate this clinical trial. Research doctors will obtain written consent from patients willing to 217 participate in the trial. Additional biological samples will be obtained to be stored for use in future 218 studies. A materials consent will be obtained to specifically address the collection such as serum 219 and plasma specimens. 231 Patients in this group will be administered four bags of CLD granules (3g/per bag) half an hour 232 after a meal, three times daily, for 5 days, taken with an analogous oseltamivir capsule, twice daily, 233 for 5 days. test, all drugs, within the trial period, will be packed by Pan-long-yun-hai Pharmaceutical Company. 246 The drugs will be counted and sorted by a third party (Chinese Evidenced-based Medicine Center, 247 West China Hospital, Sichuan University, China.) . All drugs were within the expiration dates. 248 Other treatments may be taken if the participants have the following symptoms: axillary 249 temperature \u226538.5\u2103 that lasts for 4 h and does not reduce with physical cooling; body 250 temperature >39\u2103; or headache or myalgia scores of \u22653 points. 251 Symptomatic treatment measures are as follows. A. Fever: acetaminophen; B. severe cough 252 with white phlegm: Bisolvon; C. mild asthmatic symptoms: long-acting theophylline. No other 253 drugs may be used. Detailed information on drug use will be registered in the CRF. 254 The investigator will instruct the participants to record the actual dose in their patient's diary. 255 Based on this diary, the investigator will evaluate the subject's adherence to the interventions to the 256 following four levels, and record the results on the case report form at each follow-up: 1) Take 257 prescribed medications; 2) Basically prescribed medication (80% to 120% of the dose of the Data entry and management is the responsibility of the assigned data manager who will 270 establish the database and the verification procedure. Then, two specialised trained keyboard 271 operators will input and confirm the data. After checking the CRF, identified entry errors will be 272 corrected until the input data is exactly as the same as the CRF. Any queries on the CRF will be 273 communicated to the researchers through the data query form. These data query forms must be processed, signed and dated timely by the researcher. Resolved data questions must be returned to 275 the data manager, who revises and verifies the data according to the feedback, and correspondingly 276 updates the database, then the necessary data question form can be queried again. The database will be locked after confirming the accuracy of the established database by blind 279 review. Locked data cannot be changed. If any data revision is needed after locking, an official 280 statement jointly signed by the sponsor, main researcher, experimental project managers, 281 statisticians and data manager must be provided. Additionally, revisions will be performed in the 282 statistical analysis. After data have been reviewed, all cases will be assessed to confirm the intent-to-treat 285 population (ITTP), modified intent-to-treatment population (MITTP), per-protocol population (PPP) 286 and the safety analysis population (SAP). The decision will be approved by the data manager, study 287 promoter, and researchers, and will end with unblinding after locking the database. Primary outcome 295 The primary outcome is the time to alleviate influenza-like symptoms: fever; stuffy nose; 296 running nose; sore throat; cough; myalgia; fatigue; headaches; chills and sweating, which will be 297 measured in hours. Alleviation means that the influenza-like symptoms score is \u22641 (mild) and the 298 state is stable for more than 24h 26 . 299 300 Secondary outcomes 301 The secondary endpoints consist of seven aspects: ii. The area under the curve (AUC) analysis of nine influenza-like symptom scores, provide 306 indications of disease severity. The AUC is calculated as the product of the daily symptom scores 307 multiplied by the duration of the illness. 308 iii. The treatment efficacy for different TCM syndromes is assessed by the TCM syndrome scores. The indices of vital signs, cardiopulmonary signs, electrocardiography and clinical laboratory 322 tests (biochemistry, haematology and urine examination) will be compared before and after the 323 treatment to assess for safety. Additionally, research interviewers will keep in touch with each 324 participant to monitor safety. 325 Any adverse events in the vital signs, symptoms and disease or laboratory parameters of the 326 patients that occur after entering clinical trials will be recorded. The occurrence of adverse events is 327 not necessarily related to the study drugs. Adverse events are divided into three levels: mild; Committee. Any cause-and-effect relationship between adverse events and the study drugs will be 333 determined by the classifications shown in Table 5 . If the patient has a serious adverse event, it is necessary to know the specific situation of the 335 medication\uff0cunblinding is permissible only after obtaining the consent of the main investigator. 336 Once the emergency letter is read, the case is treated as shedding. Organization for influenza-like illnesses (ILIs) were used as the basis for influenza surveillance. If a 343 patient presents with an acute cough and fever, clinicians must be highly vigilant to test for 344 infections caused by the influenza virus. In general, the rate of ILI cases that lead to a clinical 345 diagnosis of influenza infection is approximately 18 to 80%, which is higher than other clinical 346 diagnoses, for example, acute infections of the upper respiratory tract 20,27 . We selected adult ILI 347 patients for inclusion into the study. 348 Furthermore, this trial is a confirmatory study on the treatment of influenza by CLD Granules. 349 The patients will be randomly assigned in three groups: positive group, test group and placebo 350 group. In this trial, the number of sample cases was estimated based on the test hypothesis that the 351 test group was superior to the placebo group and the test group was not inferior to the positive 352 control group. 353 The main index of treatment effectiveness is the period of time until subsidence of symptoms 354 (hours). It has been reported that the average period of time for remission of these symptoms in the 355 placebo group was about 5 days (120 hours) 26 . This trial requires that the average time for 356 symptomatic remission of the test group should be at least 12 hours shorter than the placebo group, 357 it means the Permissible Error (\u03b4) of the superiority trial is 12 hours. In order to be considered 358 clinically significant, the mean time for symptomatic remission in the positive group must less than 359 12 hours compared with the placebo group, which means the Permissible Error (\u03b4) of the superiority 360 trial is within 12 hours. The calculation data is as follows: through local advertising. And each participant will receive financial compensation after they 371 finishing the entire treatment. For patients who drop out, payments will be pro-rated for the length 372 of time they stayed in the study, but payment will not be made until the study would have been 373 completed.",

In addition, the 95% confidence interval of adverse events using the Fisher's exact test 448 will be calculated and the Fisher's exact test will be used to compare the prevalence of adverse 449 events between the CLD granules, oseltamivir and placebo 21 . The trial will be publicised at regional and national conferences. The final results will be 487 presented at scientific meetings and published in a peer-reviewed journal (authorship will be 488 according to the journal's guidelines). In addition, a lay summary of the study results will be 489 circulated to potentially interested parties. Since there is lack of clinical trials of traditional Chinese herbal medicines (TCHM), not only 502 the effectiveness, but also the safety of TCHM will be investigated in this study 22 . To evaluate the 503 safety, changes in liver and kidney function after treatment will be monitored.",

Subjects will be randomised 29 to receive CLD granules, oseltamivir, or a placebo for 5 days of treatment and with follow-up after Western medical methods to evaluate the efficacy of Chinese herbal medicines, which is not suit, 126 because of a lack of a mature-traditional Chinese medicine evaluation system. To develop CLD into a 127 targeted drug with less side effects that can be widely used in the prevention and treatment of influenza, 128 an in-depth study needs to be conducted. In this study, a multi-centre, randomised, double-blind, double-simulation approach will be used. 130 It is hoped that the clinical efficacy of CLD for the treatment of influenza will be fully verified at the 131 highest level of clinical trials.",

Yet, few evidence-based clinical trials have been conducted. We seek to gain an in-depth 136 understanding of the efficacy and safety of CLD use in influenza infections in an evidence-based 137 medicine clinical study. 138 In addition, we will investigate whether CLD granules have different therapeutic effects on 139 different TCM syndrome differentiation by comparing the symptoms before and after treatment. In the follow-up period, specific items will be collected (see online supplementary appendix 1). 154 During the remedial period, participants will be required to register a daily record of symptoms. will be referred to the inclusion and exclusion criteria (shown below). Patients will be enrolled if they 164 meet all inclusion criteria and will not be enrolled if they have any one of the exclusion criteria. 165 Patients will be removed from the trial if they meet one of the rejection criteria or termination 166 standards. The enrolled participants will be required to provide written informed consent, to cooperate 167 with the doctor's treatment, to cooperate with the follow-up and provide information that is not beyond 168 the remit of the ethical approval. Patients that do not comply will be removed from the study. In this 169 period, pharyngeal/throat swabs and blood samples will be collected from participants. The participants 170 will also be distinguished according to TCM syndrome differentiation criteria (described below). 171 The study is designed to enrol 318 patients in six units. and (iv) Have signed a written informed consent from. Exclusion criteria are detailed in Table 2 . 193 If the participants meet rejection criteria, they will be removed, and the data will not be included in 194 the final statistical analysis. However, termination standards relate to enrolled patients that may be 195 terminated during the remedial period and data from these patients will be included in the final 196 statistical analysis. The rejection criteria and termination standards are detailed in Table 3 . Table 4 and are 203 based on the detailed symptoms shown in Table 1 . Patients will be divided into two types according to A doctor will confirm if the patient satisfy the participate criteria after consent being given. 208 Subsequently, it will be discussed with the patient by a medical officer of the trial team. Patients will be 209 given sufficient time (in their own opinion) to fully consider trial entry and to ask questions of 210 investigators. The written informed consent form will be signed by the patient who is willing to 211 participate this clinical trial. If the patient is under the age of 18, his/her parents will be also informed 212 of the details of the trial. Only after both of the child and his/her parent sign the informed consent, the 213 child may participate the trial. 214 A materials consent will be obtained to specifically address the collection of biological samples 215 for future use such as serum and plasma specimens.

The cost will be provided by the research team. 280 The investigator will instruct the participants to record the actual dose in their patient's diary. 281 Based on this diary, the investigator will evaluate the subject's adherence to the interventions to the 282 following four levels, and record the results on the case report form at each follow-up: 1) Take 283 prescribed medications; 2) Basically prescribed medication (80% to 120% of the dose of the program); Data entry and management is the responsibility of the assigned data manager who will establish 294 the database and the verification procedure. Then, two specialised trained keyboard operators will input 295 and confirm the data. After checking the CRF, identified entry errors will be corrected until the input 296 data is exactly as the same as the CRF. Any queries on the CRF will be communicated to the 297 researchers through the data query form. These data query forms must be processed, signed and dated 298 timely by the researcher. Resolved data questions must be returned to the data manager, who revises 299 and verifies the data according to the feedback, and correspondingly updates the database, then the 300 necessary data question form can be queried again. The database will be locked after confirming the accuracy of the established database by blind 303 review. Locked data cannot be changed. If any data revision is needed after locking, an official 304 statement jointly signed by the sponsor, main researcher, experimental project managers, statisticians 305 and data manager must be provided. Additionally, revisions will be performed in the statistical 306 analysis. Primary outcome 318 The primary outcome is the time to alleviate influenza-like symptoms: fever; stuffy nose; running 319 nose; sore throat; cough; myalgia; fatigue; headaches; chills and sweating, which will be measured in 320 hours. Alleviation means that the influenza-like symptoms score is \u22641 (mild) and the state is stable 321 for more than 24h 32 . 322 323 Secondary outcomes 324 The secondary endpoints consist of seven aspects: superior to the placebo group and the test group was not inferior to the positive control group. 374 The main index of treatment effectiveness is the period of time until subsidence of symptoms 375 (hours). It has been reported that the average period of time for remission of these symptoms in the 376 placebo group was about 5 days (120 hours) 32 . This trial requires that the average time for 377 symptomatic remission of the test group should be at least 12 hours shorter than the placebo group, it 378 means the Permissible Error (\uf064) of the superiority trial is 12 hours. In order to be considered clinically 379 significant, the mean time for symptomatic remission in the positive group must less than 12 hours 380 compared with the placebo group, which means the Permissible Error (\uf064) of the superiority trial is 381 within 12 hours. (Table 6) 382 Based on the above data, the SAS Software was used to estimate the sample size required for 383 \"One-way ANOVA\". The calculation result is designed for 3 parallel groups. (Table 7) 384 For achieving adequate participant enrolment, atients are recruited for clinical trials mainly through 385 local advertising. And each participant will receive financial compensation after they finishing the 386 entire treatment. For patients who drop out, payments will be pro-rated for the length of time they 387 stayed in the study, but payment will not be made until the study would have been completed. iii. Per-protocol population (PPP) 400 The PPP is all cases includes those cases that meet the inclusion criteria, are in full accordance 401 with the test program (or violate the protocol only slightly), complete the trial and complete the CRF. 402 The PP is used to analyse the main indicators for evaluating efficacy and to examine the consistency of 403 the results from the MITT. 404 iv. Safety analysis population (SAP) 405 After randomisation, the study drug is taken at least once and after intervention, effective safety 406 evaluation data has been recorded at least once. 407 In this experiment, the baseline data and efficacy analysis will be analysed by the MITTP. 408 Simultaneously, the primary efficacy endpoint will have PPP analysis, but the conclusions will be ii. All the statistical inferences will use two-sided tests. Statistically significant means P<0.05. The 417 confidence interval of the parameters will be estimated using a 95% confidence interval. 418 iii. Efficacy analyses of the LOCF will be used to compensate for the cases in which not all information 419 from the patients is recorded during treatment; the last observation data will transfer to the final test 420 results. The safety analysis will not estimate any missing data. minimum, maximum, P25, median and P75 will be provided; paired measurement data will also be 425 used to demonstrate the difference between the mean and standard deviation; and with non-parametric 426 methods, the median and mean rank will be provided. Count data are the frequency distribution and the 427 corresponding percentage. Level data will be given as the frequency distribution and the corresponding 428 percentage, as well as the median and mean rank. Qualitative information will show the positive rate, 429 the number of positive cases and the denominator. 430 vi. Baseline data analyses (two sets) will involve demographic indicators, the general situation and 431 primary and secondary indicators before the intervention. Measurement data will be analysed using the 432 t test or t\u00b2 test (when the variance is not homogeneous); count data will be analysed using the Pearson's 433 \u03c7 2 test. Rating data will be analysed using the two sample Wilcoxon rank sum test. x. For the safety analysis, the Pearson's \u03c7 2 test will be used for comparing the prevalence of adverse 445 events (two sets) and the adverse events occurring in the trial will be listed and described. A description of the laboratory test results of normal/abnormal changes before and after the experiment, as well as the 447 relationship between abnormal changes and the test drugs will be recorded. These changes will also be 448 listed and described. The physician will decide whether to suspend observation of the patients. A follow-up survey will 456 carried out in the cases where the patient is withdrawn because of adverse events and the results will be 457 recorded in detail. At an appropriate time, the incidence of adverse events and treatments will be 458 reviewed and comprehensively analysed to determine whether the adverse events were related to the 459 study drug. 460 Adverse events leading to discontinuation of treatment or serious adverse events will be 461 summarised. In addition, the 95% confidence interval of adverse events using the Fisher's exact test 462 will be calculated and the Fisher's exact test will be used to compare the prevalence of adverse events 463 between the CLD granules, oseltamivir and placebo 28 . All study-related information will be stored securely at the study site. All participant information 489 will be stored in locked file cabinets in areas with limited access. All laboratory specimens, reports, 490 data collection, process, and administrative forms will be identified by a coded ID(identification) 491 number only to maintain participant confidentiality. All records that contain names or other personal 492 identifiers, such as locator forms and informed consent forms, will be stored separately from study 493 records identified by code number. All local databases will be secured with password-protected access 494 systems. Forms, lists, logbooks, appointment books, and any other listings that link participant ID The trial will be publicised at regional and national conferences. The final results will be presented 501 at scientific meetings and published in a peer-reviewed journal (authorship will be according to the 502 journal's guidelines). In addition, a lay summary of the study results will be circulated to potentially 503 interested parties. There had been no direct patient involvement in the design of this protocol. Since there is lack of clinical trials of traditional Chinese herbal medicines (TCHM), not only the 530 effectiveness, but also the safety of TCHM will be investigated in this study 29 . To evaluate the safety, 531 changes in liver and kidney function after treatment will be monitored. 532 In this study, we will divide the patients into cold and heat TCM syndromes to study whether Competing interests 566 The authors declare that they have no competing interests.

NA inhibitors also have potential side effects on the nervous system 9 .85Compared with Western medicine, Chinese herbal medicines, widely used in Chinese clinics, can 86 regulate multiple targets for treatment and can improve the immune function, which is an advantage 87 in relieving upper respiratory tract symptoms10 . Considering the pandemic H1N1 virus and other 88 viruses that may occur in the future, investigating the potential use of Chinese herbal medicines for 89 the prevention and treatment of influenza is of great research value.90In traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), influenza is said to resemble \"Feng Wen\" Wind-heat), a type of \"Wen-bing\" meaning feverish diseases. Practitioners of Chinese medicine 92 believed that the occurrence of \"Feng Wen\" (Wind-heat) was associated with a seasonal climate, 93 which closely resembles influenza 11 . Respiratory ailments and diseases were so prevalent in ancient94    China that Wen Bing developed into a highly specialised branch of TCM, which can be traced back95 500 years. Abnormal climate change facilitates epidemics of respiratory diseases. Meanwhile, the 96 human body has failed to adapt, leading to brain centre adjust disorder and decreased disease 97 resistance, and thus increased susceptibility to viral invasion, causing the prevalence of respiratory 98 diseases. According to the traditional Wen Bing precepts, the progression of influenza-like diseases 99 can be divided into four stages: (1) fever development; (2) nasal symptoms; (3) fever and chills; and 100 (4) haemoptysis 12 . In modern medicine, the first two of these stages may be viewed as symptoms 101 that usually subside without treatment. The later stages represent unusual conditions, when 102 bronchitis and late-onset pneumonia occur 13 . 103 Excessive fever is regarded as a kind of toxin, and TCM and China herbal medicines for 104 clearing away heat and toxic materials are recommended to be used, such as Ban-Lan-Gen, 105 Jin-Yin-Hua and Yu-Xing-Cao 14 . One herbal medicine for clearing away heat and toxic materials, 106 Chou-Ling-Dan (CLD; Laggera pterodonta) of the family Laggera Sch-Bip ex Hochst, widely 107 cultivated in Yunnan province in China, has been approved and listed in \"Yunnan Chinese herbal 108 medicine 15 \", \"Kunming common folk herbal medicine 16 \" and \"Yunnan Material Medical 17 \" for",

The sesquiterpenoids 114 of Laggera pterodonta also prevented an increase in cytokine and chemokine expression 19,20,21 . 115 Laggera pterodonta may be used to develop an innovative antiviral drug, and further studies should 116 be performed to investigate the mechanism of action in detail. 117 Currently, there are a variety of commercially available CLD preparations, and a Chinese 118 patent medicine containing CLD as the main ingredient, in China. A observational clinical study, 119 conducted by the Second Affiliated Hospital of Kunming Medical University during the outbreak of 120 H1N1 influenza virus in 2009, found that comparing with the clinical curative effect of Yinqiao 121 Jiedu tablets, a Chinese patent medicine containing CLD had a better anti-viral effect, effectively 122 reduced the number of viruses in respiratory secretions and accelerated the virus clearance. 123 Additionally, good efficacy and safety and the quick relief of fever, sore throat and other symptoms, 124 without adverse reactions, has been shown in the treatment of children with influenza A (H1N1) 22 . 125 However, it is lacking the evidence-based medicine (EBM) clinical study to evaluate the efficacy 126 and safety of CLD Granules in the treatment of seasonal influenza.

And many of clinical trials of Chou-ling-dan on children and oseltamivir treatment for influenza in children had been reported38,39 .We consider to set the range of age as 14-65 which is based on following aspects: Older people have a variety of accompanying diseases that increase the difficulty and risk of testing. Besides, issue of patient compliance should be considered since the subjects of this study 601 are outpatients. Their age should not be too young or too old, otherwise it would be hard to follow up and drop out easily. Moreover, children over the age of 14 are basically enrolled in secondary schools and can communicate well with doctors. And in Chinese law, the age of 14 is also the boundary between children and adolescents. Ideally, we hope to conduct this study among all age",
