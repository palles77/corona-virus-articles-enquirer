            "text": "Plants have a highly sophisticated endomembrane system that is targeted by plant viruses for cell-to-cell movement. The movement protein (MP) of Ourmia melon virus (OuMV) is targeted to plasmodesmata (PD) and forms tubules to facilitate cell-to-cell movement. Despite a number of functionally important regions for correct subcellular localization of OuMV MP has been identified, little is known about the pathways OuMV MP hijacks to reach PD. Here, we demonstrate that OuMV MP localizes to the trans-Golgi network (TGN), but not to the multivesicular body/prevacuolar compartment or Golgi, and carries two putative sorting motifs, a tyrosine (Y) and a dileucine (LL) motif, near its N-terminus. Introducing glycine substitutions in these motifs results in loss of OuMV infectivity in Nicotiana benthamiana and Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). Live cell imaging of GFP-labeled sorting motif mutants shows that Y motif mutants fail to localize to the TGN, plasma membrane, and PD. Mutations in the LL motif do not impair plasma membrane targeting of MP, but affect its ability to associate with callose deposits at PD. Taken together, these data suggest that both Y and LL motifs are indispensable for targeting of OuMV MP to PD and for efficient systemic infection, but show differences in functionality. This study provides new insights into the role of sorting motifs in intracellular targeting of MPs and vesicle trafficking pathways that plant viruses hijack for cell-to-cell movement.",

The plant endomembrane system has unique players controlling trafficking pathways to modulate plant-specific cellular functions and environmental responses (reviewed by Fujimoto and Ueda, 2012) . The trans-Golgi network (TGN) acts as an early endosome (EE) and a major sorting platform where secretory, endocytic, and vacuolar pathways merge (Viotti et al., 2010) . Endocytosed cargoes are received by the TGN and these cargoes are either returned to the plasma membrane or sent to multivesicular bodies (MVBs)/prevacuolar compartments (PVCs), which in plant cells serve as late endosomes (LEs), for vacuolar degradation (reviewed by Fujimoto and Ueda, 2012; Cui et al., 2016) .",

            "text": "Heterotetrameric adaptor protein (AP) complexes are key components of protein sorting in endocytic and post-Golgi secretory pathways (reviewed by Canagarajah et al., 2013) . Genetic approaches in Arabidopsis have revealed that AP complexes function in hormone signaling (Di Rubbo et al., 2013; Fan et al., 2013; Kansup et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2013) , cytokinesis (Teh et al., 2013) , gravitropism (Niihama et al. 2009 ), reproduction Yamaoka et al., 2013; Feng et al., 2018) , and immunity (Hatsugai et al., 2016) . AP1 mediates protein transport from the TGN/EE to the plasma AP-dependent protein sorting is mediated most commonly by the recognition of tyrosine (Y), YXX\u00d8 and dileucine (LL), [D/E]XXXL[L/I] motifs (where \u00d8 is a bulky hydrophobic residue and X any amino acid) on cargo proteins. In plants, one of the most studied sorting signals is the Y motif. Several cell surface receptors, receptor-like kinases and receptor-like proteins (reviewed by Geldner and Robatzek, 2008) , transporters (BOR1; Takano et al., 2010) and vacuolar sorting receptors (Happel et al., 2004; Gershlick et al., 2014; Nishimura et al. 2016 ) carry Y motifs. There are, however, only a few reports showing the recognition of these signals by AP complexes (Holstein et al., 2002 : Happel et al., 2004 : Gershlick et al., 2014 . LL motifs in plants are far less studied. These motifs are important for sorting of tonoplast proteins (reviewed by Pedrazzini et al., 2013) , and in this context, the recognition of a LL motif by AP1, but not AP3, has been reported (Wang et al., 2014) . Whether this motif functions in plant endocytic pathways remains to be elucidated. Viral movement proteins (MPs) are critical for mediating virus movement through plasmodesmata (PD), as the size of virus nucleic acids and virions does not allow for passive intercellular movement. Indeed, localization of viral MPs to PD has been demonstrated, and some MPs can increase the PD size exclusion limit to allow for the passage of viruses into adjacent cells (reviewed by Benitez-Alfonso et al., 2010; Niehl and Henlein, 2011) . Viral MPs use various transport strategies to reach PD. One of these strategies is hijacking the host endomembrane system (reviewed by Pitzalis and Heinlein, 2017) . MPs of several viruses contain putative Y and LL motifs, but there are only few reports pertaining to the role of these sorting motifs in the targeting of viral MPs to PD. The MP of Grapevine fanleaf virus (GFLV, genus Nepovirus) contains putative Y and LL motifs near its N terminus and these motifs are also conserved in MPs of other nepoviruses (Laporte et al., 2003) . The triple gene block protein TGB3 of Poa semilatent virus (PSLV, genus Hordeivirus) harbors a conserved YQDLN motif, which conforms to a Y sorting motif, in the central hydrophilic region that is involved in targeting to the cell periphery (Solovyev et al., 2000) . Potato mop-top virus (PMTV, genus Pomovirus) TGB3 also carries the same motif in its central loop. The disruption of this motif abolishes the localization of PMTV TGB3 to the ER and to motile granules, and the targeting of PMTV TGB3 to plasmodesmata (Haupt et al., 2005; Tilsner et al., 2010) . Three Y motifs, YLPL/YGKF/YPKF, are present in Cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV, genus Caulimovirus) MP and at least one of the three motifs is required for endosomal localization of MP and for tubule formation. Moreover, CaMV MP directly interacts with Arabidopsis AP2M through the three Y motifs (Carluccio et al., 2014) .",

Confocal microscopy of green fluorescent protein-tagged OuMV MP (GFP:MPwt) also shows the presence of tubular/punctate structures protruding from the plasma membrane into the extracellular space in N. benthamiana and A. thaliana (Margaria et al., 2016) , as well as the presence of GFP:MP puncta between neighboring cells, co-localizing with callose deposits at PD (Crivelli et al., 2011; Margaria et al., 2016) . Alanine-scanning mutagenesis of conserved amino acids of MPs belonging to the 30KDa family revealed three residues at positions 98, 150 and 169 that are required for targeting of OuMV MP and tubule formation in protoplasts, and important for MP structure (Margaria et al., 2016) . It is, however, still unknown which intracellular pathways OuMV MP uses to facilitate cell-to-cell movement of virions. OuMV MP contains two potential internalization and trafficking motifs, one putative Y motif, YDKV (88-91), and one putative LL motif, . In this study, we investigated the involvement of OuMV MP in post-Golgi trafficking pathways, and characterized the individual function of each motif in relation to these pathways by introducing glycine substitutions into critical residues of these motifs and examining localization of mutants by confocal microscopy.",

To identify the nature of the endosomal compartments in which the MP resides, we transiently co-expressed mCherry-fused organelle marker proteins (Geldner et al., 2009) , VTI12 (a TGN marker; Uemura et al., 2004) , and RHA1 (a MVB/PVC marker; Sohn et al., 2003) , with GFP:MPwt along with RdRp and CP in N. benthamiana leaf epidermal cells. We also applied two well-known inhibitors of vesicle trafficking, brefeldin A (BFA; an ARF GEF inhibitor) and Wortmannin (Wm; a phosphatidylinositol-3 and -4 kinase inhibitor), to these cells to dissect the pathways through which MP is trafficked. mCherry:VTI12 showed the expected punctate pattern of TGN that overlapped with GFP:MPwt, as shown in Fig. 1B , suggesting that MP is recruited to TGN. While 81-89% of MP co-localized with the TGN marker, the co-localization of TGN marker with MP was 49-68%, suggesting that not all mCherry:VTI12-labeled TGN compartments were occupied by MP. We next examined the effect of BFA on GFP:MPwt at the TGN. It has been previously reported that 5-10 \u03bcM concentrations of BFA promote dissociation of TGN into small vesicular compartments in tobacco BY-2 cells (Ito et al., 2017) . Hence, we treated N. benthamiana leaves expressing both mCherry:VTI12 and GFP:MPwt with 10 \u00b5M BFA. Upon BFA treatment, both mCherry:VTI12 and GFP:MPwt dispersed into the cytoplasm. While GFP:MPwt dissociated into smaller punctate structures, some of these structures did not completely co-localize with the TGN marker ( Fig 1B, lower panel) . When we increased the concentration of BFA to 50 \u03bcM, we observed BFA-induced GFP:MPwt aggregates in N. benthamiana epidermal cells (not .

We hypothesize that formation of these aggregates were associated with the toxicity of BFA rather than direct effect of BFA on the trafficking pathways, and we used the lower concentration in all the further experiments.",

GFP signal was monitored at 36 hpi to confirm that all plant cells at the infiltrated areas were infected (Fig. S2 ). Quantification of RNA1 as proxy for replication was performed by qRT-PCR in all samples. At 24 hpi, all wild-type OuMV expressing samples displayed similar levels of RNA1 and all MP mutant expressing samples showed slightly higher amount of RNA1; however, this difference is not statistically significant, suggesting that all mutant constructs were similarly expressed via agrobacterium transient expression (Fig. S3 ). While all mutants were able to replicate at high levels at 48 hpi, we observed a 3.5-to 7-fold decrease in the replication of all mutants compared to the wild-type (Fig. 2E ).

In addition, OuMV MP was not associated with MVBs/PVCs in the absence or presence of Wm (Fig. 1C) , confirming that MP trafficks in the first stages of vesicular trafficking, but not in MVB/PVC-to-vacuole pathway, in contrast to CaMV MP (Carluccio et al., 2014) and PTMV TGB2 (Haupt et al., 2005) , which co-localize with ARA7-positive MVBs/PVCs. Although OuMV MP showed sensitivity to Wm, this response was different from that of MVBs/PVCs. Based on the finding that OuMV MP localizes to the TGN and does not enter either in the canonical secretory or MVB/PVCto-vacuole pathways, we hypothesize that MP constitutively cycles between the plasma membrane and the TGN.",

A key question emerging from this observation is whether the Y motif in OuMV MP is a functional internalization motif.

In plants, CME of plasma membrane proteins depends on Y motifs in their cytoplasmic domains to be recognized by AP2M (Di Rubbo et al., 2013; Fan et al., 2013; Kim et al., 2013; Yamaoka et al., 2013) and it has been previously shown that CaMV MP is able to bind Arabidopsis AP2\u00b5 through three Y motifs (Carluccio et al., 2014) .

Additionally, we did not observe any changes in the infectivity of OuMV in the absence of AP2M in Arabidopsis (Table 2) . It is, however, known that AP2M is not the sole regulator of CME in plants; a CME adaptor complex, TPLATE complex (TPC), is involved in the initiation of CME and is thus crucial for recruitment of clathrin and AP2 (Gadeyne et al., 2014) . Moreover, AP2 subunits are considered to form partially active complexes in the absence of single subunits (Wang et al., 2016) . Hence, other AP2 subunits and/or TPC may be important for internalization of OuMV MP, and in turn for infectivity of OuMV. At this point, we do not have enough evidence that the internalization of OuMV MP directly depends on AP2M.",

Once OuMV MP reaches the plasma membrane, it is endocytosed, sorted into the TGN and then recycled back to the plasma membrane, bypassing the MVB/PVC-to-vacuole pathway, to maintain its presence at the plasma membrane and to reach PD. The retrieval of MP from the plasma membrane is possibly AP2M-independent and does not depend on the Y motif (AP2M binding site). On the other hand, the plasmodesmal targeting of MP relies on the LL motif, potentially through its function in endocytic pathways. The precise molecular mechanism of MP targeting is, however, still unknown. In fact, the N-terminal region of MP retaining the LL motif does not act as a plasmodesmal targeting, as opposed to the TMV MP, in which the first 50 amino acid residues were characterized as a plasmodesmal localization signal (Yuan et al., 2016) .

Although this model requires further examination to understand the mechanistic details of the targeting of OuMV MP to PD, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study showing the role of a LL motif in plasmodesmal targeting of MPs. Movement proteins are often associated to the sites of viral replication, thus it is extremely hard to untangle if a disturbance in viral replication, as the one seen with our mutants, is due to mislocalization of the viral MP from the site of replication, or to modifications of the sites of replication. Our present efforts focus on identifying host factors that are directly involved in post-Golgi trafficking of OuMV MP and cell-to-cell movement of OuMV, to better elucidate the molecular mechanism of the virus movement. Simple viral systems, such as the one presented by OuMV, are an invaluable tool that can be advantageously used to identify missing components of highly complex plant trafficking pathways.",

Scale bar, 20\u03bcm, 10 \u03bcm (magnified region). (E) The quantification of callose deposits (blue), punctate structures labeled by OuMV GFP:MPwt or GFP:MP mutants (magenta), and co-localized particles (gray) per area of view. The particles were counted using the ComDet v.0.4.1 plugin in ImageJ. At least 6 areas of view were examined (n\u22656) and the total number of counted particles for each sample is more than 700. Error bars indicate standard error of the mean. (F) The statistical analysis of colocalized particles in (E).

It is retrieved from the plasma membrane (purple) and transported to the TGN (light purple). AP2M is not directly involved in this process. From the TGN, the MP is recycled back to the plasma membrane (orange). The Y motif (gray box) possibly acts as a structural motif rather than a functional internalization motif, whereas the LL motif (pink box) is required for correct plasmodesmal targeting of MP.

To characterize the subcellular distribution of MP mutants, we transiently expressed GFP:MP mutants and GFP:MPwt, as a control, with CP and RdRP in N. benthamiana epidermal cells (Fig. S4). Similar to GFP:MPwt (Fig. S4A, left panel), GFP-tagged Y motif MP mutants, GFP:MP_Y and GFP:MP_Y/G, appeared to be distributed in the cytoplasm at 36 hpi and 48 hpi (Fig. S4B-C, left panels) with any noticeable change at 72 hpi (Fig. S4B-C, right panel). Y motif mutants accumulated in transvacuolar strands and in patches at the cell cortex. Puncta that were consistently observed in GFP:MPwt (Movie S2) were no longer GFP:MP_Y and GFP:MP_Y/G (Movie S3). Occasionally, a few punctate structures were observed in GFP:MP_Y/G; however, these structures were either stationary or had rather restricted movement (Movie S3). GFP-tagged LL motif MP mutants had a cytoplasmic localization at earlier time points (Fig. S4D-F), with peripheral and cytoplasmic puncta readily observable at 60 hpi, similar to GFP:MPwt (Fig. S4D-F, Movie S4). 4. Mutations in the Y but not in the LL motif impair plasma membrane targeting of MP To examine whether Y and LL motif MP mutants are targeted to the plasma membrane, we stained N. benthamiana protoplasts expressing GFP:MPwt or GFP:MP mutants with FM4-64, a plasma membrane marker. GFP:MPwt showed a continuous signal at the cell periphery and this signal strongly overlapped with FM4-64 (Fig. 3A). The peripheral signal of GFP:MP_Y and GFP:MP_Y/G often did not co-localize with FM4-64 (Fig. 3B-C). A similar pattern was observed in N. benthamiana epidermal cells expressing GFP:MP_Y or GFP:MP_Y/G, where the peak of FM4-64 often positioned in between two peaks of the MP mutants, suggesting that plasma membrane localization of GFP:MP_Y and GFP:MP_Y/G followed a different pattern than GFP:MPwt (Fig. S5).Moreover, both mutants exhibited an intense and diffuse cytoplasmic signal. Similar to GFP:MPwt, the peripheral signal of GFP:MP_D/G overlapped with FM4-64, indicating that GFP:MP_D/G localized to plasma membrane(Fig. 3D). The movement deficient mutant GFP:MP_D also displayed a peripheral signal that colocalized with FM4-64; however, the GFP signal was not evenly distributed along and accumulated at specific sites(Fig. 3E). GFP:MP_LI/GG had an intermediate pattern between GFP:MP_D and GFP:MP_D/G that was more similar to GFP:MPwt(Fig. 3F).To investigate these observations, N. benthamiana epidermal cells expressing GFP:MPwt or mutants were subjected to plasmolysis. While GFP:MPwt, GFP:MP_D, GFP:MP_D/G and GFP:MP_LI/GG were associated with Hechtian strands that attach the plasma membrane to the cell wall(Fig. 4A, 4D-E), GFP:MP_Y or GFP:MP_Y/G (Fig. 4B-C) did not exhibit the same pattern, as GFP-marked strands were absent from the space between the protoplast and the cell wall(Fig. 4). Plasma membrane localization of GFP:MP_D and GFP:MP_LI/GG suggests that mutations of the LL motif do not impair plasma membrane targeting of MP, but alter uniform distribution of MP along the plasma membrane.",
