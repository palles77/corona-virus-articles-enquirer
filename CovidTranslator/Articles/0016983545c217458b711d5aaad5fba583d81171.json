The infectivity titer was the highest when the plates were centrifuged at 400 X g (1500 rpm) for 2 h. All five strains classified as FIPV Type I showed infectivity titers enhanced lo-lOO-fold by centrifugation at 400 X g for 2 h. The centrifugal enhancement of infection was obtained only by centrifugation immediately after inoculation of the virus, suggesting that the enhancement occurs during attachment or adsorption of viruses to the cells.

            "text": "Feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV), family coronaviridae, genus Coronavirus, produces a chronic, progressive, immunologically mediated disease in domestic and exotic cats. FIPV is classified as Type I and Type II (Pedersen et al., 1984; Hohdatsu et al., 1991a,b) . The FIPV Type I virus group shows poor proliferative activity in cell culture, and a neutralization test for this virus group is also difficult. On the other hand, the FIPV Type II virus group proliferates well in cell culture, and is widely used for studying FIPV. In the case of strain 79-1146 in the Type II group, all of the base sequences have been identified (Jacobs et al., 1987; Vennema et al., 1991) . Both Types I and II cause infectious peritonitis in cats, but the pathogenicity of Type II FIPV is greater than that of Type I FIPV (Pedersen, 1987) . However, in the field, the prevalence of FIPV Type I is high, and about 70% of feline cases of FIP are due to infection with Type I (Hohdatsu et al., 1992) . To help the study of FIPV Type I it is necessary to improve the method of in vitro culture. Some studies have shown that infectivity is enhanced by centrifugation of cells following viral inoculation onto cell cultures for influenza virus (Woods and Johnson, 1989; Seno et al., 1990) , herpesvirus (Oefinger et al., 1990; Tenser, 19781, human immunodeficiency virus (Pietroboni et al., 19891 , and blue tongue virus (Sundin and Mecham, 1989) . Centrifugal inoculation of FIPV Type I was investigated as a technique to improve the in vitro infectivity of this virus.",

The time when the effect (centrifugal enhancement) would have occurred, at the time of attachment/adsorption of viruses to the cells or thereafter, was experimentally determined in the FIPV system. The enhancing effect was studied with strain Black by plaque assay. After viral inoculation, the cells were divided into four groups according to the following methods: those that were centrifuged at 400 X g for 2 h immediately after the inoculation (Method A); those that were washed with HBSS after adsorption at 37\u00b0C for 1 h, followed by centrifugation (Method B), those onto which viruses were inoculated after centrifugation of the cells alone for 2 h (Method C), and those that were not centrifuged as the controls (Method D). Infectious titers of these groups were Fig. 2 . The titer was increased only when the cells were centrifuged immediately after viral inoculation. This result suggests that the enhancement of infection occurs at the time of attachment/adsorption of viruses to the cells. Even when viruses were inoculated onto cells that were preliminarily centrifuged, infection was not enhanced. Simultaneous centrifugation of the viruses and the cells was necessary for the enhancement of infection. It is impossible that centrifugation at 400 X 6 would have directly caused an increase in the efficiency of attachment/adsorption of the viruses to the cells. Centrifugation of cells may induce changes in the cell's virus receptor, and if a virus is present there, it will become easy for it to be attached or adsorbed to the cell, possibly leading to enhancement of infection.",
