Based on data collected from 141 experienced taxpayers in Taiwan, the acceptance and the impact of quality antecedents on taxpayers' perceived usefulness (PU) and perceived ease of use (PEOU) of the system were assessed and evaluated. The results indicated that the model of Internet tax-filing system was accepted with a reasonable goodness-of-fit. Three important findings include the following items. First, TAM proves to be a valid model to explain the taxpayers' acceptance of the Internet tax-filers' system. Meanwhile, PU has created more impact than PEOU on taxpayers' intention to use the system. Second, PU is positively influenced by such factors as information system quality (ISQ), information quality (IQ), as well as perceived credibility (PC). Third, IQ has a positive impact on PEOU.

            "text": "In Taiwan, there are three major tax-filing methods: manual filing, two-dimension (2D) bar code filing, and Internet filing. Since 1998, the Taiwan government has moved aggressively to promote Internet tax filings under the e-government initiative, the goals of which are a paperless environment, an efficient process, and the public's convenience in contacting government agencies. 1 The tax authority in Taiwan, the National Tax Administration (NTA), promoted the system by providing incentives, such as faster tax refunds and online credit card payment, which results in an increasing number of Internet tax filers (see Table 1 ). With regard to the aforementioned three methods, public satisfaction is greatest with the 2D bar code filing, and the manual filing method is the least satisfactory. 2 Despite all the efforts of NTA's promotion and the low satisfaction, traditional manual filing remains the most widespread method. Though 2D bar code is classified as an electronic tax-filing method, it still requires taxpayers to print their return in paper form and mail it to the government agent. Therefore, this study focuses on the Internet tax-filing method, the only method that would eventually achieve one of the e-government's goals to be paperless, and examines the critical factors that influence the acceptance of the Internet tax-filing system.",

Several past studies have examined the relationship of perceived ease of use (PEOU), perceived usefulness (PU), attitudes, intention, and the usage of information technologies. Lee et al. 3 summarized the information systems examined by TAM in 101 articles published by leading IS journals and conferences from 1986 to 2003 into four different classes: communication system (20%), general purpose system (28%), office system (27%), and specialized business system (25%). Among this research, little was done in the e-government area. However, applying TAM to the e-government system can lead to a better understanding not only of public acceptance of the Internet tax-filing system but also of the possible differences between the e-government and other types of Internet applications.",

Since 1992, nearly 300 articles in leading journals have referred to or adopted the D&M IS success model. 6 Among these success variables, the conceptualization of the buseQ construct was especially confusing in the original D&M model. The IS use was defined as the consumption of IS output which is consistent with a process model of IS success. Seddon 13 identifies three distinct models intermingled in the D&M model, each reflecting a different interpretation of IS use. From a process model of IS success, buseQ depicts the sequence of events relating to an IS. A second meaning is a variable that proxies for the benefits from buse.Q A third meaning is the dependent variable in a variance model of future IS use in which the role of IS use is used to describe behavior. To avoid the confusion associated with D&M, this study used D&M-like 6 quality antecedents to summarize the external variables of the TAM acceptance model for the Internet tax-filing system.",

ISQ is often measured by multi-items such as useful functionality, accessibility, flexibility, integration among sub-systems, response time, reliability, accuracy of data processing, ease-of-use, and ease-of-learning. 5, 11, 28, 29 The IQ represents the users' perception of the output quality generated by an information system and includes such issues as the relevance, timeliness, and accuracy. 6, 13 Service quality was introduced in the IS originally to measure the quality of services provided by IT departments in organizations. Researchers have applied and tested the SERVQUAL measurement instrument from marketing 30, 31 into the D&M original model. Some debates 32 challenged the SERVQUAL metric, identifying bproblems with the reliability, discriminant validity, convergent validity, and predictive validity of the measure.Q Service quality was often measured by tangibles, reliability, responsiveness, assurance, and empathy. D&M 6 suggested that each of the three quality dimensions (IQ, ISQ, and Service Quality) has different weights depending upon the level of analysis. They also suggested, bTo measure the success of a single system, INFORMATION QUALITY or SYSTEM QUALITY may be the most important quality component. For measuring the overall success of the IS department, as opposed to individual systems, SERVICE QUALITY may become a more important variable.Q 6 Credibility can be simply defined as believability. Credibility was seen as a perceived quality of a computer system. 6, 33 In the Internet era, security and privacy issues have been the primary concerns to Internet users. A credible Web site needs to safeguard personal information from unauthorized access or disclosure, accidental loss, and alteration or destruction. Studies indicated that the users' perceptions of credibility regarding security and privacy were found to influence the user's intention to use Webbased IT application. 14,34, 36 Wang 14 further explained that bperceived fears of divulging personal information and users' feelings of insecurity provide unique challenges to planners to find ways in which to develop users' perceived credibility of electronic taxfiling systems.Q Therefore, perceived credibility is considered as another important quality factor in the Internet tax-filing system.",

Different constructs influence the usage of various systems differently. Lewis 4 predicted system usability in three dimensions: system usefulness, interface quality, and information quality. D&M used IQ, ISQ, and Service quality, while TAM used PU, PEOU, attitude, and intention to forecast the usage. However, only a few empirical studies 11, 38, 39 were done to find causality among these constructs. Fig. 2 depicts the research model of this study. The development of our research model is based on two points of view. The first point of view, from TAM, is that an IT usage is determined by the beliefs that a user holds about the PU and PEOU of the system. Meanwhile, external variables of TAM affect usage behavior only through their impact on beliefs of PU and PEOU. 41, 42 The second viewpoint is the quality antecedents of usage from D&M 6 and Wang. 14 The authors then extracted part of the Davis model that has been validated by many studies: PU and PEOU impact on ATT, and the ATT impacts on BI. The external variables that impact PU and PEOU generated significant and insignificant mixed results. 3 As a result, the external variables are summarized using D&M-like 5 quality DeLone and McLean 6 included the service quality aspect of e-commerce; however, the Internet tax-filing system is not a commercial product. Since its first launching in 1998 until now, most users of the Internet tax-filing system are assumed to be early adopters who have greater capability to deal with abstractions and rationality, and are assumed to have a more favorable attitude toward changes than later adopters. 24 To this end, they may emphasize service quality less. Meanwhile, service quality is also involved in some controversial issues. Due to the aforementioned issues, service quality was not included in this study.",

Government will behave in a dependable, ethical, and socially appropriate manner. Therefore, instead of the trust construct, 34 Wang's 14 perceived credibility regarding security and privacy that influenced the user's intention of using electronic tax filing is included in this study.

Consistent with these aforementioned two points, the authors propose that the constructs hypothesized (e.g., IQ, ISQ, and PC) affect the use of Internet tax filing indirectly through their effect on PU and PEOU. The definition of IQ, ISQ, and PC in this study will be explained in the next section. Considering that the filing of individual income taxes is done annually, the actual behavior of continued usage is excluded in this study.

Consequently, these items were used to measure the PU of Internet tax filing. PEOU was defined as the degree to which a user expects the use of the Internet tax-filing system to be free of effort 46 and was measured by four items adapted from Davis' study. 46 ISQ is judged globally by the degree to which the technical components (including software, help screens, and user manuals) of Internet tax filing provide the quality information and service required by users. ISQ is often measured by attributes such as useful functionality, accessibility, flexibility, integration among sub-systems, response time, reliability, accuracy of data processing, ease-of-use, and ease-of-learning. 5, 11, 28, 29 After screening out the overlap of PU and PEOU, and modifying according to input from the focus group, ISQ, in this study, was measured by four attributes: usefulness of functions, process reliability, response time, and ease of navigation. IQ is judged globally by the degree to which users are provided with quality information with regard to their needs. IQ is often measured by attributes such as accuracy, precision, understandability, readability, clarity, suitable format, completeness, relevancy, timeliness, and freedom from bias. 5, 47, 49 After screening out the overlap of PU and PEOU, and modifying according to input from the focus group, IQ, in this study, was measured by four attributes: information reliability, relevance, adequacy, and understandability. Finally, perceived credibility was defined as the extent of users' confidence in the Internet taxfiling system's ability to protect the user's personal information and security. These aforementioned two items were adapted from Wang. 14 According to Hwang's 2 survey results, the dominant users of electronic tax filing in Taiwan were men with a college education, and with years of computer-related experiences.

In this research, the composite reliability for each construct in the measurement model was above 0.90 (see Table 4 ). Further, another measure of reliability is the average variance extracted. This measure reflects the overall amount of variance in the indicators accounted for by the latent construct. Higher variance extracted value occurs when the indicators are truly representative of the latent construct. The average variance extracted measure is a complementary measure to the construct reliability value. Guidelines suggest that the average extracted variance value should exceed a 0.50 level for a construct, which means more than one-half of the variances observed. In Table 4 , average variances extracted for all constructs were above 0.70. As a result, it is concluded that all the constructs used in this study were highly reliable. The constructs employed were further examined using convergent and discriminant validity analysis to validate the prediction of taxpayers' acceptance of the Internet tax-filing system. Convergent validity is assessed by testing whether the factor loading that relate each indicator to the construct of interest are all significant, 52, 53 i.e., t values greater than 1.96 ( P b 0.05). In this study, all t values are between 3.13 and 33.20, which indicates good convergent validity. Discriminant validity is the degree to which measures of different concepts are distinct. To test discriminant validity, Fornell and Larcker 54 suggested that the squared correlations between two different measures in any two constructs should be statistically lower than the variance shared by the measures of a construct. All shared variances between any two different constructs were, in fact, less than the amount of variance extracted by one of the two constructs (see Table 5 ). Therefore, the constructs of the proposed research model exhibit adequate discriminant validity. Table 6 contains the LISRELcalculated correlations among the constructs.",

The possible explanations include the following: First, the effect of PEOU on IT usage often decreases with user familiarity with the IT. 59 Only experienced Internet tax-filing taxpayers were selected in this study, and most of them were already familiar with the operation of the Internet taxfiling method. Therefore, the effect of PEOU on Internet filing acceptance is not as important as PU. Second, the respondents' education level in this study was, on average, higher than that in Wang's study. In general, higher education assures more computer and Internet experience. Therefore, PEOU may not be an important concern for these respondents.",

The possible explanation may be that experienced computer/Internet users have less patience for low ISQ. A slow response system is considered to be useless and not worth the wait compared with a difficult-to-use system. Lastly, the empirical result shows that PC has created a certain impact on PU.

Since the current experienced users weigh PU heavily, the NTA should propose some promotional plans that capitalize on the benefits of using the Internet tax-filing system in order to retain/keep the current users. The PU has a three times stronger impact than PEOU (PU: 0.74, PEOU: 0.21) on attitude toward the system, which then influences the intention to use the system next year and afterwards. To increase the PU of using the Internet tax-filing system, the tax agency needs to provide a better ISQ, IQ, and PC. For example, faster response time of the Internet tax-filing system will lead users to perceive higher usefulness of the system. Under budget constraints, the priority of the improvement should start from ISQ, then IQ, and finally PC, respectively, since each has an impact on PU as ISQ: 0.37; IQ: 0.28; and PC: 0.10. Besides, the empirical results also show that the quality factors (e.g., IQ, ISQ,) of the Internet tax-filing system have positive impacts on taxpayers' PEOU of using the system.

A major reason was the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak in Taiwan during the 2003 tax-filing season.
