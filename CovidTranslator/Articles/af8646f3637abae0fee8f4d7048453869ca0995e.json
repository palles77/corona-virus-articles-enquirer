Given that emergency physicians often make decisions for strangers with little time to engage in shared decisionmaking, they tend to be overly cautious in risk assessment. Physician risk aversion may be further consolidated and informed by their personal risk tolerance, fear of malpractice, patients' demands (perceived and real), and their own, as well as society's, increasing disquiet with uncertainty. [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] Increased risk tolerance may correlate with the chance of a missed diagnosis or bad outcome. Because these events are often incorrectly attributed to physician error (rather than systems errors) and subject physicians to personal, professional, and legal liabilities, it is not surprising that physicians often practice medicine in a manner that minimizes their personal risk. 14 Additionally, physicians and patients may have different risk thresholds. Physicians may be more risk averse than patients because patients have not seen the rare but devastating outcomes that physicians have seen. Furthermore, physicians, by nature of their socioeconomic status, training, or personality, may be more risk averse than patients. Fear of malpractice and the fact that their cumulative risk for a bad outcome is much higher than each patient's cumulative risk (because they have multiple exposures and the patient has only 1) are other reasons that physicians may be more risk averse than patients.",

First and foremost, we as a society would have to decide what is an acceptable level of risk for particular condition. Is a 2% miss rate for acute coronary syndromes acceptable? What about for grade 1 splenic lacerations in trauma patients? Clearly these questions are complex and involve multiple competing financial, philosophical, and practical interests. Concurrent with this discussion, physicians themselves would have to define guidelines on how to characterize the risk of a particular clinical scenario, a difficult task, given the amount of both disagreement and lack of accurate risk information that currently exists. 3, [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] Additionally, if they adhered to such guidelines, physicians would have to feel legally protected so they could begin to manage population rather than patient or personal risk. 20, 21 Complicating this entire process is the fact that individuals do not always make normatively rational decisions. Our decisions have repeatedly been shown to be subject to biases, including priming bias, framing bias, anchoring bias, hindsight bias, and a strong preference for loss aversion, all of which will influence clinical decisions in ways that will complicate any formulation of societal or professional risk guidelines. [22] [23] [24] Q1.b Editor's Note: This question was incorrectly worded in the original July 2013 publication. The question has been corrected in these Answers and on the Annals Web site. The editors apologize for the error. Assume that 2% of all patients presenting to the ED have a chief complaint of headache, that the percentage of these ED headache patients who have subarachnoid bleeding matches the percentage suggested in the Marks et al paper. Also assume that the 97% sensitivity reported for Mark et al's decision rule has been externally validated, and that a typical emergency physician treats 3500 patients per year. On average, how many years would an emergency physician have to apply this clinical rule to miss 1 subarachnoid hemorrhage? Do these sound like reasonable numbers to you? Why or why not?",

Estimates of this risk are controversial and have been largely extrapolated from the atomic bomb survivors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. A recent review estimates the risk of death from a single head CT to be just under 1 in 1,000 for neonates. 27 This risk rapidly decreases to approximately 1 in 10,000 for 15-year-olds and then even further subsequently. The pediatric risk figure has been reproduced in a recent retrospective cohort study. 28 The most common complication associate with lumbar puncture is a postdural headache, which can occur in up to 40% of patients and lasts less than 5 days in 80% of people. 29 The risk is highest in the 18-to 30-year-old age group and is much less in children and patients older than 60 years. Low back pain has also been described in up to 35% of patients. Other described complications are much rarer, including transient cranial neuropathies, local infection, meningitis, subdural hematoma, subarachnoid bleeding, and spinal hematoma. The recent deaths associated with contaminated medications remind us that any invasive procedure and routine medication administrations are not without potential severe morbidity and mortality. [30] [31] [32] Estimating the incidence of radiation-induced mortality from the same emergency physician described in question 1B is difficult because of the age variance of patients who present to the ED with acute atraumatic headaches (14% younger than 18 years, 65% aged 18 to 49 years, and 21% older than 50 years). 33 We can grossly estimate the risk of these age groups to be 1/10,000, greater than 1/20,000, and near zero, respectively. For simplicity, taking the average as 1/20,000 and assuming that 30% of patients with acute atraumatic headaches receive a CT scan, 33 we estimate the risk of radiation-induced mortality to be as follows:",

Despite their proliferation in the literature and their use in the ED, studies on the effect of clinical decision rules have had mixed results. The Ottawa Knee Rule and the Ottawa Ankle Rule have demonstrated either a reduction in imaging use or mixed results. 36, 37 Decision rules for imaging in patients with low back pain, minor head trauma, and pulmonary embolism have unintentionally been associated with increased use of radiographic imaging. 35 During the past 20 years, there has been a vast increase in the use of CT angiography for testing ED patients for pulmonary embolism, without any real mortality benefit. [38] [39] [40] In fact, testing itself may lead to more harm than benefit as a consequence of the adverse effects of overdiagnosis and overtesting. 39 It is entirely possible that the validated clinical decision rule in this article will also lead to additional testing because it will be indiscriminately applied to all patients with a headache, not simply those with a suspected subarachnoid hemorrhage. When a disease is rare or occurs long after the exposure, randomized trials and cohort studies are infeasible. Consider, for example, the expense and logistic challenges of following cohorts of 16-to 20-year-old smokers and nonsmokers to determine how often they get lung cancer. First, it will take many, many years for the lung cancer to develop; the investigator will likely have retired before outcomes data are collected. Second, only a small fraction of smokers (15% at most) ever get lung cancer, meaning that one would need to follow a large cohort to ensure adequate power. Third, keeping contact with persons in the cohort will be difficult and expensive during the 50-year study period; accurately tracking their smoking status during this time may be even more challenging. In such situations, it may be more practical to identify a group of patients with lung cancer and a similar group without lung cancer and query both on their smoking history. This case-control study can be more easily accomplished than a prospective cohort study.",

Consider the example of cigarette smoking and lung cancer. Let us imagine we were concerned that radon exposure was a confounder because radon causes lung cancer (the confounder is associated with the outcome) and radon exposure may be associated with smoking status (the confounder is associated with the exposure). In a cohort study, we would attempt to match so that that the percentage of persons with radon exposure would be the same in smokers and nonsmokers, thereby reducing the possibility that radon could confound the relationship between smoking and lung cancer. In a case-control study on this topic, we would ensure that there was an equal percentage of persons with radon exposure in the lung cancer and no lung cancer groups. This does not mean that the percentage of persons who were exposed to radon will be the same in smokers and nonsmokers. In fact, we can be assured that the percentage will differ from whatever values those relationships would have had in an unmatched study. Because radon does cause lung cancer, we would expect that the percentage of subjects exposed to radon would be higher in the lung cancer group. By forcing more radon-exposed persons into the non-lung cancer group than normally would have been there, we alter the composition of that group. If there is a positive association between radon exposure and smoking status, then matching will ensure that more people in the control group will smoke, thereby decreasing the crude association of smoking and lung cancer. By stratifying the analysis on radon status, however, we can obtain estimates of the smoking-lung cancer association that are not confounded by radon status. Matching helps because it ensures that there is sufficient balance in the tables to ensure statistical efficiency. Without matching, certain cells may have too few individuals and confidence intervals of the estimates of the odds ratio may be needlessly wide.",

This increased precision on the control side will result in increased precision of the measure of the difference between case and control rates. Thus, adding controls is a way to increase the precision of the estimate without finding more cases. However, at some point making further improvements in the precision of the control estimate adds little to overall precision because the imprecision of the case estimate becomes the limiting factor. As shown in the Figure, although adding a second and third control for each case narrows the confidence interval considerably, additional controls provide marginal improvements in precision that are typically not worth the effort.

Rather the definitive cause of the subarachnoid hemorrhage is often determined as a result of stepwise testing aimed first at evaluating patients for an aneurysm with either digital subtraction angiography or CT angiography. 25 These modalities will reveal most vascular lesions responsible for the subarachnoid hemorrhage such as an arteriovenous malformation or arterial dissection. Patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage and negative evaluation results based on digital subtraction angiography or CTA subsequently undergo a gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and spinal cord. One exception to the above may be perimesencephalic nonaneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage, which is often suspected according to the initial location of subarachnoid hemorrhage bleeding. However, even in these cases, aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage must be excluded with additional testing before a definitive diagnosis can be made.",

The proportion of these variables is mathematically defined as the sensitivity of a test (TP/TP\u00feFN) and can be described as the proportion of actual positives that are correctly identified as such. Conversely, confirmatory tests should be focused on ensuring that healthy people are identified as disease free (true negatives [TNs] ) and minimize the number of healthy people incorrectly identified as having disease (false positives [FPs] ). The proportion of these can be mathematically defined as the specificity of a test (TN/TN\u00feFP). In actuality, for every test there is a tradeoff between capturing all patients with a disease and falsely identifying healthy persons as diseased. This tradeoff can be articulated with the test characteristics of the test (sensitivity and specificity) and the loss function, the explicit description of how one values an FN compared with an FP. For example, if, for a certain condition, an FP test result can easily be identified as such by a second, inexpensive, harmless test, then an FP is not so bad, and if missing the disease is a bad thing, we would want to avoid FNs much more than FPs. In that case, we would be willing to gain a higher sensitivity at the expense of lower specificity because that combination meets our goal of minimizing FN even if we incur additional FPs. In a different circumstance, however, we might be willing to accept FNs but cannot tolerate FPs and we would choose a cut off point for the test that had a high specificity even if the sensitivity were lower. To recapitulate, there is no way to optimize a test without specifying how one values an FN versus an FP. Articles that claim optimization of sensitivity and specificity without explicitly stating the tradeoff are making an incomplete statement, and those that maximize the sum of sensitivity and specificity are essentially stating that FPs and FNs are equally distasteful, a condition that is seldom true.",

Whereas classical statistical analysis examines how results might change due to chance alone, sensitivity analyses typically examine how non-random phenonmena (biases) might alter results. For example one might ask \"In a study using convenience sampling in which enrollees' initial problem was classified as mild, moderate, or severe, how would results change if there were 15% more severe patients and 15% less mild ones. Performing a sensitivity analysis is critical to determine how potential biases might influence the results.

            "text": "Bootstrapping is a statistical resampling technique that can be used to internally validate a prognostic model (ie, clinical decision rule). Steyerberg et al recommend bootstrapping for estimating internal validity of a predictive logistic regression model. 44 The method is described as \"[b]ootstrapping replicates the process of sample generation from an underlying population by drawing samples with replacement from the original data set, of the same size as the original data set.\" 44, 45 What is unique about bootstrapping is the idea of select and replace. In each bootstrap repetition, the computer selects the same number of patients as were in the original sample, but the computer might select an individual patient 0, 1, or n times. The prediction model is then derived in each bootstrap sample and applied to the bootstrap and original samples. The model's performance in the bootstrap sample and the original sample reflects the apparent validation and the internal validation, respectively. The difference in these 2 values indicates the estimated optimism of the model's discrimination. 46, 47 This sampling procedure is typically repeated at least 500 to 1,000 times to obtain stable results. 48, 49 This optimism value is then subtracted from the apparent performance of the original model derived from the original sample to obtain an optimism-corrected, stable estimate of model performance. 46, 47 The bootstrap method is more efficient than the split sample analysis because it permits use of the entire sample for development of the decision rule rather than splitting the sample into 2 smaller derivation and validation groups. 44 Furthermore, the bootstrap validation method has been shown to appropriately reflect all sources of model uncertainty, including variable selection. 47 The bootstrap technique does have some limitations in that only automated modeling strategies (eg, fitting a full model without selection or automated stepwise variable selection) can be chosen for the original model development. 47 Variable reduction techniques, testing both univariate and multivariate P values, and assessing proportional hazards for a Cox regression model may be difficult to replicate in the bootstrap testing. 47 The bootstrap method assumes that bootstrap sample's distribution of data is a reasonable representation of the distribution of data within the study population. 49 If this assumption is not met (eg, a poorly designed study with severely biased data), then the bootstrap resampling may result in additional sampling bias, leading to invalid results and conclusions. 49 Section editors: Tyler W.
