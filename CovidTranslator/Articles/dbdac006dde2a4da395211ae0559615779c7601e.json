Special equipment needs are minimal, and the approach to handling ferrets is similar in many ways to that for dogs and cats. Ferret owners regularly seek veterinary care for a variety of reasons: ferrets need preventive vaccinations for canine distemper and rabies; ferrets have a relatively short life span compared with that of cats and dogs; ferrets in the United States and in some European countries have a high incidence of endocrine, gastrointestinal, and neoplastic diseases; and many of the diseases common to ferrets are not easily ignored by the pet owner (e.g., alopecia resulting from adrenal disease and hypoglycemic episodes caused by insulinoma).",

However, an assistant is usually needed when taking the rectal temperature, when administering injections or oral medications, or if an animal has a tendency to bite. Young ferrets often nip, and nursing females and ferrets that are handled infrequently may bite. Unlike dogs and cats, which growl, ferrets will bite without warning. Therefore always ask the owner if the ferret will bite before handling it and take precautions accordingly. Make sure to obtain the rabies vaccination history before physical examination, as reporting and rabies protocols for animal bites from vaccinated and unvaccinated ferrets differ (see below). Ferrets that are prone to bite and are not currently vaccinated for rabies may need tranquilization for procedures that require restraint.",

            "text": "Depending on the ferret's disposition, several basic manual restraint methods can be used for physical examination. For tractable animals, lightly restrain the ferret on the examination table. Examine the mucous membranes, oral cavity, head, and integument. Then pick the ferret up and use one hand for support under its body while using the second hand to auscultate the thorax and palpate the abdomen. The ferret can be scruffed at any time for vaccination, ear cleaning, or other procedures that may elicit an attempt to escape or bite. For a very active animal or one that bites, scruff the ferret at the back of its neck and suspend it with all four legs off the table (Fig. 2-1 ). Most ferrets become very relaxed with this hold, and the veterinarian is able to examine the oral cavity, head, and body; auscultate the chest; and palpate the abdomen easily. However, this method may not work for very fractious animals.",

            "text": "Most ferrets strenuously object to having their temperature taken with a rectal thermometer. If a ferret struggles during the examination, the temperature taken at the end of the examination may be artificially high. Therefore measure the rectal temperature early in the physical examination with a flexible digital thermometer that is well lubricated. The normal range of rectal temperature of a ferret is 100.5\u00b0F to 102.5\u00b0F (38.0\u00b0C to 39.2\u00b0C); a mean of 102\u00b0F (38.8\u00b0C), with a wider range of 100\u00b0F to 104\u00b0F (37.8\u00b0C to 40.0\u00b0C), is also reported. 21 Interestingly, in normal ferrets housed outdoors at a fur farm in very cold ambient temperatures (21\u00b0F [\u22126.1\u00b0C]), the mean 24-hour mean core body temperature measured by sterile thermosensitive data loggers implanted in their abdomens was 99.3\u00b0F (37.4\u00b0C), with a range of 97.3\u00b0F to 101.1\u00b0F (36.3\u00b0C to 38.4\u00b0C). 41 The physical examination of a ferret is basically the same as that of any small mammal and can be performed quickly and efficiently if a few simple guidelines are followed. Observe the attitude and alertness of the animal. Ferrets may sleep in the carrier in the veterinary office; however, once awakened for the examination, a ferret should be alert and responsive. Assess hydration by observing the skin turgor of the eyelids, tenting of the skin at the back of the neck, and moistness of the oral mucous membranes. However, skin turgor can be difficult to evaluate in a cachectic animal. Estimate the capillary refill time by digitally pressing on the gingiva.",

Although no vaccine reactions were reported in the study, the incidence of vaccine reactions with Galaxy D is unknown because experience with repeated longterm use in ferrets has been limited. 64 Because of the possibility of vaccine-induced disease, especially in immunosuppressed or sick ferrets, do not use combination canine vaccines or vaccines of ferret cell or low-passage canine cell origin.",

Titers develop within 30 days of rabies vaccination. 55 In ferrets that were experimentally inoculated intramuscularly with skunk-origin rabies virus, the mean incubation period was 33 days and the mean morbidity period was 4 to 5 days. 42 Clinical signs were ascending paralysis, ataxia, cachexia, bladder atony, fever, hyperactivity, tremors, and paresthesia. Virus antigen was present in the brain tissue of all ferrets with clinical signs of rabies, and virus was isolated from the salivary gland of one ferret. In a similar study of ferrets inoculated with a raccoon rabies isolate, the mean incubation period was 28 days. Virus was isolated from the salivary glands of 63% of rabid ferrets, and 47% shed virus in saliva. Virus excretion began from 2 days before until 6 days after the onset of illness. 43 In an earlier study of ferrets with experimentally induced rabies, only mild clinical signs were observed before death. 7 Infected ferrets exhibited restlessness and apathy, and some showed paresis. Sick animals did not attempt to bite when threatened, and virus was not excreted in the submaxillary salivary glands of animals that died. In this study, the authors concluded that ferrets are 50,000 times less susceptible to rabies than fox and 300 times less susceptible than hares. In another study, ferrets that were fed up to 25 carcasses of mice infected with rabies did not develop the disease; in contrast, skunks become fatally infected after the consumption of only one carcass. 4 Ferrets are considered currently immunized 28 days after the initial rabies vaccination and immediately after a booster vaccination. 15 If a healthy pet ferret bites a person, current recommendations of the Compendium of Animal Rabies Prevention and Control are to confine and observe the animal for 10 days; the ferret should not be vaccinated during this period. 15 If signs of illness develop, this should be reported to the local health department and a veterinarian should evaluate the animal. If signs suggest rabies, the ferret must be euthanized and protocols for rabies evaluation should be followed. If a stray ferret bites a person, the ferret must be euthanized and submitted immediately for rabies testing. For a vaccinated ferret exposed to a possible rabid animal, recommendations are to revaccinate the ferret immediately and quarantine for 45 days. An unvaccinated animal that is exposed to a rabid animal should be euthanized immediately and submitted for rabies testing.

In a study of vaccine reactions in 3,857 ferrets, the incidence of adverse events associated with rabies vaccine alone, distemper vaccine alone, and rabies and distemper vaccines together were 0.51%, 1.0%, and 0.85%, respectively. The incidence of adverse events did not differ significantly among these three groups; however, the cumulative number of distemper vaccinations received was significantly associated with the occurrence of an adverse event. The distemper vaccines used in this population of ferrets were PureVax and Fervac D; however, the two distemper vaccines were grouped collectively in the analysis, and the incidence of adverse events associated with the individual distemper vaccines was not reported. Sex, age, and body weight were not associated with occurrence of an adverse event. All reactions occurred immediately after vaccination and most commonly consisted of vomiting and diarrhea. In another study of 143 ferrets, the incidence of adverse events after administering distemper (5.9%) (Fervac D), rabies (5.6%) (Imrab-3), or both vaccines (5.6%) was not significantly different. In a 2001 report of vaccine reactions in ferrets reported to the United States Pharmacopeia Veterinary Practitioners' Reporting Program, 65% (54 of 83) of reports involved administration of FerVac D; 24% (20 of 83) involved concomitant administration of FerVac D and Imrab; and 11% (9 of 83) involved administration of Imrab alone (PureVax was not approved for use at the time these data were collected). 37 According to Merial's product information, the incidence of vaccine reactions with PureVax is 0.3%. No data are available for products not licensed for use in ferrets. Veterinarians are not required to report vaccine-associated adverse events, and surveillance of these events is passive, relying on voluntary reporting by practitioners. 37 Vaccine-associated adverse events can be reported to the Center for Biologics, U.S. Department of Agriculture (1-800-752-6255; www.aphis. usda.gov/animal_health/vet_biologics/vb_adverse_event.shtml).",

The jugular vein can be approached in the neck by using the conventional technique used in cats, with the forelegs extended over the edge of a table and the neck extended up (Fig. 2-2) . Use a 25-gauge needle with a 1-to 3-mL syringe for venipuncture in most ferrets; a 22-gauge needle can be used in large males. Shave the neck at the venipuncture site to enhance visibility of the jugular vein. The vein is relatively superficial and is located more lateral in the neck than it is in dogs or cats, and it is sometimes difficult to locate in heavy males. Once the needle is inserted, the blood should flow easily into the syringe; if the neck is overextended and the head is arched back, the blood may not flow readily from the vein. Relax the hold on the head or gently \"pump\" the vein by moving the head slowly up and down to enhance blood flow into the syringe. With ferrets that resist limb extension, a towel-wrap technique can be used. 9 Scruff the ferret with its front legs extended caudally against the ventral thorax, and wrap the animal's body firmly with a towel from the base of the neck down. An assistant is needed to restrain the toweled ferret in dorsal recumbency while scruffing the cranial neck. Apply pressure lateral to the thoracic inlet to visualize or palpate the jugular vein lying between the thoracic inlet and the base of the ear. However, with very fractious animals, even this technique may be difficult without tranquilization.",

This technique is safe in ferrets because of the long anterior vena cava and the caudal location of the heart in the thoracic cavity, which is approximately 3 cm from the thoracic inlet. However, rare instances of hemorrhage into the anterior thoracic cavity can occur. Restrain the ferret on its back with the forelegs pulled caudally and the head and neck extended (Fig. 2-3, B) . In an unanesthetized ferret, two assistants are usually needed, one for restraint of the forelegs and head and the other for restraint of the rear just cranial to the pelvis. Insert a 25-gauge needle with an attached 1-mL or 3-mL syringe into the thoracic cavity between the first rib and the manubrium at an angle 30 to 45 degrees to the body. Direct the needle toward the opposite rear leg or most caudal rib and insert it almost to the hub. Pull back on the plunger as the needle is slowly withdrawn until blood begins to fill the syringe. If the ferret struggles, quickly withdraw the needle and wait until the ferret is quiet before making a second attempt.

            "text": "Pain management is important in the postoperative period, with diseases that create significant discomfort (such as gastrointestinal ulceration), and for traumatic injuries (see Chapter 31) . Ferrets in pain may exhibit tachypnea, a stiff gait, a strained facial expression, teeth grinding, shivering, half-closed eyelids, aggression, focal muscle fasciculations, hiding, general malaise, bristling of tail fur, and being \"tucked\" in the abdomen. 36, 62 Many analgesic agents are used effectively in ferrets, including opioids, alpha-2 agonists, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and local anesthetics. 26 Clinically, buprenorphine, butorphanol, and meloxicam are most commonly used for hospitalized animals and outpatients (see Chapter 31 and Appendix). For severe pain, combination therapy, such as with an opioid and an NSAID, may be most effective. 26 Epidural administration of analgesics preoperatively appears to be effective in helping to control postoperative pain in ferrets (see Chapter 31) . Epidural anesthesia and analgesia is most effective in procedures involving the abdomen, spine, pelvis, hind legs, tail, and perineum. 18 In a study of ferrets undergoing ovariohysterectomy and bilateral anal sacculectomy, both physiologic and behavioral manifestations of pain were attenuated in ferrets that received epidural morphine preoperatively compared with control ferrets, and beneficial effects were seen for at least 24 hours. 57 The technique has been well described and illustrated. 18, 23 Place the anesthetized ferret in sternal recumbency with the legs flexed to open the lumbosacral space. Clip a large rectangle of hair over the injection site (so that anatomic landmarks can easily be identified) and aseptically prepare the area. The injection site is at the intersection of a line drawn between the cranial aspect of the wings of the ilea and a line drawn between the dorsal spinous processes of the last lumber and first sacral (S1) vertebrae; the dorsal spinous process of S1 is easily palpable. Either a 22-gauge, 1.5-inch spinal needle or a 25-gauge hypodermic needle can be used, although a spinal needle will prevent creation of a skin plug that can obstruct the flow of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or set up a nidus for infection and inflammation. 18 Insert the needle on the midline perpendicular to the skin and with the bevel facing cranially. A correctly placed needle will drop through the lumbosacral space until it encounters bone on the ventral floor of the spinal canal. If using a spinal needle, remove the stylet and observe the needle hub for blood or CSF. Confirm correct epidural placement by attaching a 1-mL syringe containing 0.2 mL of sterile saline and 0.2 mL of air and applying gentle suction; no CSF or blood should be seen in the needle hub. No resistance should be encountered when the fluid is injected, and the air space above the fluid should not be compressed. Once correct epidural placement is confirmed, inject analgesic or anesthetic fluids slowly to avoid an increase in intracranial pressures or extended cranial infiltration of the anesthetic block. Morphine is often used for epidural analgesia at a dose of 0.1 mg/kg. 23 Epidural injection is contraindicated in cases of coagulopathy, sepsis, hypovolemia, skin infection, and local fractures. 18 Be careful in the immediate postoperative period when using drugs such as butorphanol, which can cause a pronounced sedative effect. Ferrets can remain very lethargic and immobile for long periods and can overheat quickly if a heating lamp or other strong heat source is used. Therefore closely monitor the body temperature of any immobile or lethargic ferret given pain medication to prevent overheating when using heat lamps or forced air warming devices. The frequent temperature spike described in ferrets 30 minutes or longer after surgery or sedation may be related to administration of various analgesics, similar to a syndrome seen in cats; however, responses in ferrets are inconsistent. 29 Like cats, ferrets are sensitive to acetaminophen toxicity. 16 The activity of UDP-glucuronosyltransferase in their livers is similar to that of cats. Therefore acetaminophen glucuronidation is slower in ferrets than in other non-felid species. Unlike cats, however, no genetic mutations are associated with this slow metabolism, and the exact cause is not known. When dosed inappropriately, ibuprofen can also be toxic in ferrets. 13 Therefore use any NSAIDs with caution. Do not use NSAIDs in ferrets already being treated with a corticosteroid for insulinoma or other disease.",

            "text": "In male ferrets, urethral blockage is a common sequela of adrenal disease. Androgens produced by the adrenal gland stimulate the prostate gland to enlarge, which subsequently constricts the urethra. Placing a urinary catheter is difficult because the urethral opening is very small and located on the ventral surface of the penis, below the J-hook in the end of the os penis. Also, in ferrets with urethral blockage, the tip of the penis and the preputial area are often very swollen, and introducing a catheter can be challenging. If needed, a small incision can be made in the prepuce to facilitate exteriorizing the penis. Surgical magnifying loupes may be helpful in locating the urethral orifice.",

If using a long rubber catheter, estimate the length of the catheter that must be inserted to reach the bladder before placing it. Use a stylet or flexible KE wire to stiffen the catheter while passing. Another option is to use a 20or 22-gauge, 8-inch jugular catheter with the stylet removed. 46 If needed, the stylet can be left in but retracted slightly to provide stiffness, but be very careful when rounding the pelvic flexure to avoid perforating the urethra. Use sterile technique to prepare the urethral and preputial area and pass the catheter. If the urethral opening is difficult to see, dilate the opening by passing a 24-gauge intravenous catheter just inside the tip of the urethra and flushing gently with saline. Then slip the tip of the lubricated urinary catheter gently into the dilated opening alongside the intravenous catheter and, while gently flushing with saline solution, pass the catheter into the bladder. Often resistance is met at the pelvic flexure; if this occurs, try repeated gentle flushing and relubricating the catheter until it passes. Once in place, secure the catheter by suturing the hub to the prepuce if using a Slippery Sam catheter. If using a rubber catheter, place butterfly tape strips around the catheter just as it enters the urethra and at another point 3 to 5 cm distal and suture these to the skin. Attach a sterile urinary collection device, and tape the tubing to the tail to further prevent tension. If needed, bandage the ferret's abdomen to minimize rotation of the catheter and to restrict the ferret from traumatizing it. Soft Elizabethan collars are needed in some ferrets to prevent chewing at the catheter. Maintain sterility of the collection system, and drain the bag by needle and syringe rather than opening the system (see also Chapter 4) .",

This is an important option in obstructed ferrets in which a urethral catheter cannot be passed and surgery is considered high risk because of the poor condition of the patient.

Alternatively, attach a 25-gauge needle to a 3-mL syringe and aspirate quickly after directing the needle into the spleen. A positive aspirate appears bloody. Detach the needle, fill the syringe with air, and express the samples onto slides. Obtain samples from two sites and prepare several slides for cytologic staining.

In one study using 10 healthy adult female ferrets to compare direct blood pressure measurement from the carotid artery to indirect blood pressure measurement from the tail and limbs using both Doppler and oscillometric methods, the indirect systolic blood pressure measurements were approximately 28 to 30 mm Hg less than the direct systolic blood pressures. Accurate indirect blood pressure readings were deemed very difficult to obtain because the neonatal blood pressure cuff did not fit securely on the short limbs of the ferrets (Doppler method) and the tail artery did not produce sufficiently high pressure changes to be detected by the oscillometric system. The authors concluded that indirect blood pressure assessment, using a sphygmomanometer and Doppler probe, could still be considered useful for evaluating changes in blood pressure from a known baseline or for surgical monitoring of general trends. 45 In another study using 14 male ferrets, indirect blood pressure measurements using an oscillometric sphygmomanometer and a veterinary high definition oscillometry monitor on the tail, forelimb, and hindlimb were compared with direct arterial blood pressure measurements. Measurements using the tail were considered most reliable; however, the oscillometric sphygmomanometer consistently overestimated the systolic arterial pressure. In addition, the indirect measurements of systolic, mean, and diastolic arterial pressures obtained with the highdefinition oscillometry monitor were consistently higher than the corresponding direct blood pressure measurements during hypotensive states but were substantially lower than the corresponding direct blood pressure measurements in hypertensive states. 56 Therefore, be aware of the above described inconsistencies of indirect methods when compared with results of direct blood pressure measurement, and interpret clinical results to measure trends more than for accurate measurements.",
