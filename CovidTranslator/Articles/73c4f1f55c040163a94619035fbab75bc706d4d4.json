Two BAstV serotypes were established based on the results of a virus neutralization assay [18] . The genomic characterization and sequence analysis of astroviruses in bovine fecal specimens collected in Hong Kong provides evidence of potential recombination in ORF2 [19] . Recently, the complete genome of a novel BAstV associated with neurological disease in cattle was sequenced, i.e., BoAstV-NeuroS1, which was phylogenetically related to an ovine astrovirus (OAstV). A previous study suggested that BoAstV-NeruoS1 infection was a potential cause of neurological disease in cattle [20] . However, genetically diverse lineages of BAstVs have not been identified in many countries because there have been few studies of astroviruses derived from cattle. Thus, the present study investigated the genetic groupings of Korean BAstVs and examined their relationships with the age of cattle infected with BAstVs.",

The cattle comprised 84 Korean cattle and 31 Holstein cattle. Nonambulatory cattle which are commonly referred to as ''downer'' cattle are unable to stand or walk. Cattle brain tissue samples with a histopathological diagnosis of encephalitis were also collected from 14 downer cattle between 2010 and 2012.

Products with the expected size were cloned using the pGEM-T Vector System II TM (Promega, Cat. No. A3610, USA). The cloned gene was sequenced with T7 and SP6 sequencing primers using an ABI Prism \u00d2 3730XI DNA Sequencer at the Macrogen Institute (Macrogen Co. Ltd).

All of the astrovirus sequences were aligned using the CLUSTAL X alignment program [27] . The nucleotide sequences were translated and the shared nucleotide and amino acid sequence identities among the astrovirus strains were calculated using BIOEDIT 7.053 [28] . The analysis of the diversity of BAstVs in the present study identified four Table) . Bayesian trees were generated with MrBayes 3.1.2 [29, 30] using best-fit models, which were selected with MrModeltest 3.7 [31] for nucleotide sequences and ProtTest 1.4 [32] for amino acid sequences. Markov Chain Monte Carlo analyses were run using 2,000,000 generations for each nucleotide and amino acid sequence. The best-fit model of the ORF1ab nucleotide sequence selected by MrModeltest 3.7 software was TrNef?G, according to the results of a hierarchical likelihood ratio test. The likelihood parameter was set to nst = 6 and rate = gamma for the datasets, and the gamma distribution shape parameter was 0.5612. The substitution model Rmat was 1. and -2 [19] . Recently, the BoAstV-NeuroS1 strain was detected in the brain tissues of cattle and the analysis of its genetic diversity showed that it was most closely related to the OAstV prototype, which was identified in 1977 [3] , whereas it was phylogenetically distant from a recently reported OAstV [33] and the Hong Kong BAstVs [20] . This suggests the occurrence of multiple cross-species transmission events among hosts and other animal species.",
