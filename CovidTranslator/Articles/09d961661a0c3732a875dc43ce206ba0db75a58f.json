            "text": "Compounds containing a trifluoromethyl ketone (CF 3ketone) moiety form an important group of biologically useful fluorinated molecules 6 that can be used as protease inhibitors, as first described by Abeles et al. 7 The CF 3 group next to the carbonyl group thermodynamically stabilizes the hemi-ketal form relative to the ketone form, thus making the carbonyl prone to nucleophilic substitution by water, the active site Ser hydroxyl or Cys thiol group present in serine or cysteine proteases. Nucleophilic attack by the active site thiol in SARS-CoV 3CL pro would convert the CF 3 -ketone A to the tetrahedral adduct B (Scheme 1), which is believed to mimic the substrate-enzyme intermediate formed during substrate peptide-bond hydrolysis. Since adduct B is relatively stable, compound A would behave as a protease inhibitor, 8 suggesting that compounds containing a CF 3 -ketone moiety may play an important role as 3CL pro inhibitors. CF 3 -ketone A also forms a relatively stable hydrate adduct C upon reacting with water. A unique and conservative recognition of the substrate's Gln residue at the P 1 site has been identified in the CoV cysteine protease family. 9 Therefore, a Gln-derived CF 3 -ketone residue would contribute to the activity of SARS-CoV 3CL pro inhibitors. Based on these considerations, a new synthetic method for forming Gln and Glu derivatives possessing a CF 3 -ketone moiety was developed and this strategy was used in the synthesis of four peptides (compounds [1] [2] [3] [4] Keywords: Trifluoromethyl ketone; Protease inhibitors; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus protease (SARS-CoV 3CL pro ).",

            "text": "The target compounds were envisioned being synthesized in two parts, viz, the peptide part and b-amino alcohol 11 containing the CF 3 unit. These two parts would then be coupled together and further elaborated to the desired target compounds. The synthesis of the key compound 11 started with oxazolidinone acid 6 prepared from Cbz-L-Glu-OH (5) under conditions described by Moore et al. 10 The resulting acid 6 was then converted to tert-butyl ester 7 (45%) that was expediently converted to silyl ether 8 (92% yield) (Scheme 2), which was isolated as a single diastereomer as determined by 1 H and 13 C NMR analyses, by utilizing a literature method. 11, 12 The depicted stereochemistry for compound 8 is based on literature precedence for a very similar compound in which the addition of the CF 3 anion is anti to the side chain. 11 Product 8 was then readily desilylated upon treatment with tetrabutylammonium fluoride (TBAF) giving alcohol 9 in 77% yield. We observed that compound 8 was partly converted to the desilylated product 9 when exposed to air. The cause of the partial protio-desilylation might be due to the moisture-sensitive nature of compound 8. In the patent literature, there is one report of desilylation occurring upon stirring similar compounds in methanol, 13 most likely caused by water present in the methanol. For our substrate, we found that this method only proceeded when the reaction was carried out on a small scale (20 mg or less). However, by adding water to the methanol [methanol/water (9:1 v/v)], substrate 8 could be fully converted to compound 9 after 3 h stirring at room temperature (Scheme 2).",

Finally, the desired alcohol 10 was obtained by treating compound 9 with NaBH 4 in methanol at room temperature. This gave target compound 10 as a ca. 4.5:1 mixture of diastereomers, as determined by 1 H and 13 C NMR analyses, in 69% yield. Among the different synthetic routes tried, treating a methanol solution of silyl ether 8 with NaBH 4 seems to be an efficient route to synthesize alcohol 10. Under these conditions, we obtained the desired compound 10 in 68% yield (Scheme 2). Finally, the protecting group within substrate 10 could be easily cleaved off by hydrogenation over Pd/C (10%) affording alcohol 11 in quantitative yield. Coupling of peptide 12 with b-amino alcohol 11 gave the expected amide (Scheme 4) that was used directly in the next step affording ketone 16. Peptides 14 and 15 were subjected to the exactly same reaction sequences giving ketones 17 and 18. Treating compound 16 with trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) resulted in clean removal of the tert-butyl group forming tripeptide 1. Examination of the 13 C NMR spectrum did reveal that inhibitor 1 exists predominantly as the hydrate form in CDCl 3 (containing one drop of DMSO-d 6 ). 19 F NMR analysis of the same sample not only showed that the hydrate form was the dominant tautomer in the sample but that the two other possible tautomeric forms of tripeptide 1 were also present in small amount. 17 The equilibrium between the different tautomeric forms of this compound might shift depending on solvent. Due to the small amount of compound available, it was decided to study this in more detail by using a simpler model compound (vide infra).",

The low chemical yield for the target compounds is a result of the last reaction sequence that seems to be very inefficient giving rise to many side products. In an effort to improve the yield for the last step, compound 4 was prepared by a mixed anhydride strategy using a slightly modified literature procedure (Method B). 18 By such means, we were able to improve the overall yield of inhibitor 4, from peptide 14, from 4 to 12%. 19 F NMR studies of the three glutamine peptides showed that compounds 2 and 4 only existed in the cyclic form while tripeptide 3 was a ca. 3.3:1 mixture of the cyclic and keto forms in CDCl 3 . 19 Recently, similar observations were reported for glutamine fluoromethyl ketones by Cai et al. 20 Previously, there have also been reports that glutaminal compounds mostly exist as the hemiaminal in organic solvent. 21,22",
