Two of them, 6E7 and 3D1, identified as IgG1/k, could react with chb2M protein from avian macrophage HD11 cells and human 293T cells transfected with pcDNA3.1-chb2M in immunofluorescence assays. Only a 12 kDa protein band of chb2M could be detected in the HD11 and 293T/chb2M cell lysates by Western blot analysis. Chicken b2M in serum and plasma could be found in Western blot by MAb 3D1. Moreover, MAb 3D1 also recognized the chb2M antigen on the cell membranes in flow cytometry. Immunohistochemical staining with these MAbs revealed that chb2M was present in chicken thymus, spleen, and bursa. These MAbs will be good tools for analyzing the mechanism of the chicken immune system.",

(1) The function of b2M is interacting with and stabilizing the tertiary structure of the MHC class I a-chain to present antigenic peptides to cytotoxic (CD8 + ) T lymphocytes. (2) In addition, b2M is extensively involved in the functional regulation of survival, proliferation, apoptosis, and even metastasis of cancer cells. (3, 4) Recent studies showed that antibodies against b2M were highly cytotoxic against some solid (5) or liquid tumors. (3, 6) However, there are only a few reports focusing on chicken b2-microglobulin (chb2M).

It consists of 360 bp encoding 119 amino acids (aa) with a molecular weight of 12 kDa (Fig.  1 ). There are two conserved cysteines at positions 45 and 100. The immunoglobulin (Ig) motif YXCXVXH (X indicates any amino acid) were located at positions 98 to 104. Chb2M showed 94.1% amino acid homology to the turkey b2M gene (B53282) with only seven amino acid substitutions at positions 81, 86, 95, 96, 97, 99, and 103. There is a relatively low homology of 65.9% between duck b2M and chicken b2M. Multiple sequence alignment showed that chb2M shared only 44.2% and 42.5% amino acid identity with human and mouse b2M, respectively. Most of the amino acid substitutions were focused on the signal peptide domain and the C terminus, which suggest that the C-terminus' amino acids are specific to chb2M.

It suggests TF29 is a better immunogen than chicken PBMC. The MAbs 6E7 and 3D1 are specific to the chb2M and no cross-reaction with human b2M. Moreover, despite previous suggestions that b2M was relatively conserved between the different poultry species, we found that antibody 6E7 and 3D1 could not react with duck serum b2M. During the last several years, the two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) structures of chb2M and MHC class I proteins have been frequently discussed. As originally noted, (8) chb2M contains a typical b-sheet with no a-helix. Although the 20 amino acid residues of the C-terminus of chb2M consist of two discontinuous b-sheets, they may be freely exposed to the external environment. (18) In our study, MAbs 6E7 and 3D1 could react both with the linear chb2M antigen in Western blot and the native chb2M antigen in flow cytometry. It suggests that antibody recognition of the chb2M antigen at C-terminal acid residues should be less influenced by MHC 1 conformation.",
