This method has been widely used to define memory T cells in many organs and tissues, including lungs, spleens and intestines. However, memory T cells in the respiratory tract are located in three unique anatomic locations, i.e., airway, parenchyma and pulmonary vasculature. Intravascular staining cannot distinguish cells in the airway and parenchyma, since they are both isolated from the circulation and intravascularly-administered antibodies will not stain these two populations. We designed a simultaneous intranasal/intravascular antibody labeling assay that can label and distinguish cells in all three locations using minimal amount of antibodies.",
