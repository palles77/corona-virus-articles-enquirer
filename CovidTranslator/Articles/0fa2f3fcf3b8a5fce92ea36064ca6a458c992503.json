Both viruses are reassortants with internal genes derived from avian infl uenza A H9N2 viruses that circulate in Asian poultry. Both viruses have genetic markers of mammalian adaptation in their haemagglutinin and polymerase PB2 subunits, which enhanced binding to human-type receptors and improved replication in mammals, respectively. Hong Kong (aff ected by H5N1 in 1997) and Shanghai (aff ected by H7N9 in 2013) are two rapidly fl ourishing cosmopolitan megacities that were increasing in human population and poultry consumption before the outbreaks. Both cities are located along the avian migratory route at the Pearl River delta and Yangtze River delta. Whether the widespread use of the H5N1 vaccine in east Asia-with suboptimum biosecurity measures in live poultry markets and farms-predisposed to the emergence of H7N9 or other virus subtypes needs further investigation. Why H7N9 seems to be more readily transmitted from poultry to people than H5N1 is still unclear.",

            "text": "The infl uenza viruses belong to the RNA virus family Orthomyxoviridae. On the basis of antigenic and genetic diff erences between the internal proteins, nucleoprotein and matrix protein, infl uenza viruses are classifi ed into A, B, and C. The infl uenza A virus has a negative-sense, single-stranded, and eight-segmented genome. On the basis of two surface proteins, 17 haemagglutinin subtypes and ten neuraminidase subtypes can be found (fi gure 2). 19 Except H17 and N10, which have been found in bats only, all haemagglutinin and neuraminidase subtypes have been found in wild waterfowl. 20 Unlike other neuraminidase subtypes, N10 does not have neuraminidase activity. 21 The 17 haemagglutinin subtypes are further classifi ed into group 1 and group 2 on the basis of the antigenic and phylogenetic characteristics of haem agglutinin. The HA1 subunit of the haemagglutinin attaches onto host cell sialic acid receptor. The haemagglutinin precursor protein HA0 is cleaved by proteases into HA1 and HA2 before HA2 can mediate virion-cell fusion. The internal proteins are encoded by six other gene segments encoding nucleoprotein NP, matrix protein M1, ion channel protein M2, the polymerase complex proteins PB1, PB2, PA, including PB1-F2, PA-X, PA-N155, PA-N182, and non-structural proteins including PB1-F2, PA-X, PA-N155, PA-N182, NS1, and NS2. 19, 22 The eight gene segments can reassort when two diff erent viruses infect an animal host cell. Phylogenetic analysis shows that the 1997 H5N1 virus infecting human beings was a reassortant with goose H5N1 haemagglutinin, teal H6N1 neuraminidase, and internal genes from quail H9N2 and teal H6N1. 23, 24 The 2003 H7N7 virus that infected human beings in the Netherlands was a reassortant between avian infl uenza A H7N3, infl uenza A H10N7, and other Eurasian avian infl uenza viruses (fi gure 3). 9 On the basis of available sequences in the public domain, the 2013 H7N9 virus is also a reassortant of avian infl uenza viruses consisting of haemagglutinin and neuraminidase most closely related to H7N3 viruses isolated from ducks in Zhejiang and H7N9 viruses from wild birds in Korea, respectively. The M, NP, and NS genes are most closely related to H9N2 viruses from chickens in eastern China, whereas Personal View the PA, PB1, and PB2 genes are most closely related to those of H9N2 viruses from brambling in Beijing. 11, 12, 13, 25, 26 Because the origin of all gene segments of the 2013 H7N9 virus are avian, gene reassortment probably took place in an avian host. Although reassortment events of avian infl uenza viruses have been recorded in pigs in Korea, 27 the 2013 H7N9 virus and the immediate precursors have not been found in pigs. 28 The haemagglutinin sequence of one of the 2013 H7N9 virus human isolates (A/Shanghai/1/2013) was phylogenetically distinct from other human and avian isolates, 12, 29 suggesting that this new reassortant might have been circulating for some time to achieve this degree of diversity. Because of the roughly 5% nucleotide diff erences in the H7 and N9 genes between the 2013 H7N9 virus and the closest avian virus genes, more extensive virological surveillance of wild or domestic avian and non-avian animal species, as has been done for the Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, 30 is needed to understand the evolutionary pathway of this H7N9 virus, which is the fi rst N9 subtype virus infecting human beings. Up to now, only one wild pigeon from Nanjing has tested positive for the 2013 H7N9 virus, 31 but the epidemiological and genomic details of this virus isolate are not yet available.",

            "text": "One unique feature of the 2013 H7N9 human epidemic is the absence of preceding die-off s in poultry or wild birds, which makes epidemiological control diffi cult. The start of the H5N1 outbreak in 1997 was marked by three highly pathogenic avian infl uenza virus outbreaks on farms 1 month before the fi rst human case and about 32 Avian infl uenza virus can be divided into highly pathogenic avian infl uenza virus and low pathogenic avian infl uenza virus on the basis of pathogenicity in chickens. The World Organization for Animal Health has defi ned highly pathogenic avian infl uenza virus as any infl uenza virus that is lethal for six or more of eight 4-8-week-old susceptible chickens by 10 days after intravenous inoculation with 0\u00b72 mL of a 1/10 dilution of a bacteriafree infective allantoic fl uid, or that has an intravenous pathogenicity index of greater than 1\u00b72, which is calculated by scores on the severity of illness. 33 One key feature of highly pathogenic avian infl uenza virus is the presence of multibasic aminoacids at the haemagglutinin cleavage site, which render haemagglutinin susceptible to cleavage by many diff erent proteases. 34 Hence, H5 or H7 viruses that have low pathogenicity in chickens are still regarded as highly pathogenic avian infl uenza virus if their HA0 cleavage sequence is similar to that of other highly pathogenic avian infl uenza viruses. The haemagglutinin cleavage site from all reported 2013 H7N9 viruses do not possess multibasic aminoacids. 11, 12, 35 Data from preliminary pathogenicity testing suggest that chickens and quails infected with H7N9 do not show signs of illness. 36 A low pathogenic avian infl uenza virus can mutate to become highly pathogenic during an outbreak in domestic poultry. For the H7N3 virus outbreaks in 2002 and 2004, the diff erence in the cleavage site between low pathogenic avian infl uenza virus and highly pathogenic avian infl uenza virus was speculated to be a sequence insertion from the neuraminidase or M gene at the haemagglutinin cleavage site through intersegmental recombination. 37 Close monitoring of the evolution of the 2013 H7N9 is needed. Another possible explanation for the apparent absence of a preceding infection with H7N9 in poultry in the 2013 outbreak is that previous infection by a closely related low pathogenic avian infl uenza H7 virus elicited crossprotection for this H7N9 virus because H7N3 virus was recently reported in ducks in Zhejiang, China. 38 Furthermore, prevalent H9N2 infections in poultry or the extensive use of the H5N1 vaccine in poultry in China might induce cell-mediated immunity against highly conserved internal viral proteins without inducing any neutralising antibody. This process might be suffi cient to militate against poultry death, but not asymptomatic viral shedding. 39 The eff ect of previous infection by other avian infl uenza virus subtypes and previous H5N1 vaccine on the susceptibility to infection by H7N9 deserves further investigation.",

H5N1 viruses can invade the lower respiratory tract of human beings because the viruses retain strong affi nity for the \u03b1-2,3-linked receptors present in the lower respiratory tract of human beings. 41 An increased affi nity for the \u03b1-2,6-linked receptors, which are abundant in the upper respiratory tract of human beings, is believed to be responsible for transmission between birds and human beings. In Egypt, which has had the highest number of H5N1 infections since 2009, 99% of virus isolates had a Thr160Ala (H3 numbering) mutation, which is associated with loss of glycosylation at position 158-160, and increased transmissibility in ferrets and guinea pigs. 42, 43 Thr160Ala was also present in all reported strains of 2013 H7N9 (table 2). The haemagglutinin mutations Gly186Val and Gln226Leu, which increase the binding of H5N1 and H7 viruses to \u03b1-2,6-linked receptor and H5N1 virus transmission between ferrets, are present in most strains of the human and avian 2013 H7N9, but none of the 1997 H5N1 strains (table 2). 11,12,35,45-47 However, a recent structural modelling and binding study with human tracheal epithelium and ",

However, Glu627Lys was specifi cally found in the Qinghai outbreak of H5N1 in 2005. 52 PB2 Asp701Asn is another important mutation associated with mammalian adaptation and transmission. 42, 53 Notably, most virus isolates from individuals infected with 2013 H7N9 had either Glu627Lys or Asp701Asn, but not both. Asp701Asn can compensate for the lack of Glu627Lys for transmission between guinea pigs. 53 Other mutations aff ect viral replication, transmission, and virulence of infl uenza viruses. NS1 protein is the key virulence factor counteracting innate host immunity. NS1 protein contains a four-aminoacid motif at the C terminal that disrupts cellular signalling by binding to the host PDZ domain-containing proteins. Recombinant infl uenza virus with PDZ-binding motif has increased pathogenicity in mice. 54 NS1 protein from human seasonal infl uenza viruses cannot bind to human proteins containing PDZ domain. 55 The NS1 of all 2013 H7N9 strains has a deletion of the PDZ motif. The structural M1 protein is needed for viral assembly and budding. Two mutations in M1, Asn30Asp and Thr215Ala, associated with increased virulence in a mice model, are found in all strains of the 2013 H7N9 virus. 56",

First, H7N9 infection in children was mainly mild or asymptomatic (appendix); 14,79,80 therefore, infection in this age group might have been underdiagnosed because confi rmatory laboratory tests were usually reserved for severe cases. Two children were found to be infected with H7N9 during an enhanced surveillance that included 6333 children younger than 4 years of age with infl uenza-like illness. 79 Second, some adult patients were poultry workers; generally only adults go to live poultry markets and therefore adults might have had a greater dose or prolonged duration of exposure to H7N9 than did children. Additionally, adults might have an increased chance of exposure to pet birds. Finally, older adults might have impaired development of specifi c immune response to the H7N9 virus because of the immunological phenomenon of original antigenic sin. 81 ",

One explanation for this fi nding could be that most grandmothers in Shanghai take care of their grandchildren at home while the retired grandfathers go to live poultry markets for grocery shopping every day. 87 Another unique feature is that no poultry workers were infected with H5N1 in the Hong Kong epidemic.

Slaughtering and preparation of infected poultry constitute the highest risks of exposure to infected poultry secretions and excreta. Although transmission to human beings through contact with wild birds or consumption of inadequately cooked poultry is possible, documentation of such occurrences is scarce even though H7 viruses are able to survive and remain infective for a prolonged period. 90 No defi nitive evidence of continuing person-to-person transmission exists, although some fi rst-generation transmission might have occurred in four case clusters of which three were familial clusters. 14,91 However, exposure to a common avian or environmental source could not be excluded in these clusters. Few reports of person-to-person trans mission of H5N1 have been recorded. 92 The predilection of the 2013 H7N9 virus for the lower respiratory tract-shown by the higher virus burden in patients sputum than throat swab-might explain the low number of person-to-person transmissions as in the case of H5N1. 132 reported H7N9 infections in patients from March to May 2013 has far exceeded the 45 reported H5N1 infections in China within the past 10 years. 61 The crude case fatality of 2013 H7N9 infection is 30%, which is lower than that for H5N1 infection (60%), but much higher than the 0\u00b71% of the 2009 pandemic or seasonal infl uenza. 3, 19 The true case fatality rate is uncertain because many of the patients are still receiving care in the intensive care units. Enhanced surveillance between March 7 and April 28, 2013, in which 20 739 patients with infl uenza-like illness were tested, identifi ed only two patients with H7N9 who were not hospitalised. 79",

In an analysis of 111 of 132 reported cases of human H7N9 infections in 2013, more than 90% of patients had fever or cough, and 24% of the 111 patients had haemoptysis. 15 71% of the patients had acute respiratory distress syndrome. Other complications associated with H7N9 infection are rhabdomyolysis, acute kidney injury, encephalopathy, and multiorgan dysfunction. 11, 15 Unlike the 1997 H5N1 outbreak, in which nearly 40% of patients had only fever and upper respiratory tract symptoms, none of the 111 patients with 2013 H7N9 infection had sore throat, rhinorrhoea, or conjunctivitis, although mild rhinorrhoea was reported in a 3\u00b75-year-old boy. 80 Gastrointestinal symptoms (13\u00b75%) were less common in people infected with H7N9 than in those with the 1997 H5N1 infection (50%). 1,15 Reye's syndrome was reported in a child with 1997 H5N1 infection. 1 Gastro intestinal haemorrhage, reactive haemo phagocytosis, and haemorrhagic pleural eff usion, which were present in some cases of 1997 H5N1, have not been reported for H7N9 infection. Coinfection at presentation or during admission to hospital can occur, as reported for H5N1. 2, 15, 98 Laboratory abnormalities in patients with either infections were prominent lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, coagulo pathy, and raised serum transaminase, creatine kinase, and C-reactive protein concentrations. Radio logical features were similar in both infections: pulmonary consolidation (which progressed to involve bilateral lung fi elds), diff use ground glass opacities, pleural eff usions, and mediastinal emphysema. None of these clinical, laboratory, and radiological manifestations are pathognomonic for H7N9 infections. The defi nitive diagnosis depends on viral culture or real-time-PCR (RT-PCR) for the H7 and N9 gene targets from respiratory tract secretions. Because of the predilection of this virus for the lower respiratory tract, if available, sputum, endotracheal aspirate or bronchoalveolar lavage might give a better sensitivity than throat or nasopharyngeal specimens. However, point-of-care rapid antigen tests and multiplex RT-PCR assays have low sensitivity. 99 Acute and convalescent serum antibody testing by haemagglutination inhibition or neutralisation can be useful for epidemiology or retrospective diagnosis. Any febrile patients with history of travel to aff ected areas, or contact with poultry or infected patients can be tested for H7N9 as a screening strategy for the early identifi cation of imported cases.",

To interrupt the amplifi cation of infl uenza virus, a monthly rest day with no live poultry allowed in the wet market was implemented in Hong Kong in July 2001. The isolation rate of H9N2 from poultry in live markets before the rest day could be as high as 10%, but reduced to less than 1% after the rest day. 117 To further reduce the spread of infl uenza virus in wet markets, overnight poultry storage was banned in July 2008. 118 A further 84% reduction in the isolation rate of H9N2 was reported. As in the H5N1 outbreak, poultry vaccination specifi cally against the H7N9 virus could probably reduce its transmission. A mathematical model showed that poultry vaccination with a matched H5N1 vaccine with coverage of only 30% of the poultry reduces the basic reproductive number to less than one. 117 The 1997 H5N1 human outbreak was stopped after a cull of all poultry in Hong Kong. 117 Subsequently, only registered farms with stringent biosecurity measures in China can import chickens to Hong Kong. If a highly pathogenic avian infl uenza virus outbreak arose, all live poultry and poultry products from the aff ected province would be suspended for up to 21 days. For unaff ected farms within 3 km of the index farm aff ected by the highly pathogenic avian infl uenza virus, there would be a 90 day suspension for live poultry and poultry products. For farms where 2013 H7N9 is detected by virological testing, similar depopulation and perimetric moratorium strategies of poultry control are necessary to control the source.",

Public education and administrative measures have also led to a slow change in eating habits from live chicken to chilled or frozen chicken. To reduce the contact between human beings and poultry in Hong Kong, the Hong Kong Government implemented a voluntary surrender scheme in 2004, and subsequently a buyout scheme in 2008 for poultry retailers, wholesalers, transporters, and farmers. In 2006, domestic households were prohibited to keep any live poultry. With these measures, between 1997 and 2013, the number of local poultry farms in Hong Kong decreased from about 800 to 30 and the number of retail poultry stalls decreased from about 800 to 131. Since 1997, the number of imported live chickens was reduced from about 100 000 per day to 7000 per day. Enhanced surveillance of H5N1 and H7N9 in both live and dead wild birds, farm, and market poultries might be important for geographical areas along the migratory route of wild birds. With these measures, no local cases of H5N1 in Hong Kong have been identifi ed since 2007, despite the failure to implement central slaughtering because of cultural resistance.",

The rapid increase in human beings infected with severe H7N9 to more than 130 cases within 2 months from March to May, 2013, is unprecedented for avian infl uenza viruses and could be related to enhanced transmissibility from poultry to human or improved virological testing. However, H7N9 is diffi cult to control because fl ock die-off did not precede human cases. Stringent measures to control the poultry outbreak will stop the human epidemic and perhaps decrease the risk of H7N9 evolving to become a pandemic agent.",

Biosecurity measures for live poultry markets, farms, and traffi cking should be commensurate with increasing demand for poultry.
