The reports of its personto-person transmission through close contacts have raised a global concern about its pandemic potential. Here we characterize the six-helix bundle fusion core structure of MERS-CoV spike protein S2 subunit by X-ray crystallography and biophysical analysis. We find that two peptides, HR1P and HR2P, spanning residues 998-1039 in HR1 and 1251-1286 in HR2 domains, respectively, can form a stable six-helix bundle fusion core structure, suggesting that MERS-CoV enters into the host cell mainly through membrane fusion mechanism. HR2P can effectively inhibit MERS-CoV replication and its spike protein-mediated cell-cell fusion. Introduction of hydrophilic residues into HR2P results in significant improvement of its stability, solubility and antiviral activity. Therefore, the HR2P analogues have good potential to be further developed into effective viral fusion inhibitors for treating MERS-CoV infection.",

In 2012, another novel coronavirus, termed Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), emerged in the Middle East 3 . MERS-CoV infection results in SARS-like disease with multiorgan failure 4 . As of 11 November 2013, WHO had been informed of 153 confirmed cases, including 64 deaths (a case fatality rate of 42%) 5 . The reports of clusters that have occurred among family contacts or in health-care settings have indicated its person-to-person transmissibility through close contacts, raising concerns over its pandemic potential 3,6-8 .

We hypothesized that the S2 subunit of MERS-CoV would then change conformation by inserting its fusion peptide into the target cell membrane, forming a six-bundle (6-HB) fusion core between the heptad repeat 1 and 2 (HR1 and HR2) domains in the S2 subunit, thus bringing the viral and cell membranes into close apposition to facilitate fusion, and, in turn, releasing the viral genetic materials into the cytoplasm 19, 20 . If this hypothesis is proven, then the HR1 in the 6-HB could serve as a target for developing MERS-CoV fusion inhibitors, like those against HIV infection, such as the peptides SJ-2176 and T20 (enfuvirtide) 21-23 .",

Here we further compared the 6-HB core structures of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV with those of MHV and hCoV-NL63 since the fusion core structures of hCoV-229E and TGEV are not available in PDB. The fusion core of MERS-CoV adopts a similar fold as that of SARS-CoV (Fig. 2d ), but it is different from those of MHV and hCoV-NL63 (Fig. 3) . In the MHV structure, a single-turn a-helix could be observed in the N-terminal region of HR2, which could not be found in MERS-CoV and other coronaviruses. In the hCoV-NL63 structure, the HR2 segment forms regular helices packing against the central HR1 core, especially in the C-terminal region of HR2, which is quite different from the HR2 of MERS-CoV. In contrast, the 6-HB core structure of MERS-CoV S protein could be superimposed on that of SARS-CoV S protein with a root mean square deviation of 0.61 \u00c5 for the 63 Ca atoms of three HR1 helices (Fig. 2d) . Besides the HR2 helices, the N-and C-terminal tail regions of HR2 share similar conformations between MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, indicating that the tail regions interact with the hydrophobic grooves in a conserved manner in addition to the highly conserved 6-HB.",

Since native polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis (N-PAGE) is under nondenaturing conditions and has been successfully used for testing the formation of 6-HB core structures in other class 1 fusion proteins 20,33,34 , we used N-PAGE to investigate whether HR1P could interact with HR2P to form 6-HB. Similar to the HR1 peptides from SARS-CoV S protein and HIV-1 gp41 20,33,34 , HR1P alone showed no band in the gel (lane 1, Fig. 4a and Supplementary Fig. 9a ) since it carries net positive charges and thus moves up and off the gel under the native electrophoresis condition. HR2P alone exhibited a band at the lower position in the gel (lane 2, Fig. 4a and Supplementary Fig. 9a ), while the mixture of HR1P/HR2P showed a new band at the upper position in the gel (lane 3, Fig. 4a and Supplementary Fig. 9a The corresponding sequences of the HR1 and HR2 domains and the designed peptides (HR1L, HR1M, and HR1S, HR2L, HR2M, and HR2S) are shown in the diagram.

It was reported that the 6-HB complexes formed by HR1 and HR2 of MHV-A59 and SARS-CoV are stable under SDS-PAGE condition without heating the samples at 100\u00b0C before loading 35 . Accordingly, we analysed the HR1P and HR2P peptides, as well as their mixture, using 15% SDS polyacrylamide protein gel (NEXT GEL, Amersco). The result showed that HR1P and HR2P migrated in the gel to a location corresponding to a molecular weight of 3-4 kDa, while the HR1P/ HR2P complex migrated to a position corresponding to a molecular mass of B26 kDa. The theoretical mass of the 6-HB formed by HR1P and HR2P is 25.8 kDa ( Fig. 4b and Supplementary Fig. 9b ). These results therefore suggest that HR1P could interact with HR2P to form a 6-HB.",

The HR1P peptide contains 42 amino acids, a length similar to HR2P. HR1P lacks anti-MERS-CoV activity (Fig. 6) , possibly because it is too short. Therefore, we synthesized a medium long peptide, HR1M (56-mer: residues 984-1,039), and expressed a long peptide, HR1L (79-mer: residues 984-1,062). We also synthesized a longer HR2 peptide, HR2L (45-mer: residues 1,245-1,289) and a shorter HR2 peptide HR2S (19-mer: residues 1,262-1,280) (Fig. 1a) . By comparing the secondary structures of these individual peptides, we found that the 79-mer HR1L peptide formed ahelical structure with 34.5% helicity, while neither the 56-mer HR1M nor the 42-mer HR1P could form a-helical structure ( Supplementary Fig. 3a) . Interestingly, the 36-mer HR2P peptide was in a-helical conformation with 18.5% helicity, while both the 45-mer HR2L peptide and the 19-mer HR2S peptide exhibited random structure in PBS ( Supplementary Fig. 3b) .

Notably, the Tm values of the HR1L/HR2L complex (499\u00b0C), HR1L/HR2P complex (499\u00b0C) and HR1M/HR2P complex (98\u00b0C) were higher than that of HR1P/HR2P complex (87\u00b0C), while the Tm values of the above complexes were significantly higher than that of the HR1L/HR2S complex (57.5\u00b0C) ( Table 1 ), confirming that the longer peptides generally form more stable fusion core than the shorter peptides 38, 39 . These results suggest that both HR2L and HR2P peptides are long enough to form 6-HB coiled coil structure with all three HR1 peptides, while HR1S peptide is too short to form the typical fusion core structure with HR1 peptides.",

To increase the stability, solubility and antiviral activity of the HIV-1 gp41 HR1 peptide C34, it was mutated by introducing Glu (E) and Lys (K) residues at the i to i \u00fe 4 or i to i \u00fe 3 arrangements. Using a similar approach, we introduced two point mutations into HR2P-M1 peptide, including T1263E (e) and L1267R (b), and 7 point mutations into HR2P-M2 peptide, including T1263E (e), L1267K (b), S1268K (c), Q1270E (e), Q1271E (f), A1275K (c) and N1277E (e). Based on the crystal structure of MERS-CoV fusion core (Fig. 2) , none of these mutations was expected to block interaction between HR1 and HR2, since the mutated residues were not located at the a and d positions in the helical wheel of HR2 (Fig. 1c) . It was expected that these mutations would lead to formation of E-K, K-E or E-R salt-bridge at the i to i \u00fe 4 arrangements, such as 1263E-1267K in HR2P-M1, and 1263E-1267K and 1271E-1275K in HR2P-M2, as well as formation of E-K, K-E or E-R salt-bridge at i to i \u00fe 3 arrangements, such as 1265E-1268K and 1274K-1277E in HR2P-M2. Other introduced E or K mutations were expected to increase hydrophilicity, thus enhancing the water solubility.",

The solubility of HR2P-M1 and HR2P-M2 in H 2 O was increased by B68-fold and 1,786-fold, respectively, while their inhibitory activity on MERS-CoV S-mediated cell-cell fusion was increased by B9 and 69%, respectively ( Table 2 ).

            "text": "One may question why the peptide derived from the HR2 domain of MERS-CoV S protein is more effective in inhibiting MERS-CoV infection than the HR2 peptide SC-1 in protecting against SARS-CoV infection. One of the explanations is that like HIV-1, MERS-CoV enters the host cell primarily through plasma membrane fusion, while SARS-CoV gets into its target cells perhaps mainly via endosomal membrane fusion. Chan et al. 37 have observed that syncytial formation is very prominent in MERS-CoV-infected cell cultures, while it was not found in SARS-CoV-infected cell cultures. In this study, the co-culture of 293T cells expressing MERS-CoV S protein and Huh-7 cells carrying DPP4 exhibited significant cell-cell fusion and syncytial formation (Fig. 5) . Chan et al. 37 have also shown that human lung adenocarcinoma cell line, Calu-3 and embryonic lung fibroblast cell line HFL are highly susceptible to MERS-CoV infection. Interestingly, however, MERS-CoV-infected Calu-3 can form significant syncytia, whereas MERS-CoV-infected HFL cells cannot, suggesting that MERS-CoV may enter these cells through different pathways. In the present study, we tested the inhibitory activity of HR2P peptide in Calu-3 and HFL cells and found that HR2P could inhibit MERS-CoV infection in Calu-3 cells just as effectively as Vero cells, while HR2P was about 22fold less effective in inhibiting MERS-CoV infection in HFL cells. These findings suggest that MERS-CoV enters into Calu-3 and Vero cells mainly through the plasma membrane fusion route, and, as a result, it is particularly sensitive to inhibition by MERS-CoV fusion inhibitor HR2P, while the virus might enter HFL cells mainly via endocytosis route and, hence, would be relatively resistant to blockade by HR2P peptide.",

After uptake of the virus into endosomes, MERS-CoV S protein is activated by pH-dependent cysteine protease Cathepsin L. Therefore, cathepsin L inhibitor is expected to stop lysosomal entry of the virus after uptake by endocytosis. While TMPRSS2 activates the S protein close to the cell surface, its inhibitor may stop the uptake by direct fusion between viral and cytoplasmic membranes. Since the cell-cell fusion depends on the direct membrane fusion without preceding endocytoisis and endosomal uptake, it is expected that cathepsin L inhibitors will not interfere with the cell-cell fusion, but TMPRSS2 inhibitors may do it. Therefore, it will be interesting to determine whether cell typespecific differences in susceptibility to inhibition by the fusion inhibitors correlate with differences in susceptibility to inhibition by cathepsin L and TMPRSS2 inhibitors as well as HR1-targeted fusion inhibitors.",

            "text": "By comparing the 6-HB core structures of the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV S proteins, we noted that obvious differences of some critical residues in their protein sequences might influence the detailed interactions. First, the residues Q1020/D1024 in HR1 domain of MERS-CoV S2 are able to form hydrogen bond, which may increase the stability of the HR1-trimer 48 . However, the corresponding residues G928/D932 in the HR1 domain of SARS-CoV S2 subunit (PDB ID: 1WYY) are incapable of forming this strong interaction (Supplementary Fig. 6) 28 . Second, the binding between D1261 and T1263 and between E1278 and K1274 in HR2 domain of MERS-CoV S2 subunit is stronger than that between Q1161 and N1159 and between E1276 and K1172 in the HR2 domain of SARS-CoV S2 subunit, respectively ( Supplementary Fig. 7) , suggesting that these two hydrogen bonds in MERS-CoV S2 subunit provide force to stabilize the HR2 helix conformation 49 . Third, there is a hydrogen bond between Q1009 in HR1 and Y1280 in HR2 in MERS-CoV S2, while the corresponding residues Q917 in HR1 and L1178 in HR2 in the SARS-CoV S2 are unable to form the intermolecular hydrogen bond (Supplementary Fig. 8 ). All these findings suggest that the association between the viral HR1 and HR2 domains in MERS-CoV S2 may be stronger than that found in SARS-CoV S2. Consequently, the HR2 peptide of MERS-CoV S2 may have higher binding affinity and hence higher antiviral activity than the corresponding HR2 peptide of SARS-CoV S2 subunit.",

            "text": "Based on the crystal structure of the 6-HB of MERS-CoV S2, HR2P peptide could be modified in order to improve its stability, solubility and antiviral activity using a similar approach described by Otaka et al. 40 by introducing EK mutations, including those forming intramolecular salt-bridges. We thus designed and synthesized two HR2P mutants, HR2P-M1 and HR2P-M2, with 2 and 7 mutations, respectively, some of which could form intramolecular salt-bridges at the i to i \u00fe 4 or at the i to i \u00fe 3 arrangements (Fig. 2) . Indeed, both HR2P-M1 and HR2P-M2 and their complexes with HR1P peptide are more stable than HR2P peptide. The water-solubility of HR2P-M1 and HR2P-M2 is B68-fold and 1,786-fold higher than the HR2P peptide, respectively. Their anti-MERS-CoV activity is moderately improved ( Table 2 ). These results are consistent with those obtained by Otaka et al. 40 , who found that the anti-HIV-1 HR2 peptide C34 with EK mutation (SC34EK) displayed significantly improved stability and water solubility, and moderately improved anti-HIV-1 activity, compared with the wild-type C34 peptide, confirming that this approach can also be used to improve stability, solubility and antiviral activity of HR2 peptides derived from MERS-CoV S protein. Nevertheless, other approaches, such as replacement of the natural amino acids in an HR2 peptide with nonnatural amino acids (for example, D-amino acids) or addition of cholesterol or fatty acid to an HR2 peptide 50,51 may also be used to extend the half-life of the MERS-CoV HR2 peptide.",

Expression and purification of fusion protein HR1-L6-HR2. To express the fusion protein HR1-L6-HR2, the nucleotide sequence encoding the MERS-CoV HR2 region (residues 1,245-1,289) was attached to the 3 0 end of the HR1 region (residues 984-1,062) with a short linker (L6: SGGRGG) in between by overlapping PCR as previously described for constructing SARS-CoV (or HIV-1) 6-HB (ref. 25) . The whole sequence was subcloned into the pET-28a vector with an artificial SUMO-tag.

After co-culture at 37\u00b0C for 4 h, the 293T/MERS/EGFP cells (293T/EGFP cells were used as the negative control) fused or unfused with Huh-7 cells were counted under an inverted fluorescence microscope (Nikon Eclipse Ti-S). The fused cell was much larger by at least twofold than the unfused cell, and the intensity of fluorescence in the fused cell was weaker than that of the unfused cell as a result of the diffusion of EGFP from one cell to two or more cells (see Fig. 5a ). The percent inhibition of cell-cell fusion was calculated using the following formula: (1 \u00c0 (E \u00c0 N)/(P \u00c0 N)) \u00c2 100. 'E' represents the % cell-cell fusion in the experimental group. 'P' represents the % cell-cell fusion in the positive control group, to which no inhibitor was added. 'N' is the % cell-cell fusion in negative control group, in which 293T/MERS/EGFP cells were replaced by 293T/EGFP cells.
