            "text": "It is well known that piglets congenitally infected with porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) can be viremic at birth, and that preweaning mortality due to secondary infections often increases during acute outbreaks of PRRS. Therefore, an immunosuppressive effect of in utero infection has been suggested. The aim of the present study was to characterise the changes of leukocyte populations in piglets surviving in utero infection with PRRSV. A total of 27 liveborn uninfected control piglets and 22 piglets infected transplacentally with a Danish strain of PRRSV were included. At 2 and 4 weeks of age, 21 of 22 (96%) and 7 of 14 (50%) examined infected piglets were still viremic, whereas PRRSV could not be detected in the six infected piglets examined at 6 weeks of age. Flow cytometry analysis was used to determine the phenotypic composition of leukocytes in peripheral blood and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of 2-, 4-and 6-week-old infected piglets and age-matched uninfected controls. The key observation in the present study is that high levels of CD8 \u00fe cells constitute a dominant feature in peripheral blood and BALF of piglets surviving in utero infection with PRRSV. In BALF, the average high level of CD8 \u00fe cells in 2-week-old infected piglets (33:4 AE 12:6%) was followed by a decline to 7:3 AE 3:0 and 11:1 AE 3:0% at 4 and 6 weeks of age. BALF of control piglets contained 1:6 AE 0:9, 2:3 AE 1:8 and 1:9 AE 0:5% CD8 \u00fe cells, only. In peripheral blood, however, the average number of CD8 \u00fe cells remained at high levels in the infected piglets throughout the post-natal experimental period (2:8 AE 1:9, 2:9 AE 1:8 and 3:2 AE 1:7 \u00c2 10 6 CD8 \u00fe cells/ml at 2, 4 and 6 weeks, respectively). In the controls, the average levels of CD8 \u00fe cells were 0:9 AE 0:2, 1:9 AE 1:7 and 1:6 AE 0:5 \u00c2 10 6 /ml, respectively. Furthermore, the numbers of CD2 \u00fe , CD4 \u00fe CD8 \u00fe and SLA-classII \u00fe cells, respectively, in peripheral blood, together with the levels of CD2 \u00fe and CD3 \u00fe cells in BALF were increased in the infected piglets infected in utero compared to the uninfected controls.",

Although the current experimental evidence for any interaction of PRRSV with other pathogens is ambiguous (for review, see Drew, 2000) , a number of reports support the assumption that PRRSV may exacerbate secondary infections (Carvalho et al., 1997; Feng et al., 2001; Galina et al., 1994; Van Reeth et al., 1996; Wills et al., 2000) . If indeed there is an increased susceptibility to other pathogens following PRRSV infection, an underlying mechanism could be suppression of the immune system in infected pigs, as also often suggested. Based on clinical and experimental observations, it appears likely that PRRSV interacts with the immune system of the pig paving the way for increased susceptibility to secondary infections. Drew (2000) summarised the present knowledge concerning immunomodulation by PRRSV and concluded that (i) immunomodulation is likely to be present, at local level, in the lung, (ii) general immunosuppression is possible, but not proven, (iii) the degree of such immunomodulation and its significance for piglet health is unclear, (iv) certain experimental evidence for enhancement of the immune system exists.",

The trachea was cannulated, and the lobes of the right lung were repeatedly washed with lung lavage fluid consisting of PBS supplemented with antibiotics (streptomycin, 0.1 g/l; neomycin, 0.05 g/l; penicillin, 10 6 IU/l; amphotericin, 8 mg/l).

The viruspositive cells were defined as macrophages, and cells with strong as well as weaker staining were observed. Furthermore, morphological evaluation of the slides revealed that various cell types could be detected. In all the control piglets, macrophages were the most prominent cell type with only few lymphocytes present. Granulocytes were either not detected or sporadically seen, only. The macrophages appeared round, uniform with a homogeneous nucleus as previously described for germ-free piglets (Gehrke and Pabst, 1990) . In the infected piglets, the cell composition appeared much more inhomogeneous. Macrophages with differing morphology (varying size, more irregularly shaped, and increased numbers of cytoplasmic processes), monocytes, lymphocytes, plasma cells and epithelial cells could be detected. Compared to the controls, the greatest variation was seen in the 2-week-old infected piglets.

The fact that a such reduction was not observed in our study is likely to reflect that the piglets were not any more in the acute phase of infection, since they had been infected at least 2 weeks prior to the initial haematological examination at 2 weeks of age. In the present experiment, the infection did not significantly change the numbers of CD4 \u00fe cells in peripheral blood. This result corresponds to previous observations in pigs infected with PRRSV at 8 weeks of age (Albina et al., 1998) , but not to the transient decrease in the number of CD4 \u00fe cells in peripheral blood after PRRSV-infection of 54-day-old and 4.5-month-old pigs, respectively, as demonstrated by Shimizu et al. (1996) and Nielsen and B\u00f8tner (1997) . Most likely, this discrepancy is related to variations in experimental design. However, it cannot be excluded that a number of other factors may influence and explain conflicting observations on the kinetics of subpopulations in PRRSV-infected pigs, e.g. variations in pathogenicity among PRRSV strains or postnatal versus congenital infection.",

In addition, Bautista and Molitor (1997) showed that PRRSV-immunised pigs developed memory T cells that not only responded faster on a second virus exposure and with a higher magnitude to in vitro stimulation with PRRSV antigens, but that they were able to mount an antigen-specific in vivo delayed type hypersensitivity reaction in response to intradermal challenge with PRRSV. CD4 \u00fe CD8 \u00fe extrathymic lymphocytes represent a portion of porcine memory T cells, and the CD4/CD8 double-positive cells have been suggested to play a major role in protective immunity (Zuckermann, 1999) . The present demonstration of significantly increased numbers of CD4 \u00fe CD8 \u00fe cells in peripheral blood of the infected piglets compared to the controls most likely reflects the development of PRRSV-specific memory cells. However, the importance of these memory cells in the immune response against PRRSV still remains to be defined.",

In our study, we demonstrated that high levels of CD8 \u00fe cells also constitute a dominant feature of piglets surviving in utero infection with PRRSV. Abnormal high, and persistent, numbers of CD2 \u00fe and CD8 \u00fe cells were observed in peripheral blood of 2-, 4-and 6-week-old infected piglets. Most likely, the increase of CD2 \u00fe cells is mainly due to an augmentation in the number of CD8 \u00fe cells, since the latter express both antigens. CD8 \u00fe cells may belong to the cytotoxic T cell population as well as the natural killer (NK) cell population, but the labelling method used in the present experiment does not discriminate between these two different types of cytolytic cells. Characteristically, the high level of CD8 \u00fe cells in peripheral blood of the infected piglets was paralleled by an augmented percentage of CD8 \u00fe cells in BALF, indicating an influx of these cells into the bronchoalveolar space. However, the decrease in the proportion of CD8 \u00fe cells observed over time in BALF was not seen in peripheral blood, possibly indicating that the effect of the infection may decrease earlier in the lungs than in peripheral blood.",

CD8 \u00fe cells are precursors for cytolytic lymphocytes (i.e. cytotoxic T cells and NK cells) which are important cells for the elimination of virusinfected cells. Albina et al. (1998) suggested that CD8 \u00fe cells could play a role in the control of virus replication, since viremia started to decline shortly after the proliferation of CD8 \u00fe cells. In our experiment, all infected piglets were viremic at 2 weeks of age, but none at 6 weeks. At this stage, however, PRRSV-positive BALF cells were still present, although few in number. This persistence of virus may explain why the level of CD8 \u00fe cells in peripheral blood and BALF remained high in the infected piglets also 6 weeks after birth. Our results support the hypothesis of CD8 \u00fe cells as an important factor in the control of PRRSV replication. However, studies by Shimizu et al. (1996) indicated that a certain as yet unidentified physiological stimulus induced as a consequence of PRRSV infection may be the cause of the proliferation of CD8 \u00fe cells, possibly effectors being helper cells or immuno-stimulating cytokines induced by PRRSV, as suggested by Albina et al. (1998) . In contrast to the study by Albina et al. (1998) showing no changes in the level of peripheral blood granulocytes as a result of infection with PRRSV, we found significantly higher numbers of blood granulocytes in the infected piglets at 2 and 4 weeks of age. Since there were no indications of concurrent bacterial infections to explain the increased level of granulocytes, the possible importance of this event remains to be elucidated.",

The cellular shift in BALF of the in utero infected piglets, represented by increased levels of mononuclear cells in parallel with decreased proportions of macrophages (Fig. 5a -e) correlate well with previous observations after infection of 4-and 8-10week-old SPF piglets with PRRSV (Shibata et al., 1997; Samsom et al., 2000) . The latter authors, however, demonstrated that the number of cells of the macrophage/monocyte lineage in BALF did not decrease, but increased in accordance with an increase of the total number of BALF cells after infection with PRRSV. In the present study, we did only semi-quantitatively determine the total number of cells in BALF. However, the markedly higher amounts of cells recovered from 2-and 4-week-old infected compared to control piglets indicated that the in utero infected piglets had increased numbers of BALF cells. Granulocytes are rarely found in normal porcine BALF (Gehrke and Pabst, 1990 ). The few granulocytes found in the BALF in our experiment (together with the virological results) indicate that no other infection than PRRSV was present in the piglets. The remarkably lower levels of CD3 \u00fe cells compared to CD2 \u00fe cells observed for 2-week-old infected piglets (compare Fig. 5b and c) , but not later, most likely reflect that these CD2 \u00fe populations-in addition to cytotoxic T lymphocytes which stain with anti-CD3 mAbs-comprised a proportion of NK cells which do not stain with anti-CD3 mAbs. This is in accordance with the demonstration of a strong influx of both NK cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes into the bronchoalveolar space during PRRSV-infection in pigs as shown by Samsom et al. (2000) . In contrast to the latter authors who did not find an influence of the infection on the number of CD4 \u00fe cells, we demonstrated significantly higher numbers of CD4 \u00fe cells in BALF from 2-week-old infected piglets, possibly indicating a role of these cells in the respiratory immune response. The low level of B cells in BALF of both infected piglets and controls indicate that these cells do not play any role for the elimination of the respiratory infection, in accordance with the observation that PRRSV persisted in the infected pigs in the presence of high levels of specific antibodies (data not shown).",
