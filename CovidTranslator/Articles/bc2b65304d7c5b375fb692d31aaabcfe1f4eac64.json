Among PRRs, the retinoic acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I)-like receptors and the melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5) detect molecular motifs present in viral oligonucleotides. RIG-I and MDA5 signal through a common pathway mediated by the adaptor protein mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS) that culminates in the expression of type I IFNs and proinflammatory genes, including chemokines and cytokines, that recruit and activate leukocytes (11) . According to current paradigms, RIG-I and MDA5 recognize distinct virus molecular motifs present in different families of viruses. However, accumulating evidence indicates that a number of viruses can be recognized by both intracellular sensors (12) . For example, MDA5 is involved in sensing SeV (13, 14) , a paramyxovirus that bears a negative sense RNA genome and was originally classified as a RIG-I trigger (15, 16) . Whether RIG-I and MDA5 have unique nonredundant activities and whether any of these activities affects the development of chronic lung disease after viral infection is unknown.",

Here we show that MDA5 deficiency leads to an altered inflammatory environment in the lung and to a striking shift in the expression of neutrophil-and monocyte/ lymphocyte-attracting chemokines. These alterations result in enhanced accumulation of AAMs, whereas viral clearance and type I IFN responses are unchanged. MDA5 knockout (KO) mice exhibited a significant chronic increase in mucus-producing goblet cells and in bronchial smooth muscle cell hyperplasia that associated with enhanced airway hyperresponsiveness and with an impaired ability to maintain blood oxygen saturation. Overall, this study shows that signaling by MDA5 modulates the accumulation of pathogenic AAMs in the lung and protects from the development of ",

Virus titers in the respiratory tract of WT and MDA5 KO mice were comparable on Days 3 and 6 after infection, and the virus was cleared by Day 10 ( Figure 1A ). However, MDA5 KO mice lost more weight and showed delayed recovery compared with WT mice ( Figure 1B ). To assess the integrity of the lung epithelial cell barrier, protein concentration and cell numbers were determined in the BAL fluid of infected mice. At 10 days after infection, infected MDA5 KO mice had significantly higher protein concentration ( Figure 1C ) and total cell numbers ( Figure 1D ) in the BAL compared with infected WT mice, suggesting increased damage and disruption of the epithelial cell barrier. These results demonstrate that MDA5 protects the lung from acute damage during SeV infection by a mechanism that is not dependent on the control of virus replication.",

However, we observed striking temporal differences on the expression of chemokines and cytokines in the lungs of infected mice. On Day 3 after infection, MDA5 KO mice showed severely reduced expression of the neutrophil-attracting chemokines Cxcl1 and Cxcl5 and of the proinflammatory cytokines II1b, Tnfa, and Il6 ( Figure 2B ), but on Day 6 after infection, MDA5 KO mice exhibited drastically enhanced expression of the monocyte/ lymphocyte-attracting chemokines Ccl3 and Ccl5 but not of Ccl2. In addition, MDA5-deficient mice had increased expression of the regulatory cytokines Il10, Il13, and Il27 ( Figure 2C ). MDA5 did not regulate the expression of Il33, Tslp/Thymic stromal lymphopoietin, Areg/Amphiregulin, or Il22, which have been associated with lung tissue repair during respiratory virus infection (25, 26) , and transcripts for the granulopoietic cytokine Cfs3/Gscf were not different in WT and MDA5 KO mice on Day 3 after infection but were up-regulated in MDA5KO mice on Days 6 and 10 after infection (see Figure E1 in the online supplement).",

Although most of the SeV Np transcripts were found on CD45 2 cells on WT and MDA5 KO mice ( Figure 3A ), CD45 1 cells also expressed SeV Np. As expected, Ifng was expressed only in hematopoietic cells (CD45 1 ) ( Figure 3B ).

IAV delNS1 lacks the virus-encoded immune antagonistic protein NS1, allowing the development of a stronger host response to infection (27) . After 6 hours, total RNA was extracted from infected cells and analyzed by RT-qPCR. As expected, Ifih1/Mda5 transcripts were only observed in WT cells, whereas WT and MDA5 KO cells induced comparable levels of Ddx58/Rig-I mRNA ( Figure 4A ). During infection with SeV, MDA5 KO cells showed normal expression of viral Np mRNA and of Ifnb mRNA but a significantly reduced expression of the neutrophil-attracting chemokine Cxcl1 mRNA ( Figure 4B ), demonstrating that MDA5 regulates the expression of the neutrophil-attracting chemokine Cxcl1 by DCs, whereas other PRRs are responsible for the expression of Ifnb mRNA during infection with SeV. Unexpectedly, we observed significantly reduced expression of Ifnb and Cxcl1 transcripts in MDA5 KO cells infected with IAV delNS1 accompanied with an increased expression of IAV Np mRNA compared with WT cells ( Figure 4C ). However, infection with IAV PR8 did not show up-regulation of Ifnb and Cxcl1 transcripts due to the activity of NS1. These results indicate that MDA5 also contributes to the expression of Cxcl1 and Ifnb during infection with IAV delNS1.",

Although SeV Np mRNA was expressed at high levels in the absence of MAVS and its expression was increased in a dose-dependent manner ( Figure 5B ), expression of Ifnb and Cxcl1 was completely dependent on the presence of MAVS at all tested doses ( Figures 5C and  5D) . Similarly, expression of IAV Np mRNA was higher in MAVS KO MEFs compared with WT MEFs (Figure 5E ), and expression of Ifnb and Cxcl1 transcripts was dependent on MAVS in response to IAV delNS1 ( Figures 5F and 5G) . These data suggest that MDA5/MAVS-mediated signaling is required for the expression of Cxcl1 in response to SeV or IAV infection.",

            "text": "Based on the differential profile of chemokine expression in infected WT and MDA5 KO mice, we hypothesized that MDA5 deficiency results in an altered composition of infiltrating inflammatory cells in the infected lung. To test this hypothesis, we characterized the cells present in the BAL of WT and MDA5 KO mice 6 days after infection. The gating strategy used for analysis of cell populations is shown in Figure E3 . Corresponding with the profile of chemokine expression (Figure 2 ), significantly fewer neutrophils infiltrated the lungs of MDA5 KO mice on Day 6 after infection ( Figure 6A ), associated with a lower percentage of Ly6G high granulocytic cells and a higher percentage of Ly6C high monocytic cells in the lung infiltrate of MDA5 KO mice compared with WT controls (Figures 6B  and 6C ). In addition, BAL of MDA5 KO mice had a higher percentage of CD3 1 T cells at this time point. Although we did not directly address in this study whether these T cells were predominantly of a Th2 type, we did observe an increase in the content of CD4 1 and CD8 1 T cells in the lung of MDA5-deficient mice (not shown), suggesting and overall enhancement on the T-cell response at this time point. In WT and MDA5 KO mice, resident alveolar macrophages characterized as CD11b int/low F4/ 80 1 CD11c 1 CD206 1 cells ( Figure E4 ) disappeared by Day 6 after infection ( Figure 6D ) and were replaced by CD11b hi -expressing cells. By Day 21 after infection, infected MDA5 KO mice showed a higher percentage of cells expressing markers of alternatively activated macrophages (AAMs: CD11b high F4/80 1 CD11c 1 CD206 1 ). Based on the shift in the proinflammatory profile of the lung toward the expression of Il10 and Il13 and on reports demonstrating a critical role for AAMs in the development of chronic lung diseases in response to SeV (7), we hypothesized that MDA5 deficiency resulted in the excessive accumulation of pathogenic AAMs, leading to the exacerbation of chronic lung disease. Supporting this hypothesis, MDA5 KO mice exhibited a significantly higher ratio of Arg1/Nos2 (28) mRNA expression than WT mice at 10 and 21 days after infection ( Figure 6E ) and expressed more transcripts for Mmp12, Relma/Fizz1, and Chi3l3/4/Ym1/2, although the difference did not always reach statistical significance at these time points. To confirm the bias toward AAMs in MDA5 KO mice, lungs from mice infected for 49 days were stained for FIZZ1, YM1, and F4/80 proteins, the standard markers of AAMs. Both proteins were expressed at much higher levels in MDA5 KO than in infected WT lungs, corresponding with the expression of F480 (Figure 7) and demonstrating a persistent AAM bias in the absence of MDA5. These data strongly suggest that MDA5 signaling determines the acute composition of the lung cellular infiltrate and regulates the persistent accumulation of AAMs during SeV infection.",

These data suggest that other PRRs are primarily responsible for the control of virus replication during low-dose SeV infection, in contrast to a previous study that uses a higher SeV inoculum. In striking contrast, expression of Cxcl1 is largely dependent on MDA5 during infection with SeV, influenza PR8 virus, or influenza delNS1 virus, suggesting that, contrary to current paradigms, MDA5 and RIG-I have distinct nonredundant roles during the response to these viruses.",

An acute fall in Pa O 2 or a Sp O 2 of less than 85 to 88% indicate a significant loss of oxygen homeostasis and loss of biological oxygenation reserve. The increased inability of MDA5 KO mice to maintain blood oxygenation, together with pathophysiological alterations, demonstrate that MDA5 deficiency promotes chronic pulmonary dysfunction. In addition, MDA5 deficiency leads to sustained airway hyperreactivity, corresponding with enhanced bronchial smooth muscle hyperplasia, a characteristic of asthmatic airways. Because airway hyperreactivity is a common manifestation of chronic disease in individuals infected with paramyxoviruses, including respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus, and metapneumovirus (39) (40) (41) , it would be interesting to determine whether polymorphisms in the MDA5 molecule correlate with enhanced susceptibility to chronic postviral lung diseases.",
