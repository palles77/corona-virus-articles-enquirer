Uveitis is one of the most important groups of ocular disease in cats. It may be the first indication of a serious or life-threatening systemic disease, and the small size and close proximity of all intraocular structures make early recognition and treatment of uveitis imperative to avoid sight-threatening consequences.",

Although iritis implies inflammation of the iris only, it often is used synonymously with anterior uveitis. Intermediate uveitis, also referred to as pars planitis, involves predominantly the posterior portion of the ciliary body, the pars plana. Strictly speaking, posterior uveitis is inflammation of the choroid (choroiditis), but because the retina usually is affected concurrently, chorioretinitis is a more accurate term. Because the anterior and posterior uveal tissues are parts of a continuum, inflammation commonly occurs in both simultaneously. Panuveitis is the term used when the entire uveal tract is inflamed.",

            "text": "As with other tissues, intraocular inflammation is initiated by local tissue injury (e.g., trauma, infectious agent, antigen challenge). Tissue factors and chemoattractants are released from damaged tissue and microorganisms; vasodilation and changes in vascular permeability follow. These changes indicate disruption of the blood-ocular barrier. Inflammatory mediators, released by damaged tissue cells, cause leukocyte activation and migration. Because the globe has no lymphatic drainage, antigens from degraded organisms are transported to the spleen or other lymphoid tissue via the venous system to activate antigen-specific T and B lymphocytes. Immunocompetent T and B lymphocytes then migrate back to the eye and reside in the uvea. 5 Factors believed to help stop the immune response include elimination of the inciting antigen and production of inhibitory cytokines by T and B lymphocytes. 6 If the inciting antigen cannot be removed completely, as in autoimmune disease, chronic inflammation results. Some proposed mechanisms that contribute to development of autoimmune uveitis include (1) abnormal induction of tolerance to autoantigens, (2) release of normally sequestered autoantigens resulting from trauma or infection, (3) molecular mimicry (homology between pathogens and host tissue antigens), and (4) alteration of autoantigen structure resulting from tissue injury or inflammation. 5, 7, 8 Because uvea contains immunocompetent lymphocytes, chronic or recurrent inflammation also could result from specific or nonspecific activation of lymphocytes by non-self antigens. 9 The clinician must impress upon the client that even with an exhaustive diagnostic evaluation, a specific cause for uveitis may not be found. The client should understand that, regardless of the inciting cause, uveitis may become chronic, treatment may be palliative, and adverse sequelae are common.",

Ocular pain, manifested by photophobia, blepharospasm, enophthalmos, elevation of the third eyelid, and/or epiphora, is common with acute anterior uveitis but may be absent when chronic. Reddened sclera, caused by injection of conjunctival and episcleral vessels, and aqueous flare are the hallmarks of anterior uveitis. Aqueous flare is caused by increased protein concentration in the aqueous humor and is secondary to disruption of the blood-ocular barrier. Light passing through the anterior chamber is scattered in aqueous flare, and if severe, the aqueous humor appears cloudy. Corneal edema can result from the effects of inflammation on the corneal endothelium. As edema increases, the cornea becomes increasingly opaque and blue. Inflammatory cells in the aqueous humor may be deposited on the internal surface of the corneal endothelium as keratic precipitates (KPs). Normal convection currents in the aqueous humor cause KPs to be located primarily on the ventral half of the cornea. Keratic precipitates vary in size. Larger KPs are seen more often with granulomatous inflammatory processes associated with diseases such as FIP and toxoplasmosis (Figure 3-1) .",

            "text": "The iris undergoes many changes with anterior uveitis. Inflammatory mediators, in particular prostaglandins, cause miosis by a direct effect on the iris sphincter. Very mild miosis is difficult to detect, so its absence should not be used to rule out uveitis. Iritis, manifested by iris vasodilation and increased iris vessel permeability, often causes a subtle to pronounced iris color change. On close examination, dilated iris vessels may be obvious, and the iris may appear swollen and have a thin coat of fibrin and cells giving it a velvet-like texture. As anterior uveitis becomes more chronic, the pupil margin may begin to form posterior synechiae (adhesions to the anterior lens capsule), which give the pupil an irregular shape and impair its ability to respond to light or dilating agents (Figure 3 -2). If extensive posterior synechiae develop, aqueous humor cannot move from the posterior chamber to the anterior chamber. Aqueous humor then accumulates behind the iris and causes it to billow forward, a condition known as iris bomb\u00e9. Because access to the anterior chamber is required for aqueous humor to reach the filtration angle, iris bomb\u00e9 is associated with increasing intraocular pressure and glaucoma. Peripheral anterior synechiae (adhesions of the peripheral iris to the cornea) can form with anterior uveitis as a result of iris bomb\u00e9 or secondary to iris swelling and inflammation. Inflammatory cells, iris swelling, and anterior synechiae also can impair aqueous outflow and contribute to the development of secondary glaucoma. Aqueous humor formation is impaired when the ciliary body is inflamed. Thus anterior uveitis causes low intraocular pressure unless complicated by secondary glaucoma. Inflammation also causes ciliary muscle spasm, a major contributor to ocular pain. Accumulation of inflammatory cells in the peripheral anterior vitreous is referred to as pars planitis or intermediate uveitis. Because of its peripheral location, pars planitis often is not apparent without dilating the pupil.",

Because of their close apposition, retinal inflammation often accompanies inflammation of the choroid, which creates chorioretinitis. Changes in the ocular fundus secondary to chorioretinitis are related to the breakdown of the blood-ocular barrier, located at the retinal blood vessels and the retinal pigment epithelium. Increased permeability of these barriers allows components of the blood to accumulate within and between the choroid and retina. Migration of inflammatory cells to the area of inflammation also occurs. Clinically, retinal and subretinal fluid exudes, and hemorrhage can be detected. Because the retina and subretinal space overlie the tapetum, tapetal reflectivity is diminished or obscured by areas of active chorioretinitis (Figure 3 -3). Severe chorioretinitis can lead to partial or complete retinal detachment and decreased vision or blindness. Inflammation of both the anterior and posterior uvea is termed endophthalmitis.",

To perform paracentesis, a 25-, 27-, or 30-gauge needle on a 1-or 3-ml syringe; small rat-toothed forceps; adequate lighting; and magnification are needed. The bulbar conjunctiva and cornea are flushed gently with a 1:20 povidone-iodine and sterile saline solution. Povidone-iodine soap should not be used because it irritates the cornea and conjunctiva. The globe should be grasped with forceps at the dorsolateral limbus. The needle should enter the eye at the limbus and parallel to the iris plane. The globe will be most stable if the needle enters the eye immediately adjacent to the hold of the forceps. Care should be taken to keep the needle bevel up and the tip away from the iris and lens (Figure 3-4) . Up to 0.3 ml of aqueous humor usually can be removed slowly without collapsing the anterior chamber. After withdrawing the needle, gentle pressure is applied to the centesis site using a moistened cotton swab. Samples of aqueous humor can be dropped directly onto a swab for culture and sensitivity, or stored in a sterile container (such as a red top tube) for antigen, DNA, or antibody measurement techniques.

General anesthesia is recommended. Before aspiration, the bulbar conjunctiva is cleaned gently with 1:20 povidone-iodine and sterile saline solution to remove all mucus and debris. The dorsolateral globe is grasped 6 to 7 mm behind the limbus with small, toothed forceps. Vitreous is viscous and can be difficult to aspirate, so a 3-ml syringe is needed for adequate suction. Aspiration through a 25-gauge needle can be attempted first, but a 22-gauge needle often is needed to obtain a sufficient sample for analysis. The needle should be aimed toward the center of the globe and should be introduced into the eye 7 to 9 mm posterior to the limbus, adjacent to the forceps for maximal stabilization (Figure 3 -5) . If a mass is present, the needle can be guided by ultrasound into the mass for aspiration. If the ocular media are clear, the needle can be guided visually with use of indirect ophthalmoscopy. Care should be taken not to advance the needle into the opposite retina and choroid. Slightly altering the needle position may help if aspirating fluid is difficult.

Failure to control inflammation can lead to posterior synechiae, glaucoma, cataracts, retinal detachment, vitreous degeneration, optic nerve atrophy, and retinal degeneration. Glucocorticoids and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are used commonly to control inflammation. Glucocorticoids (GC) can be administered topically, subconjunctivally, or systemically. Anterior uveitis usually is treated topically 10 a minimum of every 4 to 6 hours and as frequently as every 2 hours, depending on the severity of inflammation. Aggressive treatment is continued until the inflammation is controlled, and then the frequency of administration should be tapered slowly. If inflammation is not controlled, or if frequent treatments are not possible, supplementation with oral GC should be considered. Topical preparations with the best potency and corneal penetration are prednisolone acetate suspension (1 per cent), and dexamethasone solution (0.1 per cent) or ointment (0.05 per cent). 11 Topical GC are contraindicated in the presence of corneal ulceration because they inhibit wound healing and augment collagenase activity in the cornea. 12 Systemic administration of GC has minimal corneal effects unless the cornea is heavily vascularized; therefore they can be administered if concurrent corneal ulceration and anterior uveitis exist. 13 Ocular release of prostaglandins can cause disruption of the blood-ocular barrier and uveitis. NSAIDs decrease inflammation by inhibiting cyclo-oxygenase, which results in decreased production of prostaglandins. NSAIDs, unlike GC, do not inhibit the lipoxygenase inflammatory pathway, and little information exists regarding their use for treatment of uveits in cats. Therefore use of NSAIDs should be considered primarily when GC are contraindicated. Frequently used topical ophthalmic NSAIDs include diclofenac 0.1 per cent, flurbiprofen 0.03 per cent, suprofen 1 per cent, and ketorolac 0.5 per cent. Ocular hemorrhage caused by platelet aggregation inhibition 12,14 can be a potential complication of their use. Topical NSAIDs may complicate bacterial corneal infections and are not recommended when corneal infection is present. 12, 15 Systemic drug therapy is necessary to treat posterior uveitis, because therapeutic concentrations cannot be attained in the retina and choroid with topical drugs. Because GC suppress the immune response, they should be used with caution (if at all) when infection is suspected, especially if given systemically. If they are used during infection, concurrent treatment with an effective antimicrobial is essential. Drugs, dosages, and routes of GC administration can be found in Table 3 -3. Use of systemic NSAIDs in cats has been associated with potentially serious side effects, including bone marrow suppression, gastrointestinal ulceration, hemorrhage, vomiting, and diarrhea. 16 Aspirin, phenylbutazone, ketoprofen, and meloxicam can be used systemically in cats with careful attention to dose, frequency of administration, and possible side effects. 17, 18 The course of phenylbutazone therapy should be kept as short as possible, preferably not exceeding 5 days at higher dosages, and the drug should be withheld if inappetence or depression develops. 16 Duodenal perforation in a cat following treatment with oral carprofen has been reported. 19 Other reports indicate that carprofen can be administered safely to cats as a postoperative analgesic. 20 Subconjunctival GC have been used to supplement topical or systemic GC therapy in cases of severe ocular inflammation or in patients in which frequent topical treatment is not possible. 10 Most subconjunctival preparations used are long-acting, and give a constant source of drug release for a 2-to 4-week period. A disadvantage to their use is the inability to withdraw the medication if complications arise. Drugs injected subconjunctivally enter the eye through the cornea, by leakage through the injection site, and through the sclera. 15 Subconjunctival GC are contraindicated with active corneal ulceration. Topical and subconjunctival GC use also may result in reactivation of feline herpesvirus-1 in carrier cats with previous episodes of viral keratitis or conjunctivitis. 21 Administration of subconjunctival GC to cats suspected to have recurrent feline herpesvirus ocular disease is not recommended.",

Mydriatics can prevent or break down posterior synechiae by dilation of the pupil and reduction of iris-lens contact. Cycloplegia and mydriasis can be accomplished by using a parasympatholytic agent. Topical 1 per cent atropine sulfate ointment is used most commonly, because the ocular solution is more likely to reach the mouth via the nasolacrimal duct and cause profuse salivation as a result of its bitter taste. The duration and frequency of application depend on the severity of ocular inflammation. Very mild inflammation usually is treated only once daily; severe inflammation may require treatment up to three to four times daily to maintain iris dilatation. Because parasympatholytics can cause decreased tear production, they are generally applied until the pupil dilates and then are discontinued until the pupil begins to constrict. The addition of a sympathomimetic agent may help to achieve mydriasis when synechiae have formed already (see Table 3 -3). 22",

Because cats often become infected by carnivorism, a history of ingesting undercooked meat or hunting activity is common. Acute, polysystemic illness associated with toxoplasmosis is uncommon; fever and hyperesthesia possibly related to muscle inflammation are the most common systemic signs. 23 The actual prevalence of ocular toxoplasmosis is unknown. Many cats with uveitis and positive T. gondii serology have no other clinical evidence of disease. When available, ocular histopathology on these cases rarely identifies the organism, 3,25 which makes it difficult to correlate positive serology with ocular infection. This is especially true because many commercial laboratory tests for 27 Detection of T. gondii antibody production in the aqueous humor also is used to support the diagnosis of ocular toxoplasmosis in cats. 28, 29 This test uses an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to detect antibodies to T. gondii in both serum and aqueous humor. The Goldman-Witmer coefficient (C-value) is calculated to adjust for antibody leakage from the serum. A C-value greater than 1 indicates that T. gondii-specific antibody is being produced in the eye. Because IgM production has only been detected in the aqueous humor of cats with uveitis, 28,29 detection of IgM might indicate disease resulting from the organism. Toxoplasma gondii DNA has been amplified from blood and aqueous humor using a PCR assay. [30] [31] [32] However, because positive results are found in some apparently healthy research cats, the positive predictive value is not 100 per cent. Although a definitive diagnosis of ocular toxoplasmosis is difficult to make and confirm, treatment with an anti-Toxoplasma drug is justified when other causes of uveitis have been ruled out and serological evidence exists of recent or active infection, ocular T. gondii antibody production (particularly IgM) is identified, or organismal DNA is found in aqueous humor.",

The frequency of GC treatment varies, depending on the severity of clinical signs, but generally q6h is minimal. If the response is poor, uveitis is severe, or more frequent administration of topical GC is needed but not possible, oral administration of prednisolone usually can be given safely in antiinflammatory dosages without a significant risk of potentiating systemic toxoplasmosis.

Clindamycin is the drug of choice for treating clinical toxoplasmosis in cats. 27 Although several dose ranges have been reported, the authors currently recommend 10 to 12.5 mg/kg PO q12h for 4 weeks. Liquid clindamycin, administered at 4\u221e C, is tolerated by most cats. Trimethoprimsulfonamide combination therapy (15 mg/kg PO q12h for 2 to 4 weeks) also can be used for treatment of toxoplasmosis, although it is less suitable because of the potential side effects caused by folic acid deficiency in cats. Frequent monitoring for mental depression, anemia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia is required, especially if treatment is longer than 2 weeks. 27 Azithromycin is a potential alternate choice for cats intolerant of clindamycin or sulfa drugs; however, the most appropriate dose for the treatment of toxoplasmosis has not been determined. Nonspecific treatment for uveitis should be used concurrently. To date, no evidence suggests that the use of topical corticosteroids exacerbates systemic toxoplasmosis.",

Ocular disease accompanied by ascites, thoracic or pericardial effusion, depression, icterus, renal failure, diarrhea, or neurological signs is suggestive of FIP. Ocular lesions are seen most often with the noneffusive or dry form of FIP. Anterior and/or posterior uveitis may be present. Iritis, large keratic precipitates, and clots of fibrin and blood in the anterior chamber are found commonly, along with cuffing of the retinal vasculature and chorioretinitis. Similar to toxoplasmosis, confirming a diagnosis of FIP can be challenging. Studies have shown 25 per cent of household pets and 80 per cent or more of cattery-reared cats carry serum antibodies against feline coronavirus. 31 Current serodiagnostic tests cannot distinguish between antibodies against pathogenic or nonpathogenic coronaviruses. [34] [35] [36] Therefore diagnosis usually is based on the combination of clinical signs, physical examination findings, and laboratory evaluation. High serum globulin (>5.1 g/dl), low albumin:globulin ratio, and effusion total protein content greater than 3.5 g/dl also are supportive. Although a high coronavirus antibody titer also is supportive, it does not correlate with disease as well as hyperglobulinemia or low albumin:globulin ratio. 34, 37, 38 RT-PCR tests on blood are not useful in the diagnosis of FIP because nonpathogenic coronaviruses can be found in the serum or plasma of normal cats. 38, 39 Detection of coronavirus RNA in tissues, effusions, or aqueous humor by RT-PCR assay may correlate with the presence of FIP; however, nonpathogenic coronavirus also can be found in the tissues of normal cats. 38",

            "text": "FeLV-associated diseases are detected most often in young cats. Ocular disease can occur alone or in combination with systemic signs of illness. Ocular disease does not occur with FeLV infection except by its association with the development of lymphosarcoma (LSA) or by immune suppression and increased susceptibility to other infectious diseases such as T. gondii and systemic mycoses. The incidence of ocular disease among clinically affected FeLV-positive cats is reported to be low (2 per cent or less) 42 ; however, LSA has been shown to be a common cause of uveitis in enucleated eyes. 25 The ocular lesions of LSA result from neoplastic infiltration of the uveal tract and the clinical signs depend on tumor distribution. Nodular or diffuse infiltration of the anterior and/or posterior uveal tract is possible, and when diffuse, has an appearance similar to uveitis resulting from other causes. 43 Although isolated ocular LSA probably does not occur, ocular disease may be the primary clinical sign, and many cats with ocular LSA appear to be clinically healthy otherwise. 43 Confirming the diagnosis of ocular LSA requires identification of neoplastic lymphocytes. Sometimes these can be found in aqueous humor cytology, but usually bone marrow cytology or biopsy of tumor located elsewhere in the body is necessary. Testing for infection by FeLV always is indicated because treatment and prognosis may be altered by the FeLV status. 44 However, the usefulness of FeLV testing for diagnostic purposes is limited because most FeLV-positive cats do not have LSA. Conversely, a negative FeLV test does not rule out LSA, because 20 to 70 per cent of cats with confirmed LSA are FeLVnegative. 45 The ELISA for detection of the p27 antigen in the blood is the most widely used, commercially available screening test for FeLV. A PCR assay that can be used to confirm lymphoma has been evaluated for use in dogs; further data are being collected concerning its use in cats. 46 ",

As an additional confounding factor, antibodies induced by a commercially available FIV vaccine (Fel-O-Vax, Fort Dodge Laboratories) cannot be distinguished from those induced by natural infection on any presently available FIV antibody test, so the vaccination status of all cats with uveitis must be determined. Detection of FIV antibodies does not prove that uveitis is due to FIV.

Additionally, herpesvirus DNA was detected in aqueous humor in 11 of 73 cats with uveitis but in only one of 22 healthy cats. These results show that FHV-1 enters the eyes of cats and may be associated with uveitis. Because the majority of client-owned cats are vaccinated or preexposed to FHV-1, antibodies are detected in most of their sera. 77 Thus serum antibody detection has no benefit in the diagnosis of FHV-1-associated uveitis.

Formation of synechiae can lead to glaucoma by obstructing the flow of aqueous humor through the pupil and/or out the iridocorneal angle. The intraocular pressure (IOP) of an eye with glaucoma secondary to anterior uveitis may be in the normal range because of the simultaneous decrease in aqueous humor production and outflow. Measurement of IOP should be performed on all patients with anterior uveitis. The development of secondary glaucoma should be suspected when IOP is greater than 10 mm Hg in an eye with anterior uveitis, and the eye should be monitored closely for increasing IOP. Glaucoma is treated best with carbonic anhydrase inhibitors and beta-blockers to decrease aqueous humor production. Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors can be administered orally (dichlorphenamide 0.5 to 1.5 mg/kg q12h to q8h or methazolamide 3 to 4 mg/kg q12h) or topically (dorzolamide or brinzolamide q8h). Systemic side effects (vomiting, diarrhea, panting, depression, potassium depletion) are less likely with topical treatment. Timolol, betaxolol, carteolol, levobunolol, and metipranolol are topical betaadrenergic blocking agents and are administered q12h. Betablockers should be used with caution in animals showing signs of heart failure or bronchial asthma because of potential systemic absorption.",
