In addition to health system strengthening in terms of surveillance and response capacity to early detect and manage outbreaks, the community needs to be engaged and made aware of the risks for each potential threat and of their roles and responsibilities in securing national health security. This could address the issue of staff not presenting to work since community involvement in planning could positively influence decisions healthcare workers take during an emergency with respect to work and surge capacity. In Nigeria respondents suggested sensitisation of communities for effective prevention and control. A survey in the USA stated the need for honest accurate information, 'even if that information worried people.'

Unfortunately lessons learned from previous outbreaks are not being used to modify existing services and practices and for each new public health event it seems we are starting from square one. An understanding of the community perceptions about a public health threat is what is needed to be able to develop and target information about the disease and its control (21). This study attempted to achieve this, to aid the Government in its capacity building efforts to increase the country's resilience during a major public health event.",
