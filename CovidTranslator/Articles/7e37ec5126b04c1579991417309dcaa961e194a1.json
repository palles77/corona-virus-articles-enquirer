The clinical characteristics are high fever, rapidly progressive diffuse pneumonitis and respiratory distress. It is highly infectious through intimate contact or direct contact with infectious body fluids. Outbreaks within communities and hospitals have been reported. Development of rapid and reliable diagnostic tools is urgently needed. We developed an immunoglobulin G (IgG) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), using whole virus antigen of SARS-CoV. Eighty-six serum samples collected from patients who were hospitalized for other causes were examined to determine the cut-off O.D. value. The cut-off O.D. value was defined as 0.175 by calculating the mean O.D. value of the 86 sera plus 3 standard deviations. To determine the sensitivity and specificity of the ELISA, 56 positive sera and 204 negative sera were tested. The sensitivity was 96.4% and the specificity was 100%. The results suggest that the IgG ELISA using whole virus antigen of SARS-CoV has a high sensitivity and specificity in detecting SARS IgG antibodies. This IgG ELISA is a powerful tool for serodiagnosis of SARS.",

This virus is transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets, fomites, or respiratory secretions. The virus is highly contagious and able to cause outbreaks within communities and hospitals [1, 2, 4] . Delayed diagnosis and failure to isolate SARS patients in hospitals can lead to the transmission of this virus to healthcare workers and other patients [1, 4, 8] . However, it is very difficult to distinguish SARS-CoV infection from other acute viral respiratory diseases, such as influenza, based on the clinical presentations [8, 9] . Current laboratory diagnosis of SARS-CoV infection is achieved by isolating the virus by cell culture or detecting the viral nucleic acids by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). These methods are either time-consuming or of inadequate sensitivities. For that reason, developing a rapid and reliable diagnostic tool is of urgent need. In this study, we describe a sensitive and specific ELISA in detecting SARS-CoV IgG for use in routine diagnosis and for large-scale population surveillance.",

(a) Purified whole virus antigens were subjected to electrophoresis on 7.5 and 10% SDS-PAGE gels (lane 1). Proteins were visualized by staining with Coomassie Blue. Bands corresponding to S, S fragment, N, M, and E proteins are identified. The molecular masses of protein standard (lane 2) are shown at the right. (b) Western blot analysis of SARS-CoV whole virus antigen preparations using four different patients' sera is shown in lane 1 to lane 4. There is a major antigen recognized by patients' sera. The size of the major antigen is compatible with the mouse monoclonal anti-N antibody (lane 5).",

ELISA is able to differentiate between positive and negative sera. The mean O.D. values for the positive sera and negative sera were 0.286 and 0.036, respectively. With the cut-off O.D. value set at 0.175, all 204 negative control sera collected in 2000 and 2001 had O.D. values lower than the cutoff, while 54 of the 56 positive controls collected from SARS patients had O.D. values higher than the cut-off. The sensitivity of the SARS-CoV IgG ELISA using whole SARS-CoV antigen is 96.4%, and the specificity is 100%. The positive predictive value is 100% and the negative predictive value is 99%. The results also correlate well with the IFA results.",
