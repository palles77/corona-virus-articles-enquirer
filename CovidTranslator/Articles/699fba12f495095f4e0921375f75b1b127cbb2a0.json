Multiple inactive vaccines can be conveniently and effectively administered at a single clinic visit. 3 Administration of multiple live vaccines sequentially can impair the immune response; therefore, they should be given either simultaneously or separated by at least 4 weeks. Interruption in a vaccine series does not require restarting the series; generally the series can resume from the last administered dose. For instance, if a patient is receiving the hepatitis B series and receives the first and second injection at the appropriate interval (0 and 1 month) but misses the 6-month shot, the patient can receive it as soon as convenient without restarting the series de novo.",

Otherwise, completion of the 3-day course is advised. For patients traveling to Southeast Asian countries, where quinoloneresistant Campylobacter is prevalent (check the CDC Web site for up-to-date resistance patterns), azithromycin is the preferred antimicrobial agent. 10 For these patients, azithromycin 1000 mg by mouth once should be provided. 11 Rifaxamin is an alternative for otherwise uncomplicated traveler's diarrhea in a healthy host; however, it is not first-line therapy, because of concern for decreased efficacy in more severe cases. 8",

Other types of insect repellant have been found inferior. The length of effectiveness is directly related to concentration of DEET. For example, 23.8% DEET is effective for approximately 5 hours, whereas 4.75% is effective for only 88 minutes. 12 Permethrin-based insecticide should be sprayed on clothing and bed nets to decrease risk of mosquitos and tick bites. 11, 13 Malaria deserves special mention, because it infects approximately 30,000 European and North American travelers per year. 14 The Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) recommends the ABCD approach to malaria. A stands for riskawareness. The risk of contracting malaria varies with the destination, season, climate, altitude, and number of mosquito bites; up-to-date information is available on the CDC Web site. B is for bite-avoidance (see earlier discussion on avoiding insect bites in general). C is for chemoprophylaxis compliance. Prophylaxis is recommended for all travelers to endemic areas. Prophylaxis medications suppress malaria by killing asexual blood stages of the parasite before they can cause disease. Therefore, protective levels must be present when parasites emerge from the liver. Effective prophylaxis must start before first possible exposure and continue for a period after the last potential mosquito bite. The timing of starting and stopping prophylaxis varies by regimen, with some regimens needing to be started several weeks before departure, whereas others must be continued after the traveler returns home. 11 There are many options for malaria prophylaxis, although in practice the decision is often made easier by the combination of timing of departure, willingness to take a daily medication, and tolerance of potential side effects. One recommended approach is depicted in Table 2 .",

Travelers who may have sex with new partners abroad should bring latex condoms, because some studies have shown those manufactured abroad may be more prone to breakage. 11, 17, 18 Populations found to be more likely to engage in sexual activity with new partners abroad or to have unprotected sex include younger travelers (<25 years age), men who have sex with men, 19 expatriates, 19 military personnel, 20 and sex tourists 18 (defined as those who travel with explicit intention of engaging in sexual activity). In these populations, discussion about how to obtain pre-exposure or postexposure prophylaxis for sexually transmitted infections is appropriate.

Cutaneous leishmaniasis has 4 superficial manifestations: localized, recidivans, diffuse, and mucosal. The localized cutaneous form occurs on any exposed area of skin, starting as a red papule that enlarges to form a painless ulcer with heaped up margins and granulomatous tissue at the base (Fig. 3) . These lesions are self-limited and the rate of resolution is determined by the particular infective species. A hypopigmented scar after ulcer resolution is common. Leishmaniasis recidivans is uncommon, and is caused by Leishmania tropica infections in the Middle East. After resolution of the primary lesion, a few remaining pathogens cause new papules to occur around the margins of the scar. These papules can appear, ulcerate, and heal repeatedly over decades. In patients with an impaired cell-mediated immune response, diffuse cutaneous leishmaniasis can occur. Instead of a primary lesion that ulcerates, the organism disseminates to macrophages in other areas of the skin. Diffuse cutaneous leishmaniasis characteristically has a relapsing or chronically progressive course that may cause significant deformity. Mucosal leishmaniasis occurs as a late-stage complication of less than 5% of cases of L braziliensis infection, which is endemic to Latin America. Months to years after primary lesion has resolved, recurrence at a distant mucosal site may occur.",

The patient may experience incremental increase in fever over the first week, increasing at a rate of 0.5 C to 1.0 C a day. A plateau of fevers ranging from 39 to 41 for 2 weeks follows. Generally, this plateau phase is not seen in the traveler, as opposed to the endemic population in a developing country, because travelers are more apt to seek care at earlier stages. On examination, relative bradycardia may be seen as well as hepatosplenomegaly, although neither of these findings is specific. Rose spots are lightly erythematous, nonblanching plaques 2 to 4 mm in diameter and are seen in 5% to 30% of patients with typhoid. Children and patients with HIV are more likely to present with diarrhea, whereas adults are more likely to complain of constipation. Complications occur in 10% to 15% of patients and are particularly likely in patients who have been ill for more than 2 weeks. Among the numerous complications are gastrointestinal bleeding, intestinal perforation, and typhoid encephalopathy.",
