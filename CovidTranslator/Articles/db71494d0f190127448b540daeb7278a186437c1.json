The quality of health services will depend upon appropriate preparation as well as the availability of a national protocol [1, 2] and an informed and committed staff complement both at an administrative and clinical level. Current ICU staff and critical care infrastructure will be inadequate for the expected influx of patients even in the best equipped hospitals. Calculations in the UK estimate that there will potentially be ten times as many patients requiring mechanical ventilation as the number of beds available, and the mortality and the need for specialized care will be that much greater in developing countries where resources are most constrained [3] .",

More will avoid falling ill, will feel more confident that everything possible had been done to ensure their safety and more will perceive that it is their ethical duty to remain at work. In addition, each hospital will have to formulate a triage plan prior to the onset of a disaster or pandemic that should take into account local resources in terms of staff, space and equipment, and this plan will have to be taught and communicated to the appropriate hospital staff (See Chap. 7, Critical care triage). Mass care facilities in close proximity to the triage area must be planned and staff trained as to where these will be and how these areas should be managed (see Chap. 2, Surge capacity and infrastructure considerations). Changing areas have to be provided external to the treatment area where appropriate protective gear can be donned and removed (see Chap. 6, Protection of patients and staff). All staff must be aware of the designated areas allocated for management of ICU patients and must be trained in procedures best designed to contain the infection by the use of a standard management guide. Relevant ethical issues must also be discussed and explored prior to a pandemic. These include issues such as triage, admission and discharge criteria and absenteeism, all of which should be addressed, written down and agreed to, so that each staff member understands in advance the choices that will have to be made. Decision makers and the public should engage in these discussions in order that ethical decisions reflect what most people will accept as fair and good for public health.",

Duty to provide: Providers will have to weigh demands of their professional roles against other competing obligations to their own health and to family and friends. Moreover, health care workers will face significant challenges related to resource allocation, scope of practice, professional liability and workplace conditions. These codes or statements should cover such issues as: a. How much risk should health care workers be required to take; b. Their duty to care for the sick and to care for themselves so they can continue to provide care; and c. Their duty not to harm others by transmitting disease. 3.
