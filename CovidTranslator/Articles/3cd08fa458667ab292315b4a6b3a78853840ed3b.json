The antiviral evaluation depicted that compounds 9 and 19 were active against Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) in HeLa cell cultures. QSAR investigations indicated that the multi-target QSAR model was effective in describing the antimicrobial (antibacterial and antifungal) activity over the one-target QSAR models. Further the mt-QSAR model indicated that the topological parameters, second order molecular connectivity index ( 2 c) and third order Kier's alpha shape index (ka 3 ) are effective in describing the antimicrobial activity of synthesized hydrazides.",

Further, recent literature reveals that the QSAR have been applied to describe the relationship between narrow range of biological activity and physicochemical properties of the molecules [24,40e42] . When biological activity data lies in the narrow range, the presence of minimum standard deviation of the biological activity justifies its use in QSAR studies [24, 25] .

The ot-QSAR models, which are almost in all the literature, become unpractical or at less complicated to use when we have to predict to each compound results for more than one target. In these cases we have to develop one ot-QSAR for each target. However, very recently the interest has been increased in development of multi-target QSAR (mt-QSAR) models. In opposition to ot-QSAR, the mt-QSAR model is a single equation that considers the nature of molecular descriptors which are common and essential for describing the antibacterial and antifungal activity [43e47].",

This observation reveals the fact that presence of chloro substituent at ortho position increases the antibacterial and antifungal potential of the compounds. This fact is supported by the observations of Guven et al. [49] . 3. It can also be seen from the results of antibacterial and antifungal activity that the activity increases with increase in chain length of acid portion of synthesized compounds (1e4, 11e14) . This is similar to one of our previous reports [23] . 4. Compounds 6 and 16 derived from cinnamic acid have shown better activity as compared to other synthesized compounds. This may be due to the presence of extended conjugation in cinnamic acid portion and aromatic nucleus of aldehydes, which may be involved in binding of synthesized compound with the target site. This fact is supported by one of our earlier studies [24] . 5. The presence of electron withdrawing group (NO 2 ) in compounds 10 and 20 makes them highly active antibacterial and antifungal agents.
