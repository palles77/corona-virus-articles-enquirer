The process and problems in establishing a local skin bank will be described together with a retrospective review of skin allograft recipients to determine the efficacy of the programme. For the skin bank set-up, pertinent issues related to legislation, methods, logistics, quality assurance and donation rate are discussed. In this retrospective review, a comparison between patients who had early complete excision with skin allograft transplantation and those who received conventional staged excision and coverage, was analysed in terms of clinical profile and outcome using statistical methods. The former group presented a significant reduction of mortality rate and hospital stay by 29% and 10 days, respectively. The establishment of the skin bank has helped in the management of severe burn patients by facilitating early excision and allografting. In a Burn Centre, therefore, it is essential to have an ample supply of skin allograft for burn victims in readiness for mass disaster situations.",

The use of cadaveric skin allografts as temporary biological coverage for transplantation on massive thermal injury is practised in many major Burn Centres. Its relative low cost and availability permits early complete excision of the burn wound which has been shown to reduce mortality, length of hospital stay and even blood loss [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] . The secondary objective of the skin bank is to have an available source of skin allografts for research purposes.",

Tables 2 and 3 show the patients' profile and clinical results, respectively. Continuous data was summarised as the mean (\u0100) followed by the standard deviation (S.D.) in the form\u0100 \u00b1 S.D. From Table 2 , it can be observed that the two groups of patients essentially have similar profiles. Patients who had early excision and grafting on an average underwent surgery 1.7 days post-injury as compared to 5.5 days for the control group (Table 3) . MR reduced significantly from 45% in the latter group to 16% in the study group. Like- wise, LOS reduced from an average of 58.5 to 48.3 days.",
