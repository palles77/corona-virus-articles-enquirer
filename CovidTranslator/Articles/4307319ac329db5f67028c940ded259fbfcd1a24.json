Chest computed tomographic (CT) scan showed bilateral ground-glass opacities ( Figure 1 ). He was initially treated with intravenous levofloxacin and ribavirin, but remained febrile. He was admitted to Wuhan Fifth Hospital on Jan 26 th 2020 and a throat swab nucleic acid test was positive for 2019-nCoV. Moxifloxacin 0.4 g and ganciclovir 0.25 g were then given intravenously daily (and continued until Feb 5 th 2020). Initially, his temperature rose to 39\u2103 with a dry cough on Jan 27 th ,2020 and oxygen saturation decreased gradually requiring oxygen nasal supplementation. Body temperature dropped to normal on Jan 29 th , however oxygen saturation deteriorated, (75% without supplemental oxygen after slight activity). CT scan revealed worsening of lung lesions ( Figure 1 ) and oxygen was given through a face mask with improvement of oxygen saturation to 95%. Intravenous human gamma globulin 10 g / day plus methylprednisolone 80 mg/day for initiated for 5 consecutive days and other immunosuppressive drugs were held from Jan 30 th to Feb 5 th , 2020.",
