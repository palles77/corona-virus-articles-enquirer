            "text": "Echinacea is one of the most commonly used herbal products, but controversy exists about its benefi t in the prevention and treatment of the common cold. Thus, we did a meta-analysis evaluating the eff ect of echinacea on the incidence and duration of the common cold. 14 unique studies were included in the meta-analysis. Incidence of the common cold was reported as an odds ratio (OR) with 95% CI, and duration of the common cold was reported as the weighted mean diff erence (WMD) with 95% CI. Weighted averages and mean diff erences were calculated by a random-eff ects model (DerSimonian-Laird methodology). Heterogeneity was assessed by the Q statistic and review of L'Abb\u00e9 plots, and publication bias was assessed through the Egger weighted regression statistic and visual inspection of funnel plots. Echinacea decreased the odds of developing the common cold by 58% (OR 0\u00b742; 95% CI 0\u00b725-0\u00b771; Q statistic p<0\u00b7001) and the duration of a cold by 1\u00b74 days (WMD -1\u00b744, -2\u00b724 to -0\u00b764; p=0\u00b701). Similarly, signifi cant reductions were maintained in subgroup analyses limited to Echinaguard/Echinacin use, concomitant supplement use, method of cold exposure, Jadad scores less than 3, or use of a fi xed-eff ects model. Published evidence supports echinacea's benefi t in decreasing the incidence and duration of the common cold.",

            "text": "According to the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, the US population has 1 billion colds annually. Adults have between two and four colds per year, whereas children have between six and ten colds. 1 Although rhinovirus and coronavirus are the most common viruses precipitating cold symptoms, approximately 200 other viruses are also known to cause the common cold. In the USA, about 40% of lost work time and 30% of time lost from school are attributed to symptoms caused by the common cold. 2 The common cold is also associated with a large fi nancial burden on society, with about US$1\u00b75 billion spent annually for physicians' visits and another $2 billion spent on nonprescription cough and cold treatments. 3 In 2002, approximately 20% of the adult US population used nutraceuticals (herbal products, functional foods, animal based supplements). Echinacea, a collection of nine related plant species indigenous to North America, was the most common nutraceutical used and was consumed by over 40\u00b73% of these people. 4,5 Echinacea angustifolia, Echinacea pallida, and Echinacea purpurea (fi gure 1) are the most common species recognised for their medicinal value. 6 The mechanism of action underlying the proposed immunostimulatory eff ects of echinacea remains unclear. Some evidence suggests that upregulation of tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1 mRNA, which is stimulated by agonistic activity of the cannabinoid receptor (CB2) by alkamides present in echinacea, has a role. 7 The German Commission E, WHO, and the Canadian Natural Health Products Directorate have advocated echinacea use for the common cold. [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] However, there is controversy about the effi cacy of echinacea for the prevention or treatment of the common cold with some studies showing benefi t and others showing a null eff ect. Meta-analysis can be useful in situations such as this, since it can show what the preponderance of evidence in the published work suggests. A past systematic review by Melchart and colleagues 13 concluded that echinacea preparations from the aerial part of the plant were eff ective for the treatment of colds but the evidence for the prevention of a cold was lacking. 13 It is important to note, however, that this review excluded studies using an experimental rhinovirus infection and echinacea preparations with supplements, and it did not include a more recent study by Turner and colleagues. 14 We therefore did a meta-analysis evaluating the eff ect of echinacea on the incidence and duration of the common cold in randomised placebo-controlled studies.",

[22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] As such, an analysis of benefi t using these two products was done in a subgroup. Finally, studies included in this meta-analysis examined patients who were exposed to (or contracted) a cold either naturally 13, 15, 16, [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] or through investigator inoculation. 14, 22, 31 Since the eff ect this might have had on the effi cacy of echinacea was not known, separate analyses were done to evaluate studies using natural and investigator-inoculated virus. Studies of poorer methodological quality, such as unblinded or open-labelled trials might exhibit exaggerated treatment eff ects. Excluding them might result in increased internal validity but could reduce external validity of the analysis. Additionally, the selection of a random versus fi xed-eff ect model in meta-analyses is controversial. The use of a random-eff ect model in the calculation of confi dence intervals results in wider intervals and thus a more conservative estimate of treatment eff ect compared with a fi xed-eff ect model. To reconcile these issues, sensitivity analysis was done, in which the meta-analysis was reanalysed excluding studies of weaker methodology (Jadad score less than 3) and using a fi xed-eff ects model (Mantel-Haenszel methodology).",

Eight of the 23 studies did not report data on either primary endpoint of the analysis (incidence or duration), and one of the 23 used an active control. Therefore, 14 unique studies [14] [15] [16] 20, [22] [23] [24] [25] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] were therefore included in this meta-analysis, encompassing 1356 study participants for incidence and 1630 participants for duration. Table 1 shows characteristics of the included studies. Seven studies evaluated monotherapy with E purpurea, [22] [23] [24] [25] 27, 30, 32 one study evaluated E angustifolia, 14 one evaluated E pallida, 13,16 one study did not specify which specifi c species of echinacea was studied, 31 and four studies evaluated a combination of diff erent Echinacea species. 15, 20, 28, 29 Two studies evaluated echinacea's eff ect in children. 28, 32 Five studies used either Echinaguard or Echinacin products made by one company, Madaus AG.

Meta-analysis showed that echinacea decreased the odds of a patient contracting a cold by 58% (odds ratio [OR] 0\u00b742, 95% CI 0\u00b725-0\u00b771; Q statistic p<0\u00b7001), corresponding with a risk diff erence of -0\u00b717 (-0\u00b725 to -0\u00b708; number needed to treat 6). Echinacea was also found to decrease the duration of cold by 1\u00b74 days (WMD -1\u00b744, -2\u00b724 to -0\u00b764; p=0\u00b701), as shown in fi gure 3 and fi gure 4. The Q statistic showed signifi cant heterogeneity in both the incidence and duration analyses. However, review of the L'Abb\u00e9 plot for incidence showed that included studies generally agreed on echinacea's positive eff ect, but not the magnitude of the benefi t (fi gure 5). Some degree of asymmetry was noted upon review of the funnel plots for both the incidence and duration analyses, resulting in our inability to rule out the presence of publication bias in our analyses (fi gure 6). However, when publication bias was assessed using the Egger weighted regression statistic, no signifi cant publication bias was detected for either the incidence or duration analyses (p=0\u00b764 and p=0\u00b779, respectively). Table 3 depicts the results of subgroup and sensitivity analyses. Regardless of whether echinacea was administered in the presence or absence of other supplements or nutraceuticals, substantial reductions in the incidence of the common cold were seen. Whereas the subgroup of those receiving echinacea with a supplement showed a signifi cant eff ect on shorting the duration of cold in its own right (p<0\u00b70001), the subgroup receiving echinacea without a supplement showed only a trend towards benefi t (p=0\u00b727).",

This study found an 86% reduction in the incidence of the common cold. As such, we cannot determine if the combination of echinacea with other nutraceuticals yields better results than echinacea alone. Several experimental studies have shown that vitamin C might have eff ects on the immune system. 36 Propolis, a natural resinous product collected by honeybees from various plant sources, has also been used in the prevention of respiratory infections. 37 For cold duration as the outcome, four studies 20,28-30 used echinacea combined with additional supplements (vitamin C, propolis, lemongrass leaf, spearmint, peppermint, thyme, citric acid, rosemary leaf, eucalyptus, and fennel seed) and yielded a 1\u00b73-day shorter duration of cold than placebo. Echinacea used alone, although showing a similar benefi t, did not show a signifi cantly shorter duration of cold than placebo (p=0\u00b727), suggesting that this sub-group analysis was underpowered. Comparing the results on duration of cold in the overall analysis to the subgroup analyses suggests that the benefi t is caused by echinacea rather than the other supplements.",

Of the direct rhinovirus inoculation trials, the most touted is the study by Turner and colleagues 14 published in 2005. The authors compared patients given E angustifolia equivalent to 900 mg/day with placebo and showed that echinacea did not have \"clinically signifi cant eff ects on infection with a rhinovirus or on the clinical illness that results from it\". The German Commission E has approved E purpurea at a recommended dose of 900 mg but has not approved E angustifolia. 8 The 1999 WHO monograph recommends E angustifolia at a dose of 3 g, a dose more than three times the dose used by Turner and colleagues. 38 As such, the dose used in this trial may have been too low to be fully eff ective. The previous meta-analysis done by Melchart and colleagues 13 and updated in November, 2005, 39 included 16 trials encompassing 22 analyses and showed a benefi t of echinacea for the treatment but not prevention of a common cold. 13, 39 By comparison, our meta-analysis included 14 trials encompassing 16 analyses. Although our results are in agreement with the previous meta-analysis, our results suggest an additional benefi t of echinacea for use in the prevention, as well as the treatment, of a cold. The meta-analysis by Linde and colleagues 39 assessed a cold severity endpoint, included two unpublished evaluations, and excluded studies that used experimental rhinovirus inoculation or that combined echinacea with other nutraceutical ingredients. In our analysis we chose not to evaluate cold severity because of concerns about the potential heterogeneity of the methods used for cold severity assessment in the studies. We included studies evaluating echinacea with other nutraceuticals in our analysis, as well as studies evaluating direct rhinovirus inoculation, which have the highest internal validity since the virus, the degree of exposure, and the exact time of exposure are all known. We decided to address the eff ect of these potential confounders through the use of subgroup and sensitivity analyses rather than through exclusion, which provides more information from which to make a determination of the effi cacy of echinacea. Furthermore, we included one study that was published after Melchart and colleagues updated their analysis 39 and excluded unpublished studies because data in such studies have not undergone rigorous peer review.",

            "text": "There are several limitations to this meta-analysis that must be addressed. First, the studies by Barrett 20 and Turner 14 and their colleagues used alfalfa and a mixture of alcohol beverages, respectively, as their placebo arm. Since alfalfa and alcoholic concoctions may have immunostimulatory benefi ts, their use in the placebo arm is controversial. 40 Although we agree that this may be a potential confounder in our analyses, it should be noted that if these agents do in fact have benefi cial properties that reduce the incidence and/or duration of the common cold, then this would result in an underestimation of echinacea's benefi t. Second, although the Egger statistic shows absence of publication bias, our funnel plot shows asymmetry, suggesting that the potential for publication bias cannot be eliminated. Publication bias arises when trials with negative outcomes have a lower propensity to be published. Third, heterogeneity was present in our meta-analysis; however, the L'Abb\u00e9 plot shows that the heterogeneity is a result of studies' disagreement in the magnitude, but not the direction, of echinacea's benefi t. Furthermore, after doing various subgroup analyses to assess the eff ect of clinical heterogeneity, echinacea maintained signifi cant eff ects on the reduction of cold incidence and duration. Finally, this analysis focuses on the effi cacy but not the safety of echinacea. Although adverse events with echinacea are not commonly reported, gastrointestinal upset and rash have been reported. 6 Much more work needs to be done to elucidate the safety of prolonged therapy since its eff ect on the rate-corrected QT interval, blood pressure, and other safety parameters is not well known. Of note, echinacea is a human cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme inhibitor so the potential for drug interactions also needs to be assessed. 41",
