Human serum from a single patient with laboratory confirmed MERS-CoV infection was used as the positive control serum. The positive control serum was collected from the first imported case of MERS-CoV into the United States during the case investigation, with a neutralizing titer of 320. A laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV patient serum sample and a panel of human serum with confirmed high neutralizing antibody titers to human coronaviruses 229E, HKU1, OC43, NL63 were used in this study to evaluate VSV-MERS-CoV-S particle based neutralization assay for potential cross neutralization. A total of 52 human sera samples from MERS-CoV-infected patients in Saudi Arabia were used to examine equivalencies. The scale bar shows the genetic distance as nucleotide substitutions per site. Each specimen label includes: accession number, city and country of collection, patient number (e.g. 040), day of collection",

            "text": "A codon-optimized S gene was designed according to published MERS-CoV genome sequence Florida strain (GenBank accession number: KJ829365.1), synthesized by GeneScript and sub-cloned into pCAGGS 2.0 eukaryotic expression vector to construct pCAGGS-MERS-FL-S. Generation of VSV-MERS-CoV-S pseudovirus particles was performed as previously described (3). Briefly, BHK-21 cells were transfected with pCAGGS plasmid encoding MERS-CoV-FL-S (pCAGGS-MERS-FL-S), VSV-G (pCAGGS-VSV-G), or pCAGGS-empty vector (pCAGGS-EV) with Lipofectamine 2000 (Life Technologies). At 24 hours post-transfection, cells were infected with pVSV\u0394G*-G-Luciferase at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 5. Supernatants containing pseudoparticles were harvested 24 hours later and aliquots were stored at \uf02d80\u00b0C. Titration of VSV-MERS-CoV-S Pseudovirus Particles Pseudovirus particles titers were determined in Vero cells. Vero cells were infected in serum free Dulbecco's Modified Essential Medium (DMEM) (Life Technologies/ GIBCO) containing 1X penicillin/streptomycin (p/s) (Sigma), in triplicate wells of 96-well black and white (B&W) tissue culture treated plates (Perkin-Elmer) with 50 \u03bcL of 5-fold serial dilutions of Page 3 of 15 pseudoparticles. After 1 hr adsorption, the inoculums were removed, replaced with fresh DMEM containing 10% FBS (Life Technologies/ GIBCO), and 1X (p/s) (Sigma) media, and incubated at 37\u00b0C. At 24 hr post inoculation, luciferase activity was determined using the Luciferase Assay Kit (Promega, Inc) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The titer of VSV-MERS-CoV-S pseudovirus was defined as the highest dilution which gave rise to 105 relative luciferase units. For titration of VSV-MERS-CoV-S pseudovirus particles, the pCAGGS plasmids encoding vesicular stomatitis virus recombinant G and the empty vector (EV) pCAGGS-EV was used to generate VSV-G pseudovirus particles and pseudovirus particles without heterologous protein (EV) as positive and negative controls respectively. Pseudotype Neutralization Assay Briefly, Vero cells were seeded in 96-well black and white (B&W) tissue culture treated plates (Perkin-Elmer) 1 day before infection. Human sera samples were heat inactivated at 56\u00b0C for 30min, and diluted as 2-fold serial dilutions beginning with an initial dilution of 1:40 in serum free Dulbecco's Modified Essential Medium (DMEM) (Life Technologies/ GIBCO) containing 1X penicillin/streptomycin (p/s) (Sigma). Two hundred \u03bcL of each serum dilution were mixed thoroughly with 105 (relative luciferase units) equivalent VSV-MERS-CoV-S pseudovirus particles diluted to 200 \u03bcL and incubated at 37\u00b0C under a 5% CO2 atmosphere for 1 hour. One hundred \u03bcL of the pseudovirus particle-serum mixtures were transferred onto Vero cell monolayers and were incubated at 37\u00b0C under a 5% CO2 atmosphere for 1 hour. After adsorption, 100 \u00b5l of Dulbecco's Modified Essential Medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Life Technologies/ GIBCO), and 1X penicillin/streptomycin (p/s) (Sigma) was added and incubated at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2 for 23 hrs. At 24 hours post-inoculation, luciferase activity was determined using the Luciferase Assay Kit (Promega, Inc) according to the manufacturer's instructions. This assay was performed in triplicate. To calculate neutralization, luciferase activity from each serial diluted human sera sample were normalized to pNHS. Neutralization was calculated as: (Average RLU value of pNHS -Average RLU value with test serum/Average RLU value of pNHS) X 100. Endpoint reciprocal dilutions were set as the highest dilution of the test serum sample where an 80% decrease in RLU was observed. Serum samples that failed to show at least 80% decrease at the 1:40 initial Page 4 of 15 dilution were considered negative. Positive and negative control serum were included to validate the assay. Appendix Phylogeny of MERS-CoV full genome sequences. Phylogenetic analysis of the MERS-CoV genomes obtained from 14 patients in our study and 261 previously published sequences available in GenBank. The NRC-2015 (or lineage 5) subclade is repositioned for clarity. Whole genome sequences obtained in this study are marked with solid red circles. The tree was constructed by the program MrBayes v3.2.6 under a general time-reversible (GTR) model of nucleotide substitution with 4 categories of \u03b3-distributed rate heterogeneity and a proportion of invariant sites (GTR+4 + I). Cladecredibility values \u226570% are indicated above the respective nodes. Numbers in brackets following some strain identifiers are the number of identical sequences with the same location and sample collection time.",
