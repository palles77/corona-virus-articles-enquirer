BLItz is a versatile protein analysis instrument that performs rapid identification, quantitation and characterization of expressed proteins from a very low volume of sample. BLItz has the advantage of analyzing unmodified proteins, thus eliminating potential perturbation of the interactions being studied, and avoiding the time-consuming and expensive steps required by the use of labels. BLItz is rapidly gaining popularity as a reliable, yet simple method for analyzing proteins, antibodies and other biomolecules. This presentation provides an overview discussing BLItz, its applications, hardware and software features and Dip and Read biosensors. Detailed knowledge of molecular interactions is important for unraveling biological processes involved in signaling, activation, and regulation. The ability to observe these processes at the molecular level using biophysical techniques facilitates methods for intervention, particularly if these processes are involved in disease. This presentation will discuss specific signaling cascades and demonstrate how Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC), Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC), and Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) have been used to characterize binding interactions, determine active concentrations, and indicate thermal stability. Assay design and methodology will be highlighted. Various signaling pathways of note will be cited during the presentation. The following is a summary of insights gained by employing both calorimetry and SPR technologies. First, the mechanism of action of how TCR-pMHC complexes dictate T cell response will be investigated using ITC. Next, mutagenesis studies of papain-like cysteine proteinases by SPR will demonstrate that active concentration analysis can increase confidence in kinetic values. Small molecule inhibitor screening of Human Poly-(ADP-ribose)-polymerases (PARPs) via SPR has led to the discovery of possible binders specific for PARP 15. Lastly, epidermal growth factor-like calcium binding and domain stabilization can be quantified using ITC and DSC. Alternative inclusion of exons increases the functional diversity of proteins. Among alternatively spliced exons, tissue-specific exons play a critical role in maintaining tissue identity. This raises the question of how tissuespecific protein-coding exons influence protein function. Here, we investigate the structural, functional, interaction and evolutionary properties of constitutive, tissue-specific and other alternative exons in human. We find that tissue-specific protein segments often contain disordered regions, are enriched in post-translational modification sites and frequently embed conserved binding motifs. Furthermore, genes containing tissuespecific exons tend to occupy central positions in interaction networks, display distinct interaction partners in the respective tissues and are enriched in signaling, development and disease genes. Based on these findings, we propose that tissue-specific inclusion of disordered segments that encode binding motifs rewires interaction networks and signalling pathways.",

Intrinsic disorder in proteins is increasingly being recognized as biophysically and biologically important. However, the structural complexity of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) raises challenges and the need for new tools for such studies. Along these lines, I will discuss our use of single-molecule tools to study dynamic structural features of a couple of IDP systems that are important in biology and health. We obtained novel insights into protein dynamics and the complex Macromolecular traffic between the nucleus and cytoplasm of cells is mediated by karyopherins and is gated at nuclear pores (NPCs) by intrinsically-disordered proteins featuring phenylalanine-glycine repeats-the FG nucleoporins. Despite their dynamic nature, we find that these FG nups adopt distinct categories of disordered structure with unique functions. Some are collapsedcoil globules that stick to each via FG repeats, and others are highly-extended coils that repel each other.",

            "text": "Remarkably, these structures are segregated within FG nups and at NPCs to create a quaternary gating structure that appears suspended in the middle of the nuclear pore termed the transporter or plug. We describe how this 'ghostly' structure, whose existence has been debated for decades, is naturally formed by more than one hundred intrinsically-disordered proteins acting collectively. We will focus the discussion on how the distinct categories of disordered structures serve different functions in karyopherin-mediated transport. This work was supported by NIH grant #GM077520. Proteins serve as switches in signaling networks and their switch-like behavior is often controlled by inputs such as ligand binding, post-translational modification, and light irradiation. Disordered proteins and domains, which are prevalent in eukaryotic proteomes, often serve as hubs within signaling networks. Motifs within disordered protein regions mediate their multifarious interactions, and these interactions are often regulated by post-translational modifications. However, folded proteins also participate in signaling networks and exhibit switch-like behavior. Interestingly, we have observed that some folded proteins function as signaling switches through transitions to disordered states due to ligand binding or post-translational modification-a phenomenon we term \"regulated unfolding\". It is well appreciated that many proteins that are disordered in isolation fold upon binding their biological targets. We have observed that these proteins, in their functional, bound states, also exhibit regulated unfolding as a mechanism of signaling. We will discuss several examples of regulated unfolding from the realms of both folded and disordered proteins. Observations from us and others suggest that the biological palette of protein disorder is more diverse than currently understood and that the opportunity for regulated order-to-disorder transitions within folded proteins is a means to increase their functional complexity. RNAs and proteins share the feature that they both encode information at the level of their higher-order structure. This seminar will outline recent work from our lab --primarily focused on the mechanisms of and predictions for RNA folding --that nonetheless reveals unanticipated and striking interrelationships between RNA and protein structure. Our laboratory is blending new RNA chemistries, largely directed at the ribose 2'-hydroxyl group, with quantitative interpretation to make possible facile and highly accurate RNA structure analysis. These RNA-directed chemical and structural biology approaches share critical similarities with studies that probe protein dynamics, especially NMR-based deuterium exchange experiments. We then apply these technologies to important, and otherwise intractable, problems in biology. We have developed working models for the architectures of intact viral RNA genomes, which have revealed connections between mRNA structure and the proteins that they encode. In addition, unusual conformations at single nucleotides can dictate folding of a large RNA, much in the same way that a few peptide residues can govern folding of a protein domain. The information for synthesizing the molecules that allow organisms to survive and replicate is encoded in genomic DNA. In the cell, DNA is copied to messenger RNA, and triplet codons (64) in the messenger RNA are decoded -in the process of translation -to synthesize polymers of the natural 20 amino acids. This process (DNA RNA protein) describes the central dogma of molecular biology and is conserved in terrestrial life. We are interested in re-writing the central dogma to create organisms that synthesize proteins containing unnatural amino acids and polymers composed of monomer building blocks beyond the 20 natural amino acids. I will discuss our invention and synthetic evolution of new 'orthogonal' translational components (including ribosomes and aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases) to address the major challenges in re-writing the central dogma of biology. I will discuss the application of the approaches we have developed for incorporating unnatural amino acids into proteins and investigating and synthetically controlling diverse biological processes, with a particular emphasis on understanding the role of posttranslational modifications.",

Many of the antenna complexes and all known reaction center complexes are integral membrane proteins. This collection of properties makes these systems very challenging to study using most techniques of protein analysis. We have been utilizing modern methods of mass spectrometry to investigate these systems in the native state. Native mass spectrometry has made possible a new approach for the characterization of intact protein complexes. Topological investigations of complexes provide stoichiometry and structural information complementary to that from X-ray and NMR. With these new methods, intact protein complexes from different photosynthetic organisms can now be transferred into the gas phase and interrogated. Examples will be discussed, including the Fenna-Matthews-Olson antenna protein isolated from green sulfur bacteria (1, 2) , the peridinin-chlorophyll antenna protein from dinoflagellate algae and the photoreaction center from purple photosynthetic bacteria. Chemical labeling and H/D exchange protein footprinting methods coupled with mass spectrometry studies have also been used to investigate the larger scale architecture of the supercomplexes that form between antenna and reaction center complexes (1, 3 As a class of therapeutics, antibodies have grown from a non-existent market in 1997 to more than $50 billion in sales in 2011. It is estimated that by 2015, antibodies will encompass 7 of the top 10 selling pharmaceuticals of all classes. We will review why antibodies open up previously undruggable targets and the protein engineering techniques that made therapeutic antibodies a reality. Currently, the vast majority of FDA approved antibodies are naked IgG that rely on modulating target biology and/or engaging antibody effector functions for their therapeutic effect. We will review exciting new approaches to increase therapeutic efficacy of antibodies including antibody drug conjugates, the use of antibody combinations and bispecific antibodies, and enhancing antibody effector functions. Both apolipoprotein E (apoE) and amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) undergo self-association but differ with respect to the association mechanism and extent: apoE associates to oligomers, mostly tetramers at \u03bcM concentrations, while A\u03b2 forms aggregation intermediates prior to forming high molecular weight fibrils. As we will discuss, the oligomerization of both proteins relates to their biological function. There are three isoforms of apoE (apoE2, apoE3 and apoE4) that differ only by single amino acid changes. ApoE3 is the common isoform but ApoE4 is the major risk factor for the development of late-onset Alzheimer's Disease. While apoE was recognized early for its role in lipoprotein and cholesterol metabolism the ability to bind lipid does not appear to differ markedly between isoforms. In the brain, however, an important pathological role appears to relate to the ability of apoE to bind A\u03b2, the major protein constituent of amyloid plaques. While the mechanism of binding of A\u03b2 to apoE is unclear, considerable evidence suggests that A\u03b2 clearance, the movement of intracellular A\u03b2 to the extracellular space, may be apoE isoform dependent. We show here that apoE isoforms do differ with respect to interactions with A\u03b2 aggregation intermediates and we discuss how structural differences between apoE3 and apoE4 may be responsible for this difference. We ask the question as to whether it would be possible to find therapeutic agents that would alter the behavior of apoE4 to that more similar to apoE3.",

Thermodynamic and structural variations in the alpha and beta chains of hemoglobin allow for positive cooperativity and proton regulation to arise in a tetramer of subunits having the same \"myoglobin fold\". These biophysical principles are also manifest in the division of labor between domains of dimeric bacteriophage lambda cI or cro repressors and variations in cooperativity within the tripartite right and left operator regions of lambda DNA that control its lysogenic-to-lytic growth switch. Statistical thermodynamic modeling by the Ackers laboratory provided groundbreaking insights into the biophysical mechanisms of allostery in both these systems. Many branches of calcium-mediated signal transduction pathways use variations on these allosteric themes to respond to their molecular environment and control physiological behavior. These allosteric multimers include calcium-regulated voltage-dependent sodium channels that control essential processes in nerves and muscles. Related channelopathies include several forms of epilepsy, cardiac syndromes, pain insensitivity, and other defects in the generation and propagation of action potentials. Most channels respond to calcium via regulation by calmodulin (CaM), an essential eukaryotic calcium sensor comprised of two highly homologous domains connected by a regulatory linker -a monomeric \"dimer of dimers\" reminiscent of hemoglobin, with a physical architecture similar to that of cI repressor. To determine how CaM translates changes in intracellular calcium levels into conformational work, and how it regulates multiple isoforms of related channels, we are determining the distinct roles of CaM domains using NMR and biosensors encompassing the IQ motif region of the NaV1.x family of sodium channels. Determining the abundant states of each channel-CaM complex and the rules for transition between them will yield the partition function that governs phenotypic differences in different tissue types.

The Bohr effect refers to the preferential binding of H+ by deoxygenated hemoglobin. It ensures the efficient delivery of O2 in exercised tissues, where the pH is usually lower than in tissues at rest. Using his deep understanding of linkage thermodynamics Ackers developed experimental strategies to measure the energetics of the Bohr effect and to attempt to explain its microscopic origins. Understanding the Bohr effect is a problem in protein electrostatics because H+ binding is determined by the pKa values of ionizable groups and Coulomb and hydration forces govern the pKa values. Despite substantial progress in our understanding of determinants of pKa values and improvements in our ability to calculate pKa values from structure, this old problem remains very challenging and interesting. It is especially relevant now that it is recognized that many macromolecular assemblies are pH sensitive and that this pH sensitivity is often a key element in biological regulation. Prof. Chien Ho made substantial contributions to our understanding of the origins of the Bohr effect by using NMR spectroscopy to measure pKa values of ionizable groups in both liganded and unliganded forms of hemoglobin. What remains missing is an understanding of molecular determinants of these pKa values. This is a problem we have studied systematically by exploiting the same basic concepts of linkage thermodynamics that Ackers used so successfully in his dissection of functional thermodynamics in hemoglobin and in the molecular switch of phage lambda. I will present results from two different projects in protein electrostatics. I will describe unusual properties of ionizable groups that can result from cooperative interactions in clusters of ionizable groups. I will also discuss the highly anomalous pKa values and the unusual properties that ionizable groups can have when buried in dehydrated environments such as the protein interior or at interfaces between proteins. I will illustrate novel insights emerging from an approach that combines X-ray crystallography, NMR spectroscopy, equilibrium thermodynamic measurements, and structure-based calculations. The physical insights emerging from our studies is already being used by many groups help guide improvement For clinical applications, we need synthetic molecules with novel amplifying mechanisms for homing to diseased tissues. Activatable cell penetrating peptides (ACPPs) are polycationic cell penetrating peptides (CPPs) whose cellular uptake is minimized by a polyanionic inhibitory domain and then restored upon proteolysis of the peptide linker connecting the polyanionic and polycationic domains. Local activity of proteases able to cut the linker causes amplified retention in tissues and uptake into cells. ACPPs sensitive to matrix metalloproteinases-2 and -9 attached to dendrimers labeled with Cy5 and Gd-DOTA enable whole body magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (Olson et al (2010) PNAS 107: 4311-4316) followed by fluorescence-guided surgery.

We have developed primary murine and human neuron models of Huntington's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease as tools to understand mechanisms of neurodegeneration and to identify and validate therapeutic targets. To study these models, we have constructed automated microscopes that can identify and follow individual neurons over their lifetimes and measure factors during their lives that predict their fate. From studies of several models of neurodegenerative disease, protein dyshomeostasis has emerged as one of the best predictors of neurodegeneration. The visible protein deposits, called inclusion bodies, that are often hallmarks of these diseases are not required for cell death. In some cases, the formation of an inclusion body is associated with improved survival, suggesting it can be a coping response. Rather, intracellular levels of malfolded monomers and possibly oligomers significantly predict whether and when individual neurons will die. To complement studies aimed at understanding toxic species of misfolded proteins, we have developed methods, such as optical pulselabeling, to assess the response of individual neurons to protein misfolding. We find that neurons recognize and destabilize several disease-causing aggregation-prone proteins. Surprisingly, the extent of destabilization of the identical polypeptide varied significantly among neurons, indicating differences in capacity to clear the polypeptide. In our most extensively studied model of Huntington's disease, these cell-specific differences predicted each neuron's longevity and explained a portion of the cell-selective vulnerability to mutant huntingtin. Thus, differences in turnover capacity may contribute to cellular susceptibility to toxic proteins, and efforts to bolster proteostasis could be neuroprotective. Supported by NINDS, NIA, the Taube The conformational properties of soluble \u03b1-synuclein, the primary protein found in patients with Parkinson's disease, are thought to play a key role in the structural transition to amyloid fibrils. A recent study has suggested that \u03b1-synuclein purified from red blood cells, as well as neuronal and non-neuronal cell lines is acetylated at the N-terminus. The role of N-terminal acetylation is poorly understood but has been suggested to affect the kinetic or thermal stability of proteins. Here, we discuss the influence of N-terminal acetylation of \u03b1-synuclein on conformation and dynamics, and on the mechanism of aggregation. Using NMR, mass spectrometry and other biophysical and biochemical approaches we report that recombinant 100% N-terminal acetylated \u03b1-synuclein purified under mild physiological conditions presents as a primarily monomeric protein. We show that N-terminal acetylation has short and long-range conformational and dynamic effects in regions known to be important in metal binding, in association with membranes, and in regions known to affect fibril formation rates. In addition, we show that N-terminal acetylation not only changes the distribution of the intrinsically disordered monomeric conformers within the structural ensemble of \u03b1syn, but that this co-translational modification disfavors fibril formation presumably caused by the conformational redistribution of the monomeric protein.",

How could cellular chemistry, and the enzymes that make life possible, have arisen so quickly? All reactions are accelerated by an increase in temperature, but very slow reactions have an unexpectedly steep dependence on temperature, much steeper than the whole known rule of thumb, by which the rate of a reaction is multiplied by a factor of 2 to 4 if the reaction temperature is raised by 10 \u00b0C. For example, the hydrolysis of polysaccharides (t1/2 108 y at 25 \u00b0C) is accelerated 190,000-fold when the temperature is raised from 25 to 100 \u00b0C, while the rates of hydrolysis of phosphate monoester dianions (t1/2 1012 y) and sulfate ester monoanions (t1/2 1018 y) increase more than 10,000,000-fold. Moreover, the slowest reactions tend to be the most heat-sensitive. These tendencies collapse, by as many as five orders of magnitude, the time that would have been required for early chemical evolution in a warm environment. The sensitivity of slow reactions to temperature also suggests some likely properties of an evolvable catalyst and a plausible scenario for its evolution. If the catalytic effect of a primitive \"protoenzyme\" were mainly to reduce a reaction's enthalpy of activation, then the resulting rate enhancement would increase automatically as the environment became cooler on a primitive earth, quite aside from structural improvements that might be introduced by mutation and natural selection. No such behavior would be expected for a purely entropic catalyst, as indicated in the figure below. It may never be possible to establish whether enzymes evolved in this manner. However, several primitive but powerful nonenzymatic catalysts of slow biological reactions-notably pyridoxal phosphate (for amino acid decarboxylation) and the ceric ion (for phosphate monoester and diester hydrolysis)-are shown to meet this criterion, in that their effects in lowering the reaction's free energy of activation arise entirely from a reduction in the enthalpy of activation. And in fact, their effects on the reaction's entropy of activation are slightly unfavorable. These properties, consistent with an important role for polar enzyme-substrate interactions in transition stabilization, seem to be shared by most modern enzymes. A striking exception is the peptidyl transferase site of the ribosome, a relatively weak catalyst that renders the entropy of activation more favorable, consistent with a role for desolvation or juxtaposition in catalysis. These proposals, if correct, greatly reduce the time that would have been required for early chemical evolution, countering the view that not enough time has passed for life to have evolved to its present level of complexity.",

These experiments support the divergence of enzyme functions from multi-functional, 'generalist' progenitors, and thereby a mechanism of divergence prior to duplication. As early as 1930 Peters envisaged the cell to comprise \"an organised network of protein molecules, forming a three dimensional mosaic\" (1) . Despite this inspirational idea and the efforts of Srere and others, the nature of intracellular protein assemblies has been largely neglected. Recent attempts to monitor proteins inside cells have revealed that many proteins cannot be detected by in-cell NMR spectroscopy. Although a model protein for in vitro NMR cytochrome c (cyt c) does not yield an in-cell spectrum when over expressed in E. coli. In a bid to understand intracellular assemblies we have used size exclusion chromatography to investigate the interactions of cyt c in E. coli cell lysates (2). The effects of NaCl, the physiologically-relevant salt potassium glutamate, and charge inversion mutants on cyt c interactions were also studied. We show that protein stickiness and the formation of high molecular weight complexes limit the application of in-cell NMR spectroscopy. Current efforts are focused on the fusion protein DTat-GB1 and ion effects on the interactions with E. coli cytosolic proteins will be reported. The structural characterisation of low affinity protein-ligand complexes is also relevant to improving our understanding of intracellular protein assemblies. Here, we show how p-sulfonato-calix [4] arene explores the surface of cyt c by the formation of several dynamic complexes involving Lys side chains (3) . The implications for protein surface recognition will be discussed. We gratefully acknowledge the support of Science Foundation Ireland (grant 10/RFP/BIC2807) Although dilute solution conditions have served protein science well for over a century, understanding proteins function under more physiologically-relevant conditions is the ultimate goal for protein chemists and biophysicists. In-cell NMR has emerged as a valuable means to provide protein structure and other biophysical properties inside living cells at atomic resolution. Incell NMR has gone significantly advances recently, but its application is still limited due to the lack of high resolution NMR spectra. The resolution of in-cell NMR spectrum is poor for many proteins, mainly due to the sample inhomogeneity, the size limitation (<30 kDa ) of solution NMR, the huge background signals from other molecules inside cells and the cellular effects on protein dynamics. Here, we first examine critical parameters for the resolution of in-cell NMR spectroscopy, then we use 19F NMR to measure the cellular associated dynamics and the apparent viscosity in Escherichia Coli cytoplasm .",

The method is based on the finding that natural proteins encode structural elements that rigidify functional sites, precluding rearrangements that might lead to reduced affinity and off-target binding. Initial experimentally determined affinities of the designed proteins to their targets were low, requiring optimization through experimental affinity maturation. We have now identified similar interaction domains from several other regulatory proteins -including some LIM-homeodomain proteins thereby setting up alternate complexes using the same domains. Despite very low levels of sequence identity, these interaction domains appear to bind the identical faces of their targets in a very similar manner. We are using a combination of mutagenic, biophysical and structural studies to investigate how these proteins target subsets of partners in an apparently specific way, how they build up cell specific transcription and other regulatory complexes, and are trying to exploit differences in binding preferences to regulate complex formation.",

An impressive array of quantitative measurements now make it possible to query the transcription process in exquisite detail and as a result have raised the bar on what it means to understand transcription.

Instead, recent discoveries have identified factors directly involved in targeting these proteins to the ER. In yeast, these proteins form the GET pathway.

IAPP is one of the most aggressive amyloidogenic naturally occurring sequences, forming amyloid even more rapidly than the abeta polypeptide. IAPP has been identified in all mammalian species examined and is a member of the calcitonin-like family of peptides. IAPP is secreted in response to the same stimuli that lead to insulin secretion and acts as an endocrine partner to insulin, but aggregates, via an unknown mechanism, to form islet amyloid in type-2 diabetes. Aggregates of the human polypeptide are toxic to cultured beta-cells, suggesting that IAPP amyloid or the process of amyloid formation by IAPP contributes to islet beta-cell death in type 2 diabetes. Increasing evidence argues that IAPP amyloid formation also plays an important role in the failure of islet cell grafts in islet transplantation. The mechanism of IAPP toxicity is not known and the nature of the toxic species produced during IAPP amyloid formation is still unresolved. New fluorescence probes and two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy are being used along with more conventional biophysical methods to elucidate the mechanisms of IAPP self assembly and to probe the mode of action of compounds which inhibit amyloid formation and which remodel preformed IAPP amyloid.

This facilitates collecting single-molecule trajectories from individual molecules with minimal perturbation. We employed this method to characterize the folding reaction of a three-domain protein, adenylate kinase (AK). We measured several single-molecule data sets, each taken at a different concentration of a chemical denaturant and containing ~1000 trajectories. Transitions between intermediate states of the protein were clearly seen in the trajectories. We then used hidden Markov modeling to analyze the trajectories, identify metastable states and extract the rates of interconversion between them. Six metastable states were found on AK's folding landscape, and we could delineate the most probable pathways connecting them.",

The M2 protein of the influenza virus, which forms a drug-sensitive tetrameric proton channel in the virus envelope, provides an especially illuminating case of the sensitivity of membrane protein structure to the environment. We describe our recent studies, using magic-angle-spinning solid-state NMR spectroscopy, to determine the conformation and dynamics of the M2 transmembrane (TM) domain bound to lipid bilayers. SSNMR chemical shifts, internuclear distances and dynamic order parameters indicate that the proton-selective residue, a TM histidine, forms a CH-\u03c0 stacked tetrad at high pH, which obstructs proton current. But at low pH the four histidines are pushed apart due to backbone conformational changes, and undergo small-angle reorientations on the microsecond timescale with an activation energy that is consistent with the proton conduction barrier. 15N NMR spectra directly show histidine-water proton exchange on the same timescale as the ring motion, indicating that M2 conducts protons by a shuttling mechanism rather than a water-wire mechanism. The four pKa's of the histidine tetrad were determined and gave quantitative estimates of the relative single-channel conductivity of the various charged states. M2 is the target of the antiviral drug, amantadine. To elucidate the inhibition mechanism, we have determined the binding site of amantadine through protein-drug distance measurements and chemical shift perturbation. The results indicate that a high-affinity, pharmacologically relevant, binding site exists in the N-terminal channel pore, while a previously proposed binding site on the lipid-facing surface of the protein has low affinity and is occupied only when the drug is in excess. Interestingly, the pore-binding site can be lost under very high membrane curvature, which is prevalent in detergent micelles. The result shows the importance of the solvent environment on M2 structure. In addition to amantadine, paramagnetic Cu(II) also inhibits M2, but in a different way, as elucidated by paramagnetic relaxation NMR. This suggests that it may be possible to develop new drugs to inhibit amantadine-resistant M2 variants, by targeting the Cu(II) binding site.",

The second involves PRC1 (MAP65/Ase1), a nonmotor microtubule crosslinking protein required for spindle midzone formation and successful cytokinesis in eukaryotes. I will discuss our findings from biophysical and structural studies that suggest PRC1 functions as a dynamic tracker of antiparallel microtubule overlap, analogous to +TIP proteins that track plus-ends of growing microtubules. This functional specialization in a non-motor microtubule-associate protein could help 'mark' nano-scale geometric features in self-organizing cytoskeletal networks.

            "text": "Center for Systems and Synthetic Biology, University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX One of the basic tenets of synthetic biology posits that the transcriptional and translational regulatory elements, enzymes, and even whole organisms can be reduced to a series of interacting, programmable parts similar to the components on a printed circuit board. However, this level of programmability is similar to saying that ENIAC was programmable because it had lots and lots of different vacuum tubes. While at some level this is true, this level of biological abstraction is ultimately a kludge. One of the shortcomings in this line of thinking is the non-programmable nature of interactions between proteins and to a lesser extent the interactions between proteins and nucleic acids. Since proteins are the biomolecular workhorses of the cell the ability to program their interactions with one another could prove useful in developing novel biochemical and regulatory pathways within a cell. However, in order for synthetic biology to be a discipline that incorporates elements of actual programmability, it must learn from the only biomolecules that are capable of anything akin to programmability: nucleic acids. However, nucleic acid machines (ribozymes) are not nearly robust enough to enable modern metabolism (proteins won this war about 3 billion years ago), therefore imbuing proteins with the ability to function in a programmable fashion similar to nucleic acids would advance the field of synthetic biology and facilitate programming at the organismal level. The Ellington lab has undertaken to engineer aminoacyl tRNA synthetases to incorporate four additional amino acids into the genetic code with novel nucleobase sidechains encoding G, A, T, and C. Progress towards this goal includes the development of novel, orthogonal amino acyl tRNA synthetase:tRNA pairs, the development of new selection systems for these orthogonal pairs, and the use of computational design to engineer aminoacyl tRNA synthetase variants with basal activities towards these novel nucleobase amino acid substrates. These advances have been abetted by access to (and control of) in-house high-throughput DNA synthesis capabilities. For example, we have been able to 'fab' a variety of genes and circuits, and quickly express them both in vitro and in vivo. As new amino acids are introduced into the genetic code, the organism must be accommodated to accept these amino acids on a proteome-wide basis. Older work from our and other labs suggests this is far from a trivial process. Unsurprisingly, many of the aminoacyl tRNA synthetase variants that we have created have profound fitness effects, including eliminating themselves because of cross-charging of tRNAs or cross-utilization of amino acids. In the end, though, the payoffs from empowering proteins to function like nucleic acids should be great. Chargoff's rules for nucleotide base-pairing as instantiated in DNA nanotechnology has given us some indication of what can be achieved through rule-based programmability. Complex structures can be generated from simple architectures. In addition, we have shown that programmable reaction diffusion networks can be created that allow nanoscale reactions to play out at a level visible to the naked eye. We envision similar 'amorphous computations' will be possible into the future with proteins and cells. Systematic affinity purification combined with mass spectrometry analysis of N-and C-tagged cytoplasmic Hsp70/Hsp110 chaperones was used to identify new roles of Hsp70/Hsp110 in the cell. This allowed the mapping of a chaperone-protein network consisting of 1227 unique interactions between the 9 chaperones and 473 proteins, and highlighted roles for Hsp70/Hsp110 in 14 broad biological processes. Using this information, we uncovered an essential role for Hsp110 in spindle assembly and, more specifically, in modulating the activity of the widely conserved kinesin-5 motor Cin8. The role of Hsp110 Sse1 as a nucleotide exchange factor for the Hsp70 chaperones Ssa1/Ssa2 was found to be required for maintaining the concentration gradient of kinesin-5 motors within the spindle, which is, subsequently, required for bipolar spindle assembly in S-phase. The data suggest a model whereby the Hsp70/ Hsp110 chaperone complex modulates the directionality of Cin8 movement on microtubules by affecting Cin8 oligomeric state. Small heat shock proteins (sHSPs) are intimately linked to protein homeostasis and cell survival under conditions of stress. sHSPs act at an early stage of the stress response, serving as \"holdases\"-ATPindependent protein chaperones that recognize partly unfolded, aggregation-prone proteins and maintain these as soluble species to promote cell survival.",

Conversely, overexpression of the human sHSPs \u03b1B-crystallin or HSP27 in cancer cells confers resistance to chemotherapy and is correlated with poor clinical outcomes. Despite a growing appreciation for the importance of sHSPs, an understanding of how they perform their cellular functions has been stymied by a lack of structural information. Progress has been limited by the fact that the proteins exist as dynamic oligomeric assemblies that resist crystallization and are too large for conventional solution-state NMR. We used solution-NMR and solid-state magic-angle spinning NMR, small angle x-ray scattering, and single particle electron microscopy to determine the first atomic-level model of a mammalian sHSP oligomer, \u03b1B-crystallin (\"\u03b1B\"). The model of an \u03b1B 24-mer suggests ways in which the distribution of oligomeric species observed by tandem mass spectrometry (24-mers to 32-mers) are assembled. A second challenge in the study of sHSPs has been the difficulty in detecting weak, transient interactions involving aggregation-prone proteins. We will present results in which client/sHSP interactions are detected by NMR, providing the first residue-level information regarding a mode of recognition by sHSPs.",

This work was made possible through funding from the National Science Foundation. Despite many histidine-rich proteins (motifs) are found to exert important physiological functions in metabolism, a systematic and comprehensive study of the distribution and the potentially conserved functions are overlooked. Herein, we examine a representative set of 675 prokaryotic genome sequences, to map the distribution of histidine (His)-rich proteins (motifs) in the prokaryotic genomes and inspect their physiological functions. Statistically HRMs are essentially absent from host-associated species but present with high frequency in the genomes of relatives of Rhizobiales and Burkholderiales, which were mostly found in the soil, indicating a close connection between the biased gene distribution of HRMs and the similar environmental habitats of the prokaryotes. The majority (96%) of the identified HRM-containing proteins with annotated function are involved in metal homeostasis, participating in metal uptake, the metal centre incorporation and metal efflux. The conserved function of HRMs suggests that the enrichment of histidine in the gene sequence was probably due to positive selection and reasonably it could confer service for the cell habitation. Furthermore, we investigate the in vivo metal susceptibility of a global His-rich protein with an extremely high content of histidine and found they partially protect the host cells against the metal toxicity and the cellular metal content in the host cells are 3-5 fold higher than control groups, which implies the His-rich protein are coordinated to the free toxic free metal ions so as to behavior like a metal ions \"sponge\". We propose the detoxification function of HRMs supports the cells to survive in soils and sediments with high concentration of toxic free metal ions and that is the reason the high occurrence of HRMs in the genomes of prokaryotes which habitat in the soils. Our results unveiled the relationship between the gene distribution of HRMs and the conserved functions.

We present a systematic sequence analysis of the C-termini of archaeal AAA ATPases, uncovering the presence of the proteasome-interaction motif in AAA proteins of the BphI-BphJ is an aldolase-dehydrogenase complex from Burkholderia xenovorans LB400, a bacterium which is able to degrade polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). BphI, the aldolase, cleaves 4-hydroxy-2oxoacids to pyruvate and an aldehyde while BphJ, the dehydrogenase, transforms the aldehyde to acyl-CoA using NAD+ and CoA as cofactors. This complex is able to channel aldehyde from the active site of the aldolase directly to the dehydrogenase without export to the bulk solvent. This process, known as substrate channeling, is beneficial to the cell as it sequesters the reactive, toxic and volatile aldehyde and overcomes the high Km of exogenous aldehyde ensuring conversion to a CoA ester. It has previously been shown that acetaldehyde, the enzyme's native substrate, can be channeled with 95% efficiency while aldehydes up to 6 carbons long can be channeled with greater than 80% efficiency. Residues in the aldolase which are important for channeling have previously been identified and a mechanism has been proposed. In addition, it has been shown that the aldolase is activated by the dehydrogenase when in the presence of dehydrogenase cofactors. Here, residues in the dehydrogenase suspected of being involved in channeling are being investigated. The crystal structure of a homologous enzyme complex implicate three hydrophobic residues located at the exit of the channel as gating residues, regulating aldehyde entry into the dehydrogenase active site. Isoleucine 195 was replaced with tryptophan and isoleucine 171 was replaced with phenylalanine in an attempt to block this gate. Asparagine 170, which was proposed to interact with NAD+ was replaced with alanine and aspartate. A 166\u00b0 rotameric shift of this residue upon NAD+ binding was proposed to alter the position of I171, leading to the opening of the channel. The substitution of I195 and I171 with larger residues and N170 with alanine led to only a modest reduction in channeling efficiency. Surprisingly I171A and N170A variants were significantly compromised in their ability to activate the aldolase. The results presented here indicated that these residues do not have a role in aldehyde channel gating but rather influence the overall reaction through allosteric activation.

First of all, a peptide conjugated with nucleic acid bases, Lmyc, was designed. It consisted of guanine peptide nucleic acid (PNA)-rich sequences for induction of DNA to form G-quadruplex structures and a switching module depending on activity of a particular protease as the cellular environment. Thus, this system would induce DNA to form G-quadruplex structures when the protease would not be expressed in cells, and once expressing the protease, the peptide would be digested and simultaneously loose the induction ability. After synthesis of the peptides by Fmoc chemistry, we checked the G-quadruplex structure induction by CD spectroscopy, etc. Then, we demonstrated the switch function depending on the protease activity by UVmelting or fluorescence spectroscopy. Throughout this study, we achieved a control system for forming DNA G-quadruplex structures depending on protease activity using designed small proteins. It is obvious that these peptides would be able to one of the promising tools for regulation of important cellular events toward cell engineering and tissue engineering. The first structure of a 4-hydroxy-4-methyl-2oxoglutarate (HMG)/4-carboxy-4-hydroxy-2oxoadipate (CHA) aldolase, a class II divalent metal ion dependent aldolase, from Pseudomonas putida F1 has recently been solved. The HMG/CHA aldolase shares structural homology, with minimal sequence homology (~25% identity), to a group of conserved bacterial proteins termed the regulators of ribonuclease E (RNase E) activity A (RraA). These proteins share a common \u03b1\u03b2\u03b2\u03b1 sandwich fold, but the RraA's are significantly shorter with their monomers truncated at the N and C-terminal ends by ~30 and 40 residues, respectively. The RraA from Escherichia coli has been observed to bind to RNase E, inhibiting the ribonucleases RNA degradation ability in vitro. A structure of a protein from Thermus thermophilus has been solved with a putative annotation as an RraA (TtRraA). However, T. thermophilus appears to lack a defined RNase E, making the proteins RraA annotation questionable. Thus, to elucidate the relationship between the HMG/CHA aldolases and the RraA proteins, we have undertaken an investigation into the TtRraA. We have shown that the TtRraA has aldolase activity, with activity and substrate specificity comparable to that of the HMG/CHA aldolase. The TtRraA differs from that of the HMG/CHA aldolase in that its divalent metal ion specificity favors Co2+ and Ni2+ opposed to Mg2+ and Mn2+ in the P. putida F1 enzyme. Oxalate acts as a competitive inhibitor for the HMG cleavage reaction in both the HMG/CHA aldolase and TtRraA enzymes. Crystals of the TtRraA cocrystallized with Co2+ and oxalate have been obtained and the structure has revealed that binding of oxalate in the TtRraA is analogous to pyruvate binding in the HMG/CHA aldolase structure and supports a common catalytic mechanism between the enzymes. Conserved residues between the enzymes provide insight into the catalytic mechanism of the aldolase reaction and highlight the evolutionary relationship between the divergent proteins.",

Coupling other proteins with \u03b1HL covalently can extend the scope of the nanopore technology. The absence of native cysteines, robustness to mutagenesis and a flat cap surface make \u03b1HL an ideal substrate for protein engineering. We have engineered a new dimer complex, (\u03b17)2, of the \u03b1HL heptamer (\u03b17) linked via disulfide bridges in a cap-to-cap orientation. We validated the composition of (\u03b17)2 by heating it up to 95\u00b0C, and by treatment with \u03b2-mercaptoethanol. The single channel electrical conductance and the currentvoltage (I-V) characteristics were consistent with a longer pore and a symmetric structure of (\u03b17)2. As compared to molecular adapter \u03b3-cyclodextrin (\u03b3-CD) binding to the \u03b17 \u03b2-barrel when added to the trans side of the lipid bilayer only, \u03b3-CD could bind to (\u03b17)2 from both cis and trans sides of bilayer, implying the presence of two \u03b2-barrels in (\u03b17)2. The kinetic parameters obtained empirically for \u03b3-CD binding and insertion in liposomes were in good agreement with those predicted by an electrical model, which also quantified the leak conductance through (\u03b17)2. We have also shown that the two transmembrane \u03b2-barrels of (\u03b17)2 can insert in two bilayers simultaneously, and small molecules can be transferred from a pico-litre liposome to the other side of a planar lipid bilayer. Vesicles have been modelled as minimal cells when used in conjunction with \u03b17 pores by allowing small molecule exchange with the external buffer.

Protein fractions (albumin, globulin, glutelin, and prolamin) were sequentially prepared from Brassica napus (canola grade), Sinapis alba, and two industrial canola meal samples, according to the classical Osborne method (OSB), based on their solubilities in water, 5% NaCl, 0.1 M NaOH and 70% ethanol. These extracts were then compared to the glutelin fraction obtained by direct alkaline extraction method (DIR) in terms of protein yield, recovery, and residual antinutritional components. The OSB method was found to be more effective for protein extraction which resulted in a higher cumulative protein yield and recovery of watersoluble protein fractions, although the DIR method produced a glutelin fraction of higher protein content or purity. Disregarding of extraction method used industrial toasted meal had significantly low protein extractability. Phenolic compounds were observed in all the extracted protein fractions although sinapine, the major phenolic compound in canola, was present only in the albumin fractions. Glucosinolate content of all extracts was below the detection limit (<3 \u03bcmol/g). The breakdown products of glucosinolates were minimal in extracts from canola grade meal (1.28 \u00b1 0.16 \u00b5mol/g or less), in comparison to those prepared from Sinapis alba meal which, in general contained higher level of residual antinutritional components. Residue-specific incorporation of non-canonical amino acids (ncAAs) into cellular proteins allows discrimination of new proteins from old; labeled proteins can be selectively conjugated to purification tags, enriched by affinity chromatography, and identified by mass spectrometry. This method, termed bio-orthogonal non-canonical amino acid tagging (BONCAT), is an attractive approach for the selective identification of proteins produced by a cell in response to biological cues. In this work we combined the BONCAT approach with stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC), to develop a proteomic technique capable not only of enriching but also of quantifying the subset of newly synthesized proteins produced during an ncAA pulse. Armed with this method, we conducted a proteomic search for direct regulatory targets of the E. coli small RNA CyaR, a Crp-activated regulatory RNA involved in cell metabolism and quorum sensing. Following expression of either CyaR or a negative RNA control, we pulse-labeled cultures with azidohomoalanine (Aha), a methionine surrogate, for 15 minutes. Aha-labeled proteins were conjugated to an alkynyl-biotin affinity tag by copper-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition, purified on streptavidin resin, and analyzed by LC/MS-MS. By comparing the relative abundances of proteins produced in the CyaR and control cultures, we identified three known CyaR protein targets and a set of 26 candidate proteins as significantly up or down-regulated. A regulatory RNA assay with target-GFP fusions verified a subset of the candidate proteins as directly regulated by CyaR. Support for this work was provided by the National Institutes of Health.",

Therefore, NO donor molecules have the potential to be effective anti-cancer agents. Currently available NO donor drugs are limited in therapeutic potential due to a lack of organ or tissue specificity and stability. These limitations have stimulated great interest in the development of compounds that can generate NO in a controlled and sustained manner. Therefore, we designed the photosensitive S-nitrosothiol drug molecule tert-dodecane S-nitrosothiol (TDSNO), with half life of greater than 3 hours depending on the photoactivation. As NO possesses tumoricidal activity, we hypothesised that upon selective photoactivation TDSNO would cause cytotoxicity with no adverse effects on non malignant cells in the absence of a photostimulus. We therefore evaluated the sustained generation of NO from TDSNO by modulating the dose of light (ranging from 0 -350 W/m2). NO release kinetics were determined by direct real time electrochemical measurement using a NO sensing electrode. Our data revealed a steady state concentration of NO upon photoactivation ranging from 0-15 \u00b5M, depending on the TDSNO concentration and the light dose i.e. a steady state concentration of 8 \u00b5M \u00b1 2 NO could be obtained upon photoactivation (350 W/ m2) of 100 \u00b5M TDSNO for 30 minutes. Furthermore we also investigated the concentration dependent cytotoxicity of TDSNO on the A549 lung cancer cell line. Our data revealed a 50 % increase in cytotoxicity with 100 \u00b5M TDSNO following 1 hour photoactivation. In conclusion, our study suggests that photoactivated TDSNO has the potential to be a promising novel chemotherapeutic agent. Recent advances in bacterial cell division research have shown that the perturbation of the assembly dynamics of bacterial cytoskeleton protein, FtsZ induces bacterial cell death. FtsZ is one of the major machineries, which regulate the cell fate of the prokaryotes. During cytokinesis, FtsZ forms a scaffold for the organization of other cell-division associated proteins and a concerted mechanism of action ensures the survival of the cell. Therefore, FtsZ is now being considered to be a putative target for the development of antibacterial drugs. In the present work, the mechanism of action of a naturally occurring naphthoquinone, plumbagin on FtsZ assembly has been studied. Plumbagin inhibited the proliferation of Bacillus subtilis 168 and Mycobacterium smegmatis cells but had no effect on the Gram negative Escherichia coli cells. Further, plumbagin induced filamentation in B. subtilis 168 cells by perturbing the assembly of Z-ring without having any effect on the nucleoids indicating that it may target FtsZ assembly in bacteria. In vitro studies with purified BsFtsZ showed that plumbagin inhibited the assembly and GTPase activity of FtsZ in a concentration dependent manner. Binding studies demonstrated that plumbagin interacted directly with BsFtsZ and the dissociation constant of its interaction to mutated FtsZ (Y273W) was 20.7 \u00b1 5.6 \u00b5M. Interestingly, plumbagin had no detectable effect on the assembly of EcFtsZ suggesting that FtsZ from different bacteria may have different ligand binding abilities. Further using docking studies, we identified the putative binding site of plumbagin on BsFtsZ and three mutants R191A, D199A and V307R were designed to explore the interaction of plumbagin and BsFtsZ. In vitro studies of the mutants with plumbagin revealed that while V307R and D199A showed resistance towards its inhibitory effect, R191A was found to be sensitive indicating that D199 and V307 may be involved in the binding of plumbagin and BsFtsZ. The study provides an insight on the plumbagin binding site on BsFtsZ, which may help to design FtsZ-targeted antibacterial agents. Cancer cells undergo tumor hypoxia in the earlier stages of growth. Hypoxic tumors generally have poor prognosis and can become resistant to radiation and chemotherapy treatments. Hypoxic tumors exhibit a high concentration of adenosine and adenosine A2A receptors. The goal of this project is to design small molecules to target the human A2A adenosine receptor and conjugate a nanoparticle, fluorescent tracer or fluorine radioisotope for imaging hypoxic tumors through x-ray, CT scanning and positron emission tomography. Utilizing molecular modeling tools on the recently solved crystal structures (PDB 3EML and 3QAK) of the human A2A adenosine receptor, information about agonist and antagonist binding can be studied to identify the residues involved in ligand binding. Other computational tools such as THEMATICS and POOL, developed by our group at Northeastern University, are two highly effective predictors of binding sites in protein structures. These tools have provided useful information to help guide specific ligand design for binding sites important catalytic and binding residues. In silico docking studies yield important information about interaction between the ligands and the receptor. Molecular dynamics gives information about the conformational changes that give flexibility to the active site. The starting core ligand structure is based on the natural affinity of caffeine for adenosine A2A receptors. Certain modifications for the addition of functional groups to the structure emerge from the modeling studies and improve binding affinity to the target. The in silico docking identifies the top candidate molecules to be targeted for synthesis. The computational studies also help to identify potential conjugation sites on the ligand molecule where imaging agents may be attached that do not interfere with the binding affinity to the target. In order to validate the docking method, functional binding assays (in vitro and in vivo) were performed on a selected set of small molecules to identify the best binding ligands. The compound that gave the best results will be conjugated to a fluorescent tracer or fluorine radioisotope for further investigation in imaging studies. This work is supported in part by the NSF MCB division and by an NSF-GRFP. Since the discovery of antibiotics in the 1920's there has been an increase in bacterial resistance to antimicrobials, which has resulted in a struggle to develop antimicrobials at a faster rate than bacterial resistance. Our goal is to design and optimize a system for screening potential inhibitors for two E. coli enzyme systems: Tryptophan Synthase (TrpS) and Indole-3-Glycerol Phosphate Synthase (IGPs). These enzymes are part of the TIM-barrel family of proteins that share an eight-stranded (beta/alpha) motif that is found in 10% of all proteins. TrpS and IGPs are located within the tryptophan biosynthetic pathway, which is found in plants and bacteria (but not humans) for producing the aromatic amino acid tryptophan. Gene knockout studies in the laboratory have shown that bacteria require tryptophan for survival in minimal growth media. Inhibitors designed against these enzymes should have relatively minute side effects since humans do not possess enzymes from this pathway. IGPs is found near the end of the tryptophan biosynthetic pathway and functions to convert (1-(2-carboxyphenylamino)-1deoxy-D-ribulose 5-phosphate) into indole-3-glycerol phosphate. TrpS is a bifunctional enzyme that converts indole-3-glycerol phosphate to tryptophan. The \u03b1 subunit of TrpS converts indole-3-glycerol phosphate (created from IGPs) into indole, while the \u03b2 subunit combines the indole ring with serine to form tryptophan. We have expressed and purified both TrpS and IGPs using a pET expression system and have designed two 96 well plate in vitro assays to assess activity for both systems and screen effects of inhibitors. We have also incorporated computational modeling software for quick screening of the binding capability of potential inhibitor compounds.",

PC is a biotin-dependent, anaplerotic enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of pyruvate to oxaloacetate (OAA). Modulation of PC activity may have clinical applications: a drug used to inhibit or activate PC may be useful in the treatment of cancer, type II diabetes, or other metabolic disorders. In addition, there are no known potent and specific PC activators or inhibitors; either, if discovered, would be a valuable research tool. We have designed a fixed-time, colorimetric assay based on the chemical reaction between oxaloacetate and the diazonium salt Fast Violet B (FVB). FVB couples with OAA to produce a complex that is a chromophore at 530 nm. The formation of this complex, as measured by absorbance at this wavelength, is linear with respect to OAA concentration. This assay is a quantifiable measure of OAA formed in the PC reaction, and thus it may be used to screen PC activity in the presence of potential activators or inhibitors. The assay format comprises four steps before measurement: 1) a 10-minute, forward PC reaction, 2) enzyme inactivation at low pH, 3) addition of FVB, and 4) stabilization of the FVB-OAA complex at cold temperature. The assay has been developed and validated as a high-throughput screen utilizing a 96-well plate format.",

Some crystallographic structures of these enzymes are available in different conditions of ligands; nonetheless, there are no agreement about the magnitude of the ligands-induced structural transitions and if they are meaningful to the enzyme function. We used the ADPdependent GK form T. litoralis (TlGK) as a model to evaluate the structural transitions observed in crystal structures with that determined in solution in order to understand their interplay with the GK function. To achieve this goal we employed an integrated approach including enzyme kinetics, small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and crystal structure determination. The enzyme presents a sequential ordered mechanism where MgADP is the first substrate to bind to the enzyme and MgAMP the last product to be release. This binding of ligands is correlated with the structural transitions experienced by the enzyme in solution, as observed by SAXS. In the absence of ligands (apoenzyme) the radius of gyration is 29.0 \u00c5, which is not modified in the presence of glucose, as expected from the kinetic mechanism. In contrast, in the presence of MgADP, the radius of gyration diminishes to 25.9 \u00c5 and formation of the ternary complex (E-MgADP-\u03b2S-D-glc) implies an additional decrease to 24.0 \u00c5. Ab initio models constructed from SAXS data, shows how the small domain change its position and finally occluded the active site in the ternary complex. Determination of the crystallographic structures of the TlGK enzyme in its Apo form and in the presence of MgADP-\u03b2S-D-glc (ternary complex), supports the domain arrangement induced by binding of substrates described for the enzyme in solution. The results show a sequential binding of substrates to TlGK. Binding of the first substrate, MgADP, provokes the major structural transition, in contrast with the suggestion of other authors. We demonstrated that structural transitions observed in solution, as well as in the crystalline state, are catalytically relevant for TlGK catalysis. ( Phosphofructokinase-2 (Pfk-2) from E. coli is a homodimer that catalyzes the MgATP dependent phosphorylation of fructose-6-P to fructose-1,6-bisP. Allosteric binding of MgATP to Pfk-2 results in the inhibition of the enzymatic activity, which is enhanced by the specific binding of monovalent cations such as K+. Moreover, Pfk-2 is able to form a tetramer in presence of MgATP, but this process seems not to be required for allosteric inhibition. Pfk-2 has a K+ binding site located on a loop that contacts both dimers in its tetrameric conformation, which is close to the allosteric MgATP binding site present in each subunit. In this work we explore the relationships between K+ binding and the dimer-tetramer transition induced by the metalnucleotide complex by means of kinetic assays, MgATP binding experiments measured by intrinsic fluorescence and limited proteolysis by trypsin treatments. To isolate the dimer-tetramer equilibrium from the inhibitory effect, a single-point mutant unable to reach the tetrameric state was used. The presence of K+ enhances the MgATP inhibition and was found to be independent of the dimer-tetramer equilibrium; the wild type and the single mutant show similar regulatory parameters. Interestingly, the apparent affinity for MgATP and sigmoidicity of the saturation curve for wild-type Pfk-2, observed by intrinsic fluorescence, was increased by the presence of K+, while the mutant did not show significant variations of the isothermal MgATP binding upon increasing the K+ concentration. Furthermore, limited proteolysis digestion of the wild type enzyme and the mutant unable to form tetramers, show that the MgATPdimer complex is partially protected from trypsin cleavage, protection which is enhanced upon tetramer formation. These results suggest that the binding of K+ favors the dimer-tetramer transition induced by MgATP and enhances the allosteric inhibition produced by the nucleotide in the dimeric enzyme.

Lyp is known to potently inhibit T cell receptor signaling by dephosphorylating several substrates, including the Src family kinases Lck and Fyn, ZAP70, and TCRzeta. Lyp has recently emerged as a key player in a range of human autoimmune diseases including type I diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, Graves' and Addison's disease. The basis for Lyp's involvement in autoimmune disease is a single nucleotide polymorphism in PTPN22 that results in an amino acid change from Arg620 to Trp620 in the non-catalytic C-terminal domain of Lyp. The result is an increase in phosphatase activity although the molecular basis is not well understood. To reverse the pathogenic effect of this Lyp-W620 variant, small molecule inhibitors are desired for therapeutic treatment of autoimmune disorders. The objective of the work presented here is to develop small molecule electrophiles that can function as Michael acceptors to reversibly inactivate Lyp activity in vitro and in vivo. Kinetic results show that these compounds inhibit Lyp in a time-and concentration-dependent manner under pseudo-first order conditions, and that Lyp activity does not return after extensive buffer exchange. Furthermore, the compounds appear to bind in the active site, as inhibition is reduced by co-incubation of the enzyme with a known competitive inhibitor of PTPs. Mass spectrometry data show the presence of adduct formation and digest experiments to elucidate the modification site are underway. Further characterization to gain more information on selectivity among other members of the PTP family is also in progress.",

The agonist promotes the dissociation of the regulatory subunit from the kinase, allowing catalytic activity, likely by binding at the cAMP site. To find the agonist, a series of 1364 small molecules from the NCI Diversity Set II were screened computationally using a relaxed complex docking computation. Briefly, a molecular dynamics trajectory was collected on both the PKA RI\u03b1 heterodimer and two crystal structures of the dissociated, cAMP or cGMPbound regulatory subunit. The trajectories were RMSD clustered separately on both cAMP binding subdomains, for a total of five sets of protein conformers. A total of 79 representative confirmations were selected for the docking computation. Docking calculations were performed with Autodock Vina and 25 compounds with good docking scores at all the cAMP binding sites were selected for testing. The compounds were screened in vitro for their ability to promote dissociation of the PKA holoenzyme in a high throughput LiReC assay and a partial agonist with an EC50 of 10 \u03bcM was identified. Unlike other agonists that promote dissociation of the holoenzyme complex, the compound is not a cAMP analog. It can potentially offer unique insight into the allosteric mechanism of the PKA regulatory subunit dissociation. Supported by: NIH grants GM34921 Firefly luciferase is widely used as an optical reporter both in vitro and in vivo. Despite the power of bioluminescence for imaging and high-throughput drug discovery, light emission from luciferase is fundamentally limited by the properties of the luciferin substrate. Compared to fluorescence, bioluminescence offers the advantages of low background and phototoxicity, but suffers from a restricted palette of reporters and limited opportunities for multiplexing of signals. Based on a hypothesis that links the luciferin structure to the emission wavelength, a series of synthetic luciferin substrates were created which exhibit light emission at longer wavelengths than D-luciferin, with peak emission ranging from 598 nm up to 646 nm, beyond that of any known luciferase. Mutation of the luciferin binding pocket of firefly luciferase was found to allow efficient and selective light emission with synthetic luciferins, both in vitro and in live mammalian cells. Highly discriminating mutant luciferases were also identified that have 2-3 orders of magnitude greater light output with a subset of synthetic luciferins compared to the native D-luciferin. Together, these synthetic luciferin substrates and mutant luciferases reveal that the scope and application for luminogenic probes is much broader than previously realized, and can serve as the basis for the generation of orthogonal luciferase-luciferin pairs with different emission wavelengths for multiplexed bioluminescence assays and imaging. This work was supported by the NIH (EB013270). ( (Angkawidjaja et al., 2010) . Ca1 represents the catalytically essential single Ca2+ ion (Amada et al., 2000) . Ca1 is hexacoordinated with the side chain carboxyl oxygen atoms of Asp157 (bidentate) and Asp153, the side chain amide oxygen of Gln120, and the main chain carbonyl oxygen atoms of Thr118 and Ser144. Ca1 stabilizes the open conformation by neutralizing the surrounding closely-located negative charges of lid1. Previous study had shown that by mutating Asp157 to Ala, Ca1 site was lost and the mutant did not exhibit lipase activity (Kuwahara et al.,2008) . In this study, in search of PML mutants that can exhibit activity in the absence of Ca2+ ions, we mutated Asp157 and Asp153 to Arg and Lys. Among four mutant proteins, D153R-PML is the only one that showed lipase activity upon screening with tributyrin plate and activity assays using triglycerols and fatty acid monoesters in various chain lengths. D153R also shows a partial interfacial activity, in which the enzymatic activity increased as substrate concentration increased beyond the critical micellar concentration (CMC), in a different manner compared to that of wild-type PML. By providing a positive charge to interact with the negative charges in the Ca1 binding site, D153R-PML may be able to promote the full opening of lid1 without the presence of calcium. In overall, we successfully engineered a calcium-independent active lipase by changing the negatively charged Asp153 to Arg. This work was supported in part by a Grant (21380065) Two component signal transduction systems, comprised of a histidine kinase (HK) and a response regulator (RR), are a prevalent bacterial mechanism for sensing and responding to the environment. Many histidine kinases are bi-functional, as they can both phosphorylate and dephosphorylate their cognate RR substrate. In both reactions the proteins specifically recognize each other via a subset of amino acids located in alpha helices. To understand how these residues determine the specificity of kinase-substrate interactions, we rationally engineered the interaction interface of a Thermotoga maritima two-component system, HK853-RR468, to match that found in a different two-component system, PhoR-PhoB. We replaced five residues in HK853 and four residues in RR468; the resulting mutant proteins carry out the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation reactions at rates comparable to the wild type proteins. However, when either mutant protein is paired with a wild type partner, both reactions are compromised. To better understand the role of the interfacial residues in the kinase-substrate interaction, we solved a crystal structure of the mutant HK in complex with the mutant RR. There are few structural changes outside the HK-RR interface, suggesting that two-component signaling specificity is locally determined. We also performed a systematic analysis of all mutational intermediates between the wild type and fully rewired protein complexes. These data suggest that a functional HK-RR interaction relies on proper and tight packing at the alpha helical protein-protein interface. The mutagenesis data explain how mutations in the rewired complex compensate for one another to enable a different, but equally productive, interface. We anticipate that our approach and conclusions regarding signaling protein interfaces in bacteria will prove useful in other studies of protein-protein interactions, protein evolution, and in the design of novel protein interfaces. The catalytic triads and oxyanion holes of naturally occurring esterases and proteases are critical to catalysis, but it is difficult to parse out their contributions independently and to understand the evolution of these highly optimized active sites. Here we explore the minimal requirements for esterase activity by building up artificial catalysts using catalytic dyads and oxyanion holes. We found much higher success rates using designed oxyanion holes formed by backbone NH groups rather than by sidechains or bridging water molecules and obtained four active designs in different scaffolds by combining this motif with a Cys-His dyad. Following active site optimization, the most active of the variants exhibited a catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) of 400 M-1s-1 for the cleavage of a p-nitrophenyl ester. Kinetic experiments indicate that the active site cysteines are rapidly acylated as programmed by design, but the subsequent slow hydrolysis of the acyl-enzyme intermediate limits overall catalytic efficiency, and the Cys-His dyads are not properly formed in crystal structures of the designed enzymes. These results highlight the challenges that computational design must overcome to achieve high levels of activity. A critical step in the generation of binding molecules is their selection from a naive library. When many binders need to be generated (e.g. for proteomic applications), the time required for each selection and validation accumulates, making this step into a daunting task. Each new binding molecule usually binds its target in a different way and, due to the different structure of the targets and the different binding modes, each selection has to be done independently and cannot take advantage of the information from the binders previously obtained. While a constant binding mode towards different protein surfaces is unlikely to be achieved, peptides and unstructured regions of proteins constitute better candidates as target for general recognition. It is therefore our aim to generate a geometrically optimized scaffold based on Armadillo Repeat Proteins (ArmRP), which can bind peptides in extended conformation. In this way, a modular binding mode where every repeat unit of the ArmRP is binding specifically two amino acids of the peptide would solve this bottleneck of selection processes against peptides. Two approaches were applied to construct designed ArmRP, including a sequence based consensus design and a structural based computational design. For the second approach, a combination of geometrical parameterization of natural armadillo repeat proteins and the structure calculation software ROSETTA were used. In both cases, libraries with well folded proteins could be produced and build the start point for selection against a variety of targets by ribosome display. To explore the detailed architecture of the scaffold, several crystal structures could be solved for unselected consensus design ArmRP. The structures confirmed the right handed helix fold -similar to natural ArmRP -providing a uniform scaffold with a binding surface for peptides. Dehydrogenases are potential catalysts for the production of many different compounds including chiral compounds and pharmaceutical precursors [1, 2] . Catalytic use of dehydrogenases has been limited due to the need to supply NAD(H) to the reaction in stoichiometric amounts or regenerate it [1, 2] . Electrochemical regeneration promises to be a lowcost method for regenerating NAD+. An efficient, lowcost catalytic system would require the enzyme and cofactor to be immobilized for reuse in an orientation that maintains activity. Our long term goal is to produce dihydroxyacetone (DHA) from glycerol using Thermotoga maritima glycerol dehydrogenase [3] (TmGlyDH) in an electrochemical reactor. Methods of immobilizing NAD+ were explored and kinetic parameters of TmGlyDH were determined. The N6 amino group of NAD+ was modified to introduce a terminal carboxyl group and facilitate bonding to an amino-terminal linker molecule at the electrode surface. To determine appropriate reactor operating conditions and enzyme immobilization conditions, TmGlyDH's apparent kinetic parameters were determined for glycerol, DHA, and NAD(H) at different pH values at 50\u00b0C. The Michaelis-Menten equation was not a good fit to the kinetics data on glycerol and DHA because of apparent negative allostericity, thus kinetic data for these substrates were fit to the Hill equation. The optimum pH for glycerol oxidation was 8.5 with apparent Vmax, K0.5 for glycerol, and n (cooperativity constant) of 6.0 \u00b1 0.3 \u03bcmol min-1 mg-1, 87 \u00b1 14 mM, and 0.63 \u00b1 0.04, respectively. Specific activity with 200 \u03bcM N6carboxymethyl-NAD+ (N6-CM-NAD+) was 0.028 \u00b1 0.007 \u03bcmol min-1 mg-1 or about 1% of the activity with NAD+. Mutations K157N, V44A, and I154A were generated to increase TmGlyDH's activity with N6-CM-NAD+. Mutations K157N and V44A increased TmGlyDH activity with N6-CM-NAD+ 4-and 2-fold, respectively. Combinations of mutations are under study. TmGlyDH has been characterized for use as a catalyst for DHA production, N6-CM-NAD+ has been synthesized for easy cofactor immobilization, and TmGlyDH has been engineered for increased activity with N6-CM-NAD+.

LOO-GFPs are partially unfolded in the unbound state, leading to oligomerization and aggregation. Several avenues have been explored for improving the stability and solubility of these LOO-GFPs so that they may serve as templates for computationally designed peptide biosensors. A loop containing a cis peptide bond, whose isomerization is known to be the slow step in GFP's three-phase folding kinetics, was remodeled into a slightly longer loop with all trans peptide bonds (\"all-trans\" GFP). The crystal structure of all-trans was solved to 2.6\u00c5 resolution and matches well with the designed structure. Stopped-flow refolding showed the wild-type fast and medium phases, but the slow phase (t1/2 ~200 s) has been completely eliminated in all-trans GFP. In further design experiments, disulfide bonds were introduced into two of the loop regions surrounding beta strands 7 and 8, believed to be the site of the first unfolding events according to GeoFold (Ramakrishnan et al, Proteins, 2012) , locking down these structures and potentially decreasing the unfolding rate. Surprisingly, refolding kinetics data shows that these designs, called \"C-link\" GFP, have the same three kinetic phases as the wild-type if only one loop is linked, but have a significantly lower fraction of the fast folding phase when both disulfide bonds are present. Unfolding rates are being determined. Other modifications, such as \"supercharging\" and daisy-chaining, have also been applied to LOO-GFP to increase solubility and affinity. The end result is a fasterfolding, more stable and more soluble LOO-GFP which is more readily utilized in biosensor design applications.",

Anomeric bond destabilization is a stereoelectronic effect involving transfer of electron density from electron lone pairs into an anti-bonding orbital in a correctly-oriented distal bond. Our group recently showed that anomeric bond destabilization is strongly correlated with bond length and experimental energies of hydrolysis in a wide array of \"high energy\" phospho-metabolites, including ATP and phosphocreatine. Current research follows two avenues in parallel. One examines by statistical cluster analysis whether nucleotide-containing PDB entries tend to have enzyme-substrate atomic interactions with geometries that might favor anomeric bond destabilization for scissile bonds. The second avenue uses density functional theory and Natural Bond Orbital analysis to explore stereoelectronically-mediated effects of solvent and active site residues on model compound methyl triphosphate.

This occurs due to reduced levels of \u03b2-galactosidase, leading to a variety of abdominal symptoms. The regular treatment of adding the enzyme directly to the milk is not very effective as the enzyme has an optimum temperature of 37degC, and loses its activity when stored in the refrigerator, at 4degC. The lactose therefore still remains undigested. The aim is to engineer \u03b2-galactosidase with a wider temperature profile; such that its activity would not be halted when stored in the refrigerator. \u03b2-galactosidase derived from the theromophilic bacterium, Geobacillus Stearothermophilus has an \u03b1/\u03b2 barrel structure. 10% of all proteins have \u03b1/\u03b2 barrel structures. Error prone PCR is used to introduce random errors to the \u03b2-galactosidase gene.

Changes in the manganese sulfate were used to generate 2.7 and 3.5 mutations per 1000 base pairs.

However, an inability to control AaLS capsid assembly has presented a major obstacle for cargo loading in vitro. Here, we present a redox switch for the assembly of a pentameric AaLS variant into 60-subunit capsids that resemble those of the wild-type protein, as assessed by size-exclusion chromatography and electron microscopy. The capsid assembly process involves the formation of a covalent adduct between a unique cysteine in the variant (C37A/ R40S/H41S/I125C-AaLS) and thiophenol. This modification adds non-polar surface area at position 125, presumably recapitulating a key feature of the isoleucine present at this position in the wild-type protein, and triggers the non-covalent assembly of the pentamers into capsids. Further, we have used this assembly switch to encapsulate the enzyme horseradish peroxidase, which remains active inside the capsid. The thiophenol switch thus enables the encapsulation of enzymes and other molecules in vitro, which should prove useful in the construction of novel drug delivery and catalytic systems. Cells convert a diversity of extracellular signals (like hormones) into physiological responses by activating G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) to trigger mainly G protein-and/or \u03b2-arrestin-mediated signaling pathways. This pleiotropic activity of GPCRs is enabled by their multiple distinct conformations each of which may be attributable to a specific functional state of the receptor. Many GPCRs exhibit measurable levels of basal activity in the absence of any extracellular stimuli. As a first step to understand GPCR activation, this study focuses on the conformational changes that underlie the basal activity of the CB1 cannabinoid GPCR by designing mutants that activate an inactive receptor or inactivate an active receptor. The modulation of this \"basal conformationalfunctional landscape\" by extracellular stimuli can then provide a more complete picture of GPCR activation. The GTP\u03b3S assay data have shown that mutation of the threonine residue to alanine at position 210 of the constitutively active CB1 receptor makes the wild-type (WT) receptor inactive, whereas the T210I or the L207A mutant displays high constitutive activity. We used a de novo GPCR structure prediction methodology to predict the structures of the WT receptor and its three mutants (T210A, T210I and L207A). The resulting structures, that are consistent with known conformational changes during GPCR activation, showed that a novel ionic lock (salt bridge interaction) between transmembrane (TM) helices 2 and 6 keeps the T210A mutant inactive. This observation was then used to design two active double-mutant receptors lacking the TM2+TM6 ionic lock, based on the inactive T210A mutant. The GTP\u03b3S assay data showed that these double mutants gained constitutive activity. The active L207A mutant that lacked the TM2+TM6 ionic lock was then used to design an inactive double-mutant receptor that had that ionic lock. The inactivity of this double mutant was also confirmed by the GTP\u03b3S assays. Designing active mutant forms from the inactive receptor and vice versa has provided a much clearer understanding of the critical conformational changes that occur upon the basal activation of the CB1 receptor. This has important relevance for the activation of other GPCRs and also sets the stage to understand how various ligands (from inverse agonists to agonists) can modulate this conformational landscape to disrupt or enhance receptor activation. Understanding and engineering protein oligomerisation is a long-standing problem that has been approached from various perspectives. Common to them all is their primary focus on the biophysics and evolution of protein interfaces. However, in a protein with multiple interfaces, the evolutionary constraint that conserves its interactions cannot be a simple sum of constraints on the individual interfaces -a constraint on their relative geometric positions is also expected. We describe a set of structural parameters that define the differences in protein geometry and in turn the difference of relative positions of interfaces. We find that mutations affecting inter-subunit geometry via indirect mechanisms are as important for the evolution of protein oligomeric states as interface sequence changes. This work investigates how the evolutionary dynamics of complex geometry depends on the particular structural and functional features of a protein family. Sometimes the change in geometry is brought about by changes in one of the interfaces, when sequence changes in the interface do not significantly change the interface stability but rather the orientation of subunits. In other cases, the changes in geometry are caused by changes outside both interfaces, meaning that the two interfaces superimpose well but their relative positions change. In both cases, the mutations act allosterically, in the sense that they induce a conformational change that in turn affects the formation of a distal interface. We use a bacterial transcription regulation protein family, PyrR, to probe these allosteric mutations experimentally. In this family, the difference in oligomeric state is accompanied by a prominent difference in inter-subunit geometry, but without change in the tetrameric interface itself. We reconstruct the ancestral sequence, and then use biophysical techniques and crystallography to predict a correct order of mutations that caused change in the intersubunit geometry, followed by change in the oligomeric state. Our results suggest that there is a diversity of mechanisms through which allosteric mutations can impact oligomerisation via conformational changes. This diversity should be taken into account in efforts to improve the engineering of protein interactions and in further studies of evolutionary pathways that generate them.",

Distinct positions interact to varying degrees in maintaining protein structural and functional integrity; an understanding of how individual positions in a protein may be coupled can thus provide insight on the biophysical reasons that some mutational effects are minimal, while others may drastically alter protein stability or function. We present a protocol for identifying and interpreting these multifaceted relationships, by defining the extent that side-chain substitutions are able to improve or diminish different aspects of fitness (demonstrated here on structural stability and binding affinity.) Our methodology explores all low-energy sequences and their corresponding structures, by adapting well-established computational protein design algorithms to systematically mutate a protein; we focus on heterotrimeric G-proteins, a family that is involved in many cellular pathways, and has an abundance of structural and biochemical information available for it that can be used in the interpretation of our computational results.

Sharing 40% sequence identity, these \u03b2-lactamases were used to create a series of TEM-1/PSE-4 chimeras using structurebased recombination [1] . This project aims to understand the effect of this recombination on the properties of the resulting artificially-evolved enzymes. Specifically, we investigated whether the kinetic, structural and dynamic properties of TEM-1 and PSE-4 are conserved in different functional chimeras sharing between 64% to 94% sequence identity to TEM-1. Chimeras cTEM-17m and cTEM-19m (respectively having 94% and 92% sequence identity to TEM-1) differ by only two substitutions (Met68 and Met69) neighbouring the catalytic nucleophile Ser70. The turnover rate of cTEM-17m is native-like, indicating that its 17 mutations are functionally tolerated. However, the additional 2 mutations of cTEM-19m decreased the turnover rate by more than 20-fold relative to cTEM-17m. In order to isolate the energetic contribution these two substitutions, as well as to probe for synergistic or additive effects, we generated and kinetically characterized deconvolution mutants in both the chimeric and wild-type TEM-1 contexts. Double mutant cycle analysis revealed that the immediate neighbour of the catalytic Ser70, Met69, was the main contributor to decreased turnover rate. High resolution crystal structures of the chimera cTEM-19m and a deconvoluted mutant were obtained to verify the structural impact of the Met69 substitution. The overall structure of the chimeras and the deconvoluted mutant were similar to the parents. However, two structures of the chimera obtained in similar crystallisation conditions showed different active site conformations, suggesting increased molecular dynamics. NMR relaxation experiments on a fast (ps-ns) and slow (\u00b5sms) time scales confirmed broadly distributed new molecular dynamics in the chimera cTEM-17m that were not observed in either the wild-type TEM-1 or PSE-4 \u03b2-lactamases. The characterization of these artificially-evolved chimeras demonstrated dynamic states tolerated by \u03b2-lactamases, maintaining their functionality and potentially facilitating their evolution with regard to hydrolysis of new \u03b2-lactam compounds. In general, proteins are composed of the 20 natural amino acids. However, the maximum number of these amino acids required for the creation of a functional protein remains unresolved. Thus, we tried to design an experiment to examine the function of primitive proteins composed of a limited set of amino acids using an in vitro selection approach. In a previous report, the characterization of random-sequence proteins containing five types of amino acids was studied (1) . However, there is no example describing the function of a primitive protein containing only four types of amino acids. Interestingly, it has been postulated by two different approaches that the most primitive protein could consist of four types of amino acids (i.e., glycine (G), alanine (A), aspartic acid (D) and valine (V)): 1) Eigen et al. (RNA world hypothesis) (2) ; and 2) Ikehara et al. (protein sequences analysis) (3) . So what function would a primitive protein have in an early translation system? The function of the first primitive protein would most likely be associated with the enhancement of RNA replication and the translation reaction. Furthermore, in the early stages of protein synthesis, the genotype-phenotype linking strategy, which is essential for molecular evolution, could become a virus-type, because the virus-type strategy is the most efficient for molecular evolution of a single function (4) . If the strategy of the virus-type is adopted, the interaction between RNA and protein is indispensable. Thus, we investigated the possibility of whether peptides consisting of these four amino acids could function to interact with RNA by in vitro protein selection (cDNA display technology) of a random four amino acid peptide library against tRNA. Then, some peptides were selected to interact with tRNA with low affinity (Kd \u2248 200\u223c300 \u03bcM). This shows that a primitive protein consist of four types of amino acids could evolve by the virus-type strategy in the early stage of emerging translation system. Steroid receptors (SRs) are ligand-regulated transcription factors that play critical roles in inflammation, development, and cancer progression. The SR family includes the estrogen, androgen, mineralocorticoid, glucocorticoid, and progesterone receptors, which are finely tuned to activation by their cognate endogenous hormones with high specificity. The SR family arose from a single evolutionary precursor that was activated by the aromatized 3-hydroxysteroid (3-HS) estrogen. Throughout a series of gene duplications, the reproduced genes lost the ability to bind and respond to aromatized 3-HSs, and gained the ability to bind and be activated by non-aromatized 3-ketosteroids . Currently, the molecular basis for this functional switch is not well understood. To understand the molecular basis behind this functional switch, the ancestral precursor to the modern-day androgen, progesterone, mineralocorticoid, and glucocorticoid receptors, Ancestral Steroid Receptor 2 (SR2) was resurrected. This protein represents the first protein to have lost estrogen sensitivity and gained specificity for nonaromatic 3-KS. We took a two-pronged approach to understanding ligand recognition and activation, using both biochemical and structural techniques. We show that SR2 binds and is activated by 3-KSs and binds, but is not activated by 3-HSs. Additionally, 3-KSs stabilize SR2 while 3-HSs decrease receptor stability. Using the crystal structure of SR2 in complex with progesterone, a 3-KS, we re-created key historical substitutions to reverse the specificity of the receptor from 3-KSs to 3-HSs. We showed that with two amino acid mutations (Q353E, M384L) in the ligand binding pocket of SR2 that we can reverse steroid preference from progesterone to estrogen, a feat that remained elusive using modern proteins. However, regaining full 3-HS specificity requires reversing an additional two amino acids near the D-ring of the hormone. We then wanted to investigate the mechanism behind this functional switch. We hypothesized that the basis of the increased activation by estrogen in the Q353E M384L mutant was due to the increased receptor-ligand complex stability. Chemical denaturation studies showed that the Q353E substitution conferred stability to the receptor. The M384L and Q353E substitutions decreased stability, but increased specificity. Thus, in the forward evolutionary trajectory, SR2 gained specificity while losing stability.",

In the absence of lipid, apoC-II self associates into amyloid fibrils with a twisted ribbon morphology, while in the presence of low micellar concentrations of phospholipids, apoC-II forms fibrils with a distinct rod-like morphology. Based on experimental studies and molecular dynamic simulations, a novel 'letter G-like' \u03b2-strand-loop-\u03b2-strand conformation model is presented for apoC-II within twisted ribbon fibril. Here, we map the core-\u03b2 structure of rod-like fibrils using H/D exchange measurements by solution-state NMR. Similarities and differences between apoC-II rod-like fibrils and twisted ribbon on their core-\u03b2 sheet structure are compared. We further investigate the fibril growth rate and size distributions of twisted ribbon fibrils formed by apoC-II derivatives. Ion pair effects on mutant apoC-II fibril formation and stability are also discussed. A better understanding of the general structure and the mechanism by which amyloid fibrils are formed will lead to new approaches to treat amyloid diseases.",

We have shown that backbone thioamides effectively quench a variety of fluorophores, including cyanophenylalanine, tryptophan, tyrosine, methoxycoumarin, and acridone, in a distance-dependent manner.

However, whether the condensation of the polypeptide chains is driven by non-specific hydrophobic interactions or by more specific local and tertiary interactions remains unclear. We studied the folding of staphylococcal nuclease, focusing on the condensation occurring in the early stages of the folding. This 149-residue protein consists of an N-terminal \u03b2-barrel and a C-terminal \u03b1-helical domain. Previous pulsed H/D exchange results and kinetic studies of the single-Trp variants on the microsecond time scale indicated that a loosely packed hydrophobic core comprising a large fraction of the \u03b2-barrel domain with weak hydrogen bonds in the turn region of the strands II and III is formed during early stages of folding. In the present study, the formation of tertiary interactions within the \u03b2-barrel domain and between the two domains during folding was followed by means of fluorescence resonance energy transfer. Two variants with a single Trp as a donor and a single AEDANSmodified Cys as an acceptor located within the \u03b2-barrel domain (W27/C64-AEDANS and W27/C97-AEDANS) showed an increase in the apparent energy transfer efficiency in the sub-millisecond time range. In contrast, a variant with a single Trp as a donor and a single TNBmodified Cys as an acceptor located in the \u03b1-helical and \u03b2-barrel domains, respectively, (W140/C64-TNB) showed virtually no change in the apparent energy transfer efficiency in the sub-millisecond time range and an increase only after 100 ms time range during the folding reaction. These results indicate that a specific collapse within the \u03b2-barrel domain occurs on the sub-millisecond time scale while the \u03b1-helical domain becomes structured only during the rate-limiting step of folding. Together with previous pulsed H/D exchange and protein engineering data, these results indicate that chain condensation during early stages of folding can involve specific structural events.",

The tendency of proteins to form aggregates has been quite well characterized in defined media but is poorly understood in the complex intracellular environment. Furthermore, only very few globular proteins have known aggregation mechanisms. We are developing approaches to tackle these challenges using a predominantly \u03b2-sheet protein whose in vitro folding has been explored in detail: cellular retinoic acid-binding protein I (CRABP 1) and E. coli as a cellular model. We have identified many point mutations that increase the aggregation propensity of CRABP 1. To explore the mechanisms that drive aggregation in these CRABP 1 variants both in vitro and in vivo, we determined the structures of CRABP 1 aggregates using DMSO-quenched hydrogen-deuterium exchange NMR (HDX NMR). We found the core structures of in vitro and in vivo-derived aggregates to be the same, suggesting a conserved mechanism of aggregation inside and outside the cell. We have also observed that aggregates from variants with different aggregation propensities share similar aggregation core regions, and that these cores correlate with several predicted aggregation hotspots. Analysis of the aggregation cores of CRABP 1 reveal that a possible near-native precursor visited by the protein in the absence of a ligand may lead to aggregation. Equilibrium unfolding experiments in low denaturant followed by NMR support our hypothesis that the population of a dynamic near-native species increases CRABP 1's aggregation propensity. Our data point to the potential risks of aggregation created protein dynamics.

There are numerous alternative ways of associating individual configurations into collective states, and in deciding on the number of such clustered states there is a tradeoff between human interpretability (smaller number of states) and accuracy of representation (larger number of states). We utilize a novel trajectory likelihood measure and cross-validation procedure for assessing alternative groupings of individual configurations into states, and use this measure to assess the general predictive-ness of alternative methods of grouping configurations and the minimum number of states required to accurately model folding. We apply this method to analyze the 200 microsecond MD simulations of the WW-domain (Shaw et. al.) We find that widely used RMSD-based clustering methods require large numbers of initial states and a second agglomeration step based on kinetic connectivity to produce models with high predictive power; this is the approach taken in elegant recent work with Markov State Models of protein folding(Lane, Noe). In contrast, we find that grouping of states based on secondary structure pairings and contact-maps, when refined with kmeans clustering, preserves kinetic relationships with up to two orders of magnitude fewer initial states and, surprisingly, models constructed purely from geometry based groupings can be as predictive as those produced by kinetic clustering, quantitatively and qualitatively. We use the most predictive contact map representation to study the folding transitions of the WW domain observed in very long molecular dynamics simulations (Shaw et al.) , and we observe previously Membrane proteins are essential for life. Their structures are needed to their functions. Their 3-dimensional structures are unique, in particular \u03b1-helical integral membrane proteins. Although the information of the structure is determined by x-ray diffraction and solidstate NMR, the method is difficult and takes a long time to determine them. The purpose of the present work is to predict the 3-dimenstional structure of \u03b1-helical membrane proteins by computer simulation. The procedure is as follows. At first, we extract transmembrane amino acid residue from membrane proteins. Then, the ideal helix structure is formed from the region of amino acid residue. The replica-exchange Monte Carlo method and a simple implicit membrane model to represent restrictions of membrane proteins from membrane environment are applied. The Monte Carlo move sets include backbone torsion angle for the deformation of helix structures from ideal helix form. Our implicit membrane model represents the restriction of trans-membrane helices within the membrane regions. A principal component analysis is used to examine the simulation trajectory and divide structures into localminimum free energy states. Trans-membrane \u03b1-helices in integral membrane proteins such as glycophorin A and bacteriorhodopsin are applied. In this poster presentation, we show the results of these structure predictions.",

Affinity chromatography methods that are generally employed in isolating target proteins from crude cell lysate, such as nickel-chelete, glutathione or immunoaffinity chromatography, are both high cost and unsuitable for large scale protein production. We established a novel hyper acidic tag \"FATT\", consisting of the extracellular acidic region of the amyloid precursor protein (APP). Because this negatively-charged tag makes the total isoelectric point of these fusion proteins very low, FATT-tag fusion proteins can be easily purified from cell lysate with anion exchange chromatography in one step. In addition, heterologous expression of FATT-tag fusion proteins in Eschericia coli results in robust enhancement of protein solubility. Extracellular enzymes and single-chain antibodies that are entirely expressed in insoluble forms could be completely recovered from the soluble fraction when expressed as a FATT-tag fusion. Furthermore, extracellular proteins and single-chain Fvs that have intramolecular disulfide-bonds in their native structures were successfully refolded into their functional forms using a single protocol without any case-specific condition optimization. The mechanism of this refolding-assistance property is not clear, but in size-exclusion chromatographic analysis, the large Stokes radius that FATT-tag demonstrates in aqueous buffer indicates an extended, unstructured conformation for the tag. It is likely that FATT-tag does not act as a chaperone in protein refolding, but rather, it prevents protein aggregation by increasing electrostatic repulsion over a large dynamic radius. Multidimensional infrared spectroscopy is a recentlydeveloped technique that measures protein structure and dynamics with ultrafast time resolution. Amide-I two-dimensional infrared (2DIR) spectroscopy reveals the couplings between backbone carbonyl stretching modes and reports on the secondary structure of the protein. We present a new spectroscopic method to study transient protein structure, conformational dynamics and folding based on a combination of 2DIR spectroscopy, electrostatic maps, and Markov state models (MSM) derived from molecular dynamics simulations. MSMs provide an intuitive \"chemical reaction\" interpretation of the folding process while retaining much of the structural heterogeneity and diversity of folding pathways. Electrostatic frequency maps are used to calculate frequencies of the individual amide units which are subsequently used to generate 2DIR spectra, thus providing the critical link between structure and spectra. The rapid unfolding and re-folding of NTL9, a 39-residue mixed \u03b1/\u03b2 protein, is studied with temperature-jump 2DIR on timescales ranging from 100 ns to 50 ms. A unfolding response is observed on the ~250 \u00b5s timescale and re-folding/equilibration occurs within 2.5 ms. Transient 2DIR spectra reveal a series of well-defined unfolding events, starting with a weakening of hydrogen bonds on the sub-100 ns, unraveling of the beta-sheet on the \u00b5s timescale and unfolding of the \u03b1-helix on the 100 \u00b5s to ms timescale. The experimentally-informed folding pathways of NTL9 are further interpreted in the context of Markov state models.",

Using the precision of Voronoi Polyhedra/ Deluaney Tessellations to identify contacts, the knobsocket is a 4 residue tetrahedral motif: a knob residue on one \u03b1-helix packs into the 3 residue socket on another a-helix. The principle of the knob-socket model relates the packing between levels of protein structure: the intrahelical packing arrangements within secondary structure that permit inter-helix tertiary packing interactions. Within an \u03b1-helix, the 3 residue sockets arrange residues into a uniform packing lattice. Inter-helix packing results from a definable pattern of interdigitated knobsocket motifs between 2 \u03b1-helices. Furthermore, the knob-socket model classifies 3 types of sockets: 1) free: favoring only intra-helical packing, 2) filled: favoring inter-helical interactions and 3) non: disfavoring \u03b1-helical structure. The amino acid propensities in these 3 socket classes essentially represent an amino acid code for structure in \u03b1-helical packing. Using this code, a novel yet straightforward approach for the design of \u03b1-helical structure was used to validate the knob-socket model. Unique sequences for 3 peptides were created to produce a predicted amount of \u03b1-helical structure: mostly helical, some helical, and no-helix. These 3 peptides were synthesized and helical content assessed using CD spectroscopy. The measured \u03b1-helicity of each peptide was consistent with the expected predictions. These results and analysis demonstrate that the knobsocket motif functions as the basic unit of packing and presents an intuitive tool to decipher the rules governing packing in protein structure. X-ray crystallographic structure determination observes a low-energy molecular conformation of a target molecule embedded within a periodic macroscopic crystal. Improving technology, accelerated via structural genomics efforts, and increasing access to synchrotrons are two notable factors in the radical acceleration of the process of obtaining crystals and datasets suitable for structure determination. However, any resulting structure provides a limited snapshot or handful of snapshots into the ensemble of relevant molecular conformations. Furthermore, not all molecules of interest can be coaxed into forming a crystal. Here, we demonstrate a method for crystallographic structure determination that observes the conformation for target molecules of interest embedded, piecewise, within homologous protein structures. To demonstrate this new method we have solved the structure of 21 synthetic cytochrome P450 chimeras, as well as two natural cytochrome P450s from Bacillus subtilis. We demonstrate a high level of accuracy for piecewise crystallographic structure determination with unique advantages with respect to traditional crystallography.",

Here an analysis of noise in an artificially introduced scoring function is investigated for a model of an ideal sampling scheme, where the underlying distribution of RMSDs is assumed to be Gaussian. Sampling of the conformational space is performed by random generation of RMSD values. We demonstrate that whenever the random noise in a force field exceeds some level, it is impossible to obtain reliable structural refinement. We study also the effect of normal modes on protein structural refinement. Elastic Network Models represent protein dynamics as vibrations of a network of nodes (usually represented by positions of the heavy atoms or by the C\u03b1 atoms only for coarse-grained representations) in which the spatially close nodes are connected by harmonic springs.

Additionally, more mobile residues yield higher overlaps with the required deformations than do the less mobile ones. These findings suggest that structural refinement of poorly resolved protein models can be significantly enhanced by reduction of the conformational space to the motions imposed by the dominant normal modes. Leptin plays key roles in regulating energy intake/ expenditure, metabolism and hypertension. It folds into a four-helix bundle that binds to the extracellular receptor to initiate signaling. A prominent feature that has been overlooked is the unique knotting of the helical bundle as a result of a 50-residue disulphide bonded loop through which two of the helices must thread. We term this heretofore undescribed feature a cysteine knotted helical bundle. The role of the knot in leptin function is an open question. We used a combined theoretical and experimental approach to investigate the free energy landscape of leptin in silico and in vitro together with activity assays in vivo. The N-terminal region 'threads' through the disulphide-bonded covalent-loop to reach the geometrically complex native state. Reducing the disulphide breaks the covalent-loop into an unknotted protein with less constrains in its denatured state. Even though the complexity added by knot formation is structurally important, the free energy landscape appears to be very similar. In contrast to previous reports, we find that formation of the disulphide bridge is not necessary for receptor binding and activation of the JAK/STAT signaling pathway. However, the reduced, unknotted conformation is less active and less stable than the disulphide bonded knotted bundle. Therefore, the formation of the cysteineknotted helical bundle is essential for optimal function of leptin. Interestingly, the threading is implicated in both states and the folding mechanism is overall conserved. Taken together our results indicate that the unique cysteine-knotted conformation stabilizes the protein and 'prevents' it from unfolding both by thermodynamics and by creating kinetic difficulties. Fungal infections still remain a widespread population problem, especially in hospitals. Candida albicans is the main causative agent of invasive fungal infections in an expanding population of immunosuppressed patients with associated high morbidity and mortality rate. As many strains of C. albicans have acquired multiresistance against the current therapies, the necessity of developing new anti-fungal strategies against this pathogen is growing. One efficient way of inhibiting these pathogens is to target enzymes involved in RNA maturation. The poly(A) polymerase (PAP) is an enzyme implicated in the addition of the poly(A) tail to nascent mRNAs, which plays a critical role in mRNA stability, export and translation. In order to get new insights about the interactions implicated in the selection and the binding of the nucleotide substrate (ATP), we first generated a 3D model of the C. albicans PAP. This model provided instructive findings on the interactions between specific amino acids and the ATP substrate. We also evaluated the incorporation and the inhibitory potential of a large collection of purine analogs. Surprisingly, few analogs were incorporated as efficiently as the natural substrate, ATP. Using this novel in vitro RNA polyadenylation system, we evaluated the impacts of a modified poly(A) tail on mRNA translation. First, we monitored the potential of an mRNA with a modified 3'-end encoding the luciferase reporter gene to be translated in rabbit reticulocytes and in HEK293 cells. We next mesured the direct binding of the human poly(A) binding protein (PABPC1) to poly(A) modified RNAs. Then, the stability of the modified luciferase mRNAs was addressed in vitro against a specific human deadenylase, Ccr4, and in cellulo by qPCR assays. Briefly, this study establishes a scaffold for the rational design of what could represent a novel class of inhibitors against fungal pathogens like Candida albicans.

Lp-PLA2 is considered as a risk factor, a potential biomarker, and a target of therapy in the treatment of cardiovascular disease. Several lines of evidence suggest that the level of Lp-PLA2 in plasma is associated with the risk of future cardiovascular and stroke events. The differential location of the enzyme in LDL/HDL lipoproteins has been suggested to affect Lp-PLA2 function and/or its physiological role and an abnormal distribution of the enzyme may correlate with diseases. Although mutagenesis studies suggest that a surface helix (residues 362-369) may mediate the association between Lp-PLA2 and HDL, the molecular mechanism of association is still unknown. We have now employed DXMS to characterize the interaction between Lp-PLA2 and human HDL. We have found that specific residues 113-120, 192-204 and 360-368 likely mediate HDL binding. Residues 113-120 have been shown to be important for Lp-PLA2-liposome interactions in our previous study (2). Residues 192-204 show decreased deuteration levels when Lp-PLA2 is associated with apoA-I, but not apoA-II, the most abundant protein components in HDL.

            "text": "The side-chain conformations of amino acids in the hydrophobic core are important for the protein folding and function. It is well-known that a protein is fluctuated in solution, which is critical for the expression of function. Although great numbers of static or averaged protein structures have been determined using the recent techniques such as X-ray and NMR, it is still difficult to determine the dynamic properties of proteins. The previous NMR study showed that a mutant protein of c-Myb R3, I155L/I181L, has multiple conformations, which is considered to be attributed to increasing the sidechain conformational entropy upon the mutation of Ile to Leu. This protein is a good target to analyze the dynamic property, and the role of side-chain conformation for the structure and function. A transcriptional activator c-Myb specifically binds to DNA, and its DNA-binding domain consists of three imperfect 51-or 52-residue repeats. The last two repeats, R2 and R3, are sufficient for the recognition of the specific DNA sequences. In addition to the three Trp residues in each repeat, Val103, Ile118, Cys130 and Ile155, Ile169, Ile181 are involved in the hydrophobic cores of R2 and R3, respectively. In this study, we analyzed the thermodynamic effects of multiple conformations on the stability and bindingfunction, using R2R3 I155L/I181L mutant and its control proteins. The CD and DSC measurements showed that the mutation of I155L had little effect on the stability, while the I181L mutation significantly destabilized the protein. This is in good agreement with the NMR results that I155L mutation has little effect on the tertiary structure, suggesting that the contribution of side-chain conformational entropy upon the Leu-substitution depends on the environment around the substituted site. It should be noted that the decreased stabilities of I181L mutants were mainly due to the decreased entropy change. In addition, the specific DNA-binding affinity of I155L/I181L mutant was lower than that of wildtype, which was due to the decreased binding entropy change. Taken together, upon the I181L mutation, the conformational fluctuation would be increased, and as a result, the multiple conformations are observed in the NMR time scale. The increased conformational fluctuation could increase the entropy term either in the native state or in the DNA-unbound state, resulting in the decreased stability and DNA-binding affinity. Human acidic fibroblast growth factor (hFGF-1) belongs to a superfamily of 22 fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) that have a high affinity for heparin. It is a 16kD protein, which is involved in many cellular functions, such as, cell proliferation, cell differentiation, angiogenesis, tumor growth, and wound healing. FGF-1 exhibits its cell proliferation activity by binding to cell-surface tyrosine kinase receptors (FGFRs). The binding of FGF-1 to FGFRs results in dimerization of the receptor, which in turn, leads to its activation. Heparin is proposed to have two functions: it protects FGFs from degradation by proteases and from thermal denaturation, and it induces FGF oligomerization resulting in the interaction with and activation of FGFRs. However, it remains undetermined whether or not heparin is required for both purposes. In this study, we attempt to understand the structural role of heparin in the FGF signaling process. In this context, several mutations within the heparin-binding region of FGF-1 were constructed. Some of the mutants in the heparinbinding pocket completely knocked out the binding affinity of FGF to the proteoglycan. The structural and functional consequences of the mutations in the heparinbinding pocket have been examined using a variety of biophysical techniques. Finally, cell proliferation assays were performed to determine the activity of wild-type FGF-1 compared to the mutants exhibiting decreased heparin-binding affinity. Although some mutants were less active, all showed activity. This suggests heparin's role is to stabilize FGF-1, and it is not required for FGF-FGFR signaling.",

Using spectroscopic and computational approaches, we have studied structural, dynamic, and kinetic aspects of the DNA-scanning process in which Egr-1 is nonspecifically bound to DNA and perpetually changes its location on DNA. Our NMR data indicate that Egr-1 undergoes highly dynamic domain motions when scanning DNA. In particular, the zinc finger 1 (ZF1) of Egr-1 in the nonspecific complex is mainly dissociated from DNA and undergoes collective motions on a nanosecond timescale, while zinc fingers 2 and 3 (ZF2 and ZF3, respectively) are bound to DNA. This was totally unexpected because the previous crystallographic studies of the specific complex indicated that all of Egr-1's three zinc fingers are equally involved in binding to a target DNA site. Mutations that are expected to enhance ZF1's interactions with DNA and with ZF2 were found to reduce ZF1's domain motions in the nonspecific complex, suggesting that these interactions dictate the dynamic behavior of ZF1. By experiment and computation, we have also investigated kinetics of Egr-1's translocation between two nonspecific DNA duplexes. Our data on the wild-type and mutant proteins suggest that the domain dynamics facilitate Egr-1's intersegment transfer that involves transient bridging of two DNA sites. These results shed light on asymmetrical roles of the zinc finger domains for Egr-1 to efficiently scan DNA in the nucleus.

Redox states in various cellular compartments are tightly regulated to prevent oxidative stress and damage to proteins. Endoplasmic reticulum stress, a prominent feature in pancreatic \u03b2-cells associated with type 2 diabetes, results in a reduced redox environment. The extent to which insulin is reduced within storage granules is currently unknown, as are strategies employed by cells to minimize insulin reduction and precipitation. We show in the present study that significant amounts of insulin can be reduced in vitro at the redox state previously reported for secretory pathway. As zinc is found at high levels within insulin storage granules and is both coordinated and bound by insulin hexamers, we investigated the effect of zinc on precipitation of insulin upon reduction. Zinc specifically decreased the precipitation of insulin in vitro upon treatment with DTT or the non-thiol-containing reducing agent TCEP. Other divalent cations including copper, magnesium, calcium, and manganese were unable to prevent insulin precipitation. While zinc slowed the reduction of insulin as determined by tricine SDS-PAGE, it did not prevent the complete reduction of insulin, suggesting the effect of zinc on insulin precipitation is independent of insulin reduction. In addition, zinc had no effect on reduction of DTNB. Our results suggest that zinc may be able to mitigate potential reduction and precipitation of insulin within storage granules, thus presenting a role for zinc that was previously unknown. Further studies must be completed to determine the biochemical basis by which zinc prevents insulin precipitation and to determine in vivo relevance.",

The current crystal structure of Spiny Dogfish LDH-A (PDB code: 1LDM) in the Protein Data Bank was solved at a resolution of 2.10 \u00c5 (Zapatero et al., 1987) , and from this structure the amino acid sequence was derived. Interestingly, the Spiny Dogfish LDH-A amino acid sequence derived from the crystal structure is significantly different from that of other vertebrates. Furthermore, the structure derived sequence differs to the cDNA derived amino acid sequence of Spiny Dogfish LDH-A by approx. 5% (Stock & Power, 1995) . The cDNA sequence of Spiny Dogfish LDH-A is more similar to other known vertebrate LDH-A sequences. To address the amino acid sequence discrepancies we have revisited the Spiny Dogfish LDH-A crystal structure. We have determined crystal structures of Spiny Dogfish LDH-A in both apo and holo forms to 1.80-1.90 \u00c5 resolution. The apo (space group I422) and holo (space group P21212) forms of Spiny Dogfish LDH-A revealed well-defined electron density for the entire LDH-A polypeptide chain. Furthermore the holo form revealed well-defined electron density for NAD and oxamate within the active site. The previous Spiny Dogfish LDH-A structure (PDB code: 1LDM) was found to be in poor sequence agreement, in the regions where there are amino acid discrepancies, with the electron density maps generated in this study. The catalytic centre of the LDH-A protein was found to be very similar in all structures and significant structural differences were restricted to surface loops. The Spiny Dogfish LDH-A structures presented in this study are in agreement with the published cDNA sequence.",

Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) is a powerful spectroscopic tool capable of detecting motions within this broad range of timescales using a variety of different type of experiments that probe different NMR observables. One type of experiment, called relaxation dispersion, is uniquely sensitive to the kinetics and amplitude of motions that occur within the micro-millisecond timescale that manifest themselves within the residual line-width of peaks. Within relaxation dispersion, rotating-frame transverse relaxation (R1\u03c1) experiments function by modulating the strength of spin-lock pulses to effectively quench this residual linewidth. However, the strength of the applied spin-lock pulse is directly related to the fastest kinetics that can be observed, and due to hardware limitations, motions faster than 40 \u03bcs could not be detected. Yet, motions between the globular rotational correlation time (4 ns) and the 40 \u03bcs, deemed the supra-\u03c4c range, has recently been proposed to play a role in molecular recognition (Lange et al. Science 320 1471 (2008 ). So far, it could only be accessed by lowering the temperature dramatically, thus slowing the kinetics down that they were within the detectable range for R1\u03c1 experiments (Ban et al. Angew. Chemie 50 11437(2011) ). Therefore, we have set out to exceed our view into this time window by generating large spin-lock pulses that could be used to observe faster kinetics. Using a cryogenically cooled NMR probe, a tool commonly found in many NMR laboratories, we have been able to exceed our resolution into motions that could occur as fast as 25 \u03bcs, 10 \u03bcs, and 4 \u03bcs for 15N, 13C, and 1H nuclei, respectively. We demonstrate that large spin-lock pulses can be applied without damaging the integrity of the probe nor heat the sample, and validate their use for R1\u03c1 experiments. In addition, sensitivity to smaller amplitude motions is observed, and the detection of motion within the sidechains of ubiquitin with kinetics that are within the supra-\u03c4c range is presented but slower than predicted from MD simulations on BPTI (Shaw et al. Science 330 341-346(2010) ). This technique allows for the observation of faster motions in proteins and the accurate characterization of parameters that define the dynamic process.",

Although hundreds of S-nitrosylation sites have been identified in vivo, very little is known about the mechanism or molecular consequences of the modification. Glutathione transferase (GST) P1-1 is a cytosolic enzyme involved in xenobiotic detoxification and regulation of cell proliferation. GSTP1-1 is nitrosylated in vivo under conditions of oxidative stress and is therefore a model for studying protein regulation by S-nitrosylation. Recombinant human GSTP1-1 was nitrosylated in vitro by reaction with S-nitrosoglutathione, confirmed by ESI-MS and UV-difference spectroscopy. Two nitrosylation sites per monomer were identified by mass-based sequencing. In addition, a single-nitrosylated isoform was generated by occluding one site with a ligand. S-nitrosylation severely destabilises domain 1 of GSTP1-1 and reduces unfolding cooperativity, with the effect more pronounced for the double-nitrosylated protein. Further, a folding defect is introduced, with hysteresis apparent in the refolding of domain 2 of double-nitrosylated GSTP1-1 and domain 1 of the single-nitrosylated isoform. From the unfolding kinetics, it is apparent that S-nitrosylation modulates the unfolding pathway of GSTP1-1, causing reduced (double-nitrosylated) or enhanced (single-nitrosylated) kinetic cooperativity. Despite this, far-UV circular dichroism, fluorescence and acrylamide quenching show no substantial changes to native protein structure upon S-nitrosylation. Quenching of denatured state fluorescence reveals, however, that domain 1 of the nitrosylated protein is significantly more compact than the reduced protein in 8 M urea, suggesting that the energy landscape is altered by stabilisation of the denatured-state. We are currently probing the mechanism of S-nitrosylation by transient kinetic methods based on intrinsic protein fluorescence. Preliminary results suggest that S-nitrosylation of GSTP1-1 at each site involves at least two steps, with rapid cysteine nitrosylation followed by a very slow (k2 = 0.015 s-1), essentially irreversible protein conformational change. These data reveal novel facets of GSTP1-1 regulation and expand our understanding of the molecular basis of protein S-nitrosylation and redox signalling in general. This work was supported by the National Research Foundation. Determining the positions of hydrogen atoms is essential to understanding protein structure and function. However, experimental validation by neutron or ultrahigh resolution x-ray crystallography cannot be applied for most proteins studied. We present a computational method, HyP (Hydrogen Prediction), for detecting hydrogen atom positions by quantitative sampling of x-ray crystallographic electron density maps. This method is sensitive at resolution ranges up to 1.6 angstroms, which includes 12% of all protein structures in the PDB. In a data set of structures up to 1.0 angstroms, our method detects electron density peaks at rotameric positions for 51% of 649 alanine residues, consistent with hydrogen atoms. In the resolution ranges of 1.0-1.19, 1.2-1.39, and 1.4-1.59 angstroms, HyP detects potential hydrogen atoms at rotameric positions for 56, 56 and 50% of alanine residues from a total of 2025, 1202, and 3269 alanine residues, respectively. We also compare our predictions with neutron and ultrahigh resolution x-ray crystal structures.",

We report in this study the effect of Garcinia biflavonoid 2 (GB2), a biflavonoid complex extracted and purified from the seeds of Garcinia kola and used as medicine against gastrointestinal infection and hepatitis, in Nigeria and other African countries. At an ATP concentration of 2mM, the biflavonoid inhibited SERCA1a with an IC50 value of 17\u00b5M. At a fixed concentration (40\u00b5M), GB2 reduced the maximum activity (Vmax) of SERCA by 65.6% with no effect on the affinity. We found that interaction of GB2 with ATPase gave rise to an appreciable rise in florescence at 515nm after FITC labelling of the protein at Lys-515. Thus the biflavonoid increased fluorescence intensity of the modified protein by 4.8%, 8.9%, 12.3%, 14.03%, 16.4%, 17.8%, 19.5% and 19.8% at 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 50,70 and 90\u00b5M GB2, respectively in the E2 conformation. Furthermore, the addition of 0.1-0.5mM Ca2+ did not abolish this increase in the presence of GB2. These results suggest GB2 binds to the Ca2+-ATPase both in the E1 and E2 state with equal affinity and thus may slow down the conformational transitions accompanying ATP hydrolysis by interacting with a cytosolic binding site. Keywords: sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase, GB2, biflavonoid. This research is being funded by IscU from E. coli, the scaffold protein for iron-sulfur cluster biosynthesis and transfer, populates two conformational states that interconvert with lifetimes on the order of 1 s [1] . One state (S) is structured, and the other (D) is dynamically disordered, but both play functional roles [2] . We report here that all four prolyl residues of apo-IscU (P14, P35, P100, and P101) are trans in the S-state, but that two (P14, P101) become cis in the D-state. We labeled IscU selectively by biosynthetic incorporation of [13C,15N]-Pro and [15N]-Ala. Because the prolyl residues are located in three dipeptides (P14R, P35A, P100P101) this labeling pattern enabled us to identify the spin system of P35 from the P35C\u03b1-A36N connectivity, the spin systems of P100 and P101 from the P100C\u03b1-P101N connectivity, and the spin system of P14 by difference. The 2D 1H-13C spectrum collected at pH 8.0 and 25 C, where both the S-and D-states are populated, revealed two spin systems for P101 and three spin systems for P14. To assign spin systems to S-state, we added Zn2+, which constrains the protein to the S-state, and collected data at 25 C. To assign spin systems to the D-state, we collected data at 45 C, where the protein is fully D-state. 3D HCCH TOCSY data allowed us to determine the chemical shifts of the 13C atoms of each prolyl residue. When the protein was in the S-state, the chemical shift difference (13C\u03b3 \u2212 13C\u03b2) for all four prolyl residues was ~5 ppm, indicating that they are all trans. However, when the protein was in the D-state, the chemical shift difference was ~5 ppm for P35 and P100 but ~ 10 ppm for P14 and P101, indicating that the latter are cis. Two cis spin systems were observed for P14 in the D-state as a consequence of splitting of the 1H signal of that residue. NOE data confirmed the expected connectivities. We conclude that the S/D interconversion involves a concerted trans/cis change of the N13-P14 and P100-P101 peptide bonds and that the D-state, although lacking secondary structure, stabilizes two high-energy cis peptide bonds.

A20-type zinc finger domains (A20_ZFs) in animals reportedly recognize ubiquitin, either mono-or poly-ubiquitin. While monoubiquitin recognition by animal A20_ZFs has been extensively characterized biochemically, studies on polyubiquitin recognition lag behind. An A20_ZF from A20, a protein involved in NF-\u03baB signaling, was shown to selectively bind K63-linked polyubiquitin. However, it remains elusive if A20_ZFs in homologous proteins exhibit similar linkage-specificity in polyubiquitin binding. Also, it is unclear whether A20_ZFs in plants perform similar roles. To address these questions, we employed A20_ZFs from bovine Rabex-5 and Arabidopsis stress associated protein 5 (AtSAP5) to explore linkagespecific polyubiquitin recognition by the two A20_ZFcontaining proteins. Rabex-5 regulates endosomal trafficking via its tandem ubiquitin binding domains (A20_ZF and MIU). AtSAP5 is involved with abiotic stress response in plants and contains A20_ZF and AN1type zinc finger domain. GST pulldown assay reveals that the N-terminal fragment of Rabex-5 harboring A20_ZF and MIU, termed Rabex-5(9-73), shows similar preference for linear, K63-linked, and K48-linked polyubiquitin binding while AtSAP5 less preference for K48-linked one. Mutagenesis analysis indicates that the A20_ZF domain of AtSAP5 is sufficient for linkagespecific polyubiquitin recognition. In contrast, A20_ZF of Rabex-5(9-73) appears dispensable for linkagespecific polyubiquitin binding. The dialipathic patch in AtSAP5, distinct from the conserved diaromatic patch in Rabex-5, seems to be responsible for K48-linked polyubiquitin binding. Taken together, our results suggest that A20_ZFs in Rabex-5 and AtSAP5 show linkage-specific preferences distinct from that of A20. We also establish that A20_ZF in plants participates in polyubiquitin recognition just like its counterparts in animals.",

            "text": "Physics, Nagoya University, Nagoya, Japan Photolyase/cryptochrome blue-light photoreceptors contain the enzymes that repair UV lesions in DNA by photo activated electron transfer reaction. For instance, cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer (CPD) photolyases recognize the double-stranded DNA that contain CPD. They repair these lesions by the cyclic electron transfer reaction between flavin adenine dinucleotide (FADH-) and CPD. However, the reaction mechanism has been not reserved yet. Recently, we performed a computational study on the electron transfer reaction of the CPD photolyase derived from A. nidulans. We identified an important amino acid residue, Met-353, at which busy traffic of electron tunneling current was observed (Y. Miyazawa et al., 2008) . Interestingly, we found that the residue is perfectly conserved in the sequences of Class I CPD photolyase subfamily. On other hand, this residue substituted by the other amino acid, Gln-395, in Cry-DASH derived from Arabidopsis. Cry-DASH repairs CPD lesions like CPD photolyase does; however, Cry-DASH enzymes have photolyase activity only for single-stranded DNA. Unfortunately, the electron transfer mechanism of Cry-DASH remains unresolved. Recently, Pokorny et al. detained the structure of Arabidopsis Cry-DASH with an in siturepair CPD substrate in single-strand DNA. In this study, we investigated electron-tunneling pathways of the forward electron transfer (FET) and the back electron transfer (BET) in CPD photolyase and CRY-DASH. We performed molecular dynamics simulation of the CPD photolyase of A. nidulans and the Cry-DASH of Arabidopsis. We employed an extended H\u00fcckel approach to analyze the thermal fluctuation of electron transfer pathways in the proteins for a large number of conformational samples extracted from the molecular dynamics simulation trajectories. As a result, it is indicated that the Gln-395 site in the Cry-DASH plays an important role like the Met-353 site in the CPD photolyase does. Long-range information transfer within proteins, specifically from the substrate binding site to a distant surface site, plays a vital role in regulation of its activity. Understanding this allosteric modulation of protein activity is expected to aid in designing drugs that can achieve high specificity to the target protein. Exactly how the information is transferred from the allosteric site to the substrate-binding site is not well understood. We present a novel computational method based on atomic stresses and molecular dynamics simulation for identifying allosteric sites and the respective pathways. We demonstrate the method here using the PDZ domain. Tracing the path with highest stiffness from the substrate binding site through the protein core revealed a pathway that shows significant overlap with that previously inferred from evolutionarily conserved residues, and other computational methods. The method presented here is a general approach for visualizing the propagation and redistribution of stress within a protein during a simulation, which is likely to provide more insight into the key mechanisms responsible for protein allostery. Analytical methods designed to resolve total and effective surface-interaction charge characteristics of active protein components are now commonly used as quality control mechanisms for verification of consistency in biological manufacturing processes. The charge-resolved profiles yielded by methods such as gel and capillary isoelectric focusing (IEF, CIEF) and ion-exchange chromatography (IEx-HPLC) can also be utilized in a \"fingerprint\" fashion to verify the identity of a specific protein species. These methods are also more direct and robust to variability than other analytical methods such as peptide mapping, and therefore stand as good candidates for quality release testing of protein reagent identity. For application toward identity verification amongst many (>100) antibody and antigen protein species typically produced at a single manufacturing site in the in-vitro immunodiagnostics industry, these methods must ideally display unique results, or fingerprints, for each protein species. We have examined charge-based profiling methods for potential application to both quality control testing and R&Dphase support needs. Results from gel-IEF, CIEF and IEx-HPLC analyses will be presented to demonstrate the capability of each method as a sole or complimentary method for verification of identity amongst several antibody proteins species produced through very similar growth culture and purification processes. These methods have also found use in identification of multiple protein species within an expected single monoclonal product. We will also show how changes in the manufacturing process can affect the charge profile results, and discuss how this may impact the specificity of these methods for confident identification.",

Sp1 is a human ubiquitous transcription factor involved in the early development of an organism and comprises three tandem repeats of C2H2 zinc finger motif and binds directly to a GC-rich upstream element DNA (GC box). Bidirectional traffic between the nucleus and the cytoplasm is routed through the nuclear pore complex (NPC) embedded in the nuclear envelope. Nuclear import of globular proteins of greater than 60 kDa in size is an active process that requires the presence of a suitable nuclear localization signal (NLS) and is mediated by a related family of shuttling transport factors, importins, which can recognize NLS. Although Sp1 is supposed to be actively transported into the nucleus due to its molecular mass (95/105 kDa), none of NLS for Sp1 has been reported. Subcellular localization of Sp1 was examined. We found that C2H2 zinc fingers of Sp1 serve as NLS and can recognize nuclear transport factors, importins. Possible protein interaction of the zinc finger domain was detected. Quantitative approach would be examined. [ The in vivo environments in which proteins normally function are much more crowded than the in vitro solutions usually used for in vitro studies of these molecules. Although there has long been interest in the question of how the structural, dynamic and functional properties of proteins might be affected by macromolecular crowding, there is as yet relatively little direct experimental evidence on this subject. To address these questions we are using small-angle X-ray and neutron scattering (SAXS and SANS) to study mixtures of folded and unfolded proteins at high concentrations. In earlier work, SANS was used to measure the effects of crowding on an intrinsically disordered protein, the N protein of bacteriophage \u03bb (\u03bb N), using 2 H labeling and solvent contrast matching to selectively detect the unfolded protein in the presence of high concentrations of a small globular protein, bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI). These studies demonstrated the feasibility of the approach and indicated a small degree of compaction of \u03bb N by BPTI at concentrations up to 130 mg/mL. More recently, we have carried out additional experiments with \u03bb N and BPTI and with \u03bb N and equine myoglobin, at concentrations up to 200 mg/mL. Refinement of the experimental conditions have enabled more definitive measurements, which indicate that there is virtually no change in the overall dimensions of the intrinsically disordered protein in the presence of either globular protein. These results are in striking contrast to the predictions of theoretical models based on scaled-particle theory and related treatments, suggesting that the underlying assumptions of these models should be re-examined. Aggregates of amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) peptides have been implicated in the etiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Among the different forms of A\u03b2 aggregates, low-molecular weight (LMW) ones ranging between ~2 and 50mers, also called 'soluble oligomers,' have emerged to be the species responsible for early synaptic dysfunction and neuronal loss. Emerging evidence suggests that the neurotoxic oligomers need not be formed along the obligatory nucleation-dependant fibril formation 'on-pathway'. Previously, we have reported the isolation of one such 'off-pathway' 12-18mer species of A\u03b242 generated from fatty acids, called LFAOs (large fatty acid-derived oligomers) (Kumar et al. 2011, PLoS one). Next, we have characterized and studied the physiochemical properties of these LFAOs using biophysical techniques like size exclusion chromatography (SEC), dynamic light scattering (DLS), atomic force microscopy (AFM) & analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC). We have discovered that LFAOs are a replicating strain of oligomers that recruit A\u03b242 monomers and quantitatively convert them into LFAO assemblies at the expense of fibrils. We also observed that in the presence of hexanebuffer or chloroform-buffer interfaces, LFAOs are able to associate with themselves to form larger, yet non-fibrillar, aggregates. This association property of LFAOs can provide valuable insight about potentially similar behavior of endogenous LMW oligomers in physiological environments. These results further support the fact that LMW oligomers can be generated via non-fibril formation pathways.",

            "text": "Department of Structural Biology, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA Aggregation of polyglutamine (polyQ) containing proteins plays a key role in a class of protein misfolding diseases characterized by the expansion of CAG repeats. Recent work in our lab has implicated \u03b2-hairpin formation as a critical step in the nucleation mechanism for simple polyQ amyloid formation. If this hypothesis is correct, we expect the flanking sequences of the polyQ sequence might have significant effects on aggregation nucleation due to their stabilizing or destabilizing effects on \u03b2-hairpin/nucleus formation. In our standard sequence motif for simple polyQ aggregation studies, we add flanking pairs of Lys residues to the N-and C-terminus of the polyQ in order to improve solubility and allow in vitro studies. These Lys residues might be expected, however, to introduce some destabilizing charge repulsion in a \u03b2-hairpin conformation and hence modify kinetics and nucleation mechanisms. Here, we explore the effects of various charge combinations of flanking residues on the nucleation kinetics of a short polyQ peptide. We designed six mutants that vary both in total charge and in the net attraction/repulsion between termini, potentially allowing us to identify which of these factors plays a greater role in a given peptide's ability to aggregate. We determined the concentration dependence of spontaneous amyloid assembly kinetics, the seeded elongation kinetics, and the molar concentrations of the elongation competent seed preparations, in order to extract the following parameters: the critical nucleus n*, the second order elongation rate constant, and the nucleation equilibrium constant (Kn*). We also characterized aggregate morphologies by electron microscopy. We found significant differences in aggregation kinetics in the charge variants analyzed, but only modest effects on aggregation mechanism. We also observed some atypical aggregate morphologies in some experiments. Some of these are likely due to charge effects on aggregate structure formation, while others may reflect introduction of additional assembly mechanisms at the high, non-physiological concentrations required for these studies. Our preliminary conclusion is that attraction/repulsion between termini plays a modulating role on \u03b2-hairpin closure and hence aggregation kinetics in this series of polyQ peptides. R01AG019322-11 It is now well appreciated that disordered proteins and domains are prevalent in eukaryotic proteomes and that disorder is critically linked with their regulation and functionality. However, our recent observations with the multi-domain protein, nucleophosmin (Npm), suggest that the biological palette of disorder is more diverse than currently understood. The N-terminal oligomerization domain of Npm (NpmN) can be transformed from a folded, pentameric structure to a monomeric, disordered state through changes in solution ionic strength and, importantly, through physiologically relevant post-translational modifications. Interestingly, this polymorphic behavior is not detected using standard secondary structure and disorder prediction algorithms, which show NpmN to be folded into beta strands, consistent with the structure of the pentameric form. We have used a combination of computational and biophysical tools, including molecular mechanics energy calculations, circular dichroism and NMR, to test the hypothesis that the polymorphic behavior of NpmN can be understood on structural and energetic grounds. We have identified unfavorable energetic 'hot-spots' within the NpmN structure which coincide with experimentally observed sites of post-translational modification. Based on these observations, we propose that NpmN has evolved energetic switches within its structure to enable transformation to a disordered state through phosphorylation. We further propose that the transformation process associated with control of Npm's multiple cellular functions is triggered by sequential phosphorylation of solvent exposed sites of posttranslational modification followed by exposure and modification of additional, but initially buried sites to completely shift the equilibrium to the disordered state.",

            "text": "The chaperonin GroEL plays an essential role in promoting protein folding and in protecting against misfolding and aggregation in the cellular environment. In this study, we report that both GroEL and its isolated apical domain form amyloid-like fibrils under physiological conditions, and that the fibrillation of the apical domain is accelerated under acidic conditions. We also found, however, that despite its fibrillation propensity, the apical domain exhibits a pronounced inhibitory effect on the fibril growth of b2-microglobulin. Thus, the analysis of the behaviour of the apical domain reveals how aggregation and chaperone-mediated antiaggregation processes can be closely related. Mixed lineage leukemias are characterized by the generation of a chimeric fusion protein where MLL is fused in frame to over 60 different fusion partners, particularly leading to dysregulation of HOX gene expression. AF9 is one of the most common MLL fusion partners and the mechanism by which AF9 regulates normal transcription and contributes to dysregulated transcription in MLL-AF9 leukemia is poorly understood. We have shown that the C-terminal domain of AF9 binds to four different proteins, two of which (Dot1L and AF4), are transcriptional activators, whereas the other two (BcoR and Pc3) are transcriptional repressors. Adding another layer of complexity, we have also shown that the C-terminal domain of AF9 is an intrinsically disordered protein (IDP) which undergoes coupled folding and binding upon interacting with each of these four proteins to form structured complexes. In order to gain a deeper understanding of the functionality of AF9 and its binding partners in the context of mixed lineage leukemia, we have solved separate NMR solution structures of three complexes (AF4, Dot1L, PC3) with AF9. Surprisingly, these three complexes adopt comparable structures and utilize a similar binding interface on AF9 implying that there is mutual exclusivity between each of the AF9 binding partners. We propose that the IDP nature of the C-terminal domain of AF9 allows the protein to act as a signaling hub in transcriptional regulation allowing for sequential recruitment of its binding partners. Furthermore, each of these different interactions allows the function of AF9 to be altered by the nature of the proteins that associate with its C-terminus. It is controversial as to which of these protein-protein interactions with AF9 is critical for MLL-AF9 leukemogenesis. Our previous work has shown that specifically blocking the AF4-AF9 interaction leads to a loss of transformation of hematopoetic progenitor cells. We plan on using our structural data from the Dot1L-AF9 and Pc3-AF9 complexes to run classic structure-function studies in order to characterize the role of these interactions in mixed lineage leukemia. It is recognized that neurodegeneration is accompanied by the disturbance in protein turnover in neural tissues leading to the accumulation of insoluble deposits from aggregated abnormal proteins (amyloids). Diverse amyloid components are characterized by abnormal conformation, loss of function, propensity to aggregation, and cytotoxicity. The cargo of protein aggregates correlates with decreased efficiency of intracellular proteases. Proteolytic system in lysosome compartment participates in autophagy of cellular proteins and organelles, proteasome responsible for protein quality control and elimination of damaged proteins in cytosol, and calpains and caspases mediate necrotic and apoptotic pathways of cell death. Cell survival/death (and also a death pathway) depends on orchestrated work of proteolytic systems. In model animals was shown that amyloidinduced neurodegeneration as well as physiological ageing is accompanied by (1) reliable changes in concentration, localization, and enzymatic activity of lysosomal cathepsins B, D, L, (2) decreased rate of proteasome complex assemblage, (3) hyperactivation of Ca2+-dependent proteolysis in cytosol, and (4) upregulation of proapoptotic proteases. Calpains being highly selective processing proteases regulate other components of cellular proteolytic machinery and calpain-dependent hydrolysis is frequently considered as initiating step. Both amyloid-induced and senile neurodegeneration led to disturbance in normal calpain regulation. Calpastatin (endogenous calpain inhibitor) content is stable in damaged brain regions whereas the inhibitor and protease are spatially separated. Calcium (calpain activator) level sharply increases in the areas of degeneration provoking excessive hydrolysis of the substrates of cell death. It raises a problem of neuron loss and neuroinflammation. By the other hand, calpains are solely capable to disassemble supramolecular complexes such as fibrils and pathological protein aggregates that are inaccessible for proteasome due to steric hindrance. Thus, calpain hyperactivation is a crucial problem in neurodegeneration, and some proposed pathways to overcome this problem include the decrease in calcium input to cytosol, synthetic calpain inhibitors, etc. This work was supported by RFBR The transcription factor, NF\u03baB, plays a key role in the regulation of several cellular events including proliferation, apoptosis, inflammation, and responses to stress and infection. Pathological deregulation of the NF\u03baB pathway is implicated in a variety of cancers as well as chronic inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Specifically, defects in the NF\u03baB inhibitor protein, I\u03baB\u03b1, have been implicated in these diseases, and it was recently demonstrated that I\u03baB\u03b1 is deleted in 25% of glioblastoma cancers. Previous experiments have suggested I\u03baB\u03b1 exhibits conformational disorder, especially in ankyrin repeats 5 and 6, and this conformational disorder appears to be involved in I\u03baB\u03b1's ability to strip NF\u03baB from DNA. In order to better understand the role that dynamics plays in I\u03baB\u03b1's function, NMR relaxation experiments were used to measure the dynamics of the wildtype I\u03baB\u03b1 construct containing ankyrin repeats 1-6 and two I\u03baB\u03b1 constructs with stabilizing mutations. In addition, residual dipolar couplings were measured for the three I\u03baB\u03b1 constructs in order to compare their time-averaged structures. The results suggest that the stabilizing mutations made to I\u03baB\u03b1 do not change the time-averaged structure of the protein, but do alter the protein's flexibility. The stabilizing mutations restrict the dynamics of I\u03baB\u03b1, which in turn inhibits I\u03baB\u03b1's ability to strip NF\u03baB from DNA.

They suppress an intermixing of nuclear and cytoplasmic contents, which is a prerequisite for the ordered course of gene expression. Thus, inert molecules larger than 5 nm in diameter are excluded from passive translocation, whereas selected cargos, whose size can reach 40 nm in diameter, can traverse the NPCs in a facilitated manner. This selectivity has been explained by NPCs containing a sieve-like hydrogel barrier that is composed of Phe-Gly (FG)-rich domains. FG repeat domains are intrinsically disordered protein stretches that adopt a certain structure upon interaction with other FG domains within the central channel of NPCs. Indeed, it was previously demonstrated that yeast FG domains are able to assemble into sieve-like FG hydrogels with NPC-typical permeability. It was, however, unclear if this ability is conserved to higher life forms and in how far the NPC barriers differ between lower and higher eukaryotes. We now observed that also vertebrate FG domains are cohesive and form highly selective FG hydrogels. In contrast to yeast, however, the barriercritical inter FG contacts appear not to be formed by N/Q-rich amyloid-like beta structures, but instead by other structural principles. We also found an unexpected role of the so far mysterious GlcNAc-modifications of vertebrate nucleoporins in controlling the permeability of FG hydrogel-based barriers. NOTCH receptors are transmembrane glycoproteins of a highly conserved signaling pathway that is crucial in regulation of multiple cell differentiation and developmental processes in multicellular organisms. There are four NOTCH receptors in higher eukaryotic organisms and aberrant signaling in any of these receptors is associated with many types of cancers and other diseases. NOTCH receptors exhibit a highly conserved modular architecture, which includes in their extra-cellular domain a Negative Regulatory Region (NRR) composed of three tandem LIN-12/Notch-Repeats (LNRs) and the Heterodimerization Domain (HD). Proper NOTCH activation requires a tightly regulated ligand-dependent proteolytic processing of this NRR at a metalloprotease cleavage site (S2) nestled within the compact hydrophobic core of HD. The direct interaction between the LNR and the HD masks this S2 site and maintain the receptor in its resting conformation prior to ligand binding. The HD consists of an intimately intertwined \u03b1/\u03b2 sandwich containing five \u03b2 -strands and two \u03b1-helices connected by several conserved loops and a short helix. The secondary structural elements of the HD fold around a conserved hydrophobic core which is a hotspot for many disease inducing point mutations. Untimely ligand independent cleavage as a result of such mutations in the HD of NOTCH1 is noted in about 50% of T-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (T-ALL) cases, underscoring their role in weakening the structural integrity of the HD. This project aims to evaluate the hypothesis that vulnerability to ligand independent cleavage results from changes in the secondary structure and/or the stability of the HD due to these point mutations. For this work, we used circular dichroism, size exclusion chromatography, and mass spectrometry to study two representative mutant constructs with point mutations on either an \u03b1-helix or \u03b2-strand defining the hydrophobic core of the HD. Our results indicate that the major compromise of such point mutations is to the stability of the domain rather than to its secondary structure. These findings are critical in delineating the mechanism of action for the cancer causing point mutations in inducing ligand-independent activation of the NOTCH signaling pathway.",

Understanding the mechanism of lysozyme aggregation is, therefore, of crucial importance. However, elucidating details has been challenging due to a lack of adequate methods or techniques for monitoring this process on a molecular level. In this study, we investigate whether the introduction of a site-specific chemical modification to wild-type human lysozyme results in changes to the biophysical properties of the protein. We have successfully introduced a sitespecific biotin moiety to Lys33 in wild-type lysozyme, and using an array of biophysical techniques, we have demonstrated that this modification does not alter native-state structure and/or stability, nor does it alter in vitro fibril formation. In addition, we demonstrate the applicability of the biotin probe incorporated into lysozyme. By exploiting the specific affinity of biotin to streptavidin, we could obtain structural details of the fibrils formed from the biotinylated wild-type lysozyme using fluorescence microscopy techniques. Due to the wide availability of various probes attached to succinimide esters, the site-specific modification protocol presented in this study will allow us to introduce other chemical moieties which can be used for further experimental studies. We shall discuss how these methods can help us to gain further insight into the dynamic properties of lysozyme folding and misfolding.",

The mechanism of IAPP toxicity is poorly understood. Here we identify and characterize the toxic species produced during amyloid formation by human IAPP. Using a combination of time-dependent biophysical and biological assays, we show that the transiently populated pre-fibrillar intermediates formed in the early phase of amyloid formation are toxic and they are loosely packed with very modest amounts of secondary structure. The only known natural mutation found in mature human IAPP is a Ser20-to-Gly missense mutation, which appears to be associated with an increased risk of early-onset type 2 diabetes. We demonstrate that the mutant accelerates amyloid formation under physiologically relevant conditions. We rationally design another variant at residue 20, S20K-IAPP, which is much slower to aggregate with an 18-fold longer lag phase and inhibits wild type amyloid formation. The pronounced effects of the Ser20 mutants highlight the sensitivity of amyloid formation to the identity of position 20. By comparing the kinetics and toxicity profiles of the two Ser20 mutants to wild type IAPP, we demonstrate that changes in the length of the lag phase directly correlate with changes in the onset and the duration of toxicity. Our findings provide direct evidence that the toxic species are transient intermediates and have implications for the treatment of type 2 diabetes and other amyloid related diseases.

Bcl-2 inhibits programmed cell death in a variety of cell types, whereas Bax promotes apoptosis. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of carotenoids derived from saffron on expression of the oncoproteins Bcl-2 and Bax, and caspase activity in two cell lines: AGS Human gastric cancer cells and HFSF-PI3 normal human fibroblast cells. Cell viability was determined using the MTT assay. Both crocin and crocetin reduced cell viability and accelerated apoptosis in a concentration-and time-dependent manner in AGS cells. Western blotting revealed an increase the Bax:Bcl-2 ratio in AGS cells treated with carotenoids, due an upregulation of Bax and downregulation of Bcl-2 protein expression. However, crocetin induced more apoptosis than crocin, which correlated with the effects on cell viability, as crocetin was more cytotoxic than crocin. The apoptosis induced by crocetin and crocin in AGS gastric cancer cells was associated with increased caspase activity. Neither crocetin nor crocin affected Bcl-2 or Bax protein expression in HFSF-PI3 cells. These results suggest that, under experimental conditions, the carotenoids crocetin and crocin can induce apoptosis in AGS cells, via altering the Bax:Bcl-2 protein ratio and activating caspases. Additionally, we conclude that crocetin is a more potent inhibitor of cell proliferation than crocin, as crocetin had more marked effects on the expression of oncoproteins and caspase activity. AGS cells were more sensitive to saffron carotenoids than HFSF-PI3 cells. The findings of this study may prove useful for guiding future clinical applications of these herbal agents for the treatment and prevention of gastric cancer.",

Unfortunately, bacteria and fungi are acquiring drug-resistance and are quickly rendering many of these drugs ineffective. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, this mechanism is defined as pleiotropic drug-resistance (PDR). Overexpression of drug efflux pumps is controlled by two major transcriptional regulators, Pdr1p and Pdr3p. Homologous PDR pathways have been identified in other species, such as Canadida albicans and Aspergillus fumigatus. In the PDR pathway, Pdr1p and Pdr3p coordinate the expression of certain ABC transporters by binding to consensus motifs called pleiotropic drug response elements (PDREs). Pdr1p and Pdr3p are zinc finger transcription factors that form dimers to recognize a series of CGG repeats in the promoter region of target PDR genes. Interestingly, these transcriptional regulators can tolerate sequence variation within the binding site and recognize variant PDRE sites. The regulatory mechanism for how canonical and variant PDREs lead to differential PDR gene expression has yet to be explored. Differences in the PDRE motifs and in the DNA-binding domains (DBDs) of Pdr1p and Pdr3p must allow for differential regulation, making this a unique system for investigation and a possible drug target. This has been studied using two approaches: (1) Determine the individual binding affinities of Pdr1p and Pdr3p DBDs for canonical and variant PDRE binding sites using fluorescence anisotropy and surface plasmon resonance.",

Vaccinia virus, a member of the poxvirus family, is a model organism for the research on virus host interactions as it possesses numerous strategies to inhibit the innate immune response of host cells and organisms in the answer to infection. The importance of such processes for both virus and host demands their deep understanding, however, the majority of them have not been clearly studied. A large part of inhibitory mechanisms involve virus-encoded proteins that target the pathogen signal transduction pathway from the plasma membrane to the nucleus, and finally prevent production of proinflammatory and antiviral cytokines. Our main goal is to define mechanisms of inhibition of NF\u03baB (the central transcriptional factor during an antiviral response) activation by certain vaccinia proteins by solving their structure and structural mechanisms of interaction with cellular proteins. The vaccinia virus A46 protein, 240 amino acids long, is predicted to have a TIR fold and, thus, interact with TIR-domain containing cellular proteins. To such targets belong important players of innate immune response such as adaptor proteins MyD88, MAL, TRAM and cytosolic domains of TLR receptors. We generated a number of full-length and truncated constructs of A46 with and without solubilization tags for overexpression in bacteria. The MBP-A46 fusion and HIS-tagged N-terminal truncated version of the protein allowed the isolation of samples suitable for the crystallization studies. A limited proteolysis experiment of the fulllength construct suggested the possible presence of two subdomains in the structure of the A46 protein. We conducted characterization of the oligomeric state of protein variants and their mutational analysis. During static light scattering experiments, A46 full-size protein behaved as a mixture of tetrameric and dimeric forms, in contrast, N-terminal truncated protein showed only a dimeric profile. A large number of crystallization screens with A46 protein were established and microcrystals were obtained, however, further optimization is required. To test the interactions between A46 and its probable binding partner, the C-terminal part of the murine MyD88 protein, comprising the TIR domain (146-296 a.a.), was expressed with a GST-tag and purified. We are now studying the A46 and MyD88 interactions via pull-down assays, isothermal titration calorimetry and NMR, as well as crystallization of the purified complex. Prion diseases are fatal neurodegenerative diseases such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) in humans, scrapie in sheep, and bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in cattle. They are caused by the conformational conversion of normal cellular prion protein, PrPc, into an abnormally folded, \u03b2-sheet rich isoform, PrPSc, which can be infectious. Prions replicate and spread from peripheral entry sites into the central nervous system (CNS), where they induce neuronal injury and death. However, some prion strains which are conformational variants of PrPSc spread to the CNS inefficiently and do not cause clinical signs of disease. We recently characterized the histological and biochemical features of several mouse-adapted prion strains that efficiently or poorly invade the CNS after peripheral entry. We found that highly neuroinvasive prion strains formed predominantly diffuse aggregates in the brain that were sensitive to enzyme digestion at lower chaotrope concentrations, and were less resistant to heat and SDS denaturation. These strains generated PrPSc from PrPc efficiently over a short incubation period. In contrast, the poorly neuroinvasive strains formed dense amyloid aggregates that were more stable to chaotropes and SDS thermal denaturation. These results indicate that the most neuroinvasive prion strains are highly unstable, and suggest that the efficient generation of PrPSc templates may be a key property of their rapid invasion of the CNS. (Lombardi et al., 2009; Mikovits et al., 2010) , a recent study has indicated that xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus (XMRV) arose through recombination following passaging human tumors in mice (Paprotka et al., 2011) . Nevertheless, XMRV, which is very closely related to Moloney murine leukemia virus (Mo-MLV), provides a legitimate example of a replication-competent gammaretrovirus capable of infecting human cells. Despite a wealth of information derived from in vitro site-directed mutagenesis studies, the single-chain gammaretroviral reverse transcriptase (RT) has been less studied in structural terms than the counterpart p66/p51 heterodimeric enzyme from HIV-1 and -2, and thus is deserving of more attention. The ribonuclease H (RNase H) domain of retroviral reverse transcriptase (RT) plays a critical role in the life cycle by degrading the RNA strands of DNA/RNA hybrids. In addition, RNaseH activity is required to precisely remove the RNA primers from nascent (-) and (+) strand DNA. We report here three crystal structures of the RNase H domain of xenotropic murine leukemia virusrelated virus (XMRV) RT, namely (i), the previously identified construct from which helix C was deleted, (ii), the intact domain, and (iii), the intact domain complexed with an active site a-hydroxytropolone inhibitor. Enzymatic assays showed that the intact RNase H domain retained catalytic activity, whereas the variant lacking helix C was only marginally active, corroborating the importance of this helix for enzymatic activity. Modeling of the enzyme-substrate complex elucidated the essential role of helix C in binding a DNA/RNA hybrid and its likely mode of recognition. The crystal structure of the RNase H domain complexed with \u03b2-thujaplicinol clearly showed that coordination by two divalent cations mediates recognition of the inhibitor. Islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP, also called amylin) is a 37-residue, natively-unstructured, amyloidogenic peptide hormone that is strongly implicated in the progression of Type II diabetes (T2D). The selfassembly of IAPP in a membrane environment is thought to be central to the development of cytotoxicity and to the mechanisms of amyloid fibril formation. We have recently characterized membrane-bound dimeric states of IAPP using a combination of intermolecular single-pair F\u00f6rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) and constrained Monte Carlo simulations [Nath, Miranker & Rhoades. (2011) Angew. Chemie. Intl. Ed. 50 (46):10859]. In order to validate the resulting structural models, and to provide insight into the mechanisms of IAPP cytotoxicity, we used computational docking and statistical inference approaches to identify small molecules from large commercial libraries (>100,000 compounds) that bind selectively to membrane-bound dimers of IAPP. Active compounds were assayed for effects on membrane binding using fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS), for effects on IAPP conformation using FRET, and for effects on IAPPmediated toxicity in cell culture. Diverse compounds have been identified that potentiate or ameliorate cytotoxicity. These small molecules may serve as useful reagents to dissect the mechanisms of IAPPmediated membrane disruption, as well as potential lead compounds for new classes of therapeutics for the treatment of T2D. Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) are ~ 16 kDa heparinbinding proteins that regulate key cellular processes such as angiogenesis, differentiation, morphogenesis, wound healing and tumor growth. FGFRs consist of three extracellular ligand-binding domains (D1, D2, D3), a single transmembrane helix, and cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase domain. Cell surface-bound HSPGs (heparan sulfate proteoglycans) supported dimerization or polymerization of the FGFRs are thought to be required to activate the signaling pathway. The D2 domain is suggested to bind with both HSPGs and FGFs to form a ternary complex. Heterozygous mutations in the D2 domain have been attributed to the cause of Kallmann syndrome, Apert syndrome and Pfeiffer syndrome. The mechanism of action for previous studied disease causing mutations includes enhanced FGF binding affinity, FGF independent dimerization and decreased FGF binding specificity. We have recently analyzed mutations in the D2 domain that are associated with diseases causing craniosynostosis. The disease causing mutations we have selected to are located in the D2 domain. The biophysical characterizations of these diseases have shown a decrease of the receptor stability and lower affinity to both FGF and heparin. The structural consequences of these mutations will be further discussed. 1 Centre for Protein Engineering, University of Li\u00e8ge, All\u00e9e du 6 Ao\u00fbt, 13, Li\u00e8ge, 4000, Belgium, 2 Structural Biology Brussels, Free University of Brussels, Brussels, Belgium, 3 Centro Ricerche Interdipartimentale Biotecnologie Innovative, University of Padua, Padua, Italy Nine neurodegenerative diseases, called polyQ diseases, are associated with the formation of intranuclear amyloid-like aggregates by nine different proteins containing a polyQ tract above a threshold length (35-45 residues). The formation of these aggregates could play an important role in the pathogenesis. The polyQ expansion is the only common feature among the involved proteins, suggesting it might be responsible for the aggregation phenomenon. Understanding the molecular mechanism by which the polyQ expansions promote aggregation is therefore crucial for the development of new therapeutic strategies. Most of the nine proteins associated with polyQ diseases are difficult to express recombinantly. In order to get further insights into the mechanism by which polyQ tracts promote aggregation, we have therefore decided to insert polyQ sequences into a well-studied protein, the betalactamase BlaP from B. licheniformis. We have created chimeras containing 23, 30, 55 and 79 glutamines either into the loop between helices 8 and 9 of BlaP or near the active site of the enzyme. We have investigated the effects of these insertions on the activity, the structure, the stability of BlaP as well as on its aggregating properties. The results of these studies indicate that the aggregating properties of the BlaP chimeras recapitulate phenomena characteristic of proteins associated with polyQ diseases and show how the protein context can influence the aggregation process. Therefore BlaP is a relevant host protein to investigate the aggregation of polyQ proteins. In order to better understand the interplay between the propensity of the polyQ tracts to trigger the aggregation and the modulating effects of the protein context, we have performed limited proteolysis experiments and transglutaminase-catalyzed reactions on BlaP and its chimeras. The results of these studies allowed us to correlate the dynamics of the proteins and the flexibility of the different polyQ tracts with the aggregating properties of the various chimeras. In parallel, we have generated a series of more than 20 camelid-single domain antibody fragments (VHHs) raised against BlaP or its chimeras. We are using these VHHs as structural probes to understand, at the molecular level, the mechanism of amyloid fibril formation by polyQ proteins, and as possible inhibitors of the aggregation process.",

Three mutants of \u03b1-Syn (A30P, E46K and A53T) which are linked to early onset familial forms of PD have been reported to show altered aggregation kinetics in vitro. A53T and E46K have faster whereas A30P has slower aggregation kinetics as compared to wild type (WT) \u03b1-Syn. How these PD linked mutations drastically alter the aggregation kinetics of \u03b1-Syn is not yet known. We hypothesize that some site specific structural differences may exist in the soluble form of WT and mutant \u03b1-Syns that cause the alteration of aggregation kinetics. Here we studied the site specific structural differences in the low molecular weight (LMW) and fibrillar form of different \u03b1-Syns using intrinsic tryptophan (Trp) fluorescence and aggregation was monitored using other biophysical techniques such as Circular Dichroism (CD), Thioflavin T (ThT) binding and electron microscopy.To perform our study, Trp residue was substituted by site-directed mutagenesis in WT and mutant \u03b1-Syns at positions 3, 71 and 140. Fluorescence quenching and anisotropy studies indicate that site specific structural differences exist in the LMW and fibrillar forms of WT and mutant \u03b1-Syns. In the LMW form, Trp3 and Trp71 were mostly solvent exposed in E46K and A53T as compared to that in WT and A30P. Trp3, Trp71 and Trp140 in all \u03b1-Syns showed blue shift upon aggregation of the proteins into amyloid fibrils. However, fluorescence quenching studies and analysis of site specific stability of fibrils using guanidium hydrochloride denaturation reveal that [Trp71]E46K and [Trp71]A53T fibrils were considerably more solvent protected and stable as compared to [Trp71]WT fibrils. These results suggest that the mutations E46K and A53T cause more solvent exposure of sites in the N-terminal and central region of \u03b1-Syn which might facilitate interaction between these regions in individual protein molecules and thus increase aggregation kinetics. Similarly slightly more solvent protected sites in A30P might be responsible for its slow aggregation kinetics. More solvent protected environment and stability of Trp71 (situated in the core region of fibrils) in E46K and A53T fibrils might also correspond to increased fibril forming propensity of these mutants.Source of Research support-DBT,India.",

Improved diagnostic methods have improved detection rates, but therapy development has lagged; indeed, widely-used hormone therapies are frequently overcome by the cancer, highlighting the desperate need for a novel therapeutic target. The transcription factor ERG (Ets-Related Gene) is the subject of a chromosomal translocation in more than half of all prostate cancers, leading to ERG's over-expression under the promoter of the androgenregulated gene TMPRSS2. While the DNA-binding domain of ERG is highly conserved, we have identified auto-inhibitory regions flanking this domain which are not as highly conserved and thus could serve as docking sites for targeted small molecules. The prospect of designing small molecules that can stabilize an autoinhibited conformation of ERG, thereby reducing its DNA binding activity, makes ERG an intriguing target in prostate cancer therapy. We have screened a 1000-compound fragment library and identified several lead compounds that not only preferentially bind an auto-inhibited ERG protein construct, but which also show minimal activity against related proteins. Using a fluorescence polarization assay we developed, we will be expanding our screen to a 150,000 compound library and validating hits by time-resolved FRET (HTRF) and NMR methods. Our NMR-derived structure of autoinhibited ERG allows for not only the optimization of lead compounds, but has also enabled a detailed study of the dynamics of this protein molecule. This work has the potential to greatly improve patient outcomes by developing high-affinity, high-specificity small molecules to be used in targeted prostate cancer therapy. The innate immune system provides the first line of defense against infectious agents. Essential to this response are cellular mechanisms that recognize, sequester and eradicate these invading organisms. Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3), a transmembrane receptor found in endosomes, is stimulated by the viral genomic material double stranded RNA (dsRNA), initiating a signaling cascade that leads to the production of type 1 interferon and pro-inflammatory cytokines. Critical to this pathway is a proposed kinase complex, NAP1 (NAK associated protein 1) -TBK1 (Tank Binding Kinase 1) -IKKepsilon (IkappaB kinase), which upon activation, leads to the phosphorylation of the transcription factor, IRF3/7 (interferon regulatory factor), and production of IFNbeta. To control this activity, SIKE (suppressor of IKKepsilon) acts as an endogenous inhibitor of IKKepsilon and TBK1 through a previously undefined mechanism. The objective of this study was to define the mechanism by which SIKE inhibits type I interferon production and the regulatory release mechanism of SIKE upon viral infection. The studies presented here show that SIKE is a mixed-type inhibitor, regulating the kinases through competitive and non-competitive modes of inhibition. Through kinase assays, immunoblot and mass spectrometry analyses, post-translational modifications that affect SIKE inhibitory activity have been identified. As these post-translational modifications coincide with kinase complex activation, we hypothesize that they mediate SIKE's release from the NAP1-TBK1-IKKepsilon complex allowing for IRF3/7 activation. Using site-directed mutagenesis to alter post-translation modification sites, SIKE inhibitory activity and interactions with kinase complex components were analyzed. From these data we propose a model for regulation of the type I interferon response. This research was funded through the Jeffress Memorial Trust. Over-expression of lipoxygenase-12 (LOX-12) leading to overproduction of leukotrienes is involved in development and progression of breast cancer. This study was performed to design and synthesize novel structurebased peptide inhibitors for LOX-12 and evaluate their anti-tumor activity in vitro and in vivo in breast cancer. Ten peptides were designed and synthesized by solid phase peptide synthesis and analyzed in vitro for enzyme inhibition using the conjugated diene method of enzyme assay. Affinity of the interaction of peptides with LOX-12 was analyzed by Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) technique. MTT assay for cytotoxicity, Annexin-V binding for apoptosis and FITC-labeling of peptides for intracellular localization were performed to evaluate the in vitro antitumor activity of peptides on MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell lines. In vivo antitumor activity of the peptide was evaluated in swiss-albino mice after tumor induction with EAT cell line. Tumor induction and its size were observed after 30 days. All work was performed with the approval of the Ethics Committee of All India Institute of Medical Sciences where the work was performed. Out of the 10 peptides, YWCS showed significant inhibitory effects in different assays. The dissociation constant (KD) was found to be 3.39 x 10-8 M and 8.6 x 10-8 M for YWCS and baicalein (positive control), respectively. The kinetic constant Ki was 72.45 x 10-7 M as determined by kinetic assay. The peptide significantly reduced the cell viability of breast cancer cell lines MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 with IC50 of 75\u03bcM and 400\u03bcM, respectively. In addition, the peptide induced 49.8% and 20.8% apoptosis in MCF-7 and MDA-MB 231 respectively. A concentration of upto 358\u03bcM of the peptide lysed only 22% human erythrocytes which was significantly lower (p<0.001) than Gentamycin (positive control). in vivo activity of YWCA showed that it could significantly suppress (p<0.017) the growth and initiation of tumor in mice. However, untreated mice showed progressive increase in tumor volume. Our results suggest that YWCS is an effective peptide inhibitor of human LOX-12 and can be used as a lead compound to complement the ongoing efforts to develop different therapies for breast cancer. This work was supported by research grant Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by plaque buildup in the brain and decreased levels of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. Decreased levels of acetylcholine lead to decreased cell communication, which is thought to result in the manifestation of dementia, a characteristic of AD. Butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) is a key enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of acetylcholine in healthy tissue and increases the aggregation of A\u03b2 peptides into fibrils, contributing to AD pathogenesis. Studies have shown that BuChE activity is increased in patients suffering from AD, making this enzyme one of the primary biochemical targets for treating Alzheimer's symptoms. Unfortunately, the number of potential inhibitors is very large and the molecular basis of enzyme inhibition remains largely undescribed. To address this, we employ computer modeling and massively parallel molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of fully solvated enzyme-inhibitor complexes, which allow us to study the physical and chemical nature of enzyme-inhibitor complexation and to identify the chemical characteristics necessary to effectively and accurately target the BuChE active site. The dialkyl phenyl phosphate (DAPP) family of inhibitors has been shown to effectively target BuChE with varying efficacy. We report here our study of the binding interactions and affinities of a number of DAPP's using the Folding@Home Distributed Computing Network to collect thousands of all-atom MD simulations, including the enzyme sans inhibitor and with three chemically similar docked DAPP inhibitors of varying alkyl chain length. Several mechanisms have been suggested to describe the mechanism of enzymesubstrate complex formation and equilibrium including the \"Lock and Key\" and \"Induced Fit\" models, as well as the more contemporary \"Conformational Shift\" model, which assumes that a protein takes on multiple native conformations from which a given substrate can select the thermodynamically optimal conformation for docking. In this latter model, that conformation is most energetically beneficial and, thus, most populated after binding by that specific substrate. The simulated ensemble is used to evaluate the applicability of these mechanistic models and to assess the energetics of binding, the equilibrium dynamics within the enzymesubstrate complex, and the role of the solvent in these interactions. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating degenerative disease affecting 5.5 million people in the United States alone and 35 million people world-wide. From a functional perspective, we know how AD affects a person externally, but the internal processes are still somewhat of a mystery. The Konkle Lab, along with the Menze and Nathan Lab, is exploring the interacting roles of oxidative stress products 4-hydroxyl-2-nonenal (HNE), age, estrogen, and the protein ApoE in the progression of Alzheimer's. Ex vivo mouse neuronal mitochondria were treated with HNE and the function analyzed by oxygen uptake while the structures of mitochondrial proteins were analyzed by Western blotting. Additionally, tissues from in vivo experiments that encouraged the endogenous production of HNE were similarly analyzed.",

Cross-seeding, which is generally efficient between homologous sequences but inefficient between non-homologous sequences, is often found, at least in the former case, to occur with retention of structure between seed and fibril product. It was previously shown that Alzheimer's disease related A\u03b240 fibrils of varying polymorphic structures are able to propagate their structures with high fidelity through seeded growth of A\u03b240 monomers. Here we inquire whether fibril structure is retained in the seemingly very conservative cross-seeding between A\u03b240 and A\u03b242 sequences. The fibrils of these two peptides, grown under 37 \u00b0C/quiescent conditions, exhibit similar structures in electron micrographs but significantly different substructures as assessed by critical concentration (Cr), FTIR, and hydrogenexchange protection (HX-MS). The expected kinetic compatibility between these two sequences was confirmed. Thus, in cross-seeding of non-identical monomers with preformed fibrils of either A\u03b240 or A\u03b242, at 8% w/w to monomers, and at 37 \u00b0C under quiescent conditions, the lag phases exhibited in the unseeded reactions are completely eliminated, and aggregation is complete within a few hours. Furthermore, the observed fibril elongation rates are very similar between comparable homologous and heterologous seeding reactions, also consistent with efficient seeding between systems. Surprisingly, however, the Cr values, FTIR spectra, and HXMS protection data reveal that the structures of the products of the cross-seeded reactions are more similar to the fibrils normally produced in the spontaneous aggregation of the monomer, and not, as expected, to the fibril seeds. Furthermore, when some A\u03b240 polymorphic fibrils are used to seed A\u03b242 monomer fibrillization, the resulting fibrils exhibit some structural properties that are uniquely different from both the fibril seeds and normal A\u03b242 fibrils. These observations show that seeding can remove the normal nucleation barrier for monomer fibril formation without necessarily dictating the full details of fibril product structure. Our findings reveal new insights into the complexity of amyloid fibril formation and suggest that appropriate caution should be exercised when using seeded elongation to amplify small amounts of fibrils for structural studies. Prolactin is a 23 kDa peptide hormone that has many roles in various biological functions and has been linked to pathological conditions ranging from breast and prostate cancer to obesity and anorexia nervosa. It is also present as a truncated 16 kDa N-terminal cleavage product of the 23 kDa form. While prolactin is detectable in circulation in humans, the two different isoforms exhibit properties that have been shown to be in direct opposition each other. For example, the 16 kDa form appears less mitogenic than the 23 kDa in activity bioassays, but with angiogenesis, the 23 kDa form promotes while the 16 kDa form inhibits. Prolactin exists in a number of different isoforms, though quantitative tests do not distinguish between them. In this study, focused on peptides from the 16 and 23 kDa isomers, a multiple reaction monitoring mass spectrometry (MRM-MS) method was developed to measure the absolute abundance of six tryptic prolactin peptides in human serum using stable isotope-labeled internal standards for quantitation. This study provides a quick and robust method for quantitation of the prolactin isoforms, and allows for the expansion of sample processing to be developed into a high-throughput platform. A promising therapy for patients with B-cell lymphoma is based on the use of idiotype antibodies as vaccines. This kind of vaccines are based on the use of immunoglobulins having a variable region with epitopes exclusively expressed by a lymphoma. Since these epitopes are different for each tumor, a specific idiotype vaccine has to be produced for each patient. Expression of immunoglobulins for human use often requires the use of mammalian cells because these cells are able to provide appropriate post-translational modifications that cannot be obtained with other systems. Production of proteins for clinical use can be greatly improved by the use of stable cell lines that can be scaled up to reach the desired level of production. We have used a noncytopathic Semliki Forest virus (ncSFV) RNA vector to generate stable cell lines expressing the murine follicular lymphoma-derived idiotype antibody A20. We designed an expression cassette that consists of sequences encoding the following components: (1) Puromycin N-acetyl-transferase; (2) foot-and-mouth disease virus 2A autoprotease; (3) A20 light chain with its own signal peptide; and (4) A20 secretable heavy chain under the control of either a second subgenomic promoter or an IRES sequence. These cassettes were cloned into the ncSFV vector. Both recombinant ncSFV vectors allowed rapid and efficient selection of stable BHK cell lines with puromycin. These cell lines expressed A20 in supernatants with a proper quaternary structure, as evidenced by non-reducing SDS-PAGE. Expression levels reached 8 mg/L/24h, although they were about ten-fold lower when heavy chain expression was driven by the IRES element. Protein expression and yield were improved by incubation of cells at 33 degrees without serum. Importantly, A20 was highly glycosylated and showed a pattern similar to the same antibody produced by a murine hybridoma. These results indicate that the ncSFV vector has a great potential for the production of recombinant antibodies in mammalian cells. For several decades, immunoglubulinG (IgG) had been studied for engineering its specificity and binding affinity toward variable ligands and widely used in biological researches, clinical diagnostics and therapeutic applications. Nonetheless, there are difficulties in the development and use of antibody due to high expression cost, large molecule size and established patents. In these reasons, desires of non-IgG based binding protein were gradually increasing for alternating antibody. Based on modular property of leucine-rich repeat (LRR) proteins, we have engineered a variable lymphocyte receptor (VLR) by consensus design and fusion with N-terminal region of internalin B (InlB). The designed scaffold, Repebody, has remarkable properties such as high melting temperature, modularity and prokaryote expression with large amounts. In order to verify whether Repebody acts as a universal molecular binder, we carried out the directed evolution of Repebody by saturation mutagenesis of concave surface and phage display technology for selection of ligand binders. The resulting binder D3 exhibits the nanomolar binding affinity for Interleukin-6 with target specificity. For general and practical applications, we further designed repeat module-based approach for affinity maturation of Repebody. Through the method, high affinity binders were successfully isolated from additional module library and the best clone D3E8C4 exhibits about 50fold binding affinity improvement with a dissociation constant (K D ) of 397pM, and which shows inhibition of IL-6 activity in human monocyte at low doses (0.1ug/ ml). These results suggest that Repebody acts as not only an alternative scaffold but also a potential therapeutic agent as the artificial antibody and that module-based engineering method is effective for library design and affinity maturation of repeat proteins. The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was responsible for a largescale epidemic in 2002, which caused 8,400 infections with over 800 deaths. Although it was contained after several months through public health quarantine measures, the potential for recurrence exists. The SARS-CoV papain-like protease (PLpro) is essential for SARS-CoV replication, and is hence a good antiviral drug target. We applied a novel approach based on synergistic fragment and known inhibitor binding to better understand inhibitory mechanisms. We have previously developed two alternative scaffolds that inhibit PLpro with sub-micromolar IC 50 values, and have also explored the conformational changes accompanying inhibitor binding. We subsequently screened a fragment-like library in combination with four previously developed potential inhibitors and identified several fragment-like compounds that synergistically enhance the inhibitory activity of the known inhibitors by approximately an order of magnitude. Docking studies suggest that these fragment-like compounds may bind adjacent to the active site, and further stabilize the inhibitor-bound state. Details of this mechanistic stabilization will be discussed. Supported by NIH grant AI089535.",

            "text": "Department of Biological Science, Kongju National University, College of Natural Sciences 182 Gongju, Chungnam, Gongju, 314-701, Republic of Korea Withaferin A (WFA), a natural withanolide, has shown various properties including anti-tumor, antiinflammation, anti-oxidant, and immunemodulatory activity. Although it is suggested to have a large of effects, the defined mechanisms of action have not yet been explored. We investigated the effects of WFA on dedifferentiation and inflammation. WFA increased reactive oxygen species (ROS), suggesting the induction of oxidative stress, in a dose-dependent manner. Also, we indicated that WFA dramatically caused dedifferentiation and inflammation as determined by the expression of type II collagen and COX-2, and reduced the synthesis of sulfated proteoglycan and caused the synthesis of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) in a dose-and time-dependent manner. Treatment of N-Acetyl-L-Cystein (NAC), an antioxidant, was inhibited WFAinduced a loss of type II collagen and an increase of COX-2. WFA led to an increase in phosphorylation of both Akt and p38. Inhibition of PI3kinase and p38kinase with LY294002 or SB203580 in WFAtreated cells recovered the expression of type II collagen and suppressed the expression of COX-2. These results demonstrated that WFA regulates dedifferentiation and inflammation via PI3 kinase and p38 kinase in rabbit articular chondrocytes. Monoclonal antibodies and nanoparticles are two promising classes of therapeutics that have shown great potential for the treatment of cancer. However, they suffer from transport limitations during systemic administration: [i] antibody distribution, which is rate limited by extravasation, is heterogeneous in solid tumors, and [ii] nanoparticles targeted against cancer cell markers show no improvement in biodistribution over their nontargeted counterparts, which is problematic due to accumulation of nanoparticles in the liver and spleen. Using an engineered knottin peptide (EETI2.5F), that binds to \u03b1v\u03b23, \u03b1v\u03b25, and \u03b15\u03b21 integrins, which are tumor endothelial markers, we have developed multiple tumor vasculature targeting strategies designed to enhance the transport of both antibodies and nanoparticles to solid tumors. We are currently investigating the ability of an EETI2.5F-Fc-interleukin 2 fusion for potentiating the delivery of antibodies in vivo. By causing increased vascular permeability specifically at the tumor vasculature, we would ideally improve the extravasation rate of a concurrently administered antibody and thus improve its distribution throughout a solid tumor. In addition, we are performing studies to validate EETI2.5F conjugated liposomes as having a favorable biodistribution in vivo compared with traditional tumor cell targeted liposomes. By being able to specifically target the tumor environment with these large particles, we will reduce the side toxicity of any chemotherapeutic payloads. These two approaches will hopefully be able to establish a platform for the improved delivery of antibodies and nanoparticles. All work was performed with the approval of the institutional review board of the sponsoring institution. This work was supported by The Protein Maker is an automated purification system developed by Emerald Bio for high-throughput parallel purification of proteins and antibodies. This instrument allows multiple load, wash and elution buffers to be used in parallel along independent lines for up to 24 individual samples. To demonstrate its utility, purification of five recombinant PB2 C-terminal domains from various subtypes of the influenza A virus is described. Three of these constructs crystallized and one diffracted X-rays to sufficient resolution for structure determination and deposition in the Protein Data Bank. Methods for screening lysis buffers for a cytochrome P450 from a pathogenic fungus prior to upscaling expression and purification are also described. The Protein Maker has become a valuable multi-target processing asset within the Seattle Structural Genomics Center for Infectious Disease (SSGCID) and hence is a potentially valuable tool for a variety of high throughput protein purification applications. The active fragment of tumstatin T8 (residues 69-95, T8) is an efficient inhibitor of angiogenesis in a number of tumor models as T8 binds integrin \u03b1V\u03b23 on the surface of proliferating endothelial cells and promotes their apoptosis. However, \u03b1V\u03b23 is also expressed on breast cancer (BC) cells, and, when activated, supports BC cell attachment and metastasis. We suggested that peptide T8, disrupting \u03b1V\u03b23-mediated adhesion and signaling, could be advantageous in the therapy of breast cancer. The aim of the present study was to study therapeutic potential of T8 in two different transplanted mouse models of human BC. BLRB mice (1st model) were inoculated with syngeneic BC cells; 3 weeks later advanced BL-BC tumors (9\u00b11mm) were treated intratumorally with 2 mkg of T8 daily for 10 days. A/Sn mice (2nd model) were inoculated with A-BC tumor cells; 5 weeks later palpable tumors (2\u00b11mm) were treated peri-tumorally with the same amount of T8 by the same schedule. Control mice were treated by the same manner with saline. Tumor growth rate and survival was followed individually up to 3 months. Treated BLRB mice with advanced tumors at the treatment start did not show any tumor burden decrease but their survival was significantly improved. In the 2nd model, treated A/Sn mice with small tumors did not show any tumor growth decrease, and only survival of 20 mkg-T8 treated group was improved. To reveal drug effect our subgoupping approach was used. Slowly growing tumor subgroups were revealed in control, 2mkg-T8, and 20mkg-T8 treated groups (54, 72, and 36%, respectively). Only 20mkg-T8 subgroup showed significant tumor burden decrease and 100% survival 3 months after BL-BC inoculation versus 54 and 43% survival in control and 2mkg-T8 treated subgroups, respectively. Post mortem gross examination revealed increase in lung metastasis nodules in 2mkg-T8 treated mice. As a conclusion, peptide T8 showed clear antitumor effect in both models used, although metastasis promotion was registered in the 2nd model. Peri-tumor 20mkg-T8 treatment reduced tumor burden in 36% of treated mice when applied at the start of palpable tumor manifestation and did not influence tumor growth but significantly improved average survival being applied intra-tumorally (2mkg-T8) to advanced tumors in the 1st mouse model. Obtained results warrant further studies to optimize T8 application schedule and reveal underlying mechanism(s) involved. Lignin is one of the defining characteristics of vascular plants and is an important factor that impedes biofuel production. The heterogeneous nature of lignin prevents its degradation and the economical conversion of cellulose into liquid fuels. Studies have shown that novel monolignols can be readily incorporated into lignin and that the polymer is robust against many changes in monomer composition. Better understanding of the phenylpropanoid P450s involved in lignin precursor synthesis will provide a launching pad to develop novel monolignols to alter the polymer and facilitate efficient conversion of plants into liquid fuels. Currently, no crystal structures or extensive structure-function studies of the plant phenylpropanoid P450s exist. The low sequence identity of phenylpropanoid P450s (20-35%) to P450s of known crystal structure, precludes confident modeling. Here, we present two novel sets of protein chimeras, combining large fragments from each parental protein, which allow us to test functional elements in the context of a complete protein. The first set is made between cinnamic acid 4-hydroxylases (C4H) of two diverse plant species. C4H is the second enzyme and the first P450 of the phenylpropanoid pathway and para-hydroxylates cinnamic acid. A set of 64 chimeras between C4H enzymes of A. thaliana (AtC4H) and S. moellendorffii (SmC4H) which share 70% sequence identity, contain a large number of active proteins and allows us to build a functional model of C4H activity based on fragment identity. A later P450 in the phenylpropanoid pathway, ferulic acid 5-hydroxylase (F5H), hydroxylates a downstream product of C4H at the 5-position. The second chimeric library is an analogous set of inter-protein chimeras between AtC4H and A. thaliana F5H (AtF5H), which share 30% sequence identity. In contrast, very few of these proteins are active. To address the reasons for inactivity, we have also constructed a small set of chimeras containing subfragments between AtC4H and AtF5H to determine the limits of substitution. This research highlights the utility of chimeric protein libraries while shining light onto the sequence and functional constraints of the phenylpropanoid P450s. Designing protein molecules that can assemble into ordered materials is a challenging task for protein engineers. Successfully designed protein assemblies are not only intellectually intriguing, but they can also find important applications in nanotechnology, material science and medicine. A strategy to design protein molecules that can self-assemble into defined shapes or patterns was proposed by our group a decade ago. By fusing naturally occurring, symmetric protein homooligomers in pre-determined orientations, sophisticated protein architectures can emerge through self-assembly.",

            "text": "Here we report the first crystal structures of an artificial protein cage that was designed by the symmetricoligomer fusion strategy. The self-assembled protein cage contains 12 copies of the designed subunit, arranged into a tetrahedral shape roughly 16 nm in diameter. Analysis of the crystal structures illustrates some interesting features that were not conceived when the strategy was first proposed. The successful determination of the crystal structures encourages the use of the symmetric-oligomer fusion strategy to implement other protein-based cages and extended materials. Other related protein assembly design strategies and their recent successes will be highlighted as well. References Spider dragline silk, used by spiders as safety line and web frame, is exceptionally strong, elastic, and biocompatible. These features make it attractive for a large number of applications. Spider silk proteins, spidroins, are highly modular, with long repetitive sequences rich in alanine and glycine flanked by nonrepetitive amino-and carboxy-terminal domains of about 100 amino acids. The objective of the study was to purify a recombinant miniature spidroin, RepCT, derived from the nursery-web spider Euprosthenops australis. To facilitate chromatographic purification the miniature spidroin was fused to a solubility protein and affinity tagged resulting in HisSolRepCT. After induced protein expression in E. coli, harvesting using centrifugation, cell lysis , and clarification, the clarified lysate was immediately loaded onto an immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography (IMAC) column, captured and eluted using step gradients with increasing concentrations of imidazole. Following proteolytic tag removal and desalting, the miniature spidroin, RepCT, was subjected to a polishing step consisting of anion exchange chromatography. This purification strategy resulted in a purity of RepCT exceeding 95 % and a recovery of 60 %. Biological activity of RepCT was confirmed by the induced ability to assemble into macroscopic fibers. However, RepCT in aqueous solutions has a tendency to form amorphous aggregates before fiber formation. Herein, several low molecular weight compounds were investigated for their ability to delay this tendency.",

            "text": "The Transcarbamoylase (ATCase) from Escherichia coli has become a textbook example of an enzyme that exhibits allosteric regulation. The enzyme is feedback inhibited by CTP and by UTP only in the presence of CTP. Recent studies using a fluorescent non-natural amino acid suggest that the binding of CTP and UTP are independent. In order to understand the mechanism of the synergistic inhibition of UTP in the presence of CTP a series of X-ray structures of the enzyme have been determined including the enzyme with CTP (2.1 \u00c5 resolution, R factor /R free = 20.43/24.00), the enzyme with dCTP (2.1 \u00c5 resolution, R factor /R free = 18.31/22.14), the enzyme with CTP and UTP (1.9 \u00c5 resolution, R factor /R free = 20.36/24.48), and the enzyme with dCTP and UTP (2.1 \u00c5 resolution, R factor /R free = 16.59/21.51). In addition, kinetic experiments have been preformed to verify that dCTP inhibits the enzyme similar to CTP, and the synergistic inhibition by UTP is similar with CTP and dCTP. The structure of the enzyme in the presence of dCTP and UTP clearly shows that the allosteric site of each regulatory chain of ATCase is composed of two nucleotide binding sites, a primary site to which CTP or dCTP bind and a secondary site to which UTP binds. Furthermore, full occupancy requires a divalent cation, such and Mg 2+ , to neutralize the charges of the phosphates of the two nucleotides that are opposed to each other. Analysis of these structures provides a molecular level understanding of the synergistic inhibition of ATCase by UTP in the presence of CTP. Nitric oxide signaling is required for regulating smooth muscle relaxation, platelet aggregation, neurotransmission, the immune response and related physiological activities. The nitric oxide receptor is soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC), a 150 kDa heterodimeric protein that catalyzes synthesis of cGMP, a secondary messenger. Binding of NO to the sGC heme in the \u03b2-subunit leads to the activation of catalysis by 100-200 fold. Compound YC-1, a small molecule allosteric stimulator of sGC, was discovered to work synergistically with NO for stimulating catalysis and has provided the starting point for the development of potential drugs in clinical trial for the treatment of hypertension. However, little is known about where these compounds bind to sGC and how they function to stimulate catalysis. We have established recombinant expression of sGC from Manduca sexta (hawkmoth) for biophysical studies and previously reported that YC-1 binding occurs in the N-terminal two-thirds of the protein and leads to a closing of the heme pocket. We now provide data indicating the \u03b1-subunit PAS domain is the likely binding site for this class of molecules. Expression of the domain leads to a soluble protein with apparent YC-1 binding. Removal of the domain leads to an sGC heme domain that does not respond to YC-1 but retains tight binding of NO and CO. Taken together with our related cross-linking and small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) measurements, our results suggest a direct interaction between the \u03b1-subunit PAS domain and the \u03b2-subunit H-NOX domain regulates NO binding and signal transduction to the catalytic domain, with YC-1 binding disrupting this interaction. Small crystals of the PAS domain have been obtained and may soon lead to clarification of the PAS domain role in YC-1 binding. (endoND), and a C-terminal dsRNA-binding domain (dsRBD). With other RNase III enzymes, Rnt1p shares the mechanism of dsRNA cleavage. Unlike other RNase IIIs, which cleave dsRNA without sequence specificity, Rnt1p specifically cleaves dsRNA hairpins capped with an AGNN tetra-loop, in which the guanosine is conserved, 14 base pairs distant from the tetra-loop. Models for the substrate selection have been proposed based on NMR solution structures of RNA hairpins (capped with either an AGAA or an AAGU tetra-loop) in complex with the dsRBD of Rnt1p. However, the mechanism by which the full-length enzyme binds and cleaves its RNA targets remains unclear. Here, we report the crystal structure of the endoND-dsRBD fragment of Rnt1p in complex with an RNA cleavage product at 2.5-angstrom resolution. This is the first structure of the catalytic complex of any eukaryotic RNase III. The structure reveals the active center assembly of Rnt1p immediately after the cleavage of an RNA hairpin substrate, providing detailed structural insights into the mechanism of substrate recognition and processing by the enzyme. The structure shows that Rnt1p recognizes the conserved guanosine in the second position of the AGNN tetra-loop with a novel helix-turn-helix (HTH) motif near the C-terminus of dsRBD. The guanosine recognition not only provides the substrate specificity of Rnt1p, but also helps position the substrate for accurate processing by the endoND. Based on the newly discovered HTH motif, novel features or substrate profiles of dsRNA-processing proteins can be obtained by rational modification of their dsRBDs, which could be developed into novel research or therapeutic tools. Indeed, the results presented here explain how RNase III may recognize a specific structural motif, provide a framework for in-depth functional analysis of RNase III and other dsRBD-containing proteins, and lay the basis for re-engineering the enzyme as tools for the regulation of gene expression. indicates that it has 87% identity (at amino acid level) to the VP1 of AGMPyV. We solved crystal structures of VP1 from both HPyV-9 and AGMPyV. The overall structure of the VP1 protein(s) from both viruses are similar and match the characteristics of VP1 of other known polyomaviruses (e.g. SV40). We also solved structures of VP1 from both viruses with their likely carbohydrate receptor ligands. In both cases, the ligand binds to a similar cavity on the outer surface of the VP1 protein. Small differences in the binding pocket may contribute to the different host ranges of HPyV-9 and AGMPyV. Our analysis also provides a structural basis for understanding the serological cross reactivity between the two polyomaviruses. References Post-translational modifications (PTMs) play critical roles in mediating protein-protein interactions, where they often act as specific recognition sites for a diverse set of PTM-binding domains. To complicate matters, many proteins have heavily modified regions of primary sequence prompting the question -how do interacting proteins recognize one or more PTMs in a complex environment of modifications? We have developed an approach to answer this question using peptide microarrays. Using the highly modified histone tails as a model, we synthesized and spotted several hundred highly-purified biotinylated peptides carrying different combinations of PTMs onto streptavidincoated surfaces. These peptide arrays were probed with recombinantly-expressed PTM-binding domains and evaluated to uncover new patterns of PTMs that altered binding. Importantly, we have found evidence that these combinatorial interactions are also important in vivo. Lastly, we have begun to extend this technology to the development of new diagnostic tools for histone PTMs and to understand combinatorial modifications in several other important proteins.",

            "text": "The ErbB family of receptors are fundamental drivers of many cellular processes. Often playing a major role in developmental biology and pathologic conditions such as cancers, a lot of research has gone into the development of therapeutics to alter the signaling via this receptor family. Signaling by the ErbB receptors requires receptor dimerization induced by ligand binding. This family contains 13 ligands with unique binding properties to the receptors as well as differential signaling and phenotypic outcome. These ligands exist as pro-forms on the cell surface and are released by proteases for autocrine/paracrine activation. Presently, the only existing methods for analyzing ErbB ligand autocrine loops are destructive, do not permit spatial resolution, high temporal resolution nor live-cell measurements. In this project I seek to develop sensors for the quantitative analysis of the ErbB autocrine loop with high spatial and temporal resolution. To reach this goal, I harness the power of yeast surface display to obtain ErbB ligand binders based on the human 10th fibronectin 3 (FN3) domain conjugated with environment sensitive fluorescent probes. I hypothesize that this new technology will provide the temporal and spatial resolution necessary to study the EGFR family autocrine and paracrine loops in vitro and in vivo and allow a better understanding of the extracellular signaling network. Metal resistant bacteria are a public health threat because of the rising use of metals as biocides. This work focuses on copper and silver, two metals which are commonly used as biocides in clinical and industrial settings. Previous work has identified genes and proteins involved in copper and silver resistance in Escherichia coli; the Cue and Cus protein systems are the primary effectors of copper and silver resistance. Previous microarrays suggest many genes significantly change expression upon copper stress; it is possible that these copper-responsive genes could influence metalresistance. The objective of this work is to investigate the metal-induced expression changes of proteins in E. coli. Because of the microarray data, we first investigated protein changes on a whole-cell level. To examine global protein changes, one-dimensional and two-dimensional SDS-PAGE were used to compare cell lysates of metal-stressed cultures to non-stressed. These gels showed no global protein expression changes upon copper or silver stress. The focus then turned to investigating changes in the expression levels of the CusCFBA efflux pump. First, Western Blotting was performed to measure in vivo CusF and CusB concentrations after metal stress. Copper and silver both induce expression of Cus proteins. To measure protein expression levels, quantitative Western Blotting was performed. Although microarrays suggest many genes change expression upon copper stress, we found no evidence for widespread protein expression changes. Cus proteins do significantly change expression upon copper and silver stress. Patterns are inherent in the nature. Repetitive and predictable arrangements of basic units define the patterns. Recognition of patterns is not new to scientific discoveries. For example, the specific and repetitive patterns of hydrogen bonds organize amino acid residues into very distinctive arrangements that represent protein secondary structure such as \u03b1-helices and \u03b2-sheets [1] . Effectively, hydrogen bonds provide the basic unit that defines the secondary structure patterns in proteins. Similarly, a basic unit to define protein packing would produce the next level of insight into protein structure. Many attempts have been made to categorize the tertiary structure of proteins in terms of distinctive and recognizable patterns; however, discovery of a descriptive basic unit of protein packing has eluded the field for years [2, 3] . Very recently, we identified a fundamental unit of tertiary packing named as 'knobsocket' motif in a study and design of helix packing [4]. The 'knob-socket' is a four residue tetrahedral motif, where the knob residue from one secondary structure element packs into a 3 residue socket on another secondary structure element. The residue composition involved in the knob-socket motif essentially represents an amino acid code for packing of protein structure. Applied to an analysis over 16,000 helical-sheet proteins' residue contacts calculated using Voronoi Polyhedra/Delauney Tessellations, the current work extends the knob-socket model to describe the packing at helix-sheet interface in proteins [5] . In addition to amino acid composition of sockets, the patterns of sockets that pack against each of the 20 amino acid knobs are investigated. These socket patterns that surround the knob-residues demonstrate unique preferences when characterized for helices versus for sheets. In general, helices mainly exhibit simple pockets consisting of 1 or 2 sockets, whereas pockets for sheets indicate denser packing with larger patterns of many sockets. These findings have direct implication on protein structure prediction and design. References Ras is a small GTP-binding protein (G protein) that functions as a molecular switch on the plasma membrane. The first 86 residues comprise lobe 1, which is conserved across Ras isoforms as well as other G proteins. Residues 87 to 166/7 comprise lobe 2 which interacts with the plasma membrane via a hyper variable region. Lobe 1 contains two important regions termed switch 1 (residues 24 to 40) and switch 2 (residues 57 to 75) which are responsible for binding to effectors. Many groups have provided evidence for Ras existing in two distinct GTP bound conformations: state 1 and state 2. In state 1, Ras has a weak ability to bind effectors despite being bound to GTP and in state 2 Ras has a strong ability to bind effectors. It is often assumed that Ras binds to Raf kinase only when in the active (GTP bound) conformation and not the inactive (GDP bound) conformation. Crystallographic studies have shown that Raf kinase will bind to GDP bound Ras, but this does not result in effector activation. We have explored the interactions of cancer causing Q61H-Kras in both state 1 and state 2 with the Ras binding domain (RBD) of Raf kinase to determine if it is sensitive to these putative Ras states. We have found that RafRBD does discriminate between state 1 and state 2. In addition to the formation of explicit hydrogen bonds between residues R89 and K84 on RafRBD with D38 and D33 on Kras, we have also determined that RafRBD becomes highly mobile when bound to state 2 Kras. Therefore, we suggest that the conformation of RafRBD is truly sensitive only to a very specific Ras conformation and the binding of GTP bound Ras alone may not be enough to fully activate RafRBD. Therefore, the discovery of small molecule inhibitors for Ras should be centered on identifying such Ras conformations and ligands that bind to them. Excitatory amino acid transporter 1 (EAAT1) plays an importance role in uptaking glutamate from the synaptic cleft and keeping the extracellular glutamate concentration under the neurotoxic level. The reentrant helical hairpin (HP) 1 is part of the intracellular gate of the transporter. Opening of this intracellular gate, the transporter releases sodium and substrate to the cytoplasm. However the mutual movement relationship between HP1 and transmembrane domain (TM) 4 during the transport cycle is not clear yet. We used paired cysteine mutagenesis to verify the proximity of residues located at HP1 and TM4 of EAAT1. A strong inhibition of transport by Copper(II) (1,10-Phenanthroline)3 (CuPh) is observed in the double mutant A243C/S366C, but not in the corresponding single mutants. Transport by the mutant A243C/S366C also was inhibited by Cd2+. When the sodium-containing medium was either supplemented with glutamate or replaced by potassium, conditions that increase the proportion of inward-facing transporters, the inhibition by CuPh was reduced. This suggests that the cysteine residues are far apart in the inward-facing conformation. The non-transportable substrate analogue D,L-threo-\u03b2-benzyloxyaspartate (TBOA) increases the proportion of outward-facing transporters. TBOA caused a clear potentiation of the cross-linking effect of CuPh. This suggests that the cysteines are indeed closer together in the outwardfacing conformation. Our results suggest that substrate and analogue can induce a relative movement between HP1 and TM4 of the glutamate transporter EAAT1 during the substrate transport, and the spatial relationship between HP1 and TM4 is changing during the transport cycle.

Our aim was to investigate the thermodynamic properties of the Leu81-Glu82 peptide bond hydrolysis reaction as preliminary observations suggested this peptide bond may exhibit unusually high stability. Recombinantly expressed CTRC and human cationic trypsinogen were purified to homogeneity using affinity chromatography. Trypsinogen was activated to trypsin with enteropeptidase. The trypsin constructs contained the S200A inactivating mutation, which eliminates the catalytic serine residue. Trypsin digestion by CTRC was followed by SDS-PAGE. Kinetic parameters of CTRC were determined using the Suc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-pNA substrate. We found that digestion of trypsin at Leu81 by CTRC did not proceed to completion but an equilibrium was attained, which in the presence of 5 \u03bcM calcium contained 60% uncleaved and 40% cleaved trypsin forms. This unusual thermodynamic equilibrium was confirmed by demonstrating that the cleaved Leu81-Glu82 peptide bond was re-synthesized by CTRC to reach the same equilibrium as observed in the forward cleavage reaction. Mutagenesis of the calcium coordinating glutamic acid (Glu82 and Glu85) residues to alanine shifted the equilibrium toward full digestion, indicating that structural integrity of the calcium binding loop is essential for the high thermodynamic stability of the Leu81-Glu82 peptide bond. On the other hand, mutations of Glu79 to alanine or lysine further stabilized the peptide bond and shifted the equilibrium towards the uncleaved form. Finally, using kinetic analysis of competitive inhibition, we found that trypsin cleaved at Leu81 had higher affinity (Ki: 0.3 \u00b5M) towards CTRC than intact, uncleaved trypsin (Ki: 2.9 \u00b5M). In conclusion, the chymotrypsin C-sensitive Leu81-Glu82 peptide bond in the calcium binding loop of human cationic trypsin exhibits high thermodynamic stability; favoring the uncleaved form in the presence of calcium. Although this phenomenon seems extraordinary, it may indicate that thermodynamically stable peptide bonds may be more widespread than previously appreciated.",

            "text": "Eukaryotic translation initiation factor (eIF) 5 acts as a GTPase activating protein for eIF2 that carries the first tRNA onto the ribosome. Recent data have shown that eIF5 antagonizes eIF1, enhancing its release from the PIC in response to start codon recognition. eIF1 release promotes the conversion of the PIC from open conformation that scan the mRNA to closed one arrested on the start codon. Recent data indicate that an interaction occurs between eIF1A and eIF5 upon start codon recognition by PIC. We observed fluorescence energy transfer (FRET) between fluorescently labeled derivatives of eIF1A and eIF5 within the PIC that is strongly enhanced upon start codon recognition. Our data indicate that the C-terminal tail (CTT) of eIF1A moves closer to the N-terminal region of eIF5 upon start codon recognition. This conformational change is involved in stabilizing the closed state of PIC. The kinetics of this FRET change mirror the kinetics of eIF1 release from the PIC on start codon recognition, suggesting two events are coupled. Mutations in eIF1A CTT that decrease the fidelity of start codon recognition in vivo uncouple eIF1 release from eIF1A CTT movement towards eIF5 NTD as well as from release of inorganic phosphate from eIF2. Our results suggest a model in which eIF1 release from PIC promotes movement of the eIF1A CTT towards eIF5 NTD that in turn promotes Pi release from eIF2, converting it to its inactive, GDP-bound state. Rheb (Ras homology enriched in brain) is a Ras GTPase that is controlled via cycling between a biologically active GTP form and an inactive GDP-bound form, similar to most Ras proteins. However, Rheb also has unique biological functions in cell cycle regulation relative to other Ras proteins. The biological activity of Rheb is controlled in part by an important protein interaction with the GTPase-Activating Protein (GAP) Tumor Suppressor Complex (TSC2) that stimulates cell growth, particularly by regulating the mammalian Target Of Rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, which is essential to cell growth, energy and nutrient levels. Yet, molecular details of the interaction between Rheb and TSC2 are largely unknown. A truncated 218 amino acid GTPasebinding derivative of TSC2 has shown activity towards Rheb. We are using NMR spectroscopy, isothermal titration calorimetry, as well as biochemical assays to characterize important features of the protein interaction that help regulate TSC2GAP-stimulated activity. We expect to translate our findings into a more pertinent biological understanding of this Ras-protein interaction and its role in cell signaling activity involving the mTOR pathway. Heparin is a glycosaminoglycan with many biological activities linked to its ability to interact with numerous proteins. Our preliminary studies have shown the ability of heparan sulfate and a Heparin mimic, sucrose octasulfate (SOS), to bind to TSC2-218, but not to Rheb. We present characterization studies outlining the TSC2-218:heparin interaction using biophysical techniques such as such as NMR and circular dichrosim (CD) spectroscopy, isothermal titration and differential scanning calorimetry (ITC and DSC, respectively). In addition, biochemical approaches such as in-vitro binding, and digestive enzyme assays help to address structural and functional features of the TSC2-218:heparin interaction, as well as, outline how heparin might be used to help regulate the binding of Rheb to TSC2. To our knowledge, this is the first example of the use of heparin in the regulation of the Ras-related protein interaction. Both studies are expected to advance our understanding of important molecular features of a Ras protein interaction that can be targeted in the subsequent design of Rheb constructs with altered binding affinity to TSC2.",

We have designed three formats containing cobalt IMAC media, convenient for rapid and simple smallscale purification and screening of his-tagged proteins. The formats, a gravity flow column, a spin column and a 96-well plate, allow efficient parallel purification of proteins in \u00b5g to mg scale within 40 minutes using fast and easy protocols to help ensure pure target proteins. His-tagged GFP expressed in E.coli protein was used as target protein to demonstrate the functionality of the formats. The results show that recovery and purity is > 80 % using all formats.

Sec. 2, Nankang, Taipei, 11629, Taiwan Small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) conjugation and interaction are increasingly associated with various cellular processes. However, little is known about the cellular signaling mechanisms that regulate proteins for distinct SUMO paralogue conjugation and interactions. Using the transcriptional coregulator Daxx as a model, we show that SUMO paralogue-selective binding and conjugation is regulated by phosphorylation of the Daxx SUMO-interacting motif (SIM). NMR structural studies show that Daxx 732E-I-I-V-L-S-D-S-D740 is a bona fide SIM that binds to SUMO-1 in a parallel orientation. Daxx-SIM is phosphorylated by CK2 kinase at residues S737 and S739. Phosphorylation promotes Daxx-SIM binding affinity toward SUMO-1 over SUMO-2/3, causing Daxx preference for SUMO-1 conjugation and interaction with SUMO-1-modified factors. Furthermore, Daxx-SIM phosphorylation enhances Daxx to sensitize stress-induced cell apoptosis via anti-apoptotic gene repression. Our findings provide structural insights into the Daxx-SIM:SUMO-1 complex, a model of SIM phosphorylation-enhanced SUMO paralogue-selective modification and interaction, and phosphorylation-regulated Daxx function in apoptosis. We also studied the interaction of poly-SUMO with RNF-4 poly-SIM and determined the binding constants of poly-SUMO with individual SIMs in RNF-4.",

Some proteins play important roles in biomineralization. In this decade papers described that inorganic compounds are accumulated using peptides derived from sequences of precipitating proteins have been increasingly reported [1, 2] , because peptides would be promising molecules for construction of organic-inorganic nano structure. However, there are few studies for well-controlled precipitation such as site-specific and homogeneously shaped precipitation, so far. Therefore, focusing on silica precipitation, we attempted to construct a silica addressable precipitation system using designed peptides with peptide nucleic acids (PNA) and DNAs. At first, we designed a silicaprecipitating peptide with PNAs (SPPP) consisting of two parts. One part was composed of a silicaprecipitating peptide sequence referred to the previous paper [3] . The other part was a PNA sequence, a binding module to a complementary DNA sequence. Thus, SPPP would interact with the DNA site-specifically, and then silica could precipitate only on the peptide not on the DNA, resulting in silica addressable precipitation. Using SPPP we checked silica precipitation by DLS, AFM, and SEM-EDX. As a result, SPPP showed similar silica precipitation to silica-precipitating peptides. Now we are trying to conduct and optimize the addressable precipitation of silica using SPPP with 1500 bp DNA including the complementary DNA sequence to the PNA sequence. These demonstrations would show examples of well-controlled inorganic precipitation systems using organic compounds. The system for addressable precipitation would be a promising powerful tool in nanobio and material fields. REFERENCES [1] H. Acar, R. Garifullin, M. O. Guler, Langmuir, 27, 1079 -1084 (2011 .",

Functions may be defined globally for an entire protein such the protein's cellular function or more regionally such as its ability to bind to small molecules. We will present a system that integrates comprehensive information attributed to protein structures as derived from the Protein Structure Initiative's Structural Biology Knowledgebase (PSI SBKB) and open biological resources. The types of information or annotations include protein domain assignments, the presence of structural motifs with defined functions, the presence of specific substructures, assignments to cellular and biochemical pathways, disease associations, small molecule interactions, the presence of defined pockets, and participation in proteinprotein interactions. Collectively these annotations are used to predict molecular functions as described in the Gene Ontology hierarchy and interactions with small molecules described in DrugBank. A searchable web interface to the results was created at the URL http: Here, we computationally identify residues at the interface of Arp3 and Arp2 in the Arp2/3 complex that dominate conformational changes during activation of the complex. Structural analysis, homology modeling, Evolutionary Trace calculations, and virtual alanine scan modeling were used to identify Arp3: R161, S226, and R447. The ARP3 mutation R161A reduces neurite formation but increases F-actin content in cell-culture. The ribosome is a complex macromolecule responsible for translation of the genetic code and protein synthesis. The ribosome has two unequal subunits of which the larger one contains the peptidyl transferase center (PTC), the enzymatic activity that forms peptide bonds. A 100 \u00c5 long tunnel from the PTC to the cytoplasm serves as a conduit for transport of nascent peptides to the cytoplasm or membrane translocon. The tips of the extended loops (also called tentacles) of two proteins, L4 and L22, contribute to the surface of the narrowest portion of Escherichia coli's exit tunnel. Previous researchers in the Lindahl-Zengel lab have identified mutations in the tentacles of these proteins which bestow resistance to a class of antibiotics referred to as macrolides. Although these mutants have the advantage of growing in the presence of the antibiotic, erythromycin, they have the disadvantage of growing slower than the wildtype.",

The objective of my research is to conduct functional and assembly analyses within the ribosome's large subunit of E. coli, which contains mutations within the L4 or L22 proteins. My results show a decrease in peptidyltransferase activity as well as assembly defects in all the mutants, and therefore, highlight the importance of the L4 and L22 proteins. The wrapping of DNA into nucleosomes functions both as a packaging mechanism and as a regulatory strategy. Histone variants and modifications regulate DNA transcription in vivo, however, the change in binding free energy necessary to 'loosen' a nucleosome and allow transcription has not been quantified. Here we present single molecule, optical tweezers measurements determining the force-dependent rates of nucleosome rewinding and unwinding for both wild-type and SWI/ SNF-independent (sin) mutant nucleosomes, yielding their absolute and relative binding free energies.

The Bacteriophage T4 packaging motor generates high forces >60pN and translocates DNA at rates exceeding 2000bp/s, though it exhibits an unusually wide variability in rates. Understanding these motors is important as they have many potential nanoengineering applications. Though much is known about the dynamic activity of these motors from both bulk and single molecule biophysical techniques, little is known about their structure and the structural details leading to their unique properties. Recently, Rao, Rossmann and coworkers obtained X-ray and cryo-electron microscopy structures of the ATPase responsible for DNA translocation, gp17, and have proposed a model for motor function based on interesting differences in the two structures.

Associated with numerous biochemical pathways, these elaborate protein complexes consist of a capsid-like shell surrounding a specific collection of interior enzymes. The proteinaceous shell, which assembles from many hexameric BMC-domain protein subunits, has a paradoxical function; it must remain permeable to substrates and cofactors required for the encapsulated metabolism, while simultaneously restricting the entry of competing small molecules and preventing the efflux of on-pathway intermediates contained within the lumen. Understanding how these protein shells achieve these two contradictory functions has been a longstanding goal. Recently, research efforts have focused on characterizing the tandem BMC-domain shell proteins, which assemble to form pseudohexameric trimers. In the case of these tandemdomain shell proteins, it appears that symmetrybreaking has an important functional consequence. A pair of crystal structures of the tandem BMC domain shell protein EutL from the ethanolamine utilization (eut) BMC in E. coli indicate that the protein undergoes a conformational rearrangement that dramatically alters the porosity of the BMC shell through the opening of a large central pore. The emphasis of the research presented here is directed toward understanding the mechanism and regulation of the conformational change observed in the EutL shell protein.

Crystal structures of both EGFR and ErbB2 have been solved for the extracellular ligand binding domains of the proteins, but the whole receptor crystal structures are still not solved. We have developed a novel process of production of EGFR and ErbB2 supported by nanolipoproteins (NLPs) that allows the isolation of these proteins without the use of detergents that often results in less purity and loss of function. NLPs are discoidal structures of 10~20 nm diameter, arising from self-assembly of nanolipoproteins around phospholipid bilayers. These bilayers closely mimic the cell membrane and can support a variety of functional membrane proteins. Here we reported for the first time cell free synthesis of functional EGFR and ErbB2 as whole receptors supported by NLPs. The association of membrane proteins to NLPs were confirmed by nickel purification based on His-tagged apolipoproteins and followed western blot. The function of EGFR was confirmed by phosphorylation of he receptor. The function of ErbB2 was confirmed by binding of antibody that is specific to correctly folded extracellular domain of ErbB2, as well as specific phosphorylation of tyrosine 1248. Our method of NLP assembly allows for generating soluble and functional polytopic membrane proteins and providing a platform for structural and functional characterization of membrane protein such as EGFR and ErbB2.

For several decades, this multi-cellular organism has been used to study intricate biological and molecular processes in fields ranging from developmental biology to neurobiology. In a complex eukaryote like C. elegans, cell and tissue heterogeneity restricts the usefulness of large-scale, mass spectrometrybased analysis of an organism's proteome. As worm cell lines are not available and enriching for specific cells or tissues is challenging, researchers cannot systematically identify low abundance proteins expressed in specifc cells or tissues from whole-worm lysates. To isolate protein from specific cells, we have engineered a family of mutant C. elegans phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetases capable of appending azide-or alkynyl-bearing analogs of phenylalanine to tRNAPhe. As these analogs are not substrates for any of the wild-type aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases in C. elegans, we achieved cell type selectivity by spatially restricting the expression of a mutant synthetase using cell type-specific promoters. Because proteins from those cells that express the mutant synthetase -and only those cells -contain the analogs, they can be enriched by treatment with alkyneor azide-functionalized biotin reagents and subsequent affinity chromatography for identification by LC/MS-MS.",

While the broad dynamical landscape of proteins is known to promote a number of functional events on multiple timescales, it is yet unknown whether structural and functional enzyme homologues rely on the same concerted residue motions to perform their catalytic function. It is hypothesized that networks of contiguous flexible residue motions occurring on the biologically relevant millisecond timescale evolved to promote and/ or preserve optimal enzyme catalysis. In this study, we use a combination of NMR relaxation dispersion and titration experiments to successfully capture and compare the role of conformational flexibility in two structural homologues of the pancreatic ribonuclease family: RNase A and ECP. In addition to conserving the same catalytic residues and structural fold, both homologues show similar, yet functionally distinct clusters of millisecond dynamics, suggesting that conformational flexibility can be conserved among protein folds displaying low sequence identity. The reduced conformational flexibility of ECP correlates with its lower catalytic activity, a result that can be dynamically and functionally reproduced in RNase A upon creation of a chimeric hybrid between the two proteins. These results support the hypothesis that conformational flexibility is partly required to catalytic function in homologous enzyme folds, further highlighting the importance of dynamic residue sectors in the structural organization of proteins. Many superresolution imaging microscopies using single-molecule fluorescence require the ability to change a dark fluorogen into a bright emitter. Our objective was to use an enzymatic reduction by the nitroreductase enzyme to convert a nitro-aryl fluorogen into a bright fluorophore. The red-emitting, push-pull product fluorophore was identified as a hydroxylamino derivative by synthesis of model compounds and optical spectroscopy. This emitter is bright enough to be detectable on the single-molecule level for fluorophores on a surface and inside of cells. Bulk kinetic analysis of the enzymatic reduction shows rate dependence on NADH and the fluorogen concentration, as expected. We used the enzymatic generation of fluorophores to extract subdiffraction information about the localizations of fluorophores and nitroreductase enzymes inside of cells. Turnover Activated Localization Microscopy is a complementary mechanism to blinking and photoactivation for controlling the emission of single molecules for superresolution imaging.

            "text": "Structural and kinetic investigations of the dynamic plasticity in the active site of the carboxyl transferase domain in pyruvate carboxylase Adam Lietzan, Martin St. Maurice Biological Sciences, Marquette University, 903 N 14th Street, Milwaukee, WI, 53233 Pyruvate carboxylase (PC, EC 6.4.1.1), a multifunctional biotin-dependent enzyme, is integral in gluconeogenesis and has an anaplerotic role in replenishing oxaloacetate (OAA) in the TCA cycle. PC catalyzes the carboxylation of pyruvate to OAA with the concomitant cleavage of MgATP. Biotin, which is covalently tethered to a conserved lysine residue located in the biotin carboxyl carrier protein (BCCP) domain, is carboxylated at the N1 position in the biotin carboxylase (BC) domain. Acting as a mobile carboxyl carrier, carboxybiotin physically translocates from the BC domain to a neighboring carboxyl transferase (CT) domain where it is decarboxylated. The carboxyl group is then transferred to the nucleophilic enolpyruvate, forming OAA. While much of the catalytic mechanism of PC has been well described, the details of how catalysis is coordinated between remote active sites remain unclear. For example, it has been demonstrated that substrates and substrate analogs can induce the translocation and subsequent decarboxylation of carboxybiotin in the CT domain, implying that substrate binding is necessary for the formation of the biotin-binding site in the CT domain. The molecular basis for this effect, however, has not been delineated. To gain insights into the formation of the biotin-binding site, we determined the X-ray crystal structures of the CT domain from Rhizobium etli PC in the presence and absence of its substrate pyruvate at 2.5 and 3.0 \u00c5 resolution, respectively. The most pronounced difference between the two structures lies within a flexible loop (Arg621-Asn630), which forms a portion of the CT domain active site. This loop assumes two distinct conformations depending on the presence or absence of pyruvate. When substrate is bound, the loop closes the active site through a hydrogen bonding interaction between Tyr628 of the loop and Asp590 located across the active site cleft. This interaction stabilizes the loop, creating a binding pocket for carboxybiotin. In the absence of substrate, the loop is displaced leaving the active site accessible to pyruvate. Steady state kinetic analysis of PC mutated at residues Tyr628 and Asp590 further support this finding. This is the first detailed description of plasticity in the CT domain of PC during catalysis. Allophanate hydrolase (AH) is a hydrolytic enzyme that belongs to the Amidase Signature (AS) family. AS family enzymes share a common catalytic mechanism, using a Ser-cisSer-Lys triad to hydrolyze the amide bonds in diverse substrates. In one context, AH serves as the terminal enzyme in s-triazine ring catabolism and is important in the bio-degradation of herbicides such as atrazine. In an alternate context, AH works in conjunction with urea carboxylase (UC), to break down urea into NH3 and CO2 in a subset of bacteria, algae and fungi. In Saccharomycetes, UC and AH are components of a single enzyme, urea amidolyase, a key virulence factor of Candida albicans. Insights gained into the structure and function of AH will further elucidate the molecular basis for catalysis in the AS enzyme family, and will offer the initial steps in the development of new therapeutics designed to combat systemic candidiasis. AH from Granulibacter bethesdensis was crystallized and the X-ray structure was solved to 2.2 \u00c5 resolution. The structure reveals a substrate analog, malonate, bound at the active site and confirms the Ser-cisSer-Lys catalytic triad in the active site. The structure also offers insight into substrate specificity determinants in AH. A comparison of AH with malonamidase (MAE2), an AS enzyme catalyzing hydrolysis on the very similar substrate, malonamate, reveals a loop in AH, absent in MAE2, that alters the substrate binding position. In addition, two residues conserved only in AH (Tyr299 and Arg307) are within hydrogen bonding distance of malonate. Studies using site-directed mutagenesis and steady-state kinetics reveal that the specificity constant (kcat/Km) ratio for allophanate compared to the analog, biuret, decreases ~200 fold for Y299F compared to the wild-type enzyme. In addition, the R307A and R307M mutants are nearly inactive. These results suggest a role for these residues in providing substrate and intermediate stabilization. Finally, the structure suggests the presence of an additional C-terminal domain unique to AH. Truncation of this domain does not influence the enzyme activity. It is hypothesized that the C-terminal domain may act as a functional linker between UC and AH. Future studies will focus on investigating the function of this domain, and the potential for substrate channeling and cooperactivity between UC and AH. Biochemical and structural studies of membrane protein usually require their stabilization in solution with detergents. Traditional detergents can be poor mimetics of the native lipid bilayer, and often purified membrane proteins show reduced activity and stability. Additionally, choosing the right detergent is often a time consuming process as one has to screen a large selection of available detergents to find a suitable candidate for the application. Lipopeptide detergents (LPDs) are a new class of amphiphiles that are engineered to from small micelles that mimic the lipid bilayer and act a universal class of detergent for membrane protein studies. An LPD molecule consist of a 25 amino acid peptide designed to form an \u03b1-helix with fatty acyl chains covalently attached to both ends . These molecules self-assemble into cylindrical micelles with a hydrophilic exterior and a hydrophobic interior made up of the fatty acyl chains. Previously, we have reported the crystal structure of LPD-12 at 1.2 \u00c5 which formed an octomer composed of 4 sets of antiparallel coiled-coil dimers. Here we report a new 2.1 \u00c5 structure of an LPD based on a different peptide sequence, resulting in a completely reorganized micelle. LPD5Q-14 assembles as a 9-mer made up of 3 trimers, each with with an \"up-up-down\" topology. The nine \u03b1-helices form a cylinder that encapsulates eighteen 14-carbon fatty acyl chains. The micelle has a 3-fold pseudo-symmetry and shows a more regular cylindrical packing relative to LPD-12.. We present a detailed analysis of LPD5Q-14 packing and compare the structures of the 2 LPD micelles. There is increasing experimental and theoretical evidence that G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) exhibit an ensemble of conformations, each of which could bind to different ligands and lead to different responses. At thermal equilibrium, the inactive conformation is energetically favorable, but binding to an agonist can stabilize the G protein-coupled state. For the cannabinoid CB1 receptor, mutating a threonine residue (T210) on the third transmembrane helix to an alanine changes the CB1 receptor to a fully inactive conformation that does not activate the G protein. However, the T210I mutation changes it to an activated conformation with dramatically increased constitutive activity (1) . To understand these experimental observations, we used the Gensemble Monte Carlo method to predict the ensemble of low-lying conformations of these three receptors. To validate these predicted conformations, we docked known ligands to them using the DarwinDock hierarchical docking method. Our results explain the site-directed mutagenesis data. We find that the inverse agonist rimonabant is anchored by two hydrogen bonds to W279, which explains the experimental importance of this residue. The agonist WIN55212-2 forms an aromatic stack with this W279 and F200, both of which have been shown experimentally to be important. We further investigated how the T210A or the WT conformations would change in the presence of an agonist with 20 ns of molecular dynamics (NAMD) using a fully solvated membrane. Neither of these receptors changed to resemble the active T210I mutant. The WT receptor formed the signature ionic locks found in the inactive T210A receptor. The computational docking results of agonist WIN55212-2 suggest that it prefers to bind to the receptor's inactive conformation. This is consistent with the recently crystallized beta 1 and beta 2 adrenergic receptors in the absence of G proteins with a bound agonist.

Biochemistry 45 (17) The pathways for the synthesis of tetrahydrofolates form the core of one carbon metabolism. As such, these pathways are an excellent source of targets in the treatment of cancer. 5-formyltetrahydrofolate (5-formylTHF) is administered in these treatments, ether as a rescue agent or as an enhancer. The only enzyme known to use 5-formylTHF as a substrate is 5,10-methenyltetrahydrofolate synthetase (MTHFS). This enzyme catalyzes the conversion of 5-formylTHF to 5,10-methenyltetrahydrofolate in conjunction with the hydrolysis of ATP to ADP. To better understand the function of MTHFS, we have investigated the determinants of ATP binding the active site of the enzyme through site-directed mutagenesis followed by a circular dichroism spectroscopy and kinetics. Mutagenesis of aspartates at positions 124 and 154 to alanine (mutants D124A and D154A) resulted in no detectable activity while mutants of lysine (K3A), arginine (R7A and R125A), and tryptophan (W153A) substantially decreased MTHFS' affinity for ATP. Mutations of aspartates at positions 81 and 151 had little effect on the binding of ATP by the enzyme. Circular dichroism data was consistent with all mutants being folded. Taken together with published co-crystal data of MTHFS with its substrates, these results are largely consistent with a simple proximity model. The greater the charges in an interaction between a side chain and the ATP and the closer that interaction is to phosphate transferred from the ATP, the greater the effect mutation has on the activity of the enzyme.",

            "text": "The effect of protein shells on the antioxidant activity of protein-encapsulated platinum nanoparticles Kyeong Kyu Kim 1, 2 , Boi San 2 , Sang Hyun Moh 2 1 Molecular Cell Biology, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Suwon, Republic of Korea, 2 Sungkyunkwan Advanced Institute of Nanotechnology, Suwon, Republic of Korea Protein shells have been used as nanoplatforms for the synthesis of metallic nanoparticles for their biomedical and biocatalytic applications. However, it is challenging to maximize the catalytic activity of nanoparticles encapsulated by protein shells, as little research exists regarding their effect on the catalytic activities or physicochemical properties of nanoparticles. In this study, we used the following 3 proteins to synthesize platinum nanoparticles: aminopeptidase PepA, serine endoprotease DegP, and Clp protease. We then compared the catalytic properties of these proteinshelled platinum nanoparticles as scavengers of reactive oxygen species. These protein-shelled platinum nanoparticles displayed the catalase-and superoxide dismutase-like activities by quenching H2O2 and O2-, respectively. However, the resulting particle's size and activity depended on the particular protein shell. These results proved that the catalytic activity of proteinshelled platinum nanoparticles is greatly affected by the physicochemical properties of their protein shells. Collectively, current study indicates that protein shells are important determinants for the physical and catalytic property of PtNPs and it is necessary to screen protein shells to optimize nanoparticles. Furthermore, considering the reduced cell toxicity of protein-shelled platinum nanoparticles compared to those synthesized by chemical stabilizers, it is suggested that they serve as biocatalysts in medical treatments such as reactive oxygen species scavengers. Asparaginyl-glycine sequences have been observed to undergo deamidation, peptide bond isomerization and racemization. It has been suggested that the occurrence of the dipeptide may shorten the expected turnover rate of a protein. However, the dipeptide has also been observed to form apparently stable and functional 2-aminosuccinimide structures in at least one evolutionarily conserved protein family. The occurrence in some mollusc and arthropod protein sequences of asparaginyl-glycine dipeptide tandem repeats that are not readily susceptible to mass-spectrometric analysis suggests that these sequences may be spontaneously forming polymeric 2-aminosuccinimide structures. T-cell receptor (TCR) binding to specific peptidemajor histocompatibility complex (pMHC) is typically very low (micromolar) affinity, necessitating the use of multimeric pMHCs to label T lymphocytes stably. We report here a novel photocrosslinkable pMHC reagent, which, even as a monomer, can efficiently and specifically stain cognate T cells. We also use this reagent to probe T-cell activation, and find that a covalently bound pMHC is more stimulatory than an agonist pMHC on a planar lipid bilayer. This shows that serial engagement of TCRs with their pMHC ligands is dispensable for activation when a substantial fraction of TCR is stably engaged. Lastly, we find that pMHC-engaged TCRs rapidly migrate to the center of the immunological synapse upon activation, while most unengaged TCRs remain in the periphery, suggesting that ligand engagement enables a TCR/CD3 linkage to the cytoskeleton. This work was supported by a Cancer Research Institute postdoctoral fellowship (to J.X.) and by funding from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute In order to capture natural protein motions in protein designs, computational protein design must model backbone flexibility effectively. We have implemented a novel design algorithm termed \"plastic design\" to incorporate backbone and side chain dynamics. Preliminary studies suggest that designing proteins independently on multiple templates of a protein backbone lead to convergence of the design algorithm on different amino acid rotamers for different backbone conformations, implying unrealistic side chain dynamics. In our design algorithm, \"parent\" rotamers, chosen from a rotamer library generated from highresolution crystallographic protein structures, are allowed to vary by \u00b110\u00b0 on any of the side chain \u03c7 torsion angles, producing \"child\" rotamers. Multiple conformations of the protein backbone are sampled from a molecular dynamics simulation and amino acid parent rotamers are selected in the context of the average energy across this set of backbone conformations using the optimal child rotamers of the selected parent rotamer. Previous models for backbone variability have included considering multiple states of the protein backbone when performing protein design (Allen and Mayo, 2010) or calculating backbone \"backrub\" motions by rotating the backbone between C\u03b1 atoms (Smith and Kortemme, 2008) . Our method both models backbone flexibility through the use of multiple templates but also enforces natural side chain movements by allowing slight side chain deformities between backbone conformations. We have found that plastic designs more closely resemble MD simulations and produce designs that are more amenable to natural, dynamic protein backbones. Ultimately, we hope that plastic multi-template design will produce protein designs that experimentally exhibit the designed properties more effectively and reliably than single template methods or multi-template methods that lack side chain deformability. One of the big promises of Computational Protein Design (CPD) is its potential for engineering \"designer enzymes.\" A general framework to build enzymes is one of the biggest contributions that CPD can provide to synthetic biology. However, rate accelerations from computationally designed enzymes are several orders of magnitude below those of natural enzymes. Furthermore, attempts at computational design of certain, well-characterized reactions have so far produced only limited results. Chorismate mutase (CM) catalyzes the pericyclic rearrangement of chorismate to prephenate. Studies have shown that enzymatic catalysis is achieved by stabilizing the chair-like transition state through electrostatic interactions with sidechains. We have previously demonstrated that targeted ligand placement (TLP) can be used to place an ab initio transition-state structure into the active site of E. coli CM with the proper wild-type contacts. Though previous efforts have recapitulated the active site in a wild-type scaffold attempts to engineer CM activity into a non-native scaffold have not been reported. An ideal CM active site would preferentially bind the diaxial form of chorismate. This requires several catalytic contacts, making TLP in a new scaffold difficult. Increased computational resources allowing for large-scale TLP and the use of molecular dynamics (MD) as a prescreen have encouraged us to revisit this problem. We developed a partially automated workflow to find suitable scaffolds for the CM reaction. TLP was performed on a set of high-resolution crystal structures that had ligands of similar size to chorismate and that had a wild-type arginine in the binding pocket. Sequence design was performed on 485 decoys from successful active-site searches. MD was performed on 121 decoys from this set. Ten of these sequences, on 9 different scaffolds were suggested to be active. No CM activity was detected in both in vivo and in vitro assays. We obtained a crystal structure for one of our designs, based on the PDB scaffold 3QT9. The crystal structure showed divergence from the design primarily due to backbone movement at two adjacent arginines. Based on these results, we are currently creating a second set of designs within this same scaffold. This work is supported by the DARPA Protein Design Processes grant and a National Security Science and Engineering Faculty Fellowship award to S.L.M. Computational enzyme design is a very promising area of research. However, current computational design tools suffer from a serious limitation: they cannot reliably predict active sequences and thus produce a large number of false positives. Consequently, investigators have had to rely on screening hundreds of designs to find a few active ones. In addition, both protein dynamics and explicit solvation are important aspects of enzyme function and are therefore critical to predicting enzymatic activity. Unfortunately, protein design methodology rarely takes these factors into account. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, on the other hand, can model both. In this work, we develop a MD protocol that provides a reliable and computationally feasible way to pre-screen enzyme designs. Preliminary results have shown excellent agreement between experimental data and MD predictions. We tested the generality of the methodology on a larger and more diverse set of enzymes for which experimental data already exist. The method is general, sensitive (0.70) and specific (0.72). It also exhibits high negative predictive value (0.91) and promising computational performance, and will be useful for de novo computational enzyme design.

These glycans also facilitate viral transmission, and are therefore novel targets for entry inhibitors. Antiviral lectins have been proposed as agents to bind to the glycosylation of viruses and prevent viral entry into host cells. Our work focuses on cyanovirin-N, which has potent anti-HIV activity, mediated by binding to the N-linked oligosaccharide moiety of the envelope protein gp120. Cyanovirin-N has two binding quasi-symmetric binding domains, A and B. Work in our lab and others demonstrated that multivalent interactions through engagement of both domains, and/or through formation of domain swapped dimers, are necessary for potent antiviral activity; the activity can be further improved by designing covalent dimers of CVN. We have designed a covalent dimer to further explore the multivalent geometric requirements for antiviral activity, which can also act as a scaffold that will incorporate individually designed binding domains in a modular fashion to further enhance antiviral activity. In order to individually design the binding domains and to better understand the ability of cyanovirin-N to bind glycans with high specificity, we have used computational methods to dissect the determinants for affinity and specificity at the sequence level. Specifically, using Perturbation Response Scanning (PRS) analysis we predicted the affinity of point mutants of cyanovirin-N for the native ligand. Experimental characterization using an 1H-15N HSQC experiment confirmed the accuracy of the predictions. Currently, we are utilizing PRS to design more potent antiviral lectins based on cyanovirin-N by optimizing single oligomannose binding sites.

The design of novel protein binders to target a given protein interface is a fundamental challenge in protein engineering. The task of binder design is complicated by the many degrees of freedom inherent in the taskthe selection of binding epitope, the protein and binder backbone geometry, the position of the binder relative to the protein to be bound, and the selection of a binder sequence which is both compatible with the given backbone and promotes binding at the chosen epitope. Here we present our work using designability to narrow the search space to be explored in order to design a peptide binder to a given protein interface. We have selected the hemagglutinin protein from human influenza as a target for a peptide binder. Hemagglutinin is a key surface protein in the human influenza, instrumental in host cell identification, binding, and viral fusion. Recent design efforts have shown some success in designing key hot-spot residues and grafting these onto compatible backbone scaffolds. We propose using the concept of designability to simplify the design process, by first identifying backbone geometries compatible with the given epitope, followed by sequence selection that is compatible with the given interface and that will target the given epitope.",

Structural hotspots identified on \u03b1/ \u03b2 barrel enzymes that lead to cold activity may be applicable to other \u03b1/\u03b2 barrel enzymes. We identify these hotspots through random mutagenesis on thermostable \u03b2-galactosidase. Chromogenic screening (blue white screening) is used to identify \u03b2-galactosidase that is active at lower temperatures. The goal of this project is to create a thermostable yet cold active \u03b2-galactosidase through random mutagenesis. At the same time, we want to identify the mutations that are responsible for the increased activity at those lowers temperatures and analyze how it altered the structure of the enzyme. Random mutagenesis was used on the gene that codes for \u03b2-galactosidase from Geobacillus stearothermophilus, a thermophilic bacterium. This thermostable \u03b2-galactosidase has optimal activity at 70\u00b0C and has little to no activity at 37\u00b0C. The chromogenic substrate X-gal was used to identify \u03b2-galactosidase activity, as indicated by blue E. coli colonies. Of 20,000 colonies that were screened at 37\u00b0C, only eleven exhibited activity. Those colonies were sequenced to identify the resulting amino acid mutations. Those amino acid changes were then individually screened using site directed primers in order to identify which of them lead to the cold activity. Anti-Human IgG is a commonly used antibody for recognizing all human IgG isotypes (IgG1, IgG2, IgG3 and IgG4). Anti-Human IgG antibody cysteinylation at one of complimentarity determining region (CDR) was found causing antibody potency or activity decrease. Therefore, using yeast display technology, we made mutant library targeting this CDR region and sorted the library, 28 unique mutations were identified that were free of Cysteine in which Cysteine to Serine mutation (C\u2192S) represented 46.2% of all mutants that are still retain similar binding affinity. We then expressed antihuman IgG with C\u2192S mutant in IgG2a and IgG2b scaffold. The ELISA analysis of the mutant antibody produced from CHO cells showed that IgG2b scaffold antibody had reduced reactivity compared to the parental hybridoma antibody. Further investigation showed that glycosylation was involved in interference with antibody activity. This suggested that differences in IgG2b glycosylation patterns between the hybridoma and CHO produced IgG2b mutant antibody influenced activity. We thus created an equivalent C\u2192S mutant antibody using an IgG2a scaffold and expressed it in CHO cells. This antibody showed no impairment of immunoreactivity against human IgG isotypes as determined by EIA and Biacore studies. This study demonstrated that antibody cysteinylation and glycosylation have significant impact on recombinant anti-human IgG monoclonal antibody activity and affinity. Finally, a stable CHO cell line is generated to express the engineered antibody with secretion level of >200mg/L anti-Human IgG antibody.",

Our analysis has an excellent correlation with each of the two main movements described by principal component analysis (PCA), and indicated that this protein adopts slightly different closed conformations to make available specific hydrogen bond interactions for each ligand, allowing a single mechanism to attain multiple specificity. Furthermore, to advance in the molecular mechanism of ligand binding, we use Markov State Models (MSMs) built from atomistic simulations that increased the sampling for the conformational states along the trajectory. We show that our model can predict the bound state, binding free energy, and association rate of this system with reasonable accuracy. In particular, it was observed a dominant a role for the conformational selection to reach the encounter complex, previous to the induced fit to achieve the bound state. In this work we analyze the dynamical correlation maps, free energy landscape, hydrogen bond and contacts maps present in the encounter complex and were compared with the bound state to get a better undertanding of the molecular mechanism for ligand binding.

Catalytic promiscuity is defined as the ability of an enzyme to catalyse chemically distinct reactions besides its native activity. This latent promiscuity is considered to play an important role in enzyme evolution by providing possible evolutionary starting points for the emergence of new functions (Jensen, R. A., 1976) . The Alkaline Phosphatase (AP) superfamily is a case in point; its members often display crosswise catalytic promiscuity, i.e. the native (or primary) activity of one family member corresponds to the promiscuous activity of another (O'Brien, P. J. and Herschlag, D., 2001). This view has been significantly expanded with the characterization of Pseudomonas aeruginosa arylsulfatase (PAS) and Rhizobium leguminosarum phosphonate monoester hydrolase (RlPMH), two members of the AP superfamily (van Loo, B., et al., 2008) . These studies raise the following question: which are the mechanistic and structural features responsible for the evolution of specificity among AP superfamily members? To address this issue, we performed directed evolution to convert a sulfatase (PAS) into a phosphonate monoester hydrolase (PMH). Three rounds of neutral drift, followed by six rounds of selection for improved promiscuous activity resulted in 110 000-fold increase of PMH activity (k cat /K M = 1.6x10 3 M -1 s -1 ) whereas the native sulfatase activity only decreased by 400-fold (k cat /K M = 5.9x10 4 M -1 s -1 ). Moreover the promiscuous hydrolysis of phosphate diesters also improved by 16-fold (k cat /K M = 1.3x10 5 M -1 s -1 ); thus the evolved variant became a highly efficient promiscuous enzyme. Mutational analysis revealed the clustering of substitutions in loops that are originally absent in known PMH structures. Based on this lead, selections from semi-rationally designed loopdeletion libraries identified mutants tolerating up to 18 amino acids deletions and exhibiting altered specificity toward phosphonate monoesters. Structural and kinetic analysis of the evolutionary intermediates is providing insights into how these mutations triggered a switch in catalytic efficiency and specificity. Our results underline the versatility of promiscuous enzymes and their ability to quickly evolve a new activity via distinct mutational paths, including substitutions, insertions and deletions.

            "text": "Biochemistry, Brandeis University, Waltham, MA The substrate specificity of enzymes has been optimized through evolution over millions of years. Insights into this process can be used to inform the rational redesign of enzymes over a much smaller time scale. We are identifying the changes responsible for the switch in substrate specificity between the enzymes lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and malate dehydrogenase (MDH). LDH and MDH are homologous enzymes that share the same fold, but possess strict specificity for their respective substrates, pyruvate for LDH and oxaloacetate for MDH. LDH has evolved from MDH four separate times in their evolutionary history. One example is the evolution of Apicomplexan LDHs via a lateral gene transfer of a bacterial MDH. The most obvious difference between modern Apicomplexan MDHs and LDHs is a six amino acid insertion within the catalytic loop of LDHs. However, incorporating this insertion into a modern Apicomplexan MDH does not switch specificity and reduces oxaloacetate specificity only 70-fold. Using ancestral sequence reconstruction, we have identified the critical residues responsible for the evolution of pyruvate specificity in Apicomplexan LDHs from the ancestral MDH transferred from bacteria. The specificity switch is correlated with the six amino acid insertion in the catalytic loop as well as a mutation from Arg to Lys at position 102. In the ancestral MDH background, the six amino acid insertion is responsible for a 500-fold increase in pyruvate specificity with no loss in oxaloacetate specificity. Subsequently mutating the Arg at position 102 to Lys accounts for an additional 10-fold specificity increase toward pyruvate while reducing oxaloacetate specificity 630-fold. Pyruvate specificity of the doubly mutated ancestral MDH is only 10-fold less than the modern Apicomplexan LDH from P.falciparum LDH. The inability to switch specificity in the modern Apicomplexan MDH and the incomplete specificity switch of the mutated ancestor suggests that one or more additional, less obvious mutations are responsible for the complete switch in substrate specificity. Research Supported by NIH R01GM096053. Understanding the basis of enzymatic substrate specificity is a central problem in protein biochemistry. During the evolutionary history of the lactate and malate dehydrogenase (L/MDH) superfamily, substrate specificity has switched from malate to lactate four independent times, each time by a distinct mechanism. Hence the L/MDH enzymes are an ideal model system for exploring the biophysical basis of both substrate specificity and convergent evolution at the molecular level. In the trichomonads, an order of amitochondriate protists, an unusual LDH evolved from an MDH via a relatively recent gene duplication. The MDH in Trichomonas vaginalis has high malate activity and little lactate activity, while the LDH has both malate and lactate activity. In the L/MDH superfamily, residue 102 is generally accepted as a major contributor to substrate specificity. In MDHs, position 102 is an arginine, whereas in canonical LDHs it is a glutamine. It has been shown previously that the Q102R mutation in Bacillus stearothermophilus LDH converts the enzyme to a highly specific MDH. The Trichomonas LDH has a leucine at the 102 position, suggesting that it may similarly be responsible for the switch in substrate specificity. However, we have shown that mutation of the 102 residue in the Trichomonas proteins has relatively little effect. To further investigate what is responsible for the mechanistic basis of substrate specificity in Trichomonas enzymes, as well as how the divergence came about, we have reconstructed three ancestral proteins: the last common ancestor (LCA) of trichomonad LDHs, the LCA of trichomonad MDHs, and the LCA of the MDH and LDH proteins. Unlike the modern enzymes, mutation of residue 102 causes large changes in activity in the ancestral constructs. In addition, we have solved the crystal structure of the modern-day Trichomonas LDH. Comparison of this structure with other LDHs and MDHs and mapping of evolutionary changes onto it reveals other regions of the protein possibly responsible for substrate specificity. Domains are the structural building blocks of proteins capable of autonomous folding. Their modular recombination gives rise to proteins with different functions. We identified an archaeal protein family, which contains a \u03b2-clam domain in context not of a AAA protein but of a C-terminal domain that has no significant sequence similarity to known domains. Here, we present the biochemical and crystallographic characterization of open reading frame number 1500 from Pyrococcus horikoshii, revealing that the C-domain forms a homohexameric twelve-bladed \u03b2-propeller, which we therefore name HP12 (homohexameric propeller with 12 blades). The structural similarity of the blades of HP12 to the superfamily of WD40-repeat propellers (RMSD < 1.8 \u00c5 over 70 residues), and structure-based sequence alignments substantiate a homologous relationship to \u03b2-propellers. Additionally, the two blades of a monomer have retained traces of an ancient duplication event, suggesting that fully amplified monomeric \u03b2-propellers evolved via oligomeric intermediates encoded by single-bladed ancestors. This supports our scenario that folded domains themselves arose by repetition and recombination of a set of ancestral peptides, one of which is the four-stranded \u03b2-meander corresponding to a propeller blade. Furthermore, we show that HP12 forms a ternary complex with a translationally coupled type III endonuclease and DNA implying a function in base excision repair. Because HP12 resembles DNA sliding clamps in pore size, charge distribution, and symmetry, we propose that HP12 is a PCNA analog. The ability of HP12 to encircle DNA provides a functional reason for the evolution of this oligomeric propeller with the, to our knowledge, largest number of blades and size of the central pore among all \u03b2-propellers characterized so far.

However, it doesn't perform well for large molecules such as proteins since the search space expands exponentially with the increase of the number of atoms. In order to solve this problem, Slice Chain Max-Sum (SCMS) algorithm has been proposed. It represents a potential function by a factor graph, and combines MCMC sampling and optimal sample sequence selection by the max-sum algorithm. Although it has been shown that SCMS is more efficient than MCMC, a limitation is that it only considers inner-molecular forces. Another limitation is that it has a difficulty in finding the lowest potential energy state requiring very long time before escaping from local minima using a proposal distribution with a very small variance for the sampling process. In this work, we develop SCMS2.0 by incorporating van der Waals forces to SCMS and improving the sampling process by introducing a quasi-Newton method. Experimental results show that SCMS2.0 is more efficient than the MCMC and the conventional SCMS methods for large molecules. Right handed supersecondary structures are the dominant form in alpha helical and alpha/beta proteins. The predominance of right-handed beta-alpha-beta units over left-handed was originally explained in terms of thermodynamic and kinetic stability. Previously our lab proposed an alternative mechanism to explain this phenomenon (Cole & Bystroff, 2009 ). Our model, the phone cord effect can be observed whenever beta sheet contacts are made before the crossover helix is fully formed, and if the backbone angles of the forming helix follow the most favorable energetic path. Whenever this occurs, a torque is generated on the ends of the helix by its folding. We propose that this torque is responsible for stabilizing the right handed crossovers while destabilizing left handed crossovers. The formation of right handed supersecondary structures relieves some of the torsional stress; this mechanism also provides an explanation for the folding mechanism of knotted proteins. Here we use simplified molecular simulations with a structure-based G\u00f5 potential to probe the torsional stress generated by the folding of a helix in a linear chain, in a circular chain with a pivot, and in a circular chain with no pivot. The simulated folding rates were compared with measured folding rates determined using NMR line-shape analysis of 15N labeled peptides derived from the ribosomal protein L9 (Kuhlman et al, 1997) . The constructs contain a strong helixforming sequence, and 0, 1 and 2 disulfide bonds at the ends of the chain. Knotted proteins are presented as a topological manifestation of the phone cord effect. In G\u00f5 simulations using a knotted protein as the template, we showed that an increased stiffness of the polypeptide chain leads to an increased likelihood of successful knot formation if the knot forming step is late in the folding pathway and passes through a slip-knot intermediate.",

Amide hydrogen/ deuterium (H/ 2 H) exchange mass spectrometry has been successfully applied for understanding local structural properties of protein, changes in solvent accessibility upon folding and to study protein-protein interactions. We used this method to follow cold denaturation of Pfk-2 in deuterated water after various times of incubation at 4\u00b0 C by measuring deuteron incorporation by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry of 8 different regions of Pfk-2 (representing both the interface and representative regions of the structure) produced after pepsin digestion. Samples taken between 0-12 hours after exposure to low temperature show similar increases in exchange across all of the regions but lower than the maximum exchange expected for unfolded proteins, thus describing a globally expanded but not completely unfolded conformation. Fitting the maximum of deuterons incorporated for each peptide over time to an exponential function shows that the rate of unfolding for each peptide is similar, thus suggesting that coldinduced unfolding of Pfk-2 is a global process that leads to an increase in solvent accessibility and a consequent expansion of the protein. The rate of unfolding of Pfk-2 monitored by H/D exchange is, on average, 1.3x10 -4 \u00b1 0.3x10 -4 s -1 . A similar rate was obtained by monitoring intrinsic fluorescence changes during cold denaturation. These results suggest that cold denaturation of Pfk-2 leads to a partially unfolded monomeric state reached by solvent penetration, where dimer dissociation and global unfolding occur simultaneously.

Energy-based refinement is mainly dependent on two components: (1) sufficiently accurate force fields, and (2) efficient conformational space search algorithms. Focusing on the latter, we developed a high-resolution Replica Exchange Monte Carlobased refinement algorithm called REMC-GRID. This method takes a three-dimensional protein structure as input and, employing an all-atom force field, attempts to improve the energy of the structure by randomly selecting residues and perturbing the backbone dihedral angles. GRID, another refinement algorithm that we had developed previously, similarly improves the energy of protein structures, but is deterministic and perturbs the backbone dihedrals and conformation of all the residues in a sequential fashion. We applied REMC-GRID and GRID to 10 high-resolution (\u2264 2.8 \u00c5) crystal structures from the Protein Data Bank and measured the energy improvements obtained and the computation times required to achieve them. REMC-GRID produced better energy improvements than GRID alone and was only moderately more expensive in the use of computational resources. In another set of experiments, we created decoy structures by randomly perturbing the backbone dihedrals, and then tested the ability of the two algorithms to return the structures back to the native conformation. REMC-GRID resulted in better recapitulation of the native conformation than GRID as measured by backbone RMSD. Unpaired cysteine residues in the hydrophobic core of proteins may impair their structure, dynamics, stability and function, and may present potential targets for selfassociation and undesired modifications. In therapeutic antibodies, the impact of incomplete disulfide bond formation raises concerns regarding efficacy and safety. Recently, an unformed disulfide bond between C22 and C96 was observed in 32% of the V H domain of Monoclonal Antibody A (MAb A). Alternatively, a variant of this domain containing V99G/V100S mutations (GS-MAb A) was found to fully form the disulfide bond. Standard biophysical methods have been applied to characterize the thermodynamic stability and kinetics of the folding of the MAb A and GS-MAb A V H domains. Both domains were found to fold via a threestate mechanism, consisting of a weakly cooperative native to intermediate transition (N\u2194I) and a highly cooperative intermediate to unfolded transition (I\u2194U). The high cooperativity of the I\u2194U transition is indicative of the burial of a large hydrophobic surface, which is reflected by the large change in free energy associated with this transition, roughly 7-10 kcal/mol. The high stability and cooperativity suggest the I\u2194U transition is the major step in the folding reaction of MAb A. The folding reaction of the U\u2192I step in wild-type MAb A reveals two kinetic phases, both of which extrapolate to submillisecond folding times in the absence of denaturant while the analogous folding reaction of the GS-MAb A variant is slowed by at least 3 orders of magnitude. These results support the hypothesis that rapid folding from the unfolded form of MAb A may bury C22 and C96, preventing their oxidation by the disulfide redox machinery of the ER. Understanding the relationship between sequence, folding and disulfide bond formation in IgG domains could provide valuable insights for rational antibody design in pharmaceutical drug development. Alpha helices are one of the basic units of protein secondary structure, and the interaction between two helices is therefore crucial to understanding tertiary and higher-order folds. Structural and sequence motifs can help by precisely describing a specific type of helixhelix interaction and highlighting the crucial residues. Moreover, comparing subtle variations in these motifs between soluble and membrane proteins can shed light on the different constraints faced in each environment and elucidate the as-yet unsolved puzzle of membrane protein folding. To find recurring sequence-structure motifs, we constructed a helix-pair library from highquality non-redundant X-ray structures. Here we present about a dozen of sequence-structure motifs in various orientations and handedness, including soluble coiled-coil motifs and transmembrane small-residue motifs (GxxxG and GxxxxxxG) and non-small-residue ones. By studying the distributions of interhelical distance and crossing-angle, the geometries of soluble and membrane helix-helix interactions are compared. Besides conventional left-handed soluble coiled-coil motifs, right-handed ones in different sequence repeats are discovered. The influence of sequence context on the packing geometry of transmembrane small-residue motifs is investigated. Interaction between critical residues in non-small residue motifs are also marked. Transmebrane small-residue motifs show structural and sequence analogy to some soluble coiled-coil ones. Such characterization of the motifs will greatly improve our understanding of the sequence-structure-function relationship in helical proteins. They also provide structural basis for molecular modeling and rational templates for protein design. \u039498\u0394 and \u039478\u0394 are two functional all-\u03b2 sheet variants of IFABP (intestinal fatty acid binding protein) that were generated by controlled proteolysis.

Albeit displaying increased conformational plasticity, these variants exhibit a native-like \u03b2-barrel topology and are able to support a cooperative folding behavior. Remarkably, although full length IFABP and \u039498\u0394 are monomers in solution (1,2), \u039478\u0394 adopts a stable dimeric structure (3) . Despite the fact that naturally occurring \u03b2-sheet proteins avoid edge-to-edge aggregation, the addition of the structure-promoting co-solvent 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol (TFE) can induce conformational changes that might trigger the onset of aggregation. With the aim of identifying the structural features involved in promoting or delaying aggregation, we compare here the effects of TFE on the structure and the propensity to aggregate of IFABP, \u039498\u0394 and \u039478\u0394. In all cases, turbidity measurements at 350 nm revealed a maximum value at around 25% v/v. Furthermore, Congo Red and Thioflavin-T binding to the aggregates suggest an amyloid-like character, a fact consistent with data from transmission electron microscopy (TEM) that do not exclude their fibrillar morphology. In addition, substantial effects of TFE at various concentrations on the overall protein conformation were assessed by fluorescence and circular dichroism spectroscopies. The constructs share a common nucleation-elongation mechanism, whereby the population of stable dimeric nuclei occurs prior to the association of protein to the growing aggregates. Unexpectedly, the intrinsic conformational stability of IFABP and its truncated forms do not correlate with their tendency to aggregate. These findings appear at odds with the established notion that a perturbation of the native compact fold should necessarily favor the population of aggregationprone species.

            "text": "Biochemistry & Microbiology, Rutgers University, New Brunswick, NJ It has been known for some time that many and possibly all proteins can adopt an amyloid structure under appropriate solution conditions. It has been argued that the cross-beta structure characteristic of amyloid is the default for polypeptides, the native structure having been engineered by Nature to be marginally more stable under native conditions. Protein misfolding diseases arise when conformational excursions from the native form lead to amyloid type aggregation, Alzheimer's and Creutzfeld-Jacob Diseases being prominent examples. The transition to the amyloid conformation must entail dramatic changes in the interactions of the protein with solvent water. The expulsion of water of hydration from biomolecular surfaces when these surfaces come together usually leads to a volume increase. To probe these interactions and the role of water of hydration we have used capillary dilatometry to measure the change in volume of \u03b2-lactoglobulin when unpolymerized protein is mixed with pre-formed \u03b2-lactoglobulin amyloid seeds. The result is a large immediate decrease in volume followed by a very slow further decrease which is not complete after 18 hours. The \u0394V of the fast phase, which is over in ~5 minutes, is -100 mL/ mol of protein polymerized. For amyloid to form, the protein must unfold, which causes a decrease in volume, following which the aggregation would be expected to yield a volume increase. The observed \u0394V is the net result. The result is counterintuitive, as the high stability of the amyloid aggregate suggests tight packing and thus large interprotein surface contacts, which were expected to dominate the behavior. It is possible that considerable hydration remains. It is also possible that solvent contact of many peptide bonds through their \u03c0 electrons affects the water differently from other average types of protein surface.

Hydrogen Exchange Mass Spectrometry (HXMS) has great potential as an approach to explore native protein folding landscapes without unfolding the protein that requires a minimal amount of protein. This technique capitalizes on the ability of amide hydrogen atoms of proteins to undergo exchange with those in the surrounding solvent with a certain intrinsic rate constant (kint). Parameters that encode a protein landscape can easily be extracted from HX in two limiting regimes. When the folding rate constant (kf) is much less than kint (EX1), HX reports on the unfolding rate constant ku, while when kf is much greater than kint (EX2), HX reveals the unfolding equilibrium constant (ku/kf). However, for many proteins, accessing either regime requires significant perturbation of their landscape through changing pH, temperature and/or adding denaturant. Decoding protein folding landscapes in the regime intermediate between EX1 and EX2, known as EXX, is therefore critical for applying HXMS to native proteins under physiological conditions. Here we present numerical simulations modeling HXMS for a group of biophysically characterized proteins that provide the foundation for decoding landscapes undergoing EXX exchange. The ability to extract landscape parameters from HXMS regardless of regime will help us extend its potential to study proteins whose landscapes are not accessible by traditional techniques. Institute of Nanotechnology, KIT, Karlsruhe, Germany Evolution has selected a protein's sequence to be consistent with the native state geometry, as this configuration must be both thermodynamically stable and kinetically accessible to prevent misfolding and loss of function. In simple protein geometries, such as coiled-coil helical bundles, symmetry produces a competing, globally-different, near mirror image with identical secondary structure and similar native contact interactions. Experimental techniques like circular dichroism, which rely on probing secondary structure content, cannot readily distinguish these folds. Here, we want to clarify whether the native fold and mirror image are energetically competitive by investigating the free energy landscape of three-helix bundles. This study [1] employs the structure prediction forcefield PFF01/02, explicit solvent replica exchange molecular dynamics (REMD) with the Amber94 forcefield, and structurebased simulations (http://smog.ucsd.edu) based on energy landscape theory. We observe that the native fold and its mirror image have the similar enthalpic stability and are thermodynamically competitive. There is evidence that the mirror fold has faster folding kinetics and could function as a kinetic trap. All together, our simulations suggest that mirror images might not just be a computational annoyance but are competing folds which might switch depending on environmental conditions or functional considerations. [ Monoclonal antibody (MAb) IgG1 is composed of 12 classic \u03b2-sandwich immunoglobulin domains. Each domain has a highly conserved intra-chain disulfide bond, suggesting an important role of this disulfide in antibody structure and stability. We have observed IgG1 variants containing at least one unformed intra-chain disulfide bond in a few therapeutic MAbs, i.e. the cysteines (Cys) remain as free thiols. These variants often elute as distinct peaks in reversed-phased chromatography. The presence of unpaired Cys in the hydrophobic core of a therapeutic MAb raises potential concerns regarding MAb drug safety and efficacy due to 1) potential altered structure, 2) change in dynamics, 3) loss of stability, and 4) consequently impaired function. We have used MAb A as a model system to investigate the consequences of unpaired Cys in antibody. About 32% of MAb A molecules contain an unformed disulfide bond in the V H domain. This MAb A variant was first observed by reversed-phase chromatography and later confirmed by mass spectrometry and peptide map analyses. With an ion-exchange chromatography method, we have separated the Fab fragment of the MAb A variant containing unpaired Cys from its intact form with the disulfide linkage. The isolation of free thiol containing Fab from MAb A enabled the characterization of its crystal structure, dynamics and antigen-binding activity. We have also explored the possible causes of unpaired Cys in antibodies by comparing MAb A to two other MAbs, MAb B and MAb C. Approximately 54% of MAb B molecules contain the same unformed disulfide bond in the V H domain as found in MAb A. By contrast, no significant amount of unpaired Cys was found in the V H domain of MAb C. A series of mutations introduced into the heavy chain CDR III region revealed that a few key residues in this region are critically linked to the amount of variants containing unpaired Cys in these three MAbs. We hypothesize that the unformed intrachain disulfide bond in MAb A is caused by a sequence dependent fast protein folding process that traps Cys residues in the reduced form during protein synthesis. In order to test this hypothesis, thermodynamic and kinetic folding properties of the MAb A V H domain and its mutants were studied by standard biophysical methods (see a separate poster by Cohen et al.) . Understanding the causes for unformed disulfide bonds in IgGs could provide valuable insights for rational MAb design in pharmaceutical drug development. Bacterial division is initiated by the formation of the Z-ring and the later sequential addition of around 12 other proteins. FtsZ is the unit of this ring that polymerizes into single filaments. On one hand, a dimer has been proposed to be the nucleus of this polymerization and on the other hand the unfolding pathway showed the presence of an intermediate. To explain these processes we investigated the influence of the self-assembly of FtsZ on its unfolding pathway characterizing its oligomerization and unfolding thermodynamics. The assembly was studied using size-exclusion chromatography and fluorescence spectroscopy and the unfolding using circular dichroism and two-photon fluorescence correlation spectroscopy. The presence of monomers, dimers and tetramers with populations dependent on protein concentration were found by chromatographic analysis. Dissociation constants in the micromolar range for these oligomerizations were found by dilution experiments using fluorescent conjugates. The presence of tetramers at high protein concentrations and monomers at low protein concentrations were confirmed measuring the fluorescence lifetimes and rotational correlation times of the conjugates. We found that the 3-states unfolding of FtsZ was due to the presence of mainly dimeric state and that the monomer unfolds through a 2-states mechanism. The monomer-to-dimer equilibrium characterized here (Kd = 9 \u03bcM) showed a significant fraction (~10%) of stable dimers at the critical concentration for polymerization, supporting a mechanism with a dimer as a nucleus for Periplasmic binding proteins (PBPs) are involved in the transport of several molecules inside the cytoplasm of gram negative bacteria and share a common structure, constituted by two \u03b1/\u03b2 domains. Thermodynamic studies on the folding of PBPs show that the histidine binding protein (HisJ) follows a three-state process, while the maltose binding protein (MBP) folds in a two-state way. Thus, PBPs with the same topology can show different folding behavior. In order to explore the structural determinants of such differences, we studied the folding process of the lysine, arginine, ornitine, binding protein (LAO) which shares 70% identity with HisJ. The temperature-induced unfolding of LAO in the pH range from 8.0 to 9.5 showed reversible singlephase transitions followed by fluorescence intensity (FI) and circular dichroism (CD). The CD and FI curves were always coincident. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) endotherms were well fitted to a two state model, the ratio \u0394Hcal / \u0394HVh was approximately 1.0. The \u0394Cp obtained from the \u0394H vs Tm plot was 2.4 \u00b1 0.3 Kcal mol-1. The urea-induced unfolding of LAO, followed by FI and near and far UV CD, showed singlephase coincident transitions. A global fit gave \u0394GH2O = 11.3 \u00b1 0.7 Kcal mol-1, m= 3.7 \u00b1 0. For stable globular proteins, the folded and functional state predominates in solution, and the mechanism of action can be approached through study of this state alone. But in other cases, the active configuration may be an infrequently visited member of a conformational ensemble. In such cases the activity mediated by this state is influenced by competition with these other states, and so understanding the distribution of states in the conformational ensemble is necessary to understand the molecule's functional properties. An example of such a protein is the nucleocapsid-binding domain from the mumps virus polymerase. This molecule displays persistent alpha-helical secondary structure in solution but lacks tertiary structure. Nevertheless it can be induced to fold into a three-helix bundle which is structurally very similar to homologs from other viruses. In this work we applied a statistical mechanical model based on helix-coil theory to describe the conformational ensemble of this small helical protein.",

The magnitude of the effect was found to be comparable to solvent transfer energies for the larger hydrophobic sidechains. Spectrin \u03b1II is a major cytoskeletal protein contributing to membrane organization and integrity. Controlled spectrin proteolysis has been detected during both apoptotic and necrotic cell death processes, upon cell shape change, during cell differentiation, during lens development in synaptic remodeling, and in dendrite outgrowth, for example. A better understanding of mechanisms that control these processes is required to differentiate these proteolysis events and for developing inhibitors with potential therapeutic value. Spectrin \u03b1II contains two sites sensitive to caspase-3 processing. To characterize caspase-3 cleavage sites kinetically and structurally, we have expressed and purified spectrin model proteins of different lengths with either a single site or both sites. In vitro cleavage assay results showed catalytic efficiency of the first site to be 20 times higher than that of the second site in two sites model proteins. Interestingly, the proteins with just the first site exhibits similar increased cleavage than those consisting of just the second site. Furthermore, introducing a mutation at the first site at P1 position reduced the efficiency by 100 fold, but does not affect the processing of the second site. Our results clearly show that these two sites are very different in caspase-3 proteolysis and are independent of each other. To provide a better understanding of the determinants governing different rates of spectrin proteolysis at the two sites, we have solved the crystal structure of a spectrin fragment containing the second caspase-3 cleavage site. Structural studies of proteins consisting of the first site are in progress. Accurately predicting the relationship between protein sequence and structural stability is a significant challenge. We have analyzed this complicated relationship using high-throughput approaches to gain more detailed insight into hypotheses of protein design.

            "text": "Using an in vivo screen for functional variants of Rop that uses green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression as a reporter phenotype, we are able to screen large libraries for folded variants. These functional variants have been sequenced via high-throughput colony sequencing technology to accumulate a statistically significant dataset of unique Rop variants differing in the core and loop regions. To further gain insight into the thermodynamic consequences of such mutations on stability, we have developed a high-throughput thermal scanning (HTTS) assay binding to assess the quantitative thermal stabilities of the variants in 96-well plates. HTTS relies on a fluorescence-based thermal shift assay that utilizes an environmentally sensitive dye. Active variants from combinatorial loop libraries reveal small differences in stability with large diversity in sequence space while an additional residue in the tight loop enhances stability by potential electrostatic interaction. Folded variants from repacking the hydrophobic core reveal that the most stable variants bury volumes similar to the wild-type, but a very broad range of core volumes can result in stability, as can mutations that substantially differ from the canonical pattern of large and small amino acids. Together these results illuminate how limiting \"oil droplet\" and \"jigsaw puzzle\" models of stability are both needed to fully understand stability. CaBLAM (Calpha-Based Low-resolution Annotation Method) addresses the challenge of producing stereochemically accurate models from rough chain tracings at low resolution (3-4\u00c5) . Much current excitement in crystallography centers on large complexes and \"molecular machines\", but the resulting models can be subject to artifacts arising from inherent properties of low-resolution electron density maps. Even at poor resolution, chain tracing can produce full backbone models, achieving the primary objective of locating the amino-acid residues in 3D space. However, structural details like peptide orientation and hydrogen bonding are very often distorted. This wreaks havoc with standard ways of identifying secondary structure, placing side chains, and refining a reasonable model. CaBLAM identifies \"disguised\" secondary structures from a novel parameter space of overlapping C\u03b1 pseudodihedrals, and then uses the less reliable carbonyl oxygen placement to diagnose commonly occurring patterns of correctable errors. At high resolution, when combined with H-bonding patterns, CaBLAM is a powerful tool for exploring and describing structural motifs. At low resolution, CaBLAM can identify secondary structure from a minimum of information. CaBLAM diagnoses incorrect peptide plane orientations, and distinguishes such modeling errors from real irregularities such as helix caps, widened turns, and beta bulges. These methods allow better secondary structure modeling and more effective refinement. Funding: NIH R01-GM088674 Fluorescent proteins (FPs) have, over the last two decades, revolutionized the way biology and biochemistry are studied. However, the obligate oligomerization of many naturally occurring fluorescent proteins has hampered their usefulness as biological markers. Oligomerization of a fusion tag can impair the accuracy of characterizing a target protein, artificially aggregating its target, altering diffusion rates, and causing problems in target transport and trafficking. A monomeric fluorescent protein avoids these problems. In this vein, DsRed, a well-studied red fluorescent protein (RFP), was successfully engineered through directed evolution into monomeric mCherry by Roger Tsien and coworkers. This was the first instance of a monomeric RFP and filled a void in the color spectrum for monomeric molecular labels. DsRed is only one of hundreds of naturally occurring fluorescent proteins, many diverging significantly in fluorescent properties such as absorbance and emission spectra or quantum yields. Repeating the directed evolution process in other proteins would be a long and laborious endeavor, and therefore, a new method is desired for engineering monomerization into fluorescent proteins. We have devised a process through which we can engineer RFP monomers in silica via computational protein design (CPD) of surface positions at the oligomerization interfaces. To validate the method, we first engineered DsRed that had been modified to include mutations made to the core of the protein during its directed evolution to mCherry. CPD predicted sequence variants from which a 96-member library was constructed; a 24-member randomly generated library was also used as a control. The random library allowed hydrophilic residues, but weighted them based on their frequency of occurrence on the surface of bacterial cytoplasmic proteins. The design library maintained fluorescence in 96.8% of cases, whereas only 9.1% of the random library did so. These results demonstrate the power of our design method. The designed proteins were confirmed to be monomeric by gel filtration, homo-FRET, and analytical ultracentrifugation. As expected from the mutations to the core of the protein, the mutants maintained the spectroscopic properties of mCherry and not of DsRed. We hope to repeat these results in other fluorescent proteins that have yet to be monomerized such as HcRed and AQ143, which are both significantly red-shifted from DsRed.",

Inhibition of IRAP by both peptides and selective small molecular weight inhibitors has been shown to dramatically improve memory in both normal animals, and in animal models of memory loss. When expressing recombinant IRAP using the baculovirus system, we observed that IRAP contained 2 zinc molecules per mole of IRAP. This was interesting as only one characteristic zinc binding site had been reported previously. Utilisation of a range of protein fragments revealed one binding site was consistent with the active site zinc, while the other was located in a C-terminal domain. Generation of molecular models of IRAP, and virtual screening for zinc binding sites using the Stanford Feature metal scanning algorithm confirmed our preliminary results, predicting not only the catalytic zinc binding site, but also two potential C-terminal binding sites; one coordinated by a group of three histidines and the other via two cysteines. Characterisation of the zinc binding properties revealed the approximate pKa of both zinc binding sites was around the approximate pKa of histidine residues. Subsequent mutation of all histidine residues to alanine confirmed zinc binding to the previously characterised HEXXH motif near the N-terminus, and to a cluster of three histidine residues near the C-terminus. Interestingly, in the presence of peptide inhibitors this second zinc is lost and a dramatic increase in resistance to proteolysis was seen. This was further characterised and modelled to show that these changes were a result of a large conformational change within the C-terminal domain upon binding of inhibitors to the catalytic N-terminal domain, and that this acts as an important regulator of IRAP activity. Using this knowledge, we have identified several novel selective small molecule inhibitors of IRAP which are being explored as potential new treatments for dementia. Endoplasmic reticulum aminopeptidase 1 and 2 (ERAP1 and ERAP2) are 120 kDa membrane-bound zinc M1 aminopeptidase's that play a central role in the final processing of MHC class I antigens. They are responsible for trimming precursors to antigenic peptides in the endoplasmic reticulum, which is essential to customise the longer peptides to the correct length for presentation on MHC class I molecules. Here we show that recombinantly purified ERAP1 and ERAP2, while monomeric in isolation, readily and specifically form a stable heterodimer through their N-terminal catalytic domains, with the active sites facing each other (face-toface) and the C-terminal domains acting as a molecular gate above the active sites. While the individual enzyme's substrate specificity is quite limited, the heterodimer shows broad substrate specificity and a cooperatively enhanced level of activity, particuarly against native substrates requiring multiple residues to be removed. The heterodimer also produced a greater proportion of fully processed products, and less of the intermediates, although this was dependent on the presence of the C-terminal domains which help retain the intermediate products within the dual active site environment, enabling more complete proteolysis. While the ERAP heterodimer is unique among the M1 aminopeptidases, it is an effective mechanism to efficiently and completely process a broad range of substrates to their appropriate lengths for antigen presentation.",

Michael Sabo, Karin Giller, Stefan Becker, Donghan Lee, Christian Griesinger NMR based Structural Biology, Max-Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry, Am Fa\u00dfberg 11, G\u00f6ttingen, 37077, Germany Molecular recognition is typically described as either following a conformational selection (CS) or inducedfit (IF) mechanism. In the CS model, a protein samples a subset of structural configurations which mimic structures from the bound form. An important facet of this is that the sampling of different conformations limits the on-rate for binding. In the IF model, a free conformation is altered to a bound conformation induced upon binding and the on-rate is governed by the rate of this conformational change. For ubiquitin, a protein that forms many different interactions with various proteins, large heterogeneous conformations are sampled in the free form on a timescale of about 2-38 \u03bcs at room temperature (1, 2) . Here, we evaluate the role of this sampling event during the molecular recognition process using ubiquitin complexed with the UBA domain of Dsk2p (Dsk2) (3) by utilizing Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. For this purpose, concentration dependent CPMG relaxation dispersion, which is sensitive to lowly populated intermediates, has been used for evaluating the efficacy of CS and IF (4). In brief, data fit with a simple two-state model are in contradiction with HSQC-based titration results and indicate that the binding scheme is more sophisticated. Techniques on how to fit the data to higher order models and results from expanded kinetic schemes will be presented as well as a comparison of both CS and IF binding models for the ubiquitin and Dsk2 interaction. This approach can provide pivotal information regarding molecular recognition mechanisms. The localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) peak of SoPRano nanorods in solution can be used to monitor protein-protein interactions in real-time. One protein is immobilized onto the gold nanorod surface through standard amine coupling methods. Complex formation with a protein-binding partner causes a red shift in the absorbance spectra which can be monitored using a standard spectrophotometer. A glycerol concentration series was used to establish that the change in response is linear with respect to the change in refractive index. Equilibrium and kinetic studies on antibody fragments binding to immobilized antigens demonstrate the potential of the technology to characterize the binding constants for protein-protein interactions. Absorbance based plate readers can be used to multiplex the assay in 96-and 384-well formats making it possible to run highly parallel assays. The nanorod technology can open up new applications for label-free SPR analysis.",

            "text": "Interacting networks of proteins carry out the majority of biological functions. Thesefunctionally-linked interactions (FLIPs) occur at specific interfaces. Many such contacts are identified via X-ray crystallography; however the majority of contacts in such structures are crystal contacts, sites of aggregation, or otherwise functionally un-correlated (FunCs). Here, we use our Energy Centrality Relationship (ECR) concept, which assesses amino acid energetic variation as a function of distance from the interface, to characterize and classify different categories of protein aggregations and associations. We hypothesize that in order to maintain FLIPs, evolutionary pressure produces signature characteristics that can be identified by computational alanine scanning and Evolutionary Trace methods. Here we show that geometric, energetic, and sequence conservation patterns, when clustered, can differentiate between proteins belonging to differentFLIP/FunC categories. In addition, by generating and testing docking decoys for structures representative of these categories, we demonstrate that ECR can reduce false positives in quaternary structure prediction. In the past years there was an increasing interest in the study of tertiary components of the allosteric transitions and their coupling to the quaternary MWC classic T-R conformational change. The enzyme glucosamine-6-P deaminase from E. coli (GlcN6P deaminase, E.C. 3.5.99.6) has shown to be a useful experimental model to approach this topic. It is a homohexameric allosteric enzyme, activated by N-acetylglucosamine-6-P (GlcNAc6P), catalyzing the conversion of GlcN6P into Fru6P and ammonia. Its cooperative kinetics and allosteric activation by GlcNAc6P can be accounted for the allosteric MWC model, but spectral and crystallographic evidences suggests the existence of local conformational changes. With the aim of investigating the tertiary-quaternary coupling in this deaminase, we encapsulated it in wet silica sol-gels under conditions that constrains the T-R conformerization and abolishes the cooperative binding of ligands. For experiments, gels were used as monolithic slabs or particles in suspension. Spectral studies and kinetic experiments show that the allosteric activation of the nanoencapsulated enzyme is independent of the allosteric transition and linked to local non-concerted structural changes. The kinetic study of nanoencapsulated ligand-free T and R forms of the enzyme and its activation by GlcNAc6P reveals the existence of pure tertiary states at high or low affinity for GlcN6P, whilst the intermediate forms of the enzyme display negative cooperativity, thus suggesting the existence of tertiary structural heterogeneity. It is also apparent that the time-course of the enrichment in the high-affinity tertiary state (r) is dependent on the enzyme quaternary state. Our results are consistent with the existence of at least two tertiary states with different apparent K M GlcN6P values for each t or r state, which are independent of the quaternary T-R state. On the other hand, GlcNAc6P can be bound with similar affinity to the allosteric site in either quaternary state of the enzyme. These results are analyzed in the framework of the TTS model by Henry and Eaton (Biophys Chem 2002:98, 149-164) , a model is proposed for GlcNAc6P binding in T and R states and also on the origin of cooperativity for the free enzyme.

Structural and sequence comparisons show that S100 proteins have similar patterns of hydrophobic residues on their binding surfaces and selectivity and specificity is conferred in part by differences in side chain interactions. In general, detailed structures have shown how some S100 proteins interact with a target. However much less is known about the forces driving these biomolecular associations in solution. To gain insights into to the specificity and energetic contributions that stabilize S100-target complex formation, the thermodynamics of several S100 proteins with peptides derived from their target molecules were studied using isothermal titration calorimetry. We compared representative S100-target complex formation to evaluate the thermodynamics of same target protein (annexin A2) interacting with multiple S100s (Ca-S100A11 and S100A10) and binding of a single S100 member to different target molecules (Ca-S100B with CapZ and dopamine receptor; CaS100A11 with annexins A1 and A2, and S100A10 with annexin A2 and virus protein NS3). Energetics of Ca-S100A11annexin A1 and S100A10-annexin A2 interactions exhibited similar characteristics in agreement with the structural resemblance reported for these complexes. On the contrary, binding of annexin A2 to Ca-S100A11 and S100A10 were significantly different with entropic contributions favoring the interaction of annexin A2 with Ca-S100A11, while the S100A10 interaction proceeds as a result of important enthalpic contributions. Based on our analysis S100-target interactions can be divided into two groups according to the driving force for complex formation: those enthalpically driven (Ca-S100A11annexin A1; S100A10-annexin A2 and NS3) where there is a large entropy cost as a result of the induction of the \u03b1-helical structure of the peptides, and those entropically driven (Ca-S100B complexes and Ca-S100A11-annexin A2) where the burial of hydrophobic residues is the major driving force. These studies provide an energetic rationale towards understanding the specificity and redundancy among S100 members. In combination with structural data, this work may help in the design of S100 inhibitors that could regulate calcium signaling events. Staphylococcus aureus is a pathogenic bacteria that has acquired resistance to many modern antibiotics. Biotin protein ligase (BPL) is a ubiquitous enzyme that acts to covalently attach biotin onto biotindependent carboxylases required in fundamental life processes such as lipogenesis, gluconeogenesis and amino acid metabolism. Certain bacterial BPL also have a secondary role in transcriptional repression of the genes code for the protein involved in the synthesis of biotin. Due to BPL's importance in bacterial cell survival and maintenance, it has been proposed that the Staphylococcus aureus BPL (SaBPL) is a potential target for a novel antibiotic. Compounds targeting the active site of the catalytic domain have been specifically designed based on a previously determined structure of SaBPL in complex with the native ligand biotinyl-5'-AMP. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) was used in determining the binding activity of these inhibitors against SaBPL. X-ray crystallography structures of these potential inhibitors in complex with SaBPL have also been obtained, and provide an insight as to how the inhibitors bind SaBPL and is a starting point for the development of more efficient drugs against this enzyme.",

A-kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs) are scaffolding proteins which target cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) and other signaling enzymes to various substrates and organelles within the cell. AKAP79 plays important roles in signaling complexes in the heart and brain, and is an integral part of protein complexes linked to calcium channels and glutamate receptors, recruiting PKA and the phosphatase calcineurin (CN) to regulate Ca2+ influx. Well regulated Ca2+ currents are essential for proper neurotransmitter signaling and regulation of cardiac contractility; pathological alterations in Ca2+ handling can lead to neuronal hyperexcitability, seizures, cardiac arrhythmias, and heart failure. We hypothesize that AKAP79 does not simply target PKA and CN to receptors to regulate Ca2+ influx, but assembles these enzymes such that their signaling output is different from that of the unscaffolded enzymes. This hypothesis implies that PKA and CN interact upon the scaffold to mediate each other's activity, in turn raising the possibility that the AKAP79/CN/PKA complex forms a structure whose components interact dynamically, as opposed to a \"beads on a string\" model where there is a lack of significant interaction between the enzymes. As a first step towards full characterization of this potential signaling complex, we have studied the structure and interactions of recombinant, purified PKA holoenyzme, truncated CN, and AKAP79 using a variety of methods, among them peptide array overlays and small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), to analyze an AKAP79/CN/ PKA complex that is stable to gel filtration. Binding of the recombinant proteins to arrayed synthetic peptides revealed multiple candidate sites of interaction between CN and PKA, as well as a novel interaction of CN with peptides within the PKA binding site on AKAP79. SAXS studies of the AKAP79/CN/PKA complex showed a remarkably compact structure with a diameter not much larger than that of the PKA holoenzyme. Together, these data suggest a strong likelihood of on-scaffold interaction between PKA and CN, and a tight integration of cAMP and Ca2+ signals within the complex.

Histidinetagged proteins are captured on a sensor surface and the analyte binding characteristics can be explored. Capture of histidine-tagged proteins is an attractive approach for protein attachment in Biacore systems as physiological conditions can be used during the procedure. Another advantage is the possibility to perform the analysis in crude sample environments prior to purification. In addition, capture of tags ensures a directed structural orientation of the molecule on the surface giving an optimal site exposure. In this poster we present His Capture Kit, NTA Reagent Kit and NTA Sensor Chip, products that support the two different approaches for interaction studies of histidine-tagged proteins using Biacore systems.

We have developed several cell-free methods for producing soluble membrane proteins supported in nanolipoprotein particles (NLPs) that may potentially support free-electron laser technology (FEL) for the structural determination of membrane proteins. NLPs have shown great promise as a biotechnology platform for solubilizing and characterizing membrane proteins and may make many more membrane proteins accessible for biophysical and biochemical study. By the simple addition of a few constituents to cell-free extracts, this approach provides a rapid process for the production of functional soluble membrane proteins that eliminates the need for cell growth, cell lysis, and subsequent purification, refolding etc. We have demonstrated this process on multiple membrane proteins important for rhodopsin-related proton pumps, drug transporters, host-pathogen interactions, the herceptin receptors and G-coupled protein receptors. Proteins have ranged in size from 10 -200 kDa, with 2 or more transmembrane domains and have been shown to be biochemically functional. Crystallization of the proteins directly within the NLP appears to be generally applicable to membrane proteins associated with NLPs. Our approach represents a unique solution to the inherent challenge of generating soluble and functional polytopic membrane proteins, facilitating the structural and functional characterization of these critical, yet poorly understood molecules. Contact: coleman16@llnl.gov. ( Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDP's) are characterized by a lack of a stable tertiary structure under physiological conditions. The discovery of IDP's challenged the traditional protein structure theory that a well-defined structure is required for the correct function of a protein. It is now known that proteins in a globular state are fully functional and are essential for cellular processes. Some develop a stable tertiary structure when bound to their target. The tertiary structure of FlgM was determined when bound to Sigma-28. In this study, the four-helix protein FlgM, from the thermophilic organism Aquifex aeolicus was characterized. FlgM is an IDP that inhibits the RNA transcription factor Sigma-28, which is involved in the late stage genes of flagella synthesis. It has been previously shown that the C-terminus in FlgM from Salmonella typhimurium becomes ordered when bound to Sigma-28. In contrast, all four helices in FlgM from A. aeolicus become ordered when bound to Sigma-28. Although these proteins serve similar function, their primary structure is only 36% similar, and their structures upon binding are different. We examined peptides of the single helix regions (H1-H4) as well as combinations of the helices in FlgM using circular dichroism (CD) and fluorescence anisotropy. We found that as the percentage of TFE increased, so did the alpha-helical signal of each helix and as temperature increased the helices exhibit a less ordered state. H3 showed the strongest amount of alpha-helical content with and without TFE, suggesting that H3 is the initial binding site with Sigma-28. Fluorescence anisotropy is being used to probe the binding between various truncations of FlgM and Sigma-28. ",

About forty amyloidoses are known so far, amongst which Alzheimer's disease, type II diabetes and immunoglobulin amyloidosis [1] . Although the mechanism of amyloid fibril formation at the molecular level is not yet completely understood, it has been shown that the capacity to form amyloid fibrils in vitro is an intrinsic property of all polypeptide chains [1] . The choice of model proteins to investigate the aggregation process in vitro is therefore not restrained to proteins involved in amyloidoses but can be settled on a wide variety of proteins. We have chosen to investigate the mechanism of amyloid fibril formation using as model two variable domains of camelid heavy-chain antibodies (referred to as V H Hs or nanobodies), cAb-HuL6 and cAb-BcII10, for which variants with mutations located at the disulfide bond and the Complementary Determining Regions (CDRs) [2] are available. The purpose of this work is to study the impact of these structural elements on the aggregation process and thereby gain more insight into the molecular mechanism of amyloid fibril formation. In order to determine conditions in which cAb-HuL6, cAb-BcII10 and one of their mutational variant are more susceptible to form amyloid fibrils, heat-induced unfolding experiments at several pHs have been carried out. Then, aggregation experiments have been performed in the selected conditions and the presence of amyloid fibrils has been acknowledged due to thioflavin T fluorescence experiments and electron microscopy. Aggregation and seeding experiments supported the hypothesis that aggregation of these V H Hs into amyloid fibrils is a nucleation-dependant process. An interesting result is that, despite their close sequences, cAb-HuL6 and cAb-BcII10 have not been able to cross-seed. Based on cross-seeding experiments of cAb-HuL6, cAb-BcII10 and one of their mutational variant, we determined that the CDRs were having a key role in the fibrillation process of the V H Hs studied. This work has been supported by the F.R.I.A. [1] Chiti and Dobson, Annu. Rev. Biochem., 75, 2006, 333- A number of germline Ras mutations have been found in a series of developmental disorders collectively known as neuro-cardio-cutaneous conditions (NCFCs), including Cardio Facio Cutaneous Syndrome (CFCS: K-ras), Noonan Syndrome (NS: K-ras and N-ras) and Costello Syndrome (CS: K-ras and H-ras). NCFCs are characterized by a set of distinct phenotypes that include facial dysmorphism, cardiac anomalies, delayed growth and mild to severe mental retardation. Germline mutations have also been discovered in GEFs, GAPs, and Ras effector proteins involved in the Ras-MAPK cascade, suggesting that the mechanism of action that promotes aberrant development may be due to changes in the activation of this particular pathway. Furthermore, biochemical analyses have revealed that most of the NCFC-associated Ras mutations confer a lesser degree of over-activation than oncogenic Ras proteins and, in some cases, loss of function. We hypothesized that the mechanism by which NCFC Ras mutations alter MAPK activation, presumably by causing structural and dynamic changes, may be similar to those of oncogenic Ras mutations. To test this hypothesis, we characterized the conformational redistributions caused by NCFC mutations relative to the wild-type and oncogenic variants of Ras. We focused on the catalytic domain of a number of K-ras and H-ras proteins carrying NCFC as well as oncogenic point mutations, and used all-atom molecular dynamics simulations to study their dynamics in the presence of the cognate substrate GTP. Initial results revealed that several NCFC mutations alter the preference of Ras for the two major conformational states that differ in effector recognition. Further investigation into the various ensemble-of-conformers provided insights into how some mutations restructure the catalytic domain into a form that favors effector binding while others lead to conformations that disfavor effector binding. We also found structural clues into the biochemical effect of these mutations by correlating the pattern of conformational sampling with the severity of the syndrome caused by a given mutation. Blood coagulation factor VIII is a non-enzymatic glycoprotein cofactor that is essential for proper regulation of the blood coagulation cascade. Genetic deficiencies in factor VIII cause hemophilia A, which affects 1 in 5,000 males worldwide. Treatment for hemophilia A consists of repeated infusions of recombinant or plasma-derived factor VIII, which can result in the development of inhibitor antibodies that arise in approximately one-third of the hemophilia A patient population receiving therapy. The C-terminal \"C2\" domain of factor VIII is essential for proper interactions with von Willebrand factor (vWF) and the membrane surface of activated platelets, and is a major epitope that is recognized by inhibitory antibodies. Classical antibodies inhibit factor VIII in vitro by blocking the ability of the C2 domain to properly interact with both activated platelet surfaces and vWF, and non-classical antibodies inhibit the proteolytic activation of factor VIII by thrombin, thereby preventing its release from vWF in circulation. Here, we are characterizing the structural epitopes of a classical (3E6) and a non-classical (G99) pair of antibodies that bind to the C2 domain, which also function cooperatively in vitro, yielding a stable ternary complex. Purification of each binary C2/Fab complex, as well as the stable ternary complex, is completed, and we are currently attempting to produce crystals of each complex for x-ray crystallographic studies. Small angle x-ray scattering studies have previously been employed to allow low-resolution characterization of each complex. In this study, the C2/(Fab)2 ternary complex displays an extended structure, where each antibody binds to opposing sides of the C2 domain globular fold. These data allow for low-resolution modeling of specific epitopes for each class of antibodies, and further study to obtain x-ray crystal structures at atomic resolution will allow characterization of the mechanism of the immune response to factor VIII replacement therapy in hemophilia A patients.",

Individuals who are immunocompromised are especially susceptible to infections by this bacterium, such as cancer and AIDS patients. Additionally, P. aeruginosa is the principal bacterial agent responsible for persistent drug refractile lung infections, sepsis in burn patients, and morbidity and mortality among individuals suffering from cystic fibrosis. It is also a major nosocomial pathogen responsible for many hospital outbreaks and is notorious for its high resistance to antibiotic treatments. P. aeruginosa is known to establish a bacterial cell-to-cell communication named quorum sensing to resist host immune system, leading to full-fledged virulence. The enzyme PqsE is essential for the regulation of quorum sensing and the full virulence of this bacterial species. The enzyme regulates the synthesis of pyocyanin, a toxic compound only produced by P. aeruginosa. As a result, this enzyme is an important drug target showing considerable promise for the design of new inhibitors directed against this opportunistic human pathogen. Based on its structural investigation, we present preliminary enzyme characterization and mutagenesis experiments aimed at altering the biological function of PqsE, allowing the characterization of key amino acid positions involved in the molecular function of the enzyme. This functional mapping will be exploited for designing potential inhibitors through a computational method using a large set of small pharmaceutical compounds. The positive hits will be tested on the purified enzyme to evaluate their potency and to better characterize the role and molecular function played by PqsE in P. aeruginosa. This research should provide new insights and means to counter bacterial infections. (TG2) is an enzyme that exists in two dramatically different conformational states, each with a unique activity. In the open, extended form, the transglutaminase active site is exposed, allowing TG2 to catalyze formation of an isopeptide bond between the sidechain of a peptide-bound glutamine and a primary amine. Upon GTP binding to a separate GTPase active site, TG2 adopts a heavily favored and compact closed conformation, which obstructs the glutaminase active site, and only allows GTPase activity. TG2 has been linked to Huntington's disease, as well as to many other cellular processes, both physiological and pathological. However, TG2's two conformational states, each with its own activity, have made it difficult to elucidate how this enzyme functions in disease progression. In addition, because TG2 heavily prefers the closed state, attempts to screen for inhibitors that may bind the transglutanimase site exposed in the open conformation, and attempts to obtain co-crystals of the enzyme with these inhibitors have proven difficult. The purpose of this study is use computational protein design to engineer TG2 variants locked in either the open or closed conformation. Multistate and single-state design calculations were successful in predicting multiple active variants with 1-4 mutations that preferentially stabilized the open conformation. Closed-locked variants are beginning to be designed. These variants then will be used in Huntington's disease studies to isolate the effects of each of TG2's activities and to assist in rational drug design. Tank Binding Kinase (TBK1) plays a central role in innate immunity: it serves as an integrator of multiple signals induced by receptor-mediated pathogen detection and as a modulator of interferon levels. Efforts to better understand the biology of this key immunological factor have intensified recently as growing evidence implicates aberrant TBK1 activity in a variety of autoimmune diseases and cancers. Nevertheless, key molecular details of TBK1 regulation and substrate selection remain unanswered. Here structures of phosphorylated and unphosphorylated human TBK1 kinase and ubiquitin-like domains, combined with biochemical studies, indicate a molecular mechanism of activation via trans-autophosphorylation. These TBK1 structures are consistent with the tripartite architecture observed recently for the related kinase, IKK\u03b2, but domain contributions toward target recognition appear to differ for the two enzymes. In particular, both TBK1 autoactivation and substrate specificity are likely driven by signal-dependent co-localization events. Finally, insights gained from these inhibitor-bound TBK1 structures may aid the design of more selective TBK1 compounds, which would serve as important tools for further dissecting the intricacies of TBK1-mediated signaling events as well as potential therapeutics.",

            "text": "The transition of native proteins into amyloid fibrils is associated with many prevalent diseases. The investigation into the determinants of protein misfolding and amyloid fibril formation is an increasingly expanding and important field of research. The transformation of a functional folded protein into a fibril-like polymer composed of \u03b2-sheet structure is a fascinating transition. Proteins can be induced to alternatively fold into amyloid fibrils in vitro using a variety of factors such as mutations, concentration, agitation, temperature and pH. In this poster we present the identification of a specific set of conditions required to induce the transition of the all \u03b1-helical Fas-associated death domain, a nonamyloidogenic protein, into an amyloidlike morphology composed of a rich \u03b2-sheet structure. The transition to fibrils is monitored using a broad range of spectroscopic techniques which include atomic force microscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy and circular dichroism. In summary, we show that out of ninetyfive conditions attempted only one condition produced fibril-like structures which indicates, that proteins are robust against the amyloid conformation.",

            "text": "Defining the total amount of proteins in cell by mass spectrometry requires known amounts of internal standards. However, absolute quantification was hampered by the availability of standard labeled signature peptides in accurately known amounts. In this project, we designed peptide standards containing concatenated sequences of specific proteotypic peptides that are derived from various neuron disease related proteins. The concatenated peptides were generated in in vitro translation system. Isotopically labeled Lys and Arg were introduced to produce stable isotopelabeled peptides. A known amount of isotope-labeled peptides standards were co-digested with tissue samples containing target proteins. Absolute quantification of these neuron disease related proteins was performed by multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) with a triple quadrupole mass spectrometry. To date, a variety of anti-prion compounds have been reported that are effective in ex vivo and also in vivo treatment experiments. However the molecular mechanisms of most of these compounds remain unknown. Here we classified anti-prion mechanisms into four categories; I: conformational stabilization, II: interference with the interaction between the cellular form of prion protein (PrPC) and the scrapie form (PrPSc), III: precipitation of prion proteins, and IV: interaction with proteins other than PrPC. To characterize the anti-prion compounds according to this classification, we determined their binding affinities to PrPC and their binding sites in PrPC using the surface plasmon resonance and NMR spectroscopy, respectively. GN8 and GJP49 bind specifically to the hot spot in PrPC, and act as 'medicinal chaperones' to stabilize the native conformation and interfere with the interaction between PrPC and PrPSc. Thus mechanism I & II are predominant. While quinacrine and epigallocathechin bind to PrPC rather non-specifically. They may mainly interfere with the intermolecular interaction, and mechanism II may be applied. On the other hand Congo red and pentosan polysulfate bind to PrPC and cause its precipitation reducing the effective concentration of prion protein. So, mechanism III is appropriate. Finally CP60, an edarabone derivative etc. never bind to PrPC but may interact with PrPSc or other relevant proteins, and can be explained by mechanism IV, whose details must be elucidated further. The proposed characterization of diverse anti-prion compound would help understanding their anti-prion activities as well as facilitating further effective anti-prion drug discovery. HIV-1, the causative agent of AIDS, remains a global epidemic. According to UNAIDS, an estimated 34 million people worldwide are living with HIV/AIDS. Although a vaccine remains elusive, the development of Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy (HAART) has proven effective in reducing viral loads. HAART primarily targets two HIV-1 encoded proteins (protease and reverse transcriptase). Despite HAART's success, drug resistant strains have begun to emerge, making the discovery of antiretroviral agents that target other viral components necessary. One target that has yet to be exploited is the N-terminal domain of the Gag polyprotein, the retroviral matrix (MA) protein. MA functions as the sole mediator of Gag targeting to viral assembly sites, at the plasma membrane. This targeting is regulated by (1) MA binding to phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate [PI(4,5)P2], which induces subtle conformational changes that (2) expose a sequestered myristate group for tight membrane association. In efforts to target MA for the development of novel antiviral therapies, we use nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to screen potential molecules that bind MA (MA inhibitors, MAI's). Here, we report a novel class of small molecules that bind MA and alter the critical MA-MA and MA-PI(4,5)P2 interactions that occur during viral assembly. Furthermore, preliminary data illustrate that MAI's bind MA and inhibit exposure of the myristate moiety. Finally, we will test our inhibitors in HIV-1 transfected T-cells to determine if they do exhibit antiviral activity. These data will provide support for the development of anti-viral drugs that specifically target the HIV-1 viral assembly. This work is funded by: NIH/ NIAID 5R37AI30917 and NIGMS R25GM055036 More than 33 million people worldwide are currently infected with HIV-1. Efforts to develop HIV therapies remain limited by the use of suitable animal models for clinical studies. We propose the use of felines as an animal model in HIV and hypothesize that the behavior of FIV matrix protein is structurally and functionally similar to HIV matrix protein. It has been shown that myristylated [myr(+)] HIV-1 matrix binds to membrane phospholipid PI(4,5)P2 and causes the matrix protein to undergo a conformational change, anchoring it to the plasma membrane for viral budding. Comparatively, preliminary studies show that unmyristylated [myr(-)] FIV matrix protein has a similar secondary structure to HIV-1 matrix and has an interaction with PI(4,5)P2. Current efforts seek to solve the structure of myr(+) and myr(-) FIV matrix protein and identify its interaction with biologically relevant cofactors. FIV matrix protein was expressed and purified using an E. coli expression system. Due to the hydrophobic nature of FIV matrix, solubility studies were performed to identify conditions to keep the protein stable. Using the OptiSol protein solubility screening assay, two factors-pH and temperature-were shown to significantly improve the solubility of FIV matrix protein. Once these factors were identified, a series of NMR experiments were performed to refine the structure of myr(-) FIV MA and begin to solve the structure of myr(+) FIV MA. Future experiments will determine the structure of myr(+) FIV matrix protein bound to PI(4,5)P2. Characterizing the structure of FIV matrix protein and elucidating its interaction with biologically relevant phospholipids will provide a better understanding of the FIV life cycle and broaden our understanding of lentiviruses and HIV animal models.",

We have expressed and purified the capsid and nucleocapsid domains together as a unit (CANC) for the Moloney murine leukemia virus. Viral genome packaging specificity is mediated by the nucleocapsid domain of assembling Gag polyproteins and the RNA packaging element located in the 5' UTR, known as the \u03a8 site. The minimum region required for packaging is called the core-encapsidation signal (\u03a8ces). Here, we employ isothermal titration calorimetry and electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) to characterize the interaction between CANC and \u03a8ces. Our findings suggest that, the \u03a8 site functions as a RNA structural scaffold that marks nucleation sites for Gag assembly by exposing a cluster of conserved UCUG elements for binding to the cognate nucleocapsid domains of assembling viral Gag proteins. This work is supported by NIH grant number R37AI03097-22. The Mixed Lineage Leukemia protein (MLL), a large H3K4 methyltransferase that maintains HOX gene expression during development, is a frequent target for the creation of in frame chimeric fusion proteins, the most common being AF4 or AF9 of the possible 60 different fusion partners. These N-term MLL fusion proteins cause the upregulation of HOX gene expression, as seen in MLL-AF9. We have shown AF9 is a 'signaling hub' and binds to several proteins implicated in transcriptional elongation, one of which is AF4. We have also found preferentially blocking the AF9:AF4 interaction results in a loss of transformation of hematopoetic progenitor cells. In aggressive mixed lineage leukemias, MLL-AF9 controls its gene expression through Positive-Transcription Elongation Factor b. P-TEFb is a complex of cyclin dependent kinase 9 (CDK9) and Cyclin T1/2 that regulates transcriptional elongation by phosphorylating the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II, leading to the production of RNA transcripts. AF4 is suggested to directly interact with Cyclin T2 of P-TEFb, similar to the mechanism of HIV. Both HIV and leukemogenesis have been implicated in using the AF4 family of proteins to hijack P-TEFb machinery and upregulate their respective gene expression. Our goal is to biochemically validate and structurally characterize this AF4:P-TEFb interaction. The 15N HSQC of AF4 is consistent with an unstructured protein with minimal peak dispersion and may undergo a coupled folding and binding upon interaction with Cyclin T2. This binding interface may lead to potential targeted therapeutics important to both HIV and mixed lineage leukemia.",

A severe reduction in sulfatase activation leads to a lysosomal storage disease known as Multiple Sulfatase Deficiency (MSD), a fatal autosomal recessive syndrome in human. FGE modifies a critical cysteine residue in CXPXR motif of nascent sulfatase polypeptide to C\u03b1-formylglycine (Fgly). The core domain of FGE harbors the substrate-binding groove lined by two catalytically active cystienes, stabilized by two disulfide bridges and two calcium ions. FGE needs a thiol based reductant and calcium ions for Fgly generation. The requirement of molecular oxygen during Fgly generation indicates that FGE could act as a monooxygenase but unlike other monooxygenases FGE does not seem to require a cofactor, indicating that it acts via a novel mechanism. But, the precise mechanism of Fgly generation by FGE is unclear. To gain insights into the mechanism, we analyzed the role of DTT and Ca2+ ions, which are required for Fgly generation in vitro. We find that FGE exists in two redox dependent conformations open (reduced) and closed (oxidized). Further we demonstrate that in the presence of DTT, FGE is predominantly in the open (reduced) state and Ca2+ is necessary to maintain FGE in the closed (oxidized) state. The finding that the bound Ca2+ of FGE is dynamic in nature and can be exchanged by externally supplied Ca2+ indicates that Ca2+ plays an important role in conformational switch. A conformational switch is necessary for activity. The synergistic effect of DTT and Ca2+ is required for maintaining equilibrium between closed and open conformation during activity. We conclude from our findings that a redox dependent conformational switch between open and closed conformations of FGE is facilitated by Ca2+ exchange is a necessary step for formylglycine-generation. Recent studies show that Alzheimer's disease is triggered by beta amyloid (A\u03b2) precursors which further aggregate in larger molecular structures, known as fibrils, and lead to amyloid plaques formation in brain tissue. As a consequence, research efforts are directed away from traditional targets, such as amyloid plaques, and towards early detection of the A\u03b2 precursors. Here we present data showing that Dielectric Relaxation Spectroscopy (DRS) is a very sensitive technique to detect the A\u03b2 precursors. The dielectric response of amyloidogenic A\u03b2(1-42) and non-amyloidogenic A\u03b2(42-1) proteins as a function of frequency (10^-3 Hz to 10^7 Hz), temperature (193K to 283K), and incubation time (0-24 h) was measured. To mimic \"in vivo\" like conditions, the proteins were measured in blood plasma. Our results show that the dielectric signal of amyloidogenic A\u03b2 proteins shifts towards the dielectric signal of the background, as predicted by theoretical calculations. No such shift is observed for the non-amyloidogenic A\u03b2 proteins. In addition, the dielectric signal of both the A\u03b2 and the A\u03b2(42-1) shows two relaxation processes over the measured temperature range. We used two Havrilik-Negami functions plus conductivity to fit the two relaxation processes. We determined the relaxation time for both processes and calculated the corresponding activation energies. We found that for the alpha relaxation process the activation energies of the amyloidogenic A\u03b2(1-42) proteins decreases over time while for the nonamyloidogenic A\u03b2(1-42) proteins it does not change.",

            "text": "In the case of the beta process we observe an initial increase of the activation energy followed by a decrease for amyloidogenic A\u03b2 proteins. However, for the non-amyloidogenic A\u03b2(42-1) the activation energies remain constant over time. These results show that the DRS technique could provide a viable methodology for identifying A\u03b2 oligomers in biological fluids such as blood plasma, and therefore be the groundwork for the development of an instrument capable of testing for early development of Alzheimer's disease. A major mechanism for achieving specificity in PKA signaling is through isoform differences and through targeting of PKA holoenzymes to macromolecular signaling scaffolds through A Kinase Anchoring Proteins (AKAPs). There are four functionally non-redundant PKA regulatory (R) subunits (RI\u03b1, RI\u03b2, RII\u03b1, RII\u03b2), and each have a stable helical dimerization domain at the N-terminus. The cyclic nucleotide binding domains are at the C-terminus. In the absence of cAMP the R-subunit dimers bind to two catalytic subunits creating a catalytically inactive holoenzyme. The hallmark feature of every AKAP is an amphipathic helix (A Kinase Binding motif or AKB), which binds with high affinity to the dimerization/docking (D/D) domain of the R-subunits. Most AKAPs prefer RII subunits and target the PKA holoenzyme to channels, transporters and receptors. The RI subunits are thought to be more dynamic and are disperse in the cytoplasm often becoming targeted only in response to an extracellular signal. Some AKAPs such as DAKAP1 and DAKAP2 bind to both RI and RII and were thus termed dualspecific. Several AKAPs have been discovered recently that are specific for RI subunits. One of these is a small membrane anchored AKAP termed mmAKAP. The mmAKAP has enhanced specificity for RI (5-8 nM) vs RII subunits (50-60 nM). To understand the specificity requirements that allow for high affinity binding of RI-subunits to AKAPS, we crystallized the A Kinase Binding (AKB) motif from mmAKAP bound to the D/D domain of RI\u03b1. We compare this 2.0\u00c5 structure to structures of the DAKAP2 AKB bound to both the RI\u03b1 and RII\u03b1 D/D domains. The helical D/D domain provides an extended hydrophobic surface for binding to the AKAP. The mmAKAP(55-78) binds as a long helix to this D/D surface and shields those highly conserved hydrophobic residues. This structure defines the novel features that create high affinity binding for RI and allows us to understand the molecular basis why mmAKAP is a PKA RI-specific AKAP in vivo. branched-chain\u03b1-ketoacid dehydrogenase kinase (BDK) down-regulates activity of the branched-chain\u03b1-ketoacid dehydrogenase complex (BCKDC), which catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of branched-chain\u03b1-ketoacids derived from branched-chain amino acids leucine, isoleucine and valine. BCKDC is deficient in patients with inherited Maple Syrup Urine Disease (MSUD), resulting in often fatal ketoacidosis, neurological derangement and mental retardation. A known BDK inhibitor phenylbutyrate (PB) was recently shown to increase residual BCKDC activity, lowering branchedchain amino and \u03b1-ketoacid levels in MSUD patients. However, PB is a non-selective BDK inhibitor and has pleiotropic effects in cells. Using high-throughput screening, we have identified a group of benzothiophene (BT) compounds that specifically inhibit BDK kinase activity. Compound BT-3 functions as a prodrug, and is converted to BT-2 in cells; the latter is the actual BDK inhibitor. Both BT-2 and PB bind to a 13-\u00c5 deep pocket gated by Arg-171 in the N-terminal four-helix bundle of the BDK structure. The bound BT-2 attenuates BDK binding to the BCKDC scaffold, thereby preventing the formation of active BDK. Compounds BT-3, BT-2 and their analogues robustly stimulate BCKDC activity in mouse embryonic fibroblasts, primary hepatocytes and animal tissues by thwarting phosphorylation of the enzyme complex. Structure-based design and chemical synthesis are in progress to increase the selectivity and binding affinity of these novel BDK inhibitors for potential use in MSUD therapy. ( Protein-protein and protein-ligand interactions play fundamental roles in biological systems. Being able to accurately predict these interactions and their affinities remains an elusive but desirable goal. In vitro and in vivo investigations focused on understanding these interactions are critical areas of investigation because of their potential value in identifying novel native biochemical interactions and in guiding drug design. Our lab is focused on understanding the fundamental features that determine the affinity and specificity of such interactions employing techniques such as molecular biology, bioinformatics, enzyme kinetics, proteomics, and molecular modeling. Our ultimate goal is to use our improved understanding of these interactions to make meaningful and accurate predictions leading to the elucidation of biological function and the design of molecules that mimic or interfere with these interactions in a therapeutically meaningful way. The primary focus of our lab is on two homologous human proteases, BACE1 and BACE2, which form a small family of membrane-bound aspartyl proteases. The full length forms of these enzymes were initially identified as a result of to their key roles in the Alzheimer's disease amyloid cascade while alternatively spliced mRNAs that could lead to different protein isoforms were described later. Both enzymes have similar tertiary structures and overlapping protein substrate preferences but distinct tissue expression profiles and subcellular localization. Though a few in vivo substrates have been identified, the physiological functions of this family and its members remain elusive. We will describe our success in confirming that the recombinant BACE1 and BACE2 isoforms are indeed active. In addition, we will report our progress in elucidating the physiological functions of these two enzymes by identifying potential native substrates using in vitro and computational methods followed by in vivo methodologies.",

Previously, we have demonstrated the N-terminal domain of NBCe1-A (Nt) is in a pH-sensitive monomer-dimer equilibrium. At neutral pH, bicarbonate binds the Nt, stabilizing dimerization and intermolecular self-associations of dimers. Here, we determine the X-ray crystal structure of the Nt as a dimer at 2.4-\u00c5 resolution by noncrystallographic methods. The structure reveals that R298 implicated in the disease proximal renal tubule acidosis is part of a putative conduit that transverses the Nt. The conduit opens to the transmembrane domain (TMD) on one end and an apparent foyer entrance on the opposite end. The human mutation R298S disrupts an electrostatic pocket within the conduit that disables substrate binding. We also report similar conducts in family member Ae1 (Band 3) when analyzing its crystal structure. Further, we identify by mutational data that the autoregulatory domain (ARD) at the N-terminus of the Nt is responsible for self-associations. We propose a model where the ARD is a gate for the foyer. When selfassociated, the foyer entrance is accessible, allowing substrate entry into the conduit. Objective: Optimization and application of a disulfide mapping method to detect scrambling in stressed protein therapeutics by mass spectrometry. Formation of non-native disulfides (disulfide scrambling) within a protein directly impacts its structure. The ability to detect disulfide scrambled species by mass spectrometry requires a method that is tailored to the specific protein of interest. We have developed a method optimized for the protein glucocerebrosidase (GCase), which has a cysteine dense region in its N-terminal segment. Employing this method, we have confirmed the disulfide linkage pattern of the four Cys residues in this region to the known pattern established by x-ray crystallography. Searching stressed samples of GCase we were able to identify minor disulfide scrambled species. Proteolytic digestion of GCase by AspN was used to generate the N-terminal disulfide containing fragment designated L1A1. Another protease, thermolysin, was then used to introduce cleavages within each Cys residue in order to produce disulfide linked peptides distinct to all possible disulfide scrambled species. LCMS data is collected during RP-HPLC purification of the N-terminal fragment. This allows the screening of partially reduced species by searching for these expected masses. The successful complete digestion of the N-terminal fragment by thermolysin requires carefully controlled conditions. These extra cleavage sites complicate downstream data interpretation but make it possible to identify minor disulfide scrambled species that would otherwise be missed. The method has been applied to a control and stressed sample: GCase incubated for 5years at 4\u00b0C. Electron capture dissociation (ECD) and electron transfer dissociation (ETD) techniques will also be employed due to their ability to provide complementary sequence information.",

Short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) are widely used in cell biology to effect gene knockdown in cell and animal-based systems and siRNA-based therapeutics are currently being used to treat a number of diseases, with more in clinical trials. The major obstacle in widespread use of siRNA-based therapeutics is in achieving efficient, non-toxic delivery of the molecules across the cellular membrane thus there is a large effort to develop effective delivery vehicles for siRNA. The p19 protein is expressed by tombusviruses as a suppressor of RNA silencing where it binds siRNAs size-selectively and sequence-independently with nanomolar affinity, thereby preventing their incorporation into the RISC complex and allowing viral propagation in the host plant. We report the engineering of the p19 protein to function as a novel siRNA delivery agent, mediated by a fused cell-penetrating peptide, and its successful use to mediate gene knockdown in situ. Dysregulation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) has been well established as a factor in the development of many types of cancer, making it a strong candidate for targeting in anti-cancer therapies. Existing EGFR-based therapies, while initially successful in certain cases, become ineffective due to the emergence of secondary resistance mechanisms in the tumor. ErbB3, another receptor in the EGFR family, has been implicated in many of these resistances, and presents a new target for the development of more effective EGFR-based treatments. We have previously designed binders against EGFR using the tenth domain of type 3 fibronectin (Fn3) as a protein scaffold, and have developed a novel antibody-like construct in which these EGFR binders have been joined to an existing EGFR-targeting antibody. This triepitopic antibody-Fn3 fusion has been shown to control the growth of tumors in preclinical studies. Our current studies aim to expand the established antibody-Fn3 platform through the engineering of novel antibodies with dual specificity for EGFR and ErbB3, which will be used with our existing EGFR Fn3 binders. Through use of in vitro experiments assaying signaling and receptor levels, as well as in vivo experiments observing efficacy in controlling tumor growth, we will validate these therapeutics' success as a means of subverting resistance to EGFR-based treatments. Thymosin beta4 (Tb4) is a conserved acidic polypeptide (5 kDa) present in all tissues and fluids of human body. Tb4 stimulates angiogenesis and regeneration processes, acts as an anti-inflammatory agent; therefore, it has been tested in clinical trials as a therapeutic preparation to treat chronic ulcers, epidermolysis bullosa, and corneal epithelial defects. Tb4 was also shown to activate hair follicle stem cells and promote hair growth in normal rodents. Earlier, we have shown that under conventional conditions aging CBRB mice spontaneously develop staphylococcal recurring folliculitis followed by alopecia and ulceration reproducing distinct features of human chronic dermatitis. The aim of the present study was to investigate the therapeutic potential of Tb4 in this mouse model; we were especially interested to reveal long-term effects of this polypeptide formulation. Tb4 formulation (Tb4F) was prepared as 20 mkg/ml solution in glycerol/ water. CBRB females (aged 15\u00b11 week, n=17) showing alopecia and ulcerations on the skin of the back were used. Tb4F was applied on the skin of the experimental group (n=8) at days 0, 2 and 7. Mice of the control group (n=9) received glycerol/water solution in the same manner. The level of skin ulceration and alopecia, the square of damaged skin of the back were monitored as dermatitis manifestations. The long-term effects of drug application were registered 2 and 3 months after peptide application. All mice were followed individually during 2 months after Tb4F application without symptomatic treatment and then they were treated with a standard antimicrobial anti antimycotic therapy. Treated mice showed decreased extent of ulceration and the square of damaged skin of the back after two applications of Tb4F comparing with the parameter values in the control mice (p=0,001). Treated mice showed rapid hair follicle recovery; 2 weeks later no hair damage was revealed in treated mice. In the control mice all dermatitis manifestations severed. 2 months after Tb4F application all the three manifestations of chronic dermatitis in the treated mice were still less expressed than in control group (p<0,001). Moreover, the ulcerations in treated mice were less intensive than in control mice 3 months after drug application (p=0,017). Thus, we showed that Tb-4 reduced the severity of dermatitis manifestations and, therefore can be used as a component of skin disease therapy. Human Fibroblast Growth Factor-1 (hFGF-1) is a heparin binding protein that is biologically important in mitogenesis, angiogenesis, and differentiation. Understanding of the effects of hFGF-1 on these biological processes could have wide ranging applications from cancer metastasis to enhanced wound healing. Activation of the FGF receptor requires hFGF-1 to bind to cell surface proteoglycans, such as heparin sulfate. Inhibition of the high affinity of hFGF-1 to heparin could potentially inhibit the FGF signaling process. Based on preliminary cell proliferation assays, it is believed that His35, located in the heparin binding pocket of hFGF-1, is critical for heparin binding and the thermodynamic stability of the protein. In this context, in this study, the role of His35 in the structural stability of hFGF-1 has been examined using site-directed mutagenesis and a variety of biophysical experiments, including multidimensional NMR spectroscopy. Results of this study suggest that His35 is critical for the thermodynamic stability of hFGF-1 both in the absence and presence of heparin. These results will be presented in detail.",

From our human library of the sequences coding CDRs against contractile proteins (cardiac muscle myosin, actin, alpha-actinin, titin) and SSEA3,4 and TRA160,181, we selected the clones with the highest affinity and specificity. Thereafter, we engineered the constructs fusing coding sequences for CDR targeting muscle apparatus (e.g., cardiac myosin) with the CDR coding stem cell markers (e.g., SSEA3) through the flexible linkers. We further fused such pairs to yield the sequences coding Fv, which were targeting domains of the cardiac muscles and the biomarkers of the stem cells. We expressed them in myelomas, as the integrated antibodies targeting four different molecules -tetrabodies. We further modified them with the fluorochromes and chelates for superparamagnetic ions as reporters. In tests on the isolated cardiac myofibibrils with the laser confocal fluorescence, flow cytometry, western, and native blotting, we revealed their high specificity and affinity. In tests on the cultured cardiac cells, following the exposure to the ischemic stress, in media spiked with the induced stem cells, we demonstrated their high efficiency in anchoring the stem cells to the injured cardiac muscle cells. This novel strategy creates a promising avenue for stem cell based regenerative therapy of the injured heart muscle. Bio-layer interferometry (BLI) has gained popularity in recent years as a reliable, yet simple method for analyzing protein-protein and other biomolecular interactions. BLI has the advantage of probing unmodified proteins, thus eliminating potential perturbation of the interactions being studied, and, avoiding the time-consuming and expensive steps required by the use of labels. To further enhance the ease with which label-free analysis can be performed, we have developed new methods using BLI that allow for rapid identification, quantitation and characterization of expressed protein from a very low volume of sample. New methods and data will be presented to illustrate the ease of incorporating BLI into a lab workflow.",

However, hFGF-1 has a short half-life and is quite unstable under room temperature conditions. It has been shown that heparin stabilizes hFGF-1 against thermal denaturation and decreases susceptibility to proteolysis. The quadruple point mutation Q54P/S61L/H107S/K126N is being examined with expectations of increasing overall thermodynamic stability of hFGF-1. The quadruple mutation was achieved by PCR and over-expressed in Escherichia coli in high yields (15mg/L). Biophysical techniques used for examination of the protein include Fluorescence Spectroscopy, Circular Dichroism (CD), Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC), Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC), Two-dimensional NMR Spectroscopy, and ANS (8-anilino-1-naphthalene sulfonate) binding experiments. Results from Fluorescence Spectroscopy and CD show that the mutant protein has not undergone significant conformational change. ANS binding results show an increase in the solvent-accessible hydrophobic surfaces in the hFGF-1 mutant. ITC and DSC results show that the mutant protein has a significantly lower affinity for sucrose octasulfate (SOS), a heparin analog, than the wild type, but the thermodynamic stability of the protein is significantly enhanced in the presence of SOS. Results of this study suggest that the thermodynamic stability of the quadruple mutant of hFGF-1 is enhanced through compensatory structural interactions. Details of these results will be presented. Source of research support: NIH, NSF, and DOE A strongly desirable pulmonary delivery of a potent immunomodulator interferon\u00ac\u03b3 (IFN\u03b3) is limited by its high hydrophilicity and thus poor permeability through the hydrophobic barriers of the respiratory epithelium which in turn results in low bioavailability of the protein. Earlier, we used a genetic construct consisting of parts of the genes coding for IFN\u03b3 and surfactant C protein (SpC) to produce a recombinant IFN-SpC fuse protein*. The notable \u03b1-helix of the SpC part of the chimeric protein comprising 10 valine residues is designed to promote the protein penetration from the airway surface through the surfactant layer down to the immune cells residing in the epithelium. Old CBRB mice under conventional conditions were shown to mimic some characteristics of human chronic dermatitis spontaneously, resembling distinct characteristics of folliculitis, impetigo, ectyma, and some others. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of intranasal application of various interferon formulations on mouse chronic dermatitis manifestations. The formulations IFN-SpC fuse protein were applied 4 times daily via intranasal route (20 mkl/ mouse/application). The following parameters and symptoms of dermatitis were monitored: the level of skin ulceration and alopecia, the area of damaged skin on the back, and the animal weight. The degree of ulceration and the area of damaged skin in FS (small dose) and FL (large dose) treated mice decreased one week post drug application comparing with the parameter values in control mice. *A Chimeric Interferon-Surfactant Protein for Medical Applications, patent No. 391403 of the Russian Patent Office .",

However, selection of peptides that are specifically internalized into the cell is more difficult. Partitioning of internalized versus surface bound phage is necessary for enrichment of relevant clones and requires stringent washing conditions and efficient internalization. Using a peptide directed against EGFR as an example, a phage pool was spiked with different percentages of a winning clone to mimic enrichment, and a panel of internalization and washing schemes was assessed to quantify partitioning and identify optimal conditions for biopanning. Recovered phage as a function of time was used to identify the rate of internalization. We then applied the spiked phage pools at 37 C and at 4 C (where internalization should be minimal) and compared the eluted phage titers after washing. Clones from the recovered phage were sequenced and this information was used to estimate the partitioning efficiency as a function of enrichment. We demonstrate that in the early rounds of selection, very little phage is internalized, partitioning is poor, and selection is driven predominantly by receptor binding. Similarly, inefficient scrubbing of the cell surface reduces partitioning in highly enriched phage pools. We also show that pre-enrichment of phage libraries with recombinant protein does not necessarily avoid the lack of partitioning in the early rounds of selection. These results should aid in the optimization of phage selection strategies for receptor-mediated delivery of therapeutic payloads.",

Our goal is to develop a set of orthogonal protein-peptide pairs that can be used to manipulate existing cellular processes. We base our design on the tetratricopeptide repeat, a 34-amino acid helix-turn-helix motif. In cells, tandem tetratricopeptide repeats bind peptides and regulate many protein-protein interactions. Our template TPR recognizes the C-terminal residues MEEVD. Here, we alter the specificity of our template to recognize the C-terminal residues MEEVV. We screen a small hydrophobic TPR library for binding to MEEVV using the in vivo split GFP assay. We further characterize the affinity and specificity of the designed TPR-peptide interactions using quantitative pulldowns and isothermal titration calorimetry. Our designed TPRs recognize MEEVV with a 1 \u03bcM Kd. However, they also bind other hydrophobic peptides such as MEEV\u03a6 (where \u03a6 is I, L, V and M) equally well. Therefore, the free energy is independent of ligand size and shape. Interestingly, however, the thermodynamic signature depends on ligand size and shape. Therefore, these designed interactions are an interesting system to study hydrophobic protein interactions. They may also be used to modify existing protein interactions in vivo.",

A light-switchable DNA-binding protein was previously made by fusing the bZIP region of GCN4 with the light-sensing photoactive-yellow protein (PYP) from Halorhodospira halophila, a marine bacterium (2, 3) . This chimera, designated as GCN4PYP, has 3-4 times higher affinity for DNA when irradiated with blue light in vitro (3) . In this study, the photo-switching ability of GCN4PYP was recapitulated in vivo using red-fluorescent protein (RFP) reporter. By inserting the target DNA sequence upstream of the gene coding for the RFP, GCN4PYP's binding to DNA would interfere with RFP expression. Several strains of E. coli were tested to optimize the RFP reporter system. Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting (FACS) was able to detect varying levels of RFP transcription in individual cells. The potential for using this system to artificially evolve a superior light-switchable DNA-binding protein is discussed. 1. Fenno, L. et al. Annu. Rev. Neurosci.

These switching properties make RSFPs interesting labels for super-resolution microscopy, most notably in RESOLFT (REversibly Saturable OpticaL Fluorescence Transition) -type microscopy. However, the pronounced photobleaching, low brightness, slow switching speed and high switching fatigue of most previously reported RSFPs limited their use for RESOLFT-type microscopy. We report on the generation of a novel RSFP, namely rsEGFP. This bright and photostable protein exhibits fast switching characteristics and can be photoswitched more than a thousand times between the On-state and the Off-state enabling for the first time RESOLFT-type microscopy of living cells and tissue. In living cells, an optical resolution <40 nm was attained using light intensities of ~1 kW/cm2, which is a million fold less than the intensities generally used in Stimulated Emission Depletion (STED) super-resolution microscopy. Mitochondrial and gyloxysomal forms of malate dehydrogenase are thought to be subject to allosteric regulation by citrate. To explore the mechanisms of citrate effects on the enzyme we have used a combination of initial rate kinetics, site directed mutagenesis, circular dichroism (in conjunction with thermal melts) to follow effects on secondary and tertiary structure, dynamic light scattering and size exclusion chromatography to follow effects on quaternary structure and limited proteolysis to explore local flexibility/accessibility changes. Citrate, which binds to only one of the two otherwise identical active sites, is a partial inhibitor under all circumstances examined (varied pH, forward or reverse reaction) and does not affect the potent substrate inhibition observed at high oxaloacetate concentrations. Citrate shows a dramatic pH dependence for its affinity, binding approximately 10 fold better at pH 6 than pH 7 or 8. It has little or no effect on the stability of tertiary structure as assessed by thermal melts and has no effect on the quaternary structure of the protein. Citrate does however induce changes in local flexibility/accessibility in a loop near the subunit interface. Several mutations at the subunit interface (V195A, L269A, E256Q, H90Q)also impact citrate inhibition. Together these results suggest that citrate exerts its effects on activity by binding to the \"empty\" active site in a reciprocating subunit mechanism, eliciting altered subunit interactions that contribute to overall catalysis. The green fluorescent protein and its homologues have become essential tools for the visualization of protein distributions and of dynamic processes in living cells and organisms. In the last decade members of a new subclass of fluorescent proteins, namely the reversibly switchable fluorescent proteins (RSFPs) have attracted widespread attention for their unique property that they may be repeatedly photoswitched between a fluorescent and a non-fluorescent state by irradiation with light of two distinct wavelengths. However, the full potential of these conventional RSFPs has been curtailed for many applications since switching and fluorescence read-out in these proteins is strictly coupled. To overcome this limitation we generated the RSFP Dreiklang, which enables reversible photoswitching independently from fluorescence excitation. In Dreiklang, fluorescence is excited at ~515 nm, whereas reversible on-and offswitching is accomplished at illumination wavelengths of ~365 nm and ~405 nm, respectively. High resolution X-ray analysis of single Dreiklang protein crystals in the photoswitched off-and on-states demonstrate that switching in Dreiklang is based on a reversible hydration/dehydration reaction of the chromophore. This molecular reversible switching mechanism was further supported by mass spectrometry data. The unique switching properties of Dreiklang enabled far-field fluorescence super-resolution microscopy in living mammalian cells using both an ensemble and a single molecule based switching approach. Dreiklang represents a new class of RSFPs opening up new possibilities in light microscopy. Identification of reliable biomarkers in the blood requires access to technologies with sufficient specificity and sensitivity to meet the complexity of blood proteomic. In addition, the focus on proteins as biomarker has now being expanded to other biomolecules such as high molecular weight microvesicles and exosomes. We have recently developed a variant of proximity ligation assay (4PLA) in which target molecules to be detected are captured via affinity binders immobilized on a solid support while other components in the sample are washed away. The target molecules are then recognized by four PLA probes -four antibodies each extended by a unique DNA oligonucleotide. When these four probes bind proximally to a common target molecule the DNA oligonucleotides of the probes are brought sufficiently close so that in the presence of a cassette DNA oligonucleotide they create an amplifiable reporting DNA molecule via two enzymatic ligation events. The combined use of five binding reagents and efficient PCR amplification provide very high specificity and sensitivity, which distinguishes the 4PLA method from conventional protein detection methods. Here, we illustrate the application of 4PLA for sensitive detection of high-order protein complexes, such as prostasomes, as biomarkers for prostate cancer. References 1. Darmanis S. et al. Mol.

            "text": "In the course of protein evolution, the interactions between side chains are optimized for overall organism fitness. An enzyme must both be stable and fulfill its metabolic role within certain kinetic parameters. Because the preferred environment of organisms can vary widely across phylogenies, homologous enzymes can have similar backbones but different side chain packing, thereby fine-tuning interaction strength and dynamic mechanisms for environmental conditions. This evolution-driven varying of side chain packing can create positional correlations in multiple sequence alignments. It has been shown that these correlations may reflect stabilizing interactions, but do not necessarily do so. We present here correlation-guided mutations made in the adenylate kinase enzyme of Bacillus subtilis bacteria (bsADK) which, in the context of a destabilized variant, affect kinetic activity without altering stability. The folded lid domain of bacterial ADK closes over the active site following substrate binding. This domain is stabilized by either a zinc-chelating motif in grampositive species or by a network of hydrogen bonds in gram-negative species. Mutating the four chelating residues of bsADK to their counterparts in Escherichia coli ADK (ecADK), abolishing metal-binding, results in a severe drop in global stability and the loss of enzymatic activity. Using mutual information analysis, we located two positions in the lid domain strongly correlated to chelating motif. Further mutations were made in bsADK at these positions. These additional mutations were found to have little effect on global stability, but served to partially rescue enzymatic activity. Although it is understood that loss and gain of stability can directly alter the dynamics of adenylate kinase, the fact that these variants do not vary in stability suggests that they could serve as an experimental system for further studying the kinetic pathway of this enzyme. We are currently pursuing biophysical strategies to further characterize these variants and elaborate on their kinetic differences. structure of the enzyme has been characterised from several bacterial species, including, Escherichia coli, Thermotoga maritima, Vibrio cholerae and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The enzyme forms different oligomeric structures in the crystal form depending on the species. Moreover, DAPDC from the Gram-negative eubacteria E. coli and T. maritima is monomeric, while the enzyme from the Gram-negative eubacterium V. cholerae is dimeric, and the eubacterium M. tuberculosis produces DAPDC as a tetramer in the crystal form. We hypothesise that the diversity of the enzyme's quaternary structure is linked to species diversity and/or the environment in which the enzyme functions, and that dimerisation is required for activity. Accordingly, the aim of this study is to characterise the quaternary structure of DAPDC in solution and crystal forms from diverse eubacterial species. We have thus cloned, expressed, and purified DAPDC from Bacillus anthracis and are currently conducting structural studies comparing B. anthracis DAPDC with the enzyme from Psychromonas ingrahamii, T. maritima, V. cholerae, and M. tuberculosis. Presently, we have found that recombinant DAPDC from B. anthracis, V. cholerae, and M. tuberculosis form dimers in solution from analytical ultracentrifugation studies at various concentrations. Interestingly, DAPDC from the thermophile T. maritima forms tetramers in solution.",

To date, different BMC's carrying out just three distinct types of metabolic processes have been characterized. In the present work we use comparative genomics to explore the possible existence of BMC's carrying out a broader variety of metabolic pathways. The operons coding for these supramolecular BMC assemblies share a canonical genomic signature: multiple paralogous protein shell genes -i.e. structural proteins of the shell -interspersed with genes coding for enzymes responsible for distinctive metabolic pathways. Based on this property, we developed an approach to investigate the likelihood that additional pathways might be housed within BMC's in various bacteria. In particular, we designed an automatic clustering algorithm that groups together enzymes that show a strong tendency to be encoded in chromosomal proximity to each other when they are also near genes encoding BMC shell proteins. The results highlight new types of putative BMC's, including one based on pyruvate utilization (referred to here as the Put microcompartment), while also illuminating specific variations among the well-known BMC's. A general view is that BMC's appear to host a small number of core pathways, which in some cases can be extended beyond their minimalistic function by integrating other enzymes or regulatory proteins into the BMC operon. Based on these new considerations, we propose a more articulated classification of microcompartments and their metabolic variants than previously recognized.",

            "text": "The current landscape of nanotechnology has focussed attention on materials that self-assemble. The search for such materials has unsurprisingly led to the biological world, where nanoscale biomolecular assemblies are in abundance. Amyloid fibrils are one such selfassembling biological structure, formed when native proteins misfold into insoluble fibrous quarternary structures. This research has explored the use of amyloid fibrils formed from waste proteins, namely crude crystallin proteins from fish eye lenses, as biological nanowires. The use of amyloid fibrils as nanowires was investigated by examining the ability to control their dimensions and arrangement, along with analysis of their properties, such as stability and conductivity. TEM and AFM studies on the model amyloid forming protein, bovine insulin, showed that a number of fibril length distributions can be achieved, by systematically altering fibril growth and storage conditions [1] . Crystallin fibrils can also be produced on a range of length scales [2] . Amyloid fibrils can be manipulated and aligned in a controlled manner by dielectrophoresis (DEP); this tool could later be used to incorporate amyloid fibrils into a biosensing or bioelectronics device. DEP was also used to immobilize fibrils between electrode pairs, in order to investigate the conductivity of small numbers of fibrils. These experiments complemented work carried out on the conductivity of amyloid fibril networks, using fabricated interdigitated electrodes. In the unmodified state, amyloid fibrils formed from bovine insulin, fungal hydrophobins, and crude crystallins were all shown to have low conductivity, with current values in the range of 10-8-10-10 A recorded at bias voltages of 0-2 V. Amyloid fibrils were used as a template for the synthesis of conductive nanowires, by modification with conducting polymers, increasing conductivity by up to four orders of magnitude. The functionalisation of fibrils with glucose oxidase enabled the creation of a very simple glucose sensing device, which showed an electrochemical response in the presence of glucose and the mediator FcOH. Future work is necessary to optimise the use of amyloid fibrils in this way; however, this study confirms a role for amyloid fibrils from a low cost source in bionanotechnology. The steroid receptors (SRs) are a family of transcription factors that control genes involved in development, endocrine signaling, reproduction, immunity, and cancer. The entire hormone-receptor system is driven by the binding of small lipophilic ligands, making SRs ideal pharmaceutical targets. However, even the best clinically used synthetic steroids are prone to crossreactivity and off-target pharmacology, and as such their use carries the risk of side-effects. This promiscuity is due to the fact that all modern SRs are descended from a common evolutionary ancestor, and share common structural features derived from this relationship. Rational attempts to probe steroid drug selectivity are frequently complicated by the inherent instability of the extant SRs, hindering detailed mutational analysis and preventing the crystallization of key receptor-ligand complexes. We have taken a unique approach to address this problem by using resurrected ancestral proteins to determine the structure of a previously intractable complex, identifying the structural mechanisms that confer activation and selectivity for mometasone furoate (MOF), a widely used synthetic glucocorticoid. The X-ray crystal structure of the ancestral glucocorticoid receptor AncGR2 in complex with MOF and a TIF2 coactivator fragment was solved to 2.5 \u00c5. This structure was compared to the structures of other SRs, and to functional data obtained from ligand binding and activation assays, in order to explain the selectivity of MOF for the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) over the androgen (AR) and mineralocorticoid (MR) receptors, and its cross-reactivity with the progesterone receptor (PR). Moreover, we identify a single residue located outside of the ligand binding pocket that enables activation of MR by MOF when mutated to its ancestral state.",

Albino3 (Alb3), an integral membrane protein, has been shown to act in cooperation with cpSRP to facilitate the targeting and insertion of LHCP into the thylakoid membrane. Recent studies have shown that the soluble C-terminal domain of Alb3 (C-term Alb3) interacts with the 43 kDa subunit of cpSRP (cpSRP43). The ankyrin domains and the C-terminal chromo domains (CD2-CD3) of cpSRP43 have been demonstrated to contribute to the binding of C-term Alb3. This study is aimed at characterization of the structural forces governing the interaction of the CD2-CD3 domains of cpSRP43 with C-term Alb3. In this context, the three-dimensional solution structure of CD2-CD3 has been determined using multi-dimensional NMR spectroscopy. The 3D structure of CD2-CD3 consists of two helices and six anti-parallel beta-strands. The C-term Alb3 interaction sites on CD2-CD3 were mapped using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) experiments. One of the C-term-Alb3 peptides (CM4) showed significant binding (Kd ~ 8 \u00b5M) to CD2-CD3 but not to the isolated CD2 or CD3 domains. Results of the Far UV and intrinsic fluorescence experiments show that moderate conformational changes occur in the CD2-CD3 domain on binding to CM4. 1H-15N chemical shift perturbation experiments suggest that E59 and E88 in CD2-CD3 contribute significantly to the binding of CM4. ITC results reveal that mutation of E88 completely abolishes the binding of CM4 to CD2-CD3. Additional experiments suggest that the interaction between CM4 and CD2-CD3 is predominantly electrostatic. The synthesis of proteins by the 70S ribosome involves a variety of translation factors with ribosome-dependent GTPase activity. Of current interest is the role that ribosomal protein L7/L12 plays in the interaction of these factors, and their subsequent GTPase activation, with the 70S ribosome. We have shown that selective removal of L7/L12 causes a reduction in the GTPase activity of the translation factors, most dramatically for elongation factor G (EF-G). Current work focuses on further elucidation of the mechanism of L7/L12 on stimulation a variety of GTPase translation factors (EF-G, RF3, EF4, BipA and IF-2). To quantify the GTPase activity of these factors, an optimization of an assay that measures the amount of inorganic phosphate in solution using Malachite Green has been underway. Additionally, this assay is being employed to investigate the inhibitory effects of the antibiotics thiostrepton and micrococcin on the activity of EF-G and EF4 in the presence of the ribosome. Our previous work has shown that a mutation removing EF-G domains IV and V results in a protein that is no longer sensitive to thiostrepton, which has been hypothesized to block the interaction of domain V with the ribosome. Current investigations, however, have indicated that a mutant lacking only domain V is sensitive to thiostrepton, in contrast to previous speculation. Further studies using affinity-purified 70S ribosomes will allow for further characterization of the role of L7/L12 in the activation and various thiopeptide antibiotics in the inhibition of translation factors that possess ribosome-dependent GTPase activity.",

Heparin facilitates the dimerization and activation of the FGF receptor. Large number of proteins containing positively-charged arginine and lysine have high binding affinities to heparin.

The purified Hep-tag, was characterized using various biophysical tools to understand structure and mode of interaction with heparin. Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) results showed that HEP-tag binds to heparin with nanomolar affinity (Kd ~ 150 nM), and far-UV CD spectral analysis suggested that the peptide was predominantly in random coil conformation in solution. However, upon binding to heparin, the affinity tag folded into a helical conformation. Steady state fluorescence suggested that the Hep-tag binds to heparin in a 1:1 stoichiometry. Multi-dimensional NMR data suggest that the binding between the HEP-tag and heparin is predominantly electrostatic. These results will be discussed in detail.",

This enzyme is wellknown as the first committed and rate-limiting step in the mevalonate pathway for biosynthesis of isoprenoids and the target for statin drugs for lowering serum cholesterol levels. However, a search of the B. cenocepacia genome strongly indicates that this organism lacks the other enzymes of the mevalonate pathway, while expressing the enzymes of the nonmevalonate pathway for isoprenoids. Several other bacteria appear to have a similar organization, and may represent a unique subclass of bacterial HMG-CoA reductases (HMGRs) not used for isoprenoid biosynthesis. Kinetic data for B. cenocepacia HMG-CoA reductase shows that this enzyme uses only NAD(H), not NADP(H), as the hydride donor/acceptor, indicating that the enzyme likely runs in an oxidative, rather than reductive, direction in vivo. Additional kinetic and structural characterization suggests that this enzyme is unusual among HMG-CoA reductases in possible regulatory properties as well. Ongoing progress toward a HMGR gene knockout in B. cenocepacia will also be presented. Immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) purification of secreted histidine-tagged proteins in eukaryotic cell culture supernatants is often problematic. Incompatibility with the cell culture media appears as stripping of the immobilized metal ions required for binding of target proteins. . Due to low target protein concentration in cell culture supernatants, large sample volumes are often needed, aggravating the stripping effect. In this study, purifications of histidine-tagged proteins were performed using two novel Sepharose\u2122 based IMAC media; Ni Sepharose excel and magnetic His Mag Sepharose excel. Both media have a new type of chelating ligand with exceptionally strong binding of nickel ions. Data showing successful purification of histidine-tagged proteins from CHO cell culture supernatants will be presented. In comparison, conventional IMAC medium showed no recovery of target protein. Furthermore, the characteristics of new media enabled purification of target protein from insect cell culture supernatants. The purification was easily scaled up from 20 \u00b5l His Mag Sepharose excel beads to 1 mL pre-packed columns.",

The relationship between structure and function was studied to determine the contributions particular amino acids at the cofactor interface and the central inter-domain loops in 3phospho-glycerate dehydrogenase. (3pGDH), may play in flexibility and the protein's function. Multiple techniques show significant changes in local protein flexibility upon serine binding, including limited proteolysis, a sophisticated analysis of crystallographic B-factors, and normal-mode analysis using Gaussian and anisotropic network models. The results suggest the active form is flexible and populates multiple conformers including both active and inhibited conformations, whereas once serine binds, PGDH becomes rigid and is locked into an inactive, open conformation. Although much of the protein rigidifies upon serine inhibition, the tetrameric core becomes flexible; this suggests a reallocation of conformational entropy that breaks an Asn190 intersubunit interaction, which may be involved in serine cooperativity. Local conformation was probed by collisional quenching using positive, negative and neutral quenching agents, limited proteolysis and dynamic light scattering. Based upon available crystal structures a number of amino acids were identified by analysis of the temperature factors that may show altered flexibility in response to serine binding. In addition in conjunction with analysis of the temperature factors of bound cofactor (NAD(H)) we observe that two of the 4 central loops in the tetramer structure are more flexible than the other two and that this correlates with increased affinity for the cofactor. This creates an entropy sink that can be used to harness flexibility changes for catalysis and allosteric regulation. Various point mutations of specific amino acid residues involved in this \"entropy sink\" were created and the expressed proteins purified using Ni-NTA affinity chromatography. Preliminary results suggest significant effects on activity as well as serine allosteric effects. Our observations suggest the presence of an entropy sink which contributes to cofactor binding cooperativity and possibly catalysis and serine regulation.

SDS-PAGE analysis showed that the obtained purity of the kinase was above 90% and the amount purified protein was 3 mg. Further, four purification cycles, without cleaning and Co2+-recharging between the runs, show that the HiTrap TALON crude columns can be used several times without loosing performance.

Assemblies that rely on highly specific biomolecular interactions are an attractive approach for the tailoring of nanostructure and bottom-up design of materials with sophisticated properties. Here, we use the intrinsic self-assembling properties of the designed, rod shaped, superhelical consensus sequence tetratricopeptide repeat protein, CTPR to generate a nanostructured biomaterials. X-ray scattering experiments confirm macroscopic alignment of the CTPR molecules within the material and CD and FTIR measurements show that the individual CTPR molecules retain their secondary structure in the film. Furthermore, CTPRs maintain their ligand binding functionality within the material. We will discuss structural and physical properties of nanostructured material, and its ability to impose order on the otherwise disordered molecules such as quantum dots and fluorescent dyes. This work opens the door to generation of innovative biomaterials with tailored structural and functional properties. Enzyme activity can be conditionally regulated by introducing a self-splicing intein into the target enzyme. Inteins are protein domains that self-splice from a protein structure, covalently linking the N-and C-terminally adjacent residues of the protein host. Inteins can be developed into an efficient binary switch where intein insertion results in loss of activity, and splicing regains activity. We are exploiting this technology to express cell wall hydrolytic enzymes as inactive precursors in plants to reactivate the enzymes after harvest. This strategy decouples enzyme production from hydrolysis and enables high level expression without detrimental effects. This technology has utility in the auto-hydrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass and in other industrial and agricultural applications. To develop glycoside hydrolases with regulated intein splicing, the location and identity of the intein were varied within target enzymes. For certain intein-enzyme combinations, intein splicing was trained for either temperature or pH inducibility and catalytically active enzymes were recovered after splicing. Intein variants with conditionally regulated splicing were produced using random and site-directed mutagenesis. Proteins that showed conditional activation at splicing induction conditions were further optimized in successive rounds of mutagenesis and screening. These enzymes are now being introduced into transgenic crops to decrease the cost of cellulosic biofuel production. This research was funded in part by the United States Departments of Agriculture (USDA) and Energy (DOE ARPA-E). The soluble periplasmic fumarate reductase (FccA) permits anaerobic growth on fumarate as the terminal electron acceptor for numerous gram negative bacteria, but in the metabolically versatile Shewanella, an additional role has become apparent, i.e., in electron transfer to mineral phase Fe3+ at the cell surface. Moreover, highly abundant FccA acts as an \"overflow buffer\", storing excess electrons when electron transfer rates are slow. Induced anaerobically, FccA protein abundance is diminished under aerobic conditions. Further, we find that in the presence of oxygen the remaining FccA becomes highly oxidized with formation of methionine sulfoxides at methionine residues proximal to both the active site and heme groups involved in electron transfer into the active site. In vitro exposure to hydrogen peroxide and the subsequent methionine oxidation results in a loss in reductase activity which is prevented by the presence of methionine sulfoxide reductase B-A, a fused enzyme capable of reduction of both R-and S-steroisomers of methionine sulfoxide. These results suggest that reversible methionine oxidation provides a mechanism by which FccA retains sufficient levels of inactive protein in the periplasm under aerobic conditions that permits its rapid re-activation upon re-establishment of anaerobic conditions that precedes the synthesis of new protein. Such a redox regulatory mechanism is critical to the organism's ability to retain metal reduction capacity without extensive cellular damage from reactive oxygen species generated as a result of the high content of transition metal cytochromes within the oxidizing environment of the Shewanella periplasm. In classic studies, different Ras isoforms were shown to be directed to different localization pathways by divergent C-terminal hypervariable regions. More recently, N-terminal GFP fusions have become an established method to study Ras localization. GFP fusions have been used to test how deletions in the Ras isoforms or small fragments of them affect localization in a variety of cell lines. Substitutions in the hypervariable region have been used to identify the role of individual amino acids. Here, we present an alternative approach to investigate localization via chimeragenesis between NRas and KRas4B to test the localization motifs within the context of a complete Ras protein. When fused to GFP and introduced to COS-7 cells, our chimeras have confirmed the necessity of the polybasic region in KRas4B for plasma membrane localization and that of the secondary cysteine in NRas (the site of palmitoylation) for Golgi localization. Furthermore, statistical modeling of the data demonstrates a significant effect for the previously proposed role of the catalytic G-Domain of NRas in Golgi localization. Since NRas is localized to the Golgi in COS-7 cells, we could not confirm a role for the proposed linker motif in the partition between Golgi and plasma membrane. Application of these chimeras to activated cell lines should reveal any role for the combination of these determinants in localization changes associated with activation. Palladin is a recently discovered actin-associated protein that appears to be involved in both normal cell migration and invasive cell motility. Recently, we demonstrated that palladin is able to both bind and bundle actin filaments directly and revealed that one of the immunoglobulin-like domains of palladin (Ig3) is a novel actin-binding domain. These results indicate that palladin occupies an unusual functional niche, as it possesses the properties of both an actin-crosslinking protein and a molecular scaffold that binds to multiple other actin-regulating proteins. In the work presented here, we determined the NMR solution structure of palladin's Ig3 domain and identified two basic patches that are critical for actin-binding and bundling. The results we have obtained provide insight into the manner in which palladin binds and crosslinks actin filaments and suggest the importance of electrostatics in this interaction. Electrostatics are also a major determinant in actin polymerization, therefore we further present preliminary kinetic data that indicates palladin may also be capable of inducing actin polymerization. In addition, we examined whether the Ig3 domain of palladin is required for actin organization in a cellular context. In cells transfected with a full-length palladin construct containing a deletion of the actin-binding domain we observe dramatically altered cellular distribution of both palladin and actin, which suggests that this interaction is critical. These findings are critical for understanding the mechanism that palladin utilizes in promoting cell motility by identifying residues within the palladin Ig3 domain that are important for actin binding and bundling, but also points to a mechanism for actin filament crosslinking.

How do sequence dependent molecular properties of proteins and their homeostasis interplay in shaping the fitness landscape of an organism? To address this question, E. coli's cells were presented with a set of defined destabilizing mutations introduced in a controlled manner into the coding sequence of folA gene encoding an essential dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). This approach allows to relate the mutationinduced changes in the biophysical properties of the endogenously expressed DHFR protein molecules to the observed in vivo changes in the fitness of strains carrying these mutations. Further, to discern which components of the protein quality control (PQC) system specifically interact with the mutant DHFR proteins, we perturbed intracellular concentrations of its major representatives. Specifically, we over-expressed key chaperone GroEL/S and knocked-out out several non-essential ATPdependent proteases (ClpAP, ClpXP, ClpAPX, HslUV, and Lon) and monitored the resulted change in fitness of DHFR mutant strains. Lon appeared to be the only protease deletion of which affected fitness in a mutantdependent manner. GroEL/ES over-expression or Lon deletion had a symmetrical effect on 27 DHFR mutant strains tested: all strains with near-lethal phenotypes were rescued (some back to the wt-like level), whereas the effect on strains with near-neutral phenotypes was either neutral or deleterious. We show that the observed symmetry in the activity of the two opposite arms of the protein homeostasis machinery, chaperonins GroEL/ ES and Lon protease, stems from the competition for binding to the compact folding intermediate of DHFR affected by the destabilizing mutations introduced into the protein. Kinetic steady-state model highlights the difference between the effects of mutations on proteins in solution as opposed to active cytoplasm: In solution, mutations redistribute a fixed amount of protein between its thermodynamic states, while in cytoplasm, energy-driven components selectively interact with the thermodynamic states and affectively change total protein abundance, thus contributing to the fitness effects of mutations. Previously, the attempts to generate transgenic mice ubiquitously expressing tetrameric DsRed (a coral red fluorescent protein of Discosoma genus) were failed probably due to the toxicity of aggregated red fluorescent proteins in embryonic stem cells. Thus, the physiological outcome of expressing DsRed tetramers in adult mice was not explored. In this study we generated the transgenic red mouse by first generating a green to red switchable mouse with a vector containing loxP-EGFP-loxP cassette preceding the DsRed sequence, and the red mouse was resulted by cross the switchable mouse with a Cre mouse. The resulted mouse expressing DsRed tetramers was normal in development, size, and husbandry. However, mice with homozygous DsRed alleles developed respiratory distress, carditis, ventricular hypertrophy and fibrosis, left atrium thrombosis, dilated heart failure, and death at the age averaging 5.5 months old. The hemizygote mice developed similar symptoms at an average 12 months old. To confirm the heart origin of the morbidity in red mice, we induced DsRed expression specifically in cardiac tissues and the results confirmed the same diseased phenotypes by expressing DsRed only in the heart. To explore the cause of carditis and the underlying association with aggregated DsRed, we performed the molecular analysis on red mice at earlier stages and found that expression of myopathy and fibrosis related genes were significantly altered at 8 wk, long before the appearance of pathological abnormality and clinical onset of the diseases. Interestingly, expression of the proliferation and senescence related genes were also altered in cardiac tissues and in the primary skeletal myoblasts of the red mice. While the direct molecular evidence for the toxicity of tetrameric DsRed proteins remains unclear to us and that the red mice intriguingly managed the protein aggregates without symptoms until 5 months old, the transgenic mouse with DsRed expression can suffice a valuable in vivo model for failed protein quality control and can be utilized in the studies on protein aggregate toxicity and on the cardiac myopathy that relates to senescence and autophagy of myocytes.

Unrelated to enzyme inhibition by lead, the activity of HsPBGS is regulated allosterically via an equilibrium of inactive hexamers and active octamers. Genetic variations that perturb this equilibrium can result in the inborn error of metabolism know as ALAD porphyria. Furthermore, small molecules can inhibit HsPBGS in vitro by stabilizing the hexamer. We address whether components of the National Toxicology Program library of putative toxins can stabilize the HsPBGS hexamer and inhibit activity in vitro. Native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was used to screen the library (1,408 compounds) for those that altered the oligomeric distribution of HsPBGS. Freshly purchased samples of 37 preliminary hits were used to confirm the results and determine the dose-dependence of the effects on oligomeric distribution and inhibition of HsPBGS catalytic activity. Seventeen compounds were identified which alter the oligomeric distribution and catalytic activity of HsPBGS, including the most potent HsPBGS inhibitor yet characterized (Mutagen X, IC50 = 1.4 \u00b5M). Analogs of Mutagen X were utilized to further characterize the structure-activity relationship of this inhibitor. We have established that some toxins stabilize the inactive hexamer of HsPBGS and also inhibit catalytic activity. Allosteric regulation of activity via an equilibrium of alternate oligomers may occur for other proteins. Based on the precedent set herein, perturbation of these oligomeric equilibria by small molecules (such as toxins) can be considered as a mechanism of toxicity.

Beyond normal physiological function, MMPs have been implicated in number of diseases including cancer, atherosclerosis, and arthritis. The activity of MMPs is regulated by tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs). MMP-3 (stromelysin-1) and MMP-10 (stromelysin-2) possess 85% sequence identity throughout the catalytic domain but are very distinct in their physiological functions. MMP-10 in particular is implicated in lung tumorigenesis and tumor progression, specifically in non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC).",

Despite high sequence homology among stromelysin family members, comparing our structure of MMP-10cd/ TIMP-1 complex with the previously solved structure of MMP-3cd/TIMP-1 (PDB: 1UEA), we see subtle conformational differences at the binding interface that can account for the differential binding of stromelysins to TIMP-1. Efforts to crystallize stromelysins in complex with TIMP-2 are also in progress; these structures along with our existing data can offer important information for designing strategies to selectively increase the affinity of TIMPs towards individual members of the stromelysin family.

Most targets of miRs are identified by assessing changes in the transcriptome. While transcriptome analysis is successful in capturing mRNAs that are targeted for degradation, it fails to identify targets regulated via translational repression in which mRNA abundance is unaltered. Therefore, a method to systematically identify targets at the proteomic level is needed. Bio-orthogonal non-canonical amino acid tagging (BONCAT) is a method that labels the cellular proteome using the cell's endogenous machinery, co-translationally incorporating non-canonical amino acids into newly synthesized proteins. Azidohomoalanine, a methionine analogue, has been used to tag newly synthesized proteins, presenting azide groups at methionine positions. An alkyne-functionalized purification tag can be attached via copper-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition to selectively enrich newly synthesized proteins from the pre-existing protein pool, reducing sample complexity and making the proteome amenable to temporal characterization by mass spectrometry. Here we combine BONCAT with stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC), to identify protein targets of miR-126 in the human metastatic breast cancer cell line mda-mb-231. MiR-126 has been proposed to suppress metastasis, and is down-regulated in many types of cancers; however, only a few of its targets have been identified. The results of this study will help elucidate the mechanism of suppression and provide insight into the design of epigenetic therapies that restore expression of tumor suppressor genes.",

This highly heterogeneous aromatic material is extremely resistant to breakdown. The biodegradation of lignin is facilitated by fungal and bacterial extracellular oxidative enzymes. They perform free-radical-based random depolymerization producing small-molecule aromatic compounds that are metabolized in vivo by aerobic and anaerobic pathways. However, the import of these chemicals to the cell has not been thoroughly characterized. We used a library of lignin degradation products and a fluorescence thermal stability assay to study ligand-binding profiles for a set of solute-binding proteins (SBPs) of ABC transporters from Alphaproteobacteria. The results enabled us to distinguish a subset of proteins (so-called cluster I) that recognize benzoate derivatives. For four homologs, we have obtained seven high-resolution crystal structures in complex with four different benzoate-derived compounds. The protein-ligand pairing observed crystallographically correlates well with the binding experiments. Structural data enabled us to identify residues lining the binding pocket and provide details of molecular recognition that can be used to infer ligand specificity. The ligand-binding characterization allows for the assignment of the functional roles of several SBPs, many of which have been mis-annotated as branched-chain amino acid-binding proteins. The results demonstrate that Alphaproteobacteria contain a broad spectrum of transport capabilities for ligninderived compounds. A detailed analysis of this new class of transporters will advance genomic annotation projects and provide insight into the metabolic potential of soil bacteria.

Characterization and elucidation of such protein complexes may provide insights into receptor activation mechanism and new therapeutic strategies. In this report, we describe the study of homodimer and heterodimer formation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family of RTK, EGFR and Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 (HER2), on the surface of living cells. By employing SNAP/CLIP-tag technology, EGFR:EGFR homodimer and EGFR:HER2 heterodimer can be selectively captured by covalent linkage with a crosslinker containing specific reacting groups for SNAP-tag or CLIP-tag. Subsequent analysis by Western blotting allowed differentiation of dimer forms and analysis of the dimer/monomer ratio. This approach also enables the investigation of transient receptor interactions at the cell surface and ligand-independent receptor activation. Furthermore, this selective crosslinking system has also been applied to validate the effect of a drug Gefitinib on receptor dimerization and kinase activity.

In Gram-negative bacteria FabI is an attractive target for the development of antimicrobials due to its essentiality for bacterial survival. Our laboratory has recently reported a novel and potent series of benzimidazole compounds with promising antibacterial activity against F. tularensis. We report here the crystal structure of the most active compound bound to FabI along with the cofactor NADH. Enzyme kinetic studies indicate that this inhibitor is competitive with respect to the substrate and uncompetitive with respect to the cofactor NADH. These studies also confirm that this series of inhibitors does not form slow, tight-binding interactions with the enzyme unlike other known inhibitors. Details regarding the characteristics of enzyme inhibition and the structural analysis of the binding mode of the compound will be presented. Computational protein design (CPD) is developing as a practical alternative for solving problems in enzyme catalysis and stability. CPD and protein engineering methods have been applied to improve enzyme stability and enzyme catalysis. Stability is a vital parameter for applying an enzyme in industrial applications, allowing for higher process temperatures, which in turn bestow favorable effects on reaction rates, reactant solubility, and more efficient industrial processes. Adenylate kinase (AK) was selected as a model enzyme since its ubiquitous importance in the catalysis of living cells makes it a provocative design target. Previous studies on chimeric forms of AK have shown that the CORE domain determines thermostability and the AMP and LID domains determine the activity. Diverging from canonical protein design studies where a single protein structural template is selected and multiple structures are designed from this template, we have investigated a novel aspect of enzyme design by selecting seven highly similar AK mutant structures as input for computational thermostabilization, toward the production of 100 redesigned enzyme variants. Our computational design approach leverages knowledge of a mutationallypredisposed region of the CORE domain to optimize the amino acid composition for thermostability. Each of the computational designs were purified and characterized for thermostability using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The designed enzymes all increased thermostability, up to 22\u00b0 C relative to the wild-type AK, such that the activity maxima (of a given AK) is proportional to the variant's Tm. Interestingly, the ability to computationally confer stability in a given starting template was found to be dependent upon the stability of the parental structure. This observation reveals the presence of an underlying thermostabilization limit imposed by hydrophobic packing of core residues, and the data set introduces a novel a priori metric valuable to protein engineers for evaluating the ability to further enhance the thermal properties of a given structure.",

Recent evidence shows that hemoglobin acts as a nitrite reductase, reducing nitrite to nitric oxide (NO) and contributing to vasodilation under low oxygen conditions. Our objective is to determine how increased nonenzymatically glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) disrupts normal nitric oxide physiology. To determine the effect of glycation on the nitrite reductase activity of hemoglobin, we compared the nitrite reductase activity of non-glycated hemoglobin (HbA0) to the nitrite reductase activity of hemoglobin with a covalently linked sugar (HbA1c). The molecular basis for this difference is also explored, primarily focusing on difference in allostery.

It has been proposed that such symmetric homodimers underwent gene duplication and fusion to evolve into protein topologies that have a symmetric arrangement of secondary structure elements-\"symmetric superfolds\". Here, the ROSETTA protein design software was used to computationally engineer a perfectly symmetric variant of imidazole glycerol phosphate synthase and its corresponding symmetric homodimer. The new protein, termed FLR, adopts the symmetric (\u03b2\u03b1)8 TIM-barrel superfold. The protein is soluble and monomeric and exhibits two-fold symmetry not only in the arrangement of secondary structure elements but also in sequence and at atomic detail, as verified by crystallography. When cut in half, FLR dimerizes readily to form the symmetric homodimer. It is further hypothesized that protein domains evolved from smaller intrinsically stable subunits via combinatorial assembly. Illegitimate recombination of fragments that encode protein subunits could have quickly led to diversification of protein folds and their functionality. Guided by computational design, we optimized the interface between fragments of the (\u03b2\u03b1)8-barrel and the flavodoxin-like fold with five targeted mutations yielding a stable, monomeric protein whose predicted structure was verified experimentally. We further tested binding of a phosphorylated compound and detected that some affinity was already present due to an intact phosphate-binding site provided by one fragment. The affinity could be improved quickly to the level of natural proteins by introducing two additional mutations. These studies demonstrate progress in our understanding of the underlying principles of protein stability and presents an attractive strategy for the in silico construction of larger functional protein domains from smaller pieces.",

Here we describe the development of a sub-millimolar reactive enone protein binder with catalytic activity for the Morita-Baylis-Hillman reaction. Recent computational work has created catalysts for simple unimolecular reactions, and more recently for a bimolecular reaction. The Morita-Baylis-Hillman (MBH) reaction is a carbon-carbon bond forming reaction that creates products in which multiple functional groups have been preserved for subsequent synthetic steps. No enzyme or catalytic antibody catalyzes the reaction, raising the question of whether the MBH reaction can be accelerated by a protein in aqueous solution. The MBH occurs via formation of two distinct enzyme-substrate intermediates and via four transition states. The design of a protein catalyst for the MBH would represent a major step forward in enzyme design, the first multistep reaction catalyzed by a designed protein, and an example of a useful synthetic reaction accelerated by a protein. Here we demonstrate the design of a protein capable of tightly binding cyclohexenone in the first step of an MBH reaction with p-nitro-benzaldehyde (with kM of 500 micromolar for cyclohexenone), and two proteins capable of accelerating the full MBH reaction but without a tight binding of the second reactant (kM > 4 mM). Crystal structures of both designs show an active site positioned to bind cyclohexenone, but without the catalytic and binding components for the second step of the MBH intact. Using these designs we demonstrate a selection scheme for the first step of the reaction, by fluorescent labeling of the covalent intermediate, and a screen for the full reaction, that could be used to customize the catalysts for new substrates or to enhance catalytic activity in a broader screen.",

It consists of several procedures arranged as a linear pipeline: 1. Binding site prediction. Binding propensities are computed for each residue in each monomer, using the Empirical method Pinup [1] or using the evolutionary trace method [2] . Manually assigned interface information from the literature can also be added. The propensities are then mapped onto the protein molecular surfaces; 2. Surface docking. The molecular surfaces are docked with a score to maximize the geometrical surface complementarity, using an extension of the geometric hashing algorithm, which rapidly provides thousands of complex structures after clustering; 3. Scoring. The docked surfaces are scored by a function that considers shape and electrostatic complementary, as well as binding site propensity; 4. Refinement. High-scoring candidates are then refined by energy minimization, weakly restraining the entire backbone structure. Steps 1-4 have been automated and implemented in the web server surFit (http://sysimm.ifrec.osaka-u.ac.jp/surFit/). 5. Re-refinement for flexible docking. Molecular dynamics simulation [3] with explicit water molecules is carried out to relax the complex structures and to allow flexibility for the interfaces and the solvent molecules. The first steps 1-2 roughly produce as many as 10,000 possible candidates complexes, and the following steps 3-4 select the better ones. The final step 5 can identify the stable complex structures, with satisfactory interfaces with solvent molecules. The current protocol succeeded in building many acceptable predicted complex structures at the recent CAPRI targets, T51, 53, and 54, in addition to accurate estimation of solvent water positions at the interface for CAPRI target T47.

Hemecopper oxidases (HCO) contains a heme-copper center that catalyzes important O2 reduction in respiration while nitric oxide reductases (NOR) contains a hemenon-hem iron center that reduces NO to N2O in denitrification. NORs are structurally homologous to subunit I of HCOs; however, the copper site (CuB) in HCO is replaced with a non-heme iron site (FeB) in NOR. An interesting question is why the protein, when using copper (as in HCO), is proficient at O-O bond cleavage and when using iron (as in NOR), is efficient at N-N bond formation. We are addressing this question by designing a CuB site or a non-heme FeB site in myoglobin by rational design using computer modeling and energy minimizations. X-ray crystallography, spectroscopic studies and activity assays have shown the designed proteins are both structural and functional models of HCO and NOR. Through the protein design and characterization processes,1-8 we have elucidated the roles of a) CuB and FeB in HCO and NOR reactivities; b) heme types (i.e., a/ o or b types) in regulating O2 binding and reduction; c) the covalently linked His-Tyr in modulating the binding affinity and geometry of CuB and FeB, the reduction potentials, and reactivities; and d) non-covalent interactions such as the presence of hydrogen bonding and water in conferring and fine-tuning the enzymatic activities.

Designing a pair of split proteins, especially the selection of appropriate split points, however, is rather serendipitous. Furthermore, some split proteins do not self-associate each other. Here we describe a new methodology to generate a split protein of interest with split GFP as a self-association module. In this method, we first inserted the whole GFP module at one of several candidate split points in the protein of interest, and chose clones retaining a relatively high activity of the original protein as well as GFP signal. Once such chimeric clones were identified, a final pair of split proteins was generated by simply splitting the GFP-inserted chimera within the GFP domain. Applying this strategy to Renilla reniformis luciferase, we identified a new split point which gave ten times higher activity than the previous split point. We also successfully identified new split points for HaloTag protein and firefly luciferase to generate a pair of selfassociating split proteins. These proteins recovered functions of both GFP and the original proteins. This simple method of screening will facilitate the designing of split proteins which are capable of self-association via the split GFP portions. With a new pair of split reporter proteins, the process of the membrane fusion can be monitored with a higher sensitivity.

Ligand-dependent activity has been engineered into enzymes for purposes ranging from controlling cell morphology to reprogramming cellular signaling pathways. Where these successes have typically fused a naturally allosteric domain to the enzyme of interest, here I instead describe an approach for designing a de novo allosteric effector site directly into the catalytic domain of an enzyme. This approach is distinct from traditional chemical rescue of enzymes in that it relies on disruption and restoration of structure, rather than active site chemistry, as a means to achieve modulate function. I will present two examples in which we engineer indoledependent activity into enzymes by removing a buried tryptophan sidechain that serves as a buttress for the active site architecture, leading to loss of function. The subsequent addition of indole then restores structure, and thus enzyme activity. Disruption and recovery of protein structure may represent a general technique for introducing allosteric control into proteins, and thus serve as a starting point for building a variety of bioswitches and sensors.

Tal-nucleases (TALENs) have recently emerged as an addition to the gene-targeting toolbox, but off-target activity has yet to be thoroughly examined. Alternatively, engineered zincfinger recombinase (ZFR) fusion proteins offer a more tightly targeted approach for genetic modifications. ZFRs are artificial DNA-modifying enzymes composed of zinc-finger proteins fused to highly selective catalytic domains derived from the serine resolvase/invertase family of enzymes. By combining the sequence-specific recognition of the zinc-fingers with the sequencedependent catalysis of the recombinase, these fusions demonstrate cooperative sequence specificity, resulting in genomic target sites of >50 bases. An additional benefit of ZFRs lies in the mechanism of action employed on the target sequence; ZFRs catalyze specific recombination events with predictable product sequences, as opposed to the unpredictable assortment of \"indels\" that result from ZFN-and TALEN-induced double-stranded breaks. ZFRs demonstrate exceptional efficiency and selectivity in the context of both exogenouslyintroduced target sites as well as endogenous genomic sites. Extensive biochemical and functional studies have been carried out with the Gin invertase and our current efforts look to expand the breadth of the targeting capability of ZFR-based technology to include the recombinases Sin and Beta. Activated variants of Sin and Beta capable of catalyzing recombination in the absence of their requisite accessory factors have been identified. Alanine-scanning and structure-guided mutagenesis have revealed details of the molecular interactions governing Sin and Beta recombinase sequence specificity. Our results suggest that thoughtful manipulation of the DNA recognition arm of the Sin and Beta recombinases will allow selective targeting of genomic DNA sequences, thus expanding the repertoire of the ZFR platform. The project described was supported by Grant Number DP1OD006990 from the Office Of The Director, National Institutes Of Health and also by the Skaggs Institute of Chemical Biology. We have previously reported that very basic physicchemical principles could be applied to computationally design a short (~75 amino acid residues) Kemp eliminase, nicknamed AlleyCat (PNAS, 2011, 108, 6823) . AlleyCat relies on calcium-binding domains (EF-hands) to provide the necessary energy to stabilize a single glutamate in the middle of a hydrophobic pocket. Computational designs often serve as starting points for directed evolution to further improve activity. However, directed evolution of proteins is often hindered by poor stability of protein folds as a result of multiple mutations introduced to improve the desired function. Additionally, small proteins are generally believed to be less suitable for directed evolution, since a fairly limited number of mutations will disproportionally affect their stability. Here we show that the stabilizing effect of metal-binding loops allows for improving activity by directed evolution even in small proteins. A single round of saturation mutagenesis in the positions adjacent to the substrate binding site identified two mutations (H107I and M144R) that produce additional 12-fold increase in k cat /K M bringing the overall rate acceleration of Kemp elimination to more than a 1,000,000-fold over background.",

ZFN technology has received much attention because it is envisioned as a powerful tool for genome editing (2). For wider use of the rapidly progressed ZFN technology, it is required to overcome many technical obstacles. In this study, we aim to develop a rapid and facile screening and assay systems for producing reliable ZFNs that possess high sequence-specific recognition and cleavage activities. Previously, we demonstrated our mix-and-match strategy, which complete ZFNs are non-covalently reassembled from separately expressed zinc finger domain and FN that fused to one of anti-parallel leucine zippers, respectively. Our result showed that these reconstitutable ZFNs (reZFNs) assembled by help of formation of anti-parallel dimeric leucine zippers and successfully cleaved target sites in a sequence-specific manner. We has investigated several approaches to improve DNA cleavage activity of reZFNs. One of them is to optimize the length of linker between the anti-parallel leucine zipper and the FN. We examined different linkers ranging from 7 to 15 amino acids to improve the cleavage efficiency. As a result, It appeared that the 11-amino acid linker showed the best cleavage efficiency among reZFN constructs. Our work will contribute to creating optimized ZFN technology to apply in various applications such as gene manipulation and gene therapy. The long-term goal of this project is to develop a reducing catalyst capable of generating molecular hydrogen from aqueous protons. We are using a bioinspired approach to design artificial proteins that recapitulate all components of the natural [FeFe] hydrogenases in an integrated system: a catalytic center containing a diiron complex, the activity of which is modulated by the protein matrix in which it is embedded; a chain of redox active centers, in Nature [Fe4S4] clusters, which forms the conduit to transfer electrons to the active site; and a designed protein interface, which connects the catalyst to a source of reducing equivalents, in this case an electrode. Towards this goal we designed a family of coiled-coil helical proteins, which we functionalize with organometallic active sites. One of this modules, DSD-[Fe4S4], contains multiple -[Fe4S4] clusters and acts as a molecular wire that we interface with other functional protein modules via specific protein-protein interactions. By introducing additional organometallic centers into related modules and by designing specific protein-protein interfaces, we aim to reconstruct reaction chains to convert the collected solar energy into a fuel, mimicking the function of natural photosystems. DSD-[Fe4S4] contains two iron sulfur clusters in the core of a closed dimeric three helix bundle (DSD). Experimental characterization confirms complete cluster incorporation; EPR-ELDOR experiments demonstrated a cluster to cluster distance of 36 A, in agreement with the design. Having successfully designed the molecular wire component, we turned our attention to the catalytic site. In [Fe-Fe] hydrogenase, the site contains an asymmetric diiron site coordinated by a dithiolate bridging ligand and by carbon monoxide (CO) and cyanide (CN) ligands. The protein matrix presents several highly conserved residures, which stabilize the cluster and are critical for activity. We designed a model hydrogenase in which the diiron site is covalently anchored tot he protein via an unnatural amino acid, and demonstrated direct incorporation into the helical framework of an intact (\u03bc-SRS)[Fe(CO)3]2 cluster. The model protein efficiently catalyzes hydrogen production in mild aqueous conditions. Current work is focused on improving catalytic efficiency by engineering second sphere interactions. .",

Four design strategies guided experiments designed and carried out by undergraduates in both research and teaching labs. The challenges of adapting protein design and affinity testing to the undergraduate laboratory are more than compensated for by the rewards of practical, transferable student learning and of the large number of proteins produced by multiple parallel student groups. Protocols for accomplishing recombinant protein production and purification in the undergraduate teaching laboratory, as well as a system for the students to submit and share data, are available at geni-science.org. Our four design strategies were as follows: First, we evaluated the stability of amino acid mutations in MICA located beneath the interface with NKG2D using RosettaDesign. Three mutations increased MICA affinity for NKG2D as measured by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) by 20-fold through ground-state destabilization. The second design strategy optimized MICA residues that contact NKG2D. Ten single mutations proposed by RosettaDesign increased MICA-NKG2D affinity by 2-fold to 8-fold. Most combined surface mutants were subadditive, but some enhanced binding through enthalpic stabilization. A combination of four of the five best single mutants increased affinity by 19fold from wild-type. In a third strategy, we combined the best results from the two previous strategies in a MICA variant that bound NKG2D with 50 nM affinity. The fourth design strategy used HyPare to locate and optimize electrostatic hotspots in the context of the third-strategy septuple mutant, providing two sites for electrostatic optimization. Binding of these mutants appears strong by qualitative SEC binding assay, and quantitative binding constants will be obtained by SPR in the physical chemistry lab. RosettaDesign predicts that a glycine mutant will provide increased affinity through ground-state destabilization, which is similar to our first strategy. These results demonstrate that an integration of protein design into the undergraduate curriculum can produce many student-designed mutant proteins in parallel, testing many possibilities and resulting in novel high-affinity protein binding reagents.

Although these constraints have been addressed, their effects on evolutionary trajectories, and specifically on protein evolution, remain largely unknown. We generated a complete transition of enzyme function, starting from a naturally occurring phosphotriesterase, eighteen iterative rounds of random mutagenesis and selection were performed, yielding an efficient arylesterase. The resulting trajectory led to >10^9fold change in the enzyme's selectivity, yet exhibited strong diminishing returns. The increase in the evolving arylesterase activity dropped from >4.8-fold per substitution at the start of the trajectory, to ~0.18-fold at its end. Further, initially, a 1,600-fold gain in the newly evolving arylesterase activity was accompanied by 28fold loss of the original activity. However, at the final stages, a 21-fold gain traded off with ~1,400-fold loss. Structural analysis indicated that the diminishing returns appear to be the result of the early mutations mediating a new mode of substrate binding and catalysis, whereas the late ones provide a second shell of interactions that reinforce the early mutations and stabilize the evolving enzyme. The likelihood that a mutation will fixate is proportional to its fitness gain. The strong diminishing returns and tradeoff underlining the late evolutionary stages therefore suggest that the catalytic efficiency and specificity of many natural enzymes, particularly those in secondary metabolism may be far from optimum and might be further refined.",

            "text": "The artificial evolution of enzymes is one of the ultimate goals of evolutionary molecular engineering (directed evolution). Display technologies, such as phage display, mRNA display and ribosome display, have been widely used for affinity selection against various targets in the last two decades 1 . Conversely, although some groups have been able to evolve enzymes using phage display 2 , there are only a few examples describing mRNA display 3 and ribosome display 4 . One of the reasons for the limited number of these examples may be the lability of the mRNA moiety in the protein-mRNA conjugate molecules used in these technologies. Recently, we have developed cDNA display technique that involves covalently bridging the cDNA and its coded protein via a puromycin linker 5 . The protein-DNA conjugated library generated by cDNA display using this linker should be more stable against degradation by ribonucleases and can be used under several screening conditions, including in blood, serum and the cytoplasm for medical enzymes, and under various physical conditions such as high-temperature, alkaline pH and organic solvents required for industrial enzymes. In this study, to evolve the protease \"subtilisin\" as a model enzyme, we designed a selection system with a new puromycin linker of the cDNA display for in vitro selection in the same manner as ribozyme selection. We will discuss the The evolution of new enzymatic activities is generally thought to be initiated from promiscuity in substrate binding or catalysis, followed by mutation and selection to optimize this nascent activity. However, the majority of examples of enzymatic promiscuity involve fairly subtle changes in the activity or substrate specificity of hydrolytic enzymes such as esterases. The evolution of firefly luciferase presents a more complicated example. This enzyme is thought to have evolved from fatty acyl-CoA synthetases, and retains their ability to activate fatty acids as AMP esters and convert them to fatty-acyl CoAs. While these enzymes share ~40% identity, fatty acyl-CoA synthetases fail to yield bioluminescent light emission upon treatment with the native luciferase substrate D-luciferin. So how did this activity develop? We have synthesized a family of rigid firefly luciferase substrates as bioluminescence imaging probes. Remarkably, we have found that several of these luciferins reveal latent luciferase activity in a fatty acyl-CoA synthetase from the non-luminogenic organism Drosophila. These heterocycles differ considerably in structure from the native fatty acid substrates. Moreover, the mechanism of luciferase light emission requires oxidation and decarboxylation of the intermediate luciferyl-AMP ester, steps not known to be carried out by fatty acyl-CoA synthetases. This result suggests that nascent luciferase activity is already present in fatty acyl-CoA synthetases, and supports the idea that the evolutionary appearance of a new enzyme substrate can unmask latent enzymatic activity by taking advantage of promiscuity in both substrate binding and catalysis. Furthermore, the inherent chemical properties of the substrate itself can direct enzyme function: in this case, luciferase activity requires that the oxidized substrate can access and emit light from an excited state. Beyond the implications for evolution and protein engineering, this result suggests that related enzymes in other species are candidate latent luciferases whose activity could be revealed by treatment with synthetic luciferin analogs, potentially allowing fruit flies and other non-luminous organisms to glow like fireflies. This work was supported by the NIH (EB013270 Noninvasive imaging methods to observe brain activity at a molecular level would be of significant benefit to neuroscience and the study of neurological disorders. To this end, we report several advances toward sensing biomolecules important in neurotransmission, neuromodulation, and inflammation by proton magnetic resonance imaging . These approaches rely on exploiting the biomolecular specificity of naturally and artificially evolved protein binding pockets, as well as the natural and augmented proton spin relaxation effects of paramagnetic metalloproteins. Cytochrome P450 hemedomain mutants have been screened to reveal a set of turn-off MRI sensors for monoamine neurotransmitters with micromolar to submicromolar affinity, for which specific Type II ligand binding confers as much as a 93% change in T1 contrast enhancement at 4.7 T. Through crystallographic analyses, we show that these mutants exhibit selectivity among structurally similar monoamine neurotransmitters by the introduction of orthogonal binding modes into the P450 active site. By examining the NMR field-dependence of T1 relaxation rates, we propose that improved paramagnetic T1 relaxivities of these mutants over wild type are explicable by increased solvent exchange rates, an observation that is consistent with changes in solvent-associated active site electron density in crystals. To further augment the basal T1 contrast effect of P450-based sensors, we have developed a recombinant bacterial expression system for metalloporphyrin-substituted hemoproteins based on overexpression of the E. coli heme transporter ChuA. We demonstrate that ChuA is a promiscuous metalloporphyrin transporter, allowing for incorporation of synthetic exogenous porphyrins with high yield into nascent overexpressed P450 heme domains, yielding Mn(III)-substituted P450 variants with as much as 2.6-fold higher T1 relaxivity than the native ferric wild type protein. Applying ChuA-mediated metalloporphyrin substitution to a range of previously reported thermostable chimeric P450 variants, we report a manganic variant with high affinity for arachidonic acid, an important neuronal and inflammatory signal. Finally, we discuss recent advances toward sensing intracellular neuronal signaling events using genetically encoded contrast sensors expressed in situ. This work was generously supported by grants from the NIH and the Jacobs Institute at Caltech. Insertions and deletions (indels) are allegedly highly deleterious mutations because they are more likely to disrupt the structural integrity of proteins than substitutions. On the other hand, indels also appear as important sources of diversity in many natural evolution processes, such as the modification of active site loops to generate new enzyme functions (Tawfik, 2006) or the emergence of new protein structures (Grishin, 2001) . Therefore, indels may induce significant structural changes that substitutions only cannot cause and are believed to be key players in natural protein evolution. However, these mutations have usually been overlooked in directed evolution and, more generally, protein engineering experiments. We aimed at establishing a method enabling random incorporation of indels into proteins in order to systematically examine the effect of these mutations and to perform directed evolution experiments combining both substitutions and indels. So far, few protocols have been developed to introduce randomly indels in a target protein. Moreover, these approaches lack flexibility regarding the control of indels' size and sequence. Based on a previously reported methodology (Jones, 2005) , we have further developed new genetic engineering tools to construct and screen indels mutant libraries. Using transposition mutagenesis, our approach enables to delete and/or insert oligonucleotides of desired length and sequence randomly in a gene of interest, thereby leading to the generation of protein libraries with single, double or triple triplet (codon) insertion or single triplet deletion. We also constructed a set of expression vectors that will be used both for the generation of indels mutant libraries and for their subsequent screening. We thus provide a novel reliable protein engineering methodology that will allow us to perform a systematic analysis of the effects of indels on proteins and carry out directed evolution experiments incorporating indels. Preliminary results suggest that, while being probably more destabilizing than substitutions, indels will be an innovative source of diversity to evolve new functions and follow alternative evolutionary trajectories.

Understanding the rules that govern the interactions between these micro-and macroscopic levels, the genotype-phenotype map, remains one of the fundamental problems of modern biology. Experimental approaches used to address this problem so far generated rather dense genotype map that, in most cases, precluded from relating a single substitution event to a particular phenotypic trait. Here we explore the genotype-phenotype relationship by introducing controlled substitutions into the E. coli's chromosome and measuring the fitness effect of a single amino acid change at a time. Specifically, 27 strains carrying mutations in the essential folA gene encoding dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) were generated by a site-directed chromosomal mutagenesis. The effect of each of the introduced mutations on the biochemical/ biophysical properties of DHFR was evaluated in vitro, thus allowing to pinpoint fitness effects measured by competition between wt and mutant DHFR strains to specific changes in protein stability, activity or intracellular abundance. We found no significant correlation between protein stability and its catalytic activity and between catalytic activity and fitness in a limited range of variation of catalytic activity observed in mutants. Strong correlation found between stability of mutants and their intracellular abundance suggests an active role of protein homeostatic machinery in maintaining intracellular concentration of proteins. Significant correlation between intracellular abundance of soluble DHFR and fitness was observed when cells grew at 30oC. The picture was quite different at 42oC: mutant DHFR proteins in a few strains aggregated rendering them nonviable but the majority exhibited fitness higher than wild type. We found that mutational destabilization of DHFR proteins in E. coli was counterbalanced at 42oC by soluble oligomerization that restored their structural stability and protected from aggregation. This finding adds a completely underappreciated new dimension to our understanding of genotype-phenotype relationship: protein stability mediates fitness effects through perturbations in solubility. Determining how enzyme specificity evolves will provide guiding principles for protein engineering and function prediction. Two features of the o-succinylbenzoate synthase (OSBS) family make it an excellent model system for identifying these principles. First, the OSBS family is extraordinarily diverse; some members share <15% identity. Second, some OSBS family members catalyze another reaction, N-succinylamino acid racemization (NSAR). While OSBS catalyzes a step in Vitamin K synthesis, NSAR is in a pathway that converts D-amino acids to L-amino acids. NSARs cannot be segregated into a separate family by sequence similarity because they are more similar to some OSBSs than many OSBSs are to each other. Also, all characterized NSARs catalyze both OSBS and NSAR reactions, regardless of their biological function. Genome context shows that some OSBS/NSARs are even bifunctional in vivo. As a result, the OSBS family offers an opportunity to determine how new protein functions evolve through promiscuous intermediates. The only residues that are conserved in all OSBS family members participate directly in catalysis. These residues are also conserved in many homologous enzymes that do not have OSBS activity, so they are not sufficient to determine specificity. We hypothesized that the OSBS family could be divided into subfamilies which each use a different set of residues to bind and orient the substrate for catalysis. To test this, we used bioinformatics to identify sequence differences between OSBS subfamilies and experimentally determined the roles of the variable amino acids in catalysis. Mutating R159 and G288 in the active site of E. coli OSBS decreases activity 200-1000-fold. These residues are conserved in most OSBS subfamilies. However, they are not conserved in the subfamily containing the promiscuous OSBS/NSAR enzymes. This subfamily binds the substrate in a different orientation, eliminating selective pressure to retain glycine and arginine at these positions. This supports a model in which mutations at different positions in different OSBS subfamilies compensated for deleterious mutations. These compensatory mutations may have preadapted one subfamily to catalyze NSAR activity, which was opportunistically recruited into a new pathway for scavenging D-amino acids.

The functional, structural, folding and stability properties of this new monomer are discussed and compared with another monomeric TIM variants, in order to address the dimeric nature of the wild-type enzyme. The presence of Proline 44 a residue located in the loop 2 of this enzyme is discussed in terms of their possible participation in enhance the catalytic activity of TIM after monomerization.",

Motivated by this search problem, we developed a novel algorithm to compare protein structures. Procedures to identify structural analogs are typically conducted in 3 dimensional space: the tertiary structure of a target protein is matched against each candidate in a database of structures, and goodness of fit is evaluated by a distance-based measure, like the rootmean-square distance between target and candidate. This is an expensive approach because 3 dimensional space is complex. Here, we transform the problem into a simpler 1-dimensional procedure. Specifically, we identify and label the 11 most populated residue basins in a database of high-resolution protein structures. Using this 11-letter alphabet, any protein's 3 dimensional structure can be transformed into a 1-dimensional string by mapping each residue onto its corresponding basin. Similarity between the resultant basin strings can then be evaluated by conventional sequence-based comparison. The disorder order folding transition is abridged on both sides. At the onset, folding conditions necessitate formation of hydrogen-bonded scaffold elements on which proteins are assembled, severely restricting the magnitude of accessible conformational space. Near the end, chain topology is established prior to emergence of the close-packed native state. At this latter stage of folding, the chain remains molten, and residues populate natural basins that are approximated by the 11 basins derived here. In essence, our algorithm reduces the protein folding search problem to mapping the amino acid sequence onto a restricted basin string.

Circular dichroism measurements indicated that these two peptides form only marginally stable collagen triple helices but that their stability can be increased upon the addition of metal ions. Dynamic light scattering analyses, turbidity measurements, TEM, and SEM results demonstrated the metal ion-dependent self-assembly of X9 and PHG into supramolecular structures ranging from various nano-fibrils to microscale spherical, laminated, and granulated assemblies. The topology and size of these higher-order structures depends both on the metal ion identity and the location of the binding sites. Most intriguingly, the assembled fibrils show similar D-periodicity to that of natural collagen. Our results demonstrate that metal-histidine coordination can serve as an effective force to induce the self-assembly of unstable collagen-related peptides into various large-scale structures. We have developed a high-throughput, ab initio method to predict the structure of interacting transmembrane helices mediated by networks of weak hydrogen bonds between C\u03b1 donors on one helix and backbone carbonyl groups on the other helix (C\u03b1-H...O=C hydrogen bonds). These interactions, which often involve GxxxG and similar small amino acid patterns, are observed in a large fraction of membrane proteins. Their unique structural characteristics make the C\u03b1-H... O=C-mediated interactions remarkably special from a computational point of view, providing a number of constraints that makes them more amenable to prediction at near atomic level. These backbone-tobackbone interactions are strongly dependent on the packing of the side-chains, which needs to be permissive. Moreover, specific backbone arrangements are required to orient the helices so that the geometry is compatible with interhelical hydrogen bonding formation. All these characteristics make these motifs more recognizable. Our method is based on a pre-computed analysis of the conformational space that allows formation of C\u03b1-H... O=C-mediated interhelical interactions, which allows to limit substantially the search space. Moreover, we have precomputed the sequence requirements of each allowed region of conformational space, which reduce the conformational search even further. The result is a fast method that predicts the structure of know transmembrane homodimers, such as Glycophorin A and BNIP, with near atomic precision (< 1.0\u00c5 C\u03b1 RMSD). The rapidity of the method allows us to perform genome wide searches for predicted C\u03b1-H... O=C-mediated interhelical dimers. Within the predicted human single-pass transmembrane annotated in Uniprot, we have identified hundreds of possible candidates for homodimerization mediated by interhelical C\u03b1-H... O=C hydrogen bonds. Our preliminary experimental characterization of the top candidates confirms that our method can structurally predict self-associating dimers. The method provides an opportunity for building and validating a comprehensive atlas of transmembrane interactions in entire genomes. The intracellular lipid-binding protein (iLBP) family member, cellular retinoic acid-binding protein 1 (CRABP1), adopts a canonical 10-stranded \u03b2-barrel fold with a two-helix cap over the site where ligand accesses the binding cavity within the barrel. CRABP1 folds via a rugged energy landscape with early (ms) and fast phases (100 ms) that precede the rate-determining 1 s folding phase. Previous work showed that native barrel topology was formed in the 100 ms phase, but the sequence determinants for this key step were not known. We carried out kinetic and thermodynamic analysis of 30 point mutants of CRABP1 to interrogate its folding landscape. Our results show that the ratelimiting transition state is strongly polarized: Residuespecific native-like interactions involving the N-and C-termini, edge strand 1', C-terminal strand 10, helix 2, and turn 4 form before the rate-determining transition state, while the major hydrophobic core residues interact non-specifically. Specific barrel strand-strand side chain contacts and hydrogen bonding form only after the rate-determining energy barrier. Sequence analysis of other iLBP family members suggests that early barrel closure is a conserved, topology-based mechanism by which iLBPs fold productively with minimal risk of aggregation.

Soluble A\u03b2 oligomers are believed to be neurotoxins and play causal roles in AD. One of these oligomeric forms, globulomer, has been prepared in vitro using synthetic A\u03b242. A\u03b242 globulomer binds in a punctuate distribution to neurons in an age-dependent fashion, suppresses spontaneous synaptic activity, and completely blocks long-term potentiation. Globulomer-specific antibody was shown to have immunoreactivity against the brain slices of AD patients and A\u03b242-overproducing transgenic mice. Characterization of the structure of globulomer is essential for understanding its toxic activity. Here, we used site-directed spin labeling and EPR spectroscopy to characterize the structure of A\u03b242 globulomer. We observed that spin-labeled globulomer mutants, with spin labels introduced at different residues across the full A\u03b242 sequence, have high structural flexibility. The EPR spectra show the presence of inter-molecular spinspin interaction at most labeled residues, suggesting that A\u03b242 globulomer adopts certain conformation to bring neighboring labeled sites into close contact. The effects of spin-spin interaction were alleviated by spin dilution experiments containing only 25% labeled proteins. Using EPR, morphology, and toxicity data, the structure and aggregation mechanism of globulomers are discussed. The work is supported by funding from the American Health Assistance Foundation.",

            "text": "Structural consequences of Ca2+ binding to Lin/ Notch12 Repeats and its implications for Notch signaling Jolene Schuster, Lauren Choi, Pengying Hao, Angie Seo, Didem Vardar-Ulu Chemistry Department, Wellesley College, 106 Central Street, Wellesely, MA, 02481 Notch receptors are multi-domain trans-membrane glycoproteins of the Notch signaling pathway that regulate cell growth, differentiation, and death in multicellular organisms. Deregulated Notch signaling has been linked to many human diseases such as sclerosis, arteriopathy, and leukemia. Normal Notch activation is initiated by a ligand-induced proteolytic cleavage of a metalloprotease site within the heterodimerization domain (HD) of the extracellular negative regulatory region (NRR). In the resting state, HD is ensconced by three tandem Lin12/Notch Repeats (LNRs) which serve to mask the protease site. LNRs are highly conserved, 35 amino acid protein motifs without substantial secondary structure or hydrophobic core. Their global folds are stabilized by the coordination of one Ca2+ ion via a group of Asp/Asn residues and the formation of three unique-pairs of disulfide bonds. The objective of this work is to understand the effect of Ca2+ binding on the structural integrity of LNRs and any further impact on LNR structure that may be essential for Notch signaling. Our studies have revealed three distinct roles of Ca2+ a) to facilitate correct disulfide bond formation required for LNR folding b) to protect LNRs against reduction c) to selectively reorganize the LNR surface. LNRs selectively bind Ca2+ with a KD of 10-30 \u00b5M as determined by Isothermal Titration Calorimetry and fluorescence spectroscopy. Ca2+ binding ensures the correct disulfide pattern within the LNRs and imparts a Ca2+ concentration-dependent redox responsiveness to this module as quantified by High Performance Liquid Chromatography-based assays we developed. Finally, Ca2+ induces alterations to the local structure and surface of LNRs that are reflected by substantial changes in various spectroscopic signatures of the intrinsic tryptophan residues. We repeated the experiments on both the first and second LNRs from human Notch1 to facilitate the generalization of our findings. Our results indicate that Ca2+ binding to the LNRs is essential for structural integrity, stability, and facilitation of intramolecular recognition within the NRR, necessary for the protection of the metalloprotease cleavage site against premature Notch activation. Protein function is inextricably linked to protein dynamics. In the case of molecular recognition, the ground state conformational ensemble of the protein ubiquitin possesses all conformers captured to date in crystal structures of ubiquitin bound to various partners (Lange et al, Science 2008 , 320, 1471 . These findings support the concept of conformational selection, specifically that amplitudes of motion or dynamics resulting from conformational inter-conversion on the \u00b5sec time-scale are limiting the on-rates for complex formation (Ban et al, Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2011, 50, 11437) . For ubiquitin, a majority of these conformational dynamics are concentrated in a single collective mode described by a pincer-like motion. As a consequence of this pincer-like motion, the ubiquitin conformational ensemble predicts a significant amount of correlated motions, which serve to alleviate the entropic costs associated with sampling conformers along the pincer-like trajectory. Fifteen years ago, Ken Dill and Hue Sun Chan challenged experimentalists to develop methodology for the potential detection of correlated motions within a protein (Dill and Chan, Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997, 4, 10) . Until now, the direct observation of long-range correlated motion has been hindered by the lack of experimental methodology. A technique suitable for the characterization of such dynamic processes is NMR spectroscopy. Here, we present a novel method to detect long-range correlated motions using cross-correlated relaxation (CCR) between pairs of backbone C\u03b1H\u03b1 bonds located on adjacent \u03b2-strands of the third immunoglobulin-binding domain of the streptococcal protein G (GB3). We report CCR rates for 4 pairs of C\u03b1H\u03b1 bonds, Q2-K19, K4-T17, V6-E15, and Y45-F52. The measured CCR rates show that all 4 C\u03b1H\u03b1 pairs engage in correlated motions. In order to complement our experimental results, we generated a conformational ensemble of GB3 utilizing previously measured residual dipolar couplings (RDC), which was cross-validated with backbone NH-NH and NH-C\u03b1H\u03b1 CCR rates and hydrogen bond scalar couplings. We show that our measured CCR rates are predicted by this GB3 ensemble. Taken together, we provide the first experimental evidence for long-range correlated motions. These findings demonstrate that the synchronized \u03b2-sheet motions reduce the degrees of freedom and contribute to the stability of the protein ensemble. Protein folding and molecular recognition are physiological processes that are intricately linked to their dynamic signature and reflected in their thermal coefficient. Additionally, the local conformational entropy is directly related to the degrees of freedom, which each residue possesses within its conformational space. Therefore, the temperature dependence of the local conformational entropy may provide insight into understanding how local dynamics may affect the stability of proteins. Here, we analyze the temperature dependence of internal methyl group dynamics derived from the cross-correlated relaxation between dipolar couplings of two CH bonds within ubiquitin. We also performed a titration with guanidinium chloride (GndCl) to observe the effects of this denaturant on ubiquitin methyl group dynamics. Spanning a temperature range from 275 K to 308 K, internal methyl group dynamics tend to increase with increasing temperature, which translates to a general increase in local conformational entropy. With this data measured over multiple temperatures, the thermal coefficient of the methyl group order parameter, the characteristic thermal coefficient, and the local heat capacity were obtained. By analyzing the distribution of methyl group thermal coefficients within ubiquitin, we found that the N-terminal region has relatively high thermostability. From the GndCl titration, two methyl groups, L8\u03b41 and L73\u03b41 appear to be early reporters of ubiquitin unfolding. These results indicate that methyl groups contribute quite appreciably to the total heat capacity of ubiquitin through the regulation of local conformational entropy. Furthermore, a per residue gauge of local protein thermodynamics, as well as local responses to the presence of denaturants, offers a powerful complement to the already well-established methods for determining global thermodynamic parameters in proteins.",

To investigate the mechanism of solubility enhancement by MBP, we have compared the properties of MBP fusion proteins refolded in vitro with those of the corresponding fusion proteins purified under native conditions. We selected 5 passenger proteins for these experiments with measurable activities that can be used to monitor their folding: glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (G3PDH), dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), green fluorescent protein (GFP), human dual specificity phosphatase 14 (DUSP14) and TEV protease. Using Gateway recombinational cloning, these passengers were fused to 3 different N-terminal tags: His6, His6-MBP and His6-GST. The 15 fusion proteins were purified under denaturing conditions by immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) on Talon resin and then refolded by rapid dilution. In all cases we recovered far more soluble MBP fusion protein than soluble GST-or His-tagged protein after refolding. Hence, we can reproduce the solubilizing activity of MBP in a simple in vitro system, indicating that no additional factors are required to mediate this effect. We assayed both the soluble fusion proteins and their TEV digestion products (i.e. N-terminal tag removed) for enzymatic activity (or fluorescence in the case of GFP). Little or no activity was detected for the G3PDH and DHFR fusion proteins, but the DUSP14, GFP and TEV protease fusion proteins were quite active. When the MBP fusion proteins were purified from E. coli under native (non-denaturing) conditions, substantial activity was detected for all of the passenger proteins. These results indicate that the ability of MBP to promote the solubility of its fusion partners in vitro sometimes, but not always, results in their proper folding under these circumstances. We conclude that some additional factor(s) must be involved in the folding of the G3PDH and DHFR fusion proteins in vivo. The folding and stability of H. halobium bacteriorhodopsin (bR) in mixed micelles continues to be one of the most valuable model systems for the investigation of the energetics of \u03b1-helical membrane protein folding. We recently found that the rate of bR folding is dependent on the total concentration of micelle components and that the folding of bR is substantially slower at a fixed micelle concentration than previous reports have suggested. Slow folding kinetics complicates the analysis of the folding and unfolding kinetics of bR in the transition zone, where the relaxation is slower than the hydrolysis of the retinal cofactor of bR. To facilitate the analysis of bR folding kinetics, we have devised a comprehensive kinetic analysis to determine the accurate folding and unfolding rate constants under conditions in which retinal is lost through hydrolysis. The results reveal intricate dependencies of the rate constants for folding and for unfolding on the mole fraction of SDS. We utilized this approach to investigate the effect of eight different point mutations on the conformational relaxation kinetics of bR. Contrary to that suggested by previous investigations, we find that these mutations principally do not affect the folding kinetics but instead alter the unfolding kinetics. Confident \u03c6-values could be determined for six bR variants with mutations in buried residues that span the length of helix B. The \u03c6-values of these residues are all close to zero, suggesting that the side chains do not participate in tertiary contacts in the rate-limiting transition state. Our results suggest that tertiary contacts in helix B are formed after the rate-limiting transition state. Our comprehensive analysis of the conformational relaxation kinetics of bR in mixed micelles provides invaluable information on the conformational energetics and the folding mechanism of \u03b1-helical membrane proteins.

But what would be the fitness effect of an aggregationinducing mutation(s) if the afflicted protein is placed under positive feedback regulation of its expression? Since aggregation rate increases exponentially with concentration, up-regulation of expression of the aggregation-prone proteins will, in fact, accelerate the aggregation process with possible further drop in activity, and, hence, fitness. We explore this question by generating E. coli's strains carrying aggregationinducing mutation(s) in the essential chromosomal folA gene encoding dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). DHFR expression is up-regulated in E. coli through tyrR transcription factor that binds to tyrR boxes located in the folA gene regulatory region. Most DHFR mutant strains carrying aggregation-inducing mutations exhibit a substantial decrease in the growth rates at 30oC, and near-lethal phenotype at elevated temperatures (37-42oC). Drop in fitness of DHFR mutant strains is associated with drop in activity and not toxicity, since DHFR is a low copy protein (app. 40 copies per cell). Deletion of the tyrR boxes from the regulatory region of folA gene in the chromosome resulted in 2-fold drop in the transcription level of the gene. Strikingly, such a drop in transcription resulted in a dramatic increase of the intracellular soluble abundance of mutant DHFR and, as a result, in an improved fitness (back to the wt level even at 42oC for some mutants). We show that aggregation and regulation of expression have a lostlasting effect on organismal fitness. When pre-incubated at 42oC for 4 hours prior to growth at 30oC, DHFR mutant strains \"remembered\" the exposure to high temperature by exhibiting low fitness characteristic of 42oC while being grown at 30oC. Remarkably, deletion of tyrR boxes erased the memory effect, rendering the pre-incubated at 42oC DHFR mutant strains as fit as same bacterial strains that did not undergo the 42oC preincubation. We developed an aggregation kinetic model that explains the observed fitness effects, including the fitness effect of pre-incubation.",

Their biochemical and structural characterization, however, is hindered by their very low abundance in native tissues. This problem can be overcome by heterologous expression in simple microbial organisms, such as the bacterium Escherichia coli. However, membrane protein overexpression in bacteria typically results in very small amounts of membrane-integrated protein. In the present work, we have identified genes that globally enhance the production of membrane-incorporated and properly folded GPCRs in E. coli. Libraries of bacterial chromosomal fragments were screened using two separate systems that monitor: (i) elevated fluorescence conferred by enhanced expression of GPCR fusions with the green fluorescent protein (GFP) and (ii) increased binding of fluorescently labelled ligand in cells producing more active receptor. A number of multi-copy genes that enhanced cell fluorescence were isolated by both expression screens. Co-expression of these genes resulted in an up to ten-fold increase in the yields of a variety of prokaryotic and eukaryotic membrane proteins. Our data is consistent with a hypothesis that the isolated enhancer genes may serve to maintain the integrity of the bacterial periplasm and to provide a favourable environment for proper membrane protein folding, possibly by inducing a fine-tuned stress response and/or via modifying the composition of the bacterial cell envelope.",

In healthy cells, it is found diffuse throughout the cell but translocates to the mitochondria upon apoptosis induction. Insertion of Bax into the outermitochondrial membrane is thought to form oligomeric pores, which leads to the permeabilization of the mitochondrial membrane and subsequent release of downstream effectors of apoptosis. While the solution NMR structure of Bax has identified it as a compact globular protein with 9 \u03b1-helices, its structure in the outermitochondrial membrane remains largely unknown. To quantify changes in Bax conformation upon membrane insertion, we utilized F\u00f6rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) between pairs of intra-molecular probes on Bax. Changes in FRET magnitude can be translated to changes in distances between Bax residues and used to construct the protein's conformation. FRET-pair probes were covalently attached to recombinant Bax in different locations and microinjected into MEF cells. Confocal microscopy was used to quantify changes in FRET before and after apoptosis induction and multichannel corrections enabled sensitive detection of FRET changes in different regions in Bax. This allowed us to identify the regions in Bax undergoing conformational changes upon membrane insertion. This work was supported by the NIH Intramural Research Programs of NHLBI.

Mouse TMEM16A(a) contains a total of nine cysteine residues in the predicted ectodomain (C370, C379, C382, C386, C395, C621, C626, C631, C832) and one (C357) in the C-terminal end of the first transmembrane helix, TM1. Inhibiting the formation of disulfides by incubating TMEM16A(a)-synthesizing Xenopus laevis oocytes with 10 mM DTT completely prevented the formation of TMEM16A(a) homodimers and the export of the TMEM16A(a) protein to the plasma membrane. Instead, the TMEM16A(a) subunits formed aggregates that were retained in the endoplasmic reticulum. The impact of individual ectodomain cysteine residues on homodimerization was assessed by studying cysteineto-alanine single mutants. In contrast to the wt TMEM16A(a) protein and two of the mutants, C357A and C631A, all the other eight ectodomain cysteine-toalanine single mutants contained a maleimide-reactive thiol. This suggests that eight of the ectodomain cysteine residues are normally engaged in the formation of four disulfide bonds. C357 in TM1 and C631 might remain unpaired because of their buried positions. Taken together, we conclude that the mature plasma membrane-bound TMEM16A(a) homodimer contains four disulfide bonds per subunit that are crucial for the correct non-covalent assembly of TMEM16A(a). However, for reasons that are unclear at present no such role in assembly could be assigned to any individual intrasubunit disulfide bond.",

            "text": "A Thermodynamic Definition of Protein Domains Lauren Porter 1, 2 , George Rose 2 1 Potomac Affinity Proteins, Institute for Bioscience and Biotechnology Research, 9600 Gudelsky Dr., Rockville, MD, 20850, 2 T.C. Jenkins Department of Biophysics, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD Protein domains are conspicuous structural units in globular proteins, and their identification has been a topic of intense biochemical interest dating back to the earliest crystal structures. Numerous disparate domain identification algorithms have been proposed, all involving some combination of visual intuition and/or structure-based decomposition. Instead, we present a rigorous, thermodynamically-based approach that redefines domains as cooperative chain segments. In greater detail, most small proteins fold with high cooperativity, meaning that the equilibrium population is dominated by completely folded and completely unfolded molecules, with a negligible subpopulation of partially folded intermediates. Here, we redefine structural domains in thermodynamic terms as cooperative folding units, based on m-values, which measure the cooperativity of a protein or its substructures. In our analysis, a domain is equated to a contiguous segment of the folded protein whose m-value is largely unaffected when that segment is excised from its parent structure. Defined in this way, a domain is a self-contained cooperative unit, i.e., its cooperativity depends primarily upon intrasegment interactions, not intersegment interactions. Implementing this concept computationally, the domains in a large representative set of proteins were identified; all exhibit consistency with experimental findings. Specifically, our domain divisions correspond to the experimentally-determined equilibrium folding intermediates in a set of nine proteins. The approach was also proofed against a representative set of 71 additional proteins, again with confirmatory results. Our reframed interpretation of a protein domain transforms an indeterminate structural phenomenon into a quantifiable molecular property grounded in solution thermodynamics. (PNAS, in press) The Gram-negative enterobacterium, Yersinia pestis, is the causative agent of bubonic plague, one of the most deadly diseases in recorded history. Although confirmed cases of plague are relatively infrequent at the present time, it remains a significant public health concern. Furthermore, there is also concern about the potential use of Y. pestis as a biological weapon. Y. pestis transports a number of virulent effector proteins across both bacterial membranes and the eukaryotic plasma membrane into the cytosol of eukaryotic cells via a type III secretion system (T3SS). The YscD protein is an essential component of the T3SS and consists of three domains: the N-terminal cytoplasmic domain, a transmembrane linker, and a periplasmic domain. Both the cytoplasmic and periplasmic domains are required for the assembly of the T3SS. Here, we present the threedimensional structure of the cytoplasmic YscD domain solved by X-ray crystallography at 2.04 \u00c5 resolution. Although the structure resembles those of fork-head associated (FHA) domains, comparison with other FHA domains reveals that YscD lacks the conserved residues required for phosphothreonine binding and is therefore unlikely to function as a canonical FHA domain. The application of the oxidative compounds to modulate the properties of various biomolecules can be found in a number of significant biological pathways, ranging from integral roles in enzymatic function to a vital element in pathogenic destruction by the innate immune system. While the potential of these oxidants to readily react with biomolecules and influence their physical and biological properties is commonly accepted, such understanding ends at the acceptance of incidental damage at reactive moieties. This incidental damage then via poorly understood mechanisms results in the commonly observed molecular dysfunction, aggregation and fragmentation. The focus of this work is to expand upon the fundamental understanding of the complex cascade initiate by an initial oxidative offense on a model protein system, adenylate kinase. This morphological cascade spans from the initial modification of reactive sidechains, which can quickly perturb structure and function, onto the whole-scale protein destruction. To this end, an array of spectroscopic techniques have been enlisted to parse this series of events which span a broad range of timescales and which serve to illustrate the benefit and necessity of drawing upon both coarse, low resolution techniques to examine gross changes to the protein as well as an initial foray into atomic resolution techniques to draw forth the discrete mechanistic details of progressive oxidative damage. An integral element of this work is found in the unique potential to leverage a computational design strategy, which previously has been successfully deployed in the synthesis of over 100 design variants of adenylate kinase alone. Through this computational strategy, the distribution and nature of the potential sites of oxidative damage can be manipulated while preserving the structural and functional features of the enzyme by incorporation of multiple compensatory mutations which would not be readily accessible by conventional mutagenic techniques. This work serves to expand the fundamental understanding of how oxidative damage bestows protein dysfunction and serves to further demonstrate the potential of computational design strategies to offer unique and viable solutions to elusive and challenging biological problems. The configurational landscape of proteins and other macromolecules contains distinct and possibly long lived states that differ minimally in their total free energy. However, the similarity in the respective total free free energy of these long lived states can mask drastic differences in their free energy profile, i.e. alternative balances of entropy and enthalpy. An accurate investigation of these differences requires an exhaustive search of the configurational space coupled with tools capable of elucidating the key interactions and correlations that govern the states and their associated transitions. Here we present an in depth analysis of a major conformational divide using the recently published Anton 1ms molecular dynamics (MD) trajectory of bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI) coupled with the mutual information expansion (MIE) of the configurational entropy. These results suggest a potential mechanism for significant entropyenthalpy compensation at a minor cost in the total free energy. IL-33 (an Interleukin-1 family member) has been identified as a key participant in immune and inflammatory responses. However, the structural homology between IL-33 and other members of the interleukin family are low-presenting unique sequence identity, unique receptor interactions, and potentially unique signaling mechanisms associated with its activity. The current, limited understanding of IL-33 is that it functions as an extracellular signaling factor. IL-33 lacks a typical N-terminal signaling sequence for transport through the ER and Golgi Apparatus. This lack of a signaling sequence categorizes IL-33 as a non-classically secreted protein, the mode of which is currently under investigation. We believe that Interleukin-33 is able to interact with lipid bi-layers as part of its secretory pathway. Previous work done on similar beta-trefoil motif proteins with non-classical secretion pathways (IL-1\u03b2) shows that there is indeed a membrane interaction with a significant portion of the trefoil structure. Additionally, work on other interleukins (IL-32) show membrane localization upon stimulation in epithelial cells4. Given Interleukin-33's role in heart protection, it is important to understand more fully the influence that structure has on its ability to signal effectively and how this signaling is facilitated by effective transport from the cell. We have shown that IL33 is potent in its lipid binding and are working to illuminate the structural details that enable this potent lipid interaction. Motivation and Aim: One of the current issues confronted by computational modeling science is validation of predicted protein models. Molecular mechanics and knowledge-based potentials are not absolute indicators of protein model quality. This paper describes validation of previously obtained structural models of pyrin, a protein implicated in the development of Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) and some other autoinflammatory diseases, based on their correspondence to available experimental data on pyrin multimerization, interaction with other proteins, and phosphorylation. Methods and Algorithms: Homotrimers of pyrin, as well as its complexes with Apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD (ASC) and caspase-1 proteins were constructed with ClusPro server. Reliability of docked complexes was validated based on the empirical cumulative distribution of cluster sizes using kernel smoothing density estimate. Structure based prediction of phosphorylation sites was performed with Phos3D web server. Results: Docking results with high significance indicate that pyrin forms a homotrimer through its coiled-coil domain. Interaction of pyrin with ASC through its PYD domain and with caspase-1 through its B30.2 domain appears among top five complexes obtained by docking. All these results are in good accordance with available experimental data. Phosphorylation site prediction results indicate that residues 208 and 242 are prone to phosphokinase-A mediated phosphorylation, whereas residue 209 is not susceptible to phosphorylation, thus showing good agreement with the study conducted by Jeru et al (2005) . Conclusions: Experiment-based validation of 3D structural model of pyrin points on its native-like structure and validity for using in further investigations focused on structural and functional features of pyrin in its native and mutated states. On the base of the results obtained, the described models may be considered as native-like structures of pyrin and used in studies related to elucidation of its role in FMF and other autoinflammatory diseases.

            "text": "Thermodynamic Properties of the Metamorphic Protein IscU John Markley 3, 4 IscU from E. coli, the scaffold protein for iron-sulfur cluster biosynthesis and transfer, has been shown to populate two conformational states that interconvert with lifetimes on the order of 1 s [1] . One state (S) is structured, and the other (D) is dynamically disordered, but both play functional roles [2] . The position of the D=S equilibrium can be determined by NMR spectroscopy from the relative intensities of signals from various residues assigned to the S-and D-states. We report here that human ISCU exhibits metamorphic [3] properties similar to E. coli IscU with the D=S equilibrium dependent on temperature and pH. The S-states of both human ISCU and E. coli IscU are maximally populated at 25 \u00b0C and pH 8. The S\u2192D conversion in both proteins is coupled to a protonation step between pH 6 and 7. At pH 8, both proteins shift toward the D-state at temperatures higher and lower than 25 \u00b0C. We describe the full Gibbs-Helmholtz stability curve analysis [4] of wild-type E. coli IscU and single amino acid variants that stabilize the S-state (N90A) or the D-state (K89A). This analysis demonstrated that the D=S equilibrium is two-state and yielded thermodynamic parameters \u0394H, \u0394S, and \u0394Cp (assumed temperature independent) for these variants. For wildtype IscU, \u0394G = -0.5 at the temperature of highest stability for the S-state (T s ); and \u0394G = 0 at 34 \u00b0C (T g ) and at 14 \u00b0C (T g\u2032 ). Two amino acid substitutions were found to abolish the two-state nature of the transition (P14A or P101A). Each of these substitutions removes one of the two residues found to undergo concerted peptidylprolyl trans to cis configuration change in going from the S-to the D-state [5] . Our thermodynamic analysis has revealed properties that underlie the way in which IscU has evolved to populate two conformational states with similar free energies that fulfill different functions. Conformational flexibility is an intrinsic property of proteins, often used by nature as a tool in regulation and enzyme activity. Proteins belonging to the superfamily of bacterial periplasmic receptors undergo an impressive closure motion upon ligand binding. The glucose-galactose binding protein (GGBP) and the ribose binding protein (RBP) have a high structural homology even though they only share a 27% of the sequence. Here, we show how NMR experiments, in combination with site directed mutagenesis, can be successfully applied to investigate the 'Venus flytrap mechanism' for these two proteins. Their NMR structures revealed very similar inter-domain orientations in solution. Accurate spin relaxation rates measured by NMR at several magnetic fields suggest that GGBP undergoes significant inter-domain motions in the nanosecond timescale. Interestingly, RBP does not show the same dynamic behaviour. Structural comparison between the hinge regions in the open and closed forms and for the two proteins showed that the major differences are concentrated in only two residues. A simple redesign, consisting on permuting the two amino acids in the proteins, resulted in the reintroduction of the inter-domain motions in RBP and the abrogation of the intrinsic dynamics in the GGBP mutant.

Matthew Gage Chemistry and Biochemistry, Northern Arizona University, PO Box 5698, Flagstaff, AZ, 86011 Titin, also known as connectin, functions as a molecular spring and is responsible for the passive elasticity in striated muscles. Titin contains a number of domains with the majority consisting of Ig-like and fibronectin domains. A deletion in this protein is shown to cause a disease similar to limb girdle muscular dystrophy in mice. This deletion stems between the last Ig-like domain in the N2A region in skeletal titin well into the PEVK region. If the stability of the mutated Ig-like domain is altered, it may affect the function of titin and give further insight into this disease. Size exclusion chromatography suggests that the mutant domain is not folding properly by eluding at a higher molecular weight than the larger native domain. An analysis of stability and structural changes of the mutant Ig domain in comparison to the native Ig domain is being performed using a combination of CD, fluorescence, and DSC experiments. These findings may help show how structural changes in domains of titin affect its function in relation to muscle elasticity as well as improving our understanding of the autosomal recessive disease, limb girdle muscular dystrophy.",

A major limitation to developing a comprehensive physicochemical model of the protein structuresequence relationship is the vastness of sequence space and the low-throughput nature of biophysical studies. We are pursuing two complementary avenues to understand parameters that control protein stability. We have developed high-throughput cell-based screens for activity for two model proteins, one a four-helix bundle and one a beta-sheet DNA binding domain. To collect quantitative stability data for large numbers of variants, we have developed a method of high-throughput hydrophobic dye binding called High-Throughput Thermal Scanning (HTTS) which can be applied using automation and a real-time PCR machine 96-wells at a time. Here we will present the results from libraries in the central core, entire core, loop and surface of the proteins. The surprising influence of non-core residues both on core packing and on protein stability directly will be discussed. In a second approach, we have used statistical analysis of protein families to understand better how stabilizing mutations can be predicted from sequence statistics. The role of conservation, correlation and hidden coupling at highly conserved sites will be discussed. This work was supported by NIH grant R01GM083114 to TJM and The Ohio State University. Epithelial cadherin (E-cadherin) belongs to type I cadherins, which are involved in calcium-dependent selective cell adhesion and play important roles in the formation and maintenance of tissues and organs. The molecular basis of cadherin function involves dimerization of between pairs of N-terminal extracellular domains presented from apposed cells. A dominant feature of the dimer interface is the exchange of the first \u03b2-strands between protomers. The present study provides the first NMR evidence that supports the formation of an intermediate, termed an \"X-dimer\" according to its shape, as a critical step in the dimerization pathway of E-cadherin. The K14E mutation that perturbs the intermediate state results in much slower binding kinetics and loss of function as measured by cell aggregation assay (Harrison OJ et al., Nature Struct. Mol. Biol. 2010, 17, 348-357.) . NMR data on the mutant is consistent with a decreasing or vanishing population of the \"X-dimer\" intermediate state. Overall, the data suggests the formation of an intermolecular intermediate state as a mechanism to lower the kinetic barrier associated with binding and strand swapping for E-cadherin.

Elements such as sample preparation and mobile phase selection must be carefully taken into account in order to formulate a reliable method that ensures both reproducibility and precision when analyzing thousands of protein variants. Alpha-amylases from two organisms, having substantially different amino acid sequences and expression levels, were analyzed on an Agilent 1200 Series HPLC system using two different methods: one with a 25mM sodium acetate mobile phase, and the other with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) in water. Although the sodium acetate method produces much better resolution due to the separation of lower molecular weight compounds that are present in the growth media, sodium acetate can also cause amylase precipitation to occur, which can lead to inaccurate protein determination. An additional issue with this method is relatively rapid column degradation, which causes peak shifting and broadening. The TFA method, on the other hand, produces sharper peaks and promotes column longevity. However, the growth media contaminants are not separated during this method, causing them to be included along the baseline with the amylase peak. This becomes more problematic with the lower-expressing proteins. The TFA method also produces shoulder peaks when the protein contains multiple cysteine residues, making peak integration much more difficult. Between the two methods, the sodium acetate method appears to have a higher efficiency than the TFA method for alphaamylase determination in a high-throughput setting.",

            "text": "Glucoamylase Activity of the Regulatory \u03b1 Subunit of Phosphorylase Kinase Owen Nadeau 1 Phosphorylase kinase (PhK), an (\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3\u03b4) 4 complex, phosphorylates glycogen phosphorylase and thereby stimulates the production of G-1-P from glycogen in liver and muscle. The protein kinase activity of the catalytic \u03b3 subunit is stimulated by signaling molecules from hormonal and metabolic pathways that target the large, homologous regulatory \u03b1 and \u03b2 subunits. Little is known about the structure of these subunits, which comprise 81% of PhK's mass. Although sequence comparisons of \u03b1 and \u03b2 indicate they are unique as intact proteins, several reports suggest both to be multi-domain structures that contain GH15-like glycoside hydrolase (GHL) domains. The GH15 family catalytic domains are characterized by a common (\u03b1/\u03b1) 6 fold comprising two glutamates that catalyze the breakdown of glycogen to release oligosaccharides and glucose. We recently reported that one or more of these GHL domains in the complex are catalytically competent, demonstrating that PhK directly hydrolyzes glycogen to form glucose and that this activity is inhibited by the known GH15 inhibitor, acarbose. In addition to inhibiting PhK's glycogen hydrolase activity, acarbose also stimulated the protein kinase activity of the \u03b3 subunit and perturbed the conformation of \u03b1 and \u03b2 in the complex. Glycogen also binds to PhK and stimulates the \u03b3 subunit, suggesting there may be common binding site(s) for acarbose and glycogen on the \u03b1 and/or \u03b2 subunits. To map potential glycogen binding sites in the complex, PhK was carboxymethylated with [ 3 H]iodoacetic acid \u00b1 glycogen. Although all four subunits were modified, glycogen protected only the \u03b1 subunit, suggesting that this subunit binds glycogen. To test whether \u03b1 contains a catalytically competent GH15 domain, a previously described \u03b1\u03b3\u03b4 subcomplex of PhK was incubated with glycogen and shown also to have glycoside hydrolase activity. Modeling of both the \u03b1 and \u03b2 GHL domains by us and others suggests that only the former GHL domain includes the full complement of catalytic residues required for glycoside hydrolysis. We show herein that both the intact PhK complex and the \u03b1\u03b3\u03b4 subcomplex generate glucose and larger oligosaccharide products with an activity approaching 10% of that observed with a typical GH15 fungal glucoamylase. These results suggest a potential role for the \u03b1 subunit in the direct hydrolysis of glycogen by PhK in vivo. (Supported by NIH Grant DK32953.) Titin, an approximately 3,000 kDa protein found in striated muscle, is made of multiple and repeating domains including; immunoglobulin (Ig) domains, fibronectin III (FN3) domains, N2A inserts, and an elastic PEVK region. While the domains have been identified, their purpose in muscle physiology is yet to be determined. For instance, the structure and function of the N2A region are poorly defined. Understanding the relationship between structure and function will shed new light on titin's role in muscle contraction. The N2A region consists of four Ig domains and a 117 amino acid unique sequence that has not been linked to any domain structures. Disorder prediction algorithms indicate that the N and C-termini of the unique region are disordered. The retention time for this protein on size exclusion chromatography is consistent with a larger protein, and therefore consistent with the algorithm's disorder prediction. Secondary structure predictions indicate that this region is predominantly alpha-helical. Initial circular dichroism (CD) studies are consistent with these predictions. However, no distinct transition between the folded and unfolded states is detected by CD, suggesting the protein is in an extended conformation. Based on these preliminary results, we propose that the unique sequence region of the N2A is composed of several alpha-helices that are associated in the center of this region and extended near the ends of the protein. As a better understanding of the structure/ function relationship of this region is developed, improved models of titin function can be made. Zhiping Jiang, Jennifer Lee National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, Room 3511, Bldg 50, Bethesda, MD, 20892 Most amyloids are pathological. Pmel17 is a human functional amyloid, promoting melanin deposition and possibly protecting cells from adverse effects of the reactive groups that comprise this important pigment. We recently showed that the repeat domain (RPT) of Pmel17 can form amyloid in vitro at mildly acidic pH (4.0 -6.0) typical of melanosomes, organelles where melanin is synthesized. The RPT primary amino acid sequence is comprised of 10 imperfect 13 residue repeats that are rich in Pro, Ser, Thr, and Glu. RPT contains 16 carboxylates underscoring its propensity to undergo pH induced conformational changes. In prior work, we have identified that the amyloid core is located at the C-terminus, which suggests that charge neutralization of at least one or more of the four C-terminal Glu residues are likely responsible for the pH dependent aggregation behavior. At neutral pH, these fibrils readily dissolve, establishing a highly reversible aggregation/disaggregation process that is in contrast to disease-related amyloids, which are notorious for resisting the harshest treatments. To delineate the role of specific Glu residues, we are studying the aggregation kinetics of Ala-and Gln-mutants to pinpoint essential protonation sites and to assess the role of hydrogen bonding in this highly pH dependent amyloid process. Substitution of all four residues E404, E422, E425, and E430 for glutamines greatly accelerates aggregation kinetics. Unlike wild-type, fibrils form at neutral pH. Interestingly, the quadruple Ala variant also aggregates quickly at mildly acidic pH; however its morphology is dramatically altered. Interactions between a membrane-bound protein (an insertase called Albino-3) and the cpSRP-LHCP (chloroplast signal recognition particle-light harvesting chlorophyll protein) complex have been examined to understand the molecular mechanism underlying the targeting and insertion of LHCP into the thylakoid membrane. The objective of this study is to establish whether C-term is disordered and to examine the possible role of the conformational disorder on the binding characteristics of C-term Alb3 to cpSRP-43. PONDR predictions show that C-term Alb3 is predominantly disordered. Interestingly, ab intio and empirical methods of modeling show C-term Alb3 to contain significant secondary structure. Biophysical studies, using recombinant C-term Alb3 show that the protein domain lacks regular secondary structural elements. Isothermal titration calorimetry experiments suggest that C-term Alb3 interacts with the 43kDa subunit of cpSRP. These results will be discussed in detail. I\u03baB\u03b1, the most abundant inhibitor protein of the NF\u03baB transcription factor, has six ankyrin repeats (ARs) in its AR domain: four well-folded ARs (repeats 1 through 4) and two weakly folded ARs (repeats 5 and 6). The AR 5-6 conformational flexibility is critical for regulating NF\u03baB signaling. Single-molecule FRET experiments probing the weakly folded region of I\u03baB\u03b1 demonstrated that the native state of the protein transiently populates an intrinsically disordered state characterized by a more extended structure and slow millisecondscale fluctuations. Systematic placement of FRET fluorophores along ARs revealed a sequential unfolding of the native state of I\u03baB\u03b1 that starts with the C-terminal AR 6 at room temperature, followed by AR 5 at 37 \u00b0C. Fluctuations in the intrinsically disordered AR 5-6 region correspond with the ability of I\u03baB\u03b1 to dissociate NF\u03baB from DNA transcription sites, and could provide the basis for new therapies to numerous diseases. Our previous studies have shown that IscU from Escherichia coli populates two distinct conformations that interchange with lifetimes on the order of one second. One conformation (S) is structured and one is dynamically disordered (D). The D-state serves as the substrate for the cysteine desulfurase, which generates sulfur by converting Cys to Ala and transfers S to Cys residues of IscU. The S-state is the conformation that binds the assembled cluster (Kim, J. H., Tonelli, M., and Markley, J. L. (2012) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 109, 454-459). Here we show that the S-state of IscU binds preferentially to HscB, the J-type co-chaperone, which targets the assembled cluster to HscA, the Hsp70type chaperone involved in cluster transfer. We further show that HscA, or HscA(ADP), binds and stabilizes the D-state of IscU. Addition of ATP to the HscA:IscU complex releases the D-state of IscU, which then resumes its equilibrium between the two states. The ATP-bound form of HscA appears not to bind either the S-or D-state of IscU. From these results, we conclude (1) that some event must trigger the hydrolysis of the ATP bound to HscA to initiate the interaction between HscA and IscU, and (2) that cluster transfer is coupled to the interaction between HscA and IscU, because the complex is incapable of binding the cluster. Our findings have been incorporated into a model for cluster transfer (see the figure attached) in which we speculate that attack of the cluster bound to IscU in its complex with HscB and HscA(ATP) serves as the trigger for initiating ATP hydrolysis and for conversion of IscU from the S-to the D-state, which binds to HscA(ADP). We have assigned the NMR signals of substrate binding domain (SBD) of HscA when it is complexed with IscU with the goal of obtaining a detailed picture of the IscU:HscA(SBD) complex.

Diseases such as cancer, heart disease, Alzheimer's disease, and AIDS can be attributed to the wayward regulation of NF\u03baB. The transcriptional activity of NF\u03baB is controlled by its inhibitor-I\u03baB. Two major isoforms of the inhibitor-I\u03baB\u03b1 and I\u03baB\u03b2-are structurally similar (i.e., crystal structures of the two exhibit a six ankyrin repeat domain followed by a largely unstructured, C-terminal PEST sequence), yet their inhibitory activities markedly differ. It has been shown that I\u03baB\u03b1 can actively \"strip\" NF\u03baB from DNA in vitro, but I\u03baB\u03b2 cannot. To probe the role of the I\u03baB PEST sequence in the regulation of NF\u03baB, we have constructed a panel of \"PEST swap\" mutants, tested the binding affinity of these mutants to NF\u03baB, and found that the binding affinity of either I\u03baB \"PEST swap\" mutant is approximately one thousandfold weaker than its respective wild type. The role of individual residues within the I\u03baB\u03b1 PEST sequence in the \"stripping\" phenomenon is also being analyzed, and these \"stripping\" experiments will show the importance of the PEST domain in the I\u03baB-NF\u03baB interaction. Protein kinases have a conserved catalytic core but have variable N-and C-terminal extensions that regulate their activity. In most AGC-family kinases, a floppy C-terminal tail allosterically activates the kinase activity through binding to a hydrophobic motif site on the N-lobe. Protein Kinase A (PKA) is perhaps the beststudied AGC kinase and is an excellent model system due to the plethora of experimental data available, including NMR. The rate-limiting step in the kinase catalytic cycle is product release. NMR relaxationdispersion experiments suggested that the active site opening part of product release was rate-limiting, based on relaxation-dispersion experiments that found slow motions on the same millisecond timescale involving a number of residues in the N-and C-lobes. As pre-steadystate kinetics have shown the chemical step to be quite fast, we wondered why PKA's activity is rate-limited by slow dynamics. To study the slow dynamics in PKA's catalytic cycle at an atomistic level, we performed long 5\u03bcs MD simulations of PKA using the Anton supercomputer, starting from apo, ATP-bound open, and ATP-bound closed conformations of the kinase. These simulations are shorter than the slow motions measured by NMR, they enabled us to see dynamics that were not rate-limiting. We found that from the simulation of the open form, active site closing was faster than expected based on the NMR-suggested 100s-1 because excursions to the closed form were only transient and not maintained, due to the fact that the C-terminal tail was disordered. We find the C-terminal tail to be entropically frustrated because there are many conformations it can take in the open form, but only one conformation it takes in the closed form. We hypothesized that motion of the C-terminal tail would be sufficient to promote active site opening, and found using a pulling simulation that starting from the closed form and lifting the C-tail and then restraining it in an open-like conformation allowed the active site to open, while a similar pulling simulation lifting instead the Gly-rich loop caused the kinase to buckle. Furthermore, we apply our previously-reported MutInf method to identify correlated motions coupling important regions of the kinase. This study highlights the use of slow order-disorder transitions in regulating enzyme kinetics and should shed insight on how other AGC-family kinases are regulated. Apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) plays important structural and functional roles in plasma high-density lipoprotein (HDL) that is responsible for reverse cholesterol transport. However, a molecular understanding of HDL assembly and function remains enigmatic. The 2.2\u00c5 crystal structure of \u0394(185-243)apoA-I reported here shows that it forms a half circle dimer. The backbone of the dimer consists of two elongated antiparallel prolinekinked helices (5 AB tandem repeats). The N-terminal domain of each molecule forms a four-helix bundle with the helical C-terminal region of the symmetry related partner. The central region forms a flexible domain with two antiparallel helices connecting the bundles at each end. The two-domain, dimer structure based on helical repeats suggests the role of apoA-I in the formation of discoidal HDL particles. Furthermore, the structure suggests the possible interaction with lecithincholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT), and may shed light on the molecular details of the effect of the Milano, Paris and Fin mutations.",

We used chemical synthesis to prepare a series of analogues of \u03b22m in which Pro32 residue was systematically substituted with several analogues, including 4-(R)fluoroproline (fpr), 4-(S)-fluoroproline (Fpr), \u03b1-methylproline (Mpr) and D-proline (Dpr), which have different propensities to adopt either a cis or trans conformation of the prolyl amide bond. We find that such substitutions indeed affect cis-to-trans populations of conformers when inserted into the \u03b22-microglobulin polypeptide chain, and the resulting molecules exhibit different tendencies to aggregate with a gradually increasing trend Pro \u2248 fpr < Fpr < Mpr < Dpr. Thus, our data confirm the hypothesis that amide bond isomerization of Pro32 plays a key role in this process. The effects of Pro32 substitutions on the early stages of protein aggregation by unnatural amino acids as well as structural features of the chemically synthesized proteins will be presented.",

It exists as a homo-tetramer in solution. The homologous TDH from Grimontia hollisae (Gh-TDH) shows 87% similarity to Vp-TDH, but displays a distinct interface structure between protomers than that of Vp-TDH. Notably, the Gh-TDH and equinatoxin II from sea anemone exhibit a highly structural similarity and interact with the lipid membrane via specific regions. In this study, we describe identification and characterization of critical residues involved in the hemolytic activity, membrane binding and quarternary structure. Interestingly, no hemolytic activity and cytotoxicity were observed from the Gh-TDHY87A and Gh-TDHY87A/Y107A mutants, which are different from Gh-TDH wild-type (Gh-TDHWT) protein. On the other hand, the protomer-interface related Gh-TDHY53D and Gh-TDHF159D mutants formed dimer conformation, as observed from the Native-PAGE. Furthermore, the Gh-TDHY53D and Gh-TDHF159D mutants exhibited slightly lower hemolytic activity as compared to that of Gh-TDHWT. Thus, the Gh-TDH proteins might form dimer-based tetramer and display variant extent of hemolytic activities, depending on different conformational structures. In summary, the Y87 and Y107 residues might play a role participating in the protein-membranes binding while both the Y53 and F159 show their importance in directing protein quaternary structure formation. Other residues, critical for the TDH structure as well as the interactions between TDH and lipid membrane, will also be discussed. Activity of the de-ubiquitinating enzyme USP7 is pivotal in regulating the stability of the E3 ligase MDM2 and the proto-oncogene p53. Previous research has also demonstrated the function of USP7 in signaling pathways involving cell cycle and mitosis through PTEN, and cell death and survival through Claspin/ Chk1. Given the significance of USP7 in these pathways, it is surprising that little is known about the regulatory mechanisms of USP7 itself and the regulatory activity of the seven structural domains of USP7: a N-terminal TRAF domain, a catalytic ubiquitin cleaving domain and five C-terminal Ubiquitin-Like (UBL) domains. In this work we present biochemical data on the UBLregulated activity of USP7 against mono-ubiquitin and K11-, K48-and K63-linked di-ubiquitin. We also show cellular data describing the the ubiquitin linkages on the USP7 substrate MDM2. Further, using isolated ubiquitinated substrate, both the USP7 -TRAF and UBL domains are shown to be essential for substrate targeting. To support this hypothesis, a novel crystal structure of the USP7 catalytic domain, together with several regulatory domains is shown. This structural model allows synergistic interactions of both the TRAF and the UBL domains in substrate recognition and supports the biochemical data for linkage independent recognition of ubiquitinated substrate. In addition the model provides insight into the function of the USP7 C-terminus in the regulation of USP7 enzymatic activity. Our findings demonstrate essential regulatory functions for the non-catalytic domains of USP7 that will have implications in both cancer development and infectious disease. Most cellular responses to extracellular stimuli have a common component of regulation arising from selective recruitment of a network of signalling complexes to membranes. However, studying these systems remains a daunting task. We have made unprecedented progress in understanding these systems by applying a synthesis of deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (DXMS), X-ray crystallography and FRET spectroscopy. Our application of this synthesis to phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signalling represents one of the largest (> 200 kDa) complexes studied using DXMS, and elucidates novel aspects of PI3K regulation as well as a unifying mechanism of how diverse oncogenic PI3K mutants upregulate activity. DXMS provides information on the conformation and solvent accessibility of protein amide hydrogens, and has become a powerful tool for analysing protein dynamics in complex assemblies. PI3Ks are lipid kinases that are involved in a variety of cellular functions, including growth, proliferation, differentiation, migration, and metabolism. In their basal inactivated state they are maintained in the cytosol. They can be activated by recruitment to the membrane surface via binding membrane bound activators such as receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and Ras. The importance of regulating PI3K activity is highlighted by the fact that the PI3K p110\u03b1 catalytic subunit (PIK3CA) is one of the most frequently mutated genes in cancer. Activating mutations exist in every domain, with many distant from the active site and/or membrane binding site. Using DXMS we have examined the activation of wildtype p110\u03b1/p85\u03b1 and a spectrum of oncogenic mutants in three enzyme states: basal, RTK phosphopeptide activated, and membrane bound. Differences in amide exchange rates upon activation show that for wild-type p110\u03b1/p85\u03b1 the natural transition from an inactive cytosolic conformation to an activated form on membranes entails four distinct conformational events. DXMS results for cancer mutants show that all upregulate the enzyme by enhancing one or more of these dynamic events. Protein-lipid FRET and lipid kinase assays showed that all mutations increased binding to membranes and basal lipid kinase activity, even mutations distant from the membrane surface. Our results elucidate a unifying mechanism in which diverse PIK3CA mutations stimulate lipid kinase activity by facilitating motions required for catalysis on membranes.

The mechanisms of IAPP-induced toxicity are not known and the nature of the toxic species is controversial. We show that the toxic species are transient, soluble, pre-fibrillar oligomers with no significant beta sheet content. Altering the time course of amyloid formation by mutation, the use of amyloid inhibitors or changes in solution conditions reveals a correlation between the rate of amyloid formation and duration of toxicity; suggesting that toxic intermediates are \"on-pathway\". The toxic intermediates up-regulate MCP-1 and IL-1beta mRNA and are ligands of the receptor for advanced glycation endproducts (RAGE). Soluble RAGE is an inhibitor of IAPP amyloid formation and of toxicity to beta cells, pancreatic islets and smooth muscle cells. Deleting RAGE or blocking RAGE-IAPP interactions protects cells from toxicity. The findings are consistent with a RAGE-mediated mechanism of IAPP toxicity and have implications for the treatment of diabetes.",

Importantly, autopsy studies of GD patients and carriers with synucleinopathies reveal the presence of mutant GCase in \u03b1-synuclein(\u03b1-syn)-rich Lewy bodies, pathological hallmarks of Parkinson disease (PD). While these studies have provided strong correlations to PD suggesting a potential relationship between \u03b1-syn and GCase, the molecular mechanisms for disease association remain elusive. In prior work, we identified that \u03b1-syn and GCase interact selectively under lysosomal solution conditions and mapped the interaction site to the \u03b1-syn C-terminal residues, 118-137. Immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence studies verified this interaction in patient brain samples and neuronal cell culture, respectively. Because the lysosome plays an important role in protein degradation, this newly identified interaction between \u03b1-syn and GCase can potentially influence \u03b1-syn homeostasis in neurons. Currently, we are studying how membranes modulate this interaction since the substrate for GCase is found in intra-lysosomal vesicles. We are using small unilamellar vesicles as membrane mimics and site-specific fluorescence and F\u00f6rster energy transfer probes to map protein-enzyme interaction. The \u03b1-syn-GCase complex forms with comparable affinity in the presence of vesicles as in buffer solution. However, our data suggest that the interaction site on the membrane surface comprises a much larger \u03b1-syn region beyond its C-terminus. Lastly, we have examined GCase enzymatic activity in the presence of \u03b1-syn. \u03b1-Syn inhibits GCase activity with an apparent IC50 in the submicromolar range; it is a mixed inhibitor, where \u03b1-syn can bind either to the free enzyme or the enzyme-substrate complex. The estrogen receptor alpha (ER-a) regulates expression of target genes implicated in development, metabolism, and breast cancer. Calcium-dependent regulation of ER-a is critical for activating gene expression and is controlled by calmodulin (CaM). Although much is known about the structures of ER-a and CaM, the structural mechanism of how CaM activates ER-a was not known. By using Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) and other biophysical techniques (e.g. Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC), etc), here we present the NMR structures for the two lobes of CaM each bound to a localized region in ER-a (residues 287-305). A model of the complete CaM/ER-a complex was constructed by combining these 2 structures with additional data. The two lobes of CaM both bind at the same site on ER-a (residues 292, 296, 299, 302 and 303), which explains why full-length CaM binds two molecules of ER-a in a 1:2 complex and stabilizes ER-a dimerization. Exposed glutamate residues in CaM (E11, E14, E84, E87) form salt bridges with key lysine residues in ER-a (K299, K302 and K303), which is likely to prevent ubiquitination at these sites and inhibit degradation of ER-a. Mutants of ER-a at the CaM binding site (W292A and K299A) weaken binding to CaM, and I298E/K299D disrupts estrogen-induced transcription. We conclude that CaM facilitates dimerization of ER-a in the absence of estrogen, and stimulation of ER-a by either Ca2+ and/or estrogen may serve to regulate transcription in a combinatorial fashion. Figure 1 . Structural model of CaM bound to dimeric ER-a (residues 287-552). The main chain structure of CaM/ER-a(287 -552) complex was generated using the determined NMR structures of two lobes each bound to a localized region in ER-a (residues 287-305) attached to the dimeric LBD crystal structure (residues 305 -552; PDB code: 1A52). One polypeptide chain of ER-a dimer (orange) is bound to the CaM N-lobe (CaMN, cyan) and the other ER-a chain (white) is bound to the CaM C-lobe (CaMC, magenta). E2 is bound to the dimeric LBD (green), Ca2+ is bound to CaM (yellow) and the dotted line (white) represents the flexible loop between two lobes.

Paik School of Chemical and Biological Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, Republic of Korea \u03b1-Synuclein is main component of Lewy bodies (LBs), abnormal protein aggregates known as the pathological hallmark of Parkinson's disease. Recently, glutathione peroxidase (GPx), cellular antioxidative defense system removing reactive oxygen species, was reported to be co-localized with \u03b1-synuclein in LBs. By employing a coupling GPx assay, the enzyme was shown to be stimulated by \u03b1-synuclein via the molecular complex formation. Dissociation constant obtained with a double-reciprocal plot of the stimulated GPx activity in the presence of \u03b1-synuclein was 17.3 nM. This interaction was further confirmed using in vitro coimmunoprecipitation and immunocytochemical analysis with neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. Since GPx was found to exist in \u03b1-synuclein-enriched LBs, we investigated GPx effect on the fibrillation of \u03b1-synuclein. GPx not only accelerated the fibrillation kinetics of \u03b1-synuclein by shortening lag phase, but also increased overall quantity of the final fibrillar products. This acceleration of \u03b1-synuclein fibrillation was demonstrated to be dependent upon GPx activity. Transmission electron microscopic analysis of the immunogold stained fibrils revealed that the GPx molecules were entrapped in clusters within \u03b1-synuclein fibrils. In addition, the GPx was shown to be slowly released from fibrils in active form. Our data suggest novel physiological functions of \u03b1-synuclein as an activator of GPx and the \u03b1-synuclein fibrils as a functional depot for the active GPx. This gives us new insight into physiological roles of \u03b1-synuclein in cellular antioxidative defense system.",

The SAP genes of pathogenic Candida spp. encode pre-pro-enzymes. The signal peptide is removed in the rough endoplasmic reticulum, the zymogen is activated in the Golgi apparatus, and mature protease is transported via the secretory pathway to the cell surface and has to pass through the protective cell wall. It has been assumed that Saps hydrolyze host proteins after their release. To study the final stage of protease passage through the cell wall, we focused on Sapp1p protease secreted by Candida parapsilosis and performed labeling of cell wall proteins with biotin followed by analysis of extracted cell wall proteins by mass spectroscopy. We also examined proteolytic activity of cell-wall associated Sapp1p. We found that Sapp1p displays enzyme activity prior to secretion, which indicates that protease is properly folded within the upper layer of the cell wall. Analysis of biotinylated Sapp1p revealed that the protease has a preferred orientation in the cell wall and a sufficient population of Sapp1p molecules has the active sites accessible to external substrates. The ability of yeast cells to retain active Sap molecules in the cell wall before their secretion into extracellular space might provide a great benefit for pathogenic Candida spp., mostly during biofilm formation, but also during adhesion and colonization of host tissues. Over 20% of European population suffers from respiratory allergies. Many factors can cause these immune dysfunctions, which can be classified into three categories: -Internal environmental factors, which refer to all potential allergens inhaled indoors: dust mites, molds, cat fur dog fur etc. -External environmental factors, which refer to all potential allergens inhaled outdoors: pollens, molds. -Factors of air pollution: there is a triangular relationship between pollution, pollen and allergy. Pollution can affect pollens by changing their external biochemical structure and thus their allergenicity, but also the human respiratory mucosa by changing its immunological sensitivity to pollen particles. Pollen grains contribute to the development of the vegetation by ensuring oxygen regeneration and playing a vital role in food. However, 10 to 20% of the population suffers from allergenic rhinitis, conjunctivitis or asthma, caused by the pollens. The increase of this kind of allergy, which would have doubled in 10 years, justifies the control of air quality. As a proof of concept, we focused on birch pollen which proteins are known to be strongly allergenic. Birch pollen allergen was detected in real-time by Surface Plasmon Resonance Imaging (SPRi). Owing to this optical technique, the interaction between birch pollen allergen and an antibody directed against this allergen was monitored. From a calibration curve, the quantity of allergen in one pollen grain was determined and compared to results obtained in ELISA by J. Buters et al [1] , [2] . Then, the affinity of the interaction was calculated from the kinetic curves. The aim of the next experiments will be to take full advantage of the SPRi multiplex interaction performance to detect and identify multiple pollens allergen on the same microarray.",

Mutations in the GCase gene are associated with Gaucher disease (GD), the most common of the lysosomal storage disorders. Surprisingly, patients with Parkinson disease (PD) are over five times more likely to have a mutation in the gene encoding GCase, rendering it the most common known genetic risk factor for PD. Parkinson pathology is commonly associated with Lewy bodies, proteinaceous inclusions composed primarily of \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1-syn), a protein that is also genetically linked to familial PD. In our prior work, we established that \u03b1-syn and GCase interact under the acidic conditions found in the lysosome and mapped the binding site to residues 118-137 in the C-terminal region of \u03b1-syn by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. We have since explored the effect of \u03b1-syn on GCase activity. While \u03b1-syn is inhibitory, the addition of sap C rescues activity. To test whether sap C displaces \u03b1-syn from GCase, we measured the NMR spectrum with all three proteins present in solution. Unexpectedly, both sap C and \u03b1-syn bind GCase simultaneously, though the \u03b1-syn binding site is reduced to residues 125-137. Since the large size of GCase (~60 kD) precludes standard NMR perturbation techniques, we are employing Saturation Transfer NMR spectroscopy and perdeuterated sap C to identify sap C residues at the interaction interface in order to elucidate the mechanism by which sap C facilitates GCase activity.

About 20% of familial ALS cases are attributed to mutations in the gene SOD1 that encodes the copper/zinc superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1). Disease-Specific-Epitope 2 (DSE2), corresponding to residues 125-142 of SOD1, is normally buried in native WT SOD1 but accessible to the immune system in the misfolded isoform. The monoclonal antibody 3H1 IgG was developed against the DSE2. It recognizes only misfolded SOD1 but not native WT SOD1 [1] . The G85R mutant of SOD1 exhibits a template-directedmisfolding activity to wtSOD1, a crucial feature of prion disease. WtSOD1, upon contact with G85R, becomes misfolded and is recognized by 3H1 IgG [1] . To study the binding between DSE2 and 3H1 IgG, co-crystallizations of the antibody with both the epitope peptide and fulllength G85R were performed. 3H1 IgG was digested by papain to obtain the Fab fragment. 3H1 Fab's antigen binding ability was compared to that of intact IgG using competitive ELISA techniques. Pure 3H1 Fab was then mixed with 1 mM epitope peptide (residues 132 to 138 of DSE2) and was screened for crystallization hits. Platelike crystals were observed that diffracted X-rays to a resolution of 4 \u00c5 on a rotating anode source. Refinement of the crystallization conditions is underway to produce well diffracting crystals that can reveal the structure of the DSE2 peptide-3H1 antibody complex. The G85R mutant of SOD1 was produced using an E. coli protein expression system. Through competitive ELISA, it was confirmed that purified G85R was recognized by 3H1 IgG. Its metal-binding ability was compared to that of wtSOD1. The G85R mutant binds copper as tightly as wtSOD1 but its zinc binding was decreased by 58%. This is consistent with a crystallization study done by Cao et al [2] : Three individually grown G85R crystals showed significant absence of metal at the Zn binding site. The presence of zinc was seen as critical to the ordering of the \"electrostatic loop\", which includes DSE2. This could mean that the recognition of DSE2 by the monoclonal antibody 3H1 might be dependent on the presence of zinc at the Zn-binding site. Remetallation of G85R experiments are ongoing to test if antibody recognition is metal dependent. [1] . Leslie I. The large and growing body of experimental data on biomolecular binding is of enormous value in developing a deeper understanding of molecular biology, in developing new therapeutics, and in various molecular design applications. However, most of these data are found only in the published literature and are therefore difficult to access and use. BindingDB is a public web-accessible database of measured binding affinities for various molecular types. The BindingDB allows queries based upon a range of criteria, including chemical similarity or substructure, sequence homology, numerical criteria and reactant names.

Their amino acid and tRNA specificity are crucial for correctly translating the genetic code. Glycine is the smallest amino acid and the glycyl-tRNA synthetase (GlyRS) belongs to Class II AARSs. The enzyme is unusual because it can assume different quaternary structures. In eukaryotes, archaebacteria and some bacteria, it forms an \u03b12 homodimer. In some bacteria, GlyRS is an \u03b12\u03b22 heterotetramer and shows a distant similarity to \u03b12 GlyRSs. The human pathogen eubacterium Campylobacter jejuni GlyRS (CjGlyRS) is an \u03b12\u03b22 heterotetramer and is similar to Escherichia coli GlyRS; both are members of Class IIc AARSs. The two-step aminoacylation reaction of tetrameric GlyRSs requires the involvement of both \u03b1-and \u03b2-subunits. At present, the structure of the GlyRS \u03b12\u03b22 class and the details of the enzymatic mechanism of this enzyme remain unknown.",

These structures provide detailed information on substrate binding and show evidence for a proposed mechanism for amino acid activation and the formation of the Acceleration of genome sequencing and high-throughput determination of the 3D structures of gene products bring promise for new approaches to the diagnosis and treatment of disease. In order to realize this potential, the next step is to understand the biochemical functions of the newly determined structures of these gene products. To address this important and timely problem, a new approach is presented based on functional residue prediction with Partial Order Optimum Likelihood (POOL), using chemical and electrostatic input from THEMATICS, geometric data from ConCavity, and phylogenetic information. POOL has been shown to predict functional residues with high recall and specificity, and is now extended to prediction of biochemical function. Predicted functionally important residues for a protein of unknown function are structurally aligned with those of proteins with well characterized functions. These Structurally Aligned Local Sites of Activity (SALSAs) show spatial patterns that are characteristic of biochemical function. A 3D structure match at the predicted, local functional site then serves as a more reliable predictor of biochemical function than an overall structure match. The method is validated with sets of well-characterized proteins with similar 3D structures but different functions, including the ribulose phosphate binding barrel (RPBB), six hairpin glycosidase, and ClpP/crotonase superfamilies, and the enzymes with the concanavalin A-like lectins/glucanases fold. Then, the SG members of these superfamilies, whose functions are unknown or uncertain, are analyzed by POOL and SALSA. Selected examples from structural genomics are shown, including instances of correct and incorrect annotation. We find that for the SG members of the RPBB superfamily, most of the putative annotations are likely to be correct. However, for SG members of the ClpP/crotonase superfamily, over 60% of the putative annotations are very likely incorrect. In one particular example, the SALSA prediction was different from those made by standard bioinformatics methods, specifically 3D structure matching and sequencebased phylogenetic analysis; direct biochemical assays proved that the SALSA prediction is correct. Some additional examples with experimental verification of predicted function are given. This work is supported by the National Science Foundation under grants MCB-0843603 and MCB-1158176.",

Dystrophin interacts with F-actin using its N-terminal actin binding domain (N-ABD), which is a tandem repeat of calponin-homology (CH) domains. Previous X-ray structure indicated that the N-ABD is a domain-swapped dimer, with each monomer in an 'open' conformation in which the two CH domains do not interact. Here we investigated the conformation of dystrophin N-ABD in solution using pyrene excimer fluorescence. Pyrene-labeled single cysteine mutants did not show excimer fluorescence indicating the absence of either parallel or anti-parallel dimers. Pyrenelabeled wild-type protein showed excimer fluorescence indicating that the two native cysteines are close in space which is only possible if dystrophin N-ABD exists in a 'closed' conformation with significant interactions between the two CH domains. Upon binding to F-actin, excimer fluorescence increased indicating that this domain transitions to a more compact closed conformation. This study demonstrates for the first time the conformational transition of a dystrophin domain during its function, and suggests that such structural dynamics might play an important role in controlling dystrophin function. In the current project, we used relaxation dispersion and titration experiments to investigate glycan recognition by OAA, a cyanobacterial lectin with potent anti-HIV activity. CPMG relaxation dispersion experiments indicate that in the glycan-free OAA, lowly populated states are present. Fitting the dispersion curves at 277 K to a simple two-state model yields a chemical exchange rate of 922 \u00b1 44 s-1 between the major state and an alternative state, populated at 2% \u00b1 1%. Comparing the chemical shift differences derived from this CPMG relaxation dispersion with those derived from titration experiment with the glycan, suggests that the alternative conformations adopted in the absence of sugar may not resemble the sugar-bound state. Our current data represent the first steps in a detailed characterization of OAA dynamics, aimed at understanding its function.",

The diverse substrate recognition modes of HAD proteins are of the particular interest in understanding their evolutionary expansion. Among the 17 putative HAD members from Thermococcus onnurineus NA1, HAD56 was identified as a phosphatase with a substrate preference for 6-phosphogluconate. The crystal structures were determined in free state and in complex with a magnesium ion or a ligand. From the conservation of the catalytic scaffold of HAD superfamily in the core domain and the analyses of the ligand-binding cavity, HAD56 was proposed as a sugar or nucleotide phosphatase. The complex structures with 6-phosphogluconate or glucose-6-phosphate are marked by the rotation of the aromatic ring of Trp58 in the cap domain to sandwich the ligand between Trp58 and Trp61, and the replacement of these Trp residues reduced the phosphatase activity, thus confirming their roles in substrate recognition. Prion diseases are a class of transmissible neurodegenerative diseases, caused by an infectious protein, that afflict humans and other mammals. The infectious agent is a host encoded protein known as PrP that has adopted a misfolded conformation termed PrP Sc . The diseases have been shown to manifest by 3 different pathologic processes including sporadic/spontaneous, genetic, and infectious. In addition to genetic origin of prion disease, differences in the prion gene (PRNP) have been shown to influence incubation time and in some cases confer near absolute resistance in instances of infectious transmission. Despite the protein only nature of the infectious agent, the various prion diseases exist in many different strains, which depending upon the strain, can be differentiated by tissue distribution, brain lesion profiles, as well as glycoform analysis and molecular weight profile using western blot. In rodent adapted models, prion strains have also been shown to confer differences in the stability of PrP Sc as determined using GdmCl denaturation. In addition, PrP Sc stability has been shown to correlate well with incubation time such that the shortest incubation times result from the least stable prion strains. In natural host species, a priori predictions of incubation time based upon an in vitro assay are relevant for studies of pathogenesis and holds practical implications for disease management. Toward this goal, we assess the stability of PrP Sc derived from age matched Holstein steers inoculated with 3 different strains of Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) (H-type, L-type, and classical) as well as Transmissible Mink Encephalopathy (TME).* Each BSE strain is differentiable using glycoform analysis and molecular weight profile on a western blot, and the observed incubation time for TME, H-type BSE, and L-type BSE is considerably shorter than that for classical BSE. Preliminary PrP Sc stability measurements do not correlate with incubation time implicating a mechanism for the differences in incubation time not derived from fibril stability. *All work was performed with the approval of the institutional review board of the sponsoring institution.",

Different strains of TSEs cause different brain lesion and PrP Sc accumulation profiles, as well as different incubation times, upon inoculation into a mouse host. Based on the \"protein only\" model for TSEs, the unique properties of each strain are \"encoded\" in PrP Sc higher-order structure, even if the primary structure is the same in each case. One method of probing PrP Sc structural differences is treatment with guanidinium chloride (GdmCl). When the level of PrP Sc remaining is plotted as a function of [GdmCl] , the [GdmCl] 1/2 , or the concentration at which half of the PrP Sc has been denatured, is used as a measure of strain stability. Previous work has demonstrated a tight correlation between the [GdmCl] 1/2 of a strain and its incubation time in mice. Here, we employ a commercial ELISA-based assay to examine the stability of PrP Sc from TSE-infected livestock, including scrapieinfected sheep and chronic wasting disease-infected elk. We retrospectively examine correlations between host genotype, incubation time, and PrP Sc stability of strains in the U.S. livestock population.* In sheep, we examine the impact of the host genotype at PRNP codon 136, a known scrapie susceptibility locus, on host susceptibility to different scrapie strains, including a fastacting scrapie isolate called 136-VDEP. We observe a correlation between incubation time and strain stability, and determine that the residue present at codon 136 does not inherently affect stability of PrP Sc aggregates. We demonstrate the use of the stability assay as a means of tracking the presence of different scrapie strains through the process of stabilization in a livestock host. In elk, we observe correlations between the genotype at elk PRNP codon 132 (a known susceptibility locus, also important in human infection), CWD incubation time, and PrP Sc stability. Finally, we compare the results of the stability measurements on elk PrP Sc to structural differences probed by the protease cleavage pattern of PrP Sc and describe an effect of the method of brain tissue homogenization on these results. *All work was performed with the approval of the institutional review board of the sponsoring institution. Nitric oxide (NO) signaling pathways play important roles in blood pressure regulation, platelet aggregation, and angiogenesis. Dysfunction of NO signaling has been linked to cardiovascular disease, inhibition of cell proliferation and migration, and problems with wound healing. NO is an activator of the heterodimeric enzyme soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC) through binding to the ferrous heme. sGC is also directly regulated by CD47, thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1), and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR2). Binding partners of integrin associated protein CD47 include \u03b1v\u03b23 and VEGFR2. A C-terminal fragment of trimeric matricellular protein TSP-1, called E3CaG1, was shown to downregulate sGC by inhibiting NO signaling through an increase in Ca2+. TSP-1 is also known to abolish the interaction between CD47 and VEGFR2, thereby providing an anti-angiogenic effect. Although there is evidence suggesting the existence of these interactions, little is know about specific binding characteristics and structure/function relationships between CD47 and TSP-1. To explore binding of TSP-1 to CD47, we are employing a variety of approaches, including plasmon waveguide resonance spectroscopy (PWR), flow cytometry and calcium imaging. These studies indicate that the C-terminal fragment of TSP-1 (E3CaG1) binds to multiple signaling complexes involving CD47 on membrane surfaces, including \u03b1v\u03b23 and VEGFR2. E3CaG1 can bind with nM and pM affinities to the membrane surface; however, which of these leads to an increase in Ca2+ levels is not yet known and the subject of investigation. We hypothesize that knocking out various glycosylation sites in the extracellular portion of CD47 will impact binding of TSP-1 to CD47. Testing this will involve mutagenesis in knocking out glycosylation sites as well as flow cytometry and cell imaging to probe binding characteristics. CD47 has an extracellular IgG domain, is heavily glycosylated, has 5 transmembrane helices and a short alternatively-spliced C-terminal domain in the cytosol. We are exploring which of those are important for ligand binding, complex formation and Ca2+ signaling using recombinant proteins in immortalized human cell lines. Replication Protein A (RPA), the major eukaryotic single-strand DNA (ssDNA) binding protein, is essential for replication, repair, recombination, and cell cycle progression. Defects in RPA-associated cellular activities lead to genomic instability, a major factor in the pathogenesis of cancer and other diseases. RPA is a heterotrimeric complex with the largest subunit, RPA1, containing the major ssDNA-binding activity. The high affinity DNA binding domain interacts with ssDNA via a series of polar residues and four conserved aromatic residues. Mutation of the aromatic residues does not dramatically decrease ssDNA-binding activity of RPA, but results in a cell cycle defect. We have used a combination of biochemical analysis in vitro and knockdown and replacement studies in HeLa cells to characterize the contribution of these aromatic residues to RPA function. Cells expressing these mutant forms of RPA accumulated double-strand breaks and possibly other DNA damage. In contrast the aromatic mutants were able to function in DNA replication and checkpoint activation. Examination of the pathways affected showed that the aromatic residue mutants were unable to support DNA repair. Both nucleotide excision and double strand DNA break repair were disrupted. Biochemical characterization of these separation-offunction mutants revealed that mutation of the aromatic residues severely decreased binding to short ssDNA regions. We conclude that altering the ssDNA-binding properties of RPA results in inadequate protection of short ssDNA regions exposed during normal cellular processes and causes defects in DNA repair. These studies suggest RPA is more reliant on the high affinity DNA-binding domains of RPA1 when binding to the short exposed ssDNA regions that occur after DNA damage. We conclude that DNA replication and DNA repair require different RPA-DNA interactions and that these differences may depend on the length of exposed ssDNA intermediates. These studies are defining functions of RPA in DNA repair and are contributing to understanding how human cells maintain genome integrity.

Using a modified HeLa cell line, we prepared highly translation-competent extracts for expressing a variety of genes from mammals, bacteria or protozoa. The Thermo Scientific 1-Step Human In Vitro Translation (IVT) System provides protein expression through the addition of a DNA or mRNA of interest to a mixture of HeLa cell lysate, accessory proteins and reaction mix followed by incubation for 1-6 hours at 30\u00b0C. The system is optimal for protein expression in microtubes (batch mode), microwell plates for high-throughput screening (HTS) studies and nucleic acid programmable protein arrays (NAPPA). NAPPA is an in situ protein expression and capture system that enables researchers to produce and display proteins as needed in a highly multiplexed fashion. In NAPPA arrays, the 1-Step system showed consistency between lots and average protein expression levels that were 5-to 10-fold greater on a genome-wide scale when compared to a rabbit reticulocyte lysate-based cell-free system. Combining dialysis with our 1-Step system increases protein expression to >250\u00b5g/mL by replenishing amino acids, nucleotides, salts and energy regeneration components, while eliminating inhibitory byproducts. Significantly higher activity of several proteins, including luciferases, was observed when using the 1-Step system versus a standard E.coli system. In addition, we developed a series of pT7CFE1based expression vectors, which are optimally suited as alternative pathways for purification and detection of the expressed proteins.",

The guinea pig SR-1 (gpSR-1) was recently expressed as a properly folded and active protein in a bacterial host strain. In collaboration with Professor Ruoho's team at the UW-Madison, we have expressed and purified gpSR-1 for functional studies and structure determination. To stabilize the protein, it is expressed and purified with maltose binding protein (MBP) that contains a periplasmic export sequence fused to the N-terminus of gpSR-1. The expressed fusion protein (MBP-gpSR-1) is anchored in the E. coli cytoplasmic membrane. We have designed a series of vectors with short linkers consisting of 0 to 5 alanine residues between the N-terminal MBP and the gpSR-1 receptor. All of these constructs were expressed in a series of E. coli expression host strains and purified at large scale (cell paste obtained from 4 L growth). To facilitate X-ray crystallography studies, MBP-gpSR-1 fusion is expressed as selenomethionyllabeled protein, using modified defined medium and IPTG induction. Our current purification procedure consists of (1) extraction from membrane fraction by application of detergents; (2) purification by affinity chromatography (amylose resin); and (3) gel filtration and subsequent concentration using centrifugation concentrators. We are able to obtain up to 13 mg of purified MBP-gpSR-1 protein, with the final yield depending on the individual construct's linker. The MBP-gpSR-1 fusion protein retains ligand binding activity typical of native SR-1. Crystallization screens are being performed by our crystallography team and also at PSI:Biology Membrane Protein Structural The growing demand and acceptance of the use of protein therapeutics has created the need to quickly and accurately measure their binding characteristics and functional activity throughout the entire therapeutic discovery, development and production cycle. Real-time, label-free analysis is a useful tool for characterizing protein therapeutics based on relevant biophysical parameters, such as kinetics and affinity. For high-throughput quantitative measurements, instrument performance and robustness are paramount; however, the critical parameters for integrating these essential requirements have been incompatible, to date. To evaluate the practical and efficient use of real-time, label-free analysis for high-throughput screening and the subsequent kinetic characterization of thousands of samples per day, a panel comprised of crude and purified potential antibody therapeutics was tested. The samples were subjected to an initial screening assay to identify 'hits' or a 'kinetic screen' designed to estimate association (k a ) and dissociation (k d ) rates. Highresolution, high-throughput kinetic experiments were conducted for all of the antibody samples in the panel. Kinetic values obtained from multiple binding cycles compared favorably with results from a single injection binding cycle, thereby increasing sample throughput. High-throughput assay development and optimization augmented the overall high quality of the data used to calculate the kinetic results. The study outcome further supports the feasibility of using real-time, label-free analysis for high-throughput characterization of protein therapeutics.

The causative agent of African sleeping sickness, Trypanosoma brucei, goes through an unusual mitochondrial RNA editing process essential for its survival. RNA editing terminal uridylyl transferase 2 of T. brucei (TbRET2) is an indispensable component of the editosome machinery responsible for the U addition in the editing process. Although not an integral part of the editosome, there is another essential enzyme that catalyzes the U addition: Mitochondrial Editosome-like complex Associated TUTase 1 (a.k.a. TbMEAT1). Both TbRET2 and TbMEAT1 are required for the insect as well as the bloodstream forms of the parasite, and, with their high-resolution crystal structures, they pose as promising pharmaceutical targets. Neither the exclusive requirement of UTP for catalysis nor the RNA primer preference of these enzymes are well understood.

The latter could be envisioned as catalytic replacements for antibodies, provided the therapeutic target is a serum accessible protein. Key to the successful application of engineered proteases will be the ability to alter substrate specificity in precise fashion while maintaining a high level of overall catalytic activity. We have been developing a range of protease engineering strategies over the past decade with an emphasis on directed evolution approaches incorporating a catalytic turnover based high throughput screen. Most of our work has incorporated E. coli as a host organism and a FACS dependent library screening. Using the model protease OmpT, we have been able to alter both the P1 and P1' substrate specificity in a surprisingly general way while maintaining a relatively high level of substrate specificity as well as high overall catalytic activity. We have also used directed evolution to generate OmpT variants specific for substrates with modified amino acids such as nitro and sulfo tyrosine. In addition to the E. coli based strategies, we have begun to explore the use of other host organisms and proteases. We recently were able to alter the P1 specificity of the TEV protease by over 5000-fold in a single round of directed evolution. With the implementation of the quality by design (QbD) concept to drug development, monitoring product quality attributes (PQAs) of therapeutic proteins during process and product development has become increasingly critical. Mass spectrometry has been widely used for quantification of modifications in therapeutic proteins. In addition the use of internal standards provide unique benefits for accurate and precise quantification, since all variability in sample handling is minimized as the internal standard is introduced into the sample for analysis prior to any sample handling steps, such as proteolytic digestion and chromatographic separation, etc. Here, we describe the introduction by in vivo metabolic labeling of a stable isotope to produce a stable isotope labeled internal standard (SILIS) protein with 15N enriched media. The SILIS protein is the foundation for a novel strategy for automatically monitoring multiple PQAs in a single LC/ MS analysis. The 15N labeled therapeutic protein was used as an internal standard to monitor multiple PQAs of in-process samples. Precise and accurate quantitation was achieved on a Thermo Scientific LTQ Orbitrap Velos high-resolution mass spectrometer. MassAnalyzer, an in-house developed software at Amgen, was used for automated identification and quantitation of multiple modifications identified in a single peptide map. An important property of antimicrobials is the ability to reach the chosen target, which can be achieved through the \"Trojan-horse\" strategy. In this regard, microcin E492 (MccE492), a channel-forming bacteriocin, utilizes receptors that are normally used for iron uptake masking itself as a beneficial iron chelator. The modular structure of MccE492 allows the design of hybrid molecules that would permit the entry to the cell to reach the target. MccE492 is synthesized as a precursor with three domains: the leader peptide necessary for the export, the toxic, and the uptake domain, that is post-translationally modified with a salmochelin-like molecule involved in the recognition by the siderophore receptors FepA, Fiu and Cir. For the design, the selected target was aimed to the divisome, a supramolecular complex essential for bacterial division. The divisome elements localize in an ordered fashion, both at cytoplasm and periplasm, being the complex formed by FtsQ, FtsL and FtsB the main periplasmic component, that works as a bridge coupling the cytoplasmic with the periplasmic events in the division. FtsL constitutes an interesting target because it is a checkpoint in the bacterial division, and the introduction of exogenous periplasmic region of FtsL would displace by competition the equilibrium in the formation of the FtsQ/FtsB/FtsL complex. Based on a model of the FtsL complex developed for this purpose and exploiting the modularity of MccE492, we replaced the central module with the FtsL periplasmic region (H56 to K121). This was flanked to the N-terminal with the 22 first amino acids of MccE492 encompassing the leader peptide, and to the C-terminal with the uptake module (G67 to S84). This construction was placed under a pBAD promoter and its expression was monitored after induction. The chimeric protein could not be exported, therefore a procedure to purify it from a cytoplasmic extract was developed. This preparation presented a strong antimicrobial activity assessed either by growth inhibition of an E. coli lawn or by survival counting after the treatment. The chimeric peptide did not have antimicrobial activity on strains lacking the siderophore receptors involved in the translocation of the peptide to the periplasm space. We have developed a successful strategy in the design and construction of new antimicrobial peptides.

ZFPs that recognize specific DNA target sequences can substitute for the binding domains of enzymes that act on DNA to create designer enzymes, such as nucleases, recombinases, and methylases, with programmable sequence specificity. Genome editing and modification by the enzymes could be applied for many fields of basic research and medicine. Some zinc finger nucleases (ZFN) are currently in human clinical trials that aim at therapeutic gene editing. A more recent strategy that aims at addressing the shortcomings of ZFNs are zinc finger recombinases (ZFRs). A thorough understanding of ZFRs and methods for their modification promises powerful new tools for gene manipulation in model organisms as well as in gene therapy. In this presentation, the studies about design of ZFNs and ZFRs will be discussed. For ZFNs, the studies of antiviral effects of targeting viral genomes by ZFNs will be shown. In design of ZFRs, the effects of DNA binding affinity of the zinc finger domains and the linker sequence between ZFPs and recombinase catalytic domains have been assessed. A plasmid system containing ZFR target sites was constructed for evaluation of ZFRs with variable linker lengths and numbers of zinc finger modules. Recombination efficiencies were evaluated by restriction enzyme analysis of isolated plasmids after reaction in E. coli and mammalian cells. The results provide information relevant to the design of ZFRs that will be useful for sequence-specific genome modification. The above mentioned technologies will be powerful tools for creation of cell lines with artificially modified phenotypes. Furthermore, the strategy in application of genome editing by zinc finger enzymes for study of synthetic biology will be discussed. The ankyrin and SOCS box containing (ASB) proteins form the largest family of SOCS box proteins. There are 18 known human variants that are implicated in diverse biological functions. The ASB proteins have two domains a C-terminal SOCS box domain and an N terminal Ankyrin repeat (AR) domain. The C terminal SOCS box has been shown to interact with Elongin B & C and cullin5 and play a role in ubiquitination and targeting proteins for degradation to the 26S proteasome. The N terminal AR domain functions to bind and target specific substrates for ubiquitination and degradation. ASB9 has been shown to interact with creatine kinase brain (CKB) type and ubiquitous mitochondrial creatine kinase (CKuMt) and target these proteins for degradation. The AR domain of ASB9 has 6 ARs that align well with the consensus sequence and a small linker between the AR domain and the SOCS box domain that also folds into an AR-like structure. We have been able to successfully clone and purify several AR domain constructs of human ASB9 and the creatine kinases and are exploring the interaction of ASB9 with creatine kinase brain type (CKB) using biochemical and biophysical techniques. ASB9 binds CKB with strong affinity based on in vitro pull down experiments and size exclusion chromatography. Isothermal calorimetry experiments have shown that the complex formed between ASB9 and CKB has very high affinity and the interaction is mainly entropic with a small enthalpic contribution. Biacore experiments to determine ka and kd values and hydrogen deuterium exchange (HDX) mass spectrometry (MS) studies are being performed to reveal the exact site of interaction between the two proteins. Creatine kinases play a major role in maintenance and regulation of cellular energy stores in tissues with high and rapidly changing energy demands. Altered expression and regulation of CKB is displayed in several neurodegenerative diseases and cancers. ASB9 deregulation has also been implicated as a marker in cancer progression. Understanding the mechanism by which ASB9 helps maintain CKB levels will be important to understanding the role of both these proteins in these diseases.",

            "text": "The coiled-coil motif mediates interactions in a large number of protein families involved in key cellular processes. The question of how a high degree of interaction specificity is encoded in the relatively simple structure of this motif is of fundamental importance. Predictive models for coiled-coil interactions would find applications in basic biology, biotechnology, synthetic biology and other areas. The coiled-coil motif has been intensively studied and its general features are known. A variety of methods have been proposed for modeling coiled-coil interaction, however, their accuracy is still limited. In this work, we have used a new set of 2,683 coiled-coil interactions measured experimentally for basic-leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factor coiled coils to deduce important determinants of coiled-coil specificity and transform them into a predictive model. We use a machine-learning framework that exploits knowledge of conserved residue-residue interactions in the coiled-coil motif. Our model is easily interpretable and allows us to pose testable hypotheses about factors contributing to coiled-coil specificity. We find that incorporating higher-order terms into the model is critical for the best predictions, which achieve a correlation with experimental binding free energies of R = 0.69. We demonstrate the superiority of this approach over other sequence-based and structurebased methods. We are currently applying this model to a range of problems related to leucine-zipper coiled-coil interaction specificity. This research is supported by the NIH award R01 GM06768. High-resolution structures of proteins provide valuable information for rational drug design. Prerequisite to obtain such structures are well-ordered threedimensional crystals. Some proteins have proven to be very difficult or even impossible to crystallize, and for such examples a number of ways have been developed to improve the chances for successful crystallization. Genetic engineering of the protein, either by the introduction of surface mutations or by the variation of the protein construct length, is often effective. Cocrystallization of proteins with other proteins may be a good alternative. Classically, antibodies or antibody Fab-fragments which might stabilize the target protein were used for co-crystallization and often result in an improved overall crystal quality. Recently the focus has also been on novel classes of very versatile binding proteins such as Darpins, Fynomers or Nanobodies. In order to evaluate the potential of such small scaffold proteins for crystallization we tested in parallel classical Fab-fragments, Fynomers derived from the SH3 domain of Fyn from Covagen, Nanobodies from Xaperones and a surface mutant approach for crystallizing BACE-2. BACE-2 is an aspartyl protease whose exact physiological function is unknown, but for which a role in the early stages of diabetes has been postulated. Its structure has only been published at 3.0 \u00c5 resolution, possibly because BACE-2 conformational heterogeneity limits a better diffraction. The parallel use of these different \"crystallization facilitators\" allows us to establish different crystals systems to test this tool molecules in a direct comparison and finally to efficiently support the drug discovery process using the obtained structural information. Treatment of sound wave shows an obvious effects on the growth and development of plants. Researchers found that sound wave effects on the production of hormones. The effects of music on plants have been controversial because the precise experimental conditions were not specified. In addition, music is a mixture of different frequencies and amplitudes, which makes more difficult to interpret the effects of sound waves. Despite the importance of sound wave in plant growth and development, little is known regarding the molecular physiological mechanisms underlying such a response. In this study, we investigated the changes in the omes of Arabidopsis (transcriptome, proteome and metabolome) in response to various frequency-specific sound waves in the controlled environment. This study was performed based on Affymetrix gene chip, twodimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) and HPLC, respectively. The differentially regulated transcripts, proteins and metabolites could be classified into photosynthesis, stress and defense, nitrogen metabolism and carbohydrate metabolism. To our best knowledge, this is the first report for the analysis of ome changes in response to sound wave in Arabidopsis. In addition, our findings provided a comprehensive omics view on the coordination of sound wave responses in Arabidopsis.",

To realize the full value of these sequenced genomes for systems and synthetic biology efforts requires functional characterization of mature protein products in a high-throughput fashion. However, no single approach to functional characterization is likely to be successful for any given protein. We are developing a suite of experimental approaches designed to identify characteristics of proteins that could provide clues to their function. These include elucidation of protein activities using chemical probes, identification of biomolecular interaction partners, and characterization of post-translational modifications. All of these are being applied in a high-throughput fashion using mass spectrometry methods to enable rapid characterization. The idea is that at the most basic level the almost any protein will bind and possibly chemically modify one or more other molecules, or possibly be modified itself. These proto-functions underlie the real biochemical and cellular function. Moreover, they can be screened for and identified in a high-throughput fashion. Particularly when combined with existing data from whole cell transciptomics, proteomics, and structural genomics campaigns, our approaches may reveal one or more clues that point toward a biochemical function that can be confirmed using traditional hypothesis-driven investigation.",

Mexico D.F., Mexico, 14080, Mexico Aldehydes such as malondialdehyde, acrolein and 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (4-HNE) are generated as products of lipid peroxidation in the organisms. It has been proposed that these compounds are part of the pathogenesis of diseases associated with oxidative stress like Alzheimer, Parkinson and diabetes, among others. These compounds are detoxified by aldehyde dehydrogenases (ALDHs). However, previous reports indicated that ALDH2 is inactivated by 4-HNE. The aim of this work was to investigate the susceptibility of ALDH1A1, ALDH2 and ALDH3A1, to inactivation by lipid peroxidation products. ALDH2 showed the highest affinity for the three aldehydes, followed by ALDH1A1. The activity of ALDH3A1 with these aldehydes was 6 to 10 fold higher compared with the other enzymes, but the affinity for these compounds was low. Although ALDH2 was the most efficient enzyme, it was inactivated by acrolein and 4-HNE at concentrations above 5 and 10 \u03bcM, respectively, while ALDH1 was inactivated by acrolein at concentrations higher than 1 mM. Surprisingly, ALDH3A1 was resistant to inactivation by these aldehydes, even at concentrations as high as 20 mM. It was previously reported that the order of reaction of 4-HNE with nucleophylic amino acids was Cys >> His > Lys and suggested that the target for the inactivation was the reactive cysteine in ALDH2 (Cys302). Since ALDH3A1 is resistant to inactivation by the aldehydes assayed, the reactive cysteine may not be the target for the inactivation of ALDHs. Thus, the amino acids sequence of the active site of the ALDHs was compared in order to identify residues susceptible to react with the aldehydes. It was observed that ALDH1 had an extra cysteine aside Cys 302, while ALDH2 possessed 2 cysteines flanking cys302 and ALDH3 only had the reactive cysteine. In the NAD+ binding site, ALDH1 and ALDH2 had an exposed lysine (Lys352), while ALDH3A1 had an arginine in the equivalent position. Assays of protection by substrates indicated that propionaldehyde slightly protected the enzyme from inactivation, while NADH showed a higher protection, indicating that the binding site of NAD+ is also a target for the inactivation. In conclusion, the extra cysteines in the aldehyde binding site and a lysine in the NAD+ binding site, may be the targets for inactivation by lipid peroxidation products in ALDH1 and ALDH2.

This 15N-labeling EnMR medium applies the fed-batch like cultivation system, EnBase (Enzymebased glucose-delivery), and provides high cell densities (DCW > 8 or OD600 > 24), reduces accumulation of growth-inhibiting compounds (by overflow metabolism), and additionally potentiates the control of the protein synthesis rate. EnBase medium has been shown in several publications to give enhanced yields of soluble protein in comparison to mineral salt medium or rich medium compositions. A robust cultivation protocol with low hands-on activities was developed. This protocol consists of overnight cultivation yielding induction cell density of OD600 of 1.5 to 3.0, induction by IPTG without any intermittent cell harvesting or medium change, and few additions of the glucosereleasing enzyme. Cell harvesting is typically done 24 h after induction. Studies with several recombinant constructs showed that with NH4Cl-supplemented EnMR medium, specific productivity (recombinant protein per cell) comparable to the performance of the standard M9 medium could be achieved. Additionally, the volumetric yields obtained using the EnMR medium were much higher. Protein by protein comparisons showed that EnMR medium could in some cases give soluble recombinant protein, while M9 could not. This newly-developed system is flexible and has been shown to be scalable providing high yields both in deep well plates and shake flask cultivations.",

Eng., University of Oulu, Oulu, Finland, 3 BioSilta, Oulu, Finland Enzyme-based glucose-delivery system (EnBase) is a fed-batch-like method applicable for simple shaken cultivations. Since the glucose-feeding rate can be adjusted by enzyme dosing to match the cultivation conditions (especially oxygen transfer rate and cell density), EnBase technology can provide a level of growth control, which is normally applicable only in bioreactor cultivations. Additionally, glucose-limiting conditions create the possibility to maintain a favorable pH level by applying a balanced mixture of organic and inorganic nitrogen sources. An efficient cultivation protocol was developed for Pichia pastoris using the new EnBase yeast medium composition, EnPresso Y Defined tablets. Slow glucose-delivery does not prevent the induction of AOX1 or AOX2 promoter by methanol, but can instead prevent starvation between methanol pulses and provide higher cell yields and product yields. Both intracellular proteins such as a plant-lectin binding protein, Mpv17 (human integral membrane protein), Erp18 (human endoplasmic reticulum protein), and secreted proteins like lipases of Rhizopus or Candida spp. showed 3-to 10-fold improved volumetric protein production in comparison to routinely used cultivation media. Optimization of the cultivation protocol for a GFP-tagged construct expressing human adenosine receptor A3 suggests that this EnBase medium can also reduce the metabolic stress caused by methanol or by frequently changing conditions observed in shaken cultures; thus, improve the quality of synthesized protein. EnPresso Y Defined medium, which feeds low amounts of glucose throughout the cultivation, can provide stable conditions, which are ideal for protein production in Pichia pastoris. The major benefits include that the amount of the toxic inducer methanol can be minimized, starvation between methanol pulses can be avoided, medium change is no longer required and the medium can be easily prepared from pre-sterilized tablets. Enzymatic \"co-feed\" of glucose can also significantly shorten the cultivation time in methanolinducible systems. In comparison to YPD-medium, EnPresso Y Defined gave higher product yields in 3 days than YPD-medium in 7 days. This cultivation protocol, which includes occasional addition of the glucosereleasing enzyme together with methanol addition, can be easily adapted to any vessel or shaking condition.",

Our experimental results indicated that nanoengineered coatings are superior in supporting growth, adhesion, and proliferation. The improved biocompatibility of nanostructured coatings, we believe, is due to improved initial adsorption of the fibronectin (FN) adhesive protein on the artificial surface with simultaneous induced protein unfolding (converted compact FN to its extended counterpart form). Absorption experiments with FN from human plasma using an ELISA-based technique resulted in higher FN adsorption on nanoengineered surfaces as compared to other conventional orthopedic materials. Pure cubic ZrO2 coatings are fabricated with 2-25 nm grain size which is comparable to the protein dimensions by applying ion beam assisted deposition [1] . These experiments indicate a clear correlation between cell adhesion and FN adsorption. Motivated by experimentally-observed biocompatibility enhancement of nanoengineered cubic zirconia (ZrO2) coatings to mesenchymal stromal cells, we implemented Monte Carlo simulation methods [2] and carried out computational analysis of causes for partial unfolding of 1FN3-2FN3 domains compact complex on the surface. These domains are very important for FN-FN binding, FN matrix assembly initiation, and understanding of the physicochemical mechanisms for FN activation on the surface. Our calculations showed that disruption of the considered domain complex can be promoted due to rather strong selective (attractive and repulsive) electrostatic interactions between negatively charged surface patches and ionogenic groups of the negative and positive charged domains. As the above domains contain FN-binding sites, one can suggest that these sites become exposed and effective for FN matrix assembly. Thus, a nanostructured negatively charged surface may facilitate activation for adsorbed FNs (in extended form) and their binding with other FNs adhered on the cell surface. Thus, we suggest a rather simple electrostatic mechanism for FN activation due to its immobilization on the nano-structured oxide surface. This process will facilitate formation of ECM on the surface and promote the focal cell adhesion. Research support provided by the Department of Energy, Biological & Environmental Research.",

Two major obstacles to protein crystallography are the growth of large, well-ordered crystals and X-ray induced radiation damage. Smaller, yet still well ordered, crystals can often form in a crystallization experiment. Unfortunately, the integrated intensity within a Bragg reflection scales with the number of illuminated unit cells. As a result, for a given protein crystal, more dose must be given to the crystal, in the form of higher intensity or longer exposures, to achieve similar resolutions with smaller crystals. The increased dose has the negative effect of generating additional X-ray-induced radiation damage, potentially making the interpretation of electron-density maps around radiation-damage-susceptible groups difficult, if not impossible to interpret. The advent of the X-ray freeelectron laser (XFEL) may allow the use of smaller protein crystals by breaking the nexus between dose and radiation damage. The success of crystallography at XFELs will be predicated on diffraction before destruction, meaning the necessary information for reconstructing electron-density maps would be recorded before the onset of the damage processes. Ultimately, protein crystallography at XFELs could pave the way for structure determination from protein nanocrystals and microcrystals, from radiation-damage-susceptible proteins, and from pump-probe experiments utilizing the intrinsic temporal resolution offered by the source.",

A 635 nm laser scans the wells of a BioCD as it spins. Spinning Disc Interferometry measures changes in relative optical absorption/refraction based upon: i) Relative number of absorbent amino acids {W, Y, F, P, and H} in the correct orientation; ii) The amount protein bound or equal to protein \"height\"; iii) The amount of protein is an estimated from standard curve. The other amino acids do absorb light but the aromatic character of the five are the main contributors. Firstly, a disc spins while a narrow band width of an optical light source refracts light. Light which is refracted and directly proportional to the amount of protein present passes over the wells. More specifically, the highly absorbent amino acids mainly W,Y,F,P,and H whose R groups are aromatic and are the significant contributors. If they are properly spatially orientated to absorb light, the amino acid will be directed related to amount of protein. However, each particular oriented species (protein stack can bind in an infinite number of conformations to the solid phase) they will determine the limits of detection and slope of your standard curve (extinction coefficient). Furthermore, the orientation of an aromatic ring, take Phe for instance, can be attached to the solid phase in the protein backbone in two totally non-light absorbing species one with the aromatic ring parallel to the solid phase and the other horizontal to the solid phase. So in other words, the absorbance is dependent upon the relative number of highly absorbent amino acids {mainly W,Y,F,P,and H}. These five amino acids have the aromatic R groups. Interesting a labeled fluorescent binding partner stacked, measured and read with Interferometry is directly proportional to amount of protein captured. However, in a label free protein stack this is not true. This is due to the inherent issues mentioned above. Additionally, one of the relative limits of the system are your protein sample competes for binding sites whether they be full or partial transcripts. Label free kinetic analysis has become an indispensable tool for academic and industry researchers in the fields of protein engineering and drug discovery. SPR is the flagship technique for this analytical tool, but despite its prominence in industry has not managed to significantly increase its throughput across platforms since its inception 20 years ago. The array format unlocks the true potential of this technology by allowing researchers to simultaneously monitor 96 or more discrete interactions to a series of analytes in real time. This not only vastly increases the throughput of general kinetic analysis, but it gives the user powerful new experimental design options by staging massively parallel interaction assays. One of the most exciting target applications for this multiplexed approach is epitope mapping, where antibodies are screened based on their ability to bind an antigen in the presence of an antibody or compound already bound to a specific site on that antigen. The one-on-many, highly parallel nature of this technique provides an elegant way of maintaining the consistency of experimental parameters across diverse ligand species in the array. This has enabled us to perform a binning experiment in 3 hours that would have taken the industry standard 3 days to complete. Using SPR, the yield and activity of solubilized GPCRs can be tested to identify the best conditions under which to study the kinetics of interactions with these important but highly fragile molecules. The array format allows you to run your analyte over the 96 conditions in a single injection, dropping your run time down to 30 min (compared to 48 hours) giving the greatest probability of the GPCRs maintaining consistent binding activity.",

Ideally, cultivation of biofuel-producing microorganisms should be supported by biomass feedstocks obtained from energy crops or agricultural wastes. Endophytes are a class of organisms that colonize intercellular spaces in plants; and as such contain the requisite hydrolytic enzymes needed to deconstruct lignocellulose. We focused our efforts on four endophytic fungi that have the added ability to produce VOCs with fuel potential. In this study, we aim to identify and characterize the secreted lignocellulolytic fungal enzymes through genomics and proteomics methods. Four strains (a Daldinia (EC12) and 3 Hypoxylons (CI-4A, CO27-A and EC38)) were obtained from the Mycological Collection of the Department of Plant Sciences at MSU. Fungal isolates were grown in liquid medium containing supplemented M9 media and sterile feedstock (milled corn stover, switchgrass, or arbog eucalyptus) as the sole carbon source. All feedstocks were able to support growth, but mycelium growth was fastest in corn. EC12 achieved comparable growth rates in all feedstocks. For secretome analysis, cultures were grown in liquid medium at room temperature and the culture media were harvested after 2 weeks. To remove contaminants, the supernatant samples were further filtered and protein concentrated by ultrafiltration. Total protein concentration was determined by BCA protein assay and proteins were separated and visualized by SDS-PAGE. EC12 extracts had more proteins than the other species and in general, fungi grown on corn stover media contained more proteins than those grown on other media. Secretomes were assayed for cellulolytic activity using the DNS assay, and showed enzyme activity over a wide pH and temperature range (25-50oC) for all extracts. Secretomes were also assayed for ligninolytic activity using standard spectrophotometric assays (ABTS & guaiacol oxidation) and showed laccase and Mn peroxidase activity. In collaboration with JGI, the genomes of the four fungal strains have been assembled and annotated. Most of the ORFs were annotated using the KOG, KEGG, and Blast analogues.

Both integration into and excision from the chromosome of the host entail a site-specific recombination event, performed by the phage-encoded Integrase (Int) protein. The decision to integrate or to excise appears to be largely irreversible: once the decision is made, the phage would compromise its ability to survive if it does not complete the reaction. The recombination starts with DNA substrates (which we collectively refer to as A) that undergo one round of catalytic events -DNA cleavage, strand exchange, and ligation -to generate the first Holliday junction isomer (B). This B Holliday junction isomerizes to a different conformation, which we call C. Finally, the C Holliday junction isomer undergoes another round of catalytic events to generate the products, which we collectively refer to as E. Whether the pseudosymmetric intermediate, Holliday junction is in the B or C conformation appears to determine whether the reaction proceeds forward to products E or backwards to regenerate substrates A. Ultimately, we would like to understand how the Integrase protein accomplishes Holliday junction isomerization at the molecular level, and what features regulate this event. To address this goal, we are combining biochemical assays with mathematical modeling approaches to determine the equilibrium constants of each of the reaction steps. With the model, we can characterize the effect of Int mutant proteins on interactions with HJ and HJ isomerization by seeing how different mutations affect the equilibrium constants. We have isolated radiolabeled Holliday junction intermediates, re-loaded them with proteins, and monitored the resolution of the junctions either into the \"substrates\" attL and attR (collectively known as A) or into the products attP and attB (collectively known as E). The kinetics constants were then solved by fitting differential equations to the experimental data. We also used two HJ isomers whose conformation is biased towards either the B or the C conformation. The mathematical model has generated stable kinetics constants that are informative in describing the difference between wild-type and the two biased HJ isomers during catalytic events. While analyzing all available protein structures for the presence of knots and slipknots we detected a strict conservation of complex knotting patterns within and between several protein families despite their large sequence divergence. Since protein folding pathways leading to knotted native protein structures are slower and less efficient than those leading to unknotted proteins with similar size and sequence, the strict conservation of the knotting pattern indicates an important physiological role of knots and slipknots in these proteins. Although little is known about the functional role of knots, recent studies have demonstrated a protein-stabilizing ability of knots and slipknots. Some of the conserved knotting patterns occur in proteins forming transmembrane channels where the slipknot loop seems to strap together the transmembrane helices forming the channel. Polar-to-hydrophobic amino acid substitutions can lower the structural specificity of proteins, allowing for the population of alternate folds and oligomeric states. In the dimeric ribbon-helix-helix protein Arc repressor, a single polar to hydrophobic substitution on the surface of the ribbon (Arc-N11L) transforms the region into a 3 10 helix, thereby burying the new hydrophobic sidechain. When two additional polar-to-hydrophobic mutations are introduced (Q9V and R13V; Arc-VLV), the protein adopts both dimeric states observed in Arc-N11L, and in addition populates an octamer with a distinct folding topology. To carefully investigate the sequence determinants of higher order oligomer formation, we have substituted various combinations of polar and hydrophobic residues at positions 9, 11, and 13 using sitedirected mutagenesis. Size exclusion chromatography shows that three aliphatic hydrophobic substitutions are necessary and sufficient to induce oligomerization, although variations in elution volume suggest that the specific oligomeric state(s) vary depending on the particular substitutions. Interestingly, residues 9-13 of Arc-VLV and other variants are predicted to be highly amyloidogenic, but do not form larger oligomers than octamer under any conditions tested. To investigate whether any sequence could induce amyloid formation in Arc, we substituted the highly amyloidogenic LVFFA region of A\u03b2 for residues 9-13 (Arc-A\u03b2). Surprisingly, Arc-A\u03b2 forms a stable dimer exclusively, suggesting that this region of Arc can be radically remodeled by hydrophobic mutations but is also highly resistant to more conventional misfolding/aggregation processes.",

Many of the factors in this machinery are conserved from yeast to mammals. In yeast, cleavage factor IA (CF IA) is required for both cleavage and polyadenylation of nascent pre-mRNA, and is comprised of four proteins: Rna14, Rna15, Clp1 and Pcf11. Rna14 and Rna15 are the fungal homologs of CstF-77 and CstF-64, respectively, in the cleavage stimulation factor (CstF) of mammals. Rna14 contains an N-terminal HAT (Half-A-TPR) domain, and a C-terminal 'monkeytail' that interacts with Rna15. Rna15 contains an N-terminal RNA-Recognition Motif (RRM), followed by the central hinge region that interacts with Rna14, and a C-terminal domain which interacts with Pcf11. We report the first crystal structures of Rna14 in complex with the hinge domain of Rna15, as well as the crystal structures of the HAT domain of Rna14 in two different crystal forms. The Rna14 HAT domain forms a stable dimer, both in solution and in the crystal structure. In the Rna14-Rna15 complex crystals, the HAT domain of Rna14 is connected to the C-terminal 'monkeytail' of Rna14 by a disordered linker. The HAT domain does not have strong interactions with the complex between the Rna14 'monkeytail' and the Rna15 hinge, which may indicate that these two domains function independently. The HAT domain of Rna14 has significant differences from the crystal structure of the CstF-77 HAT domain. The HAT domain exhibits varying conformations in the different crystal forms, which indicates that the dimer has inherent confirmational variability.",

Here we present an alternative approach to epitope mapping with the use of size exclusion chromatography (SEC) and static light scattering (SLS). SEC-SLS provides an attractive alternative as the proteins do not need to be modified and the interactions are directly observed in solution. In this approach two monoclonal antibodies and their common antigen are incubated together to form immune complexes. The complexes formed in the reaction mixture are separated by a size exclusion column and then analyzed as they elute from the column using a SLS detector. The SLS detector provides a direct method to determine the mass of the eluted species and therefore, taking into account the mass of the individual components, its likely identity. Under conditions where the two antibodies have epitopes that are identical or spatially related, only complexes consisting of one antibody and two antigens would be observed. Alternatively, if the two antibodies in the mixture recognize different epitopes, larger immune complexes could form. As proof of concept, we used Interleukin-12 (IL-12) and four anti-IL-12 monoclonal antibodies as a model system. Our results suggested that two of these antibodies recognized related epitopes on IL-12 while the remaining combinations recognized different epitopes. SEC-SLS analysis of IL-12 incubated with the two antibodies that recognize similar epitopes gave rise to a single eluted species with a molecular weight equivalent to a single antibody bound to two antigens, as would be predicted. Alternatively, the SEC-SLS analysis of IL-12 incubated with any other combination of two antibodies gave rise to multiple larger immune complexes. These preliminary findings demonstrate that SEC-SLS as a promising tool for epitope mapping. Aberrant expression and signaling of multiple proteins in the NF-kappa B pathway are commonly associated with inflammatory and stress induced diseases, including many cancers. Understanding how NF-kappa B signaling impacts disease progression is important to the development of novel therapeutics. Cell signaling events are routinely assessed using traditional Western blot analysis. Although a widely accepted methodology, the Western has it challenges. The technique is very labor intensive and generally yields results that are semi-quantitative. In addition, the generally required 5-10 \u03bcg of total protein per lane on a Western yield only one data point of information each, thus requiring large amounts of material when performing comprehensive pathway characterization experiments. Sally, the new instrument platform that runs Simple Western assays completely automates the manual steps involved in traditional Western blot protocols and can analyze up to 96 samples in a single experiment. Because Simple Western protocols consume only microliter sample volumes, reproducible (CV<20%) and quantitative results can be generated from precious or quantitylimited samples. In addition, Sally can generate in one run, eight different data points from the same 5\u03bcL lysate sample hence yielding eight times more information than a traditional Western using the same amount of sample. Moreover, this number of data points can be doubled by reusing the same sample in two consecutive runs on 2 days thereby maximizing the data collection from precious samples. Data shown will illustrate the capability of the Simple Western to map a time course for TNF alpha activation in Jurkat cells. Targets from the NF-kappa B pathway, including I kappa B,NFkappa B subunits c-Rel, p65, and p50/p105 from both Jurkat whole cell and nuclear lysates were screened on the Simple Western platform with normalization to a loading control (alpha-tubulin). In response to TNFalpha treatment, statistically significant changes in signal and localization were clearly observed for each of the key targets. Results and workflow comparisons indicate a distinct advantage of the Simple Western when compared to traditional Western methods.",

Kaposi's sarcoma associated herpesvirus (KSHV) belong to gamma-herpes virus family and its lytic replication plays a prominent role in Pathogenesis, tumorogenesis and also supporting the viruses in their survival at the latent phase. In many patients with compromised immunodeficiency like HIV patients or solid organtransplant recipients the risk of developing Kaposi sarcoma is high, mainly due to pre-existing infections. To understand how the lytic replication is regulated, is of great importance and may lead to effective therapeutic solutions that can bring the KSHV's associated diseases under control. Moving from a latent phase, where the virus produces only few proteins, to a lytic phase when it is fully activated starts with expression of few important proteins. The virus replicates in the host cell nucleus and has to circumvent the highly regulated system for mRNA processing in the host cell, in order to export its own intronless mRNA. To do this the virus is encoding a multi functional early protein, Orf57 that plays several roles in RNA processing and transport. Orf57 is shown to interact both with human proteins as well as viral proteins involved in RNA processing and export. Our current focus is on the structural and biochemical studies of Orf 57 and potential interactions with other viral proteins. Up to date, we have successfully purified Orf57, and obtained crystals that have diffracted up to 2.8\u00c5. We are currently in the final stage of solving the phases for this protein. Recombinant proteins generated for therapeutic use potentially contain traces of proteins from the host cell line used for their production. These impurities need to be minimized to prevent adverse immune reactions. The presence of host-cell proteins (HCP) is usually assayed by ELISA using a polyclonal antibody mixture directed against a wide range of host cell proteins, and the specificity of this assay should be characterized prior to adoption. A recommended method for this characterization involves twodimensional electrophoretic separation followed by Western blotting (1) . Although this method allows a straightforward determination of the range of reactivity of the antibody mixture, adoption of this methodology has been hindered by the perceived lack of sensitivity, lack of reproducibility and overall laborious nature of the 2-D electrophoresis and blotting workflow. Tools that simplify, standardize and accelerate 2-D electrophoresis and blotting have become available. Advanced electrophoresis and blotting instrumentation, stable and reproducible pre-cast gels, next-generation imaging and image analysis software all allow this assay to be performed in a reproducible manner in a relatively short time. We have undertaken to demonstrate this using secreted proteins and cell lysate derived from Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells. Three commercial anti-CHO cell HCP antisera were compared with regard to their range of reactivity as determined by 2-D electrophoresis and Western blotting. The 2-D electrophoresis procedure resulted in highly reproducible spot patterns and the tested antisera were clearly distinguishable on the basis of their reactivity against distinct protein populations in both the secreted protein and lysate samples.

This compaction of the genetic material is achieved by a complex and little understood process. Already at the level of the 30 nm fibre there is an ongoing debate about its precise structure and even about its in vivo relevance. Nucleosome-nucleosome interactions within and between fibres are mainly mediated by the protruding, flexible N-terminal domains of the core histones. Most prominently, the N-terminus of histone H4 is able to contact the negatively charged, 'acidic' patch on the surface of a neighbouring nucleosome. This interaction is critical to the formation of higher order structures in vitro and has been shown to be regulated by posttranslational acetylation of H4 K16. However, so far all evidence that this interaction mediates the condensation of chromatin in vivo is indirect. Here we present an approach that employs genetically encoded, UV-activatable crosslinker amino acids to trap histone-histone interactions in living yeast cells with site specificity. We identify a crosslink product that corresponds to the interaction of the histone H4 tail with the acidic patch proving the relevance of this interaction in vivo. By synchronizing yeast cells we demonstrate the predominance of this crosslink in mitosis, suggesting an important role in the condensation of chromatin.

By providing real-time information with sub-cellular resolution and being minimally invasive, FRET sensors represent an excellent method for investigating dynamics of, for example, metabolites, signaling molecules or nutrients [1] . Genetically-encoded FRET sensors are chimeric proteins expressed recombinantly by the host organism in which a ligand-binding protein is flanked by two fluorescent proteins (e.g. CFP and YFP). Despite the potential of FRET-based sensors as a method for studying biological systems, the development of new sensors remains laborious, often relies on the availability of three dimensional structure of the candidate ligand-binding protein, and is primarily driven by trial and error [2] .

These cationic polyamines are important for cellular proliferation, protein synthesis and gene regulation and are found in organisms ranging from bacteria to humans. In various organisms ODC activity is post-translationally regulated by its inhibitory protein antizyme (AZ), which is synthesized as a result of a ribosomal frameshifting due to increasing polyamine concentrations. Monomeric AZ inhibits dimeric ODC enzymatic activity by interacting with a single ODC protomer and it's degraded by an ubiquitin independent manner. While ODC is highly homologous in different species, AZ protein shows a wide diversity. The structure of mammalian ODC and a partial structure of rat antizyme are known. Although the structural information of ODC-AZ complex is unknown, a recent in silico experiment has shown residues that are involved in mammalian ODC-AZ binding. We have purified and characterized the ODC:AZ inhibitory complex from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In the current experiments we present a detail study of the yeast ODC:AZ heterodimer. We used hydrogen deuterium exchange to identify the interface residues that are significant in forming the heterodimer. Three peptides in the AZ and four peptides in ODC were identified from H/D experiments that are present in the interface of ODC:AZ complex. We used systematic site-directed mutagenesis to verify the critical residues of AZ that are important for heterodimer interaction in both in vivo and in vitro assays. Using a pull down assay, an equimolar AZ protein was tested for its ability to bind ODC. We observed that different AZ mutants have varying affinities to ODC. In AZ inhibition assays, various AZ mutants showed a reduced inhibition of ODC as compared to the wild type AZ showing the importance of these residues. In contrast to wild type AZ, the mutant AZ showed reduced degradation of ODC in vivo. The in vivo samples were tested for ODC activity and found that AZ mutants had greatly diminished the ability to inhibit ODC activity. Polyamine content of the AZ mutants were analyzed; it showed increased polyamine content compared to the wild type, further supporting the reduced activity and degradation of ODC in AZ mutants. Our study demonstrates that yeast AZ contains evolutionary conserved interface residues that are important for heterodimerization and are essential for its binding and inhibitory activity both in vitro and in vivo. The 190kDa multi-domain scaffold protein IQGAP1 has been reported to be involved in cell signaling, cytoskeleton reorganization, cell-cell adhesion, cytokinesis and exocytosis via its dynamic interactions with various binding partners including F-actin, Calmodulin, Cdc42, Rac1 and beta-catenin. IQGAP1 contains a single copy of a Type-3 Calponin homology domain at its amino terminus (residues 46-160). Recent studies have shown that N-terminal fragments of IQGAP1 (residues 2-210, 1-216 and 1-232) are able to bind to F-actin, and one of these fragments can also bind to Calmodulin (CaM) in the present of calcium. Here we have determined the crystal structure of human IQGAP1 residues 1-191 (henceforth referred to as the CHD). The overall structure of the CHD is very similar to other Type-3 Calponin homology domains such as those found in Calponin, Vav-3 and the yeast IQGAP1 ortholog Rng2. In the crystal, two CHD molecules form a head-to-head homodimer predominantly through hydrophobic interactions across an interface displaying a high degree of surface-shape complementarity. In solution, the CHD can also form a dimer at high protein concentration. Isothermal titration calorimetry and F-actin co-sedimentation assays show that the CHD can bind to Ca2+-CaM and F-actin, respectively. The Calmodulin Target Database identifies a potential CaM binding site within residues 91-103 of the CHD. Site-directed mutagenesis in combination with isothermal titration calorimetry provide further evidence that 93LKKI94 is critical for Ca2+-CaM binding. Sequence alignment with other Calponin homology domains predicts an F-actin binding site on the dimer interface. We introduced a disulfide bond to stabilize the dimer and mask potential F-actinbinding residues at the dimer interface. Two mutants, K161C and A154C are able to form dimers even in the presence of 10mM beta-mercaptoethanol, and these two mutants show reduced F-actin binding consistent with the importance of interface residues in F-actin binding. Interestingly, another interface mutant, L157D, disrupts dimer formation but still binds to F-actin similar to wild type CHD. Our results suggest that residue cluster 93LKKI94 contributes to Ca2+-CaM binding, and that F-actin binding utilizes residues located at the dimer interface. In addition, our results also indicate that the self-association of full-length IQGAP1 may be a parallel homodimer.",

Especially, a sensitivity of children to organic phosphorous compounds seems to be higher than adults, and it is feared that the compounds irreversibly influence for reproduction and endocrine system of children. Therefore, we studied the following in order to biochemically examine the effect of the fenitrothion to the endocrine system. The fenitrothion was administered to male rat of the 3 weeks-old at ratios of 0.1, 1, 10 and 30 mg/kg/day. Each concentration in the serum Testosterone, FSH, Progesterone and ACTH was measured, after the administrations were continued for 2 months. Sera testosterone in the fenitrothion treated groups of 1, 10 and 30 mg/kg/day were significantly higher than a control group without administration of fenitrothion. Sera FSH in the treated groups of 1 and 10 mg/kg/day were significantly higher. Sera progesterone in the treated groups of 1 and 10 mg/kg/ day were significantly lower. Sera ACTH of 1, 10 and 30 mg/kg/day treated groups were significantly higher. It seemed to be very effective to carry out the proteomic analyses for adrenal and pituitary gland for examining effects of the fenitrothion to the endocrine system. As the result of analyses, Nucleoside diphosphate kinase A, Ubiquitin conjugating enzyme E2 N, Peroxiredoxin-6 and Cytochrome B were detected as interest proteins in the pituitary gland. The present time, a relationship between expression level changes of these proteins and hormone concentration fluctuations of the pituitary gland is being examined. HSP-90(decreased) and apolipoprotein A-1, prohibitin, proteasome activator complex subunit-1, 6-phosphogluconolactase were detected as interest proteins in the adrenal gland. The change of the expression level of these proteins seemed to reflect load of a stress of the fenitrothion to the adrenal and the progesterone secretion reduction from the adrenal cortex. 1.

Useful in many respects, this minimal model nevertheless fails to explain patterns of ligand-receptor binding specificity, ligand-dependent diversity in signaling outputs from identical receptor complexes, and the extent of coupling between the symmetric dimer seen in active ECDs and the asymmetric dimer seen in the intracellular portion of the activated receptor. Furthermore, bona fide auto-inhibitory interactions in the ECD have yet to be identified. Calorimetric data presented here demonstrates that ligand binding to EGFR is strongly entropically-driven, as is receptor dimerization. This simple observation rationalizes our difficulty thus far in explaining receptor phenomena based on available crystal structures, which speak primarily to enthalpic terms. By analyzing the thermodynamics of ligandbinding and dimerization for a series of receptor mutants and ligands, we elucidate a model of receptor activation that reveals important auto-inhibitory motifs and a basis for ligand specificity.",

In an attempt to determine the specific substrate-binding motif of Pellino2, we identified an IRAK1 truncation variant (aa that interacts with Pellino2 in a phosphorylation dependent manner. Substitution of each threonine in IRAK1-197 with alanine identified T141 as the critical phosphorylated threonine on IRAK1-197 that Pellino2 specifically recognizes. A synthetic phosphopeptide corresponding to the sequence centered on T141 of IRAK1 (pT141 peptide) binds to Pellino2 with a Kd value in the 1\u03bcM range; this data was assessed in a fluorescence polarization binding assay, and independently verified using isothermal titration calorimetry. Binding analyses of other mammalian Pellino isoforms (Pellino 1, 3A, and 3B) to the pT141 peptide reveals differences in binding affinities and specificities. These differences are hard to reconcile due to the high degree of sequence identity among the Pellino isoforms, and cannot be readily explained by the Pellino2 FHA domain crystal structure. Thus, to further explore the molecular basis of these differences, we are working towards determining the X-ray crystal structures of the other Pellino isoforms. This work is supported by the American Heart Association and the NIH. Tail-anchored (TA) proteins are ubiquitous in eukaryotes and fulfill various important functions in the cell, such as the mediation of cell-cell contact and apoptosis signaling. Because they are anchored to the membrane by a short transmembrane domain (TMD) at the C-terminus, they cannot utilize the cotranslational signal recognition particle (SRP) pathway. Recent biochemical and structural studies have helped us identify and elucidate the details of the TA protein targeting pathway in yeast, also known as the Guided Entry of TA protein (GET) pathway. A homologous pathway, the TMD Recognition Complex (TRC) pathway, has been identified but details of this pathway remain elusive. In this study, we have structurally and biochemically characterized Bag6 and Ubl4Apreviously shown to be crucial in the recognition and delivery TA proteins from the ribosome to TRC40.",

Despite its fundamental biological importance, the underlying mechanism is poorly understood. The challenge is that Hsp90 preferentially interacts with partially folded, non-native states of its client proteins. In response to this limitation, I developed a method exploiting a model unfolded protein, \u0394131\u0394, a truncation variant of staphylococcal nuclease studied extensively because it is amenable to NMR. \u0394131\u0394 binds to Hsp90, alters the chaperone conformation, and activates its ATPase function. Hsp90 binds a highly structured region within the non-native \u0394131\u0394, revealing that Hsp90 behaves very differently from chaperones such as Hsp70 that recognize fully unfolded protein regions. SAXS and modeling revealed that \u0394131\u0394 alters the conformational landscape of Hsp90, coordinating structural changes between the two different subunits within the Hsp90 dimer. By FRET I have found that \u0394131\u0394 catalyzes a dramatic structural transition that is rate-limiting for ATP hydrolysis by the chaperone, with significant ramifications for how ATP hydrolysis energy is coupled to client maturation. These findings suggest that model unfolded proteins may be able to elucidate mechanisms of other poorly understood chaperone systems.",

MonoTIM, an engineered monomeric version of TIM is 1000 times less active than the natural dimeric enzyme from Trypanosoma brucei [Borchert, et al., (1994) Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 15(4): . This enzyme has been further engineered by random mutagenesis to increase its catalytic activity, giving place to a new variant (RMM0-1) with increased activity [Saab-Rinc\u00f3n, et al., (2001) Protein Eng 14 (3):149-55]. The resulting variant carries the mutations: Ser43Pro, Thr44Ala and Ala179Thr. An X-ray crystallographic study of this protein, showed a temperature-dependent equilibrium between two inter-convertible crystalline forms. Analysis of crystalline contacts in both refined models suggests the existence of a dimeric enzyme when the crystals grow at 30 \u00b0C (space group P212121), while a more-active monomeric form of the enzyme is found at 18 \u00b0C (space group C121). Surprisingly, this protein retained a tendency to dimerize, but did so in a manner quite different from that found naturally. Also, dimerization did not contribute to an increase of the activity, suggesting that it is the monomer the active species. Likewise, we carried out equilibrium folding studies, following the formation of secondary structure using circular dichroism and of tertiary structure by fluorescence. These studies were performed at three different temperatures (18, 25 and 30 degrees), to determine the folding mechanism of MonoTIM and to corroborate if at the higher temperature there is a concentration-dependant transition that can be attributed to the formation of a dimeric species in solution. We found that the folding mechanism MonoTIM in solution is totally dependent on temperature, following a twostate folding mechanism at 18\u00b0C, whereas at 25 and 30\u00b0C the presence of an intermediate state is evident following a three-states folding mechanism.",

Continuous pulsed illumination of carbomonoxy-Mb crystals at low temperatures has illustrated structural changes around each cavity in response to ligand migration. In the present study, we examined the effect of the breathing motion on the potential of mean force (PMF) for ligand-protein interactions by using molecular dynamics simulation and experimental data [1] . Conformational sampling of Mb was performed by NPT molecular dynamics simulation for 92 ns. We introduced three-dimensional lattice of regularly spaced grid points, and evaluated PMF at each point by the implicit ligand sampling method [2] . The effect of the breathing motion on the ligand-protein interaction was quantitatively represented by the change of PMFs before and after flash photolysis. Our calculations demonstrated molecular mechanisms of ligand-migration, which include ligand escape via Xe1 to protein exterior and gate opening between Xe2-and Xe3 pockets [3] (http:// www.tb.phys.nagoya-u.ac.jp/~yamato/PMF3D.pdf http://www.tb.phys.nagoya-u.ac.jp/~yamato/PMF3D. zip).

Automation of DMS using the Chirascan\u2122-plus automated CD spectrometer (ACD) allowed a large number of buffer conditions to be studied quickly and easily. Data were acquired in an overnight, unattended measurement, and the following important results for the IgG in question were derived: Greatest thermal stability occurs at pH>5 Greatest resistance to aggregation is seen at pH<5 Pre-transition conformation changes with pH Aggregation, when it occurs, is easily detected Quantitative results with errors are readily calculated Protein usage per denaturation is low at ~60ug LB29 Using site-directed mutagenesis to elucidate the biological role of the c-type heme Melody Frink 1 Heme is a prosthetic group consisting of a porphyrin ring with a redox active iron atom coordinated at its center. Heme proteins are ubiquitous in biology, examples of which include the cytochrome superfamily of proteins. Cytochromes a and b have heme groups held in place by hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions. Cytochromes c also have heme groups, but their hemes are covalently attached to the rest of the protein by two thioether bonds donated by two cysteine residues. The covalent attachment of the c-heme is energetically expensive and the biological significance of the attachment is unclear. We propose that the covalent linkages of the c-heme prevent heme scavengers such as the pathogenic bacteria nontypable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) from stealing heme from those proteins. To test our hypothesis, we prepared several mutants of wild-type cytochrome c (WT) in which the heme protein contained only a single covalent linkage (SM) or no covalent linkages (DM) to the heme. We cultured NTHi in the presence of WT, SM, and DM cytochrome c (along with several positive and negative controls). The results of our study demonstrate that the covalent attachments to the c-heme do prevent NTHi from stealing heme from WT cytochrome c, while both SM and DM readily donate their heme to NTHi.

The virus enters the host cell through interaction of its envelope (Env) spike component gp120/gp41 with both CD4 receptor and a chemokine co-receptor, most commonly CCR5 or CXCR4, on the host cells. Peptide triazoles (PT's) are a novel class of inhibitors that specifically target gp120 and inhibit its interactions at both host cell receptor-binding sites. PT's have been found to neutralize virus infection of cells by a broad range of virus subtypes in both single round and fully infectious virus assays. Some variants of peptide triazoles have been found to cause specific HIV-1 lysis. We have investigated the functional site for peptide triazole antagonism on Env gp120. Site specific alanine mutagenesis identified a cluster of sensitive gp120 residues for which mutations significantly suppress PT binding and receptor site inhibition. Within this epitope, D474 and T257 appear to be the most critical, while nearby residues, in particular M475 and E370, are also important for antagonist function. This cluster of residues is in a conserved region of gp120 that overlaps the CD4 binding site and is distant from the coreceptor/17b binding site, suggesting an allosteric mode of inhibition for the latter. The arrangement and sequence conservation of the residues in the functional epitope explain the breadth of antiviral activity. To examine the specific roles of epitope residues in HIV gp120 for peptide triazole binding, we have embarked on multisite mutagenesis. Double mutants, including D474A/ T257S and M475A/E370A, have been produced, and the interdependence of their sensitivities with intact and truncated peptide triazoles is under investigation. This line of work will test the extent to which the high binding free energy of peptide triazoles results from accumulation of multiple productive interactions distributed over the interaction interface between gp120 and peptide antagonist.

This enzyme is widely distributed amongst eukaryotes and prokaryotes, but its function varies in different organisms. GAD has a crucial role in the vertebrate central nervous system where it is responsible for the synthesis of GABA, a major inhibitory neurotransmitter. In bacteria, it has been shown that GAD is induced by an acidic environment and contributes to acid resistance and to competitiveness in acidic environments. Bacterial GAD belongs to L-DOPA decarboxylase family which also includes DOPA/tyrosine decarboxylase and histidine decarboxylase. In the current study, we have determined the first crystal structures of GAD from Sphaerobacter thermophilus (StGAD) in two crystal forms: clear and yellow, at 1.9\u00c5 and 1.7\u00c5 resolutions, respectively. The full length StGAD forms an obligate functional dimer. Each subunit is composed of three domains: N-terminal, PLP-binding and C-terminal. The StGAD structure in yellow form contains PLP at one PLP-binding domain and PLP as well as GABA at the other PLP-binding domain, while clear StGAD crystal contains a PLP-GABA intermediate in one active site and a pyridoxamine 5'-phosphate in another active site. Two loops near the PLP sites are disordered in both structures. Details of the kinetic studies and structurebased GABA synthesis mechanism in StGAD will be presented. This project was funded by a grant from the National Institute of Health GM094585 and by the U. S. Department of Energy, Office of Biological and Environmental Research, under contract DE-AC02-06CH11357. The amyloid fibrils formed by islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP) are associated with type II diabetes. The study on the early interactions between the 37-residue monomers is of great importance to a better understanding of IAPP aggregation process. We performed replica exchange molecular dynamics simulations to sample the conformational space of IAPP monomers in the aqueous solution. The free energy surface of IAPP monomer was then constructed. We find that the most populated species in the ensemble are random coils, rather than the dynamic helical structures identified by experiments in literature. The exposed hydrophobic residues of each of the random coil clusters are found to be consistent with the results of the limited proteolysis experiments. We then carried out protein-protein docking to predict the IAPP dimer interface using ClusPro followed by RossetaDock. The aromatic residue F23 is found to be critical to the monomer-monomer interactions. The importance of the hydrophobic interactions is also suggested by various small molecule inhibitors. The hydrophobic interface of the dimer resembles the shape of the antiparellel cross-section bilayer of the IAPP fibril structure resolved by the solid state NMR. Our work suggests an alternative pathway of the initial contacts of IAPP monomers, implying more complicated routes of IAPP aggregation than that was believed.

However many proteins natively require multiple distinct conformations for functionality. Recently, a novel algorithm has been developed which considers several structures in a single optimization calculation. This new method could be useful for designing proteins that need to accommodate several conformations. We sought to test this algorithm on triosephosphate isomerase (TIM). Loop 6 in TIM is a lid with open and closed conformations that facilitate substrate binding, product diffusion, and catalysis. It uses two 3-amino acid hinges that provide the flexibility for the open-closed transition. In the present work we use multi-state design (MSD) methods to design the flexible hinges in TIM. We are in the process of assessing the applicability of MSD for the design of flexible protein hinges by exhaustive screening of computationally designed libraries. The results will suggest whether, by considering both conformations of the enzyme instead of purely the open or closed conformations, our methods provide libraries enriched in catalytically active TIMs. This work supported by a DARPA Protein Design Processes grant and a National Security Science and Engineering Faculty Fellowship award to S.L.M. 201 In Silico Screening of Computational Enzyme Designs Bernardo Sosa Padilla Araujo 1 , Thomas Miller 2 , Stephen Mayo 3, 2 1 Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics Option, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA, 2 Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, California Institute of Technology, 1200 E California Blvd MC 114-96, Pasadena, CA, 91125, 3 Biology, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA",

To bring binding studies closer to the in vivo environment, we investigated the role of crowding and the cellular environment on binding. For crowding we added various polymers to the solution, including Dextran and PEGs of different molecular weights, used cell extracts or performed real time measurements within living cells. While crowding enhances oligomerization and polymerization of macromolecules, it has only a small effect on the binding rates and affinities of transient protein-protein interactions. Interestingly, also in living cells the rates of association were close to those measured in the test tube in simple solutions. We suggest that the limited effect of crowders, which is much bellow the expected from the increased viscosity of the solutions, is a result of the occluded volume effect in high crowder concentrations. Direct measurements of the stability of the encounter complex shows that crowders have only a minor effect on K1 or k2, and do not change the shape or size of the encounter complex.",

In addition to the increasing number of structures being determined, the complexity of the structures has markedly increased. Examination of structures with similar sequences yields information about evolution and protein function.

In the first catalytic step, biotin is carboxylated in the biotin carboxylase (BC) domain. According to the current paradigm, the biotin carboxyl carrier protein (BCCP) domain subsequently transfers the carboxybiotin from the BC domain to a neighboring carboxyl transferase (CT) domain on a physically separate polypeptide chain. The CT domain then catalyzes the transfer of the carboxyl group from carboxybiotin to pyruvate, forming OAA. When recombinant PC is expressed as a dimer, a neighboring CT domain is not present to accept the BCCP domain. Previous research by our group revealed that this recombinant PC exhibits surprisingly high biotin-dependent activity despite the inability of BCCP to access a neighboring CT domain. This suggests that PC may be capable of stabilizing an interaction between BCCP and CT domains on the same polypeptide chain. To further explore this possibility, we have assessed the catalytic activity of recombinant hybrid dimers with various combinations of inactive BCCP and CT domains. The results of these hybrid dimer experiments offer new insights into the domain interactions in PC and clarify the extent of interaction between the individual monomers of the CT domain.",

This results show that the equilibrium folding of LAO is a two state process. In contrast, the chevron plot obtained from unfolding and refolding experiments presents two branches at low urea concentrations, both with curvature, indicating that there is at least one kinetic intermediate in the folding of LAO. Thereby LAO and HiJ show different folding behaviors in spite of sharing the same topology and high percentage of identity, making them a good model to study the structural determinants of folding behavior in PBPs.

Unlike Escherichia coli, the Gram-positive Bacillus subtilis bacterium possesses two RecQ-like homologues, RecQ[Bs] and RecS, which are required for the repair of DNA double-strand breaks. RecQ[Bs] also binds to the forked DNA to ensure a smooth progression of cell cycle. Here we present the first biochemical analysis of recombinant RecQ[Bs]. RecQ[Bs] binds weakly to single-stranded (ss)DNA and blunt-ended doublestranded (ds)DNA, but strongly to forked dsDNA. The protein exhibits a DNA-stimulated ATPase activity, and ATP-and Mg2+-dependent DNA helicase activity with a 3' to 5' polarity. Molecular modeling shows that RecQ[Bs] shares high sequence and structure similarity with E. coli RecQ. Surprisingly, RecQ[Bs] resembles the truncated Saccharomyces cerevisiae Sgs1 and human RecQ helicases more than RecQ[Ec] with regard to its enzymatic activities. Specifically, RecQ[Bs] unwinds forked dsDNA and DNA duplexes with 3'-overhang, but inactive on blunt-ended dsDNA and 5'-overhanged duplexes. Interestingly, RecQ[Bs] unwinds blunt-ended DNA with structural features, including nicked, gapped, 5'-flap, Kappa joint, synthetic replication fork, and Holliday junction. Furthermore, RecQ[Bs] catalyzes strand annealing and strand exchange. The ability of the RecQ[Bs] helicase to target these DNA intermediates and to catalyze strand exchange may be relevant to its role in maintaining genome stability.

            "text": "A cascade of interactions involving the three Min proteins in gram-negative bacteria produces dynamic subcellular structures that help direct the cytokinetic cell septum to the middle of symmetrically dividing cells. This pattern of Min protein oscillation is driven by the MinD ATPase that binds directly to the inner membrane when bound to ATP. Its interactions with MinE stimulate ATP hydrolysis, releasing the complex from the membrane (1) . However, recently determined solution NMR and x-ray crystallography structures have indicated that in order for MinE to bind to MinD, a dramatic conformational change in MinE must take place to expose the binding residues to MinD (2, 3) . According to this model, MinD-binding residues are buried in the dimeric interface, but can be exposed by interactions involving MinE and the membrane (4). The MinE structure that has been proposed to be involved in MinD binding nonetheless remains dimeric, with a new dimer interface being formed by other parts of MinE. However, the persistence of the dimeric state in the MinD-bound form raises new questions regarding the functional role of the MinE dimer. Using a series of MinE mutants and peptide models of the MinD-binding domain from MinE, we investigate the functional importance of the dimeric state of MinE. Since the interactions that give rise to the dynamic Min protein structures are not yet known, findings from this work provide new insight into the role of MinE in dynamic Min protein polymer formation. 1.

Hsieh, CW, et al. (2010 Amyloidosis has been found to be responsible for a growing number of misfolding disorders. Although several amyloid diseases are fatal and most are very severe, to date no effective treatment to any of the amyloid related diseases is available. In order to characterize the structural aspects of protein aggregation, the three main species present during amyloid aggregation have to be studied: the starting native fold, the oligomers and the mature amyloid fibrils. Beta-2 microglobulin (b2m) is an amylodogenic protein responsible for Dialysis Related Amyloidosis a disorder resulting in severe movement impairment. Aiming to understand the structural determinants of b2m aggregation propensity, we have characterised the role of the DE loop in the monomeric b2m. Mutations in such loop revealed that modifying the geometry of the DE loop has global effects on b2m: such mutations affect b2m folding, fold stability, structure, amyloidogenic propensity and dynamics under native and denaturating conditions. Such effects have been studied by several techniques such as X-ray crystallography, circular dichroism, intrinsic fluorescence, mass spectrometry and infrared spectroscopy1-7. In order to shed light on the structural details of b2m aggregation, a strategy to form artificial oligomers amenable for crystallographic studies have been designed and it will be shown together with the structures of two artificial oligomers and their propensity to form amyloid fibrils8. Finally ssNMR experiments on double and triple labelled samples of crystalline and fibrillar b2m will be presented9. In particular spectra of crystalline and aggregated b2m reveal that the most In plant cells, soluble proteins reach vacuoles because they contain vacuolar sorting determinants (VSDs) that are recognized by vacuolar sorting receptor (VSR) proteins. All VSR proteins contain an N-terminal lumenal region which is responsible for specific receptor-cargo interactions. The protease-associated (PA) domain contained in this region is believed to be involved in sequence-specific recognition of the Asn-Pro-Ile-Arg (NPIR) motif of cargo-proteins such as aleurain. However, how VSR proteins recognize their cargo-proteins is still poorly understood. In this study, the PA domain of VSR isoform-1 from Arabidopsis thaliana (AtVSR1-PA) will be investigated at both structural and functional levels to address this fundamental question of plant cells. In our recent studies, the PA domain of AtVSR1 (AtVSR1-PA) has been expressed and purified from E. coli. Typical yield of proteins was ~ 2 mg per liter of bacterial culture, which provides sufficient quantity of protein samples for subsequent structural and ligandbinding studies. We show that the purified AtVSR1-PA is properly folded as it can bind the proaleurain peptide in vitro. Preliminary crystallization conditions were identified by screening commercially available kits, and optimized by grid-searching the pH and precipitant concentrations. AtVSR1-PA was crystallized in space group P21. Diffraction data to 1.7\u00c5 were collected using an in-house X-ray source. In order to overcome the crystallographic phase problem, experimental phasing and molecular-replacement have been applied. After solving the phase problem, preliminary structure determination of AtVSR1-PA revealed that conserved residues of AtVSR1-PA are clustered in one region of the protein. We hypothesize that these conserved residues form a ligand-binding surface for recognition. The rules derived from our studies will be useful in predicting potential cargo-proteins within the genomes of Arabidopsis or other model organisms in the future.

            "text": "Evolution of protein sequence hydrophobicity Ian Borukhovich, Matthew Cordes University of Arizona, 1510 E9th street #101, Tucson, AZ, 85719Studies of natural and model proteins suggest that sequences of foldable proteins are constrained in the local and global distribution of polar and hydrophobic residues, possibly to enhance conformational specificity of the native state. To explore how such a constraint might manifest itself in the evolution of individual protein families, we performed two analyses. First, for 12 common protein families, we compared the standard deviation of local sequence hydropathy in all individual sequences in each family to the same quantity in sets of simulated sequences generated by vertical shuffling of a multiple alignment. In most families, median hydropathy deviations in unshuffled sequences are lower than those of shuffled sequences according to a Wilcoxon rank sum test (P < .05). Second, mutual information analysis of each family showed significant anticorrelation between polar and hydrophobic residues at a relatively small subset of covarying positions. Sequence evolution may favor balanced distributions of hydrophobic and polar residues along a chain, and certain sequence positions may contribute disproportionately to this trend.The application and development of network principles to protein modeling have led to significant advancement in understanding the underlying determinants of protein folds. In this work, we will use a modified version of the network principle 'degrees of separation' we term 'levels of separation' (LOS) to provide insight into the evolution of protein folds. In specific, we propose that long-range tertiary interactions between the transition and native state form in LOS. Rationalizing the formation of longrange interactions in this way provides a means for understanding the mechanism by which the formation of the native tertiary structure can be obtained from the transition-state. We present a theoretical model that visualizes how a protein may fold through a sequence of modifications of the transition state to the native state facilitated by LOS. Our approach is interdisciplinary and unites the fields of network theory, mathematics and biochemistry. A number of proteins are being studied.

TDP-43 has multiple cellular functions, including serving as a transcriptional repressor and functioning as a splicing factor. The domain structure of TDP-43 is similar to the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNP), consisting of two tandem RNA recognition domains, RRM1 and RRM2, followed by a C-terminal glycine-rich region. TDP-43 has been the focus of extensive studies since it had been identified as the major pathological protein in the neuronal inclusions in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). TDP-43 inclusions are N-terminally truncated 25-kDa fragments, which contain partial RRM2 domain and glycine rich region. The pathogenic mechanism of how the normal functional TDP-43 is truncated and induced to abnormal filamentous inclusions remains unknown. To investigate the domain organization of TDP-43, we analyzed the domain assembly of various TDP-43 constructs by small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), dynamic light scattering (DLS) and gel filtration chromatography. Together with GST pull-down assays, we showed that TDP-43 dimerized in a head-to-head arrangement, with the two RRM2 domains flanking outward. This model suggests how TDP-43 is assemble into a functional protein and provides a structural basis for the future study of TDP-43 proteinopathy.",

Recently, it is reported that GATA-6 is abnormally overexpressed in many clinical tissue samples of gastrointestinal cancers. GATA-6 being expressed in colorectal cancer cells accelerates cell proliferation and degrades upon apoptotic response. However, the molecular mechanisms are not well known how degradation of GATA-6 is regulated. We have previously reported that GATA-6 stably expressed in CHO-K1 cells is degradated by proteasomes in cytoplasm through cAMP dependent protein kinase A (PKA) signaling. However the substitution in the potential PKA site of GATA-6 Ser-290\u2192Ala had no effect on degradation, suggesting that intracellular factors phosphorylated by PKA may be involved in GATA-6 degradation, and other protein kinases, except for PKA, may affect the degradation pathway. In this study, we compared 95 kinase inhibitors since we are expecting that there are multiple cross-talks between PKA and different kinases not being examined by us. Actually we identified 5 kinase inhibitors that prohibit protein kinases other than PKA. Interestingly, we found that SP600125, a JNK inhibitor, strongly inhibited cAMP-dependent proteolysis of GATA-6 and that anisomycin which can activate JNK via endoplasmic reticulum stress response stimulated proteolysis of GATA-6 as well as dbcAMP treatment. Furthermore, we found that anisomycin promoted the export of GATA-6 from nucleus to cytoplasm via CRM1-mediated nuclear export pathway. It seems likely that the JNK activated by anisomycin may stimulate not only the nuclear export of GATA-6 through CRM1 but also the degradation of GATA-6 by cytoplasmic proteasomes. In contrast, A-kinase might activate only the latter process through JNK. Our finding that nuclear GATA-6 is exported to cytoplasm through activation of JNK signaling would be beneficial as a therapeutic approach to regulate the localization of GATA-6 in colorectal cancer cells. The Pellino proteins are one of the several families of E3 ubiquitin ligases that direct ubiquitination events immediately following Toll and interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) activation. Polyubiquitination of known Pellino substrates, such as the interleukin-1 associated kinase (IRAK1), is a necessary step in mediating downstream signaling events that are responsible for eliciting a proper immune response. To elucidate Pellino's role in TIR signaling, we are investigating the molecular basis of Pellino substrate specificity. We previously Abstracts 234 Vibrio cholerae is the causative pathogen for cholera. Fatty acid synthesis enzymes (FAS) from V. cholerae are good targets for developing antibiotics against cholera. Here we report the structural and enzymatic studies of \u03b2-ketoacyl-(acyl carrier protein) reductase in the FAS pathway of V. cholerae (vcFabG). FabG catalyzes the essential reductive reaction in the elongation cycle of fatty acid synthesis using NADPH as cofactor. It was observed that some FabGs require binding of NADP(H) to induce the conformation changes from the closed/inactive form to open/active form, which is characterized by the formation of a catalytic triad composed of a set of conserved residues (S142, Y155, K159 in vcFabG). But it was not clear which elements enable the conformational changes of FabG upon cofactor binding. In our study, we obtained several crystal structures of vcFabG which are either in active or inactive forms. Comparison of the vcFabG structures in active and inactive conformations revealed that the binding of NADP(H) induces conformation changes which comprise the rearrangement of loop \u03b24-\u03b14, loop \u03b25-\u03b15, helix \u03b16 and C-terminus. Structure of ternary complexes of vcFabG (soaked with NADPH and Acetoacetyl CoA (AcAcCoA)) showed that this NADP(H) induced rearrangement not only results in the formation of the catalytic triad, but also leads to the proper assemblage of substrate binding residues. This observation is consistent with results from isothermal titration calorimetric (ITC) assays that vcFabG could only bind substrate AcAcCoA in the presence of NADPH. Detailed inspection about the vcFabG structures, together with those of homolog proteins identified two glycine residues which might serve as switch points for changes between inactive/active states of FabG. Kinetic assays revealed that mutations of these glycine residues eliminate the enzymatic activity. ITC assays revealed that the mutations abolish the capability of vcFabG to bind NADPH and AcAcCoA, even though the mutant might also adopt an \"open/active\" conformation. Conclusion: Two glycine residues serve as switches between inactive/active states of vcFabG upon binding of NADP(H). Heme Oxygenase (HO) is the only known mammalian enzyme that catalyzes degradation of heme. While heme is a required prosthetic group in several electron transfer and redox enzymes and thus inevitable for various physiological processes; free heme can be commensurably toxic. Free heme can undergo fentonlike reactions, producing reactive oxygen species, which in turn induces oxidative stress and cell death. By degrading free heme, HO confers tissue protection. Two forms of HO have been identified in mammals: HO-1 and HO-2. Both HO-1 and HO-2 exhibit similar catalytic properties, however they are expressed in distinct locations in the body and differ in their modes of regulation. While HO-1 is present in most tissues, HO-2 has a narrow tissue distribution and is expressed mainly in brain, testes and carotid body. Additionally, HO-1 is induced under conditions of ischemia, hypoxia and hyperoxia while HO-2 is constitutively expressed. To date, HO-1 has been extensively studied structurally and biochemically and its mechanism of regulation is well characterized. HO-2, on the other hand needs further investigation on how heme binding is regulated. At the sequence level, HO-1 and HO-2 are highly homologous (55% identity, 76% similarity). A significant difference in the sequence lies between residues 240-295 (HO-2 numbering). In this region, HO-2 unlike HO-1, contains two short amino acid stretches comprising a Cys-Pro dipeptide referred to as the heme regulatory motif (HRM). Besides, HO-1 lacks the first 30 amino acid residues present at the N-terminus of HO-2. Earlier studies in our lab have demonstrated that the affinity of HO-2 for heme is regulated by redox conditions. Precisely, the oxidation state of cysteines in HRMs was shown to play a role in modulating the ability of HO-2 to bind heme, which indicated an essential physiological function of HRMs. It therefore becomes imperative to understand the mechanism of HO-2 regulation and in particular address the impact of changes in the oxidation state of HRMs on the overall structure of HO-2. Using NMR and EXAFS, we have now shown that an otherwise disordered C-terminal tail docks onto the core of HO-2 juxtaposed to the heme-binding site, when HRMs in this region exist in the sulfhydryl state. This may explain a decrease in heme affinity of HO-2 under reducing conditions to be the result of a plausible replacement of water network at the distal end of heme with a transient thiolate interaction.",
