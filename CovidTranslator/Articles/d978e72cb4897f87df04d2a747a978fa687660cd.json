This is equivalent to a CAGR of 3.6% on average. Other traffic projections, for example, Airbus (2017) or Boeing (2017) foresee healthy growth rates in a corridor between 4% and 5%, more toward the higher end regarding the short to medium range and toward the lower end for the longer term. Airports Council International (ACI, 2016) is forecasting an even higher rate of 4.9% for passengers (and 2.3% for air cargo as well as 2.5% for aircraft movements) in the long term up to 2040. Based on the regional trend described above, this scenario results in a tremendous change in passenger market shares, as displayed in Fig. 1.4 . The uneven regional growth rates (cf. Fig. 1 .2) are set to continue, primarily due to market maturity and GDP growth. While this will provide superior growth perspectives to airports in the Asia-Pacific region, the overall outlook is very positive across the board. Regardless of the slightly different projections, volumes will more or less double during the next 20 years. Against this background, IATA is expecting that almost all of the world's top 100 airports require major infrastructure expansion during this period. Moreover, there could be 100 more slot coordinated airports within 10 years' time already. That is in addition to the 189 Level 3 and 122 Level 2 airports (with some peak congestion) as of November 2017. All regions are concerned by this challenge, although Europe is in the limelight of this infrastructure shortage (Garcia, 2018; Gittens, 2018; Clark et al., 2018) . In order to accommodate for this growth scenario, adequate infrastructure is required both in the air and on the ground-substantially beyond current plans to expand capacity. Otherwise, Eurocontrol (2018) is afraid that according to their most likely scenario, there will be around 1.5 million flights more in demand than can be accommodated by 2040, and 166 million passengers will be unable to fly. It also means that the number of airports operating near capacity during most of the day, as it is the case at London Heathrow (LHR), for example, will rise from six in summer 2016 to then sixteen.",

The direct effects may be measured in employment and income resulting from the local airport operations, including the operator itself, other service providers, agencies, and the airlines. While indirect impacts refer to employment and economic activities linked to supplying the air transport industry, induced effects comprise employment and activity supported by the spending of air transport employees, for example, suppliers of goods and services purchased by employees. Usually, their combined effect is being measured by the economic multiplier. The multiplier concept incorporates the spendings of direct employees as well as employees of supplying companies. Finally, airports also support attracting and sustaining business development outside of air transport. These spin-off effects primarily materializing in the tourism and travel and trade industries are termed to be the catalytic impact (ACI Europe, 2015; Air Transport Action Group, ATAG, 2018).",

Airports have to deal with numerous local issues regarding noise, air quality, waste management, and other environmental concerns, as well as the policies resulting from these matters. Eurocontrol (2017) explains the various environmental topics connected to aviation. With air transportation serving the growing needs for the traveling public, aviation, at the same time, encumbers costs or detriments onto society and nature. These main adversities, harming the environment, are identified as aircraft noise, air pollution, climate change, third party risks, and aviation emissions. Aircraft noise is a fundamental harm to people living close to the airport, complaining about noise disturbances, especially during nighttime periods. The \"balanced approach\" presents a means to undertake noise management procedures at airports and implicates the reduction of noise at the source, land-use planning and management measures, noise mitigation procedures, and operational restrictions. The most remarkable aviation emissions responsible for local air pollution are oxides of nitrogen and carbon monoxide.",

The former was successfully implemented in Europe a number of years ago and went global in November 2014. The program certifies airports at four different levels of accreditation covering all stages of carbon management: mapping, reduction, optimization, and neutrality. As of spring 2018, more than 200 airports in more than 60 countries across all regions have actually reached the fourth stage of carbon neutrality. The CEM, on the other hand, was only launched in 2014 and is limited to Europe, but includes aircraft operators, air navigation service providers, and trade associations in addition to airport operators. Its objective is to facilitate the already existing activities of these core operational stakeholders by increasing their awareness of the various interdependencies. This, in turn, is to support sustainable airport development as an essential element for improving air transport movements capacity and flight efficiency (Bates, 2017; Eurocontrol, 2014 ).",

More rarely, additional charges fall due for aircraft emissions and the usage of centralized infrastructure, such as baggage sorters and underground fueling system. Ground handling services are not necessarily provided by the airport operator but frequently by third parties. The latter case will then generate commercial income based on a concession fee paid by the handling agent. Also fuel charges are usually not collected by the airport but levied by the fuel companies. Government taxes bypass the airport operator in general. While Chapter 3, Measuring the financial position, will give an example of a table of charges and Chapter 10, Regulatory regime, will add pricing aspects, it is worthwhile stating two relevant principles stipulated by ICAO's (2012) \"Policies on Charges for Airports and Air Navigation Services\": First, the \"user pays principle,\" which means to say that users should bear the full and fair cost for the provision of required infrastructure; second, airport charges are essentially cost based (LeighFisher, 2017) .",

This, for sure, includes easy access to and processing at the airport for boarding their flight (Ascend, 2014) . In order to address this demand, airports provide the required infrastructure and offer a wide range of services and amenities. The latter are frequently provided by third parties instead of the airport operators themselves.

This appears to be mandatory, as Copenhagen Economics (CE, 2012) confirmed by Oxera (2017) found that: These findings apply primarily to small ,10 million passengers per annum (mppa) and medium sized airports, while larger ones .40 mppa are affected more by competition for transfer passengers. In general, airports are competing for any additional traffic in terms of passengers and cargo, particularly for: G passengers in a shared local market, G connecting passengers, and G airline services on new and existing routes (Oxera, 2017) .Although the focus of this research was on Europe, it can be concluded from the wide-spread granting of commercial incentives to airlines across regions that airport competition has become a worldwide phenomenon in the meantime. Various enticements have actually developed into a major tool of airport marketing, in addition to putting their products to the shop-window at the different \"Routes Conferences.\" Feature 10.1 will discuss the competitive situation in the sector in more detail.",
