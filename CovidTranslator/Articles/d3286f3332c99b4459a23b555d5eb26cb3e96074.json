            "text": "The question as to why ferrets were domesticated may be more easily answered than when the domestication process took place and from what molecular phylogeny. This is in part because of the scarcity of written records from 2000 years ago and because of diffi culties in identifi cation of which species was actually being domesticated. Vernacular names for the animal we presume to be the ferret frequently varied from geographic district to district, and ancient scientists may have added to the confusion with incorrect translations from one language to another. 43 Domestication is the process by which human selection and control of breeding results in an animal that provides a service or product that is benefi cial to humans. With time, domestication results in physical and physiologic changes from the ancestral species. Animals are domesticated for work, food, or materials for clothing and shelter. Ferrets were in all probability originally used by man to control vermin. The earliest written account of an animal that fi ts the description of our domesticated ferret dates back to the Greek satiric writer Aristophanes (448-385 BC), who used the term \"house ferret\" in several of his plays to satirize political opponents. Soon thereafter, in 350 BC, the Greek philosopher and naturalist Aristotle (384-322 BC) also made written reference in a treatise on animals and physiognomy to a polecat that \"resembles a weasel; and becomes very mild and tame.\" 43 It is reasonable to suppose he was referring to the ferret, and the demeanor of the animal described implies a close association with people. These early written accounts coincide with the time (circa 300 BC) when agriculture began to take hold in the civilized regions of the northern Mediterranean region centered around present-day Greece. One theory suggests the Greeks domesticated the indigenous European polecat (Mustela putorius) in order to protect grain stores from rodent infestation much in the way the Egyptians domesticated the cat.",

This may explain why certain ferrets will eat only one type of diet and why kits exposed to only one brand of food at 60 to 90 days of age may be opposed to dietary changes later in life.

Kelliher and Baum 22 showed that in the ferret, olfactory detection and processing of volatile odors from conspecifi cs is required for heterosexual mate choice. 22 Males perform more body rubbing than females (jills), especially during the breeding season. Anal drags leave an olfactory signature of anal sac secretion for intersexual and intrasexual communication. Olfactory marking behavior also communicates territoriality and gives other ferrets knowledge of the marking ferret's sex and hormonal activity. Wiping and rubbing actions release the ferret's general body odor and may act as a threat signal in agonistic encounters. 10 The response to olfactory stimuli and the scent-marking behavior of domestic ferrets is much less pronounced than that of their undomesticated counterparts. Domestic ferrets retain the actions of marking that are so important to their wild relatives. 39 The ferret thrives in the company of other ferrets; readily sharing living quarters, hammocks in which they sleep, food bowls, and water bottles. Despite this harmony, ferrets are still instinctively territorial and lay claim to smaller, albeit signifi cant territories within their home environment. Like the wild polecat, domestic ferrets back up and defecate on objects or certain areas (and some even anal drag after defecation) in order to mark their territory. The domestic ferret tends to choose corners in which to defecate that may represent territory perimeters.",

When it backs into a cage corner to relieve itself, pick it up and place it in the corner of the litter box. w Provide a large litter box that takes up most of the bottom of the cage. This is more likely to encourage use of the box. Punch holes in the litter box and wire it to the cage walls so that it can't be tipped over. w Offer praise and food treats when your ferret uses the box. w To discourage digging use newspaper strips in the litter box, and slowly add a little bit of litter. Over a week or more gradually add more litter and less newspaper. Most ferrets learn not to play in the litter fairly quickly. Newspaper doesn't deter odors, so it needs to be changed often. w Buy a ferret-friendly litter box with one low side and a guard on the higher sides to prevent the ferret from backing up far enough to miss the box. w Clean soiled corners, inside or outside the cage, with an appropriate pet odor neutralizer such as Urine-Off or Eliminodor. w Provide litter boxes in corners of rooms ferrets are allowed to explore. More than one litter box is ideal. If your ferret seems to prefer a certain corner, place the litter box there. w Ferrets do not bury their stool as cats do; therefore only a shallow layer of litter to cover the bottom of the litter box is needed. Avoid fi ne clumping litters as they are messy and dusty, potentially resulting in respiratory problems. w Recycled newspaper litter or plain clay litter are good choices. Avoid scented litters, as ferrets may avoid them. w Change the litter box(es) often to encourage use. w Most ferrets won't soil their beds or food bowls. Place bedding or food dishes in all non-litter box corners of the cage. Bedding that has been slept in and retains the ferret's body scent works best. w Before out-of-the-cage play, place your ferret in the cage's clean litter box.",

At the point of penetration the male will increase the arch of his back anteriorly, causing his foreleg grip to slip behind the female's rib cage. 30 Holding this position for a variable but usually prolonged period of time is the best interpretation of penetration, at which time pelvic thrusting ceases. Occasionally the male will tense his pelvis, causing the tail to raise for short periods of time. At this time the female will occasionally fl inch or remain fl accid. 30 Variable mating times from 120 minutes to 3 hours have been reported, but in one study mating times recorded in 10 pairs of ferrets lasted from 34 to 172 minutes. 30 These prolonged intromissions appear necessary in order to ensure fertilization. Whether this is to allow for increased sperm deposition as a result of the multiple ejaculations of the male or if it is necessary to stimulate the LH surge and subsequent ovulation in the female is open to debate.

The interplay of experience and innate* factors in the development of behavior is very subtle and can be diffi cult to separate. 16 European polecat kits are dependent on their mothers to bring them meat meals from the time they are weaned at 6 to 8 weeks to the time they begin to hunt on their own at 10 weeks of age. During this preweaning time kits have been observed to interact socially and play. 24 However, by the time they are 13 weeks old, a time when kits may leave their nests permanently and go out on their own, kits show various degrees of independence from one another. 24 Adult polecats are essentially solitary, with one study fi nding ferrets to share dens simultaneously with other fer rets on only 7.4% of 706 radio-tracking events. 36 Also, adult ferrets *Innate behaviors are those that do not seem to require specifi c experiences (learning) for their expression. demonstrate intrasexual territoriality, with dominant males showing more spatial overlap with females than with subordinate males. 29 The domesticated ferret, on the other hand, shows much more diurnal activity, and many can be kept in pairs or groups without confl ict. The best explanation for the difference in socialization patterns is that familiarization and habituation* play a signifi cant role in the ferret's social response to both man and conspecifi cs. Familiarization in the form of imprinting may be involved as young polecats removed from their mothers during this critical phase in their development (4 to 10 weeks) become imprinted on their human caretakers. Evidence to support this belief is the fact that young polecats follow their mother on foraging expeditions and that hand-reared ferrets readily follow a human being. It has also been shown that the presence of the mother appears to facilitate the development of fear of humans in the young. 34 In captivity, however, fear of humans does not develop in wild polecats if they are removed from their mother at any time before the second day after their eyes have opened (typically 28 to 34 days). 34 Socialized ferrets are also more likely to show habituation than isolated ferrets, 9 demonstrating that socialization and domestication go hand in hand. Pet ferrets acclimate to their environment and will rise to the occasion when given an opportunity to play, explore, or interact with others. In other words, they become diurnal as their periods of activity coincide with that of their human household.",

In all higher animals a sudden change or stimulation will usually elicit a movement toward the source-a response described as the orientation response. The learning of an orientational component plays an important role in the development of functional sequences of behavior. Eibl-Eibesfeldt observed the preycatching techniques of polecats and found that the normal movements of pursuit, grasping the neck of the prey, shaking it, and turning it over on its back occur the fi rst time an appropriate object is presented. 19 After several experiences the neck bite becomes properly oriented for quick killing of prey. More recently, similar behavior was demonstrated in the black-footed ferret in which maturation, experience, and greater environmental complexity (enriched cage, including encouragement of foodsearching behaviors) all increased the likelihood of the ferret's making a successful kill. 44 This behavior becomes important when the domestic ferret is kept in a household with other exotic pets that it may perceive as prey. It is at this time that the ferret may cross the line from play behavior to prey-catching behavior. Both behaviors can look similar initially, as ferrets at play also demonstrate neck biting, but if stimulated by a perceived prey species (pet bird, lizard, or rodent) the ferret may instinctively go beyond play and infl ict harmful or fatal bite wounds on the other pet. Therefore, ferrets should not be left unsupervised with other small exotic pets.",

The ferret also shows persistent response to repeated auditory stimuli, a feature that might also be related to the reactivity typical of a juvenile animal. These results again appear to support Lorenz's view that domesticated animals show more juvenile behavior as compared with their wild counterparts. 19 Ehrlich's work with the black-footed ferret 15 demonstrated similar fi ndings: increased handling (equivalent to greater degree of domestication) leads to increased exploration behavior. Those fi ndings may explain why today's domestic ferret shows an intense curiosity and little fear of its surroundings. When allowed to roam, the domestic ferret shows fearless exploratory behavior: The domestication process has been thorough at removing the ferret's fear response when it comes to exploratory behavior, and the ferret's inquisitive nature and love of exploration are boundless, sometimes to its detriment. As a result of being continuously handled and carried securely without being dropped, or perhaps because of its reportedly poor eyesight, domestic ferrets show little fear of height. This is opposite to what Shimbo 39 found in her personal experience with undomesticated polecats, which appeared very frightened and uneasy when exposed to heights. 39 This apparent lack of fear of heights in the domestic ferret can result in injuries or death if they climb out of an upstairs or apartment window. An open door may also be addressed with fearless curiosity, and the urge to explore can lead the ferret to the outdoors where it is limited in its ability to fi nd food and to protect itself from predators or from extremes of weather.",

True fi ghting behavior between domestic ferrets is similar to that described by Poole in his study of European polecats 33 -as an incident during which each animal attempted to bite the back of its opponent's neck with a sustained, immobilizing hold. Successful bites (i.e., those during which the opponent was unable to break free) were sometimes accompanied by shaking or dragging of the immobilized animal. When the attacked animal was able to break free, it sometimes displayed evidence of intimidation, including screaming, defensive biting, hissing, fl eeing, urinating, or defecating. However, serious injury did not usually occur. 40 Staton and Crowell-Davis 40 reported on the results of an experimental protocol to evaluate the effects of four factors on the fi ghting behavior between pairs of domestic ferrets: familiarity (pairings of cagemates versus strangers); time of year (pairings during winter versus spring); sex (male-male, male-female, and female-female pairings); and neutering status (intact-intact, neutered-intact, and neutered-neutered pairings). 40 Awareness of factors that might affect the potential for aggression between",

If kits are sold to pet retailers at a young age (some kits are placed in pet shops as early as 6 weeks of age), mother-kit socialization patterns may be disrupted. This lack of maternal nurturing can lead to overly stormy play behavior, which may be perceived as aggression by new owners. Keep in mind that the solitary pet ferret may perceive its human owner as its playmate, and nips, pokes, and attempted drags of arms or feet may be directed at him or her. Frequent handling in a quiet, subdued environment, along with behavior modifi cation in the form of positive reinforcements, time-outs, and counterconditioning, will all go a long way toward properly socializing these belligerent kits. Remember to never incorporate physical punishment into your behavioral modifi cation routine. This may cause a frightened or excited ferret to become even more frenzied, resulting in more intense and perhaps vicious biting. Also, ferrets may be sensitive to certain odors. Ferrets may react to sweet-smelling hand lotion or soaps by licking or nipping the wearer. Some ferrets love the smell or taste of nicotine and may react by biting the smoker's fi ngers.

The nonemergency physical examination begins with hands-off observation of the animal for any sensory signals that give an impression of overall health status. A few minutes of observing the ferret for behavioral signs of health or illness can disclose valuable information about overall patient well-being. A healthy ferret is alert and curious about its surroundings, demonstrating attentive and exploratory behaviors, and has bright, clear eyes and a smooth, shiny hair coat. Before initiating the physical examination in any ferret, healthy or sick, it is also important to observe for temperament; behavioral signs of friendliness, fear, or potential aggression. A ferret that leans forward with interest, using its sense of smell to explore an outstretched hand, is usually a normal, friendly, inquisitive ferret.",
