For example, automated systems for the detection and identification of microorganisms and for the identification of resistant organisms have been developed 2 . These include automated blood-culture assays and systems for the phenotypic identification of bacteria. Antibiotic-sensitivity testing and computerized interpretation systems have also been developed 3 . These developments have not led to significant changes in the microbiology itself, but rather enable more samples to be processed by fewer personnel and provide increased intra-and inter-laboratory reproducibility. Similar developments have been seen with immunoassays: enzyme-linked immunosorbant assays (ELISAs) have been extensively automated and standardized in recent years and have also become cheaper. Many of the automated tests that are now available were initially designed for the mass testing of blood that is destined for blood banks, but later innovations led to western blots for the confirmation of HIV infection and Lyme disease and the development of tests for the rapid detection of anti-HIV antibodies in saliva or blood 2 . Worldwide -mainly because of the cost of containment measures for infectious diseases -there has been a general tendency over the past 10 years to centralize clinical microbiology laboratories such that they serve several hospitals, therefore maximizing the efficiency of testing at the lowest cost 4 . However, such centralization of clinical microbiology laboratories can result in a lack of consultation between physicians and clinical scientists.",

This procedure is now available in many large university hospital laboratories and is also carried out by new companies in the private sector. Genetic testing can also be used to identify DNA sequences that are associated with antimicrobial resistance. Viral loads can also be determined by PCR and this has been found to be a useful method for evaluating antiviral therapies. Finally, molecular methods allow typing of microorganisms, which can help to analyse the epidemiology of outbreaks and identify their sources, as well as distinguishing between relapse and re-infection in the case of persisting microorganisms.

The sequences of some of these genes -for example, rpoB (which encodes the RNA polymerase \u03b2-subunit) 9 and the SIGMA-FACTOR genes 10 -differ between bacterial species and can therefore be used for bacterial identification. Large databases of the sequences of these genes are now available. For eukaryotes, the 18S rRNA gene has also been used as a 'universal' gene and there is an increasing number of 18S rRNA sequences in databases 11 .

Different gene sequences enable different levels of identification. Depending on the gene that is used, the genus, species, subspecies or even strain of an organism can be established. When it is crucial to determine whether one or more clinical isolates are of the same strain, a comparison of several genome sequences might be required. Such studies have identified highly variable genome fragments and have led to the development of several techniques, including MULTILOCUS SEQUENCE TYPING 13 . Similar identification tools have also been developed for fungi 14 and protozoa 15 . Other sequence-based typing techniques have used intergenic, non-coding spacer sequences 16 that are more likely to be variable. The one that has been the most widely used is the 16S-23S intergenic spacer for bacteria 16 and the INTERNAL TRANSCRIBED SPACER (ITS) for fungi 17 . Specific, fully automated bioinformatics microbiology 5 . The use of molecular-biology techniques has dramatically changed clinical microbiology and the integration of the two disciplines is an important challenge for the future. In addition to detecting well-known pathogens, the laboratories of the future will also have to be able to recognize new pathogens and participate in food-safety monitoring and bioterrorism surveillance 4 . Recent experience has shown the necessity for laboratories to be able to rapidly develop diagnostic tests for new diseases that have a high social impact, as was the case with the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Means must also be available for the rapid transfer of such technology to laboratories in which routine diagnostics are carried out. A current problem is that scientific responses to emerging threats are far more rapid than are administrative responses, and there are often prolonged delays in the approval of new diagnostic tests for use outside research laboratories.",

The development of molecular beacons and other fluorescent probes (such as the TaqMan\u00ae probe that is produced by Roche Molecular Systems, Inc.) has made real-time monitoring of PCR amplification and quantification of nucleic acids in clinical specimens possible 21 . Beacons are hairpinshaped oligonucleotide probes that have a fluorophore that emits photons and is closely associated with a quencher, which absorbs the photons. In the presence of a complementary strand of DNA, the hairpin structure unfolds and fluorescence is emitted, and this can be measured to determine the amount of DNA that is present. Multiple targets can be monitored 22 using fluorophores with different emission spectra. This technology, which is highly sensitive, is commercially available as the TaqMan \u00ae (Applied Biosystems; Perkin-Elmer Corp.) and LightCycler \u00ae (Roche Diagnostics Corp.) systems. The advantages of real-time PCR are the rapidity of the assay (30-40 min), the ability to quantify and identify PCR products directly without the use of agarose gels, and the fact that contamination of the nucleic acids can be limited. Kits are available for the detection and quantification of DNA and RNA in clinical samples, and the technique has been specifically developed to enable the follow-up of patients with HIV and hepatitis C infections (Amplitech AME Bioscience; Bayer Diagnostics; Roche Diagnostics). Microscopy. Microscopy techniques have evolved with respect to three factors: the nature of the signal, the user-friendliness of the equipment, and the digitalization and computerized processing of the image. Electron microscopes -which were once complicated instruments that were only used in research -have been simplified and are now increasingly being used in clinical microbiology laboratories. They are useful for the rapid screening of routine clinical samples, such as stool samples, and also for detecting viruses in tissue cultures. With negative staining, a viral pathogen can be identified within 10 minutes of the arrival of a clinical or tissue-culture specimen in an electronmicroscopy laboratory 43 . Electron microscopy was used to rapidly identify Bacillus anthracis during the recent anthrax letters attack in the United States 43 and also to identify the genus (Coronavirus) of the SARS virus. The implementation of new technologies, such as automated pattern recognition 44 , remote operation of microscopes and telemicroscopy -which uses digital image acquisition and review of images through the internet 45 -will further increase the usefulness of electron microscopy.",

The indirect diagnosis of infectious diseases by the detection of specific antibodies will continue to be a key approach for clinical microbiologists. Both individual, ready-to-use assays that would be available in the doctor's surgery and platform tests for high-throughput screening and diagnosis could be developed.'At-doctor' serology tests would be useful for the rapid determination of the status of a patient and for speedy decision-making regarding post-exposure prophylaxis and treatment. In addition, the rapid detection of specific IgMs during epidemics could help to improve isolation measures for patients who are suspected to be infected. Antigenic microarrays will enable testing for several pathogens in parallel using little serum and few reagents. All the pathogens that are known to be causative agents of a particular clinical syndrome could therefore be tested for simultaneously using an antigenic microarray. Moreover, the versatility of this new assay will allow emerging pathogens to be quickly incorporated into the test. Future developments in antigenic microarray technology will include the development of automation for the indirect diagnosis of infectious diseases. The microarray apparatus could be fully automated up to the result output; generation of output would be rapid, as the overall process will probably take less than 2 hours, and automated For serological studies, antigen-coated microspheres can be incubated with sera, and a fluorescence-conjugated antibody against human IgG added in a second step. FCM can then be used to detect the fluorescent microspheres 47 . FCM can also simultaneously detect antibodies to more than one antigen by coating different antigens on different-sized particles. FCM can even analyse the antibody response to HIV by simultaneously detecting specific antibodies to the various antigens of the virus.",

The activity of the clinical microbiologist would therefore be re-oriented towards the evaluation and interpretation of tests, including the determination of their sensitivity, specificity and predictive values; communication of results to clinicians, in particular, infectious-disease specialists; advising on antibiotic therapy and sampling strategy in conjunction with infectious-disease specialists; following trends in disease epidemiology and reporting these trends to infection-control departments; coordinating the work of pictures can be e-mailed to clinicians for incorporation into the patient's medical records.",

The ongoing technological revolution has rapidly transformed research, diagnostic and therapeutic tools. However, there is still a requirement for the reliability and the standardization of sampling and biological testing to be increased as information is exchanged internationally. In future, the organization of clinical microbiology laboratories will probably follow that of other areas of the life sciences -that is, with large centralized laboratories and a local head. The position and the role of experts in clinical microbiology processes will become an important question. The interpretation of diagnostic tests can require different levels of expertise. The predictive value of a test depends on its intrinsic quality and on the prevalence of the disease in the population. Therefore, the final interpretation relies on both the microbiologist and the physician. In some instances, the indications of the clinical and epidemiological data to the laboratory will make it possible for a diagnosis to be made.In other cases, communication of the intrinsic values of the test (for example, sensitivity and specificity) might allow an infectious-disease specialist to make a diagnosis on-site (FIG. 1) . Finally, the need for consultation on rare diseases with experts around the world using the Internet will increase. In our experience, we receive queries about the diagnosis and treatment for Whipple's disease and Q fever several times a week. Such queries for assistance will probably increase in number as experts in particular fields become more readily identified by physicians, and even patients, through the Internet.",

This includes pictures taken during clinical examinations when cutaneous signs are present, light-, confocal-and electronmicroscopy pictures, and images of microarray analyses. Although it is still rare, microbiology reports can be enhanced with digital images of the organisms that are involved. The inclusion of digital photographs of Gram-stain and acid-fast-stain preparations is technically possible, and precedents for providing such images have already been set by current pathology and radiology information systems. Picture digitalization enables information to be sent instantly by e-mail. The feasibility of using static-image telepathology to assess Gram-stained microbiological preparations has been evaluated positively, although the selection of informative microscopic fields before their transmission was a prerequisite for success 73 . A major application of these images is that they can be used to obtain expert advice. This is of particular importance with P3 emerging and re-emerging agents and with group A and B agents of bioterrorism. In such cases, microbial agents must be confined in secure laboratories, but their digital images can be freely exchanged. The e-mailing of digital pictures was recently helpful in the management of patients with suspected smallpox or anthrax. In a patient presenting with multiple haemorrhagic vesicles on the face, anonymous digital pictures of the clinical features were e-mailed to the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to obtain an expert opinion 74 and the usefulness of such pictures was emphasized during the SARS outbreak 75 .
