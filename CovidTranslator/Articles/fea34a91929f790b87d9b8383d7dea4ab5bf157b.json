Most predictions suggest that this statistic is also set to rise further. Like many other imported infections it can be a diagnostic challenge. Cases of malaria often present as a 'fever in a returning traveller', which is a heterogeneous group of diseases. Clinical assessment of imported infections has been recently reviewed by Spira. 5 Hospitals close to ports and major airports are traditionally accepted as seeing a disproportionate caseload of infections in returning travellers. We were interested in the caseload seen in a typical large UK hospital away from a major entry route since our impression was that the number of cases of imported infection seen in Cambridge is substantial. A five-year 'look-back' was therefore carried out.",

Cambridge is a University town in the Eastern Region with a population of around 120,000. The population catchment area of Addenbrooke's hospital is approximately 500,000, shared partly by two smaller district hospitals. There is a nearby international airport but with no transatlantic or longhaul flights. The ward is a 12-bedded dedicated infectious diseases unit in a large (1000 \u00fe bed) teaching hospital, which acts as a local district general hospital but is also the regional infectious diseases referral centre. Only cases directly seen, investigated and treated by the infectious diseases team were included. Outpatient cases seen in clinics only were excluded. Those infections which were self-limiting presenting to other physicians were not covered. Also excluded was an analysis of sexually transmitted infections acquired abroad seen only by the sexually transmitted disease service. All cases of malaria were diagnosed initially by blood films, though non-falciparum cases additionally had an HRP-2 antigen test to further rule out falciparum infection in the advent of a dual infection being overlooked.",

These infections pose a particular threat to public health and require considerable resources to manage. The newer definition of suspected MDRTB for all cases of tuberculosis acquired outside the UK, means numbers and need for isolation beds is certain to rise. The introduction of molecular techniques for the early detection of rifampicin resistance is a useful and cost effective advance. 6 Amongst the group of HIV diagnoses: one presented with a rash, fever and lymphadenopathy and was diagnosed with an HIV seroconversion illness and there were five children who acquired HIV through vertical transmission.",

Diagnosis and management of these conditions are optimised by having a specialist unit with experience. Individual physicians in nonspecialist units are unlikely to see these conditions frequently to become familiar with their management. Prevention is a key component of future efforts to contain these infections along with better diagnostics and enhanced surveillance. Hence, there is a requirement for expertise and the need for all large centres to have clinical infectious diseases staff. The UK is underprovided compared with most countries especially the USA but also closer comparators like Australia. The lack of prophylactic measures against malaria is very worrying. This suggests inadequate availability of advice or lack of knowledge by general practitioners and physicians or a lack of advice seeking by the general public. Over the past decade there have been 100 deaths from malaria in the UK, hence this is the most important area to target preventative efforts. 4 This merits a Department of Health driven education effort. The first steps have been taken with the formation of The National Travel Health Network and Centre, which is a government, funded initiative launched in 2003 in response to this need. 10 ",
