However, few studies have analysed the operational efficiency of AsiaePacific airports. This study therefore evaluated the operational efficiency of 21 AsiaePacific airports between 2002 and 2011. A two-stage method was used: Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) to assess airport efficiency, followed by the second-stage regression analysis to identify the key determinants of airport efficiency. The first-stage DEA results indicated that Adelaide, Beijing, Brisbane, Hong Kong, Melbourne, and Shenzhen are the efficient airports. The second-stage regression analysis suggested that percentage of international passengers handled by an airport, airport hinterland population size, dominant airline(s) of an airport when entering global airline strategic alliance, and an increase in GDP per capita are significant in explaining variations in airport efficiency.",

The growth is reflected by the increasing air traffic volumes handled by AsiaePacific airports. The Airport Council International (ACI) reported that several major AsiaePacific airports have been frequently ranked inside the world's top 30 busiest airports between . Moreover, ACI also projects that the announced growth rates for air cargo volumes and aircraft movements in the AsiaePacific region will reach 6.3% and 4.5%, respectively, by 2025 (ACI, 2007) . The International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) also estimates that the AsiaePacific region will become the busiest and fastest growing air transportation market for international passenger traffic by 2025 (ICAO, 2008) . Governments in the AsiaePacific region have therefore invested heavily and constructed airport infrastructure and facilities to meet projected future air transport demand (O'Connor, 1995) . However, airports are also under pressure from emerging competitors competing for air traffic demand. To respond to this pressure, airport efficiency has been identified as a critical issue facing airport management (Chin and Siong, 2001; Forsyth, 2003 , Talley, 1983 .",

            "text": "To investigate airport efficiency, Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) has become the recognised method for efficiency evaluation due to its simplicity in constructing an efficiency frontier for identifying efficient or inefficient airports (Gillen and Lall, 1997) . Also, the DEA model requires no assumptions for specifying production functions between airport inputs and outputs. The DEA model can also compute multiple airport inputs and outputs within a single analysis without any difficulties of aggregation, and can assess an airport's relative efficiency in a single period or in a sequence of periods as well as requiring less information for analysis (e.g. Cooper et al., 2006; Pels et al., 2001 Pels et al., , 2003 . Therefore, we first applied the DEA model to assess the operational efficiencies of AsiaePacific airports, and then the SimareWilson bootstrapping regression analysis to identify which factors significantly explain variations in airport efficiency. There are three primary reasons why this study is meaningful: (i) airports operating in the AsiaePacific region seem to be less researched compared with their counterparts in the US, Europe, and South America; (ii) this study contributes to the existing literature by analysing the efficiency of a large group of AsiaePacific airports (21 airports) \u00c0 the size of sampled airports in this study is a good reflection and representation of the airport industry in the AsiaePacific region due to their roles as the international or regional hub airports in their countries; and (iii) this study extends the work of Ha et al. (2010) , Lam et al. (2009) , and Yang (2010a,b) in assessing the operational efficiency of AsiaePacific airports and seeking to identify the causes of variations in airport efficiency.",

A clear understanding of which factors affect airport efficiency would provide insight to airport managers and policy makers for improving airport efficiency through benchmarking; that is, it would help to compare an airport's performance with its peers in the same region and improve its operations. The approach combining a first-stage DEA analysis and a second-stage Tobit model has become a popular method to identify those significant determinants.

For example, Barros and Dieke (2008) used the truncated bootstrapped regression to estimate the efficiency and identify the determinants of 31 Italian airports between 2001 and 2003. They found that the method to bootstrap the DEA efficiency scores with a truncated regression analysis can better explain DEA efficiency levels. Similarly, Barros (2008) employed the truncated bootstrapped regression analysis to analyse the efficiency of Argentinian airports during the period of intense economic crisis. Curi et al. (2011) also used the bootstrapping methodology to investigate 18 Italian airports. During the same year, Tsekeris (2011) used the truncated bootstrapped regression to assess the relative technical efficiency of Greek airports and investigate factors that determine airport efficiency. Merkert and Mangia (2012) also applied the bootstrapping two-stage DEA model to analyse 46 Norwegian airports' efficiency. employed the input-oriented DEA model and the SimareWilson bootstrapping approach to analyse the efficiency of regional airports worldwide, and suggested that the more sophisticated two-stage model can deliver powerful insights into the performance of regional airports. Tsui et al. (2014b) also utilised the slack-based measure (SBM) model, the Malmquist Productivity Index (MPI), and the SimareWilson bootstrapping methods to investigate the efficiency and productivity changes of 11 New Zealand airports for the period of 2010e2012.",

Table 2 shows the DEA estimation results categorising in three groups of airports with reference to changes in airport efficiency including the DEA efficiency indexes for each airport over the years and the percentage of efficient airports during each study year. Table 2 shows that at least 52% of AsiaePacific airports are considered as 'efficient' between 2002 and 2011. Six airports were found to be best performers over the entire study periods having consistently full DEA efficiency indexes (i.e. Adelaide, Beijing, Brisbane, Hong Kong, Melbourne, and Shenzhen). Of these, three were international hub airports (i.e. Beijing, Hong Kong, and Melbourne). This might be consistent with the concept that the international hub or gateway airports are able to attract and handle more air transport demand than the regional or non-hub airports, leading to higher efficiency. Also, their strategic roles and extensive flight connectivity networks reflect their ability to attract more international and domestic passenger traffic (i.e. originedestination traffic and connecting traffic). The full efficiency of Beijing and Hong Kong for all ten years may be explained by their respective air traffic volumes being consistently ranked inside the world's top 30 busiest passenger airports for the period of 2002e2011. The full efficiency levels of Brisbane throughout the study period may be due to its prime location for holiday travel to the principal Australian tourist attractionethe Gold Coast. For Shenzhen, its remarkable record may have been largely due to the rapid economic growth of the Pearl River Delta (PRD) region in Mainland China (particularly experiencing 103.4e187.8% growth for three airport outputs between 2002 and 2011).",

Overall, these airports either showed improvements (eight airports) or deteriorations (four airports) in their efficiency levels across the analysis periods, although there was no regular trend with respect to their respective efficiency levels. For the improving airports, in particular, Guangzhou deserves to be explored why its efficiency improved and it became efficient after 2007. Its rapid expansion improved the airport's flight connectivity network, covering more than 200 routes, which translated into an increase in airport traffic. In addition, Sydney was ranked as one of the world's top 30 busiest passenger airports in 2003, and its growth after 2003 could be attributable to its strategic role served as the main international gateway hub airport to and from Australasia and Oceania. In addition, Gimpo's inefficiency before 2010 was likely due to the opening of Incheon in 2000, which adversely affected its operations by attracting away international passenger and cargo traffic. 7 However, its three airport outputs achieved a 5.4e15.0% increase between 2010 and 2011, leading to its full efficiency level in 2011. Likewise, the decline in Jakarta's efficiency was likely related to the Bali bombings that occurred in 2002 and 2005 e these disruptive events had significant negative impacts on international visitors visiting Indonesia (Hitchcock and Putra, 2005) . In particular, Jakarta's positive air traffic growth after 2009 led to its full efficiency levels, with an average annual growth of air passenger numbers (10.6%), air cargo volumes (20.5%), and aircraft movements (8.9%), respectively.",

Interestingly, these three major international hub and gateway airports were considered to be the worst performers. One explanation might be largely related to the consequences of under-utilisation or over-investment in airport resources or high capacity airports handling lower amounts of air traffic. Indeed, further investigation revealed that Incheon and Kuala Lumpur's inefficiencies across the years did not result from recent expansions but from ongoing overcapacity. Likewise, part of the explanation of Singapore's under-utilisation is the result of its passenger terminal expansion in 2007, while its international passenger traffic only increased by less than 3% between 2007 and 2008 as well as between 2009 and 2010, respectively, leaving Singapore with significant excess capacity.",

Moreover, Kansai became inefficient after 2006 as an additional runway came into operation in 2007, 8 but its air traffic volumes did not respond with a significant increase accordingly. Passenger terminal expansion might contribute to the deteriorations in efficiency of Manila. Furthermore, Narita became inefficient between 2005 and 2006 as annual air passenger numbers and annual aircraft movements increased by less than 3%, 6 Wober (2007) indicated that the output-oriented model required a given level of inputs to achieve the maximum output levels. In this study, the DEA Output-Oriented model means that airports focus on maximising three categories of air traffic outputs (i.e. air passenger numbers, air cargo volumes, and aircraft movements), holding all of the airport inputs constant. It should be noted that the DEA efficiency indexes of AsiaePacific airports reported above were generally consistent with those reported in the extant literature. In particular, Hong Kong was claimed to be the most efficient airport during the study periods, and Incheon was also claimed to have the worst efficiency (Ha et al., 2010; Lam et al., 2009) . Kuala Lumpur and Singapore were also identified as inefficient airports (Yang, 2010b) , which was largely due to on-going overcapacity and the poor scale efficiency. Overall, the dissimilarity of DEA efficiency indexes (or efficiency ranking) of AsiaePacific airports can be also seen in prior literature as the DEA efficiency indexes computed by the DEA methodology are highly dependent upon the sample size of airports and number of airport input and output variables used during the efficiency evaluation.",

The dummy value of airport management denoted by 'Man' is 1 if an airport is government-controlled or owned, 0 otherwise. 'OH' represents airport's daily operating hours. 'Pop' represents the dummy variable which takes 1 if an airport's hinterland population is more than 4 million people, 0 otherwise. 'Alliance' represents alliance membership of dominant airline, and it is a dummy variable which takes the value 1 if the dominant airline of an airport becomes a member of a major global airline strategic alliance, 0 otherwise. First, Im et al.'s (2003) panel unit root test was employed to check the problem of unit roots of all relevant variables. The second-stage estimation results showed the factors for explaining airport efficiency were reported in Table 3 . 11 Four explanatory variables were found to be significant factors for explaining variations in airport efficiency: percentage of international passengers; airport's hinterland population; alliance membership of dominant airline; and the logarithm of GDP per capita. For 'percentage of international passengers' the coefficient was negative; for every percentage increase in international passengers handled by an airport, its efficiency reduced by 0.001 units. Importantly, this finding appears to be consistent with Pathomsiri et al. (2006) , who claimed that the handling of international passenger traffic has a negative impact on an airport's efficiency as larger airport infrastructure and facilities (e.g. check-in counters and baggage handling areas) need to be built to serve international travellers comparing with domestic passengers.",

Surprisingly, this variable had a negative impact on airport efficiency. This may suggest that an airport that serves a larger hinterland population is less efficient than an airport that serves a smaller hinterland population; it also suggests that larger airport infrastructure or capacity need to be constructed to accommodate a larger hinterland population and the forecasted growth of air traffic demand across the AsiaePacific region. However, air transport demand and airport operations were inevitably affected by unwanted adverse incidents or difficult operating conditions that led to lower airport efficiency (Grais et al., Remarks: *, **, and *** indicate that the explanatory variable is significant at the 0.10, 0.05, and 0.01 significance level, respectively. The truncated regression analysis with bootstrapping (Simar and Wilson, 2007) results above was derived from 5000 bootstrapped iterations. 10 The total air cargo volumes of the sampled AsiaePacific airports showed negative growth of 3.2% between 2007 and 2008. 11 To check the robustness of the SimareWilson bootstrapping regression analysis, the random-effects (RE) Tobit model was also computed in this study (see Merkert and Hensher, 2011) .

Also, it should be acknowledged that it is extremely difficult to define the exact size of an airport's hinterland size due to improvements in aircraft technology that allow longer distance to be flown, the formation of strategic alliances between airlines, the establishment of hub-andspoke networks by many airlines, and airport overlap or congestion in multi-airport region (MAR) in which an airport competes air traffic volumes with its neighbouring airports. 12 (e.g. Graham, 1999; Graham and Guyer, 2000; Williams, 2006) . The coefficient suggests that if an airport serves a larger hinterland population, its efficiency would drop by 0.126 units. 'Alliance membership of dominant airline' variable was also reported as significant in both estimations, and suggests that if an airport's dominant airline enters a global airline strategic alliance, this might positively influence its home-based airport's efficiency; when the dominant airline(s) of an airport enters a global airline strategic alliance, the airport's efficiency will increase by 0.080 units as allied airlines could share airport facilities to handle more connecting traffic. More importantly, this finding provides evidence to support the argument of Gillen and Lall (1997) , who claimed that common use of airport facilities can improve efficiency by allocating passenger terminal facilities for airlines of a particular alliance so they have exclusive use of the passenger terminals. This gives airlines an incentive to use the designated passenger terminals more efficiently. Also, the current situation shows that an increasing number of large or legacy airlines have joined or intend to enter three major global airline strategic alliances (i.e. oneworld, Star Alliance, and SkyTeam) or formed their own partnerships (e.g. Qantas Airways and Emirates Airline). Importantly, allied activities between partner airlines are seen to affect airport operations in different ways such as a specific passenger terminal (e.g. Narita's Terminal One) being designated for a group of airlines associated with a particular alliance (in Narita's case, Star Alliance) (Cento, 2009) .",
