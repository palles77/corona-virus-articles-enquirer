Abstract: Background: The rapid spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by a zoonotic beta-coronavirus entitled 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), has become a global threat. Awareness of the biological features of 2019-nCoV should be updated in time and needs to be comprehensively summarized to help optimize control measures and make therapeutic decisions. Methods: Based on recently published literatures, official documents and selected up-to-date preprint studies, we reviewed the virology and origin, epidemiology, clinical manifestations, pathology and treatment of 2019-nCoV infection, in comparison with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection. Results: The genome of 2019-nCoV partially resembled SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and indicating a bat origin. The COVID-19 generally had a high reproductive number, a long incubation period, a short serial interval and a low case fatality rate (much higher in patients with comorbidities) than SARS and MERS. Clinical presentation and pathology of COVID-19 greatly resembled SARS and MERS, with less upper J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 2 respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms, and more exudative lesions in post-mortems. Potential treatments included remdesivir, chloroquine, tocilizumab, convalescent plasma and vaccine immunization (when possible).",

The 2019-nCoV is a novel enveloped beta-coronavirus which has a single stranded positive sense RNA genome . Concerning the origin of the virus, several phylogenetic analysis suggested the bat to be the most probable animal reservoir. Based on genome sequencing, 2019-nCoV is about 89% identical to bat SARS-like-CoVZXC21, 82% identical to human SARS-CoV and about 50% to MERS-CoV (Chan et al., 2020; Lu et al., 2020) . As both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were transmitted from bats to palm civets or dromedary camels, and finally to humans, there should be another animal representing as an intermediate host between bat and human. Pangolins were suggested as the possible intermediate hosts, because their genome had approximately 85.5%-92.4% similarity to 2019-nCoV, representing two sub-lineages of 2019-nCoV in the phylogenetic tree, one of which (GD/P1L and GDP2S) was extremely closely related to 2019-nCoV (Lam et al., 2020) .",

The amino acid sequence Another research team also discovered an \"RRAR\" furin recognition site by an insertion in the S1/S2 protease cleavage site in 2019-nCoV, instead of a single arginine in SARS-CoV. After quantifying the kinetics mediating the interaction via surface plasmon resonance, ACE2 is calculated to bind to 2019-nCoV ectodomain with ~15 nM affinity, which is approximately 10-to 20-fold higher affinity than ACE2 binding to SARS-CoV (Wrapp et al., 2020) . In all, the binding affinity between 2019-nCoV S-protein and ACE2 is comparable or even stronger than SARS-CoV S-protein and ACE2.

However, phyloepidemiologic analyses suggested that Huanan market was not the origin of 2019-nCoV. The virus was imported from elsewhere and boosted in the crowded market (Yu et al., 2020) . The proportion of infected cases without an exposure history and in health care workers gradually increased. All of the evidence indicated the human-to-human transmission ability of 2019-nCoV, which may already be spread silently between people in Wuhan before the cluster of cases from Huanan market was discovered in late December. Person-to-person transmission may occur mainly through droplet or contact transmission. According to Guan's latest pilot study, 2019-nCoV was detected positive in the gastrointestinal tract specimens (stool and rectal swabs) as well as in saliva and urine, and even in esophageal erosion and bleeding site of severe peptic ulcer patients . Four important epidemiological parameters of 2019-nCoV were reviewed in comparison with those of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV(shown in Table 1 ).",

Lessons learned from the MERS and SARS outbreaks can provide valuable insight into how to handle the current pandemic. The successful public health outbreak response tactics of Chinese government, such as hand hygiene, wearing masks, isolation, quarantine, social distancing, and community containment, can be copied by other countries according to their national situation. As the pandemic is still ongoing and expanding, experiences and research literatures from China and other countries will increase. The 2019-nCoV should be monitored of any possible gene variation of antigenic drift or antigenic conversion, to avoid another round of outbreak.

The binding free energy for 2019-nCoV S-protein to bind with human ACE2, increases by 28 kcal mol -1 compared to SARS-CoV S-protein (-50.6kcal mol -1 vs. -78.6kcal mol -1 ), due to the loss of hydrogen bond interactions by replacing Arg426 with Asn426(Xu et al., 2020a). Furin-like cleavage site was supposed to be cleaved by proprotein convertase furin at special viral envelope glycoproteins, thereby enhancing viral fusion with host cell membranes.

Histological examinations of two patients underwent lung lobectomies for adenocarcinoma, revealed edema, proteinaceous exudate, focal hyperplasia of pneumocytes with only patchy inflammatory cellular infiltration without prominent hyaline membranes. Since both patients didn't develop symptoms of COVID-19 pneumonia at the time of surgery, these changes likely represent an early phase of the lung pathology of COVID-19 pneumonia. Qian and his colleagues (2020) first reported the pathological characteristics of a patient who died from COVID-19.General observation from raw eyes showed less fibrosis and consolidation, insteadJ o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f more exudative lesions in COVID-19 than SARS. Microscopic examination showed bilateral diffuse alveolar damage with cellular fibromyxoid exudates, indicating ARDS. Interstitial mononuclear inflammatory infiltrates were dominated by lymphocytes. Multinucleated syncytial cells with atypical enlarged pneumocytes showed viral cytopathic-like changes, without obvious intranuclear or intracytoplasmic viral inclusions. Results from flow cytometric analysis demonstrated that the counts of peripheral CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were substantially reduced, while their status were hyper-activated. It indicated the severe immune injury in later stage of COVID-19, but not by virus direct destruction(Xu et al., 2020b). Based on the public database and single-cell RNA-Seq technique, pathological studies revealed that male donors had a higher ACE2-expressing cell ratio than their female counterparts. The only Asian male specimen has five more times as much as ACE2 expressing on the white and African American donors. This might explain why the 2019-nCov and previous SARS-CoV pandemic were concentrated in the Asian population and a heightened susceptibility of male patients, although more evidence was needed to draw such conclusion(Yu et al., 2020). Pathological manifestations of SARS and MERS infected patients may shed lights to control current 2019-nCoV pandemic. Histology examination demonstrated a considerably higher viral load of SARS-CoV RNA in lung and small bowels than other organs of the body, suggesting an reason for manifestation of pneumonia and diarrhea in SARS patients. Living 2019-nCoV was also detected positive in stool specimens and rectal swabs of infected patients, indicating possible transmission route of oral-faecal transmission. Proper handling with the infected corpse and disposal of human excreta of infected patients were of great importance",

New therapeutic drugs are emerging one after another. However, double-blinded randomized controlled trials with larger sample size are needed to determine the safety and efficacy of these new drugs and guide clinical decision. Medical interventions can be divided into four major categories: general treatment, coronavirus specific treatments, antiviral treatments and others. General treatments included nutritional interventions, immuno-enhancers and Chinese medicine. Interferon, intravenous gamma-globulin and thymosin were believed to boost our immune system to fight with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV as well as 2019-nCoV. Chloroquine, an old Chinese medicine for treatment of malaria and autoimmune disease, had demonstrated remarkable inhibition in the spread of SARS-CoV by interfering with ACE2 in Vero E6 cell lines(Vincent et al., 2005). Wang et al. (2020b) demonstrated that chloroquine functioned at both entry and post-entry stages of the 2019-nCoV infection in Vero E6 cells, as well as an immune-modulating activity that enhanced antiviral effect in vivo. Recent multicenter clinical trails conducted in China have also reported obvious efficacy and acceptable safety in COVID-19 patients by reducing exacerbation of pneumonia, improving radiological findings, promoting a virus negative conversion, and shortening the disease course(Gao et al., 2020). Due to the indispensable role of the S-protein in coronavirus, therapies and vaccine exploration targeting S-protein-ACE2 interaction may be very promising. Previous therapies targeting SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV may accelerate the development of treatment of COVID-19 because of their structure resemblance and genome",

Possible reasons may be the unknown levels of neutralizing antibodies in convalescent plasma and transfusion timing(van Griensven et al., 2016). In terms of vaccine, if any cross-reactive epitopes were identified between 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV, previous vaccine for SARS-CoV might be re-utilized to facilitate 2019-nCoV vaccine development. We recommend an influenza and Streptococcus pneumoniae vaccination for prophylaxis, especially in elderly adults(Chen et al., 2020b). Both pandemic viruses result in similar respiratory symptoms and hard to distinguish. The 2019-nCoV pandemic initiated in flu season which easy to develop a combination infection of 2019-nCoV and influenza or Streptococcus infection.
