No differences were observed in genotype prevalence or minor allele frequencies between persons with fatal infl uenza and the reference sample. Fatal cases with low-producing MBL2 genotypes had a 7-fold increased risk for invasive methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) co-infection compared with fatal cases with highand intermediate-producing MBL2 genotypes (odds ratio 7.1, 95% confi dence interval 1.6-32.1). Limited analysis of 2 genes important to the innate immune response found no association between genetic variants and fatal infl uenza infection. Among children and young adults who died of infl uenza, low-producing MBL2 genotypes may have increased risk for MRSA co-infection.",

For MBL2, we examined 5 SNPS, 3 in the coding region of exon 1 and 2 in the promoter region. The 3 structural SNPs in MBL2 that we examined encode variant alleles known as D (codon 52, rs5030737), B (codon 54, rs1800450), and C (codon 57, rs1800451); the wild-type is A (7, 8) . These variants are typically pooled and designated as the O allele. The MBL2 genotype A/A refers to wild-type homozygotes, A/O refers to heterozygotes, and O/O refers to homozygotes or compound heterozygotes. Promoter polymorphisms at positions \u2212550 (H/L variant, rs11003125) and \u2212221 (X/Y variant, rs7096206) encode variants that mediate MBL2 expression. Case-patients were classifi ed as low, intermediate, or high producers of MBL on the basis of their structural and promoter variants (referred to as a \"truncated haplotype\") (7). Case-patients homozygous or compound heterozygous for any of the 3 variant structural alleles and case-patients with a variant structural allele on 1 chromosome and the X variant on the other were categorized as low MBL producers. Case-patients homozygous for the wild-type structural allele were categorized as high MBL producers except for those also homozygous for the X variant, who were classifi ed as intermediate MBL producers on the basis of evidence that possession of the X/X promoter genotype signifi cantly down-regulates MBL production (9) . Case-patients with the YA/O genotype were classifi ed as intermediate MBL producers on the basis of analyses indicating that this genotype confers intermediate levels of functional MBL (9) . For some analyses, the intermediate and high producers were combined into 1 group and compared with MBL low-producers.",

Excessive systemic TNF is responsible for many symptoms of clinical infection and may lead to fatal complications. Studies have demonstrated a signifi cant genetic contribution to circulating TNF levels, with 50%-60% of variance in TNF levels genetically determined (19) (20) (21) . The most studied SNP is at position \u2212308 (rs1800629), with the A allele associated with 20%-40% greater TNF production (22) (23) (24) and with susceptibility to and severity of numerous infectious diseases (20, 22, 25, 26) . Carriage of the A allele at the \u2212238 position (rs361525) also has been associated with a variety of diseases (20, 22) . MBL, another key component of the innate immune system, is a soluble protein of the collectin family that binds to microbial surfaces and promotes phago-opsonization directly and indirectly by activating the lectin complement pathway. Low serum MBL levels are common and associated with an increased risk for a variety of infections and autoimmune diseases (15, (27) (28) (29) , including acute respiratory infection in young children (12) . MBL levels are strongly infl uenced by genetic factors, with >75% of variation in MBL levels explained by a small number of polymorphisms in the MBL2 gene (30) . Variant proteins are unstable and of lower oligomeric form, which decreases affi nity for microbial ligands and complement-activating ability. Each variant produces signifi cantly reduced serum MBL levels.",

Phase I clinical trials of MBL replacement therapy indicate that this therapy is well tolerated and effective at improving MBL defi ciency in healthy persons (33) . Reports of MBL replacement therapy administered to severely ill persons (34) (35) (36) or to patients with S. aureus sepsis (37) suggest that therapy can improve clinical conditions, although results of these studies were mixed, and in some cases, clinical improvements were temporary. The clinical implications of MBL replacement therapy for infl uenza treatment or prevention are unknown. Among persons with fatal cases, we observed an increased risk for sudden death in carriers of the variant allele of TNF rs1800750. We are unaware of previous literature reporting a similar association; there is no obvious biologic mechanism to explain the fi nding. The TNF rs1800750 variant is in linkage disequilibrium with other TNF variants (http://pga.gs.washington.edu), some of which (including TNF rs361525) have been associated with increased TNF serum levels. Therefore, it is possible that the observed association may be due to linkage disequilibrium with unmeasured polymorphisms that are the causal variants, and more exhaustive analysis of TNF variants is worthy of future study.",

Although the study cohort is, to our knowledge, the largest sample of fatal infl uenza cases in children and young adults, the analysis has limited statistical power to detect associations because of small sample sizes, especially when examining subsamples. We had access to limited information about racial and ethnic background of casepatients. Clinical data were obtained primarily from a US surveillance system and were not validated with medical chart review. Although we were able to infer truncated haplotypes for MBL2, haplotype information for TNF was unavailable. Despite these shortcomings, the possibility that specifi c variants of the MBL2 gene known to infl uence serum MBL levels appear to be associated with severe bacterial co-infection is an intriguing fi nding deserving of additional study, especially given the prevalence of co-infection among case-patients who died of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus infection (38) and observations that children co-infected with infl uenza and S. aureus may have higher case-fatality rates (39) .",

            "text": "That we observed a stronger relationship between low-producing MBL genotypes and MRSA infection than between those genotypes and S. aureus infection in general is puzzling. We are unaware of an obvious physiologic explanation for why low MBL would predispose more strongly to infection with methicillin-resistant versus methicillin-sensitive S. aureus. One possibility is that MRSA is a marker for other strain characteristics. For example, such an association could arise if MRSA infections were predominantly the USA300 strain while other S. aureus infections were predominantly the USA100 strain. Unfortunately, we do not have data on S. aureus genetic strain types. We also found that of the 4 fatal infl uenza cases in which patients had both MRSA co-infection and low-producing MBL genotypes, 2 patients reportedly also had asthma. It is well-established that asthma increases the risk for serious complications of infl uenza, and although we know of no evidence suggesting that low-producing MBL genotypes are associated with increased risk for asthma (40) , this fi nding may be worth further exploration in future studies. Our fi ndings suggest several opportunities for additional infl uenza-related research. An obvious next step is examination of all functional variants of the MBL2 gene in conjunction with gene expression and functional assays in a larger group of severely ill infl uenza case-patients with suffi ciently detailed clinical data to defi ne important phenotypes (e.g., MRSA co-infection). Interest in association studies of rare variants, the availability of new sequencing technologies that dramatically decrease the cost of sequencing, and access to reference human sequence data suggest that investigating rare variants in candidate genes (including MBL2 and TNF) and their functional effects may be a promising avenue of research. Large-scale genotyping of a sample of case-patients to look for common variants by using methods such as genomewide association studies may be possible if a network of collaborators capable of pooling a suffi cient number of case-patients is developed. Recent initiatives such as the Genome-based Research and Population Health International Network (www.graphint. org/ver2) are aimed at encouraging such networks. Given the rapid acceleration in laboratory technologies, enhancement in bioinformatics methods and capacity, and trends toward collaborative research within large consortia, exploration of the role of host genomic factors in serious illness associated with infl uenza and other viral pathogens is increasingly feasible. We believe that host genomics is a promising area for future research regarding who is at risk for severe complications of acute infectious diseases, including infl uenza. ",
