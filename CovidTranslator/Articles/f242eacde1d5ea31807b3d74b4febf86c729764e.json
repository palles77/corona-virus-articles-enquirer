Electronic medical record (EMR) use for contact tracing is time-consuming and may miss exposed individuals. Real-time location systems (RTLSs) may improve contact identification. Therefore, the relative effectiveness of these 2 contact tracing methodologies were evaluated. Methods: During a pertussis outbreak in the United States, a retrospective case study was conducted between June 14 and August 31, 2016, to identify the contacts of confirmed pertussis cases, using EMR and RTLS data in the emergency department of a tertiary care medical center. Descriptive statistics and a paired t test (\u03b1 = 0.05) were performed to compare contacts identified by EMR versus RTLS, as was correlation between pertussis patient length of stay and the number of potential contacts. Results: Nine cases of pertussis presented to the emergency department during the identified time period. RTLS doubled the potential exposure list (P < .01). Length of stay had significant positive correlation with contacts identified by RTLS (\u03c1 = 0.79; P = .01) but not with EMR (\u03c1 = 0.43; P = .25). Conclusions: RTLS doubled the potential pertussis exposures beyond EMR-based contact identification. Thus, RTLS may be a valuable addition to the practice of contact tracing and infectious disease monitoring.",

Nurse leadership in coordination with hospital infection control, using current Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines, conducted this review. Possible disease exposure included any health care worker whose role placed them in face-to-face contact with the index patient in the exam room or triage area. The EMR identified any health care workers who documented their interactions with patients. Subsequently, a list of possible pertussis exposures was generated using a novel RTLS event mapping program that identified patients and staff, their colocations, and movements over time and space. It took <5 minutes to generate each of these RTLS data queries. Because pertussis is spread through droplet respiratory secretions, possible exposures were limited to colocation in ED exam rooms or triage areas where droplet exposures are most likely. Hallway and waiting room colocation were excluded from the analysis because they were not considered likely to result in face-toface exposure. All possible exposures, identified through RTLS or EMR review, were offered standard pertussis exposure prophylaxis.",

RTLS-generated data can be a valuable adjunct to identify additional potential disease exposures, especially health care staff who are not principal caretakers and/or those in supporting ED roles. RTLS appears to be of greater benefit when patients have longer ED LOS. We showed statistically significant positive correlation with ED LOS and RTLS-identified contacts, but not with EMR-identified contacts. The literature has shown that the LOS of contagious patients in hospital settings increases the potential for nosocomial spread of contagious diseases, 17, 18 but no study has looked into the correlation between LOS and number of identified contacts using different contact tracing methodologies. Our finding may be due to the fact that patients with longer LOS interact with more health care providers during their stay.",

Time to complete standard chart review was not specifically measured, but was estimated to be 30-60 minutes per patient EMR. Other studies have found that the use of chart review in contact tracing is time-consuming. 3 The objective data provided by RTLS reduced the need to further verify and interview staff documented within the chart to identify additional potential exposures.

However, diseases like pertussis are increasingly reemerging in cycles every 3-5 years despite the high rate of vaccination, 19 and lack of vaccination is an increasing concern. 20 In other studies, nosocomial pertussis outbreaks resulted in substantial cost to hospitals, even when the number of pertussis cases was low. 9,10 Also, contact tracing is only 1 method to justify the cost of RTLS, and some smaller community EDs may also attain a reasonable return on investment using metrics such as reducing asset shrinkage. 21 Limitations to our study include, but are not limited to, a small sample size. We tested only 1 ED, and focused on 1 specific disease, which makes it less generalizable. Also, this study did not include the mitigating effect of personal protective equipment use by health care staff members for exposure to pertussis-diagnosed patients, and did not take the cost of using each contact tracing method into account. Further multicenter comparative studies of infectious diseases using contact tracing between the RTLS and EMR, with larger sample sizes and with focus on more than 1 disease, are needed to confirm our findings and cost-effectiveness and allow for more generalizability.",

Although RTLS is not mature enough a technology to entirely replace standard chart review, this case study illustrates how an evolving technology can accelerate the process of active screening and facilitate timely cessation in the chain of transmission of infectious diseases. RTLS can be an important tool for infection control programs, especially in tertiary care medical systems with higher acuity and complex, vulnerable patients. Such hospitals are relied upon to care for patients with rare, high-risk, contagious diseases like measles, tuberculosis, and emerging infections such as Ebola virus disease, severe acute respiratory syndrome, or Middle East respiratory syndrome. Notably, several high-risk emerging infections are transmitted by airborne spread Table 2 Health care staff additionally identified as potentially exposed by real-time location system ) and also had the largest number of additionally identified staff by RTLS (7, 11, and 7, respectively) ( Table 2 ). Length of stay had significant positive correlation with the total unique contacts (\u03c1 = 0.78; P = .01). When further examined by identification method, length of stay had significant positive correlation with the total contact number identified by RTLS (\u03c1 = 0.79; P = .01) but length of stay was not significantly correlated with the total contact number identified by EMR review (\u03c1 = 0.43; P = .25). with greater contagious risk to staff and other patients, and if discharged home, to the public at large. We believe that RTLS may show a more substantial benefit in these cases, because brief exposures at a distance are clinically significant and difficult to thoroughly evaluate by traditional means, whereas event mapping using RTLS is customizable to pick up such brief exposures.",
