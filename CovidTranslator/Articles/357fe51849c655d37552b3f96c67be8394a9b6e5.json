We performed analytical and clinical validations of these kits. (LOD) with 95% probability values were estimated by testing 16 replicates of upstream of the envelope gene (upE) and open reading frame 1a (ORF1a) RNA transcripts. Specificity was estimated by using 28 nasopharyngeal swabs that were positive for other respiratory viruses. Clinical sensitivity was evaluated by using 18 lower respiratory specimens. The sensitivity test panel and the high inhibition panel were composed of nine specimens each, including eight and six specimens that were positive for MERS-CoV, respectively.",

To determine analytical sensitivity, the limits of detection (LOD) with 95% probability values was determined by using upE and ORF1a RNA transcripts supplied by the Institute of Virology, University of Bonn Medical Centre [7] . The original concentration of both RNA transcripts was 1.0 \u00d7 10 5 copies/\u03bcL. These were diluted to six concentrations in 0.5-log steps from 100 to 0.3 copies/reaction, and kits were tested by using 5-8-\u03bcL samples of RNA eluates per reaction. For the Nanobiosys kit, which used 2.4-\u03bcL samples per reaction, a 0.5-log higher concentration was added for the LOD validation. Each concentration was tested by using 16 replicates, with the exception of PowerChek, for which 12 replicates were used. A probit regression analysis in R Studio (R Studio Inc.; https://www.rstudio.com/) was performed to determine the 95% cut-off values. The PowerChek, AccuPower, LightMix, and UltraFast LabChip kits used the primers and probes from the WHO-recommended rRT-PCR assay [7, To evaluate the analytical and clinical specificity of the kits, 28 respiratory virus-positive nasopharyngeal swabs were used to determine cross-reactions with human RNA or other respiratory viruses, including human coronaviruses. Using the Anyplex II RV16 kit (Seegene) with duplicate specimen preparations, these specimens were confirmed as positive for only single species of the following viruses: influenza virus A (n = 2), influenza virus B (n = 2), human parainfluenza virus 1 (n = 2), human parainfluenza virus 2 (n = 2), human parainfluenza virus 3 (n = 2), respiratory syncytial virus A (n = 2), respiratory syncytial virus B (n = 2), human adenovirus (n = 2), human bocavirus (n = 2), hu- man metapneumovirus (n = 2), human rhinovirus (n = 2), human coronavirus 229E (n = 2), human coronavirus OC43 (n = 2), and human coronavirus NL63 (n = 2).",

The other nine specimens were manually prepared in our laboratory without any pretreatment and were found to be inadequate for evaluating clinical sensitivity owing to the extremely high levels of PCR inhibition. Therefore, only the first nine specimens were used to evaluate clinical sensitivity, and the other nine specimens with high inhibition were used to evaluate the effects of PCR inhibition on positive results. In addition to determining the numbers of positives and negatives, the cycle threshold (Ct) values of the target genes and internal control were analyzed.",

The LOD for upE was 1.34 log copies/reaction for the Any-plex kit, but no CI value could be calculated because there were no positive reactions at 1.0 log copy/reaction, while all 16 replicate specimens were positive at 1.5 log copies/reaction. In contrast, although the LODs for upE and ORF1a using the LightMix kit were 2.11 log copies/reaction and 1.78 log copies/reaction, respectively, trailing of positives was observed at much lower concentrations than these LODs (Fig. 1) . The LODs for upE of three different 1-step kits, the AccuPower, Light Mix, and Ultrafast kits, were > 2.0 log copies/reaction, which was less sensitive than those of three different 2-step kits; however, this difference was not significant (Fig. 2) .

            "text": "UlS-ORF1a with the same RNA transcripts used to evaluate RealStar MERS-CoV (Altona Diagnostics), which is the only kit thus far approved for diagnosis [9] . When comparing the analytical sensitivities of assay systems, it is important to use consistent evaluation conditions; moreover, the quality of the source material is critical. It is often difficult to find traceable source materials for the molecular diagnosis of viral infections, as only a few international standards have been established to date [10] [11] [12] . As with RealStar MERS-CoV [9] , all target gene-binding sites for upE, ORF1a, and ORF1b used in the study kits were based on the oligonucleotide sequences of WHO-recommended primers and probes [3] , and the upE and ORF1a target sites were located within the RNA transcripts used in this study. Whole genome sequences of MERS-CoV isolates obtained during the 2015 Korean outbreak were determined by the Korea National Institute of Health and Seoul National University (gb|KT029139.1|) and the Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention (gb|KT036372.1). Both sequences closely clustered with a strain isolated during the spring 2015 outbreak in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia (gb|KT026454.1|) [13] . Therefore, the primers and probes used in this study were most likely not affected by sequence variations in the MERS-CoV strains circulating in this outbreak. The RNA transcripts used to assess the analytical sensitivity in detecting upE and ORF1a [9] were not expected to have target mismatches with the primers and probes used in this study. Therefore, the LOD of all kits was analyzed by using identical source materials, and the data were comparable among various kits as well as with data from previous evaluations of RealStar MERS-CoV [9] . The LODs for upE of the kits assessed in this study indicated approximately 10-fold lower sensitivity than the previously reported 95% cut-off value of 5.3 copies/reaction for RealStar MERS-CoV [9] . The overall sensitivities for detecting upE of the kits evaluated herein were consistently lower than that of the RealStar MERS-CoV kit (Fig. 2) . Only the LOD for ORF1a using the PowerChek duplex kit was similar to that of the RealStar kit: 9.3 copies/reaction using the RealStar MERS-CoV kit in comparison with 6.9 copies/reaction using the PowerChek kit. Therefore, the lower sensitivities of the kits evaluated in comparison with that of RealStar MERS-CoV could be attributed to their performances rather than instability in source materials. In comparison with RealStar MERS-CoV [9] , all of the kits analyzed herein have room for improvement in their sensitivity, with the exception of ORF1a testing with the PowerChek kit. Unlike the other tested kits, the LightMix kit demonstrated a markedly trailing tendency to yield positive results down to much lower con-centrations than its LOD and an uncertain result to even a known-negative specimen (Fig. 1) . These findings suggest that the effort to increase sensitivity may result in more uncertainty and therefore negatively impact specificity. The previous study on the clinical sensitivity of RealStar MERS-CoV produced four discrepant results among 19 specimens, of which three specimens (oral, nasal, and urine specimens) showed high Ct values using the RealStar kit, but not using the comparison assay (and vice versa for one nasal specimen) [9] . This could be a result of RealStar MERS-CoV having a higher sensitivity or lower specificity than the other assay. Using the 2-step kits tested in this study, the LODs for upE using multiple gene-targeting formats were comparable to those obtained using single gene-targeting formats (Fig. 2) . Therefore, implementing a 2-step approach, including performing the first screening step with a single genetargeting format, was not beneficial in terms of sensitivity.",

The LOD for ORF1b using the DiaPlexQ kit was not measured, but the low sensitivity of this kit in detecting ORF1b in clinical specimens is consistent with a previous report, in which testing for ORF1b was less sensitive than testing for ORF1a or upE [7, 8] .",
