Thus, the SARS-CoV E protein is considered a potential target for the development of antiviral drugs. However, the cellular immune responses to E protein remain unclear in humans. In this study, we found that peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from fully recovered SARS individuals rapidly produced IFN-g and IL-2 following stimulation with a pool of 9 peptides overlapping the entire E protein sequence. Analysis of the immune responses by flow cytometry showed that both CD4 \u00fe and CD8 \u00fe T cells were involved in the SARS-CoV E-specific immune responses after stimulation with SARS-CoV E peptides. Moreover, the majority of IFN-g \u00fe CD4 \u00fe T cells were central memory cells expressing CD45RO \u00fe CCR7 \u00fe CD62L \u00c0 ; whereas IFN-g \u00fe CD8 \u00fe memory T cells were mostly effector memory cells expressing CD45RO \u00c0 CCR7 \u00c0 CD62L \u00c0 . The results of T-cell responses to 9 individual peptides indicated that the E protein contained at least two major T cell epitopes (E2 amino acid [aa] 9e26 and E5e6: aa 33e57) which were important in eliciting cellular immune response to SARS-CoV E protein in humans.",

During the period January 2003 to May 2003, SARS spread rapidly among large human populations and led to thousands of infected patients and hundreds of deaths in over 30 countries [4e6] . As reported, substantial efforts have been made to isolate the SARS-CoV and study its genomic sequence [5, 6] , and its ACE-2 binding receptors have been identified on target cells [7] . Increasing evidence in both animal and human models indicates that SARS-CoV infection results in multiple organ dysfunction [8, 9] . Moreover, it has been also reported that SARS-CoV infection induces specific antibody production that is considered both an effective method of diagnosis, as well as potential for a passive and active immunization for the prevention and treatment of SARS [10e12] . In addition to the induction of humoral immune responses, cellmediated immune responses to SARS-CoV were detected in both SARS patients and animal models [13e15] . Clinical data showed that pronounced lymphopenia was observed in most SARS patients [16] . All of those reports show that T cell responses may not only participate in the clearance of virus in recovered SARS patients but also contribute to immunopathology in early stages of the disease. Therefore, it is very important to understand the role of T lymphocytes in human SARS-CoV infection.",

            "text": "SARS-CoV has four structural proteins (S, N, M, and E proteins) that have various functions [5, 6] . Many reports concerning the immune responses to SARS-CoV S and N proteins have been published [17e19], the immune responses against E protein in human and animal models have not yet been studied extensively [20] . E protein is a small, 9e 12 kDa integral membrane protein. A previous study demonstrated that SARS-CoV E protein could form ion channels [21] . E protein also plays a role in viral assembly and morphogenesis [22] . Disruption of the E protein may possibly abrogate viral infectivity [23] . Recently, Yang et al. [24] showed that SARS-CoV E protein induced apoptosis in transfected Jurkat T cells, which possibly contributes to the SARS-CoV-induced lymphopenia observed in most SARS patients. Thus SARS-CoV E protein may be a potential target for the development of antiviral drugs. Here we analyzed memory T cell responses against the E protein in a group of individuals who had clinical SARS-CoV infection between January and May 2003. Our results demonstrated that SARS-CoV E protein specific memory T cell responses including central and effector memory CD4 \u00fe and CD8 \u00fe T cells could be persistent for two years. We also showed that SARS-CoV E protein might contain at least two different major epitopes, aa 9e26 and aa 33e57, which could be important in eliciting cellular immune response against SARS-CoV E protein in humans.",

PBMCs from SARS-recovered donors were stimulated with a pool of E peptides and were stained for cell surface expression of CD4 and CD8 and also for intracellular IL-2 expression (Fig. 3) . The results showed that SARS-CoV E protein specific CD4 \u00fe memory T cells were also capable of producing IL-2 (Fig. 3A) , and a very low number of specific CD8 \u00fe memory T cells could produce IL-2 (data not shown). To further analyze the subsets of IL-2-and IFN-g-producing CD4 \u00fe T cells, co-staining for IFN-g and IL-2 expression was performed and analyzed by flow cytometry. The results, indicated in Fig. 3B , show that T cells specific for SARS-CoV E peptides could be divided into three subsets based on IL-2 and IFN-g expression: IFN-g secreting cells; co-expression of IL-2 and IFN-g secreting cells; and IL-2 secreting cells. The majority of T cells specific for SARS-CoV E peptides were single IFN-g-secreting cells, and the frequency of cells secreting both IL-2 and IFN-g was very low in specific CD4 \u00fe T cells (Fig. 3C) . The phenotypic characteristics of SARS-CoV E protein specific CD4 \u00fe and CD8 \u00fe memory T cells were further assessed. Following stimulation ex vivo with E peptides, PBMCs from SARS-recovered donors were stained for surface expression of CD4, CD8, CD45RO, CR7, CD62L and for intracellular IFN-g and subsequently analyzed by flow cytometry (Fig. 4) . The results showed that 75% of IFN-g \u00fe CD4 \u00fe T cells were CCR7 \u00fe , 54.0% of them were CD62L \u00c0 , and 94% of them expressed CD45RO. Compared to IFN-g \u00fe CD4 \u00fe T cells, 70% of IFN-g \u00fe CD8 \u00fe T cells did not express CCR7, 97% of them were CD62L \u00c0 , and 94% of them were CD45RO \u00c0 . Overall, these data indicated that IFN-g \u00fe CD4 \u00fe T cells were mostly contained within the CD45RO \u00fe CCR7 \u00fe CD62L \u00c0 cell population, whereas most IFN-g \u00fe CD8 \u00fe T cells were contained within the CD45RO \u00c0 CCR7 \u00c0 CD62L \u00c0 cell population, further suggesting that CD4 \u00fe and CD8 \u00fe memory T cells are different in phenotype and also demonstrating the heterogeneity of CD4 \u00fe and CD8 \u00fe memory T cells.",

Although the results showed that the T-cell Fig. 6 . Memory T cell responses specific to peptides E2, E5 and E6. PBMCs from SARS-recovered donors were incubated with the indicated peptides (E2, E5 or E6) for 6 h. Intracellular staining for IFN-g was performed. CD4 \u00fe and CD8 \u00fe T cells were gated and subsequently analyzed for IFN-g expression by flow cytometry. Results shown are representative of 3 independent experiments from 3 SARS patients. Similar results were obtained in other experiments. epitopes were scattered throughout the sequence of E protein, some peptides were recognized more frequently than others. The peptides that were frequently recognized by T cells were E2 (aa 9 to 26), E5 (aa 33 to 49) and E6 (aa 40 to 57). Therefore, at least two different epitopes, corresponding to aa 9 to 26 and aa 33 to 57, were the major dominant antigen site on E protein for T cell responses. As E protein with 76 amino acids has limited immunogenicity, very few studies have focused on identification of epitopes on E protein. Liu et al. [35] selected specific recombinant scFv antibodies against E and N protein of SARS-CoV from the phage display library and found that the two scFv antibodies B10 and C20 could recognize the non-overlapping epitopes of E protein of SARS-CoV.",

Peptides E2 (aa 9 to 26), E5 (aa 33 to 49) and E6 (aa 40 to 57) are important epitopes of SARS-CoV E antigen. Persistence of E-specific memory T cell responses in SARS patients may play an important role in protection from SARS-CoV re-infection.",
