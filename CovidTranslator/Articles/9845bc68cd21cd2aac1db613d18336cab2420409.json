When insufficient quantities of feces were collected for two samples, samples were refrigerated only. Refrigerated samples were shipped to the laboratory to determine the presence of Cryptosporidium, Giardia, and Eimeria. Qualitative fecal examinations were performed with a modified flotation technique by the method of Cox and Todd (4), except that 1 g of feces was used. Samples were examined microscopically at 4 0 0~. Frozen samples were shipped to the laboratory, thawed, pooled within week of age, and refrozen prior to analysis for rotavirus and coronavirus by direct electron microscopy. A 10% suspension of feces was made in distilled water and clarified by centrifugation (27,000 x g for 40 min). The supernatant was decanted, and the pellet was resuspended in 2 to 3 ml of distilled water. Approximately 100 pl of the suspension was added to 1 ml of distilled water. One hundred microliters of 3% phosphotungstic acid were added to the sample for negative staining.

Stillborn calves and 1 calf that died at 3 d of age were replaced; therefore, a total of 90 calves completed the study. Calculated mortality of all calves during the experiment was 10.9% and, of calves born alive, 7.2%. Mortality of 7.2% is less than mortality reported in a recent survey of calf mortality in herds across the US (3). Of the 7 calves that died after assignment to treatment, 5 calves were fed colostrum by nipple-bottle. Serum IgG and IgM concentrations at 24 h were generally low in calves that died, although serum IgG exceeded 30 g/L in 2 calves (Table 1) . Cryptosporidium was shed by 86 calves during the study and was found in 28% of all samples collected. This prevalence (96% of calves) is higher than other reports of prevalence in young calves (10, 13) but similar to a recent survey of dairy herds throughout the US (3). Samples were positive for Crypfosporidium during wk 1 to 4 only. When pooled across wk 1 to 4, prevalence of Crypfosporidium oocysts in feces of calves housed in the barn was greater ( Table 2) , and a significant interaction of housing x colostrum feeding indicated a greater prevalence in feces of calves housed in the barn and fed colostrum in nipple-bottles. Most shedding occurred during the first 3 wk of life. An interaction of period x treatment was significant (P e .Ol) for the prevalence of Cryptosporidium (Figure la) . At 1 wk of age, calves that nursed the dam had a higher prevalence of Cryptosporidium infection than calves removed from the dam and fed colostrum by nipple-bottle. This effect was probably due to earlier exposure of calves to Cryptosporidium from the dam and surrounding environment. The lack of difference between calves housed in the barn or in in-dividual hutches at 1 wk of age suggests that the major source of inoculation was the dam in the 1st wk of life. At 2 wk of age, most calves (n = 68, 76%) shed oocysts; however, shedding was greatest from calves fed colostrum by nipple-bottle and housed in the barn. Shedding of oocysts during wk 3 was greatest when calves were housed in the barn, suggesting that infections later in life were associated with exposure in the barn.",

(10) reported that most fecal shedding of Cryptosporidium occurred during the first 24 d of life and was highly related to serum IgG concentrations in calves at 24 h of age. Stepwise multiple regression indicated that age was the primary factor affecting prevalence of Cryptosporidium in our study. Other significant independent variables included housing, mean daily BW gain, and the prevalence of Giardia. However, neither serum IgG nor IgM was significant in predicting prevalence of Cryptosporidium, suggesting that level of transfer of passive immunity did not affect level of infection in this study, in agreement with other reports (7, 19) but in contrast with data of Lopez et al. (10). Prevalence of Giardia was negatively associated with shed- There was no evidence that serum Ig concentrations influenced prevalence of rotavirus. Besser et al. (1) reported that transfer of rotavirus antibody from serum to the intestinal lumen may be important in providing immunity against rotavirus. Because cattle in this study were not immunized against rotavirus prior to parturition, concentrations of colostral antibody may have been insufficient to increase serum titers in calves and to affect prevalence of the virus. Saif and Smith (17) reported that lactogenic immunity (presence of colostral or milk antibodies in the gut lumen) is important for protection against enteric viruses, including rotavirus. Apparently, colostrum feeding for 3 d after birth did not provide sufficient lactogenic immunity to inhibit shedding of rotavirus, as indicated by increased fecal shedding and scours during the first 2 wk of life.",

Coronavirus, like rotavirus, is widespread in most dauy herds. A lack of treatment effect ( Eimeria shedding occurred only after 4 wk of age ( Figure Id) and was affected by housing type (P .02) and a period x treatment interaction (P < .02). Prevalence of Eimeriu oocysts was greater in feces from calves housed in the barn, particularly during the last week of the study. Few calves housed in hutches shed Eimeria oocysts. Davis et al. (5) also reported that shedding of Eimeria oocysts was reduced when calves were housed in individual outdoor pens in an uncontaminated area. Multiple stepwise regression also identified date of birth as a significant factor affecting prevalence of Eimeria shedding, particularly when calves were housed in the barn. Calves born later in the study had a greater prevalence of Eimeria oocysts in their feces, apparently because of contamination of the barn environment by calves born earlier.",

Fecal excretion of Giardia generally occurred after 2 wk of age (Figure le) , although feces from 1 calf contained Giardia oocysts during wk 1.",

Standard errors = 8, 9, 5, 5 , and 8% for parts A to E, respectively. Direct electron microscopy detected rotavirus and coronavirus as the primary viruses in fecal samples during the study, although parvovirus and coronavirus-like particles were occasionally observed. Rotavirus was shed by 50 calves during the 35-d study. Mean prevalence of 15.8% (SE = 2.0) compares favorably with data of Lucchelli et al. (1 I), who reported prevalence of rotavirus shedding of 16.4% in calves from birth to 30 d of age. Age had no effect on the prevalence of rotavirus in fecal samples (Figure lb), and prevalence tended (P c .lo) to be greater in feces from calves housed in the barn. Lopez et al. (10) also reported no significant effect of age or time on the shedding of rotavirus during the first 31 d after birth. Because rotavirus is ubiquitous in the environment (16), placement of calves in individual hutches was unlikely to eliminate potential for rotavirus infection. Calves housed in hutches shed rotavirus by 1 wk of age, indicating early transmission; however, leaving the calf with the dam for 3 d did not increase prevalence of rotavirus shedding in wk 1, thereby eliminating the dam as a major source of the virus. Saif (16) suggested that strict hygiene and isolation of calves may reduce transmission of rotavirus. These factors probably contributed to the reduction in prevalence of rotavirus in calves housed in hutches.",
