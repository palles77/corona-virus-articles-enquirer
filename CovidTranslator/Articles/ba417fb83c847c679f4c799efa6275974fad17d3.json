Factors determining the unique enteropathogenic properties of these coronaviral strains have not been defined (33) . Some of the enteropathogenie eoronavirus strains have been propagated in cultured cells (2, 25, 28, 30) but many others could not be adapted to cell cultures (6, 9, 28 ). An example of such a strain is the highly enteropathogenic strain LY-138 infecting calves. Several a t t e m p t s to a d a p t this strain to different types of cultured bovine fetal cells were unsuccessful (8, 9, 14) . This viral agent was m a i n t a i n e d b y oral inoculation and intestinal infection of newborn calves (8) . Electron microscopic evaluation of negatively stained preparations of purified virus particles revealed eoronaviral morphology (9) , a n d these viral preparations contained 3 antigens reacting with bovine eoronavirus antiserum (14) . U l t r a s t r u e t u r a l cytologic intestinal changes caused b y this virus were investigated (8) . Viral strain LY-138 was employed in studies on intraeellular and b o d y fluid alterations and on changes in intraeellular and extracellular ion eoneentrations t h a t occurred in the course of diarrhea following oral inoculation of calves (19, 27) .",

The bands had a density of 1.245 in CsC1 and 1.185 in sucrose. The maximum titers of hemagglutinating activity coincided with these bands as shown in Figure 1 . Electron microscopic examination of negatively stained samples from either CsC1 or sucrose isopycnic bands revealed clean fields of numerous roughly spherical particles. Elongated and other pleomorphic forms of virions were also seen. Some particles seemed to have been penetrated by the stain. Viral particles were enveloped and varied in size from 70--120 nm and possessed 15 to 20 nm petal-shaped surface projections. These projections were widely spaced and gave the typical appearance of the solar corona (Fig. 2) .",

However, viral core-like structures maintained a round configuration similar to the condensing cores reaching a diameter of 60 nm that were detected in the course of studies on the morphogenesis of virions in LY-138-infected intestinal cells (9) . Obvious thread-like structures as described for infectious bronchitis virus by others were :not detected (18) . Evidence for helical symmetry was thus not found. Several eoronaviruses appear to have ribonucleoprotein cores that are formed before envelopment and that can exist without the envelope, a characteristic that was previously observed in oneornaviruses (3, 4, 7) . The possibility of a similar cubic or binal symmetry for eoronaviruses should be considered. At least 7 polypeptides were reprodueibly demonstrated from purified virions of strain LY-138 under our conditions of dissociation of purified virus by SDS, urea and mereaptoethanoi and eleetrophoretie display in polyaerylamide gels. Occasionally, 1 or 2 very minor bands appeared near the top of the gels. There were also shoulders associated with VP 2, VP 3, VP 4, and VP 6, that could represent viral or cellular polypeptides. Four of these proteins were PAS positive for carbohydrates. In addition, polypeptide analysis of LY-138 core-like structures revealed that they contained the two viral structural proteins VP3 and VPT. GARWES and PococI~ (12) detected 4 major stud 2 minor proteins of which 3 contained carbohydrates in an analysis of a TGE strain. Our results of the presence of at least 7 proteins in the virions correspond to those obtained with the human coronavirns OC43 (16) and with the virus of avian infectious bronchitis (23) . In both instances 7 polypeptides were described and 4 of these were glyeosylated. Recently, HIER~OLZE:a (15) observed that another human eoronavirus strain, 229E, had 6 glyeoproteins. In contrast, STVR~A~ (31) displayed 4 size classes of structural proteins in preparations of the murine eoronaviral strain A59 labeled with radioactive amino acids. Three of these were glycosylated. Two of these size classes consisted of a glyeoprotein with a molecular weight of 180,000 which was converted to a glyeoprotein of 90,000.

The molecular weight was found to be 5.5 to 5.7 \u00d7 10 a in one report (29) and 8.1 x 106 in the other (20) . If a similar genetic system functions in enteropathogenic eoronaviruses, this genetic information would be sufficient to code for more than the 7 polypeptides which were detected in the eoronavirus starin LY-138. However, another report presented evidence for a 60--~70 S RN~4 of the TGE virus. This RNA of a molecular weight of 9 X 106 dissociated into 35S and 4S subunits (13) .",
