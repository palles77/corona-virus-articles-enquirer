            "text": "Cloning of the CD4 eDNA into the pCMUIV plasmid has been described by Nilsson et al. (1989) and we used this CD4 plasmid initially. However, there were no unique restriction sites in the CD4 eDNA at equivalent positions which would have allowed us to insert replacement membranespanning and cytoplasmic TGN38 sequences. We thus inserted unique restriction sites within the CD4 eDNA using PCR mutngenesis. Deen et al. (1988) have shown that a CD4 molecule terminating after residue 371 in the extracellular domain is efficiently secreted. As the threonine at 369 is followed by a proline residue, this would make it unlikely that there are any structural features after thr-369 necessary for correct folding and transport of CD4. Codon 367 (Maddon et al., 1985) in the CD4 eDNA (which encodes a serine residue) was mutated from TCC to TCA. This silent mutation created a single HincII site within the CD4 eDNA. Similarly, codons 400 and 401 (encoding arginine residues) were mutated from CGA AGG to CGT CGA. These silent mutations created a unique SalI site in the CD4 eDNA. There were now unique restriction sites on either side of the membranespanning region in the eDNA. PCR was carried out on the TGN38 eDNA using ollgonucleotides similar to those described above. Instead of the ApaLI site used in CD8 chimera constructions, 5' oligonucleotides that precede the TGN38 membrane-spanning domain were synthesized with a HincH site. A HincH-SalI or HincH-BamHI DNA fragment containing TGN38 sequences could be fused to CD4 by ligation as described previously. We thus ligated either a HindlII-HincII or HindIII-SalI DNA fragment (encoding the lumenal domain of the CD4 molecule) from pCMUIV-CD4, an appropriate PCR generated DNA fragment that encoded TGN38 sequences, and an appropriate pCMUIV vector. Ligations were transformed into E. coil strain JM101 using standard procedures (Sambrook et al., 1989 ) and clones were analyzed by restriction digestion followed by DNA sequencing. Large-scale preparations of the pCMUIV plasmids (for transfections) were made by alkaline lysis followed by CsCl-ethidium bromide purification (Sambrook et al., 1989) .",

CD8 has a tyrosine residue in the cytoplasmic domain but it is the penultimate amino acid that would not norreally be expected to operate as a retrieval signal (Fig. 1 A) . CD4 contains a signal for endocytosis (Shin et al., 1990 (Shin et al., , 1991 but this does not normally direct the protein to the TGN. Nevertheless, to eliminate the possibility of activating or corrupting a cytoplasmic signal, we exploited the fact that the localization signal in the cytoplasmic domain of TGN38 has been mapped to the sequence, SDYQRL (Bos et al., 1993; Humphrey et al., 1993; Wong and Hong, 1993) . Comparison of the hybrid protein CD8-MC (Fig. 4 A) with CD8-MAC (Fig. 4 B) , which lacked this sequence, showed that it had no significant effect on the localization of the protein to the Golgi apparatus. Both were localized to a juxtanuclear reticulum very similar to that stained by antibodies to GaIT (data not shown). Expression of the CD4-MAC hybrid protein gave similar results (Fig. 4 E) .",

The TGN is defined morphologically as a tubulo-reticular network, part of which is closely apposed to the trans side of the Golgi stack. Budding and vesicle profiles coated by clathrin are often observed (Orci et al., 1984 (Orci et al., , 1985 Griffiths and Simons, 1986) . Transiently expressed TGN38 was found in the TGN, the Golgi stack, endosomes, and the plasma membrane (Fig. 5 A) . The distribution of TGN38 depended on the level of expression. At low levels (<60 gold particles/cell section) TGN38 was found exclusively in the Golgi apparatus (Table I) with most of the protein (85 + 7%) being found in the TGN (Fig. 6) . None was detected in either endosomes or on the plasma membrane (Table I) . At higher levels of expression (>60 gold particles/cell section) the percentage of labeling over the Golgi apparatus fell (to 60 5:7 %) and rose over endosomes (to 29 5:7 %) and the plasma membrane (to 11 + 7%) ( Table I) . Even at high levels of expression the linear density of labeling over the TGN was four times that over the plasma membrane showing that the protein was still concentrated in the TGN. Hybrid proteins containing both localization signals gave patterns of labeling almost indistinguishable from TGN38 both morphologically and quantitatively. Both CD8-MC (Fig. 5 B) and CD4-MC (Fig. 5 D) were present only in the Golgi apparatus at all levels of expression and more than 80 % of the label was present in the TGN (Fig. 6) .",

CD8-C could not be detected by immuno-electron microscopy for reasons that are still unclear. More than 84 % of the CD4-C in the Golgi apparatus was present in the TGN (Fig. 6) The Journal of Cell Biology, Volume 125, 1994 5 E). However, CD4-C differed from other hybrid proteins and TGN38 in three respects. First, more than 35 % of the total protein was present in endosomal structures at low levels of expression and this increased to nearly 60 % at high levels. Second, the type of endosomal structure labeled also changed. At low levels, all of the endosomal structures were multivesicular bodies which are late endosomal compartments (Geuze et al., 1988; Hopkins et al., 1990) . At high levels of expression, labeling was also present in tubular endosomes. Because of the difficulties of distinguishing between tubular endosomes and the TGN (Geuze et al., 1988; Klumperman et al., 1993) , definitive identification of these structures will have to await further analysis using stably transfected cell lines. Third and last, the plasma membrane was labeled at both high and low levels of expression ( Table  I ). The linear density was the same (0.08 + 0.05 gold particles/#m) suggesting that CD4-C was as efficiently removed from the cell surface and delivered to endosomes. The protein was still concentrated in the TGN since the linear density was 9-24 times higher than that in the plasma membrane ( Table I) .",

Movement to the cell surface occurs via exocytic vesicles (Jones et al., 1993) and is followed by retrieval which requires a signal present in the cytoplasmic domain that has been localized to the sequence SDYQRL (Bos et al., 1993; Humphrey et ai., 1993; Wong and Hong, 1993) .

At higher levels of expression, CIM-M and TGN38 were also present in endosomes and on the cell surface, again to a similar extent. Even at these higher levels of expression, both proteins were still concentrated in the TGN as compared to the plasma membrane. For TGN38, the linear density in the TGN was four times that in the plasma membrane; for CD4-M it was even higher, being 12 times higher in the TGN than in the plasma membrane.

            "text": "Fourth and finally, metabolic labeling studies showed that all molecules of CD4-M received sialic acid, showing that they had all reached the trans cisterna/TGN. The present studies are at variance with previous studies that identified only the cytoplasmic domain of TGN38 as a localiTation signal. Removal of most of the domain led to the appearance of the truncated protein on the cell surface (Luzio et al., 1990; Bos et al., 1993) . It should be noted that the earher study was carried out before any evidence existed for retention by membrane-spanning domains, a phenomenon first described for a viral protein (Swift and Machamer, 1991) and Golgi enzymes (Nilsson et al., 1991; Munro, 1991) . The expectation was that the signal would be found in the cytoplasmic domain and this appeared to be borne out by the appearance of protein on the cell surface. The likely reason for this, however, was that the levels of expressed protein were so high that they saturated the retention mechanism that operates on the membrane-spanning domain. Even cells expressing the wild-type protein (TGN38), containing both retention and retrieval signals, showed aberrant localization. After 24 h transfection, 50% of the cells had either fallen off the coverslip or showed cell surface staining (Luzio et al., 1990) . The more recent study by Bos et al. (1993) overcame this problem by using a similar expression vector (pSVL1) at a low transfection efficiency (~0.15%) to ensure more constant levels of expression in each cell. Unfortunately, their only assay was immunofluorescence microscopy and it was impossible to determine how much of the protein was still present in the Golgi apparatus. These problems did not arise in our system since the expressed levels of hybrid protein were lower and the distributions were quantitated in several independent ways. Two different reporter molecules were also used. However, it is conceivable that other small differences in the systems used are responsible for the apparent discrepancies. Wong and Hong (1993) , for example, found that the serine residue in the SDYQRL motif was important for Golgi localization, while Humphrey et al. (1993) found that an identical mutation in their system had no effect. Further studies using stable cell lines will be needed to resolve these differences.",

All of the retrieval signals so far characterized have been located in the cytoplasmic domains of proteins and many are based on tyrosine as the critical amino acid set in a particular motif (for review see Collawn et al., 1990; Pearse and Robinson, 1990; Kornfeld, 1992; Matter et ai., 1992) .

The mechanism of retention is still unclear though two possibilities have been proposed. TGN38 molecules could interact with their neighbors through the spanning domains forming kin oligomers so large that they can no longer enter vesicles budding from the TGN (Nilsson et al., 1994) . Alternatively, the length of the membrane-spanning domain might prevent forward movement of the protein past the TGN (Bretscher and Munro, 1993) . The latter seems less likely since the length of the membrane-spanning domain (19 amino acids) is longer than the estimated average for Golgi proteins (15 amino acids) but further work will be needed to determine whether either of these mechanisms, or a completely different one, are responsible for retention in the TGN.",

The predicted effect of its absence would be an increased flux of protein through the TGN to the cell surface. In other words, its absence should put a greatly increased load on to the retrieval system. As fast as the protein is retrieved and returned to the TGN, it would escape to the plasma membrane and need to be retrieved again. This would explain why CD4-C, which has the retrieval but not the retention signal, is present in both endosomes and at the plasma membrane even at low levels of expression. The rate-limiting step in retrieval is not endocytosis because the linear density of CD4-C at the plasma membrane was the same at both low and high levels of expression. The limiting step must be between endosomes and the TGN since CD4-C accumulates in endosomes as the expression level increases.",

This hybrid protein would be expected to leak very slowly to the cell surface, but, in the absence of a retrieval signal, it should accumulate there. One possibility is that the endocytic signal in the CD4 cytoplasmic domain (Shin et al., 1991 ) triggers movement to endosomes; another possibility is that the protein in the endosome is destined for degradation in lysosomes. This latter possibility is more likely for CDS-M which lacks an endocytic signal yet is found in small amounts in what appear to be endosomes by immunofluorescence microscopy.",

The sum of the two processes acting on these signals would determine the amount of protein found in a particular compartment. For resident proteins which should spend as much of their time as possible in a particular compartment one would expect retention rather than retrieval to be the dominant process. For recycling proteins, such as receptors, one would expect the opposite so that substantial amounts of protein would be moving between two compartments. It is not yet clear whether TGN38 is best considered as a resident or a recycling protein (Luzio and Banting, 1993; Stanley and Howell, 1993) . That will have to await discovery of its function.",

HeLa cells were fixed and stained with monoclonal antibody to CD8 and visualized using a secondary antibody conjugated to FITC. The gate on the x-axis (fluorescence units) was set using mock-transfected cells as a negative control. Cells scoring to the right of this point were regarded as positive for cell surface fluorescence (see Table I1).",
