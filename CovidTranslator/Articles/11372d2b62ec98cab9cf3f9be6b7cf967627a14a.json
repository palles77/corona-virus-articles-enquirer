Here, we have found that CARMA3, a scaffold protein previously shown to mediate NF-kB activation induced by GPCR and EGFR, positively regulates MAVS-induced NF-kB activation. However, our data suggest that CARMA3 sequesters MAVS from forming high-molecular-weight aggregates, thereby suppressing TBK1/IRF3 activation. Interestingly, following NF-kB activation upon virus infection, CARMA3 is targeted for proteasome-dependent degradation, which releases MAVS to activate IRF3. When challenged with vesicular stomatitis virus or influenza A virus, CARMA3-deficient mice showed reduced disease symptoms compared to those of wild-type mice as a result of less inflammation and a stronger ability to clear infected virus. Altogether, our results reveal the role of CARMA3 in regulating the balance of host antiviral and pro-inflammatory responses against RNA virus infection.",

This system utilizes pattern recognition receptors such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs) on the cell surface and cytosolic retinoic acid-inducible gene 1 (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs) to detect the invading pathogen (Baum and Garc\u00eda-Sastre, 2011; Janeway, 2013; Jiang et al., 2011a) . The RLR family of proteins is crucial for detecting viral RNA in cytosol. It is composed of RIG-I, melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5), and laboratory of genetics and physiology 2 (LGP2). RIG-I senses 5 0 -triphosphate RNA as well as short (<2-kb) double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and is essential for innate immunity to many single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) viruses, including influenza A virus (IAV), Sendai virus (SeV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), etc. In contrast, MDA5 recognizes longer dsRNA (>2 kb) and protects the host from infection of encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV), Theiler's virus, mengovirus, murine norovirus, and murine hepatitis virus (Kato et al., 2006; McCartney et al., 2008; Roth-Cross et al., 2008) .",

Upon binding of the CTD to viral RNA, RIG-I undergoes conformational changes, oligomerization, and exposure of the CARD domains to recruit a signaling adaptor called mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS). MAVS contains an N-terminal CARD domain, a proline-rich region, and a transmembrane domain (TMD) at the C terminus. The CARD domain is important for its interaction with upstream RLRs (Goubau et al., 2014; Kawai et al., 2005; Meylan et al., 2005; Seth et al., 2005; Xu et al., 2005) . The proline-rich region is required for the recruitment of multiple E3 ligases, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor (TNFR)-associated factors (TRAFs). The TMD domain is key for MAVS localization at the mitochondrial outer membrane. Upon activation, MAVS forms a functional prion-like structure at mitochondria and works as a platform to form a MAVS signalosome that further activates IKKa/IKKb/NEMO signaling and TBK1/ IKK\u03b5/NEMO signaling (Liu et al., 2013) .",

These cytokines are important to induce inflammatory responses and to restrict viral replication and spread (Dienz et al., 2012) . Elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines are closely correlated with severity of clinical diseases, including airway inflammation and acute lung injury during influenza infection in children (Chiaretti et al., 2013) . On the other hand, activation of the TBK1/IKK\u03b5/NEMO complex leads to activation of IRF3 and production type I interferons (IFNs), including IFNa and IFNb (Fitzgerald et al., 2003; Sankar et al., 2006; Zhong et al., 2008) . Type I IFNs are potent inducers for the expression of hundreds of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) in paracrine and autocrine fashions, which induce a cellular antiviral state on the target cells (Au et al., 1995; Schafer et al., 1998; Sun et al., 2010) . Recent mechanistic studies have found that, upon activation, MAVS forms a prion-like fibril at mitochondria and acts as an active platform for the recruitment of E3 ligases, including TRAF6, TRAF2, and TRAF5, through distinct TRAF-binding domains (Hou et al., 2011; Liu et al., 2013; Xu et al., 2014) .

CARMA3 is expressed only in non-hematopoietic cells, while CARMA1, a related protein, is expressed only in hematopoietic cells. The CARMA proteins share similar structure and functions, albeit with distinct tissue distribution. Upon activation, CARMA proteins form a complex with B cell lymphoma 10 (BCL10) and caspase-like protein mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma translocation protein 1 (MALT1), and the CARMA-BCL10-MALT1 (CBM) complex functions to activate the downstream IKK complex, leading to activation of NF-kB (Jiang and Lin, 2012) . Previous studies have shown that CARMA3 is crucial in mediating G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR)-and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-, but not TLR-or TNFR-, induced NF-kB activation (Grabiner et al., 2007; Jiang et al., 2011b; Klemm et al., 2007; McAllister-Lucas et al., 2007) . However, it is unknown whether CARMA3 also is involved in regulating the host responses to viral infection.",

Since CARMA3 is located in the genomic locus that contributes to host's susceptibility to viral infection and is involved in NF-kB signaling, we investigated its role in host antiviral response. Our data suggest that CARMA3 contributes to inflammatory and antiviral responses via regulating RIG-I/MAVS-induced TBK1/ IRF3 and NF-kB activation. We have found that CARMA3 deficiency resulted in the defect in VSV-and RNA-induced NF-kB activation and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, but, surprisingly, enhanced TBK1/IRF3 activation and production of type I IFN, thereby displaying a reduced viral load in VSV-infected cells and tissues. Mechanistic studies showed that CARMA3 inhibited IRF3 activation through blocking the formation of MAVS aggregation. Together, these results reveal that CARMA3 is a key molecule that regulates the balance between RNA virus infection-induced inflammatory and antiviral innate immune response.",

Since VSV is a neurotropic virus and brain is one of primary targeting tissues of VSV, we examined the viral load in brain of these mice. Interestingly, we found that viral loads were significantly higher in the olfactory bulbs (OBs) of the brain in WT mice than those in CARMA3 KO mice ( Figures 1E and 1F ), although smaller differences were found in spleen and lung of these mice (Figures S1E and S1F). Consistent with the low viral load in CARMA3 KO mice, we found that CARMA3 KO mice produced significantly higher levels of local IFNb in OBs ( Figure 1G ), whereas the expressions of IFNg and G-CSF in the brain of WT and CARMA3 KO mice were similar (Figures S1G and S1H). Similar to the response to IAV infection, we found that production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6, IL-1a, IL-1b, and TNF-a, in the sera of CARMA3 KO mice was significantly reduced compared to WT mice 2 days following VSV infection (Figures S1I-S1M).

Next we wanted to determine if BCL10 and MALT1 play a similar function as CARMA3 in response to virus infection. Similar to CARMA3 deficiency, BCL10 deficiency led to reduced expression of IL-6 but enhanced expression of IFNb and a higher level of IRF3 phosphorylated upon VSV infection or poly(I:C) treatment in primary MEF cells ( Figures 4A-4E) . Consistently, we observed reduced viral load in OBs of BCL10 KO mice compared to WT mice ( Figure 4F ). These results indicate that BCL10 plays a similar role as CARMA3 in response to virus infection.",

Since VSV infectioninduced NF-kB activation was partially defective but IRF3 activation was enhanced in CARMA3 KO MEF cells, we decided to examine whether NF-kB-targeted genes expressed at early time points post-infection might inhibit IRF3 activation. To test this possibility, WT MEF cells were pre-treated with NF-kB nuclear translocation inhibitor (NF-kBi) for 1 hr before VSV infection. Although NF-kBi pretreatment partially inhibited NF-kB activation ( Figure 5A ), it did not enhance but instead partially inhibited IRF3 phosphorylation ( Figure 5B ), indicating that it is not NF-kB-inducing genes suppressing IRF3 phosphorylation. To further support this conclusion, we transfected IkBa super-repressor (SR) mutant into immortalized MEF cells, and we found that, although expression of IkBa SR mutant could suppress VSV-induced NF-kB activation, it could not enhance IRF3 phosphorylation (Figures 5C and 5D) . Finally, to determine whether newly synthesized proteins regulate IRF3 activation, primary MEF cells were pretreated with protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX) before poly(I:C) transfection. Pretreatment with CHX did not alter IRF3 activation ( Figure 5E ). Therefore, the impaired NF-kB activation at early hours postinfection is not the cause for the enhanced IRF3 activation in CARMA3 KO MEF cells, indicating that CARMA3 regulates NF-kB and IRF3 activation through an independent event.",

When overexpressed in HEK293T cells, CARMA3 bound to MAVS but only weakly to RIG-I ( Figure 6A ), whereas BCL10 interacted with both MAVS and RIG-I ( Figure S6A ). In contrast, MALT1 could not bind to MAVS when overexpressed in HEK293T cells ( Figure S6B ). Furthermore, endogenous MAVS was capable of interacting with overexpressed CARMA3 or BCL10 in HEK293T cells (Figure 6B ). More interestingly, inducible interactions, but not constitutive interactions, were observed between endogenous MAVS and BCL10 or between endogenous MAVS and CARMA3 in CARMA3-reconstituted KO MEF cells (Figures 6C and 6D) . The dynamic interaction between MAVS and CARMA3 could be detected in both primary BCL10 Het and KO MEF cells ( Figure 6E ), whereas the MAVS-BCL10 interaction could only be detected in CARMA3 KO cells reconstituted with CARMA3, but not with its vector control ( Figure 6F ). These data suggested that BCL10 might be recruited to the MAVS-containing complex via CARMA3, but not vice versa. To address whether CARMA3 binds to MAVS through CARD-CARD interaction, we co-transfected HEK293T cells with MAVS and CARMA3 WT or truncate mutants ( Figures S6C and S6D ). We found that the C-terminal GUK domain, but not the CARD domain, of CARMA3 appeared to be critical for the binding to MAVS.",

Since CARMA3 binds to MAVS, we hypothesized that CARMA3 may block MAVS oligomerization. When CARMA3 was overexpressed together with RIG-I in HEK293T cells, CARMA3 was detected in the mitochondrial fraction in a dosedependent manner ( Figure 7A ). In contrast, only a very small fraction of RIG-I was isolated together with mitochondria ( Figure 7A ). This suggests that CARMA3 can be recruited to mitochondria and bind to MAVS. Importantly, overexpression of CARMA3 was able to disrupt the formation of endogenous MAVS aggregates in semi-denaturing detergent agarose gel electrophoresis (SDD-AGE) gel, which is 2% SDS resistant ( Figure 7A ). This is also the case for BCL10 ( Figures S7A and S7B ). To further confirm that CARMA3 blocks MAVS from forming aggregates, we infected primary MEF cells with VSV and isolated crude mitochondria. We observed significantly stronger formation of endogenous MAVS aggregates in CARMA3 KO MEF cells at 6 hr post-infection ( Figure 7B) , and, consistently, this stronger aggregation of MAVS in CARMA3 KO cells could be reverted when CARMA3 was reconstituted back into the CARMA3 KO MEF cells ( Figure 7C ). Together, these results indicate that CARMA3 plays a negative role in the assembly of MAVS aggregates upon virus infection.",

Interestingly, we found that HA-tagged CARMA3 protein was gradually reduced upon VSV infection (Figures 7D-7G) . However, this reduction in CARMA3 protein was rescued by pretreatment of cells with proteasome inhibitor MG132 ( Figures 7E  and 7F ). This indicated that, following VSV infection, CARMA3 is targeted for proteasome degradation. Therefore, we performed immunoprecipitaion with anti-HA agarose, and we found that a high amount of K48-ubiquitinated CARMA3 was observed in the presence of MG132 at 4 hr post-VSV infection ( Figure 7F ). However, in contrast to CARMA3, the protein level of BCL10 was not significantly altered following VSV infection ( Figure 7G ). Together, these results suggest that CARMA3 is targeted to proteasome-mediated degradation following RNA virus infection.",

            "text": "In this study, we reveal that CARMA3 is a regulator of RIG-I/ MAVS signaling. We have found that CARMA3 regulates RIG-I/ MAVS-mediated NF-kB and TBK1/IRF3 activation in a twophase mechanism ( Figure S7C ). Upon RIG-I activation, MAVS is first activated at early time points following viral infection, which can activate IKKa/IKKb/NEMO in a CARMA3/BCL10dependent manner. However, in this early phase of post-infection, MAVS is sequestered by the CARMA3/BCL10 complex via interaction, and, therefore, it cannot form the high-molecular weight aggregates, which is required for downstream activation of TBK1/IRF3 signaling. With time, CARMA3 is targeted to a proteasome-mediated degradation, which releases MAVS that forms the functional aggregates and activate TBK1/IRF3 signaling. Therefore, CARMA3 functions as a host factor to regulate the balance of the RIG-I/MAVS-induced two downstream signaling pathways for antiviral innate immune response and the pro-inflammatory response. On one hand, CARMA3 plays a positive role in MAVS-induced NF-kB activation, leading to the induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines, but, on the other hand, it plays a negative role in MAVS-induced TBK1/IRF3 activation and production of antiviral cytokines, type I IFNs (Figure S7C) . However, the precise mechanism as to how CARMA3 is targeted for ubiquitination-based proteasome degradation requires further investigation. In addition, it will be interesting to see if CARMA3 plays a general effect in response to other RNA viruses as well as DNA viruses that are typically not recognized by cytoplasmic RLRs. Different individuals display highly variable systemic symptoms in response to viral infection. However, host factors contributing to this variability are largely unknown. Recent studies suggest that the CARD10 gene, which encodes CARMA3, is located in a genomic locus that contributes to the host's susceptibility to RNA virus, such as IAV infection (Ferris et al., 2013) . Our data, showing the distinct regulation of CARMA3 in the pro-inflammatory response and the antiviral response, suggest that CARMA3 may be a gene contributing to the host's susceptibility to viral infection. Therefore, it will be important to find out whether CARMA3 protein expression levels or particular CARMA3 polymorphisms exist in different human populations, which may explain the variable susceptibility among different populations in response to virus infection.",

            "text": "CARMA3 is distinguished from many other mediators downstream of MAVS identified so far, which are either positive or negative mediators for both NF-kB activation and IRF3 activation. These mediators include NEMO, TRAF6, A20, and CYLD (Friedman et al., 2008; Liu et al., 2013; Maelfait et al., 2012; Parvatiyar et al., 2010; Saitoh et al., 2005; Zhao et al., 2007) . In contrast, CARMA3 deficiency led to reduced NF-kB activation but an increase in IRF3 activation. CARD9 is structurally related to CARMA3 and contains a CARD domain and a coiled-coil domain, but no MAGUK domain. CARD9 is primarily expressed in myeloid cells. In bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs), CARD9 deficiency resulted in defects in NF-kB activation and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-6 and IL-1b, in response to 5 0 ppp dsRNA treatment; however, it did not alter the production of type I IFN (Poeck et al., 2010) . In addition to CARD9, CARMA1 is expressed in myeloid cells. It will be interesting to find out how CARMA1, the counterpart of CARMA3 in hematopoietic cells, functions in mediating RIG-I/MAVS signaling in myeloid cells. In contrast to CARMA1, CARMA3, or CARD9, BCL10 is universally expressed. BCL10 functions similarly to CARD9 in BMDCs in response to 5 0 ppp dsRNA treatment, whereas, in primary MEF cells, it functions similarly to CARMA3 upon VSV infection or poly(I:C) treatment. This suggests that BCL10 may regulate RIG-I/MAVS signaling in a cell-type-specific manner.",

In this study, we found CARMA3 deficiency induced only partial defects in NF-kB activation, suggesting that CARMA3 may play an important role in TLR-independent NF-kB activation, which is induced by RIG-I/MAVS signaling. TLR-dependent NF-kB activation may play dominant roles in the induction of local IL-6 production in non-hematopoietic cells following RNA viral infection, which may explain why we do not observe a significant effect of CARMA3 deficiency in local IL-6 mRNA production in OBs following VSV infection.",

During viral infection, it is important to keep the inflammatory response under control to avoid severe tissue damage. Overly robust NF-kB activation or inflammation can lead to severe health consequences. For example, Ebola virus, a negative sense, singlestranded virus, is a highly virulent pathogen that causes a frequently lethal hemorrhagic fever syndrome, which is well correlated with the high inflammatory response that is induced in the host (Rasmussen et al., 2014) . Therefore, it is important to regulate inflammatory response to a safe level to prevent severe tissue damage in such patients during viral infection. CARMA3 deficiency leads to a reduced NF-kB activation and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Challenging WT mice with IAV induced a strong production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-6, and severe inflammation, lung injury, and significant weight loss, which were attenuated in CARMA3 KO mice, indicating that CARMA3 is a key molecule to regulating inflammatory responses in the host and potentially a therapeutic target.",

Therefore, the contribution of the enhanced IRF3 activation in the absence of CARMA3 not only counteracted the defect of NF-kB but also resulted in greater overall production of IFNb.

It is interesting that CARMA3 is gradually turned over following VSV infection, which may serve as a mechanism to turn off NF-kB activation, and, meanwhile, it releases MAVS to form functional aggregates to induce IRF3 activation. Further studies are necessary to determine the molecular mechanism as to how CARMA3 is targeted for K48 ubiquitination and degradation, and targeting CARMA3 for degradation may help to reduce inflammation while enhancing the antiviral response.
