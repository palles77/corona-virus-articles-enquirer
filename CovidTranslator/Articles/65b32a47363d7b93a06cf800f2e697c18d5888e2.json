Moreover, the role of respiratory viruses (RV) other than flu in influenza-like illness (ILI) and the effect of viral co-detections and/or co-infections in the clinical course of patients with influenza have rarely been evaluated, and this pandemic offered an opportunity to perform these studies.",

A multivariate analysis carried out in France revealed that ILI symptoms such as cough, dyspnea, hyperemia and chills were significantly associated with flu etiology 7 . In this study, only 28% of ILI were laboratory-confirmed flu, and other RV were detected, i.e., HRV, enterovirus (EV), hMPV, ADV, PIVs and human coronavirus (hCoV) OC43.

Temporal distribution of HRV-and A(H1N1)pdm09-positive cases in these studies suggested that changes in behavior, mainly those related to the beginning of the school period in mid-September when A(H1N1) pdm09 cases were expected to rise, favored an outbreak of HRV infection that delayed the epidemic by influenza A(H1N1)pdm09. Epidemiological results were explained on the basis of an interference phenomenon between both viruses. Thus, in these countries, most ILI cases within these weeks would have been due to HRV 18, 19 . In Spain, data obtained from three laboratories participating in this review, reveal differences in HRV and influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 temporal distributions. In Andalusia and the Basque Country, both HRV and pandemic flu seem to follow an independent course during September-December 2009. As expected, HRV cases increased when the school period began but coincided with an increase of A(H1N1) pdm09 cases as well, which reached their peak in late October in the Basque Country and in November in Andalusia. In contrast, in Asturias, the situation was similar to that reported in the French and Swedish studies (Fig. 3) .",

Moreover, each laboratory has been encouraged to reduce costs and time needed for reporting results, without a decrease in the quality of the diagnostic procedure. Figure 4 represents a possible stepwise algorithm of respiratory sample processing for viral detection that may give an efficient response to the current demand. First step: viral diagnosis in outpatients with mild ARI is not probably cost-effective, and should not be routinely performed, except for studies from Surveillance Programs or of epidemiological interest. Second step: antigen detection methods for RSV and/or flu may be enough for patients attended at emergency units that do not fulfill severity clinical criteria for hospitalization, except for pregnant women, patients with severe underlying conditions and other special situations. Third step: samples from patients requiring hospitalization with negative RSV or flu antigen results should be subjected to extended virological study including viral culture assays and/or NAAT targeted at more or less RV depending on the severity of the disease and the need for a rapid result. With this premise, NAAT for detection of RSV and flu (at the type and subtype level) in patients with less severe ARI who do not require admission at intensive care units (ICU) should be carried out first. Fourth step: on certain patients, multiplexed methods of low complexity could be performed including hMPV, HRV and PIV detection, depending on the patient's age and/or underlying diseases.",
