This observation is of immunological significance because such activated astrocytes can act as antigen-presenting cells, as demonstrated with myelin basic protein for antigen-specific encepbalitogenic T-cell lines 3 \u2022 However, the lack of lymphatic drainage in brain and the presence of the so-called blood-brain barrier restricting traffic of cells and macromolecules suggests that IFN-y may not be readily available, at least during the initial phases of viral infections. The question therefore arises as to whether astrocytes can be induced to express Ia antigens by other signals directly related to viral infection and possibly independent of IFN-y. In the present report we demonstrate that a neurotropic murine hepatitis virus induces expression of Ia antigen on astrocytes in tissue culture without infection, rendering these brain cells competent to participate directly in the immune response to a viral infection.",

Recombinant rat IFN-y induced the expression of Ia on numerous cells in the primary cultures, Fluorescence-activated cell sorting showed that 3-10% of the cells were induced to express Ia compared with the control after 18 h treatment with 10 U ml-1 IFN-y, reaching a maximum at 48 h, when 20% of all cells were induced (Fig. 1 a) . By immunofluorescence microscopy, Ia+ cells also became apparent after 18 h of treatment whereas control cultures showed no Ia + cells, Double immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that (1 ,000 NU ml -' ) Infectious JHM virus (10 3 PFU ml -I ) + Ultraviolet-inactivated JHM virus (10 3 PFU ml -I ) + JHM virus (glial or DBT cell-derived) +anti-rat IFN-y + JHM virus+a non-neutralizing anti-JHM antibody + J H M virus + a neutralizing anti-JHM antibody + , Detectable by immunofluorescence microscopy (induction of Ia in at least 2,500-5,000 cells per cm 2 ); -, undetectable by immunofluorescence microscopy (induction of Ia in 0-10 cells per cm 2 ). DMEM, Dulbecco's minimal essential medium; FCS, fetal calf serum. The stock preparation of recombinant rat IFN-y contained 1.2 x 10 5 U ml-I and 3 x 10 6 U per mg protein. Polyclonal rabbit antiserum to rat IFN-y, given by Dr van der Meide, contained 1.0 x 10 5 neutralizing units (NU) ml -' . JHM virus was obtained from tissue culture supernatants of cells infected with wild-type JHM murine coronavirus. Virus supernatants were produced from two different sources, primary glial cultures and a cell line permissive for JHM (designated DBT). The amount of virus in the supernatants was determined by titration (as PFU ml-I ) on DBT cells. Stock virus from DBT cells numbered 2 x 10 5 PFU ml -' and from primary glial cultures, 2 x 10 4 PFU ml -I , when the cytopathic effect reached 90 %. Virus preparations were completely inactivated with ultraviolet light (2,500 fL W cm-2 ) for 5 min. Conditioned supernatants from uninfected cultures served as the control for the virus supernatant preparations. Monoclonal antibody directed against the envelope glycoprotein E2 has been described elsewhere 9 . The neutralizing monoclonal antibody was used at a dilution sufficient to neutralize 10 5 PFU ml -I . Cultures were treated as indicated for 4 days, stained for Ia using OX6 monoclonal antibody, then examined by fluorescence microscopy as described in Fig. 2 legend. The total number of cells in lO-day cultures was, on average, 10 5 cells em -2.",

JHM virus at 10 3 PFU ml -1 gave the maximum response regardless of the source (Table 1) . Immunofluorescence microscopy of cultures treated with ultraviolet-inactivated JHM virus, using a polyclonal rabbit antiserum to JHM virus, confirmed the absence of infected cells throughout the cultures, indicating that there was no JHM virus replication. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting showed that -10% of ali cells in the cultures became la-positive (Fig. Ib) . Conditioned media from uninfected cultures, diluted correspondingly, had no effect on la expression. In contrast to rat IFN-y, JHM virus induced la primarily in the astrocytic cell population (Fig.2g-i) , 90-100% of macrophages remaining negative, as determined by double immunofluorescence microscopy. In addition, the kinetics of induction was distinct from that seen with rat IFN-y in that noticeable induction required at least 3-4 days of treatment, reaching a peak at 4-7 days. Double immunofluorescence analysis of GFAP and la showed that between 90 and 100% of the induced cells were astrocytes (Fig. 2g-i) .

Cultures were rinsed three times, then incubated with a 1 : 20 dilution of FITC-conjugated rabbit F(ab)2 anti-mouse immunoglobulin (Dakopatts, Denmark,) for 30 min. Cultures were rinsed with 0.12 M phosphate buffer pH 7.2, containing 1 % bovine serum albumin (BSA), removed from the culture dishes and mechanically dissociated by pipette aspiration. Mter addition of 0.2 fLg ml-1 propidium iodide, cells were analysed immediately. Gate window of forward angle light scatter (FALS) lay between channels 10 and 255 .

To determine whether the JHM virus had a direct effect on astrocytes or whether the effect was due to a secondary signal released by macrophages 8 or astrocytes themselves, astrocytic cultures depleted of macrophages were tested for their responsiveness to JHM virus. Macrophages were removed by panning of trypsinized primary cultures on hydrophobic plastic; the relatively non-adherent astrocytes remaining in suspension were removed and re-plated. After 4 days of treatment with 10 3 PFU ml-1 ultraviolet-inactivated virus, these astrocytes expressed la, just as in cultures containing macrophages. Supernatants derived from either pure macrophage cultures or mixed primary cultures, after incubation with inactivated JHM virus, failed to induce la on naive astrocytes. This result indicated that secondary soluble factors were not involved in the induction of Ia antigen on astrocytes.",

Parallel cultures stained for JHM antigen revealed no infected cells throughout the cultures. Methods. Primary glial cell cultures were established from newborn (1 day postnatal) Lewis rat brain as described previousli 6 . Six days after plating, at which stage the cultures were treated with IFN-y or JHM virus, three distinct cell populations were present: type I astrocytes, macrophages and A2B5+ precursors to both type II astrocytes and galactocerebroside-positive oligodendrocytes 17. Staining of Fc receptors was achieved by incubating live cultures with a 1: 100 dilution of normal mouse serum, followed by goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated to TRITC (Zymed, California), at 4\u00b0C (ref. 15 ). After fixation with 2% formaldehyde and permeabilization with 0.25% Triton X-I00, GFAP filaments were stained using a polyclonal rabbit IgG directed against GFAP (Dakopatts, Denmark) diluted 1: 250, followed by goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to FITC (Zymed). Staining of rat la and GFAP was as for Fc receptors and GFAP. A mouse monoclonal antibody directed against rat la (designated OX6; given by Dr D. W. Mason) was diluted to 20 f.Lg ml-1 IgG from hybridoma supernatant. As a control for the OX6 monoclonal antibody which is of the IgG 1 subclass, two different mouse monoclonal IgG 1 antibodies against unrelated antigens were tested and found to be negative. Staining of JHM virus antigen was performed as for GFAP, using a rabbit IgG fraction directed against JHM, diluted to 20 f.Lg ml-1 IgG.",

            "text": "Here, we have described the ability of a neurotropic virus to induce la molecules on astrocytes, and we have presented evidence that JHM virus exerts its effects on astrocytes through direct interaction. This phenomenon is independent of viral replication in astrocytes as ultraviolet-inactivated virus is effective in inducing Ia antigen. Moreover, a monoclonal antibody to the E2 glycoprotein which blocks virus binding to susceptible cells 9 , also blocks the induction of Ia antigen. These observations suggest that either binding of the virus to the surface of astrocytes through specific cell-surface receptors or phagocytosis of the virus particles initiates a series of events in astrocytes leading to Ia expression. The mechanism by which JHM virus induces Ia expression is unknown; it is conceivable that viral glycoproteins may act on particular target cells in the induction of la in a similar way to that described for bacterial endotoxin lo \u2022 The present results are particularly interesting as IFN-y released by T lymphocytes is thought to be indispensable in the induction of la antigen on certain antigen-presenting cells ll ,12, including astrocytes l -3 \u2022 Astrocytes could be especially effective antigen-presenting cells in the brain owing to their ubiquity and their ability to phagocytose, process and present antigen 3 , In the case of virus invasion of the CNS, this cell population may play an important part in mounting an immune response to effectively control the viral infection. On the other hand, high constitutive levels of la expression might carry the risk of inappropriate presentation of self antigens, as is thought to occur in autoimmune processes directed against the thyroid gland\\3. This phenomenon may have special relevance to brain antigens and la-expressing astrocytes as the development of immune tolerance to self brain antigens, including myelin, may be hampered by the blood-brain barrier. The induction of la on astrocytes by JHM virus probably has a role in the JHM virusinduced chronic demyelinating disease of Lewis rats, which involves induction of myelin basic protein-specific T lymphocytes 6 \u2022 The phenomenon reported here may represent a general feature of virus-astrocyte interactions and may have wider implications for human neurotropic viruses and the induction of immunologically mediated chronic demyelinating diseases l4 .",

            "text": "In mammals, the immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable region (V u) locus is organized in a linear fashion; individual V u, diversity (D u ), joining (J u ) and constant (C u ) region segments are linked in separate regions!. During somatic development, coding segments flanked by characteristic short recombination signal sequences, separated by intervening sequence regions that may exceed 2,000 kilobases (kb), are recombined. Combinatorial joining of different segments as well as imprecision in this process contribute to the diversity of the primary antibody response; subsequent mutation further alters functionally rearranged genes. This basic somatic reorganization mechanism is shared by six major families of genes encoding antigen receptors2. Previously, we have shown that multiple germline genes and mammalian-like recombination signal sequences are associated with the Vu gene family of Heterodontus franeisei (horned shark), a primitive elasmobranch 3 \u2022 Studies presented here demonstrate that segmental reorganization involving mammalian-like Du and J u segments occurs in the lymphoid tissues of this species. In marked contrast to the mammalian system, we find multiple instances of close linkage (-10 kb) between individual V u , D u , J u and C u segments. This unique organization may limit combinatorial joining and be a factor in the restricted antibody response of this lower vertebrate 4 ,5. A Heterodontus spleen poly(A)+ messenger RNA-complementary DNA library was constructed in the vector Agtll (ref. 6 ) and screened with a nick-translated probe that complements the entire coding region of HXIA, a Heterodontus germline V H gene 3 _ Multiple positive hybridizing plaques were detected and the structure of one of these, HC-3, is illustrated in Fig. 1 .
