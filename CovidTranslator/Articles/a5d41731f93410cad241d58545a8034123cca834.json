On January 24 10, 2020, the first whole-genome sequence of 2019-nCoV was released, which helped 25 researchers to quickly identify the virus in patients using reverse-transcription polymerase chain 26 reaction (RT-PCR) methods [3] . On January 21, the first article related to 2019-nCoV was 27 published, which revealed that 2019-nCoV belongs to the beta-coronavirus group, sharing 28 ancestry with bat coronavirus HKU9-1, similar to SARS-coronaviruses, and despite sequence 29 diversity its spike protein interacts strongly with the human ACE2 receptor [1] . On January 30, Coronaviruses are single-stranded positive-sense RNA viruses that possess large viral RNA 42 genomes [5] . Recent studies showed that SARS-CoV-2 has a similar genomic organization to 43 other beta-coronaviruses, consisting of a 5'-untranslated region (UTR), a replicase complex 44 (orf1ab) encoding non-structural proteins (nsps), a spike protein (S) gene, envelope protein (E) 45 gene, a membrane protein (M) gene, a nucleocapsid protein (N) gene, 3'-UTR, and several 46 unidentified non-structural open reading frames [3] . Although SARS-CoV-2 is classified into the 47 beta-coronaviruses group, it is diverse from MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. Recent studies 48 highlighted that SARS-CoV-2 genes share <80% nucleotide identity and 89.10% nucleotide 49 similarity with SARS-CoV genes [6, 7] . Usually, beta-coronaviruses produce a ~800 kDa 50 polypeptide upon transcription of the genome. This polypeptide is proteolytically cleaved to 51 generate various proteins. The proteolytic processing is mediated by papain-like protease (PL pro ) 52 and 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CL pro ). The 3CL pro cleaves the polyprotein at 11 distinct sites 53 to generate various non-structural proteins that are important for viral replication [8]. 3CL pro play 54 a critical role in the replication of virus particles and unlike structural/accessory protein-encoding 55 genes, it is located at the 3' end which exhibits excessive variability. Therefore, it is a potential 56 target for anti-coronaviruses inhibitors screening [9]. Structure-based activity analyses and high-57 throughput studies have identified potential inhibitors for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV 3CL pro 58",

It is highly similar to 208 bat SARS-like coronavirus 3CL pro , with some differences from other beta-coronaviruses. We 209 predicted the 3D structure of the SARS-CoV-2 3CL pro enzyme, and the findings may help 210 researchers working on COVID-19 drug discovery. Despite significant overall similarity with the 211 SARS-CoV 3CL pro structure, the SARS-CoV-2 3CL pro substrate binding site had some key 212 differences, which highlighted the need for rapid drug discovery to address the alarming 213 Postdoctoral research platform grant of Guangxi University.

As of January 31, 32 51 whole-genome sequences of 2019-nCoV from different laboratories and regions have been 33 submitted to GISAID database [4]. On the February 12 th , the WHO permanently named the 34 2019-nCoV pathogen as SARS-CoV-2 and the causing disease as coronavirus disease 2019 35 (COVID-2019). Chinese government swift actions helped them to control COVID-19 in China. 36 However, SARS-CoV-2 quickly spread to over 150 countries. On March 11 th , WHO formally 37 recognized the COVID-19 as a pandemic. By March 19 th , 2020, the global death toll reached to 38 9,913, with 2,42,650 laboratory-confirmed cases. The case fatality rate among infected people is 39 varying in different countries. However, global case fatality rate is presently around 3.92% 40 (calculated as deaths / [deaths + laboratory confirmed cases]).",

There were 12-point mutations (Val35Thr, Ser46Ala, Asn65Ser, 123Val86Leu, Lys88Arg, Ala94Ser, Phe134His, Asn180Lys, Val202Leu, Ser267Ala, Ser284Ala 124 and Leu286Ala) between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 3CL pro enzymes(Fig. S1). Except for 125 replacement of Leu with Ala at position 286, all other replacements conserve polarity and 126 hydrophobicity. However, these mutations may affect 3CL pro structure and function. Therefore, 127 the 3D structure of SARS-CoV-2 3CL pro was predicted. Firstly, a single chain monomeric model128 comprising all domains (Domain I = residues 8\u2212100; Domain II = residues 101\u2212183; Domain III 129 = residues 200\u2212303) was built (Fig. S2). N-terminal amino acids 1 to 7 form the N-finger that 130 plays a significant role in dimerization and formation of the active site of 3CL pro . Domains I and 131 II, collectively referred to as the N-terminal domain, includes an antiparallel \u03b2-sheet structure 132 with 13 \u03b2-strands. The binding site for the substrate is situated in a cleft between domains I and 133 II. A loop from residues 184 to 199 joins the N-terminal domain and Domain III, which is also 134 called the C-terminal domain and comprises an anti-parallel cluster of five \u03b1-helices. The overall 135 molecular architecture of SARS-CoV-2 3CL pro was in consistent with the crystal structure of 136 SARS-CoV (PDB ID: 3M3V); the root mean square deviation (RMSD) between the homology 137 model and the template was 0.629 \u00c5. Structural and Ramachandran plot analyses revealed that 138 99% of residues are in favourable regions. 139 After quality assessment, individual chains were combined to form a homodimeric 3D 140 structure, as shown in Fig. 1C. To facilitate other researchers, the predicted 3D model has been 141 submitted to the Protein Model Database (PMDB) [33], and anyone can download/use the 142 SARS-CoV-2 3CL pro final structure using PMDB ID: PM0082635. Further, mutational analyses 143 depicted none of the mutations affected the overall structure of SARS-CoV-2, which fully 144 superimposed on the SARS-CoV 3CL pro structure (Fig. 1D). The results also revealed that 145 SARS-CoV-2 has a Cys-His catalytic dyad (Cys-145 and His-41), consistent with SARS 3CL pro 146 (Cys-145 and His-41), TGEV 3CL pro (Cys-144 and His-41) and HCoV 3CL pro (Cys-144 and His-147 41) [34]. These results revealed that the SARS-CoV-2 3CL pro receptor-binding pocket 148 conformation resembles that of the SARS-CoV 3CL pro binding pocket and raises the possibility 149 that inhibitors intended for SARS-CoV 3CL pro may also inhibit the activity of SARSthis hypothesis, we docked (R)-N-(4-(tert-butyl)phenyl)-N-(2-(tert-butylamino)-2-oxo-1-153 (pyridin-3-yl)ethyl)furan-2-carboxamide), a potential noncovalent inhibitor of SARS-CoV 154 3CL pro named ML188 [35], with the SARS-CoV-2 3CL pro homology model. We also docked 155 ML188 with the SARS-CoV 3CL pro structure (PDB ID: 3M3V) as a reference, and ML188 156 bound strongly to the receptor binding site of SARS-CoV 3CL pro . The inhibitor targets the Cys-157His catalytic dyad (Cys-145 and His-41) along with the other residues, and the docking score (S 158 = -12.27) was relatively high. However, surprisingly, ML188 did not show significant binding to 159 the catalytic dyad (Cys-145 and His-41) of SARS-CoV-2, and the docking score (S = -8.31) was 160",
