The cytokines secreted following inflammasome activation, which include IL-1 and IL-18, regulate cells of both the innate and adaptive immune system, guiding the subsequent immune responses. In this study, we used murine coronavirus, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), infection of the central nervous system and liver to assess of the role of the inflammasome and its related cytokines on pathogenesis and host defense during viral infection. Mice lacking all inflammasome signaling due to the absence of caspase-1 and -11 were more vulnerable to infection, with poor survival and elevated viral replication compared to wildtype mice. Mice lacking IL-1 signaling experienced elevated viral replication but similar survival compared to wild-type controls. In the absence of IL-18, mice had elevated viral replication and poor survival, and this protective effect of IL-18 was found to be due to promotion of interferon gamma production in \u03b1\u03b2 T cells. These data suggest that inflammasome signaling is largely protective during murine coronavirus infection, in large part due to the pro-inflammatory effects of IL-18.",

These messengers, which include type 1 interferon, IL-6, TNF\u03b1, and others, can have direct anti-pathogen effects and help induce and guide the subsequent components of the innate immune response as well as the adaptive immune response. Innate inflammatory pathways are therefore key regulators of much of the host response to pathogens. Many pathways can also drive damaging pathological effects when improperly regulated; so, studying these pathways can aid in both treatment of inflammatory diseases and improvement of host responses to pathogens.",

            "text": "One innate inflammatory pathway is the inflammasome. The inflammasome is a multimeric protein complex that forms in the cytosol following detection of a diverse range of ligands, and which is responsible for activation of caspase-1 (Martinon et al. 2002) . Caspase-1 in turn processes members of the IL-1 family of cytokines into their active forms (Howard et al. 1991; Thornberry et al. 1992; Gu et al. 1997; Ghayur et al. 1997) leading to their secretion. These cytokines, including IL-1\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-18, are pro-inflammatory and induce a variety of immunomodulatory effects, capable of leading to both host protection and damaging pathological response. IL-1\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 induce recruitment of neutrophils (Lee et al. 2015) , polarize T cells to adopt a Th17 phenotype (Chung et al. 2009 ), and promote DC activation for priming (Ichinohe et al. 2009; Ramos et al. 2012) . IL-18 signaling promotes production of interferon gamma (Okamura et al. 1995; Kohno et al. 1997; Bellora et al. 2012; Serti et al. 2014 ) and cytotoxicity (Okamura et al. 1995; Dao et al. 1996; Tsutsui et al. 1996) in a variety of cell types. Characterization of the role of the inflammasome and its related cytokines during viral infection is ongoing. While it has been shown that a viroporin protein of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus activates the NLRP3 inflammasome, possibly contributing to disease severity (Nieto-Torres et al. 2015) and that inflammasome activation enhances pathology in a murine model of fulminant hepatitis (Guo et al. 2015) , little other data are available regarding inflammasome activation in the context of coronavirus infection.",

We demonstrate a protective role for the inflammasome as a whole and a role in control of viral replication but not survival for IL-1 signaling. IL-18 was found to be critically important for host defense, with poor survival and elevated viral replication in mice lacking IL-18 signaling. IL-18 signaling was demonstrated to promote interferon gamma production in activated T cell populations and to be crucial for global interferon gamma responses, and we therefore conclude that the inflammasome-related protein IL-18 improves host defense through the promotion of interferon gamma production in T cells.",

Wild-type C57Bl/6 (WT) or C57Bl/6 mice lacking caspase-1 and -11 (Casp-1/11 \u2212/\u2212 ) were challenged with 5000 plaque forming units (PFU) of MHV, inoculated i.c., and survival was monitored. Casp-1/11 \u2212/\u2212 mice were found to be acutely vulnerable to this infection, with roughly 40% survival compared to 90% survival among WT mice (Fig. 1a) . These data demonstrate that inflammasome signaling is critical to host defense during MHV infection. To better understand what role the inflammasome plays in host defense, the magnitude of viral replication in infected organs was assessed. Mice were inoculated i.c. with 500 PFU of MHV, a nonlethal dose chosen to allow mice to survive the length of the experiment. Three, five, and seven days after infection mice were euthanized and the magnitude of viral replication in the brain, spinal cord, liver, and spleen was determined by plaque assay (Fig. 1b) . Replication in the brain and spinal cord were the same in Casp-1/11 \u2212/\u2212 and WT mice, suggesting that overall inflammasome signaling is not relevant for control of infection within the CNS. Viral replication was elevated in the liver 5 days after infection, and in the spleen, 3 and 5 days after infection in the Casp-1/11 \u2212/\u2212 relative to WT, suggesting that infection of peripheral organs may be partially controlled by inflammasome signaling.",

We next sought to determine why the loss of IL-18 signaling leads to this phenotype. IL-18 acts on T cells, NK cells, and NKT cells to promote interferon gamma production (Okamura et al. 1995; Nagarajan and Kronenberg 2007; Bellora et al. 2012; Serti et al. 2014 ) as well as cytotoxicity, often through promoting perforin production (Okamura et al. 1995; Dao et al. 1996; Tsutsui et al. 1996) . Both interferon gamma and perforin-mediated cell killing are important for host defense during MHV infection Bergmann et al. 1999; Martinon et al. 2002; Bergmann et al. 2003; Ramakrishna et al. 2004 ); so, we hypothesized that in the absence of IL-18 signaling, mice develop an immunodeficiency that makes them vulnerable to MHV infection. We began by determining the concentration of interferon gamma in the serum of infected WT and IL-18R \u2212/\u2212 mice, hypothesizing that if one or more cell types produce interferon gamma in an IL-18-dependent manner during MHV infection, we might be able to observe a global decrease in interferon gamma production. Mice were infected with 500 PFU of MHV, and 3, 5, and 7 days after infection serum was isolated. Five days after infection, at the peak of interferon gamma production and viral titers, IL-18R \u2212/\u2212 mice had significantly lower cytokine concentrations (Fig. 4) , despite slightly higher viral loads in several organs. This suggests that IL-18R \u2212/\u2212 mice have a defect in interferon gamma production. By 7 days after infection, higher interferon gamma levels are observed in IL-18R \u2212/\u2212 mice, which we speculate to be due to IL-18-independent sources reacting to elevated viral loads in the knockout mice compared to WT mice. This IL-18-independent production of interferon gamma may be insufficient to rescue these mice this late in the infection.",

The T cell response is not expected to be fully developed by 5 days after MHV infection, so we isolated cells 7 days after infection at the peak of the T cell response.

CD4 and CD8 T cells with elevated surface expression of CD44 + or CD11a + were gated on, and the percent (Fig. 7b ) and total number (Fig. 7c ) of these cells with elevated levels of interferon gamma were quantified. Production of interferon gamma was similar between cells from WT and IL-18R \u2212/\u2212 mice with the exception of two subsets. The percent of CD44 high CD4 T cells with elevated interferon gamma levels was higher in cells from WT mice compared to those from IL-18R \u2212/\u2212 mice, and the number of CD11a high CD8 T cells with elevated interferon gamma levels was higher in WT than IL-18R \u2212/\u2212 mice. Although serum concentrations of interferon gamma are higher in IL-18R \u2212/\u2212 mice at this time point, it is possible that production of this cytokine by other cell types in response to the elevated viral loads is masking defective production by T cells, and that the reduction of interferon gamma production by T cells in IL-18R \u2212/\u2212 mice could lead to the poor survival and elevated viral replication observed in these mice.",

Although mice lacking caspase-1 and caspase-11, and therefore both the canonical and non-canonical inflammasomes, are more vulnerable to MHV infection (Fig. 1) , examination of the individual roles of two inflammasome-related cytokines, IL-1 and IL-18, demonstrated a greater complexity. IL-1 signaling was found to control viral replication to some degree (Fig. 2d) , but appeared to exert a slight pathological effect, with mice lacking IL-1 signaling more likely to survive infection than those with an intact pathway, despite higher viral loads (Fig. 2c) . We have shown that IL-18 is protective, improving both survival and control of viral replication (Fig. 2a, b) . IL-18 signaling increased concentrations of interferon gamma in the serum (Fig. 5) , although by 7 days after infection, when viral titers are significantly higher in IL-18R \u2212/\u2212 mice, IL-18independent sources of interferon gamma may compensate for the loss of IL-18, and elevated levels of interferon gamma are observed in IL-18R \u2212/\u2212 compared to WT. We have shown that certain T cell subsets have decreased production of interferon gamma in IL-18R \u2212/\u2212 mice compared to WT mice, and IL-18-dependent interferon gamma production from T cells may account for the reduced cytokine levels in the serum. This interferon gamma defect likely accounts for the poor survival of both Casp-1/11 \u2212/\u2212 and IL-18R \u2212/\u2212 animals.",

We believe that this is due to one of two factors; inflammasome-independent processing of IL-18, likely by calpains and other proteases on the surface of cells that process immature IL-18 secreted by dying cells (Sugawara et al. 2001; Omoto et al. 2006; Chung et al. 2009; Omoto et al. 2010 ) may be protective, or the loss of pathogenic inflammasome substrates in Casp-1/11 \u2212/\u2212 mice. The former hypothesis is supported by the presence of IL-18 in the serum of some Casp-1/11 \u2212/\u2212 mice (Fig. 3) . However, the levels of inflammasome-independent IL-18 observed are quite low and may not be sufficient to produce any protective effects. Although we have not generated any data that supports the latter hypothesis, there are numerous substrates for the inflammasome, and beyond IL-1, IL-18, and IL-33, they have not been well characterized.",

            "text": "Our finding that IL-1 exerts a minimal effect on survival (Fig. 2c) was surprising, as recent studies with IAV (Ichinohe et al. 2009; Ramos et al. 2012 ) and WNV (Okamura et al. 1995; Kohno et al. 1997; Bellora et al. 2012; Ramos et al. 2012; Serti et al. 2014 ) have found that IL-1 signaling is critical to induction of a protective T cell response during infection with these viruses. IL-1 mediates this effect through promotion of DC activation, and mice lacking IL-1 signaling possessed defective DCs and a poorly primed T cell response (Okamura et al. 1995; Dao et al. 1996; Tsutsui et al. 1996; Pang et al. 2013; Durrant et al. 2013) . As IL-1R \u2212/\u2212 mice actually have slightly improved survival during high-dose MHV infection (Fig. 2c) , we do not believe that IL-1 signaling is critical for T cell priming in our model, although the slight elevation in viral replication (Fig. 2d) could be due to a minor T cell defect. The mechanistic Fig. 5 Interferon gamma production is IL-18-independent in cells from the liver but IL-18-dependent in cells from the spleen. WT and IL-18R \u2212/\u2212 mice were inoculated i.c. with 500 PFU of MHV and 5 days later cells isolated from the spleen and liver. Cells were seeded into plates and incubated for 16 h, and interferon gamma concentration of the culture supernatant was determined by ELISA. Data are pooled from two independent experiments. Statistical significance was determined by a two-part test using a conditional t test and proportion test (**P < 0.01) explanation for why IL-1 signaling is critical for DC function during some infections but not others is unknown, and beyond the scope of this work. During IAV infection, IL-1 signaling appears to replace the need for PRR signaling on DCs (Roth-Cross et al. 2008; Pang et al. 2013) . It is possible that during MHV infection PRR signaling is sufficient to induce activation, removing the need for IL-1 signaling. IL-18 has been shown in previous studies to promote cytotoxicity and interferon gamma production in numerous cell types, including T cells and NK cells (Okamura et al. 1995; Dao et al. 1996; Tsutsui et al. 1996; Kohno et al. 1997; Ichinohe et al. 2009; Bellora et al. 2012; Ramos et al. 2012; Serti et al. 2014 ). We observed a significantly lower concentration of interferon gamma in the serum of IL-18R \u2212/\u2212 mice as Fig. 7 T cells from the spleens of IL-18R \u2212/\u2212 mice at the peak of the T cell response exhibit reduced interferon gamma production compared to those from WT mice. WT and IL-18R \u2212/\u2212 mice were inoculated i.c. with 500 PFU of MHV. Seven days after infection, cells were isolated from the spleen and immunophenotyped by flow cytometry. Production of interferon gamma was determined by intracellular staining. Representative staining of interferon gamma production by CD4 + CD44 + cells is shown (a). The percent (b) and number (c) of CD11a high or CD44 high CD4 and CD8 T cells with elevated interferon gamma production was determined. Data is pooled from three independent experiments. Statistical significance was determined by an unpaired, twotailed t test (*P < 0.05; **P < 0.01) Fig. 6 T cells from WT and IL-18R \u2212/\u2212 spleens have similar activation profiles at the peak of the response. WT and IL-18R \u2212/\u2212 mice were inoculated i.c. with 500 PFU of MHV. Seven days after infection cells were isolated from the spleen and immunophenotyped by flow cytometry. The percent (a) and number (b) of CD4 and CD8 T cells with elevated expression of the activation markers CD44 or CD11a was determined. Data are pooled from three independent experiments. Statistical significance was determined by an unpaired, two-tailed t test compared to WT mice 5 days after infection (Fig. 5) , which we believe to stem from defective cytokine production from splenic cells (Fig. 6) . No defect was observed in T cells isolated from the liver, suggesting that the role of IL-18 may be organ specific. IL-12 signaling might compensate for the loss of IL-18 signaling in the liver. By 7 days after infection, interferon gamma levels were higher in IL-18R \u2212/\u2212 mice compared to WT mice, which we attribute to IL-18-independent sources of the cytokine responding to the increased viral replication. However, the decreased interferon gamma levels 5 days after infection, at the peak of interferon gamma production, suggest that interferon gamma production is largely dependent on IL-18 signaling during MHV infection. This may account for the poor survival and control of viral replication of IL-18R \u2212/\u2212 mice (Fig. 2a, b) . In order to determine if T cells specifically require IL-18 signaling for full interferon gamma production, we isolated cells from the spleen 7 days after infection and assessed their production of interferon gamma by intracellular staining and flow cytometry. We found reduced cytokine production in CD44 + CD4 T cells and CD11a + CD8 T cells from the spleen 7 days after infection. Although these defects were detectable only 7 days after infection, when interferon gamma levels were higher in IL-18R \u2212/\u2212 mice than WT mice, we speculate that they are indicative of a general defect in the T cell response that leads to the susceptibility of IL-18R \u2212/\u2212 mice to MHV infection. The elevated interferon gamma levels in the serum may not be present early enough in infection, or at high enough concentrations at the sites of infection, to compensate for the reduced interferon gamma production by activated T cells, suggesting that IL-18 signaling may play a cell type, organ, and/or temporally specific, but nonetheless critical, role during MHV infection.",
