The etiologic roles of the infectious agents in this condition are not yet well established, although NEC has been reported in neonates during the course of bacterial, viral, and mycotic infections (2) . In this paper, we describe a full-term neonate who developed NEC in the course of sepsis caused by Streptococcus agalactiae. To our knowledge, NEC has not been previously reported in association with this microorganism.",

Examination on admission showed an ill-appearing, cyanotic, and poorly perfused newborn who had a blood pressure of 53/36 mm Hg, a pulse of 195 beats/min, and respiratory rate of 84lmin. The rectal temperature was 38\u00b0C. The infant had respiratory distress and auscultation revealed bilateral hypoventilation and tachycardia. The liver was palpated 4 cm below the right costal margin. She was hypotonic and hypoactive. The anterior fontanelle was flat and there were no meningeal signs.",
