            "text": "To maximize their capacity to save lives and optimize resource allocation, animal shelters need to identify highly adoptable animals that are unlikely to be delayed on medical grounds before they can be made available for adoption. In this retrospective cohort study, our objective was to identify risk factors for delays from intake to approval for adoption on medical grounds in shelter puppies and kittens. Shelter medical records from 2008 for 335 puppies and 370 kittens were selected randomly at a large metropolitan adoption-guarantee shelter. Data including signalment, source shelter, intake veterinary examination findings, clinical history and days from intake until approval by a veterinarian for adoption on medical grounds were extracted from shelter records and analyzed using multivariate Cox regression. Puppies and kittens with clinical signs of respiratory or gastrointestinal disease at intake took significantly longer to receive approval for adoption on medical grounds (puppies -respiratory p<0.0001; gastrointestinal p<0.0001; kittensrespiratory p<0.0001; gastrointestinal p=0.002). Stray kittens were more likely to be delayed than owner-relinquished kittens or those transferred from other shelters (p<0.01). Older kittens were less likely to be delayed (p<0.0001). Administration of oral or parenteral antibiotics to puppies and kittens with respiratory and/or ocular signs within 24 hours of intake significantly reduced time to approval on medical grounds for adoption (puppies p=0.02; kittens p=0.03). The analyses suggested that puppies and kittens with respiratory or gastrointestinal signs on intake are more likely to experience delays between intake and veterinary approval for adoption on medical grounds. Prompt antimicrobial treatment of animals with respiratory and/or ocular signs may decrease length of stay in the shelter.",

Since shelters are composed of populations of animals, a focus on population management is an essential component of maintaining the health of individual shelter pets. The concepts developed for efficient management of emergency room triage in human hospitals are relevant to animal shelters, since they maximize the utilization of the available facilities for an incoming population (Albin et al., 19750) . Medical triage protocols are used to guide resource allocation during resource scarcities and under ideal circumstances are based on evidence and ethical principles (Christian et al., 2006) . Similarly, individualized evidence-based protocols could be used as management tools to guide animal selection and care in an animal shelter.",

PAWS Chicago is an adoption-guarantee shelter that sources its intake mainly from the local municipal shelter, Chicago Animal Care and Control, but also accepts some transferred animals from other shelters within the same region. Puppies and kittens are selected for admission to PAWS Chicago daily by shelter staff, who make their selection decisions based on the requirements of the PAWS Chicago Adoption Center regarding breed size for puppies and coat color for kittens. On intake, puppies are housed separately from adult or ill dogs. Kittens are separated from other shelter cats and kittens according to day of intake or by age. All healthy animals are sent to foster homes, depending on availability, within 2-7 days. Foster carers sometimes take animals with mild clinical signs of illness, but only if the animal is still eating and requires only oral medication, if any. Any unwell animals that require injectable medications or daily recheck examinations by a shelter veterinarian are housed at the shelter. Treatments are usually administered to these animals while they are in their cages, but sometimes treatments are given during recheck veterinary examinations in a consulting room at the shelter.",

Tests of Cox regression assumption were conducted for each species to ensure that model assumptions were not violated. This test evaluates non-zero slope in a generalized linear regression of the scaled Schoenfeld residual for both individual variables and the global model over time. The null hypothesis (zero slope) of the test is that the log hazard-ratio function does not change over time, indicating that the model assumptions were not violated (Schoenfeld, 1982; Therneau and Grambsch, 1994) .

However, our results could provide a useful starting point for other kinds of shelters where decisions are made about animal selection in the face of limited resources. It would be interesting to repeat this study at an openadmission shelter, or at a shelter in a more rural location to compare the results and draw conclusions about why differences (or similarities) in risk factors for delays to approval for adoption may occur. In order to achieve the end goal of maximizing lives saved, animal selection also needs to take into account the types of animals being presented to shelters and the needs and preferences of potential adopters. The concepts of shelter supply and demand may modify selection against potentially at-risk animals, so the results of this study could be used instead to develop targeted recommendations for extra care in at-risk animals.",

A limitation of this study is the lack of microbiological data for the animals with respiratory and/oral ocular disease on intake, but most shelters do not have the resources for diagnostic testing prior to treatment or final disposition. A previous study on respiratory disease in shelter cats found that the most common pathogens were feline herpesvirus (FHV), feline calicivirus (FCV), Bordetella bronchiseptica, Chlamydophila felis, and Mycoplasma species (Bannasch and Foley, 2005) . Our study confirms the results of another study of shelter cats, which reported that cats with upper respiratory infections (URI) tended to be younger than uninfected cats and that purulent ocular and nasal discharge was commonly associated with all URI pathogens investigated (Bannasch and Foley, 2005) . Canine kennel cough complex is caused by Bordetella bronchiseptica (Bemis et al., 1977) and/or co-infecting viruses or bacteria and is a significant cause of morbidity in shelter dogs (Appel and Percy, 1970) .",

It is possible that kittens that have been owned or have previously been taken into a shelter are more likely to have been vaccinated than stray kittens, thereby reducing their risk of developing feline panleukopenia or the more severe clinical effects of FHV and/or FCV. Additionally, the immune system in older kittens is also more likely to be developed than in younger kittens, although waning maternally-derived immunity could reduce the protection afforded by age. However, a recent study documenting the response to vaccination of feral cats at the time of neutering reported that only some of the cats had protective serum antibody titers against FPV (33%), FHV (21%) and FCV (64%) (Fischer et al., 2007) . It could be speculated therefore that maternally-derived immunity against these common shelter pathogens in stray kittens is not common, in part explaining the higher risk for delays on medical grounds before clearance for adoption in younger kittens.",

The decision to prescribe antibiotics was made purely on the clinical judgment of the attending shelter veterinarian and it is possible that bias could have been introduced if the animals that received antibiotic treatment had initially presented with more severe clinical signs. However, if that was the case, treated animals would be less likely to reach approval on medical grounds for adoption before untreated animals -the opposite of the findings reported here. Our findings agree with the results of previous studies which reported that prolonged shelter time was a major risk factor for feline URI 3 and the development of coughing in dogs (Edinboro et al., 2004) . Early antimicrobial treatment of puppies and kittens with respiratory and/or ocular signs admitted to animal shelters is also likely to be cost effective, as the cost of most antimicrobial drugs compare favorably with the daily costs of providing shelter care.",
