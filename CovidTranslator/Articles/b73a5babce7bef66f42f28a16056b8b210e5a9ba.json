The assessment found limited infection prevention and control programming and activities. Kiribati was visited again in 2005 to review infection prevention and control capacity. This 2005 review found evidence of significant improvements in the overall program, increased activities and what appeared to be genuine enthusiasm for infection prevention and control. A progressive adoption of infection prevention and control activities was evident and it appeared that a comprehensive program would result.

The most populated islands are South Tarawa, North Tarawa and Kiritimati Island with urban growth rates of 5.2%, 4.8% and 8% respectively. 8 Compared with most other Pacific islanders, I-Kiribati have a short life expectancy of 65 years for males and 70 years for females. 8 The health system of Kiribati is publicly funded with government spending $13.45 million USD in 2008, primarily on curative services, pharmaceuticals and staffing. 8 Significant technical and financial assistance is provided to the Ministry of Health by development partners. 9 The formal health system is administered by the central Ministry of Health. Traditional healers provide a parallel service offering local medicines, massage, antenatal, childbirth and postnatal care. Most people use both services though there is no coordination between them. 8 Primary health care is provided through a network of 92 health centres and dispensaries. Basic hospital services are available at South Tarawa (Betio), Kiritimati Island and North Tabiteuea. Secondary care is provided by the 130-bed national referral hospital, Tungaru Central Hospital in South Tarawa. Acute-care services include surgery, obstetrics, paediatrics, internal medicine, special-care nursery and tuberculosis treatment. Patients requiring tertiary-care services may be referred overseas for treatment if they meet the criteria defined by the Ministry of Health.",

Classic Diffusion of Innovations theory describes '. . .the process by which an innovation is communicated through certain channels over time among the members of a social system' (p. 5). 11 Diffusion of innovations theory has its roots firmly embedded in agriculture and geography. The concepts central to this theory were first described in the 1930s by researchers studying the adoption of hybrid corn in farming. Whilst observing the process they noticed patterns of communication and influence amongst farmers. 12 Since then Everett Rogers has been primarily responsible for the scholarly development of diffusion of innovations theory. 11, [13] [14] [15] [16] Other scholars who have contributed significantly to the development of the theory include Brown, Downs, Mohr, Tornatzky and Fleischer. [17] [18] [19] The classic diffusion of innovations theory as it relates to organisations provides a framework through which the adoption of IPCPs can be examined. In every diffusion research study, program or campaign, four key elements are always present: 1 an innovation, 2 communication channels, 3 time, and 4 a social system. 11, 13, 14 These elements inform the process, whether for an individual or for an organisation. It is Implications * Diffusion of Innovations is a model that can be successfully used in the adoption of comprehensive infection prevention and control programs in the low and middle income country setting. * An event such as a worldwide infectious disease outbreak can be an important impetus to identify gaps in health service provision, providing an opportunity for growth.",

When examining the diffusion of an IPCP in a healthcare environment the innovation 1 would be the program.

Time 3 includes the rate of adoption, the innovation-decision process and the innovativeness of the individual or organisation. The social system 4 is the healthcare environment and infrastructure where the adoption is to take place. Together, these four elements work to create an environment and context where the new innovation (the IPCP) is established and embedded, and conditions emerge which encourage an organic evolution of the innovation to more directly solve the targeted organisation problems, in this case the prevention of HAI. This organic evolution follows a staged adoption process in an organisation, such as the Kiribati healthcare organisation. The stages are: 1 agenda-setting, 2 matching, 3 redefining and restructuring, 4 clarifying and 5 routinising. 11 The process is not entirely linear and is responsive to the four key elements previously mentioned.",

Given the social system within the Kiribati healthcare organisation and the role of hierarchy, the decision to adopt was not undertaken by one person alone, rather a shared authority of senior staff.

An indicator for the sustainability of an innovation is the degree to which the individuals within the organisation have been involved in the process including its reinvention to fit the needs of the organisation. 11 A key method for the elimination of barriers in the adoption of an IPCP is the involvement of key stakeholders and opinion leaders. In the Kiribati case, participation of healthcare workers in the innovation process was evident. As previously discussed, broad involvement occurred from the beginning of implementation and was fundamental in the matching stage of the initiation sub-process. Participation allowed the identification and adaptation of appropriate resources and tools for the IPCP. This has assisted in the IPCP being a sustainable innovation in the Kiribati healthcare environment. The founding of regular IPCP activities applicable and delivered across all health services demonstrated the routinising of the program in Kiribati. From 2009 until the present, the activities of the IPCP continue and are accepted as part of the delivery of healthcare in Kiribati. It has now become part of the continuous quality improvement process, a fixture of the education program, a source of advice and information.

Of these reviews the major problems identified are: * most LMI countries have weak or absent IPCP * IPCP are often unidirectional, focusing on only one or a few interventions such as antibiotic usage * local studies and local expertise are not utilised in developing an IPCP * appropriate resource allocation to the health sector and delivery system is not addressed * human resources are not adequately developed to support IPCP adoption * limited equipment and consumable items such as sharps containers, sterilisers, disinfectants, PPE, running water and electricity are available. 5, 7, [30] [31] [32] [33] Given these barriers identified for other LMI countries, Kiribati appears to have demonstrated a concerted effort to adopt infection prevention and control activities which together create a comprehensive IPCP. In the context of the classic diffusion of innovations framework, this can also be described as a technology cluster or innovation package. Rogers identifies a technology cluster as a group of individual components that are closely inter-related and that can be adopted as a package of technology or innovation package. 11 In the Kiribati case there is evidence, supported by the IPCPE and healthcare worker survey, of the adoption of infection prevention and control activities or innovation package which has evolved into an IPCP.",

Pearson correlation analysis revealed a significant relationship between knowledge, application and confidence in applying infection control precautions as shown in Table 3 . 22 What is interesting in the Kiribati case is that the healthcare organisation appears to have been able to address issues that often prevent the adoption of IPCP in other LMI countries.

This is demonstrated through application of the staged model of Diffusion of Innovations for Organisations. The routinisation of the program is confirmed through the evaluation of the current IPCP and the status of healthcare workers' infection control knowledge and skill and their confidence in applying this in practice. This case clearly identifies the importance of involving the end users in the innovation process as well as the particular role of champions in supporting implementation. The Kiribati case illustrates how an IPCP can be adopted with little involvement from external agencies and how important it is to recognise performance gaps to catalyse change in the healthcare environment. The awareness of staff within the health system to identify opportunities is paramount as is their ability to motivate change and seek the resources to enable it.
