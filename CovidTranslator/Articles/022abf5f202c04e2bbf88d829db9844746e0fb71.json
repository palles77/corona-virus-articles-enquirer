Therefore, human vaccine development is very expensive and time consuming. These factors are a large obstacle, resulting in a reduction in the vaccine research and development industry. However, for animals, these new technologies and various adjuvants have already been used. Before using new types of vaccines or their components for humans, it is very useful to use them for animals as a transition study. Through animal vaccine trials, we can obtain valuable information that could be applied to human vaccine development [4] .",

Over 200 diseases are currently classified as zoonoses, which are global or inherent to a specific region of the world (WHO 2015) . There are numerous modes of zoonotic disease transmission. Human can be infected through insects such as mosquitoes and ticks, handling or eating undercooked or raw meat, or coming into contact with the blood, urine, or feces of an infected animal. Regarding the progress of zoonoses, human-animal contact plays an important role. Considering the diversity of transmission, the relationship among humans, animals, and the source of the disease, zoonoses exert a tremendous impact on public health. Therefore, the development of animal vaccines has a critical function to prevent humans from infection with pathogens by removing the root cause of the infected animal. New upcoming agents could be prevented with effective animal vaccines developed against such pathogens timeously. Simultaneously, as the frequency and administration of animal vaccines increase, the influence of animal vaccines on public health expands [5] .",

After beginning PCV2 vaccination, farm swine mortality decreased dramatically. Despite these PCV2 vaccines being killed vaccines, they showed effective disease preventive efficacy. We compared the PCV2 virus detection rate in abortion cases, as a good example of PCV2 vaccine efficacy because the PCV2 virus can infect the fetus during pregnancy [9] . Before PCV2 vaccine inoculation, the detection rate of PCV2 in fetuses was 58.9%. However, in 2012, the detection rate of PCV2 in fetuses decreased to 0.9% (Fig. 2) . The killed PCV2 vaccine made this possible because they were made from PCV2 virus-like particles (VLPs). As the PCV2 VLP is able to show similar immunogenicity with the native PCV2 virus, the sera induced by PCV2 VLP can show strong reactions with na\u00efve PCV2 antigens [10] .",

As VLPs are comprised of one or more proteins arranged geometrically into dense, repetitive arrays, it can induce a strong immune response [12] . In addition to inducing strong B-cell responses, VLPs also can induce T-cell responses efficiently through interactions with antigen presenting cells, particularly dendritic cells, and VLPs are processed and presented by MHC II molecules for the activation of T-helper cells [12] .

As that VLP vaccine was made with a baculovirus expression system in an insect cell, it did not require a bio-safety level three barrier facility for production. The following year, the Pirbright Institute (UK), published research regarding a new FMD VLP vaccine [20] . The neutralization antibody titer greater than 5.5 (Log 2) is considered to be protective, but the new FMD VLP vaccine could maintain neutralization with antibodies greater than 6 (Log 2), up to 22-week postvaccination [20] . These research results are significant for industrial animals. The new VLP technology makes it possible to manufacture dangerous virus vaccines that are only approved in high-level barrier facilities without infection risks. Therefore, VLP vaccine technology can be a very promising tool for disease prevention in industrial animals.",

Recent animal vaccine markets can be a good test market to evaluate the new technologies before adopting those new technologies directly to humans. In actual cases, many new vaccine technologies were used for animal vaccines. The most dramatic changes in recent animal vaccines were the usage of VLP-form vaccines for PCV2 and RNA particle vaccines that are produced from gene combinations of vectors and pathogens. As these vaccines are made from the baculovirus in insect cells and the VEE virus, respectively, they can reduce the time for development and make it possible to produce the highly pathogenic vaccine antigens, like the FMD virus, without high-level barrier facilities.",
