Fortunately, many disinfectants in common use today will fall into one of just a few general classes: quaternary ammonium compounds, phenolics, halogens, biguanides, and dialdehydes. 38 When choosing or recommending a disinfectant product, the clinician should first know its classification and the chemical properties of that class, as well as the advantages and potential disadvantages of such products. 38 \u2022 55 \u00b7 5 7 Within a particular class of compounds, there may also be some differences among products. For example, many iodine preparations have good activity against feline rhinotracheitis virus, but their activity against feline calicivirus can vary. 57 The clinician must be aware that no single product will address all problems and be completely suited to every environment. 38 \u00b7 55 \u00b7 57 The types of microorganisms that are important in a specific cattery must be known, so that a disinfectant with good activity against this (these) organism(s) can be chosen and applied. 38 \u2022 55 \u2022 57 Finally, and most important, the agent chosen must be safe around cats, and manufacturers' directions must be followed exactly.

The frequency with which these procedures, and those that are and are not actually necessary in a specific colony, are performed is largely dependent upon whether there is a history of the particular problem, the origin of the cats (that is, SPF, conventional, random source), and the stability of the population over time. A well-managed facility with a stable population may require only minimal surveillance in some areas. The clinical and management personnel in a research facility may wish to consider the eventual gain in the overall quality of health and production in a breeding colony that has been established from SPF or minimal disease stock and *Leukocell, Norden Laboratories, Inc. , Lincoln, Nebraska. In purebred catteries, the clinician should maintain an awareness that methods of breeding stock selection may exert either positive or negative influences on overall health and that changes in these methods in problem catteries may be vital to their survival. However, because substantive alterations in a breeding program can be economically (and emotionally) difficult to accomplish, the first consideration should be whether the colony surveillance and individual diagnostic procedures have been sufficiently thorough to rule out other possible causes. In addition, possible underlying problems that may be associated with management procedures must be examined.",

Carriers are difficult, expensive, and time-consuming to iden-tifY. 2 A number of other questions must therefore be considered: Are there sufficient air changes? Is some other agent being harbored in the ventilation or water system? Are air filters being changed with sufficient frequency? Is there overcrowding and too great a degree of close contact, especially within the postweiming age group (decline of maternal antibody)? Is the humidity too low or too high? Are there wide fluctuations in ambient temperature and/or humidity? Are kittens being placed in drafts or in damp areas? ls there excessive traffic, noise, or other environmental stress? Are the cats fighting? Is the drinking water clean? Are employees using adequate personal sanitation, and has instruction on potential fomite problems been provided? Are other species being housed nearby, especially those that may transmit feline viral diseases? Might undiagnosed diseases be present? Is a disinfecting agent causing subclinical irritation to oral and respiratory mucous membranes? Are cleaning chemicals being used precisely according to manufacturers' directions? ls exposure to other irritants possible? If so, from where? What is the level of dust in the building? Is the litter generating excessive dust, or has it been treated with potentially irritating chemicals? Are medications being used inappropriately (that is, indiscriminant use of antibiotics, resistant bacterial strains, steroid-induced recrudescent shedding of FVR,2)? Is nutrition adequate? Are waste materials being discarded appropriately and with sufficient frequency? The ability to consider genetics, management, nutrition, and health programs together, rather than as separate entities, is a very important part of the veterinarian's contribution to cattery health.",

For weak kittens, smaller kittens in large litters, and in situations of maternal neglect, inadequate lactation, or lactation failure, the clinician should not hesitate to initiate tube feeding with feline milk replacer* or to cross-foster kittens if this appears necessary. Cross-fostering is preferable if a lactating queen is available, because it is less labor-inte nsive .

Growing kitten fetuses , developing placental tissues, fluid, and developing mammary glands contribute to the queen' s increasing body weight and nutrient requirements in late gestation. Food consumption should increase more rapidly during this time, and some fleshiness beyond what might be seasonally appropriate is allowable. Free-choice feeding or multiple daily feedings are appropriate. As fetal size increases, less abdominal space is available for the digestive tract. The consumption of smaller meals at increasing frequency is one means of compensation. Queens carrying large litters may become uncomfortable during the last trimester, leading to reluctance to exercise, decreased food intake, and, potentially, difficulty during parturition. Selecting for breeding queens that routinely deliver very large litters may therefore be inadvisable. 41 \u2022 60 As littering nears, the queen may again lose her appetite . In many queens, food refusal during the ninth week of gestation is a good indicaticd that littering will occur within the next 24 to 48 hours. Usually within 24 hours postpartum, the queen's appetite will return and her food consumption will have increased over prepartum amounts. Food and water consumption should be encouraged so that body condition and lactation are maintained (see Table 6 ). This can be accomplished by moistening a food with high nutrient density with water before serving. The addition of water increases the palatability of the ration and increases water intake, which is important for milk production. Queens with large litters or those queens that are very attentive mothers and rarely leave the kittens to feed themselves will need more encouragement to eat and drink. On the other hand, queens with small litters may need to have food restricted. Inadequate milk production can limit kitten development, whereas excessive milk production can lead to mammary congestion and discomfort.",

Fortunately, the queen assumes responsibility for providing nutrition to her kittens throughout the 9 weeks of gestation and through most of the 6 weeks of lactation. Nutritionally, the first 36 hours may be the most significant period of a kitten's entire life. Some caution is advisable at this time with inexperienced queens. Kittens should be encouraged to nurse often. This may involve working with the queen and/or her kittens (if the queen permits), placing them near nipples at feeding time, and encouraging a nervous queen to lay quietly as her kittens nurse. Routinely handling the queen and kittens allows an opportunity to monitor the progress of the litter and aids in kitten development. 64 During the first 24 to 72 hours of lactation, the queen produces colostrum. Nutritionally, colostrum differs from milk. After approximately 24 to 72 hours, lactation gradually changes from colostrum to milk (see Table 7 ). The content of various nutrients in queens' milk changes as lactation progresses. Queens' colostrum contains about 88 per cent water; milk contains about 82 per cent. 36 The protein content of colostrum gradually increases from 4 per cent at 0 to 2 days of lactation to 6. 6 per cent in milk at weaning. 36 Similarly, the fat content gradually increases from 3.4 per cent at 0 to 2 days of lactation to 5. 5 per cent at weaning. 36 The mineral composition also varies with lactation, presumably delivering specific nutrients at the appropriate levels, at the appropriate time. 36 In the first days of life, the newborn kitten is able to absorb such whole dietary proteins as immunoglobulins, which are provided in colostrum.",

This alarms some novice cat owners, but normal eating behavior is soon learned. Canned, soft-moist, and dry rations moistened with water can all be nutritionally complete and balanced for young kittens. However, the physical form (that is, size, shape, texture, moisture) and nutrient density of the diet are important for palatability. The diet should, of course, be labeled as complete and balanced for all life stages of cats. Kitten activity will tend to compact most rations, thus decreasing their appeal. Restirring these compacted rations at frequent intervals or offering fresh food periodically in bowls that are easily accessible to kittens is advised.",

The clinician should be certain that 4-to 5-week-old kittens are in fact taking solid food . Lack of appropriate solid food consumption is often reflected in a decreased rate of weight gain for kittens after the fourth week of lactation, whe n the queen' s milk production may decline and she becomes more reluctant to nurse (Fig. 2 ). By 6 weeks of age, weaning should be complete. Some breeders feed kitten rations to both reproducing queens and kittens or continue to feed nutrient-dense reproduction rations to weaned kittens. Both feeding strategies are designed to eliminate the stress of a postweaning diet change on kittens. Again, the critical issue is that the diet fed should be nutritionally complete and balanced for the intended purpose. When a complete and balanced diet is fed to normal healthy cats of any breed, no additional supplementation in the form of vitamins, minerals, meat, or other additives is needed. A common problem is that calcium, and possibly other vitamins and minerals, are often added to the diets of pregnant and lactating queens and growing kittens. Although it is true that more minerals are needed at these times, these minerals are obtained through increased consumption of a good-quality complete and balanced diet.",
