            "text": "Our understanding of the structure and the biosynthesis of complex glycans in mammalian cells has increased greatly during the last decade (1) (2) (3) . Many general principles of biosynthesis and a large number of related structures have been described (1, 3) . Moreover, as analytical methods have improved, new structures, unusual linkages and entirely new sugars are being reported frequently (4) (5) (6) (7) . The expression of many of these glycan structures is often cell, tissue, or developmental stage specific (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) . In fact, it is generally assumed and often reported that the complex carbohydrates have great potential to encode a wealth of biological specificity at all levels of complexity and development. Yet, the current approaches have had limited success in demonstrating that these structures carry highly specific information. There are very few concrete examples which show that a specific arrangement of sugars performs a specific biological function which is of positive benefit to the organism. The most notable examples of demonstrated specificity are: the targeting of newly synthesized mammalian lysosomal enzymes to the lysosomes by the interaction of phosphorylated Nlinked oligosaccharides with the phosphomannosyl receptor (14, 15) ; and, the roles of oligosaccharins in plant development and defense (16, 17) . It would be surprising if these diverse examples of carbohydrate specificity were unique among biological systems. If others do exist, what approaches can be used to demonstrate them and to evaluate their physiological importance?",

This type of approach has been invaluable in dissecting the pathway of mare-malian N-linked oligosaccharide biosynthesis using lectin resistant tissue culture cell lines (18) (19) (20) (21) . Many of these lines lack individual sugar residues or even entire classes of oligosaccharides, and yet such mutations are not lethal, at least under laboratory conditions. This observation suggests that many of the crucial functions of glycoconjugates may occur at the multicellular level. Unfortunately, cloned mammalian tissue culture cell lines cannot develop into multicellular organisms. Therefore, it may be necessary to analyze mutants of multicellular organisms which are altered in the synthesis of the glycoconjugates. Detecting and analyzing such mutations might be difficult since they could be lethal. On the other hand, an organism, which has an optional multicellular stage might have significant advantages as a model system.",

The first advantage is that a population of genetically homogeneous cells can be induced to undergo a non-obligatory, synchronous multicellular development (22, 23) . The developing organism exhibits many properties typical of multicellular organisms: at least three types of cell-cell adhesion systems (24) , finely regulated tissue proportioning, positional information, along with temporally and spatially regulated expression of at least 200 proteins (25) . During development the majority of amoeba differentiate into cellulose encased spores that crown a tapering stalk composed of evacuolated cells. Each of the cell types is morphologically, functionally, and biochemically distinct with each type expressing a series of unique gene products not found in the other (25) . The occurrence of vegetative and developmental states permits the analysis of the glycoconjugates at either the single-or multicellular stages.",

In Dictyostelium, the N-linked oligosaccharides are composed of residues of GlcNAc, Man, and Fuc (39) . Phosphoryl dolichol-like derivatives of Man and Glc have been described and are thought to act as intermediates in the biosynthesis of the Nqinked oligosaccharides (26) (27) (28) . Protein glycosylation occurs cotranslationally by enbloc transfer of a Glc3Man9GlcNAc2 oligosaccharide from a dolichol-like lipid precursor similar to that described for many eukaryotic systems (1, 2) . However, it should be pointed out that the specific structure of the lipid-linked precursor has not been proven in Dictyostelium. The oligosaccharide is processed following its transfer to Asn residues on the proteins by the sequential removal of the three Glc residues by a set of two neutral pH, membrane associated glucosidases found in the rough endoplasmic reticulum (40) . Glucosidase I appears to cleave the terminal o~-1,2 linked residue and o~-Glucosidase II removes the 2 c~-l,3-1inked residues of Glc (40) . Further processing of the oligosaccharides by removal of Man residues is minimal in vegetative cells. There is no evidence for the presence of either sialic acids or the multi-aentennary complex-type chains found in higher organisms. Some of the Dictyostelium oligosaccharides do undergo extensive modification by the addition of phosphate, sulfate, methylesters (41) (42) (43) (44) and peripheral GlcNAc or Fuc (45) residues to selected sugar residues.",

Their expression requires new protein synthesis and prior RNA synthesis. A variety of mutant strains altered in the temporal or morphological features of development also show altered accumulation of the various enzymes (22) . In an attempt to understand the functional roles of these regulated proteins, strains which carried mutations in the structural gene of several different enzymes were analyzed to determine the effects on either vegetative growth or development. The surprising 49 result was that the great majority of the mutations in several different enzymes showed only minor effects on the kinetics or morphology of development (22, 23) . Thus, it would appear that the highly regulated enzymes do not play crucial roles in successful development under laboratory conditions. The lysosomal enzymes of Dictyostelium are glycoproteins which bind to Concanavalin A (43, 51) . They have much received attention recently since a variety of studies suggested that the oligosaccharides might be involved in developmental regulation and cell-type specific expression of the various enzymes, and on the expression of unusual antigenic determinants shared by multiple lysosomal enzymes. Furthermore, the discovery of Man-6-P in the lysosomal enzymes of Dictyostelium hinted that the intracellular targeting of the newly synthesized enzymes might also depend on carbohydrate modifications similar to those in mammalian cells (41) .",

The general conclusions which have emerged from these studies are that lysosomal enzymes contain signal sequences and are synthesized on membrane bound polysomes. The proteins are cotranslationally glycosylated with N-linked oligosaccharides, discharged into the endoplasmic reticulum where the signal sequence is cleaved and the enzymes are routed from the RER through the Golgi to the lysosome.

The enzyme catalyzes the transfer of GIcNAc-I-P from UDP-GlcNAc to the 6-position of selected Man residues on the oligosaccharide. This forms an acid-labile phosphodiester, GlcNAc-P-Man. The GlcNAc residue is rapidly cleaved by a specific a-N-acetylglucosaminidase to yield a phosphomonoester of Man-6-P (14, 54) .

The mammalian G1CNac-P-Man diester is extremely acidlabile, (0.02 M HC1, 100 \u00b0, 20 min) but strong acid hydrolysis (1 N HC1, 100 \u00b0, 4 hrs) is needed to completely hydrolyze Man-6-P-OCH 3 to Man-6-P and MeOH (65) . The pathway of biosynthesis is not known, but the -CH 3 group is derived from Sadenosylmethionine and the (phospho?)methylation appears to occur in the Golgi (65). Several mechanisms are theoretically possible: 1) a two-step reaction using an oligosaccharide specific kinase, followed by the methylation of the phosphomonoester formed in the first step; 2) a twostep reaction involving a short-lived intermediate diester such as GIcNAc-P-Man followed by the Sadenosylmethionine dependent displacement of the first diester formed or; 3) a single step transfer of P-OCH 3 from a high energy donor. There is no evidence at present which eliminates any of these possibilities.",

Also, Wood and Kaplan have presented evidence recently that the proteolytic cleavage may occur in or near the Golgi and not in the lysosome (60) . The membrane associated precursor cannot be removed from the membrane by low pH or elution with high salt, chaotrophic salts, Man-6-P or dextran sulfate. The failure of Man-6-P to solubilize the precursor suggests that it is not bound to a phosphomannosyl receptor while similar treatments solubilize lysosomal enzymes bound to the phosphomannosyl receptor in mammalian cells (67, 68) . These results obviously do not offer support in favor of the involvement of the Man-6-P in the targeting of the lysosomal enzymes in Dictyostelium. Again it must be sized that there is evidence for the presence of Man-6-P-OCH 3, not Man-6-P in the lysosomal enzymes of this organism. The important question of the mechanism of lysosomal enzyme targeting is still open. The lysosomal enzymes are secreted during vegetative growth in axenic medium and during development (69) . There are two independent secretion pathways. One involves the simultaneous release of many acid hydrolases by what appears to be the fusion of intact lysosomes with the plasma membrane. The other mechanism involves the constituitive secretion of the precursors (of o~mannosidase and 13-glucosidase) without first passing through the lysosomal compartment (58, 60). It is not known whether this second type of secretion has any functional significance or whether it simply reflects the inefficiency of the targeting system. A large number of mutant strains have been isolated which are altered in the secretion process (70) . Many of the mutants undersecrete the enzymes while some oversecrete the unprocessed precursors (71) .",

This means that base hydrolysis is dependent on the presence of other substitutions on the sugar residue. In the first case, the release of the sulfate group is accompanied by the formation of a 3,6 anhydro sugar (Fig. 2) . The ring strain labilizes the glycosidic linkage to mild-acid hydrolysis and will result in preferential cleavage of the oligosaccharide at that point (79) . Complete acid hydrolysis of the base treated oligosaccharides leads to the formation of the free 3,6 anhydrosugar. In the second case, as shown in Fig. 3 , base causes epoxide formation, and subsequent acid hydrolysis accompanied by Walden inversion results in the formation of equal amounts of the original desulfated parent sugar and an appropriate epimer of the parent sugar. For instance, when either Man-3-or -4-SO 4 is treated with base and then hydrolyzed, idose is formed. The appearance of this sugar is diagnostic of the present of one or both of these sulfate esters. Precise identification of the sulfated sugar is possible if the expoxide derivative is treated with sodium methoxide as shown in Fig. 3 .",

This is the first report of a bisecting GlcNAc at this position. All previous studies on oligosaccharides from mammalian ceils have found this type of substitution at only position A (80). At least two lysosomal enzymes are known to contain residues of GlcNAc-P-Serine (81) , which are thought to be derived from the transfer of GlcNAc-I-P from UDP-GlcNAc to the hydroxyl group of serine residues in the polypeptide chain. The linkage is labile to mild-acid hydrolysis yielding GlcNAc and phosphoserine. Base treatment gives GlcNAc-I-P and serine.

Antisera were prepared against each of several purified native or denatured enzymes, or their individual subunits excised from polyacrylamide gels. Surprisingly, each antiserum precipitated at least seven other lysosomal enzyme activities (83, 84) . While none of the proteins shared any common subunits, the antibodies might recognize a shared sequence on the proteins perhaps involved in lysosomal enzyme targeting. This, however, proved unlikely since the antigen recognition was sensitive to periodate oxidation, but not to proteolytic digestion. Careful examination of the antibody preparations by preabsorption with any of several different antigens showed that each of the antigens could remove all of the antibodies which recognized the group of enzymes. Furthermore, the antibody titration curves of all of the enzymes were identical. The conclusion was that the proteins shared a common determinant(s) and that it was likely to be a highly immunogenic carbohydrate. The released oligosaccharides were separated from those which were not cleaved. The intact resistant proteins were then treated with Endo/PNGaseF and the released oligossaccharides were isolated (Endo H---> Endo/PNGaseF). Each of the pools of the intact released oligosaccharides was then reduced to generate a single N-acetylglucosaminitol residue per oligosaccharide. This was followed by total acid hydrolysis to yield glucosaminitol (from the terminal GlcN) or glucosamine from any non-reduced, non-terminal residue. The hydrolysates were then chromatographed on paper and the radioactivity determined in 1 cm sections of each strip. The presence of radioactivity in the reduced and unreduced forms of both the Endo H and the Endo H---> Endo/PNGaseF digestions shows the presence of a large amount of GlcNAc residues beyond the chitobiosyl core. Possible locations of a bisecting GIcNAc residue. GlcNAc residues in position 'A' are known to occur in mammalian glycoproteins, while position 'B' is the location of the GlcNAc residue on the Dictyostelium oligosaccharides.",

When the sulfate esters were removed from the glycopeptides or the oligosaccharides by gentle solvolysis, none were effective competitors. Oligosaccharides with up to four sulfate esters were no better competitors than those with two. Therefore, it appeared that two residues of sulfate were required to define the shared determinant.

Based on competitive inhibition studies using various sulfated and non-sulfated monosaccharides and polysaccharides from various sources or oligosaccharide/glycopeptides from Dictyostelium, one of the antibodies recognizes a sulfated or unsulfated GlcNAc residue(s). This is called common antigen 2 or CA2. The sulfate is not an absolute requirement as it is in the case of CA1, but sulfated oligosaccharides are better competitors that nonsulfated ones. Neutral and non-sulfated anionic oligosaccharides from the lysosomal enzymes or glycopeptides from ovalbumin or ovomucoid are good competitors, too. It seems unlikely that a GlcNAc residue in the core region would be highly antigenic. Since it is clear that the oligosaccharides of secreted proteins have bisecting GlcNAc in a position different than that seen in mammalian cells, it is possible that this GlcNAc residue (see Fig. 4B , GlcNAc residue 'B') might be critical for this determinant.

At this point, no monoclonal antibodies have been isolated which specifically recognize GlcNAc-P-Serine, but it is quite possible that a minor set of antibodies in rabbit antiserum may recognize such a determinant. Recently Couso and Kornfeld have described an enzyme activity which will transfer GlcNAc from UDP-GIcNAc to endogenous acceptors (manuscript in preparaton). This activity is distinct from the one which uses o~methyl mannoside as an acceptor. Bozzarro et al., have isolated monoclonal antibodies which recognize multiple proteins via a shared determinant (88) , but they have not tested these against lysosomal enzymes. The binding of one of these preparations to its antigen appears to be preferentially inhibited by GlcNAc compared to other monosaccharide inhibitiors.

This approach has now been applied to the analysis of the biosynthesis of glycoproteins, the secretion and targeting of lysosomal enzymes and the expression of the shared determinants. In this section we will discuss some of these results. The first post-translational modification mutant isolated in Dictyostelium was in the modA locus (89) . It was initially discovered by screening mutagenized cells for a deficiency in vegetative lysosomal c~-mannosidase activity. Several other glycosidases also showed lower specific activities, and most importantly, each was less anionic than the wild-type enzyme. The mutation was mapped to linkage group I, which was different from the locations of any of the known structural genes for the effected enzymes. Subsequently, glycopeptides in many glycoproteins of the mutant strain were found to be deficient in Man-6-P and sulfate esters (42) . Since almost 30\u00b070 of the glycopeptides were altered by the mutation, it was unlikely that only lysosomal enzymes were affected. The primary defect was later shown to be the result of a deficiency in the N-linked oligosaccharide processing o~-1,3 glucosidase, Glucosidase II (40) . As a result, the glucosylated branch of the oligosaccharide chain cannot be further modified by the addition of either phosphate or sulfate residues. The other branches of the oligosaccharides appear to be normal. The mutation causes a decreased stability of the various lysosomal enzymes, but the rate of processing of either o~-mannosidase or ~glucosidase through the rough endoplasmic reticulum is normal (90) . In contrast, the inhibition of oligosaccharide processing Glucosidase I by 1-deoxynojirimycin slows the processing of several mammalian glycoproteins (91, 92).",

The oligosaccharide patterns of each of the two strains are very similar to each other in many respects. The ratio of SO4 to Man is lower compared to that in the wild-type. Both contain anionic and neutral oligosaccharides, but the number of charges per oligosaccharide is much less in the mutants than in the wild-type, suggesting that there are fewer sulfate and/or phosphate residues per oligosaccharide. Both mutants contain sulfate esters as indicated by the change in QAE-Sephadex patterns following solvolysis to remove the sulfate esters (Fig. 6) . Moreover, both mutant strains still contain Man-6-SO4. Clearly, the mere presence of SO4 does not define CA1, which is missing in these strains. To further characterize the oligosaccharides, the size of the neutral species was analyzed by amine-adsorption HPLC (Fig. 7) . The results showed that both mutant strains produced smaller species of size Mans_6GlcNAc, compared to the wild-type of Man9_10GlcNAc (6). One explanation for the smaller size of the neutral oligosaccharide from the mutants is that they are degradation artifacts produced after the proteins were secreted into the medium. Normally the phosphate and sulfate residues might 'protect' the oligosaccharide from degradation in the medium, and the failure to add the anionic groups could render them sensitive to random degradation. To eliminate this possibility, we decided to isolate the lipidlinked oligosaccharide to determine its size and characterize the structure. The precursor was isolated by standard methods (93) , and the oligosaccharide was hydrolyzed from the lipid by mild-acid, leaving both of the core GlcNAc residues on the oligosaccharide. When the size of the oligosaccha- (85) . The oligosaccharides were released by mild-acid hydrolysis, chromatographed on Concanavalin A Sepharose, eluted, and reduced. They were then analyzed on an AX-5 column together with standards described in Fig. 7 .

By comparison with standards the size was estimated to be equivalent to a MansGlcNAc2 (Fig. 8) . Thus, it was clear that a truncated precursor of the oligosaccharides was synthesized in the mutant strains; and this undoubtedly was insufficient to accomodate the number or orientation of the Man-6-SO 4 residues required to define the shared determinant, CA1.",

Further work is needed to confirm it and to determine the nature of the primary defect. However, it this structure is correct, then it would suggest that the shared determinant of CA1 requires critical Man-6-SO4 residues located on the missing branches; the mere presence of Man-6-SO4 is not sufficient to define the antigen. Furthermore, proteins from ceils carrying the modA mutation still have CA1 determinant. This is significant because this mutation affects the significant because this mutation affects the processing of the glucosylated branch and is known to prevent its phosphorylation. It is likely that it also prevents normal sulfation of this branch. Taken together these results suggest that the sulfation of the glucosylated branch is not critical for CA1 while those on the branches missing in HL-241 and HL-243 are necessary.

The phosphorylation of the oligosaccharides on the lysosomal enzymes is also reduced as shown by their lack of uptake into human fibroblasts via the phosphomannosyl receptor (47) . It is interesting that a membrane bound, neutral pH o~mannosidase is induced during this part of development (96) . This enzyme is thought to be involved in the trimming of the mannose residues to produce the smaller oligosaccharides seen during later development. A second membrane bound, neutral pH a-mannosidase also appears somewhat later (97) . This second enzyme has different substrate specificity and inhibitor sensitivities than the first one. The appearance of these two mannosidases correlate well with the appearance of lysosomal enzymes which are considerably less charged than those found in vegetative cells. It is reasonable that the increased processing of the oligosaccharides results in the less charged enzymes, but this is not proven. The isolation of strains which lack either or both of these amannosidases may be able to shed some light on their function and on the importance of trimmed oligosaccharide structures during development.",

This may indicate alternate processing of the proteins or the oligosaccharides in the different cell types. If the oligosaccharides are processed differently in the different cell types, the analysis of mutant strains altered in the modifications of the antigens, the lipid-linked oligosaccharides or the processing a-mannosidases may be invaluable in determining the importance of the precise oligosaccharide structure to proper modifications of these enzymes. Recently Free and his associates have shown that during development there is an unequal distribution of several lysosomal enzymes into two classes of vesicles which have different densities (98) . One has the density expected for lysosomes and the other co-fractionates with an organelle called the prespore vesicle which is found only in cells normally destinated to become spore cells (23) . These results suggest that developed cells have two populations of physically separable vesicles while only a single class is found in vegetative cells. It is possible that alternative targeting routes are being followed, but this is an open question at the moment. Judelson and Dimond (48) have recently shown that both c~mannosidase and /3-glucosidase synthesized after about 12 h of development lack the ability to bind to the phosphomannosyl receptor, and presumably have oligosaccharides which are partially processed. Moreover, these enzymes are not proteolytically cleaved or targeted to the lysosome; instead they are secreted to the outside of the cell. Although this is not proof of the importance of the oligosaccharide in the targeting of the lysosomal enzymes, it is consistent with the involvement of the oligosaccharide. Up to this point we have discussed only carbohydrate antigens which disappear during development, but new carbohydrate antigens also appear on multiple proteins only during development. The exploration of general nature of these other determinants has been very important in understanding the nature of cell-cell interaction and cellular cohesiveness during development (49, 50) . Figure 9 shows a schematic summary of the steps involved in the biosynthesis and processing of lysosomal enzymes and other glycoproteins. We have also shown the location of the lesions found in several mutant strains. Mutant strains HMW-437, -433 and -464 all carry defects in the structural gene for a-mannosidase 1 (71) . The amannosidase of strain HMW-437 is arrested in the RER, while those of the other two strains fail to leave the Golgi, but all are glycosylated in accord with their sub-cellular location (71) .",

Ultimately, our goal is to identify the primary defects in many of these strains. In some, the defect is already known to be in the structural gene for the lysosomal a-mannisidase (o~-Manl) as mentioned above. These mutants will be useful for the exploration of the effects of amino acid sequence on proteolysis and oligosaccharide modification. As for the other mutations that effect multiple lysosomal enzymes, they are often abberant in the packaging or secretion of these proteins from the cells. In these complex interactions, cause and effect will not be easily discernible. The continued systematic analysis of these mutants should give us a wealth of information on the structure, biosynthesis and, hopefully, the biological roles of the N-linked oligosaccharides in the growth and development of Dictyostelium. This in turn may provide clues for understanding the function of glycoconjugates in other multicellular systems.",

A mixture of three purified glycosidases was denatured and digested with Endo H or withEndo/PNGaseF (16). The digest was then chromatographed on Sephadex G-50, and samples counted for radioactivity. The material remaining in the V o after digestion was precipitated with acetone, retreated with Endo/PNGaseF and analyzed again on Sephadex G-50. The Endo H resistant material was also treated with Endo H again, but no further release occurred. The V o was determined with bovine serum albumin, and the V10 o with Man and Man9GlcNAc showed the elution position of the oligosaccharide.tion are less stable (t,~=60-84 rain), and finally those in equatorial linkage are labile (t,n=6-25 min). N-sulfate esters are extremely acid labile, being completely destroyed within an hour in 0.04 N HC1 at 100 \u00b0C (76). The half-lives of all the sulfate esters are relatively indifferent to the presence of other substitutions on the ring.",

Mild acid hydrolysis of the base-treated material preferentially cleaves the oligosaccharide at the glycosidic linkage involving the anhydrosugar. Strong acid hydrolysis cleaves all the glycosidic linkages, but does not destroy the 3,6 anhydro sugar. Other modifications of lysosomal enzymes Since a large portion of the lysosomal enzymes are secreted during vegetative growth, the secretions have been used as a convenient source of lysosomal enzymes. Analysis of the [3H]GIcN labeled oligosaccharides shows the presence of GlcNAc residues beyond the chitobiose core (Couso and Kornfeld, manuscript in preparationl Freeze, unpublished observations) (Fig. 4). Based on nuclear Identification of sulfated sugars following epoxide formation. Sulfate esters are sensitive to base when they are adjacent to a trans hydroxyl group. In this example, Man-3-SO 4 and Man-4-SO 4 both have the appropriate structures required for the sulfate to be base-sensitive. Both generate 3,4 epoxide rings within the sugar ring. Strong acid hydrolysis of either one leads to the formation of equal amounts of Man and Idose (Id). Thus, the appearance of Id is diagnostic of the presence of one or both of the sulfated sugars. Positive identification of which sugar sulfate is present can be accomplished by sodium methoxide treatment of the base-treated material followed by acid hydrolysis. Each of the original sulfated sugars will produce a characteristic set of products, as shown.",
