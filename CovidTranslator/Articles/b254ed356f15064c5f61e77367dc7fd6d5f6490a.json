That coronaviruses are potential respiratory pathogens has been demonstrated in experimental studies (1, 2) . However, data on the extent and significance of infections by these viruses in human illnesses are still limited. Serological surveillance carried out at regular intervals on a large number of sera taken from representative groups reveals the total infection rates (apparent and non-apparent) and the level and distribution of the seroimmunity in the population. The following report of seroepidemiological studies of coronavirus infections is based upon observations made in the course of a surveillance programme in Hamburg (carried out since October 1974) in various sections of the population in which all age groups were represented.",

We collected a second sample of blood two months later from 331 girls, 12 to 17 years old. After inactivation for 30 minutes at 56 \u00b0 C, the sera were stored at -20 \u00b0 C until used. All paired sera were tested simultaneously. Antigen: Coronavirus strain OC-43 has been isolated by Mclntosh et al. (3) in human embryo trachea organ culture from an adult with a cold. The strain was subsequently adapted to suckling mouse brain. Strain OC-43 antigen was prepared from infected suckling mouse brain according to the technique described by Kaye and Dowdle (4) . Serology: Hemagglutination inhibition (HI) tests were performed according to the Sever microtitre technique (5), using chicken red blood cells (4) . Fifty positive sera (titre 1:16-1:64) were treated with receptor destroying enzyme (RDE) (6), kaolin (7) or ethacridin (8) for removal of nonspecific inhibitors.",

These data also indicate an increased spread of coronaviruses in this segment of the population. The percentage of seropositive reactions in Group I (0 to 14) was smaller than that found in other groups. An explanation of this situation may be found in the data provided by Mclntosh et al. (16) : they suggested that in infants coronaviruses play a smaller role in the etiology of lower respiratory tract diseases. The lower rate of seropositive reactions could also mean that the virus is weakly antigenic in children. Since preschool children are also included in Group I, this may explain the rate of seropositive reactions. It is known that in preschool children infections with OC-38 and OC-43 coronaviruses are predominant whereas infections with strain 229E are prevalent in adults (17) .",
