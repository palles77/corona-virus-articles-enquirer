Diarrhea was also observed in 7 calves of the 248 (2.8%) born from vaccinated cows (immune calves). The latter were from 4 herds included in the 24 mentioned above. In the control calves diarrhea usually appeared within 24-72 hours from birth and was consistently associated to a marked dehydration which in 52 calves terminated with death 3 to 15 days after the onset of diarrhea. In the calves which survived, the diarrhea lasted from 10 to 15 days ; however, the calves recovered very slowly and their general condition was still very poor several weeks after recovery.",
