Abdominal distention often indicates distention of the large intestine; however, small intestinal distention also can cause visible abdominal distention if a large proportion of the small intestine is involved. One can perform abdominal palpation in neonatal foals; after several weeks of age, motility (i.e., \u03b1 2 -adrenergic agonists such as xylazine). [2] [3] [4] Absolute absence of any auscultable borborygmi suggests abnormal motility and indicates ileus resulting from a serious pathologic condition but is not specific to any segment of the intestine. 3, 5 If borborygmi are audible but progressive sounds are not detectable, determining whether a significant abnormality exists is difficult. 5 Borborygmi heard more frequently than normal may result from increased motility following feeding; from excessive stimulation from irritation, distention, or inflammation; or after administration of parasympathomimetic drugs such as neostigmine. Large intestinal motility increases in the early stages of intestinal distention regardless of the site. 6 Mild inflammation or irritation of the large intestinal mucosa also can stimulate motility. 3 Parasympathomimetic drugs stimulate contractions and auscultable borborygmi in the large intestine; however, an increase in parasympathetic tone may result in segmental contractions, which actually inhibit progressive motility. 2 One can detect sand or gravel in the large intestinal ingesta by auscultation behind the xiphoid process. One can hear sand or gravel particles grinding together during progressive contractions of the ascending colon. The presence of sand in the ingesta becomes clinically detectable by auscultation or fecal sedimentation before the amount of sand is enough to produce clinical signs of pain or irritation (diarrhea). 7 If progressive contractions are audible without hearing sand sounds, clinically important quantities of sand likely are not present. If the frequency of progressive contractions is low or absent, detecting sand by auscultation is difficult.",

Enlargement of a segment of the large intestine usually is accompanied by abnormal consistency of the contents. One may distinguish accumulation of gas, fluid, or ingesta and may detect foreign bodies in palpable segments. Accumulation of gas and fluid infers complete and acute obstruction, whereas accumulation of ingesta infers chronic and incomplete obstruction. Accumulation of fluid usually indicates ileus. One must evaluate the consistency of the contents in light of the size of the segment; ingesta in the ventral colon of a dehydrated patient may be firm, but the size of the ventral colon will be normal.

Depending on the degree of torsion, the position of the ventral and dorsal colons may not be significantly abnormal. Displacement of a segment of large intestine often results in incomplete obstruction, and the diagnosis relies solely on detection of the displaced segment in an abnormal position. The position of the displaced segment may not be palpable, and the diagnosis then relies on the inability to find the segment in a normal position. One must take care to ensure that the segment that appears to be displaced is not in a normal position but has become too small to palpate from a decrease in the volume of ingesta. The cecum, right dorsal and ventral colons, pelvic flexure, and descending colon are palpable in most horses.

            "text": "Evaluation of the hemogram is essential when one assesses conditions of the gastrointestinal tract. However, hematologic alterations associated with diseases of the gastrointestinal tract are often nonspecific, reflecting systemic response to inflammation, endotoxemia, or sepsis. Neutrophilic leukocytosis and normochromic, normocytic anemia with or without hyperfibrinogenemia commonly are associated with chronic inflammatory conditions of the intestine. Anemia from chronic blood loss occurs infrequently in adult horses because of the large iron stores and high concentrations of iron in their diet; usually anemia follows chronic inflammation, as do alterations in the leukon and plasma fibrinogen concentrations. Plasma protein concentrations vary depending on gastrointestinal losses of albumin and globulin and elevation of globulin concentration from antigenic stimulation. Protein-losing enteropathies may manifest predominantly as a hypoalbuminemia or may have a concurrent hypoglobulinemia. Immunoglobulin quantification can be useful in selected cases; immunosuppression with low immunoglobulin M concentration has been shown to occur in some cases of lymphosarcoma. 10 Parasitic infections, especially strongylosis, may be characterized by elevated serum immunoglobulin G(T) concentration. 11 Significant alterations of the hemogram do not accompany acute disease of the intestine unless severe inflammation, dehydration, endotoxemia, or sepsis is present. During the early stages of endotoxemia, elevations in circulating concentrations of inflammatory mediators, epinephrine, and cortisol produce characteristic changes in the hemogram. Leukopenia, with neutropenia and a left shift, toxic changes in the neutrophil cytoplasm, and lymphopenia occur commonly. 12 Hemoconcentration and hyperfibrinogenemia are also common. Thrombocytopenia and other coagulopathies are also features of endotoxemia. Indeed, thrombocytopenia may be the earliest indicator of sepsis. 13 Endotoxemia and circulating mediators of inflammation activate the coagulation cascade, causing a hypercoagulable state that can lead to consumption of coagulation factors and coagulation defects manifested as elevated prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, fibrin degradation products, and bleeding time, and reduced activity of antithrombin III. [14] [15] [16] Neutrophilic leukocytosis occurs during the later stages of endotoxemia. 14 The most common serum biochemical abnormalities with diseases of the large or small intestine are electrolyte imbalances. Serum calcium concentrations are often low with strangulating obstructions and acute inflammatory diseases. 17 Inflammation of the mucosa can disrupt electrolyte fluxes severely. Diarrhea or gastric reflux greatly exacerbates the loss of sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium and bicarbonate. Ischemia of the intestine causing hypoxia and cellular damage may be reflected by an elevated serum phosphate concentration resulting from phosphate leakage from damaged cells. 18 Ischemia and cellular hypoxia in any segment of the intestine also causes a shift in energy metabolism to anaerobic glycolysis, resulting in increased production of lactate and elevated serum lactate concentration. Reduced perfusion of peripheral tissues from hypotensive shock and intestinal ischemia can cause elevations in serum lactate. However, obstruction of the intestine during ischemia may result in absorption of lactate from the lumen. 19, 20 Anion gap is an indirect measurement of organic acid production during states of tissue hypoxia and is a reasonable estimate of serum lactate concentration. 20 Metabolic acidosis may accompany lactic acidemia, but an inconsistent association exists between the two, especially when mixed acid-base imbalances are present. 20, 21 Elevations of hepatic enzymes, specifically \u03b3-glutamyltransferase, may occur with large colon displacements, duodenal strictures, or anterior enteritis.",

The PF protein concentration first increases, followed by an increase in the red blood cell count and fibrinogen concentration. A transudative process resulting from vascular congestion and increased endothelial permeability allows small macromolecules (albumin) to escape into the PF, followed by larger macromolecules (globulin and fibrinogen), and finally diapedesis of cells (red blood cells, then white blood cells). 23, 24 If ischemic inflammation of the intestine and visceral peritonitis occur, an exudative process ensues. Severe inflammation of the intestine and visceral peritoneum causes large quantities of protein and white blood cells, primarily neutrophils, to escape into the PF. 24 As damage to the bowel progresses, the protein concentration and red blood cell and white blood cell counts continue to rise. As the degree of irreversible damage to the intestine increases, the PF characteristics become more exudative. 23, 24 Eventually, bacteria begin to translocate across the intestinal wall and appear in the PF as the mucosal barrier breaks down. Neutrophils predominate, and their cytoplasm becomes granulated, and D\u00f6hle bodies often are visible. If perforation occurs, bacteria and particles of ingesta appear in the PF, and the neutrophils become degenerate, that is, pyknotic, with karyorrhexis, karyolysis, and smudge cells. 23 Elevated PF protein concentration is a sensitive indicator of early inflammation, whereas elevated red blood cell counts in the presence of normal white blood cell counts suggest vascular damage without significant tissue ischemia. 24 Elevation of the white blood cell count usually indicates severe tissue inflammation or intestinal injury. 25 The gross color of the PF can be helpful in detecting injury and necrosis of the intestine. A serosanguinous appearance indicates vascular injury, whereas orange or brown-red indicates necrosis with the release of pigments such as hemosiderin. Serial samples of PF are most useful in determining the nature and extent of damage to the intestine, but in many cases of ischemia, irreversible tissue damage has occurred by the time PF abnormalities appear.",

Severe inflammatory diseases in human beings, invasive bacterial infections in particular, have been shown to increase the shedding of leukocytes in the feces. A higher percentage of horses with salmonellosis and diarrhea have fecal leukocyte counts greater than 10 cells per high power field than horses with negative fecal cultures for Salmonella. These results suggest that high fecal leukocyte counts indicate salmonellosis in horses with diarrhea. However, the specificity of this test is probably low. Low fecal leukocyte counts do not rule out salmonellosis. 31 Fecal occult blood tests detect blood in the feces, presumably from erosion or ulceration of the mucosa, but do not distinguish the source of the blood. Large volumes of blood (1 to 2 L) given by nasogastric tube were required to produce a positive test for occult blood in the feces, but the amount of blood originating from the large intestine required to produce a positive test is unknown. A positive test implies significant hemorrhage into the gastrointestinal tract. Newer, more sensitive tests detect not only occult blood but also degraded blood and may be useful to determine the site and quantity of blood loss. 32 A positive test implies significant hemorrhage into the gastrointestinal tract.",

Quantitation of clostridial species may be beneficial in diagnosing clostridial infection of the large intestine. 33 Tests to detect clostridial toxins in intestinal contents or feces are important to determine whether clostridia cultured from the feces are causing disease. The most common bacterial pathogens isolated from the feces of horses are Salmonella and Clostridium. The number of Salmonella organisms isolated from the feces of horses with clinical salmonellosis is usually higher than from horses with asymptomatic infections. However, the volume of feces in many cases of acute diarrhea is high, and the concentration of Salmonella organisms may be lower than would be expected, accounting for many false-negative fecal cultures. The sensitivity of fecal cultures for detecting Salmonella infection may be as low as 20%. Culture of five consecutive daily fecal samples is recommended to increase the sensitivity of the test. Because salmonellae are intracellular organisms, culture of rectal scrapings or a rectal biopsy sample, along with fecal material, may increase the sensitivity of culture for detecting Salmonella infection to 50%. 34 One can perform a polymerase chain reaction assay on fecal samples to detect DNA from Salmonella sp. The polymerase chain reaction test is more sensitive than culture and is frequently positive in clinically normal horses that continuously shed small amounts of bacteria. Polymerase chain reaction or immunologic tests also may detect Clostridium perfringens and C. difficile exotoxins in the feces.",

A direct smear of fecal material is a rapid method to screen feces for ova and oocysts, to detect parasite larvae and trophozoites, and to observe motility of ciliates and parasite larvae. Fecal flotation is a more sensitive technique for isolating and detecting ova and oocysts because the eggs are concentrated from the sample. Zinc sulfate and sucrose solutions are often used to concentrate less dense ova and oocysts. Zinc sulfate produces less distortion of trophozoites and larvae than sucrose solutions. Fecal sedimentation is particularly appropriate for ciliates, Giardia, and trichomonads. Quantitative techniques such as the Cornell-McMaster method allow one to estimate the number of eggs per gram of feces and are most appropriate in monitoring parasite control programs. 35 ",

One may detect foreign bodies or soft tissue masses, and in cases of esophageal rupture, one may see free air and ingesta in the tissues surrounding the esophagus and may observe pneumomediastinum. 36 Thoracic radiographs may be necessary to detect intrathoracic esophageal obstructions, megaesophagus, or cranial mediastinal masses causing extraluminal obstruction. One may use barium swallows or double-contrast esophagrams after resolution of the obstruction to determine whether a stricture or diverticulum or other underlying disorder is present. 37 Barium sulfate is the usual contrast medium and can be administered orally via a dose syringe or by nasogastric tube (50 to 100 ml of a 40% barium sulfate suspension or barium paste). Oral administration is preferred for evaluation of swallowing and lesions in the proximal esophagus. Administration of contrast using a nasogastric tube (preferably cuffed) allows for delivery of larger volumes of barium (up to 500 ml) but should be performed without sedation if possible. One can follow administration of contrast material with air insufflation to create a double-contrast effect. If one suspects a rupture of the esophagus or if the likelihood of aspiration of the contrast material is high, one should use iodinated organic compounds in an aqueous solution as contrast material. 36 Contrast radiography may be the most definitive method for the diagnosis of primary megaesophagus or other functional disorders such as autonomic dysautonomia (grass sickness) affecting the esophagus. 37 One should take care when interpreting esophageal radiographs if the horse is sedated. Acepromazine or detomidine administration causes esophageal dilation in normal horses, especially after passage of a nasogastric tube. 38 Radiography of the adult equine abdomen is an effective technique in detecting radiodense material in the large intestine, such as enteroliths, sand, and metallic objects. 39, 40 One survey demonstrated that radiography has 76.9% sensitivity and 94.4% specificity for diagnosing enterolithiasis. 39 Radiography also can be a useful tool for detecting sand accumulation in the colon that causes diarrhea or impactions ( Figure 13 .1-1) and for monitoring resolution in medically treated horses. 41 The large size and density of the adult abdomen precludes evaluation of soft tissue structures because the detail and contrast of the radiographs are usually poor. One is more likely to obtain diagnostically useful abdominal radiographs from small ponies and miniature horses than from full-size adult horses. Accumulation of gas is visible on radiographs of adult horses, but distinguishing normal intestinal gas from obstruction is often difficult. Horses should be fasted for 24 to 48 hours to reduce the amount of ingesta in the large intestine before radiography.",

Small colon, small intestine, or pneumoperitoneum also may produce a gas shadow and obscure the kidney from view. 47 Sand impactions may appear as hyperechoic bands on the ventral abdominal wall. 47 One may see ileocecal and cecocolic intussusceptions in the upper right paralumbar fossa. 53 In cases of colitis, large, fluid-filled colons may be visible with or without intramural edema. One can find the right dorsal colon consistently abaxial to the liver, within the right thirteenth to fifteenth intercostal space and may be thickened (>5 mm) in cases of right dorsal colitis.",

One must keep in mind that gastric emptying, gastrointestinal transit time, length of fasting, cellular uptake and metabolism, and endocrine function influence glucose absorption curves. Malabsorption demonstrated by the oral glucose tolerance test is sensitive but not specific. Diseases that may cause a lowered or delayed peak include infiltrative lymphosarcoma, inflammatory bowel disease (lymphocytic-plasmacytic or eosinophilic), cyathostomiasis, chronic colitis (Salmonella sp.), multisystemic eosinophilic epitheliotropic disease, food allergies, and small intestinal bacterial overgrowth. 61 D-Xylose absorption tests have some advantages over the oral glucose tolerance test because xylose is not metabolized in the small intestinal mucosa and insulin does not influence its absorption. Gastric and intestinal motility, intraluminal bacterial overgrowth, and renal function still influence xylose absorption, because the kidneys clear xylose. 61 The other main drawback to D-xylose is that it is generally available only in research settings. However, xylose measurements are available at most major universities. A normal D-xylose absorption curve should peak between 20 and 25 mg/dl at 60 to 120 minutes after dosing. 62 Decreased xylose absorption can occur in horses with inflammatory bowel disease, lymphosarcoma, multisystemic eosinophilic epitheliotropic disease, cyathostomiasis, extensive small intestinal resections, and any cause of villous atrophy. 61 Maldigestion is a common occurrence in foals with diarrhea. Bacteria (especially Clostridium sp.) and viruses (especially rotavirus or coronavirus) may invade and destroy the villous epithelial cells that manufacture lactase and other disaccharidases, resulting in an inability to digest lactose. In this case, continued ingestion of the mare's milk may cause an osmotic diarrhea, which may exacerbate the underlying enterocolitis. One can perform lactose tolerance testing to assess the degree of maldigestion. One administers D-lactose at 1 g/kg as a 20% solution via nasogastric tube and measures glucose concentrations in the blood at 0, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180, 210 , and 240 minutes.

The tracer is usually not visible 60 minutes after administration in normal horses. 58 Alternatively, if nuclear scintigraphy is not available, one can use acetaminophen absorption testing as an indirect determination of gastric emptying. 58, 65 One performs this test by administering 20 mg/kg of acetaminophen orally and measuring subsequent blood values and calculating the time to reach maximum serum concentrations and the absorption constant. In human beings, the proximal small intestine absorbs almost all of the acetaminophen. 66 The median time to reach peak plasma levels using acetaminophen absorption in horses was 47.7 minutes. 58",

Flexible or rigid endoscopes used for laparoscopic evaluation of the abdomen allow for visualization of visceral organs and potentially for collection of biopsy material from masses or organs. Full-thickness biopsies of the intestines are not routinely possible through the laparoscope and usually require flank or ventral midline laparotomy. The laparoscopic procedure can be done in the standing or recumbent horse. Advantages of this technique over a flank or ventral midline celiotomy include smaller incisions, less healing time, and less procedure time. Disadvantages include the large amount of equipment needed, skill involved, and the limitation as a diagnostic modality, rather than a treatment. 68 Clinical applications of diagnostic laparoscopy include rectal tears, percutaneous abscess drainage, assessment of adhesions, displacements, and integrity of the serosa of various bowel segments, and biopsy of abdominal masses. 67 Computed tomography scans are available at several universities across the country. They have been used frequently to evaluate dental disease and may be useful in evaluating tumors and masses of the head, larynx, pharynx, and proximal esophagus. 69 Computed tomography also has promise for evaluating abdominal disorders in foals. Most equipment can accommodate up to 400 lb. Restrictions to computed tomography as a diagnostic aid include expense, availability, expertise, and weight and size limitation. 12 permeability increases, cells are recruited rapidly into the tissue, plasma protein cascades are activated, and a myriad of soluble products are released that coordinate the response, trigger innate and adaptive immunity, and mobilize reparative elements. Although the cellular and vascular response and the secreted mediators of inflammation are important for killing pathogens and limiting invasion of injured tissues by commensal organisms, they can be damaging to host cells and proteins if not tightly regulated. Thus if the inciting stimulus is not eliminated quickly, the inflammatory response itself causes significant tissue injury. The mechanism regulating inflammation has been the focus of much research to identify therapeutic targets to modulate the damage to host tissues during many gastrointestinal diseases. Recent work has provided some of the molecular and cellular details of this complex physiology and has led to novel therapeutic strategies for treating inflammation.",

Noninfectious mucosal injury or invasion of epithelial cells by pathogenic organisms such as Salmonella activates synthesis of proinflammatory chemokines (chemoattractants) by epithelial cells and triggers a robust influx of neutrophils into the tissue within hours of the damage. 1 Of the chemoattractants produced by epithelium, interleukin-8 (IL-8) has a particularly important role in initiating inflammation by recruiting neutrophils from blood [2] [3] [4] and regulating neutrophil migration through tissue matrix adjacent to epithelium. 5, 6 Bacteriaderived formylated chemotactic peptides also act as potent chemoattractants that are fully capable of stimulating a robust inflammatory response in the intestine if the epithelial barrier permits the diffusion of the peptides across the mucosa.",

Once the inflammatory response has been initiated, TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and other proinflammatory products of neutrophils, monocytes, mast cells, and epithelial cells amplify the inflammatory response. The enteric nervous system has a key role in sensing and regulating inflammatory responses in the intestine. For example, Clostridium difficile toxin A activates a neural pathway that triggers mast cell degranulation and neutrophil influx into the tissue. 8, 9 Blockade of this neural pathway is sufficient to abolish the profound inflammatory response induced by toxin A and many of the effects of toxin A on enterocyte secretion. Other pathogens and immune-mediated hypersensitivity reactions similarly stimulate inflammation by mechanisms that involve the enteric nervous system. Thus the epithelium interacts in a highly complex manner with the intestinal milieu, the enteric nervous system, and inflammatory cells to regulate the tissue response to injury and infection.",

Macrophages are activated by bacterial products via pattern recognition receptors and begin to produce proinflammatory molecules important for recruiting and activating neutrophils and monocytes. Pattern recognition receptors recognize microbial products ranging from lipopolysaccharide to peptidoglycan and even CpG-containing bacterial DNA and signal the invasion by pathogens. Of the pattern recognition receptors, the lipopolysaccharide receptor complex is perhaps the best defined. Lipopolysaccharide activates macrophages via the CD14-Toll-like receptor complex to initiate transcription of the inflammatory cytokines TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2, which synergize with lipopolysaccharide to amplify the macrophage response. 10 Lipopolysaccharide, particularly in concert with inflammatory cytokines, stimulates macrophages to produce copious amounts of nitric oxide, which is microbicidal and vasoactive. Nitric oxide and other nitrogen radicals react with reactive oxygen intermediates (ROIs) to produce some of the most toxic molecules of the host defense system: the peroxynitrites. 11 IL-8 is produced as well to recruit neutrophils.

The major sources for these mediators include activated leukocytes, endothelial cells, epithelial cells, and fibroblasts. The primary determinant of blood flow early in inflammation is vascular caliber, which initially decreases in arterioles, but then quickly changes to vasodilation coincident with opening of new capillary beds, increasing net blood flow. The increase in blood flow is short lived, for the viscosity of the blood increases because of fluid loss and tissue edema through leaky capillaries.

Histamine, leukotrienes, platelet-activating factor, prostaglandins, bradykinin, and other mediators stimulate endothelial cell contraction, and interendothelial gaps form. 12, 13 This stage of increased vascular permeability is readily reversible. Concurrently, mediators such as the cytokines TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 induce a structural reorganization of the interendothelial junctions, resulting in frank discontinuities in the endothelial monolayer. 14 Cytokines also stimulate endothelial cells to express adhesion molecules that support adhesion of leukocytes and platelets, 15 leading to the next and perhaps most devastating event. Leukocytes (primarily neutrophils) and platelets adhere to exposed basement membranes and activated endothelial cells. Adherent neutrophils and platelets then are exposed to the mediators of inflammation present in the surrounding milieu, which activates the cells to release oxidants and proteases (particularly elastase) that injure the endothelium and have the potential to cause irreparable harm to the microvasculature. [16] [17] [18] Marginated neutrophils begin to transmigrate between endothelial cells (as described in later sections), and if their numbers SECTION 13.2 Pathophysiology of Gastrointestinal Inflammation are large enough, they disrupt the integrity of the interendothelial junctions, worsening the vascular leakage. 17 Conceptually, these stages of enhanced vascular permeability can be thought of as a mechanism to allow plasma proteins to enter the tissues and to potentiate the critical influx of leukocytes into tissues. However, if not regulated precisely, alterations in hydrostatic and oncotic forces and irreversible damage to the vascular bed may have devastating consequences. Moreover, inappropriate activation of plasma protein cascades and leukocytes by activated endothelium and exposed matrix proteins can contribute to systemic inflammation (systemic inflammatory response syndrome; see Chapter 13.7 for more information) characterized by hypotension, generalized vascular leak syndrome, and multiorgan dysfunction, which may be fatal. Phosphodiesterase inhibitors reduce endothelial permeability in ischemia-reperfusion injury and other models of inflammation-induced vascular leakage 19, 20 by increasing endothelial tight junction integrity and thus may be a viable therapeutic strategy to prevent or reduce the permeability alterations associated with inflammation.",

Neutrophils, being the first to arrive during inflammation, have a dominant role in the acute response. Within minutes, neutrophils are recruited into the tissue where they are activated to release products that not only are proinflammatory and lethal to pathogens but also may damage host cells and tissues. Not surprisingly, much attention has been paid to the role of neutrophils in the pathophysiology of many inflammatory conditions. 21 Neutrophil depletion is protective in many models of gastrointestinal inflammatory disease. Of interest to clinicians, blockade of neutrophil migration into inflamed tissues prevents many of the pathophysiologic events associated with infectious enteritis, ischemia-reperfusion injury, and other gastrointestinal diseases. 16, [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] Neutrophil transendothelial migration is a multistep process that is temporally and spatially regulated and has a degree of cell type specificity ( Figure 13.2-1) . The predominant sites of neutrophil transendothelial migration are in the postcapillary venules and, in some tissues, the capillaries. Endothelial cells in these vessels respond to cytokines and other soluble signals by expressing molecules that promote neutrophil adhesion and transmigration, including selectins and counterreceptors for integrins. As neutrophils flow through these vessels, they are first tethered to activated endothelium. Tethering is mediated by selectin molecules expressed on neutrophils (L-selectin) and on activated endothelial cells (P-and E-selectins) that bind to P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1), E-selectin ligand-1 (ESL-1), and other mucin counterreceptors. 27, 28 Tethering functions to increase the exposure of the neutrophil to activating chemokines presented on the surface of the endothelial cells.",

            "text": "Stimulation of neutrophils by IL-8 and other chemokines activates the second step of transendothelial migration. Chemokine binding to their receptors on the neutrophil generates signals that activate the binding of integrin adhesion receptors to their ligands, called intracellular adhesion molecules or vascular cell adhesion molecules expressed on endothelial cells in inflamed mucosa. Integrin ligation to cellular adhesion molecules arrests the tethered neutrophils, resulting in firm adhesion to the endothelium. Of the integrins expressed on neutrophils, the \u03b2 2 integrins have a particularly important role in transendothelial migration. Calves and human beings with a disorder known as leukocyte adhesion deficiency illustrate the requirement for \u03b2 2 integrinmediated adhesion in neutrophil function. Leukocyte adhesion deficiency results from an autosomal recessive trait causing the lack of the \u03b2 2 integrin expression. The neutrophils from these individuals cannot migrate into most tissues and do not function normally, resulting in poor tissue healing and profound susceptibility to infection, especially at epithelial barriers. 29, 30 Other integrins also have a role in transendothelial migration. \u03b2 1 Integrins mediate transendothelial migration in some cells and seem to be particularly important for mediating emigration of monocytes into many tissues. 31 Following this firm adhesion step, neutrophils migrate through the endothelium along a chemotactic gradient of IL-8 and other chemoattractants such as leukotriene B 4 . 3, 17, 32 Neutrophils migrate across the endothelial monolayer at intercellular junctions via a mechanism involving a series of integrin-ligand interactions mediated by \u03b2 2 and \u03b2 1 integrins and other adhesion molecules 28 that is generally capable of maintaining the integrity of the endothelial barrier. 33 However, massive flux of neutrophils through the endothelium alters endothelial tight junctions and injures the basement membrane, resulting in increased endothelial permeability to molecules as large as plasma proteins and even endothelial cell detachment from the basement membrane. 17, 18 Nonintegrin molecules such as platelet/endothelial cell adhesion molecules (PECAMs) also are involved in transendothelial migration of neutrophils. 28 Homotypic binding of PECAMs on adjacent endothelial cells form part of the intercellular junction. Neutrophils express an integrin of the \u03b2 3 family that can bind PECAM, and via sequential binding of \u03b2 3 integrins to PECAM, the neutrophil can , and other proinflammatory mediators. Endothelial cells stimulated by inflammatory mediators produce chemoattractants (such as IL-8) and display adhesion molecules that promote neutrophil emigration. The three steps of neutrophil (polymorphonuclear [PMN]) emigrationcapture/rolling (mediated by selectins), adhesion (mediated by \u03b2 2 integrins), and transendothelial migration (mediated by integrins and platelet/endothelial cellular adhesion molecule [PECAM])-occur on activated endothelium. Chemoattractant molecules, such as IL-8 trigger neutrophil emigration. In inflamed tissues, cytokines (IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1) and a variety of other proinflammatory mediators stimulate the neutrophil oxidase complex to produce reactive oxygen intermediates (ROIs; O 2 and H 2 O 2 and their derivatives). Activated neutrophils degranulate to release proteases and other hydrolases, cationic peptides (defensins), myeloperoxidase, and other products into the tissue. Activated neutrophils synthesize a variety of inflammatory mediators, including prostaglandins (PGE 2 ) that modulate the inflammatory response. The products of activated neutrophils (ROIs, proteases, and mediators) stimulate epithelial secretion and alter tight junction permeability, promoting diarrhea. Neutrophils eventually migrate across the infected epithelium by a mechanism that involves integrins, disrupting tight junction integrity and increasing permeability to bacterial products, thus exacerbating the inflammatory response.",

The changing composition of the matrix proteins deposited in tissues during inflammation serves as a clue as to the nature of the tissue environment for recruited inflammatory cells as they become activated. Individual gene expression studies have demonstrated that adhesion to matrix proteins induces the expression of cytokines and chemokines and their receptors, arachidonic acid-derived lipid mediator synthases, metalloproteinases, growth factors, transcription factors, and other genes that influence the differentiation and activation of inflammatory cells. 35 ROI production, phagocytosis, degranulation, and other effector functions stimulated by inflammatory mediators and bacterial products are optimal only when neutrophils adhere to the ECMs. 34 Adhesion to distinct ECM proteins selectively activates signaling pathways and gene expression of neutrophils, monocytes, and other leukocytes with differing abilities to promote certain functions such that the composition of ECMs in many ways controls the development of the ultimate effector phenotype. Thus integrin-mediated adhesion provides a mechanism by which neutrophils and other leukocytes can sense the complex tissue environment and respond appropriately.",

Activation also stimulates de novo synthesis of a range of inflammatory mediators, including prostaglandins, platelet-activating factor, and leukotrienes. Transcription of a number of peptide mediators, such as the cytokines TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 among many others, also increases on stimulation of mast cells. Mast cell products have profound effects on the vasculature, increasing endothelial permeability and causing vasodilation. 44 Moreover, mast cell-derived mediators greatly enhance epithelial secretion by a mechanism that activates neural pathways of epithelial secretion and directly stimulates epithelial cells. 43 Mast cell products significantly alter intestinal motility, generally increasing transit and expulsion of intestinal contents. Mast cell-derived leukotrienes and TNF-\u03b1 also have a crucial role in host defense against bacterial pathogens, acting to recruit and activate neutrophils. 45, 46 Mast cells have a newly identified role in host defense and inflammatory responses to bacterial pathogens, which in part is caused by the release of proinflammatory mediators during bacterial infection, which is critical for recruiting and activating other innate host defense cells such as neutrophils. However, mast cells are also phagocytic, have microbicidal properties, and can act as antigen-presenting cells to the adaptive immune system. 47 Although accumulating evidence was establishing the role of mast cells in innate immunity, a seminal study that unconditionally identified the importance of mast cells in host defense demonstrated that mast cell-deficient W/ W v mice have impaired responses to gram-negative bacterial peritonitis, resulting in a significant increase in mortality. The role for mast cells in host protective responses appears to be as a sensor of bacterial invasion. Unlike immunoglobulin E-mediated responses, bacterial products seem to elicit a highly regulated and selective response from mast cells.",

Activation of the complement cascade by immune complexes (classical pathway) or by bacteria or bacterial products, polysaccharides, viruses, fungi, or host cells (alternative pathway) results in the deposition of complement proteins on the activating surface and the release of soluble proteolytic fragments of several complement components. In particular, activation of either pathway results in the deposition of various fragments of the complement protein C3, which are potent activators of neutrophils and monocytes. 48 Opsonization of particles with C3 fragments constitutes a major mechanism of target recognition and phagocyte activation. 49 During the activation of the complement cascade culminating in deposition of C3, soluble fragments of C3 (C3a), C5 (C5a), and C4 (C4a) are liberated. These fragments, termed anaphylatoxins, have potent effects on tissues and cells during inflammation. Perhaps most notably, anaphylatoxins are chemotactic for neutrophils (particularly C5a), activate neutrophil and mast cell degranulation, and stimulate ROI release from neutrophils. 48 The termination of the complement cascade results in the formation of a membrane attack complex in membranes at the site of complement activation, and if this occurs on host cells such as endothelium, it may cause irreversible cell injury. Although the primary source of complement is plasma, epithelial cells of the gastrointestinal tract also produce C3, suggesting that local production and activation of the complement cascade during inflammation occurs in intestinal tissues.",

However, a limit exists above which neutrophil migration alters the permeability characteristics of the endothelium. The effect is in part physical in that mere movement of large numbers of neutrophils through the endothelium is sufficient to disrupt the tight junctions mechanically and is caused in part by toxic products of neutrophils that damage endothelial cells and basement membranes. 59, 62 Serine proteases (particularly elastase) and metalloproteinases released by degranulating neutrophils destroy tissue matrix proteins and cell-surface proteins that make up endothelial intercellular junctions. These degradative enzymes are particularly damaging to basement membranes and the cellular barriers of the endothelium, thus contributing to vascular permeability (and local tissue edema) and thrombosis. The permeability may be affected to the extent that not only water but macromolecules (albumin, matrix proteins, complement, etc.) leak into the interstitium. Blockade of neutrophil adhesion to endothelium with anti-\u03b2 2 integrin antibodies has a sparing effect on the microvasculature in experimental intestinal ischemiareperfusion injury, reducing the alterations in vascular permeability and histopathologic evidence of microvascular damage. 59 Similar to the endothelium of inflamed tissues, massive neutrophil transmigration occurs across the epithelium in response to infection or injury. Neutrophil transepithelial migration increases epithelial permeability by disrupting tight junctions. 62 Like the endothelium, neutrophils disrupt the epithelial barrier mechanically as they migrate through (see Figure 13 .2-1). Proteases, particularly elastase, degrade basement membrane components and tight junction proteins. Products of activated neutrophils (TNF-\u03b1 and interferon-\u03b3) increase tight junction permeability by direct effects on the enterocytes. Prostaglandins released by activated neutrophils stimulate epithelial secretion, thus contributing to diarrhea. Subepithelial accumulation of neutrophils can lead to deadhesion of the epithelial cells from the basement membrane and mild to severe ulceration. The physiologic results of the effects of neutrophils and their products on the epithelial barrier include protein-losing enteropathy and absorption of bacterial cell wall constituents, which potentiates the local and systemic inflammatory responses.",

Although these oxygen and oxyhalide radicals are important for killing pathogens, they are also potentially toxic to epithelial and endothelial cells and matrix proteins. Reactive nitrogen intermediates produced primarily by macrophages during inflammation combine with ROIs to form peroxynitrites, which are particularly toxic. 11 In addition to injury to mucosal tissues, ROIs also have an as yet ill-defined role in recruiting and activating neutrophils, thereby potentiating the inflammatory response. 63 In support of the role of ROIs in inflammatory diseases of the gastrointestinal tract, administration of inhibitors of ROI production or pharmacologic ROI scavengers can be protective in many models of reperfusion injury or enterocolitis. Many therapies are aimed at inhibiting neutrophil activation and effector functions in tissues have been evaluated for use in intestinal diseases. Phosphodiesterase inhibitors, by causing cyclic adenosine monophosphate accumulation in neutrophils, are antiinflammatory by virtue of their ability to suppress neutrophil activation and ROI production. New phosphodiesterase inhibitors selective for the predominant neutrophil isoform of phosphodiesterase hold promise for use in many inflammatory diseases.",

Disease onset is sudden with a rapid progression and often is preceded by a stressful event. A definitive diagnosis is made in only about 20% to 30% of cases. 7, 11 Most ante-and postmortem diagnostic tests remain speculative. Treatment of the condition in horses is costly because of the massive fluid therapy required. Currently, no curative treatment is available for acute colitis in horses, human beings, or other mammals. Treatment regimens provide rehydration, electrolyte and plasma protein replacement, mitigation of the effects of circulating endotoxin, and antimicrobial therapy when indicated. Attempts during the past 40 years to develop appropriate treatments (i.e., vaccines or pharmacologic agents) have been hampered by the unavailability of acceptable equine models and have been unsuccessful because of the complex pathophysiology of the intestinal epithelium.",

Abnormal forces influencing the rates of secretion and absorption can result in massive, uncontrolled secretion and malabsorption by large intestinal mucosal epithelial cells, leading to rapid dehydration and death. 26, 27 Two intracellular processes control colonic secretion: the cyclic nucleotide (cyclic adenosine monophosphate [cAMP] and cyclic guanosine monophosphate [cGMP]) and the calcium system. 28, 29 Agents may activate adenyl cyclase (vasoactive intestinal peptide, prostaglandin E 2 [PGE 2 ]) or guanyl cyclase (bacterial enterotoxins) and induce increases in cAMP or cGMP, respectively. This reaction causes phosphorylation of specific protein kinases that induce the actual apical and basolateral membrane transport events.

[35] [36] [37] Prostaglandins of the E and F series can cause an increase in chloride secretion in intact tissue and isolated colonic cells. [38] [39] [40] Leukotrienes, platelet-activating factor, and a number of cytokines have been shown to have no effect on T84 cell secretion but have a significant effect on electrolyte transport in intact tissue, suggesting that intermediate cell types may be involved in these secretory responses. [41] [42] [43] The epithelial cell chloride secretory response occurs via prostaglandin-and adenosine-mediated increases in cellular cAMP, whereas histamine acts by H 1 receptor induction of phosphatidylinositol turnover, production of inositol triphosphate, and mobilization of intracellular calcium stores. 30, 33 Lipoxygenase products (leukotrienes) are capable of activating a colonic secretory response and do not appear to involve the cyclic nucleotides or calcium ions. 41 Phagocyte-derived reactive oxygen mediators (ROMs) can induce colonic electrolyte secretion in vitro, suggesting that oxidants may contribute directly to the diarrhea associated with colitis. [44] [45] [46] [47] [48] Reactive oxygen species initiate the secretory response by increasing cellular cAMP or stimulating mesenchymal release of PGE 2 or prostacyclin, which in turn stimulates the epithelial cell or enteric neuron, respectively. [44] [45] [46] [47] [48] [49] Sodium nitroprusside, an exogenous source of nitric oxide, stimulated an increase in chloride secretion in rat colon that was mediated by cyclooxygenase products and enteric neurons. 50 Table 13 .3-1 summarizes inflammatory mediator-induced epithelial cell chloride secretion.",

Engagement of any of several receptor and nonreceptor types including phagocytosis mediators, chemotactic agents, various cytokines, and microbial products can stimulate phagocytes. 20 Resident phagocytes or those recruited to colonic mucosa early in the disease process are considered to augment mechanisms causing fluid and electrolyte secretory processes, a so-called amplification process. 70, 71 Activation of the respiratory burst results in the production and release of large amounts of superoxide anion (O 2 \u2212 ) and H 2 O 2 . 69, 72 In addition to these ROMs, activated phagocytes secrete peroxidase enzyme (myeloperoxidase from neutrophils and eosinophil peroxidase from eosinophils) into the extracellular space. The peroxidases catalyze the oxidation of Clby H 2 O 2 to yield HOCl, the active ingredient in household bleach products. The peroxidase-H 2 O 2 -halide system is the most cytotoxic system of the phagocytes; HOCl is 100 to 1000 times more toxic than O 2 or H 2 O 2 . 69 HOCl is a nonspecific oxidizing and chlorinating agent that reacts rapidly with a variety of biologic compounds including DNA, sulfhydryls, nucleotides, amino acids, and other nitrogen-containing compounds. HOCl reacts rapidly with primary amines (RNH 2 ) to produce the cytotoxic N-chloramines (RNHCl). The mechanisms by which HOCl and RNHCl damage cells and tissue remain speculative, but possibilities include direct sulfhydryl oxidation, hemoprotein inactivation, protein and amino acid degradation, and inactivation of metabolic cofactors of DNA. 73 Peroxidase-derived oxidants have been shown to degrade hyaluronic acid and collagen. 74 In addition, luminal perfusion of specific ROMs increased mucosal permeability and serosal application caused increases in Clsecretion in vitro. 75 Tissue myeloperoxidase activity, an index of tissue granulocyte infiltration, is used clinically and experimentally to assess degree of intestinal inflammation. 76, 77 Myeloperoxidase activity is elevated in acute flare-ups of human inflammatory bowel disease and various animal models of acute colitis. [76] [77] [78] [79] [80] The acute inflammatory response in these conditions is characterized predominantly by neutrophils, the predominant source of myeloperoxidase activity. However, this assay measures total hemoprotein peroxidase, which includes monocyte and eosinophil peroxidase in addition to neutrophils. 77 Moreover, levels of peroxidase activity in equine circulating eosinophils are greater than in circulating neutrophils, 81 and this may apply to resident tissue eosinophils as well.",

Endotoxins have been shown to be potent activators of the inflammatory process, stimulating the production and release of numerous cytokines by activated macrophages and other immunocytes. 87 In vitro studies suggest that endotoxin activates phagocytic granulocytes to secrete ROMs, increase release of lysozymes, and enhance the migratory response to chemotactic stimuli. 88 Prostacyclin and thromboxane A 2 mediate hemodynamic dysfunction, and lipoxygenase products may induce tissue ischemia. 89 The cytokine interleukin-1 causes a febrile response and initiates the acute phase response. 90 Tumor necrosis factor contributes to many of the abnormal physiologic responses, particularly hemostatic functions that potentiate coagulopathy. 91 Additional mediators include interleukin-6, platelet-activating factor, procoagulant mediators, and various other speculated substances. 84 Endotoxins trigger mucosal immune cells and subsequent release of inflammatory mediators in cases of colitis. The first report of experimentally induced endotoxemia described clinical signs and hematologic findings that closely paralleled those reported for severe colitis in horses. 92 Studies in which endotoxin was administered intravenously in human beings and laboratory animals caused significant dose-related gastrointestinal changes, ranging from mild diarrhea to bloody, watery diarrhea. 93, 94 In vitro studies on the effects of endotoxin on intestinal water and electrolyte transport in adult male rats showed a significant decrease in net colonic sodium absorption and increased colonic permeability. 55 In animal models of protein energy deficiency, endotoxin-induced mortality increased compared with that of well-nourished control animals. Endotoxin depresses lymphocyte responses to specific mitogens. 95 Thus the adverse effects of malnutrition and endotoxin are mutually aggravating.",

However, combined IgA and IgM deficiencies with a higher incidence of intestinal disease occur. A selective deficiency of secretory IgA has been associated with intestinal candidiasis.

Although the effect of endotoxin and prostaglandins on transit time is not profound, the disruption of coordinated activity may play a role in causing diarrhea. 108 Thorough mixing and prolonged retention time of ingesta are important not only in microbial digestion of nutrients but also in absorption of microbial byproducts and fluid. 32, 109 The ingesta is viscous and therefore must be mixed to bring luminal ingesta in contact with the mucosa for absorption. 109 In addition, poor mixing increases the thickness of the unstirred layer, decreasing contact of ingesta with the mucosa and decreasing absorption. 32, 109 Progressive motility must be present, however, if a diarrheal state is to occur. 32, 109 Ileus may be accompanied by increased fluid in the lumen of the large intestine, ",

Primary small intestinal disease is more likely to occur in neonates and young foals. For example, acquired small intestinal brush border lactase deficiency may result in increased lactose fermentation in the large intestine and induction of osmotic diarrhea. 1 Box 13.4-1 lists conditions that have been or potentially could be associated with malabsorption syndromes and maldigestion in the horse. Malabsorption in horses has no pathognomonic clinical syndrome. Case recognition derives from the robust investigation of horses with chronic wasting. Prevalence is unknown. No strict case definition exists, even for chronic wasting. Interest generated by unusual clinical test results and their related pathologic findings has stimulated publication of reports of cases considered as malabsorption in horses. Pathologic description of the predominant cellular infiltrate and the pattern of intestinal distribution have resulted in the classification of many conditions as representing examples of chronic inflammatory bowel disease (CIBD) (see Box 13.4-1), drawing analogies from human medicine. In the affected animal, coexistent enteric protein loss reflecting changes in mucosal integrity from extensive infiltration and inflammation in the intestinal tract is likely to be more debilitating than the malabsorption.",

A proposed classification system was based on a retrospective study of 130 rectal biopsies from 116 horses ages 1 to 18 years with clinical signs of intestinal disease. Necropsy results were studied from 40 horses. Biopsy specimens (21 horses) and necropsy rectal tissue (9 horses) from 30 horses ages 4 to 22 years served as controls. Simple proctitis, the presence of neutrophils in the crypt or surface epithelium, was an abnormal finding compared with mild scattered neutrophil infiltration in controls. Simple proctitis was found in association with malignant lymphoma and other inflammatory disorders. Inflammatory bowel disease was diagnosed from rectal biopsy specimens in 6 of 12 EG (MEED) cases and 4 of 9 granulomatous enteritis cases confirmed at necropsy. 2 Rectal biopsy aided diagnosis for 3 of 7 horses in a series of lymphocytic-plasmacytic enterocolitis cases. 3 Eosinophils were demonstrated on impression smears of rectal mucosal biopsies from 1 of 2 horses with eosinophilic enterocolitis. 4 Skin biopsies or ultrasound-guided biopsies of liver, lymph node, or lung may reveal evidence of multisystemic disease. One can obtain intestinal and lymph node biopsies via a standing laparotomy. Exploratory laparotomy facilitates rigorous inspection of the gastrointestinal tract and associated organs to obtain multiple biopsies from intestinal sites and lymph nodes. The procedure may provide a diagnosis, enabling one to make decisions on potential treatment and management options. Cost and potential postoperative complications may limit surgical procedures for diagnosis. Laparoscopy may provide an alternative means to facilitate biopsy of certain tissues.

            "text": "To gain an appreciation of the mechanisms whereby the mucosa is injured and subsequently repaired, one must understand how the integrity of the mucosa is regulated physiologically. Regulation of mucosal integrity is referred to as mucosal barrier function, which is vital because it prevents bacteria and associated toxins from gaining access to subepithelial tissues and the circulation. However, the mucosa has two conflicting functions: it must serve as a protective barrier and continue to absorb solutes necessary to maintain well-being of the host. This conflict is most notable at the intercellular (paracellular) space, which allows passage of select solutes and water, 1-4 but which does not admit large molecules, including bacterial toxins. 5 The paracellular space is regulated almost exclusively by the tight junction, 6 which is the interepithelial junction at the apical-most aspect of the paracellular space. Although these tight junctions originally were viewed as inert cellular adhesion sites, what has become clear in recent years is that tight junction permeability depends on tissue-specific molecular structure and is regulated by a complex array of intracellular proteins and the cytoskeleton. Tight junctions consist of a group of transmembrane proteins that interdigitate from adjacent cells. Although occludin originally was thought to be the predominant tight junction transmembrane protein, a group of proteins termed claudins appear to be more critical. 7 These transmembrane proteins interact with the cytoskeleton via a series of intracellular proteins, including zonula occludens 1, 2, and 3; cingulin; and others. 8 In addition, local regulatory proteins such as the small guanosine triphosphatase-Rho are also critical to tight junction function. In general the relative contractile state of the actin cytoskeleton determines the degree to which tight junctions are open or closed, but the complexities of regulation of this process are understood poorly. 9, 10 The most sensitive measure of mucosal barrier function is transepithelial electric resistance, which is measured by mounting mucosa in an ex vivo system called an Ussing chamber, because this measurement is largely a reflection of the permeability of mucosa to ions. 11, 12 Ions may follow one of two routes when traversing epithelium: transcellular and paracellular. 5 Because cell membranes have a resistance to passive flow of ions 1.5 to 3 log units greater than that of the epithelium as a whole, measurements of transepithelial resistance largely reflect the resistance of the paracellular space, and in particular the tight junctions that regulate paracellular flow of ions. 12 Because tight junctions differ in structure from different portions of the mucosa, 13 measurements of transepithelial resistance reflect the net resistance of epithelium of variable permeability within a given tissue. For example, tight junctions in the intestinal glandular structures called crypts are leakier than those in the surface epithelium because of fewer and less organized tight junction strands. 11, 14 Conversely, surface epithelium has a greater number of well-organized tight junction strands that result in epithelium with a high resistance. 11 This correlates well with the absorptive function of epithelium located on the mucosal surface and the secretory function of crypt epithelium. Structure of tight junctions also varies with the segment of intestine. For example, tight junctions have more strands in the ileum than in the jejunum, which is reflected by a higher transepithelial resistance in the ileum. 15 ",

This epithelium has baseline transepithelial resistance measurements of approximately 2000 to 3000 \u2126/cm 2 , which is an order of magnitude higher than the adjacent cardiac mucosa. 17, 18 Thus the stratified squamous mucosa is exceptionally impermeable. This in effect is the only mechanism this mucosa has to defend itself against injury. The stratified squamous epithelium consists of four layers: the outer stratum corneum, stratum transitionale, stratum spinosum, and the basal stratum germinativum. However, not all layers contribute equally to barrier function, the barrier being composed mostly of interepithelial tight junctions in the stratum corneum and mucosubstances secreted by the stratum spinosum. 17, 19 The relative impermeability of stratified squamous mucosa can be demonstrated by the effects of HCl on this type of epithelium in vitro, which has little effect until it reaches a pH of 2.5 or lower. 18 Thus although most of the literature on equine ulceration pertains to the effects of HCl and inhibitors of HCl secretion, [20] [21] [22] [23] other factors may be critical to the development of gastric ulcer disease.",

The gastric mucosa secretes mucus and bicarbonate, which together form a HCO 3 --containing gel that titrates acid before it reaches the lumen. 24, 25 The mucus layer is formed principally by glycoproteins (mucins) secreted by goblet cells but also includes other gastric secretions and sloughed epithelial cells. Mucins consist of core peptides with a series of densely packed O-linked polysaccharide side chains that, once secreted, become hydrated and form a viscoelastic gel. However, the mucus layer does not form an absolute barrier to back-diffusion of acid. Thus for acid that does back-diffuse into the gastric mucosa, epithelial Na + /H + exchangers are capable of expelling H + once the cell reaches a critical pH. 25 Recent studies have renewed interest in the protective mechanisms of mucus because of the discovery of a group of compounds secreted by goblet cells called trefoil peptides. The name of these peptides is derived from a highly conserved cloverleaf structural motif, which confers substantial resistance to degradation by proteases including pepsin. Three members of this group are known, pS2, SP, and intestinal trefoil factor, the latter of which is secreted solely by goblet cells in the small and large intestine. pS2 and SP are secreted by goblet cells within the stomach and are believed to intercalate with mucus glycoproteins, possibly contributing to the barrier properties of mucus. 26 These peptides also play a critical role in repair of injured mucosa.",

            "text": "An additional mucosal function that serves to reduce the level of injury is adaptive cytoprotection, wherein application of topical irritants to gastric mucosa results in subsequent protection of mucosa in response to repeated exposure to damaging agents. For example, pretreatment with 10% ethanol protected against mucosal damage in response to subsequent application of absolute ethanol, and this effect was abolished by treatment with the cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin. 27 The cytoprotective effect of prostaglandins has been demonstrated directly in studies in which preadministration of prostaglandins protected gastric mucosa from damage by agents such as concentrated HCl and hypertonic saline. 28 Prostaglandins appear to be cytoprotective in the stomach at doses less than those used to inhibit gastric acid secretion, ruling out a simple antacid mechanism. 29 Although not fully characterized, cytoprotection has been attributed in part to prostaglandin-stimulated mucus production. 30 An associated beneficial effect of prostaglandins is the increased production of bicarbonate, which is trapped within mucus on the surface of the mucosa. 31, 32 Interestingly, prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2 ) appears to lose its cytoprotective activity in the presence of the mucolytic agent N-acetylcysteine. Attention also has been directed at enhanced mucosal blood flow as a potential mechanism for prostaglandin-mediated cytoprotection. For example, pretreatment with PGI 2 protected against ethanol-induced mucosal damage as a result of increased mucosal blood flow. 33 Although PGE 2 , which is also cytoprotective, does not increase blood flow, 34 it may prevent vascular stasis associated with irritant-induced vascular damage resulting from inhibition of neutrophil adherence to damaged endothelium. 35 Sensory nerves also have been implicated in cytoprotective mechanisms. These nerves are distributed throughout gastrointestinal mucosa. As an example of their importance in mucosal cytoprotection, pretreatment of newborn rats with capsaicin (to which sensory nerves are sensitive) renders the mature rats more susceptible to gastric injury. 36 Alternatively, use of a low dose of capsaicin, which stimulates rather than destroys sensory nerves, protects gastric mucosa against injurious agents. 37,38 Sensory nerves contain neuropeptides such as calcitonin-gene-related peptide (CGRP) and substance P, which may play a protective role via vascular mechanisms. For instance, CGRP stimulates increased gastric blood flow, which is theorized to reduce injury in much the same way as prostaglandins do. In fact, recent studies suggest that the roles of prostaglandins and CGRP in gastric cytoprotection are intertwined intimately. In particular, PGI 2 is believed to sensitize sensory nerves following treatment with a mild irritant, with resultant increases in CGRP release and mucosal flow. Similar studies have shown that antagonists of CGRP inhibit the cytoprotective action of PGE 2 . 39 Another neural mediator, nitric oxide, also has been implicated in adaptive cytoprotection. Interestingly, nitric oxide has a number of actions that are similar to those of prostaglandins, including maintenance of mucosal blood flow. 40",

One other mechanism that helps the stomach and the intestine to maintain mucosal barrier function is the speed with which the mucosa repairs. Thus for a defect to develop in the mucosal barrier, injurious factors have to outpace mucosal recovery. Such recovery initially involves epithelial migration across denuded regions of basement membrane (restitution), 26 a process so rapid that epithelial defects may be resurfaced within minutes. For example, in bile salt-injured colon, denuded surface mucosa was covered completely by restitution. 41 In the small intestine, villi greatly amplify the surface area of the mucosal luminal surface, which in turn takes far longer to resurface with restituting epithelium once it has become denuded. 42 However, intestinal villi are able to reduce the denuded surface area considerably by extensively contracting. 43 These mechanisms are described in detail under Mechanisms of Gastrointestinal Mucosal Repair.",

Bile salts also may be present in the proximal stomach because of reflux from the duodenum. Although such reflux has a high pH, bile salts appear to adhere to stratified squamous epithelium, becoming lipid soluble and triggering damage once the pH falls below 4. 45 Diet and management (e.g., periods of fasting) also play crucial roles in the development of conditions conducive to gastric ulceration. Typically, a pH gradation in horses exists from proximal to distal compartments of the stomach, with the lowest pH values in the distal stomach. 46 However, fasting disrupts this stratification such that low pH values may be recorded in the proximal stomach. 47 Fasting conditions also increase the concentration of duodenal contents within the proximal stomach, particularly bile. 45 ",

            "text": "Proper gastric mucosa is exposed to injurious agents, including pepsin, bile, and acid. Parietal cells in the horse secrete acid constantly as an adaptation to near-continuous intake of roughage, 16 but the enterochromaffin-like cells within the proper gastric mucosa and G and D cells within the pyloric mucosa tightly regulate acid secretion. Histamine released by enterochromaffin-like cells amplifies acid secretion and interacts with H 2 receptors on parietal cells and G cells, which release the prosecretory hormone gastrin. A combination of histamine and gastrin can have a synergistic effect on parietal cell gastric secretion, because these mediators have distinct receptors and second messengers. However, D cells are sensitive to an acidic environment and release somatostatin, which inhibits acid secretion. 48 Nonetheless, gastric mucosa may be exposed to acid for prolonged periods of time, particularly in horses that are extensively meal fed and that do not have the benefit of roughage, which tends to buffer stomach contents. 45, 48 Aside from peptic ulceration induced by combinations of acid and pepsin, research in human medicine has revealed the tremendous importance of Helicobacter pylori in inducing ulceration. Infection with this organism has the effect of raising gastric pH because of disruption of gastric glands and also induces an inflammatory reaction that causes damage. 49 However, little evidence to date indicates that this organism is involved in gastric ulcers in horses. In the absence of a known role for infectious agents in gastric ulceration in animals, ulceration likely develops from injurious factors similar to those found in the proximal stomach, including gastric acid and bile. However, some factors that are important to induction of squamous epithelial ulceration may not be important in development of proper gastric mucosal ulceration. For example, feed deprivation and intensive training reproducibly induce squamous epithelial ulceration in horses but have little effect on proper gastric mucosa in horses. 50 Gastric acid likely plays a key role, whereas other factors such as nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) serve to reduce gastric defense mechanisms. In particular, inhibition of prostaglandin production reduces mucus and bicarbonate secretion while also reducing gastric mucosal blood flow. 51 Some of the NSAIDs also have a topical irritant effect, although this appears to be of minor significance because the route of administration (oral or parenteral) seems to have little influence on development of ulceration. 52 The source of prostaglandins responsible for gastric protection originally was assumed to be cyclooxygenase 1 (COX-1), because this isoform is expressed constitutively in gastric mucosa, whereas COX-2 is not expressed in the stomach unless induced by inflammatory mediators. However, mice in which the COX-1 gene has been knocked out fail to develop spontaneous gastric lesions, 53 possibly because of compensatory increases in prostaglandin production by COX-2. 54 This concept agrees with recent data indicating that inhibition of both COX isoforms is required to induce gastric ulceration. 55 From a clinical perspective this data indicate that drugs selective for COX-1 or COX-2 may be less ulcerogenic in the horse. Because COX-2 elaborates prostaglandins induced by inflammatory stimuli, selective inhibitors of COX-2 may be particularly useful because of their ability to serve as antiinflammatory agents that are less ulcerogenic. 56",

Initially, that a reduction in gastrointestinal blood supply leads to mucosal injury seems intuitive. However, the anatomy of the gastrointestinal tract and the differing structure of the intestinal mucosa at various anatomic locations have a significant influence on the extent of mucosal injury. Furthermore, ischemic injury may be induced by several different mechanisms, including occlusion of arterial supply by a thrombus, strangulation of intestinal vasculature, and generalized reduction in blood flow associated with various shock states. In addition, a number of seemingly distinct mechanisms of intestinal injury, such as intestinal distention, also trigger mucosal injury via an ischemic mechanism. Finally, reperfusion injury also may influence the extent of mucosal injury following an ischemic episode and has been proposed as a potential site of therapeutic intervention. 57, 58 Thus understanding the mechanisms of ischemia-reperfusion injury is critical to developing an understanding of the severity of various clinical conditions and beginning to formulate a therapeutic approach to diseases characterized by this devastating form of injury.",

            "text": "The intestinal circulation is capable of closely regulating blood flow during periods of low systemic perfusion pressure. 59, 60 In particular, local regulation of resistance vessels within the microvasculature is particularly prominent, whereby metabolic end products of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) result in continued dilation of resistance vessels despite reductions in systemic arterial pressure. Dilation results in continued perfusion of gastrointestinal tissues during the early stages of shock, while other organs such as skeletal muscle undergo massive shunting of blood resulting from increased constriction of resistance vessels. The reasons for these differences in regulation are not entirely clear but may relate to the high level of energy required to fuel the intestinal mucosa and the serious systemic effects of breaches in the mucosal barrier. However, as blood flow falls below a critical level, regulatory systems are no longer effective and oxygen uptake by the gastrointestinal tissue decreases, culminating in tissue damage. 59 The tip of the villus is the most susceptible region affected by hypoxia in the equine small intestine, largely because of the countercurrent exchange mechanism of blood flow in the small intestinal villus. 59 This countercurrent exchange mechanism is attributable to the vascular architecture, which consists of a central arteriole that courses up the core of the villus, arborizes at the tip, and is drained by venules coursing down the periphery of the villus. 61 As oxygenated blood flows into the central arteriole, oxygen tends to diffuse across to the adjacent venules, which flow in the opposite direction. This series of events takes place along the length of the villus, resulting in a tip of the villus that is hypoxic even under normal conditions. Furthermore, reduced blood flow as occurs in shock exacerbates the countercurrent exchange of oxygen, and the tip becomes absolutely hypoxic. 59 This mechanism might explain why the small intestinal mucosa is more susceptible to ischemic injury, compared with the colon, which has no villi. For example, the duration required to produce severe morphologic damage to the equine colon is approximately 25% longer than in the small intestine. 62",

The first biochemical event to occur during hypoxia is a loss of oxidative phosphorylation. The resulting diminished ATP concentration causes failure of the energy-dependent Na + /K + -ATPase resulting in accumulation of sodium, and subsequently intracellular water. The pH of the cytosol drops as lactic acid and inorganic phosphates accumulate from anaerobic glycolysis. The falling pH damages cell membranes, including lysosomal membranes, resulting in the release and activation of lysosomal enzymes into the cytosol, further damaging cellular membranes. Damage to the cell membrane allows the accumulation of high concentrations of calcium in the cytosol, which activates calciumdependent degradative enzymes. 63 These events result in cytoplasmic blebbing of the basal membrane with subsequent detachment of cells from the underlying basement membrane.",

            "text": "Recent studies on epithelial injury during ischemia suggest that most epithelial cells undergo programmed cell death (apoptosis) during ischemia and reperfusion rather than necrosis, allowing retention of reusable components of irreversibly injured cells. 64 In one study, 80% of detached epithelium during small intestinal ischemia and reperfusion underwent apoptosis. 65 Although the most obvious result of apoptosis is loss of surface epithelium, a number of cells on the lower portion of the villus (in the small intestine) and cells within the crypts also may undergo apoptosis that only may become evident up to 24 hours following reperfusion of ischemic tissue. 66 Morphologic changes observed in ischemic-injured small intestinal mucosa follow a similar sequence regardless of whether ischemia alone or ischemia and reperfusion induce injury (Table 13 .5-1). 67 Initially, epithelium separates from the underlying basement membrane, forming a fluid-filled space termed Gr\u00fcenhagen's space ( Figure 13 .5-1). The mechanism of fluid accumulation in this space is not understood entirely but may result from continued epithelial absorption of NaCl and water before it has detached fully from neighboring epithelial cells. This fluid accumulation likely exacerbates epithelial separation from the basement membrane. Subsequently, epithelium progressively sloughs from the tip of the villus toward the crypts, which are the last component of the intestinal mucosa to become injured. [68] [69] [70] Injury of crypts likely relates to the vascular architecture, because crypts receive a blood supply separate from the vasculature involved in the villous countercurrent exchange mechanism. The early morphologic changes observed in the equine large colon during ischemia are different from those described in the equine small intestine because of the lack of intestinal villi. However, as might be expected, the more superficially located surface cells are sloughed before those in crypts. 62, 71 The orderly progression of tissue injury has been used by one group of investigators to predict accurately the survival of horses with large colon volvulus. The researchers took biopsies from the pelvic flexure, which has been shown previously to reflect mucosal changes along the length of the colon accurately, 72 and examined them histologically for the width of the crypts and intercrypt interstitial space. They expressed the latter measurements as a ratio of interstitium to crypt width (I:C) and defined nonviable colon as that which has greater than 60% loss of crypt and an I:C ratio greater than 3. Using this methodology, researchers correctly predicted survival in 94% of horses. 73 ",

            "text": "Because of the dramatic decline in Strongylus vulgarisinduced colic, which was associated frequently with infarction of intestinal arterial blood supply, 74 most ischemic lesions are associated with strangulating obstruction. Therefore considering mechanisms of ischemic injury in horses with naturally occurring strangulating lesions is important. The majority of experimental work has assessed complete ischemia (complete occlusion of the arterial blood supply) 62 or low-flow ischemia (during which arterial blood flow is reduced). 75, 76 However, during intestinal strangulation, a disparity between the degree of occlusion of the veins and arteries occurs whereby veins are occluded before arteries because of differences in compliance of vascular walls. Thus strangulating lesions are typically hemorrhagic (hemorrhagic strangulating obstruction) as the arteries continue to supply blood to tissues that have little or no venous drainage. The result is ischemic injury, as previously outlined, but also a tremendous congestion of the tissues. Such hemorrhagic congestion has two opposing effects: it disrupts tissue architecture, including the mucosa and its epithelium, and continues to provide oxygenated blood to the tissues during much of the ischemic episode. In contrast, when strangulation results in sudden cessation of arterial blood flow (ischemic strangulating obstruction), tissues appear pale, and the mucosa rapidly degenerates because of a complete lack of oxygenated blood. 70 because intestine that may look nonviable (dark red) may in fact have less mucosal injury than that of ischemic strangulated intestine. 77 An additional consideration in clinical strangulating obstruction is the degree of ischemia that intestinal distention may induce. For example, experimental distention (18 cm of H 2 O for 2 hours) and decompression (2 hours) of jejunum resulted in a significant increase in microvascular permeability and a significant decrease in tissue oxygenation similar to that which would be expected with low-flow ischemia. 78, 79 In particular, microscopic evaluation of vasculature revealed capillary endothelial cell damage and local edema formation. 80 This data suggest that distended intestine proximal to an obstruction may undergo mucosal injury despite its normal appearance. Indeed, in one study, intraluminal pressures greater than 15 cm H 2 O in naturally occurring cases of colic correlated with a poor prognosis for survival. 81 ",

During reperfusion, xanthine oxidase rapidly degrades hypoxanthine in the presence of oxygen, producing the superoxide radical as a by-product. 57 The superoxide radical contributes to oxidative tissue damage and, most importantly, activates neutrophil chemoattractants. 84, 85 Thus inhibition of xanthine oxidase in feline studies of intestinal ischemiareperfusion injury prevents infiltration of neutrophils and subsequent mucosal injury. 83, 84 However, inhibition of xanthine oxidase has had no effect on ischemiareperfusion injury in equine small intestine 87 and colon, 95 suggesting that reperfusion injury is simply a continuation of injury initiated during ischemia, as suggested in some equine studies, 63 or that the classic reperfusion injury pathway is activated by alternate sources of reactive oxygen metabolites. The latter has been suggested by studies in feline models of ischemia-reperfusion injury in which the source of a significant proportion of reactive oxygen metabolites is unknown and is independent of xanthine oxidase and neutrophils. 83 A veterinary review of the pathogenesis of intestinal reperfusion injury in the horse suggested the concept of a therapeutic window wherein treatment of reperfusion injury would be beneficial. 57 The basis of this concept is that certain conditions exist under which ischemic injury is minimal and that tissues are damaged severely during reperfusion. 88 Thus under conditions of low-flow ischemia, little injury is demonstrated during 3 hours of ischemia, but remarkable injury occurs during 1 hour of reperfusion. [83] [84] [85] However, a therapeutic window may not exist under conditions of strangulating obstruction in which severe injury occurs during ischemia and minimal injury occurs during reperfusion. 96 This in turn greatly reduces clinicians' ability to ameliorate ischemiareperfusion injury with treatments such as antioxidants at the time of reperfusion.",

            "text": "Mechanisms of gastric repair depend greatly on the extent of injury. For instance, superficial erosions can be covered rapidly by migration of epithelium adjacent to the wound; a process termed epithelial restitution. However, ulceration (full-thickness disruption of mucosa and penetration of the muscularis mucosa) requires repair of submucosal vasculature and extracellular matrix. The formation of granulation tissue initiates repair and supplies connective tissue elements and microvasculature necessary for mucosal reconstruction. Connective tissue elements include proliferating fibroblasts that accompany newly produced capillaries that form from proliferating endothelium. Recent studies indicate that nitric oxide is critical to both processes, 40, 97 which likely explains the reparative properties of nitric oxide in the stomach. 98 Once an adequate granulation bed has formed, newly proliferated epithelium at the edge of the wound begins to migrate across the wound. In addition, gastric glands at the base of the ulcer begin to bud and migrate across the granulation bed in a tubular fashion. 99 Repairing epithelium expresses epidermal growth factor, which appears to facilitate these processes. 100 In addition, a mucoid cap facilitates these events and retains reparative factors and serum adjacent to the wound bed. 51 Once the ulcer crater has been filled with granulation tissue and the wound has been reepithelialized, the subepithelial tissue remodels by altering the type and amount of collagen. Despite the remodeling process, ulcers tend to recur at sites of previous ulceration, and the concern is that this remodeling can result in excessive deposition of collagen and fibrosis. 26",

            "text": "Reparative mechanisms are similar in the intestine, except that in the small intestine, mucosal villi contribute to mucosal repair. Once intestinal epithelium is disrupted, two events occur almost immediately to reduce the size of the denuded portion of the villus: contraction of the villus and epithelial restitution ( Figure 13 .5-3). For example, in porcine ileum subjected to 2 hours of ischemia, villi were 60% of their former height and 50% of the denuded villous surface area was covered in flattened epithelium within 6 hours. 42 Enteric nerves appear to regulate villous contraction, because inhibition of enteric nerve conduction prevents villous shortening following injury. The contractile component of the villus is a network of myofibroblasts distributed throughout the lamina propria of the villus and along the central lacteal. Inhibition of villous contraction results in retarded epithelial repair because of the larger denuded surface that remains to be covered by migrating epithelium compared with similarly injured villi that have contracted. 43 PGE 2 also has been implicated in regulating villous contraction, because application of PGE 2 resulted in villous contraction when perfused through normal rat ileum. 101 As villi contract, assuming the basement membrane is intact, epithelium from the margins of the wound migrates centripetally to resurface toward the tip of the villus. 43 The process of restitution is similar in denuded colonic mucosa, except that it may proceed more rapidly because of the lack of villi. 41 Epithelial restitution is solely a migratory event that does not depend on provision of new enterocytes by proliferation. Cellular migration is initiated by extension of cellular lamellipodia that receive signals from the basement membrane via integrins. Intracellular signaling converges on the actin cytoskeleton, which is responsible for movement of lamellipodia. Specific components of the basement membrane appear to be critical to the migratory process. For example, application of antibodies to collagen types III and IV, which are important components of intestinal mucosal basement membrane, impeded epithelial restitution. 102, 103 Other elements of the basement membrane, including proteoglycans, hyaluronic acid and noncollagenous proteins such as fibronectin and laminin also may provide important signals. 104 These subepithelial matrix components that facilitate restitution may form the basis for clinical treatments designed to speed up the repair process, analogous to administration of matrix components to horses with articular cartilage damage.",

Because the tight junction is principally responsible for regulating the permeability of the interepithelial space, repair and closure of this structure likely is critical to restore intestinal barrier function. Recent research indicates that prostaglandins play a vital role in recovery of tight junction resistance, 105 indicating that administration of nonselective COX inhibitors to horses with colic, particularly those recovering from strangulating obstruction, may be deleterious. Therefore judicious use of NSAIDs is appropriate until more selective drugs that allow continued production of reparative prostaglandins are available for use in horse. 56 After restoration of the epithelial barrier, the epithelium must reestablish normal mucosal architecture to allow normal gut absorptive and digestive function. In porcine ileum subjected to 2 hours of ischemia, the epithelial barrier was restored within 18 hours, but villi were contracted and covered in epithelium with a squamous appearance. Restoration of normal villous architecture required another 4 days. 42 Newly proliferated crypt epithelium replaces the flattened villous epithelium that characterizes restitution. Under normal circumstances the dividing stem cells, of which the base of each mucosal crypt has approximately four, form new enterocytes. Newly divided enterocytes migrate from the crypt onto the villus. 106 During migration, enterocytes differentiate and acquire specific absorptive and digestive functions. Fully differentiated enterocytes reside on the upper third of the villus for 2 to 3 days and then are sloughed into the intestinal lumen. 107 This process accelerates during mucosal repair and requires increased proliferative rates. A variety of locally available gut-derived factors, including luminal nutrients, polyamines, and growth factors, may stimulate increased proliferation within 12 to 18 hours. 42 The return of the normal leaflike shape of the villus occurs following the appearance of normal columnar epithelium.",

One study implicated prostaglandins in growth factor-stimulated restitution, 108 but a more prominent role of prostaglandins in mucosal repair is their ability to close interepithelial tight junctions. 105, 109, 110 For instance, ischemic-injured small intestine rapidly recovers barrier function (as measured in vitro as transepithelial resistance) in the presence of PGI 2 and PGE 2 , despite the fact that these prostanoids had little effect on villous contraction and epithelial restitution. However, electron microscopic examination of tissues reveals dilation of tight junctions in tissues treated with NSAIDs, 110 whereas those additionally treated with prostaglandins have closely apposed tight junctions (Figures 13.5-3 and 13.5-4). Prostaglandins stimulate closure of tight junctions via the second messengers cyclic adenosine monophosphate and Ca 2+ , 105 which interestingly were among the first mediators found to modulate tight junction permeability. 111, 112 Such tight junction closure is of importance to patients with intestinal injury that are treated with NSAIDs, because reduced prostaglandin levels may result in increased intestinal permeability. For example, in a study on ischemic-injured porcine ileum, treatment with the NSAID indomethacin resulted in a significant increase in intestinal permeability to inulin and lipopolysaccharide compared with tissues that were treated additionally with PGI 2 and PGE 2 . 105 SECTION 13.5 Pathophysiology of Mucosal Injury and Repair A B Figure 13 .5-4 Ultrastructural appearance of repairing ischemic-injured mucosa.

            "text": "The process of restitution absolutely depends on a group of compounds called polyamines. 113, 114 The rate-limiting enzyme in the formation of the polyamines spermine, spermidine, and putrescine is ornithine decarboxylase. In rats with stress-induced duodenal ulcers, systemic administration of the ornithine decarboxylase inhibitor \u03b1-difluoromethylornithine significantly reduced polyamine levels and greatly reduced epithelial restitution. Furthermore, intragastric treatment of these same rats with putrescine, spermidine, and spermine prevented the delayed mucosal repair induced by \u03b1-difluoromethylornithine. 113 Interestingly, gastric tissue levels of ornithine decarboxylase increased in rats with stress-induced gastric ulcers, suggesting that tissue injury enhances polyamine production, which may contribute to the normal rapid rate of epithelial restitution. 115 The mechanisms whereby polyamines stimulate epithelial restitution are not clear. McCormack, Wang, Viar, et al. hypothesized that polyamines increase transglutaminase activity, an enzyme that catalyzes the cross-linking of cytoskeletal and basement membrane proteins. 116 Further investigation of the role of polyamines in IEC-6 cell migration showed that depletion of polyamines resulted in disruption of the cytoskeleton and reduced the physical extension of lamellipodia. 117 More recent studies have clarified this pathway. In particular, polyamines have been shown to regulate cytoskeletal cellular migration via activation of the small guanosine triphosphatase-Rho-A by elevating intracellular Ca 2+ levels. These elevations in Ca 2+ result from polyamine regulation of expression of voltagegated K + channels and altered membrane electric potential. 118 Polyamines also play a role in the normal physiologic regulation of crypt cell proliferation and differentiation. 119,120 Polyamines are produced by fully differentiated enterocytes at the tip of the villus and may reach the crypt within sloughed luminal epithelium or via local villous circulation. 121 Following intestinal injury, polyamines appear to stimulate enhanced proliferation by increasing the expression of protooncogenes, which control the cell cycle. 122 The mechanism whereby polyamines influence gene expression likely relates to the cationic nature of these compounds, which may influence the tertiary structure of negatively charged DNA and RNA. 113 ",

The most important of these growth factors in early mucosal repair events is TGF-\u03b2, which is a potent stimulus of epithelial restitution and modulator of the extracellular matrix. 26 Neutralization of TGF-\u03b2 retards epithelial migration in vitro, and TGF-\u03b2 apparently may serve as a point of convergence for mediators of restitution, because neutralizing TGF-\u03b2 also inhibits the effects of other peptides. However, TGF-\u03b2 paradoxically inhibits epithelial proliferation, thereby reducing the supply of new enterocytes for mucosal repair. Conversely, EGF, produced by the salivary glands and duodenal Brunner's glands, and the related TGF-\u03b1, produced by small intestinal enterocytes, are potent stimulants of enterocyte proliferation. These growth factors share approximately 30% of their amino acid structure, bind to the same receptor on the basolateral surface of enterocytes, and are not related to TGF-\u03b2. 123 The physiologic role of EGF is difficult to discern because it is present in the intestinal lumen, with no apparent access to its basally located receptor. However, EGF has been proposed to act as a \"surveillance agent\" that gains access to its receptor during epithelial injury (when the EGF receptor likely would be exposed) to stimulate proliferation. 124 TGF-\u03b1 presumably has a similar role, but it is present in greater concentrations in the small intestine because it is produced by differentiated villous enterocytes. The mature peptide is cleaved from the extracellular component of the transmembrane TGF-\u03b1 precursor and released into the lumen. 123",

Under physiologic conditions, trefoil peptides are secreted by mucus-producing cells at distinct anatomic sites. For example, gastric epithelium produces the trefoil peptide pS2, whereas the small and large intestine mucosa produce intestinal trefoil peptide. 125 However, any of the trefoil peptides may be upregulated within repairing epithelium regardless of anatomic site. 26, 126 In addition, trefoil peptides have the ability to induce their own expression, amplifying the level of these reparative factors at sites of mucosal repair. 127 Trefoil peptides are the most potent stimulants of epithelial migration in vitro, and their effects are independent of growth factors, including TGF-\u03b2. 128 However, recent evidence suggests that EGF receptor activation is required for induction of pS2 and another of the trefoil peptides, termed spasmolytic peptide, in gastric epithelium in vitro. The importance of trefoil peptides to the mucosal repair response in vivo is illustrated by gene knockout studies, in which mice deficient in intestinal trefoil factor have greatly reduced ability to repair intestinal injury. 129 In fact, detergent-induced mucosal injury was lethal because of a lack of restitution compared with wild-type mice that fully recovered from similar mucosal injury. The fact that administration of intestinal trefoil factor restored restitution has important therapeutic implications. The mechanism whereby trefoil peptides stimulate epithelial migration is yet to be characterized fully but appears to involve translocation of the adherens junction protein E-cadherin, thereby allowing cells to become untethered from neighboring cells. 26 ",

However, recent studies suggest that glutamine and butyrate have more specific proliferative actions aside from their role as nutrients. For example, in the piglet IPEC-J2 enterocyte cell line, glutamine enhanced gene transcription by increasing mitogen-activated protein kinase activity. 130, 131 Similarly, butyrate stimulated mucosal growth following colonic infusion in the rat. 132 Because of such growth-promoting actions, glutamine was shown to prevent intestinal mucosal atrophy and dysfunction that accompanies starvation 133, 134 and long-term total parental nutrition. 135, 136 Additionally, glutamine improves function of transplanted small intestine 137, 138 and protects intestinal mucosa from injury if administered before chemotherapy 139 and radiation therapy. 140, 141 Intestinal nutrients also may synergize with other proliferative agents. For example, administration of glutamine and TGF-\u03b1 to porcine ileum that had been subjected to 2 hours of ischemia resulted in a synergistic increase in mitogen-activated protein kinase activity, enterocyte proliferation, and villous surface area. 42 Although concern has arisen that such early return to normal surface area may result in dysfunctional mucosal digestive and absorptive function because of resurfacing denuded mucosa with immature epithelium, nutrients and growth factors also appear to promote early differentiation. In the case of glutamine and TGF-\u03b1 restoration of postischemic small intestine, rapid recovery of digestive enzymes also was documented. 142 ",

Additional factors that influence the net transit of digesta include gravity, the volume and viscosity of the contents, and pressure gradients created by simultaneous contraction and relaxation of adjacent segments of bowel. Casual use of the term intestinal motility in veterinary medicine often underestimates the complexity of the processes involved in the transit of intestinal contents. This is particularly true when the term is used to describe the frequency and or intensity of intestinal sounds, or borborygmi. The existence of borborygmi does not always equate with progressive movement of intestinal contents. Disruption to normal motility occurs commonly in horses for a variety of reasons. Examples of diseases in which altered motility may be present include gastroduodenal ulceration, intraluminal obstruction or impaction, excessive wall distention, strangulating obstructions, peritonitis, and inflammatory bowel diseases such as duodenitis proximal jejunits or colitis. Ineffective intestinal motility is also a feature of several neonatal diseases, including prematurity, systemic sepsis, and perinatal asphyxia. Certain parasitic infections, electrolyte derangements, and endotoxemia can modify digesta transit in horses of all ages. General anesthesia and specific sedatives, such as xylazine, romifidine, or detomidine, also disturb motility.",

[5] [6] [7] The condition most commonly occurs after general anesthesia and extraabdominal surgery, particularly orthopedic and upper airway procedures, and therefore often is categorized as a form of POI. Anecdotally, horses at greatest risk are young male performance animals. Other cases occur spontaneously, often in animals with painful primary conditions such as uveitis or septic tenosynovitis. The syndrome is frustrating in that clinical signs are often subtle unless cecal perforation has occurred. In horses with a cecal emptying defect after anesthesia, overt signs are usually apparent 3 to 5 days after the procedure. The earliest detectable signs include depression and a reduction in feed intake and fecal output. Ineffective emptying results in overfilling of the cecum with moist contents, which is manifest by signs of mild to moderate colic. If the condition is recognized late or untreated, the cecum may rupture and result in fatal peritonitis.",

            "text": "The inherent rhythmicity of electric activity in the intestine is controlled by the interstitial cells of Cajal, specialized cells that are electrically coupled to myocytes via gap junctions. 8 These cells are responsible for generating and propagating slow-wave activity and may be critically involved in a range of motility disorders. The enteric nervous system primarily controls and coordinates intestinal contraction. A combination of central and autonomic innervation influences events, but contraction does not require external neural input. The parasympathetic supply to the gastrointestinal tract is via the vagus and pelvic nerves, and the sympathetic supply is through postganglionic fibers of the cranial and caudal mesenteric plexuses. A complex network of interneurons within each plexus integrates and amplifies neural input; the intensity and frequency of resultant smooth muscle contractions are proportional to the amount of sympathetic and parasympathetic input. Additional binding sites for a number of other endogenous chemicals, including dopamine, motilin, and serotonin exist within the enteric nervous system and on smooth muscle cells. 9 Acetylcholine is the dominant excitatory neurotransmitter in the gastrointestinal tract and exerts its action through muscurinic type 2 receptors on smooth muscle cells. Sympathetic fibers innervating the gastrointestinal tract are adrenergic, postganglionic fibers with cell bodies located in the prevertebral ganglia. Activation of \u03b1 2adrenergic receptors on cholinergic neurons within enteric ganglia inhibits the release of acetylcholine and therefore reduces intestinal contraction. \u03b2 1 -, \u03b2 2 -, and \u03b2-atypical receptors are directly inhibitory to the intestinal smooth muscle. 10 Inhibitory nonadrenergic, noncholinergic neurotransmitters include adenosine triphosphate, vasoactive intestinal peptide, and nitric oxide. 11, 12 These neurotransmitters are critical for mediating descending inhibition during peristalsis and receptive relaxation. Substance P is a nonadrenergic, noncholinergic neurotransmitter that may be involved in contraction of the large colon. 13, 14 The rate and force of intestinal contractions along the small intestine and large colon of the horse are important determinants of intestinal motility; of even greater importance to the net propulsion of digesta are the cyclical patterns of contractile activity. These patterns are known as the small intestinal and colonic migrating motility (or myoelectric) complexes (MMCs). 15, 16 The colonic complex usually originates in the right ventral colon and variably traverses the ascending and descending colons. Many of these complexes are related temporally to a specialized motility event of the ileum, the migrating action potential complex.",

Experimental data from other species suggests that handling of the small or large intestine at the time of surgery activates resident macrophages with resultant increased expression of P-selectin and intercellular adhesion molecule 1 on endothelial cells within the vasculature of the muscularis. The upregulation of associated ligands on leukocytes leads to sequential \"sticking and rolling,\" followed by neutrophil migration into the interstitium.

Consequently, the efferent limb of the reflex expresses increased sympathetic outflow, primarily mediated through stimulation of \u03b1 2 -adrenoreceptors, and inhibition of acetylcholine release, which provides the rationale for \u03b1 2 -blockade in treating ileus.

This syndrome may best mimic POI in human beings and generally is considered a large intestinal disorder. An important difference in horses is that laparotomy is a rare predisposing factor, and most cases occur in horses undergoing routine extraabdominal surgical procedures. General anesthesia itself is a potent inhibitor of gastrointestinal motility in horses, but these effects are short-lived and reversible within hours of anesthetic withdrawal. 15 The return of normal motility in horses after experimental ileus was most delayed in the cecum, suggesting that this may be a common site of ileus in horses. 36 A link between routine postoperative medications, such as phenylbutazone and aminoglycoside antibiotics, has been suspected but not established. An inhibitory effect of NSAIDs on large colon contractility has been demonstrated using in vitro techniques. 37 Primary sympathetic overstimulation could be involved, for many of the affected animals are young, male horses or animals with painful diseases.",

Bethanechol is a synthetic ester of acetylcholine and is not degraded by anticholinesterase. Bethanechol has cholinergic side effects, including abdominal discomfort, sweating, and salivation, although these are minimal when the drug is administered at 0.025 mg/kg body mass subcutaneously or orally. Bethanechol has efficacy in diseases that involve abnormal gastric emptying and delayed small intestinal transit and has been shown to increase gastric contractility and hasten the emptying of liquid and solid phase markers from the stomach of normal horses. [46] [47] Bethanechol also increases the strength and duration of wall contractions in the cecum and right ventral colon and consequently speeds up cecal emptying. Neostigmine increases receptor levels of acetylcholine by inhibiting cholinesterase. The drug (0.022 to 0.025 mg/kg intravenously) promotes cecal and colonic contractile activity and hastens the emptying of radiolabeled markers from the cecum. 24 Neostigmine has been used to manage small intestinal ileus, but it significantly delayed the emptying of 6-mm beads from the stomach of normal adult horses. 48 Metoclopramide acts principally as a 5-hydroxytryptamine 4-receptor (5HT-4) agonist and 5HT-3-receptor antagonist. In contrast to newer generation benzamides, metoclopramide is also an antagonist at dopamine 1 (DA 1 ) and 2 (DA 2 ) receptors. Antagonism of prejunctional DA 2 receptors facilitates acetylcholine release and smooth muscle contraction. Metoclopramide crosses the blood-brain barrier, where its antagonist properties on central DA 2 receptors can result in extrapyramidal signs, including seizure. These signs were responsible for poor acceptance of the drug in equine practice. Most investigators have failed to demonstrate significant effects of metoclopramide in experimental animals, but constant intravenous infusion (0.04 mg/kg/hr) in a population of postoperative horses significantly decreased the volume and duration of gastric reflux over control and intermittent drug infusion groups. 49 Infusion was well tolerated and appeared to be superior to intermittent infusion or no treatment at all.",

In its pathophysiologic consequences the innate immune response to endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide) is similar to the response to other stimuli; for example, overwhelming bacterial infection, viral infection, or severe trauma. The term systemic inflammatory response syndrome therefore was introduced to describe a general systemic inflammatory process independent of cause. Sepsis is defined as the \"systemic inflammatory response to infection,\" and septic shock as \"sepsis-induced hypotension, persisting despite adequate fluid resuscitation, along with the presence of hypoperfusion abnormalities or organ dysfunction.\" 1 According to these definitions the diagnosis of sepsis requires documentation of infection by culture in addition to two or more of the following findings: hypo-or hyperthermia, tachycardia, tachypnea or hypocapnia, and leukocytosis, leukopenia, or an increased proportion of immature leukocyte forms. Organ failure is a common sequela of endotoxic or septic shock, and the term multiple organ dysfunction syndrome describes insufficiency of two or more organ systems, as evident by clinical or clinicopathologic changes.

Endotoxin later was found to be a heat-stable lipopolysaccharide structure, and the terms endotoxin and lipopolysaccharide now are used interchangeably. Lipopolysaccharide is a major structural cell wall component of all gram-negative bacteria, including noninfectious species (Figure 13 .7-1). With 3 to 4 \u00d7 10 6 molecules per cell, lipopolysaccharide makes up about 75% of the outer layer of the outer cell membrane and is a key functional molecule for the bacterial outer membrane, serving as a permeability barrier against external noxious agents. The lipopolysaccharide molecule consists of four domains, which are essential for the virulence of gram-negative bacteria. 3 Three of the domains (inner core, outer core and O-specific chain) represent the hydrophilic polysaccharide portion of the molecule, whereas the lipid A portion represents the hydrophobic lipid portion ( Figure 13 .7-2).

Depending on the nature of the underlying disease, these bacteria may circulate in the bloodstream in their intact form (i.e., bacteremia), may be confined to a localized infectious process, or may be part of the endogenous bacterial flora colonizing the gastrointestinal tract. In any of these scenarios, endotoxin molecules are released as a by-product of bacterial growth and in large numbers on bacterial cell death. 10 Common infectious conditions associated with endotoxemia in horses include neonatal gram-negative sepsis, bacterial pneumonia and pleuropneumonia, endometritis, peritonitis, and infectious colitis with bacteria such as Salmonella spp., that are not part of the normal intestinal flora. In one study, for example, endotoxin was detectable in plasma of 50% of foals evaluated for presumed sepsis. 11 The term translocation describes entry of endogenous bacteria and bacterial products from the gastrointestinal tract into tissues and the systemic circulation. 12 The natural intestinal flora of horses consists mainly of gramnegative, anaerobic bacteria, and thus large amounts of endotoxin normally exist in the lumen of the equine intestinal tract. 13 Even in health, small amounts of endotoxin cross the intact mucosal barrier and reach the portal circulation and the liver. These molecules are cleared, however, by the mononuclear phagocytic system in the liver and only lead to a localized and restricted activation of the host immune system. For endotoxin translocation to become detrimental, excessive amounts have to cross the intestinal barrier and overwhelm the mononuclear phagocytic system or the capacity of the liver to detoxify lipopolysaccharide must be compromised. The latter may be a concern in conditions such as hepatitis, cholangiohepatitis, or portosystemic shunting of blood.",

Colic patients are prime candidates to development endotoxemia, and plasma endotoxin was detectable in 10% to 40% of colic patients on admission. 14,15 A higher percentage of horses tested positive for endotoxin when only patients presented for surgical intervention were evaluated. 15 Aside from gastrointestinal rupture, increased permeability to intact bacteria or free endotoxin molecules is thought to be associated most commonly with ischemic insults such as strangulating obstruction and bowel infarction, severe inflammation as in proximal enteritis and colitis, bacterial overgrowth, and intraluminal acidosis, which occurs with grain overload. 16, 17 One study, however, found no difference in plasma endotoxin detection between disease groups, therefore emphasizing the fact that any disease of the abdominal cavity can induce endotoxemia in horses. In the same study, endotoxin was approximately 3 times more likely to be detected in peritoneal fluid as opposed to plasma samples. Similarly, higher cytokine concentrations have been measured in peritoneal fluid than in plasma. The likely explanation for these findings is a local inflammatory response in the peritoneal cavity elicited by translocated bacteria and/or lipopolysaccharide molecules before their absorption into the systemic circulation. 14 Although certainly the most important factor in horses, conditions other than gastrointestinal disease may result in translocation of endotoxin and bacteria. In experimental studies using laboratory animals, entry of gutassociated bacteria into the lymphatic system was demonstrated after hypovolemic shock, burn injuries, trauma, malnutrition, and starvation. [18] [19] [20] Furthermore, endotoxin itself caused bacterial translocation into mesenteric lymph nodes after intraperitoneal administration to mice. 21 These findings have received much attention in the literature concerning human patients because they serve to explain cases of endotoxic shock in the absence of demonstrable bacterial infection. One should keep in mind the possibility of translocation when evaluating cases of presumed systemic inflammatory response syndrome in horses, in which one cannot demonstrate bacterial infection or gastrointestinal disease. Endotoxin translocation also may be associated with strenuous exercise, which results in reduced splanchnic blood flow, hypoxemia, and a higher body temperature. In fit racehorses a significantly increased mean plasma lipopolysaccharide concentration was found after racing, whereas antilipopolysaccharide immunoglobulin G levels were decreased. Fit horses showed significantly higher antilipopolysaccharide immunoglobulin G concentrations at rest than sedentary controls, suggesting leakage of small amounts of endotoxin from the intestinal lumen during training and racing. 22 The clinical significance of these findings requires further investigation.",

            "text": "The initiating event in the pathophysiology of endotoxemia is the activation of lipopolysaccharideresponsive cells by endotoxin, resulting in altered cellular functions and increased expression of inflammatory mediators. Immune cells such as macrophages, which are the first to encounter endotoxin, respond to minute amounts of lipopolysaccharide, which usually allows them to eliminate gram-negative bacteria and free lipopolysaccharide molecules efficiently. An important factor in the exquisite sensitivity to lipopolysaccharide is the presence of lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP). 4 LBP is an approximately 60-kd plasma glycoprotein 23 synthesized by hepatocytes 24 and belongs to the group of acute phase proteins. Under the control of inflammatory agents and cytokines, LBP concentration in plasma increases approximately 100-fold within 24 hours of an inflammatory stimulus. 25 The main function of LBP is to transfer lipopolysaccharide to endotoxin-responsive cells, which include mononuclear phagocytes, neutrophils, lymphocytes, and endothelial cells. The importance of a highly sensitive response to lipopolysaccharide for protection against gram-negative bacterial infection is demonstrated in experiments using LBP \"knock-out\" mice (mice that lack the LBP gene and are therefore unable to synthesize LBP). Although these animals are resistant to the effects of isolated lipopolysaccharide, they are unable to control bacterial infection and rapidly succumb. 26 Despite its crucial importance for an effective host defense, LBP is not essential for lipopolysaccharide-receptor interaction per se, because high concentrations of lipopolysaccharide can activate cells in the absence of LBP. 27 Aside from its role as a catalyst of cellular activation by lipopolysaccharide, LBP has opsonizing activity 28 and participates in the phagocytosis of lipopolysaccharide by macrophages and neutrophils. 29, 30 Although phagocytosis of lipopolysaccharide is receptor dependent, it appears to be uncoupled from intracellular signaling events and occurs in the absence of cell activation. 31 LBP further catalyzes transfer of lipopolysaccharide to lipoproteins such as high-density lipoprotein, which neutralizes lipopolysaccharide activity. 32 This detoxifying effect may become important when large amounts of lipopolysaccharide are present. A protective effect of LBP against lipopolysaccharide challenge and infection has been demonstrated in a murine model. 33 The most important lipopolysaccharide receptors known to date are cluster differentiation antigen 14 (CD14) 27 and Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). 34 Both are classified as pattern recognition receptors, 35 which means that they recognize lipopolysaccharide as a pattern common to all gram-negative bacteria. CD14 is a 53-kd protein that in its membrane-bound form (mCD14) is inserted into the cell membrane via a glycosylphosphatidyl-inositol anchor. 36 CD14 is expressed primarily on monocytes and tissue macrophages and to a lesser extent on neutrophils. 37 CD14 also is found in a free, or soluble, form (sCD14) 38 that can bind to cell types lacking CD14, such as endothelial cells, and make them lipopolysaccharide-responsive. In addition to this proinflammatory effect, high concentrations of sCD14 can sequester and neutralize lipopolysaccharide. 39 The amount of circulating sCD14 greatly increases during inflammation, which makes it a useful marker of acute and chronic inflammation. 37 Although CD14 is known to be crucial for cellular activation, it cannot transmit signals to the inside of the cell because it lacks a transmembrane domain. The missing link between CD14 and the cytosolic environment is a Toll-like receptor in association with a molecule named MD-2. 40 The name Toll-like receptor stems from the homology of the mammalian receptor with a receptor type in Drosophila (Toll) that is important for dorsoventral orientation and immune responses in the fly. A number of Toll-like receptors have been identified in mammalian species so far, but TLR4 appears to be the receptor subtype most important for lipopolysaccharide signaling. 34 The importance of CD14 and TLR4 in the cellular response to lipopolysaccharide has been demonstrated in a number of experiments. Mice deficient in CD14 are incapable of mounting a normal inflammatory response to lipopolysaccharide, 39 whereas mutation or deletion of the gene encoding for TLR4 causes lipopolysaccharide hyporesponsiveness. [41] [42] [43] After binding of lipopolysaccharide to cellular receptors, a multitude of signaling events takes place within the cell and results in the alterations of cellular metabolism known as cell activation. Signaling pathways are characterized by sequential phosphorylation and thereby activation of enzymatic activities. A typical end result of intracellular signaling is the activation of transcription factors; for example, proteins that bind to DNA and promote gene transcription. Translational mechanisms are activated in a similar manner. Among the bestcharacterized pathways in endotoxin-induced cell signaling are the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways and the activation of transcription factor nuclear factor \u03baB (NF\u03baB) (Figure 13.7-4) . 44, 45 In the NF\u03baB pathway the intracellular domain of TLR4 associates with the adapter protein myeloid differentiation factor 88 and recruits interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase to the complex. Activation of interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase, tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor, NF\u03baB-inducing kinase, and I\u03baB-kinase follow, and lastly, I\u03baB is phosphorylated. I\u03baB is an inhibitor protein complex that sequesters and inactivates NF\u03baB in the cytoplasm. On phosphorylation, I\u03baB is ubiquinated and degraded, and NF\u03baB is translocated to the nucleus where it unfolds its activity. 46 NF\u03baB is a dimeric protein complex with several isoforms of which the p65/p50 heterodimer is the most important inducible complex in mammals. 47 Proteins of importance for the pathogenesis of septic shock, the genes of which contain promoter elements for NF\u03baB, include cytokines, inducible nitric oxide synthase, and cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2). 44 Three groups of MAPKs known to be crucially important for lipopolysaccharide-induced signal transduction are extracellular signal-regulated kinase, c-Jun-terminal kinase, and p38. Final effects of signaling through MAPK pathways include the activation of several transcription factors, translation initiation factors, and cytosolic enzymes such as phospholipase A 2 , as well as an increase in the expression of adhesion molecules on the cell surface. 44 Despite the characterization of seemingly separate pathways, one should recognize that interaction and synergy between pathways is likely to occur. For example, simultaneous activation of p38, c-Jun-terminal kinase, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase results in much higher levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) reporter expression than activation of a single pathway. 44, 48 Aside from the mechanisms described here, pathways involving atypical protein kinase C 49,50 and receptor-independent integration of lipopolysaccharide into the cell membrane and ceramide-like second messenger activity of lipopolysaccharide 37 have been proposed. Additional pathways are likely to be uncovered in the ongoing investigation of intracellular signaling mechanisms and their in vivo significance.",

            "text": "Although endotoxin can exert some direct effects, cytokines are a primary mediator of lipopolysaccharide effects. Cytokines are glycoprotein molecules that regulate inflammatory and immune responses by acting as a signal between cells. 51 Cytokines of major interest in the pathogenesis of endotoxemia include TNF, the interleukins, chemokines, and growth factors such as granulocyte-monocyte colony-stimulating factor. TNF is thought of as the most \"proximal\" cytokine released in response to lipopolysaccharide. Studies corroborate this by showing that administration of recombinant TNF mimics the effects of lipopolysaccharide, 52 and that antibodies directed against TNF protect against the lethal effects of endotoxin. 53 Increased plasma activity of TNF is associated with increased mortality in equine patients with acute gastrointestinal disease and in septic neonates. 14 Despite being a structurally diverse group of proteins, cytokines share several characteristics that allow them to execute their complex functions in the inflammatory response. 51 Any individual cytokine generally is produced by several different cell types, can act on different cell types, and has multiple effects on any given cell. Furthermore, cytokine effects are redundant, meaning that different cytokines can share the same effect. In endotoxemia, this is particularly true for the effects of interleukin-1 (IL-1) and TNF. 54 Many of the biologic activities of cytokines in vivo result from synergistic or antagonistic actions involving two or more cytokines. 55 Within itself the cytokine response is highly regulated: cytokines induce or suppress synthesis of other cytokines including their own (feedback regulation), regulate expression of cytokine receptors, and regulate cytokine activities. Additional regulatory mechanisms include the release of specific cytokine inhibitors such as soluble IL-1 and TNF-\u03b1 receptors, cytokine receptor antagonists such as IL-1 receptor antagonist, and antiinflammatory cytokines including IL-10, IL-4, IL-13, and transforming growth factor \u03b2. Glucocorticoids also are produced increasingly in response to endotoxin and inhibit the production of cytokines. 56 During a controlled inflammatory response, therefore, cytokine secretion is a selflimited event, whereas excessive stimulation of cytokine release can lead to the perpetuation of the inflammatory response even after the initial stimulus has been removed. Conversely, the compensatory antiinflammatory reaction can become severe enough to cause anergy of the immune system and increased susceptibility to infection, which has been termed the compensatory antiinflammatory response syndrome. Overall, excessive and unbalanced stimulation of the immune system therefore may result in predominantly proinflammatory (systemic inflammatory response syndrome), antiinflammatory (compensatory antiinflammatory response syndrome), or combined (mixed antagonist response syndrome) responses. 57 Interestingly, tolerance to endotoxin develops after repeated exposure to lipopolysaccharide. 58 Tolerance can be demonstrated in vitro and in vivo and encompasses decreased production of cytokines and a diminished clinical response. 58, 59 Mechanisms that likely are responsible for the development of endotoxin tolerance include receptor downregulation and inhibition of intracellular signaling pathways. 60, 61 Cytokines such as TNF are important mediators in the development of endotoxin tolerance. 62 The development of endotoxin tolerance in horses has been reported. 63, 64 Aside from cytokines, a number of other molecules function as inflammatory mediators in the pathogenesis of endotoxemia, the synthesis and release of which are stimulated by endotoxin and by cytokines. These mediators include the arachidonic acid metabolites or prostanoids, platelet-activating factor (PAF), oxygenderived free radicals, nitric oxide (NO), histamine, kinins, and complement components. Table 13 .7-1 summarizes the origins, targets, and effects of the most important inflammatory mediators involved in the pathogenesis of endotoxemia. Figure 13 .7-5 shows the pathways of arachidonic acid metabolism by COX and lipoxygenase. COX products are the prostaglandins (PGs), prostacyclin (PGI 2 ) and thromboxanes, and the lipoxygenase produces the leukotrienes. ",

Endothelial dysfunction and damage result in a decreased responsiveness to vasoactive agents (vasoplegia), increased vascular permeability, and a tendency for clot formation in the microvasculature. If the basement membrane and underlying matrix are compromised, further microvascular hemorrhage can occur. Endothelial cell damage is primarily neutrophilmediated. More specifically, damage is caused by oxygen-derived free radicals, which are produced within endothelial cells via reactions involving neutrophil-derived elastase and hydrogen peroxide molecules, endothelial cell enzymes such as xanthine oxidase, and endothelial cytosolic iron. The hypochloric anion radical (HO\u02d9) is thought to be responsible most directly for endothelial cell cytotoxicity. NO\u02d9produced by constitutively expressed nitric oxide synthase in endothelial cells may afford protection from oxygen radical-induced endothelial cell damage. NO is able to scavenge superoxide radicals and react with them to form peroxynitrite. Variations in the ability to produce NO may explain why vascular beds in different organs vary in their susceptibility to neutrophilmediated damage. 66 Excessive production of NO by an inducible form of nitric oxide synthase (i NOS), however, contributes to tissue damage, and increased peroxynitrite concentrations may be responsible in part for PAF-induced increases in vascular permeability. 67 In addition to oxygen-derived free radicals, activated neutrophils release matrix metalloproteinases, which contribute to tissue damage. 56 Vascular endothelial cells are further susceptible to direct effects of various cytokines, most prominently TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1. These cytokines are thought to cause damage via the induction of COX activity and production of prostanoids and through generation of free radicals.",

            "text": "Neutrophil activation by lipopolysaccharide and cytokines results in stimulation of phagocytosis and the respiratory burst, release of lysosomal enzymes and inflammatory mediators, and expression of adhesion molecules. Perhaps the single most specific clinicopathologic indicator of endotoxemia is pronounced neutropenia, 68 which temporally correlates with peak plasma concentrations of TNF. 69 Neutropenia is caused primarily by margination of neutrophils in the vasculature, whereas significant loss through active migration into peripheral tissues likely is limited to the presence of a localized source of infection. Margination is made possible by adhesion molecules on endothelial cells and leukocytes that interact and allow sticking of leukocytes to the endothelial lining of blood vessels. Endotoxin or cytokines such as TNF and IL-1 can initiate expression of adhesion molecules. 70 Subsequent transmigration of cells into tissue spaces is aided by the production of leukocyte collagenase, which allows enzymatic destruction of the vascular basement membrane. Margination and transmigration of neutrophils occurs in three phases. 70, 71 In the first phase of tethering and rolling, endothelial cells are stimulated to express P-selectin and E-selectin, which bind to P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 and sialylated Lewis-X-like structures on leukocytes, respectively. Whereas P-selectin is stored preformed in Weibel-Palade bodies of endothelial cells, E-selectin is expressed only following stimulation by cytokines. Additionally, constitutively expressed L-selectin on neutrophils can bind to endothelial glycoproteins and glycolipids. During the second phase, firm adhesion is mediated by binding of neutrophil integrins (LFA-1 and Mac-1, also known as CD11a/CD18 and CD11b/CD18) to intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (an immunoglobulin structure) on endothelial cells. Although integrins are expressed constitutively on the leukocyte surface, activation signals are necessary to induce a high-affinity state and interaction with the endothelial surface. Transmigration finally requires the expression of yet another adhesion molecule, namely platelet/endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1, which is located at the intercellular junction of endothelial cells. 71 Chemotactic factors including activated complement factor C5a and the CXC chemokines control transmigration. 66 The latter group includes IL-8, which is expressed by endothelial cells in response to activation. Rebound neutrophilia, which is observed frequently following episodes of endotoxemia, is caused by neutrophil release from the bone marrow reserve pool and by stimulation of myeloid cell proliferation via granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and is mediated primarily by TNF and IL-1. 54",

            "text": "Activation of the coagulation cascade culminates in the cleavage of fibrinogen to fibrin by the serine protease thrombin. Thrombin deposition on endothelial cell surfaces leads to platelet adherence and their activation by surface-bound PAF. 56 The intrinsic and extrinsic arms of the coagulation cascade are activated in endotoxemia. The intrinsic pathway is initiated by activation of coagulation factor XII (Hageman factor), prekallikrein, and highmolecular-weight kininogen, which compose the contact system. 75 Although direct activation of coagulation factor XII by endotoxin has been demonstrated, 76 the extrinsic pathway likely is more important for the development of coagulopathy in endotoxemia and sepsis. 75 Activation of the extrinsic pathway depends on the interaction of coagulation factor VII with tissue factor, which is the only coagulation factor not constitutively present in blood. Tissue factor is present in subendothelial tissues and is exposed on vascular injury but also is expressed on endothelial cells and mononuclear phagocytes in response to lipopolysaccharide. 77, 78 Increased expression of monocyte tissue factor (also described as increased procoagulant activity) was found to be associated significantly with coagulopathy and poor prognosis in horses with colic. 79 Furthermore, lipopolysaccharide-induced tissue factor expression by equine peritoneal macrophages may be associated with the development of intraabdominal adhesions. 63 Regulatory mechanisms of the coagulation cascade include tissue factor pathway inhibitor, antithrombin III (AT III), and the protein C system. 75 Protein C acts as an anticoagulant by inactivating clotting factors V and VIII and promotes fibrinolysis by inactivating plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI). 80 Protein C activation by thrombin-thrombomodulin complexes is important for the anticoagulative properties of normal endothelium, 75 and downregulation of endothelial thrombomodulin expression by TNF and IL-1 and decreased expression of AT III and tissue factor pathway inhibitor by damaged endothelial cells contribute to the procoagulant state in endotoxemia and sepsis. [81] [82] [83] In addition, activation of vascular endothelial cells leads to a loss of prostacyclin and NO production and an increased release of thromboxane A 2 (TXA 2 ). As a result, platelets are stimulated to aggregate and release TXA 2 and PAF, thereby further promoting clot formation. 17 The crucial step in the fibrinolytic cascade is the conversion of plasminogen to plasmin, a fibrin-degrading enzyme. 75 Tissue-type (tPA) and urokinase-type (uPA) plasminogen activator are the major initiators of fibrinolysis, whereas PAI and \u03b1 2 -antiplasmin are the main regulatory components. 84, 85 TNF and IL-1 have been shown to induce the release of uPA and tPA and the synthesis of PAI. 75 Activation of fibrinolysis leads to consumption of \u03b1 2 -antiplasmin and accumulation of FDPs, which if present in high concentrations can interfere with platelet aggregation, fibrin polymerization, and thrombin formation and can promote bleeding. Additionally, FDPs mediate an increase in vascular permeability. Lipopolysaccharide infusion in rabbits 86 and human beings 87 resulted in an early increase in plasma tPA activity, followed by a later profound rise in PAI activity and fall in tPA activity. Increased plasma PAI concentrations also were found in horses with colic compared with controls. 88, 89 Thus although fibrinolysis may compensate initially for accelerated coagulation, its subsequent inhibition contributes to clot formation.",

Shock caused by endotoxemia is classified as distributive shock 93 and is largely initiated by vascular dysfunction in the periphery. Peripheral vascular beds are of major importance for the regulation of local tissue perfusion and affect systemic blood pressure by regulating total peripheral resistance. Normally, vascular smooth muscle tone is regulated by endothelin-1 (vasoconstriction), NO, and prostacyclin (vasodilation) released from vascular endothelial cells. 94 As mentioned before, detrimental effects of NO are attributable to induction of i NOS in macrophages and other cell types, rather than endothelialderived NO. Peripheral vasomotor effects of endotoxin manifest as vasodilation and vasoplegia and are mediated by PGI 2 , NO, and mediators such as bradykinin. Widespread vasodilation leads to vascular blood pooling, decentralization of blood flow, decreased venous return, and in effect decreased effective circulating volume and cardiac output. 93 Compensatory responses in the form of an initial hyperdynamic phase include tachycardia, increased cardiac output and central venous pressure, pulmonary hypertension, peripheral vasoconstriction, and increased peripheral vascular resistance. 93, 95, 96 The early vasoconstrictive phase corresponds to an increased serum concentration of TXA 2 , 17 but additional vasoconstrictors such as arginine vasopressin, angiotensin II, serotonin, endothelin, and norepinephrine likely are implicated in the pathogenesis of shock and organ failure. 56 With progression of disease, the animal enters a stage of decompensated shock and progressive systemic hypotension, which correspond to increased plasma concentrations of prostacyclin, PGE 2 and bradykinin. 17, 56 Inadequate blood flow and oxygen delivery to tissues caused by hypotension is confounded by direct myocardial suppression via NO, 93 increased vascular permeability, 17 intravascular microthrombosis, and impaired tissue oxygen extraction 93 and results in progressive metabolic acidosis and inhibition of normal cellular metabolism.",

The Limulus amebocyte lysate assay is an activity assay based on the endotoxin-sensitive hemolymph coagulation cascade in the horseshoe crab Limulus polyphemus. In Limulus this reaction is thought to be a defense mechanism against gram-negative infection. 97 Although frequently used as a research tool, the assay is not convenient enough to become a routine clinical test. The clinician therefore must appreciate the primary disease processes associated with a high risk of endotoxemia and rely on clinical signs and clinicopathologic data to achieve a diagnosis. In some cases, endotoxemia may be the first indication of disease or may be the most overt of otherwise subtle clinical manifestations. With colitis or proximal enteritis, for example, one may detect signs of endotoxemia before the development of colic, diarrhea, or gastric reflux, which more specifically indicate the nature of the primary illness. Diseases such as peritonitis or pleuritis, however, may show nonspecific clinical findings including fever, anorexia, and depression. Findings such as neutropenia, which indicate endotoxemia, should urge the clinician to search for a septic process.",

On administration of sublethal doses of lipopolysaccharide the clinical response can be divided into the early hyperdynamic and the later hypodynamic or shock phases. Clinical signs during the first phase, which begins within 15 to 45 minutes after lipopolysaccharide administration, include anorexia, yawning, sweating, depression, evidence of abdominal discomfort, muscle fasciculation, and recumbency. Heart and respiratory rates increase, and decreased borborygmi suggest ileus. Hyperemia of the mucous membranes and an accelerated capillary refill time indicate the hyperdynamic state. 68 If one administers large amounts of lipopolysaccharide or if exposure is ongoing, depression worsens progressively, anorexia persists, and feces develop diarrheic character. Signs of colic typically abate after the initial stage. Fever develops as a result of direct action of TNF on the thermoregulatory center and IL-1-induced local production of PGE 2 in or near the hypothalamus. 98, 99 Because of compromised peripheral perfusion, mucous membrane color changes to brick red or purple, a dark \"toxic\" line appears, and capillary refill time is prolonged. 68 Inadequate peripheral perfusion and compromised organ function finally characterize the hypodynamic shock phase. Body temperature may become subnormal and the skin, especially on extremities, is cool to the touch. The arterial pulse weakens and venous fill is decreased. Vascular endothelial damage and increased capillary permeability result in a muddy mucous membrane color and diffuse scleral reddening.",

            "text": "Serum electrolyte abnormalities primarily depend on the nature and duration of underlying disease processes and need to be evaluated individually. Common sources of electrolyte loss are gastrointestinal secretions, urine, and sweat; however, severe effusion into body cavities may contribute. In anorexic patients, lack of dietary intake is a confounding factor that warrants consideration. In human patients, gram-negative sepsis frequently is associated with hypocalcemia, more specifically a decrease in serum ionized calcium concentration. Endotoxin is thought to be a causative factor, and proposed mechanisms include acquired parathyroid gland insufficiency, dietary vitamin D deficiency, impaired calcium mobilization, and renal 1\u03b1-hydroxylase insufficiency leading to decreased 1,25-hydroxylation of vitamin D. Hypocalcemia in septic human patients was found to be associated with hypotension and poor outcome. 102 In horses with surgically managed gastrointestinal disease, decreased serum ionized calcium concentration was a common finding and was most severe in patients with strangulating or nonstrangulating infarctions. In some horses, ionized calcium concentration decreased further throughout surgery. Treatment with calcium gluconate resulted in normalization of serum ionized calcium concentrations in all cases. 103 Septic neonatal patients are frequently hypoglycemic. Aside from decreased oral intake and generally increased metabolism, glucose use by the infecting bacteria, inhibition of gluconeogenesis by endotoxin, and insulinlike activity produced by macrophages are responsible for hypoglycemia. 17 Interestingly, experimental endotoxin administration results in transient hyperglycemia in adult horses, 95 whereas profound hypoglycemia occurs in foals. 104 One should evaluate coagulation parameters if coagulopathy is suspected. The most significant changes can be expected with severe inflammatory disease such as colitis, 72,73 devitalized intestine as with strangulating obstruction, 73, 105 and with increased duration of disease. In 30 horses with acute gastrointestinal disease, coagulation profiles were considered normal in only 2 horses. 72 Although coagulation times may be shortened during the procoagulant state, commonly observed abnormalities with developing DIC include an increased concentration of FDPs and soluble fibrin monomer, prolonged prothrombin time indicative of factor VII consumption, prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time indicative of factor VIII:C and IX consumption, prolonged thrombin time, decreased AT III activity, thrombocytopenia, and decreased protein C and plasminogen activities. Fibrinogen concentration frequently increases and reflects the acute phase response rather than coagulation abnormalities. 79 Some clinicians make a diagnosis of DIC if three or more coagulation parameters (specifically AT III, FDPs, platelet count, prothrombin time, and activated partial thromboplastin time) are abnormal, 105 whereas others require overt clinical signs of hemorrhage and concomitant thrombosis in addition to classic laboratory findings. 73 The prognostic value of coagulation parameters has been evaluated. 16, 73, 89 Overall, persistence or worsening of abnormalities in the face of treatment appears to be more indicative of poor outcome than alterations in any specific parameter. In one study, decreased serum AT III concentration was the parameter most commonly associated with fatal outcome in mature horses with colic. 72 One should further evaluate the serum biochemical profile regarding compromise or failure of specific organ systems. Increases in serum creatinine and urea nitrogen concentration can have prerenal, renal, or postrenal causes. In cases of endotoxemia and sepsis, prerenal azotemia caused by dehydration and decreased renal blood flow and renal azotemia caused by organ failure are most likely to occur. One can use urine specific gravity and the response to fluid therapy to differentiate renal from prerenal causes of azotemia. Although ideally one should perform urinalysis before initiating fluid therapy, one should never delay treatment to obtain a sample and instead should use the first available urine sample. With prerenal azotemia, urine specific gravity is increased, urinalysis is normal in other respects, and azotemia resolves with adequate fluid therapy. Azotemia in the face of normal or decreased urine specific gravity, however, indicates compromised renal function. Depending on the extent of renal damage, proteinuria and hematuria also may be present. Bacteriuria and an elevated urine leukocyte count may occur if urinary tract infection is the underlying cause for the development of endotoxemia. In these cases, urine culture and sensitivity testing are indicated to aid appropriate antimicrobial therapy.",

Examples are removal of devitalized sections of bowel or infected umbilical remnants, drainage of infected pleural or peritoneal fluid, and gastric lavage followed by administration of mineral oil and/or activated charcoal in cases of grain overload to prevent further absorption of endotoxin. One must address any septic process with appropriate antimicrobial therapy. Initially, broad-spectrum coverage of the most likely organisms is recommended; one then should specify therapy according to results of culture and sensitivity testing. Sepsis in foals is caused predominantly by gram-negative organisms, of which E. coli, Actinobacillus spp., Klebsiella spp., Salmonella spp. and Pasteurella spp. frequently are identified. 108 The reader is referred to other texts for review of general principles of antimicrobial therapy. Regarding endotoxemia specifically, antimicrobial therapy has been suggested to increase the amount of circulating endotoxin by inducing endotoxin release on cell death of gram-negative bacteria. A recent in vitro study compared endotoxin release and inflammatory mediator activity between antimicrobials commonly used to treat E. coli septicemia in foals and specifically evaluated amikacin, ampicillin, amikacin plus ampicillin, ceftiofur, and imipenem. Although these antimicrobials showed no difference in the ability to kill bacteria, amikacin and the amikacin/ampicillin combination resulted in the lowest and ceftiofur in the greatest release of endotoxin. Endotoxin release appeared to be dose-dependent in that lesser amounts were released at higher antimicrobial concentrations. 109 Based on these results and clinical experience, combining antimicrobial therapy with endotoxin-binding agents such as polymyxin B may be beneficial, especially when using \u03b2-lactam antimicrobials.",

Many conditions responsible for the development of endotoxemia in horses, however, are associated with an ongoing release of endotoxin. Examples include severe gastrointestinal inflammation as in proximal enteritis or colitis, grain overload, or uncontrolled sepsis. Therapy directed against endotoxin itself may be able to interrupt the continuous activation of the inflammatory cascade in these cases. Further benefits of antiendotoxin treatment may be derived if large amounts of endotoxin have been released before the inciting cause can be addressed.",

            "text": "An important consideration regarding the efficacy of immunotherapy is the region of the lipopolysaccharide molecule against which antibodies are raised. The O-chain of lipopolysaccharide acts as a potent antigen on infection with gram-negative bacteria 6 ; however, antibodies directed against the O-chain are serotype specific and cannot afford significant cross-protection against heterologous bacterial strains. The core and lipid A region, both of which show a much higher degree of homology between lipopolysaccharide derived from different bacterial strains, offer a more promising target for immunotherapy. Active immunization against endotoxin has been reported for horses. Vaccination with a bacterin/ toxoid vaccine prepared from rough mutants of Salmonella typhimurium or S. enteritidis protected horses against homologous and heterologous endotoxin challenge 110, 111 and carbohydrate overload. 111 Despite these encouraging results and the current availability of a vaccine for use in horses (Endovac-Equi, Immvac Inc., Columbus, Missouri), active immunization against endotoxin does not appear to be a common practice. In comparison, passive immunization with antilipopolysaccharide antibodies is used widely. Rough bacterial mutants, most commonly J5 of E. coli O111:B4 and S. minnesota Re595, are used to immunize donor horses and subsequently prepare serum or plasma products. Proposed mechanisms of action after binding of the antibodies to lipopolysaccharide include steric blockade of lipid A interaction with cellular receptors and enhanced bacterial clearance by opsonization. [112] [113] [114] Studies concerning the efficacy of antibody administration in equine patients vary in their results. Beneficial effects have been described in experimental models of endotoxemia, acute gastrointestinal disease, and neonates with sepsis, 111, [115] [116] [117] whereas in other studies, antibodies failed to protect foals and horses against endotoxin effects. 118-120 Furthermore, administration of a S. typhimurium antiserum to foals was associated with an increased respiratory rate and higher serum activities of IL-6 and TNF. 118 Various equine serum and plasma products are currently commercially available. An antiserum raised against the lipopolysaccharide-core of S. typhimurium (Endoserum) is available for administration to endotoxemic horses at a recommended dose of 1.5 ml/kg body mass. Diluting the serum ten-to twentyfold in crystalloid intravenous solutions, administering it slowly over 1 to 2 hours, and monitoring the patient for adverse reactions is advisable. Although the product is marketed for use in foals with failure of passive transfer, adverse effects have been reported, 118 and one should use caution when administering it to neonates. Plasma from donors inoculated with J5 (E. coli) and S. typhimurium (Re mutant) is available under a restricted license (Polymune-J, Vet Dynamics, Inc., San Louis Obispo, California). The manufacturer recommends administration of at least 1 to 2 L in cases of endotoxemia. In addition, hyperimmune plasma, which has a guaranteed minimum immunoglobulin G content but does not contain specific antiendotoxin antibodies (Hi-Gamm Equi, Lake Immunogenics, Inc., Ontario, New York; Polymune and Polymune-Plus, Vet Dynamics, Inc.), is marketed for treatment of failure of passive transfer, and many clinicians use it to treat endotoxemia and sepsis. In addition to antibodies and protein, plasma contains active constituents such as complement components, fibronectin, clotting factors, and AT III 116 and therefore may be particularly useful in patients with endotoxemia-induced coagulopathy. Volumes of 2 to 10 ml/kg body mass of hyperimmune plasma have been recommended for use in endotoxemic patients. 56, 121 Polymyxin B Polymyxin B is a cationic polypeptide antibiotic that binds to the anionic lipid A portion of lipopolysaccharide and neutralizes its endotoxin capacity. 122 At dosages required for antimicrobial activity, polymyxin B carries the risk of respiratory paralysis and ototoxic, nephrotoxic, and neurotoxic side effects; however, a much lower dose is required for endotoxin-binding activity. The effects of polymyxin B in horses have been evaluated in different experimental models. 118, 122, 123 In an in vivo study in foals, treatment with polymyxin B at a dosage of 6000 U/kg body mass before infusion with S. typhimurium lipopolysaccharide resulted in significantly less severe elevations of body temperature, respiratory rate, and serum activities of TNF and IL-6 compared with untreated controls. 118 Similarly, polymyxin B treatment of adult horses given endotoxin significantly ameliorated clinical signs and decreased plasma TNF activity. 124 In the latter study, benefits of treatment were also evident at lower dosages of polymyxin B (1000 and 5000 U/kg body mass) and administration of polymyxin B 1 hour after the start of endotoxin infusion. Conversely, polymyxin B failed to ameliorate clinical signs of endotoxemia or prevent the development of coagulopathy, acidosis, lameness, and shock in experimental carbohydrate overload. 125 Side effects suggestive of neurotoxicity appeared after repeated administration of 5 mg/kg body mass (36,000 U/kg) and in milder form, 2.5 mg/kg body mass (18,000 U/kg) polymyxin B. Nephrotoxicity was not observed. Currently, use of polymyxin B in equine patients is recommended at dosages of 1000 to 5000 U/kg body mass every 8 to 12 hours. 126 One should initiate treatment as early in the disease process as possible, because the beneficial effects of lipopolysaccharide scavenging are limited to the first 24 to 48 hours after the onset of endotoxemia, before tolerance develops. Side effects in the form of neuromuscular blockade and apnea, which necessitate slow infusion of the drug in human patients, have not been observed in horses. One therefore can administer the entire dose as a slow bolus. If one uses polymyxin B in horses with hypovolemia, dehydration, or azotemia, one should attempt to improve peripheral tissue perfusion, minimize the polymyxin B dose, and closely monitor patients for nephrotoxicity. Close monitoring is also important if one administers medications such as aminoglycoside antibiotics, which share a similar spectrum of potential side effects, concurrently. Azotemic neonates have been reported to be more susceptible to the nephrotoxic effects of polymyxin B than adult horses. 124 In an attempt to decrease the risk for adverse effects while preserving lipopolysaccharide-neutralizing ability, a conjugate of polymyxin B with dextran has been developed. 127 In conjugated form, polymyxin B is prevented from extravasation into tissues, where it exerts toxic effects by interaction with cell membranes. In addition, conjugation increases the residence time of polymyxin B in the circulation and therefore should prolong the antiendotoxic effect. The polymyxin B-dextran combination was evaluated at a total dose of 5 mg/kg body mass of polymyxin B in 6.6 g/kg body mass dextran given 15 minutes before administration of endotoxin in horses. 128 Treatment was found to block the development of tachycardia, tachypnea, fever, and neutropenia completely and to prevent increases in serum concentrations of TNF, IL-6, TXB 2 (a TXA 2 metabolite), and the prostacyclin metabolite 6-keto-PGF 1\u03b1 . Although mild adverse effects in the form of tachypnea, sweating, and increased systolic blood pressure were observed, these were transient and could be prevented by pretreatment with ketoprofen. The polymyxin B-dextran combination is not commercially available at this time.",

Results of these studies are controversial, and detrimental effects occurred in some cases. 129 A protein receiving much attention regarding potential therapeutic efficacy is the bactericidal permeability-increasing protein (BPI). This protein is structurally similar to LBP but is expressed exclusively in myeloid precursors of polymorphonuclear leukocytes. 130 BPI is stored in primary granules of mature neutrophils and during inflammation is expressed on their cell membranes and secreted into the extracellular environment. 131 BPI has an even higher affinity for lipopolysaccharide than LBP 132 and shows antibacterial activity specific for gram-negative bacteria. 65 Binding of BPI to the gram-negative bacterial membrane results in growth arrest and is an important factor in the antibacterial activity of intact neutrophils. Furthermore, BPI binding disrupts normal membrane organization and makes bacteria more susceptible to hydrophobic substances, including antimicrobials. 133 Experimentally, recombinant BPI has been shown to protect against the toxic and lethal effects of isolated lipopolysaccharide and intact gram-negative bacteria, and clinical trials in human patients show promising results concerning its therapeutic use. 134 The biology and potential use of BPI in horses has not been evaluated.",

Nontoxic lipopolysaccharide or lipid A structures can act as endotoxin antagonists, if they competitively inhibit binding to LBP or cellular receptors or inhibit cellular activation by other mechanisms. Of the potential antagonists that have been evaluated experimentally, lipopolysaccharide and lipid A from the phototrophic bacterium Rhodobacter sphaeroides, and a synthetic compound (E5531) the structure of which is based on R. sphaeroides lipopolysaccharide, have been most promising. [135] [136] [137] [138] [139] Unfortunately, species differences exist regarding cellular response to these structures, and R. sphaeroides lipopolysaccharide acts as a potent inducer of cytokine expression in equine cells. 140 Based on results of receptor transfection studies in other species, 141,142 TLR4 is likely responsible for this phenotypic variation. Additional compounds including lipopolysaccharide derived from nitrogen-fixing plant bacteria of the species Rhizobium are being evaluated to reveal further insight into structural requirements for endotoxin antagonists in horses.",

The rationale for their use is inhibition of prostaglandin endoperoxide H synthase, that is, COX, and thereby inhibition of prostanoid production (see Figure 13 .7-5). Additional beneficial effects may include scavenging of oxygen-derived free radicals and iron chelation; however, side effects may occur at dosages required to achieve these effects. 143 Prostanoids have been identified as important mediators in the inflammatory response in a number of studies, and inhibition of their synthesis is associated with beneficial effects. Two COX isoforms are recognized: constitutively expressed COX-1 and inducible COX-2. Upregulation of COX-2 expression results from various proinflammatory stimuli, including lipopolysaccharide, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-1. 144 Constitutively expressed COX products are likely important for maintenance of homeostasis, whereas increased production of prostanoids by COX-2 is thought to be responsible for detrimental effects during inflammation and shock. Research has focused on the development of selective COX-2 inhibitors; however, none of these products are currently available for use in horses. In horses the most commonly used NSAID to treat endotoxemia is flunixin meglumine. Beneficial effects of flunixin meglumine have been described in experimental models of endotoxemia [145] [146] [147] and in clinical cases.",

[149] [150] [151] [152] NSAID use in horses carries the risk of side effects, most importantly the development of gastrointestinal ulceration and renal papillary necrosis (renal crest necrosis). In a study comparing the side effects of flunixin meglumine (1.1 mg/kg body mass), phenylbutazone (4.4 mg/kg body mass), and ketoprofen (2.2 mg/kg body mass) given 3 times daily for 12 days, lesions of the gastric glandular mucosa occurred most commonly. Phenylbutazone resulted in the most severe side effects, which included small intestinal edema, erosions, and ulcers in the large colon and decreased serum albumin concentration. Renal crest necrosis occurred more frequently in horses treated with phenylbutazone but also occurred with flunixin meglumine treatment. 153 Despite the higher risk of side effects, use of phenylbutazone has been suggested for certain cases. In colic patients, phenylbutazone may provide analgesia and ameliorate endotoxin-induced ileus without masking cardiovascular effects of endotoxin, which are used to determine the necessity of surgical exploration. 154 For similar reasons and to minimize side effects a reduced dose of flunixin meglumine (0.25 mg/kg body mass) has been suggested and is used widely in horses. 155 At this dosage, flunixin meglumine was shown to inhibit eicosanoid synthesis efficiently in an in vivo model of endotoxemia. 156 Reduction of clinical signs, however, was dose dependent, and therefore one should choose the appropriate dose based on the circumstances of each case.",

During periods of ischemia, tissue xanthine dehydrogenase is converted to xanthine oxidase, which on reperfusion catalyzes the generation of superoxide radicals. 167, 168 Evaluation in horses showed beneficial effects of 5 mg allopurinol per kilogram body mass administered 12 hours before endotoxin challenge. 169 In another study, mucosal damage attributable to oxygen-derived free radicals was not attenuated by allopurinol in an experimental ischemia-reperfusion model. 166",

Metabolism of \u03c9-3 fatty acids via the COX and lipoxygenase pathway leads to the production of 3-series prostaglandins and 5-series leukotrienes, which have less biologic activity than their 2-series and 4-series counterparts derived from arachidonic acid.

Patients with severe hypovolemia and shock may require higher fluid volumes. A viable alternative to large-volume resuscitation with isotonic fluids is the use of small volumes of hypertonic solutions, which transiently raise plasma osmolality, thereby causing a fluid shift from the interstitial space into the vasculature and rapidly restoring circulating volume. Hypertonic saline solution (7.5% sodium chloride) is the most commonly used hypertonic solution and has been shown to have beneficial effects in endotoxemic horses. 190 A dose of 4 ml/kg is recommended, which one should give as a bolus infusion over 10 to 15 minutes, followed by administration of an isotonic solution to restore total body fluid volume. One should use hypertonic saline with caution in patients with sodium and/or chloride derangements and should monitor serum electrolyte concentrations in the case of repeated administration.

One should address abnormalities in the coagulation profile as early as possible but especially if they persist more than 24 hours after initiation of therapy. Because of the complex interactions of coagulation and fibrinolysis during endotoxemia, one should combine anticoagulant therapy with the administration of fresh frozen plasma to replace clotting and fibrinolytic factors. Heparin acts as an anticoagulant by activation of AT III and subsequent inhibition of thrombin, release of tissue factor pathway inhibitor from endothelial cells, and inhibition of platelet aggregation. 201 Because endogenous AT III levels frequently are decreased in patients with coagulopathy, addition of heparin to fresh frozen plasma may be the most effective route of administration. An initial dose of 100 IU/kg body mass followed by 40 to 80 IU/kg body mass 3 times daily has been recommended. 121 Anemia caused by erythrocyte agglutination occurs in some patients during therapy with unfractionated heparin 202,203 but typically resolves within 96 hours if therapy is discontinued. 121 Because of the risk of microthrombosis associated with erythrocyte agglutination, use of low-molecular-weight heparin (50 IU/kg body mass subcutaneously every 24 hours) has been recommended 204 but may be cost-prohibitive.

Conditions commonly associated with the development of endotoxemia in horses are acute gastrointestinal diseases, especially of ischemic and severe inflammatory nature, and localized or generalized infections. Although measuring endotoxin concentrations in equine plasma is possible, this is not feasible in a clinical setting, and one typically reaches a diagnosis of endotoxemia based on clinical signs and clinicopathologic data. Successful treatment of endotoxemia requires resolution of the primary disease process in addition to neutralization of circulating endotoxin, interference with the activities of inflammatory mediators, and general supportive care. Newer treatments, such as blockade of endotoxin-interaction with cells or interruption of cell signaling pathways, are under investigation. Possible sequelae of endotoxemia include DIC, multiple organ failure, circulatory failure, and death. Frequently, the outcome of conditions associated with endotoxemia in horses depends on the severity of associated complications; for example, renal compromise, laminitis, and abortion. resting state the lateral margins of the vesicle, that is, the buccal mucosa, are in close contact with the cheek teeth.

The upper lip has a shallow median furrow (philtrum); the lower lip has a rounded prominence or chin (mentum). The internal surface is covered with a thick mucous membrane that contains small, pitted surfaces that are the openings of the ducts of the labial glands. Small folds of the mucous membrane called the frenula labii pass from the lips to the gum. The free border of the lip is dense and bears short, stiff hairs. The arteries of the mouth are derived from the maxillary, mandibular, labial, and sphenopalatine arteries of the major palatine artery. The veins drain chiefly to the lingual facial vein. Sensory nerves originate from the trigeminal nerve (cranial nerve V) and the motor nerves from the facial nerve (VII). The cheeks spread back from the lips and form both sides of the mouth and are attached to the alveolar borders of the bones of the jaws. The cheeks are composed of skin and muscular and glandular layers and then the internal mucous membrane. The skin is thin and pliable. In contrast, the oral mucous membrane is dense and in many areas of the oral cavity is attached firmly to the periosteum so that construction of oral mucosal flaps can be achieved only by horizontal division of the periosteal attachment. Such a feature is important in reconstructive techniques applied to the oral cavity. The blood supply to the cheeks comes from the facial and buccal arteries and the sensory nerves from the trigeminal and motor nerves from the facial nerve. The hard palate (palatum durum) is bounded rostrally and laterally by the alveolar arches and is continuous with the soft palate caudally. The hard palate has a central raphe that divides the surface into two equal portions. ",

Thus after a time the chewing surface displays a complicated pattern that may be likened to the outline of an ornate letter B, the upright stroke of the B being on the lingual aspect. Dentin supports the enamel internally, cementum supports the enamel lakes, and the peripheral cementum fills in the spaces between the teeth so that all six teeth may function as a single unit, that is, the dental arcade. Transverse ridges cross each tooth so that the whole maxillary arcade consists of a serrated edge. The serrations are formed so that a valley is present at the area of contact with adjacent teeth. These serrations match fitting serrations on the mandibular arcade.",

During this process, the rima glottidis closes and the epiglottis tilts dorsally and caudally to protect the airway so that food is swept through lateral food channels around the sides of the larynx into the laryngoesophagus. Fluoroscopic studies in nursing foals in the dorsoventral view showed that contact occurs between the lateral food channels in the midline so that in outline the food bolus achieves a bow tie shape. 4 Dysphagia is defined as a difficulty or inability to swallow. Anatomic classifications for dysphagia include prepharyngeal, pharyngeal, and esophageal (postpharyngeal) dysphagias. The site of the cause for dysphagia influences the clinical signs. Prepharyngeal dysphagia is characterized by dropping food (quidding) or water from the mouth, reluctance to chew, hypersalivation, or abnormalities in prehension. Pharyngeal and esophageal dysphagias are characterized by coughing; nasal discharge containing saliva, water, or food material; gagging; anxiousness; and neck extension during attempts to swallow. The following section describes esophageal dysphagia in more detail. Causes of dysphagia can be divided into four types: painful, muscular, neurologic, or obstructive (Table 13 .8-2). Pain and obstruction cause dysphagia by interfering with the mechanics of prehension, bolus formation and transfer to the pharynx, and deglutition. Muscular and neurologic causes of dysphagia impede prehension and swallowing by affecting the motor function of the lingual or buccal musculature, muscles of mastication (temporal and masseters), and pharyngeal and cranial esophageal muscles. Sensory loss to the lips, buccal mucous membranes, pharynx, or tongue also may cause dysphagia. Neurologic causes of dysphagia may affect the forebrain, brainstem, or peripheral nerves that control prehension (cranial nerves Vm, Vs, VII, and XII), transfer of the food bolus to the pharynx (cranial nerves Vs and XII) and swallowing (cranial nerves IX and X).",

One should avoid feeding roughage with long fiber length (hay or grass) to most horses with dysphagia. Dietary modifications that promote swallowing such as feeding slurries made from complete pelleted feeds may be sufficient to manage some cases of partial dysphagia. One must take care to prevent or avoid aspiration pneumonia in horses with pharyngeal or esophageal dysphagia. One can manage foals by feeding mare's milk or a suitable substitute through a nasogastric tube. One also may administer pellet slurries or formulated liquid diets via nasogastric tubes to older horses. Prolonged nutritional management of dysphagic horses may require extraoral feeding using a tube placed through an esophagostomy. 6 Formulated pelleted diets are often easy to administer through a tube as slurry and are balanced to meet the nutritional requirements for healthy horses. One must feed sufficient quantities to deliver adequate calories (16 to 17 Mcal/day for a 500-kg horse). Adjustments may be necessary for horses that are cachectic or have extra metabolic demand (such as pregnancy). Adding corn oil to the ration (1 cup every 12 or 24 hours) is a common method of increasing fed calories. Liquid diets also have been used for enteral feeding 7 but may not be tolerated as well as pelleted diets. Regardless of the method of nutritional management, one must monitor and replace salivary losses of electrolytes. Saliva contains high concentrations of Na, K, and Cl. A group of ponies with experimental esophagostomies 8 and a horse with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma 9 were fed a complete pelleted diet through esophagostomy tubes but developed metabolic acidosis, hyponatremia, and hypochloremia apparently because of salivary losses. Surprisingly, salivary losses of potassium did not result in hypokalemia in these cases, presumably because of replacement in the diet. However, if the diet is deficient in potassium, hypokalemia may result. One often can accomplish electrolyte replacement by adding NaCl and KCl to the diet. One can maintain horses for months with frequent feedings through an esophagostomy tube. 9 Parenteral nutrition (total or partial) may be useful in the short term but is not often feasible for long-term management.",

Wherever occlusal contact is ineffective, periodontal changes and calculus buildup occur; for example, the deposition of calculus on the canine teeth of mature geldings and stallions is common. Routine dental prophylaxis forms an important component of maintaining normal occlusal contact, and for this reason one should remove arcade irregularities that result in enamel point formation on the buccal edges of the maxillary cheek teeth and the lingual edges of the mandibular cheek teeth. One should remove these edges annually in horses that are at grass and twice yearly in young horses, aged horses, and stabled horses. Horses at grass have been shown to have a greater range of occlusal contact and therefore better periodontal hygiene than stabled horses. In stabled horses the range of occlusal contact is narrower and the formation of enamel points occurs more frequently with subsequent buccal ulceration and the initiation of a cycle of altered occlusal contact and hence irregular arcade formation.

The parotid gland is the largest of the salivary glands in the horse and is situated in the space between the ramus of the mandible and the wing of the atlas. The parotid duct is formed at the ventral part of the gland near the facial crest by the union of three or four smaller ducts. The duct leaves the gland above the linguofacial vein, crosses the tendon of the sternocephalicus muscle, and enters the mouth obliquely in the cheek opposite the third upper cheek tooth. The parotic duct orifice is small, but some dilation of the duct and a circular mucous fold (the parotid papillae) exist at this point. The mandibular gland is smaller than the parotid gland and extends from the atlantal fossa to the basihyoid bone. For the most part, the mandibular gland is covered by the parotid gland and by the lower jaw. The mandibular duct is formed by union of a number of small duct radicles that emerge along the concave edge of the gland and run rostral to the border of the mouth opposite the canine tooth. The orifice is at the end of a sublingual caruncle. The mandibular gland possesses serous, mucous, and mixed alveolar glandular components. The parotid gland is a compound alveolar serous gland. The parotid salivary gland can secrete saliva to yield rates of 50 ml/min, and a total daily parotid secretion can be as much as 12 L in a 500-kg horse. Parotid secretion only occurs during mastication, and administration of atropine or anesthesia of the oral mucosa can block secretion.

The clinical signs of sialolithiasis or other forms of ductule obstruction include a fluid swelling in the form of a mucocele proximal to the stone and occasionally inflammation of the parotid gland. Ultrasonography is useful to diagnose salivary mucoceles and to detect foreign bodies or sialoliths. Measurement of electrolyte concentrations in aspirates from suspected mucoceles might be helpful to distinguish them from hematomas. Salivary potassium and calcium concentrations are higher than plasma. Treatment may require surgical removal of the stone or plant material in the case of sialolithiasis or foreign body obstructions. Other causes of obstruction may require resection of the affected portion of the duct or chemical ablation of the gland. 20 Primary sialoadenitis is unusual but can occur in one or both glands. The condition is painful and may be associated with a fever and anorexia. Secondary sialoadenitis is more common and usually is associated with trauma. Infectious sialoadenitis from Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis 21 or other bacterial pathogens also may occur. Diagnosis is by physical examination and by finding an enlarged edematous parotid gland tissue on ultrasonographic examination.

Ingestion of the fungal toxin slaframine also causes hypersalivation in horses. 22 The fungus Rhizoctonia leguminicola, which produces slaframine, causes black patch disease in red clover. Slaframine is a parasympathomimetic compound that stimulates exocrine secretion in the parotid gland. Slaframine toxicosis most commonly occurs in the spring or early summer and rarely requires treatment other than removal from the pasture. Mowing removes the source in most cases because regrowth in pastures often has less fungal contamination. 23 15. The esophagus has no digestive or absorptive functions and serves as a conduit to the stomach for food, water, and salivary secretions. The esophageal mucosa is a keratinized stratified squamous epithelium. 1 The submucosa contains elastic fibers that contribute to the longitudinal folds of the esophagus and confer elasticity to the esophageal wall. A transition occurs in the muscle type composing the tunica muscularis from striated skeletal muscle in the proximal two thirds of the esophagus to smooth muscle in the distal third. In the proximal esophagus the skeletal muscle layers spiral across one another at angles. Within the smooth muscle layers of the distal esophagus the outer layer becomes more longitudinal, whereas the inner layer thickens and becomes circular.

Esophageal obstruction may be caused by primary impactions (simple choke) of roughage, particularly leafy alfalfa hay, coarse grass hay, bedding, and even grass. Prior esophageal trauma or poor mastication caused by dental abnormalities may predispose horses to primary esophageal impaction. 3 Wolfing or gulping food may precipitate primary impactions, particularly if the horse is exhausted or mildly dehydrated after a long ride or is weakened from chronic debilitation. Impactions also may result from disorders that physically impede the passage of food material and fluid by narrowing the luminal diameter, reduce the compliance of the esophageal wall, or alter the conformation of the esophageal wall such that food material accumulates in a pocket or diverticulum. Foreign bodies, intra-or extramural masses, or acquired or congenital anomalies cause these so-called secondary to provide critical information about the location and extent of the impaction and esophageal wall thickness and integrity. Ultrasonography may provide information about the cause. 13 Radiographic assessment of the esophagus can confirm the presence of esophageal obstruction in cases in which one cannot view the affected area adequately using endoscopy. One can detect impacted food material in the esophagus by a typical granular pattern and often can observe gas accumulation proximal to the obstruction. Air or barium contrast radiographic studies are most useful for evaluating the esophagus following relief of the impaction if one suspects a stricture. One often can detect esophageal dilation, diverticula, rupture, functional disorder (megaesophagus), or luminal narrowing caused by extraluminal compression more easily using contrast radiographic studies instead of endoscopy ( Figure 13 .9-2). 14-16 One should take care when interpreting radiographic studies in sedated horses, particularly after passage of a nasogastric tube or other esophageal manipulations that may contribute to esophageal dilation. 17",

Parenteral administration of acepromazine (0.05 mg/kg intravenously), xylazine (0.25 to 0.5 mg/kg intravenously) or detomidine (0.01 to 0.02 mg/kg intravenously), oxytocin (0.11 to 0.22 IU/kg intramuscularly), and/or esophageal instillation of lidocaine (30 to 60 ml of 1% lidocaine) may reduce esophageal spasms caused by pain or may decrease esophageal tone. [17] [18] [19] [20] Some clinicians advocate parasympatholytic drugs such as atropine (0.02 mg/kg intravenously) to reduce salivary secretions and lessen the risk of aspiration. However, undesirable effects of atropine including excessive drying of the impaction and inhibition of distal gastrointestinal motility may preclude its use. Resolution of an impaction may require physical dispersal of the material. 18 One can use a nasogastric tube to displace the impacted material along with external massage if the obstruction is in the cervical region. Often, carefully lavaging the esophagus with water via an uncuffed or a cuffed nasogastric tube while the head is lowered is necessary to aid in breaking up the impaction. Some clinicians advocate a dual tube method whereby a tube is placed through each nasal passage into the esophagus for ingress and egress of the lavage fluid. Because of the risk of aspiration of water and food material, esophageal lavage sometimes is done under general anesthesia with a cuffed nasotracheal tube.",

Although megaesophagus in horses most commonly is acquired, reports indicate idiopathic megaesophagus in young horses may be congenital. [28] [29] [30] [31] Acquired megaesophagus in horses may be a consequence of chronic or recurrent esophageal obstruction. 3, 7 Esophageal impactions of a short duration cause a proximal dilation of the esophagus that is generally reversible. 14 However, if the duration of the obstruction is long enough, the motility of the esophagus proximal to the site of obstruction may be impaired permanently. Other causes of acquired megaesophagus include extraesophageal obstruction by tumors or abscesses, pleuropneumonia, and vascular ring anomalies. 3, 8 Acquired megaesophagus also may result from neurologic, neuromuscular, and muscular disorders. Neurologic diseases that cause vagal neuropathy-such as equine protozoal myeloencephalitis, equine herpesvirus myeloencephalitis, and idiopathic vagal neuropathy-have been associated with megaesophagus in horses. Pleuropneumonia may be associated with a vagal neuropathy resulting in megaesophagus. Megaesophagus is an early sign of equine dysautonomia 32 and may be observable in patients with botulism. Myasthenia gravis is a well-known cause of megaesophagus in nonequine species but has not been reported in horses. Also in other species, electrolyte disorders, cachexia, primary myopathies, myositis, and Addison's disease may affect esophageal motility but have not been associated with megaesophagus in horses. One can induce iatrogenic megaesophagus by the \u03b1 2adrenergic agonist detomidine, but this is transient and reversible. 17, 33 Nonetheless, the use of this drug may complicate clinical evaluation of esophageal motility.",

However, one has to perform the procedure frequently to have any success, and horses do not tolerate it well. 36 Alternatively, a number of surgical techniques have been used to resolve strictures, including resection and anastomosis, 38,39 temporary esophagostomy with fenestration of the stricture, 37 esophagomyotomy for strictures of the muscularis and adventitia, 40, 41 or patch grafting with local musculature. 42 However, such surgeries are fraught with complications, largely because of the propensity of the traumatized esophagus to restricture. 3, 35 The esophagus lacks a serosal layer and does not rapidly form a fibrin seal as does the remainder of the intestinal tract, so anastomoses tend to leak. 38 In addition, tension on the esophagus during swallowing and movement of the neck impairs healing of anastomoses. 37, 39 In spite of these difficulties, the long-term prognosis for horses with chronic esophageal strictures treated surgically is better than for those treated nonsurgically. 3",

[43] [44] [45] A movable mass in the midcervical region may be noticeable before onset of complete obstruction. 36 Pulsion diverticula may be corrected surgically by inverting or resecting prolapsed mucosa and closing the defect in the wall of the esophagus. 10, 43, 45 Inversion of excessive mucosa may reduce the diameter of the esophageal lumen and predispose horses to esophageal obstruction and therefore should be reserved for small diverticula. 10",

Reported congenital abnormalities include congenital stenosis, 46 persistent right aortic arch, 8 esophageal duplication cysts, [47] [48] [49] intramural inclusion cysts, 9, 50 and idiopathic megaesophagus. 28, 30, 31 In the one report of congenital stenosis, double-contrast radiography revealed concentric narrowing of the thoracic esophagus in the absence of any vascular abnormalities at the base of the heart. Successful treatment included having the foal stand with the forelimbs elevated off the ground following each feeding. 46 Persistent right aortic arch is a congenital anomaly in which the right fourth aortic arch becomes the definitive aorta instead of the left aortic arch, which results in constriction of the esophagus by the ligamentum arteriosum as it extends between the anomalous right aorta and the left pulmonary artery. Clinical signs may include those associated with esophageal (postpharyngeal) dysphagia, drooling, and distention of the cervical esophagus resulting from partial obstruction of the thoracic esophagus. 8, 51 Endoscopic examination typically reveals dilation of the esophagus cranial to the obstruction SECTION 13.9 Esophageal Diseases with evidence of diffuse esophagitis. Successful surgical treatment of persistent right aortic arch has been reported in one foal. 51 Esophageal duplication cysts and intramural inclusion cysts cause typical signs of esophageal obstruction, including salivation, esophageal dysphagia, and swelling of the cervical esophagus as the cysts enlarge. 47, 49, 50 Such signs can make them difficult to differentiate from other forms of esophageal obstruction (choke). Endoscopic examination may reveal compression of the esophageal lumen and communication with the esophageal lumen if it exists. Ultrasonographic examination may be the most useful method of antemortem diagnosis if the cyst is in the cervical esophagus. Examination of an aspirate of the mass may aid in the diagnosis by revealing the presence of keratinized squamous cells. 47, 50 Surgical treatments have included complete surgical resection and surgical marsupialization. 47, 49, 50 The latter appears to be more successful and results in fewer complications. 49, 50 Complications of surgical resection have included laryngeal hemiplegia following surgical trauma to the recurrent laryngeal nerve in the region of the esophagus and esophageal fistula formation. 50",

Systemic inflammation associated with endotoxemia from septic cellulitis may occur. Closed perforations of the esophagus are particularly troublesome because food material, water, saliva, and air may migrate to the mediastinum and pleural space via fascial planes. 24, 52 Because of the leakage of air into the tissues surrounding the rupture, extensive subcutaneous and fascial emphysema frequently develops and is usually evident clinically and on cervical radiographs.

In addition, transient metabolic acidosis occurs because of salivary bicarbonate loss, followed by progressive metabolic alkalosis. 21 Although reports of esophageal wounds healing well by second intention exist, healing takes a prolonged time. 54 In addition, some perforations never completely heal and form permanent esophagocutaneous fistulae that may require surgical correction. The development of esophageal strictures is not common because wounds are usually linear and not circumferential. However, traction diverticula may develop. Other complications of esophageal wounds include Horner's syndrome and left laryngeal hemiplegia. 52 In a retrospective study on esophageal disorders, only 2 of 11 horses with esophageal perforations survived long-term 3 ; in a report of esophageal trauma following nasogastric intubation, 4 of 5 horses were euthanized. 24 The prognosis is therefore poor in horses with esophageal perforations, largely because of the extent of cellulitis, tissue necrosis, shock, and local wound complications. 14 ",

In severe cases, fullthickness ulceration can occur, resulting in perforation. The proximal (orad) portion of the equine stomach is lined by stratified squamous mucosa similar to the esophageal lining. The distal (aborad) portion of the stomach is lined with glandular mucosa, and the distinct junction between the two regions is deemed the margo plicatus. Ulceration can occur in either or both gastric regions, although different clinical syndromes and pathophysiologic mechanisms apply. As a result, the broad term equine gastric ulcer syndrome (EGUS) has been used to encompass the wide array of associated clinical syndromes. EGUS develops in horses of all ages and continues to be of major clinical and economical importance. 2",

The highest prevalence was found in Thoroughbreds (including Arabians) and Standardbred trotters, and cold-blooded horses were affected significantly less. Lesions were located most commonly in the squamous mucosa along the margo plicatus, followed by the glandular body, proximal squamous mucosa, and antrum. 10 Many studies investigating prevalence of gastric ulceration do not differentiate between squamous and glandular lesions or evaluate only squamous disease. In a recent study in which the gastric antrum and pylorus were evaluated in 162 horses in a hospital setting, 58% had antral or pyloric erosions or ulcerations, 58% had squamous mucosal lesions, and 8% had lesions involving the glandular body. 11 A correlation between the presence or severity of squamous disease and antral/pyloric disease was not identified.",

            "text": "An imbalance between inciting and protective factors in the mucosal environment can result in ulcer formation. 15, 16 The major intrinsic factors promoting ulcer formation include hydrochloric acid, bile acids, and pepsin, with hydrochloric acid being the predominant factor. Various intrinsic factors protect against ulcer formation such as the mucus-bicarbonate layer, maintenance of adequate mucosal blood flow, mucosal prostaglandin E 2 and epidermal growth factor production, and gastroduodenal motility. In human beings, extrinsic ulcerogenic factors include nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, Helicobacter pylori, stress, changes in diet, or gastrointestinal disorders, especially those resulting in delayed gastric emptying. 1 In human neonates, physiologic stress associated with a major primary illness seems to be associated strongly with gastric ulcers. 17 Many of the other factors mentioned previously are believed to be important in horses, but clear evidence of an infectious agent has not yet been identified in horses or foals with EGUS. 18, 19 Recently, the possibility of Helicobacter infection in horses has reemerged with the identification of polymerase chain reaction products from Urel, a protongated urea channel unique to gastric-dwelling Helicobacter species, in the squamous epithelium of three horses, two of which had squamous erosions. 20 The specific factors involved in injury and the protective mechanisms vary between regions of the proximal gastrointestinal tract. The pathophysiology of squamous mucosal ulceration in the horse appears similar to that in gastroesophageal reflux disease in human beings and ulceration of the nonglandular mucosa in pigs. Excess acid exposure is the predominant mechanism responsible for squamous mucosal ulceration, although many details remain unclear. 21 Hydrochloric acid is secreted by parietal cells in the gastric glands via a hydrogen-potassium adenosine triphosphatase (H + ,K + -ATPase) pump on the luminal side. Horses secrete acid continuously, and measured pH of equine gastric contents varies from less than 2 to greater than 6 depending on the dietary state of the horse (fed or fasted). 22,23 A protocol of repeated 24-hour periods of fasting and feeding has been shown to induce squamous erosion and ulceration. 24 Because this protocol results in periods of prolonged gastric acidity (pH <2.0) and because concurrent administration of the histamine 2 (H 2 ) receptor antagonist ranitidine reduces lesion severity, the protocol supports the role of acid exposure in the pathogenesis of squamous ulcer disease.",

In rabbit esophageal mucosa, bile salt absorption occurs and is correlated directly with mucosal barrier disruption. The unconjugated bile salts cholate and deoxycholate have a pK a (negative logarithm of the ionization constant of an acid) of 5 and 5.3, respectively, and therefore cannot remain in solution and cause mucosal damage in the presence of acid. Alternatively, the conjugated bile salt taurocholate (pK a 1.9) can cause mucosal injury in the ionized salt form at pH 7 or the un-ionized acid form at pH 1 to 2. 38 In the pig, bile salts or acid alone cause squamous mucosal damage, whereas a combination of the two result in extensive damage in vitro. 39 In the horse a similar synergistically damaging effect was found with the addition of bile salts and acid (pH 2.5) to stratified squamous mucosa in vitro in one study. 40 In addition, the investigators were able to document levels of bile salts and acid sufficient to cause mucosal damage in gastric contents within 14 hours of feed deprivation. This is not surprising, given that duodenogastric reflux occurs normally in the horse. 41 In a separate in vitro study of equine squamous mucosa, prolonged exposure to acid alone (pH 1.5) had a damaging effect, and synergism with exposure to a combination of acid and pepsin or taurocholate was not found. 42 The lack of synergism likely is caused by the lower pH used in this study and stresses the importance of acid exposure in squamous ulcer disease.",

Horses in race training have a high incidence of gastric ulceration and frequently are fed high-concentrate, low-roughage diets. In one study, higher volatile fatty acid (acetic, propionic, and isovaleric acid) concentrations, higher gastric juice pH, and lower number and severity of nonglandular ulceration were documented after feeding an alfalfa hay-grain diet compared with a bromegrass hay diet. 46 However, many factors differed between the diets, such as digestible energy, bulk, crude protein, and mineral content (especially calcium).

Further studies in this laboratory have provided support for this theory by demonstrating a high pH in the proximal stomach, immediately distal to the lower esophageal sphincter, during resting conditions that decreases during treadmill exercise (M.

Therefore a resultant decrease in glandular mucosal protection, most notably via decreased mucosal blood flow and mucus production, is the most likely mechanism of action.

Clinical signs of duodenal ulceration are similar to those described for gastric ulceration (bruxism, colic, salivation, diarrhea), but the consequences are often more severe. Lesions occur primarily in the proximal duodenum and range from diffuse inflammation to severe ulceration. Foals with duodenal ulceration often have delayed gastric emptying and may have gastroesophageal reflux. Complications can include gastric or duodenal rupture, duodenal stricture, and ascending cholangitis. Severe squamous and esophageal ulceration and aspiration pneumonia can occur following gastroesophageal reflux. 15, [55] [56] [57] [58] The gastroduodenal ulcer disease syndrome can occur in outbreaks and most commonly is identified in intensive breeding operations. The cause of duodenal lesions in foals is not known. One theory is that the problem begins with diffuse duodenal inflammation that can coalesce down to a focal area of ulceration (G.D. Lester and A.M. Merritt, personal communication, 2002) . A temporal relationship between gastroduodenal ulcer disease and rotaviral diarrhea has been suggested, but an infectious cause remains unproven. Although lesion location and severity associated with rotaviral infection varies among species, duodenal ulceration has not been reported. 59",

Diarrhea typically is not associated with gastric ulceration in adult horses, although ulceration can occur concurrently with other causes of diarrhea. Horses actively racing are more likely to have squamous ulceration than those solely in training. 4 Lesions occur predominantly in the squamous mucosa, particularly adjacent to the margo plicatus ( Figure 13.10-1) . In more severe cases, lesions can extend dorsally into the squamous fundus.

Shorter scopes permit examination of the gastric body and fundus, but not the pyloric antrum in most cases. One should use an endoscope with a maximum external diameter of 9 mm for neonatal foals. Numerous scoring systems for lesion severity have been described, but a recent consensus has been published by the Equine Gastric Ulcer Council (Table 13 .10-1). 2 Duodenal ulceration can be difficult to confirm. Duodenoscopy is the most specific means of diagnosis, although the procedure is more difficult than gastroscopy. Additionally, an endoscope at least 200 cm in length is needed for foals up to 5 to 7 months old, and a longer endoscope usually is required for older animals. Diffuse reddening or inflammation may be the only recognizable lesion in cases of early duodenal disease.",

Commonly recommended dosages are 20 to 30 mg/kg orally every 8 hours or 6.6 mg/kg intravenously every 6 hours for cimetidine and 6.6 mg/kg orally every 8 hours or 1.5 to 2 mg/kg intravenously every 6 hours for ranitidine. Famotidine has been used less extensively in the horse, but a dose of 10 to 15 mg/kg/day has been recommended. Because gastric perforation caused by glandular ulcer disease has been reported in hospitalized neonates, many clinicians routinely use prophylactic antiulcer therapy in this population. Although clinically normal foals respond predictably to ranitidine, 29 sick neonates have shown variability in pH response to intravenously administered ranitidine, with a much shorter duration of action and in some cases no noticeable response. 31 Thus currently used dosing schedules for hospitalized foals may be inadequate. Because some critically ill foals have a predominantly alkaline gastric pH profile and because gastric acidity may be protective against bacterial translocation in neonates, the need for prophylactic ulcer therapy is controversial. In critically ill human neonates, intravenous administration of ranitidine raises gastric pH and gastric bacterial colonization but does not increase the risk of sepsis. 64 In a retrospective study of 85 hospitalized foals less than 30 days of age, no difference in the frequency of gastric ulceration at necropsy was found between those foals that received prophylactic treatment for gastric ulcers and those that did not. 65 Because the study was retrospective, specific details regarding lesion location and severity were not available; however, none of the foals in the study died because of gastric ulcer disease.",

The mechanism of action likely involves adherence to ulcerated mucosa, stimulation of mucus secretion, enhanced prostaglandin E synthesis, and increased concentration of growth factor at the site of ulceration, although the prostaglandin effects may not play an important role in ulcer healing. 74 These are factors relevant to glandular mucosa, and the efficacy of sucralfate in treating ulcers in the equine gastric squamous mucosa remains undetermined. Sucralfate may be effective in preventing stress-induced ulcers in neonatal foals, because these occur in the glandular mucosa, although no clinical evidence directly supports this concept. In human beings, sucralfate provides protection against stress-induced ulcers with a decreased risk of pathogenic gastric colonization. 75 One should give sucralfate at a dosage of 10 to 20 mg/kg every 6 to 8 hours. The efficacy of sucralfate in an alkaline pH is controversial but appears likely. [76] [77] [78] Moreover, at the time of administration of an SECTION 13. 10 Diseases of the Stomach H 2 antagonist, the gastric pH likely will have returned to an acidic pH since the last dosage and will remain so for 30 to 60 minutes depending on the route of administration; thus one likely can administer the agents simultaneously if so desired.",

Time to development of gastric reflux is proportional to the distance to the intestinal segment involved, with duodenal obstruction resulting in reflux within 4 hours. 94 Clinical signs of gastric dilation include those associated with acute colic and in severe cases, ingesta appearing at the nares. Associated laboratory abnormalities include hemoconcentration, hypokalemia, and hypochloremia. 86 The most common reported cause of gastric rupture in horses varies between reports. In a retrospective study of 54 horses, gastric rupture occurred most commonly as a secondary phenomenon (65%), usually because of small intestinal obstruction, with primary gastric dilation and idiopathic rupture occurring almost equally (15% and 17%, respectively). 93 In another retrospective study of 50 horses in combination with a search of the Veterinary Medical Database (VMDB), 60% of the gastric rupture cases were classified as idiopathic. 95 Risk factors for gastric rupture include feeding grass hay, not feeding grain, gelding, and a nonautomatic water source. 93, 95 Nasogastric intubation does not preclude the possibility of gastric rupture, and the amount of reflux obtained before rupture varies greatly. 93 Because these reports were retrospective, one cannot rule out confounding factors with certainty.",

In horses with rupture caused by gastric dilation, tears in the seromuscular layer are frequently larger than the corresponding tears in the mucosal layer, indicating that the seromuscularis likely weakens and tears before the mucosa. 93, 95 In contrast, horses with gastric rupture following gastric ulceration usually demonstrate full-thickness tears of equal size in all layers. Gastric rupture is usually fatal because of widespread contamination of the peritoneal cavity, septic peritonitis, and septic shock. Initial clinical signs vary with the primary disease; however, when rupture occurs, a previously painful animal can exhibit signs of relief. Subsequent signs are consistent with peritonitis and shock, including tachypnea, tachycardia, sweating, and muscle fasciculations. Surgical repair is thus limited but has been reported for partial-thickness tears, 96 and in one case of a combined tear of the mucosa and muscularis with only a focal serosal tear, a full-thickness repair was performed with a favorable outcome. 97",

Although a specific cause is not always evident, ingestion of coarse roughage (straw bedding, poor-quality forage), foreign objects (rubber fencing material), and feed that may swell after ingestion or improper mastication (persimmon seeds, mesquite beans, wheat, barley, sugar beet pulp) have been implicated. Possible predisposing factors include poor dentition, poor mastication and rapid consumption of feedstuffs, and inadequate water consumption. Clinical signs can vary from anorexia and weight loss to those consistent with severe abdominal pain. In severe cases, spontaneous reflux may occur, with gastric contents visible at the nares. In cases of acute severe abdominal pain, one often makes a diagnosis during exploratory celiotomy. In animals not exhibiting signs of colic warranting surgical intervention, an endoscopic finding of a full stomach after a normally adequate fast (18 to 24 hours) often can confirm the diagnosis. Abdominal radiographs are reserved for smaller horses and ponies. In addition to pain management, specific treatment consists of gastric lavage via nasogastric intubation or massage and injection of fluid to soften the impaction during laparotomy.

Gastric distention is a common finding and is thought to be caused by hypersecretory mechanisms in the proximal small intestine and a functional ileus of affected enteric segments. The small intestine may be 5 to 7 cm in diameter because of fluid distention with malodorous, red to brown-red intralumenal fluid accumulation. Duodenal (and jejunal) serosal surfaces may have varying degrees and distribution of bright-red to dark-red petechial and ecchymotic hemorrhages and yellow to white streaks. The enteric mucosal surfaces are usually hyperemic and have varying degrees of petechiation and ulceration. Microscopically, the most severe lesions have been located in the duodenum and proximal jejunum but may extend proximally to the gastric mucosa and aborally to the large intestinal mucosa and submucosa. 3 Microscopic lesions consist of varying degrees of mucosal and submucosal hyperemia and edema. More severe lesions include villus degeneration with necrosis and more severely, sloughing of villous epithelium. The lamina propria, mucosa, and submucosa may have varying degrees of granulocyte infiltration (predominantly neutrophils), and the muscular layers and serosal surfaces contain small hemorrhages. Proximal small intestinal serosal fibrinopurulent exudate is a common finding in the more severe cases; therefore the term hemorrhagic fibrinonecrotic duodenitis-proximal jejunitis has been suggested as a more descriptive name for this syndrome.",

This reaction causes phosphorylation of specific protein kinases, which induce the actual mucosal membrane transport events. Increases in intracellular free calcium may arise from cyclic nucleotidedependent release of stored calcium within the cell or from increased calcium entry across the cell membrane. 7 Calcium may act through calmodulin, which then can activate membrane-phosphorylating protein kinases. The net effect is increased movement of sodium and chloride into the mucosal cell from the interstitium, with secretion of sodium and chloride into the intestinal lumen. Water follows the directional flux of sodium and chloride through highly permeable intercellular spaces. Several bacterial toxins and endogenous mediators can cause active secretion and contribute to a synergistic mucosal secretory response. Passive secretion of protein-rich fluid into the lumen occurs following damage to the mucosal epithelium, capillary endothelium, and submucosal inflammation in the proximal small intestine. The clinically relevant events that result from active and passive fluid secretion are proximal small intestinal distention and nasogastric reflux, dehydration, and circulatory shock.",

Administration of additional aliquots of 2 to 10 L of a balanced colloidal solution may be necessary if the DPJ crisis continues. In addition to albumin (the major colloid component), plasma contains other components that provide overall systemic support (e.g., fibronectins, complement inhibitors, elastase and proteinase inhibitors, antithrombin III).

Parenterally administered solutions containing glucose, balanced amino acid solutions, lipid emulsions, balanced electrolyte and trace minerals, and vitamins have been administered to adult horses with small intestinal ileus or enterocolitis. Based on a small number of horses, this therapy has proved promising in terms of minimizing protein losses and decreasing the duration of illness. Providing for part of the nutritional requirements of the horse (8000 to 12,000 kcal/day) is possible with glucose-amino acid solutions, which are of moderate cost. One may suppose reasonably that providing nutritional support to an anorectic, severely ill horse will facilitate the healing process and even shorten the duration of illness. Thus the overall cost of providing parenteral nutritional supplementation to horses with DPJ may well be offset by quicker recovery and diminished requirements for other, expensive treatments.",

For example, lidocaine infusion has several actions that may be beneficial in the treatment of ileus, including suppression of primary afferent firing, antiinflammatory properties, an observed analgesic effect, and direct stimulation of smooth muscle. 9 An infusion dose of 15 to 20 mg/min over 5 to 6 hours has been recommended.

Refractory cases have been observed to improve with surgical intervention; however, some horses with refractory DPJ have been observed to recover with supportive medical care alone even after 20 days of refluxing large amounts of fluid every 2 to 4 hours (personal observation). The decision of when to intervene surgically often is difficult. One may elect surgery to determine the extent of gross pathologic condition and intestinal distention and to perform intestinal bypass so as to direct enterogastric reflux toward the cecum and colon, where the fluid can be reabsorbed. Allen and Clark 5 have described two approaches for surgical therapy in such cases. A standing right flank laparotomy with resection of the last rib has been used to approach the duodenum and cecal base. Using this approach, one makes a small stoma between the duodenum and cecum using a handsewn 1.0-to 1.5-cm side-to-side anastomosis. The stoma may act as a shunt to decompress the proximal small intestine and deliver the small intestinal fluid to the cecum for reabsorption. Following recovery, the stoma likely will close.",

The chance that such a horse has an intestinal obstruction is too great to decide to treat it as if it may have DPJ. Surgery on such horses is not unusual, even though DPJ is possible, to rule out an obstruction. At present, the survival of horses with DPJ that undergo surgery is much greater than previously described, and certainly greater than that of horses with small intestinal obstruction that do not have surgery. Horses with DPJ that receive appropriate therapy have a reasonably good chance of making a full recovery. Horses that continue to have frequent episodes of voluminous nasogastric reflux and systemic signs of endotoxemia and septicemia have a poorer prognosis for recovery. Frequent complications of DPJ include laminitis, thrombophlebitis, and weight loss. The clinical signs of chronic wasting and poor body condition, although nonspecific for a diagnosis of malabsorption antemortem, can be attributed to proliferative or inflammatory intestinal disorders, often collectively referred to as chronic inflammatory bowel diseases. 1 Clinical signs include alimentary lymphosarcoma, granulomatous enteritis, multisystemic eosinophilic epitheliotropic disease (MEED), and lymphocyticplasmacytic enterocolitis-conditions affecting young and adult horses. Proliferative enterocolitis, 2 a transmissible disease of foals 3 to 7 months of age characterized by significant small intestinal pathologic changes, will be included in this group. However, several other primarily small intestinal conditions described from a morphologic perspective, such as chronic postinfarctive inflammation and mycobacterial infections, 3 will not be discussed. In addition, a single case of AA amyloid-associated gastroenteropathy in an 18-year-old Morgan stallion that had evidence of severe malabsorption based on poor D-xylose absorption is included. 4 For comparative purposes, Table 13 .12-1 lists the clinical and clinicopathologic features of the diseases, and Tables 13.12-2 and 13.12-3 present the gross morphologic and histopathologic findings, respectively. The extent of small intestinal disease is the key to determine whether one can demonstrate malabsorption based on abnormal carbohydrate absorption. As described in Chapter 13.4, this is not an all-or-nothing situation. In the same animal the staging of the pathologic changes differs in different regions of the small and large intestines, thus influencing severity of clinical signs and absorption findings. Furthermore, the extent of pathologic changes in different animals with ultimately the same morphologic diagnosis affects absorption studies and progress of the disease. Early diagnosis remains a challenge, and even multiple intestinal biopsies taken at exploratory laparotomy may prove unhelpful. By contrast, intestinal infiltration with the predominant cell types can be found in grossly normal appearing intestinal tissue.",

Prevalence is unknown. Despite the progressive nature of lymphomata, onset of clinical signs can be rapid and the animal may become acutely ill. As with all adult cases of chronic inflammatory bowel disease, antemortem diagnosis is by a process of exclusion and usually is confirmed post mortem. Frequently, the horse has anemia, thrombocytopenia, neutrophilia or neutropenia, hypoalbuminemia, normal serum protein or hyperproteinemia, and hypergammaglobulinemia. Lymphocytosis is rare. One may palpate intraabdominal masses, mainly enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes, rectally. Abdominocentesis has been of diagnostic value. Carbohydrate absorption tests usually reveal partial to total malabsorption indicative of the severely reduced surface area resulting from significant villous atrophy and the extensive mucosal or transmural infiltration. Rectal biopsy has aided diagnosis. Early confirmation of a suspected diagnosis necessitates exploratory laparotomy to obtain multiple intestinal and lymph node biopsies. In the future, markers of cancer cells may become available and may be cost-effective to aid diagnosis. Prognosis is poor. Natural progress of the disease is unknown.

            "text": "The chronic wasting condition granulomatous enteritis was first described in 1974 8 ; 9 of 10 horses were young Standardbreds. Most affected horses are 2 to 3 years of age. Case reports from many countries revealed a predominance of Standardbred over Thoroughbred horses by three to one. 9,10 Some of the Standardbreds were related, implicating a genetic predisposition. Prevalence is low. The condition is sporadic and has an insidious onset, and the course can be protracted. Significant diagnostic features include anemia, slight increases or decreases in white blood cell counts, hypoalbuminemia, normal serum protein or hypoproteinemia, occasional increases in serum alkaline phosphatase activity, normal serum \u03b3-glutamyltransferase activity, and enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes on rectal palpation. Reduced carbohydrate absorption to the level of partial to total malabsorption is reported frequently, consistent with the severe morphologic changes throughout the small intestine. One can attribute the low proportion of horses exhibiting diarrhea 9,10 to the preferential distribution of inflammatory infiltration in the small intestine, 11 with lesser involvement of the large intestine. Rectal biopsy can be a useful aid to diagnosis. 12 Treatment of horses with granulomatous enteritis with a variety of drugs, particularly corticosteroids, has not affected the outcome except in the short term. 13 One successful response has been reported. Prolonged corticosteroid administration produced clinical remission in a 6-year-old Standardbred gelding based on improvement in clinical signs and in D-xylose absorption. 14 Five months after cessation of approximately 5 months therapy, D-xylose absorption was normal and the horse was bright, alert, and resumed a level of athletic performance. Parenteral administration of dexamethasone sodium phosphate was tapered to achieve a minimal effective dose to reduce intestinal inflammation and abolish clinical signs. Adverse effects were not reported. The outcome of this single case is encouraging. Surgery may be indicated if the disease is localized. Two young horses underwent resection of the thickened terminal small intestine to confirm a diagnosis and provide a means of treatment; one horse died 4 months after surgery, and the other has remained clinically normal for at least 10 years. 10 The cause of granulomatous enteritis is unknown. Several infectious agents have been implicated, including Mycobacterium avium. 15 The condition may represent a granulomatous hypersensitivity reaction. Immunemediated responses to dietary, parasitic, or bacterial antigens may be important initiating factors. 1 Recently, six cases purported to represent granulomatous enteritis were linked to environmental contamination with aluminum. 16 Although the case definition was flawed and problems existed with the data and interpretation, 17 the report nevertheless raised the possibility that a toxicologic basis may exist for some equine inflammatory bowel disorders. lumen from parasitic, bacterial, or dietary sources. Infectious agents have not been identified. 18, 19 Widespread use of the avermectins has tended to reduce parasite loads and composition to favor small strongyles (cyathostomes). Eosinophilia is a feature of parasitism in the equine intestinal tract, although nematodes rarely have been identified in any lesions of MEED. 3, 18 However, failure to detect larval structures in these lesions may be attributable to chronicity of the disease and destruction of the parasites in tissue. 10 Biopsies of the rectal mucosa 12 or of the skin, liver, intestinal tract, and lymph nodes may assist in diagnosis. Treatment has been attempted with a variety of drugs, including antibiotics, corticosteroids, and anthelmintics with larvicidal activity. Immediate improvement has not been borne out in the long term. Prognosis is poor. The clinical objective is to reach a tentative diagnosis early in the course of the disease for intervention to be more than transient. Unlike the other conditions (see Table 13 .12-1), MEED has definitive liver and pancreatic involvement, and thus maldigestion may make a significant contribution to the wasting disease. For example, the lowered albumin and protein could result in part from impaired pancreatic enzyme digestion, and the effects of inflammatory lesions in the liver and ileum may decrease bile salt concentrations.",

Most affected horses are 2 to 4 years of age, and Standardbreds and Thoroughbred are reported to predominate. The condition is sporadic and has an insidious onset, and the course is protracted with a duration of 1 to 10 months. Diarrhea is common in contrast to granulomatous enteritis. Severe skin lesions with exudative dermatitis and ulcerative coronitis are prominent and frequently are the principal reason for veterinary attention being sought. Despite extensive tissue eosinophilia, systemic eosinophilia is rare. Hematologic values are usually unremarkable. Notable features include hypoalbuminemia and normal serum protein or hypoproteinemia, and because of liver involvement, serum \u03b3-glutamyltransferase and alkaline phosphatase activities may be increased. Most reports of carbohydrate absorption test findings (glucose or D-xylose) indicate retarded absorption and a reduced or normal peak concentration delayed to at least 180 minutes. One can interpret this pattern as the existence of sufficient small intestinal absorptive capacity to enable moderate absorption with possibly delayed gastric emptying or ileocecal ejection. Morphologic changes are less pronounced in the small intestine than in the large intestine, 9 and small intestinal lesions predominate segmentally in the proximal duodenum and distal ileum. Furthermore, significant hyperkeratosis of the fundic region may contribute to gastric muscle contractile disruption. Diarrhea can be a consequence of the severe segmental or multifocal granulomatous lesions in the large intestine with mucosal and transmural thickening and extensive ulceration. Abundant fibrosis is a feature of all affected tissues (see Table 13 .12-3).",

The disease is caused by Lawsonia intracellulare, an obligate intracellular bacterium found in the cytoplasm of proliferative crypt epithelial cells of the intestine. The condition in a foal was described first as intestinal adenomatosis, 24 because of similarity to the swine disorder of the same name. Later, molecular studies showed that intestines from an affected foal contained L. intracellulare sequences as determined by polymerase chain reaction analysis and confirmed by Southern blot hybridization. 25 Recently, studies of a cluster of affected foals on three breeding farms in Canada provided much information on the clinical syndrome, laboratory investigations, and response to treatment. 2 Two of the three farms bred Arabians, hence a demographic predominance of Arabian foals exists. Clinical signs included depression, rapid and significant weight loss, edema, diarrhea, and colic. Poor body condition, a rough hair coat, and potbelly appearance were common findings. Other problems often were concurrent, including respiratory tract infection, dermatitis, intestinal parasitism, and gastric ulceration. Significant laboratory findings were anemia, transient leucocytosis, hypoalbuminemia, hypoproteinemia, and elevated serum creatine kinase concentrations.",

Antemortem diagnosis relied on clinical signs, hypoproteinemia, and exclusion of common enteric infections. One can confirm diagnosis in live animals by fecal polymerase chain reaction analysis (positive in 6 of 18 foals tested) and serologic testing; 7 foals with proliferative enteropathy were evaluated serologically and had antibodies against Lawsonia intracellulare. 2 Treatment is effective. Most foals received erythromycin estolate (15 to 25 mg/kg per os every 6 to 8 hours), alone or with rifampin (7 to 10 mg/kg per os every 12 hours) for 2 to 4 weeks. Foals frequently needed supportive therapy at the outset for stabilization. Response to therapy has been excellent. 2 Rapid improvement in clinical signs even within 24 hours preceded the rise in plasma protein concentration. The source of the infection was undetermined. No apparent link existed between the three farms and a swine operation or solid and liquid waste disposal on pasture. However, one cannot exclude airborne spread of dried fecal material over distances. Comparisons of epidemiologic findings from the swine disease indicated that overcrowding, feed changes, antibiotic usage, and mixing and transportation were potential risk factors at two of the farms.",

Many of the clinical and clinicopathologic features are similar regardless of the cause. Severe dehydration with profound electrolyte abnormalities is common, as is systemic inflammation from absorption of endotoxin or other bacterial products through the compromised mucosa. Gastrointestinal protein loss may result in reduced colloid oncotic pressure from hypoproteinemia, leading to tissue edema. Colitis is a highly catabolic disorder, and weight loss may be rapid and severe. Some cases of colitis may be complicated by extensive mucosal ulceration, serosal inflammation, or mural ischemia/infarction extending from the inflammation or resulting from coagulopathies. Thus diagnostic measures aimed at determining the cause necessarily must be accompanied by clinical and laboratory assessment of hydration, electrolyte and acid-base balance, plasma protein concentration and colloid oncotic pressure, organ function, and evaluation of the degree of systemic inflammation and of the integrity of the intestinal wall.",

            "text": "Salmonella is a genus of gram-negative facultatively anaerobic bacteria that are common gastrointestinal pathogens in horses. Many serotypes of Salmonella have been reported to infect horses, but those classified in group B appear to be associated more commonly with disease than those in other groups. Group B includes S. typhimurium and S. agona, two of the species most frequently isolated from horses. 1-3 S. typhimurium is the most pathogenic serotype in horses and is associated with a higher case fatality rate than other species of Salmonella. 1 The number of horses that are infected inapparently with and actively shed Salmonella in their feces has been reported to be as high as 10% to 20%, but actual prevalence of Salmonella-shedding in the general horse population is likely to be much lower, less than 1% to 2%. 4 Horses shedding salmonellae are a potential source of infection to susceptible horses, 1,5 as are environmental reservoirs. [6] [7] [8] For these reasons, salmonellosis is one of the most common nosocomial diseases in horses. Nosocomial salmonellosis significantly affects morbidity and mortality in hospitalized horses. 9 The emergence of multidrug resistance in equine Salmonella isolates has been a cause of concern because of the importance of salmonellosis as a nosocomial disease and because Salmonella represents a significant zoonotic pathogen. 7, [10] [11] [12] The virulence of the bacteria varies tremendously with serotype and even among strains of the same serotype in part because of the important role of host susceptibility in the pathogenicity of particular organisms. The infective dose is generally millions of organisms inoculated orally, but various environmental and host factors can reduce the infective dose to a few thousand or even hundreds of organisms. [13] [14] [15] Environmental factors or stresses that increase susceptibility to Salmonella infection are not well defined, but high ambient temperature, for example, is known to increase the prevalence of salmonellosis in horses greatly. Indeed, the peak incidence of salmonellosis in horses occurs in late summer and fall. 6, 14, 15 Other environmental and host factors that increase the risk of Salmonella infection include transportation, antibiotic administration, gastrointestinal surgery, general anesthesia, preexisting gastrointestinal disease, change in diet, and immunosuppression. 1, 8, 15 Host factors that restrict gastrointestinal colonization and invasion by pathogens include gastric pH, commensal gastrointestinal flora, gastrointestinal motility, the mucosal barrier and mucosal immunity. 1, 16 Gastric acidity is an important defense mechanism preventing live organisms from reaching the intestine. Altering the gastric pH with histamine 2 receptor antagonists, for example, may increase susceptibility to infection. Gastrointestinal flora inhibits the proliferation and colonization of Salmonella by secreting bacteriocins, short-chain fatty acids, and other substances that are toxic to Salmonella. In addition, elements of the normal flora compete for nutrients and space, especially on the mucosa. 16 Being predominantly anaerobic, the normal flora maintain a low oxidationreduction potential in the environment of the large intestine, which inhibits the growth of many bacterial pathogens. 17 The importance of normal host gastrointestinal ecology is illustrated by the fact that disturbances of the colonic flora with antibiotics, changes in feed, ileus, or other underlying gastrointestinal disease greatly increase the susceptibility of the host to infection by Salmonella, often resulting in serious disease.",

            "text": "The immune status of the host may be one of the most important factors determining not only the susceptibility to Salmonella infections but also the degree of invasion and subsequent outcome of the infection. Local immunity, such as mucosal antibody secretion and enterocyte-derived cationic peptides, prevents colonization of the mucosa. 16, 18, 19 Opsonizing antibodies and activation of the complement cascade are important in fighting systemic invasion by Salmonella by increasing the efficiency of phagocytosis and by direct bactericidal activity. Humoral immunity, however, is often ineffective in preventing disease and dissemination once invasion occurs and Salmonella has established in its intracellular niche. Following invasion, Salmonella is capable of surviving and multiplying within macrophages, rendering humoral (noncellular) immune systems ineffective. 20, 21 Specific cellular immunity may be the most effective defense mechanism in the host arsenal against dissemination and systemic infection by Salmonella. 21, 22 Oral inoculation with small numbers of virulent organisms may induce protective immunity in horses and calves, but the duration of the immunity is not known. 23, 24 Oral and parenteral vaccines using killed or attenuated organisms and bacterial products have been promising but are effective only against homologous organisms and are usually not cross-protective among different serogroups. [23] [24] [25] In adult horses, Salmonella primarily infects the cecum and proximal colon, causing enterocolitis, and the ability to disseminate beyond the intestine and cause enteric fever is limited. In foals, however, salmonellosis often is associated with septicemia. The ability of Salmonella to cause enterocolitis depends on the ability of the bacteria to invade the gastrointestinal mucosa. 16, 20 Invasion of the gastrointestinal mucosa occurs preferentially through specialized enterocytes called M cells that overlay intestinal lymphoid tissues such as Peyer's patches in nonequine species. A variety of enteric pathogens exploit M cells during infection of intestinal tissue. 26 Invasion of the epithelium occurs by self-induced uptake via the apical membrane of the M cell, often killing the cell in the process. 20 Salmonellae then invade neighboring cells via the basolateral membrane, eventually spreading the destruction of the epithelium beyond the principle area of attack. Virulent salmonellae have a well-developed invasion mechanism involving generation of an apparatus called a type III secretory system that enables virulence gene products to be injected directly into enterocytes. 27 Virulence proteins injected by salmonellae into enterocytes engage the cellular machinery and induce the cell to engulf the bacteria by macropinocytosis. Salmonella virulence gene products also induce enterocyte chloride and fluid secretion and upregulate enterocyte transcription of inflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 and interleukin-1\u03b2) and chemokines that trigger a mucosal inflammatory response. 20, 27, 28 After salmonellae invade the mucosa, they are phagocytosed quickly by macrophages and dendritic cells in the lamina propria and lymphoid tissues. The ability of salmonellae to disseminate systemically and cause enteric fever is associated with the ability to survive and proliferate in macrophages. Indeed, phagocytes have an important role in dissemination of the pathogen to blood, lymph nodes, liver, and spleen. Most salmonellae in the blood and tissues of infected animals that are competent to cause enteric fever are within phagocytic cells. 29 In adult horses with salmonellosis, dissemination appears to be limited to the intestine and mesenteric lymph nodes, and Salmonella rarely is cultured from blood. However, in foals and in some adults, Salmonella causes an enteric feverlike disease with dissemination to mesenteric lymph nodes, liver, spleen, and blood.",

Products of these activated leukocytes, including prostaglandins, leukotrienes, reactive oxygen metabolites, and histamine, are potent stimulators of chloride secretion in the colon of many species. 16, [37] [38] [39] The enteric nervous system integrates the diverse processes of pathogen recognition, triggering of the inflammatory response, and induction of enterocyte fluid secretion. 39 Many of the inflammatory mediators studied stimulate colonic secretion by prostaglandin-dependent mechanisms, resulting in increased intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate or calcium concentrations or both in mucosal cells. 37 In addition, these mediators and the enteric nervous system may stimulate secretion by prostaglandin-independent mechanisms, inhibit sodium and water absorption, cause motility disturbances, and potentiate tissue injury, all of which enhance the pathogenicity and dissemination of Salmonella and contribute to the pathogenesis of diarrhea. 37, 39 Neutrophils recruited to the mucosa by signals generated by the infected enterocytes physically contribute to mucosal injury by producing a variety of products that are lethal to pathogens but are also toxic to host cells. 40, 41 Moreover, neutrophils attracted to infected epithelial cells accumulate beneath the monolayer, lifting it off the basement membrane in sheets. Neutrophils also migrate across the epithelial monolayer in potentially massive numbers. Transepithelial migration of neutrophils increases the permeability to macromolecules, bacterial products, and even bacteria. 41 Potentially massive losses of electrolytes, water, and protein can occur depending on bacterial and host factors. Perhaps most devastatingly, mucosal injury and altered permeability allow systemic absorption of bacterial products and dissemination of bacteria, resulting in systemic inflammatory responses such as occur with endotoxemia and septicemia.",

            "text": "Four syndromes of Salmonella infection have been described clinically and reproduced experimentally in horses: (1) inapparent infections with latent or active carrier states; (2) depression, fever, anorexia, and neutropenia without diarrhea or colic; (3) fulminant or peracute enterocolitis with diarrhea; and (4) septicemia (enteric fever) with or without diarrhea. Inapparent infections can be activated to clinical disease in compromised horses, such as horses with colic or horses being treated with antibiotics, causing mild to severe enterocolitis. In addition, latent infections (nonshedding) can become active infections (shedding) under certain conditions, such as transportation stress and antibiotic treatment. Horses with depression, anorexia, fever, and neutropenia without diarrhea generally have a good prognosis and recover in several days without specific treatment. 42 The septicemic form is restricted mostly to neonatal foals and is uncommon in adult horses. This discussion focuses on acute enterocolitis. Acute enterocolitis is characterized by severe fibrinonecrotic typhlocolitis, with interstitial edema and variable degrees of intramural vascular thrombosis that may progress to infarction. 1 Severe ulceration of the large intestinal mucosa may occur with serosal ecchymoses and congestion. The earliest signs of enterocolitis are usually fever and anorexia. 1, 15 Signs of colic may be apparent early in the course of the disease, especially if ileus is present. Clinical signs of endotoxemia are common and range from fever, elevated heart and respiratory rates, poor peripheral perfusion, and ileus to fulminant and rapidly progressive signs of endotoxemic shock. Oral mucous membranes are often pale with perigingival hyperemia (a toxic rim) but may be brick red or cyanotic, with prolonged capillary refill time. One may note weakness, muscle fasciculations, cold extremities, and other signs suggestive of hypotensive shock; synchronous diaphragmatic flutter; abdominal pain; and significant metabolic and electrolyte abnormalities in severe cases of enterocolitis. One also may note signs of mild dehydration before diarrhea is apparent. Once diarrhea is evident, dehydration may become severe rapidly. Occasionally, horses die peracutely, without developing diarrhea.",

[48] [49] [50] [51] The disease is most common from late summer to early fall, with a peak incidence in July and August. Potomac horse fever was described first in the Northeast but since has been diagnosed in most areas of the continental United States, with a particularly high prevalence in the Northeast and Midwest. The geographic distribution is characterized by a significantly higher percentage of cases found along waterways and rivers. 48, 49 The disease occurs sporadically, temporally and geographically, and can affect any age group of horses. The case fatality rate is 5% to 30%. 48 Transmission of N. risticii has been reproduced experimentally by oral, intramuscular, intradermal, subcutaneous, and intravenous routes. 48, 52 However, the natural route of infection has remained a mystery until recently. The epidemiologic data, the fact that many other rickettsial diseases are transmitted by insect vectors, and the finding that the disease can be transmitted via whole blood have implicated insect vectors in the natural transmission of the organism. Attempts to transmit the disease experimentally with ticks (Dermacentor variablis) or biting flies (Stomoxys calcitrans) have been unsuccessful. 53, 54 Recently, N. risticii has been found to infect virgulate cercariae larval stages of trematodes that use operculate freshwater snails (Juga spp.) as part of their life cycle in northern California. 55 Infected virgulate cercariae have been identified in aquatic snails collected in other parts of the country as well. Virgulate cercariae are part of the life cycle of trematodes that are common parasites of many species and use freshwater snails and aquatic insects as intermediate hosts. Although the trematode species infected with N. risticii remains to be identified definitively, at least two species are considered potential vectors. 52 During the trematode life cycle, aquatic snails release large numbers of infected cercariae into water, where they seek their next intermediate host.",

            "text": "Infected metacercaria have been identified in a variety of aquatic insects. 56 Preliminary studies suggest that N. risticii in fact may be transmitted via ingestion of mature caddis flies containing infected metacercariae. 57 Possibly horses are infected by drinking water containing infected cercaria released from snails or by ingesting infected metacercariae in other aquatic insects. 52 The number of PCR-positive snails in endemic regions corresponds to the seasonal incidence of Potomac horse fever and may be as high as 26%. 58 The pathogenesis of N. risticii is not understood completely. The organism infects and survives in monocytes and monocyte-derived leukocytes and can be found in blood monocytes during natural infections, but the sequence of events resulting in enterocolitis remains speculative. The organism appears first to infect blood monocytes in experimentally infected horses, which may be the vehicle of organ infection. 50, 59 However, in naturally infected horses, whether leukocytes of monocytic lineage or epithelial cells are infected first is unclear. The target organ is the gastrointestinal mucosa, with the most severe lesions found in the large intestine. 59, 60 Infection of human colonic cells in vitro does not cause major cytopathologic effects for several days. Disruption of the microvilli in the region of the plasma membrane where sodium chloride channels are located has been observed in human colonic cell cultures. 61 Infection in horses is associated with variable degrees of morphologic damage. 59, 60 Mild morphologic damage and mononuclear cell infiltration of the lamina propria occur early during the infection, but fibrinous, necrotizing typhlocolitis with severe mucosal ulceration and inflammation of the lamina propria may occur later in the disease. Vasculitis and intravascular coagulation are consistent features in the large intestine, with perivascular edema. 60 One can observe N. risticii in mucosal cells and macrophages and mast cells of the lamina propria. 59,60 N. risticii can survive and multiply in macrophages by inhibiting the production of reactive oxygen intermediates and by avoiding lysosomal digestion by blocking phagosome-lysosome fusion. [62] [63] [64] Evidence of impaired sodium chloride absorption in the colon has been suggested to contribute to diarrhea in infected horses and may be related to destruction of the enterocyte membrane structure in the region of sodium chloride channels. 61, 65 Direct injury to the mucosa by N. risticii and colonic inflammation are likely to be prominent features leading to diarrhea, especially later in the disease. 60 Fluid, protein, and electrolyte loss likely is caused by mucosal injury and effects on enterocyte fluid secretion caused by the inflammatory response. Like other inflammatory conditions of the colon, systemic inflammation caused by absorption of bacteria and bacterial products is a potential complication of N. risticii infections if mucosal injury is severe, which contributes to the clinical signs seen during the disease.",

Neutropenia with a left shift is a consistent feature and occurs concurrently with or soon after the onset of diarrhea. Thrombocytopenia is common and often severe. 67 Neutrophilic leukocytosis occurs later in the course of the disease. Hyperfibrinogenemia is usually more pronounced than that with salmonellosis. Serum electrolyte, acid-base, and biochemical abnormalities are also similar to those described for salmonellosis. Coagulopathies are common during N. risticii infection and reflect activation of coagulation pathways. Disseminated intravascular coagulation is common and may be related to the high frequency of laminitis associated with N. risticii infection. 70 One cannot base diagnosis of N. risticii infection solely on clinical signs because the disease is clinically similar to other forms of enterocolitis. However, in endemic areas, acute colitis is likely to be caused by N. risiticii, and thus the clinical signs of acute inflammatory colitis in fact may have a high predictive value. Serologic evidence of infection, such as rising antibody titers to N. risticii detected by indirect immunofluorescence or enzymelinked immunosorbent assay in paired serum samples may be helpful in establishing a diagnosis. 49, 71 One should take care when interpreting the indirect immunofluorescence serologic test for N. risticii because the test appears to have a high false-positive rate. 72 Culture of the organism from blood is possible but is difficult and is generally useful only in the research laboratory. Recently developed polymerase chain PCR tests for N. risticii DNA are rapid, highly sensitive (as sensitive as culture), and specific for N. risticii infection and can be applied to blood or feces. [73] [74] [75] Prevention Prevention of the disease by reducing exposure to the causative organism is difficult because the mode of transmission is not known. A killed vaccine has been developed that is effective in preventing clinical illness other than fever in 80% of experimentally challenged horses using the vaccine strain. However, field studies suggest the vaccine has limited benefit for prevention or decreasing the severity of natural infection. Vaccine failures have been attributed to strain differences in antigenicity or to poor antibody responses to the vaccine. 76, 77 ",

However, clostridia inhabiting the gastrointestinal tract normally are found in low numbers and do not produce enterotoxins. Clostridiosis is associated with an increase in the number of a particular species of clostridia in the gastrointestinal tract and, perhaps most importantly, exotoxin production. Although the conditions resulting in exotoxin production are not understood fully, several factors increase clostridial numbers in the gastrointestinal tract. Dietary factors are known to affect the numbers of Clostridium species shed in the horse feces. 78 Experimental induction of colic increases fecal shedding of Clostridium species in the absence of diarrhea. 86 Antibiotics, particularly administered orally or recycled via the enterohepatic system, are well documented to increase the recovery of clostridia colony-forming units (CFUs) in equine feces and may result in clinical clostridiosis. 79, 81, [87] [88] [89] [90] Indeed, clostridiosis associated with C. perfringens or C. difficile is likely to be the most important cause of antibiotic-induced enterocolitis in the horse. Clostridium perfringens C. perfringens is made up of many genetically distinct strains of variable virulence that produce one or more of a large group of exotoxins. The pattern of exotoxin production is used to classify C. perfringens into five types, A, B, C, D, and E. C. perfringens type A is the most common clostridium isolate from healthy horses of all ages and adults and foals with diarrhea worldwide. C. perfringens types A, B, C, and D have been associated with hemorrhagic enteritis in foals less than 10 days of age, with type C being the most common cause in North America.",

            "text": "Virulent strains of C. perfringens type A and to a lesser extent type C also may produce enterotoxin. Enterotoxin is a cytotoxin that inserts into cell membranes to form pores, which alter permeability to water and macromolecules and ultimately lead to cellular necrosis. 96 Massive desquamation of the intestinal mucosa resulting from enterotoxin cytotoxicity triggers an inflammatory response, intestinal edema, mural hemorrhage, and systemic inflammation. 97 Enterotoxin also alters tight junction integrity, resulting in increased paracellular permeability by a noncytotoxic mechanism. 98 Clostridium difficile C. difficile produces several toxins, but only two, toxin A and toxin B have been studied in detail. Toxin B is a potent cytotoxin in vitro, but its role in enterocolitis is less clear than the role of toxin A. Toxin B does not induce fluid secretion, inflammation, or characteristic alterations in intestinal morphology. C. difficile induces an inflammatory response with hypersecretory diarrhea that is induced in large part by the enterotoxin toxin A. 99 Toxin A induces neutrophil influx into intestinal tissue, mast cell degranulation, and secretion of prostaglandins, histamine, cytokines, and 5-hydroxytryptamine by these activated leukocytes. 100, 101 The products of neutrophils and mast cells have a prominent role in the vasodilatory and secretory responses in the intestine during C. difficile infection. The enteric nervous system is central to the induction of intestinal inflammation and mucosal secretion by toxin A. A model for toxin A-induced secretory diarrhea has emerged in which toxin A stimulates substance P-containing afferent sensory nerve fibers, which in turn stimulate mast cell degranulation, recruitment and activation of polymorphonuclear leukocytes, and vasodilation. [102] [103] [104] Toxin A-induced stimulation of enterocyte secretion can occur via secretomotor neuronal stimulation by substance P-containing sensory neurons or products of mast cells and polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Neural blockade or depletion of substance P abolishes mast cell degranulation, polymorphonuclear leukocyte influx, and enterocyte secretion. How toxin A triggers the sensory component of the enteric nervous system is not known yet, but toxin A-induced necrosis of enterocytes likely exposes afferent neurons to the noxious milieu of the intestinal contents.",

Similar criteria are used to screen human patients for C. perfringens type A infection. Normal horses shed fewer than 100 CFUs/g of feces, and usually horses with intestinal clostridiosis shed greater than 1 \u00d7 10 6 CFUs/g. 78, 105 However, identification of increased numbers of Clostridium organisms in the feces does not prove infection. Detection of C. perfringens toxins in feces or intestinal contents in horses with increased numbers of fecal CFUs and clinical signs of enterocolitis is more conclusive evidence of an enterotoxigenic infection than culture alone. Immunoassays are available that are primarily designed to detect C. perfringens enterotoxin. 83 However, the reliability (specificity) of some immunoassays for diagnosis of C. perfringens infection has come into question. Recently, PCR multiplex and gene probe assays have been developed to detect the major lethal toxins in isolates or fecal samples to determine the pattern or toxin production and are currently the preferred methods of detection. [106] [107] [108] As for C. perfringens, diagnosis of C. difficile infection consists of culture of the organism from feces and identification of toxins in the feces. Bacterial culture of C. difficile may be difficult and may be an insensitive test in horses. [109] [110] Detection may require enrichment techniques and culture of multiple fecal samples. 110, 111 Detection of toxins A and B in feces is regarded as the preferred test for diagnosis of C. difficile infection in human beings. 83 Commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays are available for toxins A and B that are specific and appear to be more sensitive than a single culture for identifying C. difficile infection in adult horses. 109, 110 One also may induce toxin production by C. difficile isolates. Sensitive PCR methods also have been developed for application to fecal samples and isolates to detect the genes for toxins A and B. 83",

            "text": "Proliferative enteropathy is a chronic hyperplastic disorder of the small intestine and has been described in a variety of mammalian and avian species. 112, 113 The only causative agent identified to date that induces proliferative enteropathy is the obligate intracellular pathogen Lawsonia intracellulare. 113, 114 The pig is the most frequently naturally affected species. However, the reports of equine proliferative enteropathy associated with L. intracellulare have increased in recent years. [115] [116] [117] [118] The relatedness of the strains of L. intracellulare causing proliferative enteropathy in pigs and horses or even among other affected species is not known. No host restriction is apparent because hamsters and other rodents can be infected with porcine strains of L. intracellulare. Before the year 2000, reports of proliferative enteropathy in the literature describing isolated cases were sporadic. [116] [117] [118] However, since 2000, outbreaks on breeding farms have been documented on farms in Canada, suggesting that a new strain has emerged. 115 The mode of infection is fecal-oral, and infected animals can shed large numbers of organisms in feces. 113 Affected animals shedding the organism in the feces serve as a source of infection for herdmates. Possibly nonequine species serve as reservoirs contributing to outbreaks on horse farms. Factors that increase the risk of proliferative enteropathy in pigs include overcrowding, ration changes, transport, and weaning. 113, 114 Like pigs, horses are affected as weanlings. Factors associated with weaning and other stresses may affect immunity and increase susceptibility to infection. The incubation period is 2 to 3 weeks in nonequine species and is presumed to be similar in horses.",

S. vulgaris infection in horses is manifested clinically by two forms: acute and chronic disease. 121 The age and resistance of the host, the infective dose, and the size and function of the affected arteries influence the type and degree of disease that occurs. Sudden ingestion of large numbers of infective larvae by a na\u00efve host causes acute strongylosis, whereas ingestion of fewer infective larvae over a long period of time by an older, more resistant host causes chronic strongylosis.

Interstitial edema and damage to the interstitial matrix and mucosa may result from inflammation and migration of the parasites, causing increased secretion of fluid and albumin loss. Abnormal gastrointestinal motility also may play a role in the development of diarrhea. Migration of larvae through the intestinal wall early in the course of infection affects myoelectric activity and motility in the large intestine and may affect retention of ingesta and absorption of fluid. 123,124 The cause of death in acute strongylosis has not been addressed but may be related to massive migration through the vasculature, causing thrombosis with ischemia and infarction of the intestine.",

Release of vasoconstrictive inflammatory mediators such as leukotrienes from platelets, neutrophils, and eosinophils and elaboration of parasitic antigens or toxins may cause vasoconstriction and ischemia. 126 Horses with experimental strongylosis were found to have a 50% reduction of blood flow in the colonic vasculature. 127 Clearly, reduced blood flow is an important effect of chronic strongylosis, but the relationship between blood flow and diarrhea is unclear. Disrupted motility resulting from ischemia may lead to diarrhea by reducing the retention of ingesta and absorption of fluid. Acute infarction and mucosal ulceration have been found to cause severe chronic diarrhea in naturally infected horses. 128 Release of inflammatory mediators such as prostaglandins, histamine, and kinins from inflammatory cells associated with thrombi and inflamed intestine also may affect secretion, absorption, and motility, leading to diarrhea.",

[133] [134] [135] [136] [137] [138] Clinical disease is caused by intramural larval stages. The cyathostome life cycle requires migration by fourth-stage larvae through the mucosa of the large intestine and may include a period of hypobiosis during which the larvae remain encysted within the mucosal layer of the large intestine. After a period of hypobiosis the larvae emerge in response to a largely unknown stimulus. Most cases occur when larval emergence takes place, classically in the late winter and spring in the northern temperate zones when larvae are expected to emerge and in the late fall or winter months in the southeastern United States and subtropical regions. 133 Sudden emergence of encysted larvae causes the mucosal injury, ulceration, and inflammatory reaction responsible in large part for the clinical disease. 133, 139 However, migration of the larvae as they penetrate the mucosa affects motility patterns and can cause inflammation that may contribute to diarrhea. 139 Chronic, eosinophilic, granulomatous colitis and diarrhea with histopathologic evidence of hypobiotic cyathostome larvae in the large intestine have been reported in two horses during a period in which emergence of larvae would not be expected to occur (early winter). 133 Natural emergence of cyathostome larvae causes fibrinous inflammation of the large intestine, focal necrosis, mural hemorrhage, and ulceration of the large intestinal mucosa, which even may result in bleeding into the lumen. Mild to moderate eosinophilic and mononuclear inflammation of the lamina propria occurs, and moderate to severe interstitial edema frequently occurs. 122, 139 Colonic inflammation and interstitial edema may contribute to the diarrhea, along with the loss of the mucosal barrier, by causing increased active and passive secretion of fluid, electrolytes, and protein. Protein loss is often significant, resulting in profound hypoalbuminemia and interstitial edema of skin and other organs. Chronic, granulomatous colitis has been reported to occur in response to encysted larvae and may cause diarrhea by increased secretion following granulomatous inflammation or disruption of the interstitium by granulomatous infiltration. Administration of an anthelmintic to horses with a heavy load of encysted larvae also may cause rapid larval death and acute and often severe inflammation similar to natural emergence.",

[133] [134] [135] [136] [137] [138] Profound hypoalbuminemia is a characteristic feature of cyathostomiasis, manifested clinically by ventral edema. Plasma \u03b1and \u03b2-globulin concentrations may be elevated, which can result in a normal total plasma protein concentration in spite of hypoalbuminemia. [134] [135] [136] The serum IgG(T) concentration, however, has been reported to be normal, which may help distinguish cyathostomiasis from S. vulgaris infection. 133, 135, 136 In addition, peritoneal fluid analysis does not usually reveal any abnormalities, in contrast to horses with S. vulgaris infection. Fecal analysis may be unrewarding because the infection is often not patent when clinical signs are apparent. Measurement of plasma fructosamine may provide a measure of protein catabolism or protein loss in the absence of hypoalbuminemia. Plasma fructosamine concentrations are significantly lower in horses with experimental cyathostomiasis than in normal controls, 142, 143 suggesting that this test may be a useful diagnostic tool. However, the test has not yet been validated in naturally occurring cases, and neither the specificity nor the sensitivity is known. Rectal scrapings or rectal mucosal biopsies may reveal evidence of cyathostome larvae. 133, 136 Definitive diagnosis usually requires microscopic examination of biopsy specimens of the cecum and ascending colon, collected by laparotomy. Examination of biopsy specimens collected from the small intestine is recommended to rule out other causes of weight loss and diarrhea. One should include appropriate diagnostic tests, such as culture of feces for pathogenic bacteria, in the workup to rule out other causes.",

            "text": "Clostridium perfringens, C. difficile, and Salmonella spp. are apparently the most common causes of antibioticassociated diarrhea in horses. Outbreaks of C. difficile have been reported in hospitalized horses being treated with antibiotics. 81, 85 In Sweden, accidental erythromycin ingestion has been associated with C. difficile enterocolitis in mares in which their foals were being treated for Rhodococcus equi. 89, 151, 153 Interestingly, this phenomenon has not been reported in other areas of the world. Foals being treated with erythromycin are at a higher risk for diarrhea than foals being treated with other antibiotics. Tetracycline administration has been shown to be associated with an increase in the numbers of gram-negative enteric bacteria and C. perfringens in the feces of horses and reactivation of salmonellosis and prolongation of fecal shedding of Salmonella. 78, 154 The most common mechanism by which antibiotics cause diarrhea is by disrupting the gastrointestinal flora. The normal large intestinal flora, comprised of mainly obligate anaerobes and streptococci, protects the host from pathogenic bacteria by colonization resistance. 17 Ecologic factors play an important role in colonization resistance. For example, surface bacteria in the large intestine interact with receptors on the mucosal cells, facilitating adherence to the mucosa. 17, 155 In doing so, the normal organisms compete more successfully for this important niche. Competition for space and nutrients is an important means of preventing colonization and proliferation of pathogenic bacteria. In addition, anaerobic bacteria produce short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and other metabolites that are toxic to facultative anaerobic bacteria, especially in the conditions of the large intestine. 16, 17, 155 Organisms of the normal flora also produce bacteriocins that inhibit growth of potential pathogens. 16 Antibiotics that deplete the population of obligate anaerobes and streptococci efficiently decrease colonization resistance. 16 Production of fatty acids diminishes, thus reducing competition for space and nutrients. As a result, gram-negative enteric bacteria such as Salmonella are able to proliferate. In addition, pathogenic anaerobes normally found in low numbers can proliferate. Antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria, especially gram-negative enteric bacteria and possibly clostridia, may be selected by antibiotic administration, allowing proliferation of pathogenic bacteria resistant to many antibiotics. 156 Obligate anaerobic commensal organisms, perhaps the most critical group of microbes for maintaining colonization resistance, are usually susceptible to macrolides, tetracyclines, \u03b2-lactams, and lincosamides, perhaps explaining the high incidence of diarrhea associated with the administration of these antibiotics. 83 In addition to reduction of colonization resistance, depletion of the normal anaerobic microbial population in the intestine decreases carbohydrate fermentation and production of SCFAs, which contributes to the pathogenesis of antibiotic-associated diarrhea by decreasing absorption of sodium and water by the colonic mucosa. 157 Ampicillin decreases colonic fermentation of carbohydrates in human beings. 158 Human patients with antibioticassociated diarrhea have greatly impaired colonic fermentation and low production of SCFAs. Erythromycin, ampicillin, or metronidazole treatment is associated with decreased production of SCFAs in patients with and without diarrhea. 88 Absorption of sodium and water is stimulated by absorption of SCFAs in the equine colon, suggesting that reduction of colonic SCFA content by antibiotic-induced depletion of anaerobic flora has similar effects in horses as in human beings. 157 Broad-spectrum antibiotics exert a more profound effect on the gastrointestinal flora than narrow-spectrum antibiotics. Antibiotics administered orally, especially those that are poorly absorbed, are more likely to cause diarrhea than are parenterally administered antibiotics. For instance, clindamycin is less likely to cause diarrhea in human beings when administered intravenously than when administered orally. Antibiotics with extensive enterohepatic circulation, such as tetracyclines and erythromycin, are excreted in high concentrations in the bile and are associated more commonly with diarrhea than antibiotics that do not undergo enterohepatic circulation. 159 Antibiotics may cause diarrhea by means other than by disrupting the normal flora. Direct toxic effects may play a role in producing irritation, increasing secretion, and disrupting motility patterns. Tetracyclines are irritating to the gastrointestinal mucosa and may cause inflammation and increase secretion. 159 Erythromycin has been shown to interact with smooth muscle cells, stimulating gastrointestinal motility. 159, 160 Normal peristalsis plays an important role in suppressing the population size of potentially pathogenic bacteria. Normally, bacteria that are prevented from adhering to the mucosa by colonization resistance are swept aborally by peristalsis and are excreted in the feces. Disruption of normal motility patterns may prevent clearance of pathogenic bacteria, contributing to the colonization of mucosal surfaces.",

The clinical syndrome of antibiotic-associated diarrhea can vary from mild diarrhea to fulminant enterocolitis with severe diarrhea. Mild cases of diarrhea are common, especially in foals receiving erythromycin, trimethoprim-sulfonamide combinations, or rifampin. 151, 161 Mild cases of diarrhea are usually not clinically significant. However, acute, severe enterocolitis can occur in all ages of horses receiving antibiotics and can be life threatening. Clinical signs are identical to other causes of acute enterocolitis. Severe, dehydrating diarrhea, endotoxemia, sepsis, and shock may occur. Hemoconcentration, neutropenia, hypoproteinemia, and electrolyte and acid-base imbalances are common. Severe hyponatremia may occur in foals with antibiotic-associated diarrhea, especially if trimethoprimsulfonamide and rifampin combinations are the cause. 161 More detailed descriptions of the clinical and laboratory findings were given previously. Diagnosis is presumptive, because definitive diagnosis of antibiotic-associated diarrhea is impossible. Fecal culture and PCR testing may reveal Salmonella or Clostridium infection.",

[162] [163] [164] [165] [166] [167] [168] In horses and human beings, NSAID toxicity is manifested by renal and gastrointestinal disease. Elderly human patients are more susceptible to NSAID toxicity, but the effects of age on NSAID toxicity in horses are less well defined. Foals are considered to be more susceptible than adult horses to gastrointestinal disease following NSAID administration, and ponies may be more susceptible than horses. All NSAIDs are capable of inducing gastrointestinal and renal damage at toxic concentrations, and the toxicity is not significantly different among products. Aspirin is potentially more toxic than other NSAIDs because it irreversibly inactivates cyclooxygenase by acetylation, whereas other NSAIDs reversibly inhibit cyclooxygenase. 162 However, phenylbutazone is the drug most commonly reported to cause toxicity in horses, perhaps because of its widespread use by veterinarians and horse owners. Phenylbutazone toxicity in horses is characterized by mucosal ulceration throughout the gastrointestinal tract, oral ulceration, renal papillary necrosis, vasculopathy, thrombosis, and protein-losing enteropathy with hypoalbuminemia. [164] [165] [166] This discussion focuses on the toxic effects of NSAIDs on the large intestine but necessarily includes elements of upper gastrointestinal and renal disease.",

            "text": "Gastrointestinal disease induced by NSAIDs is manifested by mucosal ulceration, inflammation, bleeding, and protein-losing enteropathy. 164, 165, 168, 170 In addition to direct effects on the mucosal barrier, NSAID administration has been shown to cause an acute relapse of preexisting colonic inflammatory disease and worsen colonic inflammation in human beings. 164, 165, 170 Whether this occurs in horses is not clear. The mechanism by which NSAIDs induce mucosal damage is probably multifactorial. Direct irritation may play a role in oral and gastric irritation and ulceration; however, parenteral administration of NSAIDs produces oral and gastric ulceration as well. Inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis by inhibition of cyclooxygenase 1 (the constitutive COX) and cyclooxygenase 2 (the inducible COX) appears to be the most important mechanism of mucosal injury. Prostaglandins, particularly PGE 2 and PGI 2 , are critical for mucosal health. 172,173 PGE 2 has been shown to increase mucosal blood flow; increase secretion of mucus, water, and bicarbonate; increase mucosal cell turnover rate and migration; stimulate adenyl cyclase activity; and exert other protective effects in the gastric mucosa of several species. 162, 172, 173 Perhaps most importantly, PGE 2 and PGI 2 have a role in maintaining epithelial tight junction integrity, which is indispensable for mucosal barrier function and repair after mucosal injury. 172 In spite of the overwhelming amount of information about the role of prostaglandins in maintaining the mucosal barrier in other species and clear clinical and experimental evidence that NSAIDs injure the equine colonic mucosa, the role of prostaglandins in mucosal protection in the equine colon is not yet well defined. Inhibition of COX-1 and COX-2 in equine colonic mucosa with flunixin meglumine resulted in reduced electric resistance of the mucosa and increased permeability to macromolecules in vitro (A.T. Blikslager and S.L. Jones, 2002) , suggesting that flunixin treatment disrupts the epithelial tight junctions in the equine colon. Mucosal changes were correlated with a profound inhibition of PGE 2 and PGI 2 concentrations in the treated tissues. In other studies, administration of a PGE 2 analog prevented the gastrointestinal manifestations of phenylbutazone toxicosis in ponies. 165 Recent development of NSAIDs specific for COX-2 have greatly reduced the frequency and severity of gastrointestinal side effects in human beings taking NSAIDs for chronic musculoskeletal conditions. 174 Thus COX-2-specific NSAIDs hold promise for use in horses to treat arthritis and reduce the incidence of toxicity. For example, the COX-2-specific inhibitor etodolac was less harmful to equine colonic mucosa than flunixin meglumine in vitro (A.T. Blikslager and S.L. Jones, 2002) . Moreover, etodolac was significantly more permissive than flunixin for recovery of the mucosa in equine ischemic-injured intestinal tissues, and in fact, recovery was no different than control tissues. 175 However, their use is at present limited because the specificity of the so-called COX-2selective inhibitors and their efficacy as analgesics have not been demonstrated in the horse.",

[183] [184] [185] Ingestion of the beetles in contaminated alfalfa hay causes release of the toxin from the tissues of the beetle and absorption through the gastrointestinal tract. Transcutaneous absorption may occur but appears to be rare in horses. 184 Blister beetles feed on the flowers of alfalfa and may be incorporated into processed alfalfa hay if the hay is cut and processed simultaneously, as by crimping. [183] [184] [185] The beetles often swarm, and one may find large numbers of beetles in small portions of hay. The lethal dose of cantharidin is less than 1 mg/kg, but the concentration of cantharidin varies from species to species of blister beetles and between sexes. 183, 184 As many as 100 to as few as 6 to 8 beetles may be lethal. Usually, only one or a few horses fed contaminated hay ingest beetles because the beetles are concentrated in a small portion of the hay. However, outbreaks involving many horses on a farm have occurred. Most cases occur in Texas and Oklahoma, but horses in other states may be affected as well, especially if hay is imported from states where blister beetles are common. Peak incidence is in late summer and fall. 186 The fatality rate may be 50% or greater, 183, 187 but if the patient survives several days, recovery is probable.",

            "text": "Cantharidin is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and excreted via the kidney. Cantharidin is a potent irritant, causing acantholysis and vesicle formation when applied topically. 183, 185, 187 The chemical is thought to disrupt oxidative metabolism in the mitochondria, causing mitochondrial swelling, plasma membrane damage, and changes in membrane permeability. 183 The mucosa of the gastrointestinal tract is affected most commonly in horses because they ingest the toxin. Cell swelling and necrosis occur, resulting in mucosal ulceration. Oral, esophageal, gastric, and small and large intestinal ulceration have been observed in natural and experimental canthariasis. 183, 185, 187 Severe fibrinous to pseudomembranous inflammation and submucosal edema of the intestine also have been reported. Diarrhea probably results from the severe ulceration and inflammation of the large intestine, causing increased secretion of water, electrolytes, and protein and decreased absorption of fluid. Large volumes of fluid and protein are lost in the gastrointestinal tract, causing hemoconcentration and profound hypoalbuminemia in some cases. 183, 184, 187 Cystitis and myocarditis occur in natural and experimentally produced cases of cantharidin toxicity. 183, 185, 187 Cystitis occurs because renal excretion of cantharidin results in high concentrations in urine. Occasionally, hemorrhagic cystitis may occur, with hematuria or frank hemorrhage into the bladder. 183 The cause of the myocarditis and myocardial necrosis is unknown but also may be a direct effect of the toxin on the myocardium. Elevated plasma creatine kinase activity often occurs and has been postulated to arise from the damaged myocardium. 183, 184 Horses have a characteristically stiff gait, but histopathologic evidence of skeletal muscle injury that explains the elevated plasma creatine kinase activity has not been observed. 184 The kidneys are often pale, swollen, and moist, with occasional infarcts. 185 Hypocalcemia and hypomagnesemia are biochemical features of cantharidin toxicity in horses that have not been explained. 183, 184, 187 Hypocalcemia may occur from hypoalbuminemia, but the ionized calcium concentration often is decreased along with the total calcium concentration, indicating that hypoalbuminemia is not responsible for the hypocalcemia. 184 In addition, clinical signs of hypocalcemia, such as synchronous diaphragmatic flutter, are often associated with hypocalcemia from cantharidin toxicity. Hypocalcemia associated with hypoalbuminemia alone does not produce clinical signs.",

Arsenate and arsenite uncouple oxidative phosphorylation, leading to breakdown of energy metabolism in the cells of many tissues. 189 Widespread cellular injury and death occur rapidly during acute arsenic toxicosis. Multiorgan failure usually results. In fact, cardiomyopathy and pulmonary disease are common causes of death in human beings. 190 Damage to the large intestine is probably caused in part by direct cellular toxicity and corrosion by the compound. However, vasculitis is a hallmark of the disease in human beings and horses and is thought to be the most important mechanism of large intestinal disease in human beings. 181, 191 Acute hemorrhagic colitis is a feature of arsenic toxicosis, with severe mural edema and mucosal ulceration. 188 Profuse, hemorrhagic diarrhea and abdominal pain result.

            "text": "Overeating of soluble carbohydrates, especially so-called hot grains such as corn, overwhelms the digestive capability of the small intestine, resulting in a high percentage of the soluble carbohydrates entering the large intestine. The amount of soluble carbohydrates that produce diarrhea varies according to the previous dietary history of the individual. Horses fed diets higher in soluble carbohydrates are more resistant to the deleterious effects of carbohydrate overload. Gradual accommodation to a diet high in carbohydrates can be accomplished over several weeks. However, horses fed an unusually large amount of grains or other form of soluble carbohydrates often develop diarrhea and may, depending on the amount ingested, develop severe colitis, systemic inflammation from endotoxemia, metabolic acidosis, and laminitis. [206] [207] [208] [209] The pathogenesis of colitis from carbohydrate overload is caused primarily by the toxic effects on the microbial flora in the large intestine. 207 A sudden delivery of soluble carbohydrates to the large intestine causes rapid fermentation by gram-positive lactic acid-producing bacteria and a sudden increase in organic acid production. The cecal pH rapidly decreases, and the lactic acid concentration rapidly increases. Rapid organic acid production overwhelms the buffering capacity of the large intestine not only by directly depleting the buffers found in the contents but also by reducing the efficiency of buffer secretion. Bicarbonate secretion is linked to absorption of volatile fatty acids, which are produced in low amounts by fermentation of soluble carbohydrates. The contents of the large intestine become profoundly acidic, resulting in unfavorable conditions for the microbial flora. Lactic acid-producing bacteria flourish, while the gram-negative bacteria, especially the Enterobacteriaceae, are killed in large numbers by the acids. Large quantities of endotoxin are released from the dying bacteria. 208 The osmotic load from the lactic acid produced in the large intestine is an important factor in the development of diarrhea because organic acids such as lactic acid are absorbed poorly. Mild cases of carbohydrate overload may result purely from osmotic diarrhea. In more severe cases, the acidic contents of the large intestine are toxic to the mucosa, causing necrosis of the mucosal tissues, similar to that occurring in ruminal acidosis. Mucosal ulceration allows absorption of large quantities of endotoxin and lactic acid produced by the massive die-off of acid-intolerant microbes and fermentation of soluble carbohydrates, normally poorly absorbed by intact mucosa. 209 Systemic inflammation from endotoxemia may be overwhelming, and profound metabolic acidosis may occur. Secretory diarrhea caused by the direct effects of acid luminal contents on the mucosa, as well as the effects of inflammatory mediators on enterocyte secretion, worsens the acidosis and dehydration. Systemic inflammation from endotoxemia, along with intestinal inflammation, adversely affects intestinal motility, and ileus develops. Ileus and gas production from fermentation of the carbohydrates may cause severe distention of the large intestine and signs of abdominal pain. Laminitis is a frequent complication of endotoxemia and lactic acidosis. In fact, carbohydrate overload is used to induce laminitis as an experimental model because of the consistency of the laminitis produced. [207] [208] [209] ",

Weight loss is characteristic and can be severe in some cases. Complications may occur such as peritonitis and acute obstruction. 211 Diagnosis usually is based on finding abnormal amounts of sand in the feces.

Freshwater and water containing electrolytes should be available in all cases. In many instances, periodic nasogastric intubation and administration of water and electrolytes via the tube may be sufficient to maintain hydration. 214 In more severe cases, one can maintain indwelling nasogastric tubes and can administer up to 4 to 8 L of fluid by the tube every 20 to 30 minutes, if ileus is not evident.

Crystalloid fluids, although critical for replacing water and electrolyte losses from diarrhea, actually may contribute to a drop in plasma oncotic pressure because of hemodilution. 216, 217 Administration of colloid solutions are important for volume expansion and to maintain plasma oncotic pressures, which improve tissue perfusion and oxygenation and organ function in hypovolemic, hypotensive, and hypoproteinemic patients with or without systemic inflammatory response syndrome. 218 Colloids are more effective than crystalloid fluids at expanding plasma volume and thus require smaller volumes. Moreover, the effect of colloid volume expansion is longer lasting than crystalloid fluid volume expansion, because colloids are retained in the vasculature better. 217, 218 Natural colloids, such as plasma and purified albumin are used commonly. In addition to its beneficial colloidal properties, plasma harvested from donor horses immunized with rough mutants of Escherichia coli (J5) or Salmonella typhimurium may have other benefits for treatment of endotoxemia from gastrointestinal disease. 219, 220 The horse may require large volumes (6 to 8 L/day) to increase and maintain plasma protein concentration significantly.

The role of inflammation and mediators such as prostaglandins as causes of fluid loss is well known for Salmonella and Clostridium infections. COX inhibitors (NSAIDs) have antisecretory effects in the equine colon and in models of salmonellosis that appear to extend to clinical management of salmonellosis. 16, 36, [221] [222] [223] Indeed, NSAIDs commonly are administered to horses with salmonellosis. However, prostaglandins such as PGE 2 and PGI 2 are also cytoprotective to gastrointestinal mucosa and critical for mucosal repair. 172 The doses of NSAIDs used pharmacologically to inhibit colonic inflammation and secretion in fact may be detrimental to the mucosa if not used judiciously. NSAIDs have been shown to exacerbate colonic inflammation in human beings with inflammatory colitis, impede mucosal healing in several models of mucosal injury, and have well-documented detrimental effects on colonic mucosa in horses. 164, 172, 224 In addition to toxicity to the colonic mucosa, gastric ulceration is not unusual in horses with enterocolitis and may be related to treatment with NSAIDs.",

Salmonellosis is a severely catabolic disease, increasing caloric requirements greatly. Normal intake of roughage to provide energy may be inadequate; however, one should avoid feeding of grains to prevent carbohydrate overload. Dietary management usually consists of restricting or eliminating long-stem roughage (hay) from the diet and feeding exclusively a complete pelleted diet (at least 30% dietary fiber). The rationale behind this recommendation is to reduce the mechanical load on the colon. Frequent meals (4 to 6 times a day) are recommended. One can add corn oil (1 cup every 12 to 24 hours) to the pellets to increase the caloric intake without adding roughage or grain. One should note that if a horse with colitis refuses to eat pelleted feed, then one should feed good-quality grass hay.

Analgesics may be required initially to relieve pain and stimulate appetite. A diet high in roughage often stimulates further passage of sand. Treatment may require several weeks to remove as much sand as possible. Prevention of the disease is important, and recurrence is not unusual. lumen results in clinical signs similar to those of simple obstruction, occlusion of the blood supply results in a more rapid deterioration of the intestinal mucosa and subsequent onset of endotoxemic shock. Although a great deal of interest in the relevance and treatment of intestinal reperfusion injury has arisen recently, 1-3 the lesion that develops during strangulation is often severe, leaving little viable bowel for further injury during reperfusion. 2 Although extensive lengths of strangulated small intestine may be resected, strangulation of the large colon presents a much greater treatment dilemma because strangulated intestine usually extends beyond the limits of surgical resection. 4 Therefore horses with large intestinal strangulation often recover with extensive intestinal injury left in place. Thus subtle degrees of reperfusion injury may be important in horses with large colon disease, warranting further work in this area in an attempt to reduce mortality. 3 Strangulating obstruction may be divided into hemorrhagic and ischemic forms. 5, 6 Hemorrhagic strangulating obstruction, which is most common, involves initial occlusion of veins before occlusion of arteries because of the greater stiffness of arterial walls. This lesion is characterized by a darkened appearance to affected bowel and increased thickness as blood is pumped into the lesion. Ischemic strangulating obstruction occurs if the intestine is twisted tightly enough to occlude arteries and veins simultaneously. In the case of the colon, such strangulation has been suggested to be determined by how much ingesta is in the colon, because intestinal contents may prevent the intestine from twisting tightly. 7 Tissue involved in ischemic strangulating obstruction appears pale and of normal or reduced thickness because of a complete lack of blood flow ( Figure 13 .14-1). Bowel peripheral to strangulating lesions also may become injured because of distention, which reduces mural blood flow once it reaches critical levels. Furthermore, as this intestine is decompressed, it also may undergo reperfusion injury. [8] [9] [10] Small Intestinal Strangulation",

The foramen thus is bounded dorsally by the caudate process of the liver and caudal vena cava and ventrally by the pancreas, hepatoduodenal ligament, and portal vein. Intestine may enter the foramen from the visceral surface of the liver toward the right body wall or the opposite direction. Studies differ as to which is the most common form. 12, 21 In the case of entrapments that enter the foramen in a left-to-right direction, the omental bursa ruptures as the intestine migrates through the epiploic foramen, which may contribute to intraabdominal hemorrhage often seen with this condition. Clinical signs include acute onset of severe colic with examination findings compatible with small intestinal obstruction. The condition tends to be more prevalent in older horses, 12 possibly because of enlargement of the epiploic foramen as the right lobe of the liver undergoes ageassociated atrophy. 22 However, the disease also has been recognized in foals as young as 4 months of age. 23 One makes a definitive diagnosis at surgery, although ultrasonographic findings of distended loops of edematous small intestine adjacent to the right middle body wall suggest epiploic foramen entrapment. 12 In general, thickened, amotile intestine on ultrasonographic examination is highly predictive for small intestinal strangulating obstruction. 24 Small intestine entrapped in the epiploic foramen may be limited to a portion of the intestinal wall (parietal hernia), 25 and the large colon may become entrapped within the epiploic foramen. 26 In treating epiploic foramen entrapment, one must not enlarge the epiploic foramen by blunt force or with a sharp instrument, because rupture of the vena cava or portal vein and fatal hemorrhage may occur.

Small intestinal volvulus theoretically is initiated by a change in local peristalsis or the occurrence of a lesion around which the intestine and its mesentery may twist (such as an ascarid impaction). 11 Volvulus is reportedly one of the most commonly diagnosed causes of small intestinal obstruction in foals. 31, 32 The theory is that young foals may be at risk of small intestinal volvulus because of changing feed habits and adaptation to a bulkier adult diet. Onset of acute, severe colic, a distended abdomen, and radiographic evidence of multiple loops of distended small intestine in a young foal suggest small intestinal volvulus. However, one cannot differentiate volvulus from other causes of small intestinal obstruction preoperatively. In adult horses, volvulus frequently occurs in association with another disease process, during which small intestinal obstruction results in distention and subsequent rotation of the small intestine around the root of the mesentery. Although any segment of the small intestine may be involved, the distal jejunum and ileum are affected most frequently because of their longer mesenteries. 11 One makes the diagnosis at surgery by palpating a twist at the origin of the cranial mesenteric artery. Treatment includes resection of devitalized bowel, which may not be an option because of the extent of small intestinal involvement (similar to large colon volvulus). Prognosis is based on the extent of small intestine involved and its appearance following surgical correction of the lesion. In general, horses with greater than 50% of the small intestine devitalized are considered to have a grave prognosis. 33",

A cardinal sign of inguinal herniation is a cool, enlarged testicle on one side of the scrotum (Figure 13 .14-2). 39, 40 However, inguinal herniae also have been reported in geldings. 41 One also can detect inguinal herniae on rectal palpation, and one can use manipulation of herniated bowel per rectum to reduce a hernia, but this is generally not recommended because of the risk of rectal tears. In many cases, the short segment of herniated intestine greatly improves in appearance after reduction and in some cases can be left unresected. The affected testicle will be congested because of vascular compromise within the spermatic cord, and although the testicle may remain viable, resection generally is recommended. 42 The prognosis in adult horses is good, with up to 75% of horses surviving to 6 months. 40 Horses that have been treated for inguinal herniae may be used for breeding.

The reason for such invagination is not always clear but may involve a lesion at the leading edge of the intussusception, including small masses, foreign bodies, or parasites. In particular, tapeworms (Anoplocephala perfoliata) have been implicated. 45 Ileocecal intussusceptions are the most common intestinal intussusceptions in the horse and typically affect young animals. In one study evaluating 26 cases of ileocecal intussusception, the median age of the horses was 1 year old. Acute ileocecal intussusceptions are those in which the horses has a duration of colic of less than 24 hours and involve variable lengths of intestine that ranged in one study from 6 to 457 cm long. In acute cases the involved segment of ileum typically has a compromised blood supply. Chronic ileocecal intussusceptions typically involve short segments of ileum (up to 10 cm long), and the ileal blood supply is frequently intact. 46 Abdominocentesis results vary because strangulated bowel is contained within the adjacent bowel. Obstruction of the small intestine often is evident, including nasogastric reflux and multiple distended loops of small intestine on rectal palpation. Horses with chronic ileocecal intussusceptions have mild, intermittent colic, often without evidence of small intestinal obstruction. In one study, a mass was palpated in the region of the cecal base in approximately 50% of cases. 45 Transabdominal ultrasound may be helpful in discerning the nature of the mass. The intussusception has a characteristic target appearance on cross section. 47 Other segments of the small intestine also may be intussuscepted, including the jejunum (Figure 13.14-3) . In one study of 11 jejunojejunal intussusceptions, the length of bowel involved ranged from 0.4 to 9.1 m. 48 Attempts to reduce intussusceptions at surgery are usually futile because of intramural swelling of affected bowel. One should resect jejunojejunal intussusceptions.",

Auscultation also may reveal thoracic intestinal sounds, but differentiating these from sounds referred from the abdomen typically is not possible. In one report, two of three horses diagnosed with small intestinal strangulation by diaphragmatic hernia had respiratory acidemia attributable to decreased ventilation. 54 Treatment of horses with diaphragmatic hernia is fraught with complications because of the need to reduce and resect strangulated bowel and the need to repair the defect in the diaphragm. 55, 56 Because dorsal defects in the diaphragm are among the common forms of diaphragmatic defect, closing the diaphragmatic hernia via the approach used for abdominal exploration may not be possible. However, because herniation is likely to recur, 55 scheduling a second surgery using an appropriate approach to resolve the diaphragmatic defect is appropriate.",

Horses with this condition are frequently refractory even to the most potent of analgesics. These horses may prefer to lie in dorsal recumbency, presumably to take weight off the strangulated colon. An abbreviated physical examination is warranted in these cases, because the time elapsed from the onset of strangulation to surgical correction is critical. Under experimental conditions, the colon is irreversibly damaged within 3 to 4 hours of a 360-degree volvulus of the entire colon. 57 Despite severe pain and hypovolemia, horses may have a paradoxically low heart rate, possibly related to increased vagal tone. In addition, results of abdominocentesis often do not indicate the degree of colonic compromise 4,58 and in many cases are not worth attempting because of extreme colonic distention. 59 Palpation per rectum reveals severe gas distention of the large colon, often restricting access to the abdomen beyond the pelvic brim. One may make the diagnosis tentatively based on signalment, severity of pain, and degree of distention.",

However, the colon may twist in the opposite direction, twist greater than 360 degrees (up to 720 degrees has been reported) or twist at the level of the diaphragmatic and sternal flexures. 4 In all cases, one should decompress the colon as much as possible, and in many cases a colonic evacuation via a pelvic flexure enterotomy greatly aids correction of the volvulus. One must determine after correction of the volvulus whether the colon has been injured irreversibly and should base the determination on mucosal color and bleeding (if an enterotomy has been performed), palpation of a pulse in the colonic arteries, serosal color, and appearance of muscular motility. If one judges the colon to be damaged irreversibly, one can consider the feasibility of a large colon resection. Although 95% of the colon can be resected (that part of the colon distal to the level of the cecocolic fold), damage from the volvulus usually exceeds that which can be resected. In these cases, surgeons may elect to resect as much damaged bowel as possible or may advise euthanasia. 7",

            "text": "Type I prolapses occur most frequently in horses with diarrhea, in which the rectal mucosa becomes irritated and protrudes intermittently during episodes of tenesmus. If tenesmus persists, rectal mucosa can remain prolapsed. Rectal mucosa rapidly becomes congested and edematous under these conditions, which one should treat with osmotic agents such as glycerin or magnesium sulfate and by massaging and reducing the prolapse. 74 A purse-string suture may be required to keep the mucosa inside the rectum. Topical application of lidocaine solution or jelly, epidural anesthesia, and sedation may help reduce tenesmus that incites and exacerbates rectal prolapse. One can apply similar treatments to type II rectal prolapses. However, these more severe prolapses may not be reducible without surgical resection of mucosa and submucosa from the prolapsed bowel. 70, 74 Type III and IV rectal prolapses are more serious injuries because of involvement of small colon. 75 In horses with type III prolapses, one should perform an abdominocentesis to determine if injured small colon has resulted in peritonitis. One should reduce the small colon component manually if possible, although prolapsed rectal tissue typically requires mucosal/ submucosal resection. One should perform surgical exploration of the abdomen to determine the status of the small colon, although one can use serial abdominocenteses in lieu of surgery to detect progressive necrosis of bowel. Type IV prolapses occur most commonly in horses with dystocia. 73 These prolapses are almost always fatal because of stretching and tearing of mesenteric vasculature, with subsequent infarction of affected bowel. Therefore euthanasia usually is warranted tend to occur in young horses (63% were less than 3 years old in one study) and may be associated with intestinal tapeworms. Horses show highly variable clinical signs, including acute severe colic, intermittent pain over a number of days, or chronic weight loss. 64 These variable presentations likely relate to the degree to which the cecum has intussuscepted. Initially, the cecal tip inverts, creating a cecocecal intussusception, which does not obstruct flow of ingesta. As the intussusception progresses, the cecum inverts into the right ventral colon (cecocolic intussusception), obstructs flow of ingesta, and often causes severe colic. The cause of abdominal pain is often difficult to differentiate in these cases, although detecting a mass on the right side of the abdomen by per rectal palpation or ultrasound examination sometimes is possible. 63, 64 Treatment involves manual surgical reduction by retracting the intussusceptum directly 63 or via an enterotomy in the right ventral colon. 65 However, a number of cases occur in which one cannot reduce the cecum readily because of severe thickening or in which surgical procedures result in fatal contamination. For example, one report stated that 8 of 11 horses were euthanized in the perioperative period because of complications, 63 and another report stated that 12 of 30 horses were euthanized before or during surgery. The latter included all of the horses with chronic disease because of irreversible changes to the cecum. 64 However, one recent report on cecocolic intussusceptions indicated that seven of eight horses that underwent right ventral colon enterotomy and cecal resection survived long-term, 65 suggesting that continued improvements in surgical techniques may improve the prognosis.",

Therefore the clinician must collect historical, physical examination, and clinicopathologic information and make a decision whether these findings warrant medical management or whether to perform surgical exploration of the abdomen because of a suspected obstructive or ischemic lesion. For example, one may examine a horse with signs of severe abdominal pain, poor cardiovascular status, and abdominal distention that may be compatible with an extensive list of differential diagnoses but that more importantly indicate the need for abdominal exploration to minimize the extent of intestinal injury. The speed with which one can make this clinical decision has a tremendous effect on the well-being of the patient, 1,2 because delaying gastric fluid accumulation because of direct compression of the small intestine by distended colon or via tension on the duodenocolic ligament. The most useful diagnostic test for determining the type of intestinal obstruction is rectal palpation of the abdomen. 4 However, one can reach only approximately one third of the abdomen via the rectum, and this percentage may be substantially less in large horses or heavily pregnant horses. Nonetheless, attempting to determine the type of obstruction present (small intestine versus large intestine, and simple obstruction versus strangulating obstruction) is worthwhile; this information directly affects prognosis. In one study, interns and residents at a veterinary teaching hospital were able to predict the type of lesion with a specificity exceeding 90%. 6 Findings from palpation are helpful in educating the client about the potential findings in surgery and the likelihood of survival for the horse.",

            "text": "The most immediately useful clinicopathologic information in horses with colic are the packed cell volume and total protein, because one can use them to substantiate clinical estimates of dehydration and they correlate strongly with prognosis. 20, 21 A serum biochemical profile is useful for assessing electrolyte imbalances, tissue perfusion (anion gap or lactate), and kidney and liver function. One can use serum biochemical or blood gas analysis to assess acid-base status. Horses with colic most frequently show evidence of metabolic acidosis associated with poor tissue perfusion caused by hypovolemia or endotoxemia, but one may note other abnormalities such as metabolic alkalosis in association with extensive loss or sequestration of stomach chloride. Metabolic acidosis has been investigated further in horses with colic by measuring blood lactate, although this test is not offered routinely in many laboratories. Lactate levels also have been inferred from measurement of the anion gap, although one study noted that lactate in horses with colic did not account for the entire anion gap. 22 Lactate levels and anion gap closely correlate with prognosis for survival. 20, 23, 24 Other key components of assessment of the horse with colic are abdominocentesis and complete blood count. The total white blood cell count and differential can provide crucial evidence of systemic inflammation associated with endotoxemia stemming from colic attributable to colitis (leukopenia, neutropenia, and a left shift) rather than an obstruction (highly variable complete blood count findings). Peritoneal fluid may be helpful in determining the integrity of the intestine. Specifically, as the intestine becomes progressively devitalized, the peritoneal fluid becomes serosanguinous as red blood cells leak into the abdomen, followed by an elevation in the total protein (>2.5 g/dl) and progressive increases in total nucleated cell count (>10,000 cells/\u00b5l). However, these findings do not always correlate well with the condition of the intestine, particularly in horses with large colon volvulus. For example, in a study of 57 horses with large colon volvulus, the average total protein (2.5 g/dl) and total nucleated cell count (1000 cells/\u00b5l) were normal despite the fact that only 36% with a 360-degree volvulus survived. 4, 25 These measures may appear normal because the development of severe mucosal injury following large colon volvulus is rapid and may not allow enough time for protein and leukocytes to equilibrate with the abdominal fluid. 26 Investigators have taken all the variables routinely assessed during evaluation of horses for colic and have attempted to develop models to predict accurately the need for surgery and the prognosis for life. [27] [28] [29] [30] None of these predictor models has taken the place of clinical decision making, although these studies have added 924 PART II Disorders of Specific Body Systems signs are excellent predictors of whether a horse requires surgical exploration of the abdomen. In fact, refractory pain supersedes all other predictors of the need for surgery in the colic patient. Once signs of colic have been recognized and categorized as to their severity, rapidly and effectively relieving the pain is critical for the well-being of the horse and to reduce the owner's anxiety. In addition, pain is best managed before it becomes severe. 13 Several classes of analgesics are readily available to treat horses with colic (Table 13. 15-3), including \u03b1 2 -agonists (xylazine, detomidine), opiates (butorphanol), and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs, such as flunixin meglumine). Although much of this information is familiar to most practitioners, several principles deserve emphasis. The short-duration drugs xylazine and butorphanol, which provide analgesia for 30 to 45 minutes, allow the veterinarian to determine if pain is recurrent within the time period of the typical examination. In contrast, flunixin meglumine is not as potent as an analgesic but has a much longer duration of action. To avoid deleterious effects on gastrointestinal mucosa and the kidneys, one should not administer flunixin meglumine more frequently than recommended. 14, 15 The recent discovery of two isoforms of cyclooxygenase (COX), the enzyme inhibited by NSAIDs, has resulted in discovery of drugs that can more selectively inhibit proinflammatory COX-2 while permitting continued constitutive production of prostanoids. Such specificity may be advantageous in horses with colic, particularly when one considers recent evidence of reduced intestinal recovery from an ischemic event with flunixin compared with a drug that is more selective for COX-2. 16 One should reserve the \u03b1 2agonist detomidine for horses with severe, unrelenting pain because of its tremendous potency. 17 In addition, one should remember that \u03b1 2 -agonists reduce the heart rate associated with a transient increase in blood pressure, 18, 19 thereby reducing the predictive value of the heart rate and pulse pressure. tremendously to understanding of the importance of some prognostic factors, particularly those reflecting cardiovascular function.",

Although feeding of coastal Bermuda hay has been implicated in the regional distribution of the disease, separating geographic location from regional hay sources as risk factors has been difficult. Nonetheless, feeding coastal Bermuda hay likely places horses at risk of ileal impaction, particularly if the coarse fiber content of the hay is high. Furthermore, sudden changes in feed from an alternate type of hay to coastal Bermuda hay likely places a horse at risk of ileal impaction. 38 Studies in England have revealed tapeworm infection as another important risk factor for ileal impaction. Based on risk analysis, the data suggested that in excess of 80% of the ileal impaction cases studied were associated with serologic or fecal evidence of tapeworm infection. 39 Because of the poor sensitivity of fecal analysis for tapeworms, Proudman and Trees have developed a serologic test (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) with a sensitivity of approximately 70% and a specificity of 95%. 40 Clinical signs of horses with ileal impaction are typical for a horse with small intestinal obstruction, including onset of moderate to severe colic and loops of distended small intestine palpable per rectum as the condition progresses. Because the ileum is the distal most aspect of the small intestinal tract, nasogastric reflux may take a considerable time to develop and is found in approximately 50% of horses requiring surgical correction of impacted ileum. 35, 41 One usually makes the diagnosis at surgery, although on occasion one may palpate an impacted ileum per rectum. Multiple loops of distended small intestine frequently make the impaction difficult to palpate. Ileal impactions may resolve with medical treatment 36 but frequently require surgical intervention ( Figure 13.15-2) . At surgery, one can infuse fluids directly Figure 13 .15-1 Appearance of roundworms that have been retrieved within the nasogastric reflux from a foal with an ascarid impaction.

            "text": "Ileal hypertrophy is a disorder in which the muscular layers (circular and longitudinal) of the ileum hypertrophy for unknown reasons (idiopathic) or following an incomplete or functional obstruction. For idiopathic cases, proposed mechanisms include parasympathetic neural dysfunction resulting in chronically increased muscle tone and subsequent hypertrophy of the muscular layers of the ileal wall. Such neural dysfunction possibly could result from parasite migration. Alternative hypotheses include chronic increases in the muscular tone of the ileocecal valve, leading to muscular hypertrophy of the ileum as it contracts against a partially occluded ileocecal valve. The jejunum also may be hypertrophied, alone or with the ileum. Clinical signs include chronic intermittent colic as the ileum hypertrophies and gradually narrows the lumen diameter. In one study, partial anorexia and chronic weight loss (1 to 6 months) were documented in 45% of the horses, most likely because of intermittent colic and reduced appetite. Because hypertrophy does not affect the ileal mucosa, no reason exists to believe that these horses experience malabsorption of nutrients. One usually makes the diagnosis at surgery, although one may palpate the hypertophied ileum per rectum in some cases. For treatment, one performs an ileocecal or jejunocecal anastomosis to bypass the hypertrophied ileum. Without surgical bypass, intermittent colic persists and the thickened ileum ultimately may rupture. 43 The prognosis is fair with surgical treatment. 44 Secondary ileal hypertrophy is most commonly notable in horses that previously have had colic surgery and that may have a partial or functional obstruction at an anastomotic site. For example, in one case report, a horse developed ileal hypertrophy after surgical correction of an ileocecal intussusception. 45 Ileal hypertrophy also was noted in a horse with cecal impaction in which an ileocolic anastomosis was oriented incorrectly. 46 Horses are typically re-presented for recurrence of colic in these cases. Surgical therapy is directed at addressing the cause of small intestinal obstruction and resecting hypertrophied intestine.",

Mesodiverticular bands also may originate from the embryonic ventral mesentery and attach to the antimesenteric surface of the bowel, thereby forming a potential space within which intestine may become entrapped. Clinical signs range from chronic colic for an impacted Meckel's diverticulum to acute severe colic for intestine strangulated by a mesodiverticular band. One makes the diagnosis at surgery, and treatment requires resection of the diverticulum and any associated bands.

            "text": "Adhesions of one segment of bowel to another or of a segment of intestine to other organs and the body wall most typically occur following abdominal surgery and may be clinically silent, cause chronic colic attributable to partial obstruction, or result in acute obstruction. These differing clinical syndromes are attributable to the type of adhesions that develop. For example, a fibrous adhesion that does not by itself obstruct the intestinal lumen might serve as the pivot point for a volvulus, whereas an adhesion between adjacent segments of the intestinal tract may create a hairpin turn that causes chronic partial obstruction. 51 The number of adhesions that develop also may vary greatly from horse to horse. Some horses may develop a single adhesion adjacent to an anastomotic site or a discrete segment of injured intestine, whereas other horses may develop diffuse adhesions involving multiple segments of intestine, likely because of widespread inflammation of the peritoneum at the time of the original surgery.",

            "text": "The mechanism whereby adhesions develop is complex but likely involves initial injury to the serosa initiated by intestinal ischemia, reperfusion injury, and luminal distention. 52 Importantly, such injury involves infiltration of neutrophils into the serosa accompanied by loss of mesothelial cells. In one study assessing the margins of resected small intestine, extensive neutrophil infiltration was documented in the serosa, particularly in the proximal resection margin that had been distended before correction of a variety of strangulating lesions. 53 Regions of serosal injury and inflammation subsequently undergo reparative events similar to any wound, including local production of fibrin, de novo synthesis of collagen by infiltrating fibroblasts, and ultimately maturation and remodeling of fibrous tissue. Unfortunately, during this process, fibrin may result in injured intestinal surfaces adhering to adjacent injured bowel or an adjacent organ. Once a fibrinous adhesion has developed, new collagen synthesis may result in a permanent fibrous adhesion. Alternatively, proteases released by local phagocytes may lyse fibrinous exudate, thereby reversing the adhesive process. Thus one can view formation of adhesions as an imbalance of fibrin deposition and fibrinolysis. 54 Prevention of adhesions depends on inhibition of the mechanisms involved in adhesion formation, including reduction of serosal injury with early intervention and good surgical technique, reduction of inflammation by administration of antiinflammatory medications, physical separation of inflamed serosal surfaces (e.g., carboxymethylcellulose and hyaluronan), [55] [56] [57] and pharmacologic modulation of fibrinous adhesion formation (e.g., heparin). 58 In addition, early return of motility in the small intestine after surgery may reduce contact time between inflamed surfaces of intestine, thereby reducing the chances of adhesion formation. 54 Horses at greatest risk of developing adhesions after colic surgery appear to be those that have small intestinal disease. 51, 59 In one study of horses undergoing surgical correction of small intestinal obstruction, 22% developed a surgical lesion associated with adhesions. Foals appear to have an increased incidence of adhesions compared with mature horses regardless of the nature of the abdominal surgery. 51 One study indicated that 17% of foals developed lesions attributable to adhesions regardless of the type of initial surgery. 60 Studies conflict as to whether the degree of surgical intervention influences adhesion formation, 51 but in one study, horses that require enterotomy or resection and anastomosis were at greatest risk of developing adhesions. 59 As an indication of the importance of postoperative adhesion formation, adhesions were among the most common reasons for repeat laparotomy in postoperative colic patients. 59, 61 Clinical signs of horses with adhesions vary greatly depending on whether the adhesion is causing partial obstruction or complete luminal obstruction or involves intestinal vasculature. Adhesions would be an important differential diagnosis for intermittent colic in the postoperative period, particularly if such colic was not relieved by nasogastric decompression of the stomach. Continued intermittent colic should prompt abdominocentesis to determine if septic peritonitis is present, which may contribute to adhesion formation. Placement of a large bore drain and peritoneal lavage ( Figure 13 surgery should prompt immediate nasogastric intubation to decompress the stomach. Treatment should include attempts at obtaining reflux from the horse at frequent intervals rather than relying on passive flow of reflux. In addition, administration of intravenous fluids should account for the maintenance requirement (50 ml/kg/day, about 1 L/hr in the average horse) and fluid losses via reflux. In practice, this requires frequent monitoring of packed cell volume and total protein to ensure that the horse remains well hydrated. Although concerns have arisen that overhydrating horses may contribute to increased nasogastric reflux, 42 keeping horses well-hydrated to avoid hypovolemic shock is critical. Additionally, one should monitor electrolytes frequently, particularly considering their potential role in smooth muscle contraction and nerve excitability. Because of the important role of inflammation in postoperative ileus, including elaboration of COX-2-produced prostanoids, 70 administration of NSAIDs is indicated. NSAID administration is particularly necessary if postoperative ileus is associated with endotoxemia, because lipopolysaccharide-induced prostanoid production disrupts propulsive motility in horses. 71, 72 Interestingly, phenylbutazone is more effective than flunixin meglumine at reducing the deleterious actions of lipopolysaccharide on intestinal motility. 73 However, one should use caution when administering NSAIDs to patients with postoperative ileus in light of research suggesting that complete inhibition of prostanoid production can alter motility patterns in normal equine intestine. 68 The advent of selective COX-2 inhibitors may provide optimal antiinflammatory treatment in the future. 74 Other treatments aimed at specifically modulating intestinal motility include lidocaine (bolus of 1.3 mg/kg followed by 0.05 mg/kg/min for 24 hours), erythromycin (0.5 to 1.0 mg/kg slow intravenous infusion in 1 L saline every 6 hours), and metoclopramide (0.04 mg/kg/hr). 66, 75, 76 The mechanism of lidocaine is presumed to be inhibition of sensory nerve activity within the wall of the intestine, thereby reducing reflex sympathetic inhibitory activity. In addition, intravenously administered lidocaine appears to be an effective analgesic. Thus an important feature of intravenous lidocaine therapy may be to control postoperative pain-induced reduction of gastrointestinal motility and mucosal secretory activity. 77 Metoclopramide may stimulate intestinal motility by several mechanisms, including dopamine receptor blockade, cholinergic stimulation, and adrenergic blockade. 66 Although metoclopramide has been shown to be beneficial for reversing postoperative ileus in clinical patients and research animals, it has central nervous system excitatory side effects in the horse that make its use difficult. Nonetheless, administration of metoclopramide to horses with postoperative ileus resulted in elect repeat laparotomy or laparoscopy. In one study of adhesions, 70% of repeat laparotomies were performed within 60 days, suggesting that surgical colic attributable to adhesions typically occurs within 2 months of an initial surgical procedure. Unfortunately, the prognosis for horses with colic attributable to adhesions is low, with only 16% of horses in one study surviving from adhesion-induced colic. 51",

However, in veterinary medicine, the term typically is used to designate a lack of progressive aboral propulsion of ingesta resulting in functional obstruction. 62 One typically bases the diagnosis of postoperative ileus on the presence of excessive gastric fluid accumulation (reflected as excessive nasogastric reflux). Postoperative ileus may occur following any abdominal exploratory procedure. However, horses undergoing surgery for strangulating small intestinal lesions or small intestinal obstructive lesions such as an ileal impaction are at greatest risk. 42 Recently, the syndrome of postoperative ileus in horses has been broadened to include those horses that may have delayed transit of ingesta through the large intestine following surgery. This large intestinal ileus may follow any type of surgery, particularly horses that have had orthopedic surgery, and is characterized by reduced fecal output (fewer than three piles of manure per day) rather than excessive nasogastric reflux. 62 However, horses with excessive nasogastric reflux are unlikely to have normal fecal output, so the distinction between these two manifestations of ileus is not absolute.",

            "text": "Mechanisms involved in precipitating postoperative ileus characterized by small intestinal dysfunction likely involve local inflammation, reduced coordination of progressive motility, and increased sympathetic tone. A recent series of studies in the rat has shown that surgical manipulation of intestine results in delayed transit time associated with infiltration of neutrophils into intestinal longitudinal muscle [63] [64] [65] and upregulation of inducible nitric oxide synthase and COX-2. The mechanisms in the horse may be similar in that extensive manipulation of the intestine resulted in abnormal intestinal motility in ponies, 66 and prostanoids and nitric oxide alter or reduce intestinal motility in horses. [67] [68] [69] Clinical signs of postoperative ileus following colic surgery include evidence of abdominal pain, increased heart rate, reduced gastrointestinal sounds, and reflux of gastric fluid via a nasogastric tube. Of these signs, heart rate is critical because it appears to be a more sensitive indicator of pain in the postoperative period than overt evidence of colic. Therefore a sudden increase in the heart rate of a postoperative patient following colic a significantly reduced duration of reflux and shorter postoperative hospital stays compared with horses not receiving this drug. 76 In the same study, constant infusion of metoclopramide was superior to intermittent infusion. Recent in vitro studies indicate that metoclopramide effectively increases smooth muscle contractile activity throughout the small intestine. Similarly, the motilin agonist erythromycin had stimulatory effects on equine small intestine, although the results were not uniform throughout the small intestine. Erythromycin stimulates contractile activity in the longitudinal muscle of the pyloric antrum but inhibits contractile activity in circular smooth muscle in this segment of the gastrointestinal tract. 75 The latter may be attributable to activation of motilin receptors on inhibitory nerves and may result in enhanced gastric emptying. In vivo studies on erythromycin confirmed the stimulatory action of this drug on the distal small intestine and indicated this drug also stimulates contractile activity in the cecum and pelvic flexure. However, the stimulation depends on the temporal association with surgery. Erythromycin stimulated contractile activity in the postoperative period in the ileum and pelvic flexure but not the cecum, 78 suggesting this drug may be useful for treating select cases of postoperative ileus.",

Although treatment of large colon impaction in the postoperative period typically is uncomplicated, onset of cecal impaction is fatal in many cases because of the difficulty in recognizing horses that have cecal dysfunction.

            "text": "Cecal impaction may be divided into two syndromes: primary cecal impactions that result from excessive accumulation of ingesta in the cecum and secondary cecal impactions that develop while a horse is being treated for a separate problem. 79, 80 Although primary impactions typically consist of impacted, relatively dry fecal material and secondary cecal impactions tend to have fluid contents, considerable overlap exists between the two syndromes, and one must approach each case carefully. In horses with primary cecal impactions, onset of abdominal pain occurs over a number of days, reminiscent of the development of a large colon impaction. One should differentiate cecal impactions from large colon impactions on the basis of rectal palpation findings. Cecal impactions have a propensity to rupture before the development of severe abdominal pain or systemic deterioration and therefore must be monitored closely. 79 Secondary cecal impactions typically develop following unrelated surgical procedures that result in postoperative pain (particularly orthopedic surgeries). Secondary cecal impactions may be even more difficult to detect because one may attribute postoperative depression and decreased fecal output to the operative procedure rather than to colic. By the time horses with secondary cecal impactions show noticeable signs of colic, the cecum may be close to rupture. In many cases, no signs of impending rupture are evident. 80 Therefore all horses that undergo surgeries in which considerable postoperative pain may develop should have feed intake and manure production closely monitored. A recent study indicated that horses that produce fewer than three piles of manure daily in the postoperative period are at risk of developing a large intestinal impaction. Furthermore, horses that underwent prolonged (>1 hour) orthopedic surgery that received inadequate treatment with phenylbutazone were at considerable risk of reduced postoperative fecal output. 62 These results are in contrast to statements indicating that NSAIDs may place horses at risk of impaction, statements that appear to be based largely on clinical impressions rather than on risk analysis. 80 The diagnosis of primary cecal impaction is based on palpation of a firm, impacted cecum per rectum. In some cases, cecal impactions may be difficult to differentiate from large colon impactions. However, careful palpation reveals the inability to move the hand completely dorsal to the impacted viscus because of the attachment of the cecum to the dorsal body wall. Treatment for horses with primary cecal impactions may include initial medical therapy, including aggressive administration of intravenous fluids and judicious use of analgesics. 80 However, if the cecum is distended grossly or if medical therapy hasno effect within a reasonable period of time, surgical evacuation of the cecum via a typhlotomy is indicated. 79 In addition, performing an ileocolostomy to bypass the cecum is advisable, because postoperative cecal motility dysfunction with recurrence of the impaction is common. 46, 81 In horses that develop secondary cecal impactions, diagnosis is based on palpation of a greatly distended cecum filled with semifluid intestinal contents. The nature of the contents likely is related to the more rapid progression of this disease compared with primary cecal impaction. One should not delay surgery because of the risk of cecal rupture. 82 However, if the cecum appears healthy following typhlotomy and evacuation, bypass of the cecum is not as critical as it is for primary impactions as long as one can control the inciting cause of the impaction (such as orthopedic pain).",

However, a sudden restriction in exercise associated with musculoskeletal injury appears frequently to be associated with onset of impaction. 84 Another consideration is equine feeding regimens, which usually entail twice daily feeding of concentrate. Such regimens are associated with large fluxes of fluid into and out of the colon, associated with readily fermentable carbohydrate in the colon and subsequent increases in serum aldosterone, respectively. One may prevent these fluid fluxes, which may cause dehydration of ingesta during aldosterone-stimulated net fluid flux out of the colon, with frequent small feedings. 32 Amitraz, an acaricide associated with clinical cases of colon impaction, can induce impaction of the ascending colon. 85, 86 This effect may provide some clues as to the pathogenesis of large colon impaction. In particular, amitraz appears to alter pelvic flexure pacemaker activity, resulting in uncoordinated motility patterns between the left ventral and left dorsal colon and excessive retention of ingesta. Absorption of water from the ingesta increases with retention time, dehydrates the contents of the colon, and results in impaction. Conceivably, parasite migration in the region of a pacemaker may have a similar action. 87 Other factors implicated in large colon impaction include limited exercise, poor dentition, coarse roughage, or dehydration.",

Fecal production decreases, and the feces are often hard, dry, and mucuscovered because of delayed transit time. The heart rate may be elevated mildly during episodes of pain but is often normal. Signs of abdominal pain are typically well controlled with administration of analgesics but become increasingly more severe and refractory if the impaction does not resolve. The diagnosis is based on palpation of a firm mass in the large colon per rectum. However, one may underestimate the extent of the impaction by rectal palpation alone because much of the colon is out of reach. Adjacent colon may be distended if the impaction has resulted in complete obstruction. One should attempt initial medical treatment. Administration of analgesics (e.g., flunixin meglumine at 0.5 to 1.1 mg/kg intravenously every 8 to 12 hours; butorphanol at 0.04 to 0.1 mg/kg intramuscularly every 4 to 6 hours; or xylazine at 0.3 to 0.5 mg/kg intravenously as needed) controls intermittent abdominal pain. Administration of oral laxatives such as mineral oil (2 to 4 L by nasogastric tube every 12 to 24 hours) and the anionic surfactant dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate (6 to 12 g/500 kg diluted in 2 to 4 L of water by nasogastric tube every 12 to 24 hours) are used commonly to soften the impaction. Saline cathartics such as magnesium sulfate (0.1 mg/kg in 2 to 4 L by nasogastric tube) also may be useful. One should not permit access to feed. For impactions that persist, one should institute aggressive oral and intravenous fluid therapy (2 to 4 times the maintenance fluid requirement). If the impaction remains unresolved, the horse becomes uncontrollably painful, or extensive gas distention of the colon occurs, surgery is indicated. In addition, one can monitor abdominal fluid serially to determine the onset of intestinal compromise. 83 At surgery, one evacuates the contents of the colon via a pelvic flexure enterotomy. The prognosis is good for those horses in which impactions resolve medically (95% long-term survival in one study) and fair in horses that require surgical intervention (58% long-term survival in the same study). 84",

            "text": "Enteroliths are mineralized masses typically composed of magnesium ammonium phosphate (struvite). 88 However, magnesium vivianite also has been identified in enteroliths, along with variable quantities of sodium, sulfur, potassium, and calcium. The formation of magnesiumbased minerals is puzzling because of the relative abundance of calcium in colonic fluids, which would favor the formation of calcium phosphates (apatite) rather than struvite. 89 However, elevated dietary intake of magnesium and protein may play a role. Many horses that develop enteroliths are located in California and are fed a diet consisting mainly of alfalfa hay. Analysis of this hay has revealed a concentration of magnesium approximately 6 times the daily requirements of the horse. 90 Furthermore, the high protein concentration in alfalfa hay may contribute to calculi formation by increasing the ammonia nitrogen load in the large intestine. Enteroliths most commonly form around a nucleus of silicon dioxide (a flintlike stone), but nidi have included ingested nails, rope, and hair. 88 Enteroliths usually are found in the right dorsal and transverse colons. 90 Although enterolithiasis has a wide geographic distribution, horses in California have the highest incidence. In one California study, horses with enterolithiasis represented 28% of the surgical colic population, and Arabians, Morgans, American Saddlebreds, and donkeys were at greatest risk of this disease. 91 In a study of enterolithiasis in Texas, risk factors also included feeding of alfalfa hay and Arabian breed. However, in that study, miniature horses were also at risk. 92 Horses with enteroliths are rarely under 4 years old, 90 although an enterolith in an 11-month-old miniature horse has been reported recently. 93 Enterolithiasis is characterized by episodic, mild to moderate, intermittent abdominal pain. 90 Progressive anorexia and depression may develop. The amount of pain depends on the degree of obstruction and amount of distention. Partial luminal obstruction allows the passage of scant, pasty feces. Heart rate varies and depends on the degree of pain. In some cases, an enterolith is forced into the small colon, where it causes acute small colon obstruction. One may diagnose enteroliths by abdominal radiography or at surgery. On rare occasions, one may palpate an enterolith per rectum, particularly if it is present in the distal small colon.",

In fact in one study, 14% of horses presented for treatment of enterolithiasis had a history of passing an enterolith in the feces. However, enteroliths typically are located in the right dorsal colon, transverse colon, or small colon. At surgery, one gently pushes the enterolith toward a pelvic flexure enterotomy, but removal frequently requires a separate right dorsal colon enterotomy to prevent rupture of the colon. Following removal of an enterolith, one must conduct further exploration to determine if other enteroliths are present. Solitary enteroliths are usually round, whereas multiple enteroliths have flat sides. The prognosis is good (92% 1-year survival in one study of 900 cases), unless the colon ruptures during removal of an enterolith. In one recent study, rupture occurred in 15% of cases. 91",

Fine sand tends to accumulate in the ventral colon, whereas coarse sand may accumulate in the dorsal colon. 94, 95 However, individual differences in colonic function may contribute to accumulation of sand, because some horses can clear consumed sand, whereas others cannot. Distention from the impaction itself, or gas proximal to the impaction, causes abdominal pain. In addition, sand may trigger diarrhea, presumably because of irritation of the colonic mucosa. 96 In horses with sand impactions, clinical signs are similar to those of horses with large colon impactions. 94 One may find sand in the feces, and auscultation of the ventral abdomen may reveal sounds of sand moving within the large colon. 97 However, unlike sand-induced diarrhea, one may not hear sand impactions easily because of the lack of colonic motility. To determine the presence of fecal sand, one places several fecal balls in a rectal palpation sleeve or other container, which subsequently is filled with water. If sand is present, it accumulates at the bottom of the container. In addition, one may detect mineral opacity within the colon on abdominal radiographs, particularly in foals, ponies, and small horses. Abdominal paracentesis typically yields normal fluid and poses some risk because large quantities of sand in the ventral colon make inadvertent perforation of the colon more likely. 95 Peritoneal fluid is often normal but may have an elevated protein concentration.",

Administration of psyllium hydrophilic mucilloid (0.25 to 0.5 kg/500 kg in 4 to 8 L of water by stomach tube) may facilitate passage of sand. One should administer the solution rapidly because it will form a viscous gel. An alternative method of administration is to mix psyllium with 2 L of mineral oil, which will not form a gel and can be pumped through a nasogastric tube easily. One then pumps 2 to 4 L of water through the tube. The psyllium separates from the oil phase and mixes with the water, forming a gel within the gastrointestinal tract. Psyllium is thought to act by stimulating motility or by agglutinating the sand. However, a recent experimental study failed to show a benefit of this treatment for clearing sand from the colons of otherwise normal horses. 98 If a severe impaction is present, one should not give the psyllium until softening the impaction by administrating intravenous or oral fluids and other laxatives. Perforation is a potential complication in horses with sand impactions because the sand stretches and irritates the intestinal wall and causes inflammation. Therefore if colic becomes intractable, one should perform surgical evacuation of the large colon. The prognosis is generally good. 94, 95 ",

            "text": "Displacement of the ascending colon is a common cause of large intestinal obstruction. The ascending colon is freely movable except for the right dorsal and ventral colons. Contact with adjacent viscera and the abdominal wall tends to inhibit movement of the ascending colon from a normal position; however, accumulation of gas and fluid or ingesta may cause the colon to migrate. 99 Feeding practices, including feeding of large concentrate meals, likely plays a role in initiating displacement of the large colon. Large concentrate meals increase the rate of passage of ingesta, allowing a greater percentage of soluble carbohydrates to reach the large intestine, 31 which in turn increases the rate of fermentation and the amount of gas and volatile fatty acids produced. The production of large amounts of volatile fatty acids stimulates the secretion of large volumes of fluid into the colon. 100 The association between feeding concentrate and development of displacements of the large colon is illustrated by studies indicating that ascending colon displacement is more prevalent in horses fed a highconcentrate, low-roughage diet. 101 Abnormal motility patterns of the ascending colon also have been suggested to contribute to the development of colonic displacement. Feeding stimulates colonic motility via the gastrocolic reflex, but large meals may alter normal motility patterns and concurrently allow rapid accumulation of gas and fluid from fermentation. 31, 102 Migration of parasite larvae (strongyles) through the intestinal wall also has been shown to alter colonic motility patterns. Other experimental studies also have shown that Strongylus vulgaris infection results in reduced blood flow to segments of the large intestine without necessarily causing infarction. Electric activity of the colon and cecocolic junction increases after infection with S. vulgaris and cyathostome larvae, probably reflecting a direct effect of migration through the intestine and an early response to reduced blood flow. 103 Displacements of the ascending colon generally are divided into three types: left dorsal displacement, right dorsal displacement, and retroflexion. Left dorsal displacement is characterized by entrapment of the ascending colon in the renosplenic space. The colon often is twisted 180 degrees such that the left ventral colon is situated in a dorsal position relative to the left dorsal colon. The entrapped portion may be only the pelvic flexure or may involve a large portion of the ascending colon, with the pelvic flexure situated near the diaphragm. The colon may become entrapped by migrating dorsally between the left abdominal wall and the spleen or may migrate in a caudodorsal direction over the nephrosplenic ligament. Occasionally, one can palpate the ascending colon between the spleen and abdominal wall, lending support to the first mechanism of displacement. Gastric distention is thought to predispose horses to left dorsal displacement of the ascending colon by displacing the spleen medially, allowing the colon room to migrate along the abdominal wall. Right dorsal displacement begins by movement of the colon cranially, medial (medial flexion) or lateral (lateral flexion) to the cecum. According to one author, the proportion of right dorsal displacements with medial versus lateral flexion is approximately 1:15. 104 In either case the pelvic flexure ends up adjacent to the diaphragm. Retroflexion of the ascending colon occurs by movement of the pelvic flexure cranially without movement of the sternal or diaphragmatic flexures.",

The heart rate may be elevated during periods of abdominal pain but is often normal. Abdominal distention may be present if the colon is enlarged by gas, fluid, or ingesta. Fecal production is reduced because progressive motility of the large intestine is absent. One often diagnoses left dorsal displacements by palpation per rectum. One can feel the left ventral colon in a dorsal position; it often is filled with gas. One can trace the ascending colon to the nephrosplenic space, and the spleen may be displaced medially. Alternatively, one can reach a tentative diagnosis using abdominal ultrasonography. The spleen is visible on the left side of the abdomen, but the gasdistended bowel obscures the left kidney. Evaluation of this technique indicates that false positives occur in few instances, although false negatives occasionally may occur. 106 A definitive diagnosis therefore may require surgery. Right dorsal displacements are characterized by the presence of the distended ventral colon running across the pelvic inlet and may be felt between the cecum and the body wall if a lateral flexion is present. The pelvic flexure is usually not palpable. Retroflexion of the ascending colon may produce a palpable kink in the colon. If the displaced colons are not distended by gas in the instance of right dorsal displacement and retroflexion, the ascending colon may not be palpable and is conspicuous by its absence from a normal position. Peritoneal fluid may increase in amount, but the color, protein concentration, and white blood cell count are usually normal.

However, nonsurgical intervention has been successful in select cases of nephrosplenic entrapment of the large colon.

One anesthetizes the horse and places it in right lateral recumbency, rotates the horse up to dorsal recumbency, rocking it back and forth for 5 to 10 minutes, and then rolls the horse down into left lateral recumbency. 109 One should palpate the nephrosplenic space per rectum to determine whether the entrapment has been relieved before recovering the horse from anesthesia. One may administer phenylephrine (3-6 \u00b5g/kg/min over 15 minutes) to decrease the size of the spleen. 110 More recently, phenylephrine has been used successfully with 30 to 45 minutes of exercise to reduce nephrosplenic entrapments in four of six horses. 26 The authors suggested that the technique be used on horses with mild to moderate colonic distention, particularly when financial constraints are severe. A number of cases occur in which nonsurgical interventions do not correct the problem and others in which nonsurgical manipulations correct the entrapment but result in large colon volvulus or displacement. 111 One should take horses in such condition to surgery promptly.

In one study the obstructing mass could be palpated per rectum in three of six horses. 112 Fecaliths are common in ponies, miniature horses, and foals. 113 Older horses with poor dentition also may be predisposed to fecaliths because of the inability to masticate fibrous feed material fully. Fecaliths commonly cause obstruction in the descending colon and may cause tenesmus. 112 Other clinical signs are similar to those of enterolithiasis. Abdominal radiography may be useful in smaller patients to identify the obstruction, especially if gas distention around the foreign body or fecalith provides contrast. The horse usually requires surgical treatment.",

            "text": "Mural masses such as abscesses, tumors (adenocarcinoma, lymphosarcoma), granulomata, and hematomas ( Figure 13 .15-4) can cause luminal obstruction and impaction, typically in older horses. Impaction may result from obstruction of the lumen or impaired motility in the segment of intestine with the mass. Abscesses may originate from the lumen of the intestine or may extend from the mesentery or mesenteric lymph nodes. Intramural hematomas form most commonly in the descending colon and cause acute abdominal pain. 114 Once the acute pain from the hematoma subsides, impaction proximal to the hematoma develops because of impaired motility through the affected portion of the colon. Trauma, ulceration of the mucosa, and parasitic damage are speculated causes of intramural hematomas. 114, 115 Stricture of the large intestine occurs when fibrous tissue forms in a circular pattern around or within the intestine, reducing the luminal diameter and the ability of the wall to stretch. Strictures may be congenital or may follow peritonitis, previous abdominal surgery, or inflammatory bowel disease. In a report of 11 horses with inflammatory bowel disease, 6 horses had strictures, four of which were in the small intestine and two of which were in the large colon. 116 Clinical signs vary according to the degree of luminal obstruction. Partial obstruction and impaction tend to produce mild to moderate abdominal pain of insidious onset. Mural hematomas tend to produce signs of acute abdominal pain. 114, 115 Per rectal palpation of the abdomen may reveal the presence of a mass or simply the impacted segment but not the mass itself. One may note fever, weight loss, and anorexia if an abscess or tumor is the cause. An elevated white blood cell count; hyperfibrinogenemia; hyperglobulinemia; or normocytic, normochromic anemia may occur with abscesses or tumors. Peritoneal fluid may reflect the cause of the mass. Tumor cells may occur infrequently. One may note evidence of inflammation with bacteria if the cause of colic is an abscess or granuloma, in which case one should culture the fluid. Hematomas may cause hemorrhage into the peritoneal fluid. Treatment usually requires surgical resection of the mass. One may treat abscesses with appropriate antibiotics if the impaction can be resolved medically with oral or intravenous analgesics and laxatives. Streptococcus spp, Actinomyces pyogenes, Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis, Rhodococcus equi, anaerobic bacteria, and gram-negative enteric organisms commonly are involved in abscesses.",

A few cases of lymphoma have been identified with monoclonal hypergammaglobulinemia. 55 Ectopic hormone production may result in hypercalcemia (calcium >14 mg/dl), which is associated with alimentary neoplasia such as lymphoma, multiple myeloma, carcinomata, and ameloblastoma. 2, 56 Hypoglycemia (blood glucose <70 mg/dl) can occur with neoplasia of the pancreas or liver. 2 Rectal examination may detect an abdominal mass, thickening of the intestinal wall, lymph node enlargement, or a gritty texture in horses with carcinomatosis. 2 Rectal biopsy can reveal lymphoma in some cases. 42 Fecal occult blood test is nonspecific for neoplastic disease but can reveal blood loss through the gastrointestinal tract. Occasionally, abdominocentesis can identify neoplasia if the tumor exfoliates cells into the abdomen. One can diagnose squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, and mesothelioma from peritoneal fluid. 10, 45, 46, 57 Characterization of peritoneal fluid as an inflammatory exudate or modified transudate without any neoplastic cells present is common. Cytologic analysis of peritoneal fluid samples collected by abdominocentesis accurately predicted the presence of neoplasia in 11 of 25 cases in one study. 58 Cytologic examination of two or more peritoneal fluid samples increases the sensitivity of this test for detecting abdominal neoplasia. Measurement of peritoneal fluid glucose concentration and pH is valuable to differentiate inflammation in the peritoneum caused by neoplasia from bacterial peritonitis. Abdominal neoplasia typically is associated with peritoneal glucose concentrations similar to blood and pH higher than 7.3. D-xylose absorption tests can reveal malabsorptive diseases that include lymphoma. 42, 59 Immunoglobulin M deficiency is associated with lymphoma in some young adult horses, but the prevalence of immunoglobulin M deficiency in horses with lymphoma and the value of measuring serum immunoglobulin M concentrations for the diagnosis of lymphoma have not been evaluated. 60 DNA cell cycle analysis of suspect neoplastic cells has been used to detect lymphoma in equine patients confirmed with the disease. This method of evaluating fluid or tissues aspirates may increase the accuracy for diagnosing neoplasia in the future. 61 A complete evaluation of the oral cavity may include using a full-mouth speculum, radiographs, and endoscopy of the pharynx. Evaluation of the esophagus and stomach with a 3-m endoscope can reveal intralumenal masses. 11 Pleuroscopy has been used to obtain biopsy samples of extralumenal masses surrounding the esophagus. 49 Contrast radiography can assist in the diagnosis of neoplasia within the wall or outside of the esophagus. 49, 62 Ultrasonography of the stomach, small intestine, cecum, and large colon is useful in detecting intestinal wall thickness, abdominal masses, and excessive peritoneal fluid. 63 Identification of neoplasia in the liver, kidney or spleen may support metastasis to other parts of the gastrointestinal tract or lymph nodes.

The tumor grows on a stalk that wraps around the intestine, causing a strangulating lesion manifested clinically by acute obstructive colic. Intestinal injury caused by pedunculated lipomata may occur in the small intestine, small colon, and rectum. Long-term survival with surgical resection and anastomosis of the affected segment has been reported to be 40% to 50%. 26, 74 ORAL NEOPLASIA Oral cavity neoplasia may involve the dental tissue (odontogenic tumors), bone (osteogenic tumors), or soft tissues (see Box 13.16-1). Ameloblastoma occurs in horses greater than 10 years old and mainly affects the mandible. Ameloblastic odontoma affects younger horses and usually involves the maxilla. Both are benign but locally invasive. Radiographs may distinguish the difference between an ameloblastoma (radiolucent lesion) and ameloblastic odontoma (radiolucent lesion with partially mineralized density). The best treatment option is surgical resection and radiation therapy regardless of the type. 48 Juvenile mandibular ossifying fibroma occurs in the rostral mandible of young horses between the ages of 2 months and 2 years. The fibroma may cause significant distortion of the bone. With early diagnosis and surgical excision of the mass, the horse has a good prognosis. 75 Melanomas, sarcoids, and oral papilloma occur on the mouth and lips. Melanomas rarely metastasize, but they commonly are found in the parotid salivary glands and lymph nodes. Sarcoids are the most common skin tumor that can involve the mouth. Ulcerations of the buccal mucosa are difficult to treat. Intralesional cisplatin, cryosurgery, radiation, and laser excision have been tried with limited success. 5 Equine papilloma virus is responsible for the common skin wart found on the lips and muzzle of young horses. These lesions are usually selflimiting but may be removed successfully by cryosurgery or excision.",

[1] [2] [3] [4] [5] The peritoneum consists of a single layer of mesothelial cells lining the peritoneal cavity and serosal surfaces of the intraabdominal viscera. The mesothelial lining of the diaphragm, abdominal walls, and pelvic cavity is termed parietal peritoneum. The visceral peritoneum includes the serosal surfaces of the intraabdominal organs. The parietal and visceral portions of the peritoneum are contiguous with each other through the omentum, mesenteries, and ligaments. Caudally, the peritoneum reflects over the surfaces of the pelvic organs (portions of the urogenital tract and rectum), excluding them from the peritoneal space, and thus much of the pelvic cavity and contents are described as retroperitoneal. The peritoneal space communicates with the lumen of the uterus (and thus the external environment) via the fallopian tubes in females. In males the peritoneum forms a true blind sac. The vascular supply and nervous innervation of the visceral peritoneum are supplied by the splanchnic vessels and visceral autonomic nerves, respectively. Branches of the intercostal, lumbar, and iliac arteries supply the parietal peritoneum, and the phrenic and intercostal nerves provide nervous innervation. The clinical relevance is that inflammation of the parietal peritoneum is perceived as somatic pain, resulting in a splinted abdominal wall, pain on external palpation, and reluctance to move. Visceral pain is mediated by small type C sensory fibers, which are believed to be stimulated by bowel distention, smooth muscle spasms, tension on the mesentery, and ischemia.",

The peritoneal surface maintains a high level of fibrinolytic activity through the production of plasminogen activators by mesothelial cells. This function, together with the lubricant properties of the peritoneal fluid, helps to maintain gliding surfaces within the peritoneum and prevent adhesion formation. In quadrupeds, peritoneal fluid produced by the mesothelium tends to move ventrally and cranially, aided largely by diaphragmatic movement. Peritoneal fluid, waste products, and foreign material (including bacteria) exit the peritoneal cavity to enter the lymphatic system through diffusely distributed subendothelial pores or via the large diaphragmatic stomata, depending on particle size. Large molecules and particles greater than approximately 40,000 MW (such as bacteria) exit through the diaphragmatic stomata and ultimately enter the thoracic duct.",

[1] [2] [3] [4] Any process resulting in disruption or irritation of the peritoneal lining, inflammation or infection of abdominal organs, or compromise of the intestinal wall can result in peritonitis (Box 13.17-1). Common mechanical injuries include blunt or perforating trauma to the abdominal wall, breeding and foaling accidents, and abdominal surgery. A variety of traumatic insults of iatrogenic origin can cause peritonitis, such as the pathogenesis of peritonitis as a series of stages, as reviewed and described by Trent, is useful. 2 The contamination stage, lasting 3 to 6 hours, involves introduction of bacteria into the peritoneum and initiation of the acute inflammatory response previously described. If the organisms are not eliminated and infection is established, the process evolves to the stage of acute diffuse peritonitis. Although the overall movement of contaminants is toward the diaphragmatic stomata and into the thoracic duct, the nature of the peritoneal circulation is such that regardless of the location of the initial contamination, bacteria spread throughout the peritoneum within several hours. The stage of acute diffuse peritonitis lasts up to 5 days. The inflammatory response persists and escalates with continued exudation of proteinaceous fluid and influx of inflammatory cells. Offending organisms are delivered to the lymphatic system and may be eliminated by the immune system. Organisms, however, may gain access to the systemic circulation in sufficient numbers to result in clinically relevant septicemia. In human beings and laboratory animals having undergone polymicrobial contamination of the peritoneum, the organisms causing septicemia at this stage are usually coliforms, E. coli in particular. This stage of the disease process has the highest mortality because of the effects of severe peritoneal inflammation, endotoxemia, and septicemia. If the animal survives this stage but fails to eliminate the infection in the peritoneal cavity, the disease enters a transitional phase referred to as the acute adhesive (or localizing) stage. This stage occupies a time frame of perhaps 4 to 10 days after the initial insult. Neutrophils are still active, macrophages are increasing in numbers, and fibrin aggregates are being organized or lysed. In human beings and laboratory animals, selective reduction and synergism continue such that anaerobes and gram-negative aerobes predominate. If infection persists beyond this point, organization of fibrin proceeds and organisms become isolated from host defenses. At this point, the disease process enters the stage of chronic abscessation. This stage can begin as early as 8 days after inoculation and persists indefinitely.",

In horses that have bowel disease accompanied by endotoxemia, the number of peritoneal mononuclear cells increases, as does transformation of mesothelial cells to macrophages. In chronic cases, one easily may mistake transforming mesothelial cells for neoplastic cells, which can make diagnosis difficult, particularly when the presenting problem is compatible with a neoplastic process. In such cases, consultation with a clinical pathologist regarding cytologic findings is prudent. factor, and interleukin-6 have been measured in the peritoneal fluid of horses with abdominal disorders, but the diagnostic and prognostic implications of the presence or absence of these enzymes and analytes is limited.

Obligate anaerobic bacteria such as Bacteroides are difficult to culture, because one must collect, transport, and culture the sample under strict anaerobic conditions. Frequently, bacterial cultures are negative when bacteria are present in peritoneal fluid. To enhance recovery of bacteria, one can inoculate peritoneal fluid into blood culture medium (Septi-Chek Columbia, Hoffmann-LaRoche Inc., Nutley, New Jersey), and if the horse has received antimicrobial treatment, one first should pass fluid through an antimicrobial removal device (A.R.D., Becton Dickinson & Co., Cockeysville, Maryland).",

Enterocentesis yields discolored fluid containing mixed microorganisms and plant material and that is largely devoid of white blood cells. Bacterial contamination of a sample can occur during collection of the sample, and iatrogenic contamination of a sample can result in free and intracellular bacteria in peritoneal fluid, particularly if processing is delayed. In such cases the bacterial numbers are few and the neutrophils appear healthy. In some cases of gastrointestinal perforation the luminal material, inflammatory cells, and protein may be sequestered by the omentum and further contained by fibrinous adhesions.

Streptococci potentially can be involved in mixed, synergistic peritoneal infections in horses. 2 Drainage or lavage of the peritoneal cavity may be of benefit in removing toxic bacterial by-products and products of inflammatory cells. 31 High numbers of inflammatory cells and release of their mediators can persist even after the primary stimulus of the inflammatory response has resolved. Infusing large volumes of isotonic, warmed fluid into the peritoneal cavity also dilutes the inflammatory mediators, possibly reducing their deleterious effects. When successful, peritoneal lavage decreases the peritoneal fluid WBC count and total protein, potentially reflecting a decrease in diffuse inflammation. The benefits of peritoneal lavage are controversial, and a positive effect may be more likely during the acute, diffuse stage of disease. 2, 4 Some studies suggest peritoneal lavage, along with heparin therapy, may reduce the incidence of adhesions. 2 One should perform peritoneal drainage and lavage using a drain of no less than 24F diameter. Foley-type catheters can be used, but \"mushroom\" drains provide a larger area for fluid to enter the drain.

Lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LPB) associates with lipopolysaccharide (LPS, endotoxin) and transfers it to the cellular surface, where lipopolysaccharide interacts with a receptor complex comprising CD14, Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), and MD-2. Toll-like receptor 4, but not CD14, possesses a transmembrane portion and allows signal transduction to the cytosol. Signaling via the mitogen-activated protein kinases including extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), c-Jun-terminal kinase (JNK), and p38 results in numerous alterations of cellular metabolism. Activation of I\u03baB-kinase (IKK) via sequential phosphorylation of myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88), interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK), tumor necrosis factor receptorassociated factor (TRAF 6), and NF\u03baB-inducing kinase (NIK) leads to phosphorylation, ubiquination, and degradation of I\u03baB and release of NF\u03baB. Transcription factors such as NF\u03baB translocate to the nucleus and promote gene transcription. See the text for further details and alternative pathways of cellular activation.",

Products that cause sudden ascarid death, including piperazine, organophosphates, and pyrantel pamoate, have been incriminated in triggering acute intestinal obstruction by dead parasites. Ascarids are particularly problematic because of the large size of the adult parasite (Figure 13.15-1). Clinical signs include acute onset of colic following administration of an anthelmintic and signs compatible with small intestinal obstruction, including nasogastric reflux. Occasionally, dead parasites are present in the reflux. The onset of the disease varies according to the degree of obstruction. One tentatively may base diagnosis on the history and signs referable to small intestinal obstruction. Abdominal radiographs may indicate the presence of multiple loops of distended small intestine but are not required if clinical signs indicate the immediate need for surgery. Initial medical treatment should include treatment of hypovolemic shock resulting from sequestration of fluid in the small intestine and systemic inflammation from absorption of endotoxin. Surgical treatment typically involves an enterotomy made over the intraluminal impaction and removal of ascarids. The prognosis is fair in horses that are rapidly and appropriately treated but poor in foals with evidence of hypovolemic and endotoxic shock.37",

            "text": "Although a number of potential causes of peritonitis exist, sepsis is a common and serious complication, and the identification and control of bacterial sepsis is critical for a successful outcome. Bowel leakage (as well as external trauma) results in contamination of the peritoneum with large numbers of many types of bacteria. The intestinal tract contains a mixed population of bacteria, and the quantity of bacteria and prevalence of anaerobic species increase in the distal segments. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] There are approximately 1 \u00d7 10 9 anaerobic and 1 \u00d7 10 5 aerobic bacteria per milliliter of cecal and colonic fluid, thus the potential for bacterial contamination of the peritoneum is great. High mortality is associated with contamination from the lower bowel because of the large numbers of bacteria present. 8 Hirsch and Jang 9 reported isolation of an infective agent from equine peritoneal fluid in approximately 25% of attempts. Obligate anaerobic bacteria were cultured most frequently, followed by members of the Enterobacteriaceae family (Escherichia coli). Penicillin-resistant Bacteroides fragilis was isolated from 10% to 20% of cases. In another study in which bacteria were identified in equine abdominal fluid by cytologic examination or culture, E. coli was the organism most commonly isolated. 10 In human beings and laboratory animals the well-established fact is that despite the variety of organisms initially introduced subsequent to these events, established infections are characterized by only a few types of bacteria, which are often gram-negative aerobes and anaerobic bacteria. 2 This selectivity occurs through the processes of selective reduction of bacterial populations and bacterial synergism. A well-known example of synergism in human beings and laboratory animals is peritonitis involving E. coli and B. fragilus. The presence of each organism is beneficial to the survival of the other, and each is important in the overall pathogenesis of the disease. E. coli is associated with septicemia and early mortality, whereas B. fragilis infection tends to result in chronic abscessation with delayed morbidity and mortality. Some evidence suggests that in horses, in addition to coliforms and anaerobes, streptococci and perhaps C. psuedotuberculosis may survive selective reduction and participate in synergistic infection following polymicrobial contamination.Biologic events resulting from contamination of the abdomen or injury to the mesothelial cells have been described [1] [2] [3] [4] and include release of catecholamines, histamine, and serotonin from peritoneal mast cells; vasodilation and hyperemia; increase in peritoneal vascular permeability; secretion of protein-rich fluid into the peritoneum; transformation of mesothelial cells into macrophages; and influx of polymorphonuclear cells, humoral opsonins, natural antibodies, and serum complement into the peritoneal cavity. Additionally, depression of the peritoneal fibrinolytic activity, fibrin deposits on the peritoneal surface, and sympathetic-mediated ileus of the gastrointestinal tract can occur.These processes benefit the animal by confining contamination and infection, and indeed, with clean, minimally invasive procedures such as enterocentesis or trocharization, this is effective. However, with greater severity of peritoneal contamination or irritation, these processes are magnified and become deleterious, resulting in problems such as hypovolemia, hypoproteinemia, ileus with resultant bowel distention, ischemia of the bowel wall with subsequent absorption of bacteria and toxins, and ultimately adhesion and abscess formation. Additionally, systemic responses to bacterial toxins, particularly lipopolysaccharide, 11, 12 can compromise the metabolic condition of the patient further. Equine peritoneal macrophages release several mediators when exposed to bacterial lipopolysaccharide, 13 undoubtedly an important component of septic peritonitis.Pathologic description of peritonitis includes origin (primary or secondary), onset (peracute, acute, chronic), distribution (localized versus diffuse), and presence of bacteria (septic versus nonseptic). 3, 4 Clinically, viewing",
