Joo et al., 1996, J. Virol. 70, 5769-5776). However, the expressed negative-strand DI RNA transcripts are poor templates for positive-strand DI RNA synthesis. The present study demonstrated that DI RNA accumulation from the expressed negative-strand DI RNA transcripts in MHVinfected cells was enhanced by the coexpression of complementary RNA transcripts that correspond to the 5\u0408 region of positive-strand DI RNA. The positive-strand RNA transcripts corresponding to the 5\u0408 end-most 0.7-2.0 kb DI RNA had a similar enhancement effect. The coexpressed positive-strand RNA transcripts lacking the leader sequence or those containing only the leader sequence failed to demonstrate this enhancement effect, demonstrating that the presence of the leader sequence in the coexpressed positive-strand RNA transcripts was necessary, but not sufficient, for the enhancement of DI RNA accumulation from the coexpressed negative-strand DI RNA transcripts. Negative-strand DI RNA transcripts that were coexpressed with the partial-length positive-strand RNA transcripts were no more stable than those expressed alone, suggesting that a higher stability of the expressed negative-strand RNA transcripts was an unlikely reason for the higher DI RNA accumulation in cells coexpressing two complementary DI RNA transcripts. Sequence analyses unexpectedly demonstrated that the leader sequence of the majority of accumulated DI RNAs switched to helper virus derived leader sequence, suggesting that enhancement of DI RNA accumulation was mediated by the efficient utilization of helper virus derived leader sequence for DI RNA synthesis. Furthermore, our data suggested that this leader switching, a type of homologous RNA-RNA recombination, occurred during positive-strand DI RNA synthesis and that MHV positive-strand RNA synthesis mechanism may have a preference toward recognizing double-stranded RNA structures over single-stranded negative-strand RNA to produce positive-strand DI RNAs.",

            "text": "Murine coronavirus, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) is a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus, approximately 31 kb in length (Bonilla et al., 1994; Lai and Stohlman, 1978; Lee et al., 1991; Pachuk et al., 1989) . MHV-infected cells generate seven to eight species of virus-specific mRNAs whose sequences comprise a 3\u0408 coterminal nested set structure (Lai et al., 1981; Leibowitz et al., 1981) . The mRNAs are numbered 1 to 7 in decreasing order of size (Lai et al., 1981; Leibowitz et al., 1981) . MHV particles carry only mRNA 1 and only mRNA 1 contains a packaging signal (Fosmire et al., 1992; van der Most et al., 1991) . At their 5\u0408 ends all the mRNAs are fused to a 72-to 77-nucleotide-long leader sequence (Lai et al., 1984a Spaan et al., 1983) . MHV mRNA body sequences begin from a transcription consensus sequence in the intergenic region that is located upstream of each gene (Lai et al., 1984a Makino et al., 1988b; Spaan et al., 1983) . Genomic-size and subgenomic-size negative-strand RNAs are present in coronavirus-infected cells in amounts that are significantly lower than the amounts of corresponding positive-strand RNAs (Sethna et al., 1989) . Two independent studies showed that nascent leader sequence-containing MHV subgenomic mRNAs are elongating on a genomic-length replicative-intermediate RNA containing a genomiclength negative-strand RNA late in infection Mizutani et al., 2000) . The genomic-length negative-strand RNA also serves as a template for subgenomic mRNA synthesis early in infection . These studies established that the negativestrand genomic RNA is a template for MHV subgenomic mRNA synthesis and that leader sequence joins to the body of subgenomic RNA during subgenomic mRNA synthesis. It has been proposed that negative-strand subgenomic RNAs also serve as templates for sub-genomic mRNA synthesis in coronavirus (Baric and Yount, 2000; Sawicki et al., 2001; Sawicki and Sawicki, 1990; Sethna et al., 1989) and related arterivirus (van Marle et al., 1999) .",

Transfection of in vitro synthesized DI RNA transcripts into helper virus infected cells results in DI RNA replication (Makino and Lai, 1989b) . Expression of DI RNAs, in helper virus infected cells, using a recombinant T7 vaccinia virus expression system, also results in DI RNA replication (Lin and Lai, 1993) . Three discontiguous regions are required for replication of DI RNAs derived from the JHM strain of MHV (MHV-JHM); these regions are derived from the 5\u0408 end 0.47-kb of DI RNA, an internal 58 nt-long region (internal cis-acting replication signal) corresponding to 0.9 kb from the 5\u0408 end of DI RNA and the 3\u0408 end 0.46 kb of DI RNA (Kim and Makino, 1995; Lin and Lai, 1993; Repass and Makino, 1998) . Among these three regions, only the 3\u0408-end 55 nucleotides plus a poly(A) tail are necessary for negative-strand RNA synthesis (Lin et al., 1994) . In MHV-JHM DI RNAs, the secondary structure of the internal cis-acting replication signal of positivestrand RNA is important for positive-strand RNA synthesis (Repass and Makino, 1998) .",

            "text": "Coronavirus DI RNAs have two unique biological properties that are not described in other DI RNAs of positivestrand RNA viruses. One is leader switching, in which the leader sequence of the DI RNA switches to the leader sequence of helper virus with a high efficiency during DI RNA replication (Makino and Lai, 1989b) . The 3\u0408 region of the leader sequence of MHV genomic RNA contains two to four repeats of an UCUAA sequence (Makino and Lai, 1989a; Makino et al., 1988b) (Fig. 1A) . Immediately downstream of this pentanucleotide repeat is a nine-nucleotide sequence of UUUAUAAAC, which is found in most MHVs (Makino and Lai, 1989a; Makino et al., 1988b) (Fig.  1A ). All naturally occurring MHV DI RNAs characterized so far contain three to four repeats of UCUAA and lack the nine-nucleotide sequence (Makino et al., 1985 (Makino et al., , 1988a . When MHV DI RNAs containing the nine-nucleotide sequence are constructed and transfected into MHV-infected cells, the leader sequence of DI RNA switches to that of helper virus with a very high efficiency, while this leader switching does not occur in DI RNAs lacking the nine-nucleotide sequence (Makino and Lai, 1989b) . Leader switching is also found in bovine coronavirus (BCV) DI RNAs (Chang et al., 1996) and infectious bronchitis virus (Stirrups et al., 2000) . Leader switching occurs during the rescue of defective RNAs by heterologous strains of the coronavirus infectious bron-chitis virus. The mechanism of leader switching is not known. We have speculated that leader switching occurs during positive-strand DI RNA synthesis (Makino and Lai, 1989b) , while others have speculated that it may occur during negative-strand DI RNA synthesis (Chang et al., 1996) .",

MHV DI RNA replicates extremely efficiently after transfection of positive-strand DI RNAs into MHV-infected cells (Makino and Lai, 1989b) , whereas several passages of virus sample are necessary to demonstrate DI RNA replication after transfection of large amounts of negativestrand DI RNA transcripts (Joo et al., 1996) . We do not know why expressed or transfected negative-strand DI RNAs are poor templates. Most of the expressed negative-strand DI RNAs probably exist as single-stranded RNAs in MHV-infected cells, while it has been suggested that MHV negative-strand RNAs do not exist as singlestranded RNAs but associate with positive-strand RNAs (Lin et al., 1994; Sawicki and Sawicki, 1986) . Therefore we speculated that negative-strand DI RNAs may be poor templates for positive-strand DI RNA synthesis since they are probably present as single-stranded RNA species in MHV-infected cells (Joo et al., 1996) .",

We expected a certain population of the coexpressed RNA transcripts to form ds RNA structures using complementary sequences. If negative-strand DI RNA, in such a ds RNA structure, is a better template for positive-strand DI RNA synthesis, then the amount of DI RNA in coexpressing cells might be higher than that in cells expressing negative-strand DI RNA transcripts alone. If full-length positive-strand DI RNA and full-length negative-strand DI RNA are coexpressed, accumulated DI RNAs should be derived from both expressed template RNAs, since DI RNA synthesis starts from both expressed positivestrand transcripts (Lin and Lai, 1993) and expressed negative-strand DI RNA transcripts (Joo et al., 1996) . To identify DI RNAs that were initially synthesized from the expressed negative-strand DI RNA transcripts, nucleotide sequences at a specific region of positive-strand DI RNA transcripts were mutated, whereas the corresponding region in the negative-strand DI RNA had no such mutation. DI RNAs that were initially synthesized from the expressed negative-strand DI RNA transcripts should be detected using an oligonucleotide probe that specifically hybridized with the sequence specific for the expressed negative-strand DI RNA.",

DIU had 11 nucleotides substituted within the unique 30-nt region from nucleotide 487 to 516 (Fig. 1B) of the naturally occurring MHV-JHM DI RNA, DIssE (Makino et al., 1988a ). First, we tested the feasibility of using DIU for coexpression studies. DIU was transfected into cells infected with recombinant vaccinia virus, vTF7-3, which expresses the T7 polymerase (Fuerst et al., 1986) . Four hours after DIU transfection, cells were infected with MHV-A59 and intracellular RNA was extracted 10 h postinfection (pi) of MHV. To test if the accumulated DI RNA maintained the unique 30-nt region, we performed Northern blot analysis of intracellular RNA using probe 3 (Fig. 1B, Table 1 ), which specifically hybridizes with the unique 30-nt region of DIU, and probe 1 (Fig. 1C , Table 1 ), which specifically hybridizes with the corresponding region of wild-type (wt) sequence (wt 30-nt region). Stringent conditions were set up for the oligonucleotide probe binding to the specific DI RNAs such that probe 1 did not hybridize with in vitro synthesized DIU at all, and probe 3 did not hybridize with in vitro synthesized positive-sense RNA containing the wt 30-nt region. We found that approximately half the accumulated DI RNAs contained the wt 30-nt region, and the rest contained the unique 30-nt region (data not shown). RNA recombination between helper virus and the replicating DI RNAs most probably caused the accumulation of DI RNA containing wt 30-nt region. Generation and accumulation of DI RNA containing wt 30-nt region after expression of DIU indicated that we could not easily identify the origin of the accumulated DI RNA containing wt 30-nt region, after coexpression of DIU and negativestrand DI RNA transcripts, containing wt 30-nt region. Thus DIU was not suitable for cotransfection studies.",

            "text": "Next we examined whether DI RNA synthesis from negative-strand DI RNA transcripts is enhanced by the coexpression of a positive-strand RNA fragment that contains only the 5\u0408 region of the DI RNA. We hoped that the partial-length positive-strand DI RNA transcripts would hybridize with the 3\u0408 region of the expressed negative-strand DI RNA transcripts to create a ds RNA region which would promote efficient positive-strand DI RNA synthesis. Four DIU-derived clones, DIU-Nru, DIU- Spe, DIU-Sph, and DIU-Eag, were constructed, which had a 2.0-, 1.5-, 1.0-, and 0.7-kb-long 5\u0408-end region of DIU, respectively (Fig. 1B ). All these clones contained the unique 30-nt region and their RNA transcripts should not replicate since they all lack the 3\u0408 cis-acting replication signal (Kim et al., 1993a; Lin et al., 1994) . Northern blot analysis using probe 1 showed that DI RNA, containing the wt 30-nt region, did not accumulate after expression of any of these DIU-derived clones in MHV-infected cells (see Fig. 2 , lanes 10 and 11 for DIU-Spe; data not shown for other clones), demonstrating that the expressed transcripts did not undergo RNA recombination to produce full-length DI RNA containing the wt 30-nt region. These clones were suitable for subsequent studies. Plasmid pDER was used to express negative-strand DI RNA transcripts (Joo et al., 1996) . In this plasmid, the DI-specific sequence was placed between the T7 promoter and T7 terminator such that T7 RNA polymerasemediated transcription produced negative-strand DI RNA transcripts, containing the wt 30-nt region (Fig. 1C ). Equal amounts of pDER plasmid and each of the DIU-derived plasmids, encoding the partial-length positivestrand DI RNA transcripts, were mixed and transfected into vTF7-3-infected cells. In a control group, pDER was mixed with equal amounts of plasmid pS5A (Woo et al., 1997) , which encodes the chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) gene and no MHV-specific sequences ( Fig.  1D ) and then transfected. Total amount of DNA used for all the transfections was the same. DNA-transfected cells were infected with MHV and intracellular RNAs were extracted 10 h post-MHV infection. Northern blot analysis using probe 1 showed that in all cases DI RNAs containing the wt 30-nt region accumulated significantly higher in cells coexpressing pDER and positive-strand RNA fragments than in cells expressing pDER alone. Representative data from these experiments using pDER and DIU-Spe are shown in Fig. 2 . Since these DI RNAs contained the wt 30-nt region, they were most likely synthesized initially from the pDER transcripts. We performed these experiments at least five times for all DIUderived clones and obtained consistent results (data not shown). Although the enhancement effect differed slightly from experiment to experiment, phosphorimaging analysis of the membranes and densitometric analysis of autoradiograms showed that the level of enhancement was between 10-and 15-fold. There was no significant difference in the enhancement effect between the four DIU-derived positive-strand RNA fragments (data not shown). Additional bands that migrated between mRNA 1 and the expected DI RNA in Fig. 2 probably represented other MHV DI RNAs present in the MHV-A59 virus stock. Time-course experiments showed that this enhancement of DI RNA accumulation was evident from 6-12 h pi of MHV and that the best enhancement effect was obtained 10 h post-MHV infection (data not shown). Hence we chose this time point to extract intracellular RNA for subsequent experiments. Cotransfecting three-, six-, and ninefold excess DIU-derived positive-strand RNA fragments with a constant amount of pDER did not alter the enhancement effect significantly (data not shown).",

Such ds RNAs may be more resistant to endogenous RNase degradation than single-stranded RNAs. In that case negative-strand DI RNA coexpressed with DIUderived partial-length positive-strand transcripts might have a higher stability than the negative-strand DI RNAs expressed alone. Therefore, enhancement of accumulating positive-strand DI RNAs may be due to such an increased stability of the negative-strand DI RNA template. To test whether negative-strand DI RNA transcripts in cells coexpressing both transcripts were more stable than those in cells expressing negative-strand DI RNA transcripts alone, vTF7-3-infected cells were cotransfected with pDER and PS5A or with pDER and DIU-Spe. Intracellular RNAs were extracted at 5 and 9 h posttransfection. Northern blot analysis using probe 2, which specifically hybridized with pDER transcripts (Fig. 1C) , showed that the amounts of pDER transcripts were slightly lower in cells coexpressing pDER and DIU-Spe transcripts than those expressing pDER transcripts and pS5A transcripts (Fig. 3) . The mechanism of a slightly lower amount of pDER transcripts in coexpressing cells is unknown. Similar stability of pDER4 was observed in cells expressing pDER4 and pS5A and pDER4 and DIU-Spe (data not shown). These results were consistently observed in three independent experiments. Since both pDER and pDER4 RNA transcripts in cells coexpressing two DI RNA transcripts were no more stable than those in cells expressing pDER and pDER4 transcripts alone, a higher stability of the expressed negative-strand RNA transcripts was an unlikely reason for the higher DI RNA accumulation in cells coexpressing two complementary DI RNA transcripts.",

These data are consistent with our previous study which showed DI RNAs that accumulated after transfection of in vitro synthesized pDER4 transcripts maintain the DI-specific leader sequence (Joo et al., 1996) . The rest of the clones from pDER4-expressing cells contained the helper virus leader sequence; all of these clones lacked the nine-nucleotide sequence, demonstrating that about one-third of accumulated DI RNAs underwent leader switching upstream of the nine-nucleotide sequence. In contrast to the data obtained from pDER4-expressing cells, all of the accumulated DI RNAs from pDER-expressing cells contained helper virus derived leader sequence; leader switching occurred downstream of the nine-nucleotide sequence in half the DI RNAs and upstream of the nine-nucleotide sequence in the rest of the DI RNAs. These sequence analyses demonstrated that leader switching occurred in DI RNAs lacking the nine-nucleotide sequence when negativestrand DI RNA transcripts were expressed alone. These were unexpected results, because leader switching does not occur after transfection of positive-strand DI RNA lacking the nine-nucleotide sequence (Makino and Lai, 1989b) .",

Consequently, we expected that DI RNA accumulation from expressed negative-strand DI RNA transcripts containing the nine-nucleotide sequence to be higher than that from expressed negative-strand DI RNA transcripts lacking the nine-nucleotide sequence. We tested this possibility by expressing pDER\u03e99, which is a negative-strand DI RNA transcript containing the nine-nucleotide sequence (Fig. 1C) .

We found that DI RNA accumulation, in cells coexpressing negative-strand DI RNA transcripts and complementary partial-length positive-strand DI RNAs, ranging from 0.7 to 2.0 kb, was greatly enhanced than in cells expressing negative-strand DI RNA transcripts alone. This finding implies that MHV RNA synthesis machinery preferentially recognizes and uses negative-strand RNA templates, that may exist in a ds form, over single-stranded negative-strand RNA templates, for positive-strand RNA synthesis (see further discussion below). Presence of the leader sequence in the partiallength positive-strand DI RNA transcripts was necessary, but not sufficient, for this enhancement effect.

            "text": "Sequencing data indicated that all accumulated DI RNAs from pDER-expressing cells contained helper virus leader sequence (Table 2) . These results were unex- pected, because positive-strand MHV DI RNAs, lacking the nine-nucleotide sequence, do not undergo leader switching after transfection into MHV-infected cells; leader switching occurs only after transfection of positive-strand DI RNA transcripts containing the nine-nucleotide sequence (Makino and Lai, 1989b) . If initiation of positive-strand DI RNA synthesis occurred de novo from the expressed negative-strand pDER transcripts, fulllength positive-strand DI RNAs, that are faithful copies of pDER transcripts, should have been synthesized; these full-length positive-strand DI RNAs should not contain the nine-nucleotide sequence. In that case, leader switching should not happen during subsequent DI RNA replication. Therefore, our finding that most of the DI RNAs underwent leader switching in pDER-expressing cells indicated that de novo initiation of positive-strand DI RNA synthesis did not occur from pDER transcripts. Instead, helper virus derived leader sequence was most likely used to initiate positive-strand DI RNA synthesis from the expressed pDER transcripts (Fig. 7) . Hence, we speculate that leader switching is the first event that occurs during the initiation of DI RNA synthesis from pDER transcripts. This speculation was further supported by the finding that DI RNA accumulation in cells expressing negative-strand DI RNA transcripts, pDER\u03e99, containing the nine-nucleotide sequence, was higher than that in cells expressing pDER lacking the ninenucleotide sequence. Our interpretation is that the helper virus derived leader sequence was used very efficiently for positive-strand DI RNA synthesis from the expressed negative-strand DI RNA transcripts containing the nine-nucleotide sequence. Chang et al. (1996) proposed a coronavirus DI RNA leader switching model. Their model states that when nascent negative-strand DI RNA, which is elongating on positive-strand DI RNA, reaches near the 3\u0408 region of the (1) Positive-strand DI RNA synthesis from expressed pDER or pDER4 transcripts. Presence of four extra non-MHV nucleotides at the very 3\u0408 end of pDER4 transcripts (small black rectangle) allows the MHV-specific RNA polymerase to load onto the negative-strand RNA template and de novo initiation of positive-strand DI RNA synthesis occurs. Alternatively, the secondary or tertiary structure, formed by the four extra non-MHV nucleotides at the 3\u0408 end of pDER4, prevents the efficient use of the helper virus derived leader sequence. pDER, missing the four extra non-MHV nucleotides, allows helper virus derived leader to efficiently prime positive-strand DI RNA synthesis. (2) Positive-strand DI RNA synthesis from expressed pDER or pDER4 transcripts coexpressed with partial-length positive-strand DI RNA transcripts. When partial-length positive-strand DI RNA transcripts are coexpressed with either pDER or pDER4 transcripts, the two complementary DI RNAs probably form a ds RNA structure at the 3\u0408 end of the negative-strand template. Such a putative ds structure is favorably recognized by the MHV RNA synthesizing machinery and promotes efficient loading of the helper virus derived leader sequence and the MHV-specific RNA polymerase. Leader switching preferentially occurs when negative-strand DI RNA templates, along with coexpressed complementary positive-strand DI RNA fragments, form a ds RNA structure at the 3\u0408 end of the template. The solid black lines represent full-length negative-strand DI RNA transcripts, while the open rectangle represents partial-length positive-strand DI RNA fragments. The shaded box represents helper virus derived leader RNA. The open ellipse represents the MHV-specific RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. The small black rectangle represents the four extra non-MHV nucleotides present in pDER4. leader sequence of the positive-strand DI RNA temple, it switches the template from positive-strand DI RNA to helper virus positive-strand genomic RNA. After template switch, the nascent negative-strand DI RNA continues RNA elongation to the 5\u0408 end of helper virus positivestrand genomic RNA. The template switching during negative-strand DI RNA synthesis results in the acquisition of helper virus derived leader in the full-length negative-strand DI RNA, which then is used as a template for subsequent DI RNA replication. This model predicts that positive-strand DI RNAs lacking the nine-nucleotide sequence are produced from negative-strand pDER RNA transcripts prior to leader switching. If positive-strand DI RNAs lacking the nine-nucleotide sequence are produced from negative-strand pDER RNA transcripts, then they should not undergo leader switching; leader switching does not occur after transfection of the positivestrand DI RNA lacking the nine-nucleotide (Makino and Lai, 1989b) . The finding that the majority of accumulated DI RNA in cells expressing pDER underwent leader switching (Table 2) suggests that positive-strand DI RNA lacking the nine-nucleotide was not produced from the expressed pDER negative-strand RNA transcripts. Thus, a leader switching model, in which leader switching occurs during the initial positive-strand DI RNA synthesis from the expressed negative-strand pDER transcripts, is consistent with the existing data.",

It is possible that the mechanism of synthesis of CAT mRNA, containing the 5\u0408-end TGEV leader sequence, and that of leader switching in pDER transcripts is similar. The 3\u0408 end of coronavirus genomic leader and the intergenic region share an identical or near identical sequence. In MHV, both regions have a transcription consensus sequence, UCUAAAC, which is essential for MHV subgenomic mRNA synthesis (Makino et al., 1991) . It is quite likely that the coronavirus RNA synthesis machinery recognizes this transcription consensus sequence present in the leader, in the expressed negative-strand DI RNA (present study), or in the intergenic sequence of TGEV negative-strand RNA, containing the CAT gene (Hiscox et al., 1995) , and produces positive-strand RNA, using a trans-acting helper virus derived leader RNA as a primer. Leader switching is a type of homologous RNA recombination. If our speculation about the mechanism of leader switching is correct, then efficient homologous RNA recombination occurs during positive-strand DI RNA synthesis in coronavirusinfected cells, while in many positive-strand RNA viruses, it has been considered that RNA recombination seems to occur during negative-strand RNA synthesis (Lai, 1992) . Two-thirds of the accumulated DI RNAs contained DI-specific leader sequence in pDER4-expressing cells. This result was consistent with our previous study, in which most of the DI RNAs that accumulated after transfection of in vitro synthesized pDER4 transcripts into MHV-infected cells retained their leader sequences (Joo et al., 1996) . This data indicated that positive-strand DI RNA was synthesized de novo from the expressed pDER4 transcripts. Since the only difference between pDER4 and pDER is the presence of four extra non-MHV nucleotides at the very 3\u0408 end of pDER4, the presence of these extra nucleotides was crucial for the de novo initiation of positive-strand DI RNA (see Fig. 7) . The secondary or tertiary RNA structure at the very 3\u0408 end of pDER4 and pDER transcripts may be different, and the structure formed by pDER4 transcripts may be more suitable for the de novo initiation of positive-strand DI RNAs. Alternatively, the presence of the extra non-MHV nucleotides at the very 3\u0408 end of pDER4 may prevent efficient use of helper virus derived leader sequence for priming of positive-strand DI RNA synthesis.",

This finding suggests that there was an interaction between the two expressed transcripts. We speculate that the partial-length positive-strand RNA transcripts hybridized with the coexpressed negative-strand DI RNA transcripts, forming a partial ds RNA structure at the 3\u0408 region of negative-strand transcripts. It is possible that coronavirus positive-strand RNA synthesis machinery may preferentially recognize coronavirus ds RNA structures over single-stranded RNA species. This speculation seems to be reasonable, since most of the coronavirus negative-strand RNAs appear to be present in a ds RNA form (Lin et al., 1994; Sawicki and Sawicki, 1986) . The present study is the first indication that MHV RNA synthesis machinery preferentially recognizes and uses negative-strand RNA templates that exist in a ds form over single-stranded negative-strand RNA templates for subgenomic mRNA synthesis. In contrast, genomic-size negative-strand coronavirus RNA is synthesized from the incoming genomic RNA, implying that coronavirus negative-strand RNA synthesis machinery probably recognizes single-stranded positive-sense RNA templates to copy negative-strand RNAs.",

These data demonstrated that leader switching occurred efficiently in cells coexpressing negativestrand DI RNA transcripts and partial-length positivestrand DI RNA transcripts. A straightforward interpretation of these data is that a partial ds RNA structure at the 3\u0408 region of negative-strand transcripts promoted efficient leader switching (see Fig. 7 ). We attempted to detect the presence of such ds RNA structures in cells coexpressing negative-strand DI RNA with partial-length positive-strand DI RNA transcripts, by amplifying RNaseresistant RNA fragments by RT-PCR. However, we could not detect the presence of the expected ds RNA structures after RNase digestion of intracellular RNAs. Probably our experimental conditions were not sensitive enough to detect very low amounts of the ds RNAs that are present in coexpressing cells.",

Although we do not know why DI RNA accumulation was inhibited in cells coexpressing pDER and DIU-Spe\u232cleader (see Fig. 4 ), it is possible that MHV polymerase recognizes a specific secondary structure at the very 3\u0408 end of the template RNA, which when absent in the DIU-Spe\u232cleader coexpression system, does not allow loading of the polymerase or blocks the movement of the polymerase along the expressed negative-strand DI RNA transcript.

Although further studies are required to clarify the mechanism of the joining of leader sequence to the 5\u0408 end of subgenomic mRNA during subgenomic mRNA synthesis, it was proposed that the leader sequence is used as a primer for subgenomic mRNA synthesis (leader-primed transcription) Lai et al., 1984b) . Alternatively, after synthesis of the genomic leader sequence, which is present at the 5\u0408 end of the genomic RNA, RNA polymerase carrying the leader sequence may jump to the intergenic region to resume subgenomic mRNA synthesis. In both cases, temporal unwinding of the inter-genic regions within the ds RNA structure is necessary for the RNA polymerase to recognize the negative-strand template RNA and synthesize subgenomic mRNAs. It is possible that the same (or similar) mechanism that is used to initiate subgenomic mRNA transcription at the intergenic region in the genome-length replicative intermediate RNA may mediate efficient leader switching on the expressed negative-strand DI RNA transcripts that are hybridized with the coexpressed partial-length positive-strand DI RNA transcripts.",

MHV DI RNA lacking the nine-nucleotide sequence do not undergo leader switching (Makino and Lai, 1989b) , indicating that most of the time positive-strand DI RNA synthesis is a faithful copying of the template strand through a continuous replication mechanism.

The resulting clone DE2C contained the T7 promoter, the complete sequence of DIssE, and the T7 terminator. To create the unique 30-nt region, a 0.8-kb PCR product was generated by incubating DE2C with oligonucleotides 10239 and 10134. The PCR product was digested with StuI-SphI to yield a 0.6-kb fragment which was inserted into the 4.1-kb StuI-SphI fragment of DE2C, resulting in DIU. DIU contained an in-frame noncontiguous 11-nucleotide mutation from nucleotides 487 to 516 (unique 30-nt region) from the 5\u0408 end of DE2C. DIU-Nru, DIU-Spe, DIU-Sph, and DIU-Eag were constructed by removing DIssE-specific sequence plus poly(A) sequence from DIU at 1.95, 1.49, 1.09, and 0.7 kb from the 5\u0408 end, respectively. To generate the clone DI-Spe\u232cleader another DIssE-derived clone MRE (Kim et al., 1993a) was used since it has an EcoRV site just downstream of the leader sequence. A 1.4-kb EcoRV-SphI fragment of MRE, which had the leader sequence deleted up to 92 nucleotides from the 5\u0408 end of DIssE, was inserted into the EcoRV site of pT7ET-1, yielding DI-Spe\u232cleader. To insert the unique 30-nt region, a 0.8-kb PCR product was generated by incubating DI-Spe\u232cleader with oligonucleotides 10239 and 10134. The PCR product was digested with StuI-SphI to yield a 0.6-kb fragment which was inserted into the 4.1-kb StuI-SphI fragment of DI-Spe\u232cleader resulting in DIU-Spe\u232cleader. To create the clones, DIU-leader and DIUleader (4R), 310 and 336 nt PCR products were obtained after incubation of DIU with oligonucleotides 10683 and 2326 and 10682 and 2326, respectively. Insertion of the former PCR products and the latter PCR products, into a 2.2-kb NdeI-XbaI fragment of pT7-4 clone, containing the T7 promoter and T7 terminator, resulted in DIUleader and DIU-leader (4R), respectively. Insertion of a 1.3-kb StuI-SspI fragment of DIU-Spe into the 2.7-kb StuI-SspI fragment of DE107-w4 (Makino and Lai, 1989b) resulted in the production of DIU-Spe\u03e99.

Probe 3 specifically hybridized with the positive-strand RNA of the unique 30-nt region (Table 1) . Hybridization was carried out at 55\u00b0C for 16 h. Densitometric analysis of each autoradiogram was performed to determine the fold increase in the band intensities. The fold increase in the accumulation of positive-strand RNA was calculated as the ratio of the signal from samples coexpressing full-length negative-strand DI RNA and partial-length positive-strand DI RNA over the signal from samples expressing negative-strand DI RNA alone. The genome-length mRNA 1 levels were normalized for calculating the fold increase.",
