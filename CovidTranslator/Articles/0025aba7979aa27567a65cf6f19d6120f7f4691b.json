            "text": "Public health, unlike medicine, is not about doctors treating individual patients. Public health is about population health. It is a collective social effort to promote health and prevent diseases -both communicable and noncommunicable -and disability that involves population surveillance, regulation of determinants of health (such as food safety and sanitation), and the provision of key health services with an emphasis on prevention. Because private actors lack sufficient incentive and ability to undertake population-wide measures, public health is a vital resource for which government is the crucial provider, enabled by its police powers and its ability to regulate, tax, and spend. The exercise of government powers for the health of its population raises ethical issues, such as public welfare, individual autonomy and freedom, privacy and confidentiality, just distribution of benefits and burdens, transparency, and public accountability. These ethical concerns sometimes conflict, pitting values against one another. How they should be balanced will vary on a case-by-case basis. This article discusses justifications for government action in public health, the tension between individual freedom and public health, issues of distributive justice in public health, and ethical guidelines for public health policymaking.",

In a utilitarian sense, its goal is to maximize public welfare through the protection and promotion of population health. From a consequentialist point of view, public health policies are justified and judged largely by their outcomes, achieved by means of acceptable procedures. Public health measures seek to minimize harm from communicable and noncommunicable diseases, from exposure to health-endangering substances and environments (e.g., cigarette smoke and poor sanitation), and from high-risk behaviors (e.g., substance abuse and unprotected sex). Welfare is promoted through policies aimed at encouraging and facilitating behavior conducive to health (e.g., hand washing, smoking cessation, education about the dangers of drugs, and unprotected sex), and establishing more healthful environments (e.g., smoke-free public spaces, mosquito extermination, and adequate nutrients).",

Publicly funded health services can in principle help address the health needs of those who cannot afford private medical care or insurance. Such measures also may contribute to reducing health inequalities, by bringing the health of vulnerable groups more in line with the general population. Reduction of inequalities can itself be considered an ethical justification, as people with equal status (e.g., citizenship) should not suffer from those types of health inequalities that are due to morally arbitrary reasons (e.g., birth into a poor family and other bad luck).",

            "text": "Poor health has collateral effects. On an individual basis, illness, disability, and their associated expenses can lead to absenteeism and decreased productivity that diminish income, inability to pursue education, reductions in essential consumption such as food and shelter, bankruptcy, and poverty. High infant and child mortality may lead to the compensatory decision to have more children, which decreases resources available for investment in health and education for each child. High adult mortality leaves orphans with bleak prospects. On a societal level, employers and the health system also suffer economic losses from lower worker productivity and greater healthcare burdens. Poor population health can even be economically and politically destabilizing. A particularly grim example is the Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/Acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) crisis in Africa, which lowered life expectancy by decades in some countries, killing adult men and women in their prime productive years. This is economically devastating for individual families and can potentially have larger implications. If deaths cause an overall decrease in economic output, the tax base funding health, education, police, and the military would also shrink, thus diminishing the perceived legitimacy of government. Lower life expectancy discourages long-term investment in education; it also means fewer and less experienced civil servants, reducing government administrative capacity. Low income and low government capacity create incentive for crime, violence, and radicalism, which in turn may trigger more state repression. Foreign investment may be deterred by lack of productive workers and instability. Weak states are also more vulnerable to armed conflicts and terrorism, increasing regional and international security risks. Public health problems can stand as obstacles to economic, political, and human development. What can be achieved with a population debilitated and dying en masse?",

Higher life expectancy provides higher returns to education and human capital investment; lower infant and child mortality helps lower fertility, which results in greater health and educational resources available per child. A healthier, more educated work force is more economically productive, and more capable to generate the tax revenue for crucial infrastructure and services that would further development and attract investments. The connection between public health and development is less pronounced in developed countries that have long attained a high standard of population health; in impoverished countries, however, public health is a key component of the fight against poverty. Generally speaking, the justification for government public health action is ample; it is the justifications for specific public health measures that tend to be more contentious.",

Because individual health -for example, whether one is vaccinated, infected, a smoker -affects the health of others, public health measures regulate individual behavior in order to achieve population health goals. Such policies apply broadly and are not tailored to specific individual circumstances. They typically mandate certain behaviors (e.g., vaccination) and prohibit others (e.g., congregating with others while infected with quarantinable diseases), and sometimes take individual choice largely out of the picture (e.g., water fluoridation).

Ethicists generally agree that the greater the intrusion on individual autonomy and freedom, the greater the public health benefit must be to justify the policy. The public health situation that most starkly pits individual freedom against population health is infectious disease control. The liberty of individuals and their right to associate with others are curbed by protocols to separate infected patients from the population to prevent exposing others (isolation), and to separate or restrict the activities of people who are not diagnosed as infected but who may have been exposed to infection or who may be ill without symptoms (quarantine).",

The conflict is no longer between individual freedom and domestic population health, but between individual freedom and global population health, as demonstrated by the rapid spread of HIV, Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and pandemic flu via air travel. The economic toll of outbreaks is also potentially significant; losses from the 2003 SARS outbreak have been estimated to run in the billions. Domestic efforts are an integral part of global outbreak prevention. Given the high health and economic stakes in disease containment, the isolation of infected individuals to prevent spread of disease is fairly uncontroversial. Quarantine, which applies to those who are not evidently ill, is a more disputed practice, sparking debates on its necessity and effectiveness: Only a small number of quarantined individuals are likely to be actually sick, although rights and freedom are infringed for all individuals placed under quarantine. A 2006 study by Day et al. suggests that quarantine is likely to be more useful and justifiable when isolation is ineffective, or if disease can be transmitted asymptomatically, when the consequences of exposure to others are severe, fatal, and/or irreversible, or if there is an intermediate asymptomatic period that is not too short or too long.",

To the extent feasible, public health measures should secure the voluntary compliance or participation of affected individuals, allowing individuals the autonomy of informed consent. The public health, legal, and ethical reasons for observing isolation or quarantine -and potential consequences for violating it -should be clearly communicated to affected individuals, such that they have the relevant information to assess individual and societal benefits, costs and risks, and to make the decision to comply. Should an individual refuse to comply, authorities should have a system in place to impose isolation or quarantine to protect public health. There may be circumstances in which the urgency and gravity of a public health crisis may make a complete informed consent procedure less practicable. For example, an outbreak in progress of a virulent, highly fatal disease like Ebola may require swifter separation of the infected and the exposed from the general population.",

Smoking is an individual activity that may cause lung cancer, emphysema, and other diseases for the smoker, but there is also substantial evidence for its harm to others through secondhand smoke. Illness from smoking and secondhand smoke can result in losses from lower economic productivity, and greater burdens on the health system. How should public health authorities weigh a smoker's right to smoke versus other people's right to a smoke-free environment? Do smokers really have full autonomous choice over smoking, given that nicotine is an addictive substance? Should smokers be refused tax-funded health services for smoking-related illness? To what degree should smoking be discouraged (e.g., through sin tax) or prohibited to protect especially vulnerable groups like restaurant workers, who are exposed to secondhand smoke, and the poor, among whom smoking is more common and difficult to stop? Different people have different answers for those questions, reflected in the large variation in smoking regulations among the 50 US states and among countries worldwide. Such variation is also seen in laws governing the wearing of seat belts and vehicle helmets, the consequences of which are confined overwhelmingly to the individual making that choice. The fewer the negative public health externalities associated with particular behaviors, the more paternalistic the government regulation of these behaviors. Policies are paternalistic when they seek to protect or benefit individuals against their expressed preferences -for example, by legally requiring people to wear motorcycle helmets when they otherwise would not.",

Hard paternalism interferes with choices of individuals who, according to Childress et al., are 'competent, adequately informed, and free of controlling influences' and is therefore hard to justify. Soft paternalism, however, deals with behaviors of individuals who are considered not competent, not adequately informed, or not free from external control to make that choice. For example, smokers may decide to smoke because they were insufficiently aware of the health consequences, and they may continue to smoke because they have become addicted to nicotine. Obesity may be exacerbated by food marketing and the pricing and availability of healthy versus unhealthy foods, among other factors. Such situations provide more valid grounds for government intervention, which may take the form of education, incentives (e.g., taxes or subsidies to influence price and therefore consumption), marketing restrictions, and even outright bans, if the benefits of strong regulation are deemed to outweigh the infringement of individual freedom. A 'libertarian' version of paternalism has been proposed by Thaler and Sunstein that would structure the choice environment such that people could more easily choose to act in their own best interest (e.g., placing healthy foods at eye level in the store), as a way to preserve greater individual freedom.",

The distribution of benefits and burdens is another ethical consideration in public health policy. Resource allocation and policy application should be fair. Extermination of mosquitoes, for example, should not be implemented in some communities while excluding others; minority groups -such as homosexuals -should not be singled out for disease screening. Targeting programs and interventions could be justified if supported by empirical evidence, but the costs of targeting should be weighed against the benefits. Targeted intervention may be a more efficient way to reach particularly affected groups and may help reduce health inequalities, but it may also come with negative effects. Stigma may become attached to groups singled out for disease programs, and the health of the nontargeted groups and individuals may be compromised if they do not receive the relevant health education and do not receive screening because they are not considered at sufficient risk.

However, cigarette taxes may also disproportionately affect lower income and minority individuals, who are more likely to be smokers (at least in the US), which makes the tax regressive in practice. Just how regressive may depend on how the revenues would be spent (e.g., funding other tobacco control efforts? or folded into general revenues?).

Cost-benefit analysis translates all benefits into monetary units that account for direct (e.g., medical) and indirect (e.g., productivity) effects; cost-effectiveness analysis shows the cost of each unit of gain in health, as indicated by measures such as years of life gained or deaths averted. Cost-utility analysis presents costs associated with a subjective measurement unit that combines preferences for length of life with preferences for quality of life. These kinds of analyses are used in the hopes of maximizing health benefits while minimizing cost.

These methods account only for aggregate welfare, without considering the distribution of benefits and burdens. They tolerate significant health inequalities. Inequalities may even be exacerbated for the disabled, old, and very sick, the health benefits for whom cost-utility analysis assigns less weight due to their reduced capacity to benefit from health resources.

The satisfaction of these conditions would justify the pursuit of a given public health measure over competing ethical values. These five conditions are effectiveness, proportionality, necessity, least infringement, and public justification. The effectiveness condition requires the public health measure to have a good chance of protecting public health; proportionality demands that the probable health benefits exceed adverse effects. The necessity condition directs policymakers to show 'good faith belief' and plausible reasons for using their proposed approach over a less coercive alternative, that is, to show that a given degree of coercion is indeed necessary. Out of all effective, proportional, and necessary options, the option that least infringes other ethical values should be chosen.
