Phylogenetic analysis of the S2 gene nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequence data resulted in groups of strains that were the same as groupings observed when S1 sequence data was used. Thus, it appears that S2 subunits are conserved within a serotype but not between serotypes. Although the sequence differences were small, we found that only a few amino acid differences were responsible for different secondary structure predictions for the S2 subunit. It is likely that these changes create different interactions between the S1 and S2 subunits, which could affect the conformation of the S1 subunit where serotype speci\u00aec epitopes are located. Based on this sequence data, we hypothesize that the S2 subunit can affect speci\u00aec antibody binding to the S1 subunit of the IBV spike glycoprotein.",

One change in the GAV 92 S2 deduced amino acid sequence ( position 50 E?G) led to a 180 \u00afi p in the secondary structure prediction of the S2 subunit. The two nonconservative amino acid changes between the Florida 18288 and Connecticut 46 strains led to radically different secondary structure predictions. It is plausible that these S2 subunit secondary structure changes could affect the tertiary structure of the S2 subunit. Therefore, creating different interactions between the S1 and S2 glycoproteins that could change the quaternary structure of the spike glycoprotein. Such changes would affect antibody binding and therefore account for serologic differences between GAV 92, 3668-4, and Arkansas viruses as well as the serotype differences between the Connecticut and Florida strains.",

Other research on a different Coronavirus, mouse hepatitis virus, by Grosse et al., showed that a single amino acid change in the S2 subunit could create a S1 subunit speci\u00aec monoclonal antibody resistant mutant (11) . This suggests that the interaction between S1 and S2 subunits may determine the shape or availability of S1 subunit speci\u00aec epitopes. Whether the S2 subunit is actually involved in S1 subunit speci\u00aec antibody recognition, sterically hinders antibody from binding to the S1 subunit, or effects the presentation of S1 subunit epitopes is not known.

The entire S2 gene sequence and the deduced amino acid sequence were analyzed by the Clustal method and the pair distances calculated using Lasergene V 3.12 (DNASTAR, Inc., Madison, WI).Sequence data for the S2 genes sequenced in our laboratory and of other IBV strains were also used for phylogenetic analysis by the Higgins-Sharpe(18)unweighted pairgroup method with arithmetic mean algorithm (UPGMA) using MacDNASIS Pro V3.5 (Hitachi Software Engineering Corp., San Bruno, CA). The strain names and GenBank accession numbers are as follows: Arkansas 99, AF094814; Arkansas DPI, AF094815; 3668-4, AF094816; GAV 92, AF094817; Connecticut 46, AF094818; Florida 18288, AF094819; D1466, X58001; D207, X58003; 6/82, X04723; D274, X15832; Beaudette, X02342; Mass 41, M21883; CU-T2, U49858.",
