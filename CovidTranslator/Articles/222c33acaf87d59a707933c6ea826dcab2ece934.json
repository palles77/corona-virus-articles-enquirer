Aim : To determine the influence of SARS on the psychological status, including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, of the staff in the emergency department. Methods: To investigate whether different working conditions in the hospital led to different psychological effects on healthcare workers, the psychological effect on emergency department staff in the high-risk ward was compared with that on psychiatric ward staff in the medium-risk ward. Davidson Trauma Scale-Chinese version (DTS-C) and Chinese Health Questionnaire-12 (CHQ-12) items were designed to check the psychological status of the staff in the month after the end of the SARS outbreak. Results: 86 of 92 (93.5%) medical staff considered the SARS outbreak to be a traumatic experience. The DTS-C scores of staff in the emergency department and in the psychiatric ward were significantly different (p = 0.04). No significant difference in CHQ score was observed between the two groups. Emergency department staff had more severe PTSD symptoms than staff in the psychiatric ward. Conclusion: SARS was a traumatic experience for healthcare providers in Taiwan. Most staff in the emergency department and in the psychiatric ward had PTSD. Emergency department staff had more severe PTSD symptoms than staff in the psychiatric ward.",

The transmission of the SARS corona virus is mainly by respiratory droplets during person-to-person contact. 2 In the healthcare setting, certain treatments and procedures contributed to increased transmission. Healthcare workers are the highest risk group for infection by the SARS virus. Taiwan, one of the most seriously affected countries, had 664 probable SARS cases, which included 105 health workers. 3 The death of 19 infected health workers had a great effect on public health and, as a result, the working conditions in hospitals changed.",

One study that described the immediate psychological and occupational effect of the 2003 SARS outbreak in a teaching hospital in Canada found that medical staff had concerns about their personal safety, about transmitting the disease to family members, stigmatisation and interpersonal isolation. 4 The essential feature of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is the development of characteristic symptoms after exposure to extreme traumatic stress or direct personal experience of an event that involves actual or threatened death or serious injury, or other threat to one's physical integrity; or witnessing an event that involves death, injury, or a threat to the physical integrity of another person; or learning about unexpected or violent death, serious harm or threat of death or injury experienced by a family member or other close associate. The person's response to the event must involve intense fear, helplessness or horror. 5 The outbreak of SARS, a life-threatening and life-altering event, was considered traumatic enough to elicit PTSD.",

This hospital is a tertiary referal medical centre in middle Taiwan and is equipped with 1512 beds. The emergency department is responsible for coordinating emergency medical services in the Taichung area, and has approximately 4500 patient visits on average per month. During the the SARS outbreak, emergency departments became the first line of defence against SARS for hospitals in Taiwan. The healthcare workers in the emergency department had to screen patients who had symptoms of SARS such as fever, fatigue and dry cough. As first-line members of a team, emergency department staff and infection specialists worked in an isolated building outside the hospital and wore protective suits. Emergency department healthcare workers faced physical and psychological stress, which they had never experienced in the past. To find out whether different working conditions in the hospital led to different psychological effects on healthcare workers, we investigated the psychological effect of SARS on emergency department staff in the high-risk ward and on staff in the medium-risk ward.",

The percentages of staff with CHQ-12 scores .3 in the emergency department and in the general ward were 51.6% and 38.5%, respectively (p = 0.371). Table 6 lists the differences in presentation of PTSD symptoms between emergency department staff and psychiatry staff. Staff in the emergency department experienced the PTSD symptoms ''acting and feeling as if the trauma were recurring'' and ''irritability'' more severely and more often than staff in the psychiatric ward. Staff in the emergency department experienced more difficulty in ''getting along with the family or friends'' than did staff in the psychiatric ward.",

Most healthcare workers faced a condition that they had never experienced before. The SARS outbreak was unique in its rapid transmission. It brought heavy stress to first-line healthcare workers, particularly those in the emergency department. In Taiwan, during the SARS outbreak, especially in the initial stage, the increasing number of deaths and changing infection control procedures upset the whole society. SARS brought stress to the public as well as to healthcare workers. The effect of stress on the healthcare system must be investigated and emphasised. 11 There have been some reports of the psychological effect of SARS on patients and healthcare providers. [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] However, the impact on emergency department staff has not been fully evaluated. In communications with staff, we noted that most of them felt stressful about SARS. Healthcare workers were concerned about insufficient medical supplies, the anticipated overtime hours if other staff were quarantined, the stigma of the illness, and the health of their family and themselves.",

            "text": "PTSD is a psychiatric disorder that can occur after the experience or witnessing of life-threatening events such as military combat, natural disasters, terrorist incidents, serious accidents or violent personal assaults like rape. PTSD occurs in men and women, adults and children, western and nonwestern cultural groups, and in all socioeconomic strata. 19 The proximity and intensity of the trauma influence the probability of developing influence PTSD. In many SARS-affected areas, PTSD-related symptoms are found in the population. In Hong Kong, survivors of SARS reported symptoms related to posttraumatic stress disorder, anxiety and depression. Symptom severity was associated with high perceived life threat and low emotional support. Women and participants who had a low educational level were more likely to have symptoms of avoidance. Participants who personally knew someone who had SARS were more likely to be affected by depressive symptoms. 12 20 Among healthcare workers in Hong Kong, 78% reported a high level of stress and, about 57% were found to have experienced psychological distress. The healthcare workers' psychological morbidity was best explained by perceptions of personal vulnerability, stress and support in the workplace. 14 In Canada, it is estimated that a high degree of distress was experienced by 29-35% of hospital workers. 18 21 Among healthcare workers in Taiwan, 68% reported a high level of stress and 57% were found to have experienced psychological distress. 15 Another study in Taiwan found that 338 staff members with stress reactions in a hospital, 5% had an acute stress disorder, 20% felt stigmatised and rejected in their neighbourhood because of their hospital work, and 9% reported reluctance to work or had considered resignation. 22 In this study, 93% of medical staff considered the SARS outbreak as a traumatic experience. Their self-observation about the severity of the stress caused by SARS was the most significant factor staffing medical staff with severe PSTD-that is, staff's awareness of mental stress was in accordance with their PSTD symptomatology. Staff can benefit from resources and emotional support when they face stress.",

            "text": "The known risk factors for PTSD are female sex, lower educational level, younger age with lower income, perceived threat to life and family history of mood disorder. 5 In this study, 16 (19.30%) staff members had DTS-C scores .40. This rate of PTSD is much higher than the lifetime prevalence of around 7.8% in the community. 5 Being a healthcare worker may be a risk factor for PTSD if the trauma is an outbreak severely threating public health. In our study, re-experience was the most acute symptom of PTSD. Many staff members had symptoms such as intensive intrusive imagery, distressing recollections or dreams, and psychological stress reactions on exposure to stimuli linked to the trauma, feelings of detachment or derealisation, and acting and feeling as though the trauma were recurring. That was probably because after the end of the SARS outbreak, the staff, unlike other victims of PTSD after traffic accidents were seldom exposed to similar circumstances, continued to work as healthcare givers in the hospital and exposed to risky conditions. The background of the staff with scores above the threshold CHQ-12 was not significantly different from that of those with scores below the threshold. There were 43 staff members with CHQ-12 scores .3; hence, the rate of staff 47.78% of staff members with possible minor psychiatric morbidity was higher than that in the general community in Taiwan. 23 The staff enrolled in the study had no history of mental disorder before SARS. A high rate of psychiatric morbidity was found to occur after the SARS outbreak. As healthcare providers, they had the feeling of being infected by SARS, which they had never experienced before. Good psychological adaptation was reported by nurses who worked in a SARS ward with a wellequipped and structured environment. 13 An investigation showed that nurses' level of agreement with general SARS infection control measures, their physical status and educational level predicted their willingness to care for patients with SARS. 15 Medical staff would be free from psychological distress once the protecting system is well set up. As the first line of hospital defence during the SARS period, emergency department staff faced more demanding working conditions than staff in other units. Although the average working hours of emergency department staff were less than those of staff in the psychiatric ward, their physical and psychological stress was obvious. The average DTS-C score of emergency department staff was significantly higher than that of psychiatric ward staff. They experienced more severe and frequent forms of ''irritability'' and ''acting and feeling as though the trauma were recurring''. The average CHQ-12 score of emergency department staff was also higher. Emergency department staff expressed more difficulty in getting along with family or friends because they were afraid of transmitting SARS. Heavy protective suits and N95 masks made communication more difficult. The feeling of interpersonal isolation and the arduous working conditions accounted for the more severe psychological effect on emergency department staff. In this study, it was quite obvious that emergency department staff experienced more severe psychological effect because of SARS due to demanding working condition. Emergency department staff may be unable to concentrate on work and may became anxious under stress. Flexible and non-intrusive psychiatric intervention and a comfortable environment in which to share their reactions to tremendous stress are Pearson x 2 test. 10, 1, 2, 3, and 4 indicate ''not stressed'', ''mildly stressed'', ''moderately stressed'', ''obviously stressed'', and ''extremely stressed''. \u00f40, 1, 2, 3, and 4 indicate ''never'', ''once'', ''twice to three times'', ''four to six times'', and ''every day.'' stressed \u00c0\u00c00 indicates ''not stresssed'' or ''the same as usual'', and 1 indicates ''badly'' or ''worse than ever''.",
