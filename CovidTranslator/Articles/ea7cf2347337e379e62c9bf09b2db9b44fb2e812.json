            "text": "Bluetongue virus (BTV) is an arbovirus transmitted by blood-feeding midges to a wide 27 range of wild and domestic ruminants. In this report, we showed that BTV, through its virulence 28 non-structural protein NS3 (BTV-NS3), is able to activate the MAPK/ERK pathway. In 29 response to growth factors, the MAPK/ERK pathway activates cell survival, differentiation, 30 proliferation and protein translation but can also lead to the production of several inflammatory 31 cytokines. By combining immunoprecipitation of BTV-NS3 and mass spectrometry analysis 32 from both BTV-infected and NS3-transfected cells, we identified the serine/threonine-protein 33 kinase B-Raf (BRAF), a crucial player of the MAPK/ERK pathway, as a new cellular interactor 34 of BTV-NS3. BRAF silencing led to a significant decrease of the MAPK/ERK activation by 35 BTV supporting a model where BTV-NS3 interacts with BRAF to activate this signaling 36 cascade. Furthermore, the intrinsic ability of BTV-NS3 to bind BRAF and activate the 37 MAPK/ERK pathway is conserved throughout multiple serotypes/strains but appears to be 38 specific to BTV compared to other members of Orbivirus genus. Inhibition of MAPK/ERK 39 pathway with U0126 reduced viral titers, suggesting that BTV manipulates this pathway for its 40 own replication. Therefore, the activation of the MAPK/ERK pathway by BTV-NS3 could 41 benefit to BTV replication by promoting its own viral protein synthesis but could also explain 42 the deleterious inflammation associated with tissue damages as already observed in severe cases 43 of BT disease. Altogether, our data provide molecular mechanisms to explain the role of BTV-44 NS3 as a virulence factor and determinant of pathogenesis. 45 author/funder. All rights reserved.

To address the question of BTV modulation with the MAPK/ERK pathway, we used a 118 trans-reporter gene assay that measures Elk1 activation by ERK1/2. In this system, Elk1 119 transcription factor is fused to the DNA binding domain of Gal4 (Gal4-DB) and leads to the 120 expression of the firefly luciferase reporter gene downstream of a promoter sequence containing 121 a Gal4 binding site. Upon stimulation with a growth factor like EGF, Elk1 was activated as 122 assessed by a 5-fold increase of luciferase activity compared to unstimulated HEK-293T cells 123 ( Figure 1A ; mock control). Cells infected with BTV at different MOIs showed a very strong 124 enhancement in this cellular pathway, even in absence of EGF stimulation ( Figure 1A) , and in 125 a MOI-dependent manner. Moreover, the inability of a UV-inactivated BTV to activate the 126 luciferase reporter gene indicated that the induction of MAPK/ERK was dependent on viral 127 replication or de novo viral protein expression. To determine whether viral protein(s) could be 128 involved in the MAPK/ERK activation, we tested separately all the BTV proteins in our reporter 129 assay. As shown in Figure 1B , only BTV-NS3 is able to strongly activate the MAPK/ERK 130 pathway both in presence or absence of EGF stimulation. Thus, the activation of the 131 (with Mascot scores of 64 and 104, respectively) whereas BRAF was not detected in the control 140 conditions (mock infected-or empty pCI-neo-3xFLAG transfected-cells). The identified 141 peptides corresponding to BRAF are listed in Table 1 . 142 BRAF, together with ARAF and CRAF, are members of the RAF kinase family that 143 play a central role in regulating the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway. Therefore, binding to 144 BRAF represents a potential molecular mechanism underlying this manipulation that we 145 decided to investigate. To validate this interaction, full-length BTV-NS3 (NS3FL) and different 146 fragments of NS3 ( Figure 2A ) were tested for their ability to interact with endogenous BRAF. 147",

As a complementary approach, we used the MEK1/2 inhibitor 256 U1026 and measure its impact on the capacity of BTV-NS3 to inhibit the IFN-\u03b2 promoter 257 activity. As shown in Figure 8B , the U0126 molecule was unable to prevent the antagonist 258 function of BTV-NS3 on the induction of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 and thus to rescue a significant activation of 259 the IFN-\u03b2 promoter. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that the activation of MAPK/ERK by 260 BTV-NS3 does not contribute its antagonist activity on the IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 synthesis. 261 262 author/funder.

NS3 proteins are glycoproteins that promote viral release 92 either through its viroporin activity (20) or by budding. This latter implies interactions between 93 NS3 and outer capsid VP2/VP5 proteins (27), and cellular proteins involved in the pathway of 94 endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT) (TSG101 and NEDD4-like 95 ubiquitin ligase) and the calpactin light chain p11 (23, 28, 29). Altogether, these reports provide 96 molecular basis of the multifunctional role of BTV-NS3 as a virulence factor and determinant 97 of pathogenesis as also illustrated by other in vivo studies using BTV monoreassortants and 98 NS3/NS3A knockout mutants (30-32). 99 Many viruses can modulate and hijack signaling pathways related to the mitogen-100 activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MAPK/ERK) pathway for more 101 efficient replication (33). In response to extracellular stimuli such as growth factors, several 102 downstream components of the MAPK/ERK pathway including RAS, RAF, MEK1/2 and 103 ERK1/2 are successively activated. Then, ERK1/2 directly or indirectly regulates transcription 104 factors (e.g. Elk1) involved in cell proliferation, differentiation and survival (34, 35) but also 105 cellular factors that control mRNA translation like eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) (36). 106 Results 115 116 BTV-NS3 activates the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway 117",

In both cases, the 221 reduction of BRAF expression led to a significant decrease of the MAPK/ERK activation as 222 assessed by the luciferase reporter gene assays and anti-pERK/1/2 immunoblotting. These 223 results support a model where BTV-NS3 interaction with BRAF enhances MAPK/ERK 224 pathway activation. 225 226 NS3 interaction with BRAF and activation of the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway 227 are characteristic of BTV 228 To address the question of the specificity of the BRAF interaction, we first compared 229 NS3 proteins from three serotypes (BTV 1, 8 and 27) in their ability to interact with endogenous 230 BRAF. GST-tagged NS3 from BTV1, 8 and 27 were expressed in HEK-293T cells and purified 231 48 h later with glutathione-sepharose beads. As shown in Figure 7A, NS3 proteins from BTV1, 232 8 and 27 have similar binding capacities for BRAF. As a consequence, BTV1-NS3 and BTV27-233 NS3 were also able to enhance the MAPK/ERK pathway, although the activation by BTV8-234 demonstrating the specificity of this interaction (Figure 7C). Moreover, only BTV-NS3 highly 239 activates MAPK/ERK pathway, in contrast to EHDV-NS3, AHSV-NS3 and EEV-NS3 (Figure 240 7D). Thus, the interaction with BRAF and activation of the MAPK/ERK pathway are unique 241 to BTV-NS3. 242 243 BTV-NS3 inhibits the induction of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 independently of MAPK/ERK 244 signaling 245",

These differences could 330 be due to the fact that BRAF expression was not fully blocked following gene silencing (Figures 331 6C and 6D) and this would explain why NS3 expression, as well as viral titers (data not shown), 332 are not affected in cells transfected with the BRAF siRNA. Our findings also correlate with 333 data obtained with other members of Reoviridae family.

A possible link between MAPK/ERK pathway and 339 BTV protein expression could be related to the downstream targets of this pathway which are 340 essential factors of the cellular translational machinery, like eIF4E. 341 eIF4E is believed to be the least abundant of all initiation factors. Therefore, it can be 342 considered as an excellent target to regulate protein synthesis. Phosphorylation of eIF4E is 343 mediated by MAPK interacting kinase 1 (MNK1), itself mainly activated by ERK1/2 (36). 344 However, MNK1 has also other downstream targets including eukaryotic initiation factor 4G 345 (eIF4G). Once activated, eIF4E interacts with the cap structure and brings translation initiation 346 factors together with the small ribosomal subunit via the scaffold protein eIF4G to initiate cap-347 dependent mRNA translation (68). Since BTV mRNA are capped like their host counterparts 348 (69, 70), it may be assumed that BTV increases phosphorylation level of eIF4E, thereby 349 stimulating cap-dependent translation, to promote its own viral protein synthesis within infected 350 cells. 351",
