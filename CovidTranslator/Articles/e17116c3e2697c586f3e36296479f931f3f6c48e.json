Editing occurred within a purine-rich sequence (AAUUAAAAA-AGGGGG) found at the mRNA nucleotides 791-805. This sequence resembles an HPIVB consensus transcription termination sequence and is located at the 5'-end of the putative D protein coding sequences. Editing at an alternate site (AAUUGGAAAGGAAAGG), mRNA nucleotides 1121-l 136, for accession of a conserved V cistron, which is present in a number of paramyxovirus P genes, was not found to occur in HPIV3. In contrast with many other paramyxoviruses, editing was indiscriminate with the insertion of l-l 2 additional G residues not present in the gene template. RNA editing was found to occur in both in vivo (HPIV3 infected cells) and in vitro (purified nucleocapsid complexes) synthesized mRNAs. Further, the in vitro prepared mRNA was edited regardless of whether the nucleocapsid complexes were transcribed in the presence or absence of uninfected human lung carcinoma (HLC) cell lysates. These results support the notion that RNA editing appears to be exclusively a function of viral proteins. Q 1992 Academic PWSS, 543",

While SV5, HPIV2, HPIV4A, HPIV4B, and mumps viruses require the insertion of nontemplated nucleotides into their respective P mRNAs for the synthesis of complete P proteins, measles virus (Bellini et al., 1985) HPIVl (Matsuoka et al., 1991) , HPIV3 (Galinski et a/., 1986b; Luk et a/., 1986; Spriggs and Collins, 1986b) , BPIV3 (Sakai et al., 1987; Pelet et al., 1991) and Sendai virus (Giorgi eta/., 1983) do not. This latter group of viruses encode their P proteins in single continuous cistrons; however, in addition to the continuous P cistrons, these genes contain overlapping (continuous) C protein cistrons which are accessed via independent translation initiation, Molecular cloning and sequence analysis of the sim-A notable feature of the 5'-proximal (mRNA) cistron in ian virus type 5 (SV5) phosphoprotein (P) gene/mRNA SV5 (designated as protein V in SV5), mumps, HPIV4A, revealed that insertion of nontemplated nucleotides and HPIV4B is the presence of a conserved amino acid during transcription of the P mRNA was necessary for sequence (approximately 55 amino acids) at the C-terthe fusion of two discontinuous (and overlapping) cismini of the encoded proteins. A prominent feature trons in order to produce a template capable of encodamong the residues in this domain is the presence of ing a complete P protein (Thomas et al., 1988) . The six highly conserved cysteine residues. The similarity addition of nontemplated nucleotides in the P mRNA of these sequences to motifs found in nonrepetitive occurred within a guanosine track just downstream zinc fingers has been noted (Thomas et a/., 1988) . The from a purine-rich sequence which closely resembles existence of similar amino acid sequences in \"cryptic\" an SV5 transcription terminator. Subsequently, similar cistrons, present in the P genes of other paramyxoviobservations for RNA editing were made for measles ruses, suggests some functional or biological signifivirus (Cattaneo et al., 1989) ; mumps virus (Elliott et al., cance for the maintenance of these sequences within 1990; Paterson and Lamb, 1990) ; human parain-this group of viruses. These observations, together fluenza viruses types 2 (Ohgimoto et al., 1990; South- with the known association of the P protein with the ern er a/., 1990) 4A, and 4B (HPIV4A and HPIV4B; nucleocapsid complex (Chinchar and Portner, 1981; Kondo et al., 1990) ; bovine parainfluenza virus type 3 Deshpande and Por-tner, 1985; Hamaguchi et al., 1983; Ryan and Kingsbury, 1988; Ryan et al., 1990; Ryan and Portner, 1990) would suggest a transcriptional regulatory function for this domain. The HPIV3 P gene/mRNA nucleotide sequence has been detailed in a number of independent reports (Galinski et al., 198613; Luk et al., 1986; Spriggs and Collins, 198613) . The molecular organization of the P gene allows for the encoding of continuous cistrons for the P, C, and putative D proteins. And, as described above, a cryptic V cistron, which shares 33% amino acid identity with the C-terminus of the SV5 V protein, is also present. A sequence, similar to the SV5 RNAediting site, is adjacent to the cryptic V cistron and an additional sequence, similar to an HPIV3 transcription terminator, is present upstream of the D cistron. In both instances, purine-rich tracts are followed by a string of guanosine residues. Interestingly, the number of G nucleotides reported from the various laboratories in the mRNA sequences proximal to the D cistron differ, with 5, 8, or 11 Gs being reported.",

HPIV3 follows the more general pattern of a single continuous P cistron with an alternate overlapping C cistron similar to that first described for Sendai virus (Giorgi era/., 1983; Shioda et al., 1983) . Cloning and sequence analysis of the HPIV3 mRNA/genes by a number of labs (Galinski et a/., 1986b; Luk et a/., 1986; Spriggs and Collins, 1986b; Galinski, unpublished observations) revealed a heterogeneity in the number of G nucleotides between position 801 and 805, which is proximal to the 5'-end of the D cistron ( Fig. 1, labeled D) . Interestingly, the sequence just upstream of this G tract, AATTAAAAAA, resembles the consensus transcription termination sequence, AA-TAACWAAA, found in the gene-end boundaries of HPIVS (Spriggs and Collins, 1986a) . Together with the observation that transcriptional editing occurs in a number of paramyxoviruses at similar sequences suggests that editing is occurring at this site for accession of the D cistron. Since the cryptic V cistron is also present in the HPIV3 P gene, the question of whether transcriptional chattering occurs in the accession of the D and/or V cistrons needed to be resolved.",

Thus, the insertion of G residues can be viewed as the accession or fusion of three cistrons, the intact P proteins, truncated P (P,) proteins, and a fused P/D protein. Fig. 3B summarizes these details by charting the percentage of recombinant clones encoding P, P,, and P/D. In order to investigate the expression of the various cistrons, P, C, P,, and P/D, we reassembled recombinant genes containing a fixed number of Gs at the D editing site to duplicate the various mRNA species illustrated in Fig. 4A . Three clones, containing either six, seven, or eight G residues in the editing site, were individually transcribed with SP6 RNA polymerase following restriction endonuclease digestion with Pvull at a site downstream of the P genes. The RNAs were then recovered and used to charge a rabbit reticulocyte lysate system for the production of various proteins. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE using 10% polyacrylamide resolving gels. The results of this analysis are shown in Fig. 4B , which compares the proteins produced by each of the fixed mRNA sequences (Lanes 5, 6, and 7) to the proteins synthesized from HPIV3-infected and uninfected CV-1 cell mRNA (lanes 3 and 4, respectively). In addition to the in vitro synthesized proteins, in viva synthesized proteins from HPIV3-infected and uninfected cells are shown (lanes 1 and 2, respectively).
