The disease, which can be diagnosed through the use of a nasopharyngeal swab, under the most severe forms can lead to bilateral pneumonia [3] which can be lethal especially in elderly patients with comorbidities [4] . The first outbreaks of COVID-19 in Italy occurred during the second half of February 2020 in some areas in the North of the country. Despite the drastic restrictions imposed by the Italian Government in those areas (DL n. 6, 23 February 2020) [5] , several other outbreaks began in other areas of northern Italy, forcing the Authorities to extend the previously adopted restrictions to the entire national territory (DPCM of 3 March 2020 et seq.) [5] . Due to the high contagiousness of the infection, further spread by asymptomatic people [4] , in a few weeks Italy has become the country with the greatest number of infected people after China [6] . The large number of severe cases among infected people in Italy led to the hospitalization of thousands of patients [7, 8] , with a heavy burden on the National Health Service. In particular, the most affected Regions are Lombardy and Emilia Romagna, with more than half of the total cases. One month after the beginning of the epidemic in Italy we report the situation and propose a forecast model in real-time to estimate its evolution.",

Despite the high number of performed swabs as compared to the confirmed cases, the epidemic has been growing with a very high rate.

In particular, the disease is showing to be lethal for the elderly (96% in patients aged \u2265 60) and men (71%) [10]. On the date we finalized this article (26 March 2020), the trend of daily distribution of confirmed cases seems to show an initial decline of the growth of the epidemic. The total number of confirmed cases will eventually exceed those that occurred in China.

Since the theoretical cumulative curve has an asymptotic pattern (i.e. the maximum value is achieved for the t time towards infinite), considering 99% of the time from the beginning of the outbreak is a convention. Therefore, if instead of 99% of time we considered 99,9%, the overall number of days estimated for the epidemic to come to an end increases by 20% (i.e. ten more days need to be added to the calculation of time). Moreover, several factors could affect the total number of cases and the duration of the epidemic. For example, a contribution to the spread of outbreaks in southern Italy was caused by the movement of students and workers from Northern to Southern Italy following the first governmental restrictions. On the other hand, more stringent restrictions imposed later on by the Government could lower the expected number of total cases and reduce the number of days towards the end of the epidemic.",

First of all, data was not always updated on a daily basis by each Regional Authority. Moreover, we have to consider that the number of infected people is underestimated, since there are many undetected asymptomatic individuals.
