Infection with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was suspected on March 21 and confirmed on March 23; the patient, who had contact with an ill camel shortly before symptom onset, died on March 26. A contact investigation was initiated to identify possible person-to-person transmission and assess infection control measures. Of 83 identified contacts, 81 were available for follow-up. Ten contacts experienced mild symptoms, but test results for respiratory and serum samples were negative for MERS-CoV. Serologic testing was done for 53 (75%) of 71 nonsymptomatic contacts; all results were negative. Among contacts, the use of FFP2/FFP3 face masks during aerosol exposure was more frequent after MERS-CoV infection was suspected than before. Infection control measures may have prevented nosocomial transmission of the virus.",

Person-to-person transmission has been reported in the work environment, among family contacts, or to health care workers (HCWs) (11) (12) (13) . Although situations involving consecutive human transmission events have been documented (13) , none of the known clusters have led to sustained person-to-person transmission in the general population. In Europe, single imported infections have been reported in the United Kingdom, Germany, France, and Italy, and secondary cases have been reported in the United Kingdom, France, and Italy (12, 14, 15) . Because a large proportion of cases are fatal and the virus could acquire the ability to spread more efficiently (as was the case with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus), WHO has recommended thorough contact investigations for confirmed human cases to identify, quantify, and prevent person-to-person transmission (16) .",

His profession was camel breeding; in the 2 weeks before his onset of illness, 1 of his camels was reported to have had a respiratory illness. In the questionnaire, we did not differentiate between dromedary (Camelus dromedaries) and Bactrian (C. bactrianus) camels. His neighborhood had palm trees, and bats were known to dwell in the area. The patient had no known contact with other MERS-CoV patients, had no personal contacts in Qatar or Jordan, and had no travel history in the 10 days before illness onset. He consumed different types of fruit juices and cooked goat meat, beef, and sheep meat, but no raw meat. He ate dates from his region, but he reportedly did not consume date or palm syrup. Other than the camels on his farm, he had no contact with animals; he did not practice falconry and did not visit camel racetracks or animal markets.",

However, whereas the previous case was in the late third week of illness, this patient was in the second week of illness. Sample from this patient taken from different body locations and at different times were positive for MERS-CoV by PCR, and the viral load detected was several logs higher than in samples from the patient with the previous imported case (18, 20) . These results indicate that this patient may have been more infectious than the previous patient.",

In our study, the patient was isolated during the first 2 days of his hospital stay (before MERS was suspected), although the reason for this intervention was the hospital's policy to isolate every patient from the Middle East, irrespective of the assumed diagnosis, because of perceived increased risk of carrying drug-resistant pathogens, rather than any special measures taken because of the patient's respiratory illness. After MERS was suspected, HCWs used FFP2 masks significantly more frequently than they had before, and fewer HCWs had daily contact with the patient. Our result suggest that, in the later stages of this disease, the combination of standard protection measures (use of surgical masks for potentially aerosol-generating procedures), cautious handling of the patient (because of his potential to harbor drugresistant bacteria), and possible decreased infectiousness compared with the first week of illness may have prevented transmission to HCWs. These findings also underline the importance of following WHO recommendations on infection prevention and control when managing a patient who may be infected with a pathogen that could lead to nosocomial transmission (23) .",

Of note were the presence of bats in the neighborhood of his residence, the patient's profession as camel breeder, and his contact with a camel that was reported to have had a respiratory illness before his own illness onset. Bats are a likely reservoir for MERS-related CoV (5, 8) , and serum samples from Omani racing camels have shown to have neutralizing antibodies against MERS-CoV (24).

Both methods have merits, and a combination of both is likely to ensure the most thorough contact follow-up. Advantages of personal interviews on the telephone are immediacy and the possibility for the interviewer to receive intangible information, such as the self-assessment of symptoms, as well as the opportunity to answer questions from the contacts. This process enables a more specific way to judge a person's health status. On the other hand, a daily monitoring questionnaire provides detail in clinical information, exposure, and protection measures that might be used for more in-depth analyses (e.g., when a few contacts have become infected). Such a questionnaire could be expanded to include a section for contact persons to fill in the names of persons with whom they had face-to-face contact during each day. This information might become crucial for second-generation contact tracing when contacts under observation become infected. Rapid availability of this type of information is essential for efficient investigation of clusters or outbreaks similar to those that have been reported already (13) .",
