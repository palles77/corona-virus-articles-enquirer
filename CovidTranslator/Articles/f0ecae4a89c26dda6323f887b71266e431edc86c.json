            "text": "Background: SARS was an unprecedented outbreak which brought about 1,755 infections and 302 deaths in Hong Kong. The similarity of SARS and avian influenza prompted us to examine the relationship between SARS experience and preparedness on a potential avian influenza outbreak. Methods: A self-administered questionnaire was delivered to nurses in Hong Kong to assess their attitude towards avian influenza; risk perception, and their relationships with previous level of exposure to SARS patients. Results: Nine hundred and ninety-nine respondents were included in data analysis. About half of them perceived there would be an avian influenza outbreak in Hong Kong. The majority accepted a personal risk of infection in the course of their work (72.7%), and prepared to take care of patients infected with avian influenza (84.0%). Respondents were classified into two groups: high exposure (44.1%) and low exposure (55.9%) as defined by having worked in SARS ward or hospitals. High exposure nurses were less likely to avoid patients, less inclined to change their job if they were required to take care of infected patients, and had therefore a more positive attitude towards an impending avian influenza epidemic. About half of the nurses had frequent involuntary recalls of incidents relating to SARS, the frequency of which was positively correlated with knowing a person suffering from long-term complications of SARS. Conclusion: Healthcare workers who had been actively involved in SARS work were more ''positive'' in responding to the impending avian influenza epidemic. Whether the level of preparedness can be sustained would need to be further explored.",

In particular, frontline HCWs are believed to have been severely impacted [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . They faced not only the increased physical and psychological stress from attending to SARS patients, but also their own risk of infection due to their close contacts with those infected. Acknowledging colleagues' infections and deaths caused tremendous emotional upsets. With the uncertainties about the illness and the course of the epidemic, some chose to be self-quarantined to ease their worries of spreading the virus to family members [4, 9] . While SARS has not returned after the last cases were reported in the same year, the threat of avian influenza was just beginning to be felt. It's of note that both SARS and avian influenza are respiratory tract infections with high mortality. As of February 2006, 34 avian influenza outbreaks have been detected in 14 provinces or regions in China [10] . The concern about human-to-human infection has again imposed threats to the society and the health care system.",

It would therefore be important to determine if the SARS experiences could affect preparedness of the society against an impending avian influenza epidemic. As one of the hardest hit cities during the SARS outbreaks, Hong Kong is uniquely positioned to explore such relationship, especially as regards the perception and attitudes of frontline HCW. We hypothesize that the experiences from SARS would affect HCW's attitude and preparedness towards the impending epidemic. We focused our attention on nurses as the prototype frontline HCW who would be charged with responding to the outbreaks and be dealing with the public, the medical professionals, embassies, overseas citizens and health authorities, not unlike what happened during the SARS outbreak [12] .",

The questionnaire was in Chinese language as almost all frontline nurses in Hong Kong were local Chinese. It was developed after interviewing stakeholders and healthcare workers to determine the themes and range of possible responses for assessing SARS experiences. The questionnaire was field tested and then sent to the nurses via their postal addresses, through three nursing associations -the Hong Kong Nurses General Union; the Nurses Branch, and the Enrolled Nurses Branch, Hong Kong Chinese Civil Servants' Association. These associations serve as a forum for social gathering and networking. All nurses practicing in Hong Kong are eligible to apply for membership. Applications to the three associations are not mutually exclusive. Mailing was made just before the influenza seasons of 2006. The posted questionnaire was accompanied by an introductory letter to explain about study objectives and protection of anonymity, a self-addressed stamped envelop, and a small souvenir. Subjects who were not practicing as a nurse in 2003 were excluded. Ethical approval was obtained from ethics committee of The Chinese University of Hong Kong.",

They acquired knowledge on how to prepare for a new crisis in the future, and fostered constructive attitudes on providing the best care for patients [5, 9, 14] . Witnessing deaths and serious infections were sufficiently stressful. SARS was such an important life event for our nurses, and the unique yet painful experience had built up strengths and identity. As noted by Frinke [15] , nurses developed posttraumatic stress disorder after serving in the Vietnam War during which they witnessed quite a number of deaths and injuries. The pain however did not stop them from taking care of their patients. They reframed the situation from a positive angle and were able to cope with new stress when the environment became disruptive. Similarly, nurses in our study reframed their SARS exposure as a unique experience, which has enabled them to get better prepared for an impending outbreak of avian influenza.",

Over 90% of our nurses washed their hands every time before getting off duties. Such practice was more likely to happen among nurses who had higher SARS exposure. Knowingly, handwashing plays an important role in maintaining good community hygiene. Nurses have frequent contacts with patients, and their hands are easily contaminated by transient bacteria [16] . Washing hands after work decreases the chance of bringing infectious agents to the public, which is beneficial to the community. This is, however, just one of the many practices in maintaining good community hygiene. The contribution of other practices in environmental hygiene would need to be explored before a conclusion can be arrived.",

Having known a person suffering from long-term SARS complications was a predictor of such recall. It appears that nurses with frequent SARS recall were less prepared for the impending avian influenza outbreak. Nevertheless they perceived a higher chance of an avian influenza outbreak, were more afraid of the infection, and were more likely to change job due to the risk of infection. A higher proportion stocked Tamiflu at home as a preparatory measures compared to other respondents. Getting acquainted with a person suffering from long-term complications from SARS could have triggered one's memory of the incident. However, we were unable to identify any significant relationship between SARS recall and SARS exposure. It's possible that SARS recall was one negative consequence of SARS exposure rather than an objective index of having worked closely with SARS patients in wards or hospitals. Further study is in progress to identify the content of the recall, and assess the impacts of SARS exposure.",

On the other hand, we lack a standardized instrument for measuring attitudes and risk perception of health care workers towards an impending avian influenza outbreak. The subject was to a large extent too hypothetical, and could never be validated unless an outbreak did eventually take place. We have adopted the statements used in Imai et al.
