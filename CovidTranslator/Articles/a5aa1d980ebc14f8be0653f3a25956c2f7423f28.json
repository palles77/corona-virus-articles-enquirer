In healthy rabbits, the nostrils are constantly twitching at a rate of 2-120 times per minute, unless the rabbit is at rest (Brewer and Cruise, 1994) or is unwell. The nasal cavity is lined with a protective layer of mucus that entraps foreign particles and bacteria. The mucus also prevents water loss and enhances the sense of smell. The nasal glands secrete serous fluid into the nasal cavity. In the rabbit, there is glandular tissue along the nasal septum and a cluster of glands, collectively known as the lateral nasal gland, occupy the entire wall between the nasal cavity and maxillary sinus (Bojsen-Moller, 1964) . The function of these nasal glands is to moisten inspired air, which has a role in thermoregulation. The position of the conchal and maxillary sinuses and the structures of the nasal cavity are illustrated in Figures 3.9 and 7.1. There is no frontal sinus.",

Pasteurellosis is not a recognized problem in wild rabbits but is a serious disease in colonies of commercial or laboratory rabbits. In pet rabbits, although P. multocida is found as an opportunist pathogen in many secondary infections, primary pasteurellosis is uncommon. It is usually encountered in the newly acquired rabbit that has recently been bought from a breeder or pet shop. Respiratory disease is the most common manifestation. Acute infections and septicaemia occur, especially in young animals, but chronic, insidious recurrent infections are more common in the adult pet rabbit. Rhinitis, conjunctivitis, nasolacrimal duct infections, otitis media, tracheitis and bronchopneumonia can all be caused by Pasteurella multocida. The organism can spread to other sites from the nasal cavity where it can reside as a commensal organism. Infection often persists despite mucosal and humoral antibody responses in addition to effusive neutrophilic exudation. The deleterious effect of pasteurellosis on laboratory colonies of rabbits and interference with experimental procedures has resulted in the evolution of expensive 'pasteurella-free' rabbits for use in research. The epidemiology of pasteurellosis is discussed in Section 16.5.1. Many predisposing factors trigger disease.",

The development of rhinitis and other respiratory tract problems in the newly acquired young rabbit is likely to be due to pasteurellosis. In the older animal, stress or poor husbandry can result in a flare up of a latent infection. Poor air quality, caused by high ammonia levels, or dusty hay irritate the respiratory tract and predisposes secondary infection. Many owners like to protect their rabbits from inclement weather by covering the hutch or placing them in a poorly ventilated damp shed during the winter months. Ventilation and good air quality is important in disease prevention. Pasteurellosis can be spread between animals and the disease is endemic in most breeding establishments. It often causes problems in premises, such as sanctuaries, where several animals are housed in close proximity. A distance of greater than 1.8 m (6 feet) or 'sneezing distance' is needed to control the spread of infection between individuals (Whittaker, 1989) .",

Grooming difficulties occur because the rabbit finds it difficult to breathe and groom simultaneously. Response to antibiotic therapy is poor in advanced cases and relapse is common. Post-mortem examination of the sinuses and nasal passages of rabbits with chronic rhinitis shows why these cases are so difficult to treat. The nasal cavity is filled with pus, which can spread into the paranasal sinuses (see Figure 7 .1 and Figure 13 .1). The pus becomes thick and inspissated.

Infection can spread further to affect the inner ear and vestibular apparatus or track through the acoustic meatus and along the vestibulocochlear nerve. On post-mortem examination abscesses can be found in the cranial cavity. It is not easy to diagnose otitis media in the live rabbit. The presence of exudate in the external ear canal does not signify the presence of otitis media. In many pet rabbits, especially lop eared breeds, it is difficult to visualize the tympanic membrane due to the presence of waxy ear secretion. Post-mortem examination of the horizontal ear canal of pet rabbits often reveals the presence of inspissated pus that occludes the horizontal canal. The presence of purulent material in the external ear canal does not necessarily signify the presence of pus in the tympanic bulla. Neither does pus in the tympanic bulla always cause otitis interna and vestibular symptoms (see Section 12.4.3). Radiological changes can often be seen as an incidental finding on skull radiographs (see Figure 13 .2). It seems likely that rabbits with pus in the external ear canal and/or the 327 Cardiorespiratory disease (a) to severe (c); (b) was an incidental finding on a rabbit that was radiographed to investigate his dental disease.; and (c) was of a 3-yearold French Lop male that was rescued by the RSPCA from a small shed containing between 20-30 rabbits.

Dry airways result in increased viscosity of secretions, decreased ciliary function, inflammation, and degeneration of the mucosa. The inclusion of fresh leafy vegetables in the diet can increase a rabbit's fluid intake. Water can be added to inspired gases by the use of humidifiers or placing the rabbit in a steamed-up room such as a bathroom. Nebulization is sometimes used as a method of introducing antibiotic, decongestants and other agents directly into the respiratory tract and to loosen secretions and bring relief. Nebulization introduces charged particles into the respiratory tract as an aerosol. In other species, nebulization is used to treat lower respiratory tract disease. Medication introduced by nebulization is unlikely to reach the tympanic bullae or paranasal sinuses or to penetrate thick mucopurulent exudate in rabbits. Mucolytic agents such as bromexine or N-acetyl-cysteine have been recommended for nebulization in rabbits with rhinitis (Meredith, 2000) . In other species, N-acetyl-cysteine is irritating to mucosal surfaces and can inactivate certain antibiotics when it is mixed with them (McKiernan, 1983) . Systemic bromhexine (Bisolvon, Boehringer Ingelheim) can be used as a mucolytic in rabbits. In cattle and pigs, when bromhexine is administered simultaneously with oxytetracycline, the antibiotic in the bronchial mucus is considerably increased (product datasheet).",

This figure was drawn from a post mortem specimen of a sagittal section through a decalcified head. The nasal conchae have been removed. There are two paranasal sinuses in rabbits: the conchal sinus and the maxillary sinus. There is no frontal sinus. Both the conchal and the maxillary sinus form blind cavities. At the cranial end of each sinus there is a single opening into the nasal passage. The structures of the nasal cavity are illustrated in Figure 3.9. The position of the paranasal sinuses is also illustrated in Figure 7.1. (b) Chronic infection of the conchal sinus.
