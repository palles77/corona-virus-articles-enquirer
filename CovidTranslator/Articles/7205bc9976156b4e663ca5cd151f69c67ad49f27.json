Therefore, this study was conducted to identify nursing students' knowledge, attitudes, practices, and risk perceptions of infection prevention related to occupational exposure to Zika virus infection, and to identify correlations among the related variables. Methods: This cross-sectional study included 249 nursing students from 3 nursing colleges located in 3 Korean cities, with experience in hospital clinical practice. A questionnaire to assess the knowledge, attitudes, practices, and risk perceptions of Zika virus infection was developed through a literature review and was subjected to pilot testing and validation. Results: The level of infection-control knowledge for Zika virus was 54.5 of 100 points, and that of practice was 4.5 of 5 points. The infection-prevention attitude score was 4.4 of 5 points, and the risk-perception score was 2.3 of 5 points. Significant differences emerged in infection-prevention attitude toward Zika virus based on Zika virus vaccination intention. Additionally, practice and risk-perception scores differed significantly based on gender and Zika virus vaccination intention. Knowledge significantly correlated with attitude and attitude toward preventive behavior. Conclusion: Improvement in infection-control knowledge for Zika virus can help improve nurses' related attitudes, which in turn could promote effective practice. Considering the characteristics of nursing students, it is necessary to develop and apply an effective and viable education program related to the prevention of Zika virus infection.",

            "text": "Zika virus was first discovered in 1947 in Zika Forest, Uganda [1] . A human case was reported in 1952 and about 28,000 people were infected in Polynesia in 2013 [2] . The association of Zika virus with Guillain-Barre syndrome was first proposed by Duong et al. [2] . Zika virus infection in pregnant women is also a known cause of serious birth defects in children. In February 2016, the World Health Organization declared Zika virus infection a public health emergency and an international issue [3, 4] . In Korea, 3347 Zika virus diagnostic tests were conducted in 2016, and 16 of them were diagnosed as Zika virus infections. Zika virus is designated and managed as a legal infectious disease since 2016 in Korea [5, 6] . Between 2016 and 2017, 28 patients with Zika virus infection were reported from a national surveillance system. An analysis on demographic, epidemiological, and clinical characteristics of those infected with Zika virus indicated that they had traveled overseas, for mostly short-term visits, to Southeast Asian countries [5] . Zika virus is transmitted by the infected Aedes aegypti mosquito and is not transmitted by routine contact, but it is known to spread through the placenta, breast milk, saliva, blood transfusion, and sexual intercourse [7] . Moreover, the estimated rate of asymptomatic Zika infection, as described in other arboviruses such as West Nile virus and dengue, is reportedly high [4] . Recently, a case was reported in which an experimenter was infected with Zika virus due to a needle stick injury in the laboratory setting https [6, 8] . Therefore, there is a renewed need for attention to bloodborne diseases for health care workers (HCWs), who are at high risk for exposure to infections through blood or body fluids such as Zika virus, HIV, and Ebola virus [9, 10] . Nursing students experience nursing care at the clinical site during their clinical practice [11] . Consequently, they are also involved in clinical practice related to blood-borne infections during the practice period. However, nurses lack expertise regarding this situation and lack interest in self-protection against the associated risk of infection, leading to a greater risk of exposure to blood-borne infections [12] . Nursing students' recapping habits could last even after they become nurse. Indeed, it is difficult to change inappropriate nursing habits once they have developed, which may lead to an increase in the incidence of blood-borne infections after students start working as nurses [11] .",

Because Zika virus can spread through blood and body fluids, nurses and other HCWs are at risk of exposure to Zika virus during their work. As the number of Zika virus-infected patients is increasing worldwide, nursing students engaging in clinical practice could also be exposed to the risk of Zika virus infection [9, 10] . Therefore, Zika virus infection-prevention measures in hospitals must include not only HCWs but also nursing students. The present study is meaningful in that it examined the actual condition of Zika virus-related knowledge, attitudes, practices, and risk perceptions in nursing students, who are the future experts who will cope with new bloodborne infections.",

Additionally, OSHA and CDC advise HCWs to follow the standard precaution to prevent the blood-borne spread of Zika [9, 10] , including hand hygiene, use of PPE, and prevention of needle-stick injuries [8] . However, as reported by Kim et al. [19] , nursing stu-dents are at higher risk of exposure to needle-stick injuries than other HCWs because they lack expertise and proficiency. Therefore, nursing students should acquire proper knowledge on blood-borne diseases and should pay more attention on their exposure. In the present study, the average nursing students' level of knowledge on infection control related to Zika virus was relatively low. Studies on general knowledge of Zika virus in nursing students have been limited. As the rate of correct understanding of Zika virus was 58% among nurse practitioners in the United States [14] and only 35% (against the 80% cut-off level) among doctors [13] , it is evident that knowledge about Zika virus is generally low not only among nursing students but also among other HCWs. However, by subcategory, nursing students' knowledge level regarding clinical infection prevention practice was relatively high. Nursing students were well informed that the Zika virus could be transmitted through the blood. Nursing students had learned the standard precaution in their fundamentals of nursing [20] . Therefore, scores regarding the prevention of infection and attitude toward preventive measures such as the use of PPEs, not recapping syringe needles, and the use of the needle waste container were relatively fair. The lowest scores were obtained on the subcategories of treatment and symptoms. Nursing students did not have adequate knowledge about the symptoms of Zika virus, except for fever, and were not well aware of the possibility of Guillain-Barre syndrome (the rate of correct answers was 25.9%). Further, 81.9% of the nursing students responded that they did not have educational experience related to Zika virus. These results suggest the need for education to promote knowledge about Zika virus among nursing students, which includes women of childbearing age. Further, such education should be provided systematically as a part of the curriculum to protect nursing students, who are future nurses, from Zika virus infection. In particular, education in areas of little knowledge, such as treatment and symptoms, should be considered. According to the previous study [13] , female gender was a significant predictor of knowledge in Indonesian physicians. However, in the present study, data analysis on the differences based on gender was not performed. Approximately 90% of nursing students are women in South Korea [21] . In the present study, 11% of the participants were men.",

Furthermore, positive attitude is associated with knowledge on Zika virus infection. The present study revealed that Zika virus infection-control knowledge significantly correlated with attitude, and that attitude significantly correlated with practice. This finding indicates that the improvement of nursing students' knowledge on Zika virus infection prevention could change their attitude, which in turn could effectively promote infection-control practices. Nursing students' continue to practice their skills related to the prevention of blood-borne infectious diseases even after they become nurses [11] . Therefore, it is essential to improve infection-control practices, attitudes, and knowledge regarding the blood-borne transmission of newly emerging infections such as Zika virus infection, owing to globalization. The results of the present study can thus be used as basic data for the development and implementation of effective and viable educational programs for nursing students.",
