CypA suppresses T-cell activation through cyclosporine (Cs) complexation and is required for effective HIV-1 replication in host cells. We show that CypA is acetylated in diverse human cell lines and use a synthetically evolved acetyl-lysyl-tRNA synthetase/tRNA CUA pair to produce recombinant acetylated CypA in E. coli. We determine atomic resolution structures of acetylated CypA and its complexes with Cs and HIV-1 capsid. Acetylation dramatically inhibits CypA catalysis of cis to trans isomerisation and stabilises cis rather than trans forms of the HIV-1 capsid. Furthermore, CypA acetylation antagonizes the immunosuppressive effects of Cs, by inhibiting the sequential steps of Cs binding and calcineurin inhibition. Our results reveal that acetylation regulates key functions of CypA in immunity and viral infection and provide a general set of mechanisms by which acetylation modulates interactions to regulate cell function.",

Cyclophilin A (CypA), the archetypal cyclophilin, is central to protein folding 1 , signal transduction 2 , trafficking 3 , receptor assembly 4 , cell cycle regulation 5 and stress response and has an expanding catalog of roles 6 . Two of CypA's most important roles in human health are in controlling immunosuppression and viral infection. CypA is the target of the widely-used immunosuppressive, cyclosporine (Cs, 1). The complex formed by CypA and Cs binds to and allosterically inhibits calcineurin, a protein phosphatase, leading to suppression of the T-cell mediated immune response via an IL-2 mediated downregulation of T-cell activation 7 . CypA is also an essential host protein in the efficient replication of a number of viruses including vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) 5 , severe acute respiratory syndrome virus (SARS) 6 , hepatitis C 8 , vaccinia virus (VV) and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) 9, 10 . During HIV-1 infection, CypA interacts with the capsid protein gag and is packaged into budding HIV-1 virions 9, 10 . Inhibition of CypA by Cs substantially decreases viral titer in human cells 11 . The importance of CypA in lentiviral replication is underscored by the fact that two different primate species have independently evolved antiviral restriction factors that use a retrotransposed copy of CypA to provide viral targeting 12 . Despite the importance of CypA in immunosuppression, viral infection, and other key cellular processes the molecular mechanisms by which the varied and critical functions of CypA are regulated remains unclear.",

However, since there are many CypA gene fusions in the genome, the origin of this peptide is ambiguous. Here we show that the free enzyme form of CypA is acetylated in human cells. We produce homogeneously and site-specifically acetylated recombinant CypA using an acetyllysyl-tRNA synthetase/ tRNA CUA pair that co-translationally directs the incorporation of acetyl-lysine in response to an amber codon 18 placed in a CypA gene. This approach allows us to perform structural and biophysical measurements on acetylated CypA for the first time. These results reveal how acetylation modulates key functions of CypA, including suppressing its catalytic activity, cyclosporine binding and calcineurin inhibition and altering its recognition of the HIV-1 capsid. Furthermore, the molecular details of these affects establish a general set of mechanisms by which acetylation can regulate protein activity.",

Detection by western blot using an anti-CypA antibody demonstrated that endogenous CypA is present in the cell extract ( Figure 1a ). Detection using an anti-acetyl-lysine antibody showed that this endogenous CypA is acetylated in both HeLa and Jurkat T cells (Figure 1b) . Importantly, the anti-acetyl-lysine antibody did not detect the unacetylated control ( Figure  1b) . These data conclusively demonstrated that CypA is acetylated in human cells, including T cells where CypA mediates its effects on immunosuppresion and HIV-1 infection. To determine the proportion of endogenous CypA that is acetylated in each cell type we performed an immunodepletion experiment. Acetylated CypA was depleted from lysate using an anti-acetyl-lysine antibody bound to protein A sepharose. The depleted material was compared by western blot with an anti-CypA antibody to non-depleted material processed in the absence of the anti-acetyl-lysine antibody (Figure 1c ). To obtain a quantitative estimate of the proportion of acetylated CypA, we performed a standardization experiment with varying ratios of acetylated:nonacetylated recombinant protein (Supplementary Figure 1) . Using this standardization we estimated that 50% \u00b1 5% of CypA is acetylated in HeLa cells and 38% \u00b1 3% in Jurkat T cells. These results indicated that a substantial proportion of CypA is acetylated in both HeLa and Jurkat T cells. While we expect the proportion of acetylated protein to be regulated in response to stimuli these results demonstrated that the effects of acetylation on CypA are relevant to, and important for, understanding CypA mediated processes.",

Recombinant acetylated cyclophilin was purified at greater than 10 mg per liter of culture, in the presence of 20 mM nicotinamide to inhibit cobB, an NAD dependent deacetylase present in E. coli.

By screening a range of pH and salt conditions using absorbance at 320 nm as a measure of aggregation we found that the stability of acetylated CypA increases dramatically in acidic buffers (pH 5.4-6.4). Under mildly acidic conditions acetylated CypA was still soluble at concentrations around 3 mM. This suggested that K125 has a prominent role in surface electrostatics and that its acetylation has a significant impact on CypA behavior. To assess the affect of acetylation on the physicochemistry of CypA we determined the native crystal structure. Acetylated CypA crystallized in two different forms, one in an orthorhombic spacegroup and one in a trigonal spacegroup. We determined the structure of both forms in order to assess crystal packing affects. Crystal contacts are provided in Supplementary Table 1 . The structures were refined to 1.2 \u00c5 and 1.4 \u00c5 respectively, with two copies in the asymmetric unit in the case of the trigonal crystal and a single copy in the orthorhombic crystal. These are the first structures containing a specific, biologically relevant post-translational lysine acetylation. In both CypA structures there is clear density for the acetyllysine side-chain, as evidenced by the omit maps (Figure 2a,b) . This further demonstrates the homogeneity of acetyllysine incorporation and shows that the acetyllysine has a well-defined conformation. Finally, both structures and both chains from the trigonal crystal superpose closely with only minimal differences in the extreme N-terminal residues (Figure 2c ).",

Comparison of the active sites reveals differences in only three residues F60, R55 and K125. The F60 side-chain of trigonal chain A is rotated 90\u00b0c ompared to the other structures. This is due to crystal contacts between F60 and its symmetry-related copy. F60, together with M61 and F113, form a hydrophobic core at the base of the substrate binding-pocket. R55 is a key catalytic residue, facilitating catalysis through stabilisation of the proline in the transition state 20 . Differences in the side-chain orientation of R55 in the acetylated and non-acetylated structures are likely to result from the inherent flexibility required in this region to accommodate diverse CypA substrates. Acetylation of CypA does not therefore appear to distort its conformation or substantially rearrange the active-site. However, acetylation does have a dramatic affect on surface electrostatics. Calculation of the surface electrostatic potential using the Adaptive Poisson-Boltzmann Solver (APBS) shows that K125 provides the strongest patch of positive charge in the active site ( Figure 2e&f ) and that this charge is largely neutralized by the acetyl group. Such a dramatic shift in electrostatics correlates with our observation that acetylation switches CypA from requiring a basic to an acidic environment.",

Under conditions where Cs is in excess, and equal amounts of CypA:Cs are formed with the acetylated and non-acetylated cyclophilin we find a Ki for the nonacetylated complex of 497 nM, which is similar to the inhibition constants previously measured for this interaction 22 . Acetylation reduced the calcineurin inhibition constant (Ki) by 2-fold to 972 nM (Supplementary Figure 5) . The potency of Cs immunosuppression is determined by the affinity of Cs for CypA and the efficiency with which the CypA: Cs complex inhibits calcineurin. Since we have shown that acetylated CypA binds Cs 20-fold more weakly than the non-acetylated CypA, and since the acetylated CypA:Cs complex mediates a 2-fold decrease in calcineurin inhibition the total effect of acetylation on CypAmediated immunosupression may be multiplicatively larger than either of these individual effects.

In this assay, cleavage of a nitroanilide peptide substrate by chymotrypsin (Suc-AAPF-pNA) was detected by measuring the absorbance of liberated 4-nitroaniline. The peptide is also a substrate for CypA and contains a proline residue that at equilibrium is approximately 90% trans and 10% cis. The trans form of the peptide is readily cleaved by chymotrypsin whereas the cis form can only be cleaved following its isomerisation by CypA. Previous studies have used steady-state methods to determine the k cat /K M of CypA isomerisation, however this results in loss of data during mixing of the reaction components. Moreover, this approach cannot differentiate the two kinetic events and therefore does not take into account any contribution of the fast cleavage of trans peptide to the apparent rate of isomerisation. We have used a stopped-flow spectrophotometer, which allows pre-steady state measurement (due to rapid mixing <1ms) and the resolution of separate kinetic events. Using our stopped-flow method we observe two discrete phases in 4-nitroaniline production, corresponding to a fast cleavage step and a slower isomerisation step (Figure 4a) . The molecular processes underpinning the fast and slow steps are confirmed by their relative amplitudes, which correspond closely to the expected cis/trans distribution of the substrate such that the slower isomerisation step represents ~10% of the total amplitude change. By fitting each experiment to a double exponential we obtained an accurate measurement of the apparent rate of cis to trans isomerisation at different CypA concentrations. The k cat /K M was then calculated by fitting the increase in apparent rate (k obs ) with increasing CypA concentrations (E) to k obs = (k cat /K M )[E]. Comparison of CypA to acetylated CypA reveals that acetylation dramatically decreases k cat /K M by 35-fold from 1\u00d710 7 M \u22121 s \u22121 to 3\u00d710 5 M \u22121 s \u22121 (Figure 4b ).",

Inhibition of the CypA:HIV-1 capsid interaction by Cs or mutation of the CypA-binding-loop reduces infectivity 10, 11, 24, 25 . NMR measurements demonstrate that the G89-P90 peptide bond in HIV-1 capsid is isomerized by CypA, and it has been proposed that CypA may catalyse the disassembly of viral capsid 26 . To investigate how acetylation affects the thermodynamics of CypA:capsid interaction we performed isothermal titration calorimetry. We found that the acetylated and non-acetylated forms of CypA bind HIV-1 capsid with similar affinities. However, acetylation altered the thermodynamics of interaction ( Table 1 ). The interaction of nonacetylated CypA and HIV1-CA N was mainly enthalpy driven (\u22127.4 kcal/mol), whereas the entropic contribution was only marginal (0.6 kcal/mol). Acetylation substantially reduced enthalpic favourability (by 2.8 kcal/mol) but this was compensated for by an increase in entropy (by 1.8 kcal/mol). The replacement of glutamine for lysine has often been used to mimic acetyllysine and the effects of acetylation. We used ITC characterization of capsid binding to determine how effective glutamine is as a substitute. The affinity of the glutamine mutant K125Q was decreased in comparison to the acetylated CypA (Table 1) . Furthermore the thermodynamics of K125Q binding to capsid was similar to unacetylated CypA. This indicated that glutamine is not a good mimic of acetyllysine in this case.",

The major difference between the two structures is that whilst both copies of the capsid in the non-acetylated structure are bound with their G89-P90 peptide bond in a trans conformation, in both copies in the acetylated structure the GP peptide bond is in a cis conformation (Figure 5b&c ). This change in HIV-1 capsid binding from trans to cis is a direct result of acetylation of K125. In the non-acetylated complex the trans G89 peptide oxygen is orientated towards the positive electrostatic patch provided by K125 and H126, in the acetylated complex the oxygen is orientated away. This altered substrate binding correlates with our solution data on the affect of acetylation on CypA catalysis. Enzymatic characterization showed that acetylation inhibits isomerisation and reduced k cat /K M by 35fold ( Figure 4) . Altered HIV-1 binding, namely the switch from trans to cis proline in the HIV-1 complex, is consistent with this reduced k cat /K M , which is a measure of cis to trans isomerisation. In addition to switching cis/trans preference through charge neutralisation, the acetyl-lysine also stabilized the cis conformation of HIV-1 capsid by making new hydrogen bond and hydrophobic interactions. The methyl group of the acetyl moiety forms a new hydrophobic interaction with an alternative side-chain conformer of I91. This interaction results in main-chain changes that are propagated to C-terminal residues A92 and P93, altering their interactions in turn. In the non-acetylated complex P93 forms a hydrophobic stacking interaction with CypA residue W121. The rearrangement in the position of P93 caused by acetylation leads to an alternative stacking interaction with the aromatic ring of conserved CypA residue F60. Finally, the acetyl-lysine mediates a new water network involving the side-chain of highly conserved H126, the main-chain amide of I91 and two water molecules (Figure 5b ). Acetylated CypA therefore stabilises the HIV-1 capsid in its cis form by engaging residues C-terminal to the isomerized proline P90 in a different conformation. This correlates with the proposed catalytic pathway for nitroanilide peptide substrates, in which the position of residues C-terminal to the isomerized proline alters according to whether the peptide binds in cis or trans 28 .",

We have solved the first high-resolution crystal structures of an acetylated protein, both in its free form and in complex with small molecules and protein ligands. These structures and accompanying biochemical and biophysical studies reveal that CypA acetylation antagonizes sequential binding and catalytic activities in the pathway that regulates the immunosuppressive effects of Cs, decreases the catalytic efficiency of CypA cis to trans isomerisation 35-fold and switches the binding of CypA from trans to cis HIV-1 capsid.",

Identifying the acetyltransferases and deacetylases that modulate CypA acetylation levels will be important in exploring how CypA acetylation modulates function in response to stimuli such as immune stimulation. CypA is widely expressed yet different tissues display different CypA phenotypes. For instance, Cs and its derivatives are potent inhibitors and widely-used immunosuppressives but they have limited off-target effects. A study on calcineurin inhibition by Cs in different tissues found wide variation in potency that was not always explicable by variation in CypA levels 29 . Furthermore, HIV-1 interaction with CypA in different cell lines and different species gives rise to diverse and unpredictable phenotypes 30, 31 . Differences in acetylation levels in different tissues may underpin some of this variation.",

            "text": "In binding to HIV-1 capsid, as in binding to Cs, acetylation mediates its effects through changes in both the charge and water network in the active site. However, in the case of HIV-1 binding (and in contrast to Cs) acetylation also mediates changes in the orientation of key interaction residues, generating new interactions and abolishing interactions present in the unacetylated complex. Disassembly of the viral capsid is an essential step in HIV-1 infection and may be catalysed by CypA isomerisation of the G89-P90 peptide bond 26 . By reducing CypA activity, as indicated both by the enzyme kinetics and the altered substrate binding in the complexed structure, acetylation may interfere with this process and reduce viral infectivity. In addition to HIV-1, Hepatitis C (HCV) has also been shown to require CypA for efficient replication 8 . As CypA inhibitors represent potential anti-HCV drugs 32 , it will be interesting to see whether acetylation impacts on the role of CypA in HCV replication. Finally, CypA is part of a larger CypA family, including proteins such as CypB that are almost identical in sequence yet have discrete specificities 33 . Post-translational modification of CypA but not CypB may have a role in differentiating their function. Acetylation may inhibit binding to some substrates but allow CypA to isomerize new ones.",

Enzymatic modification with HATs is generally non-quantitative 35 and leads to heterogeneity in the site and extent of acetylation. These methods of acetylation lead to nonhomogenous samples that are unsuitable for quantitative biophysical studies or structural biology. Our experiments demonstrate that homogeneously and site specifically acetylated proteins that are suitable for structural studies and quantitative measurements can be made in excellent yield using an acetyllysyl-tRNA synthetase/tRNA CUA pair 18 .
