Rarely is a specific allergen identified and, like its counterparts in allergic skin diseases, the diagnosis is based upon the failure to demonstrate infectious or mechanical causes, response to corticosteroid therapy, and sometimes a convincing association with environmental changes. Biopsy is rarely warranted, but when taken during the acute disease may show epithelial changes ranging from erosion to hyperplasia to squamous metaplasia, with eosinophils around dilated subepithelial blood vessels and percolating throughout the epithelium. Eosinophils are much more likely to be identified in cats than in dogs, a species difference that is also true of allergic skin disease in general. More chronic lesions, which are the more usual to be biopsied, have squamous metaplasia and lymphocytic-plasmacytic subepithelial infiltrates and the formation of lymphoid nodules.",

Those nonseptic defects involving epithelium alone, or epithelium and supeoqcial stroma, heal by epithelial sliding followed after about 24 hours by mitosis. One cannot claim that depth alone is the deciding factor, since even very deep wounds will sometimes heal just with epithelial sliding and eventual mitotic rebuilding, as long as the epithelium is satisfied with the quality of the underlying stroma. The sliding begins within a few hours, initially from wing cells from the immediately adjacent, viable cornea. Migration by basal cells rapidly follows. The sliding is preceded by lysis of the hemidesmosomes. Adhesion of the sliding epithelium is initially to adhesion molecules like fibronectin and laminin deposited along the exposed stromal surface. Reformation of the hemidesmosomes and their anchoring filaments may take weeks or even months, during which time epithelial adhesion remains precarious.

Such cells, when recruited for corneal wound healing, seem prone to retaining a conjunctival phenotype that includes pigmentation and a tendency to form rete ridges. One of the characteristics by which we recognize chronic, stubborn corneal ulceration is to observe this conjunctival \"metaplasia\" of the suoCace epithelium.Another is to recognize a thickened basement membrane, as the regenerating epithelium always seems to produce its own new basement membrane even if preexisting basement membrane still seems available. If the injurious stimulus disappears, the conjunctival character of the epithelium slowly fades, being replaced within a few weeks by a normal corneal epithelial configuration. Epithelial adhesion to the underlying stroma remains fragile for 6-8 weeks until the hemidesmosomal attachments of epithelium to basal lamina reform, and until the new epithelium secretes type VII collagen fibrils that anchor the basal lamina to the stroma. In the interim, the cells adhere to a mixture of fibrin and fibronectin derived from the inflamed conjunctival vessels via the tear film or from the injured cornea itself. In many cases, the only evidence of previous shallow ulceration is a thickened basal lamina resulting from secretion by the regenerating epithelium, and gentle undulation of the normally flat epithelial-stromal interface.",

This 4-day lag time is, presumably, a period of grace in which small or shallow defects can heal with epithelial regeneration alone, without the visual impairment that inevitably follows stromal fibroplasia. Once the epithelium seals the defect, there is immediate cessation of neutrophilic influx and, presumably, a similarly abrupt drop in the production of fibroblastic/angioplastic stimulatory cytokines. The scarring and vascularization that are the manifestations of stromal rebuilding are permanent, even though the fibrous tissue gradually becomes less cellular, the collagen fibrils reorient to resemble more closely the parallel arrays of normal stroma, and the ground substance gradually reverts from an embryonic configuration dominated by chondroitin sulfate to the normal predominance of keratan sulfate. Complete restitution of normal stroma, however, never occurs, although the residual scar may be subtle and better detected by clinical examination than by histology.

The lesion refuses to heal, or repeatedly re-ulcerates, because of poor adhesion of the epithelium to the underlying stroma. The defect appears not to be in epithelial healing per se, since sliding and mitotic activity are normal in affected dogs. Keratectomy specimens reveal poorly adherent hyperplastic epithelium at the ulcer margins, usually with multiple clefts separating epithelium from stroma even in areas distant from the obvious ulcer (Fig. 4.31) . The basal lamina is usually not visible with light microscopy, and the epithelium appears to be attempting to adhere to a thin zone of hypocellular, pale-staining stroma that could correctly be interpreted as a very shallow sequestrum qualitatively similar to what was described above in cats. The observation of pyknotic and lyric keratocyte nuclei within this supegTcial zone suggests that the basic defect is degeneration of the supe~cial stroma, so that epithelial hemidesmosomes and anchoring collagen fibrils attempting to reform after ulceration have no substrate in which to anchor.Very chronic cases usually acquire superficial stromal granulation tissue appropriate to any chronic ulceration, but its onset is much delayed in comparison to infectious or traumatic ulcers.",

By the time we see them, almost all are ulcerated or show extensive stromal scarring below a healed ulcer. Regardless of cause, corneal inflammation initially follows the stereotyped sequence of edema and leukocyte immigration from tears and distant limbic venules.With severe lesions, corneal stromal vascularization, fibrosis and epithelial metaplasia with pigmentation may occur. Keratitis usually results from physical, chemical, or microbial injury to the cornea, but the cornea may also be affected by extension of disease from elsewhere in the eye, adnexa, or conjunctiva.

Imbibition causes superficial stromal edema below the ulcer and is followed by immigration of neutrophils from the tear film and, later, from the limbus. The leukocytes, while somewhat protective against opportunistic pathogens, also add their collagenases, proteases, and stimulatory cytokines to the wound and thereby may contribute to its progression. Epithelial and stromal repair proceeds as already described for corneal wound healing, but the repair fails in those cases in which microbial contamination is well established or in which the cause of the initial ulceration has not been corrected.

However, these opportunists contribute significantly to the perpetuation and worsening of the lesion. Proteases and collagenases of microbial, leukocytic, or corneal origin progressively liquefy corneal stroma, a process termed keratomalacia (Fig. 4.32) . Ulcers contaminated by Pseudomonas and Streptococcus spp. are particularly prone to rapid liquefaction because of the potent collagenases and proteases produced by these organisms. Pseudomonas ulcers have been extensively investigated because of the devastating liquefaction of cornea that commonly accompanies this infection. The bacteria themselves produce numerous proteases and other toxins that may be important in the establishment of the early infection, but most of the characteristic stromal malacia results from the action of proteases originating from leukocytes, reactive corneal epithelium, or injured stroma. The stroma contains a variety of proenzymes (for collagenases, elastases, gelatinases, and other stromal lysins) that are cleaved by the Pseudomonas toxins to produce the active enzymes. Which toxins are produced, and in what quantities, is very strain dependent. The stepwise degradation of stroma is seen histologically as a featureless eosinophilic coagulum, which occurs with progressive septic ulcers regardless of the species of bacterium. Neutrophils may encircle the liquefying focus as a thick wall of live and fragmented cells. The resulting localized suppurative keratomalacia is called a ring abscess (Fig. 4.33) , although that terminology is rarely used today. It is seen more commonly in cattle than any other species, perhaps because of the prevalence of untreated, contaminated corneal ulcers in that species and the prevalence of septic corneal perforation.",

Stromal liquefaction that reaches Descemet's membrane results in its forward bulging as a descemetocele. This membrane, while resistant to penetration of the microbial agents themselves, is apparently permeable to inflammatory mediators and microbial toxins that diffuse into the anterior chamber. These chemicals, combined with a vasoactive sensory neural reflex from irritated cornea, are responsible for the vasodilation and exudation in anterior uvea that are seen histologically in virtually all globes with deep ulcerative keratitis. Even in nonpefforating keratitis, the anterior uveal inflammation may result in sufficient fibrin exudation so as to predispose to focal adhesions of iris to lens or (rarely) to cornea. In the case of corneal perforation, the iris flows forward to plug the defect (iris prolapse) and may subsequently become incorporated into the corneal scarring. This outcome is usually called anterior staphyloma, meaning a focal defect in the ocular fibrous tunic (i.e., cornea) that becomes lined by uvea (Fig. 4.34A, B) .

In those cases in which the desiccation occurs only in a horizontal band not adequately covered by the eyelids for whatever reason, the lesion is sometimes referred to as band keratopathy.",

Most cases are chronic, progressive, and idiopathic. The reason for greater than expected prevalence in certain breeds (English Bulldog, Lhasa Apso, Shih Tzu, West Highland White Terrier, and others) is unknown. Because the disease is amenable to medical or surgical management, few specimens are available for histologic examination until the very chronic stages. At this time, the lacrimal gland is atrophic with interstitial lymphoid infiltration and fibrosis, but provides no clue as to the initial lesion. The ability of certain immune modulators, notably cyclosporine, to reverse the disease, points to some kind of immune-mediated phenomenon, perhaps autoimmunity. The corneal changes vary with the severity and rapidity of onset of lacrimal deficiency. In acute disease with marked lacrimal deficiency, clinical signs of ulcerative keratitis may occur. The corneal epithelium is thinned, has numerous hydropically degenerate cells, and may suffer full-thickness ulceration. The accompanying stromal changes, including eventual vascularization and fibrosis, are those of ulcerative keratitis. More commonly in dogs, however, the desiccation is not absolute (at least initially) and the epithelial response is protective epidermalization without prior ulceration. Keratinization, marked hyperplasia with rete ridge formation, and pigmentation are commonly seen. Stromal inflammation and vascularization are usually superficial, resulting in a lesion very similar to pannus keratitis. Squamous metaplasia may also occur in the bulbar conjunctiva.The conjunctivitis that clinically is the earliest lesion of keratoconjunctivitis sicca is rarely available for histologic examination.",

Concurrent mild respiratory disease may be present, but in adults the disease is often purely corneal and may even be unilateral.

Scrapings of the surface of the lesion reveal numerous eosinophils and fewer mast cells and other mononuclear leukocytes. Eosinophils may be less conspicuous on histologic examination of keratectomy specimens, perhaps because most seem determined to emigrate through the epithelium and into the tear film rather than remain within the tissue. Instead, the stromal lesion is a mixture of macrophages, plasma cells, fibroblasts and, unpredictably, mast cells and at least a few eosinophils.The latter are least frequent in older lesions, either because of time alone or because older lesions are more likely to have received a lot of corticosteroid therapy. A characteristic lesion, not present in every case, is a dense granular eosinophilic coagulum along the surface of the keratectomy specimen. It seems to consist of free eosinophil granules. No bacterial or fungal agents have been seen.While there are histologic similarities to cutaneous eosinophilic ulcer and linear granuloma, no statistical association has been proven and the lack of understanding even of the cutaneous eosinophilic lesions makes such attempted comparisons of very limited value.

Fungi are numerous within the malacia of the deep stroma and within Descemet's membrane itself, but rarely if ever are seen within the anterior chamber (Fig. 4.35A ). When they occur within the anterior chamber, they are always anchored to the nearby Descemet's membrane.

Earlier skepticism about the virulence of M. boris, based upon the unreliability of reproduction of the disease, isolation of the organism from apparently healthy cattle, and failure of isolation from some overtly affected cattle, has been overcome by detailed information on the pathogenesis of the disease. It is now clear that virulence of M. boris is associated with hemolytic, leukocytolytic, piliated strains that predominate only in the eyes of affected cattle. Pathogenic isolates of M. boris express a calcium-dependent transmembrane pore-forming cytotoxin. Nonpiliated, nonhemolytic strains predominate in healthy cattle and are probably part of the normal conjunctival flora. The use of immunofluorescence has demonstrated M. boris in many of the naturally occurring cases for which the results of culture were negative. In naturally occurring outbreaks, the number of isolations of hemolytic M. boris falls to almost zero as the outbreak wanes, but a few chronically affected carriers remain as the most important source of virulent bacteria for outbreaks of disease in the next summer.",

Calves are usually affected more severely than cattle over 2 years of age, although absolute resistance to infection seems fragile. The protective effect of serum antibody against the disease is controversial. Specific IgA is found in tears of infected calves, and there is substantial evidence that locally produced IgA is strongly protective. Following experimental inoculation of virulent M. bovis onto the cornea, pilus-mediated adhesion and production of bacterial cytotoxin result in microscopic ulceration in as little as 12 hours. Initial adhesion is to older surface epithelium (\"dark cells\") and results in the development of microscopic pits in the cell surface. Moraxella is found within degenerate epithelial cells, but it is not known whether invasion is necessary for subsequent cellular destruction. Infield epizootics, the earliest lesion is bulbar conjunctival edema and hyperemia, followed in 24-48 hours by the appearance ofa shallow central corneal ulcer. The ulcer is a small (<0.5 cm) focus of epithelial necrosis that may appear as erosion, vesicle, or full-thickness epithelial loss. In untreated animals destined to develop the full clinical expression, the ulcer enlarges, deepens, and frequently attracts enough neutrophils to qualifj as a corneal abscess. Stromal liquefaction ensues, probably as a result of neutrophil lysis, which is itself initiated by Moraxella-derived leukotoxins. By the end of the first week, there is extensive stromal edema and vascularization extending from the 1imbus.A~ with any severe ulcerative keratitis, the subsequent progression or regression of the lesion varies with each case as modifications by therapy, opportunistic bacterial and fungal contamination, trauma, inflammation, and immunity interact. Keratomalacia frequently leads to forward coning of the weakened cornea (keratoconus). In most instances, whether treated or not, the cornea heals by sloughing of necrotic tissue and filling of the defect by granulation tissue. Re-epithelialization may take up to a month, leaving a cornea that is slightly coned and variably scarred.
