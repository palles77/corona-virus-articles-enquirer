            "text": "G iven its potential to cause an acute global health crisis with many millions of deaths, pandemic influenza can rightly be considered the greatest single threat to global health security. Yet despite this threat, influenza has recently been eclipsed in the popular and scientific consciousness by less common infections, such as those caused by Ebola and Zika viruses. The centenary of the 1918 influenza pandemic, which is estimated to have killed 50 million people, is an opportune time to remind ourselves that the greatest risks often lay in the mundane. Much like we need reminding that driving is far more dangerous than flying, familiarity can breed contempt.",

The mostly likely source of a pandemic virus is the pool of influenza viruses that infect animals such as wild birds (the natural reservoir of influenza A viruses), domestic poultry and pigs. The scale of pig and poultry farming has increased massively over the past 50 years, with the estimated global number of pigs and chickens having increased roughly twofold and fivefold, respectively, from the early 1960s until now (from 400 million to around 1 billion pigs; and 4 billion to 20 billion chickens) 1 . Swine influenza is endemic in pig populations, with co-circulation of multiple subtypes and the intermittent introduction of new strains from avian or human sources, whilst poultry populations are affected by an increasing variety of influenza viruses. Human infections with a diverse range of zoonotic influenza viruses are now being detected ( Fig. 1) , some of which are associated with a high case fatality rate, and some of which have mutations that confer resistance to the major classes of influenza antiviral drugs.",

The recent lifting by the US National Institutes of Health of their moratorium 3 on funding of so-called 'gain-of-function' experiments (laboratory experiments where viruses are genetically altered to assess the effect on properties such as transmissibility and virulence) is good news, as it allows us to explore the limits of evolution and the genotypic predictors of phenotype 4 . However, there are limits to the predictive value of laboratory experiments and animal models, and when a new pandemic virus does emerge, which inevitably it will, the most important measure will be the disease severity per infected person. This information is crucial for understanding the potential impact of the pandemic and appropriately calibrating the political and public health response. Estimating the severity per infected person requires robust and real-time data on the number of people infected and the proportion within this group that develop severe disease 5 . Such data are surprisingly hard to gather and interpret because care-seeking and care-giving behaviour can change as awareness of a pandemic and pressures on healthcare change. This is an area that requires investment in methodologies and tools for gathering the necessary input data, including potential modifying factors such as care-seeking behaviour, and feeding that data into analytic frameworks for estimating the severity per infected person.",

These models are attractive to public health officials as they provide a quantitative answer to many questions, but most importantly to: \"how bad is this and how bad might it get?\" A promising approach to even faster and more reliable characterization of outbreaks is 'modeldriven data collection' , which tells us \"how much data to collect and when to collect it\" in order to improve the predictive power of the models and to maximize the efficiency of data collection 6 . This concept should be tested by developing and piloting modeldriven data collection systems for seasonal or zoonotic influenza, to see what and how much data are needed to provide estimates of the severity per infected person that are sufficiently reliable to be actionable.",

If a potential pandemic influenza virus acquires the ability to readily transmit between humans, it will spread with alarming speed and essentially become unstoppable. Aeroplane transportation is the greatest facilitator of rapid global spread 7 , yet airport screening has limited ability to prevent importation and at best can lead to a short delay (less than two weeks) in the onset of local transmission 8, 9 . At a national level, measures to limit local transmission, such as school closure, can have some effect in reducing community transmission and can mitigate pressures on the healthcare system by reducing peak incidence. The effect is, however, dependent on timing and coordination and therefore requires access to real-time surveillance data, such as absenteeism 10, 11 . The simultaneous use of face comment masks and hand hygiene together, targeting both aerosol and contact transmission, can reduce spread under laboratory conditions, although the effectiveness of these measures as a community-wide intervention is unproven 12 . Whilst neuraminidase inhibitors (NAIs) have been demonstrated to be effective in reducing symptomatic influenza and intra-household transmission when used prophylactically, there are no data on the effectiveness or cost effectiveness of NAI use in reducing community-wide transmission 13 . Therefore, the stockpiling of NAIs by individual countries could permit prophylactic use that may reduce the local impact of a pandemic, but at the global level NAIs are not likely to have a significant role in reducing pandemic influenza transmission.",

Given the weak evidence of an impact on severe outcomes, the NAI oseltamivir has recently been 'downgraded' to the complementary part of the WHO Essential Medicines List, only to be used for critically ill patients hospitalized with influenza 20 . It is, therefore, hard to see NAIs having a significant global impact on the rate of hospitalization or death in any future pandemic. In addition to the weak evidence of an impact on severe outcomes, the existence of viral genetic variants that confer considerable resistance to NAIs make it clear that new antivirals for influenza are needed. There are candidates in clinical development but progress is slow, and companies have favoured evaluating new candidate drugs in patients with uncomplicated influenza, since this is the bigger market. What is needed is a large influenza clinical trials network that can evaluate multiple candidates and combination therapies (including antiviral combinations and host-directed therapies) in an adaptive platform trial, as has been achieved for cancer, for example with the I-SPY2 platform trial 21 .",

The two simple interventions that can save lives are antibiotics and oxygen.

Despite the widespread availability of antibiotics, only around half of children with pneumonia in LMICs receive care from a healthcare provider who can give appropriate antibiotics 23 . Although oxygen therapy is considered an essential medicine, reliable access to oxygen is absent in much of the world due to technical and cost challenges 24 . The other intervention likely to have a major impact is pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs). These vaccines have been shown to reduce the risk of influenza-associated pneumococcal disease 25 , and an analysis in China suggests that routine PCV immunization prior to a pandemic would have a major impact on mortality and would be cost saving 26 . Globally, only 37% of children received three doses of PCV in 2015, although coverage is actually higher in low-income than highincome countries due to support from agencies such as Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance 27 . Effective, safe and affordable interventions, such as antibiotics, oxygen and PCVs, will save lives during an influenza pandemic and are available now.
