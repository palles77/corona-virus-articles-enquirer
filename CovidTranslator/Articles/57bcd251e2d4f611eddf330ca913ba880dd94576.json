Morbidity and mortality of the acute viral CNS disease was augmented by the presence of the autoantibodies in all three viral infections. Transfer of serum containing the autoantibodies at the time of infection with MHV was sufficient to reproduce the exacerbated disease. The presence of the autoantibodies was found to result in increased infiltration of mononuclear cells into the brain. Early demyelination was severely augmented in brains and spinal cords of MHV-infected mice with CNS-specific autoantibodies. The antibodymediated exacerbation was shown to be independent of the complement system but to require expression of Fc receptors, because it was observed in C-3-deficient but not in Fc receptor-deficient mice. Our study illustrates the possibility that infections can lead to much more profound immunopathology in the presence of an otherwise latent autoimmune condition. (Am J Pathol 2007, ",

            "text": "It is now well established in animal models that infectious organisms can trigger or augment immune responses to self-antigens, by mechanisms such as molecular mimicry or bystander activation (see review 1 ). However, autoimmunity does not always result in clinically apparent disease, and cumulative infections by the same or unrelated agents may be required to unmask a pre-existing autoimmune process. 1 Conversely, a viral infection could take a worsened course in autoimmune-prone individuals. It has been shown that infections can provoke relapses or worsen autoimmune conditions in animal models. [2] [3] [4] This is consistent with reports showing that common infections augment the risk for or the severity of relapses in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. 5, 6 The aforementioned animal reports all studied T-cellmediated autoimmune responses, but autoantibodies also have an important pathogenic potential (see review 7 ). In the central nervous system (CNS), autoantibodies to myelin components and to myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) in particular can play a damaging role. MOG-specific antibodies have been shown to play a major role in the murine model of MS, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), 8 and have been clearly associated with demyelinating lesions in MS patients. 9 They are thus likely to mediate some of the pathology, at least in the subset of patients with lesions presenting antibody depositions. 10 However, the presence of antibodies specific for MOG or other CNS antigens is detected not only in MS patients but also in healthy subjects, albeit with a lower frequency, 11 and it is thus likely that additional triggers may be required for disease development.",

However, without additional autoantigenic immunization, the TH MOG mice do not develop spontaneous clinical disease, despite the presence of autoreactive B cells and the release of MOG-specific IgG and IgM in the serum. 12 Because the transgenic B cells in TH MOG can undergo normal differentiation and maturation, autoantibodies of different classes and subclasses, membrane-associated or secreted, are generated. Thus, all of the possible interactions of the autoreactive Igs with the other effectors of the immune system can occur in these mice. Therefore, they constituted a good model to evaluate the hypothesis that a viral infection of the CNS would lead to worsened immunopathology and disease, if it were to be superimposed on an underlying humoral autoimmune condition.",

Although no difference was observed in the clinically silent encephalitis induced by 10 5 plaque-forming units (PFU) of Pichinde virus, an exacerbation of the CNS disease by the autoantibodies was observed in mice infected with both TMEV and CV B3 (Table 1) . C57Bl/6 are genetically resistant to TMEV infection, ie, the virus replicates but does not cause detectable inflammation or demyelination, 23 and as expected, no behavioral signs of acute CNS disease were seen in the control mice. However, 44% of the TH MOG heterozygous animals developed a clinically evident disease, and onehalf of the sick animals died within the 1st week (Table 1) . Likewise, no signs of disease could be observed in any of the 2-week-old control pups infected with 10 3 or 10 4 PFU CV B3, whereas 20 or 100% of the heterozygous autoimmune mice became sick, respectively (Table 1 ). This was reflected by a profound difference in the weights of the two groups when injected with 10 4 PFU CV B3: all of the pups initially gained weight at an equal rate (111 \u03ee 3% in TH MOG \u03ee versus 108 \u03ee 4% in controls at 5 days after infection). The transgenic animals then started to grow at a slower rate and eventually lost weight, resulting in an average of 109 \u03ee 2% of their starting weight at day 10 after infection, versus 137 \u03ee 1% in the controls (P \u03fd 0.01, Mann-Whitney test). These experiments show that the adverse effects of pre-existing autoantibodies can have an impact on the outcome of a variety of viral encephalitis. They also show that exacerbation can occur over a large spectrum of clinical manifestations of encephalitis: Autoantibodies can transform a clinically silent infection into a symptomatic disease (TMEV and CV B3), transform a mild CNS pathology into a lethal one (MHV A59, 10 PFU), or accelerate the clinical course (MHV A59, 1000 PFU).

Thus, neither the disruption of the blood brain barrier, viral antigens in the CNS, nor infection of a peripheral organ elicited enhanced immunopathology in TH MOG mice, showing that active viral replication in the CNS was required. Viral titers in the brains of control C57Bl/6 mice and mice with autoantibodies (TH MOG homo-and heterozygous mice and C57Bl/6 recipients of anti-MOG serum) were then compared at different time points. No significant difference was found in the titers in mice with autoantibodies compared with the controls from day 3 (data not shown) up to days 5 and 6 ( Figure 3 ) after the infection, which indicates that the virus replicates initially at similar rates in all of the animals. However, although the titers started to decrease in both groups at day 7, the reduction of the viral load was less pronounced in mice with anti-MOG autoantibodies compared with controls ( Figure 3) . Thus, the ability to control the viral CNS infection is slightly impaired in the presence of the CNS autoantibodies.",

Morphologically, the infiltrates appeared to be composed of mixed inflammatory cell populations, with numerous neutrophils being seen both in the controls and in the mice with autoantibodies (Figure 4 , F-G). To determine more precisely the nature of the infiltrating cells, we performed flow cytometry experiments on mononuclear cells purified from infected brains. Enumeration of the purified cells from individual brains confirmed the increased cellularity in the brains of mice with autoantibodies ( Figure 4H ). The presence of the autoantibodies resulted in no significant differences in the numbers of T or B lymphocytes ( Figure 4I ). On the contrary, the frequency of NK cells and blood-borne macrophages was somewhat more elevated in mice with autoantibodies ( Figure 4I ).

As shown on Figure 6 , the clinical status of both groups was found to be similar, whereas MHV A59-infected wild-type C57Bl/6 mice showed the expected exacerbation when transferred with the serum from the same pool. The experiment in the Fc receptor-deficient mice was repeated with two more mice per group, and as the absence of exacerbation was confirmed on day 7 after infection (clinical scores of 1.0 and 2.0 versus 1.0 and 1.0 for the controls and the mice transferred with autoimmune serum, respectively), the animals were sacrificed to obtain histological data. Sections from brains and spinal cords showed no difference in the level of infiltration or demyelination between the controls and the recipients of the anti-MOG serum (data not shown). These experiments clearly demonstrate that cells bearing Fc receptors are involved in the augmented morbidity and mortality observed in MHV-infected mice in the presence of the anti-MOG antibodies.",

This finding is not limited to this single virus, because we found that both TMEV and CV B3, used in conditions in which the control animals develop no disease at all, also trigger pathology in mice with autoantibodies. Because the three viruses have low or no genetic relation, this indicates that the mechanism responsible for the augmented disease is very unlikely to involve cross-reactivity between the selfantigen and the pathogen. More likely, the inflammatory milieu generated by the infections allows the entry of the autoantibody in the otherwise secluded CNS compartment and attracts other immune mediators that can contribute to the immunopathology.",

The augmented disease is transferred by serum containing the autoantibodies and is Fc receptormediated. In further support of this hypothesis, viral replication was similar in controls and mice with autoantibodies during the first 6 days of the infection and was only significantly higher in the autoimmune mice on day 7 after infection. ELISPOT and intracellular cytokine data indicated, however, that the viral-specific cytotoxic response was not significantly impaired in those mice, neither at the systemic nor at the local level. Complement deposition has been found in lesions in MS patients, 10 and the demyelination potential of myelinspecific antibodies has been shown to correlate with complement-binding ability. 26 The experiments performed in C\u0408-3 KO mice indicate that in our model, complement has little or no involvement in the autoantibodymediated pathology. Another possible source of CNS damage can be NO, 27 which has been shown to be involved in MS lesions. 28 However, NO plays little role in MHV-induced demyelination, even though it can damage neurons during the infection, 29, 30 and iNOS-deficient mice have been reported to have a better survival rate than wild-type animals. 29 In accordance with this literature, we found control iNOS KO mice to survive the infection better than the C57Bl/6 animals. However, our experiments showed that iNOS was not involved in the antibody-mediated pathology, because all of the KO mice that were transfused with autoimmune serum succumbed to the infection. On the contrary, we found that a deficiency in cellular Fc receptors Fc\u2425RI and Fc\u2425RIII was sufficient to abrogate completely the autoantibody-mediated pathology at both clinical and histological levels. This indicates that neutrophils, macrophages, or NK cells are responsible for the autoantibody-mediated pathology. Based on these results and on the characteristics of the mononuclear infiltration in the autoimmune mice, we propose that cells of the monocyte/macrophage/microglia lineage, neutrophils, or NK cells are responsible for the autoantibody generated damage, through a mechanism that does not involve complement or iNOS release.",

The \u2425-herpesvirus \u2425HV-68 has been shown to provoke relapses of experimental autoimmune arthritis in mice. 31 Lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus and MHV each resulted in dramatic exacerbation of the pathology and mortality in a mouse model of antibody-triggered autoimmune hemolytic anemia. 32 Likewise, both lactate dehydrogenaseelevating virus and MHV infections also provoke a severe thrombocytopenia in mice treated with anti-platelet antibodies at otherwise nonpathogenic doses. 33 To our knowledge, the present report constitutes the first description of a similar phenomenon in the CNS compartment in an animal model. Our findings are consistent with previous studies performed with human patients, which suggest a correlation between the presence of autoantibodies in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and the outcome of encephalitis. Desai et al 34 reported that fatal outcome in a cohort of 72 patients with Japanese encephalitis virus infection was significantly associated to the presence of CSF autoantibodies, against neurofilament proteins in particular. Likewise, Matsui et al 35 found that in a group of 14 patients with viral encephalitis of undefined etiology, three of the four patients with CNS autoantibodies were among the total of five individuals with an unfavorable outcome. Both of these studies were performed with patients enrolled at the time that pathology was declared, making it impossible to determine whether the autoantibodies existed before the CNS infection or if they appeared as a consequence of the encephalitis. Likewise, there was no way to determine whether the autoantibodies had a direct role in the unfavorable outcomes or were merely an associated marker. However, in view of the results obtained in the present study, it is very possible that the autoimmune status of those patients had an adverse effect on the evolution of their CNS disease.",

The model of an autoimmune \"fertile field\" proposes that autoreactive T cells are first generated by some infections through molecular mimicry or bystander mechanisms but may remain nonpathogenic for extended periods and that unrelated viruses or bacteria may be responsible for triggering the actual autoimmune pathology. 1, 4 In this model, Koch's postulates (one disease/one pathogen) are not strictly respected, which may explain why it has been so difficult to associate a single organism to a given autoimmune disease.",
