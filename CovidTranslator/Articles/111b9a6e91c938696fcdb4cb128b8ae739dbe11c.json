            "text": "Background: As of March 2, 2020, SARS-CoV-2 has infected more than 80174 people and caused 2915 deaths in China. This virus rapidly spreads to 56 countries worldwide. Thus, in order to effectively block its transmission, it is urgent to uncover all the possible transmission routes of SARS-CoV-2. Methods: From January 28 to February 18, 2020, 35 female patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in Tongji Hospital were included in this descriptive study. The gynecologic history, clinical characteristics, laboratory findings and chest computed tomography (CT) of all patients were recorded in detail. To examine whether there is sexual transmission through vaginal from female to her partner, we employed realtime polymerase chain reaction testing (RT-PCR) to detect SARS-CoV-2 in vaginal environment (including vaginal discharge, cervical or vaginal residual exfoliated cells) and anal swab samples, and inquired recent sexual behaviors from the patients. Findings: The age range of the 35 patients with COVID-19 was 37-88 years. Over 50% patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 had chronic diseases. We tested the vaginal environment and anal swabs from the 35 female patients with COVID-19 and found that only an anal swab sample from one patient was positive for SARS-CoV-2. All the samples from vaginal environment were negative for SARS-CoV-2. The infection rate of the patients' sexual partner was 42\u00b79%. Additionally, two female patients admitted having sex with their partners during a possible infection incubation period, while one patient's partner was uninfected and the other patient's partner was diagnosed with COVID-19 (after the diagnosis of the female patient). Conclusion: No positive RT-PCR result was found in the vaginal environment perhaps due to the lack of ACE2 expression, which is the receptor of SARS-CoV-2, in the vagina and cervix tissues (human protein atlas). The results from this study show no evidence of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through vaginal sex from female to her partner. However, the risk of infection of non vaginal sex and other intimate contacts during vaginal sex should not be ignored.",

            "text": ". In addition, SARS-CoV was detected in urine, feces and tears of some SARS-CoV infected patients. It was confirmed that SARS-CoV could be transmitted through fecal-oral and contiguous pathways 6, 8 . Thus far, there has not been a report to show if SARS-CoV can be transmitted through sexual transmission. Therefore, based on the transmission route of SARS-CoV, current preventive measures, including maintaining good personal and environmental health, and implementing strict contact and droplet prevention measures in the community, can effectively prevent the spread of SARS-CoV 6 . However, different from SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, another virus of the same coronavirus family, which was first reported in Saudi Arabia in 2012 and later spread to several other countries 9,10 , was transmitted through large droplets and close contact, although the possibility of air transmission or dust mite transmission was not ruled out 9 . Also, it is not clear whether MERS-CoV is sexually transmitted. The World Health Organization (WHO) has provided recommendations for the prevention of MERS-CoV, mainly including droplet and contact precautions 11 . Interestingly, HCoV-229E in the coronavirus family was detected in the maternal vagina and also found in the gastric swab samples of newborns 12 . This makes the sexual transmission of this type of virus possible although there is no direct evidence to prove it. Therefore, it also remains possible that SARS-CoV-2, as a new type of coronavirus, could be sexually transmitted.",

First, the sample size was relatively small in which only 35 patients with SARS-CoV-2 positive or CT suspected was included; much more patients including sexually active women are needed to confirm our findings in the future. Second, samples from partner of the patients enrolled is missing, including anal swabs, semen, and urethral orifice swabs. Nevertheless, the data in our study revealed the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of female patients with COVID-19 in a new prospective. In summary, though no evidence was found in this study that SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted by vaginal sex from female to the partner.",

Among the infected proportion, 48.6% are females 4 . Internationally, cases of COVID-19 have been reported in 56 countries, especially in Japan, South Korea and Singapore, with rapidly increasing trend. SARS-CoV-2 is so widely spread, leading to injury of multiple organs and deaths. Therefore, it is crucially important to identify the transmission routes of SARS-CoV-2 in order to prevent its further spreading. Previously in 2003, there was an outbreak of SARS-CoV in China 5 . The main transmission route of SARS-CoV was via respiratory droplets, although the potential of transmission by opportunistic airborne routes and environmental factors was also reported",

Throat swab and anal swab samples were collected respectively from the upper respiratory tract and perianal tissues following the protocol of the virus sampling kit mentioned above. Diagnosis of COVID-19 was based on SARS-CoV-2 test of throat swab. Vaginal discharge, exfoliated cell and anal swab samples were collected about one week since diagnosed. All samples were tested for SARS-CoV-2 with the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommended Kit (DAAN GENE, Guangzhou, China or BioPerfectus Technologies, Jiangsu, China), following WHO guidelines for real-time RT-PCR.

We collected 105 samples from 35 patients to detect the SARS-CoV-2, including vaginal discharge, cervical or vaginal residue exfoliated cells and anal swap, It is worth noting that only an anal swab sample from one patient was positive for SARS-CoV-2, which is in consistence with the possibility of fecal-oral transmission reported previously 23 . The unexpected results from the vaginal environment may due to the negative expression of ACE2, the receptor of SARS-Cov-2, in the vagina and cervix 28 . Additionally, for two female patients admitted having sexual behaviors in the possible incubation period with their partners, one patient's partner was diagnosed with COVID-19. We cannot conclude that the infected partner is transmitted by her through sex behavior, as the samples of her vaginal environment anal swab samples were all SARS-CoV-2 free. But we should consider sex behavior as a cluster of intimate contacts involving hugs, kisses, and oral/anal sex, et al. She might transfer the virus to him by these intimate contacts, or the other way around. It is worth noting the infection rate for the 35 female patents' sexual partner was up to 42\u00b79%, which is not a low proportion.

Based on the transmission route of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, preventive measures, including maintaining good personal and environmental health, and implementing strict contact and droplet prevention measures in the community, can effectively prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. In this study, no evidence indicated that SARS-CoV-2 could transmit by vaginal sex from female to her partner. But the risk of infection by oral/anal sex or other intimate contacts during sex should not be ignored. We suggest that people in the affected areas should be very cautious about sex behavior, avoid oral/anal sex especially. It might be helpful to reduce the global spreading of SARS-CoV-2.",

In this study, we recruited 35 female COVID-19 patients from January 28 to February 18, 2020 in three branches of Tongji Hospital, Sino-French New City Branch (16 cases), Optical Valley Branch (16 cases) and Hankou main campus (3 cases) respectively, which are located in different geographical areas of Wuhan.
