            "text": "Understanding the immunopathogenesis of neuroimmunological diseases of the CNS requires a robust method for isolating and characterizing the immune effector cells that infiltrate the spinal cord in animal models. We have developed a simple and rapid isolation method that produces high yields of spinal cord infiltrating leukocytes from a single demyelinated spinal cord and which maintains high surface expression of key immunophenotyping antigens. Using this method and the Theiler's virus model of chronic demyelination, we report the presence of spinal cord infiltrating acute effector CD8 + lymphocytes that are CD45 hi CD44 lo CD62L \u2212 and a population of spinal cord infiltrating target effector memory CD8 + lymphocytes that are CD45 hi CD44 hi CD62L \u2212 . These cells respond robustly to ex vivo stimulation by producing interferon \u03b3 but do not exhibit specificity for Theiler's virus in a cytotoxicity assay. We conclude that target-derived lymphocytes in a mouse model of chronic spinal cord demyelination may have unique functional specificities.",

            "text": "Understanding the cells and molecules that mediate immunopathology in the central nervous system (CNS) is key to the rational discovery and design of therapeutic interventions for such diseases as multiple sclerosis (MS) (Ransohoff et al., 2003) . An important component of this discovery process is a reproducible and sensitive method for isolating immune cells from the CNS in a manner that preserves phenotype and functionality. Using the Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) model of MS (Rodriguez, 2007) , we have developed a rapid and simple method to isolate an enriched population of leukocytes from the demyelinated spinal cord, a tissue that is complicated by the high proportion of lipid-rich myelin. In contrast to previously published methods (Huang et al., 2001; Johnson et al., 1999; Klein et al., 2005; Lane et al., 2000) , our preparation produces infiltrating cells exclusively from the spinal cord of a single animal, rather than pooled brain and spinal cord cells or cells pooled from multiple animals. In addition, our method isolates infiltrating cells from the chronically demyelinated spinal cord, rather than the acutely infected CNS (Huang et al., 2001; Klein et al., 2005) . The spinal cord infiltrating leukocytes (SCILs) isolated by our non-enzymatic procedure are competent for ex vivo manipulation and for analysis of phenotypic markers by flow cytometry and qRT-PCR.",

The spinal column was excised into RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen, www.invitrogen.com) and the spinal cord was removed by insufflation using 20 mL 4\u00b0C RPMI expressed through a 19 gauge needle. The spinal cord was transferred to 10 mL fresh, cold RPMI and homogenized with 5 strokes in a Tenbroeck tissue grinder (Wheaton 2 mL, 0.09-0.16 mm gap). The resulting cell suspension was gravity sieved through a 40 \u03bcm strainer (BD Bioscience #352340; www.bdbiosciences.com) to remove large aggregates. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 900 g for 5 min at 4\u00b0C (1800 rpm; Beckman GH-3.8 rotor) and the supernatant was discarded. The cells were resuspended in 1 mL 70% Percoll (Amersham #17-0891-02; www.gelifesciences.com) prepared in PBS, transferred to a 5 mL polystyrene round bottom tube (BD Falcon), and overlaid with 1 mL 35% Percoll prepared in PBS. This discontinuous gradient was centrifuged at 800 g for 20 min at 4\u00b0C (1500 rpm; Beckman GH-3.8 rotor) with braking disengaged to prevent disruption of the gradient interface layer. Myelin and other debris form an opaque layer at the top of the gradient while the cells of interest form a fuzzy layer at the interface between 35% and 70% Percoll ( Figure  1 ). Following aspiration of the upper debris layer the central interface layer was collected (1 mL volume) and diluted with 3 mL fresh, cold RPMI. The cell suspension was pelleted by centrifugation at 1160 g for 5 min at 4\u00b0C (2200 rpm; Beckman GH-3.8 rotor) and the supernatant was discarded.

We sought to remove this processing step in order to speed up the preparation and to protect cell integrity and surface expression of key immunofunctional antigens. In a sideby-side comparison, the non-enzymatic method reduced the preparation time by almost 90 minutes. In addition, while both the enzymatic (+ENZ) and non-enzymatic (\u2212ENZ) preparations yielded similar forward scatter and side scatter flow profiles (Figure 2A and 2D) and similar CD45, CD4, and CD8 staining patterns ( Figure 2B , 2C, 2E, 2F), the overall cell-type specific yields and the overall surface intensity of relevant immune antigens were higher in our non-enzymatic preparation ( Figure 2G-2O) . Specifically, the yield of CD45 hi cells was 133 \u00b1 7% higher in our preparation than in the enzymatic prep (t(4)=5.383, P=0.006), the yield of CD4 + cells was 152 \u00b1 4% higher (t(4)=9.038, P<0.001), and the yield of CD8 + cells was 126 \u00b1 8% higher (t(4)=5.190, P=0.007) via our method. The mean fluorescence intensities (MFIs) were also significantly higher for CD45 (t(4)=6.410, P=0.003), CD4 (t(4)=7.302, P=0.002), and CD8 (t(4)=4.383, P=0.012) in our preparation.",

However, we were unable to detect antiviral cytolytic activity in SCILs collected at 100 dpi when incubated with TMEV-infected H-2 q fibroblasts ( Figure 4G ), despite the fact that these same effector cells were competent to kill anti-CD3-bearing 145-2C11 hybridoma targets ( Figure 4H ). As previously reported (Lin et al., 1998; Lin et al., 1997) , brain-infiltrating lymphocytes (BILs) collected from H-2 q mice (B10Q) at 7 dpi also failed to kill TMEV-infected fibroblasts ( Figure 4G ) but could kill 145-2C11 targets ( Figure 4H ). In contrast, BILs isolated at 7 dpi from TMEV-infected H-2 b mice (B6) readily killed both TMEV-infected H-2 b fibroblasts ( Figure 4G ) and 145-2C11 targets ( Figure 4H ). We conclude that CD8 + effector T cells present in the spinal cord of chronically infected B10Q mice are not antiviral, suggesting that other antigens are driving the continued activation phenotype that we observe.",

For this analysis we developed an objective, quantitative two-step RT-PCR strategy that employs the Taqman probe technology available from Roche (Universal Probe Library). The analysis is quantitated by reference to a titrated standard curve of plasmid containing the gene of interest. The measurements are objective because we employ a curve fitting algorithm that applies a 3-parameter sigmoid curve to the raw cycle vs. fluorescence measurements and computes a crossing point value that does not depend upon subjective manipulation of a noise band. This crossing point reflects the inflection point on the curve at which amplification ceases exponential growth. Standard curves for IFN\u03b3 ( Figure 5A ) and GAPDH ( Figure 5B ) were used to compute the efficiency of the PCR (Figure 5C and 5D) . These efficiency values were then applied in the standard Pfaffl equation (Pfaffl, 2001) to determine the difference in IFN\u03b3 ( Figure 5E ) or GAPDH ( Figure 5F ) mRNA expression between SCILs and PBMCs. We found that SCILs collected from demyelinated mice at 90 dpi had 10.4 \u00b1 1.9 fold more IFN\u03b3 mRNA expression (mean \u00b1 95% CI) than PBMCs collected from the same animals ( Figure 5G ). This difference was significant at P<0.001 (by t-test, t(4)=15.570). In contrast, the amount of GAPDH mRNA measured did not differ between SCILs and PBMCs (1.0 \u00b1 0.3 fold difference; P=0.1, t(4)=2.138). This finding suggests that the SCILs are skewed toward a T H 1/T C 1 response relative to PBMCs from the same animals (Mosmann et al., 1997; Woodland and Dutton, 2003) .",

By including brefeldin A to stop trafficking from the Golgi we were able to analyze the amount of IFN\u03b3 protein produced in the cells ex vivo by flow cytometry (Figure 6 ). In concordance with the RT-PCR analysis, we found that CD8 + ( Figure 6B, 6F, 6J, 6N ) and CD4 + ( Figure 6D , 6H, 6L, 6P) SCILs were far more competent than PBMCs to produce IFN\u03b3 after 4 ( Figure 6F and 6H) and 24 hours of stimulation ( Figure 6H and 6L) . A small number of CD8 + and CD4 + cells in the PBMC preparation showed an increase in intracellular IFN\u03b3 following 24 hours of stimulation ( Figure 3I and 3M). About half of the CD4 + SCILs showed an increase in intracellular IFN\u03b3 by 4 and 24 hours ( Figure 6H and 6L). In contrast, the majority of CD8 + SCILs upregulated the expression of IFN\u03b3 protein by 24 hours ( Figure 3J ). This further supports the idea that CD8 + cells in the SCILs are primed to release the potent T C 1 cytokine IFN\u03b3 (Mosmann et al., 1997; Woodland and Dutton, 2003) .",

While PBMCs from our chronically infected mice failed to show a response to PMA and ionomycin stimulation, CD8 + SCILs from the same animals responded robustly to such stimulation. Such a difference has been previously described in brain-derived lymphocytes during acute West Nile virus encephalitis (McCandless et al., 2008) . However, our findings indicate that the CD8 + T cells within the SCILs collected from the chronically demyelinated spinal cord are not anti-viral. This is in agreement with the IFN\u03b3-dependent, CD8 + T cell-mediated, viral epitope-independent model of demyelination suggested by Perlman's group (Dandekar et al., 2004) . It also suggests that the CD8 + T cells isolated by our method from the chronically demyelinated spinal cord may have specific effector functions or recognize specific targets, such as demyelinated axons (Howe, 2008; Howe et al., 2007a; Howe et al., 2007b) , that are not represented in the population of peripheral CD8 + T cells. This is consistent with the presence of a large population of acutely activated CD8 + T cells in the SCILs. Finally, our isolation protocol provides a clean, functionally intact population of immune effectors that can be studied in a variety of ex vivo stimulation paradigms. Our SCILs preparation is also amenable to adoptive transfer of total SCILs or column-purified lymphocytes into a variety of animal models of MS.",

Flow cytometric analysis of spinal cord homogenate collected from a 90 dpi mouse separated on a discontinuous 35%:70% Percoll gradient. The left panel shows a schematic representation of three fractions collected from the gradient after centrifugation. Fractions A and C exhibited forward and side scatter profiles that were considerably different than the profile of fraction B. Using gate region R1, we found that fraction B had a large number of CD45 + immune cells that were not observed in fractions A or C. For all analyses, we defined spinal cord infiltrating leukocytes (SCILs) as the population of cells contained in fraction B. For flow cytometric analysis we further defined SCILs as the population present within gate R2 on the CD45 vs. forward scatter dot plot (i.e. R1 gated cells that were also CD45 + ). The SCILs preparation contains a large number of acute effector CD8 + T cells that are not antiviral. CD45 hi CD4 + (A-C) or CD45 hi CD8 + (D-F) SCILs were further analyzed for the expression levels of CD44 and CD62L to ascertain memory versus effector phenotype. Only the CD45 hi CD8 + cells contained a population of CD44 lo CD62L \u2212 acute effector T cells (E).",

SCILs express more IFN\u03b3 RNA than PBMCs collected from the same animal. Standard curves for copy number determination were prepared from plasmids encoding either IFN\u03b3 (A) or GAPDH (B). The raw fluorescence vs. cycle number data were fit to a 3-parameter sigmoid curve to derive the crossing point for each standard. The raw crossing point vs. log copy number data were fit to a line to derive the slope and the reaction efficiency for IFN\u03b3 (C) and GAPDH (D). RNA from 10 5 SCILs or 10 5 PBMCs was analyzed by two-step RT-PCR. Fluorescence vs. cycle number data were generated for IFN\u03b3 (E) or GAPDH (F) and used to derive the crossing point for each experimental sample. The crossing points and the reaction efficiencies were used in the Pfaffl equation to determine the fold difference in expression of IFN\u03b3 and GAPDH between SCILs and PBMCs (G). While there was no significant difference in GAPDH expression between the two populations, SCILs expressed 10-fold more IFN\u03b3 RNA (G). The results shown are representative of at least 3 separate experiments. SCILs produce more IFN\u03b3 protein than PBMCs in response to ex vivo PMA:ionomycin stimulation. Under unstimulated conditions, CD8 + PBMCs (A), CD8 + SCILs (B), CD4 + PBMCs (C), and CD4 + SCILs (D) did not produce detectable levels of intracellular IFN\u03b3 after 24 hr in culture, as determined by flow cytometry. Stimulation for 4 hr with PMA and ionomycin led to a robust increase in intracellular IFN\u03b3 levels within about half of CD8 + and CD4 + SCILs (F, H) but not in CD8 + or CD4 + PBMCs (E, G). By 24 hr of stimulation, the majority of CD8 + SCILs (J) and many CD4 + SCILs (L) expressed high levels of IFN\u03b3, while only a small fraction of PBMCs showed IFN\u03b3 expression (I, K). The relative levels of IFN\u03b3 expression through time of stimulation are shown for CD8 + PBMCs (M), CD8 + SCILs (N), CD4 + PBMCs (O), and CD4 + SCILs (P). The results shown are representative of at least 3 separate experiments.",

Application of gate 'R1' to the forward scatter vs. side scatter plots of the three fractions identified a unique population of cells in the middle layer ('B') of the gradient. Further phenotypic analysis of CD45 expression on the cells in 'R1' revealed that this region contained a large population of CD45 + immune cells. For all subsequent analyses by flow cytometry, we only considered cells within region 'R2' (i.e. CD45 + cells from region 'R1') of gradient layer 'B' as spinal cord infiltrating leukocytes (SCILs). For analysis of gene expression only cells from layer 'B' were studied.",
