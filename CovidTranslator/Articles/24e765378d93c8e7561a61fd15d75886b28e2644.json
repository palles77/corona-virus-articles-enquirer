In Australia, the UK and the USA, it is within the top 10 causes of long-term physical disability (Fisher 2013; Mathers 2006; Ovbiagele 2011) . The most common and widely recognised impairment caused by stroke is motor impairment, which can be regarded as loss or limitation of function in muscle control or movement or limitation in mobility (Wade 1992a). Motor impairment after stroke typically affects the control of movement of the face, arm and leg on one side of the body (Warlow 2008) and is seen in about 80% of patients. Almost two-thirds of stroke survivors have initial mobility deficits (Jorgensen 1995; Shaughnessy 2005) , and six months after a stroke, more than 30% of survivors still cannot walk independently (Jorgensen 1995; Mayo 2002; Patel 2000) . Therefore, much of the focus of stroke rehabilitation, in particular, the work of physiotherapists (also known as physical therapists or rehabilitation therapists), is focused on recovery of physical independence and functional ability during activities of daily living; commonly the ultimate goal of therapy is to improve the function of walking and recovery of balance and movement (Langhorne 2009).",

            "text": "Various approaches to physical rehabilitation can be used after stroke, and considerable controversy and debate about the relative effectiveness of these approaches are ongoing (Carlisle 2010; Kollen 2009 ). Descriptions of these approaches are best considered within a historical context. Before the 1940s, physical rehabilitation approaches primarily consisted of corrective exercises based on orthopaedic principles related to contraction and relaxation of muscles, with emphasis placed on regaining function by compensating with the unaffected limbs (Ashburn 1995; Partridge 1996) . In the 1950s and 1960s, techniques based on available neurophysiological knowledge were developed to enhance recovery of the paretic side. These new approaches included the methods of Bobath (Bobath 1990; Davies 1985) , Brunnstr\u00f6m (Brunnstr\u00f6m 1970) and Rood (Goff 1969) , as well as the proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation approach (Knott 1968; Voss 1985) . In the 1980s, the potential importance of neuropsychology and motor learning was highlighted (Anderson 1986; Turnbull 1982) and the motor learning, or relearning, approach was proposed (Carr 1982) . This suggested that active practice of context-specific motor tasks with appropriate feedback would promote learning and motor recovery (Carr 1980; Carr 1982; Carr 1987a; Carr 1987b; Carr 1989; Carr 1990; Carr 1998) . The practical application of these approaches appeared to result in substantial differences in patient treatment. Approaches based on neurophysiological principles seemingly involved the physiotherapist moving the patient through patterns of movement, with the therapist acting as problem solver and decision maker and the patient being a relatively passive recipient (Lennon 1996) . In direct contrast, motor learning approaches stressed the importance of active involvement by the patient (Carr 1982) , and orthopaedic approaches emphasised muscle strengthening techniques and compensation with the non-paretic side. Since the 1980s, the need to base neurological physiotherapy on scientific research in relevant areas such as medical science, neuroscience, exercise physiology and biomechanics, and to test the outcomes of physical interventions to develop evidence-based physiotherapy has been increasingly emphasised. However, anecdotal evidence and the results of questionnaire-based studies suggest that, traditionally, many physiotherapists continued to base their clinical practice around a 'named' treatment approach. From the 1990s, the Bobath approach, based on neurophysiological prin-ciples, came to be recognised as the most widely used method in Sweden (Nilsson 1992) , Australia (Carr 1994a) and the UK (Davidson 2000; Lennon 2001; Sackley 1996) . As a consequence, since this time, physiotherapists have often sought evidence related to these 'named' approaches to the physical rehabilitation of stroke patients. In some parts of the world, clear preferences for one 'named' approach have prevailed; however in others, physical rehabilitation approaches for stroke have developed with greater eclecticism, resulting in geographical preferences for mixing particular approaches, or components from different approaches, as well as preferences for single 'named' approaches. For example, in China, where stroke rehabilitation is not yet considered standard care (Zhang 2013), standard 'approaches' to rehabilitation have been proposed, including 'standardised tertiary rehabilitation' (Hu 2007 isch; Hu 2007a; Jiang 2006; Research Group 2007; Zhang 2004) and 'standardised three-phase rehabilitation' (Bai 2008; Fan 2006; Zhu 2004b) . These approaches arguably appear to draw on the full range of treatment interventions available from all orthopaedic, neurophysiological and motor learning approaches described in Western literature, while incorporating traditional Chinese therapies such as acupuncture (Zhang 2013; Zhuang 2012) . More recently, calls asking physiotherapists to cease using named approaches and to stop selecting treatments based on historical perspectives have increased. Physiotherapists have been urged to refrain from using compartmentalised, named approaches and to select clearly defined and described techniques and task-specific treatments, regardless of their historical or philosophical origin (Kollen 2009; Langhammer 2012; Mayston 2000; Pomeroy 2005) . Although a move away from named approaches in preference of more evidence-based approaches has been deliberately implemented in some countries, such as the Netherlands (Kollen 2009; van Peppen 2004) , heated debate continues about the evidence for doing this (Carlisle 2010), and some physiotherapists around the world continue to exhibit preferences for particular named approaches (Khan 2012; Tyson 2009a; Tyson 2009b) .",

We stated: \"The information currently available from the majority of the Chinese trials awaiting assessment suggests that it is unlikely that the interventions studied in these trials will fit into the western categorisations and classifications of physiotherapy treatment approaches developed for this review. Prior to the next update of this review, the authors intend to seek advice and write additional inclusion and exclusion criteria to deal with the non-western approaches to physiotherapy for stroke\".",

Pollock 2007 stated:\"difficulty was experienced in distinguishing between a mixed approach (not a mixture of two different approaches, such as Stern 1970 mixing orthopaedic and neurophysiological approaches, but an unclassified mix [where the interventions were not easily classified into a 'named' approach]) and a motor learning approach. The mixed, intensive and focused approach investigated by Richards 1993 and the problem-solving approach investigated by Green 2002 and Wade 1992 had stated philosophies very similar to those of motor learning approaches. However, the described techniques and the supporting references led the reviewers to classify these interventions as mixed. This highlights a key problem with the classification of the motor learning approach. Although a motor relearning programme has been described by Carr and Shepherd (Carr 1982; Carr 1987b) , these authors primarily advocate an approach based on related research in relevant areas such as medical science, neuroscience, exercise physiology and biomechanics. Such an approach is arguably one of research-based practice, rather than being based on one specific philosophy\". It was therefore essential to plan solutions and strategies to address these limitations before this update of the review was conducted.",

We determined the proportion agreeing with each statement. We audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim the consensus decision meetings. We coded and analysed qualitative data using NVivo software: 84% of group members disagreed with statement 1, and 100% agreed with statement 2. Two key themes and several subthemes emerged from the transcribed data. Key themes were that (1) current categories of rehabilitation approaches should be amended to enable inclusion of all international evidence and (2) current physiotherapy taxonomies have limitations and concerns that have been raised surrounding their relevance to clinical practice in the UK. Discussion amongst stakeholder group members led to the generation of, and agreement on, a proposal that the optimal way of classifying the 'approaches' for this review consisted of using systematic categorisation of the treatment components described in relation to interventions. This discussion followed a presentation of treatment components described in a sample of 10 Chinese trials that had been listed as 'awaiting assessment' in Pollock 2007 (Chen 2004 Chu 2003; Gong 2003; Huang 2003; Pan 2004; Pang 2003; Xie 2003; Xu 2003a; Zhang 1998; Zhu 2001) . On the suggestion of the stakeholder group, to further explore the range of treatment components and reach agreement on definitions of these components, we systematically extracted descriptions of physical rehabilitation approaches from the 20 trials included in Pollock 2007 (Dean 1997 Dean 2000; Duncan 1998; Duncan 2003; Gelber 1995; Green 2002; Hesse 1998; Howe 2005; Langhammer 2000; Lincoln 2003; McClellan 2004; Mudie 2002; Ozdemir 2001; Pollock 1998; Richards 1993; Salbach 2004; Stern 1970; Wade 1992; Wang 2005; Wellmon 1997) . The stakeholder group then explored the descriptions of treatment components from these 30 trials. The aim was to include a variety of types and descriptions of physical rehabilitation approaches to allow examination of whether a range of treatment components could be identified and consensus over descriptions and categorisations; this was designed as an exploration, rather than as a comprehensive aggregation. The stakeholder group debated the treatment components described within these trials of physical rehabilitation approaches, reached consensus on key components, agreed on descriptions of these components and determined categorisation for synthesis of evidence within this update of the Cochrane review. The stakeholder group identified and defined 27 treatment components based on the interventions described within the 30 explored trials. These were grouped into seven categories: functional task training, musculoskeletal intervention (active), musculoskele-tal intervention (passive), neurophysiological intervention, cardiopulmonary intervention, assistive device and modality. These categories were informed by the taxonomy described by DeJong 2004. One hundred per cent of the stakeholder group agreed with these treatment component descriptions and categories. The agreed upon categories, treatment components and definitions are listed in Table 2 .",

For this update, we planned to carry out comparisons of physical rehabilitation approaches that included treatment components within the categories of functional task training, musculoskeletal intervention (active), musculoskeletal intervention (passive), neurophysiological intervention, cardiopulmonary intervention, assistive device and modality (see Table 2 ). Categories were based on the treatment components described within each included study. We planned to compare active interventions with (1) no treatment, (2) usual care or control and (3) another active intervention.",

A total of 108 comparisons were performed, as five of the 99 studies contributed data on more than one comparison. Four studies contributed data on three comparisons: Cooke 2006, Mudie 2002 and Richards 1993 each compared two active treatments with usual care, and Baer 2007 compared two active treatments with no treatment. Of the 99 studies, one contributed data on two comparisons: Kwakkel 2002 compared an active intervention with both an attention control group and a no treatment group. Table 7 lists the geographical locations of the included studies. Of the 99 included studies, 97 recruited participants from one country or continent, and two studies recruited participants from two countries or continents (Brock 2005: Australia and Europe; Thaut 2007: North America and Europe). A total of 54 studies were carried out in China; 17 in Europe; 10 in North America and Canada; seven in Australia and New Zealand; eight in Asia, excluding China and one in South America. The mean study size was greater in studies carried out in China (mean 138, SD 189 participants) than in other parts of the world (Europe: mean 76, SD 60; North America and Canada: mean 74, SD 122; Australia and New Zealand: mean 48, SD 48; Asia, excluding China: mean 46, SD 30). The settings for recruitment of participants and for administration of the intervention are summarised in Table 7 .

The frequency was unclear in 29 of the 99 studies (Aksu 2001; Behrman 2011; Chen 2004; Chen 2010; Ge 2003; Gelber 1995; Green 2002; Howe 2005; Hu 2007 haem; Hu 2007 isch; Huang 2003; Jing 2006; Langhammer 2007; Li 2003; Lincoln 2003; Qian 2004; Qian 2005; Richards 1993; Tang 2009; Torres-Arreola 2009; Wade 1992; Wang 2006; Wu 2006; Xu 2003a; Xu 2003b; Yin 2003a; Zhang 1998; Zhang 2004; Zhao 2003) .

The many diverse outcome measures recorded in the included studies made it impossible for review authors to analyse all of the documented data. Based on the prestated groupings of relevant outcomes and the availability of data from specific measures in the included trials, the review authors for the previous version of the review made the decision to concentrate data analysis on independence in ADL,* motor function,* balance, muscle strength, gait velocity and length of rehabilitation stay. For this update, we decided to remove the muscle strength outcome, as this outcome was rarely reported in the included studies. *Independence in ADL was called 'global dependency' and motor function was called 'functional independence in mobility' in previous versions of this review. See Differences between protocol and review. Outcome measures were recorded at several different time points during and after the intervention period. For the analyses in the review, we classed 'immediate outcomes' as data that were recorded at the end of the treatment period or at the time point nearest to the end of the treatment period. If the intervention comprised a change in treatment throughout the whole of a participant's rehabilitation period, then data were recorded from the outcome measures noted at the time of discharge from rehabilitation or at the time point nearest to discharge. When studies also reported follow-up data, we included these as analysis of 'persisting outcome'. The time points at which data were recorded are clearly documented and stated for each trial in the Characteristics of included studies table and are summarised in Table 4 , Table 5 and Table 6 . Of the 99 studies, 79 included outcome measures suitable for inclusion in an analysis of immediate outcomes, and 27 provided a follow-up outcome measure. Details of these outcome measures are provided below.",

Richards 1993 and Yin 2003a included two active treatment groups so are entered twice into analyses, with the control group data 'shared' as the comparison group for the two active interventions. Standard deviations for Green 2002 , Mudge 2009 , Zhu 2007 isch and Zhu 2007 haem were estimated from the reported range, it was preplanned to explore the effect of including these studies. Data from Jing 2006 were not included in analyses of one approach versus another, as both of the two treatment groups were assessed as including similar treatment components.",

Poor reporting led to our assigning 'unclear' risk of bias in most cases, with 56 of 99, 59 of 99 and 39 of 99 studies having unclear risk of bias for sequence generation, allocation concealment and blinding of outcome assessor, respectively. We assessed a larger proportion (72 of 99) to have low risk of bias for being 'free of systematic differences in baseline characteristics of groups,' as this information could generally be determined from tables of characteristics of participants. When no systematic differences in baseline characteristics of groups were noted, there was no need for study authors to adjust for baseline characteristics; this was also therefore assessed to show low risk of bias for a similar number of studies.

In summary, moderate-quality evidence indicates that physical rehabilitation has a beneficial effect on independence in ADL and motor function after stroke, and that this effect persists beyond the end of the intervention period, when compared with no treatment. Evidence shows greater benefit associated with a shorter time since stroke. Evidence also suggests that a dose of 30 to 60 minutes per day delivered five to seven days per week is effective, and that more frequent or increased doses may provide even greater benefit. Substantial heterogeneity was observed between the studies included in these analyses, and most of the studies were at high or uncertain risk of bias. This evidence principally arises from China, where a particular healthcare system and cultures and beliefs are associated with health and disease. In China, physiotherapy or rehabilitation traditionally has not been routinely provided within acute hospital settings; therefore this evidence is highly relevant to stroke care settings in China. Arguably this evidence does not have any direct implications for settings in which no treatment would not be considered to be an ethical alternative for hospitalised patients with stroke, but the indirect implications of this evidence base may have universal relevance.

The original focus of the comparisons within this review (2007 and earlier versions) was the effectiveness of different named approaches to physiotherapy, based on a historical perspective. The original review was carried out in direct response to a consultation exercise conducted in Scotland that aimed to identify the 'burning questions' of Scottish stroke rehabilitation workers, and that identified 'different (named) treatment approaches' to be amongst the most important questions posed by physiotherapists (Legg 2000) . Following consultation with key stakeholders (physiotherapists, stroke survivors and carers), the focus for this update of the review was determined to be the individual treatment components that constitute physical rehabilitation approaches. This is an important, albeit arguably subtle, shift, enabling synthesis of evidence based on different philosophies and from different cultures, with systematic categorisation of individual treatment components, regardless of their philosophical or theoretical origin. This change in focus is in line with recommendations made within the 2007 version of this review. The studies within this review included 121 active interventions; most of these (99 interventions) included treatment components categorised as functional task training. Most of the interventions incorporated treatment components from at least two different categories of intervention, with only 33 interventions focusing on just one category of intervention (20 interventions focused on functional task training only; 13 focused on neurophysiological interventions only). The finding that most studies include a combination of different treatment components, generally arising from at least two of the different categories defined for this review, highlights this fact: Physiotherapists appear to be basing their interventions not on one single historical or philosophical approach, but rather on a pragmatic eclectic approach that utilises a range of different treatment components, often regardless of their historical or philosophical origins. This pragmatic approach, which adopts a mix of components from different approaches, was supported by the previous version of this review, which concluded that a mix of components from different approaches was significantly more effective than no treatment or placebo in recovery of functional independence following stroke, and provides justification for the decision to change the focus of the review for this update.",

Inconsistent and poorly defined terminology: Electronic searching was difficult because the names given to different physiotherapy rehabilitation approaches are poorly documented, often have several derivations and have varied over time. Furthermore, the interventions were not always described as 'physiotherapy' or 'physical therapy,' but sometimes were described as 'rehabilitation,' 'training' or 'exercise.' This was particularly true for studies emerging from China, which frequently described interventions as 'early rehabilitation.' Studies investigating circuit training or exercise classes sometimes met the inclusion criteria for this review; again, identification of these was made difficult by lack of use of the term 'physiotherapy' or 'physical therapy.' 2. Change in focus of the review: As described above, for this update of the review, a subtle change in focus was applied-from 'named' rehabilitation approaches to the individual treatment components that constitute physical rehabilitation approaches. No change to the search strategy or to selection criteria was implemented, and we do not believe that any changes would be justified. It could be argued that decisions made relating to the exclusion of studies from the search results for previous versions of this review may be different in light of the changed focus. However, selection of relevant trials for this review has always been challenging, and we do not believe that the change in focus of the review has affected study selection in one direction or another.",

Different cultures and healthcare systems: Decisions were made to include some studies in which the provider of the intervention was not clearly a physiotherapist or a physical therapist; these decisions were often related to the fact that physiotherapists may not be routinely found in all healthcare settings around the world. This provided additional challenges in relation to determining whether a study was investigating a 'physical rehabilitation' approach. In particular, many studies in China simply referred to a 'therapist,' but in some instances, the provider was a doctor or a nurse. We carried out subgroup analyses to explore the effect of the stated intervention provider on outcome. However, many studies did not explicitly state this, which limited conclusions that could be made from this subgroup analysis.",

Thus, in general the completeness of study information is low, resulting in a high number of studies for which risk of bias is classed as 'unclear' and a high number of studies that do not contribute data to the analyses. Relatively few studies followed up with participants after the intervention had ended: Data were available immediately at the end of intervention for 49 studies for the independence in ADL outcome and for 50 studies for the motor function outcome, but only for 16 and 12 studies, respectively, for a longer-term follow-up outcome. Follow-up data from studies comparing intervention with no treatment demonstrate that significant benefit of intervention is maintained, but the size of the benefit was observed to lessen. In the comparison of intervention versus usual care or control, lack of follow-up data limits the ability of review authors to draw any generalisable conclusions relating to whether observed benefits are maintained.",

The written information provided by study authors regarding interventions administered in the included trials is included in the Characteristics of included studies table. Although many of the included studies attempt to describe all administered interventions, the available documentation is often insufficient to allow confident and accurate repetition of the applied rehabilitation approach. Problems with documentation of interventions generally are not the fault of researchers or therapists, but rather are due to the fundamental problem of recording methods of physical handling skills and techniques, and the nature of the often intimate relationship between stroke survivor and physiotherapist. Documentation of this process would generally be complex and 'wordy'; therefore often it is not possible to present within research papers with limitations on length. These problems are confounded by the fact that treatments applied are often ultimately the decision of a single physiotherapist, based on an individual assessment of a unique stroke survivor's movement disorders. Furthermore, the common basis of physical rehabilitation 'approaches' is that they are holistic. All body parts and movements can be assessed and treated based on the selected approach; however, a physiotherapist may select to concentrate on the treatment of one particular body part or movement during a treatment session. Subsequently, treatments given to specific stroke survivors by individual therapists may vary enormously. This review attempted to limit this variation slightly by excluding trials that had provided interventions only to the upper limb. Nevertheless, although we grouped together studies that included treatment components within similar categories, it is conceivable that substantial differences exist between the physical interventions given to participants within the same treatment group.",

Two independent review authors categorised the described treatments using agreed definitions of individual treatment components. This process relied on adequate descriptions within published papers. Papers that published only very brief descriptions of interventions therefore may have resulted in categorisations that were not truly reflective of the intervention delivered. Furthermore, this process of categorisation was highly dependent on the language and terminology provided within a written de-scription. For example, an author may state \"activities aimed at improved gait.\" This description would result in categorisation only within the functional task training component of \"walking.\" However, in practice, this intervention could have included components such as active or active-assisted movement, sensorimotor facilitation and muscle strengthening. Therefore our method of categorisation is likely to have underestimated rather than overestimated the numbers of treatment components and intervention categories. Hence, if any inaccuracy exists, the interventions are likely to be more \"mixed\" and eclectic than has been captured by our method of categorisation. A number of difficulties were encountered in distinguishing between interventions that included only functional task training components and those that also included musculoskeletal (active) components. In particular, the review authors encountered difficulties in determining whether an intervention focused on a functional task might also include active or active-assisted movement. This reality was due to the fact that all functional task training necessitates active movement, and overlap between practice of an active-movement and practice of a functional task can be inevitable. This is an area that we recommend for further exploration in relation to the descriptions and definitions of treatment components proposed for this review. Discussion also focused on whether the categories of 'assistive devices' and 'modalities' would be better combined into one joint category. The separate categories were agreed and defined by the stakeholder group participants, which is why they have been used within this review. However, we recommend that merging of these categories be explored before future updates of this review are prepared.",

We therefore wrote definitions such that these studies could be captured by our system of categorisation of individual treatment components. However, including studies that have provided only the name of an approach without providing any descriptions potentially introduces a number of biases. These biases occur as a result of the fact that the content of named approaches potentially changes over time and in keeping with geographical or personal preferences and biases. In particular, several studies reported that the intervention was 'Bobath,' and much debate has surrounded the content of physiotherapy interventions based on the Bobath concept. This debate arises largely from the fact that the content of the Bobath approach has changed over time, published descriptions are limited, and the content of current therapy is variable (Carr 1994a; DeJong 2004; Langhammer 2012; Mayston 2008; Nilsson 1992; Pomeroy 2001b; Sackley 1996; Tyson 2009b; Turner 1995) .

These translations provided a number of challenges in relation to interpretation of meanings and subsequent classification of treatment components. For example, in several papers, it was unclear whether 'standing up training' referred to activities carried out in standing (i.e. training to promote standing balance) or to sit-to-stand training. In these cases, decisions were made based on discussion between two review authors (one of whom was a Chinese-speaking physiotherapist (PLC)).",

This finding may also reflect a true difference in the effects of interventions carried out in different geographical locations, which may be a result of differences in culture, traditions, training and implementation of interventions. However, this difference may also be related to the comparison interventions, especially if they consist of no treatment or usual care. All studies that compared intervention against no treatment in the acute phase of stroke were carried out in China; this is a reflection of the fact that 'usual care' can comprise no rehabilitation within these geographical settings. Consequently, the finding that intervention is more effective than no treatment in improving independence in ADL and in motor function may, arguably, be applicable only to settings in China. Evidence shows that usual care can vary considerably, both regionally and nationally as well as internationally. Hence, geographical location could be a confounding variable in the comparison of intervention against usual care.",

Less than 50% of the studies were judged to be at low risk of bias for selection, detection and attrition bias; however, for most of the studies, this information was unclear, and risk of bias was judged to be high in less than 10% of the studies. Sensitivity analyses were carried out to explore the effect of including studies with high or unclear risk of bias. These sensitivity analyses generally found that removal of studies with high or unclear risk of bias did not alter the direction (or significance) of the results. Thus, although the quality of most of the evidence included in this review remains uncertain, the fact that inclusion of these studies does not affect the direction of results gives us greater confidence in our findings. The main message arising from this review in relation to quality of the evidence is that it is essential that reporting of methodological features of RCTs of physiotherapy interventions is improved, and that studies are reported using the CONSORT guidelines for reporting (Schulz 2010) . Studies that used quasi-random assignment were excluded from this update of the review (previous versions had included quasirandomised trials). This led to exclusion of three studies that had been included in the 2007 version (Hesse 1998; Ozdemir 2001; Stern 1970) . However, we found information about the method of randomisation particularly difficult to judge in a number of studies included in this review, particularly studies published in Chinese, in which use of the term 'random' in English abstracts did not always reflect the descriptions provided in Chinese versions of the study. There is an urgent need for trialists to address the issue of adequate reporting of methods of randomisation. It is possible that we have inadvertently included in this review trials that used quasi-random assignment, rather than true random assignment. In most studies, it was unclear whether participants were blinded to the study group and aims. The nature of rehabilitation interventions and the ethical requirement to obtain informed consent often make it difficult, if not impossible, to blind participants. If the aims and objectives of the study were apparent to the participants, this could confound the study results. It is generally impossible to blind the treating therapist because treating therapists have to be familiar with the intervention they are administering. Therapists who strongly favoured one approach over another could introduce performance bias. In several studies, the same therapist administered treatment to participants in both study groups; this potentially introduced considerable contamination between groups. The 'beliefs' of stroke survivors and therapists may further contribute to biases within many of these studies, and the large number of different geographical locations in which studies were carried out means that the studies were carried out with participants living in a wide variety of cultures, which could potentially impact the response to physical rehabilitation. Many of the included trials did not state that they used a blinded assessor. Lack of blinding of assessors potentially introduces considerable bias into the study results. This is particularly important in studies in which thera-pists often have strong beliefs in support of a particular approach.",

Although we have carried out subgroup analyses to explore issues relating to the heterogeneity of both the interventions (i.e. dose, components) and the participants (time since stroke) and other issues (geographical location, provider of intervention), it is likely that a complex interrelationship exists between some of the subgroups that we have been unable to explore. For example, studies carried out in China tended to be those with the least time since stroke, meaning that effects found that have been attributed to geographical location could be due equally to time since stroke (and vice versa). We believe that this will be true for a number of other variables. We recommend that future updates of this review plan to explore issues associated with the interrelationship of these variables.",

Feedback from the stakeholder group members confirms that the group perceived that their input benefited the format of the review and made the review more clinically relevant.

We acknowledge that the appropriateness of terms such as 'functional,' 'neurophysiological' and 'musculoskeletal' can be debated when used in the way we have used them within this review.

This review author also possessed the necessary quality appraisal skills and had detailed expertise of physiotherapy and stroke rehabilitation. A second review author then considered the assessment of risk of bias by the first review author, based on the translations of relevant extracts provided by the first review author. Thus, although two review authors did consider the quality of these non-English language papers, the assessment of the second review author was based entirely on the translation provided by the first review author. This method means that if the first review author made any errors in translation, or missed information provided in the non-English text, the second review author will not have identified this. Thus, although having two review authors for these papers offers advantages, it does not provide the same level of 'independence' as the process of having two independent review authors for the English language papers. However, given the volume of non-English papers that we have included, and the available resources for this review, we believe that we have taken all steps available to us to minimise potential biases in this process.",

For each of the three main comparisons and associated subgroup analyses, group members discussed the clinical implications and key messages arising from the results.

In particular, the stakeholder group members highlighted the need to specifically draw out information pertaining to the dose of interventions delivered within the studies, as this was believed to have important implications for clinical practice. We believe that this process of consultation considerably removes potential biases from the process of reaching conclusions from this review, as the conclusions reflect the views of expert clinicians, stroke survivors and carers, rather than the potentially biased viewpoints of researchers and academics.",

Although the 2007 version concluded that evidence was insufficient to suggest that one approach was superior to another, this review can now conclude that moderate-quality evidence indicates that there is no difference between approaches.",

This review is in agreement with a review of evidence relating specifically to the Bobath approach (Kollen 2009), which concluded that there was \"no evidence for the superiority of Bobath therapy or any other approach on sensorimotor control of the upper and lower limb, dexterity, mobility, ADL, HRQOL, and costeffectiveness.\" Zhang 2013 recently completed a review that has similarities to our comparison of physiotherapy treatment versus no treatment. Zhang 2013 aimed specifically to review RCTs that compared rehabilitation versus standard care after stroke in China. This review pooled evidence from 31 trials (5220 participants) that reported independence in ADL (Barthel Index) and 27 trials (4501 participants) that reported motor function (Fugl-Meyer Assessment). In contrast, we identified and pooled the results of 27 studies (3423 participants) and 25 studies (4558 participants), respectively. (NB: Our figures also include non-Chinese studies.) We are unclear whether the differences in included trials reflected a more effective strategy for identification of Chinese studies by Zhang 2013; differences in selection criteria between reviews or a combination of these. Before future updates of our review, we plan to speak to the authors of Zhang 2013 to discuss differences in identification and selection of trials between the reviews. Despite differences in the numbers of trials included, the results and conclusions of our review were in agreement with those of Zhang 2013, which concluded that \"there is some evidence that rehabilitation post stroke is more effective than no rehabilitation, improving activities of daily living and reducing disability.\" Both Zhang 2013 and our review highlight the limitations relating to low reporting quality and study heterogeneity. A key difference between our review and Zhang 2013 is that Zhang 2013 did not attempt to explore the specific treatment components investigated by the studies.",

High-quality randomised trials and systematic reviews are needed to determine the effectiveness of clearly described individual techniques and task-specific treatments, regardless of their historical or philosophical origin. Many Cochrane reviews have already been published that include a large body of trials exploring the effectiveness of specific single treatments, and it is important that researchers are familiar with this evidence and plan future research according to relevant recommendations within these reviews. Researchers should identify whether there are any gaps in this evidence base so that these can be addressed. It is important that the current Cochrane reviews are kept up-to-date.

Research is needed to consider the full range of outcomes that may be associated with improved function and mobility. These outcomes include the clinical and cost benefits potentially associated with a reduction in falls or emergency hospital admissions, and the impact of community and social care teams and services. All benefits in relation to stroke survivor-perceived quality of life, psychological mood, social participation, return to work and carer strain and well-being should be considered. This review found that many RCTs did not assess long-term follow-up, and it is essential that future RCTs plan follow-up assessments as a key feature of their design. Adequate resources should be sought to ensure that follow-up assessments are possible. The observed reduction in effect size in the available follow-up data supports research that explores additional or longer-term physiotherapy or both. Furthermore, future research should consider the long-term benefits of physical rehabilitation interventions and should explore the effects of follow-up physiotherapy assessment, self-management and treatment in maintaining benefits and preventing deterioration. Self-referral systems that will enable stroke survivors to gain follow-up physiotherapy when they believe it is necessary should also be explored. Improvement in the reporting of RCTs of physical rehabilitation interventions is urgently needed, and we urge researchers to follow the CONSORT guidelines for reporting of clinical trials (Schulz 2010). A wide variety of outcome measures are used to assess the effects of physical rehabilitation, and we recommend research that leads to consensus and standardisation of some core outcome measures for use within future RCTs.

Only if exercise direction was correct, would a safe and effective rehabilitation goal be realised (b) Active ranging exercises (rehabilitation exercise during recovery period): patient independently chose the exercise position and exercise method, with emphasis on hand exercises, assisted by some equipment, we gave appropriate guidance and monitoring, with exercise speed, repetition number and interval being determined by patient's specific condition. Active ranging exercises had to obey: (i) Active ranging exercises performed on the foundation of passive ranging exercises, in order not to induce tiredness and pain; (ii) Among the exercises, more practice done for relaxation of tensed muscles; (iii) First simple movements, then complicated movements; (iv) During practice, same actions done for non-affected limbs, to aid in recovery of function of paralysed limbs. During the process of active ranging exercise, coordination practice must be emphasised, to gradually improve level of coordination through a long period of training. From individual joints, and uni-directional simple exercises to complex coordinated movements, movement complexity and precision [were] gradually increased; starting from exercises symmetrical to both sides of body; during gait training, initial requirement was for gait to be stable, accurate and natural, and afterwards practised walking forwards in a straight line and crossing obstacles etc. Repeated practice of a single movement, in order to develop the biological foundation of a habit, and form a new neural pathway\" The individual components delivered are listed in Table 3 .

Training was advanced over sessions by increasing the repetitions and cognitive difficulty of the tasks. The subjects in the control group performed an equal number of reaching movements as the subjects assigned to the experimental group; however, the nature of the tasks ensured that only a minimum balance perturbation occurred\" The individual components delivered are listed in Table 3 .

Designed to improve sitting by reaching beyond arm's length using the unaffected hand whilst focusing on: (1) smooth coordinated motion of the trunk and arm to get the hand to the object; (2) appropriate loading of the affected foot; and (3) preventing the use of maladaptive strategies such as widening the base of support. While reaching beyond arm's length, reach distance, direction, thigh support, seat height, and task were varied systematically.

Sham training was performed so that participants would consider themselves involved in a training program, which would eliminate any effect due to placebo. This training involved participants completing a series of 11 cognitivemanipulative tasks. Participants were seated at a table, well supported in a chair with back and armrests, with their forearms resting on the table. The workspace was confined so that reach distance was less than 50% of arm's length which minimised perturbations to balance. Training was progressed over the 2-week period by increasing the number of repetitions and cognitive difficulty of the cognitive-manipulative tasks. Therefore, this training was sham sitting training because the perturbations to balance were minimal and were unlikely to lead to improvements in sitting\" The individual components delivered are listed in Table 3 .

For acute stroke patients, up to one month after stroke, the first phase of treatment was undertaken, mainly carried out in the Department of Neurology ward, and while given Fan 2006 (Continued) conventional medical treatment, these patients were given early bedside rehabilitative treatment after becoming medically stable, focusing on physiotherapy, with rehabilitative treatment commencing within 1 week after patients were medically stable; for subacute stroke patients, the second (beyond 1 to 3 months after stroke) and third phase (beyond 3 to 6 months after stroke) of treatment [were] undertaken, and based on the patient's condition and level of functional recovery, patients were transferred to rehabilitation ward/centre for further rehabilitation, or discharged home, where a therapist would conduct home visits to guide the patient, and help the patient conduct necessary functional training, until the end of follow-up. Here, 'stage one rehabilitation' referred to the patient's early conventional medicine treatment at the hospital's emergency or Department of Neurology ward, as well as early stage rehabilitative treatment, 'stage two rehabilitation' referred to the patient's rehabilitative treatment at the rehabilitation ward/ centre, 'stage three rehabilitation' referred to the continuation of rehabilitative treatment at the community or home setting The rehabilitative treatment method combined physiotherapy and occupational therapy into a holistic method: early stage of treatment was focused on physiotherapy, progressing to occupational therapy. Physiotherapy treatment included: (1) supine and sitting positions to combat spasticity; (2) passive ranging exercise of all affected limb joints, including mobilisation of the shoulder girdle, starting from small to large ranges of motion, to avoid causing pain to the patient; (3) rolling practice (from affected and nonaffected sides); (4) bridging exercises; (5) exercises in ankle dorsiflexion and wrist extension; (6) outwith therapy time, sitting practice: headrest of bed lifted to 30 degrees, and, if participant could tolerate the angle for longer than 30 minutes, the angle was increased by another 10 degrees the following day, until participant could tolerate 90 degrees for longer than 30 minutes, which would then be followed by lying-to-sitting up training (from non-affected and affected sides); (7) sitting balance training (sitting on edge of bed) ; (8) sit-to-stand training; (9) standing balance training; (10) gait training, etc. During the flaccid phase, focus was on postural correction, passive activities and active/passive practice, rolling, lying-to-sitting on edge of bed. During the spasticity phase, focus was on relaxation practice for spastic muscles, antispasticity manual techniques and muscle training for non-spastic muscles, as well as practising exercises in isolated movements. Occupational therapy treatment was based largely on the participant's functional ability at each stage; the appropriate intervention would be given, namely, feeding, grooming, donning, bed-to-wheelchair and wheelchair-to-bed transfer and other ADLs, as well as practice of woodwork, sewing and other handicrafts and ring-insertion games, jigsaws and other leisure activities Stage one rehabilitation included antispasticity positioning, passive training of limbs, active training of non-affected limbs under guidance and deep breathing, as well as training of abdominal muscles, sitting up from lying, sitting balance and standing up training, etc, to train the participant's ability to get up from the bed (treatment was done), one/ d, 45 minutes/session, five/wk, during the training period, the participant's family or nursing workers were taught the correct supplementary exercises and methods of care concurrently, to achieve partial training out with therapy times, while reducing the damage to affected limbs due to inappropriate nursing care; stage two rehabilitation mainly consisted of standing training, standing balance, single-leg standing, gait training and up-and-down stair training etc, to train the participant's ability to ambulate (treatment was done) 2x/day, 30-45 minutes/session, 5x/week; stage three rehabilitation mainly consisted of feeding, donning, grooming, personal hygiene management and other ADL ability training (treatment was done) 2x/day, 30-45 minutes/session, five to seven days/ wk. Stage one early rehabilitation and stage two rehabilitation within rehabilitation ward/ centre were delivered by therapists, while concurrently teaching participant's family or nursing workers how to assist the participant in training; during stage three community rehabilitation, therapists conducted fortnightly home visits, and while delivering occupational therapy and necessary physiotherapy, also taught the participant's family or nursing workers how to help the participant train, leaving them to assist the participant in completing the remaining daily necessary training.\"",

(iv) Lying to sitting and sitting balance training: participants first shifted to edge of bed, dangled both legs off the bed with the unaffected leg supported the top affected leg, and pushed into sitting position with the unaffected Pan 2004 (Continued) arm. For sitting balance training, participants practised reaching for/placing objects from one side to another, increasing the amount of reach as much as possible. Participants were also trained to self-correct their sitting balance by subjecting them to perturbations in all directions. (v) Sit to stand and standing balance training: participants adopted the Bobath method of intertwining both arms, forward extension of arms, head and trunk, shifted body weight to the arms in order to lift the pelvis, hips, knee and stand up. If needed, therapist assisted by pushing the affected knee forward and putting one hand on the unaffected pelvis to help lift it. Participants stood in parallel bars, supporting with the unaffected arm and with assistance from the doctor or family, and gradually increased the time in standing until 30 mins could be attained. Participants progressed to sit to stand practice from using a high chair to a low chair for added challenge. (vi) Gait re-education and stair training (up and down). (vii) ADL practice: inculcated ADL tasks practice into therapy sessions, 3-4x/day, 30 min/session. Family of participants were instructed to assist in practice\"",

The therapist focused on re-educating normal movement during functional activities that were meaningful to the patients. Training was composed of balance exercise, posture control exercise, and gait exercise. Keeping normal movement of the pelvis for balance and posture control was emphasized. The therapist judged that working on increasing anterior and posterior pelvic tilt would improve weight transfer and hip extension during gait, leading to improvements in selective distal control of the knee and the foot. Trunk control and alignment can affect muscle tone, range of motion, and control of the limb. For the upper limbs, treatment was conducted focusing on movement of the scapular. For balance exercise, weight transfer exercise and reaching exercise were alternately performed on the affected side and the unaffected side in the sitting or standing position. Bridging exercise was performed to strengthen the trunk muscles. Selective movement of each joint of the shoulder, elbow, knee and ankle joint was performed to facilitate upper and lower limb movement. For gait exercise, training in weight transfer during gait was conducted by planting the unaffected side foot at the front and back of the body. Gait training was divided between the stance phase and the swing phase, and exercises for each phase were performed. In addition, stair climbing practice and gait training for crossing obstacles were conducted. Patients did not do the same exercise every training day but suitable exercises were selected according to the goals of each patient and the therapist. The intensity of each exercise was decided by the therapist considering each patient's capacity for exercise\" The individual components delivered are listed in Table 3 .

(i) Patient closed eyes and used touch to identify common objects such as key, pen, toothbrush, button, etc, and if unable to identify, could also allow touching with eyes opened or using non-affected hand to touch; (ii) Plastic pieces, paper, cloth and fur, etc, were mixed together, for patient to identify using touch with eyes closed, and if there is error in identification, could similarly use non-affected hand or open eyes; (iii) Patient showed a picture, and then asked to find a similar object in a black box\" \"Balance training: using balance assessment training system, based on patient's condition,",

In total, 10 hours of additional training were given. The additional exercises consisted of selective movements of the upper and lower part of the trunk in supine and sitting. Supine exercises, with the legs bent and the feet resting on the treatment table, included selective anteriorposterior movements of the pelvis, extension of the hips (bridging), and rotation of the trunk initiated from the upper and lower part of the trunk. Exercises in a sitting position included: flexion and extension of the trunk (the patient flexes and extends the trunk without moving the trunk forwards or backwards); flexion and extension of the lumbar part of the spine (this involves selective anteflexion and retroflexion of the lower part of the trunk); flexion and extension of the hips with the trunk extended (with an extended trunk, the movement is initiated in the hips and the patient brings the extended trunk forwards and backwards); lateral flexion of the trunk initiated from the shoulder and pelvic girdle (from the shoulder girdle means that the patient touches the exercise table with one elbow and returns to the starting position, from the pelvic girdle means that the patient lifts one side of the pelvis and returns to the starting position); rotation from the upper and lower part of the trunk (from the upper part of the trunk means that the patient moves each shoulder forwards and backwards, from the lower part of the trunk means that the patient, while sitting in the upright position, moves each knee forwards and backwards); and finally shuffling forwards and backwards on an exercise table (the participant shifts the weight from one side to the other and moves forwards and backwards on the exercise table). Exercises were gradually introduced and the number of repetitions was determined by the therapist on the basis of the patients' performance\" The individual components delivered are listed in Table 3 .

Beginning from healthy side to hemiplegia one, from bigger joint to smaller one. Paying more attention to elbow, finger and ankle, because they are vulnerable to stiff. Each joint was moved five to six times in articular direction, practising two to three times each day. (iii) Relax of hemiplegia side could be achieved through gentle and regular massage. Pectoral muscles were massaged to lessen contracture and avoid shoulder dysfunction.\" \"The massage was practised five to six times each day, and each massage lasted 15 -20 min\" \"The recover phase began one to three weeks after stroke attack. Integrated treatment could be adopted to deal with this phase. It included the rehabilitation of stiff joints and spastic muscles, the training of upper and lower limbs. Several treatments could be used in joint rehabilitation, including passive motion, intermittent or constant traction, muscle massage, drug and biological feedback treatment. Both positive and passive motions were adopted in upper limb training, stepping up and down stairs. The training was practised twice a day, with 30 min each time. ADL training could be divided into lying and sitting ADL training, so as to avoid deformity and correct abnormal motion mode\" The individual components delivered are listed in Table 3 .

Healthy limbs: therapists should be familiar with positioning of healthy limbs, and let family members understand the reason for doing so and to master these techniques. Upper limb: a pillow slightly higher than torso was placed below extended upper limb and maintained upper limb in supine position; Pelvis and lower limb: those with tendency for lower limb to buckle, while in lying position should have a pillow supporting the affected side of the limb to prevent excessive flexion. Pillows were used to prevent excessive abduction, external rotation. Participants with excessive ankle curvature or inversion used a splint board for positioning. Passive joint range of motion: from distal to proximal, 10x/joint, 2/day. Movement should be of ease, of short duration, used Brunnstrom technique's rapid traction, stimulation through overpressuring of joints, 2/day, 15min/session\" \"(ii) rehabilitative treatment on bed: This phase commenced when participants possessed good sense of awareness and communication ability: using Bobath method of holding hands, with elbow extension, shoulder elevation to 90 degrees, using both upper limbs to lead during rolling, before turning the hips. After gaining independence in rolling, participants can commence bridging exercises, ankle dorsiflexion exercises. Sitting up from bed training: increase angle of bed to 30 degrees, once participants could tolerate longer than 30mins in the angle, the angle of bed is increased by 10 degrees, until participants can maintain at 90 degrees for 30 mins. Lying to sitting and sitting balance training. The above were practised 2/day, 30 min/session, increasing to 3-4/day if participants had no discomfort\" \"(iii) Rehabilitative treatment after leaving the bed: In the rehabilitation centre, standing upright training -> forward, backward, left and right weight shifting training -> training by using the affected lower limb to support (single leg standing) -> limb loading of the affected lower limb (rising training, sitting down training, sit to stand training) -> ankle dorsiflexion -> anterior, posterior pelvic tilt training -> gait training with pelvic stabilisation (parallel bar -> flat ground -> slope -> stairs), 2/day, 1hr/session.

The patient is placed in a functional position and lightly massaged on the hands and limbs. Limbs are passively extended and retracted in small and large movements. This is in addition to rolling the patient on the bed and single and double leg bridge movements. The goal is to gradually lead the patient to balancing the trunk in a sitting position\" \"Stage 2 (sitting exercises): When the patient gains some muscle strength and muscle groups can react and work in groups, continue the exercises described above until the goals in stage one are achieved. In the meantime, add balancing exercises as well as resistance training in the sitting position. At the same time, stimulate sensory input by using cold and hot compresses and light taps to the antagonistic muscles. Gradually lead the patient into training for balancing while standing up\" \"Stage 3 (standing exercises): When the patient is at the stage where his limbs spasm and can freely initiate movement in groups, continue the exercises in stage 2 until goals are met as well as correcting and controlling irregular positions and increasing normal movement and co-ordination. In order to prepare for walking, exercise the extensor carpi muscles, supination of forearm, standing with support, standing with weights on the lower limbs and walking with support\" \"Stage 4 (walking exercises): when the patient's spasming eases, continue to complete the goals set out in stage 3 as well as walking indoors and on stairs, correcting walking posture, co-ordination and completing ADL activities\" \"Patients about to be discharged from hospital were also trained to perform ADL. For individuals with slow recovery of function, we encouraged them to overcome dependence on others and actively participate in social activities. For some patients, it was necessary to advise occupational training\" \"Psychological therapy: Patients with depression, pessimism, loss of confidence and unwillingness to cooperate with therapy were promptly given psychological care, allowing the patient to achieve optimal psychological status, as a proactive approach from the patient to rehabilitation is essential\" The individual components delivered are listed in Table 3 . Based on the individual components, this intervention is categorised as comprising functional task training, musculoskeletal intervention (active), musculoskeletal intervention (passive) and neurophysiological intervention Length of intervention period: not stated Number of sessions and length of individual sessions: \"Therapy was conducted in a oneto-one approach in one hour sessions once daily\" Intervention provider: not stated but does mention that \"therapy was conducted\u2026 with the help of the patient's family\" (2) Control group (n = 27) \"underwent conventional neurological medical therapy\" The individual components delivered are listed in Table 3 .

Patients who were unable to reach ADL independence or still had moderate to severe functional disability after the early rehabilitation period, were transferred to rehabilitation centres or the tertiary rehabilitation network hospitals' Department of Rehabilitation to undertake specific strengthening training, to minimise the patient's functional disability. This phase usually took approximately 2 months. After which, patients transferred to community rehabilitation organisations to undertake further rehabilitative training, to consolidate effects from previous rehabilitation, and to continue rehabilitation for other persisting functional disabilities. Patients in the control group discharged home after 28 days of routine treatment and early rehabilitation, were given pre-arranged guidance from professionals, and undertook rehabilitative training on their own or with assistance from their family. Community rehabilitation in certain regions was not developed, were unable to provide community rehabilitation, thus patients had to return to the tertiary rehabilitation network Department of Rehabilitation to continue training. Each tertiary rehabilitation network utilised uniform inclusion criteria to select patients, with randomisation to the rehabilitation or control group. Personnel involved in the tertiary rehabilitation network included doctors, therapists, assessors who undertook training sessions to ensure uniformity at all centres. All tertiary rehabilitation network centres used a uniform rehabilitation training method and outcome assessment\" \"Tertiary rehabilitation network treatment: Treatment during the critical phase was guided by Zhonghua Medical Association's recommendations. Rehabilitative training focused on physiotherapy (PT) and occupational therapy (OT), with speech and language therapy and psychological therapy given at centres with the capabilities. Physiotherapists delivered therapy uniformly, using Bobath techniques and methods from the motor relearning program mainly, with added use of PNF techniques, Brunnstrom etc. Therapy and training followed the patient's stroke recovery characteristics, adjusting to the patient's actual functional status, and delivered systematically and progressively\" \"Training content: During the period when patient was confined in bed, passive ranging, optimal limb positioning, rolling, sitting up, bridging exercises in bed, sitting on bed, sitting balance training etc was given. When patient could achieve sitting for 30 min without postural hypotension or other symptoms, the patient could use a wheelchair to undertake training in the gym. Training content mainly included: active-passive exercises, standing and standing balance training, lower limb weight training and shifting of centre of mass training, stepping practice and gait correction, ankle dorsiflexion, forearm pronation and supination, finger grasping etc. Family members were taught rehabilitative training methods, and at the same time, patient and family underwent health counselling, given a health education booklet, shown a video on neurological recovery etc, with the aim of furthering the patient's recovery\" The individual components delivered are listed in Table 3 .

(ii) From start of 2nd month till end of 3rd month after onset of stroke, focus was on standing training, including standing-balance training, single-leg weight bearing, gait and stair climbing/descending, and other trainings, while providing guidance on toileting, bed-chair transferring, indoors or outdoors walking, use of stairs, washing and other practical ADLs; twice a day, 45 min each time, 5 days a week. Because muscle tone could increase gradually during this period, it was necessary to increase the intensity of trainings to reduce muscle tone and inhibit abnormal exercise patterns. For some patients who returned to community setting, therapists would conduct weekly home-visits to guide the patient on rehabilitative treatment. (iii) Once training had commenced, therapists concurrently taught the patients' family members or caregiver on the correct assistive training methods and care methods, such that they could provide some training outwith therapy time, while also reducing the secondary damage due to inappropriate care. (iv) Patients learned to monitor their own body for discomfort, and report on time to therapist and caregiver\" The individual components delivered are listed in Table 3 .

When the participant felt de qi-the sensation characterized by heaviness, distension, soreness, or numbness-the acupuncturist kept the needles in situ for 30 minutes without manual or electrical stimulation. The acupuncturists followed the recommendations of a standard acupuncture textbook for the depth and angle of insertion into each acupoint. The acupuncturist needled three primary scalp points on the stroke side: the first, 2 in above the ear apex and the others, 1 in anterior and 1 in posterior to the first.

Techniques of treatment have changed over time; more recently they have become more active and functionally orientated However, there is a lack of published material describing the current treatment principles of the Bobath approach More recently (October 2000) it has been emphasised that the concepts of the Bobath approach 'integrate with the main ideas of motor learning theory', and that advocated key treatment principles include active participation, practice and meaningful goals (Mayston 2000) Normal movement Abnormal postural reflex activity/tone Postural control Key points Reflex inhibitory patterns Bobath 1959; Bobath 1966; Bobath 1970; Bobath 1978; Bobath 1990; Davies 1985; Davies 1990; Mayston 2000 Johnstone (neurophysiological) To control spasticity by inhibiting abnormal patterns and using positioning to influence tone Assumes that damaged postural reflex mecha-Use of inflatable splints Emphasis on correct position and use of splints Early stages: patient in side lying, with splint on affected arm (Continued) nism can be controlled through positioning and splinting Based on hierarchical model that assumes recovery is from proximal to distal Aim to achieve central stability, with gross motor performance, before progressing to more skilled movements Inflatable air splints: apply even, deep pressure to address sensory dysfunction Treatment progresses through hierarchy of activities, progressing from rolling through to crawling Family involvement encouraged Carr and Shepherd or motor learning or motor relearning or movement science (motor learning)",

The reason for originally highlighting the focus on postural control and lower limb function was specifically to highlight that this review excluded studies related to upper limb interventions and recovery only. However, feedback from stakeholder group members indicated that the original objectives were perceived to be misleading, as they did not incorporate the primary outcomes, which were measures of disability, and prestated relevant measures of disability such as (1) independence in ADL scales*; or (2) motor function scales.* The stakeholder group reached consensus that the phrase \"function and mobility\" was more correct and appropriate to reflect the focus of this review within the stated objective (and title).The original protocol stated a number of hypotheses. These have been removed from this update. (Original text: \"Hypotheses to be tested: (1) physiotherapy treatment based on neurophysiological principles results in better recovery of postural control and lower limb function than treatment based on motor learning principles, orthopaedic principles or a mixture of treatment principles in patients with stroke; and (2) physiotherapy treatment based on motor learning principles results in better recovery of postural control and lower limb function than treatment based on orthopaedic principles, or on a mixture of treatment principles in patients with stroke.\")",

For this update, we changed the names of each of these two subcategories (but not the content) because we considered that the original names were now potentially confusing, as other terms are more usually used in published research.

The protocol also identified participation (handicap or quality of life) as an outcome of relevance to this review. For the 2007 version of the review, the review authors documented and extracted descriptions and data from any outcomes falling into the groupings stated in the protocol. Based on the prestated groups of relevant outcomes and the availability of data from specific measures in the included trials, we discussed and reached consensus on which outcome measures should be included in the analysis. For this 2013 version of the review, the secondary outcomes remained the same as the outcomes analysed for the 2007 version (i.e. secondary outcomes).1. Balance (Berg Balance Scale). 2. Gait velocity. 3. Length of stay. In the protocol and in previous versions of this review, we carried out analysis only on outcomes reported immediately after the end of the intervention. In this 2013 version, we have carried out analyses on both outcomes reported immediately after the end of the intervention and on follow-up outcomes. ",
