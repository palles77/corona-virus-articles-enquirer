            "text": "Membrane-bound peptidases play important roles in the regulation of local concentrations of various signalling peptides such as the growth factors, hormones, chemokines and cytokines. That is accomplished by means of their enzyme activity. Recently, membrane-bound peptidases have also been shown to act as receptors, receiving signals from as yet undefined ligands and transducing them into the cell interior. By using either or both of these mechanisms, peptidases interact with fundamental cellular functions: growth, differentiation, activation and death. This study addressed the effects of a T-cell derived cytokine, interferon-gamma (IFN-g) on the activity of aminopeptidase N (APN), an ectoenzyme processing several signal peptides. Cells of a myelo-monocytic cell line HL-60 were used as a model system, and APN was assayed at the levels of mRNA, its membrane marker CD13, and the enzyme activity. Regulation of CD13/APN by IFN-g was found at all three levels. The direction of regulation was time-dependent: an initial down-regulation seen 24 and 48 hrs after the onset of treatment with IFNg was replaced by an up-regulation after 72 and/or 96 hrs. Up-regulation of CD13/APN observed after 96 hrs was preceded by an up-regulation of APN mRNA reaching its maximum after 72 hrs. The IFN-g-induced regulation of APN was due to membrane aminopeptidase N, since it could be completely abrogated by an APN blocking antibody WM-15. The delayed up-regulation of CD13/APN (observed after 72 and/or 96 hrs), required de novo protein synthesis as it could be abrogated by cycloheximide, an inhibitor of protein synthesis. Possible role of endogenous (IFN-g-induced) TGF-h in mediating CD13/APN up-regulation could be excluded, since no TGF-h was found in supernatants of IFN-g treated HL-60 cells. Thus, our data show regulation of CD13/APN on cells of 0024-3205/$ -see front matter D (J. Gabrilovac).",

            "text": "Aminopeptidase N (APN; CD13; EC 3.4.11.2), also called alanyl aminopeptidase, is a zinc-dependent metallopeptidase (clan MA, family M1, ID: M1.001, gluzincins) (Hooper, 1994; Rawlings and Barrett, 1999 ) that cleaves neutral amino acids from the N-terminus of oligopeptides (Shipp and Look, 1993; Riemann et al., 1999; Lendeckel et al., 2000) . Human APN cDNA has been cloned by two independent groups who showed its sequence to be identical to the myeloid marker CD13 (Olsen et al., 1988; Look et al., 1989) . Human APN gene, located on chromosome 15 (Look et al., 1986; Watt and Willard, 1990) , spans approximately 35 kilobases (kb), contains 20 exons (Lerche et al., 1996) and encodes two RNA transcripts (3.4 and 3.7 kb) that are controlled by two different promoters: myeloid and epithelial (Olsen et al., 1991; Shapiro et al., 1991; Olsen et al., 1994; Shapiro, 1995) . APN is membrane-bound 140-160 kDa glycoprotein with type II membrane topology. It is expressed as a non-covalently linked homodimer on the surface of hematopoietic as well as non-hematopoietic cells (Riemann et al., 1999; Van der Velden and Hulsmann, 1999; Riemann, 2002) . Outside the hematopoietic system, CD13/APN is expressed on epithelial cells of the intestine and kidney, hepatocytes, osteoclasts, endometrial cells, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, bone marrow stromal cells and on neuronal synaptic membranes (Shipp and Look, 1993; Lendeckel et al., 2000) . Although conventionally accepted as a myeloid marker for normal and malignant cells of the myeloid lineage, CD13/APN has recently been detected as well on the lymphocytes, following malignant transformation, inflammation and cell activation (Wex et al., 1997; Lendeckel et al., 1999; Riemann et al., 1999; Lendeckel et al., 2000) .",

Its spectrum encompasses opioid peptides such as enkephalins and endorphins, neuropeptides such as neurokinin A and somatostatin, inflammatory peptides such as tuftsin, N-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe (fMLP) and monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP-1), vasoactive peptides such as angiotensin III and kallidin, and peptides of the extracellular matrix (Shipp and Look, 1993; Riemann et al., 1999; Lendeckel et al., 2000) . Contradictory data on degradation of IL-8 by APN have been reported (Kanayama et al., 1995; Kehlen et al., 2001) . Recently, a more complex interaction between the IL-8 and APN in regulating the local concentration of the chemokine has been suggested, showing that inhibitor of APN bestatin, not only decreased degradation, but also increased production of IL-8 (Mishima et al., 2002) . Hence, APN is evidently involved in regulation of peptide-mediated cellular responses. By activating/inactivating extracellular peptides endowed with signal functions, APN changes their local concentrations and thereby modifies transduction of their signals (Shipp and Look, 1993; Lendeckel et al., 2000; Riemann, 2002) .",

CD13/APN is involved in processing and presentation of the peptides bound to major histocompatibility class molecules I or II on antigen-presenting cells such as mononuclear phagocytes and dendritic cells (Larsen et al., 1996; Amoscato et al., 1998) , plays a role in cell adhesion (the cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions) and in tumor cell migration (invasion) (Menrad et al., 1993; Saiki et al., 1993; Fujii et al., 1995) , controls the cell-cycle and proliferation of myeloid and lymphoid cells (Wex et al., 1997; Lendeckel et al., 1996; Lendeckel et al., 1999; Lfhn et al., 2002) , and participates in the signal transduction cascade in myeloid and lymphoid cells (Lendeckel et al., 2000; Santos et al., 2000a) .

In order to examine this hypothesis, an inhibitor of protein synthesis, cycloheximide, was applied 24 hrs before the CD13 up-regulation becomes detectable. Cycloheximide abrogated the CD13 increase in a dosedependent manner (Fig. 7) . Assuming that the de novo synthesised protein might be TGF-h, a potent CD13/APN stimulator of another cell line of monocytic origin, U-937, we determined its presence in supernatants of IFN-g-treated HL-60 cells. However, no TGF-h was found at either IFN-g concentration (25 and 6.2 ng/mL) applied after 48, 72 or 96 hrs (data not shown).

IFN-g-induced changes in APN expression can be completely abrogated by an APN blocking antibody WM-15, hence, these changes can be attributed to a membrane aminopeptidase N.

Since the HL-60 cell line, used as a model in this study, is of myelo-monocytic origin, we can speculate that a similar decrease of the APN expression on mature granulocytes and monocytes at the sites of inflammation might help ensure high and sustained concentrations of pro-inflammatory peptides in early stages of the inflammatory process. Indeed, a decreased APN expression was recorded on peripheral blood monocytes after a 3-day treatment with IFN-g (Van Hal et al., 1994) . Several inflammatory peptides have been reported to be substrates for APN, such as chemokine MCP-1 (Weber et al., 1996) , chemotactic peptides fMLP (Shipp and Look, 1993) and tuftsin (Xu et al., 1995) ; and vasoactive peptide angiotensin III (Riemann et al., Fig. 7 .

Similar data have been reported by Riemann et al. (1999) and Van der Velden et al.

Increased CD13/APN, associated with increased APN mRNA, was found by Van Hal et al. (1994) on endothelial cells after a 2 to 4 days treatment with IL-4. Recently, TGF-h has also been reported to up-regulate CD13 on human monocytic cells (Kehlen et al., 2000) . The increase could be observed at the mRNA level, as well as at the level of membrane protein and APN enzyme activity. The intensity of changes induced by TGF-h was mRNA N CD13 N APN. The data presented in this study are in line with those reported by Kehlen et al.

In contrast to lowdifferentiated (myelo-monocytic) HL-60 cells that express high levels of CD13/APN, cells of the U937 line are partly differeniated toward monocytes and express low levels of CD13/APN (data not shown). We show here that IFN-g moderately increased (for 30% to 89%) the high basal level of CD13 in HL-60 cells. However, IFN-g strongly increased (up to 5 times) the low basal level of CD13 expressed on U937 cells, but no initial decrease of CD13 was observed on U937 treated with IFN-g (data not shown; manuscript in preparation). Thus, IFN-g increased CD13/APN on both cell lines of myelo-monocytic or monocytic origin (HL-60 and U937, respectively), but the extent and kinetics of the increase differed. Kehlen et al. (2000) studied regulation of CD13/APN by TGF-h on the partly differentiated monocytic cell line U937 and on the more differentiated monocytic line Mono-Mac6 and found that the up-regulation was more pronounced in the immature than in the mature cells. In the view of those, as well as our data, the APN regulation by IFN-g might be relevant for cells of myelo-monocytic origin.",

Indeed, the IFN-g-induced CD13 up-regulation could be abrogated by cycloheximide in a dose-dependent manner, demonstrating requirement for de novo synthesis of protein(s). TGF-h, a powerful stimulator of APN on monocytic cell line U937 (Kehlen et al., 2000) , was checked as a possible candidate, but was not found in supernatants of IFN-g-treated HL-60 cells. Thus, the upregulating effect of IFN-g on CD13/APN could not be attributed to TGF-h. This conclusion is further strengthened by our observation that HL-60 cells could increase CD13 expression upon stimulation with exogenously added TGF-h (data not shown). IL-4, also reported as potent modulator of CD13/APN on bronchial epithelial cells (Van der Velden et al., 1998) and fibroblasts (Sorrell et al., 2003) , could be excluded as a mediator of IFN-g-induced CD13 up-regulation as well, as it only marginally (up to 10%) and transiently increased CD13 on HL-60 cells after 24 hrs treatment (data not shown). Similarly to the results of this study, Stefanovi\u0107 et al. (1992) observed postponed up-regulation of CD13 on glomerulal epithelial cells treated with IFN-g for 5 to 11 days.",

Thus, the same cytokine appears to be capable of down-and up-regulating cellular armament, by which cells optimise local concentrations of signalling peptides.
