            "text": "New infectious diseases continue to emerge and old ones have re-emerged in recent decades. Often these events begin and take root in developing countries. Infectious diseases of the developing world or emerging infections are defined by the Institute of Medicine as an infectious disease that has come to medical attention within the past two decades, or for which there is a potential that its prevalence will increase in the near future. Frequently, these diseases exist in nature as zoonoses and cross over to humans when people come into contact with formerly isolated animal population, such as monkeys in a rain forest that become less isolated with deforestation. Drug resistant organisms may also be considered as emerging infections since they result from human influence. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Ebola virus, hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, monkey pox and multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MDR-TB), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) associated coronavirus and avian influenza are examples of emerging infections. Many of these infections have arisen and become major health issues in the developing world, in part due to selection factors as noted above. Additionally, inadequate resource for public health surveillance and treatment of these illnesses plus poor sanitation and nutritional status may contribute to their flourishing. Once established, these illnesses then pose concerns for all mankind as we have truly become a global community. For these same reasons even common infections such as rotavirus gastrointestinal infection or respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) exert a greater toll in the developing world. Thus, even as molecular biology advances approaches to diagnoses, new challenges to prevention and treatment of infectious diseases continue to emerge. Through a discussion of avian influenza and MDR-TB, primarily, we will demonstrate the magnitude of the problems of infectious diseases in the developing world and discuss approaches that can be taken to in an attempt to monitor and contain these new threats as they emerge.",

            "text": "Throughout history influenza has been a major infectious disease problem for man causing significant morbidity and mortality. Influenza viruses are members of the Orthomyxoviridae (myxo \u00bc mucous, Gr.) family and are classified into three types A, B, and C, based on the composition of their viral nuclear proteins. Influenza A viruses are further categorized into subtypes based on the antigenic structure of the two-surface membrane glycoproteins, hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N). Both of these proteins play critical roles in the viral life cycle. The hemagglutinin protein is involved in the process of viral attachment and entry to the host epithelial cell to initiate the process of viral infection. The neuraminidase is involved at the other end of the replication cycle as it functions to snip the cell membrane releasing newly made viral particles from the infected cell.",

            "text": "The influenza virus genome is composed of 8 segmented pieces of RNA with each coding for a separate viral protein. These viral proteins may change slowly (antigenic drift) through point mutations occurring during viral replication or suddenly (antigenic shift). The latter occurs only in influenza A strains and it results from a combination of the segmented genome described above and the ability of influenza A strains of human and avian origin to co-infect the same host (typically, pigs or swines are most receptive), and share their genetic information. During this process of reassortment a new strain acquiring one of the avian surface protein genes (H or N) may emerge. Such a novel strain then eludes pre-existing immunity in people previously infected with influenza and may spread rapidly among the entire population. This defines the potential for worldwide spread or an influenza pandemic. A number of influenza pandemics were documented over the 20th century with the most notable being the 1918-1919 Spanish or swine flu epidemic. During this pandemic, a new for the time H1NI strain arose leading to an estimated 20 million deaths worldwide. Scientists to this date, continue to study this strain attempting to discern virulence factors that contributed to the severity of illness caused by this strain. It has been suggested that the recently observed avian influenza H5N1 strain to be described below may share some of these same virulence properties which may contribute to the 450% mortality observed in the limited number of human cases reported to date [1]. Specifically, this virus predominately attaches to lower respiratory tract cells (type II pneumocytes, alveolar macrophages and nonciliated bronchiolar cells) leading to severe lower respiratory tract damage. However, it does not appear to attach well to upper respiratory tract cells, possibly explaining the low human-to-human risk from this strain [2] .",

The majority (95%) of tuberculosis occurs in the developing world, where the high relative cost, poor accessibility of medications, and weak health infrastructure causes poor compliance and subsequent selection of resistant strains of M. tuberculosis to the drugs it was exposed to. Two-thirds of people with TB do not have access to effective therapy. But even when therapy is available and properly utilized, it may be incompletely effective against these multi-drug resistant strains of tuberculosis.

Moxifloxacin has a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) against M. tuberculosis fourfold lower than levofloxacin, a second-generation fluoroquinolone already in use for MDR-TB. (Older fluoroquinolones like levofloxacin and ofloxacin are only used for MDR-TB treatment because of initial studies showing lack of superiority to existing first-line drugs.) It also has a long half-life and high area under the curve concentration. A murine model study found that substituting moxifloxacin for isoniazid decreased the overall time necessary for TB eradication by two months. Moxifloxacin is currently in four different Phase II trials in eight countries -Brazil, Canada, South Africa, Spain, Tanzania, Uganda, the United States, and Zambia, with a goal of demonstrating efficacy as a first-line component of a shorter, standardized TB treatment regimen. The hypothesis is that moxifloxacin substitution for isoniazid or ethambutol in the usual four drug standard regimen (isoniazid, rifampin, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide) during the first two months of treatment will significantly increase the proportion of patients with culture-negative sputum at 8 weeks, compared with the standard regimen. Phase II trials, are expected to complete in 2007, with Phase III trials to follow. Moxifloxacin metabolism also does not utilize the hepatic cytochrome P-450 system, and does not lead to adverse reactions when taken alongside ARVs. However, one recent study in Italy found that 12/38 patients treated with long-term moxifloxacin for TB developed adverse reactions. None of the reactions was irreversible or fatal, and moxifloxacin was felt to be safe and result in treatment success in 31/38 patients. The success rate was only 5/14 in MDR-TB patients [14] .",

It has a novel mechanism of action inhibiting protein and lipid synthesis, which is effective against both TB and tested clinical isolates of MDR-TB. It attacks the mycobacteria in both the initial, intensive phase of TB therapy, as well as the later, continuation phase. In the intensive phase, PA-824 has bactericidal activity comparable to isoniazid, and in the continuation phase, its bactericidal activity is close to the combination of isoniazid and rifampin. PA-824 also has activity against both actively replicating and the static, slow growing mycobacteria. This has the potential for shortening the course of therapy, since many current drugs are only active against actively replicating mycobacteria, and M. tuberculosis spends weeks to months in its static, slow-growing phase. In a murine model, PA-824 was more potent than rifampin when used in combination with moxifloxacin and pyrazinamide, and that when all four drugs were used together, the duration of treatment could be reduced to 3 months or less [20] . PA-824 successfully completed a phase I clinical trial in the U.S. in August 2005, and a phase II trial is planned for later in 2006, ending in 2008.",
