Here we describe the epidemiology of seasonal human coronaviruses (sCoVs) and other cocirculating viruses in the West of Scotland, UK. We analyzed routine diagnostic data for >70,000 episodes of respiratory illness tested molecularly for multiple respiratory viruses between 2005 and 2017. Statistical associations with patient age and sex differed between CoV-229E, CoV-OC43 and CoV-NL63. Furthermore, the timing and magnitude of sCoV outbreaks did not occur concurrently and coinfections were not reported. With respect to other cocirculating respiratory viruses, we found evidence of positive, rather than negative, interactions with sCoVs. These findings highlight the importance of considering cocirculating viruses in the differential diagnosis of COVID-19. Further work is needed to establish the occurrence/degree of cross-protective immunity conferred across sCoVs and with COVID-19, as well as the role of viral coinfection in COVID-19 disease severity.",

In such cases, we retained the first observed episode to remove patient-level clustering, leaving 56,276 patient observations for analysis ( Figure 1 ). We used multivariable logistic regression to investigate associations between each sCoV type (CoV-229E, CoV-OC43 and CoV-NL63) and patient age (categorical), season (categorical). Statistical interactions between patient covariates and healthcare service were assessed. An alpha level of 5% was used to determine statistical significance of all model coefficients. The fitted models, incorporating age-healthcare service interactions were used to generate average predicted probabilities of virus detection by age and healthcare setting.",

Epidemiological knowledge of seasonal human coronaviruses (sCoVs) is lacking for many settings due to an absence of inclusion in routine diagnostic testing.

The common occurrence of sCoVs during periods of high influenza activity highlights the importance of considering these viruses in the differential diagnosis of viral respiratory infections. This is particularly pertinent in the context of COVID-19 emergence; cocirculating viruses are associated with a broad spectrum of clinical presentation overlapping that of COVID-19, raising the potential for a large number of undiagnosed or misclassified cases in settings lacking the capacity for multiplexed testing. Currently in NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Scotland, the majority of COVID-19 testing is being conducted in the hospital setting, where all cases of respiratory illness are simultaneously tested for influenza, RSV, adenovirus and mycoplasma pneumoniae using a multiplex panel, and severely ill patients receive a full multiplex that includes sCoVs.",

It is possible that pre-existing cross-immunity confers protection and/or attenuates the severity of COVID-19 leading to fewer tested/hospitalized children. The comparatively lower proportion positive and detection odds for school-aged children compared to younger children may potentially reflect a sustained level of CoV-OC43 immune-mediated protection, whereas waned immunity is expected to leave adults more vulnerable to coronavirus infections [27] . Assuming some degree of cross-immunity with COVID-19, our data are consistent with an expected fewer cases of COVID-19 in children but more cases among the adult population.

In previous extensive analyses of virus-virus interactions, we found a strong signal of positive interactions at the within-host scale between human coronaviruses overall and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), adenovirus (AdV) and parainfluenza viruses (combining types 1 and 3; human respirovirus genus) [6] . Here, our more in-depth analysis corroborates positive interactions at the sCoV type level. For CoV-OC43, the most prevalent in this study population, our results support our earlier findings of a higher propensity of coinfection with RSV, AdV and PIV3 than with other respiratory viruses. Note, these analyses were based on routine diagnostic testing and therefore the directionality of effects could not be determined. The association with RSV was not supported following a correction for multiple comparisons, although previous studies also report a high proportion of sCoV coinfections with RSV [12, 34] . The role of viral coinfections in the severity of acute respiratory illness remains a controversial topic [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] .",
