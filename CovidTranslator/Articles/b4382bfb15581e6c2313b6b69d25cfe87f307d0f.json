We illustrate that the support with a patterned structure of nanosized gold can be exploited for (cryo) electron tomography application as a specimen support with predefined alignment markers. This nanogold patterned support has several advantages. The Si 3 N 4 window provides a 50 nm thin, strong and flat support with a \u223c0.7 mm 2 large electron-beam transparent window. The nanogold pattern has a user-defined size and density, is highly regular and stable. This facilitates accurate tracking during tilt series acquisition, provides sufficient contrast for accurate alignment during the image reconstruction step and avoids an uneven lateral distribution and movement of individual fiducials. We showed that the support is suitable for electron tomography on plastic sections.",

            "text": "One of the parameters that define the quality of tomograms acquired with transmission electron microscopy (TEM) is the accuracy by which the individual images of an acquired tilt series can be aligned relative to each other. This alignment step can be performed in several ways. One approach is to make use of cross-correlation between pairs of individual images in the acquired tilt series. Here, the relative shifts between the images are computed making use of the inherent image contrast generated by the electron microscope specimen. This approach is often referred to as fiducial-less alignment. Another, more often used, approach makes use of fiducial markers that are deposited on the specimen support. In this approach the locations of the markers are used for alignment of the tilt series. In most cases, these fiducial markers are nanometer sized (ranging from 5 to 20 nm) spherical gold beads [3] that provide high contrast. Suspensions of (protein-stabilized) gold beads are added to and mixed with the sample or applied onto the specimen support film prior to adding the sample. An advantage of this fiducial-marker approach is that it allows retrieving not only image shifts, but that it is also a suitable approach to determine image rotations and local image distortions based on a geometrical model of the specimen tilting. Disadvantage of the fiducial marker approach is that the spatial distribution and amount of gold beads on the specimen support is hard to control. The unpredictable amount of markers and irregular distribution can result in areas on the specimen support that are suboptimal for tracking during data collection and for alignment during image reconstruction. Additionally, it is known that individual gold fiducials can move during data acquisition, both on cryo-sections which can suffer random distortions [4] and on plastic sections due to shrinkage [5, 6] . This leads to an imperfect alignment of the acquired tilt series. Therefore, control over the size, concentration and positioning of fiducials on the support, as well as the firm attachment to the support would be advantageous for accurate tracking and alignment in electron tomography. Different nanofabrication techniques have been applied to engineer nano-patterns [7] and even nanogold arrays [8] on silicon surfaces, for applications in cell biology and electronics and optics [9] .",

These silicon-based supports have the advantages that they are flat and strong, that the electron beam transparent window is not obstructed by grid bars and that the size and positioning of fiducial markers is predefined. The advantages of the patterned gold are that fiducials are evenly spread in a predefined pattern and density, and that they are firmly attached to the highly flat support, avoiding possible movement of individual fiducials.

LPCVD (low-pressure chemical vapor deposition) silicon nitride with a thickness of 50 nm is deposited on the wafer. Since the deposition takes place in a furnace (Tempress Systems) the wafer is coated from both sides. In the next lithography step windows are opened in the photoresist layer (ZEP 520), defining the different chips and the transparent membrane locations. The pattern was written by using electron beam lithography with 100 keV beam energy. In order to reduce the writing time the pattern consisted of small squares and diagonals. However, mask contact lithography could be used in case of mass production (where a fixed design is used) to reduce the cost. After development the nitride layer was patterned by dry etching, using CHF 3 /Ar chemistry. The nitride layer serves as a mask during the consequent wet etching step with KOH solution (30 wt%, 83 1C). The etch rate of silicon nitride in KOH is less than 1 nm/h and can be neglected. Etch rates for silicon, silicon nitride and silicon dioxide are varying with concentration and temperature of KOH [10, 11] . The silicon etches anisotropically along the (111)-plane in KOH, with an angle of 54.71 from the (100)-plane. Once the wafer is etched through down to the silicon nitride layer on the opposite site, the etching is stopped. After cleaning and drying the wafer, patterns of gold markers are produced on the silicon nitride window. After that the different support samples are separated from the wafer by breaking along the predefined scribe lines.",

            "text": "The gold marker patterns are produced using a combination of electron beam lithography (EBPG) and metal evaporation (Fig. 1A) . First, a 350 nm thick layer of polydi(m)ethyl glutarimide (PMGI, 7% in anisol) and 60 nm polymethyl-methacrylate (PMMA, 950 K, 2% in anisol) was deposited by spin-coating on a 50 nm thick Si 3 N 4 membrane (Fig. 1B) . To facilitate the removal of both layers by a lift-off process the PMGI layer is etched away under the PMMA layer. Both layers are subsequently prebaked -PMGI at 200 1C for 15 min and the PMMA layer had to harden by baking it at 175 1C for at least 60 min to prevent it later from collapsing after development of the PMGI layer. Then a pattern of dots of two different sizes with diameters of \u223c30 nm for TEM imaging and \u223c250 nm for light microscopy and low magnification TEM imaging are written by exposure of the Si 3 N 4 /PMGI/PMMA to a 100 keV electron beam. The electron beam exposure dose for the small dots was in the range of 40,000 mC/cm 2 . The pattern consisted of 10 nm diameter dots with a 500 nm pitch. After electron beam etching and dry etching the exposure the irradiated PMMA is removed by solubilization in 25% methylisobutylketone (MIBK) in isopropylalcohol (IPA). In order to get a good pattern resolution a developer temperature of 5 1C and a development time of 150 s were used. In the next step the PMGI was etched under the PMMA layer using MF-321 developer (Sigma-Aldrich). The etching time was found to be very critical. Too short times resulted in a not completely developed PMGI layer and too long times resulted in the collapse of the PMMA. The optimal etching time was found to be 18 s. In the next step subsequently 5 nm of chromium and 15 nm of gold are deposited by evaporation (Temescal electron beam evaporator) on the sample. The chromium was needed for proper adhesion between the Si 3 N 4 window and the gold. The deposition rates were kept as low as possible in order to minimize heating of the PMMA. Finally, the PMMA and PMGI are removed in 1-methyl-2pyrrolidinone. The smallest dots that are produced in the above described manner have a diameter of about 30 nm. The bigger gold structures of \u223c250 nm in the pattern are written in PMMA at a dose of 18,000 mC/cm 2 .",

Design of the nanogold array on silicon nitride as support for electron microscopy specimens For electron tomography applications the design of the silicon nitride support with nanofabricated arrays of gold dots had to meet several criteria. The silicon nitride on which the nanogold array is placed should be thin to be sufficiently electron transparent. Furthermore, the window should be large enough to allow tilt angles up to 601 without obstructing the view by the supporting silicon during electron tomography acquisition. Therefore, silicon nitride electron transparent windows of 50 nm thickness were made on (100) silicon wafers of 200 \u03bcm thickness. A mask of 700 \u00c2 1100 \u03bcm was written in the silicon wafer, which after KOH etching resulted in a 417 \u00c2 817 \u03bcm transparent Si 3 N 4 window. The electron beam passing through the center of the Si 3 N 4 windows can pass unobstructed up to 681 tilts. Several viewing windows were produced on one silicon wafer, which were separated by etched scribe lines, delineating squares of 2.15 \u00c2 2.15 mm (resulting in a diagonal size of 3.05 mm). The scribe lines facilitated separation of the silicon wafer into smaller pieces that fitted standard TEM holders.",

To guide the positioning of the sections four markers were used that are visible by eye (Fig. 2D ). In the transmission electron microscope the sections can be seen being placed over the nanogold array ( Fig. 2E and F) . The advantage is that the silicon nitride support is very flat and spans millimeter long distances without obstruction of grid bars.

Firm attachment of the cryo-section to the support is important for electron tomography data acquisition since the fiducials are present on the specimen support and have to be in close proximity to the section in order to use them for tilt series alignment. For this purpose, a charging device was used to attach these to the support [14] . However, using the charging device the cryo-sections attached readily to the silicon support, but not to the silicon nitride window. Evaporation of an additional layer of carbon on top of the silicon nitride window had the effect that the sections not only attached firmly to the silicon support, but also to the carbon coated silicon nitride window.",

In addition, the thin silicon nitride viewing windows are still relatively thick (50 nm) compared to standard carbon support films (\u223c10 nm). This thickness leads to increased noise levels in the cryo-electron microscopy images, resulting in a decreased resolution. Furthermore we noticed that cryo-sections attached irreproducibly to the Si 3 N 4 window and charging and heating effects under the electron beam were observed. Nevertheless, these disadvantages can be solved by dedicated engineering. For example by nanopatterning on other types of available support, like TiSi metal glass [15] , holey carbon or graphene.",

Even at very low electron dose imaging conditions (0,10 s exposure time, spot 11 and a spread beam resulting in minimal camera counts (\u223c8 counts per pixel), the automated data acquisition tracking software performed accurately and reliably.

Another current disadvantage is the relative large size of the gold dots used. While gold fiducials in electron tomography are generally between 5 and 15 nm, the minimal size of the currently used dots are about 25 nm. Recently, it was show that new NEMS techniques are available to produce smaller dots in the size range of 5-10 nm [15] . For a large scale production of these type of carriers, techniques have to be developed that enable to write large areas of dots on the viewing windows.

A Si 3 N 4 window is created by electron beam lithography and dry etching. The silicon is removed by KOH wet etching. (B) On the 50 nm silicon nitride window a 350 nm layer of PMGI and a 60 nm layer of PMMA are deposited by spin coating. A desired pattern of 10 nm spots is written by an electron beam. The exposed areas of the top PMMA layer are removed. The PMGI underlying the open areas in the PMMA layer is chemically washed away. A 5 nm layer of chrome and a 15 nm gold layer are evaporated (onto the Si 3 N 4 window). The PMGI/PMMA with the Cr/Au is removed and the pattern of gold dots on the Si 3 N 4 window remains.",
