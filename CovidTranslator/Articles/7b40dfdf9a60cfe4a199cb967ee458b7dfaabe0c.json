There is limited support for many of its key epidemiologic features, including the incubation period, which has important implications for surveillance and control activities. Here, we use data from public reports of 101 confirmed cases in 38 provinces, regions, and countries outside of Wuhan (Hubei province, China) with identifiable exposure windows and known dates of symptom onset to estimate the incubation period of 2019-nCoV. We estimate the median incubation period of 2019-nCoV to be 5.2 days (95% CI: 4.4, 6.0), and 97.5% of those who develop symptoms will do so within 10.5 days (95% CI: 7.3, 15.3) of infection. These estimates imply that, under conservative assumptions, 64 out of every 10,000 cases will develop symptoms after 14 days of active monitoring or quarantine. Whether this risk is acceptable depends on the underlying risk of infection and consequences of missed cases. The estimates presented here can be used to inform policy in multiple contexts based on these judgments.",

A novel strain of coronavirus belonging to the same family of viruses causing Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), and the common cold was subsequently isolated from lower respiratory tract samples of four patients on 7 January 2020 [2] . Cases with no travel history to Wuhan have been reported, indicating likely human-to-human transmission [3] . On 30 January 2020, the World Health Organization declared that the 2019-nCoV outbreak constitutes a Public Health Emergency of International Concern [4] . Within 8.5 weeks of symptom onset of the first confirmed case (1 December 2019), there were more than 7,700 confirmed cases and 170 deaths reported worldwide [4] . On 31 January 2020, the United States Centers for Disease Control announced that all citizens returning from Hubei Province, China would be subject to mandatory quarantine for up to 14 days [5] .",

A more recent analysis based on 10 confirmed cases in China provided a similar estimate, showing a mean incubation period of 5.2 (95% CI: 4.1, 7.0) days [7] . This estimate is also in line with clinical reports of a familial cluster of 2019-nCoV in which symptom onset occurred 3-6 days after assumed exposure in Wuhan [1] . These estimates of the incubation period of 2019-nCoV are consistent with those of other known human coronaviruses, including SARS (mean 5 days, range 2-14 days; [8] ), MERS (mean 5-7 days, range 2-14 days; [9] ), and non-SARS human coronavirus (mean 3 days, range 2-5 days; [10] ).",

For most cases, the interval of possible 2019-nCoV exposure was defined as the time between earliest possible arrival to Wuhan and latest possible departure from Wuhan. For cases without history of travel to Wuhan but with assumed exposure to an infectious individual, the interval of possible 2019-nCoV exposure was defined as the maximum possible interval of exposure to the infectious person (including time before the infectious individual was symptomatic). We assumed exposure always preceded symptom onset. If we were unable to determine the latest exposure time from the available case report, we defined the upper bound of the exposure interval to be the latest possible time of symptom onset. When earliest possible time of exposure could not be determined, we defined it as 1 December 2019, the date of symptom onset of the first known case [1] ; we performed a sensitivity analysis for the selection of this universal lower bound. When the earliest possible time of symptom onset could not be determined, we assumed it to be the earliest time of possible exposure. When the latest time of possible symptom onset could not be determined, we assumed it to be the latest time of possible case detection.

We fit the model to all observations, and to subsets for only observations who experienced a fever and only observations detected inside or outside of mainland China as subset analyses. Finally, we also fit three other commonly used incubation period distributions (gamma, Weibull, and Erlang).
