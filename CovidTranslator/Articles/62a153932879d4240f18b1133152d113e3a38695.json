A practical capability for cat transgenesis is needed to realize the distinctive potential of research on this neurobehaviorally complex, accessible species for advancing human and feline health. For example, humans and cats are afflicted with pandemic Aids lentiviruses that are susceptible to species-specific restriction factors. here we introduced genes encoding such a factor, rhesus macaque trimcyp, and eGFP, into the cat germline. the method establishes gamete-targeted transgenesis for the first time in a carnivore. We observed uniformly transgenic outcomes, widespread expression, no mosaicism and no F1 silencing. trimcyp transgenic cat lymphocytes resisted feline immunodeficiency virus replication. this capability to experimentally manipulate the genome of an Aids-susceptible species can be used to test the potential of restriction factors for hiV gene therapy and to build models of other infectious and noninfectious diseases.",

Medical surveillance of this most common companion animal is extensive, and over 250 hereditary pathologies common to both cats and humans are known 1 . The F. catus genome was recently sequenced at light (1.9\u00d7) coverage and a 10\u00d7 assembly is imminent 2 . Over 90% of identified cat genes have a human homolog, and compared with the mouse there are fewer genomic rearrangements. Intermediate size, prolific breeding capacity, similarity of systems to humans, abundance, modest costs and the neurobehavioral complexity of a Carnivoran make the cat of value in experimental settings ranging from neurobiology to diverse genetic, ophthalmologic and infectious diseases. These include conditions in which mice or rats are not useful on the basis of disease susceptibility, organ size or other factors 1 . Cat transgenesis is thus of interest for both human and cat health research and potentially for developing ways to confer protection from epidemic pathogens to free-ranging feline species, all 36 of which now face the threat of extinction 3 .",

The causative lentiviruses, feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) and HIV-1, are highly similar in genome structure, disease manifestations and host cell dependency factor use 4, 5 . The differences between these lentiviruses are also informative and potentially exploitable. For example, species-specific lentiviral restriction factors such as TRIM and APOBEC3 proteins 6 restrict FIV and HIV-1 with distinctive patterns [7] [8] [9] [10] . These genes have not been studied in a controlled manner at the systemic and species levels by introduction into the genome of an AIDS virus-susceptible species (Old World primates or felids). Given the challenges inherent to macaque transgenesis, the AIDS virus-susceptible cat would be singularly positioned for such studies if it can be accessed by genetic approaches used in mice. In contrast to primates, feline species lack antiviral TRIM5\u03b1 genes 11 but have potently restrictive APOBEC3 proteins 9, 10 , which sets up intriguing possibilities for testing such genes at the whole-animal level, for conferring gene-based immunity with them or engineered variants 12, 13 , and potentially for HIV-1 disease model development 10 .",

The latter combination was expressed from either a dual promoter or as a single 2A peptide-linked preprotein. After microinjection we performed IVF with cat sperm 10 h later. We consistently observed embryo-pervasive, abundant expression of both proteins encoded by dual gene vectors in cat blastocysts when we injected lentiviral vector before IVF ( Fig. 1b and Supplementary Table 2 ). We observed no detrimental effects of dual expression on embryo development or GFP expression irrespective of transgene combination (Supplementary Table 2 ). In addition, the 2A peptide or the dual promoter were each effective for simultaneous expression.",

For the live kittens, we collected cells for protein analyses by oral mucosa scrapings (which showed GFP-expressing squamous epithelial cells), and blood and semen collection. Both transgenes were expressed in activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) but with notable variation (Fig. 3a,b) . Percentages of GFP-positive cells as determined by FACS were 15-80% in TgCat1, TgCat2 and TgCat3 and increased gradually as the kittens aged (Fig. 3b,c) . TgCat2 had the most GFPpositive cells in the PBMC compartment, being about 65% GFPpositive early in life and then over 70-75% later (Fig. 3a-c and  Supplementary Fig. 3) . Several specific aspects here are interesting for developing models that will depend on lymphocyte or monocyte lineage expression. First, irrespective of promoter used, FACS and immunoblot detection of GFP and rhTRIMCyp in PBMCs in living cats required activation by phytohemagglutin-E (PHA-E) and interleukin 2 (IL-2), and GFP expression increased steadily with time in culture (Fig. 3c) . Fluorescence intensity was variable ( Fig. 3b and Supplementary Fig. 3a) . Second, driving GFP expression from a minimal CMV (mCMV) promoter element adjacent to the PGK promoter was effective in TgCat2, but we observed only low GFP expression with the same vector in TgCat1, although even in this cat GFP expression increased steadily from rare positives to 14.8% by 20 months (Fig. 3b,c) . Third, all three cats expressed hemagglutinin epitope (HA)-tagged rhTRIMCyp in the bulk PBMC population as detected by immunoblotting (Fig. 3a) . TgCat1 consistently expressed more rhTRIMCyp than the other two living cats by quantitative western blot analysis. However, this protein was more difficult to detect than GFP, and was clearly visualized by immunofluorescence, using an antibody to the HA tag, in only a fraction of the cells (Supplementary Fig. 3) . Even so, rhTRIMCyp transgenic cat PBMCs displayed resistance to FIV replication, with the greatest resistance to replication seen in cells from the cat that expressed the most rhTRIMCyp (TgCat1; Fig. 3d) .",

We recovered four of these preterm cats (named TgPre1-4; Table 1 ) for gross and molecular autopsy. Dissection did not identify birth defects. As for TgCat1-4, Southern blotting showed that TgPre1-4 were each amply transgenic, with 10-13 genomic TSinG vector insertions (Fig. 5b) and GFP expression was similarly found in all tissues tested (Fig. 5a,c) . We also probed rhTRIMCyp expression (Supplementary Fig. 5 ) using organs from a cat that was stillborn after a placental abruption (Table 1 ; TgCat5), and observed that rhTRIMCyp expression was similarly widespread, including in the main lymphoid organs (lymph node, thymus and spleen). Consistent with the immunoblotting data, tissues of individual organs were green fluorescent at the gross level. FACS of fetal PBMCs from TgPre1-4 showed that 74-100% were GFP-positive (Fig. 5e) . Southern blots of genomic DNA from the products of non-singleton pregnancies (Figs. 2b and 5b) , showed also that each was the genetically unique product of a different transduced oocyte, and none were a product of twinning after transduction.",

The approach enables transgenesis by germ cell genetic modification for the first time in this species and in any carnivore. Notably, we achieved uniformly transgenic outcomes, which reduce screening cost and time. A second implication of the high efficiency and the copy numbers achieved is that it should be possible to titrate vector dose down or to microinject a mix of vectors into one oocyte to produce complex multi-transgenics. The approach is accessible: feline oocytes competent for efficient transgenesis are readily obtained noninvasively and without added animal procedures from ovaries discarded during routine spaying (laparoscopic or ultrasound-guided percutaneous oocyte retrieval is also feasible). In vitro blastocyst development rates were higher than had been seen previously with SCNT-developed transgenic embryos (19-20% versus 3%) 14 . We prevented mosaicism by microinjection before IVF and observed germline transmission. The persistence of transgene expression in F1 cats is encouraging for establishing useful transgenic lines. The lack of multiple inbred strains of cat, a current limitation, could be addressed in a focused breeding project.",

            "text": "Introducing a lentiviral restriction factor(s) into the genome of the cat has specific potential because this species is naturally susceptible to lentiviral infection (and AIDS) whereas mice, unmodified or transgenic, are not. Several questions can therefore now be addressed. First, it is unknown whether introducing a single active restriction factor into the genome of an AIDS virus-susceptible species can protect it, and if so, at which of three broadly considered levels: transmission, establishment of sustained viremia and disease development. When antiviral genes are interrogated at the whole animal level by transgenesis in a natural host, results can be surprising and informative. For example, a recent transgenic intervention against influenza in chickens prevented secondary virus transmission to transgenic and nontransgenic contacts, but it had no effect on mortality after primary virus challenge 20 . Because species-specific lentiviral restriction factors have not been tested by controlled experimental introduction into an animal, the most fundamental question directly answerable with the approach is whether restriction factor transgenesis can mimic natural experiments that normally take place over large expanses of evolutionary time, with selection by viral culling, and render a species genetically immune to its own lentivirus. It is not possible to make clear predictions. For example, there are natural macaque and sootey mangabey TRIM5 alleles that do not block simian immunodeficiency virus transmission to animals that carry them but appear to constrain extent of replication in vivo and to exert selection pressure on the capsid 21 . When breeding expansion is completed with our present restriction factor transgenic cats, FIV challenges can be done.",

Furthermore, transgenesis in this accessible, abundant species with intermediate size and complex neurobehavioral repertoire will permit other human-relevant models in areas such as neurobiology, where the cat is already a paramount model. Studies in the cat have revealed much of the present knowledge on organization of the mammalian brain, in particular the visual cortex [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] ; work in this area has been critical to unraveling the neural mechanisms of vision.

Oocyte-cumulus complexes (COCs) were recovered within 6 h by repeated fine slicing of ovarian tissue in modified phosphate-buffered saline (mPBS) supplemented with 4 mg ml \u22121 bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 50 \u00b5g ml \u22121 L gentamicin. Only grade I and II oocytes 33 were used. Selected COCs were washed and matured in modified TCM-199 (Gibco) containing 1 IU ml \u22121 human chorionic gonadrotropin (HCG), 0.5 IU ml \u22121 pregnant mare serum gonadotropin (PMSG), 10 \u00b5g ml \u22121 epidermal growth factor (EGF), and 4 mg ml \u22121 BSA in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO 2 in air at 38 \u00b0C for 28 h.In vitro fertilization and in vitro culture. Twenty-eight hours after IVM, cooled spermatozoa were washed twice in Brackett-Oliphant medium supplemented with 137 \u00b5g ml \u22121 sodium pyruvate, 4 mg ml \u22121 BSA, and 50 \u00b5g ml \u22121 gentamicin by centrifugation at 1800 rpm for 5 min. The supernatant was removed and sperm pellet was diluted in 500 \u00b5L fertilization medium (G-IVF Plus, Vitrolife), and placed in the incubator to allow sperm swim-up for 30 min. The spermatozoa concentration was adjusted to 2 \u00d7 10 6 ml \u22121 . Ten oocytes were transferred into each of 100 \u00b5l sperm microdroplets under mineral oil and co-cultured for 12 h, after which presumptive zygotes were removed from sperm with a small-bore pipette, washed, and cultured in a modified Earl's balanced salt solution (MK-1) supplemented with 4 mg ml \u22121 BSA and 50 \u00b5g ml \u22121 gentamicin for 3 d. Three days after sperm exposure, cleaved embryos were selected for transfer or subsequently cultured in MK-1 medium supplemented with 5% (v/v) FBS (FBS, Hyclone laboratories) and 50 \u00b5g ml \u22121 gentamicin for a further 4 days to evaluate developmental capacities to morula and blastocyst stages.Transgenic embryo production. Before to lentiviral vector microinjection, cumulus cells were mechanically removed from the oocytes 18-20 h after incubation in maturation medium (pre-IVF injection group) or from presumptive zygotes at 12-14 h post-incubation in fertilization medium (post-IVF injection group). A volume of ~100 pl vector was injected directly into the oocyte perivitelline space 12 h before or 12 h after IVF using a finely pulled glass capillary (Femtotips, Eppendorf) connected to a microinjector (Eppendorf FemtoJet) adjusted for injection and compensation pressure with an injection time of 12 s. After microinjection, the oocytes were washed and returned to culture in IVM medium until hour 28 of maturation when they were used for IVF. For post-IVF injection, zygotes were washed and subsequently cultured in MK-1 medium. With the conditions developed, oocytes were modified at high rates without apparent toxicity to the zygotes early development and timing microinjection before fertilization created reliably non-mosaic embryos.Embryo transfer, pregnancy detection, parturition and photo graphy. Healthy 2-3-year-old SPF queens were the recipients for embryo transfer. They were induced with 150 IU PMSG injected intramuscularly at 96-120 h before IVF, followed by injection of 100 IU of HCG 72 h after the PMSG. In addition, ad lib mating with a vasectomized male was done from the day of HCG injection until the day before embryo transfer.The females were anesthetized on the day of transfer with ketamine (5 mg kg \u22121 ), medetomidine (0.03 mg/kg) and buprenorphine (0.01 mg kg \u22121 ) administered intramuscular and maintained with 1-3% isoflurane gas. Prior to abdominal incision the medetomidine was reversed with an intramuscular injection of atipamezole to minimize any effects the alpha-2 agonist may have on transfer success. An approximately 2 cm ventral midline incision was made and ovaries and fallopian tube exteriorized. Each ovary was examined for evidence of ovulation. If no corpus hemorrhagicum or corpus luteum was visualized, follicles were punctured with a needle to artificially induce ovulation. Then, a transmural puncture of the fallopian tube was performed with a 28 gauge needle and this was replaced with a fine hand-pulled glass transfer pipette, through which fifteen to twenty-five pre-loaded embryos (transduced, cleaved, >4 cell stage) in 10-20 \u00b5l MK-1 medium were transferred per fallopian tube under microscopic visualization using gentle positive mouth-controlled pressure. The pipette was withdrawn and the incision was closed in three layers.Pregnancy status was determined with a canine Relaxin kit (Synbiotics) on day 30 after transfer and by film radiography on day 45. Pregnant recipients were monitored daily until delivery of term kittens which occurred by un-assisted spontaneous vaginal birth at term. All control and transgenic animal photographs were taken with a Nikon camera at the same time using identical lighting, filter, and camera settings, with GFP imaged under blue light illumination with a long pass filter. Supplementary Figure 2 contains additional images.Immunofluorescence microscopy and immunohistochemistry. Blastocysts (Fig. 1c) were attached to a slide with BD-Cell Tak, cell and tissue adhesive, fixed and permeabilized for 15 min at room temperature in PBS supplemented with 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde and 1% (v/v) Triton X-100 and blocked with 1% BSA in PBS for 15 min. Transduced and control blastocysts and activated PBMCs were imaged by confocal microscopy with GFP fluroescence imaged directly and HA-tagged rhTRIMCyp detected using primary anti-HA (high affinity anti-HA rat monoclonal, Roche, used at 1:1000 dilution), with incubation for 1 h at RT, washed, followed by incubation with Cy3-conjugated goat anti-rat IgG secondary (1:500 dilution, Chemicon International) for 1 h. Controls with each protein alone verified no signal cross-reception nAture methods between channels and blastocysts derived from untransduced ova were negative as shown. Following three 5 min washing steps in PBS and mounting with addition of Prolong Gold anti-fade reagent with DAPI (Invitrogen) for nuclear DNA staining, the embryos were analyzed by laser confocal microscopy (Axiovert 100M; Carl Zeiss MicroImaging).Animal tissues were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and paraffin-embedded. Serial 10 \u00b5m sections were made. Immunohistochemistry was performed using a DAKO Envision Plus kit. Sections were dewaxed in xylene and rehydrated in alcohol. Endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked with 0.03% hydrogen peroxide. Sections were incubated with a 1:200 diluted primary mouse monoclonal antibody (Clontech, JL8, 1:5000) for 2 h. Dako Envision anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:200) was then applied for 30 min. The sections were mounted using Prolong Gold anti-fading reagent and observed by light microscopy.Vectors and FIV infections. All vectors and vector sequences are available from the authors upon request. Lentiviral vectors were HIV-1-based to permit PCR-based tracking of infectious FIV in future experiments. GFP is the enhanced version (eGFP). TSiN series lentiviral vectors were previously described 5 , and were prepared using 293T transfection in Nunc Cell Factories and concentrated by ultracentrifugation using established methods [34] [35] [36] . The transfer vectors have cPPT-CTS and WPRE elements and are U3-deleted. Dual gene vectors with rhesus (Macaca mulatta) TRIMcyp 8 and eGFP utilize either a porcine teschovirus 2A peptide 37 expressing a single pro-protein (human cytomegalovirus immediate early gene (hCMV)-promoted rhTRIMCyp-P2A-GFP) or a bi-directional promoter kindly provided by Amendola et al. 38 with tandemly arranged phosophglycerate kinase (PGK) and minimal CMV (mCMV, 0.16 kb) promoter elements driving rhTRIMcyp and GFP respectively on opposite strands. VSV-G-pseudotyped vectors were produced in two-chamber Cell Factories (CF2) and concentrated by ultracentrifugation over a sucrose cushion as described 5, 36 . Vectors were titrated on feline kidney cell line (CrFK) cells using flow cytometry for GFP expression. Reverse transcriptase activities were used to normalize preparations 36 . PBMCs were cultured in RPMI with 10% FCS, rhIL-2 and antibiotics and were activated with 10 \u00b5g ml \u22121 PHA-E. For FIV infection of PBMCs, 50,000 feline PBMCs were infected with 2 \u00d7 10 6 RT activity units (10 \u00b5l) of FIV 34TF10 39 generated by 293T cell transfection of pCT5 orfArep , a version of pCT5 40 in which we repaired the premature ORF-A stop codon by overlap extension PCR to enable PBMC replication. Supernatants were collected approximately every 2 d thereafter and assayed for reverse transcriptase activity as described above.Immunoblotting. Transfected cell lysate or minced tissue samples were homogenized in RIPA (150 mM NaCL, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 1% NP-40, 150 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) supplemented with protease inhibitors (complete-Mini, Boehringer). Fractions and lysates were boiled in Laemmli supplemented with \u03b2-Mercaptoethanol for 10 min, separated by gel electrophoresis, transferred onto PVDF membranes (immobilon-P, Millipore), and blocked in mPBS containing 2 mg ml \u22121 BSA and 1% Tween 20 for 1 h at room temperature (22-25 \u00b0C) . Blots were treated with primary antibodies against: GFP (JL8, 1:5000, Clontech), \u03b1-tubulin (mouse monoclonal antibody 1:8,000, Sigma), HA (high affinity anti-HA antibody, rat monoclonal, 1:1,000, Roche, cat # 11867423001) for 1 h at room temperature. After washing, secondary antibodies were applied: alkaline phosphataseconjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Calbiochem) diluted 1:10,000, and alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rat IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) diluted 1:1000. Membranes were then incubated with ECL reagent (Thermo Scientific) and exposed to film.Sperm collection and storage. Epidydymi were separated by dissection within 6 h and repeatedly finely sliced in mPBS supplemented with 4 mg ml \u22121 BSA and 50 \u00b5g ml \u22121 gentamicin to release spermatozoa. The medium was filtered with a 70 \u00b5M Cell Strainer (BD Falcon) and centrifuged at 18,000 rpm for 5 min. Sperm pellets were resuspended in 500 \u00b5l TEST yolk buffer (Refrigeration Medium, Irving Scientific) in a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube at room temperature and gradually cooled to 4 \u00b0C. The samples were kept at 4 \u00b0C until use, or cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen. Sperm of transgenic males was obtained by electroejaculation.Southern blotting. Genomic DNA of newborn and spontaneously aborted kittens was analyzed by Southern blot hybridization and PCR. Total DNA was isolated from blood, tail tips and heart using the DNeasy blood and tissue kit (Qiagen). Five micrograms DNA was digested with AflIII, BamH1 or NdeI as indicated. DNA fragments were separated by electrophoresis on 0.8% agarose gel and transferred by capillary action to a Nytran Supercharge membrane (Schleicher & Schuell Bioscience). DNA was crosslinked to the membrane using a UV Crosslinker (UVC500; Hoefer). Blots were then hybridized overnight at 42 \u00b0C in ULTRAhyb (Ambion) containing an 32 P-labeled eGFP probe. After washing at 60 \u00b0C with 0.5% SDS, 2\u00d7 SSC followed by 0.5% SDS, 0.1\u00d7 SSC, the blots were exposed to the Kodak BioMax MS X-ray film (Sigma-Aldrich) with intensifying screen at -80 \u00b0C and developed. Bands in Figure 5b and the right blot of Figure 2b are more widely spaced than bands in the left blot of Figure 2b because NdeI and BamHI cleave, on average, every 4,096 bp apart, while AflIII cuts on average every 1024 nt bp.Quantitative RTPCR and semiquantitative PCR. Transgenic and control genomic DNA samples (PBMC, tail tip and organs) were analyzed by real-time quantitative PCR using the Roche FastStart DNA Master SYBR Green Kit I. Samples were quantified against a serially-diluted plasmid standard for total GFP using the Roche LightCycler and Roche LCDA software. Initial denaturation was at 95 \u00b0C for 10 min and a melting step after amplification (40-95 \u00b0C, temperature transition rate = 0.05 \u00b0C s \u22121 ). GFP was amplified using 300 nM each sense primer 5\u2032-AGAAC GGCATCAAGGTGAAC-3\u2032 and antisense primer 5\u2032-TGCTCAGG TAGTGGTTGTCG-3\u2032. PCR amplification and analysis was performed as follows; 95 \u00b0C for 10 s, 62 \u00b0C for 10 s, 72 \u00b0C for 10 s, \u00d7 35 cycles, temperature transition rate = 5 \u00b0C s. As a loading control feline GAPDH was quantified using 300 nM each sense primer 5\u2032-ACCACAGTCCATGCCATCAC-3\u2032 and antisense primer 5\u2032-TCCACCACCCGGTTGCTGTA-3\u2032. PCR amplification and analysis was performed using a Roche Lightcycler as follows: 95 \u00b0C for 10 s, 54 \u00b0C for 10 s, 72 \u00b0C for 18 s, \u00d7 35 cycles, temperature transition rate = 5 \u00b0C s. Semiquantitative analysis for rhesus TRIMCyp was performed using Phusion Hot Start High-Fidelity",
