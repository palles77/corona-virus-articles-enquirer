However, molecular insight into ACR1 is lacking owing to the absence of structural information underlying light-gated anion conductance. Here we present the crystal structure of G. theta ACR1 at 2.9 \u00c5 resolution. The structure reveals unusual architectural features that span the extracellular domain, retinal-binding pocket, Schiff-base region, and anion-conduction pathway. Together with electrophysiological and spectroscopic analyses, these findings reveal the fundamental molecular basis of naturally occurring light-gated anion conductance, and provide a framework for designing the next generation of optogenetic tools.",

Motile organisms typically capture light using rhodopsin proteins, largely classified into two groups: microbial (type I) and animal (type II) 1,2 , both exhibiting seven-transmembrane helices and a retinal-based chromophore, but with different effector mechanisms. Animal rhodopsins primarily work as G-protein-coupled receptors that recruit secondary messengers to control effectors such as ion channels that modulate cellular activity, whereas channel and pump microbial rhodopsins can directly provide effector functionality as transmembrane current 1, 2 . Heterologous expression of single-component microbial opsin genes targeted to specific cells of animals defines an experimental approach (optogenetics 3 ) for biology, enabling control of specific cells in behaving organisms with light.",

Indeed, light-triggered cation currents are excitatory in the natural host as well; plant behaviours initially observed by botanists more than 150 years ago (movement of single-celled algae excited by light) 4 were later found to be due to CCRs, with the initially known member of this subclass (Chlamydomonas reinhardtii ChR1) identified as a cation channel in 2002 5 . Many CCRs have been discovered or designed [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] , and currently available CCRs offer a palette of diversity in absorption spectrum, photocurrent magnitude, light sensitivity and on/off-kinetics 12, 15 .",

Light-induced neuronal inhibition with microbial opsins was first achieved with inward Cl \u2212 pumps and outward H + pumps such as Natronomonas pharaonis halorhodopsin (NpHR) and archaerhodopsin-3 (AR3) 17, 18 . Although widely used, these pumps move only one ion per photon (versus hundreds for channels), thereby exhibiting reduced efficacy 15, 16 . In 2014, anionconducting channelrhodopsins (ACRs) were created 19, 20 on the CCR backbone, guided by structural modelling; subsequently, in 2015, naturally occurring ACRs were isolated from chlorophyte algae 21 (GtACR1 and GtACR2). The designed ACRs have been developed further [22] [23] [24] , and additional natural ACRs have been found by genome mining [25] [26] [27] . ACRs can translocate 10 4 -10 5 ions per second 21 and can exhibit 10 2 -10 4 -fold higher light sensitivity than inhibitory pumps [19] [20] [21] . After the first demonstration in 2015 of ACRs as inhibitory optogenetic tools that could successfully modulate animal behaviour (with a designed ACR called iC++ 22 ), both ACR classes have been widely applied in mice, flies and fish 22, 23, [28] [29] [30] .",

Notably, C1C2, CrChR2 and GtACR1 all have several (2-3) N-terminal cysteine residues, but with different positions and functions. Cys66, Cys73 and Cys75 of C1C2, and Cys34 and Cys36 of CrChR2 form three and two intermolecular disulfide bridges respectively (Fig. 2c) . Previous studies had predicted that the residue corresponding to Cys73 in C1C2 (Cys34 in CrChR2) would be Cys21 in GtACR1 26 and would form an intermolecular disulfide bridge 32 . However, the GtACR1 structure revealed that Cys21 forms not an intermolecular, but instead a new intramolecular, disulfide bridge with Cys219 on ECL3, whereas Cys6 forms an intermolecular disulfide bridge (Figs. 1, 2c) . Gel-filtration chromatography and SDS-PAGE (Extended Data Fig. 5d , e) further support the conclusion that Cys21 and Cys219 are more important for folding and expression, and Cys6 for dimerization.",

Notably, because of these differences in the N terminus and ICL2, the interface area of the GtACR1 dimer (1,315 \u00c5 2 ) is smaller than that for the C1C2 (2,027 \u00c5 2 ) or CrChR2 (1,688 \u00c5 2 ) dimers (Extended Data Fig. 5f -h). This property is concordant with our finding that loss of the intermolecular disulfide bridge markedly affects GtACR1 dimerization in SDS-PAGE analysis (Extended Data Fig. 5e ), whereas the loss of the disulfide in C1C2-CrChR2 has minimal effect on dimerization [36] [37] [38] .",

GtACR1 and C1C2 contain similar configurations of all-trans-retinal and 15-anti-retinal 34, 39, 40 (Fig. 2a) . Here we focus on comparison with C1C2, because the 2017 CrChR2 CCR structure was almost identical to the well-studied 2012 C1C2 CCR structure (Extended Data Fig. 4c ; r.m.s.d. value of 0.82 \u00c5 over all C \u03b1 atoms), and was also reported as a mixture of two states D480 and D470 3 ); in C1C2, ATR is enclosed by 16 residues (Fig. 3b ), but 11 are not conserved in GtACR1 (Fig. 3a) . To analyse the function of these residues, we measured absorption spectra and photocurrents in 10 mutants. Previous studies reported that GtACR1 has five spectroscopically distinguishable intermediate states: K, L, M, N and O (with L and M as conducting states), and with opening and closing regulated by two different mechanisms (coupled fast-opening-slow-closing and slow-opening-fast-closing) 31, 33 . Confirming previous measurements, we observed that wild-type GtACR1 photocurrent peaks at \u03bb max = 514 nm with biphasic decay (\u03c4 off1 :54 \u00b1 4.5 ms; \u03c4 off2 :280 \u00b1 25ms), and that mutant GtACR1(C102A) shows decelerated \u03c4 off2 (32 \u00b1 12 s) 31,33 (Fig. 3c , e). Notably like C102A, C102S also exhibits decelerated \u03c4 off2 (17 \u00b1 2.5 s). M105A, M105I and E163Q show markedly slowed \u03c4 off1 (120 \u00b1 30 ms, 90 \u00b1 3.9 ms and 110 \u00b1 22 ms, respectively), suggesting that Met105 and Glu163 are involved in the slow-opening-fast-closing mechanism (Fig. 3c, e) .",

Generally, the effects of aspartate-to-asparagine mutation are small when aspartate is protonated, but in the uniquely configured GtACR1 Schiff-base environment involving close apposition of Asp234, the small difference between aspartatehydroxyl and asparagine-amino could rearrange the hydrogen-bond network around the Schiff base and thus disturb light-induced conformational changes. This concept is supported by difference FTIR spectra Tau off (ms) Article reSeArcH in the amide-I region at 170 K and 200 K (Fig. 4e) : the intensity of negative bands at 1,640 and 1,655 cm \u22121 decreases in D234N, revealing that the conformational change of transmembrane helices in D234N is significantly smaller than in the wild type. Just as with D234N, the nearby Y207F mutation also causes loss-of-function (Fig. 4d) . Considering that Phe207 naturally occurs in fully functional C1C2 and even in other natural ACRs including GtACR2 and the ZipACR variant with divergent sequences 27 (Extended Data Fig. 3) , the precisely arranged hydrogen-bond network of the Schiff-base region thus appears essential for channel activity.",

First, in a pattern opposite to that of C1C2, the surface around the pore of GtACR1 is electropositive, suitable for cation exclusion and thus anion selectivity 46 ( Fig. 5a; Extended Data Fig. 10a) ; by contrast, C1C2 has 7 carboxylates along the ion-conducting pathway (Glu121, Glu122, Glu129, Glu136, Glu140, Glu162 and Asp292) and 14 carboxylates on intracellular/ extracellular surfaces (Fig. 5b; Extended Data Fig. 10b, d) , all contributing to electronegative surfaces in and around the pore suitable for anion exclusion/cation selectivity (Fig. 5b) . In GtACR1, Glu122, Glu136 and Glu162 are replaced by Ala61, Ala75 and Ser97, respectively (Fig. 5a) and Glu140 is also not conserved (Extended Data Fig. 3) .

Finally, 12 protein-surface residues are replaced with arginine or lysine; the consistency of this pattern suggests these residues (and Arg94/Lys238) contribute to a suitable electrostatic environment for cation exclusion/anion conduction in GtACR1, confirming earlier predictions 46 (Extended Data Figs. 3, 10a, c) .",

However, Glu136 and Glu140 are not conserved in GtACR1, and the extracellular-side TM1 and TM2 are markedly tilted, as described above (Figs. 2c, 5a ; Extended Data Fig. 3) . Thus, pore size becomes much larger, and EV1 becomes connected to the GtACR1 pore-pathway. Furthermore, in contrast to EV1, EV2 of GtACR1 is disconnected because of interactions among Tyr81, Arg94 and Glu223 (extracellular constriction site 2, ECS2) (Figs. 5a, 6a) , indicating that EV1 serves as the primary anion-entry pathway in GtACR1. Third, the anion-conducting pathway of GtACR1 is opened not only towards the extracellular side but also intracellularly. In C1C2, although the cation-conducting pathway is opened towards the extracellular side, the cytoplasmic side is occluded by intracellular (ICS) and central (CCS) constriction sites 34 .

In GtACR1, Glu68 and Asp234 provide the only carboxylates within 6 \u00c5 of this Schiff-base nitrogen (approximately 5.4 \u00c5 and 3.5 \u00c5, respectively), but FTIR analyses indicate that both are also protonated in the dark 45 (Fig. 4d, e) . Cl \u2212 does not have a chargestabilization role either, as Cl \u2212 is not bound to the Schiff-base region in GtACR1 33 ( Fig. 4a ; unlike in HsHR 48 ). One possible explanation is that strongly polarized water could bind to the Schiff base (behaving as a hydroxyl ion, as proposed in HsBR and mutants 2,49,50 ; Supplementary Discussion), and another possibility is that the partial-negative charge of the nearby Asp234 carbonyl is sufficient to weakly stabilize the positively charged Schiff base. As a result, the net charge in the Schiff-base region may represent the achievement of perhaps the most challenging evolutionary step in the adaptation to facilitate anion conduction (alongside the acquisition of positive surface electrostatic potential throughout the pore and vestibules; Fig. 4 ): namely, partial local positivity despite the obligate negative nature of the Schiff base counterion.",

            "text": "Sample sizes were determined based on previous literature and best practices in the field; no statistical methods were used to predetermine sample size. No experiments in animals were conducted in this paper and hence experiments were not randomized or blinded. Cloning, protein expression and purification. The crystallization construct of GtACR1 was generated with several features to enhance protein purification and crystallogenesis. The flexible 13 amino acids at the C terminus were truncated after Gly282. A Flag tag followed by the 3C protease cleavage site was added to the N terminus and an enhanced GFP (eGFP) with a His 10 tag and the 3C site was attached to the truncated C terminus via the 3C cleavage site. The finalized GtACR1 crystallization construct was expressed in Sf9 cells using the BestBac (Expression Systems) baculovirus system. Cell cultures were grown to a density of 4 \u00d7 10 6 cells ml \u22121 , infected with GtACR1 baculovirus, and shaken at 27 \u00b0C for 18 h. Then, 20 \u03bcM all-trans retinal (ATR) (Sigma) was supplemented to the culture and incubation continued for 42 more hours, and cell pellets were collected and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C. To purify GtACR1, the pellets were lysed with a hypotonic lysis buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA and protease inhibitors). The cell debris was then homogenized with a glass douncer in a solubilization buffer (1% n-dodecyl-\u03b2-d-maltopyranoside (DDM), 0.06% cholesteryl hemisuccinate tris salt (CHS), 20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 500 mM NaCl, 20% glycerol, 10 mM imidazole and protease inhibitors) and solubilized for 2 h in 4 \u00b0C. The insoluble cell debris was removed by centrifugation (38,000g, 25 min), and the supernatant was mixed with the Ni-NTA agarose resin (Qiagen) for 2 h in 4 \u00b0C. The Ni-NTA resin was collected into a glass chromatography column, washed with 20 column volumes of a wash buffer (0.05% DDM, 0.01% CHS, 20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 500 mM NaCl, 20% glycerol and 20 mM imidazole) and was eluted in a wash buffer supplemented with 250 mM imidazole. The Ni-NTA eluent was then supplemented with 2 mM CaCl 2 and was loaded over anti-Flag M1 resin over 1 h. The protein was then washed with a Flag wash buffer (0.05% DDM, 0.01% CHS, 20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 300 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol and 2 mM CaCl 2 ) and eluted with a Flag elution buffer (0.05% DDM, 0.01% CHS, 20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 300 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol, 0.2 mg ml \u22121 Flag peptide and 3 mM EDTA). After the cleavage of the Flag tag and eGFP-His 10 by His-tagged 3C protease, the sample was reloaded onto the Ni-NTA column to capture the cleaved eGFP-His 10 . The flow-through containing GtACR1 was collected, concentrated and purified through gel-filtration chromatography in a final buffer (100 mM NaCl, 20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 0.05% DDM and 0.01% CHS). Peak fractions were pooled and concentrated to 30 mg ml \u22121 (Extended Data Fig. 1b) . Crystallization. Purified GtACR1 protein was crystallized using the lipidic cubic phase (LCP) method as described previously 34 . Protein was mixed with monopalmitolein (Nu-chek) at a weight ratio of 1:1 (protein:lipid) using a coupled syringe mixing device. Then, 20-25 nl protein-LCP mixture drops were accurately dispensed on a 96-well sandwich plate and overlaid by 500 nl of precipitant solution by the Gryphon LCP robot (Art Robbins Instruments). Initial crystals were obtained in 10% (w/v) polypropylene glycol P 400 (PPG P400), 100 mM MES pH 6.0 and 100 mM potassium formate; the best crystals were obtained in 10-12% (w/v) polypropylene glycol P 400 (PPG P400), 100 mM MES pH 6.0, 100 mM potassium formate and 1-3% 1-butanol. Crystals were harvested using micromeshes (MiTeGen), and were flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen without any additional cryoprotection. Data collection and structure determination. X-ray diffraction data were collected at Advanced Photon Source GM/CA-CAT beamline 23ID-B and 23ID-D using a micro beam size of 10 \u00d7 10 \u03bcm 2 , at a wavelength of 1.033 \u00c5. Small wedge data, each consisting of 5-20\u00b0, were collected from single crystals, and 131 collected datasets were processed automatically using KAMO 52 . Each dataset was indexed and integrated using XDS 53 , and classified using the correlation coefficients between data sets. Eighty datasets in the best cluster were scaled and merged using XSCALE. The structure was determined by molecular replacement with the program MoRDa (Vagin and Lebedev; http://www.biomexsolutions.co.uk/ morda), using the cation channelrhodopsin C1C2 (PDB accession 3UG9) and G11A mutant of SARS-CoV 3C-like protease (PDB accession 2PWX) as the search models. However, the 2PWX model was not fitted to electron density at all and removed. The resultant structure was iteratively refined using Refmac5 54 , Phenix 55 and MR-rosetta 56 , and manually rebuilt in Coot 57 . The final model contained 95.7, 4.1 and 0.3% in the favoured, allowed and outlier regions of the Ramachandran plot, respectively. Final refinement statistics are summarized in Extended Data Fig. 1 . All molecular graphics figures were prepared with Cuemol (Ishitani; http:// www.cuemol.org). Electrophysiology. HEK293 cells (Thermo Fisher, authenticated by the vendor, not tested for mycoplasma contamination) were plated on poly-d-lysine coated glass coverslips (Fisher) at 10% confluency, and were transfected with 0.5 \u03bcg of a plasmid and 1 \u03bcl lipofectamine 2000 (Thermofisher Scientific) per well. After 24-48 h of transfection, cells were placed in an extracellular tyrode medium (150 mM NaCl, 4 mM KCl, 2 mM CaCl 2 , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 10 mM HEPES pH 7.4 and 10 mM glucose). A borosilicate patch pipette (Harvard Apparatus) with resistance of 3-6 M\u03a9 was filled with intracellular medium (140 mM potassium-gluconate, 10 mM EGTA, 2 mM MgCl 2 and 10 mM HEPES pH 7.2). The photocurrent and kinetic measurements were performed in voltage-clamp mode at membrane potential of \u221270 mV and \u221210 mV, respectively. Light was delivered with the Spectra X Light engine (Lumencor) connected to the fluorescence port of a Leica DM LFSA microscope, and a 513/15 filter was used for green light generation. To determine channel kinetics and photocurrent amplitudes, traces were first smoothed using a lowpass Gaussian filter with a \u22123 dB cutoff for signal attenuation and noise reduction at 1,000 Hz and then analysed in Clampfit software (Axon Instruments). Liquid junction potentials were corrected using the Clampex built-in liquid junction potential calculator as previously described 22 . Current density was calculated by dividing peak photocurrent amplitude by cell's membrane capacitance, which was calculated from the Clampex built-in membrane test. Statistical analysis was performed with t-test or one-way ANOVA, and the Kruskal-Wallis test for non-parametric data, using Prism 7 (GraphPad) software. Light-induced difference FTIR spectroscopy. Wild-type and D234N mutant GtACR1 were reconstituted into a mixture of POPE and POPG (molar ratio = 3:1) with a protein-to-lipid molar ratio of 1:30 by removing DDM with Bio-Beads (SM-2, Bio-Rad). The reconstituted samples were washed three times with buffers at pH 5.0 (2 mM citrate-NaOH), pH 7.0 (2 mM HEPES-NaOH) or pH 9.0 (2 mM borate-NaOH) with 1 mM NaCl. The pellet was re-suspended in the same buffer, with the concentration adjusted to 1.7 mg ml \u22121 . A 60 \u03bcl aliquot was placed onto a BaF 2 window and air-dried. FTIR spectroscopy was applied to the films hydrated with 1 \u03bcl H 2 O at 77 K, 170 K and 200 K as described previously 58 . In brief, the sample was placed in an Oxford DN-1704 cryostat mounted in the Bio-Rad FTS-40 spectrometer (instrumental resolution of FTIR is 2 cm \u22121 ). For the formation of photo-intermediates at 77 K, samples were illuminated at 500 nm (interference filter) from a 1-kW halogen-tungsten lamp for 2 min and photo-reversed with >600 nm light (R-62 cut-off filter, Toshiba) for 1 min. For formation of photointermediates at 170 K and 200 K, samples were illuminated with >500 nm light (Y-52 cut-off filter, Toshiba) for 1 min. For each measurement of FTIR spectroscopy, 256 interferograms were accumulated; 40 identical recordings at 77 K and 7 identical recordings at 170 K and 200 K were averaged. Measurement of UV absorption spectra. Protein absorbance spectra were measured with an Infinite M1000 microplate reader (Tecan Systems Inc.) using 96 well plates (Thermofisher scientific). The GtACR1 samples were suspended in a buffer containing 100 mM NaCl, 0.05% DDM, 0.01% CHS, and 20 mM sodium citrate, sodium acetate, sodium cacodylate, HEPES, Tris, CAPSO or CAPS. pH was adjusted from 4 to 10 by the addition of NaOH or HCl. Recorded spectra value was averaged from 20 measurements from a single session. Reporting summary.
