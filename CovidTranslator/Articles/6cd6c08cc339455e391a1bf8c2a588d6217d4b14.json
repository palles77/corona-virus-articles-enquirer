Similarly, it has been recognized that acute and chronic urticaria as well as gastrointestinal manifestations of idiosyncrasy to a specific food were more common in patients with these diseases than in the general population, and a relation to infantile eczema (Besnier's prurigo, neurodermatitis) also was observed. Eczema was found to occur more frequently in the children of patients with hay fever or asthma, and individuals who had eczema in infancy showed an usual incidence of hay fever and asthma later in life. These diseases were, therefore, considered together by Cooke and Vander Veer as a special group of diseases of human sensitization with a hereditary background, and these authors concluded that such \"sensitized individuals transmit to their offspring not their own specific sensitization, but an unusual capacity for developing bioplastic reactivities to any foreign proteins\". With further progress in determining additional characteristics of \"human sensitization\" in contrast to those of experimental anaphylaxis in laboratory animals, Coca and Cooke concluded that a clear distinctions must be made between two types of hypersensitivity manifestations: 1) the anaphylactic type of allergic response to abnormal substances 2) the atopic type of response to substances that are generally innocuous.

Thus, it appears that in anaphylaxis we are dealing with a normal (physiologic) antibody response to an unnatural exposure to antigen, whereas in atopic allergic an 'abnormal\" antibody response to natural antigenic exposure seems to be involved. Anaphylactic eactivity of the sensitized individual depends on the release of an amount of pharmacologically Lctive effector molecules sufficient to be toxic for most members of the same species. In confast, individuals with atopic disease possess a quantitatively and qualitatively abnormal reactivty to otherwise nontoxic concentrations of endogenously released or exogenously administered )harmacologic mediators. Furthermore, the quantitative change consistently is in the direction )f a decreased response when beta-adrenergic agents are the agonists and consistently in the tirection of an increased response when any one of the other pharmacologically active effector nolecules are involved. Another essential difference between the atopic and non-atopic varieties of immediate hyper-~ensitivities is the major contributory role played by infection in atopy, whereas infection has ~ot been shown to be causally related to anaphylactic allergy anaphylaxis, the Arthus reaction, )r serum sickness. Moreover, atopic conditions can be precipitated by a number of unrelated .timuli, whereas only the specific antigen can bring about anaphylaxis. Finally, the latter condiions may be produced artificially, but atopic disease with its spontaneous pattern of familial )ccurrence cannot be induced at will. Acute human pulmonary anaphylaxis, which can include tsthmatic features, for example, has never been reported to lead to the development of bronchial tsthma or atopic disease.",

In addition to animal models of anaphylaxis, there are a number of experimental models simulating human atopy as well as isolated systems suitable for studying segmented areas of atopic reactivity. As such, they are useful for the analysis of some of the individual events (i.e., mediator release in the human reaction). Nevertheless, these in vivo and in vitro models are anaphylactic variants and represent immunologically and pharmacologically normal reactivities.

Briefly, by electrolytic removal of one hypothalamic division or electric stimulation of the antagonistic division, it was possible to alter profoundly the anaphylactic reactivity of guinea pigs both immunologically and pharmacologically. From both the immunologic and pharmacologic standpoints, the conditions so produced more closely approximated those of the human atopic state than does anaphylaxis. Nevertheless, it was felt that the artificiality of such surgically induced hypothalamic imbalance is far removed from the natural setting, (involving various inherited or acquired factors or both) that may surround the development of an atopic state.

            "text": "Injection of live or killed Bordetella Pertussis organisms into certain strains of mice and rats modifies the normal reaction of these animals to a number of various stimuli. The possible applicability of the results of these investigations to atopy is implied by the following principal 68 features of the B. Pertussis induced altered responsiveness: l) hypersensitivity to endogenously released or exogenously administered histamine, serotonin, bradykinin, slow-reacting substance A, some prostaglandins, and at least in two strains, to acetylcholine; 2) hypersensitivity to less specific stimuli, such as cold, changes in atmospheric pressure, and respiratory irritants; 3) in contrast to these increased sensitivities, a reduced beta adrenergic sensitivity to catecholamines and concerning some metabolic parameters, a reversal of normal beta-adrenergic activity; 4) enhanced antibody formation in general (adjuvant activity) and facilitated production in quantity of antibodies of the IgE class; and 5) presence of a marked eosinophilia. As described by Szentivanyi, the major advance in these experiments that has paved the way for a meaningful analogy to atopic disorders has been the finding that hypersensitivity of the pertussis-sensitized mouse to pharmacologic mediators may be due to an acquired or genetically determined autonomic imbalance caused primarily by a reduced functioning of the adenylate cyclase coupled beta adrenergic receptors and the associated cyclic AMP system. This theory regarded those disorders (i.e., perennial and seasonal allergic rhinitis, bronchial asthma, and atopic dermatitis) not as immunologic diseases but as unique patterns of altered reactivities to a broad spectrum of immunologic, psychic, infectious, chemical and physical stimuli. This view gives to the antigen-antibody interaction the same role as that of a broad category of nonspecific stimuli that function only to trigger the same defective homeostatic mechanism in the various effector cells of the biochemical reaction sequence of immediate hypersensitivities.",

The theory postulated that the constitutional basis of atopy lies in the reduced function of the beta adrenergic effector system, irrespective of what the triggering event may chemically be in a particular case (e.g., immunologic, infectious, or psychic). In this situation, the adrenergic neurotransmitters are released in the face of relatively unresponsive beta-adrenergic effector system, and the resultant autonomic imbalance deprives the effector tissues of their normal counter regulatory adjustment.

A reduction in the normal beta adrenergic inhibition of lysosomal enzyme release, chemotaxis, phagocytosis, antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity, increased expression of FC IgE receptors, and prostaglandin E synthesis to stimulation with histamine-induced suppressor factor, that is effector mechanisms that are known to play an important role in immunologic inflammation. 2. A reduction in lymphocytic beta-adrenergic sensitivity resulting in abnormality decreased (lymphocyte transformation, E-rosette forming cells, T cells, suppressor cell function) and abnormally increased (IgE-producing B cells, Fc receptor-bearing lymphocytes) lymphocyte reactivities. 3. Mast cell mediator release to immunologic or non-immunologic stimuli, ordinarily suppressed by beta-adrenergic stimulation would become sub sensitive to the same, while both cholinergic and alpha-adrenergic enhancement of mediator release would be exaggerated. 4. Beta-adrenergically mediated bronchial smooth muscle dilation is reduced, while cholinergically and alpha-adrenergically mediated constriction is augmented. 5. Increased mucous secretion in response to alpha adrenergic and cholinergic stimulation, while sodium and water fluxes into tracheobronchial secretions in response to beta-adrenergic stimulation would be reduced. 6. The beta adrenergically mediated eosinopenia would be reduced and replaced by eosinophilia. All these theoretically predictable manifestations do in fact exist, and represent the cardinal features of atopic disease. Similarly, they all point to the most critical of the malfunctioning effectot system that is to the adenylate cyclase-coupled beta-adrenergic receptor and the associated cyclic nucleotide complex.

Since this bacterium was shown to produce in animal experiments [6] [7] [8] beta adrenergic impairment and/or an increased cyclic GMP level, the relationship between H. influenzae infection and the pharmacologic abnormality in asthma may be an authentic one.",

During the Asian Pandemic in the late 1950s severe exacerbations of bronchial asthma were found to be among the more frequent complications of this infection [9] . Since then numerous reports have appeared describing an important relationship between asthma and viral respiratory infection. Recent refinements in epidemiologic methods, microbiologic isolation techniques, and pulmonary function testing have provided new opportunities to characterize the relationship more precisely [10] A review of the available information indicates that: 1) experiments in animal models [ 11 ] and observations in children [ 12] suggest that the expression of atopy occurs during a period termed \"allergic breakthrough\" which may follow viral infections; 2) a history of childhood viral res-71 ,iratory illness is a risk factor for the development of chronic obstructive airway syndromes in ~ter life; 3) if such infection lead to obstructive airway disease, the resultant manifestation is kely to be a \"wheezy\" or asthmatic type of obstructive airway disease; 4) viral as opposed to acterial respiratory pathogens commonly herald the onset of wheezing in childhood and preispose to the development of atopy, although bronchial pharmacologic hyperreactivity after iral illness may also proceed independent of immunologic mechanisms in bronchospasm; and inally 5) no matter what the ultimate effect of respiratory infection in infancy on the subsequent evelopment of asthma may be, there is little doubt that respiratory viruses commonly induce xacerbations of bronchospasm in the older child, and adults with known asthma.",

For instance, adenoviruses herpes virus hominis, influenza Type B virus, and enteroviruses do not show a relationship to episodes of asthma [15, 16] . Studies of rhinovirus suggest that only a few rhinovirus subtypes are associated with asthmogenicity. This is a finding that is difficult to reconcile with the damaged epithelium hypothesis (assuming equivalence of infection) and raises the question of other possible mechanisms related to the biochemical properties of the virus [17,18]. )-Conversely, influenza Type A virus that is clearly associated with increased asthma [16] affects lung function largely through an effect on small ways [4] whereas the aforementioned rapidly adapting sensory irritant receptors are primarily distributed in the larger upper airways [ 19] . ) The hypothesis of a cholinergic hyperactivity as a consequence of epithelial damage presupposes the de facto presence of an active viral infection, which is the cause of the respiratory inflammation, leading to the disruption of the airway epithelial barrier and activating of the subepithelial rapidly adapting sensory irritant receptors.

            "text": "[20] has shown that IgE was bound to exfoliated nasopharyngeal epithelial cells in most patients during the acute phase of infection with respiratory syncytial virus. They also found that a continued presence of cell bound IgE was more common in patients with bronchiolitis or asthma than in those with mild upper respiratory tract infection. In this regard, it has been established in avian species that experimentally induced viral laryngotracheitis results in disruption of airway epithelium, with resultant increased permeation of horseradish peroxidase [21 ] and possibly increased uptake of inhaled antigens. Furthermore, Ida and associates [22] have demonstrated that interferon elaborated during viral infections from leukocytes harvested from patients with ragweed allergy may induce histamine release suggesting that atopic patients may experience bronchial hyperreactivity, if specific antigen exposure occurs at the time of viral infection. Under these circumstances, it is important to mention that evidence is available that actual respiratory infection with influenza Type A virus is not a necessary condition for the development of increased airway irritability in patients with asthma. Thus, administration of killed influenza virus vaccine to asthmatic patients caused a significant increase in bronchial sensitivity to methacholine aerosol, reaching a maximum after one day and persisting for three days [23] . Normal subjects did not develop the heightened response to methacholine, and no evidence of allergy to the vaccine was detected. These investigators suggested that the effect might be explained by an endotoxin-like action of influenza vaccine. Indeed, endotoxin sensitization of human bronchial smooth muscle to alpha-adrenergic agonists has been reported. Phenylephrine-induced contractions were enhanced two to ten times in normal lung and 1000 times in lungs from a patient with chronic bronchitis. Endotoxin also caused a decrease in cyclic AMP of the tissue [24]. These observations are complemented by recent findings obtained through vaccination with a purified LPS preparation from E. coli that resulted in a decreased number of beta-adrenergic receptors in guinea pig lung [25] . ) There are other observations calling into question the requirement of an active viral infection in the production of bronchial hyperactivity as mediated by cholinergically activated irritant receptors. Thus, pulmonary function abnormalities in adults with viral respiratory illness are generally more pronounced seven to ten days after the onset of symptoms, a time when the clinical manifestations and manifestations of viral inflammation are waning [26] . Also, the abnormalities of pulmonary function are generally prolonged well beyond what we now recognize as the period of viral shedding. Furthermore, administration of the antiviral agent, amantadine hydrochloride, although clinically effective, has no effect on the magnitude or duration of airway hyperactivity [27] ) In one longitudinal study, Minor et al. [16] found that simple colonization of the respiratory tract by virus was not sufficient to provoke asthma: such attacks occurred only when the infection produced symptoms of fever, malaise, cough or coryza. The dominant role of fever in these episodes immediately suggests the profound involvement of adrenergic effector mechanisms. Additional support for the important effect of viral infections on adrenergic mechanisms in asthmatic patients came from the extensive studies of Busse and his associates [ 18] . In their experiments human granulocytes served as a convenient in vitro model for the systematic study of virus incubation on the pharmacologic agonist response. At first, it was described [18] that an impairment of the inhibitory action of a beta adrenergic agonist (isoproterenol), normally observed on lysosomal enzyme release, occurred in granulocytes taken from asthmatic patients (lysosomal enzymes are known to play a major role in bronchial immunologic inflammation) [28] . The beta adrenergic impairment of lysosomal enzyme release was significantly greater if the cells were obtained during upper respiratory infection. Following these observations, Busse and colleagues have consistently reported virus-induced impairment of several neutrophil mechanisms, which normally mediate inhibition of enzyme release. Impairment occurred after incubation in vitro with live influenza virus [29] and with live rhinovirus 16 (RV 16) [30], a finding also observed following infection of normal sub-jects with RV 16 [31 ] . Both studies reported an impairment of the normal functioning of the beta adrenergic, histamine H 2 and PGE receptors, all responsible for inhibition of lysosomal enzyme release through stimulation of adenylate cyclase, resulting in cyclic AMP formation [32] . Interference with granulocyte beta-adrenergic receptor activity by influenza virus has subsequently been confirmed by Lee [33] and extended to include lymphocytes, resulting in decreased inhibition of E-Rosette formation to beta-adrenergic stimulation by isoproterenol. Another important study by Buckner et. al. [17] showed that parainfluenza 3-virus infection in vivo causes a selective blockade of the beta-adrenergic inhibition of antigen induced contraction of isolated airway smooth muscle. These abnormalities moreover are not limited to those with known atopy but may also be demonstrated in cell systems from normal subjects. Viral infections therefore, may have important inhibitory effects on beta-adrenergic responsiveness in the course of bronchoconstriction. This area has recently been extensively reviewed by Norris and Eyre [34]. Up to this point an analysis of the evidence against a parasympatheticlly (cholinergically) oriented virus induced asthmogenecity included arguments based on information obtained from the current state of our understanding of some aspects of virology, immunology, immunologic inflammation, and the cyclic nucleotide system. In the discussion below, these arguments will be extended to include some basic principles of neurophysiology and neuropharmacology, which also contradict the basic validity of the hypothesis of Nadel and his associates [ 14] .",

            "text": "For the purpose of establishing an appropriate framework for this discussion, the basic tenets for this hypothesis will be restated as follows. In the past two decades, Nadel, Boushey, Holtzman, and their associates have accumulated evidence indicating that stimulation of rapidly adapting epithelial nerve receptors of the airways by mechanical, chemical and pharmacologic stimuli, reflexly increases the output of acetylcholine by the vagus nerves, causing a reflex bronchoconstriction. In particular it was shown that, although histamine is capable of constricting airway smooth muscle directly, most of its bronchoconstrictor effect in vivo is indirect, and due to this reflex mechanism. This is accomplished both by direct stimulation of these epithelial receptors, and also by decreasing their firing threshold to other introduced stimuli. Thus, when histamine is injected into dog bronchial arteries, most of the airway constriction can be blocked by atropine. In otherwise healthy subjects, viral upper respiratory tract infections, through damage to the bronchial epithelium cause transient bronchial hyperactivity to inhaled histamine and citric acid, a phenomenon that is also abolished by anticholinergic drugs. On the basis of this and similar observations as well as the fact that bronchial hyperactivity is associated with a decrease in cough threshold, these workers suggested that airway epithelial damage with sensitization of airway nerve endings causes exaggerated cough and bronchomotor responses. With this background, Nadel, Boushey, Holtzman, and their associates, further postulated that bronchial asthma is a constellation involving two ingredients: release of pharmacologic mediators, and sensitization of airway epithelial nerve receptors providing a positive feedback system for increasing bronchomotor tone. This mechanism in fact probably contributes to the bronchial obstructive process in asthma. The altered pharmacologic reactivity in atopy, however, is not restricted to airway epithelial effectots, but it is a universal atopic trait. In fact, as explained earlier, the altered pharmacologic reactivity is the uniformly present, single atopic characteristic, which by its very nature must be explained by any theory attempting to elucidate the constitutional basis of atopy [3, 35, 36] . For the reasons below, cholinergic overactivity cannot serve in this capacity. Using spontaneously breathing, unanesthetized guinea pigs, it has been found that the vagal reflex component in histamine bronchoconstriction is small and probably a consequence rather than a cause of the constriction. In histamine-sensitive and histamine-insensitive strains of guinea pigs it has been demonstrated that the ease of in vivo histamine-induced reduction in lung compliance in the guinea pig is inversely related to its in vitro tracheal sensitivity to isoproterenol, revealing the primary homeostatic importance of the tracheobronchial beta-adrenergic receptors rather than that of cholinergic control, in determining the sensitivity of this effector tissue to histamine [37] [38] [39] . In harmony with these findings are the extensive studies carried out in humans in the past 20 years [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] [48] [49] . The most recent findings by O'Byrne et al. [50] further support the conclusions of these long series of observations indicating not only that blockade of the muscarinic cholinergic receptors has only a small effect on the response to inhaled histamine but also the observations that such a blockade elicits only a minor degree of protection against the response to inhaled allergen [46], exercise [44] and inhalation of cold air [48] in subjects with asthma. Taken together, these experiences indicate that the bronchial effect of histamine is exerted not by reflex bronchoconstriction but through stimulation of H~ receptors on airway smooth muscle. Therefore, hyper-responsiveness to histamine in asthma is not primarily caused by a defect in the parasympathetic nervous supply to the airway. Furthermore, no reproducible evidence of elevated levels of acetylcholine in tissues or body Fluids of atopic individuals is available. This, in fact, is not surprising when the issue of cholinergic overactivity is examined in the broader biologic context of the general nature of cholinergic versus adrenergic control. Thus, the sympathetic system is distributed to effectors through-3ut the body, whereas the parasympathetic distribution is much more limited. For instance, ~ympathetic postganglionic fibers also innervate smooth muscles and glands of somatic (non visceral) regions; no comparable distribution has been established for the parasympathetic division. Moreover, the sympathetic fibers ramify to a much greater extent, and their preganglionic Eerminals make contact with a large number of postganglionic neurons. In general, the ratio of ?reganglionic to postganglionic axons may be about 1:20 or more. In addition, there is an overlapping of synaptic innervation so that one ganglion cell is supplied by several pre-ganglionic fibers. By contrast, the parasympathetics are more discrete in their action, i.e., there is a closer Lo a 1:1 relation between pre-and postganglionic neurons [51] . Also the parasympathetic nerv-3us system has no reinforcing mechanism comparable to that of the adrenal medulla for the sympathetic division.",

Norepinephrine and epinephrine, therefore, are almost always released by the adrenal medulla at the same time that the different tissues are being stimulated directly by the sympathetic nerves. ~Fhe two means of stimulation support each other and either can actually substitute for the other. Without any stimulation, however, the normal resting rate of secretion by the adrenal medulla is sufficient to maintain blood pressure almost to normal even if all direct sympathetic pathways to the cardiovascular system are removed. Another important value of the adrenal medulla is the capability of catecholamines to stimulate structures of the body that are not innervated by sympathetic fibers. In contrast, the characteristics of parasympathetic reflexes are discrete. For instance, they usually act only on the heart to increase or decrease its activity, or frequently cause secretion only in the mouth or, in other instances, secretion only by the stomach glands.",

The principal evidence for this is the decay time of the end plate current, which is more rapid than diffusion of ACh out of a synaptic cleft would allow. Also, the most recent preparation of AChE hydrolyzed 960 nmoles ACh per mg of protein per hour, thus placing it among the enzymes having the highest turnover number that is known [51] . This powerful destructive capacity is reinforced by a battery of butyryl cholinesterases (\"pseudo\" or nonspecific cholinesterases), which destroy most of whatever acetylcholine may have escaped into the blood stream. Thus, it is doubtful whether acetylcholine can reach noninnervated cells or is present in the extracellular space in regulatory concentrations for cells with immunologic significance such as the antigen-sensitive lymphocytes. There is no comparable system of rapid destruction for the catecholamines, a fact that accounts in part for the widespread nature of sympathetic action.",

Thus, it was found that in normal subjects alpha-adrenergic stimulations with norepinephrine plus propranolol, and cholinergic stimulation with acetylcholine evoked significant increases in cyclic GMP formation. In contrast, the lymphocytic guanylate cyclase activity did not show a significant response to the same agents in patients with acute asthma, but the normal guanylate cyclase responsiveness was found to be partially restored in patients in remission [52] . Similarly, Lang, Goel, and Greico[53], in their study on adrenergic and cholinergic responses of peripheral lymphocytes in the \"active\" E rosette assay, demonstrated not only a subsensitivity of T lymphocytes to beta adrenergic but also to cholinergic stimulation in patients with bronchial asthma. In the same experiments, phenylephrine, an alpha-adrenergic agonist, showed no difference between the normal and asthmatic groups in enhancing the \"active\" E rosette formation. A subsensitive beta adrenergic and cholinergic system with a normal alpha adrenergic effector system may produce a state of relatively enhanced alpha adrenergic activity, a circumstance which may explain some of the findings showing that by giving alpha receptor blockers one can restore beta adrenergic responsiveness toward normal in lymphocytes of asthmatics [54, 55] . There are additionally at least three major arguments against cholinergic overactivity as the primary mechanism of atopy. First, neither pulmonary sympathectomy nor pulmonary vagotomy produces any lasting improvement in bronchial asthma. Second, as discussed in detail elsewhere [3, 35, 36] it is never the excessive presence of a neurohumor, but if anything, it is its prolonged lack that is likely to result in the development of chronic effector hypersensitivities. Consequently, it is inconceivable that cholinergic overactivity could produce a hypersensitivity to acetylcholine or similar mediators of immediate hypersensitivities. On the contrary, cholinergic overactivity would be expected to lead to desensitization of the cholinergic receptors, as has been extensively demonstrated in numerous preparations such as the skeletal muscles of the frog, the hearts of vertebrates and invertebrates, the Renshaw cells, the neurons of mollusks, etc.",

Using H3-quinuclidinyl benzilate, a stereospecific radioligand for muscarinic cholinergic receptors a significant reduction in receptor density was found in the lung preparations of asthmatics, and no difference in the numbers of such receptors in lung specimens derived from the non-reversibly obstructed and non-obstructed groups as shown by Szentivanyi et a1. [57] . An important question of course is how can one possibly find a reduction in the number of muscarinic cholinergic receptors in lung membranes derived from patients with reversible obstruction (asthma) in the simultaneous presence of an exquisite bronchial hyperreactivity to cholinergic agents? At the time of this writing, we can only offer two possible interpretations. One is that the bronchial hyperreactivity to cholinergic agents in asthma is not mediated through cholinergic mechanisms, but is basically due to the beta adrenergic abnormality, which is also responsible for the atopic feature of the disease. The second possibility is that :he reduction in muscarinic receptor densities is caused by a heightened vagus activity resulting in a cholinergic \"downturn\" and ultimately producing a pharmacological \"denervation supersensitivity\" to cholinergic agents [51, 58] . Whether one or the other, or both of these interpretations will prove to be correct, it is evident that they represent important evidence against the validity 3f Nadel's [ 14] reflex hypothesis of the virally induced mechanisms of bronchoconstriction in asthma. Finally, if the atopic state were to be due to cholinergic overactivity produced by viruses Lhrough the postulated reflex mechanisms, then anticholinergic agents should have a far more Jemonstrable therapeutic effect than what we are able to observe in asthma [40-42,44] let the 3ther atopic conditions were they are useless.",

Other viruses associated with this disease include herpes zoster, vaccinia, warts, and molluscum contagiosum. While it has long been known that recurrent viral cutaneous infections are more prevalent in atopic dermatitis, there is now growing evidence for recurrent cold sores and upper respiratory infections in this condition. Serological studies have also revealed that atopic dermatitis patients display significantly higher serum levels of antibodies against Epstein Barr virus (EBV) than their non-atopic controls.

In the context of the T cell, therefore, it is important to focus our interest on the gene products, primarily enzymes that affect T cell maturation or function in atopic dermatitis. For the first time in 1982, it has been reported that the activity of lymphocytic cyclic AMP-phosphodiesterase (that is the enzyme that destroys cyclic AMP) is increased in atopic dermatitis as well as allergic respiratory disease of adults [69] , and that this increased activity correlated closely with histamine release from basophi|s [70] . When the same enzymatic activity together with histamine release was investigated in the newborn using umbilical cord blood, the significant elevation of phosphodiesterase activity was reconfirmed in newborns with a positive atopic history in first-degree relatives, compared to newborns with a negative history. In contrast to adults, however, there was no correlation between phosphodiesterase activity and histamine release [71 ] . Elevation of cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase activity in cord blood leukocytes before the development of clinical manifestations of atopy strongly suggests that increased cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase activity plays a primary role in the pathogenesis of atopic disease. The lack of correlation between phosphodiesterase activity and histamine release in neonates further suggests that elevated cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase activity is a primary, genetically linked defect rather than secondary to in vivo desensitization by inflammatory mediators such as histamine and prostaglandin E 1 [72].",

Following the publication of the original beta-adrenergic theory by Szentivanyi, [ 1 ] , a series of experiments have been carried out to examine the applicability of this theory to atopic dermatitis. Studies of peripheral blood leukocytes and lymphocytes in atopic dermatitis have frequently demonstrated impaired beta adrenergic reactivity as revealed by a loss of regulatory effects on lysosomal enzyme secretion [73, 74] , by reduced formation of cyclic AMP to beta adrenergic stimulation [74] [75] [76] , by decreased affinity of binding for radio-labeled beta-adrenoceptor agonists [77] and by a shift in the numbers of beta adrenergic receptors to alpha adrenergic receptors resulting in an increased ratio of alpha to beta binding sites [4, 78] . More recently, Hannifin has made an extensive effort with his group to determine the lymphocyte and monocyte localization of altered adrenergic receptors, cyclic AMP responses, and cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase in atopic dermatitis [79] [80] [81] [82] [83] [84] .",

Unfractionated atopic mononuclear leukocytes showed reduced numbers of beta adrenergic receptors per cell together with the absence of a normal, lower affinity subpopulation of high affinity beta receptors. This resulted in a linear Scatchard plot of beta adrenergic binding to mononuclear-leukocytes from atopic patients, instead of the biphasic plot seen in normal control cells. These alterations of surface receptors for cyclic AMP-elevating ligands were localized to T cells and monocytes of patients with atopic dermatitis, whereas atopic B-cell receptor numbers and affinities were identical to those of normal B-cells [79, 80] . Of the various subpopulations of T-cells, a lymphocyte subset which is activatable by self Ia-antigen (MHC-II) bearing presenting monocytic ceils, has been identified as radiosensitive (functionally dependent upon a proliferative step) OKT4 +, T29 + helper/inducer T cell [85] [86] [87] . A primary abnormality in the numbers and/or in the intracellular regulation of the cyclic AMP system of the radiosensitive, T29 +, helper/inducer T-cells generated by the interaction with autologous Ia antigen presenting macrophages may explain many of the characteristic features of immune dysfunction in atopic dermatitis [81 ] .",

Development of the pool of blood PWM-recruitable B-cells for in vitro antibody production requires induction by a radiosensitive T-cell inducer [85, 90, 91] , and indeed, B-cells from patients with atopic dermatitis demonstrate decreased mitogen-stimulated antibody secretion, even when corrected for number or when normal T-cells are used to provide helper function [92] . T-cells associated with suppressor and cytotoxic functions, such as T-cells with FcIgG receptors, OKT8 cells and histamine Hz-receptor-bearing T-cells often show significantly reduced values in patients with atopic dermatitis [87,92-94], which is in accord with findings indicating that the development of mature suppressor and cytotoxic effector T cells requires induction by the aforementioned radiosensitive T-helper cells [95] [96] [97] . It may be added that the development of cytoxic T lymphocytes is known to be dependent upon Ia + monocyte stimulation of helper T-cell factors such as interleukin-2 [95], and a decrease in the production of interleukin 2 as well as interferon by these abnormal helper/inducer T-cells, or their altered ability to respond to these signals may explain the reduced natural killer activity in atopic dermatitis [67] . Thus, the aforementioned multiple abnormalities of the cyclic AMP system in the helper/inducer T-cells in question may account for the immune dysfunction in atopic dermatitis.

As stated above, the demonstration of higher serum levels of antibodies against EBV in atopic dermatitis were interpreted in support of the assumption that defective immune mechanisms rather than cutaneous alterations predispose for increased susceptibility to viral infections. Although the findings of raised EBV antibody titers in atopic dermatitis may in fact reflect on abnormal host response to the virus, it cannot be excluded that the cause and effect relationship is the reverse, so that EBV may play a causative role for the development of atopic dermatitis. Thus, EBV is a B-cell mitogen, which may stimulate IgE antibody formation, and infectious mononucleosis, which is caused by EBV, is associated with raised serum levels of IgE [98] . The report of a case of atopic dermatitis developing soon after an episode of infectious mononucleosis suggests that EBV may in fact occasionally precipitate atopic disease [99] . Essentially the same causative role of viral agents has been described for respiratory atopy above.",

Advances in knowledge of the immune response and immune reactivity achieved since the early 1960's have been accompanied by a more complete understanding of the different pathways of immune tissue injury. Based on this new understanding, the various types of immunopathologic processes have been subdivided by the classification by Coombs and Cell (1962) into the following four basic types: Type I: Immediate-hypersensitivities Type II: Cytotoxic tissue injury Type III: Immune-complex tissue injury Type IV: Cell-mediated immune tissue injuries This classification is oversimplified because of the complex interrelationships that exist between the several events that constitute an inflammatory response. Nevertheless, this view represents the closest approximation of the various basic patterns of immune tissue injury, and the classification does not depend on the host species or on the method of antigen exposure. Another valuable feature of the classification is its integrated emphasis on the important central point that in these various patterns of immune injury the tissue damage results from the immune activation of cellular and biochemical mediator systems of the host. The combination of the immune reactants produces only minimal direct effects, but as a trigger mechanism it sets the destructive factors into play.",

The attachment occurs through a structural area in the Fc part of the antibody molecule to a specific receptor on the basophil or mast cell membrane. Although evidence indicates that subpopulations of monocytes, macrophages, and lymphocytes also express Fc receptors for IgE antibody, of all mammalian cells only basophils and mast cells exhibit an extraordinary binding affinity for this antibody. There is a relative abundance of these IgE molecules bound along the membrane, and they are located close to each other physically. When the IgE becomes attached, the cells are said to be sensitized, and the individual is now in a sensitive state for reactivity on subsequent exposure to the antigen [ 100] .",

The antigen must move across membrane and tissue barriers in order to come to the surface of the sensitized cells. When this close encounter occurs with an antigen of sufficient size to react with the antigen-binding sites of two closely adjacent IgE molecules, it produces a \"bridging' effect. In this molecular interaction, one antigen molecule combines with two antibody molecules to form a bridge. This bridging brings together two IgE receptor molecules, which results in coformational changes in the receptors, triggering an enzymatic cascade that causes the release of pharmacologically active effector molecules responsible for the clinical symptomatology of immediate hypersensitivities.

The second conclusion is based on the observation that methylxnthine also inhibit immunologic release of histamine [ 104] . Thus, when ragweed antigen was nade to interact in vitro with IgE antibody on the surface of leukocytes from ragweed-sensiive human donors, both methylxanthines and catecholamines inhibited histamine release. The ignificance of these findings is seen in the fact that methylxanthines are competitive inhibitors if the specific phosphodiesterase that inactivates cyclic 3', 5' AMP; and thereby they may induce 'adrenergic action\" by increasing the intracellular concentration of the compound. Indeed, cat-,cholamines and methylxanthines were found to act synergistically in inhibiting histamine elease, and the phosphodiesterase-inhibitory potencies of the various methylxanthines corelated well with their inhibitory effects on histamine release [3] . Of further significance is the act that the methylxanthines and catecholamines were shown to inhibit only if added to the cells vhen antigen was present; they had no effect if removed from the environment of the sensitized :ells before antigen exposure [ 104] . The adenylate cyclase system therefore must be considered Ls a critical regulatory system in allergic histamine release.",

            "text": "In addition to beta-adrenergic agents, allergic release of histamine or of other pharmacologic nediators of immediate hypersensitivity is also inhibited by prostaglandins of the E series, ~rostacycline, adenosine, and histamine (i.e., by substances that interact with cell membrane eceptors that activate adenylate cyclase [105, 106] . Inhibition of allergic mediator release by hese agents is generally paralleled by an increase in the intracellular concentration of cyclic kMP in the respective cell preparations. Furthermore, since the release-inhibitory activities of hese agents are blocked by their specific antagonists, it is presumed that these agents increase :yclic AMP by acting on receptors linked to adenylate cyclase. The mechanism by which cyclic AMP blocks mediator release is not known, but current evidence suggests that cyclic AMP acts early in the release process, that it is linked to the obligatory inward flux of calcium, and that it related to microtubule function [107] . There are, however, exceptions when changes in cyclic nucleotide levels do not correlate with inhibition of immunologic mediator release [7, 108] . The nature of such dissociation between cyclic AMP elevation and inhibition is unclear but may be explained if there are functionally separate intracellular cyclic AMP pools [ 109] and if a product of the lipoxygenase or some other pathway can block selectively a biochemical sequence linking adenylate cyclase activation to inhibition of mediator release [ 107] . The effect of changes in intracellular cyclic GMP levels on allergic mediator release has been less extensively studied. In lung tissue, alpha-adrenergic and cholinergic stimulation increase cyclic GMP levels [110 111 ] , and such effects as well as extracellular cyclic GMP derivatives potentiate antigen-induced mediator release [112] . However, cyclic GMP does not enhance release from rat mast cells and has minimal or no effect on immunologic mediator release from basophils [ 113] . Furthermore, it is not known whether cyclic GMP-induced enhancement of pulmonary mediator release is a direct effect of alpha-adrenergic or cholinergic agents on the mast cells or whether it reflects their actions on other cell types [57] . Nevertheless, in this context it may be added that pertussis or pharmacologically established beta-adrenergic blockade has been reported to cause peritoneal mast cell degranulation in rats and mice, whereas beta-adrenergic stimulation protects these cells against propranolol induced degranulation [ 114] . As judged by the PCA reaction in guinea pigs, propranolol has the same enhancing effect on immunologic mediator release [ 115] .",

First of all endogenous catecholamines released from neuronal and adrenal medullary catechol stores would be expected to desensitize both alpha-and beta-adrenoceptors more or less evenly. In the foregoing studies alpha-adrenoceptor concentrations or their sensitivities were not measured, but in those studies where they were, this was not the case. Thus, pulmonary homogenates of sensitized guinea pigs that had been exposed chronically to antigen aerosol showed significant increase in alpha-adrenoceptors and a decrease in beta-adrenoceptors [118] reminiscent of the reciprocal adrenoceptor changes observed in a number of other human and animal studies described in the literature [121] [122] [123] [124] [125] . This alpha dominance is also reflected by the demonstration that alpha-adrenergic agonists produce bronchoconstriction in asthmatic patients but not in normal subjects [ 126, 127] . Similarly, in vitro studies show alpha-receptor mediated constriction of bronchial smooth muscle from patients with increased airways resistance but not from normal controls [24, 128] . In addition, increased alpha-adrenergic receptor mediated responses in vascular and pupillary smooth muscles have been reported in asthmatics [ 129] .",

This is also reflected by the presence of beta-adrenergic subsensitivity in atopic dermatitis in which beta-adrenergic medication is not used as a therapeutic modality. Nevertheless, endogenous release of catecholamines in response to the allergic tissue injury may contribute to the development of beta-adrenergic subsensitivity through homologous desensitization of the beta-adrenergic receptors. At the same time the endogenous release of other pharmacologic mediators (i.e., histamine) in response to the allergic tissue injury may contribute to the beta-adrenergic subsensitivity through heterologous desensitization [36] .

            "text": "THE ALLERGIC TISSUE INJURY, BETA ADRENERGIC SUBSENSITIVITY, AND ATOPIC DERMATITIS Differences between homologous and heterologous desensitization resulting in beta-adrenergic subsensitivity could be most conveniently explained through the model of Delean and associates [ 130] originally used for the interpretation of adrenoceptor-adenylate cyclase interactions and based to a large extent on ligand binding experiments. This model envisions three principal components of the system in the plasma membrane, i.e., the receptor (R), a nucleotide-binding regulatory protein (N), and adenylate cyclase (C). The binding of an agonist (A) to the receptor is believed to bring about a change that either promotes or stabilizes the formation of a ternary complex, ARN. The formation of the complex promotes the dislodging of a tightly bound guanosine diphosphate (GDP) molecule from N and its replacement with guanosine triphosphate (GTP), which enables N to activate C, thus stimulating the formation of cAME The GTP is subsequently hydrolyzed to GDP by guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) associated with N, and this leads to inactivation of the cyclase. All three components of the system are then capable of being reactivated by renewed interactions of R with agonist molecules. The formation of the ternary complex ARN is of crucial importance to the functional coupling of the receptor to the cyclase in this hypothetical model. Antagonists occupy the receptor but do not promote or stabilize the formation of the ternary complex and thus do not activate the catalytic moiety of adenylate cyclase. Biochemical experiments indicate that the free form of the receptor (R) has a low affinity for agonists, while the complex of the receptor plus the nucleotide protein (RN) has a high affinity for agonists. Changes in receptor binding properties showing a lack of high affinity of R for agonists are thus believed to indicate that the crucial ARN complex is not formed. Not surprisingly, there is no activation of the cyclase under these circumstances. This phenomenon resulting in the inability of agonist-stimulated beta-receptors to activate adenylate cyclase is referred to as uncoupling. As discussed below, uncoupling is one of the mechanisms by which agonist--induced desensitization of beta-adrenergic receptors take place [ 131 ] . The loss of a tissue's responsiveness to an agonist caused by repeated exposure to the agonist has been described using a variety of terms including desensitization, tolerance, refractoriness, and tachyphylaxis. Su and colleagues [132] have divided these phenomena into two major categories, heterologous and homologous desensitization. Heterologous desensitization refers to the desensitization that occurs after exposure of cells to a biologically active agent that produces tissue refractoriness to itself and to a variety of other pharmacologically different agonists. By contrast, homologous or agonist--specific desensitization is a loss of responsiveness to only the particular agonist that induced the desensitization (or to a specific group of pharmacologically related agonists, all acting at the same tissue receptor site, e.g., the catecholamines).",

There is no decrease in receptor number in the isoproterenol-desensitized turkey erythrocyte, but rather an apparent uncoupling of the beta-adrenergic receptor from adenylate cyclase takes place due to impairment of the ability of occupied receptors to form a stable high-affinity ARN complex [133] . Similar refractoriness can be produced by exposure of the cells to 8-bromo-adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate, a cAMP analog, suggesting that the desensitization to isoproterenol is caused by the agonist-stimulated levels of cAMP within cells. Stadel and co-workers [133] suggested that cAMP-dependent phosphorylation of the nucleotide regulatory protein (N) may be the mechanism of desensitization in this system, and thus no alteration in the receptor per se but rather uncoupling of the receptor from adenylate cyclase due to modification of the nucleotide regulatory protein takes place in this example of heterologous desensitization.",

As stated earlier, in addition to beta adrenergic agents, allergic release of histamine or of many, if not most of other pharmacologic mediators of immediate hypersensitivities, is also inhibited by prostaglandins of the E series, prostacycline, adenosine, and histamine (i.e., by substances that interact with cell membrane receptors that activate adenylate cyclase). Normal physiologic inhibition of allergic mediator release by these agents is kept in check by their feedback effect on their respective receptors through the mechanisms of homologous and heterologous desensitization. In atopic disease, however, where there are multiple abnormalities in the receptor-adenylate cyclase-and cyclic AMP systems, this physiologic balance between inhibition versus enhancement of mediator release would be expected to lead to an exaggerated release reaction to the allergic tissue injury. Indeed, enhanced \"releasability\" of histamine from basophils and mast cells has been shown to occur in atopic dermatitis. \"Releasability\" is defined in this context as the capacity of mediator secreting cells to release preformed or newly synthesized mediators [139] [140] [141] . Among the pharmacologic mediators, histamine is the best-studied substance, and the best-established mechanism is the IgE-mediated release reaction. The first study to show enhanced anti-IgE induced histamine releasability from basophils was performed by Lebel et al. [142] , which was confirmed by Ring and his associates [130] . During the last few years numerous, more extensive investigations have been carried out that further confirmed the de facto existence of altered releasability in atopic dermatitis [71, [144] [145] [146] . Similarly, increased releasability of histamine was also found to occur in bronchial asthma [147, 148] .",

It is generally assumed that isotype specific suppressor and helper T-cells play an important role, but the relevant subpopulation (perhaps FcE-receptor bearing lymphocytes, [152] ), is not known at present.

Thus, the foregoing diseases may be viewed as receptor diseases, and some subsets of asthma and other atopic diseases may ultimately be recognized as legitimate members of this group. Indeed, it has been described that autoantibodies to beta adrenoceptors can be identified in the plasma of some subjects with atopic allergy [165] [166] [167] . Although these antibodies appear to be heterogeneous, they share the ability to affect binding of 125I protein A to calf lung membranes, to inhibit stereospecific beta-adrenergic radioligand binding to calf lung beta 2 adrenoceptors, and to precipitate solubilized calf lung beta-adrenergic receptors in an indirect immunoprecipitation assay. Furthermore, the presence of autoantibodies to betaz-adrenoceptors in these subjects correlates well with a reduced beta 2 and an increased alpha-adrenergic responsiveness.",

For a general account of the molecular mechanisms that are involved in the development of autoimmunities in general, the reader is referred to an analysis by Szentivanyi and Szentivanyi [ 100] . In the orientation of this chapter, however, we shall only mention the role of virus infections as a developmental-mechanism of autoimmunity produced by anti-receptor antibodies specifically directed to beta adrenoceptors. Thus, virus infections can elicit autoantibody formation by two mechanisms. First, the viral antigens and autoantigens may become associated to form immunogenic units. Viral antigens stimulating host T-lymphocytes could then function as helper determinants, thereby stimulating B-lymphocyte responses to auto-antigens. Second, some viruses such as the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) stimulate proliferation of the B-lymphocyte cell line with autoantibody production. There are two ways in which viral and host antigens can form immunogenic units. Host antigens can be incorporated in the envelopes of some viruses, and viral antigens can appear on the surfaces of infected host cells [100] . The viral antigens also may form complexes with and modify histocompatibility antigens or other membrane constituents such as the contractile protein, actin. The modified viral antigens could stimulate T-cell helper effect and elicit autoantibody formation [ 100] .",

Following infectious mononucleosis, many patients' sera often react against several autoantigens. These include autoantibodies against nuclei, lymphocytes, erythrocytes, and smooth muscle. In addition, cross-reactive heterophile antibodies may be noted following infectious mononucleosis and other infections.
