The analyses of 10 bovine and human ICV matrix gene sequences were carried out by using CLC Genomic Workbench version 9.0.1 (CLC bio, Boston, MA, USA) to generate a multiple sequence alignment. BioEdit version 7.2.5 (https://www.bioedit.com/) was used to generate a sequence identity table.",

The alignment length was trimmed to 559 bp. The evolutionary history was inferred by using the maximum likelihood method on the basis of the Jukes-Cantor model (4) with 1,000 bootstrap replicates (5) . Initial trees for the heuristic search were obtained automatically by applying the Neighbor-Join and BioNJ algorithms to a matrix of pairwise distances estimated by using the maximum composite likelihood approach and then selecting the topology with the superior log likelihood value.",

(Coralville, IA, USA). In silico analysis indicated that the 2 sets of assays covered 195 of 196 bp (99.5%) of the complete and near-complete ICV matrix gene sequences available. We performed real-time reverse RT-PCR tests using a 20-\u00b5L reaction volume (0.4 \u00b5M forward and reverse primers, 0.2 \u00b5M probe, 3 \u00b5L template nucleic acid, 2 \u00b5L 10\uf0b4 Multiplex Enzyme Mix, and 10 \u00b5L 2\u00d7 Multiplex RT-PCR Buffer) and the Path-ID Multiplex One-Step RT-PCR Kit (Applied Biosystems, Grand Island, NY, USA). The thermocycling parameters included a RT step at 48\u00b0C for 10 min and RT inactivation and denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 10 min, followed by 45 cycles of denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 15 sec and annealing and extension at 60\u00b0C for 45 sec. The cycle threshold was determined with the CFX96 Touch Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) and analyzed by using Bio-Rad CFX Manager 3 software.Partial Matrix Gene Sequencing of ICV-Positive Samples and Complete GenomeSequencing of Sample ICV12A pair of sequencing primers flanking the real-time PCR target were designed to amplify a 590bp fragment of ICV matrix gene for Sanger sequencing confirmation of PCR-positive samples. The primer sequences were ICV-cF (5\u2032-AAAGCCAGCACAGCAATGAA-3\u2032) and ICV-cR (5\u2032-TCAAAAATACCATCATTGGAAAAAGG-3\u2032). The ICV matrix gene fragment was amplified by using LA Taq PCR Kit (TaKaRa, Mountain View, CA, USA) from cDNA synthesized with the SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis Supermix Kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). PCR products were sequenced by an outsourced sequencing facility (Genewiz, South Plainfield, NJ, USA). Sample ICV12 was selected for complete genome sequencing as previously described(1,2).",
