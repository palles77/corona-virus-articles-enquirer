Screening syphilis during pregnancy is an example of this approach, as missing maternal syphilis can lead to stillbirths, preterm birth and congenital syphilis in a third of pregnant women compared to the harm of overtreatment with a single dose of penicillin 5 .",

            "text": "Since 2003, several diagnostic tests that satisfy (or nearly satisfy) the ASSURED criteria have been developed to identify major human pathogens. This includes tests for HIV, malaria, syphilis and TB ( Table 1) . The HIV rapid test is the first test to fulfil the ASSURED criteria, followed closely by the malaria and syphilis rapid tests and, recently, a near-POC test for TB. Much of this development was the result of advocacy by donors such as the Bill & Melinda Gates HIV RDTs. Early detection of HIV infection has been a critical component of HIV control programmes worldwide since the early days of the epidemic. Since most infected individuals do not show specific symptoms and the period of viraemia is short, screening for HIV antibodies in blood as a marker of exposure has been the most cost-effective means of identifying infected individuals. The WHO developed a process and criteria for validating the performance of HIV antibody detection assays more than a decade ago and showed that HIV RDTs using finger-pricked whole-blood specimens has acceptable performance compared to laboratory-based immunoassays 12, 13 . Many donors -for example, Global Fund and implementation partners, including the WHO, UNAIDS and PEPFAR -have helped affected countries with the procurement and introduction of rapid HIV tests and enable early detection and prevent onward transmission. As a result of funding from donors, increased accessibility of RDTs, and the 'architecture' provided by national HIV/ AIDS control programmes, HIV tests successfully reached as many as 150 million children and adults in 129 low-and middle-income countries in 2014 (ref. 14 ) . Two major challenges remain: training and quality assurance. With thousands of POC testing sites across a country, even the most well-organized control programmes would find it difficult to provide adequate training on an ongoing basis. This problem is most acute in health facilities where there is high turnover of staff. The US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has developed a convenient means of external quality assurance by working with countries to generate thermally stable proficiency panels that can be shipped to every POC testing site to ensure competence of testing personnel. However, a study in South Africa found that only 3% of HIV RDTs were performed correctly 15 . Although not every error will result in an incorrect diagnosis, the alarming reality is that with 150 million tests being performed annually worldwide, assuming a 99% accuracy rate, as many as 1.5 million incorrect results per year could potentially be generated. Ongoing quality assurance efforts include developing key policy and quality documents for the implementation of HIV-related POC testing 16 . For example, as POC technologies for HIV viral load and early infant diagnosis were being developed, there was tremendous emphasis on quality, given the complexity of the test and lessons learned from HIV RDTs.",

While microscopic identification of parasites in blood smears has been the traditional means of diagnosing malaria in patients presenting with fever, microscopy requires equipment, a source of electricity and trained laboratory technicians. Malaria RDTs were developed as many rural communities lack these resources, and to date there are over 120 brands of malaria RDTs made by approximately 60 companies 17 , which vary widely in performance, manufacturing quality and price. The WHO has set up a pre-qualification programme with the CDC and the Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics to evaluate these tests to inform test selection and procurement for national malaria control programmes 17 . In countries that permit the sale of malaria RDTs and medicines over the counter, the quality of these commodities cannot be guaranteed. The price of most RDT brands is between US$0.65 and US$2.50 per test 7, 18 , and as with all diagnostics, it is important to caution that price pressure will ultimately affect quality. As with HIV, with the support of donors, selection of high-quality RDTs and the architecture provided by national malaria control programmes, malaria RDTs have reached millions of patients every year. This promising trend, coupled with the effectiveness of bednets for preventing transmission, has led to the call for malaria elimination in many parts of the world 19 .",

Also, the problems of providing adequate training and quality assurance of malaria tests and testing at remote POC sites are similar to those described for HIV RDTs 21, 22 .",

Countries need to harness the architecture provided by HIV PMTCT programmes to screen women for both infections using a single drop of blood in a single visit to a health care facility. Dual rapid HIV-syphilis RDTs with acceptable performance are now available 36 and the WHO, as well as many countries, has adopted these HIV and/or syphilis RDTs into their national guidelines 31, 37 .",

            "text": "Antigen detection POC tests, such as those for chlamydia and gonorrhoea, suffer from three major drawbacks (Table 2) . First, the specimen used for sexually transmitted infections are usually from urethral, cervical or vaginal swabs that require multiple steps to solubilize the bacteria and free antigen before reaction with the capture antibody. This sometimes requires a heating step and adds to the complexity and cost of the POC test. Urine is the preferred specimen in men with such infections, and current POC tests require a urine centrifugation step to concentrate the bacteria before processing and reaction. Another common drawback of antigen detection tests is the potential for false positive results due to cross-reactivity with antigens from closely related bacterial or viral species. This is especially true if polyclonal antibodies are used as capture antibodies. Finally, a common disadvantage of current antigen detection POC assays is low sensitivity, often requiring 10 4 to 10 5 bacteria for the RDT to become positive. Malaria RDTs are an exception to these drawbacks in that the parasites are present in large quantities in blood and no pre-processing or concentration steps are required. For most antigen detection POC tests, the low sensitivity may be due to low concentration of target antigens, inefficiency of extraction or limited optimization of reagents, which has hampered chlamydia and gonorrhoea tests 52, 53 . However, Gift et al. showed that rapid chlamydia tests with a sensitivity of 65% can lead to more infected patients being treated compared to NATs, which require patients to return for their test results 54 . They called this the rapid test paradox, which was also recently seen with a p24 assay for early infant diagnosis of HIV, where a sensitivity of 72% can still lead to a higher 'diagnostic yield' than NATs performed on dried blood spots sent from remote antenatal clinics 55 .",

For example, the near-POC TB diagnostic involves primer-based amplification of MTB DNA specifically, including regions associated with RIF drug resistance. Thus, NAT tests are generally highly sensitive and more specific than antigen-or antibody-based tests, and may help inform on drug susceptibilities. While instruments are available for highthroughput screening of patients and subsidies can bring test costs down to US$10, the equipment (capable of four tests at a time) costs more than US$10,000, which may be prohibitive in high-incidence regions. Thus, a truly POC diagnostic based on NATs without needing any equipment is still a promise and not a reality as yet 56, 57 . Of all the criteria originally accepted, the requirement of equipment-free is perhaps the only one which is not as critical as originally defined. A wide range of near-POC NATs have been developed for use outside of laboratory settings 58 and most of these assays are automated, requiring only 2-3 minutes of hands-on time and minimal training. These near-POC devices come in sealed units with internal self-calibration making it easier to ensure quality of testing and most are also equipped with data transmission capabilities, which make these platforms very attractive in the context of disease surveillance and epidemic preparedness. Most of these near-POC devices have a broad menu of diagnostic targets which makes the capital cost of purchasing the device less of an issue. Reagents are pre-measured and dried ready for hydration with the introduction of the specimen. However, near-POC NAT cartridges are expensive to manufacture and not affordable to most developing countries without subsidies.",

An analysis for syphilis screening compared the use of a laboratory-based immunoassay with treponemal RDTs in Tanzania 67 . It showed that a test that has 100% sensitivity but can only be used in sophisticated laboratories can realistically only be accessed by 30-40% of the population, while a rapid lateral flowbased antibody test that has only 90% sensitivity, but can be used at all levels of the health care system effectively gives a correct diagnosis to as many as 81% of the population, highlighting that tests should not be evaluated purely on technical performance, but rather on diagnostic performance and clinical impact.",

The value of a diagnostic goes beyond the technology, as each test needs to be matched to its 'testing environment' , which includes population characteristics, prevalence of target diseases, comorbidities/coinfections and health system characteristics. National programmes should take advantage of the rapid turnaround time of ASSURED tests to streamline patient pathways and increase the efficiency of the health care system. The roll-out of POC diagnostics requires the use of implementation science to ensure success 71 , taking into account the cultural, behavioural, socioeconomic and health systems contexts. This includes a careful assessment of acceptability and feasibility linked to possible increased stresses on the health system/provider when testing is introduced into settings where thus far no or limited testing was performed. Studies using the GeneXpert MTB/RIF TB test showed that new diagnostic tests would not have the expected impact on outcomes if test introduction is not accompanied by changes in patient pathways or practices 72, 73 . These studies highlight the importance of programmatic monitoring of the impact of novel technologies beyond studies that are usually conducted under controlled conditions. Likewise, same-day testing and treatment using a syphilis RDT strengthened health systems in the Amazon forest and rural China when policy makers were involved and testing was introduced within the appropriate social and cultural contexts 71, 74 . For example, in Peru, women normally need to present six times to the largest maternal hospital in Lima for their prenatal syphilis screening to be completed and treatment provided, but the introduction of the rapid syphilis test streamlined testing and treatment to one visit, reducing patient out-of-pocket expenses and increasing the efficiency of a busy health care facility 75 .",

One solution would be to allow the analysis of test results at a centralized level for consistent diagnosis and epidemiological surveillance. Many manufacturers are now embedding connectivity into POC and near-POC instruments (for example, the Alere Pima POC CD4 device 87 ). Other manufacturers have developed innovative connectivity solutions that can use mobile phones to read the results from lateral flow assays and provide electronic result exchange, while a third option would be to include connectivity directly onto the test 88 . Ideally, connectivity should not only include collection and transmission of test data, but also analysis to provide feedback for immediate patient treatment or for surveillance. With the addition of barcodes, two-dimensional codes or electronic storage into tests, a number of other data points can be collected, including manufacturing information (for example, lot numbers), dates, expiry dates, stock availability and possibly even environmental conditions such as temperature and humidity under which the tests have been manufactured, transported, stored and used. For instrumented tests, maintenance and other machine data can be collected. Thus, connectivity solutions can increase quality assurance for POC tests and would allow for centralized and real-time decision-making, even across tiered laboratory systems and during outbreak investigations and global health emergencies. Moving forward, it is critically important to make provisions for poor or non-existent internet availability to support sustainability standards and that systems are developed with compatibility so that they can be linked into central databases.",

Recyclable materials should be used, when possible, for the housing, substrate matrix materials, and reagents used in tests. Paper, an obvious choice of substrate material that has many inherent advantages over standard plastic materials, will see increased usage, not only in lateral flow formats but other paper based formats as well such as in micro paperbased analytical devices (\u03bc PADs) [90] [91] [92] . And recently, cell-free synthetic gene networks for in vitro applications at POC, have been achieved by freeze-drying cell-free systems onto paper, which increases stability at room temperature and can be easily transported and stored, and simply re-activated by adding water 93 . Other factors also need to be considered, such as disposal of test reagents, clinical samples and materials used for active components such as electronic tracks and electrodes.",

            "text": "The ASSURED criteria have been a valuable framework for developing devices and methods to detect major human diseases in challenging POC contexts. However, over the last decade, new technologies, not envisaged or available at the time of the first ASSURED criteria definition, have given rise to the possibility of including new considerations into the next generation of devices and tests. We propose the acronym REASSURED for the design of future diagnostic tests to address important priorities such as global health emergencies and AMR. An ideal test would be one that combines the best of both existing diagnostic worlds (instrumented laboratory based tests with lateral flow tests) and technologies currently being developed (Fig. 2) , which would provide an important extension to diagnostic laboratory systems and fulfil the Sustainable Development Goals of 'no one left behind' in terms of effective health care service delivery. Such tests can only be created by forming strong collaborative partnerships across many disciplinary boundaries, and we look toward a future when data connectivity linking cost-effective ASSURED diagnostics to laboratory systems will form the backbone of health care systems and provide real-time data for evidence-based disease control and prevention strategies, more efficient health systems and improved patient outcomes.",
