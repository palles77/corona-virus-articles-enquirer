Further work throughout the 1900s defined a humoral system in which the active agent, angiotensin (Ang II), was derived from a protein precursor, angiotensinogen (Aogen), via the sequential action of two enzymes, renin and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) (Figure 1 ). In this humoral system, Aogen is produced by the liver and secreted into the circulation. Renin, an aspartyl protease, is secreted into the plasma from cells of the juxtaglomerular apparatus in the kidney. Renin's only known substrate is Aogen, and the activity of this enzymatic reaction is considered to be the rate-limiting step in the pathway. Cleavage of Aogen yields a large glycoprotein of no known function and an inactive decapeptide, Ang I. Cleavage of Ang I by the zincdependent carboxypeptidase, ACE, produces the active octapeptide, Ang II. ACE is located on endothelial cells throughout the vascular system, with a particularly high concentration in the lung. Subsequent N-terminal cleavage of Ang II produces the heptapeptide Ang III, which is equipotent at Ang II receptors and may be an important ligand in some tissues.",

            "text": "Receptors for Ang II were cloned in the 1990s and shown to be G-protein-coupled receptors with seven transmembrane spanning domains. Two receptors, with approximately 30% homology, were cloned and termed AT 1 and AT 2 receptors. The AT 1 receptor, which mediates most of the classical actions of Ang II, was shown to occur in two isoforms in rodents, AT 1A and AT 1B . Although the number of intracellular signaling pathways employed by the AT 1 receptor continue to expand, many of the principal actions involve coupling to the a q/11 G-protein subunit. Activation results in cleavage of phosphatidyl-inositol (4,5) bisphosphate, by phospholipase C b , to yield diacylglycerol and inositol trisphosphate with subsequent increases in intracellular calcium concentrations and activation of protein kinase C. The angiotensin AT 2 receptor signals via activation of the protein phosphatases PP2A, SH2 domain-containing phosphatase, and mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase 1, resulting in the dephosphorylation and inactivation of kinases including growth factor tyrosine kinase receptors and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 (ERK-1) and 2 (ERK-2). Antiproliferative and proapoptotic actions mediated by the AT 2 receptor appear to involve the inactivation of ERK-1 and -2 by dephosphorylation. The binding of Ang II to the AT 2 receptor has also been shown to activate nitric oxide and phospholipase A2 in certain tissues. Investigation into the signaling pathways associated with AT 2 receptor activation is further complicated by the complex physiological roles of the receptor, often in pathological states.",

Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) was cloned and found to exhibit 40% homology with ACE but with one catalytic domain. In contrast to ACE, ACE2 cleaves single amino acid residues from the C-terminus of peptides. ACE2 is thought to have a counterregulatory role in the renin-angiotensin system, being involved in the degradation of Ang II and the generation of Ang 1-7, an effector peptide that often shows opposing actions to Ang II. The receptor for Ang 1-7 was found to be the 'orphan' G-protein-coupled receptor that is encoded by the proto-oncogene mas.

Although the exact mechanism of formation remains controversial for many of these tissues, the existence of independently regulated tissue renin-angiotensin systems is widely accepted.

Several other enzymes, including cathepsin D and G, tonin, and kallikrein, have the capacity to form Ang peptides from renin substrate, and it remains a distinct possibility that enzymes other than renin might contribute to the generation of Ang peptides in brain. The use of renin antibodies in immunohistochemical and Western blot analysis to identify brain renin was also fraught with issues pertaining to antibody specificity. Initial attempts to demonstrate the existence of renin mRNA, using in situ hybridization or Northern blot analysis, also produced variable results, most likely due to the use of whole brain, which thus diluted any renin present in discrete brain regions to below the level of detectability. Using Northern blot hybridization methods, Dzau and colleagues found evidence for the existence of renin mRNA in brain with levels approximately 10% of those found in kidney.",

Exon 1 has three different transcriptional initiation points, which form different renin isoforms.
