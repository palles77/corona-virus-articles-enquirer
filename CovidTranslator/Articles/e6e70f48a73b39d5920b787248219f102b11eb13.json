During this time, consumption of all antimicrobials for systemic use decreased by 33%. This change was driven by a 44% decrease in the consumption of unrestricted antibacterials, which was offset by a 42% increase in the consumption of restricted agents. The trends in MRSA prevalence (number of isolates/1000 patient-days) and HA-MRSA incidence (number of HA-MRSA-infected persons/1000 patient-days) correlated with the trend in overall consumption of antimicrobials. Significant positive correlations were observed between MRSA prevalence and the consumption of extended-spectrum and \u2424-lactamase-resistant penicillins, first-generation cephalosporins, macrolides, lincosamides and streptogramins, aminoglycosides, and glycopeptides. Significant positive correlations were found between the incidence of HA-MRSA infection and the consumption of tetracyclines, extended-spectrum and \u2424-lactamase-resistant penicillins, sulfonamides and trimethoprim, macrolides, lincosamides and streptogramins, and aminoglycosides. In conclusion, we have documented the ongoing successful reduction in total consumption of antimicrobials associated with a decrease in the incidence of HA-MRSA and the prevalence of MRSA over a 9-year period.",

In Taiwan, healthcare-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (HA-MRSA), which can cause life-threatening infections, has become endemic in hospitals [4] . A government policy restricting the use of antibiotics was established by the Bureau of National Health Insurance (BNHI) and was implemented in 2001 in Taiwan [4] . A few studies have evaluated the short-term relationship between consumption of antibiotics and antimicrobial resistance in Taiwan hospitals [9, 13, 14] before and after implementation of this policy.",

The restricted antimicrobials included \u2424-lactamase inhibitors and penicillin plus \u2424-lactamase inhibitor combination (sulbactam sodium, ampicillin/sulbactam injection, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid injection and piperacillin/tazobactam), second-generation cephalosporins (cefuroxime and cefmetazole), third-generation cephalosporins (cefotaxime, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, cefoperazone and flomoxef), fourth-generation cephalosporins (cefepime and cefpirome), carbapenems (ertapenem, meropenem and imipenem/cilastatin), aminoglycosides (amikacin and isepamicin), fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and moxifloxacin), glycopeptides (vancomycin and teicoplanin), linezolid, tigecycline and daptomycin. Furthermore, the indications for use of restricted antimicrobials became regulated by the BNHI in Taiwan and three important new regulations restricting antimicrobial use were implemented. Inappropriate prophylactic use of antibiotics for surgery was discouraged, for example by limiting the duration of antibiotic therapy to 3 days in some clean surgeries, e.g. total hip replacement, total knee replacement and coronary artery bypass graft. Antimicrobial agents used in the treatment of upper respiratory tract infections were restricted. The 10 guidelines for the use of antimicrobial agents in Taiwan can be freely downloaded from http://www.ejmii.com/guidelines.php to use as a reference.",

Furthermore, prescriptions for restricted antibiotics required authorisation from an IDS. Criteria that defined the need for consultation and authorisation by an IDS include use of restricted antibiotics, use of more than two different classes of antibiotics or use of antibiotics for longer than 7 days as well as the requested assessment of appropriate antibiotic use. The role of the IDSs in the antibiotic use programme is crucial. IDSs assess the appropriate use of antimicrobials and provide recommendations according to patient's clinical symptoms and signs, diagnosis, liver and renal function, co-morbidities, culture susceptibility tests and adherence to guidelines for the use of antimicrobial agents in Taiwan. Inappropriate use of antimicrobials is discontinued. IDSs permit appropriate antibiotic agents for 7 days after assessment and consent.",

Consumption of all antibacterials for systemic use decreased by 33% between 2001 and 2009. This was driven primarily by the 44% decrease in consumption of unrestricted antibacterials, which was offset by a 42% increase in the consumption of restricted agents. The patterns of antibacterial use also changed. In 2001 the most frequently used classes of antibacterials were other \u2424-lactam antibacterials (predominantly cephalosporins), tetracyclines and \u2424-lactam antibiotics (penicillins). By 2009, the other \u2424-lactam antibacterials were still used most often, but use of penicillins had greatly outpaced that of the tetracyclines owing to a large decrease in consumption of the tetracyclines and an increase in the use of combinations of penicillins. Other classes with relatively large changes in use included the lincosamides (5.1fold decrease), macrolides (2.5-fold decrease), aminoglycosides (3.6-fold decrease) and sulfonamides and trimethoprim (3.3-fold decrease). Simultaneous changes were observed in the incidence of HA-MRSA and the prevalence of MRSA. The proportion of patients infected with S. aureus in whom the strains were methicillin resistant (HA-MRSA incidence), the proportion of isolates that were resistant (MRSA prevalence) and the number of patients infected with HA-MRSA per total number of PD (infection density) all declined between 2001 and 2009. The prevalence of MRSA was significantly positively correlated with the decrease in total antibiotic use. These results are in general agreement with those from numerous other investigations that have shown a correlation between the prevalence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and antibiotic use [7] .",

A hospital in Italy reported an overall decrease of 8.5% in antibiotic use in the first year following adoption of an antibiotic control programme [24] . A hospital in Taiwan that adopted a policy similar to ours reported a decline of 13.2% in DDD/100 PD for parenteral antimicrobials immediately before and after implementation [25] . A novel feature of our study is that it spans a 9-year period following the implementation of an antimicrobial control policy, allowing an evaluation of the extent to which the provisions have been followed over time. This is particularly important in light of the findings of a study investigating the relationship between antimicrobial control policies and antimicrobial resistance rates in 33 hospitals in the USA in 2007 [26] . The authors of this report found that only 10 of the hospitals had an antibiotic use policy and that there was no correlation between the existence of an antibiotic use policy and resistance rates. Because they had no evidence that the policies were actually practiced in the hospitals that had adopted them, it was impossible to conclude whether the policies were effective.",

            "text": "In this study, data for antibiotic consumption and MRSA prevalence and incidence of HA-MRSA infection during 2003 stand out as obvious anomalies. A key event occurred during that year, which may explain these anomalous data. An epidemic of SARS began in mid March 2003 in Taiwan and lasted for almost 4 months. During that time, significant reductions (35.2%) in the utilisation of inpatient care were observed [27] , probably because individuals were fearful of becoming exposed to the virus in hospitals and clinics. We speculate that this fear may have led to a bias towards more seriously ill individuals seeking health care during this period, which may have distorted the baseline characteristics of the inpatient population in CSMU. This cohort of more seriously ill patients might have driven up the consumption of antibiotics. It is noteworthy that the incidence HA-MRSA infection and the prevalence of MRSA continued to mirror the use of antibiotics during this time.",

First, this study was conducted in only a single centre and, as such, its findings might not reflect the overall situation in Taiwan. Second, reduction in HA-MRSA infection rates in CSMU might be due to other factors rather than the policy of antibiotic restriction alone. Studies on the molecular epidemiology of MRSA isolates obtained from the study period are required to delineate the possibility of decreased clonal spread of isolates caused by improved infection control measures. Finally, we did not evaluate antibiotic usage as a time series and therefore cannot comment on the lag period and the significance of the immediate and sustained effects of the interventions.",
