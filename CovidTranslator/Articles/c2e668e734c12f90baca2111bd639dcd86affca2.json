Although 56% of respondents replied that they could continue to visit the department if a SARS patient was admitted to the unit in the hospital before they read the information, the proportion of those who intended to continue outpatient care significantly increased by 15% after they read it. The logistic regression analyses revealed that respondents who had frequently visited the outpatient department (P < 0.001), those who felt relieved by reading the information about the unit (P < 0.001), and those who did not worry about nosocomial SARS infection inside the hospital (P < 0.001) were significantly more likely to reply that they would continue outpatient visits. We estimated that admission of a SARS patient to the unit would result in a 20% decrease in the cumulative total number of outpatients in the hospital during a 180-day interval after admission of a SARS patient to the unit, and the cumulative total number of outpatients increased by 7% after they read the information. This study suggests that providing outpatients with appropriate information about SARS infection control in the hospital had a statistically significant and substantial impact on the outpatients' intention to continue outpatient visits at the hospital.",

Although no confirmed SARS case had been publicly reported in Japan as of 5th July 2003, an epidemic of fear was observed in Japan because a Taiwanese physician who was probably infected with SARS had visited Japan for 6 days in May 2003. To examine secondary infection by the patient during his stay in Japan, the Japanese government released the time schedule of his trip [13, 14] and recommended that visitors during that period should undergo health check-ups for SARS infection. Although no secondary SARS infection was identified, many people avoided visiting the places where the patient stopped by. Consequently, the restaurants, shops, and hotels where the patient stopped by and related markets were economically disrupted. Patients who are afraid of nosocomial SARS infection may avoid outpatient visits to hospitals that provide SARS treatment. Lay persons may be scared of SARS infection because the exact mechanism of SARS transmission, strategies for diagnosis, and treatment of SARS are not determined [15, 16] .",

In addition to severity and susceptibility, value of threat reduction and benefits of actions are also modeled to influence behavior [19] . Based on this model, we hypothesized that, if non-SARS outpatients consider that they are less likely to catch SARS infection in a hospital where a SARS patient stays because of completeness of SARS infection control in the hospital, patients are likely to continue to visit the hospital. We also hypothesized that, even if non-SARS outpatients want to suspend outpatient visits after the admission of a SARS patient to the hospital, they may change their intention into continuing their visit to the hospital when they are given appropriate information about both SARS transmission and the completeness of SARS infection control in the hospital. We further hypothesized that it is important for a SARS treatment hospital to examine factors associated with non-SARS patients' perception about continuation of ambulatory care. However, to the best of our knowledge, there has to date been no study that examined a non-SARS patient's intention of ambulatory care use. This study examined the effect of providing outpatients with information about SARS infection control in the infectious disease treatment unit in a community hospital on their intention to continue outpatient visits, and estimated the cumulative total number of outpatients as well as the cumulative total expenditures for outpatient care at the hospital during a 180-day period after the admission of a SARS patient to the hospital.",

We used seven kinds of respondents' intention regarding whether or not the respondent wished to continue to visit the outpatient care in the hospital after a SARS patient was admitted to the hospital. Available answers and assumed periods of respondents who intend to suspend outpatient visit were: (1) continue to visit (suspended period = 0 day), (2) suspended until SARS patient's discharge (20 days), (3) suspended for 10 days after SARS patient's discharge (30 days), (4) suspended for 1 month after SARS patient's discharge (60 days), (5) suspended for two or three months after SARS patient's discharge (120 days), (6) would not use the outpatient department any more (180 days), and (7) no idea. For respondents who replied \"no idea,\" we assumed that all of them would suspend for the first 20 days, 10% of them would resume visits 30 days after admission of a SARS patient, 20% of them would resume visits after 60 days, 30% after 120 days, and 40% of them would not visit during a 180-day period. Because the hospital provides ambulatory care services 5 days a week, the net days during each suspended period were assumed to be (1) 0 days for patients who continue to use the outpatient department in the hospital, (2) 15 days for patients who suspend visits until a SARS patient is discharged, (3) 21 days for patients who suspended visits for 10 days after a SARS patient is discharged, (4) 41 days for a patient who suspend visits for 1 month after a SARS patient is discharged, (5) 82 days for patients who suspend visits for a few months after a SARS patient is discharged, and (6) 123 days for patients who would not use the outpatient department any more. We calculated the cumulative total number of patients who were assumed to visit the outpatient department by summing the number of patients during each suspended period. Next, we obtained the cumulative total expenditures for outpatient care at the hospital during the 180-day interval by multiplying the cumulative total number of outpatients by the mean total expenditure for outpatients per patient per day. Then we compared the estimated cumulative total number of outpatients between before and after respondents read the information about the infectious disease treatment unit in the hospital. We performed a one-way sensitivity analysis using a 95% confidence interval of the proportion of respondents who replied that they intended to continue to visit before and after they read the information about the SARS treatment unit. In the sensitivity analysis, because we did not ask how long the patient intended to suspend outpatient visits when they replied that they would suspend even after reading the information, we assumed that the suspension period of the respondent was the same as that in the response before the respondent read the information.",

Tables 1 and 2 show basic characteristics of the study participants and their intention to continue outpatient visits before they read the information about the infectious disease treatment unit in the hospital. Before they read the information about the unit, when we asked respondents their intention of outpatient visits if a SARS patient was admitted to the unit in the hospital, 44% of them replied that they would suspend visits to the outpatient department. Table 3 shows the change in the respondents' intention of outpatient visits at the hospital if a SARS patient was admitted to the hospital before and after the respondents read the information about SARS infection control at the infectious disease treatment unit in the hospital. The proportion of patients who intended to continue outpatient visits at the hospital significantly increased after they read the information (P < 0.001): 38% of the respondents who initially intended to suspend ambulatory care visits replied that they intended to continue outpatient visits to the hospital. Tables 4 and  5 show results from the bivariate and multiple logistic regression analyses to examine factors associated with respondents' intention to continue outpatient visits to the hospital. The logistic regression analysis revealed that, after the respondents read the information about the unit, those who had visited outpatient department frequently (P < 0.05), those who were relieved after reading the information about the unit (P < 0.001), and those who did not worry about SARS infection in the hospital (P < 0.001), were significantly more likely to continue outpatient visits at the hospital, even if a SARS patient were admitted to the hospital. The other logistic regression analysis showed that, among respondents who initially intended to suspend ambulatory visits to the hospital, those who had frequently visited the outpatient department (P < 0.001), those who were relieved after reading the information about the unit (P < 0.001), and those who did not worry about nosocomial SARS infection in the hospital (P < 0.001), were significantly more likely to change their intention to continue outpatient visits at the hospital. Table 6 shows a result of simulations to estimate the cumulative total number of outpatients at the hospital during the 180-day period following a SARS patient's admission to the unit, and to examine the impact of the provision of information about the infection control in the unit. Before the respondents read the information, the cumulative number of outpatients and the cumulative total expenditures for outpatient care during a 180-day period were estimated to decrease by 20% after admission of a SARS patient. We also estimated that the hospital would lose total expenditures for outpatient care of US $2.0 million during the 180-day period.

Because these variables were key components of the health belief model explaining patients' behavior: i.e. perceived susceptibility to SARS infection as threat of the disease and perceived efficacy of SARS infection control as benefits of actions, these results indicate that the intention of outpatient visits at a hospital that has a infectious disease treatment unit may be explained by threat of the disease and benefits of actions in the health belief model [19] . This is consistent with another report which revealed that threat of disease and tendency to visit a physician were associated with use of physicians in a cross-national study conducted in Table 4 Proportion of respondents who intended to continue outpatient visit after they read information about the SARS infection control in the unit by variables ( 2 test) Proportion of respondents who intended to continue outpatient visit among analyzable subjects after they read the information (n = 821) Proportion of respondents who changed their perception to continue to visit after reading the information about the unit among those who initially intended to suspend visit (n = 364) the United States, England, and Yugoslavia [20] . This is consistent with our study: respondents who had frequently visited the outpatient department were significantly more likely to continue their visits. Although the current study was conducted with a cross-sectional design, it is reasonable for us to speculate that the fear of nosocomial SARS transmission in the hospital among non-SARS outpatients as the threat of the disease may affect their intention to suspend outpatient visits if a SARS patient were admitted to the hospital.",

We estimated that the cumulative total number of outpatients who using the outpatient department during 180 days after the admission of a SARS patient to the hospital would decrease by 20%, compared with before the SARS patient's admission to the hospital. In addition, Table 5 Factors associated with respondents' intention of outpatient visit after they read information about the SARS infection control in the unit (multiple logistic regression analyses) An analysis for all respondents (n = 821) 1 = continue to visit, 0 = suspended to visit An analysis for respondents who initially replied to suspend outpatient visit (n = 364) 1 = changed from suspending to continuing, 0 = remained suspending we estimated that the cumulative total expenditures for medical care provided during the 180-day period would decrease by US $2.0 million, compared with before the SARS patient's admission to the hospital. The Japan's universal health insurance system guarantees that patients can access any medical facility all over Japan: \"the free access policy\" [21] . Thus, if patients are not willing to visit the hospital any more, even for non-medical reasons, they can use another hospital for their outpatient care. Thus the free access policy may result in a decrease in non-SARS outpatients in a SARS treatment hospital if a SARS patient is admitted to the hospital and outpatients that they will catch SARS in the hospital. This decrease of outpa- Since almost all Japanese medical facilities are managed by Japan's universal health insurance system based on a fee-for-service payment with universal point-fee tables, any such decrease in the number of outpatients may trigger an economic crisis in hospital management not only for outpatients departments but also for inpatient care. Appropriate information about SARS, such as the efficacy of infection control, must be provided to patients so that the hospital can minimize the decrease in number of outpatient visits. Meanwhile, health authorities should implement a system which compensates for deficits in medical care expenditure associated with SARS care at a hospital. When we interpret the results of our study, some limitations must be considered. First, non-response bias is a potential limitation of the study. As the response rate of this survey was 31%, the results are likely biased, but the direction of that bias is not clear. Also, because the ratio of gender and the distribution of age between the respondents and all patients who underwent outpatient care during the survey period were similar, we might assume that the intention of outpatient visits when a SARS patient is admitted to the hospital is similar between the respondents and non-respondents. Second, the hospital selected in this study is not representative of all hospitals for SARS care in Japan. There were only 13 hospitals with specific infectious treatment units having separate nega-tive pressure rooms in August 2003 in Japan. We need to conduct further investigation at other SARS treatment hospitals in Japan to examine the generalizability of the results in this study. Third, our simulations to estimate the cumulative total number of outpatients and to estimate the cumulative total expenditures for outpatient care in the hospital were based on many assumptions. Especially, because we did not ask how long the patient intended to suspend outpatient visits when they replied that they would suspend even after reading the information, we assumed that the suspension period of the respondent was the same as that before reading the information. Fourth, though information about SARS control was provided to the respondents in the questionnaire, it is only assumed that respondents would not read the entire questionnaire before answering the questions. On the other hand, if a respondent read the whole questionnaire first, including the information on SARS control, the questions that assessed before and after changes might not be valid. Finally, we were not able to examine all possible factors that are considered to associate with outpatients' behavior, such as educational status, perceived benefit, vulnerability to illness in general, satisfaction with providers, and severity of illness [22] . For example, among subjects who initially replied that they would suspend ambulatory visits, 53% answered that although the provision of information about the infection management in the unit relieved them of their fear about SARS transmission in the hospital they still wanted to suspend outpatient care underwent at the hospital. This indicates that some unmeasured factor may be associated with their behavior [19] .",

This study showed that respondents who were scared about nosocomial SARS infection were five times less likely to continue outpatient visits than those who were not scared by it, even after they read the information about the efficacy of the SARS infection control in the hospital.
