How CD81 governs HCV entry is poorly characterized, and CD81 protein interactions after virus binding remain elusive. We have developed a quantitative proteomics protocol to identify HCV-triggered CD81 interactions and found 26 dynamic binding partners. At least six of these proteins promote HCV infection, as indicated by RNAi. We further characterized serum response factor binding protein 1 (SRFBP1), which is recruited to CD81 during HCV uptake and supports HCV infection in hepatoma cells and primary human hepatocytes. SRFBP1 facilitates host cell penetration by all seven HCV genotypes, but not of vesicular stomatitis virus and human coronavirus. Thus, SRFBP1 is an HCV-specific, pan-genotypic host entry factor. These results demonstrate the use of quantitative proteomics to elucidate pathogen entry and underscore the importance of host protein-protein interactions during HCV invasion.",

Successful penetration of cells involves receptor binding, virion uptake, membrane fusion or perturbation, transport of nucleocapsids to replication competent cellular compartments, and uncoating (Yamauchi and Helenius, 2013) . Virus receptors are more than attachment factors, functionally supporting cell entry by several means: they mediate formation of receptor platforms, induce conformational changes in virus surface molecules, transmit signals within the cell, and induce virus translocation along the membrane and into the cell (Mercer et al., 2010) . A number of virus receptors, however, lack signaling domains. Consequently, these receptors must initiate the virus uptake program through ligand-dependent interaction with additional host proteins.",

CD81 is a central player in HCV entry as it directly binds the HCV E2 surface glycoprotein, renders it fusion competent (Pileri et al., 1998; Rajesh et al., 2012; Sharma et al., 2011) , and activates the HCV entry cofactor epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) (Diao et al., 2012; Gerold and Rice, 2011; Lupberger et al., 2011) . Moreover, CD81 is thought to laterally translocate with the virions to tight junctions, where CLDN1 and OCLN reside (Brazzoli et al., 2008) . Finally, CD81 and CLDN1 co-internalize with the virus into endosomes (Farquhar et al., 2012) . How CD81 orchestrates HCV uptake remained elusive. As a scaffolding protein, CD81 lacks intracellular signaling domains but coordinates proteinprotein interactions in membrane microdomains termed tetraspanin webs (Charrin et al., 2003; Montpellier et al., 2011) . We hypothesized that the binding of HCV to CD81 triggers protein interactions, which in turn coordinate HCV uptake.",

Here, we use stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) and quantitative interaction proteomics (Ong et al., 2002) to study host protein interactions with the HCV receptor CD81 upon HCV exposure. To this end, HCV permissive human hepatoma cells Huh-7 were labeled with heavy arginine (( 15 N 4 13 C 6 ) Arg-10) and lysine (( 15 N 2 13 C 6 ) Lys-8), achieving 95% incorporation of heavy amino acids into cellular proteins (heavy) or left unlabeled (light). As HCV induces clathrin-mediated endocytosis 15 min after binding (Coller et al., 2009) , we incubated heavy Huh-7 cells for 15 min with HCV (J6/JFH-1 clone 2; MOI: 10) and light cells with non-infectious cell culture supernatants (forward label). To exclude isotope-specific effects, we swapped labels of the two conditions, so that light cells were HCV exposed and heavy cells mock treated (reverse label). Next, we affinity enriched CD81 and its interacting proteins (Figure S1A), combined proteins from HCV and uninfected samples, and digested proteins to peptides. Liquid chromatography (LC) coupled to mass spectrometry (MS) then identified, quantified, and distinguished peptides derived from HCV and uninfected conditions by their characteristic mass offset ( Figures 1A and S1B) .",

Subsequent data processing eliminates these background binders as described below. CD81 was detected in all co-IPs with high intensities independent of the presence of bound HCV ( Figure S1C ). To identify HCV-regulated protein-protein interactions, we next calculated the ratios of heavy over light protein abundances in cells with or without bound HCV. Protein quantification was reproducible as demonstrated by a median correlation of the SILAC ratios of r 2 = 0.70 and 0.81 for forward and reverse label samples, respectively. Here, we focused on proteins, which differed between the two experimental conditions, thereby excluding background binders, which are equally abundant in HCV and mock samples. As hypothesized, we identified 55 protein interactors, which quantitatively differed between HCV and mock samples. Among these HCV-dependent transient interactors are proteins that associate with CD81 ( Figure 1B , upper right quadrant) or dissociate from CD81 upon virus exposure ( Figure 1B , lower left quadrant).",

Of note, we additionally excluded ribosomal proteins in this study, although they might have a potential role in virus uncoating. A total of 26 proteins fulfilled these inclusion criteria, half of which dissociated from and the other half associated with CD81 upon virus binding (labeled data points in Figures 1B and 1C and Table S2 ; IntAct: IM-24070). Proteins that were exclusively quantified in the presence of HCV were assigned an infinite ratio, because the strength of interaction could not be determined. Known steady-state interaction partners of CD81 were absent from this transient interactome. Instead, we identified huntingtininteracting-protein-1-related protein (HIP1R), a previously reported HCV entry cofactor and a known component of clathrin-coated pits (Coller et al., 2009) . Taken together, we confirmed our hypothesis that HCV binding to CD81 alters its protein interaction network and that some HCV entry cofactors are transient CD81 interactors.",

Finally, we found clusters of calcium-and metal-binding proteins as well as nuclear proteins, with a secondary cytoplasmic localization. All identified proteins with extracellular or plasma membrane localization dissociated from CD81 upon HCV binding ( Figure 1F , blue label), whereas proteins localizing to endosomes or intracellular compartments associated with CD81 ( Figure 1F , red label). This confirms the notion that the HCV-CD81 complex needs to move out of plasma membrane microdomains to then get endocytosed. In summary, we identified 26 selected transient proteinreceptor interactions during HCV entry including a known HCV entry cofactor and a cluster of junctional membrane proteins.",

Eight of the 26 targets showed a significant reduction in HCV infection of Huh-7.5 cells upon RNAi. HIP1R, a previously reported HCV cofactor, also decreased HCV infectivity but did not meet our statistical significance criteria ( Figure 2B ; Table S5 ). CD81-targeting siRNAs served as positive control and reduced HCV infectivity more than 5-fold. None of the candidate targeting or scrambled siRNAs were cytotoxic or altered cell proliferation. Cystatin A (CSTA), a desmosomal regulator, dissociated almost completely from CD81 upon virus binding (Figures 1B and 1C) , and its silencing led to a significant increase in HCV infectivity ( Figure 2B ).",

Importantly, SRFBP1 mRNA and protein levels correlated strongly ( Figures S3A and S3B ). The observed differences in SRFBP1 expression led us to examine whether endogenous SRFBP1 levels were limiting HCV infection in hepatoma cells. When overexpressing SRFBP1 in Huh-7.5 cells, we observed a dose-dependent 2-to 3-fold increase in HCV infectivity ( Figure 3B ). Conversely, when silencing SRFBP1 in primary hepatocytes, we observed a 4-fold decrease in HCV infectivity ( Figure S3C ).

Our infectivity readout at 48 hr post-HCV inoculation determined accumulative effects of virus entry, translation, replication, and spread (Gerold and Pietschmann, 2014) . Thus, we next sought to exclude that SRFBP1 would affect HCV translation or replication. When silencing SRFBP1 (nt394) in cells actively replicating HCV, we observed no impairment of replication and RLuc reporter translation at 48 or 72 hr post-RNAi. In stark contrast, silencing the known replication host factor phosphatidyl inositol 4 kinase 3 alpha (PI4KIIIalpha) reduced replication to background levels ( Figure 3E , upper panel) Reiss et al., 2011) . Neither knockdown of SRFBP1 nor of PI4KIIIalpha affected cell viability or proliferation ( Figure 3E , middle panel). To address a possible role of SRFBP1 in assembly, release, and spread of HCV, we collected supernatants from HCV-replicating cells at (B) CD81 interactome upon HCV exposure.

(D and E) Enrichment of Gene Ontology cellular component (GOCC) and molecular function (GOMF) annotations. (F) Functional map of host factors transiently interacting with the HCV receptor CD81 during virus entry. Functional clusters (white boxes) and previously reported interactions (bold lines) of the here identified transient CD81-binding partners are depicted. We assigned individual proteins to the highest scoring DAVID cluster. Yellow lines between genes of different clusters indicate high-confidence (>0.9) STRING interactions. Within a functional annotation cluster, also lower confidence (>0.35) STRING interactions are shown. Proteins are placed in their predominant cellular location; SRFBP1 is shown twice as it localizes to nucleus and cytoplasm. The box size indicates the degree of CD81 association or dissociation upon HCV binding. Associating factors (red) and dissociating factors (blue) are shown.

SRFBP1 silencing did not alter the released infectivity, whereas apolipoprotein E (APOE) silencing expectedly reduced the released infectivity to 40% ( Figure 3E , lower panel) (Chang et al., 2007) . Taken together, SRFBP1 silencing rendered cells less susceptible to HCV without altering replication or spread of the virus to naive cells.",

Indepth analysis revealed that the putative helix at aa108 has a five-amino-acid hydrophobic side (FLLVI) flanked by lysine residues (http://heliquest.ipmc.cnrs.fr; Gautier et al., 2008) . Moreover, two cysteine residues could serve as palmitoylation sites ( Figure 5E ). To confirm that a fraction of SRFBP1 is membrane associated, we performed membrane-flotation assays. In accordance with our prediction, a subfraction of endogenous SRFBP1 resided in the upper, membrane-associated gradient fractions ( Figure 5F ). As expected, CLDN1 and GAPDH resided in the upper and lower fractions, respectively. After solubilization of membranes using Triton X-100, we found endogenous SRFB1 exclusively in the soluble lower fractions and the CLDN1 control shifted partially to these fractions. Interestingly, a mycDDKtagged overexpression construct of SRFBP1 resided in cytosolic fractions, suggesting that the soluble tag impaired membrane association of SRFBP1. Our analysis indicates that a fraction of SRFBP1 can associate with cellular membranes presumably through a weak amphipathic helix.",

Using a bicistronic HCV IRES-driven translation reporter, we excluded a role for SRFBP1 in viral genome translation ( Figures 6C, 6D , S6A, and S6B). Replication complex formation of subgenomic and full-length HCV replicons similarly remained unaltered upon SRFBP1 silencing ( Figures 6E, S6C , and S6D). In line with this observation, SRFBP1 did not colocalize with the HCV protein NS5A (Pearson's coefficient < 0.2; Figures S6E and S6F). We next induced HCV fusion at the plasma membrane by a low-pH wash and by concomitantly blocking endosomal acidification. In this assay, HCV enters cells by fusion at the plasma membrane or at the limiting endosomal membrane before acidification ( Figure 6F ). As expected, CD81 silencing led to a 5-fold reduced HCV infectivity, as CD81 interactions prime the HCV glycoproteins for membrane fusion. Notably, silencing of SRFBP1 reduced HCV infection by 3-fold, indicating that SRFBP1 functions in cell entry steps other than the acidification of endosomes. In confirmation of our assay setup, human coronavirus fusion at the plasma membrane was independent of pH, whereas VSV required a low-pH wash. Both coronavirus and VSV infectivity remained unaffected by SRFBP1 or CD81 silencing in this bypass assay (Figures S6G and S6H) . Taken together, our data show that SRFBP1 is aiding an early step in HCV infection even when viral envelope fusion is artificially induced at the plasma membrane.",

During the HCV entry pathway, SRFBP1 supports a step independent of receptor binding, clathrin-mediated endocytosis, and endosomal acidification. The latter three steps are reliably mimicked by lentiviral HCV pseudotypes, which enter cells independent of SRFBP1. The observed discrepancy between cell culture HCV and HCV pseudoparticles confirms other studies suggesting that HCV pseudoparticles cannot fully mimic the entry pathway of HCV (Sainz et al., 2012) . This can be attributed either to the lower avidity of HCV pseudoparticles, which display a lower density of glycoproteins, to the lack of serum lipoprotein association of HCV pseudoparticles, or to the different nucleocapsid.",

Second, SRFBP1 might assist HCV uncoating or nucleocapsid transport, both of which are not reflected by the pseudoparticle system. Generally, SRFBP1 could be the missing link between HCV receptor binding and actin-dependent movement during HCV invasion. Indeed, we observed an interaction of SRFBP1 with G actin. Moreover, EGFR, Arp2/3, Rho GEFs, and Rho GTPases are reported upstream activators of the SRFBP1 protein family and at the same time support HCV entry (Brazzoli et al., 2008; Lupberger et al., 2011; Zona et al., 2013) .

In rat cardiomyocytes, SRFBP1 localizes to actin fibers close to their attachment site to the cell cortex and SRFBP1 overexpression leads to actin depolymerization (Zhang et al., 2014) . This hints that SRFBP1 belongs to the class of myocar-din-related transcription factor (MRTF) cofactors (Olson and Nordheim, 2010) , which regulate actin polymerization by cycling between a G-actin-bound cytoplasmic state and a nuclear state. Concordantly, we found SRFBP1 in the nucleus and at cytoplasmic G actin in human hepatoma cells. Like other MRTF cofactors, SRFBP1 could regulate actin dynamics downstream of plasma membrane receptor signaling. In line with this, CD81 engagement by antibodies was recently reported to promote actin-dependent hepatoma spread (Brimacombe et al., 2014) . Thus, HCV might exploit endogenous mechanisms of physical force generation to traffic during its entry.",

            "text": "Taken together, we established a combination of high-resolution MS, computational proteomics, and RNAi to elucidate receptor complex rearrangements during HCV entry. We believe that quantitative interaction proteomics is an attractive strategy to identify host factors of infectious agents. A particular strength lies in the unbiased identification of yet uncharacterized proteins as we demonstrate for SRFBP1, a protein with previously unknown function in hepatocytes. Moreover, interaction proteomics allows the identification of host factors, which are ubiquitously expressed, and are thus not accessible by genetic complementation screens. Similarly, host factors with essential endogenous function are poorly suited for stable knockdown or knockout screens and can readily be found by quantitative proteomics. Thus, the minimal system perturbation during the above-described workflow is a clear benefit over classical genetic screening methods. On the other hand, functional information on the identified host factors is limited to the interaction with a given virus receptor. A functional follow-up screen, as we describe here, is therefore critical to evaluate the protein interaction data. Consequently, interaction proteomics is a complementary method in the thus far genomics-oriented toolbox for systems virology (Law et al., 2013) . As for other systems biology methods, interaction proteomics is not error free. Although detection limits for MS fingerprinting have increased tremendously in the past years , false negatives might arise depending on the affinity enrichment method used. False positive interactions could obviously arise after cell lysis (B) SRFBP1 is dispensable for coronavirus infection. SRFBP1-silenced cells were infected with HCoV229E-luc (MOI 0.1) and RLuc activity in cell lysates measured 24 hpi. Infectivity relative to a scrambled siRNA control is shown. (C) Immunoblot analysis of SRFBP1 and CD81 48 hp siRNA transfection. Huh-7.5 cells were transfected with siRNA or transduced with the indicated pWPI expression construct as in (A)-(H), 48 hr later lysed, and analyzed by immunoblot. Actin served as loading control. *, residual SRFBP1 signal. (D) Bicistronic translational reporter assay with HCV IRES-driven RLuc and cap-dependent FLuc (see also Figures S6A and S6B) . SRFBP1 silencing and overexpression was performed as in (C), and 48 hr later, cells were transfected with translational reporter RNA. Eight hours after reporter transfection, luciferase activity in lysates was monitored. (E) Early replication reporter assay using a subgenomic HCV genome expressing FLuc. SRFBP1 silencing and overexpression was performed as in (C), and 48 hr later, JFH-SGR-FLuc RNA was transfected into cells; cells lysed after 8 hr; and luciferase activity monitored. A polymerase mutant JFH-SGR-FLuc replicon (DGDD) was used to assess translation of HCV genomes independent of de novo replication. See also Figures S6C and S6D for additional controls. (F) SRFBP1 is required in a plasma membrane fusion assay of HCV infection. Huh-7.5 cells silenced for SRFBP1 were pretreated with concanamycin A (5 nM; 1 hr) to block vacuolar type H + -ATPases, incubated with HCV (JcR2A) for 2 hr at 4 C in the presence of concanamycin A, shifted to 37 C, and washed with a pH 5 or pH 7 buffer for 5 min. After incubation with concanamycin A for 4 hr, medium was changed and endosomal acidification independent infectivity measured at 48 hpi. See also Figures S6E and S6F for additional controls. (G) Lentiviral pseudotypes infect Huh-7.5 cells independently of SRFBP1. Cells in which SRFBP1 had been silenced (48 hr) were infected with HIV-1 pseudotypes encoding FLuc and displaying glycoproteins from HCV genotype 1 (H77), HCV genotype 2 (J6), VSV, or no glycoprotein. At 72 hpi, cells were lysed and FLuc activity measured. Infectivity was calculated by subtraction of background read for glycoprotein-free particles and relative to VSVG particles. (H) Silencing of SRFBP1 reduces infectivity of chimeric HCV viruses with glycoproteins from all seven genotypes. Huh-7.5 FLuc cells were subjected to siRNAmediated silencing followed by infection with intergenotypic HCV chimeras (MOI 0.1) expressing RLuc. Forty-eight hours post-infection, infectivity was determined by RLuc activity measurement. Cells treated with CD81 targeting or scrambled siRNAs served as controls. SRFBP1-targeting siRNA 394 was used in all experiments. Data from three to five biological replicates are displayed as mean + SD. See also Figure S6 . and disruption of cellular compartments, and thus, careful follow-up analysis is critical for the here-described methodology. Clearly, receptor interaction proteomics will not only allow the follow-up search for entry factors but can also reveal host factors involved in innate immune recognition or cellular perturbations triggered by the virus like, e.g., apoptosis ( Figure S7 ). Given that co-IP proteomics reveals interconnectivity of pathogen receptors and host cofactors, we envision that the technique can spur the development of peptidomimetics or small molecules for therapeutic intervention of pathogen invasion (de Chassey et al., 2012) .",

Briefly, we used STRING 9.1 (http://www.string-db.org) to generate interaction networks of significant SILAC hits with a 2.1-fold or stronger dynamic CD81 interaction (Franceschini et al., 2013) . Then, each protein was assigned to the cluster with the highest enrichment, in which the protein was present in the highest fraction of individual annotations. Selected unclustered proteins were placed back in the visualization as inverted arrowheads. All STRING interactions (solid lines) with a confidence score of 0.9 or higher, and all interactions of 0.35 or higher between genes within the same functional annotation cluster were added. Finally, we manually placed functional annotation clusters in their approximate cellular locations. Selected proteins with two cellular locations were placed into both respective places (see Figure 1F ).",

Membrane fusion was induced by a 5 min wash with pH 5 citric acid buffer. Background infection was assessed by a 5 min wash with pH 7 citric acid buffer. To complete virus uptake, cells were incubated for an additional 3 h with medium containing concanamycin A, then medium replaced and luciferase activity measured 24 hpi (HCoV229E-luc, VSV-FLuc) and 48 hpi (HCV JcR2A).",
