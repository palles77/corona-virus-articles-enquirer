[2] [3] [4] [5] [6] Glucocorticoids are commonly prescribed for the treatment of many inflammatory, allergic, immunologic, and malignant disorders. Hyperglycemia is frequently experienced by patients after steroid administration, with a prevalence of 20% to 50% among patients without a previous history of diabetes. [7] [8] [9] The American Diabetes Association (ADA), the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists, and the Endocrine Society have published guidelines about the appropriate management of patients who develop hyperglycemia secondary to steroid therapy; however, the recommendations are based on expert opinion rather than evidence-based data, which is lacking in this area. 6, 10 In the most recent statement by the ADA and the Endocrine Society, 10 it is recommended that patients treated with glucocorticoids who develop hyperglycemia should be treated with a basal/bolus insulin regimen at a starting dose of 0.3 to 0.5 units/kg/day. Notably the Endocrine Society and the ADA, understanding the magnitude of the problem, recommended the use of continuous insulin infusion in patients who receive high-dose glucocorticoids and develop severe hyperglycemia, 10 a treatment that can be easily implemented in the critical care/intensive care unit (ICU) setting but not in the non-critical care setting (eg, general wards). Most in-patient glucose management guidelines for subcutaneous insulin therapy recommend that 50% of the insulin TDD be administered as basal insulin and that 50% be administered as 3 equally divided doses of nutritional insulin. 11, 12 However, patients who receive steroids develop significant postprandial hyperglycemia due to decreased insulin-mediated glucose uptake into the peripheral tissues (ie, adipose tissue, skeletal muscle), 13 leading diabetes experts to suggest that these patients may need to be treated with more nutritional than basal insulin. 14 We therefore hypothesized that patients with diabetes treated with steroids who achieve normoglycemia in the hospital would have a higher nutritional and lower basal insulin requirement than those not achieving normoglycemia. To test our hypothesis, we performed a retrospective study of non-critically ill hospitalized patients with diabetes mellitus who received steroids to compare:1) total daily basal, nutritional, and correction insulin doses; 2) percentage each of basal, nutritional, and correction insulin to insulin TDD; 3) total daily insulin dose per kilogram body weight (units/kg); 4) ratio of insulin to hydrocortisone dose (units/mg); and 5) ratio of insulin to hydrocortisone dose per kilogram (units/mg/kg).",

To minimize potential non-glucocorticoid confounding factors that can alter glucose management (increasing or decreasing insulin needs), we excluded patients with infections that required treatment with systemic antibiotics (n = 32); individuals with a history of kidney failure (glomerular filtration rate [GFR] < 30 mL/min per 1.73m 2 ) or liver failure (International Normalized Ratio [INR] > 1.7; n = 29); human immunodeficiency virus or lipodystrophy (n = 4); and patients receiving continuous tube feeds, parenteral nutrition, or > 1 L/day of 5% dextrose intravenous (IV) fluids (n = 21). We also excluded patients who were receiving glucocorticoids with hydrocortisone equivalent doses < 20 mg/day (n = 10), had missing data (n = 29), did not have a history of diabetes mellitus (n = 13), or had diabetes not managed by a basal-bolus insulin regimen (eg, treated with insulin pumps, premixed insulins, or oral medications; n = 34). We also excluded patients who had hypoglycemic events, as frequent hypoglycemia might lower overall average glucose despite significant glucose fluctuations (n = 13). Four duplicate patient records were also excluded. Our final patient sample (N = 58) included those patients who were eating, receiving a carbohydrate-controlled diet, and who were on a basal-bolus insulin regimen (glargine/aspart regimen) (n = 58). In our hospital, a carbohydrate-controlled diet consists of 60 grams of carbohydrates per tray.

We also calculated the TDD/hydrocortisone dose/kg to potentially identify the required insulin dose/ hydrocortisone/kg to safely achieve normoglycemia.",

Recently published guidelines recommend that patients being treated with glucocorticoids receive a starting total daily insulin dose of 0.3 to 0.5 units/kg/ day. 10 It is reasonable to initiate therapy with a more conservative insulin regimen, however, to our knowledge, no studies have been performed in order to identify the target TDD of insulin required to achieve normoglycemia in patients with diabetes receiving steroids. Our data indicate that patients achieving normglycemia required much higher insulin doses, close to 0.8 units/kg/day. Our finding of higher nutritional insulin requirements in patients receiving glucocorticoids who achieved glycemic targets is also consistent with expert opinion recommendations 14 ; however, these recommendations were based on clinical observations rather than clinical research studies. Recently published guidelines did not specifically comment on the potential for increased nutritional insulin needs in patients receiving glucocorticoids but recommend IV insulin infusion, when the basal-bolus approach is not effective. 10 Although IV insulin infusion treatment is likely the safest and most efficient approach to achieving normoglycemia in patients, the method may not be feasible in non-ICU, non-critical care settings (eg, general wards), necessitating development of alternative approaches to achieving glycemic targets using subcutaneous insulin.",

Insulin regimens using neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH) have been suggested as alternative approaches intreating glucocorticoid-induced hyperglycemia in patients with or without history of diabetes mellitus, especially and in particular in patients who receive prednisone or prednisolone, as NPH and prednisone and prednisolone share similar pharmacodynamic properties. 9 A review article 9 also suggested an approach to adjusting the NPH dose in the setting of glucocorticoid taper. There are some acknowledged limitations to this approach. As the authors stated, the regimen should not be applied in patients who receive long-acting glucocorticoids, such as dexamethasone, when longer-acting insulins, such as glargine or detemir, may be more effective. 9 A recent study showed that administration of NPH and glargine as basal insulin were equally effective in treating patients with prednisone-induce hyperglycemia. 16 Seggelke et al performed a small study in patients with cystic fibrosis receiving methylprednisolone, assessing glucose outcomes in patients treated with glargine and lispro compared with glargine, lispro, and NPH. 17 Results showed that both treatment groups had similar (normoglycemic) fasting blood glucose levels; however, the group that received NPH in addition to the basal-bolus regimen had better pre-lunch and pre-dinner glucose levels. 17 The study was limited by the small number of patients (n = 20), short study duration (3 days) , and the inclusion only of patients with cystic fibrosis, limiting generalizability of the findings. 17 Additionally, the control group received similar amounts of glargine and lispro insulin, close to 50% each, so it is unknown if they would have achieved better postprandial glycemic control with higher doses of nutritional insulin. These early study results suggest combing NPH insulin with a multiple daily injection regimen of a once-daily basal insulin and rapid-acting analogs may be effective in treating glucocorticoidinduced hyperglycemia; however, although not reported, the use of 3 different insulin types could potentially lead to medication errors with deleterious effects for the patient.",

            "text": "Our approach of treating postprandial hyperglycemia with higher doses of nutritional insulin in the setting of glucocorticoid administration has a physiologic rationale. Glucocorticoids can induce insulin resistance and therefore exacerbate postprandial hyperglycemia by different pathways, affecting either muscle, adipose tissue, liver, or bones. 13 In rat L6 skeletal muscle cells, dexamethasone treatment decreased the expression of key elements in the insulin receptor pathway, such as insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1, phospatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3-K), and protein kinase B (PKB). [18] [19] [20] Steroid administration in rats has also been shown to decrease the migration of glucose transporter 4 (GLUT-4) to the surface of the muscle. 21 Glucocorticoids can also induce muscle skeletal atrophy by increasing protein degradation 13 and the released amino acids have been shown to alter insulin signaling by inhibiting IRS-1 phosphorylation and PI3-K activation. 22 In adipose tissue, glucocorticoids have been shown to down-regulate IRS-1 in 3T3L1 adipocytes, 23 and also to alter the expression of several adipokines, such as adiponectin and resistin. 13, 24 Finally, in the liver, glucocorticoids can induce insulin resistance by different mechanisms. Administration of glucocorticoids induces hepatic insulin resistance by impairing the insulin suppressive effects in hepatic glucose production, especially in the postprandial state, and this was demonstrated in healthy subjects following short-term glucocorticoid exposure. 13, 25, 26 Recently, it was reported that long-term treatment with glucocorticoids induces insulin resistance through suppression of the osteoblast-derived peptide osteocalcin. 27 Our study had several limitations that should be kept in mind in interpreting our data. First, our sample size was small. Of the 247 patients consults considered where patients received steroids, only 58 patients did not have significant comorbidities that prevented them from being included. The rationale for this was to try to avoid any comorbidities unrelated to glucocorticoids that could significantly alter the patient's insulin requirements. Consequently, there may have been selection bias and our results are not generalizable to non-critical care settings or to patients with a greater severity of illness. Second, it is notable that the group of patients who achieved normoglycemia had a higher modified Charlson Comorbidity Index score compared with the patient group that did not achieve normoglycemia. Therefore, we cannot exclude the possibility that the provider caring for these patients may have perceived them to be at higher risk for hospital-related complications and may have treated them more aggressively, resulting in better glycemic control. Third, our study was retrospective, so we may not have had complete case ascertainment and we were unable to implement a specific insulin-management strategy and examine its effects prospectively. Fourth, our patients had pre-existing diabetes, so findings may differ in individuals without pre-existing diabetes who have isolated glucocorticoidinduced hyperglycemia. Fifth, in our analysis we included only patients who were ordered a 60-gm carbohydrate-controlled diet. Unfortunately we did not have data regarding their total caloric intake or the amount of carbohydrates actually consumed, which may be impacted by anorexia, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea in the hospital setting. Finally, because of the retrospective nature of our study, there may have been residual confounding that may have influenced and biased our results.",

Future clinical trials should examine the approach of using a basal-bolus insulin ratio of 35%:65% compared with the standard basal-bolus ratio of 50%:50%, or using insulin NPH to compare the effectiveness among treatments in reaching glycemic targets for patients. Such a study would fill an important research gap recently identified by the Planning Research in Inpatient Diabetes (PRIDE) Investigators in a recent overview of gaps in our current knowledge in delivering high-quality in-patient care to patients with diabetes and hyperglycemia. 28 Flow diagram for selection of study population.
