One group of researchers reported that housing post-pubertal Sprague Dawley rats at high densities resulted in decreased muscle mass in males but not in females 20 . In another study, 56-d-old Sprague Dawley rats that were arbitrarily grouped at high densities (3 rats per cage) showed no significant differences in fighting frequency or weight gain compared with rats that were housed singly; in addition, grouphoused rats had lower blood pressure at night 3 . In several studies of adult rats that were housed at high densities with unfamiliar rats, researchers observed behavioral changes associated with fighting and dominance in males, though not in females 17, [21] [22] [23] . Studies that evaluated social behaviors related to fighting, dominance and territorial aggression reported that male rats older than 100 d showed territorial aggression and social dominance, whereas juvenile rats only showed play-fighting behavior [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] . Another researcher showed that in male Wistar rats, the behavioral and physiological effects of high-density housing were dependent on the developmental stage of the rats 27 . These reports indicate that both gender and age may affect behavioral and physiological parameters in rats housed at high densities.",

Another variable that might confound comparison between strains is the difference in group size between the HDH groups of each strain. The difference in the number of rats per cage in each strain was based on the differences in the average body weight of rats in these strains. To make comparisons between the strains, it would be beneficial to standardize the group sizes and available floor space per rat. Furthermore, group size may affect rats' behavior regardless of the amount of floor space available. In larger groups of rats, the social hierarchy is more complex than that in smaller groups, which may lead to increased incidence of aggression or stress responses.
