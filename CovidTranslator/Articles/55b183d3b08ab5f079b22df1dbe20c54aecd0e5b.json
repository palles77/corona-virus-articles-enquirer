In this study, some experiments were conducted to assess the inactivation of spores inoculated on six materials [stainless steel (SS), painted steel (PS), polyvinyl chlorid (PVC), polyurethane (PU), glass (GS), and cotton cloth (CC)] by CD gas. The main aims of the study were to determine the sporicidal efficacy of CD gas and the effect of prehumidification before decontamination on sporicidal efficacy. Methods: Material coupons (1.2 cm diameter of SS, PS, and PU; 1.0 cm\u00d71.0 cm for PVC, GS, and CC) were contaminated with 10 \u03bcl of Bacillus subtilis var. niger (ATCC 9372) spore suspension in mixed organic burden and then dried in a biosafety cabinet for 12 h. The spores were recovered by soaking the coupons in 5 ml of extraction liquid for 1 h and then vortexing the liquid for 1 min. Results: The log reductions in spore numbers on inoculated test materials exposed to CD gas [0.080% (volume ratio, v/v) for 3 h] were in the range of from 1.80 to 6.64. Statistically significant differences were found in decontamination efficacies on test material coupons of SS, PS, PU, and CC between with and without a 1-h prehumidification treatment. With the extraction method, there were no statistically significant differences in the recovery ratios between the porous and non-porous materials. Conclusions: The results reported from this study could provide information for developing decontamination technology based on CD gas for targeting surface microbial contamination.",

Therefore, a highly effective disinfection technique is required to avoid these incidents and to decontaminate the indoor environment effectively. Fumigation with the advantages of high effi-cacy, low corrosion, large disinfection volume, and simple operation was considered to be the best decontamination method and has been widely employed to sterilize indoor biological contaminants. A number of traditional fumigants such as ethylene oxide and formaldehyde have been used to decontaminate the spores on material surfaces and in biological safety cabinets (Munro et al., 1999; Rogers et al., 2007) , but their inflammability and carcinogenicity limit their use as a green decontaminant.",

            "text": "Chlorine dioxide (CD) is well known as an environment-friendly bactericide and has been successfully employed as a biocidal agent in water disinfection (Huang et al., 1997; Radziminski et al., 2002; Bergmann and Koparal, 2005; Zuo et al., 2006) and as a sanitizer for vegetable and fruit surfaces (Han et al., 2000; Mahmoud et al., 2007; Karabulut et al., (Chatuev and Peterson, 2010) and Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts (Chauret et al., 2001) . It resists the formation of trihalomethanes and is nonreactive with ammonia, thereby avoiding the formation of chloramines. Jeng and Woodworth (1990) investigated and determined the sporicidal efficacy of CD gas, the relationship between fumigant concentration and exposure time, and the influence of humidity. Recently, a systematic investigation involving quantitative experiments of laboratory-scale decontamination of building material surfaces (carpet, ceiling tile, cinder block, painted wallboard, unpainted wood, and painted I-beam steel) was initiated by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) in collaboration with the US Army, Edgewood Chemical Biological Center (US EPA, 2008) . Another systematic investigation studied the log reduction in viable spore numbers by CD gas under the given technology operation parameters and environmental conditions, and with different types of building materials (Rogers et al., 2004) . Further, recent work by Rastogi et al. (2009; has confirmed that viable spores on indoor building surfaces can be significantly reduced using CD gas. They tested the method by measuring spore recoveries from five porous materials and one nonporous building material. CD gas as a disinfectant has been successfully applied to decontaminate isolators (Czarneski and Lorcheim, 2005) , hospitals (Luftman et al., 2006) , and buildings (Wood and Martin, 2009) , and is approved by the US National Sanitation Foundation International as a sterilant for the decontamination of biological safety cabinets. Although biosafety laboratories are areas in which decontamination using CD gas could be frequently applied, detailed information on the use and efficacy of such treatments applied to laboratory material surfaces is lacking. Therefore, the main objectives of this study were to determine the sporicidal efficacy of CD gas and the effect on sporicidal efficacy of humidification before decontamination. Stainless steel (SS), painted steel (PS), polyvinyl chlorid (PVC), polyurethane (PU), glass (GS), and cotton cloth (CC) were selected as the experimental materials, based on these materials commonly found in laboratory walls, floors, interior equipment, table-boards, glassware, and cloth surfaces. Bacillus subtilis var. niger spores were chosen as the surrogate spores in this paper as Sagripanti et al. (2007) clearly established that B. subtilis, B. cereus, and B. anthracis show similar or comparable sensitivity to chemical disinfectants. CD gas was generated by the reaction of a chlorine gas-nitrogen mixture and sodium chlorite chips. This method had the advantages of producing gas of high purity with little corrosion.",

The measurement procedure was as follows: a 100-ml air sample was withdrawn from the chamber using a syringe covered with silver paper, transferred to the bottom of an iodine flask as quickly as possible, and injected into the solution (25 ml EDI water, 5 ml HAc, and 1 g KI) slowly while agitating the mixture; the flask was placed in the dark for 5 min to obtain the absorption liquid; titrating solution [0.01 mol/L sodium thiosulfate (STS)] was added to the absorption liquid until the liquid turned light-yellow; then, 5 ml of 5 g/L amylum solution was added to the absorption liquid; the titration endpoint was determined when the color of the solution changed from light-yellow to colorless; the volume of STS solution used in the titration was recorded and the concentration of CD was calculated using Eq.

(b) Spore viability was scored as \"growth\" for CC1, CC2, and the blank samples in turn Data are expressed as mean\u00b1SD with ten coupons However, prehumidification before fumigation decreased the log reduction of spores on test coupons of the nonporous test materials. Further analysis of the data showed that statistically significant differences were observed in the log reduction of spores on test materials SS, PS, PU, and CC between prehumidification and no-prehumidification experiments at a >95% confidence level. An increased surface humidification and inner humidification may have resulted in a higher probability of the CD making contact with spores and potentially increasing spore inactivation on CC, leading to a higher sporicidal efficacy of CD following the use of a prehumidification process. Further studies are required that focus on the correlative influence between the interaction of CD gas and nonporous material surfaces following prehumidification.",
