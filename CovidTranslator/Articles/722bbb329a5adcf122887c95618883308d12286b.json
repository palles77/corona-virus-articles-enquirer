In this study we evaluated the prevalence of seropositivity in feral (cats, dogs) and wild (raccoon dog, badger, American mink, Far Eastern wild cat) carnivores to various pathogens: distemper virus, parvovirus, feline immunodeficiency and feline leukemia virus, feline coronavirus, Toxoplasma gondii, Mycoplasma sp., and Chlamydia sp. It was shown that seropositivity occurred significantly more frequent in feral animals than in wild ones. The highest percentage of seropositive animals was observed in feral dogs. It is these diseases that can be dangerous for the Amur tiger and the Far East leopard, thus affecting their populations.",

An infection related popu lation decline has been documented in the lion (Pan thera leo) and the Ethiopian wolf (Canis simensis). The source of infection was feral animals, namely, dogs (Sillero Zubiri et al., 1996; Cleaveland et al., 2000) . Wild canine and feline species are susceptible to dis eases of feral cats and dogs (Sillero Zubiri et al., 1996; Deem et al., 2002) . However, little is known about the presence of infectious diseases in wild predatory mam mals, in particular, in Primorskii Krai which is the habitat for rare species such as the Siberian tiger (Pan thera tigris altaica), the Far Eastern leopard (P. pardus orientalis), and the Far Eastern Forest Cat (Prionailu rus bengalensis euptilura). Such studies are very impor tant for areas of likely introduction of the Far Eastern leopard, i.e., the Ussuriiskii and Lazovskii State Nature Reserves, Far East Branch, Russian Academy of Sciences. It is these reserves where we initiated such studies (Esaulova et al., 2009 Davydova et al., 2010; Naydenko et al., 2011) .",

The viruses causing feline panleukopenia and canine and mustelid parvoviral enteritis behave similarly in regard to pathogenesis, targeting fast dividing host cells, which results in diarrhea, suppres sion of bone marrow activity, and a sharp decline in immunity (Parrish, 1995) . Feline coronaviral enteritis is prevalent in 80% of the feral cat population and induces infectious peritonitis. This frequently ends up with death of animals (Pedersen, 1987) . Distemper considerably diminished the lion population in 1994 in the Serengeti, killing about 1000 animals (Roelke Parker et al., 1996) . The feline viral immunodefi ciency virus strongly related to HIV was detected in a feral cat and other wild feline species (Brown et al., 1994) . It induces severe immunodeficiency in feral cats by decreasing T cell numbers (Torten et al., 1991) . The feline leukemia virus has worldwide preva lence and causes anemia, immunodeficiency, and var ious lymphoid tumors (Hoover et al., 1975; Hardy et al., 1976) . Toxoplasmosis caused by the protozoa Toxoplasma gondii is a cause of abortions, nonviable offspring, central nervous system disorders, and impairment of the lymphatic and endocrine systems in adult cats, dogs, and other animals (Meli et al., 2009) . Mycoplasmosis is primarily associated with conjunc tivitis, pneumonia, polyarthritis, gastrointestinal tract diseases, spontaneous miscarriages, and infertility (Meli et al., 2009) . Clamidiosis is an acute or chronic disease of cats, dogs, and other animals and is charac terized by body temperature elevation, conjunctivitis, coryza, pneumonia, and urogenital disorders. The infection occasionally becomes delayed and shows a chronic course. During infection kittens show acute clinical signs, which tends to end up with death (Meli et al., 2009) .",

No seropositivity to other pathogens was found. More over, the absence of antibodies cannot ensure mainte nance of a population. For a small population, a dis ease incursion into one or two animals threatens most of the population like the leukemia virus outbreak in the Iberian lynx (Lynx pardina) in the Do ana National Park (Meli et al., 2009) . In feral animals we found seropositivity to 7 out of 8 pathogens tested for. Besides toxoplasma and myco plasma, seropositivity was observed to distemper virus, parvoviruses (including feline panleukopenia), immu nodeficiency virus, enteric coronavirus, and chlamy dia. The percentage of feral animals seropositive to a number of pathogens is similar to that of wild animals. Statistical differences were only observed for distem per virus in wild and feral animals (feral animals had a statistically significant frequency). Importantly, feral cats are not affected by distemper, and no seropositive result was identified. Distemper seropositive dogs were over 50%. Dog hunting (including poaching) and rear ing dogs without a leash could increase a probability of contacts of Amur tigers with virus carries (Seredkin et al., 2010) . Panthera species are sensitive to distem per virus: there is evidence that it is capable of causing neural system disorders in Amur tigers and ultimately death of tigers (Quigley et al., 2010) . In addition, the occurrence of distemper virus in tigers is quite high (Naydenko et al., 2011) .",
