            "text": "Metastasis is a complex multistep process, during which tumor cells must proliferate, invade the host stroma, enter the circulation, survive and arrest in a distant organ's capillary bed, extravasate into the organ parenchyma, and proliferate again [1, 2] . Proteolytic degradation of the extracellular matrix (ECM) is an important part of the process, and several classes of enzymes have been implicated, including matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) [3] , serine proteinases [4] , cysteine proteinases [5] , and aminopeptidases [6] . These enzymes are not only secreted by a variety of metastatic tumor cells but also by normal cells under certain conditions. Aminopeptidase N is a Zn 2 +-dependent exopeptidase that is anchored to the plasma membrane by its N-terminal segment and acts as an ectoenzyme. It has been postulated that this enzyme has multiple functions, including hydrolytic inactivation of such regulatory peptides as enkephalins. The aminopeptidase N is identical to cell surface antigen CD13, which is produced by myeloid cells and by many other types of cells [7] . For example aminopeptidase N is expressed on epithelial cells of the gut and possibly utilized as an infection receptor by enteropathogenic coronavirus, a transmissible virus that causes gastroenteritis [8, 9] . The plasma membranes of several human and rodent tumor cells have high levels of neutral aminopeptidase activity [10, 11] . We have previously reported that bestatin, a potent inhibitor of aminopeptidases, suppresses degradation and invasion of the ECM by tumor cells [6, 12] . We have also shown that anti-aminopeptidase N/CD13 monoclonai antibody, capable of inhibiting aminopeptidase, can suppress degradation and invasion of the ECM by tumor cells [13] . These findings have suggested the possible involvement of aminopeptidase N/CD13 in the molecular mechanisms of tumor cell invasion.",

Briefly, the lower surface of polyvinylpyrrolidone-free polycarbonate filters with 8.0 #m pores (Nucleopore, Pleasanton CA.) were precoated with 0.1 mg/ml of fibronectin or laminin in PBS (5 #g/filter). Matrigel was diluted to l mg/ml with cold PBS, applied to the upper surfaces of the filters (10#g/filter), and dried at room temperature under a hood. These filters were designated Matrigel/fibronectin-and Matrigel/ laminin-coated filters. The coated filters were extensively washed in PBS and then dried immediately before use. Tumor cells were harvested with 1 mM EDTA in PBS, washed three times with serum-free Eagle's minimum essential medium (EMEM), and then resuspended to a final concentration of 10 6 cells/ml in EMEM containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA). Cell suspensions (100#1 each) were added to the upper compartment and incubated for a certain period at 37\u00b0C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. The filters were fixed with methanol and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. The cells on the upper surface of the filter were removed by wiping with cotton swabs. The cells that had invaded various areas of the lower surface were manually counted under a microscope. Each assay was performed in triplicate.",

The representative results from three independent experiments are shown in Figure 2A . The abilities of the aminopeptidase N/CD 13 transfectants to invade into Matrigel/laminin-or Matrigel/fibronectincoated filters were significantly higher than those of the parental or control cells (P<0.01). There was no difference, however, in invasiveness between the parental A375M and control vector-transfected cells. These data suggest that high expression of aminopeptidase N/CD13 in the melanoma cells led to enhanced invasiveness. Next, the migratory potentials of these cells were compared. To assess haptotactic migration, tumor cells were seeded into the upper compartment of a Transwell cell culture chamber with a filter precoated with 5 ~g of fibronectin or 5/~g of laminin on the lower surface. The number of cells that migrated to the lower surface was determined after a 4 h incubation ( Figure 2B ). Migratory activity did not differ amongst these cells.

Matrigel and fibronectin promoted cell adhesion, whereas laminin did little to enhance adhesion. The extent of adhesion to fibronectin did not vary among the parental cells and transfectants, whereas the CD13 transfectants showed increased adhesion to Matrigel compared with the parental and control vectortransfected cells. However the adhesion was not inhibited by the aminopeptidase inhibitor, bestatin.",

The CD13-transfected A375M cells showed the highest levels of type IV collagen degradation, with a significance at P < 0.001 (Figure 4) . We then tried to determine whether the degradation of type IV collagen was due to enhanced secretion and activation of gelatinolytic metalloproteinases. To do this, we analyzed the cell culture supernatants by gelatin zymography and found that aminopeptidase N/CD13 expression did not correlate with secretion and activation of gelatinolytic metalloproteinases including MMP-2, MMP-3 and MMP-9 (data not shown).",

Therefore, the membrane-associated aminopeptidase N is probably involved in invasion and metastasis of a variety of tumor cells. Aminopeptidase N/CD 13 is also expressed by macrophages and fibroblasts that exhibit high motility in solid tissues [20] .

A good correlation between type IV collagenolytic activity and metastatic potential has been found using a variety of human and animal tumor cell lines [3, 14] A significant increase in collagenolytic activity was also attained by high expression of aminopeptidase N/CD13. Aminopeptidase N is a Zn2+-dependent ectoenzyme that is anchored to the plasma membrane. Localization of the enzyme was observed in the invasion edge of SN12M renal carcinoma cells attached to Matrigel [13] . The enzyme has broad specificity and is able to remove N-terminal residues from almost all unsubstituted oligopeptides except N-terminal proline or glutamic acid. Thus, aminopeptidase activity may contribute to the cascade of tumor invasion mechanisms by hydrolyzing ECM components already cleaved by other endoproteinases, such as plasmin or type IV collagenases/gelatinases [22] . Menrad et al. [19] found that human placental aminopeptidase N digested a component of the basement membrane Matrigel that may contain latent forms of type IV collagenases. Our previous experiments using zymography showed that treating the tumor cells with bestatin caused the active form of type IV collagenase to disappear [12] . These results led us to assume that the plasma membrane aminopeptidase N/CD 13 may have a role in activating type IV procollagenases. However, in our present study, gelatinase A/Mr 72000 type IV collagenase activation was not observed in the transfectants of aminopeptidase N/CD13 (data not shown). Details concerning the possible targets for aminopeptidase N and the ECM degradation cascade remain to be determined.",
