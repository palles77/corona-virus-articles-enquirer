            "text": "Viral infection of the heart is relatively common and usually of little consequence. It can, however, lead to substantial cardiac damage and severe acute heart failure. It can also evolve into the progressive syndrome of chronic heart failure. Recent studies have gone some way towards unravelling the complex mechanisms underlying the heart muscle damage that occurs after viral infection. These studies have lent support to both immune and viral mediated (independent of an immune response) cardiac damage. Acute myocarditis can present in various ways, and it may be a cause of sudden death in an otherwise healthy young adult. New treatments for viral heart disease are awaited. In the meanwhile, the haemodynamic support of patients with acute left ventricular failure caused by myocarditis should be aggressive, to allow for the possibility of spontaneous recovery. Contemporary trials of treatment in chronic heart failure secondary to dilated cardiomyopathy support the use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, adrenoceptor blockers, and spironolactone in such patients.

            "text": "After viral invasion of the myocardium, the first wave of infiltrating immune cells consists of natural killer (NK) cells. NK cells are thought to have a cardioprotective eVect by limiting virus replication. There is evidence in murine models of myocarditis that mice deficient in NK cell responses have a more severe myocarditis. 9 NK cell infiltration is accompanied by the production of various cytokines including interleukin (IL)-1 , tumour necrosis factor (TNF ), interferon, and IL-2 . These cytokines may have both beneficial and deleterious eVects on myocardial function (for review, see Matsumori 10 ) . Experimental studies have reported beneficial eVects of IL-10 on survival and subsequent myocardial function in a murine model of myocarditis, 11 and there are convincing data showing a detrimental eVect of TNF in myocarditis. 12 There are also recent data showing that the vasoconstrictor substance endothelin plays a role in the pathogenesis of myocarditis. 13 At the same time as the first wave of NK cells, there are also NK-like cells, which, unlike NK cells, cause myocardial damage by the release of perforin molecules. These form circular pore-like lesions on the membrane surface of cardiac myocytes, and contribute to myocardial cytoskeletal disruption. 14 The second wave of cells seen in the myocardium are T lymphocytes, which peak at 7-14 days after virus inoculation. This coincides with the most severe phase of myocardial damage. 15 T cells are thought to play an important role in both viral clearance and immune mediated cardiac damage. T cells have been shown to be capable of destroying virus infected cardiocytes in vitro. 16 It has been proposed that these cells may injure virally infected myocytes because of molecular mimicry-that is, myocardial antigens that bear similarities to viral protein cause T lymphocytes originally aimed at the virus to cross react with host antigen and produce myocyte damage. The products of cardiac cell destruction themselves may then stimulate further cell lysis by T cells. 17 The balance between the beneficial and detrimental eVects of the immune response in humans is less clear. A large trial of immunosuppressive treatment in patients with myocarditis failed to show a beneficial eVect in patients receiving immunosuppresion. 18 However, in a smaller trial there was a beneficial eVect of giving immune globulin to patients with myocarditis. 19 A recent study has shed some light on this dichotomy 20 (for a review, see Knowlton and BardorV 8 ) . In coxsackie B virus infected knockout mice lacking diVerent components of the cellular immune system, Opavsky et al showed that the activity of diVerent T cell subtypes was an important determinant of myocardial damage. 20 They demonstrated that the absence of both CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes markedly reduced cellular inflammation and mortality caused by coxsackie B infection. Hence selective treatment targeting subsets of immune cells may be a more eVective intervention in acute viral heart disease. The timing of any treatment is also likely to be an important determinant of eYcacy.",

Two studies came to opposite conclusions. Figulla et al suggested that the presence of enteroviral RNA in endomyocardial biopsies is a positive prognostic factor with respect to haemodynamic and clinical outcome, 37 while a prospective study from our own institution showed that the presence of enteroviral RNA in the myocardium of patients with myocarditis or dilated cardiomyopathy was an independent predictor of an adverse prognosis. 38 Persistent enteroviral and adenoviral genomes have been identified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and in situ hybridisation of the heart. In a recent study, Pauschinger et al showed that 22% of patients with left ventricular dysfunction and clinically suspected myocarditis had active enteroviral RNA replication in the myocardium. 39 In that study reverse transcriptase PCR was used to detect minus strand RNA. Transcription of minus strand RNA from the plus strand enteroviral template is the essential first step in enteroviral replication and is an indication of the active RNA replication of enteroviral genomes.",

In an elegant in vitro experiment, Wessely et al explored the eVects of low level restricted replication of enteroviral genomes in isolated cardiac myocytes, in a pattern similar to that observed in hearts with persistent viral infection. 40 The presence of viral genetic material was enough to induce cardiac filament disruption and other features of myocardial injury independent of host cell immune eVects. In a similar experiment the same group produced persuasive data supporting a role for enteroviral protease mediated disruption of the cardiac cell cytoskeleton, a recognised feature of dilated cardiomyopathy. 41 Subsequently the same group showed that transgenic mice with cardiac specific expression of full length copy of the coxsackie B virus genome developed morphological changes and abnormal excitation-contraction coupling similar to those observed in dilated cardiomyopathy. The hearts of these mice had molecular, histological, and functional features resembling human dilated cardiomyopathy, with an increase in left ventricular end diastolic and systolic dimensions, and reduced left ventricular fractional shortening. Histological examination revealed myocyte fibrosis and degeneration. 42 These studies lend convincing support to the hypothesis that low level expression of viral genome-in the absence of maturation of infectious virus progeny-can induce chronic dynamic myocardial injury.",

            "text": "The clinical characteristics of patients with active myocarditis are summarised in box 2. The majority of patients with myocarditis remain asymptomatic, as the cardiac sequelae are often subclinical and self limiting. However, myocarditis can occasionally be a devastating illness that evolves into a chronic progressive disease. Its clinical manifestations are variable and reflect abnormalities in left ventricular systolic and diastolic function and electrical activation, leading to arrhythmias or conduction defects. Mason et al carried out the largest prospective study of patients with myocarditis, 18 evaluating a series of 111 patients with dilated hearts, histological evidence of myocarditis, and a left ventricular ejection fraction of less than 45%. They produced some important clinical data about the natural history of myocarditis and showed that mortality (taken as death or the need for a heart transplant) was 20% at one year and 56% at four years. In an earlier study, data from our group showed that at six months after the index episode of acute myocarditis, 50% of patients will develop dilated cardiomyopathy; if left ventricular function was improving or normal, the prognosis was good, whereas residual left ventricular impairment was associated with a poor outcome. 43 Mason et al found that 60% of patients with myocarditis have antecedent flu-like symptoms. An interesting study which reflects these findings-in a series of patients with influenza of suYcient severity to warrant being seen by a doctor-showed that ECG abnormalities were present in about 10% of patients. 44 45 Chest pain is also a common manifestation of myocarditis. Patients can present with a clinical syndrome mimicking that of acute myocardial infarction, with chest pain, left ventricular dysfunction, and ECG evidence of myocardial injury. Subsequent necropsy examination usually shows normal coronary arteries. 46 Another not uncommon feature of myocarditis is systemic or pulmonary thromboemboli. 47 48 The mechanism of the disturbance of the coagulation pathway is unclear, but in 15% of patients with myocarditis ventricular thrombus can be detected on transthoracic echocardiography. 49 The electrical sequelae of myocarditis may become manifest as syncope, palpitations, sudden death from tachyarrhythmias (see illustrative case study, box 4), or heart block. In a Box 2: Clinical characteristics of patients with active myocarditis 18 + Age, 42 (14) years (mean (SD)) + Sex, 62% male + Flu-like symptoms, 60% + Chest pain, 35% + Raised white cell count, 24% + Increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate, 60% + Fever, 18% series of 162 subjects under the age of 40 who had sudden unexpected death, myocarditis accounted for 22% of the deaths in those under the age of 30 and 11% in those between 30 and 40. 50 Mason et al also evaluated the eVect of immunosuppressive treatment with cyclosporin and prednisolone on left ventricular function and mortality in this patient group. This trial showed that features consistent with a stronger immune response were associated with less severe initial disease, supporting the view that in patients with myocarditis a prominent immunological response may be beneficial rather than detrimental. However, there are caveats to these conclusions, as the trial did not involve early immunosuppression, and the agents used may not necessarily have been targeted at the appropriate point in the immune response.",

While on intensive care he had recurrent episodes of ventricular fibrillation requiring multiple dc shocks, but ultimately settled on treatment with intravenous lignocaine (lidocaine), amiodarone, and overdrive pacing. His resting ECG showed non-specific T wave changes ( fig 1) and he intermittently had non-sustained episodes of a broad complex, irregular tachycardia (fig 2) . Full blood count, urea and electrolytes, and liver function tests were normal. Transthoracic echocardiography showed normal left ventricular function and size. He gradually recovered without any sequelae. Electrophysiological testing revealed inducible non-sustained polymorphic ventricular tachycardia. Coronary angiography was entirely normal.

It can, however, have substantial acute haemodynamic and clinical sequelae and may lead to dilated cardiomyopathy and heart failure. Recent studies have identified key roles for the persistence and replication of viral protein within the myocardium, and for immune mediated cardiac damage in the occasionally progressive nature of the disease. The possible role of inducible nitric oxide synthase remains to be clarified. These pathophysiological studies may ultimately provide new starting points for treatment of this occasionally fatal disease. In the meantime, an aggressive approach to acute decompensation during acute myocarditis, and the use of ACE inhibitors, adrenoceptor blockers, and spironolactone for the treatment of chronic dilated cardiomyopathy, form the optimal treatments.",
