The results show that the SiO 2 nanoparticles are homogenously distributed throughout NR matrix as nano-clusters with an average size ranged from 60 to 150 nm when the SiO 2 loading is less than 6.5 wt%. At low SiO 2 contents (64.0 wt%), the NR latex (NRL) and SiO 2 particles are assembled as a core-shell structure by employing poly (diallyldimethylammonium chloride) (PDDA) as an inter-medium, and only primary aggregations of SiO 2 are observed. When more SiO 2 is loaded, secondary aggregations of SiO 2 nanoparticles are gradually generated, and the size of SiO 2 cluster dramatically increases. The thermal/thermooxidative resistance and mechanical properties of NR/SiO 2 nanocomposites are compared to the NR host. The nanocomposites, particularly when the SiO 2 nanoparticles are uniformly dispersed, possess significantly enhanced thermal resistance and mechanical properties, which are strongly depended on the morphology of nanocomposites. The NR/SiO 2 has great potential to manufacture medical protective products with high performances.",

Once the degradation begins, NR readily becomes tacky and loses mechanical integrity. NRL products have, therefore, short shelf lives and life cycles. Though various anti-ageing agents have been successfully developed for dry NR products and limited anti-ageing agents for NRL were reported by using tris (nonylated phenyl) phosphite [7] and non-water-soluble amino acids [8] , no ideal anti-ageing agents have been identified so far for medical NRL products where strict safety and hygiene are required.",

Such an improvement in combined characteristics is particularly significant at low loading levels of nano-fillers, which do not significantly increase the density of the compound or reduce light transmission. Therefore, introduction of inorganic nano-fillers into NR matrixes to overcome the aforementioned disadvantages of NR has recently attracted enormous interest. Most of these are using clay minerals with a unique multi-layered structure to reinforce NR via melt-intercalation [14, 15] , latex-compounding [16] and solution-mixing methods [17] . It was found that the organically modified clays with a loading up to 10 wt% have a good reinforcement on the NR matrix due to the intercalation/exfoliation of silicates and formation of a skeleton silicate network in NR matrix [15, 16] . Nair et al. [18] [19] [20] also used nano crab chitin whiskers to reinforce NR. It was found that there is a three-dimensional chitin network within the NR matrix, which results in significantly improved solvent resistance and mechanical properties.",

Negatively charged NRL particles are then assembled onto the surface of SiO 2 /PDDA nanoparticles. Finally, the SiO 2 nanoparticles are uniformly distributed in NR matrix. The key procedure of this process is the encapsulation of the SiO 2 nanoparticles with PDDA and NRL layers, aiming at suppressing the self-aggregation of SiO 2 nanoparticle caused by strong particle-particle interactions.",

However, due to a large difference in rigidity between SiO 2 and PDDA and the charge density of PDDA is significantly larger than that on SiO 2 , all of the former charges cannot form short-distance ion pairs with surface charges of rigid SiO 2 particles [30] . Therefore, the positive charge on PDDA cannot completely neutralized by the negative charge on SiO 2 particles during the assembly, and the SiO 2 /PDDA core-shell particles will appear positive and be ready for next assembly with negatively charged NRL particles.

If the pH is lower than the isoelectric point of NRL (4.5-5.0), basic ionization will occur and NRL particles will be positively charged.

These primary aggregations are unlikely caused by the strong particle-particle interaction, but the adsorption between polymer molecular chain and SiO 2 nanoparticles, i.e. PDDA molecular chains adsorb quite a few separate nanoparticles to form nanoclusters in the stage of assembly. Therefore, the SiO 2 is not distributed in NR matrix as individual nanoparticles, but as nano-clusters. Similar assumption was found in polyethylene oxide (PEO)/silica nanocomposites. Gunb'ko et al. [31] reported that each PEO molecules could interact with many primary fumed SiO 2 particles to form small aggregates.

A similar result was also found in PVA/SiO 2 nanocomposites where both primary and secondary aggregations were observed at a SiO2 content higher than 5 wt% [21, 23] . However, without further information, we could not explain how and why the strong aggregation starts from this critical level.

Consequently, the nanocomposite has a more complex decomposition and a pronounced improvement of ageing resistance compared to the pure NR.

The influence of SiO 2 on NR's flexibility is relatively samll at low SiO 2 loading, while it plays a critical role at high SiO 2 in reducing the elongation. The improvement in ageing resistances and mechanical properties are all dominated by the distribution of SiO 2 nanoparticles. The better the dispersion of SiO 2 , the greater the improvement in the thermal and mechanical properties.",
