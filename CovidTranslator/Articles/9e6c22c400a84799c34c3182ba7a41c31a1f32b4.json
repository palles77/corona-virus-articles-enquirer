The template molecule is KZ7088 (Chou et al., 2003, Biochem Biophys Res Commun 308: 148-151). The MDL MACCS keys were used to fingerprint the molecules. The Tanimoto coefficient is taken as the metric to compare fingerprints. If the similarity threshold was 0.8, a set of 50 unique hits and 103 conformers were retrieved as a result of similarity search. The AutoDock 3.011 was used to carry out molecular docking of 50 ligands to their macromolecular protein receptors. Three compounds, i.e., C 28 H 34 O 4 N 7 Cl, C 21 H 36 O 5 N 6 , and C 21 H 36 O 5 N 6 , were found that may be promising candidates for further investigation. The main feature shared by these three potential inhibitors as well as the information of the involved side chains of SARS Cov Mpro may provide useful insights for the development of potent inhibitors against SARS enzyme.",

A new coronavirus (SARS CoV), a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus Gao et al., 2003; Du et al., 2005a, b) , has been found as the etiological agent of the disease SARS. SARS CoV main proteinase (Mpro) cleaves the polyprotein at no less than 11 conserved sites, a process initiated by the enzyme's own autolytic cleavage from pp1a and pp1ab Yang et al., 2003) . The released polypeptides mediate all of the functions required for SARS viral replication and transcription. The functional importance of the Mpro in the viral life cycle makes it an attractive target for the drugs design against SARS Yang et al., 2003; Chou et al., 2003 Chou et al., , 2004 . Anand et al. (2003) proposed a homology model of the Mpro based on the experimental Mpro structures of human coronavirus (HCoV) and porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) complex. The experimental structure of SARS CoV Mpro was first determined by Yang et al. (2003) . They provided several crystal structures of SARS CoV Mpro at different pH conditions and the complex structure of SARS CoV Mpro with ligand hexapeptidyl CMK Yang et al., 2003) . The experimental structure and the theoretical homology structure of SARS CoV Mpro share many structural similarities, such as the catalytic active region and the Cys-His cleavage dyad Yang et al., 2003) . However, there are several differences between the theoretical and the experimental structures. For examples, the experimental structure of SARS CoV Mpro is a dimer, the protomer A has catalytic activity, and the protomer B has no activity. However, the N finger of protomer B, which plugs in the active cleft of protomer A, plays an important role in both dimerization and maintenance of the active form of the enzyme (Yang et al., 2003) . These new findings from the experimental structure of SARS CoV Mpro provide a reliable basis for inhibitor design. Meanwhile, it was suggested that suggested that the rhinovirus 3Cpro inhibitor AG7088 could well serve as a starting point for an anti-SARS drug based on the theoretical homology model of SARS CoV Mpro. Chou et al. (2003) and Chou (2004) found the fitting problem of AG7088 to the binding pocket of SARS CoV Mpro, and they suggested its derivative KZ7088 as a better starting point. By conducting the virtual screening for SARS-CoV protease based on KZ7088 pharmacophore points, Sirois et al. (2004 Sirois et al. ( , 2005 found 7083 unique hits without volume constraints and 2589 unique hits with volume constraints. Virtual screening has the advantages of being less expansive and easier to perform than the real experiments in searching for lead compounds; i.e., calculations could be performed on compounds that are not yet purchased or synthesized (Rayer, 2002) . Therefore, it was widely used to find initial lead structures from a large collection of compounds. Besides the studies of Siroirs et al. (2004) , other groups also reported work of screening the inhibitor of SARS (Xiong, 2003) . In the present study, by means of systematic search and molecular docking, we filtered the 2,589 candidates retrieved by Sirois et al. (2004) , and found some interesting results as reported below.",

(2004) , we obtained a collection of 1386 druggable compounds that both match the 3D KZ7088 pharmacophore points and satisfy the druggable rules with a scoring value !0.8. To further narrow down the investigation scope for molecular docking, a similarity search of the 1,386 compounds were performed by using KZ7088 (Chou et al., 2003; Chou, 2004) as the template molecule. The compounds thus obtained were placed in a database. The fingerprints (Sheridan et al., 1996; Brown and Martin, 1996) of the temperate molecule and each of these compounds in the database were calculated. The MDL MACCS keys were used to fingerprint the molecules. The MACCS fingerprint consists of a set of indicators showing whether each of the 166 MACCS keys was found to be present in a given molecule. The fingerprint is stored internally as a vector of indices, where the presence of an index in the vector indicates the presence of the corresponding substructure in the molecule. Once a fingerprint is derived from a chemical structure, a metric is needed to compare the fingerprints. A common metric is the Tanimoto coefficient (Morris et al., 1988) , which is a number between 0 and 1, where 0 means ''maximally dissimilar'' and 1 means ''maximally similar''. If the similarity threshold was assigned as 0.8, a set of 50 unique hits and 103 conformers were retrieved as an outcome of the similarity search.",

AutoGrid pre-calculates a three-dimensional grid of interaction energies based on the macromolecular target using the AMBER force field. AutoDock performs the task of the docking. First, the ligand moves randomly in any one of six degrees of freedom, namely 3 translation degrees and 3 rotation degrees , and the energy of the new ligand ''state'' is calculated. If the energy of the new state is lower than that of the old state, the new one is automatically accepted as the next step in docking as the procedure used in (Chou and Carlacci, 1991; Chou, 1992) .",

Therefore, after ranking the 20-top conformers according to their low energies, the ligands were further carefully checked according to the aforementioned factors as well.

An example of hydrogen bonding between ligand 4 and the participating residues of Mpro is shown in Fig. 4 .

From the frequency of the residue's occurrence in the formation of hydrogen bonding, His-164 plays an important role, which may be due to the polar hydrogens of its imidazole ring being a perfect hydrogen bond donor. And Gly-174, Met-165, and Thr-175 also take part in the hydrogen bonding with relatively high frequency. This information could be helpful for our drug design in which the potential drug should interact well with these residues, especially with His-164.

In our study, the process of the ligand-receptor surface buried in each other is just like the case of protein folding. So in further rational drug design it is critic to identify the hydrophobic groups of the ligand and receptor and ensure that they are facing each other upon binding.",

Although there are three hydrogen bonds in the complex, its Gibbs free energy is still 10 kal=mol higher than that of ligand 4. That means steric complementarity is supposed to be responsible for the micro-mechanical interlock at molecular level which is suggested by Vaidyanathan et al. (2001) . The primary driving force for mechanical interlocking is the steric complementarity between the ligand and the collagen receptor site. Once mechanical interlocking is facilitated by steric complementarity, other binding interactions may also occur. Therefore our further drug design or modification of the lead compounds must first take the steric configuration into account.",
