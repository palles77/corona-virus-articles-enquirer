R0 was estimated to be 1.70 and 1.78 based on two different formulas. For 39 (6.64%) cases, the incubation periods were longer than 14 days. In 102 (43.78%) infector-infectee pairs, transmission occurred before infectors' symptom onsets. In 27 (3.92%) infector-infectee pairs, infectees' symptom onsets occurred before those of infectors. Stratified analysis showed that incubation period and serial interval were consistently longer for those with less severe disease and for those whose primary cases had less severe disease.

The two parameters have important implications for the monitoring, surveillance and control of infectious disease. The mean or median incubation period and serial interval estimated by previous studies were mostly 4 to 5 days, 2-7 and 4 to 4.5 days, [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] respectively. While some of the studies included only a limited number of cases (around or less than 100), 2, 4, 6, 7, [9] [10] [11] [12] others might have suffered from inaccuracy of original data. For example, in some studies, most cases had a long or even unclear interval of exposure, making it difficult to determine the exact exposure date 3, 5, 13 and giving rise to error. Besides, the order of transmission (i.e., who is infector and who is infectee) in clustering cases, which is crucial to estimation of both parameters, is easy to be mistaken given the possibility of pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic transmission, [14] [15] [16] [17] but previous studies rarely described how this issue was handled.",

For a disease that is not infectious until onset of symptoms, latent period is equivalent to incubation period, and infectious period can commonly be approximated by the difference of serial interval minus incubation period. 18 However, for COVID-19, the latent period appears to be shorter than incubation period as pre-symptomatic transmission might occur, 16, 17 and this should be accounted for when estimating R0. To our best knowledge, no published studies estimated the latent period of COVID-19, or how often and approximately at which time point the disease could be transmitted prior to the symptomatic onset.",

First, the sample size is generally small in previous studies, 2, 4, 6, 7, [9] [10] [11] [12] but much larger in the present one. Second, most cases in previous studies had a long or even unclear interval of exposure, making it difficult to determine the exact exposure date 3, 5, 13 and giving rise to error. By contrast, this study followed strict inclusion criteria regarding exposure period and method to determine exposure date to ensure the potential error in the estimates be small (< 0.3 day, according to the sensitivity analysis). Third, the approaches to determination of transmission order within clusters are different. For the cases involving cluster infection, which represent the majority of all cases, a common practice of previous studies was to take the case with earliest date of symptom onset as infector and others as infectee. 9 However, we deemed it inappropriate in view of the varying incubation periods of individuals and potential pre-symptomatic or asymptomatic transmission.",

First, the cases were retrieved from publicly available reports, and many cases were excluded because there were no details available for estimating the parameters. Thus, the representativeness of cases could be a concern. A comparison of the age and sex of included cases with those of 72314 cases in China showed that they are generally similar. 29 Previous studies suggested that publicly reported cases may overrepresent the severe ones. However, based on 329 cases (28.48%) with relevant information available, non-severe cases appeared to account for a higher proportion in the present study than in the previous one on 72314 cases in China. The second limitation of this study is that the upper limit of latent period was based on only 11 pairs of infector-infectee. Larger studies are needed to obtain a more robust estimate. The third limitation is that by using the upper limit of latent period instead of the real latent period in formula (2), in our case, could lead to a slightly smaller value of R0.",

The estimates of serial interval, time point of exposure and latent period provide consistent evidence on pre-symptomatic transmission. Asymptomatic transmission was also observed.

Google and Baidu were searched to identify public media reports quoting government departments, which were normally based on official press releases. Chinese words for the following terms were used to do the search: ('family' OR 'household') AND ('cluster' OR 'dinner' OR 'party') AND 'infection'. Other countries reporting COVID-19 cases were identified according to the 'coronavirus disease (COVID-19) situation reports' by World Health Organization. 22 For Japan and Singapore, the information of confirmed cases was retrieved from their respective Ministry of Health. For Malaysia and Vietnam, public media reports quoting government sources were adopted. The dates of search for the four countries varied from February 29 to March 2, 2020.",
