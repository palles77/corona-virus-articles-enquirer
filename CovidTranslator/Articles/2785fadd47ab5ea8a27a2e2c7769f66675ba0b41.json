Expression of their genomes begins with the translation of two large replicase polyproteins, pp1a (44,000 residues) and pp1ab (47,000 residues), which are encoded by the viral replicase gene that comprises open reading frame 1a (orf1a) and orf1b 1 . pp1a and pp1ab are extensively processed by orf1a-encoded proteases to yield 15 or 16 mature nonstructural (replicase) proteins that assemble to form the membrane-associated viral replication and transcription machinery, which is vital to the viral life cycle 2 . Together with a number of cellular factors, this machinery synthesizes not only genome-sized RNA but also a nested set of eight subgenomic mRNAs. These subgenomic mRNAs are predicted to express all ORFs downstream of orf1b, encoding a variety of structural and accessory proteins [3] [4] [5] . Knowledge of the structure and organization of coronavirus replication and transcription machinery at the molecular level is limited. However, the extraordinary size of the coronavirus replicative polyproteins, their generally large phylogenetic distance from those of other RNA viruses and the presence of several predicted RNA-processing activities that are not found in other positive-stranded RNA viruses suggest that this machinery is of unparalleled complexity 3, 6, 7 .",

Its genome is B29.7 kilobases long (excluding the 3\u00a2 poly(A) tail) and is predicted to contain 14 functional ORFs 3-5 , encoding 16 replicase proteins, 4 structural proteins and 8 accessory proteins 3 .

The activities of a papain-like protease (PL2 pro , also known as nsp3), a main protease (M pro , also known as 3CL pro or nsp5), a single-stranded (ss) RNA-binding protein (nsp9), an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp, also known as nsp12), a superfamily 1-like helicase (HEL1, also known as nsp13) and a uridylate-specific endoribonuclease (NendoU, also known as nsp15) were recently established and characterized 3, 6, [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] .

Our experiments suggest that the supercomplex could encircle RNA and could function as a general processivity factor for RdRp (nsp12).

The shaft domain contains three helices (NH1-3), one of which (NH3) is very long. Another three a-helices (CH1-3) and seven b-strands (b1-7) form the head domain, which has an a/b fold.

More than half the residues in the C-terminal domain are hydrophobic, and the whole domain forms a tight hydrophobic core. nsp8II (chains E and F) resembles a golf club with a bent shaft (Fig. 2c) . Although its head domain is similar to that of nsp8I (r.m.s. deviation o 0.5 \u00c5 ), the shaft helix NH3 bends into two shorter helices, NH3a and NH3b, linked by a coil, C3 ( Supplementary  Fig. 1 ). Residues before Leu43 on chain E and residues before Asp55 on chain F could not be assigned from the electron density map. SDS-PAGE analysis of the supercomplex crystals showed that their absence was not due to protein degradation or cleavage; thus, the flexibility of the peptide resulting from crystal packing might be the reason. The presence of two conformations of nsp8 agrees with the results of PONDR analysis 23 , which strongly suggests that residues 43-84 of nsp8 are disordered.",

In other structures, homologous multimers of one type always stack on those of another type as layers with high degrees of symmetry. The absence of any one kind of protein markedly affects the global shape of the complex. Two such examples are the structures of the multienzyme complex Rubisco 24 and the GroEL-GroES-ATP complex 25 . In contrast, the relationship between nsp7 and nsp8 multimers in the supercomplex is not stacking but cross-linking. nsp8I and nsp8II constitute the framework of the supercomplex as 'bricks,' and nsp7 stabilizes and fills this configuration as 'mortar.' Loss of nsp7 should not markedly change the shape of the structure (Fig. 3d) .

The relationships between the 16 monomers are shown in Supplementary Figure 3 online.

We found that the four long helices of nsp8I could insert into the grooves of dsRNA and the positively charged residues on these helices are conserved in all homologous coronavirus nsp8 proteins. To test whether these residues are related to nucleic acid binding, we identified several basic residues located around the channel ( Supplementary Fig. 6 online) and designed three mutants: nsp7m (nsp7 R26A K32A), nsp8m1 (nsp8 K77A R80A) and nsp8m2 (nsp8 K63A R84A R85A). We then performed electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) to examine the nucleic acid binding affinity of each mutant. The results showed that the nucleic acid binding affinities of nsp8m1 and nsp8m2 were much weaker than that of the wild-type protein, whereas mutations in nsp7 Figure 3 Architecture and assembly of the hexadecameric nsp7-nsp8 complex.

With a calculated isoelectric point of 6.5, nsp8 should not bind nucleic acids by electrostatic interaction, unlike basic proteins. As nsp8 contains a total of 22 positively charged residues (lysines and arginines), the change in overall charge caused by the loss of two or three of these should not result in a marked change in affinity. Furthermore, the mutations did not affect supercomplex formation and stability, as we ascertained by gel filtration and crystallization experiments (data not shown). The only explanation is that the locations of these mutated residues make them essential for nucleic acid binding. As they are all located around the central channel, we conclude that the channel should encircle nucleic acid. In addition, the results of EMSAs showed that nsp8 mutants have higher affinity for dsRNA than for dsDNA, as they could still bind dsRNA but hardly bound dsDNA. This suggests that dsRNA is the likely natural binding partner of the nsp7-nsp8 supercomplex.",

Coincidentally, experiments on MHV have shown that RdRp co-immunoprecipitates with nsp8, nsp9, nsp5 (main protease, also called M pro or 3CL pro ) and nsp13 (helicase) 30 , which also implies an interaction between RdRp and the nsp7-nsp8 hexadecamer. Their remarkably large genomes and putative proofreading activities suggest that coronaviruses may differ from other RNA viruses and share unprecedented similarities with DNA-based life forms in the mechanisms of genome biosynthesis 6 . The hexadecamer might be a factor that binds and trails RdRp, conferring high processivity on it for efficient replication of the extremely large coronavirus genome.

On the basis of the nsp7-nsp8 hexadecameric structure, the most probable nsp9binding site should be in the region formed by the N-terminal 50 residues of nsp8II, which is located at the entrance of the channel and has high flexibility with missing electron density. Wrapping of ssRNA around the nsp9 dimer is suggested by the nsp9 structure and by a study using tryptophan fluorescence quenching 19 . We therefore consider that the function of the nsp9 dimer might be to protect the newly unwinding nascent and template strands emerging from the channel of the nsp7-nsp8 complex, which have not yet formed a stable secondary structure, from nuclease processing.",

Sixteen molecules associate tightly with one another to form a handled hollow cylindrical structure in which the coexistence of two conformations (nsp8I and nsp8II) is observed. Its novel architecture and unique mode of assembly should provide new insights in the field of macromolecular complex structures. Designing peptides or nonpeptidyl compounds that mimic the interaction interface between nsp7 and nsp8 is one strategy to block supercomplex formation and interfere with virus replication. Besides M pro , this structure could provide a new candidate for drug design targeting those serious diseases caused by SARS-CoV, HCoV-229E and HCoV-HKU1.",

The proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3) as GST fusion proteins. A selenomethionyl (SeMet) derivative of nsp7 was prepared using the method of methioninebiosynthesis pathway inhibition 32 . The GST fusion proteins were first purified by glutathione affinity column. The GST was released by GST-rhinovirus 3C protease (Amersham Biosciences), leading to five additional residues (GPLGS) at the N terminus, and SeMet-nsp7 and nsp8 were further purified by Superdex 200 (10/30) gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences) in 25 mM sodium HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA and 5 mM DTT (pH 7.5). nsp8 was then mixed with B1 molar excess of SeMet-nsp7 and passed over the Superdex 200 column in the same buffer.
