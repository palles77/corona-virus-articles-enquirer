To fully understand the subtle changes associated with disease, one must be familiar with the physical examination findings and behavior of the healthy foal. Healthy, term foals are precocious neonates that can stand and nurse from the udder within 2 hours of delivery. Practice Tip: An easy rule of thumb is the \"1,2,3\" rule: most foals should stand by 1 hour, they should nurse by 2 hours, and the placenta should be passed by the mare within 3 hours postpartum. Normal vital signs change dramatically within the first 24 hours of life (Table 31 -1).",

The mucous membranes of a healthy neonate quickly become pale pink with a capillary refill time (CRT) of 1 to 2 seconds. Pale mucous membranes suggest anemia or hypovolemia, whereas pale yellow mucous membranes are consistent with the presence of icterus, as occurs with neonatal isoerythrolysis; hepatopathy; and occasionally, sepsis. \u2022 Gray or slightly blue mucous membranes indicate shock, poor peripheral perfusion, or hypoxemia. Cyanosis appears only if the PaO 2 is <35 to 45 mm Hg and only when the packed cell volume (PCV) is within the normal range. Tissue or organ damage may begin when PaO 2 is <60 mm Hg. \u2022 Practice Tip: Do not rely on mucous membrane color to diagnose hypoxemia. \u2022 Hyperemic, injected mucous membranes and hyperemic coronary bands may indicate sepsis, systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), or fetal inflammatory response syndrome (FIRS).

It can have side effects such as increased pulmonary pressure and respiratory alkalosis, which should be avoided in foals with lung immaturity and cerebral injury, respectively. \u2022 Caffeine administration has also been used to manage abnormally slow respiratory rate, hypoventilation, and respiratory acidosis resulting from central respiratory center depression. Administer 10 mg/kg PO or per rectum as a loading dose, followed by 2.5 to 3 mg/kg PO once daily as a maintenance dose. Therapeutic trough serum concentration is 5 to 25 \u00b5g/mL. Toxicity (CNS signs) is associated with concentrations greater than 40 to 50 \u00b5g/mL, but these concentrations are rarely achieved in foals. \u2022 Practice Tip: Caffeine is not as effective as doxapram for the treatment of hypoventilation.",

            "text": "\u2022 Hypoglycemia is managed initially with a glucose infusion best administered as a constant infusion at a rate of 4 to 8 mg/kg per minute. This is accomplished by administration of dextrose in fluids as a 5% to 10% solution in maintenance fluids or as a 50% dextrose solution administered through a separate syringe piggy-backed into the maintenance fluid line. The 50% solution should not be administered without diluting in fluids because it is hypertonic and potentially injurious to the endothelium. \u2022 Clinical Example: At this rate, a 50-kg foal would receive 120 to 240 mL of 10% dextrose per hour diluted in crystalloids. Do not give foals bolus infusions of 50% dextrose. \u2022 Caloric requirements: A healthy foal consumes 15% to 25% (or higher) of its body weight daily in milk, which equals 81 to 135 kcal/ kg per day. Sepsis and fever are believed to increase caloric requirements to 150 kcal/kg per day in ambulatory or active foals; however, this may not be true in all cases, and foals that are recumbent and weak likely have reduced caloric requirements even when septic. Many ill foals gain weight on 10% body weight equivalent feeding (~50 to 54 kcal/kg per day) likely because of decreased energy requirements associated with recumbency and lack of normal activity. Studies have suggested the energy requirement of recumbent, sick foals is as low as 43 to 55 kcal/kg/day. \u2022 Enteral feeding: Use mare's milk, foal milk replacer, goat's milk, or a combination. \u2022 Gentamicin: 6.6 mg/kg IV q24h, and up to 10 mg/kg IV q24h in foals <7 days of age. Peak and trough concentrations should be monitored; ideally peak should be \u226510 times the MIC and trough <1 \u00b5g/mL at 20 to 23 hours after administration. If MIC data are not available, the 1-hour postadministration peak should be \u226520 \u00b5g/mL. Note: Gentamicin is believed to be potentially more nephrotoxic than amikacin in very young foals; use with caution and only in well-hydrated foals. Serial monitoring of plasma creatinine should be performed while foals are treated with gentamicin. Note: Many gram-negative organisms may be resistant to gentamicin. \u2022 Ceftiofur sodium: 2 to 10 mg/kg IV q12h; 5 mg/kg IV q 12 h for most uses; may also be administered SQ (Hall et al, 2011) . In foals with renal insufficiency, longer treatment intervals are recommended because of reduced clearance. One can use ceftiofur in combination with aminoglycoside (i.e., amikacin) coverage for increased gram-negative and Staphylococcus spectrum. \u2022 Recently the continuous rate infusion (CRI) of ceftiofur has been described (Wearn et al, 2013) . CRI administration is an alternative administrative method for ceftiofur in foals. Because it is a time-dependent antimicrobial, maintenance of plasma concentrations above the MIC of the microbe for the entire dosing interval is optimal. The recommended dose to achieve plasma steady-state concentrations of 2 \u00b5g/mL, based on experimental data (Wearn et al, 2013) is: \u25cb Bolus loading dose of 1.26 mg/kg \u25cb Follow immediately by a CRI of 2.86 \u00b5g/kg/min to maintain plasma concentrations of desfuroylceftiofur (DCA) \u22652 \u00b5g/mL (total daily dose, approximately 5.4 mg/kg/day). For more resistant bacteria (MIC >2 \u00b5g/mL), higher dose rates are required. \u2022 Ceftiofur crystalline-free acid 4 can also be used in foals. The labeled dose of 6.6 mg/kg, administered subcutaneously (SQ) q72h is effective against only 79% of bacterial isolates obtained from foals (it is expected to be effective against bacteria with a MIC \u2264 0.5 \u00b5g/mL (Hall et al, 2011) . To increase the spectrum of activity, the dose needs to be increased and the administration interval may need to be decreased; requires additional pharmacokinetic studies. Swellings at the injection site are common. \u2022 Ticarcillin/clavulanic acid: 50 to 100 mg/kg IV q6h; indicated for Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections susceptible to the drug.",

Peak airway pressure should be kept at a minimum level, preferably less than 30 cm H 2 O to prevent barotrauma. Increased PaCO 2 can be tolerated (permissive hypercapnia) as long as pH is acceptable and there are no signs of carbon dioxide narcosis or deleterious cardiovascular effects. FiO 2 should be kept as low as is practical to minimize oxygen toxicity of the lungs, eyes, and other organs. Prolonged FiO 2 at >50% to 60% may result in oxygen toxicity. \u2022 Mild to moderate hypoventilation is treated with doxapram in foals with neurogenic-origin hypoventilation. This includes foals with peripartum asphyxia. A constant rate infusion of doxapram is used (0.01 to 0.05 mg/kg/min). Foals receiving doxapram should be monitored for hyperexcitation, agitation, and even seizures. Two studies have reported increased efficacy of doxapram in treating neonatal foal hypoventilation as compared with caffeine.",
