            "text": "Marek's disease (MD) in chickens is caused by Gallid herpesvirus 2 (GaHV-2) or Marek's disease virus (MDV). Hereafter, this virus is referred to as MDV. MDV is a highly prevalent alpha-herpesvirus and the disease it causes is characterized by transient neurological signs and immunosuppression at early stages that could subsequently be followed by lymphoma formation in various visceral organs in susceptible birds. Upon infection via inhalation, in all infected birds, MDV is taken to various lymphoid organs, such as spleen, thymus and bursa of Fabricius where early cytolytic infection in B cells that proceeds to latent infection of T cells occurs. While a lifelong latent phase could occur in genetically MD-resistant birds and in those protected by vaccination, late reactivation of latent virus in susceptible birds could cause transformation of mainly CD4+ T cells, leading to lymphoma formation. Meanwhile, active replication of MDV occurs in feather follicles of infected birds regardless of their genetic susceptibility rendering them a continuous source of infectious viruses (Baigent and Davison, 2004) . Although MD is currently controlled by vaccination, there have been periodical MD outbreaks caused by new strains of MDV with increased virulence (Witter, 1997) . The potential of MDV to evolve and overcome vaccinal immunity is considered as a major threat for a sustainable MD control strategy. However, many aspects of MDV-host interactions are still being elucidated (Baaten et al., 2004) .",

            "text": "To date, several studies have been conducted to examine host gene expression in response to MDV infection on a relatively large scale using various genomic techniques, such as microarrays. Changes in gene expression of chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEF) infected with RB1B, a very virulent strain of MDV, were studied by Morgan et al. (2001) using a microarray containing 1126 expressed sequence tags. These authors reported the differential expression of a number of host genes including those associated with inflammation, antigen presentation and cell growth. An in vivo study by our group using the same virus strain and a small-scale microarray has revealed significant changes in the expression of genes encoding cell surface molecules, transcription and signal transduction molecules as well as cytokines (Sarson et al., 2006) . While studies of this nature, in the context of MD in particular and various other viruses in general (reviewed in Piersanti et al., 2004) would certainly enhance our understanding of hostpathogen interactions, further expansion of this knowledge with proteomic studies is still important (reviewed in Burgess, 2004; Zhang et al., 2005) . This is partly because of the possible inconsistency between the expression of genes at the transcript and protein levels (Gygi et al., 1999) . Furthermore, viruses can induce post-translational modifications in host proteins without affecting the mRNA expression (Liu et al., 2001) . Fig. 1 .

Several other proteomic studies in the context of MD have been conducted to model the proteome of MDVtransformed CD4+ T lymphocytes in vitro. Notably, proteomic modeling of MDV-transformed CD30 hi CD4+ T lymphocytes has suggested that these cells exhibit a regulatory T cell phenotype (Buza and Burgess, 2007; Shack et al., 2008) . Further, such studies have been able to describe the fundamental differences between MDV-transformed T cells and their non-transformed healthy counterparts with regard to activated signalling pathways . With respect to viral protein expression, Liu et al. (2006) identified a number of unique proteins expressed during the lytic phase of MDVinfected CEF using a mass spectrometry-based proteomic approach. These studies highlight the potential of various proteomic tools in understanding the dynamics of host-pathogen interactions during various phases of MD.",

Moreover, several spots contained peptides generated from multiple proteins. While we have used the protein with the highest relative abundance under corresponding spot number throughout our discussion, the complete list of spots with multiple identities has been provided as supplementary Table 1 .",

In addition, there was some degree of disagreement between the expected and experimental molecular weights in case of some of the proteins. This could be due to several reasons. First, some proteins exist as different isoforms (therefore different pI) as well as different intermediate stages between translation and functionally mature form (i.e. pre-pro-and pro-forms of protein). This could change the molecular weight and/or the isoelectric point (for example, please see the discussion regarding different spots of CathD below). Another reason is possible protein degradation between sample collection and processing. Interestingly, no protein with multiple matches showed any specific migration pattern in our 2D gels (such as trains of spots). While current data are not enough to determine the exact reason for such discrepancies, it should be noted that several previous studies using 2D gels have also reported the presence of similar patterns of proteins with multiple spots (Dupont et al., 2008; Liu et al., 2008; Saldanha et al., 2008; Zheng et al., 2008) .",

In our study, we identified three differentially regulated proteins, namely ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase L3 (UCHL3), proteasome (prosome, macropain) subunit beta type 7 (PSMB7) and predicted protein similar to mouse proteasome 26S subunit ATPase 5 (PSMC5) (also known as mSUG1), which are involved in UPP (Table  1) . Among them, chicken UCHL3 (alias UCH-6) has 86% amino acid similarity with its human counterpart (Baek et al., 1999) , which is a deubiqutinating enzyme (DUB) that functions as a negative regulator of ubiquitination of proteins as well as facilitates recycling of ubiquitin. Increasing evidence suggests that DUBs are important regulators of many cellular processes such as endocytosis, apoptosis and various signalling pathways (Wing, 2003) . Several virus-encoded proteins such as Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-encoded Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen 1 and herpes simplex virus (HSV-1) regulatory protein ICP0 have been shown to interact with DUBs for viral survival in infected cells (reviewed in Lindner, 2007) . Although there is a high amino acid identity between human UCH-L3 and chicken UCH-6, they differ with respect to their substrate specificity and tissue distribution (Baek et al., 1999) . Therefore, the chicken ortholog of UCH-L3 may not have a similar role in viral infections. More functional studies are needed to understand the significance of the down-regulation of UCHL3 in MDV infection.",

In this process, three constitutive beta subunits of the 20S proteasome, namely delta, X and Z (PSMB7), are replaced by IFN-\u03b3 inducible low molecular mass peptide (LMP)-7, LMP-2 and multicatalytic endopeptidase complex-like (MECL) catalytic subunits, respectively (Griffin et al., 1998) . Although we could not detect upregulation of IFN-\u03b3 inducible subunits, given the reciprocal regulation between constitutive and IFN-\u03b3 inducible subunits (Hisamatsu et al., 1996) , down-regulation of PSMB7 may indicate the effect of induced IFN-\u03b3. In line with that, MDV is known to induce IFN-\u03b3 in chickens as early as 3 dpi and remains up-regulated until at least 15 dpi (Xing and Schat, 2000) . Moreover, although MDV is capable of down-regulating MHC-I expression in vitro, elevated IFN-\u03b3 has been shown to reverse the effect of MDV on MHC-I (Levy et al., 2003) . Our present observations do not provide evidence for differential regulation of MHC-I expression. However, given the possible enhancement of immunoproteasome activity, it is conceivable that there is an enhanced MHC-I-mediated antigen presentation.",

MHC-II expression is reduced in the absence of the expression of SUG1 (Bhat et al., 2008) . In agreement with this, the observed absence of predicted protein, mSUG1 in infected birds is associated with a significant decrease in the expression of the MHC class II alpha chain (B-LA) in infected spleens at 7 dpi. Reduction of the MHC-II expression is known to be a predominant way of evading the host immune response by a number of viruses including herpesviruses (Hegde et al., 2003) . In agreement with our present observation of down-regulation of MHC-II expression, previous work from our laboratory showed that MDV infection causes significant downregulation of invariant (Ii) chain gene expression in the chicken spleen tissue (Sarson et al., 2006) . In contrast to this observation, Niikura et al. (2007) have shown an up-regulation of MHC-II in bursa cells of chickens infected with Md11, another very virulent strain of MDV. However, in contrast to our present infection model which used outbred SPF chickens, they have used chickens from a cross between two inbred lines, 15I 5 and 7 1 , both of which are susceptible to MD (Bacon et al., 2000) . Therefore, it is possible that the difference in genetic background of infected birds may have, at least in part, contributed to these contradicting observations.",

Herpesviruses are known to interact with the actin filament system and its regulatory protein, Rho GTPase, at various stages of infection (Favoreel et al., 2007) . In addition to actins, here we have identified a Rho GTPase regulatory protein, D4-GDI, as a protein that was differentially expressed in spleen of infected chickens (discussed in detail elsewhere in the Discussion). This may indicate a putative role of the same system in the context of MDV infection. Schumacher et al. (2005) showed that MDV-encoded US3 ortholog protein causes depolymerization of the actin stress fibers. However, its role in MDV replication and/or spreading is still unclear. Stathmin 1 (STMN1), which also plays a role in the regulation of the microtubule system, has been shown to be up-regulated in EBV-infected B lymphocytes in human as early as 7 dpi (Baik et al., 2007) . In the present study, we could not detect changes in STMN1 in spleen at 7 dpi. However, the expression of this protein was induced by 21 dpi. As a possible result of regulation by STMN1, TUBB2B, which is a component of the microtubule filament system, also showed a similar pattern of expression in MDV-infected spleen tissues. However, if that change has any direct relationship with the STMN1 is not known. Apart from its interaction with the microtubule system, STMN1 has been shown to interact with heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) proteins, particularly with heat shock cognate 70 (HSC70) (Manceau et al., 1999) . In line with that, we have also identified significant changes in the expression of HSP70 proteins, including HSC70.",

The nucleocapsids of herpesviruses acquire a temporary envelope from the inner nuclear membrane before egress by budding off from the infected cell nuclei (Granzow et al., 2001) . In line with that, Camozzi et al. (2008) have reported various biochemical and structural modulations, including mislocalization of lamin proteins in the nuclear envelope of cells infected with human cytomegalovirus. Although Camozzi et al. (2008) did not observe any quantitative changes in the expression of lamin proteins, qualitative changes in the expression of the same protein have been described in infections with several other viruses such as IBDV (Zheng et al., 2008) , enterovirus 71 (Leong and Chow, 2006) and SARS-associated coronavirus (Jiang et al., 2005) . Similar to the other members of the family, MDV particles egress from the nucleus of infected cells through budding (Baigent and Davison, 2004) . Therefore, it is conceivable that the up-regulation of LMNB2 protein observed in the present experiment is, at least partly, the result of such interaction.",

For example, HSV-1 encoded protein, ICP34.5, interacts with PCNA of infected cells, presumably preventing virus-induced translational arrest (Brown et al., 1997; Harland et al., 2003) .

EEF2 was among the proteins that were up-regulated at both 7 and 14 dpi. Increased levels of EEF2 have been shown in response to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) protein, Vpr, and have been shown to have the potential of preventing Vpr-mediated apoptosis in CD4+ T cells (Zelivianski et al., 2006) . D4-GDP-dissociation inhibitor (D4-GDI) (also known as Ly-GDI) was differentially regulated in infected birds compared to uninfected controls. As mentioned above, Ly-GDI represents a group of proteins i.e. GDI, which are involved in the regulation of another group of proteins, Rho family GTPases. Apart from its involvement in the organization of the cytoskeleton, Rho-GTPases are also involved in cell signalling and proliferation. GDIs are involved in the regulation of shifting of Rho GTPase between the active GTP-bound form and the inactive GDP-bound form. Our present observations showed a more than 5-fold increase of an 18.4 kDa D4-GDI spot while there was a significant decrease of the presumably intact protein of 27 kDa. While activation as well as apoptosis of different types of cells in response to viral infections has been well documented, our present observations may highlight some of the molecules involved in these processes in the context of MDV infection.",

There were two spots with molecular weight of approximately 13 and 28 kDa which were up-regulated, while another one (39.2 kDa) was down-regulated. CathD is synthesized as a single chain pre-pro-enzyme and after being cleaved into several successive intermediates, it forms the mature 34 + 14 kDa form consisting of a heavy and a light chain in the lysosome (Laurent-Matha et al., 2006) . Therefore, processing of the 39.2 kDa intermediate into the mature enzyme appears to be induced by MDV infection. CathD has been shown to be an important mediator of apoptosis induced through the lysosomal pathway (Guicciardi et al., 2004) . While CathD appears to be involved in the intrinsic pathway of the induction of apoptosis in activated T lymphocytes in human (Bidere et al., 2003) , it may also play a significant role in the resolution of inflammation by inducing apoptosis in neutrophils (Conus et al., 2008) . Apart from its role in the induction of apoptosis, increasing evidence suggests that CathD plays a significant role in cancer progression and metastasis. In the context of MD, several studies have shown the occurrence of cell death in MDVinfected organs such as the bursa of Fabricius (St Hill and Sharma, 1999) , thymus (Morimura et al., 1996) and in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (Morimura et al., 1995) . While it is conceivable that up-regulated CathD may play a role in apoptosis during the early stages of MD, it may also have a role in T cell transformation in the later stages of the disease; however, this needs to be further studied.",

Generally, transglutaminases are involved in post-translational modification of proteins (Beninati and Piacentini, 2004) . TGM4 is highly expressed in the prostate gland of humans but little information is available about the function of this protein in chickens. TGM2, which is a ubiquitously expressed protein in human (also known as tissue TGM, tTGM), has been shown to play a significant role in stress response (Ientile et al., 2007) notably in apoptotic cell death. While TGM2 is up-regulated in apoptotic cells, it acts as a molecular glue and appears to stabilize the dying cells to prevent release of intracellular molecules prior to clearance by phagocytosis (Fesus and Szondy, 2005) thereby preventing adverse effects, such as excessive inflammatory reactions. Assuming chicken TGM4 has a similar role as that of human TGM2, above observations may explain the putative role of the former in the context of host-MDV interactions in the spleen to prevent collateral damage to the neighbouring cells.",

Notably, several metabolic enzymes associated with glycolysis have been found differentially regulated. Among them, a 38.76 kDa spot representing aldolase B fructose-bisphosphate (ALDOB) was constantly up-regulated in infected spleens at all time points. Interestingly, another spot with similar identity and molecular weight but slightly different pI was significantly down-regulated only at 7 dpi. While different pIs for the same protein is possible with structural changes such as phosphorylation, functional relevance in this context needs to be elucidated. Another two newly induced glycolytic enzymes, each at 7 and 21 dpi, were identified as triosephosphate isomerase 1 (TPI1) and phosphoglycerate mutase 1 (PGAM1), respectively. Viruses utilize host cell metabolic process for their replication process. In agreement with the present observations, significantly elevated levels of several serum enzymes, including aldolase B, in response to MDV infection in vivo has been previously described (Ivanov et al., 1974) . Further, MDVencoded protein pp38 has been shown to up-regulate cellular metabolic activities in vitro as determined by the enhanced activity of mitochondrial dehydrogenases (Li et al., 2006) . Similarly, human cytomegalovirus infection in fibroblasts has also shown overall upregulation of a number of glycolytic enzymes (Munger et al., 2006) .",

Although the functions of the proteins, which were identified here, were not studied, it is likely that all or some of them are involved in host-virus interactions. One of the limitations of the tools used in this study is the inefficiency of detecting low abundance proteins or those with low molecular weights, such as cytokines and chemokines. Therefore, a more comprehensive study is needed to elaborate on our present observations and to further explore other proteins that may play a role in pathogenesis of the virus as well as host responses to this virus.",
