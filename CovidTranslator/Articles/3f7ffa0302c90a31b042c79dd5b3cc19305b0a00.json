Faecal samples were collected from 100 dairy calves randomly selected and born during all 4 seasons (March 2015 to May 2016) of the year. In total, 71% of the selected calves were positive for Cryptosporidium spp. oocysts. The statistical analysis revealed influence of colostrum quality on faecal score. Linear regression showed that the colostrum quantity during the first day of life was negatively associated with the number of Cryptosporidium spp. oocysts in faeces. During multivariable analysis, the variables representing the quality of colostrum and the season of the calf's birth were identified as confounders. Cryptosporidium spp. is a common pathogen participating in neonatal calf diarrhoea. Colostrum management and season influence the number of Cryprosporidium spp. oocysts and faecal consistency. The above findings demonstrate novel risk factors that should be included in the strategic approaches to control cryptosporidiosis in newborn calves.",

Among all the above, colostrum management is the most important preventive measure, leading to adequate passive transfer to the newborn calves and thus to the reduction of the neonatal diarrheoa, including Cryptosporidium spp. [12, 13] . However, there are some controversial reports supporting the lack of correlation between colostrum management and the risk of Cryptosporidium spp. diarrhoea [4, 14] .

Therefore, it is confirmed that Cryptosporidium spp. remains a main enteropathogen. The fact that one Cryptosporidium spp. negative calf had soft faeces confirms the presence of other causes, mainly infectious, of NCD that may co-infect or affect young calves leading to similar pathological outcome [2, 3] . Therefore, other viral and bacterial pathogens of the gastrointestinal track such as Escherichia coli, rotavirus, coronavirus should be taken into consideration [9, 10] . Calves born to vaccinated dams against those pathogens also shed less C. parvum oocysts [4] . The lower shedding of this protozoan (C. parvum) oocysts reflects a generally higher standard of management practices in these herds, rather than a direct protective effect. On the other hand, these enteropathogens can be also isolated in faecal samples from healthy calves, thus their presence may not be always the main cause of diarrhoea [3] . Nevertheless, all pregnant cows (one month before parturition) in our study were vaccinated against rotavirus, coronavirus and Escherichia coli K99 (Rotavec Corona \u00ae , MSD) in order to minimize any possible adverse effect of other pathogens than Cryptosporidium spp.",

CQT consists a critical point towards the prevention of NCD provoked by many causes, such as Cryptosporidium spp. This is because, the required amount of IgG level in the calves serum in order to achieve the maximum outcome is 150-200 g [27] , thus, if colostrum contains 50 g IgG/L (good colostrum quality), feeding 4 L of colostrum are capable to provide 200 g IgG to the calf [1] .",

At the same time, the average amount of the consumed colostrum by the neonatal calves was 5.25 liters, at the first day of their life. It is obvious that the higher consumed colostrum, leading to adequate passive transfer, reduced the number of Cryptosporidium spp. oocysts in faecal samples. Unfortunately, only 8.9% of the standard deviation regarding Cryptosporidium spp. number can be interpreted due to the CQT consumed by neonatal calves. Thus, other factors additionally to CQT may influence Cryptosporidium spp. shedding through faeces. In accordance with our results, Trotz-Williams et al. [28] proposed that the early separation of calves from their dams and feeding an increased volume of colostrum within 6 h of birth is significantly associated with a reduced risk of failure of passive transfer [28] and thus, an enhanced immune system.",

[13] calves fed with 1.3 L and 1.7 L of their first colostrum meal, respectively, developed adequate passive transfer, while individual ones with failure passive transfer consumed only 1.0 L of their first colostrum meal [29] . In a different study, Vasseur et al.

This result is in accordance with results conducted by Frank and Kaneene [31] , Maddox-Hyttel et al. [32] , Hamnes et al. [33] , but opposite to the findings of Trotz-Williams et al.

[9] failed to demonstrate any significant association between season of birth and the number of Cryptosporidum spp. found in faecal samples. One possible explanation regarding our findings is that higher animal density, lower temperature and higher humidity during winter months increase the level of infectious agents (e.g. Cryptosporidium spp.) leading to high risk of diarrhoea [14, 34] .",

The importance of adequate consumption of colostrum by calves (at least 4 Liters of colostrum during the first 12 hours of their life) and its effect on the health of the calf is well established. Consequently, intake of colostrum with a lower concentration of IgG (bad quality) could further increase the risk of diarrhoea in calves born during this season. Finally, our study highlights the significance of the CQL, given to neonatal calves in different quantities during the year, on the clinical appearance of cryptosporidiosis. This effect was found to vary greatly during the various seasons depending on the CQL. The results of this study confirm the beneficial value of the colostrum, as for the first time it was attempted to evaluate it applying measurements of its quality and quantity as risk factors for calf cryptosporidiosis.",
