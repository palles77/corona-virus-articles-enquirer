In this study, we investigated the inhibitory effect of NO on the infection by porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) in vitro and the role of NO in the defense against PRRSV. Our results indicated that exogenous NO did not inhibit PRRSV infection. Unexpectedly, N-acetylpenicillamine (NAP), a commonly used compound as negative control for NO-producing reagents, inhibited PRRSV replication. Thus, the inhibition effect of NAP on PRRSV replication was further explored. We found that the maximal inhibition effect of NAP on PRRSV replication was achieved upon treatment 1 h after virus infection and the virus yield was reduced by approximately 50 fold in the presence of 400 \u03bcM NAP. An obvious inhibitory effect on viral RNA and protein synthesis was also observed. However, the inhibitory effect was only achieved at early phase of virus infection. The normal virus yield could be restored upon the removal of NAP treatment. The inhibitory effect might be caused by sulfhydryl-reducing capacity and metal chelating properties of NAP. These studies suggested that (i) NO production or NO synthase (NOS) expression profiling may not be a reliable index for the immune response to PRRSV; (ii) NAP could inhibit the replication of PRRSV.",

In addition, NO could modulate the gene expression of multiple signal transduction pathways (Huang et al. 1998) . Therefore, NO production or NOS expression profiling was often considered as an important index of immune responses against some pathogens (Gamba et al. 2004 ). However, previous experimental evidences indicated that NO activity varied among different cells or tissues and NO formation could not be detected in porcine immune cells. In addition, NO level was not changed in lung macrophages of the PRRSV-infected pigs (Boissel et al. 1998) . Recently, the reports also confirmed that NO was not able to significantly inhibit PRRSV replication in vivo (Jung et al. 2010) . Exogenous or endogenous NO and inducible NOS expression exhibited no apparent antiviral effect on Sendai virus (Z strain) and influenza A virus (H2N2) in MDCK cells (Yoshitake et al. 2004) . Similarly, Our results demonstrated that sufficient NO production could not suppress the propagation of PRRSV in vitro. Based on these results, it is reasonable to propose that NO production or NOS expression profiling may not be a key index for the immune response to PRRSV. Unexpectedly, we found that NAP, a structural analog of cysteine and a metal chelator, could inhibit the replication of PRRSV in Marc-145 cells. Due to NAP treatment, a significant reduction of viral yield and a remarkable inhibition of both viral RNA and protein synthesis were observed. However, the inhibitory activity was not attributed to the involvement of Marc-145 cells. NAP could result in the maximal inhibitory effect on the replication of PRRSV at the 1 h post-infection and total abolishment of PRRSV replication at 12 h post-infection. This observation strongly suggested that NAP only interrupted PRRSV replication during the early phase of virus infection. The inhibitory effect was reversible, and the normal virus yield could be recovered after the removal of the drug. In addition, DPA, an analog of NAP with the free amino group, could not inhibit PRRSV replication (Fig. 1c) . The results indicated that acetylation may play an important role on PRRSV replication.",
