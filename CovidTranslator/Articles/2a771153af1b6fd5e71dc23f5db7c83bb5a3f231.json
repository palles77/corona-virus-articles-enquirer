            "text": "protein in the ER, which is essential for the formation of transport vesicles. From biochemical and morphological lines of evidence, we have proposed that Secl2p is localized to the ER by two mechanisms: static retention in the ER and dynamic retrieval from the early Golgi compartment. We have also shown that Rerlp, a membrane protein in the Golgi, is required for correct localization of Secl2p. In the present study, we have performed a systematic analysis to determine the ER localization signals in Sec12p corresponding to these two mechanisms. Both the transmembrane domain (TMD) and the NH2-terminal cytoplasmic domain of Sec12p show the ability to localize the protein to the ER. The effect of the TMD is potent and sufficient by itself for the ER localization and is strongly dependent on Rerlp. On the other hand, the cytoplasmic domain shows a moderate ER-localization capability which is independent of Rerlp. The rate of mannosyl modification has been measured to distinguish between retention and retrieval. The cytoplasmic domain significantly delays the transport from the ER to the cis-Golgi. In contrast, the TMD shows only a subtle retardation in the transport from the ER to the cis-Golgi but strictly prevents the transport beyond there. From these observations, we conclude that the TMD mainly acts as the retrieval signal and the cytoplasmic domain contains the retention signal. This study not only supports the two-mechanisms hypothesis but also provides powerful tools to dissect the two.",

The correct sorting of proteins is essential to maintain complex structure and function of these organelles and requires a specific localization signal in each protein. To date, a few examples of such signals have been identified for ER proteins. One is the COOH-terminal Lys-Asp-Glu-Leu (KDEL, mammals) or His-Asp-Glu-Leu (HDEL, yeast) sequence (Munro and Pelham, 1987; Pelham et al., 1988) . The cis-Golgi receptor for this K(H)DEL sequence, Erd2p, has also been identified (Semenza et al., 1990; Lewis and Pelham, 1990) . Other signals are the COOH-terminal dilysine motif of type I transmembrane proteins (Jackson et al., 1990 ) and the NH:-terminal diarginine motif of type II transmembrane proteins (Schutze et al., 1994) . It is believed that the ER proteins harboring the K(H)DEL or dilysine motifs are retrieved from the early Golgi to the ER (Pelham, 1988; Dean and Pelham, 1990; Hsu et al., 1991; Lewis and Pelham, 1992; Jackson et al., 1993) .",

Most of Secl2p is localized to the ER in the steady state (Nakano et al., 1988; Nishikawa and Nakano, 1993) and not detected on the purified transport vesicles (T. Oka and A. Nakano, unpublished; Barlowe et al., 1994) . However, a significant portion of Sec12p receives ed--+6 mannose modification on its N-linked oligosaccharide, which takes place in the early Golgi (Nakano et al., 1988; d'Enfert et al., 1991; Nishikawa and Nakano, 1993) . Based on these observations, we have proposed that the ER localization of Secl2p involves two different mechanisms: static retention in the ER and dynamic retrieval from the early Golgi. Secl2p molecules are largely excluded from the transport vesicles during budding from the ER, and those escaping from this retention are sent back from the Golgi to the ER by the retrograde pathway (Nishikawa and Nakano, 1993; Sato et al., 1995) .",

A fusion protein of Secl2p and the precursor of a-mating factor (Secl2-Mfctlp) was used as a marker protein. If this fusion protein is mislocalized to the late Golgi, the Mfetl moiety is processed to mature a-factor, which is then secreted to the medium. Using this trick, we have isolated two rer mutants (Nishikawa and Nakano, 1993) . The RER1 gene encodes a protein of 188 amino acid residues (Rerlp) containing four putative transmembrane domains. The null mutant of RER1 is viable, and even in this mutant, a significant portion of Secl2p is still located in the ER. Immunofluorescence microscopy and subcellular fractionation experiments demonstrated that Rerlp is mainly localized to the Golgi complex. This suggests that Rerlp functions at the retrieval step (Sato et al., 1995) .",

A BspHI site was created at the start codon of SEC12 (Nishikawa et al., 1994) . SEC12-MFal bearing these three restriction sites was subcloned into pBluescript II SK+ whose BspHI site was destroyed by blunting and religation. The resulting plasmid was named pMS2-3 (also called pSSS-1). The start to the 29th codon fragment of DAP2 was made by PCR using primers D-1 and 5'-CCTCTAGACCITATGAGCITATCTAACAAATG-3' (D-5), digested by NcoI and XbaI and used to replace the BspHl to XbaI region of pSSS-1, and thus produced pDSS-1. For pDDS-1, PCR was performed using primers D-1 and 5'-GCCTTAAGTATACTTITFAGCAACAAAAC-3' (D-3). The resulting fragment (start to the 48th codon of DAP2) was digested by NcoI and AfllI and inserted into the BspHI and AfllI sites of pSSS-I. For pSDS-1, a fragment encoding the transmembrane domain (TMD) 1 of Dap2p was synthesized by PCR using primers D-3 and 5'-GCT-CTAGAGTCGGAATAATCCTTGTAC-3' (D-4). This fragment was digested by XbaI and AfllI and introduced into the XbaI and Aflll sites of pSSS-1. An AfllI site was created just before the 48th codon of DAP2-MFcU by PCR-mediated mutagenesis and subcloned into pBluescript II SK+ (named pMD3-3). The AfllI to SacI (in vector) fragment of pMD3-3 was used to replace the corresponding fragments of pSSS-1, pDSS-1, and pSDS-1 to produce pSSD-1, pDSD-1, and pSDD-1, respectively. These chimeric genes were also subcloned into pSQ326 to yield pXXX-2, where XXX stands for SSS, DDD, SDS, DDS, DSS, DSD, SDD, or SSD. The plasmids for the mutational analysis of the Secl2p TMD were constructed by PCR-mediated mutagenesis using oligonucleotides containing mutations corresponding to each mutant.

As such a passenger protein, we chose Dap2p (dipeptidyl aminopeptidase B), a vacuolar membrane protein. Dap2p is a transmembrane protein with the same topology as Sec12p (type II) but is transported to the vacuole quickly after biosynthesis (Roberts et al., 1989) . It has been shown that Dap2p has no particular localization signal in itself and thus is transported to the vacuole by default (Roberts et al., 1992) . This gives us a nice opportunity to identify the ER localization signal(s) of Sec12p by examining which chimeric constructs are localized to the ER. We dissected Sec12p and Dap2p into three parts: the NH2-terminal cytoplasmic domain, the TMD, and the COOH-terminal lumenal domain by introducing appropriate restriction sites in their corresponding genes. For convenience, we refer to the constructs with three letters composed of S and D. S stands for Sec12p and D is for Dap2p. The first letter indicates the NH2-terminal domain, the second is for the TMD, and the third is for the COOH-terminal domain. For example, SDD refers to the N (Sec12p)-TMD (Dap2p)-C (Dap2p) chimera. All the combinations of the three parts of the two proteins were made and named by this nomenclature (Fig. 1) . They were all placed under the SEC12 promoter.",

First, we un-dertook the halo assay method that was used to isolate rer mutants (Nishikawa and Nakano, 1993) . As illustrated in Fig. 2 , this method utilizes fusions containing Mfalp in the lumenal domain. If a particular fusion protein is transported to the late Golgi, Mfalp moiety would be processed by the Kex2 protease leading to the secretion of mature a-factor. Cells secreting a-factor form a halo when placed on an agar plate with a lawn of tester a strain as a result of the growth arrest of the a cells (Halo+). Accordingly, the Halo-phenotype should indicate that the fusion is retained in the ER or the early Golgi. Sec12-Mfalp (SSSm) behaves very much like the authentic Sec12p. It is mostly localized in the ER and does not yield a halo in the wild-type cells (Nishikawa and Nakano, 1993 We constructed a Dap2-Mfal fusion protein (DDDm) and tested whether the wild-type cells expressing this fusion (WT/DDDm) secrete a-factor by the halo assay. As shown in Fig. 4 , upper spot 2, WT/DDDm produced a large halo, indicating that this fusion protein was transported to the late Golgi quite efficiently. Furthermore, DDDm was found to be subject to degradation in the vacuole. Immunoblotting using the anti-Dap2p antibody showed that the amount of DDDm was higher than in the wild-type PEP4 cells when the major vacuolar proteolytic activities were disrupted (Apep4) (data not shown). Finally, the immunofluorescence observation of DDDm showed clear vacuolar staining in the Apep4 cells (Fig. 3 , C-E). These all indicate that DDDm is processed in the late Golgi, transported to the vacuole, and eventually degraded there (Fig. 2, gray arrows) . The presence or absence of the vacuolar proteolytic activities (PEP4 or Apep4) did not affect the size of halo produced from DDDm (data not shown). The radius of the halo is proportional to the logarithm of the amount of secreted a-factor and thus is a good measure of the passage of the fusion protein through the late Golgi compartment.",

This indicates that these proteins were retained in the cells before they reach the Kex2 compartment of the late Golgi. All these constructs contain the TMD of Secl2p (SRFFTNFILVLLSYILQFSL). It is striking that the DSDm chimera, whose only part from Secl2p is the TMD, is completely retained before the late Golgi. Complementary to this result, SDSm secreted c~-factor in the wild-type cells (see Fig. 4 , spot 3), again indicating that the TMD region of Secl2p is very important for its localization. The same interpretation can be made for SDDm (compare with SSDm). By replacing the Secl2p TMD by the Dap2p TMD, the retention of the molecule was seriously impaired. It should be noted, however, that the amount of the a-factor secreted by SDSm or SDDm is only 27-38 % (12-13 % if corrected by normalization of expression levels) as compared to DDDm, suggesting that another mechanism of retention operates for these proteins (see below). It seems that the lumenal domain of Secl2p has no effect on the localization as long as we could test by this halo assay. DDSm and SSDm were almost indistinguishable from DDDm and SSSm, respectively, in a-factor secretion.",

As shown in Fig. 5 C, the anti-Dap2p antibody again stained the ER in the Adap2 cells expressing SDDm. This led us to conclude that the cytoplasmic domain of Secl2p also has an ability to localize the protein to the ER. The efficiency of the ER localization attained by the cytoplasmic domain appears to be lower than that of the TMD because the secretion of a-factor from the Mfalp fusion is not completely prevented by this domain alone. The effect of the cytoplasmic domain does not require the presence of Rerlp. This raises an intriguing possibility that the retention by the cytoplasmic domain may be due to the static mechanism at the exit from the ER. It should also be noted that, in the absence of Rerlp, the cytoplasmic domain is not the only region that causes the retention. As seen in Table II , the Secl2p TMD also has an effect in the Arerl cells (see DSSm and DSDm). This Rerlp-independent mechanism may involve both the cytoplasmic and TMD regions.",

The Dap2-Mfalp (DDDm) construct showed no enzymatic activity of dipeptidyl aminopeptidase. The Mfalp moeity might hinder correct folding of the lumenal domain of Dap2p and thus activate the potent quality control system in the ER for some of the chimeric proteins. Although the fact that DSDm forms a large halo in the Arerl ceils strongly argues against this possibility, we decided to test the ER localization effects of the TMD and the cytoplasmic domain in more native forms. We constructed DSD and SDD, which contain the complete COOH-terminal lumenal domain of Dap2p devoid of the Mfalp moiety. This version of the chimeric proteins expressed in the Adap2 cells showed full dipeptidyl aminopeptidase activities as the authentic Dap2p (data not shown). SDD is also completely functional as Secl2p since it could complement the Asec12 mutant on a single-copy plasmid. Immunofluorescence microscopy (Fig. 6, A and B) showed that, like DSDm, DSD was strictly localized to the ER. SDD was mainly localized to the ER, but weak vacuolar staining was also observed (Fig. 6, C-E) . This is consistent with the fact that SDDm had less ability of retention than DSDm as measured by the halo assay. Because DSD and SDD retain the full activity as Dap2p and SDD fucntions like the authentic Sec12p, it is unlikely that these proteins invoke the quality control of the ER as unfolded proteins.",

Only 19% was modified with the cd---~6 linkage after 60 min, which is very similar to the case of Secl2p (see Table III ). It appears that the acquisition of the ctl-->3 modification of SDD (8% at 60 min) is significantly faster than either Secl2p or DSD. Since the ER localization of SDD does not require Rerlp, which is involved in the retrieval, it may be reasonable that the SDD molecules are not sent back to the ER efficienctly once they have left. In fact, the immunofluorescence of SDD (see Fig. 6 D) indicates that some population of SDD is transported to the vacuole. The results of the halo assay on SDDm also supports this. All these observations are consistent with the idea that SDD is localized to the ER by moderate static retention. A small portion escapes from this mechanism, and the molecules that depart from the ER do not return but reach the vacuole.",

F-A (F355A, F356A, and F359A) and SY-A ($366A, Y367A, and $372A) mutants did not produce any halo in the wild-type cells, indicating that they were completely retained in the ER/c/s-Golgi. FSY-A (F-A plus SY-A), N-A (N358A), and Q-A (Q370A) formed very small halos. The halo of NQ-A (N-A plus Q-A) was slightly larger than that of either N-A or Q-A. These mutants appear to be leaking out of the ER, but the majority is still localized to the ER. Even the A10 mutant, in which all of the polar and aromatic residues were replaced by alanine, is mostly located in the ER in the wild-type cells.

Interestingly, all these alanine mutants kept the Rerlp dependency. In the Arerl cells, the mutants produced halos as large as DSDm did. Upon this surprising result, we decided to construct another series of replacement using leucine instead of alanine. The result is also shown in Fig. 10 . N-L (N358L), Q-L (Q370L), and NQ-L (N-L plus Q-L) mutations formed larger halos than the corresponding alanine mutants, indicating that hydrophobicity of these residues is an important parameter. The Rerlp dependency was still seen with these mutants but became less apparent, especially with NQ-L. With the L7 mutant, in which serine, threonine, asparagine, and glutamine residues were all replaced by leucine, the Rerlp dependency finally disappeared. The difference between the alanine and leucine mutants suggests that the distribution of hydrophobicity in the TMD somehow affects its ability to localize the protein to the ER in the Rerlp-dependent manner. On the other hand, even with this L7 mutant, the secretion of s-factor was not as efficient as DDDm. We further proceeded to construct the LeuX19 mutant, which contains only 19 leucine residues in the TMD. This artificial TMD showed Rerlp-independent halo formation, but again the efficiency was not as good as DDDm. Since the expression levels of these mutant proteins were almost the same as DSDm and D D D m as determined by immunoblotting (data not shown), the decrease of the size of halos was not due to their reduced synthesis. In fact, immunofluorescence observation of the cells expressing L7 or LeuX19 showed staining of both the ER and the vacuoles (data not shown). The ER localization was not as strict as with the Secl2p TMD, but it was still obvious. The length of the stretch of leucine (LeuX13, LeuX15, LeuX17, LeuX21, LeuX23, and LeuX26) did not affect its localization property as long as we could test by the halo assay (M.

Sed4p shows a striking structural similarity to Secl2p in the NH2terminal cytoplasmic domain and the TMD (45% identical) but not in the COOH-terminal lumenal domain. Sec20p has no homology to Secl2p. It has been shown that the H D E L sequence of Sec20p is important for its ER localization (Sweet and Pelham, 1992) . We constructed D4Dm and D20Dm (Fig. 11 A) by replacing the TMD of Dap2p by that of Sed4p or Sec20p. The behavior of these chimeras in wild-type and Arerl cells was tested by the halo assay (Fig. 11 B) . D4Dm did not produce any halo in the wild-type cells, indicating that the TMD of Sed4p is sufficient for the ER localization. Subcellular localization of D4Dm was also examined by immunofluorescence, which showed strict ER staining similar to that of DSDm (Fig. 12 B) . This effect was dependent on Rerlp because D4Dm produced a halo in drerl (Fig. 11 B) . Thus, the Rerlp-dependent mechanism of ER localization commonly operates on the TMD of Secl2p and Sed4p. In contrast, D20Dm formed a large halo in either wild-type or Arerl cells (Fig. 11 B) . This clearly indicates that the Rerlp-dependent system is not effective to all transmembrane ER proteins. It apparently discriminates Sec20p from Secl2p and Sed4p. In the case of Sec20p, other motifs including the H D E L sequence might decide the localization.",

Rerlp could serve for ER localization of Secl2p either by directly sending back the molecule to the ER or by preventing its progression to the later compartments of the Golgi. The role of Rerlp in such retrieval processes is in good agreement with the biochemical observations in this study. On DSD, a chimeric construct whose ER localization is achieved by the Rerlp-dependent effect of the TMD, the rate of al---~6 mannosyl modification is quite fast, unlike Secl2p, whereas that of ctl---~3 mannosyl modification is strictly inhibited.

It does not require the presence of Rerlp and appears to be less efficient than the TMD for ER localization. The analysis on mannosyl modification on SDD, a construct localized to the ER by the cytoplasmic domain, indicates that this molecule is largely detained in the ER. The rate of al--->6 modification is as slow as that of the authentic Sec12p. This strongly suggests that the ability of the cytoplasmic domain to localize the protein in the ER is due to the static retention mechanism. Interestingly, the SDD molecules that have escaped the retention and acquired the etl--->6 linkage appear to be further modified by the etl---~3 mannose in time. This may be because the retrieval system does not work effectively on SDD. This is also consistent with the fact that the ER localization of SDD is not affected by the deletion of RERI.",

They showed that secretion of the invertase activity was suppressed by introduction of the Secp TMD and that this the ER, whereas the TMD of Sec12p is required for the efficient Rerlp-dependent retrieval from the Golgi to the ER.

In normal cells, the retention mechanism would mask the retrieval effect and vice versa. Successful dissection of two such signals has become possible by the systematic analysis of chimeric proteins and the use of the Arerl mutant in the present study. Further determination of the signals of Secl2p has been attempted at the level of amino acid residues. We have performed an extensive mutational analysis on the residues in the TMD and obtained a surprising result: Even the mutant TMD that has had all the polar and aromatic residues replaced by alanine (AIO of Fig. 12) can still localize the DSD molecule to the ER in an Rerlp-dependent manner. Since this TMD contains only alanine, valine, leucine, and isoleucine residues, one might argue that the recognition of the TMD signal by the retrieval system is not quite strict in terms of structure. However, we have also realized that the dependency on Rerlp is completely lost when most of these polar residues are replaced by leucine (L7 of Fig. 12) . Apparently, there is a difference between leucine and alanine residues in the Rerlp-dependent localization effect of the mutant TMD. One obvious difference between these two amino acids is the bulkiness of the side chain. In other words, they differ in the degree of hydrophobicity. By scrutinizing the Secl2p TMD and its mutant versions that retain the Rerlp dependency, we find that there is a gradient of hydrophobicity which peaks in the middle of the TMD. The hydrophobic core in the center that is flanked by less hydrophobic residues appears to be a feature of the Rerlp-dependent signals. From such a point of view, the Rerlp-dependent TMD of Sed4p has a similar profile, whereas the Rerlp-independent TMDs of Dap2p and Sec20p do not. In support of this idea, the artificial TMD consisting of 19 leucine residues does not show the Rerlp-dependent localization effect. Further experimental tests are possible and will be necessary to prove or disprove this:hypothesis.",

            "text": "Apart from the =Rertp dependency, it is also puzzling that even the LeuX19 TMD can localize the protein to the ER to some extent. Although weak, this artificial TMD has an ability to retain the chimeric protein in the ER, which is not present in the Dap2p TMD. How could this observation be explained? Let us presume here that this is due to the retention in the ER because it is Rerlp-independent. Possibly, the introduction of this artificial stretch of leucines interferes with the assembly of the DSDm protein into the transport vesicles and thus retards the ER-to-Golgi traffic. The quality control system of the ER might be somehow involved in this process. Alternatively, the partial ER retention may take place without any particular signal, and the fast exit of Dap2p from the ER may depend on a selective mechanism that positively transports the protein to the Golgi apparatus. This is a revival of the selectivity model of Lodish (1988) and may be consistent with the arguments that cargo molecules are selectively concentrated in transport vesicles (Mizuno and Singer, 1993; Balch et al., 1994) . Of course, we cannot exclude the possibility that the effect of the LeuX19 TMD in ER localization is due to another retrieval mechanism that does not require Rerlp. It is known that many Golgi membrane proteins are localized by virtue of the TMD signals. However, the structural requirements of such signals are still unclear (Swift and Machamer, 1991; Bretscher and Munro, 1993; Nilsson et al., 1993; Weisz et al., 1993) . If the TMD alone can distinguish ER and Golgi proteins, what is the difference between them? Munro (1995) has recently demonstrated that the length of the TMD is critical for the Golgi retention in the case of sialyltransferase and suggested the importance of the lipid-based sorting. In his experiment, the LeuX17 TMD functions as a Golgi localization signal. We have performed a similar experiment to test whether such a length effect of the TMD could be involved in the case of Sec12p as well. The result indicates that all of the leucineonly TMDs we have examined show a partial retention ability that is independent of Rerlp. There was no special preference to the length of leucine stretch (M. Sato, unpublished data). The different requirement of similar hydrophobic TMD between the ER and the Golgi localization remains to be clarified experimentally.",

The cytoplasmic domain of Secl2p contains the catalytic site of the protein that functions as the guanine-nucleotide exchange factor toward the Sarl GTPase (Barlowe and Schekman, 1993) . Mutations in this region may hamper the interaction with Sarlp and other molecules that are essential for vesicle budding and thus accelerate the degradation of the mutant protein. It is also conceivable that the interaction of the cytoplasmic domain of Secl2p with other component(s) of the budding machinery may be the mechanism of the static retention.

In fact, both of these domains are capable of localizing the Dap2p chimeras in the ER as those of Secl2p do. If the ER retention by the cytoplasmic domain of Secl2p is fulfilled by interaction with other molecules, is it also the case with the cytoplasmic domain of Sed4p? If so, are there common partners with which Secl2p and Sed4p can interact? Sed4p has been shown not to possess the guaninenucleotide exchanger activity toward Sarlp despite the high similarity to Secl2p (Barlowe and Schekman, 1993) . However, Gimeno et al. (1995) reported that synthetic lethal interaction exists between one mutant allele of SAR1 and the disruptant of SED4 and suggested the possibility that their products may function in a multisubunit complex in the wild-type cells. Sed4p has also been shown to interact with Secl6p (Gimeno et al., 1995) . Since SAR1 has a strong suppressor activity on sec12 and sec16 ts mutants (Nakano and Muramatsu, 1989) , there may be a link between Secl2p and Secl6p. Sarlp and Secl6p could be somehow involved in the ER retention of Secl2p and Sed4p. How Sarlp and Sec16p are associated with the ER membrane is totally unknown. To solve this kind of chicken-and-egg problem, further efforts to dissect the structural requirements of the cytoplasmic domains of Secl2p (and Sed4p) will be necessary.",

In the case of the KDEL/HDEL signal, Erd2p has been identified as its receptor (Semenza et al., 1990) . In the retrieval of membrane proteins with the dilysine motifs, the coatomer (COP I) binds to this signal and executes the Golgi-to-ER retrograde transport (Cosson and Letourneur et al., 1994) . What about the Sec12p signals? If the recognition of these signals is a receptor-mediated process, massive overproduction of the signals would give rise to saturation and overflow of the sorting mechanism. In the case of the authentic Sec12p, enormous overproduction does not lead to its missorting but rather complex phenomena including proliferation of the ER membrane, inhibition of ER-to-Golgi anterograde transport, and formation of the BiP bodies in the lumen of the ER (Nishikawa et al., 1994) . Such consequences are probably due to the imbalance of the Sarlp GTPase cycle caused by the increase of the catalytic sites of Sec12p as the guanine nucleotide exchange factor. Since the TMD of Sec12p does not have such an effect on Sarlp, we could test the effect of its overproduction. In fact, when the DSDm construct was expressed by the strong promoter of the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene on a multicopy plasmid, secretion of t~-factor was clearly observed, indicating that this chimeric protein was mislocalized to the late Golgi (M. Sato, unpublished data) . This suggests that the retrieval of Sec12p by the TMD signal is a saturable process, again implying the existence of a receptor.",

Since Rerlp is an integral membrane protein with four membrane spans, there is a chance that such transmembrane regions physically interact with the Secl2p TMD.

On the other hand, missorting of the dilysine signal was not observed in the same ceils . Apparently, understanding of the structure and function of such general machinery requires further identification of components by genetic and biochemical studies. The RER2 gene we identified previously (Nishikawa and Nakano, 1993) appears to encode a hydrophilic protein which is peripherally associated with the ER membrane (M. Sato, S. Nishikawa, K. Sato, and A. Nakano, unpublished) . Its role could be implicated in the retention rather than in retrieval.",

            "text": "It should also be mentioned here that the effect of the Secl2p TMD is not completely Rerlp-dependent. Even in the absence of Rerlp, a significant amount of DSD is localized to the ER. This might indicate that multiple pathways exist in the retrieval system. The fact that the disruption of the RER1 gene is not lethal could also suggest the redundancy of the retrieval mechanism. Perhaps the deletion of Rerlp only partially impairs the function of the retrieval machinery. Alternatively, the TMD of Sec12p may also harbor a weak signal for static retention. The observation that the rate of {xl---~6 mannosyl modification on DSD is not as fast as Dap2p supports this possibility. More extensive analysis on the amino acid residues in the TMD might separate such different effects in terms of Rerlp dependency.",
