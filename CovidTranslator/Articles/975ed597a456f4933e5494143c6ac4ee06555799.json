In 1961 there were reports from the UK of S aureus isolates that had acquired resistance to meticillin (meticillin-resistant S aureus, MRSA). Similar MRSA isolates were soon found in other European countries, and later from Japan, Australia, and the USA. Today MRSA is a major cause of hospital-acquired infections, and a serious public-health concern. In this forum, we present different perspectives from across the globe to better understand the complexity of the problem, and examine the challenges that individual countries face in trying to control the spread of MRSA.",

The prevalence of MRSA has increased progressively since the early 1980s, and by 2002 MRSA accounted for nearly 60% of nosocomial S aureus infections acquired in intensive-care units. 1 MRSA strains have been reported to account for 30-62% of nosocomial S aureus bloodstream infections and 42-60% of S aureus surgical-site infections. [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] In some facilities, the proportion of health-care-associated S aureus infections caused by MRSA is even higher. Vancomycin-intermediate S aureus (VISA) strains, which have vancomycin minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 8-16 mg/mL, have continued to cause occasional health-care-associated infections, although transmission within health-care facilities of such strains has seldom been documented. 8 At least three well-documented isolates of vancomycin-resistant S aureus (VRSA) that have vancomycin MICs of 32 mg/mL or greater have been recovered from patients in the USA. 9 Although it is possible that the relatively high frequency of co-colonisation by vancomycinresistant enterococci (VRE) and MRSA among patients in the USA may create more opportunities for in-vivo transfer of the vanA gene complex from VRE into MRSA strains, it is not known if this has affected the frequency of VRSA in the USA.",

            "text": "By contrast with the uncommon occurrence of VISA and VRSA, MRSA strains that are still classified as susceptible to vancomycin (ie, MICs of 1-4 mg/mL) have caused an increasing number of health-careassociated infections that respond poorly to vancomycin therapy. 8, 10, 11 The poor response to vancomycin therapy in such cases appears to be associated with several strain characteristics. Patients infected with MRSA strains with vancomycin MICs of 1-4 mg/mL have responded to vancomycin therapy less frequently than patients with infections caused by strains with MICs of less than 0\u00b75 mg/mL. 10 In some cases, poor clinical responses may have been due to strains with hetergenous resistance to vancomycin-so-called hetero-VISA. 6 Fowler and colleagues 14 found that MRSA bloodstream infections that persisted for more than 7 days despite appropriate vancomycin therapy were significantly more likely than short-duration MRSA infections to have been caused by strains that exhibited (1) higher rates of survival in vitro after exposure to thrombin-induced platelet microbicidal protein (p=0\u00b7005), (2) defective delta-lysin production (suggestive of loss of accessory gene regulator [agr] function; p=0\u00b7057) and (3) agr type II (p=0\u00b7037). In two prospective randomised trials of treatment of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), vancomycin therapy was significantly less effective than treatment with linezolid (p=0\u00b7001) among a subset of patients with VAP caused by MRSA. 12 Unfortunately, the microbiological characteristics of MRSA from these pneumonia studies were not described in detail. The above trends suggest that although vancomycin remains the drug of choice for most serious health-careassociated MRSA infections, clinicians in the USA may need to consider the use of other agents-eg, linezolid, daptomycin, or tigecycline-in some clinical situations based on the characteristics of the infecting strain and the body site affected.",

MRSA has waxed, waned, and waxed again over the following decades. The International Union of Microbiology and WHO's staphylococcal centre is based in the Laboratory of Healthcare Associated Infection of the Health Protection Agency (HPA), and was the first to identify and number epidemic MRSA strains (EMRSA 1-17), plot their spread, and identify the existence of other epidemic MRSA strains in Europe as part of the HARMONY network project. 25 Community MRSA are evident in England but have not yet emerged to be the problem encountered in some other countries.",

Current English data show that the occurrence of meticillinsensitive strains has also increased, so merely focusing on the percentage of total S aureus bacteraemias can be misleading. Ever since the organism was first described, hospitals have continued to vary in MRSA occurrence within and between different cities and in different wards within the same hospital. The reasons are complex and may include aspects of the reporting system; a comparison of reporting methods is underway. We know that the current prevalent UK epidemic MRSA (EMRSA strains 15 and 16) differ genetically from their predecessors and also contain more or different toxins. However, we still do not understand why certain MRSA strains have this epidemic potential. When such strains spread to other countries they seem to exploit the more stressed or less \"infection control compliant\" hospitals or wards.",

MRSA has always preferably colonised and infected elderly people. Improved nutrition and medical advances has meant that elderly patients are now admitted to \"high-risk\" units-eg, cardiovascular and orthopaedic wards with periods of care on intensive care units. Such units can then \"carousel\" Forum strains appear to be responsible for many of the community-acquired MRSA infections occurring in the USA. 17 Most of such strains contain the mobile genetic element staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) type IV, which is relatively uncommon among health-care-associated MRSA strains in the USA. 18 Emergence of community-acquired MRSA has also required that clinicians alter their approach to empiric treatment of community-acquired skin and soft tissue infections. Physicians have been encouraged to routinely culture skin lesions to determine if community-acquired MRSA is the cause, and in geographic areas where community-acquired MRSA are relatively common, empirical therapy of such infections with clindamycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (co-trimoxazole), doxycycline or minocycline, or linezolid is becoming common. If empiric clindamycin is administered, testing community-acquired MRSA isolates for inducible clindamycin resistance by using the \"D-test\" is recommended. 19 By contrast with the Netherlands and some other parts of northern Europe, no standard set of measures has been adopted in all health-care facilities in the USA for controlling transmission of MRSA. Measures recommended by the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America for controlling health-care-associated MRSA include the use of screening cultures to detect colonised patients, placing patients in private rooms or cohorting patients, wearing gloves for room entry, gowns for substantial contact with patients or their environment, and hand hygiene before and after patient contact. 20 However, there is considerable debate among experts in the USA about whether or not the use of screening cultures to detect patients at high risk of MRSA is necessary or practical in all health-care settings. Given the considerable body of evidence that screening cultures, when combined with contact precautions, are beneficial and cost-effective, [20] [21] [22] it is disconcerting that a recent survey of infectious disease consultants found that only 50% of 463 respondents favoured the use of screening cultures to detect multidrug-resistant pathogens, and only 30% worked in facilities where screening cultures were routinely done. 23 The costs of surveillance cultures, potential logistic problems that may result from an increased number of patients requiring isolation, and lack of controlled trials demonstrating the efficacy of screening cultures are often cited as concerns by those who do not use screening cultures. Further studies are necessary to establish the relative efficacy of control measures such as screening cultures, cohort nursing, increased staffing levels, and improved hand hygiene adherence rates in controlling transmission of MRSA in health-care facilities. 24 At present, there is no consensus regarding which measures are most appropriate for reducing transmission of community-acquired MRSA in community settings and for preventing the spread of these strains in health-care facilities.",

Reduced hospital bed numbers have resulted in increased interward transfers of patients, which have been shown to increase the risk of MRSA acquisition. Decreased lengths of stay have resulted in patients being discharged before they present with MRSA infections. We have thus reduced the effectiveness of our alert organism laboratory surveillance systems. Our data also show that inter-city transfers of patients has encouraged national MRSA spread. Bed occupancy in many hospitals is over 90% and in some parts over 100%. Some UK infectioncontrol teams have problems closing MRSA-affected wards because of the pressures on waiting lists. However, the relation between bed occupancy and MRSA rates is not clear-cut. 26 Insufficient numbers of skilled staff further compounds the problem. Studies have shown that compliance with infection-control practices decreases as workloads increase, resulting in more MRSA crossinfection. These practices include MRSA screening, effective hand hygiene, wound and intravascular/urinary device care, and appropriate isolation measures. When we did an intra-UK comparison of hospitals in 1995, those that were better able to control MRSA outbreaks had fewer delays in identifying MRSA patients (28\u00b76% vs 50%), fewer inter-hospital transferred patients (9\u00b74% vs 29\u00b74%), and no problems with mupirocin resistance (0% vs 14\u00b77%) compared with those less able to control the problem. A recent English MRSA systematic review 27 concluded that there were many problems with the quality of the reviewed papers. Absence of evidence should not be taken to mean that there is an absence of effect. The authors emphasised that the current guidelines for MRSA control should be followed until evidence emerges that other approaches are effective. Prescribing of certain antibiotics probably contributes to the acquisition of MRSA, although the evidence for this is not clear-cut. The authors indicated the ways in which better studies could be designed to inform the most cost-effective means to produce sustained improvements in compliance.",

A good example of this is the Cleanyourhands campaign, which uses a multifaceted approach including the use of alcohol handrubs and patient empowerment. Rapid MRSA detection systems are being examined for costeffectiveness. Many systems have been used to isolate patients-eg, an open ward, side rooms, four-bedded cohorting, or an isolation ward.

Modelling studies have further informed isolation strategies. 27 The HPA and others have done much to ensure that the news media are well informed about MRSA and have provided leaflets to educate the public.

Annual surveillance studies by the Australian Group on Antimicrobial Resistance have allowed us to track the evolution of both epidemic and community MRSA for the past 18 years. The current prevalence (2003) for multidrug-resistant epidemic MRSA varies for the state capital cities, and is approximately 35% in Sydney, 22% in Melbourne, 16% in Brisbane, 14% in Adelaide, and 3% in Perth.

Since 1997, increasing numbers of ST22-MRSA-IV (UK EMRSA 15) have been detected clinically, on screening, and in the annual surveillance studies. This non-multidrug-resistant clone is the major epidemic strain in Western Australia, where it comprises 21% of all MRSA isolates and 80% of all epidemic strains. A similar trend is occurring on the eastern side of Australia, with Sydney having the highest prevalence of this strain (15% of all MRSA). Nurses coming from the UK are an important source of these isolates, which are often detected on pre-employment screening. This clone has also become established in many long-term care facilities. In addition to nosocomial epidemic MRSA we have been documenting the evolution of true community-acquired MRSA strains in Australia over the past 20 years, such that now we have at least 23 clones that have evolved independently around the country. It is somewhat ironic that Western Australia, the state with the lowest rate of noscomial epidemic MRSA, should now have the highest rate of communityacquired MRSA (75% of all MRSA isolates). These strains, although frequent in admitted patients, rarely seem to be transmitted to others in the hospital. When identified, patients colonised or infected with community-acquired MRSA are managed with enhanced precautions (single room if possible, attention to hand hygiene, contact precautions, and extra cleaning during admission and on discharge). To date, we have not had any major hospital outbreak with community-acquired MRSA, despite an increasing prevalence in the community.",

In addition, staff who have worked clinically outside Western Australia are also screened pre-employment. This screening has led to my colleagues in Sydney, Melbourne, and Brisbane calling us \"fortress WA\". We have had a number of outbreaks over the years, particularly in my own hospital, which has a lack of single rooms, but swift screening of contact patients and staff, isolation of colonised patients, attention to hand hygiene, and enhanced ward cleaning has terminated the outbreaks rapidly. We also routinely screen all patients in high-risk areas (intensive care, burns, vascular, and spinal units) on admission, discharge, and after prolonged stay. Decolonisation is initiated for persistently colonised staff and patients likely to have frequent readmissions. In general, topical hexachlorophene or triclosan together with mupirocin nasal ointment is used. However, if oral carriage is detected or the topical regimen fails, systemic therapy with two agents is given. I cannot speak for my colleagues on the other side of Australia who have lived with endemic nosocomial MRSA for many years, but I believe that there are a variety of practices mostly aimed at containment rather than eradication.

Although there is some interest in the subject, the risks and safety issues surrounding MRSA are generally not that well known. MRSA carriage is seen as a \"stigma\" for patients and because colonisation with MRSA is not usually differentiated from an infection, the media are quick to generate a scandal and attach blame to hospitals and doctors when MRSA is reported. Hence, most hospitals tend to refuse MRSA-positive patients to avoid potentially damaging repurcussions for the hospital. Moreover, this situation can lead to clinicians hesitating to identify MRSA carriage of patients who are being transferred to another hospital. In many countries it is strongly recommended that clinicians at the transferring hospital should notify MRSA carriage status of the patient to the infection control team at the receiving hospital before transfer. However, this procedure has not been followed stringently in Japan. An MRSA flagging system to highlight previously identified patients within the same hospital or upon readmission is expected to become available soon to most clinicians. 29 This flagging system needs to be computerised and added on to the individual database in each hospital. However, it is still difficult to share microbiological results through a single medical computer network system. Each hospital needs to develop MRSA flagging software for this purpose. Although Japanese hospitals are extensively computerised, the main purpose of the hospital computer system is for ordering and accounting for medical procedures. The data sorting function from previous laboratory results is usually optional. We have recently developed a small computer programme on our hospital network to indicate an \"alert spot\" on the individual patient record window. If a patient has a previous history of being MRSA positive, a redcoloured alert spot automatically appears on the computer display. This alert system helps us to recognise whether the patient is a potential or current MRSA carrier without checking any previous microbiological results, which is usually a tedious and time-consuming procedure for busy clinicians and hospital officers. This function will be introduced to a new hospital computer system in the future. Ideally, these data will become indispensable information for inter-hospital transfers via a shared database that should be set up in the future.",

Emphasis is placed on trying to target preventive measures at the very first steps of possible MRSA transmission. According to the guidelines, every patient who has been treated in a hospital outside of Finland during the previous year and is transferred to a Finnish hospital is screened for MRSA colonisation at the time of hospital admission. Patient records of each MRSA case are labelled accordingly, and an \"MRSA alert\" is also added to electronic patient records in many institutions.

The extent of resistance varies nationally, regionally, and even institutionally. In addition to meticillin, these strains are also resistant to routinely used antimicrobials, and thus infections caused by such isolates cause serious treatment difficulties. 37 Unfortunately for Turkey, accurate and recent population-based national surveillance for communityacquired and hospital-acquired drug-resistant microorganisms does not exist. However, data from sporadic reports of the number of cases suggest an urgent need for surveillance. Available reports provide a fragmented and incomplete picture to guide our understanding of the problem. The most recent and only national resistance screening programme data supported by the Turkish Scientific and Technological Research Council is from 1993. In this study, 1826 clinical isolates both from outpatient and inpatient clinics (including surveillance isolates) from 29 different hospitals were collected and screened. Overall, MRSA resistance varied from 7% to 55% at different centres. 38 This range of resistance may have been due to variations in patient population, hospital care practices, and infection control activities. Other factors-eg, size, locality, and type of hospital-were also contributing factors to the wide disparity in resistance. Among the identified isolates, 178 nosocomial strains were randomly selected for evaluation of the mechanisms of meticillin resistance, and the presence of mecA was found to be the most frequent type (94%). 38 When various other studies from different centres were evaluated up to 1995, it was noted that up to 40% of strains in some places were MRSA. In a further evaluation extending to 1999, this figure rose to 70%. 39 More recently, data from the past 5 years from individual centres across Turkey state the percentage of MRSA strains is 65\u00b75%. [40] [41] [42] [43] When tested, all strains were reported to be vancomycin and teicoplanin susceptible but potential emergence of resistance to these drugs should be kept in mind, since this has prompted the overuse of glycopeptides in empirical and even prophylactic therapy. 44, 45 Evaluation of reports showed no correlation between MRSA rates and sex, profession, hospital department, or carriage. It was difficult to evaluate the age distribution and age group at risk. Ideally at each hospital multidrugresistant strains should be regularly identified. Clonal typing methods should be used to identify the relations between these strains, and to see which strains predominate in the country. We evaluated our hospital's main nosocomial MRSA clone and tried to track the sources of the clonal types in different clinics by pulsed field gel electrophoresis. One major type was identified among their strains. This single clone was compared with another Turkish university hospital's clone and several main international clones including the Iberian and Brazilian clone, and it was found to be different from them. 46 Predominance of this clone or any other clone is not known. This type of evaluation needs to be done by most hospitals. With enough funding a national Netherlands Yes, they do not like to see us coming: physicians, nurses, and hospital administrators may shrink away when the banner of MRSA is raised by the hospital infection-control practitioner-it always means expensive and timeconsuming isolation, may mean temporary removal of staff, or the partial or complete locking of wards that have to stop admissions.",

First, patients with MRSA are always isolated in single rooms, whether they have an active MRSA infection or not-carriers are also considered potential sources of transmission. Isolation for being a carrier raises anxiety in the patient and their relatives. However, 30% of adults are staphylococcal carriers, and they develop an infection only occasionally, so, in itself, carriage of a staphylococcus that has additional resistance is not a source of worry for the individual patient. Second, patients suspected of potential carriage are always placed in isolation; potential carriage is considered in all patients transferred from hospitals abroad to Dutch hospitals, in patients from Dutch hospitals, or from nursing homes with an actual problem of MRSA, and in patients who have been nursed in the same room as a patient in whom MRSA is detected unexpectedly. This isolation may come Forum epidemiological surveillance group should be established. 47 Data emerging from various centres indicate that in Turkey-like many other countries-both infections and the rate of MRSA is gradually increasing. The main factors that contribute to this organism's resistance are misuse and overuse of antimicrobials, which include constant pressure on the physician to prescribe antimicrobials when they are not indicated, the patient's failure to finish a prescribed antibiotic regimen, and also the availability of antimicrobials without a prescription. We believe that control of such factors, alongside implementing good infection-control procedures in Turkey, will result in decreasing rates of MRSA. Studies from other countries have shown that surveillance activities-eg, setting up a national/regional system to collect and evaluate data from all centres and updating data on antibiotic resistance patterns that will form the basis for prevention guidelines of nosocomial infections-decrease infection rates by as much as 20%.",

The project's aim is to develop a regular, standardised surveillance system, allowing electronic data transfer and online announcement of the results to the member centres. To achieve its goals, the problems of gaining financial support and recruiting qualified personnel for data evaluation and processing need to be solved, and additionally all major hospitals will need access to the system. 49 Despite the absence of extensive data, reports of recent percentages of up to 70% of nosocomial MRSA infections confirm the urgent need for an effective antimicrobial usage policy for our country. To prevent resistant isolates spreading within and between hospitals, proper infection control procedures should be enforced, which currently most hospitals lack. In time we hope to prevent the uncontrolled availability of antimicrobials, increase awareness of such problems to physicians and the community, and have more available funds to support programmes in hospitals.",

Differences are caused largely by uneven control and isolation measures, hand hygiene practices, antibiotic prescribing behaviours, and allocation of resources. 51 Cultural and economic factors pervade all aspects of MRSA control, which can only be fully successful if strict measures and policies are installed at an early stage of MRSA dissemination, sufficiently supported by financial and staff resources. Especially at the early phase of a nationwide MRSA epidemic, the full clinical impact of MRSA may not be visible, leading to misconceptions among clinicians and policy makers that MRSA may not be a threat to patient safety.",

As MRSA surveillance systems and control strategies improve in quality and become more coherent among different countries, international pressure may start to be applied to induce change in countries where infection-control policies are lax or non-existent. The situation with MRSA might become comparable to that observed for other infectious problems such as severe acute respiratory syndrome and mad cow disease-economic and political pressure may contribute to compliance and uniformity in control measures and to allocation of resources to improve patient safety. 52 Yet stringent MRSA control worldwide will remain difficult to implement and will require intensive surveillance efforts and substantial resources. To achieve this goal may be possible, as shown by several examples where successful action against MRSA has been endorsed by strong policy support.",
