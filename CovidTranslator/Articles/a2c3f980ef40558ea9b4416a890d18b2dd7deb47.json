Calanolide A is in clinical testing phase II as anti-HIV drug; (Buckheit et al., 2000; Cragg and Newman, 2003) interest therefore arose particularly in developing its analogues. So far, most of the analogues were either less potent or devoid of any anti-HIV activity (Galinis et al., 1996; Zhou et al., 1999; Zembower et al., 1997; Xu et al., 1998; Newman et al., 1998) ; however, aza-calanolide A [(\u00b1)-2] (Sharma et al., 2003) exhibited enhanced in vitro anti-HIV reverse transcriptase activity. These findings prompted us to undertake the total synthesis of thia-calanolide A 3 by replacing oxygen in ring B with a sulphur atom, which might exhibit better activity. Herein, we describe the first synthesis, optical resolution and in vitro biological evaluation of (\u00b1)thia-calanolide A 3 (Fig. 1 ).",
