            "text": "The 72 nt 3 0 non-translated region (NTR) of potato virus X (PVX) RNA is identical in all sequenced PVX strains and contains sequences that are conserved among all potexviruses. Computer folding of the 3 0 NTR sequence predicted three stem-loop structures (SL1, SL2, and SL3 in the 3 0 to 5 0 direction), which generally were supported by solution structure analyses. The importance of these sequence and/or structural elements to PVX RNA accumulation was further analyzed by inoculation of Nicotiana tabacum (NT-1) protoplasts with PVX transcripts containing mutations in the 3 0 NTR. Analyses of RNA accumulation by S 1 nuclease protection indicated that multiple sequence elements throughout the 3 0 NTR were important for minus-strand RNA accumulation. Formation of SL3 was required for accumulation of minus-strand RNA, whereas SL1 and SL2 formation were less important. However, sequences within all of these predicted structures were required for minus-strand RNA accumulation, including a conserved hexanucleotide sequence element in the loop of SL3, and the CU nucleotide in a U-rich sequence within SL2. In contrast, 13 nucleotides that were predicted to reside in SL1 could be deleted without any significant reduction in minus or plus-strand RNA levels. Potential polyadenylation signals (near upstream elements; NUEs) in the 3 0 NTR of PVX RNA were more important for plus-strand RNA accumulation than for minus-strand RNA accumulation. In addition, one of these NUEs overlapped with other sequence required for optimal minus-strand RNA levels. These data indicate that the PVX 3 0 NTR contains multiple, overlapping elements that influence accumulation of both minus and plus-strand RNA.",

This process involves recognition of cis-acting elements within the viral genome by the replication machinery. Although many of these elements include sequences and/or structures that reside in the 3 0 non-translated regions (NTR) of viral RNAs, 1 -3 some cis-acting elements have been found to reside upstream and in the 5 0 NTR. 4 In addition, a longdistance interaction between elements near the 3 0 terminus and 1200 nt upstream has been shown to be important for bacteriophage Qb replication minus-strand RNA synthesis in vitro. 5 Analyses of the roles of cis-acting elements in the synthesis of minus-strand RNA are complicated because 3 0 -terminal sequences may be required for other aspects of virus replication such as assembly, translation and/or RNA stabilization. 6 -13 Cis-acting elements required for minus-strand RNA accumulation in vivo or RNA synthesis in vitro have been well studied for the plant plus-strand RNA viruses that contain tRNA-like structures in the 3 0 NTR 2 such as brome mosaic virus (BMV), 14 -16 cucumber mosaic virus (CMV), 17 tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) 18 and turnip yellow mosaic virus (TYMV), 19, 20 and for several other viruses such as alfalfa mosaic virus (AlMV), 21, 22 barley stripe mosaic virus (BSMV), 23 cymbidium ringspot virus (CymRSV), 24 red clover necrotic mosaic virus (RCNMV) 25 and turnip crinkle virus (TCV). 26, 27 Much less is known about the roles of 3 0 NTR cis-acting elements during minus-strand RNA synthesis of polyadenylated viruses.

The overlapping ORFs 2 -4, collectively called the triple gene block, encode for proteins required for viral cell-to-cell and long-distance movement. 43 -45 ORF 5 encodes the coat protein, which is also required for viral movement. 45 -47 Our previous studies have shown that there are sequence and structural elements present in the 5 0 NTR of PVX RNA that affect genomic and subgenomic (sgRNA) plus-strand RNA accumulation. 48 -50 These analyses revealed that although the plus-strand RNA accumulation was affected by mutations in the 5 0 NTR, there was no significant effect on minusstrand RNA accumulation. Both local elements upstream of the sgRNAs, as well as long-distance interactions with complementary sequence at the terminus, are important for PVX plus-strand RNA accumulation. None of these elements in the 5 0 NTR or upstream of the sgRNAs affected PVX minus-strand RNA accumulation. In contrast, Sriskanda et al. 37 showed that deletion of 38 nt in the 3 0 NTR of PVX RNA affected minus-strand RNA accumulation.

In contrast, only one stem-loop structure was critical for RNA accumulation. We have localized elements important for optimal plus-strand RNA accumulation, indicating that the 3 0 NTR is required for multiple aspects of virus replication.",

The thermodynamic energy dot plot shown in Figure  2 (A) represents all secondary structures for the 250 nt sequence within 10% of the minimal energy. The triangle below the diagonal represents the most optimal folding of the minimum energy structure, with the rows of dots corresponding to nucleotide positions involved in pairing and the gaps within the rows indicating internal loops or bulges. The triangle above the diagonal represents sub-optimal foldings within 4 kcal (1 cal \u00bc 4.184 J) of minimum free energy of the optimal folding. The dark dots represent optimal pairings and alternative folding patterns are represented by progressively lighter dots, with the lightest dots representing the least-favored pairing. Regions that are scattered with differently shaded dots exhibit multiple folding possibilities. The 3 0 NTR (nucleotides 6364-6435 plus 17 A residues) of PVX RNA was predicted to contain three stemloop structures, denoted SL1, SL2 and SL3 in the 3 0 to 5 0 direction (Figure 2 (A) and (B)). As seen in Figure 2 (A), SL3 was strongly predicted, but SL1 had some scatter near the base of the stem. The region containing SL2 and the region between SL2 and SL3 contained considerable scatter, suggesting multiple pairing possibilities. Similar structures were obtained when foldings were done with additional residues from the Spe I site. The secondary structure predicted by STAR program strongly supported the existence of SL3. There was no stable pseudoknot predicted in the 3 0 region of PVX RNA.",

RNase V 1 cleaved many of the nucleotides in the stem of SL1 and none was reactive to DMS, indicating base-pairing or stacking in this region. Lack of modification in the 3 0 end of the lower region of SL1 was due to protection by primers used in the reverse transcription reactions. Exceptions to the predicted pairing were indicated by susceptibility of G6415 to Rnase T 1 (Figures 2(B) and 4(A)) and U6412 to CMCT (Figure 3(B) ). Although the nucleotides in the predicted mismatch were not modified by DMS, it was not susceptible to RNase V 1 . The terminal loop residue G6423 was cleaved by RNase T 1 , suggesting that it was not paired, but none of the other terminal loop residues was accessible to DMS or CMCT. In contrast, all of the loop residues were accessible to RNase V 1 . Thus, it appears that the upper stem region of SL1 may be base-paired as predicted, and that the terminal loop residues of SL1 may be stacked or be involved in pairing with nucleotides located elsewhere. The lower region of the predicted stem region appears to be more flexible and may form alternative structures, which is consistent with the thermodynamic energy dot plot ( Figure 2 (A)).",

The signals for minus-strand RNA frequently appeared as doublets. These are likely due to breathing in the AUAUC sequence immediately adjacent to the non-specific portion of the probe, which resulted in two S 1 protection patterns. The intensity of each band in the doublet varies from experiment to experiment, and shows no correlation to a particular transcript used as inoculum. Coat protein accumulation (data not shown) mirrored the plus-RNA accumulation, suggesting that sub-genomic RNA accumulation was affected similarly by the deletions. These data indicate that deletion of 10 nt, including the hexanucleotide element near the 5 0 region of the 3 0 NTR, resulted in inhibition of minus-strand RNA accumulation. As expected, the longer deletion of most of the 3 0 NTR in p71D60 also was unable to initiate minus-strand RNA synthesis. Although the Dint mutant contains the hexanucleotide element, the U-rich element and other sequences downstream, deletion of the sequence between these elements was detrimental to minus-strand RNA accumulation. Either the sequence in this region, the importance of this sequence to structure, and/or the spacing between the hexanucleotide and U-rich elements are necessary for RNA synthesis.

These data suggest that the sequence in the lower part of the stem in SL2 was not necessary for minus-strand RNA synthesis, but was necessary for optimal accumulation of plus-strand RNA. In contrast, mutant SL2-C was created to retain the U-rich element within an altered structure by changing only the 5 0 side of the stem (C6390CAG to GGUC). This resulted in disruption of both SL3 and SL2, and predicted formation of a single, large stem-loop structure (Figure 7(B) ). Inoculation of protoplasts with mutant SL2-C resulted in reduced levels of both minus and plus-strand RNA (Figure 7 (C)). These data are similar to those observed for mutant SL3-C ( Figure 6 (C)), which also was predicted to have a combined SL3/SL2 structure. Thus, disruption of SL3 structure in theSL2-C mutant caused a reduction in minus-strand RNA synthesis and consequently lowers levels of plus-strand RNA.

Similar data were seen with protoplasts inoculated with mutant p72D23 (Figure 8(C) ), which lacks G6410 -A6432, confirming that elements downstream of the U-rich region are important for minus-strand RNA synthesis. These elements probably overlap with the potential NUEs, and may be why all the mutants disrupting either of the potential NUEs (p73, DAAU, DUAAUAUA and DUAUA) have reduced minus-strand RNA levels (around 60-70% of wild-type). On the other hand, mutant p74, which has both the NUEs intact has nearwild-type levels of minus-strand RNA accumulation, but reduced plus-strand RNA accumulation. Thus, the distance of the potential NUEs from the poly(A) tail and/or the requirement of the second potential NUE to be continuous with the poly(A) tail may be important for optimal plus-strand RNA accumulation.",

Alternatively, the presentation of the hexanucleotide sequence in a loop in the 3 0 NTR may allow for interaction with complementary sequences upstream of the sg RNAs. A sequence complementary to the hexanucleotide element, located near the 5 0 terminus of PVX plus-strand RNA (or 3 0 terminus of minusstrand RNA), was important for a long-distance interaction required for plus-strand RNA accumulation in protoplasts. 50 Such a long-distance interaction may be required for PVX minus-strand RNA synthesis in vivo, similar to that required for PVX plus-strand RNA synthesis. 50 Our data also showed that deletion of sequence between the PVX hexanucleotide and U-rich elements (mutant Dint) abolished minus and plusstrand RNA accumulation in protoplasts. This may be because this deletion is predicted to disrupt SL3 and SL2, resulting in a combined SL structure with the two elements adjacent to each other in a large loop (data not shown).

            "text": "The CU nucleotides at the 3 0 end of the U-rich element contribute to minus-strand RNA accumulation Sriskanda et al. 37 showed that a 38 nucleotide region in the PVX 3 0 NTR containing the U-rich sequence (UAUUUUCU) was important for host protein binding, and deletion of this region reduced minus-strand RNA accumulation in protoplasts. Substitutions for the four consecutive U residues affected both host protein binding in vitro and replication in protoplasts. Our data indicate Cis-acting Elements for PVX Replication that deletions of the U-rich sequence (D60 and D21) from the PVX 3 0 NTR specifically affected minusstrand RNA accumulation. Moreover, in this study we have further defined this region by showing that mutation of the CU residues at the 3 0 end of the U-rich sequence (mutants SL2-B and SL2-D) is sufficient to abolish minus-strand RNA accumulation. Similar U-rich elements can be found in the 3 0 NTR of other potexviruses. As shown in the alignment in Figure 10 , UC-rich regions (blue text) are found downstream of the hexanucleotide motif in nine out of 11 potexviruses and all of these have 3 0 CU residues. Additional experiments will be required to determine if the UC-rich regions in other potexviruses are important for minus-strand RNA accumulation and/or host protein binding. Furthermore, it will be important to determine if the CU residues of the U-rich element in the PVX 3 0 NTR are important for host protein binding. Sriskanda et al. 37 postulated that host protein binding to the PVX U-rich element may be important for viral RNA synthesis, RNA stability, and/or translation. Similar results have been shown for the coronavirus, MHV, which has an 11 nucleotide sequence (UGAAUGAAGUU) at the 3 0 end of the genome that is conserved among coronaviruses. This sequence was required for host protein binding and MHV viral RNA synthesis, with both minus and plus-strand replication being affected by mutations in this region. 54 Sequence between the U-rich element and potential NUEs is dispensable for minusstrand RNA accumulation Surprisingly, the sequence immediately downstream of the U-rich sequence in the PVX 3 0 NTR (nucleotides 6412 -6424) could be deleted (p72D13) without affecting minus-strand RNA accumulation. Because the p72D13 mutant is predicted to have wild-type SL3 and SL2, but no structure downstream of SL2, these data confirm that the SL1 structure is not required for minus-strand RNA accumulation. However, further deletion of three nucleotides downstream in mutant p72D16 was partially detrimental to minus-strand RNA levels. Although p72D13 and p72D16 have identical structures, they differ in only three nucleotides and this sequence difference reduces the minusstrand RNA accumulation from wild-type levels in p72D13 to 70% of wild-type in p72D16. When the deletion was extended two nucleotides in the upstream direction and five nucleotides in the downstream direction (mutant p72D23), minusstrand RNA accumulation in protoplasts dropped to 5% of wild-type. Thus, it was not surprising that deletion of the 3 0 -terminal 15 nt plus the poly(A) tail in the mutant D15 resulted in no minus-strand RNA accumulation. It is unlikely that the deletion of GG at the upstream end of the deletion in p72D23 was solely responsible for the reduction in minus-strand RNA accumulation because these two nucleotides were mutated in SL2-2A, which exhibited minus-strand RNA accumulation similar to wild-type levels. Thus, nucleotides from A6425 -A6432 are required for minus-strand RNA accumulation, whereas at least U6412 -A6424 and potentially G6410 -A6424 are not necessary. Similarly, other groups have identified dispensable sequences in the 3 0 NTRs of several plant 33,55 -57 and animal 58,59 viral RNAs.",

            "text": "Although changes in the potential NUEs in the PVX 3 0 NTR (mutants p73, DAAU, DUAUA, and D UAAUAUA), were more detrimental to plusstrand RNA accumulation, minus-strand RNA accumulation was also somewhat reduced. Thus, this region of the PVX 3 0 NTR appears to have a dual role in minus-strand RNA synthesis and plus-strand RNA stability and/or polyadenylation. It is possible that correctly polyadenylated templates are important for PVX minus-strand RNA synthesis. When WClMV transcripts containing no poly(A) tail were inoculated into pea protoplasts, replication proceeded very slowly. 36 The importance of poly(A) length was observed also for BaMV, where no or short poly(A) tails did not support genomic and subgenomic plus-strand RNA accumulation. 34 In addition, it appears that BaMV minus-strand RNA initiates at multiple sites within the 5 0 most 15 A residues of the poly(A) tail. 66 The importance of a poly(A) tail in virus RNA accumulation was observed for coronaviruses. The 3 0 NTR and the poly(A) tail of MHV RNA are required for minus-strand synthesis, 59 and a poly(A) tail of at least five A residues was required for efficient replication of bovine coronavirus (BCV) RNA. 67 Our data show that deletions in the regions of the PVX NUEs (mutants p72D23 and D15) resulted in negligible levels of minus-strand RNA, suggesting that elements necessary for minus-strand RNA accumulation and those needed for efficient polyadenylation and/or stability overlap near the 3 0 end of the PVX 3 0 NTR.",

Alternatively, some of these elements may affect minus or plus-strand RNA stability, leading to reductions in minusstrand RNA levels. However, modeling of the minus-strand RNA 5 0 terminus of these mutants using Mfold did not indicate any significant disruptions to predicted structures and/or stabilities (data not shown). In addition, we previously found that mutations to a stem-loop element in the 5 0 NTR disrupted accumulation of plus-strand RNA, but did not affect minus-strand RNA levels. 48, 49 It is possible that the reduced minusstrand RNA levels reflect decreased replicase translation, given that 3 0 -terminal elements have been found to be important for translation in several other systems. 11,12,68 -76 The role(s) of the elements in the third and fourth categories, which are near the 3 0 end of PVX RNA, may involve stabilization of the plusstrand RNA, either directly or as a result of disruption of efficient polyadenylation. Because some of the sequences in the third category significantly affect minus-strand RNA levels, they may function during minus-strand RNA synthesis or be important for optimal translation of the PVX replicase. Studies are underway to distinguish among these possibilities.",

(A) An energy dot plot was derived for secondary structures in the 250 nt 3 0 region of PVX RNA predicted by the Zuker program (http://www.bioinfo.rpi.edu/ applications/mfold/). The axes are labeled to denote the position of each nucleotide in the 3 0 region of PVX RNA. The three stem-loop structures predicted to form in the 3 0 NTR are boxed and denoted as SL1, SL2 and SL3. (B) A summary of the solution structure probing experiments is superimposed on the optimal predicted secondary structures within the 3 0 NTR. The positions of RNase T 1 cleavage are indicated by check marks, with larger check marks indicating more reactivity. RNase V 1 cleavage positions are marked by curved arrows. The DMS modification positions are identified by asterisks with intensities of low ( ), moderate ( ), or strong ( ). The intensities of uridine modification by CMCT are denoted as low ( ), moderate ( ), or strong ( ). Filled circles represent ambiguous CMCT reactivity.",
