Thus, even though the vaccines have been extensively used [7] , outbreaks of the disease continue. In present study, we are the first to investigate the amino acid substitutions features in the AIBV antigenic domain of a vaccine serotype (DE072) and a virulent viral strain (GA98) to better understand adaptive evolution of AIBV.

First, the likelihood ratio test (LRT) was employed to test if positive selection exists by comparing a null model with a more general one. The null model does not allow for sites with \u03c9 (d N /d S ) > 1, while the more general one does. Here the LRT compares M7 (null model) with M8 (general model) for the presence of sites under positive selection. M7 assumes that \u03c9 ratios were distributed among sites by a beta distribution and M8 adds a discrete \u03c9 class to M7. In general, positive selection can be inferred if \u03c9 value estimated under M8 is greater than 1. Second, the Bayesian theorem, which calculates ",

            "text": "In this study, we analyzed the spike protein (S) of DE072 vaccine and GA98 strain to identify putative amino acids that are subjected to positive selection and contribute to the evasion from the host immunity. The results revealed that inferred amino acid substitutions predominantly occurred within the regions of conformational virus-neutralizing epitopes previously recognized by monocolonal antibodies analyses [15] , indicating that these substitutions may be responsible for the emergence of antigenic variations and that they may be crucial for the evasion of GA98 serotype from DE072 immunity. Specifically, we found that 6 of 9 amino acid changes that were under positive selection in GA98 strain tended to switch from polar to non-polar or from neutral to charged residues (Table 1) . For example, positions 60, 67 and 121 exhibit the amino acid transformation from neutral (A, G, Q) in DE072 to charged (E, R, K) in GA98 population, and positions 23, 123 and 278 change from polar (E, T, E) in DE072 to non-polar (V, L, A) in GA98 population. Therefore, it appears that the shift of residue charges in S protein was especially important in determining the potential epitopes for antibody, as also has been demonstrated in other viruses [16] . Finally, the phylogenetic analysis showed that GA98 strain sequences can be divided into two clusters, and at some inferred sites, different amino acids substitutions were observed between the two clusters of GA98 strain (Table 1 ). It is possible that It is interesting to see whether the substitution features identified to be important for the survival of GA98 AIBV are also characteristic of SARS-CoV. Human SARS epidemics are generally believed to originate from the animals with the palm civet as the primary suspect [8, 9, 17] . The comparison between the CoV sequences of the palm civets and SARS-CoV sequences allows inference of the importance of amino acid changes since the divergence of the virus [9] . After the first epidemic of SARS occurring during 2002-2003, scattered new cases were reported in Guangzhou during [2003] [2004] . Phylogenetic analysis has suggested that the new epidemics may be caused by independent viral invasion from animal to human [17] . Thus, we analyzed the sequences of animal and human viruses from two epidemics separately. In the first epidemic, we found 8 of the amino acids changes under positive selection distinguishing animal and human viruses ( Table 1 ). The first three occur in the S1 subunit and all exhibit an interesting amino acid transformation from negative charge (K) to neutral residues (N or T). Four of the remaining five revealed the alterations of amino acid polarity from nonpolar to polar residues, more specifically, from P, L, A and A in CoV of the palm civets to S, S, R/T and T in SARS-CoV, respectively. These changes may influence the conformation of S protein and consequently the power of antibody binding. Similarly, among the 4 amino acid changes under positive selection in the second epidemic we identified two charged residue shifts (Table 1) . Importantly, one of these two positively selected sites (479) was observed not only in this epidemic but also in the first epidemic, with the same trends of alterations of amino acid charge from negative charge (K, R) to neutral residues (N or T). Interestingly, this amino acid has also been suggested to be under positive selection in Song et al. (2005) by analyzing SNV (singlenucleotide variation) in different populations. Moreover, this amino acid is located in the region (residues 318-510), where it can efficiently bind angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, a functional receptor for SARS-Cov [18] . Since the CoV of palm civets and SARS-CoV are analogous to the DE072 vaccine and GA98 strain AIBV, our analysis suggests that significant changes of residue charge and polarity in critical proteins have enabled these viruses to establish themselves, although the direction of changes are different in the two situations.",

For instance, two substitutions (75 T\u2192R and 311 G\u2192R) were only found in the early phase of Guangzhou and Zhongshan lineages [8] , but not in the subsequent phases. Similarly, unique substitutions to the middle and late phases, respectively, were also present. The evidence suggests that these particular amino acid substitutions may affect strain virulence and infectivity. Hence, it can be followed that different genotypes of viruses must be taken into account when we adopt attenuated virus as SARS vaccine, similar to the common practice of administering influenza vaccine [19] .",
