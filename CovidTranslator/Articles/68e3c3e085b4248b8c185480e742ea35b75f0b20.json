            "text": "Solvent cleaning is a well-established process for removal of surface contaminants in a wide variety of commercial cleaning applications [1] . Many of the conventional solvents used for cleaning, such as hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), are considered detrimental to the environment and are increasingly subject to regulations for reduction in their use, and eventual phasing out of these solvents [2, 3] . As a result, there is a continuing effort to find alternate cleaning methods to replace these solvents. One such alternative is microbial cleaning that takes advantage of naturally-occurring microbes to remove a wide variety of contaminants from various surfaces. Microbial cleaning is part of the broader concept of bioremediation. As the name implies, bioremediation is a natural solution to contamination mitigation. It is technically defined as the accelerated breakdown of organic compounds through the use of natural biological agents such as bacteria, enzymes, or fungi. For carbon-based contaminants (grease and oil), the endproducts are carbon dioxide and water. Bioremediation is a safe, environmentally-friendly way to process many kinds of hazardous waste and is supported by the U.S. EPA (United States Environmental Protection Agency) as a viable solution for cleanup of oil spills and other contaminants, as well as an alternative to solvent cleaning.",

The surface cleanliness levels are based on contamination levels established in industry standard IEST-STD-CC1246E for particles from Level 5 to Level 1000 and for NVR from Level R1E-5 (10 ng/0.1 m 2 ) to Level R25 (25 mg/ 0.1 m 2 ) [7] . In many commercial applications, the precision cleanliness level is defined as an organic contaminant level of less than 10 \u03bcg of contaminant per cm 2 , although for many applications the requirement is set at 1 \u03bcg/cm 2 [7] . These cleanliness levels are either very desirable or are required by the function of parts such as metal devices, electronic assemblies, optical and laser components, precision mechanical parts, and computer parts. A new standard ISO 14644-13 has been published that gives guidelines for cleaning of surfaces in cleanrooms to achieve defined levels of cleanliness in terms of particles and chemical classifications [8] .",

            "text": "The basic principle of microbial cleaning for removal of hydrocarbon contaminants involves the reduction of the contaminants into harmless CO 2 and water by the action of microbes [4, 11, 26] . Fig. 15 .1 shows a lifecycle diagram of the cleaning process. In a typical surface cleaning application, a cleaning solution containing a strong surfactant/degreaser contacts the contaminated surface. The surfactant reduces the interfacial tension between the contaminant and the part surface, and separates the contaminants from the surface. A combination of microbes and nutrients is released into (and now living in) the solution. Nutrients are generally added as part of the cleaning mix to provide emerging . This action releases carbon as a source nutrient for the microbes. The microbes are activated and begin to digest the oil and grease that are subsequently absorbed through the cell wall and digested further. The contaminants are then carried by the cleaning solution through a filtering device, where particulate matter, such as dirt, paint chips, and other items larger than 50 \u03bcm, are retained. In parts cleaners, the cleaning action is due to the surfactant, not the microbes. However, while the microbes do not participate in surface contaminant removal, over time they will remove any hydrocarbons in the cleaning system. In a conducive, nutrient-rich environment, the bioremediation materials continue to manufacture themselves throughout the contaminated solution, increasing the overall biomass of microbes in an exponential manner until all of the available hydrocarbons are consumed, thus leaving a clean system with a hydrocarbon-free cleaning solution. Bacteria multiply very rapidly. A single cell can grow to 10 21 within 24 hours [26] . The clean solution can be recirculated through the system, the cleaning cycle is repeated, and there is no interruption in the cleaning process.",

Typically, a biocatalyst contains a combination of nonionic surfactants and emulsifiers and water, as well as nutrients that are essential to microbial life. The combination of surfactants and emulsifiers acts to break up the hydrocarbon into very small globules to bring it into intimate contact with the microbes. The globules are surrounded by the enzymes, thereby increasing the rate at which they are dissociated and subsequently digested. The biocatalyst significantly increases bioavailable oxygen. This provides a catalyst for the microbes to multiply faster, resulting in more rapid, more complete bioremediation. The by-products of this process (with pure hydrocarbons) are carbon dioxide, water and soluble fatty acids.",

Typically, these heated cleaning systems consist of an upper sink and a lower tank, filter assemblies to trap visible particulate matter (for example, sand, grit, dirt and paint chips), power module, onboard diagnostics, recirculating pumps, cleaning nozzles, and a tank aeration system that increases the effectiveness of the microbes. Higher pump pressure also improves the cleaning action. The load capacity of these systems ranges from 20 to 200 kg of parts. These units are best for light-duty manual cleaning of parts similar to conventional solvent sink-top units, although recently a larger capacity system has been introduced for cleaning entire bicycles [34] .

An innovative method of removing oil and grease on slick surfaces is to replace the microbe-enhanced surfactants with protein-enhanced surfactants [14] . This has the benefit that no bacteria are added to the local environment, thus avoiding cohabitation with resident bacteria. The proteins increase the metabolism of the resident bacteria in the wastewater during cleaning or mopping.",

Deterioration is a complex process involving chemical, physical, and biological mechanisms. For example, black salt crusts form on stone surfaces as a result of the chemical and microbial interactions between the atmospheric contaminants (sulfur dioxide forming sulfuric acid), the stone (calcium carbonate reacting with sulfuric acid to form calcium sulfate), and microbes that can form calcium oxalate in the crusts. Dust and dirt combine with the calcium sulfate and oxalate, resulting in the black crust. Several microbial techniques have been proposed and successfully demonstrated for cleaning and restoration of stone buildings, frescoes, marble surfaces, and other objects .

One reason for the spread of infection is incomplete or ineffective disinfection of surfaces. Many viruses, bacteria, and other pathogens such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), are resistant to existing conventional surface cleaning agents/disinfectants. A new antibacterial cleaning composition has been developed that contains different enzymes (proteolytic, amylolytic, lipolytic, or cellulolytic, or their mixtures) and microbes (Bacillus or Pseudomonas) together with a surfactant and an aqueous carrier to maintain a minimum 95% catalytic activity at pH range of 5.5 to 13.5 [24] . This solution is effective against several resistant bacterial strains, such as MRSA, VRE (vancomycin-resistant Enterococci), and GISA (glycopeptide intermediate Staphylococcus aureus), and can be used as a cleaning and disinfecting agent in affected areas. It can also be used for killing or inactivating bacteria, viruses, or fungi to prevent spreading of the contaminants. Variations of this composition can be used for cleaning metal, ceramic, glass and plastic parts, concrete and tile floors, cleaning grease traps, and other household applications. The contaminants that can be removed include carbon deposits, oil, grease, carbohydrates, starch, and meat and dairy products. Beyond cleaning and disinfection of surfaces, it is also critical to prevent the growth of microorganisms using a solution such as a quaternary ammonium and benzothiazole composition [113] .",

Similarly, removal of body fluids, tissue, residual organic matter, and biofilm is critical to ensure proper cleaning and subsequent high-level disinfection. In general, these detergent formulations offer faster cleaning cycles at lower temperatures, cost savings by extending the lifetime of the instruments, and reduced risk of infections through indepth cleaning prior to high-level disinfection and/or sterilization [68] .",

Operating costs are generally low. Consumption of cleaning chemicals is minimal, as the microbes tend to clean the solution and free up the surfactants to clean and emulsify more contaminants. The premixed or in situ activated microbial cleaning solution never needs to be replaced, rather, it is topped off in the tank on average every 8 to 10 weeks to cover losses due to evaporation and fluid left on parts after they are cleaned. The costs of the cleaning solution itself are around US$400 for 5 gallons, but it is diluted on average in 20:1 ratio. Power costs are minimal because there is minimal heat input into the process to maintain an operating temperature in the range 323-360 K (50-77\u00b0C). Some system providers offer maintenance contracts at around US$600 per year for bimonthly service calls [33] . Waste disposal costs for microbial cleaning are low since the primary waste stream is the filters that are replaced every 3 to 8 weeks. Overall, the costs of microbial cleaning are lower than solvent cleaning, as illustrated by some examples below.",

Comparing the costs with the use of enzymes (which is a comparable technique in terms of cleaning efficiency and lack of damage to artworks), biocleaning is clearly far less costly because the cost of protease is about 150 Euro/l and the cost of collagenase is about 500 Euro/l [96, 104] . The costs of the microbial cleaning process are also generally comparable with the usual chemical-physical techniques, but the microbial bacterial approach is more convenient in terms of both the short time needed for the biocleaning and the number of treatments (a single treatment of 2 h), as well as the environmental safety of the process (no hazardous chemical waste disposal).

Microorganisms are nonpathogenic, completely safe to use and have no recognized hazard potential under ordinary conditions of handling. 7. The rate at which microbes can digest hydrocarbons can approach 80% every seven days. 8. Most bioremediating parts cleaners can handle large, tough, dirty jobs. 9. Parts are usually cleaned in the first pass. Even the tiniest crevices and tight spaces in contaminated parts are cleaned because the microbes have close and unhindered contact with the parts. 10. Parts are always exposed to clean solution because the microbes constantly clean the solution and keep the bath clean. 11. Microbes improve the cleaning ability of the cleaning solution. The bioremediation process that takes place in the solution frees the surfactants allowing them to clean and emulsify even more contaminants. 12.
