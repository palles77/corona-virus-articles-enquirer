It must always be confirmed with a further CBC, since there are situations that can give rise to a false increase in platelet count (mixed cryoglobulinaemia or cellular lysis). 1, 4, 5 Four degrees of thrombocytosis have been described: mild (500,000---700,000/mm 3 ), moderate (700,000---900,000/mm 3 ), severe (>900,000/mm 3 ) and extreme or massive (>1,000,000/mm 3 ). 2, 6 The aim must be to stabilise and treat the patient so as to determine subsequently whether the thrombocytosis is secondary (Table 3 ) and a thorough physical examination (ruling out the presence of visceromegaly or adenopathy), as soon as the patient is admitted, help to guide the diagnosis. 1, 3, 4 The differential diagnosis must be made step-by-step, based on the patient's signs and symptoms. 3 The diagnostic tests indicated will be those that provide useful information with an appropriate risk---benefit ratio. Bearing in mind the most prevalent causes of thrombocytosis in childhood, the following tests could be considered: (a) sterile body fluid cultures, blood tests and molecular biology techniques , and (e) assess the need to carry out suction and biopsy of bone marrow. 1---4,6 Most patients will remain asymptomatic. Regardless of the cause of thrombocytosis, a high platelet count can be associated with vasomotor phenomena (headache, visual symptoms, nausea, chest pain, dysaesthesia, aphasia, dysarthria, vertigo, instability, shivering or erythromelalgia), thrombotic phenomena or haemorrhagic complications (Table 4 ). 1, 5 The vasomotor phenomena arise from intravascular platelet activation. Normally, reactive thrombocytosis does not entail a greater risk of thromboembolic events or haemorrhagic complications. 7 On the other hand, in primary forms, this activation is symptomatic in up to 25---40% of patients. 2, 5 In our patient, the episodes of headache and abdominal pain may have been related to the extreme thrombocytosis.",
