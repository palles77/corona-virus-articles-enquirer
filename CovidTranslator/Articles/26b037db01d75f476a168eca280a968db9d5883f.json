As of February 22, 2020, widespread humanto-human transmission has resulted in 76,396 cases with 2,348 deaths in 26 countries. Clinically, we have found that some patients had initial negative RT-PCR results, but chest CT had typical imaging findings, including ground-glass opacification (GGO) and/or mixed consolidation. Early detection, early diagnosis, early isolation, and early treatment of these cases can effectively control the spread of the epidemic and the emergence of large outbreaks.",

The collection, transportation, storage, nucleic acid detection reagents, and nucleic acid amplification instruments of the clinical samples were performed strictly in accordance with the standards recommended by the Chinese Center for Disease Control. Therefore, the most likely cause of the positive result of the fourth swab test for SARS-CoV-2 is a considerable increase in the amount of virus, which is related to the worsening of the patient's condition. Firstly, the clinical manifestations of the patient showed significant symptoms of high fever, shortness of breath, cough, sputum, and fatigue, compared with that at admission. Secondly, bilateral coarse breath sounds with wet rales distributed at the bases of both lungs were heard on auscultation. Thirdly, repeat chest CT showed a great progression of multi-focal GGO and mixed consolidation that most appeared at peripheral area of both lungs compared to the previous chest CT. One study illustrated that the CT imaging feature of COVID-19 pneumonia is bifocal extra-zonal distribution, bilateral and multifocal [3] . Another study showed that chest CT was more sensitive than RT-PCR (98% and 71%, respectively) [4] .This is consistent with the imaging findings of this case we reported.",

However, due to the time-consuming laboratory tests and the lack of viral substances in the samples, the RT-PCR positive rate is relatively low, so it cannot meet the needs of the growing infected population. If patients have clinical symptoms, epidemiological characteristics, and chest CT imaging characteristics of viral pneumonia that are compatible with COVID-19 infection, we need to carefully consider the isolation and treatment of these patients even if the RT-PCR test is negative.",
