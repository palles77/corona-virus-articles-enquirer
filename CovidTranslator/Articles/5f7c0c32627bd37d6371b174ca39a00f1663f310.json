A selected panel of serum and fecal samples from different dog populations in The Netherlands, with or without a history of acute diarrhea, was therefore assayed in the respective ELISA systems. Results obtained in the two serological ELISAs, which are based on different principles, showed a good correlation. These data and the results obtained in the antigen ELISAs provide evidence that CPV is the major cause of viral gastrointestinal disease in dogs in The Netherlands. CCV infections were also shown to occur more frequently in dogs with a history of gastroenteritis and diarrhea. No indications that rotavirus infections are important in this respect were found.",

The CPV vaccination status of the dogs in kennels with recurrent acute diarrhea is assumed to be similar to that of dogs in the open dog population, since a general vaccination strategy is advised in The Netherlands. This consists of a first vaccination between 8 and 12 weeks of age, a second vaccination between three and four months, and annual revaccination.",

Volumes of 0.1 ml containing 250 ng of each mAb in carbonate buffer, pH 9.6, were incubated in microtiter plates for 16 h at 4 \u00b0 C. 50/zl of serial twofold dilutions of dog serum samples, starting at 1 : 5, were incubated simultanously with 50 #1 of CPV-containing culture supernatant (HA titer= 1024) of infected A-72 cells at an optimal dilution for 16 h at 20 \u00b0C. Remaining binding of CPV was detected by incubation with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated mAbs H-1 and H-2. All dilutions were made in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 80, 1% BSA and 1 M NaC1. The plates were washed twice after each incubation. All optimal dilutions of the reagents used in all the ELISA systems were determined by checkerboard titration. 0.1 ml substrate solution (0.1 mg/ml tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) (Sigma, St. Louis, U.S.A. ) and 0.003% H_~O2 in 0.1 M NaAc buffer, pH 5.5 ) was added to each well. After 10 min incubation at room temperature, 0.1 ml of 2 M H2SO4 was added to stop the color reaction. Absorbance at 450 nm was read in a Titertek Multiscan (Flow Laboratories). The test samples were considered to be positive if a reduction of absorbance at 450 nm of 50% or more was observed.",

Results obtained with the same sera in the CTB-ELISA system, which is based on a different principle, correlated well with those obtained in the indirect ELISA system. This is a clear indication of the specificities of both systems for antibodies to the respective viruses. The specificities of these ELISA systems were also confirmed by the fact that all sera from the SPF dogs tested were negative in all the ELISAs. The sensitivity of the indirect ELISA system proved to be generally higher than that of the CTB-ELISA system. The indirect ELISA system for the detection of antibodies to CPV, in which monoclonal antibodies were used as capture antibodies, proved to be very sensitive.",

The CTB-ELISA system, although slightly less sensitive, has the advantage that one less washing step is needed, which makes it even more suitable for large-scale screening. Another advantage of this system is that serum samples from other animal species can also be tested. Cats and mink, for example, which may be infected with mink enteritis virus or feline panleukopenia virus -two viruses closely related to CPV -can be screened. The indirect ELISA system, however, has the advantage that, if the appropriate anti-Ig reagents are used, antiviral antibodies of the IgM class can also be detected. This is of diagnostic relevance since it may be indicative of recent infections, as has been shown for CPV infections (Florent, 1986 ) .",

            "text": "In the Dutch open dog population, the majority of the animals tested (79%) proved to have CPV-specific serum antibodies; this is probably due to both natural infections and the high vaccination level. The percentage of CPV-seropositive dogs in kennels with a history of acute infectious diarrhea was considerably higher (91%), and antibody titers were generally higher, in this group ( Fig. 1 ) : 62% of the samples from these kennels had CPV antibody titers > 640 in the indirect ELISA, whereas only 34% of the dogs in the open population had titers > 640. The most likely explanation for these high percentages may be the active circulation of natural CPV infections in these kennels, since no clear differences in vaccination policy between the two groups tested could be expected to occur, because a general vaccination strategy is advised in The Netherlands. Similarly, a difference was found between the incidence and titers of antibodies against CCV. In problem kennels 61% of the dogs were seropositive for CCV (22% with titers > 160), whereas 45% of the dogs in the open population were seropositive (5% with titers >_ 160). Since vaccination against CCV infection was not carried out in either group at that time, these differences must be considered a reflection of differences in circulating natural CCV infections. There proved to be little difference in the percentages of rotavirus-seropositive dogs between the two groups (91% and 89% respectively). Since neither group had been vaccinated against this virus infection, it can be concluded that most of the dogs tested had acquired natural rotavirus infections. It cannot be concluded from these data that this infection is a major cause of diarrhea in adult dogs. They rather suggest that rotavirus infection, as has been described for other mammalian species, mainly causes problems in young animals (Ghose et al., 1978 ) .",

This confirmed both the specificity and the sensitivity of this ELISA Teramoto et al., 1984; Rimmelzwaan et al., 1990) . The specificities of the antigen ELISAs were further confirmed by using the appropriate specific antiviral antibodies in CTB-ELISAs with all the positive fecal samples, and by showing that all the samples from SPF dogs were negative. The sensitivities of the assays were estimated by relating positivity to minimal titers of infectious virus (for CPV and CCV) or to the number of complement-fixing units (for rotavirus) in the positive fecal samples. The results obtained with these ELISAs showed that CPV was present in none of the dogs of the open population and in 37% of the dogs in kennels with recurrent diarrhea. It may there-fore be concluded that CPV is a major cause of acute infectious diarrhea in kennels. CCV was found in 11% of the feces samples from dogs with diarrhea in kennels with recurrent problems, in 7% of the feces samples from dogs in the open population without diarrhea, and double infections with CPV and CCV were found in 7% of the dogs with diarrhea. The role of CCV in the problems in the kennels was therefore less clear. The fact that no rotavirus antigen was found in the feces of any of the dogs tested is consistent with the serological findings, which showed no clear difference between the open population and the kennels, and suggests that rotavirus infections are not a major cause of the recurrent problems in the kennels.",
