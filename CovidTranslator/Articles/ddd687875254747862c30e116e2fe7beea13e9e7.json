The genomic RNA of the virus population (JHM-CC virus) released from different passage levels of the same persistent infection has also been analyzed. The analysis shows the locations within the genomic and intracellular RNAs of more than 45 Ti-resistant oligonucleotides and confirm earlier studies (J. L. Leibowitz, K. C. Wilhelmsen, and C. W. Bond (1981), virdogy 114,39-51), showing that the six subgenomic RNAs of MHV-JHM form a 3' coterminal nested set which extends for different lengths in a 5' direction. The analysis also identifies in each subgenomic RNA those large Ti oligonucleotides derived from noncontiguous regions of the genome during mRNA synthesis. Two important conclusions can be reached from analysis of the mutant viruses. First, the virus population released from the persistent infection represents a fairly constant mixture of viruses, and the fluctuating emergence of variants as predominant species in the culture does not occur. Second, the data indicate that for particular intracellular RNAs of mutant viruses the sequence rearrangements occurring during subgenomic mRNA synthesis are different from those in the corresponding intracellular RNA of wild-type virus. The result may indicate a potential flexibility in the leader/body fusion process that has not been previously recognized. o",

The most studied member of the group is mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) which has a single, positive-stranded genomic RNA of 5.4-6.7 X lo6 molecular weight (Lai and Stohlman, 1978; Leibowitz et al, 1981; Spaan et &, i 1981; Wege et al, 1978 Wege et al, , 1981 Yogo et aL, 1977) . In cells infected with MHV six species of subgenomic mRNA, together with a genomic-size mRNA, are produced (and are numbered in order of decreasing size). These mRNAs form a 3' coterminal \"nested\" set but each has at its 5' terminus a common leader, derived from sequences at the 5' end of the genome (Baric et al, 1983; Cheley et ak, 1981; Lai et ah, 198313; Spaan et ah, 1982 Spaan et ah, , 1983 . As MHV replicates in the cytoplasm Wilhelmsen et aL, 1981) and mRNA synthesis does not involve the processing of larger precursor RNAs (Jacobs et d, 1981) , coronaviruses appear to have evolved a novel mechanism of mRNA synthesis involving the cytoplasmic fusion of noncontiguous transcripts (Spaan et al, 1983) . In the infected cell the synthesis of viral polypeptides is initiated independently (Siddell, 1982 (Siddell, , 1983 and in tivo and in vitro translation studies have shown that mRNA7, mRNA6, and mRNA3 encode the virion nucleocapsid protein (NP), the matrix protein (El), and the precursor of the peplomer protein (E2), respectively (Leibowitz et c& 1982; Rottier et aL, 1981b; Siddell et d, 1980 , Siddell, 1983 .",

Previously, we have established an in vitro persistent infection with MHV-JHM in a DBT cell line (JHM-CC), and found that the virus population released from this culture (JHM-CC virus) formed small plaques on DBT cells and possessed lower virulence to ICR mice when compared with original MHV-JHM (Hirano et aL, 1981; Makino et uL, 1982) . Histopathological examination revealed that after infection with JHM-CC virus, the acute encephalitis characteristic of infection with wild-type virus was absent and instead sharply delineated demyelinating lesions were produced in the brain and spinal cord. The JHM-CC virus will therefore be very useful for studying the pathogenesis of demyelination. In our initial studies (Makino et cd, 1983) we have characterized the virological features of two small plaque mutant viruses, la and 2c, which were isolated from the JHM-CC virus population. In contrast to wild-type MHV-JHM these mutants grew more slowly, produced no prominent cell fusion during infection, and possessed different amounts and molecular-weight forms of the virion peplomer protein E2.",

Prior to RNase T1 digestion the RNAs were analyzed on glyoxal agarose gels (data not shown) and found to have identical electrophoretic mobilities, corresponding to an estimated molecular weight of 5.4 X lo6 (Lai and Stohlman, 1978; Makino et aL, 1934) . In order to positively identify each oligonucleotide, mixtures of the genomic RNA of MHV-JHM and la and also MHV-JHM and 2c were digested together and the resulting oligonucleotide maps are shown in Figs. 1D and E, respectively. Careful examination of these fingerprints shows that more than 45 characteristic oligonucleotides can be identified in the genomic RNA of MHV-JHM. A single oligonucleotide (indicated by an arrow in Fig.  1A ) was not reproducibly found. An oligonucleotide fingerprint of this complexity corresponds well to a single-stranded RNA of this size which does not contain extensive sequence reiteration. The oligonucleotide fingerprint of MHV-JHM shown here is also very similar to that described by Stohlman et al. (1982) . We have therefore adapted the numbering system used by Stohlman et al, additionally numbering four oligonucleotides which are unique to our MHV-JHM isolate as 2a, 2b, 26b, and 37a. When the oligonucleotide fingerprint of the wild-type MHV-JHM is compared to those of the mutant viruses la and 2c, a number of significant differences can be found and these differences are summarized schematically in Fig. 2 . Essentially both mutants lacked the oligonucleotides 2b, 4, 6, 17, and 26b (indicated by arrow heads in Fig. 1A ) of the wild-type MHV-JHM, and contained one new oligonucleotide, 26~ (arrows in Figs. 1B and C).

Map order of T1 oligonucleotide spots on the RNA genome of MHV-JHM, la, and 3~. The order of the oligonucleotides within every region separated by vertical lines is arbitrary. The proposed seven genetic regions are based on the data described in the present study and from others (Lai et al, 1981; Siddell, 1983) . Each region corresponds to the position of each viral intracellular RNA species which does not overlap with the neighboring-intracellular RNA species. a firm basis for further studies on the genetic structure and expression of a virus which is becoming increasingly useful for the study of pathogenetic aspects of virusinduced demyelination (Herndon et aL, 1975; Knobler et a& 1981; Nagashima et aL, 1978) . The presumptive location of every large oligonucleotide on the genome of MHV-JHM is shown in Fig. 6 . These experiments also identify for the first time oligonucleotide 8 as being derived from sequences which are encompassed within the leader of MHV-JHM. Also in each subgenomic RNA of MHV-JHM (with the exception of RNAZ) oligonucleotides can be identified which are not found in genomic RNA and it can be assumed that these \"unique\" oligonucleotides have arisen from the combination of sequences during the, synthesis of mRNAs involving the joining of leader and body transcripts (Lai et aL, 1983b; Spaan et aL, 1933) . It is interesting to note that at least for some of the subgenomic RNAs (e.g., RNA7 and RNAG) these \"unique\" oligonucleotide are apparently very similar in their electrophoretic behavior, suggesting that the sequences combined during RNA synthesis may be very similar. In other cases, however, e.g., RNA5, the \"unique\" oligonucleotide is clearly different, suggesting the combination of different sequences (the differences most probably being derived from the mRNA body). In one case, RNAb, two such oligonucleotides are identified. The explanation of this result requires further study but it is perhaps noteworthy that in the case of mutant virus RNAs (see below) such a result is found when a mixture of two RNAs are analyzed. Oligonucleotide analysis of the mutant virus genomic RNA and subgenomic RNAs leads to two conclusions. First, regarding the synthesis of subgenomic RNAs; in RNA7 of mutant 2c one oligonucleotide, 2, is clearly found which has been mapped FIG. 7.

The high rates of replication of RNA viruses also contribute to this high mutation frequency (Holland et al, 1982) . Oligonucleotide fingerprinting of the virus populations released from different passages of the JHM-CC culture and isolates from the culture provides evidence that mutations are readily produced and accumulated in the MHV-JHM genome. This conclusion would also support previous descriptions of MHV gene diversification reported by Lai et al. (1983a) . The oligonucleotide fingerprintings also show that the virus population released from the JHM-CC culture is relatively constant, although the differences shown for the mutants la and 2c, which were both isolated from the 133V population, demonstrate that individual viruses within the population can have different genetic structures. In the JHM-CC culture there does not appear to be any fluctuating emergence of variants which predominate the culture at any one time. This is in contrast to the situation reported in several other virus systems (Holland et al, 1979 (Holland et al, , 1982 Meinkoth and Kennedy, 1980) , although in these cases defective interfering (DI) particles appeared to play a role, while in the JHM-CC culture there is no evidence for the presence of DI particles (Hirano et aL, 1981) .",
