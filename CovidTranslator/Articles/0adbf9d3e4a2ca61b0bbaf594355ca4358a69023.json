Although normal human cells possess TK, the affinity of acyclovir for viral TK is approximately 200 times greater than for human TK. The monophosphate then undergoes two additional host cell enzyme-mediated phosphorylations to acyclovir triphosphate (acycloguanosine triphosphate), which preferentially inhibits viral DNA polymerase, competitively and through chain termination. The higher concentrations of the activated form in infected cells and its affinity for viral polymerases result in low toxicity to normal host cells.",
