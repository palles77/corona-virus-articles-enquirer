He points out that ''flattening'' the world will disrupt both traditional and developing societies in ways that are bound to be surprising and swift. For example, a new health care industry has emerged in India and Australia where computed axial tomography (CAT) scans are read for small and medium sized hospitals in the United States. Compressing the digital images allows more rapid reading of scans, provides lower costs and greater access to skilled radiology services in smaller and rural organizations, and efficiently deploys limited resources. This is one of the many examples of ''disruptive'' technologies and solutions that combine technology and the ready sources of skilled labor to lower costs for providing the same quality of services in other nations. Similar disruptive technologies will aid our monitoring of global diseases and treatments.",

Evidence-based solutions are emerging to address issues such as quality and safety; technological solutions, to address access and cost and workforce shortages. While many specific solutions to these issues depend upon the structure of the particular health care system and the resources available for health and health care issues, there are many common issues that need sound research to promote promising policies and practices. For example, to facilitate safety and quality collaboration across their two nations, the Institute for Healthcare Improvement (IHI), a U.S. organization focused on patient safety, has worked closely with The Health Foundation in the United Kingdom to carry out the Safer Patients Initiative (SPI).",

            "text": "A shortage of health care workers is another issue that crosses international boundaries and has become particularly acute in developed nations where the population is aging. Workforce shortages have spurred increased migration of workers from developing countries (Bhorat, Meyer and Mlatsheni 2002; Findlay and Lowell 2002; Stillwell et al. 2003; Dovlo 2004 ) to developed countries. English-speaking countries in Africa and Asia are losing a significant number of health care professionals, mainly nurses and doctors, to wealthier English-speaking countries. Nearly 30 percent of every graduating class of newly examined physicians in Ghana migrate each year. Migration has implications for both the nations that ''export'' and ''import'' these health care workers and has led to worldwide attempts to redress the consequences. For example, the 57th World Health Assembly passed a resolution in May 2004 calling for mechanisms to compensate poor countries that lose health care workers to wealthy countries.",
