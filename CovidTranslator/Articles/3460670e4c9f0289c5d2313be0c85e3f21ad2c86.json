Nine derivatives showed potent activity with IC 50 values from 0.48 to 6.22 lM. 5-Oxo-13-TBDMS-taxchinin A (11) and 5-oxo-13,15-epoxy-13-epi-taxchinin A (15) are the most potent derivatives, with IC 50 at 0.48 and 0.75 lM, respectively. The structure-activity relationship (SAR) of these compounds established that exocyclic unsaturated ketone at ring C is the key structural element for the activity, while the a,b-unsaturated ketone positioned at ring A has no effect for the activity. The significant cytotoxicity of derivatives 11 and 15 may be due to the conformational change in the taxane rings. The 3D-QSAR study was conducted on this series of compounds, which provided optimal predictive comparative molecular field (CoM-FA) model with cross-validated r 2 (q 2 ) value of 0.64.",

Michael reaction acceptors are considered as a class of biological activity molecules, directly or indirectly involved in the life processes, are regulators in many signaling pathway in cells, and have played an important role in chemical biology studies. One Michael acceptor CRA-3316 developed to treat Chagas's disease is in clinical trials. 10 Another Michael acceptor AG7088 (Ruprintrivir) has entered phase II clinical studies with human as a potential nasally delivered antirhinoviral agent.

The significant cytotoxicity of the 5-oxo-13-substituted taxchinin A 11 and 15 may be due to the conformational change in the taxane rings as reflected in certain key J-coupling. The coupling constant between H-2 and H-3 is an important descriptor of the shape of the taxoids, which serves as a reporter of the dihedral angle along the bottom portion of the B ring. [15] [16] [17] Among all obtained taxoids (1-23), only compounds 11 and 15 showed similar coupling constant between H-2 and H-3 (Table 2 ). In compound 11 the J 2-3 is 7.6 Hz; in 15 it is 7.1 Hz, which suggested that 11 and 15 might have the similar conformations which are different from those of the other derivatives.",

It shows regions where variations of steric and electrostatic nature in the structural features of the different molecules contained in the training set lead to increase or decrease in the activity. The CoMFA steric field is presented as contour plots in Figure 3A . To aid in visualization, compound 11 is displayed in the map as reference structure. A huge sterically favorable region (Fig. 3A , green contour) is located near the atoms C-13, C-14, and C-2, suggesting that bulky groups in this area would increase the cytotoxicity. The yellow region indicates that the bulky substitute near the atoms C-4 and C-5 is not favorable to the activity. CoMFA electrostatic contour map is shown in Figure 3B . To aid in visualization, compound 15 is displayed in the map as reference structure. There is a big blue polyhedron near the atoms C-14, C-1, C-2, indicating that more positive charges in this region should play a favorable role in improving cytotoxicity. There are two small red polyhedra surrounding atom C-5, suggesting that negatively charged substituents in this area lead to an increase of cytotoxicity.

Moreover, 5-oxo-13-substituted taxchinin A 11 and 15 are the most potent derivatives among this series of compounds with IC 50 of 0.48 and 0.75 lM, respectively, which may be due to the conformational change in the taxane rings, as reflected in the key J-coupling between H-2 and H-3. Further investigation on the SAR utilizing a CoMFA method was carried out. The resulting 3D-QSAR model provides an invaluable tool to design more cytotoxic compounds. With the employment of all of these results, further design, synthesis, and cytotoxic evaluation are ongoing in our laboratory and the results will be reported in due course. 13 Compound 1 (400 mg, 0.65 mmol) was dissolved in N,N-dimethylformamide (3 mL).

A solution of 11 (60 mg, 0.083 mmol) in tetrahydrofuran was treated with a 70% solution of hydrogen fluoride in pyridine (0.46 mL) and stirred for 2 h at room temperature. The reaction mixture was diluted with ethyl acetate and the reaction was quenched with aqueous sodium bicarbonate (10 mL). The organic layer was separated, washed with aqueous copper(II) sulfate and brine, dried (Na 2 SO 4 ), and concentrated.
