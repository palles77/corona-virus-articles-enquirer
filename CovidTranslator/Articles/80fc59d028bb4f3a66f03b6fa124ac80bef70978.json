In fact, studies in the mouse have shown that T cell immunodominance can Crossreactive T cells may have widely different affinities to two different targets, but certain aspects of a be greatly affected by previous antigenic exposures that might elicit crossreactive responses. Brehm et al. viral infection may augment the significance of a lowaffinity crossreaction. Studies on T cell recognition using showed that LCMV and PV encoded crossreactive epitopes, with six of eight amino acids in common (Figure amino acid substitutions in target peptide epitopes have indicated that highly activated T cells during an acute 1) (Brehm et al., 2002). Responses to these epitopes were subdominant in each infection, accounting for less response in LCMV infection can lyse a broader range of targets than can less activated T cells (Bachmann than 3% and 1% of the acute and memory CD8 responses, respectively, for each infection. However, if et al., 1997). This suggests that lower-affinity altered peptide ligands might more easily activate effectors or LCMV-immune mice were infected with PV, or if PVimmune mice were infected with LCMV, the T cell re-effector memory cells in comparison to resting memory CD8 T cells. The virus-induced cytokine environment sponses to these epitopes became dominant, reaching levels as high as 20% of the CD8 T cells. In contrast, may also enhance crossreactive effector responses; for instance, since cytokines such as IL-12 are known to T cell responses to the normally dominant epitopes were much lower. Thus, infections with heterologous viruses synergize with antigen to enhance IFN\u2425 production by T cells it is easy to envision IL-12 enhancing IFN\u2425 pro-can alter immunodominance when crossreactive responses are present. This phenomenon is reminiscent duction in low-affinity TCR interactions(Gately et al., 1998).of the concept of clonal imprinting or original antigenicT cells with one LCMV epitope specificity but other times elicited the expansion of T cells with a different specificity. This could be explained by the stochastic nature of clonal dominance and by the private specificities in antigen-specific TCR repertoires in each immune host. This would predict that the proportion of epitope-specific memory T cells crossreactive with another antigen would differ from host to host. This is indeed what wehave observed in LCMV-immune hosts challenged with VV (Kim et al., 2002; S.K. Kim and R.M.W., unpublished data) (Figure 2). Prior immunity to LCMV also had a dramatic impact on immunopathology upon VV challenge. In the systemic (i.p.) model, the mice developed severe mononuclear infiltration and acute necrosis of the visceral fat pads (Selin et al., 1998). This type of pathology is known as panniculitis, and it can occur in humans with lupus erythematosis and Weber-Christian syndrome (Welsh and Selin, 2002).

On the other hand, a human T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire study using CD45RA andThis variation in phenotypes of memory T cell populations following different virus infections and between CD62L to define effector and memory populations found that 90% of the clonotypes were not in common be-different epitopes of the same virus would favor the concept that memory subsets are defined by their initial tween the effector and central memory CD8 T cell populations(Baron et al., 2003). This surprising result would and ongoing antigenic experience and cytokine environment. Similarly, there may be significant flexibility in suggest that a differentiation pathway between those subsets was less likely or else that there was a very converting from one phenotype to another, depending",
