Although discourses in collaborative learning have been analyzed with traditional qualitative approaches in the learning sciences field, it is difficult to capture the group dynamics. Hence, we are trying to establish a methodology for discourse analysis in collaborative learning from the perspective of complex network science. In order to conduct this study effectively, we are currently developing an application platform, called Knowledge Building Discourse Explorer (KBDeX). The goal of this project is not only to facilitate productive communication between researchers who are concerned with research on knowledge building or emergent collaborative learning, but also to encourage students to explore their own group dynamics by themselves. KBDeX is an analysis platform to visualize network structures of discourse based on the bipartite graph of words \u00d7 discourse units. KBDeX can visualize them into three different network structures of: (1) students, (2) discourse units, and (3) selected words. The users can explore these three networks with its coefficients and analyze the discourse across phases or in a and stepwise way. Using discourse which has been already analyzed with a traditional qualitative approach, we will demonstrate the beneficial attributes of the KBDeX platform.",

In cases like scripted cooperation (O'Donnell, 1999) or reciprocal teaching (Rosenshine, & Meister, 1994) , students' roles are specified in efforts to create the ideal situation for collaboration. Knowledge building, on the other hand, is quite opposite to this stream. Students are encouraged to collaborate with one another in a flexible manner even though they are allocated into groups. The time schedule should not be fixed because of the emergent nature of the learning, and we do not expect students to see an end to their learning.",

Thus far, researchers have applied three methodological approaches to capture the nature of knowledge building. The first approach establishes the rubrics of content knowledge that researchers expect the learners to acquire following their learning. The researchers can then identify whether learners' knowledge advances or not based on their established rubrics. The second approach involves researchers in analyzing the process of learning by breaking it into small units to categorize into different cognitive actions. This allows them to identify patterns or models of cognitive processes that the students engage in (e.g., van Aalst, 2009) . The third approach is fine-grained discourse analysis performed as a case study, which helps researchers describe what is happening in students' collaborative learning (Oshima et al., 2006) . The combination of discourse analysis and narrative is a popular methodology for analyzing the classroom environment.",

Regarding the content of knowledge, we are not only concerned with deep comprehension of domain-specific knowledge but also epistemic operation by learners to advance their collective knowledge. Since the epistemic operation is a process, a static evaluation of knowledge will not capture its dynamics. Categorization of the cognitive processes that learners engage in might capture the epistemic operation, but it is so content-free that we cannot describe what knowledge learners actually develop. Consequently, fine-grained discourse analysis with narratives would be the last option. Although the microscopic view of discourse analysis provides us with details about how learners develop their collective knowledge within a period of time, we also need to describe its macroscopic view so that we can verify why the detected microscopic discourse should be important to argue and how the detected pieces of discourses are placed in the macro structure of collaboration.",

The network structure created through such communication generates new insights and creates new knowledge (Davis, & Sumara, 2006; Scardamalia, & Bereiter, 2005) . Complex network science (e.g., Strogatz, 2001 ) is based on an analytic approach to describing a variety of network structures developed by statistical physics (e.g., the smallworld and scale-free network structures). Oshima et al. (2007) argued that the complex network science approach was useful for evaluating collective knowledge advancement in computer supported collaborative learning, and demonstrated how the complexity system based on discourse on genetically modified foods by 5th grade students was different from that by experts. Zhang et al. (2009) used social network analysis to visualize and compare classroom collaboration among 4th graders on Knowledge Forum \u00ae across three years, and concluded that knowledge advancement was facilitated when the participation structure was more distributed. These studies were focused on the issue of how to visualize the macro structure of collaboration appropriately, and were not concerned with its relation to conventional approaches to discourse analysis. In this study, we consider how to make the macroscopic discourse analysis informative for the microscopic discourse analysis. Particularly, we attempt to focus our attention on the individual differences in learners' contributions to discourse in collaborative learning.",

The topics posed to the students were \"Outbreaks of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)\" and \"Avian Flu in 2003 and 2004.\" The students could build on their knowledge of science by studying what was known about these phenomena or they could, for example, critique media attention, examine the economic impact, or form a position on how governments should have responded to the outbreaks. The second main topic on the 11th grade course syllabus was \"computer viruses,\" which was added to SARS and Avian Flu topics as a third main topic for inquiry, with the aim of having the students examine the nature of viruses in both biological and non-biological systems and identify patterns across them. The two classes shared a Knowledge Forum \u00ae database and worked on the same topics. To limit the number of notes they would encounter, the students were divided into four groups. Each group had students from both classes, with an equal number of students from each class; the students could choose their own groups but the teacher made some minor changes. Each group shared its own views on Knowledge Forum \u00ae , and the groups were not expected to interact with each other during the inquiry.",
