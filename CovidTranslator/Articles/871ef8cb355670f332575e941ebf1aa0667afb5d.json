[4] Cost increases are large, as highly resistant micro-organisms require systematic change to more expensive empiric therapy for all potentially infected patients as well as more intensive treatment for infected patients. [5] The incidence of infection and colonization by these organisms has risen steadily. [6] Transmission of highly resistant organism within ICUs is often a focus of infection control efforts. [7] [8] [9] [10] However, highly resistant organisms can also spread between hospitals via interhospital patient transfers. The most notable recent example was the iatrogenic spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Toronto. [11] Several other examples have been documented. [12] [13] [14] Patients may act as vectors if they are colonized by highly resistant organisms even when not actively infected. [15, 16] In contrast to these cases of documented spread across hospitals, most theoretical work on the spread of highly resistant organisms has focused on spread within a single hospital or population, [17] [18] [19] [20] although some account for local community interactions [21, 22] The interactions between multiple hospitals change not only transmission dynamics but also perversely weaken incentives for infection control within hospitals. [23] This study tested the hypothesis that the observed transfer patterns of critically ill patients could, in principle, distribute a highly resistant micro-organism throughout the United States. We then evaluated the relative value of uniform infection control efforts versus selected targeting of hospitals for infection control based on their position in the transfer network. We considered both a national perspective and a single-state perspective given the diverse decision-makers with stakes in ICU infections.",

We simulated two different levels of infectivity. In the maximal infectivity condition, the probability of transmission at any given transfer was 1 in the absence of infection control. In the moderate infectivity condition, the probability of transmission at any given transfer was 0.1 in the absence of infection control.

Indeed, concentrating intensive infection control resources at a small number of hospitals can be 16 times more effective than distributing the same resources uniformly across all hospitals with regard to stopping interhospital spread.

[3] Our simulation data further suggest that the time course of spread via transfers might be of the same order of magnitude as the widespread development of resistance due to antibiotic overuse. Spread within smaller regions or areas with more intensive transfer links would be expected to be faster, as was elegantly shown in an independent study of the Netherlands. [36] When a central hospital does a particularly effective job of limiting spread of a highly resistant micro-organism, this benefits not only the central hospital but also benefits all the hospitals that receive transfers from that central hospital. [23] Indeed, these benefits extend to several degrees of separation -infection control at the central hospital benefits hospitals that receive transfers from those hospitals that receive transfers from the central hospital, and so on. These network interdependencies might be termed \"network transmission externalities\". Despite such interdependencies, the existing structure of hospital epidemiology primarily focuses on infection control within a given hospital system. This organizational focus neglects the potential role of interhospital transfers and may be underresourced to alter the nationwide spread of highly resistant organisms. This work has practical implications for how we allocate infection control resources. From a practical perspective, this work strongly argues for regional coordination of infection control resources. There is no reason to think that outbreaks of highly resistant organisms are contained to a single institution. For many ICUs, their own antibiotic stewardship programs simply cannot eliminate the risk of highly resistant organisms unless the program is coordinated with those of sending hospitals, or the risk of spread from transferred patients is held to a low level. [23] Further, many hospitals may be as likely to acquire highly resistant organisms from transfers as they are to evolve highly resistant infections from their own antibiotic use. The optimal balance of resources between preventing endogenous development and spread of highly resistant organisms needs to be carefully weighed for each hospital. Both sources-not an exclusive focus on one or the other-require attention.",

There is already anecdotal evidence of a graded response. Many large academic medical centers employ teams of hospital epidemiologists substantially larger than those of community hospitals. Our results also suggest, but certainly do not prove, that policies of intensive early surveillance of all transferred patients might be particularly appropriate.

We argue that our results demonstrate the feasibility of such spread and argue for surveillance for such a possibility. Second, we have studies the US; parallel studies in other regions would be scientifically very productive. [36] Third, while we have examined several credible approaches to allocating infection control resources, we have not proven that the greedy algorithm is theoretically optimal -we have only demonstrated its superiority to other tested algorithms. [42, 43] Fourth, this exploration has focused on allocation when coordination is possible -it is not clear which approach is most robust if other hospitals can be expected to deviate from the allocation plan. Fifth, a full model-of substantially greater complexity-might account for transmission via brief community stays and non-ICU transfers; others have begun this important work at the scale of one county, rather than examining nationwide interdependence. [3] Finally, we have made simplifying assumptions about the nature of infection control allocation in the setting of scarce health care resources, and the ability to add additional resources for similar marginal cost; further, the high-degree of transmission spread suggested by the model at the most central hospitals may not be achievable in the real world.

New and virulent strains of bacteria and viruses, including the recent H1N1 influenza pandemic, make this problem particularly important. [44] We demonstrate that interhospital transfers of critically ill patients might form a vector for national-scale transmission of highly resistant microorganisms. Furthermore, we suggest that coordination between hospitals in allocating infection control resources could result in substantially decreased interhospital transmissibility with substantially lower total cost. The frequent transfer of patients between our ICUs results in substantial nationwide interdependence, and acknowledging and managing that interdependence may be important to public health and security.",
