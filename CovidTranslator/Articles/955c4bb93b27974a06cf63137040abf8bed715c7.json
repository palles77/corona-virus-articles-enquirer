Indeed, few viral diagnostic laboratories are readily accessible to most medical practitioners. In contrast, bacteriological diagnostic laboratories were widely available even prior to the advent of antibacterial drugs. Yet, it is commonly held that there are many times more viral induced diseases (albeit, often mild and self-limiting) than bacterial diseases. Routine diagnosis of the viral diseases seen in medical practice seems, therefore, to be overdue; especially since such experience would provide an invaluable foundation for the future rational use of antiviral drugs.",

The following discussion will, therefore, require a significant degree of conjecture about how medicine might be practiced when antiviral drugs are commonplace. It would be foolhardy to presume that in the future the use of antiviral drugs will always be based on a sound diagnosis, any more than is true today with the use of antibacterial agents. It must be acknowledged, however, that certain viral diseases can be rather firmly diagnosed on clinical and epidemiological grounds alone. We will not, therefore, take the unrealistic position that all viral disease must be diagnosed in the laboratory; indeed, it is more likely that in the foreseeable future few of the milder and self-limiting viral diseases will result in a laboratory diagnosis. We will, nonetheless, review human viral diseases and the problems of practical laboratory diagnosis. Predictions as to the nature of future antiviral drugs will at times require certain flights of fancy.",

Would present diagnostic procedures be adequate ? Let us further assume that viral diseases are handled in a manner similar to bacterial diseases; that is, an infected patient visits a physician, a hospital or a clinic, and ideally a culture is taken and sent to the laboratory. A bacterial pathogen is isolated, a presumptive identification of the type of organism is made, confirming tests and, in some cases, a drug sensitivity test is undertaken. In the meantime, the patient is frequently started on a course of antibacterial chemotherapy based on a number of factors such as the degree of illness, some distinctive clinical signs and symptoms, or simply on whimsy or intuition. Such treatment may be stopped or altered on the basis of laboratory results.

This is frequently not the case. When antibacterial sensitivity tests are required, results cannot be reported sooner than 48 hr after submission of the specimen. Too frequently, all bacterial diagnosis is equated with the rapid isolation of beta hemolytic streptococci, but defining whether the isolate is Streptococcus pyogenes, the more pathogenic streptococcus belonging to Lancefield group A, takes additional time. In bacterial diagnosis a presumptive rapid report can sometimes be made based on stained smears of specimens prior to cultivation of the organism, but it is not often appreciated that cultivation and identification of a specific bacterial pathogen can take considerable time. Generally, then, how do present virological methods compare to such bacteriological methods? As will be discussed, in certain cases they compare rather well, but in most cases not so well if viewed in the classical medical situation just described.",

Ninety-seven per cent of virus diagnostic laboratories surveyed in the United States and Canada isolate viruses in cell cultures, and over 25 per cent use this approach exclusively (Herrmann and Herrmann, 1976a) . Such a fact is not obvious from the published papers devoted to viral diagnosis that seem overwhelmingly to emphasize serological methods. But are cell culture methods adequate if an antiviral agent is to be used? Table 1 presents the experience in isolating more than 5000 viruses in cell culture. The data suggest that under optimal conditions, using specimens rich in virus, many viruses are detected after 1-2 days incubation, others in 3 4 days. Regrettably, conditions are very rarely optimal. The quantity of virus in a specimen is often slight, so the time for isolating 50 per cent of the viruses is no less than 3 days and more frequently longer. Clearly this is not completely adequate if a physician wishes to treat a patient with a drug specific for a certain kind of virus infection. In the overwhelming majority of viral infections, the laboratory data will be generated at a time when the patient is either well or recovering. The data in Table 1 are for the detection of a virus, the lengths of time do not involve specific viral identification, which may take weeks. The viral identification problem is not insurmountable for in many cases the virus either need not be identified, or at least need not be identified as to its specific serological type, as will be discussed later. It is clear, however, that cell culture methods for detecting human viruses require considerable improvement. Further, a full 80 per cent of specimens produce no viral isolate, even from patients with viral-like illnesses.",

In general, they fare less well than do cell culture methods. Any test that measures a rise in specific antibody using paired sera, that is, one blood sample taken at the acute stage of illness and a second taken 2 4 weeks later, could only rarely have any pertinence to drug treatment. Further, the measurement of antibodies requires specific viral antigens and since there are at least 70 such antigens for the enteroviruses and 120 for the rhinoviruses, the cumbersome nature of this system and its limitations become obvious. A similar problem exists in using fluorescent or other labeled antibodies to detect viruses either in specimens or in cell cultures. The fluorescent method is rapid (1 2 hr) for diagnosing herpetic infections but significantly less sensitive than viral isolation in cell cultures (Cho and Feng, 1978) . The large number of serologically distinct viruses one might find on a throat swab (Table 2) , for example, makes this method impractical for general use and despite the fact that fluorescent methods have been known for well over 20 years, they have been used in a limited and specific way when used at all in the general diagnosis of viral disease.",

In many cases the detection of viral specific IgM antibody can be rather suggestive in the somewhat chronic viral disease and even permit the inception of effective therapy. With most viral disease, however, it is unlikely that the IgM antibody level would be detectable early enough for the effective use of antiviral drugs. It would be difficult to envisage a program that would have to measure hundreds of different types of IgM antibodies in the diagnosis of most viral diseases.

It is the need for specific antibodies that can make this a time-consuming and expensive procedure, likely the most expensive part of viral diagnosis. Is this entirely necessary ? In many cases, it is not. Indeed, attempting to serotype one of the 120 rhinoviruses is an impossible task for a general virus diagnostic laboratory. The emphasis on serotyping viruses goes back to the hope of vaccines for controlling most viral disease, where the antigenic nature of a virus is important. What is its importance in chemotherapy? The vast number of serotypes of pneumococci or salmonella, for example, is of little importance to a chemotherapeutic attack on these bacteria (albeit, not always successful). Some may feel that use of amantadine and rimantadine, both of which are active only against influenza type A viruses and not type B, justifies serological identification. The fact that these two types of influenza viruses differ sharply in their sensitivity to amantadine establishes they are biochemically distinct and it may well be only incidental that they are also serologically different. Biochemical markers would likely be more useful in virus identification. Even the sensitivity to antiviral agents may be useful as a biochemical identification test.",

Amantadine is widely used in continuous therapy of Parkinsonism, suggesting that it is very well tolerated and would certainly be so when used for prophylaxis during an influenza type A outbreak. Amantadine is also approved for management of such viral infections, with some therapeutic benefit if used early in the course of influenza (Togo et al., 1970) . Wisdom would dictate that monitoring for the presence of influenza viruses in a community is the minimum requirement for proper use of these anti-influenzal drugs, otherwise amantadine might well be used on patients not infected by influenzaviruses of the A type. Such a use might be considered poor judgment.

Recently adenine arabinoside (araA) has been marketed for the same purpose. Although both compounds are inhibitory to herpes and poxviruses' DNA synthesis, neither is helpful for infections of the eye caused by adenoviruses which are also DNA viruses and largely resistant to these inhibitors. It is unlikely that an adenovirus induced conjunctivitis would be easily confused with a classical dendritic ulcer produced by herpes simplex virus (HSV). It can be presumed, however, that both IUdR and araA are used often in the absence of any virus laboratory tests. There are certain HSV eye infections that are deeper and more serious and might not be readily recognized as induced by this virus. In such cases there is much justification for laboratory confirmation of such infections. Generally, however, it is best to know early that the infection is indeed associated with HSV since, in our experience, many specimens taken from those with eye diseases produce no virus isolates, suggesting that certain eye infections may not be all that easy to diagnose by clinical observations alone.",

There are, however, convincing data that topical application of idoxuridine in dimethyl sulfoxide produces therapeutic effects on HSV and zoster virus induced dermal lesions (Herrmann and Herrmann, 1977a) . In many cases 'cold sores' and 'shingles\" can be recognized for what they are, but on some occasions the causal agents for these two diseases can be confused. This may not be of great importance since both are herpesviruses and sensitive to idoxuridine. Where viral diagnosis seems required is where there are lesions of the mucous membranes, many of which are not known to be of viral origin. Certain oral lesions are associated with HSV and coxsackieviruses of the A type and indeed, in our experience, sometimes with the B type virus. Further, the type A coxsackieviruses can produce dermal vesicles much like the vesicles produced by herpesviruses, and DNA inhibitors would have no effect on these RNA containing picornaviruses. Coxsackie A viruses tend to be summer visitors in temperate climates and with proper monitoring of the viruses in the community, one could be alerted to their presence, thus perhaps minimizing the confusion.",

Of some interest is phosphonoacetic acid (PAA), which, although not strikingly potent in cell cultures, has shown remarkable activity when applied topically to HSV infected mice (Klein et al., 1977) . Apparently this rather simple organic compound binds specifically with the DNA of herpesviruses. Although PAA is too toxic for human use, perhaps trisodium phosphonoformate will be better tolerated (Helgstrand et al., 1978) , and it may turn out that 9-(2-hydroxyethoxymethyl) guanine is the best of all the antiherpes compounds (Schaeffer et al., 1978) .

Those viral diseases that are clinically distinct would likely need no laboratory diagnosis (typical mumps, herpetic lesions, chicken pox, etc.) and with the remaining viral diseases, only determining that a virus is involved would be sufficient. Significant questions remain, however, as to whether interferons play a role in recovery from viral disease or whether they can even be used therapeutically in routine medical practice. It has also not been resolved whether much of human viral disease can even be prevented by continuous use ofinterferons or their inducers. As synthetic, specific antiviral drugs become more prominent, interferons appear to be declining in practical appeal.

A close look at virus detection by cell culture methods, however, suggests that little has changed since the human diploid fibroblast was introduced over 15 years ago. In some cases the inability to detect certain viruses in cell culture has encouraged the use of a number of additional methods such as those to detect hepatitis B virus antigen by radioimmunoassay. In that electron microscopy and fluorescent antibody methods have found only limited use (such as detection of rotaviruses in infant diarrhea) in the comprehensive virus diagnostic laboratory, these methods would likely be supplanted by cell culture procedures that are intrinsically more sensitive, if such methods existed. It would seem the future will demand continued improvement of cell culture procedures, to be used in such a manner that specific chemotherapy of viral diseases is possible. It is regrettable that in the last decade very little work has been done to improve cell culture methods while substantial efforts have been made on numerous tests for viral antibody. Such a continued lag will have serious effects on the wise use of antiviral drugs in the future.",

Only recently has there been some hope that a number of type A coxsackieviruses, most of which are now detected only in infant mice, may be detected in a rhabdomyosarcoma cell (Schmidt et al., 1975) . This cell, with its bizarre morphology, does not seem as yet completely adequate but it does illustrate that perhaps somewhere there is a cell that can detect these viruses that now are only detected expensively and inconveniently in infant mice. There is a substantial need for a substitute for primary rhesus monkey kidney cells which are so important for the detection of myxoviruses. This primary cell type ,which is almost always contaminated with monkey viruses, may not be readily available in the near future due to an Indian embargo on rhesus monkeys. Perhaps the declining availability of these cells has increased interest in a substitute. Recent studies indicate that a canine kidney cell line (MDCK), with trypsin and EDTA in the medium, is quite sensitive to human isolates of influenzaviruses A and B (Meguro et al., 1979) .

At present, hepatitis virus A and B, as well as non-A and non-B types, Epstein-Barr virus and a number of viruses associated with gastrointestinal upsets, cannot be cultured in a viral diagnostic laboratory.

Using certain halogenated pyrimidines (Staal and Rowe, 1975) to induce the detection of some viruses might be undertaken by using separate cultures. Such an approach could lead to a substantial duplication of cell cultures if it turns out that a number of substances are needed to enhance detection of many viruses. This use of multiple cell culture types, with and without inducers of viral activity, would be like the multiple media used for bacterial isolations. The number of types of cell cultures might be limited, however, by the knowledge of the nature of the sPecimen to be tested and perhaps even the nature of the illness.

HSV, from rather typical skin lesions, can be very often recognized by the type of cell culture it attacks and the nature of the cytopathic effect (Herrmann and Rawls, 1974) . This is often also true for varicella-zoster and cytomegaloviruses (Benyesh- Melnick, 1974; Schmidt, 1974) . In the case of a rhinovirus isolate, few laboratories even try to define its serological type. This class of virus can be defined by its cytopathic effect in certain cultures, its sensitivity to a low pH and resistance to lipid solvents. The use of differential cell cultures, the nature of the viral cytopathic effect and the use of biochemical tests would seem to be the wave of the future with only occasional need for specific typing antisera. To properly use an antiviral drug, there is a need to know the biochemical nature of a virus which may or may not be related to its serological nature. Why serotype an echovirus if, in fact, all echovirus disease responds to the same antiviral drug? Antiviral drugs themselves may become useful in defining the nature of the virus isolate. Indeed, in the future it may become necessary to define the sensitivity of a virus to antiviral drugs, as is now done in much of bacterial diagnosis. Viruses can become resistant to antiviral drugs (Herrmann and Herrmann, 1977b1 . What is not known is the impact this will have on the clinical use of such drugs, since laboratory observations of drug resistance are by no means directly transferable to the clinic. Antiviral drug sensitivity tests, therefore, would seem to be part of the future both for defining the type of virus isolated and to determine the best drug to use for a specific viral disease.",

This fact can be used to alert community physicians to what virus is 'going around' and the nature of the clinical disease associated with any particular virus. This 'virus alert' program has been in existence for some years (Herrmann and Herrmann, 1977c) . Publication in the news media alerts the public and the medical profession so there is at least some hope that the ill-advised use of antibacterial drugs can be avoided. Such an approach can be valuable with outbreaks of influenza, paramyxovirus, and enterovirus infections but is of little help with sporadic adeno or herpesvirus infections or other viral infections unassociated with a significant disease outbreak. Presently the approach to insect-borne (togavirus) viral disease is along the lines of a virus alert program. Although detection of such a virus infection is largely limited to a serological diagnosis, it can alert the community to the problem such drugs, were they available, could be used on likely cases, along with improved mosquito control. It is unlikely that rapid laboratory diagnosis in cell culture will be easily achieved for insect-borne viruses because of the general inaccessability of the virus, also a serious problem with HSV encephalitis. If there is no great improvement in the swiftness of viral diagnosis generally, then clinical diagnosis, along with the knowledge of the prevalence of certain types of viruses, may become the primary guide for using antiviral agents. This is not to say this is the most satisfactory approach. The exact definition of the infecting organism in each patient is always more desirable. The use of the 'virus alert' program seems a necessary compromise and can also make serological procedures of greater pertinence where there is an outbreak of influenza, paramyxovirus, rubella and togavirus disease. Serological diagnostic procedures would still not be useful as a guide in the treatment of most sporadic viral disease, nor in outbreaks that involve virus groups with many serotypes, as is the case with the picornaviruses. With all of this, however, it is likely the use of antiviral drugs will be based most often solely on the clinical picture. Broad spectrum antiviral drugs, therefore, seem a necessity if patients are to benefit.",

It is unlikely, for example, that one would attack bacterial disease by using drugs that produce only symptomatic relief, for in certain cases the bacteria would continue to multiply, producing an unhappy outcome. With viral diseases there are only a few that are life-threatening. One could in many cases let the virus multiply, resulting in a normal immune response, and just treat the symptoms and clinical signs of the disease. This is what is so frequently promised by over-the-counter drug advertising. Only recently, however, has aspirin been studied for its worth in the common cold, and found rather unimpressive if not likely to make the patient more infectious (Stanley et al., 1975) . If there are little or no data to support the present nostrums' abilities to produce symptomatic relief, this is far from saying it cannot be done. Even though we presently know very little of the pathogenic mechanisms of self-limiting viral diseases, one can still speculate that the part that bothers the patient most is, in fact, a virus induced toxemia. The virus may multiply in a limited area of the body such as the upper respiratory tract, but the illness is felt throughout the body. Tests for drugs that affect this toxemia would likely best be performed on human subjects, although some studies might be undertaken in mice using influenza virus and its long neglected associated toxin (Henle and Henle, 1946a,b) . It would seem worthwhile to study those diverse drugs presently on the market, under double-blind, controlled conditions, to find if any of a variety of pharmacological actions have some effect on the most common viral respiratory diseases, those that are truly self-limiting. Do various antiinflammatory drugs, analgesics or even certain tranquilizers have some useful effect? If so, then this would give an indication of the type of drugs that might be useful. It is not suggested that the drugs that are tested necessarily be the ones of choice but rather those that have similar activity and are very well tolerated. It is most clear, however, that if such drugs were found useful, then they would have to be relatively inexpensive and readily available if they were to have much impact on the vast number of viral ailments. One thinks, of course, mostly of the many types of human viral infections commonly lumped together as 'colds'. It is likely that there would be little viral laboratory diagnosis associated with the use of such drugs. It seems fair to say that there is almost no laboratory diagnosis of such diseases now and the vast majority of cases are not even seen by a physician. The physician tends to see the more severe and troublesome viral infections and these would be the ones requiring laboratory diagnosis, now and well into the future. This would be especially true when the disease was found not to respond to the hypothetical palliative measures suggested above.",

It is the latter group that must be dealt with in the viral diagnostic laboratory and treated more vigorously with potent drugs. It is possible that in the future certain drugs, both specifically antiviral and palliative, will be found effective for viral diseases where it is either not possible to isolate the virus, or the diagnostic procedures are too time-consuming and expensive.

It seems unlikely there will be a panacea for all viral diseases and, as each new approach becomes available to clinical practice, this will in large measure determine what laboratory tests must be undertaken, just as now occurs in bacteriology. The bacteriology laboratory must seek to determine the causal pathogen in relationship to potential treatment. For the future, therefore, one would expect that a virus isolate would be defined in a similar manner; hence, a major portion of the virus laboratory effort would be in classifying viruses according to their drug sensitivity. It must be expected that resistance to antiviral drugs will occur, inducing the search for new drugs or the use of drug combinations that do not encourage resistance development. As has been suggested, however, any drug approach to viral disease that is indirect and does not attack the specific viral induced mechanisms would not be likely to induce drug resistance (Herrmann and Herrmann, 1977b) .",

This approach has been productive but it will be limited since most viral disease cannot be defeated by highly potent metabolic inhibitors that are expensive and must be obtained by prescription. What other approaches might one suggest for the future, new discoveries that also come from screening programs but do not involve specific metabolic inhibition? There are a number, as suggested in Table 3 and there is evidence even today of certain possibilities. Interrupt transport to susceptible host cell Block attachment to cell Inhibit entrance into cell Prevent uncoating of viral genome Inhibit transport of viral genetic information Inhibit synthesis of viral specific enzymes and structural proteins Inhibit or alter viral nucleic acid Inhibit cellular metabolic systems essential to viral multiplication but not essential to maintaining cellular integrity Prevent assembly and maturation of viral particles Prevent incorporation of necessary cellular substances into viral particle (lipids) Inhibit release from cell Prevent viral induced cell pathology Neutralize or block induced biochemical pathology (toxemia) Enhance host defense mechanisms Enhance host recovery mechanisms Naturally occurring substances that neutralize viruses have long been studied but neglected for practical use. It has long been known that a variety of macromolecules, some with polysaccaride moieties, tannins, glycoproteins and lipoproteins, neutralize viruses as do some small molecular weight compounds and this neutralization is not usually as specific as antiviral antibody. In serious viral diseases, these neutralizing agents might be given intraveneously but this use seems limited. Could such agents be given orally to produce some levels of protection in the membrane secretions? More likely would their daily use as a protective respiratory spray confer some protection to certain viral infections. It should be recalled that many persons are infected with viruses but not all become ill, so it is possible that with just a little help the body might be able to abort viral disease. Perhaps it only requires a slight lowering of the amount of infecting virus and a protective neutralizing spray might do this. So far as is known, none of the many known neutralizing substances for influenza virus type A have been tested for this effect, despite the fact that some are even found in human serum. This approach is chemoprophylactic and it would seem that viral laboratory diagnosis is not needed. But is this really true? It may come to pass that the use of welltolerated viral neutralizing substances, artificial antibody so to speak, are still specific enough that there has to be a general awareness of what viruses are within the community before their use would be effective. Again the virus alert program could perform this function. One substance might be used for parainfluenza virus infections, for example, another for an influenza outbreak and perhaps still another for an echovirus outbreak. The idea would be to protect the upper respiratory tract from primary viral infection or at least decrease the magnitude of the infection.",

This does not involve specific antiviral substances, which in fact interferons are not, but rather a treatment that encourages the body's recovery mechanisms, and such mechanisms could differ for different virus infections.

The inducing of higher levels of antibody or interferons most readily comes to mind, but it seems likely that other recovery mechanisms must exist to explain intrinsic immunity exhibited by those immune virgins who become infected but do not become ill. Whatever these mechanisms are, they are the ones that might also have to be enhanced.

Amantadine has a chemotherapeutic effect early in the course of viral disease but, like rimantadine, it is more potent when given prophylactically. Use of drugs with such antiviral specificity would certainly seem to demand some viral laboratory diagnosis, as is now the case with the use of amantadine or rimantadine.

Most of this disease is viral induced, relatively mild, self-limiting and frequently not seen by a physician. Physicians in the United States see perhaps 50 million cases of viral respiratory disease each year and the majority of these patients are children. In the practice of pediatric medicine as many as 33 per cent of the patients have respiratory disease and most of this is seemingly caused by a virus (Glezen, 1976) . Indeed, it is thought that overall there is likely 4-5 times more viral than bacterial respiratory tract disease (Glezen, 1976) and it is likely that ill-advised antibacterial treatment is routinely used for many such viral diseases. For the purposes of the following discussion, however, upper respiratory tract disease will obviously not include those infections of the bronchial tree and the lungs, which will be presented later.",

            "text": "In discussing the known viruses that cause upper respiratory tract disease, it is common to mention those of the common cold and influenza as well as infections caused by parainfluenza, respiratory syncytial and adenoviruses. There must, however, be additional consideration given to the role of the enteroviruses and herpes simplex virus in such disease. Enteroviruses are commonly associated with childhood cases of pharyngitis and fever but this aspect of enteroviral disease is too frequently ignored while the seemingly more serious infections, such as those associated with meningitis, are emphasized. Certainly enteroviruses, especially those of the coxsackie group, as well as herpes simplex virus, cause disease marked by oral lesions, a common problem in children. What is not so widely known is the role of herpes simplex virus in producing both pharyngitis and stomatitis in the adult (Herrmann, 1967; Sheridan and Herrmann, 1971) . It was long assumed that most adults were immune to herpes simplex virus primary infections, and this was largely true for adults from a lower socioeconomic group. It is not so true of those from higher socioeconomic groups where at times as many as 50 per cent of young adults are not immune to this virus (Wentworth and Alexander, 1971 ). More emphasis then should be placed on the role of HSV as a common cause of oral lesions and especially its role in acute ulcerative pharyngitis in those of all ages. It is perhaps unwise always to conclude that HSV isolation from a pharyngitis is due to haphazard shedding of this virus unassociated with disease. Ifa drug attack on respiratory disease is to be effective then the role of enteroviruses and herpes simplex virus cannot be ignored. Viral upper respiratory tract disease is a very demanding problem in that hundreds of serologically distinct viruses are involved. Many of these viruses contain RNA, others contain DNA and most produce rather superficial diseases, resulting in solid immunity to reinfection (enteroviruses) in some cases, or partial immunity (parainfluenza and influenzaviruses) in others. In certain cases, as with rhinoviruses, the illness is marked by no objective pathology while other viruses, such as those causing influenza, can denude the epithelium of the respiratory tract. Some infections are 'cold-like' while others are 'flu-like' and certain viruses can take their turn producing both kinds of illness. Of all viral diseases, those involving the upper respiratory tract are the most difficult to diagnose on clinical grounds and yet it will be these very diseases that will most likely be treated with little or no laboratory diagnosis.",

Some question should even be raised about the wisdom of suppressing a relatively mild fever with aspirin since certain viruses do not tolerate temperatures much about 37\u00b0C, or at least seem to tolerate them less well than humans. Indeed, except when there are dangers from too high a fever, this is not an aspect of viral disease that causes great discomfort. What is really needed is a drug to produce effective relief from the cough, obstruction of the respiratory passages, sore throat, rhinorrhea, malaise, myalgias and the general toxemia that is associated with rhinoviral and other 'cold-like' viral respiratory disease. Symptomatic relief alone would not be sufficient, however, if the infection were caused by entero, herpes simplex or influenza viruses, for example, since these and other viruses can cause more serious disease likely requiring a more potent and specific viral inhibitor. With the young infant, symptomatic relief alone for respiratory syncytial or parainfluenza virus infections would also not be totally adequate.",

The problem is that these cases can be sporadic and, despite the fact adenoviruses contain DNA, they seem rather resistant to the prevalent drugs that inhibit other DNA viruses.

Clearly what is now needed are more rapid acting chemotherapeutic drugs that influence all influenza, whether caused by the A or B virus types. Symptomatic relief should also be considered, since this virus is likely to cause a portion of the illness via a toxic mechanism. Further, the course of influenza can be of such short duration that a specific viral inhibitor may have little time to be effective prior to the patient's recovery. Even when the active disease is virtually over, however, some sequelae including general weakness, lethargy and even certain mild depression remain, sometimes for weeks, and certainly symptomatic relief seems in order in such cases. Chemoprophylactic drugs may well be life saving to high risk patients in the absence of an effective chemotherapeutic drug for influenza, but such drugs should permit development of maximal immunity even in those who experience inapparent or mild disease. Even then, when the specific influenza virus inhibitor is being sought, it best be one that is very effective chemotherapeutically in that it seems more practical to treat only those who are ill. Further, many with influenza virus infections will either not be ill or mildly so and they could be left untreated and hence acquire maximal immunity, which might not be the result if a chemoprophylactic drug were widely used. So far as is now known, antiviral chemotherapeutic drugs do not seem to prevent an immune response, likely because viral multiplication has progressed sufficiently by the time therapy is started to provide the same immunity as would normally be produced by the untreated disease.",

Some may feel that viral diseases of the respiratory tract can be distinguished from bacterial since the latter so often are localized and lack the generalized toxic phase common in viral disease. It would seem wiser, however, to rule out bacterial involvement by performing a simple throat culture. This would not, of course, define which virus is the responsible agent in the event different drugs must be used for different viruses. Perhaps what is needed is more effort in an attempt to discover those clinical signs and symptoms that are classical for certain viral infections. Certainly an outbreak of influenza is not difficult to define ; it is determining whether the responsible agent is the A or B virus that poses the somewhat more difficult question. Similarly, outbreaks of parainfluenza viral infection in children, with the associated croup, is not too difficult to define when pediatricians compare experiences. When a number of infants have bronchitis or bronchiolitis, then respiratory syncytial virus must be suspected and a drug used to attack this virus, if such existed. The classical clinical picture of the common cold in adults, usually without fever, would certainly suggest the use of effective and well tolerated drugs for the rhinoviruses, if it were not for the fact these are certainly not the only viruses that can cause a classical cold. The seasonal pattern of disease could be helpful, however, in that rhinoviruses seem most prevalent in the spring, summer and fall. Coronaviruses apparently cause many of the wintertime colds. In temperate climates, as another example of seasonal prevalence, one is very unlikely to see pharyngitis cases caused by enteroviruses during the winter months. Future diagnosis of viral respiratory disease, therefore, in such a manner as to permit adequate use of specific drugs will likely require interrelating knowledge involving isolating the virus when possible, defining it serologically when this can be done along with the clinical, epidemiological and seasonal pattern of disease. Much more would be required in community-physician cooperation and communication than now seems the case, however, if antiviral drugs are to be used in a rational and effective manner.",

It has been found on rarer occasions, however, that intraoral lesions can also be associated with coxsackieviruses of the B type and so laboratory diagnosis may well be necessary to unravel which viruses are involved. In the winter months, with an infected child presenting with severe oral lesions and a gingivostomatitis, one would certainly think of using a well tolerated antiherpes drug. But still some confusion can occur with cases of aphthus stomatitis which so far as known is not caused by a virus. It is claimed, however, that herpetic intraoral lesions can be distinguished from those associated with aphthus stomatitis (Weathers and Griffin, 1970) , so here again is an example of the use of the clinical picture as a guide to therapy. Of course, oral lesions associated with herpes simplex virus can usually be readily defined by virus isolation in any average virus diagnostic laboratory, generally within a very few days. But again there is the concern that this will not be swift enough to start effective therapy. Perhaps more must be done to utilize labeled specific, antibody systems for detecting HSV in oral mucosal cells, if rapid therapy based on an accurate diagnosis is to be the goal.",

In some cases the heterophile antibody test will constantly remain negative and this can suggest the involvement of cytomegalovirus, which is also a herpesvirus. One suspects that an effective antiherpes drug that is well tolerated could be useful against either of these DNA virus infections. The heterophile antibody test will persist as a worthwhile diagnostic tool so long as EB virus cannot be readily and routinely identified in the diagnostic laboratory. CMV, on the other hand, can be isolated in human fibroblast cells but it is not always an easy task nor is it swiftly performed. With a typical clinical and blood picture of IM there seems some hope that chemotherapy of this disease could be practically undertaken no matter which of these two herpesviruses are involved.

Most pneumonia is still probably bacterial in origin, perhaps even bacteria not previously implicated, as exemplified by the recent discovery of the role of the bacterium responsible for 'Legionnaires' Disease' (Center for Disease Control, 1978). Our examination of over 800 lungs obtained from adults at autopsy produced only 35 viral isolates, mostly influenza A viruses, some cytomegaloviruses from immune compromised patients, and a few, very few, other viruses (Herrmann and Herrmann, 1976b) . This suggests that severe infections of the lungs do not seem to be primarily a problem related to the known viruses. Influenza virus has been identified infrequently with severe bronchitis, and in fact bronchitis in adults, sufficiently severe to seek medical aid, has not been defined as a viral problem. Among recruits in the armed services adenoviruses can cause lower respiratory tract disease but this is a special case, rarely seen in civilian adults.

Treating only symptoms is perhaps also not the proper approach to cases of myocarditis and pericarditis; virus multiplication should be inhibited as early in the course of the disease as possible for it is still not known whether coxsackie B viruses can produce some sequelae, perhaps sequelae not obvious until years later. Drug treatment for infections caused by the numerous types of enteroviruses seems the only practical attack against the variety of disease problems they produce. Effective antiviral drugs also seem required for respiratory syncytial virus infections and perhaps this virus is a close enough relative to the parainfluenza viruses so they too will respond to the same therapeutic approach. Although certain drugs may be useful to treat only the symptoms of the common cold when produced by rhinoviruses and coronaviruses, this too may not be enough when these viruses produce more serious lower respiratory tract illnesses in children. Since rhinoviruses are related to the enteroviruses it could well be that drugs inhibitory for one group will work against all picornavirus and there are a number of antiviral compounds that suggest this possibility, including hydroxybenzimadazole (Gwaltney, 1968) , the bisbenzimidazoles (Schleicher et al., 1972) , the triazinoindoles (Gwaltney, 1970) and AR-336 (DeLong et al., 1978) .",

What is needed, of course, are more potent antiviral drugs that act on infections caused by both influenza A and B viruses and this has been claimed for ribavirin (Durr et al., 1975) . Ribavirin, however, does not appear to be a very potent treatment for human infections and its effect is almost undetectable if the influenza case is a mild one (Togo and McCracken, 1976; Cohen et al., 1976) . Certainly, a broad spectrum antiinfluenzal agent, perhaps something like ribavirin, is needed, in that an outbreak of influenza is not difficult to detect on clinical grounds but it is more difficult to determine if one is dealing with influenza A or B virus, or on some occasions, both.",

Further, lower respiratory tract infections caused by respiratory syncytial and parainfluenza viruses frequently are diagnosed using only a throat swab Herrmann and Hable, 1970) , but there is some evidence that throat and especially nasal washings can be more effective specimens for isolating certain viruses (Hall and Douglas, 1975) and these should be obtained, especially in the hospitalized cases. It seems valid to presume that in a lower respiratory tract infection caused by respiratory syncytial virus, where the virus is readily isolated from the nasal passages, extreme measures to sample the lower respiratory tract are not needed. It is also worth noting that even with upper respiratory viral disease a nasal swab can be at times more productive of a virus than is the throat swab (Bloom et al., 1963) .",

In the case of influenza, it has long been suggested that fluorescent antibody methods can be used to detect this virus in respiratory secretions and this indeed can be a rapid and specific method, but cell culture methods still are required additionally in the event that it was not a true case of influenza, which may be the reason so little influenza is diagnosed by fluorescent antibody methods. In time still more viruses associated with lower respiratory tract disease will be discovered and, as the number of virus serotypes increases, then the use of specific antibody, such as in fluorescent methods, becomes increasingly less practical ; hence, better cell culture methods are required if rapid application of a chemotherapeutic agent is to be the goal. Measurement of virus antibody in acute and convalescent sera could rarely aid in guiding therapy for the individual patient. Perhaps even detection of the virus would not be enough, for it might still have to be established that the isolated virus was sensitive to one or another drug before adequate therapy could be undertaken. It would be ideal if such viral drug sensitivity were first established, but the ideal is not always achieved and it is likely that antiviral drugs, even those with narrow antiviral spectra, will be used based solely on clinical observations, and if the disease is stressful enough this could at times be helpful to the patient. Yet a specimen should be taken prior to any therapy to confirm the clinical diagnosis so adjustment in therapy can be made when necessary. It should be reemphasized that so far as is known today, the greatest percentage of viral lower respiratory tract illness is selflimiting and not lethal, with influenza in high risk patients the outstanding exception. So even with lower respiratory tract diseases some relief of symptoms and clinical signs by a palliative drug is also a worthwhile goal.",

At the outset of any viral induced nervous system disease it is, of course, not clear whether one is dealing with a mild self-limiting type of CNS infection or one that will be fatal. There are many serologically distinct viruses that produce CNS disease and these include mumps, HSV, CMV, coxsackie, echo, toga, measles and varicella-zoster viruses. One must also add to this list the relatively rare human cases of rabies and a growing list of so-called 'slow virus' diseases such as subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) (Gajdusek, 1977) . The virus induced CNS diseases can be mild with almost indetectable meningitis or can be severe meningoencephalitis, encephalitis and more rarely slow fatal degenerative disease or even peripheral nervous disorders and paralysis. There is little question that the viral induced nervous system diseases are a major problem which has only been partially resolved by vaccines for the prevention of poliomyelitis and measles.

Few communities will go through an entire year without at least some meningitis caused by one or another of these viruses; in some cases there will be a meningoencephalitis and even a few cases of encephalitis, but very rarely will it be fatal or even leave any permanent brain damage. The purpose of chemotherapy would be to shorten the course of the disease and prevent any possible potential complications. The drugs required would have to be well tolerated and rapidly halt viral synthesis. A search for drugs for mumps and enterovirus infections has not as yet been successful. There is no reason why specific inhibitors cannot be found that are compatible with drug therapy in that inhibitors for these viruses have long been known but so far seem to lack all those other pharmacological properties so necessary to an effective drug.

It is somewhat of a surprise that there is not much more HSV encephalitis in that this virus is likely to be one of the most widespread of all known viruses, due at least partly to the very common occurrence of the cold sore. It is the type 1 HSV that is most often isolated in both cases of the cold sore and encephalitis. The first steps have now been taken to attack HSV encephalitis with the use of araA. This is not the complete answer since more potent drugs are needed to head off the extensive sequelae that frequently occur in treated survivors (Whitley et al., 1977) , but the proof is now in, potentially fatal HSV encephalitis can be altered by therapy and araA will likely be used until a more potent, less toxic or metabolically stable drug is available. It should be noted that the study of araA's use in HSV induced encephalitis has been sharply criticized (Tager, 1977; Morris, 1977) . Nonetheless, as with most viral CNS disease, the only drug to consider first is one that specifically, and rapidly, halts HSV synthesis prior to significant brain damage. In addition, extensive supportive patient care also seems important, for this was the only approach used in the apparent recovery of two persons from rabiesvirus infection (Hattwick et al., 1972; Porras et al., 1976) . The study of the treatment of HSV encephalitis leaves little doubt that there is no fundamental reason why other viral CNS infections cannot be attacked in the same chemotherapeutic manner once there is a more aggressive search for specific viral inhibitors for all viruses causing such disease. So far, for example, there seems to have been little work done in looking for a drug to combat the rabiesvirus. Such a drug might not only be used for treatment of frank rabies cases but also could be used as a prophylactic measure, to replace the present vaccine and hyperimmune serum procedures. One would hope that harmless rabies vaccine strains could be included in the tests for antiviral activity. It is estimated that in Latin America alone some 300,000 persons receive antirabies treatment (Porras et al., 1976) . Certainly a relatively well-tolerated antirabies drug seems preferred over the tedious multiple dose vaccine procedures used on those presumed to have been exposed to rabies.",

First, a distinction should be made between CNS diseases associated with conventional viruses and those associated with so-called unconventional viruses since so little is known about this latter type of biological entity (Gajdusek, 1977) . Nonetheless, if conventional or unconventional virus production involves metabolic pathways that do not exist in normal healthy cells, then theoretically their synthesis can be halted. What is not known is whether the synthesis of either unconventional or conventional viruses is the basic cause of these serious and degenerating diseases. Whatever the process, it is clear that some drug is needed to halt whatever is going on at the very first moment when the disease is recognized. The slow pace of these diseases is such that there is some hope a drug could be applied with substantial success. SSPE is a fatal disease, and the course can extend over many months. Ifa drug were available to treat human measles cases then certainly it should be tried for the treatment of SSPE. Amantadine has been tried on such cases and the authors felt it was beneficial (Haslam et al., 1969) even though this drug is not known to affect the measles virus. A search specifically seeking drugs to treat what, for the moment, is a rare disease seems unlikely. An antiviral drug might be found, however, that is poorly tolerated for treating the rather benign common cold, for example, but yet the toxicity would be acceptable in a degenerative, slow virus disease, such as SSPE.",

Once mumps is detected in the community then mumpsvirus associated central nervous system disease should be expected. In temperate climates, during other than the summer and early fall months, the first guess at the causal agent of CNS disease should be mumpsvirus, once a bacterial infection is excluded. In that mumps central nervous system disease frequently occurs well after infection, the virus is not easily isolated from the upper respiratory tract but it can at times be detected in the urine (Utz et al., 1958; Person et al., 1971) . Detection of a rise in specific complement fixing antibody frequently occurs too late to be other than a retrospective diagnosis . The use of virus isolation methods, clinical observations and serology could go very far in at least determining if mumpsvirus infection is widespread in the community. The question arises if any of this would permit prompt use of a specific therapeutic antiviral drug with individual cases?

At present isolation of the virus from a brain biopsy is thought the most accurate diagnostic method. Tissue rich in virus permits detection in 2 or 3 days in cell culture with the study of stained tissue sections also of some use if classical intranuclear inclusions are detected (which are not strictly specific for HSV but this would still be the most common virus involved).

This virus type is less prevalent when compared to the type 1 virus that is so frequently found associated with cold sores. The diagnosis of meningitis related to any type of herpes simplex virus, however, presents some problems. A brain biopsy would not seem justified. The virus should be found in the spinal fluid but this seems a rather rare occurrence . Again the detection of rapidly rising antibody might be a useful diagnostic method but the relative rarity of this type of meningitis could inhibit establishment of such a test on a routine basis. The use of fluorescent antibody methods to detect HSV antigen in infected cells in the spinal fluid and blood could be a rapid diagnostic test but it has not been shown to be as sensitive as isolation of the virus in cell cultures (Cho and Feng, 1978) . Of course, the patient's medical history could be helpful if it suggests a possible recent infection with the venereal or type 2 HSV.

A patient's history of exposure to mosquitos most certainly would be suggestive while on the other hand a CNS infection occurring during the cold months with no mosquito activity would likely rule out this type of viral disease (providing of course the patient had not recently been to a more tropical climate). The serological test often requires both acute and convalescent sera to detect a rise in hemagglutination inhibition antibodies. There should be some encouragement still to test the acute serum even if no convalescent serum was forthcoming, for a high antibody titer can often be suggestive of which type of mosquito-borne virus is involved. Mosquito-borne viruses can be isolated by intracerebral injection of specimens into the brains of mice. Unfortunately, the human blood stream harbors the virus very briefly leaving brain tissue the only useful specimen and this is largely an impractical specimen, especially since much of the disease produced is mild and self-limiting. Death is, however, not an uncommon result of mosquito-borne viral disease and proper treatment with antiviral drugs would have significant benefit if such drugs existed.

Although considerably more data are required, the figure for those having one cold sore episode in a 6-9 month period is about 8 per cent of a study population (Young et al., 1976) . But even if this lower figure is true of all human groups, in all locales, then it truly is an enormous amount of viral infection. To this must be added the problem of type 2 virus, the venereal strain, that has been suggested as having an association with cervical carcinoma (Melnick et al., 1974) , and which commonly infects skin and mucosa of humans. Indeed, some claim HSV venereal disease is most common (Nahmias et al., 1969) and perhaps frequently overlooked because it is self-limiting and rarely causes any sequelae. On the other hand it can be recurrent on the genitalia just like cold sores.",

The major problem is infection of the fetus and this likely occurs because of a viremia in the mother. Cytomegalovirus is presumed to infect all humans, if antibody surveys are an accurate gauge of infection, but it seems that most cases go unstudied or are mild with the possible exception of certain instances of heterophile antibody negative infectious mononucleosis and it could be such a case in the mother leads to an infected fetus. Despite what seems the more common prevalence of HSV, the more serious and frequent cases of newborn disease involve CMV infection. Like HSV and varicella-zoster, CMV takes a more serious course in the immunodeficient and immunosuppressed patient and the fetus and newborn might in a sense be considered in this category. It is estimated that CMV infections can be detected in 1-2 per cent of all newborns but there is concern that some cases of mental retardation may also be produced by this virus and even perhaps by HSV, cases that went unrecognized in the newborn (Nahmias et al., 1976) .",

Mumpsvirus can also be isolated in cell cultures, especially from urine and most especially from urine that has been ultracentrifuged. Unfortunately many such virus isolations take 5 or more days to detect and in an atypical case of orchitis this may be too long a wait prior to starting therapy. Treatment could be started prior to the final laboratory reports and then altered depending on what the reports indicated. Likely a rapid mumpsvirus test might be established using sedimented urine cells and specific fluorescent antibody, and although perhaps a useful approach, there may not be a significant demand for such a test, at least not significant enough to establish it on a routine basis. Again, a virus alert program would help to indicate the prevalence of mumps in the community and even with those atypical cases that involve the urogenital system such information could be invaluable in making a differential diagnosis. This same epidemiological approach could be used for enterovirus infections. Coxsackieviruses of the B type cause the more serious problem in the newborn and a monitoring system would readily establish the presence of these viruses in the community. The mother might well be tested for excretion of these viruses prior to delivery even though it is not completely clear that all enterovirus infection of the newborn come from this source. Coxsackie B viruses are readily isolated in cell cultures and many times produce a recognizable cytopathic effect in 2 or 3 days. The question arises whether infections of the newborn by such viruses always permit easy access to the virus, especially in cases of myocarditis. It is not clear that all such cases shed virus in the throat or feces. Further, the cases are rare enough that some physicians may not have adequate experience to recognize the problem based on the clinical picture alone. If it is known that such viruses are in the community then treatment with a specific, systemically applied drug that is therapeutic for enterovirus infections could be used to treat a very ill newborn. It would be hard to imagine that much improvement is required in the isolation ofcoxsackie B viruses, that are routinely recognized and reported to the physician almost as rapidly as are bacterial isolations . The echoviruses take somewhat longer to isolate and recognize but they seem to be less of a problem in the newborn, indeed serious illness may be rather rare . Even though most enteroviruses are rather readily detected and recognized the problem has been to define the specific serotype of the over 70 that exist. The hope is that this will not be necessary in that anti-enteroviral drugs will be effective against all the various serotypes and identification could be a simple biochemical test even using the drug as the best indicator of the nature of the virus rather than tedious and lengthy serum neutralization tests.",

THE PROBLEM In recent years great strides have been made in understanding the nature of hepatitis viruses and there is widespread use of methods that can detect the coat of hepatitis B virus (HBV or serum hepatitis virus) in ill patients as well as in blood donors. These methods still lack some sensitivty but are very useful. Certainly some hepatitis virus carriers still are not detected. Further, such carriers present a public health problem since there is no cure for their infection. Efforts are being made to develop a vaccine by isolation of vast amounts of the virus antigen from infected bloods. The problem would seem to be how can a person that has carried this virus in their blood stream, likely for years, be made immune by injections of still more pieces of the same virus?",

Work with both these viruses has led to the conclusion that they are not the only viruses that cause hepatitis in humans. Indeed, perhaps 90 per cent of post-transfusion hepatitis is neither A or B virus. There is no clear idea of how many hepatitis viruses there may,be. So despite great strides the picture is complex. Something was achieved, however, when it was discovered that purchased human blood was much more likely to contain hepatitis B virus than was blood from volunteers and correcting this has lowered the rate of post transfusion hepatitis (Holland and Alter, 1976) .",

Some had thought that the enteroviruses, such as echo and coxsackieviruses, were a common cause of gastrointestinal upsets. It is clear now that they play a minor role in these ailments. The rotaviruses are the primary cause of severe infantile diarrhea. To this can be added a number of other viruses associated with both adult and childhood bouts of vomiting and diarrhea. These include the Newport type agents, astroviruses, 'mini-reoviruses' and likely others (Middleton et al., 1977) . None of these viruses, usually causing a rather explosive short term gastrointestinal upset, can as yet be cultivated in the laboratory. How many more there may be, how many types of viruses they represent, is unknown. The solution to the problem, unlike that of hepatitis, does not seem to require something as vigorous as a vaccine in that these diseases, although of substantial importance, are only life-threatening to infants who have not received proper medical care (Carlson et al., 1978) . Such infections might be viewed as the common cold equivalent of the G.I. tract and represent what so many for so long have incorrectly called 'intestinal flu'. So far the data suggest the morbidity from these viruses is most substantial, far in excess of what is seen with bacterial disease of the G.I. tract (Birch et al., 1977) .",

A vigorous application of a drug to halt virus synthesis or limit the degree of liver damage is warranted. Such a drug could also be used to protect those at risk when in contact with hepatitis cases or even to treat carriers of the virus. Further, until that time when every unit of blood for transfusion can be guaranteed free of any hepatitis virus, the same drugs might be used to protect patients receiving transfusions. Viral inhibition seems mandatory if a treatment is to be effective in halting liver damage. Unfortunately it is not known how many hepatitis viruses we are dealing with and in fact how they may be biochemically related to each other. The A and B viruses are unrelated and each might well demand its own form of treatment. Experiments are underway in an effort to find if interferon might be useful. Here is a case where the antiviral agent is not virus specific, as certain drugs might be, and a broad spectrum agent or drug would seem desirable. Virazole is a drug with a somewhat broad antiviral effect, part of which may not be specifically antiviral, but nonetheless it too has been considered for treatment of hepatitis. Of course, until the time all hepatitis viruses can be cultivated in some convenient laboratory system, we are not likely to be able to search for new drugs specifically active against these viruses. In assuming a specific viral inhibitor is required it must be pointed out that a recent study shows a drug that is not known to inhibit viruses (Blum et al., 1977) may have some worthwhile effect on cases of hepatitis through some unknown mechanism.",

It seems true that certain of these viruses do produce some lesions in the G.I. tract but whether this is the direct cause of the disease problem or whether the disease is due to a toxemia is not as yet known. Nonetheless, some consideration should be given to drugs that relieve the symptoms and signs of the disease but are not specifically antiviral. Drugs that act on the toxemia or alter cellular destruction or in some manner relieve the patient's discomfort might be just what is required without making any attempt at altering the virus multiplication. The search for such drugs can be two-fold, first some attempt can be made to study various available and approved drugs for some worthwhile pharmacological effect. As mentioned before, is it possible anti-inflammatory, antihistamine or even tranquilizer drugs have any worthwhile effect? Do in fact, any of the over-the-counter drugs have any effect on human viral diseases? Animal studies could be first undertaken since virus induced diarrhea has been established in infant mice and baby pigs and this does not involve the substantial challenge of common cold virus studies where only humans exhibit a rather subjective illness. Controlling the diarrhea would be a useful definitive criterion for the study of drugs that are not specifically antiviral.",

None of the remaining hepatitis viruses (other than those few known viruses that only occasionally cause hepatitis) nor any of the viruses causing GI upsets can presently be diagnosed in virus laboratories without easy access to an electron microscope. One might conclude that a person had viral hepatitis on clinical grounds alone but it seems necessary to define the particular virus exactly before effective therapy could be undertaken. The same seems true of the viruses so far associated with G.I. upsets except in this case bacteria could just as well be the cause. It is obvious that much more needs to be done in isolating and defining all these viruses in a routine way before effective drugs could wisely be used. Since none of the viruses discussed in this section can as yet be cultured in cell cultures there is some question how soon drugs would be discovered specifically for such viruses. It would seem rather more likely that antiviral drugs found for other viral infections would be tested for their effect on viral hepatitis even prior to the time the viruses could be conveniently handled in the laboratory and in fact this is what is being done with interferon and with virazole. Since HBV infections can now frequently be definitively diagnosed, at least in these cases drugs could be tested and hopefully routinely used in what can sometimes be a lethal infection.",

Some drugs may well enhance the body's own protective systems by immunmodulation or by an interferon effect. There are, in fact, many approaches to treating viral disease, a number presently neglected, but this is not likely to continue much longer as the economic potential ofantiviral drugs becomes fully recognized.

Even if a universal antiviral drug came into being, the need for distinguishing viral from bacterial disease would remain. The rational use of antiviral drugs based on laboratory data is not likely to come to pass, however, until it is accepted that laboratory viral diagnosis can be relatively swift, inexpensive and part of everyday, routine, medical practice. Laboratory viral diagnosis will likely follow the path of bacterial diagnosis with emphasis on isolation and identification of the pathogen plus some indication of its drug sensitivity. In that viral diagnostic procedures may not always be useful for drug treatment of a single patient, a 'virus alert' program should be part of medical practice. The wide transmission of information on what viruses are in the community at any one time would be an aid in the proper use ofantiviral drugs. But it can still be presumed that much use of antiviral drugs will still be based solely on clinical impressions which in some cases will be correct and in other cases will be in error. Hopefully, the degree of ill-advised use of antiviral drugs will not reach the level of what occurs with antibacterial drugs since this could cause more problems to the patient than the generally mild viral diseases. Sharp outbreaks of viral disease should be swiftly defined in an attempt to head off the wide use of an inappropriate antiviral drug.",
