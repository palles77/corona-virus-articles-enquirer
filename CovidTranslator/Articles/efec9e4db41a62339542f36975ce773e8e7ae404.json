It was reported to have various biological activities such as antiviral, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory and widely used in treating exopathogenic wind-heat, epidemic febrile diseases and some infectious diseases such as SARS coronavirus and swine H1N1 flu virus (Shang et al. 2011; Wang and Weller 2006) . Chlorogenic acid (CGA) is the major bioactive components of FLJ, and had been reported to have various biological and pharmacological activities such as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-carcinogenic activities (Wu et al. 2012; Shin et al. 2015) . A series of methods had been reported for the extraction bioactive CGA from plant materials. In conventional methods, CGA extraction was mainly achieved by water extraction (WE) (Zheng et al. 2006; Wu et al. 2006) or refluent ethanol extraction (REE) (Lan and Zhang 2005) . Some disadvantage of these methods were fraction of oxidation, hydrolysis, and ionization due to excessive extraction time and relatively higher temperature (Duarte et al. 2010) . Nowadays, microwave-assisted extraction (MAE) ) and ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE) (Hu et al. 2009 ) had been developed as the feasible extraction methods. Although these two extraction methods greatly lessen the extraction time, it still can't meet the satisfaction of green chemistry for the consumption of organic solvents .",

The operation conditions were as follows: extraction temperature 40 \u00b0C, liquid-solid ratio 20 ml/g, enzyme concentration 0.5 mg/ml, pH 5.0, and extraction time 2 h in the 0.25 M [C4mim]Br aqueous solvent. From Fig. 1 , the extraction yields were much higher than that without enzyme treatment, and the extraction yield of treatment with pectinase was higher than those with other enzyme types. As a green solvent, ionic liquids had many potential applications and were applied in chemical industry on extraction of a variety of natural products (Jing et al. 2008; Yang et al. 2016) , the component of the ionic liquids had a great effect on its physicochemical properties and may have a strong impact on the target analyte of the extracted yield. In order to sieve the better combination of anions and cations, both of them were investigated, respectively. We investigated several common anions on the basis of literature and finally screened out five anions including Br \u2212 , Cl \u2212 , NO 3 \u2212 , BF 4 \u2212 , and PF 6 \u2212 Ma et al. 2011; Merlet et al. 2017) . As can be seen from Fig. 2(a) , four kinds of hydrophilic anions showed better extraction effect, while the extraction yield of hydrophobic PF6 \u2212 was relatively poor. In the four hydrophilic anions, the halogen ions exhibit the best extraction yield especially Br \u2212 , which may be due to the combination of the halogen ions with the H + in the cellulose to disintegrate the internal structure of cellulose. This result showed that the extraction rate of CGA depends on the type of anion which has been reported (Liu et al. 2016 ). it may be because CGA can be better dissolved in the lipophilic IL; the extraction yield of CGA decreased from hexyl to decylate may be due to the hydrogen bond and hydrophobic interaction of ionic liquids affecting the dissolution of CGA.",

Under the conditions of 0.5 mg/ml pectinase and 0.25 M [C4mim]Br treatment, pH 3.0, and temperature 40 \u00b0C, the influence of extraction time on yields was studied. The results in Fig. 3a illustrated that when the extraction time increased from 20 to 40 min, the extraction yields increased obviously. And yet the time was changed from 40 min to 4 h, the results remain essentially unchanged. This may be due to the isomerization of the ester groups in the GCA structure and also explained that the long extraction time would make GCA hydrolyzed, which would lead to the decreased GCA extraction yield. It was reported that pectinase can catalyze hydrolysis of ester linkage and using Eucommia ulmoides as the raw material and IL-pectinase as the extraction medium, the extraction rate of CGA was close to 0 under 4 h in 0.25 M [C4mim]Br aqueous solution.",

From the sample (a), we found untreated samples showed a clear structure: thicker cell wall and intact cell structure. After pectinase treatment (b), the cell surface had undergone minor changes and some of the tissue damage occurred with protrusions in the middle of the leaves. From the sample (c), we found that after ionic liquid treatment, cell wall surface was significantly thinned, and the cell structure changed, which led to the target product exposed to the extraction solution. In the Fig. 4(d) , after the mixed treatment of IL-enzyme, the cell wall surface tissue wrinkle serious and the cell wall thinner than a, b, c with the protrusions of the leaves disappeared. There is always a cell uplift in the leaves of the plant material, and the degree of protrusions in the treated sample can represent the dissolution and extraction capabilities of the liquid solution.
