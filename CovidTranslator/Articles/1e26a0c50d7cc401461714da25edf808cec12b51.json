As environmental exposures do not respect state borders, a globalist concept of global health response has developed, which requires transparency and cooperation for coordinated responses to disease outbreaks. Countries that avoid cooperation on health issues for social or political reasons can endanger the global community.",

This caused the loss of many lives and facilitated the spread of SARS to 29 states on 5 continents. 3 In 2013, 10 years after SARS, China responded to the emergence of the new avian influenza strain H7N9 in a manner conforming to international best-practice guidelines, earning praise from the international health community. 4, 5 Observers have provided many possible explanations for this rapid change, including the shock of the SARS crisis, a new national discourse about nontraditional security threats, 6, 7 the high cost of SARS to the Chinese economy, 8 reforms to the domestic Chinese health system, 6 and China's increasing relationship with international organizations. 9 However, more in-depth analysis can add to the picture of the influence of international forces on China's response to infectious diseases.",

However, securitization and socialization theory are limited in the insight they can provide about domestic motivations for Chinese policy change. By combining public health and international relations approaches, we can develop a more complete picture of the forces that encourage states to support international health governance and evidence-based infectious disease policy, providing insights to better direct the work of public health actors and both broadening and setting boundaries for the usefulness of international relations theory. International relations theories can add nuance and show why some attempts to engage states like China in international health governance will be effective, whereas others will be ineffective.",

Although this study has been constrained by the opaqueness of Chinese government decision making and the difficulty of accessing internal Chinese government documents, there is enough evidence published in English to develop a clear analysis. One of the key assumptions of this work is that there was a dramatic change in China's infectious disease policy between 2000 and 2013. There is an academic consensus that China is now actively involved in developing effective infectious disease response systems and wider health governance, 7 although there are still local implementation issues. 6 These developments have come after several shocks to the health care system, beginning with HIV/ AIDS and SARS.",

It was not until after the official appointment of President Hu Jintao and Premier Wen Jiabao that official Chinese policy changed. Transparency and swift action were then emphasized and the national Minister of Health and the Mayor of Beijing were fired. 22 Hu and the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) were widely commended for the new approach. 23 From its origin in southern China, SARS spread to Hong Kong and the rest of the world, causing 8096 confirmed infections and 774 deaths. 24 SARS was deadly evidence of the failures of the Chinese infectious disease response system.",

In April 2003, Premier Wen Jiabao explicitly linked China's newly aggressive response to SARS to China's reputation as a responsible state. 30 Since 2004, the ruling CCP has adopted a succession of terms to portray China as a responsible rising state, including Zheng Bijan's \"peaceful rise\" (heping jueqi) theory, later replaced by the softer \"peaceful development.\" 31 These terms were developed to counter the \"China threat theory\" 9,31 and assuage fears of China becoming more aggressive as it gained economic resources and political power. The Chinese government's aim to project the image of a responsible state practicing good governance in health forms a part of a larger international strategy to develop an image of China as a peaceful great power. Despite this, China has continued to react aggressively to certain conflicts, particularly regional territorial disputes. 32 There are many actors involved in Chinese foreign policy and health decision making and the Chinese government is notoriously opaque about its decision-making processes, the various agencies and actors involved in decision making, and the internal interest groups able to influence government policy. 33 ",

Engagement with the WHO and other international health organizations has provided China with increased access to technical information on infectious disease management. The functionalist nature of health cooperation and the positive goodwill it generates makes a constructive working relationship with the WHO a pragmatic policy decision. Johnston's model of state socialization into international organizations is a respected measurement of China's participation in international organizations. 34 Johnston argued the socialization of states into international organizations can, in some cases, be viewed on a continuum, beginning with mimicking, which is when a state mimics the behavior of other actors before making concrete decisions about its commitment to the group, sometimes as a response to uncertainty. 34 During the next stage, social influence, a state ostensibly follows the prescriptions of the organization to gain approval from other actors and avoid censure but it is not clear if the rules and values of the institution have been internally accepted. 35 The final process is persuasion, where the state is internally convinced of the value of following the rules and prescriptions of an institution, requiring both private and public acceptance of the norms, values, and processes of the institution. 35 Although classical realist, neoclassical realist, and neorealist theories have used the concept of socialization, Johnston took a constructivist approach. This argument draws from the constructivist assumption that engagement with the international community can change the interests of actors, which can alter the norms of the international system itself. 35 Johnston's socialization approach has been effectively used to explain China's engagement with the World Trade Organization 36 and the International Monetary Fund. 34 As Ferdinand and Wang suggest, it goes beyond the debate between status quo and revisionist behavior, 34 but it only allows states to follow one path of socialization into international organizations.",

Johnston's socialization theory is limited in 3 ways. First, it does not take into account the complexities of Chinese engagement with international actors and multilateral approach to a growing number of international issues. Since the 1996 adoption of a \"new security concept\" (xin anquan guan), China has approached many international issues multilaterally, 9 although other conflicts like territorial disputes in south China see are still approached mostly bilaterally and sometimes aggressively. 32 China's engagement with the WHO over the past 2 decades may be a part of the CCP's broader foreign policy strategies and unrelated to health policy. Second, although the concept of global health governance is increasingly influencing public health activities, China continues to support a state-centric approach to health. 6, 9 Beijing's attempts to balance the expectations of the global health movement and a statecentric approach to health can help explain why China has not accepted all of the values of the global health community. Finally, Johnston's socialization model is limited by its narrow view of engagement with international organizations as China's engagement with many international organizations has fallen outside of Johnston's model. China has used a maxi-mini approach to gain influence in some international organizations, which involves attempting to gain the most benefits for the least concessions. A state may completely avoid interacting with an institution by creating alternative organizations as China has done with the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, an alternative to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the ASEAN or the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank as an alternative to the World Bank. Although China's relationship with the WHO does fall within Johnston's continuum, the socialization model cannot be applied to all state relationships with international health organizations and does not explain the effects of broader multilateral policies.",

Yet when SARS emerged, the first response of the Chinese government was to desecuritize SARS and minimize the perceived threat of an epidemic. 8 The first securitizing steps were taken by the Chinese military doctor Jiang Yanyong who covertly distributed information about the government cover up and true scale of the pandemic, and then by the WHO, on March 12, 2003. 16 Soon after, the Chinese government began to publicly respond to the crisis, making securitization moves with official and semiofficial speech acts. 8 Beijing then used the Chinese media to gain public support for the SARS response, including posters and publications with the slogans \"Declare War on SARS\" and \"Activate the whole Party, mobilize the entire populace, win the war of annihilation against SARS.\" 8 As suggested previously, the version of securitization theory described by Buzan, Waever, and de Wilde, does not focus enough on methods of nonverbal and nonlinguistic communication with the audience. 1 Because of the political system in China, the CCP's control over the media and policies deterring criticism of the government, the people were primed to accept the government's verbal and nonverbal securitizing moves. Despite some protests, the majority of the Chinese population supported the government efforts and rhetoric. 8 Despite this, it has been argued that there was a move toward desecuritization after the pandemic with the arrest of Jiang Yannyong and a greater focus on preventative risk management. 8 There has been an exponential increase in the use of the term nontraditional security threat by Chinese academics since the SARS crisis, mainly focused on health and infectious disease, 6 indicating that Chinese conceptions of security have broadened. Since the SARS epidemic, the Chinese government has acknowledged the effects of infectious disease on security; every Chinese White Paper on National Defence has included the control of infectious disease since 2004. 8 Some infectious diseases have been successfully securitized in China, partially as a result of exposure to the international securitization of disease.",

Another study 47 suggested linking health with security gives a state the opportunity to gain \"security bonuses\" of increased economic and political support. 47 The increase in financial support, both from within the state and from international sources, can be a key benefit of securitization. 8 Chinese academics as a whole tend to argue that domestic reputation was a larger concern for Chinese officials during the SARS response than international reputation. 8 Although the Chinese government has strict control over the media, it has been argued that officials still From SARS to Avian Influenza J a n u a r y eF e b r u a r y 2 0 1 6 : 1 8 0 -1 8 8 have to gain public support for action to retain legitimacy and support for specific activities. 43 As the domestic support for the Chinese government was severely damaged by its response during the beginning of the SARS epidemic, 16 the securitization of the threat was a powerful method of re-establishing CCP legitimacy. As the leading party in a one party state, the CCP is not dependent on re-election but still requires domestic legitimacy. Both domestic and international policy issues are directly linked to CCP legitimacy and have an impact on Chinese foreign policy. 51 When communist ideology was no longer enough to sustain the legitimacy of the CCP, economic growth and increasing living standards became a form of \"performance-based legitimacy.\" 19 This performancebased legitimacy was damaged by the original response to the SARS outbreak. 19 The dramatic policy shift in relation to SARS, after the March 2003 leadership transition, increased the legitimacy of the CCP and President Hu Jintao. 23 As suggested, it was also an opportunity for Hu to consolidate his own position in the CCP and change the relationship with his predecessor, Jiang Zemin. 23 Domestic legitimacy appears to be one of the most important motivating factors for Chinese securitization of SARS and avian influenza outbreaks.",

Evidence suggests China has been persuaded of the value of many of the rules and norms of the WHO but prefers to act through health organizations that support its state-centric approach to health decision-making. Engagement with the WHO has slightly altered China's conception of sovereignty in infectious disease management but it continues to use health as a tool to achieve foreign policy goals. Analysis of the securitization of infectious disease in China and internationally explains how the government was able to effectively label HIV, SARS, and subsequent diseases as security threats, justifying large financial investment, but does not provide concrete insights into the specific domestic motivations for securitization.",
