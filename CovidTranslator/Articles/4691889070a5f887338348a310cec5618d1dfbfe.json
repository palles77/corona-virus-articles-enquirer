PD-1 + TIM-3 bright CEACAM1 + T cells were characterized by extremely low intracellular IL-2 and TNF-\u03b1 expression consistent with exhaustion (Fig. 4f ). Co-administration of an anti-mCEACAM1 and anti-mTIM-3 antibody delayed subcutaneous tumour growth in a preventative model ( Fig. 4g and Extended Data Fig. 7a) , and was able to exceed protection with co-blockade of PD-1 and TIM-3 (Extended Data Fig. 7b, c) . In a therapeutic model, blockade of CEACAM1 synergized with PD-1 inhibition (Extended Data Fig. 7d , e). CEACAM1 and TIM-3 co-blockade was associated with increased CD8 + (Fig.  4h ) and CD4 + (Fig. 4i ) TILs with enhanced IFN-\u03b3 production (Fig. 4j) and decreased IL-10 production (Extended Data Fig. 7f ) by the infiltrating CD8 + and CD4 + T cells, respectively.

This association is evident during early biosynthesis and crucial for proper maturation, cell surface display and function of TIM-3 and probably CEACAM1 when expressed together. CEACAM1 also functions as an essential trans-heterophilic ligand for TIM-3 with the tolerance-inducing functions of TIM-3 requiring interactions with CEACAM1 in both cis and trans configurations. CEACAM1 expression with TIM-3 is further characteristic of T cells with an exhausted phenotype such that in the absence of these interactions inflammatory responses are unrestrained and anti-tumour immunity enhanced. Together, these studies describe a novel class of heterodimeric protein interactions that function in tolerance induction with broad implications for many types of infectious, autoimmune and neoplastic conditions.

In brief, transgenic OT-II Rag2 \u2212/\u2212 or Ceacam1 \u2212/\u2212 Rag2 \u2212/\u2212 mice were injected intraperitonally with 500 \u00b5g of OVA peptide (323-339, 323-ISQAVHAAHAEINEAGR-329, AnaSpec) in an equal volume a mount of complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) or PBS alone at day 0 (activation of immune response) and at day 4 (tolerance induction). At day 10, CD4 + T cells were isolated from spleens and pooled peripheral lymphocytes from each experimentally treated mouse as indicated above. The pooled lymphocytes from each mouse were restimulated in vitro with various concentrations of OVA 323-339 peptide (0.1, 1, 2.5 and 10 \u00b5g ml \u22121 ). The 96-well cultures were set up with a total cell number of 2.5 \u00d7 10 4 in 200 \u00b5l RPMI complete medium pulsed with 1 \u00b5Ci [ 3 H]-thymidine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for the final 8h of the 72h assay, and collected with a Packard Micromate cell harvester. Counts per minute (c.p.m.) were determined using a Packard Matrix 96 direct counter (Packard Biosciences) and data expressed as median values. For in vivo tracking of OVA-specific antigen-specific T-cell responses, adoptive transfer experiments were performed on the basis of previous studies 27 . In brief, CD4 + V\u03b12 + T cells were isolated from spleens and pooled peripheral lymphocytes of transgenic OT-II Ceacam1 +/+ (wild-type) Rag2 \u2212/\u2212 mice and the cells were pre-incubated for 10 min with 4 mM CFSE in PBS plus 0.1% FBS. CFSElabelled cells (5 \u00d7 10 5 ) were injected intravenously by tail vein into syngeneic C57BL/6 wild-type or Ceacam1 \u2212/\u2212 recipients. After 18h to allow the adoptively transferred T cells to establish themselves in vivo, and which showed no differences in parking of the T cells among the various genotypes, the mice were then immunized with OVA 323-339 (50 \u00b5g) in an equal volume of CFA. On day 3, cells were collected from spleen, mesenteric lymph and peripheral lymph node of individual mice and stained with DAPI to exclude dead cells, and concurrently stained with anti-CD4-PerCp, anti-CEACAM1-allophycocyanin and anti-TIM-3-phycoerythrin. Total lymphocytes were gated and the CFSE subset representing the transgenic OT-II, adoptively transferred CD4 + T cells analysed and CEACAM1-and TIM-3-expression assessed on the CFSE-positive cells.",

In addition, multiple sequence alignments were performed using ClustalW 45 . From this analysis, we considered mouse CEACAM1 and TIM-3 as structurally similar proteins. Furthermore, as previous structural data for mouse CEACAM1 supported the formation of CEACAM1 homodimers between its N-terminal domains 14 , and given our evidence that mouse CEACAM1 and TIM-3 are highly similar, we further reasoned that mouse TIM-3 and its human orthologue might heterodimerize with CEACAM1 through their membrane-distal N-terminal domains. This hypothesis was modelled by us in the following manner. We aligned CEACAM1 symmetrically for cis modelling and asymmetrically for trans modelling along the five amino acid residues within the FG-CC\u2032 loops of mTIM-3 as reported previously 13 that describe putative docking sites for an unknown ligand for mouse TIM-3. The ROSIE Docking Server was used to analyse the docking (http://rosettadock.graylab.jhu.edu/documentation/docking) 46, 47 . We identified the ten best scoring structures from the run in rank order by energy. The top two in cis and the best in trans are shown in Extended Data Fig. 2g . The score (y axis) indicates the energy of the models (the lower the better). The r.m.s. (x axis) indicates the RMS values between the input and output docking models. The docking models identified were further assessed in PyMOL to determine whether the models identified predicted hydrogen bonding within the putative mouse CEACAM1-TIM-3 interface. On the basis of this we identified potential amino acids that may have an important role in mouse CEACAM1-TIM-3 binding, which is summarized in the table associated with Extended Data Fig. 2g .",
