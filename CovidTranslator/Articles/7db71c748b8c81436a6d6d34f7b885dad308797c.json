She had had difficult relationships with physicians because of the postsurgical cause of her hypoparathyroidism. So, once her grandson became a registered nurse, he managed her calcaemia himself, consulting me about possible therapeutic adjustments. Calcaemia was always measured at the same laboratory, where another grandson worked. For a long time he regularly reported that calcaemia was normal at values of 8\u00b76 to 9\u00b71.",
