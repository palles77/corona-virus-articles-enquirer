However, it is not known whether nsp10 functions in the regulation of CoV replication fidelity. To test this, we engineered single and double alanine substitution mutations into the genome of murine hepatitis virus (MHV-A59) containing ExoN activity [ExoN(\u0609)] at positions within nsp10 known to disrupt the nsp10-nsp14 interaction in vitro. We show that an nsp10 mutant, R80A/E82A-ExoN(\u0609), was five to ten times more sensitive to treatment with the RNA mutagen 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) than wild-type (WT)-ExoN(\u0609), suggestive of decreased replication fidelity. This decreased-fidelity phenotype was confirmed using two additional nucleoside analogs, 5-azacytidine and ribavirin. R80A/E82A-ExoN(\u0609) reached a peak titer similar to and demonstrated RNA synthesis kinetics comparable to those seen with WT-ExoN(\u0609). No change in 5-FU sensitivity was observed for R80A/E82A-ExoN(\u060a) relative to",

However, decreased fidelity is detrimental to CoV replication and virulence; mutant CoVs with decreased replication fidelity are attenuated and more sensitive to inhibition by RNA mutagens. Thus, identifying the viral protein determinants of CoV fidelity is important for understanding CoV replication, pathogenesis, and virulence. In this report, we show that nsp10, a small, nonenzymatic viral protein, contributes to CoV replication fidelity. Our data support the hypothesis that CoVs have evolved multiple proteins, in addition to nsp14-ExoN, that are responsible for maintaining the integrity of the largest known RNA genomes.",

It is the error rate (fidelity) of the viral replicase that generates the genetic diversity that is subjected to selection. At the core of all RNA virus replicases, with the exception of retroviruses, is the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). Research performed with numerous RNA viruses, including foot-and-mouth disease virus (1-3), poliovirus (4-10), chikungunya virus (11, 12) , influenza virus (13) , coxsackievirus B3 (14, 15) , and human enterovirus 71 (16) (17) (18) , has demonstrated that mutations within the viral RdRp can either increase or decrease replicase fidelity. In the vast majority of cases, alterations in replication fidelity result in decreased viral fitness and attenuation of virulence (reviewed in reference 19) . Also, viruses with altered replication fidelity have potential therapeutic value as live attenuated vaccines (5, 9, 20, 21) . Together, these observations underscore the need to elucidate the contributions of individual protein-protein interactions and virus-encoded enzymes to replicase fidelity.",

In addition to encoding RdRp activity within nonstructural protein 12 (nsp12-RdRp), CoVs encode 3=\u00a15= exoribonuclease (ExoN) activity within nsp14 (23, 24) . Biochemical studies have shown that ExoN is capable of removing 3= mismatches (25) , and inactivation of ExoN activity decreases the fidelity of the CoV replicase by up to 20-fold in tissue culture and in vivo (21, 26, 27) . Viruses lacking ExoN activity [ExoN(\u03ea)] have increased susceptibility to lethal mutagenesis in the presence of RNA mutagens (28) compared to wild-type (WT) viruses containing ExoN activity [ExoN(\u03e9)]. Thus, all available bioinformatic, biochemical, and virological data support the conclusion that CoVs have evolved proofreading capacity. Attempts to reconstitute the CoV replicase using recombinant proteins have been impeded by the limited polymerase activity observed for nsp12-RdRp in vitro (29) (30) (31) . Recent work by Subissi et al. demonstrated that nsp7 and nsp8 are required for processive RNA synthesis during CoV replication, in part by increasing the binding of nsp12-RdRp to the RNA template (32) . nsp12-RdRp is also capable of associating with nsp14-ExoN without disrupting the capacity of ExoN to cleave an RNA template.",

The nsp10 R80A/E82A-ExoN(\u03e9) double mutant has increased sensitivity to the base and nucleoside analogs 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), 5-azacytidine (AZA), and ribavirin (RBV) compared to WT-ExoN(\u03e9), indicative of decreased fidelity. When the nsp10 R80A/E82A substitutions were introduced into MHV-ExoN(\u03ea), there was no increase in 5-FU sensitivity beyond that of MHV-ExoN(\u03ea). Our results demonstrate that mutations in nsp10 decrease CoV fidelity and support the hypothesis that nsp10-mediated fidelity is dependent on intact ExoN activity. Our results are consistent with recent biochemical studies (25, 32) and support a model in which CoVs use multiple nonstructural proteins, including nsp10, nsp12, and nsp14, to faithfully replicate their large RNA genomes.",

For the ExoN(\u03ea) viruses, the F fragment containing the two ExoN mutations (D89A and E91A) was used (26) . A 1/10 volume of 3 M sodium acetate (pH \u03ed 5.5) and 1 volume of chloroform were added to the ligation reaction. The aqueous layer was removed to a new tube, and 1 volume of isopropanol was added to precipitate the DNA. This purified product was resuspended in nuclease-free water and was then transcribed using Ambion mMessage mMachine T7 with the following modifications in a total reaction volume of 50 l: 7.5 l of 3 mM GTP, 25 l 2\u03eb NTP/cap, 5 l of 10\u03eb reaction buffer, 7.5 l of template, and 5 l of the enzyme mix.

Incorporation of 5-FU is increased in low-fidelity viruses lacking ExoN activity [ExoN(\u03ea)], indicating that virus sensitivity to 5-FU treatment can be used to test for decreases in replication fidelity.

            "text": "Because formation of a stable nsp10-nsp14 complex likely involves multiple surface-exposed residues, substitution at one position might not be sufficient to alter nsp10-nsp14 interactions during virus infection. Thus, we introduced the alanine double substitutions N40A/R80A and R80A/E82A within nsp10. We then tested whether the alanine double substitutions N40A/R80A and R80A/E82A affected virus sensitivity to 5-FU treatment. No increased sensitivity was detected during infection at an MOI of 1 PFU/cell (Fig. 2C ). Infection at a higher MOI could mask a subtle increase in 5-FU sensitivity due to the capacity of the population to tolerate or complement mutations. Thus, we examined the sensitivity of N40A/R80A-ExoN(\u03e9) and R80A/E82A-ExoN(\u03e9) to 5-FU treatment at a low MOI (0.01 PFU/cell). Both N40A/R80A-ExoN(\u03e9) and R80A/E82A-ExoN(\u03e9) demonstrated increased sensitivity to 5-FU treatment compared to WT-ExoN(\u03e9) (Fig.  2D) . The 5-FU sensitivity of R80A/E82A-ExoN(\u03e9) was concentration dependent across the range tested, while N40A/R80A-ExoN(\u03e9) demonstrated a subtle increase in sensitivity only at 200 M 5-FU. Because of this, we focused primarily on the R80A/ E82A-ExoN(\u03e9) virus for subsequent experiments. These data demonstrate that mutations in nsp10 increase 5-FU sensitivity, consistent with decreased replication fidelity. Our data also indicate that the impact of nsp10 mutations on fidelity is less than that seen after inactivation of ExoN activity (28) , as the titer of MHV-ExoN(\u03ea) was decreased by almost 4 log 10 following treatment with 80 M 5-FU (Fig. 2E) .",

To confirm that the observed 5-FU sensitivity was a result of decreased fidelity, we tested whether R80A/E82A-ExoN(\u03e9) was sensitive to the nucleoside analogs 5-azacytidine (AZA) and ribavirin (RBV). AZA and RBV have been shown to induce mutagenesis of RNA virus genomes, most recently for influenza virus (43) . We examined the sensitivity of R80A/E82A-ExoN(\u03e9) to AZA and RBV during infection at a low MOI (0.01 PFU/cell). Both MHV-ExoN(\u03ea) and R80A/E82A-ExoN(\u03e9) showed increased sensitivity to AZA compared with WT-ExoN(\u03e9) at concentrations at and above 20 M (Fig. 3A) . R80A/E82A-ExoN(\u03e9) was between 10-fold and 100-fold more sensitive to AZA treatment than WT-ExoN(\u03e9). MHV-ExoN(\u03ea) was undetectable by plaque assay at concentrations above 20 M, consistent with the strong mutator phenotype. Since AZA also inhibited WT-ExoN(\u03e9) replication and exhibited cellular toxicity (Fig. 3B) , we examined the sensitivity of all three viruses to the guanosine analog RBV. We previously showed that MHV-ExoN(\u03ea), but not WT-ExoN(\u03e9), is sensitive to treatment with RBV (28) . Consistent with our previous data, RBV showed minimal cytotoxicity at concentrations up to 50 M and had no effect on the WT-ExoN(\u03e9) titer ( Fig. 3C and D) . MHV-ExoN(\u03ea) was undetectable by plaque assay at RBV concentrations above 20 M, and R80A/E82A-ExoN(\u03e9) was more than 100-fold more sensitive to RBV treatment than WT-ExoN(\u03e9) at higher concentrations. These results indicate that the R80A/E82A substitutions in nsp10 decrease CoV replication fidelity to levels between those seen with WT-ExoN(\u03e9) and MHV-ExoN(\u03ea).",

To determine the impact of these mutations during infection, we examined the replication kinetics of R80A/ E82A-ExoN(\u03e9) compared to those of WT-ExoN(\u03e9) and MHV-ExoN(\u03ea). R80A/E82A-ExoN(\u03e9) replication kinetics were similar to those seen with WT-ExoN(\u03e9) during infection at an MOI of 1 and 0.01 PFU/cell ( Fig. 4A and B) , though the virus titers were lower than those of WT-ExoN(\u03e9) at early time points. No enzymatic activity has been reported or predicted for nsp10. However, mutations in MHV-A59 nsp10 have been reported to impact viral RNA synthesis (39) . We therefore measured genomic and subgenomic RNA levels of the R80A/E82A-ExoN(\u03e9) mutant during infection at an MOI of 1 PFU/cell using two-step qRT-PCR. Genomic and subgenomic RNA levels were normalized to the endogenous GAPDH control and were measured in both the presence and the absence of 5-FU treatment. WT-ExoN(\u03e9) and R80A/E82A-ExoN(\u03e9) demonstrated similar RNA synthesis kinetics, and RNA accumulation was not affected by 5-FU treatment ( Fig. 4C and D) . On the basis of these data, we conclude that the increased 5-FU sensitivity of R80A/E82A-ExoN(\u03e9) is not due to impairment of viral RNA synthesis.",

Both MHV-A59 and SARS-CoV lacking 2=-OMT activity display increased sensitivity to exogenous interferon beta (IFN-\u2424) treatment due to increased recognition by host interferon-stimulated genes (34) (35) (36) . Because of the dual functions of nsp10, we tested whether R80A/E82A-ExoN(\u03e9) displayed increased sensitivity to IFN-\u2424. As a positive control, we engineered and recovered MHV-A59 with an alanine substitution mutation in nsp16 (nsp16 D130A). This mutation abolishes SARS-CoV 2=-OMT activity and renders both MHV-A59 and SARS-CoV sensitive to exogenous IFN-\u2424 treatment (34, 36) . Following IFN-\u2424 treatment, the nsp16 D130A virus titer was reduced by approximately 5 log 10 (Fig.  5) . In contrast, titers of both WT-ExoN(\u03e9) and R80A/E82A-ExoN(\u03e9) were reduced by approximately 1 log 10 .

To test this hypothesis, we sought to stress protein-protein interactions by increasing the temperature at which we performed the 5-FU sensitivity experiments. In the absence of 5-FU, the titers of both WT-ExoN(\u03e9) and R80A/E82A-ExoN(\u03e9) decreased by approximately 1 log 10 during infection at 40\u00b0C compared to 37\u00b0C (Fig. 7A) , indicating that R80A/E82A-ExoN(\u03e9) was not temperature sensitive. Following treatment with either 100 M or 200 M 5-FU at 40\u00b0C, the titer of WT-ExoN(\u03e9) decreased by only 2-fold to 3-fold relative to treatment at 37\u00b0C (Fig. 7B) .

            "text": "Recent data demonstrate that multiple CoV nsp's are required for processive RNA replication (32) and that nsp10 interacts with this complex. Combined with data from previous studies showing the capacity of nsp10 to enhance nsp14-ExoN activity (25, 32) and the involvement of nsp10 in CoV RNA synthesis (39) , these data suggest that nsp10 is a core component of the CoV replicase. Here we show that R80A and E82A mutations within nsp10, positions pre-viously shown to disrupt the SARS-CoV nsp10-nsp14 interaction in vitro, led to decreased replication fidelity ( Fig. 2 and 3) . During the course of our study, Bouvet et al. reported an extensive panel of SARS-CoV nsp10 mutations that disrupt the nsp10-nsp14 interaction (33) . Only two mutations, K43A and Y96F, could be recovered, but the authors observed no increase in virus sensitivity to 5-FU treatment. These data are consistent with the phenotype of our single nsp10 mutants (Fig. 2) and suggest that single point mutations within nsp10 might not be sufficient to disrupt the nsp10-nsp14 interaction during virus replication. This is in con- trast with results of studies performed using transiently transfected and recombinant nsp10 and nsp14 (25, 33) , in which single point mutations were capable of disrupting nsp10-nsp14 interactions. However, the differences between these previous studies and ours are probably due to the absence of other CoV replicase proteins. Replicase stability is likely determined by a network of protein-protein interactions involving the surfaces of multiple CoV nsp's (45) (46) (47) . Thus, a slight decrease in the strength of the nsp10-nsp14 interaction might be compensated for by other protein-protein interactions.",

            "text": "Our data support the hypothesis that the phenotype of R80A/ E82A-ExoN(\u03e9) is due to modulation of ExoN activity. R80A/ E82A-ExoN(\u03e9) displayed RNA synthesis kinetics similar to those of WT-ExoN(\u03e9) (Fig. 4) and did not exhibit increased IFN-\u2424 sensitivity compared to WT-ExoN(\u03e9) (Fig. 5) , indicating that the R80A and E82A substitutions do not impact nsp16 -2=-OMT activity. Most importantly, introduction of the R80A and E82A substitutions into the genome of MHV-A59 lacking ExoN activity [R80A/E82A-ExoN(\u03ea)] did not further increase virus sensitivity to 5-FU treatment (Fig. 6 ) compared to that seen with MHV-ExoN(\u03ea). By analogy to Escherichia coli DNA polymerase III (Pol III), nsp10 could function by stabilizing nsp14-ExoN, by enhancing removal of 3= terminal mismatches during virus replication, or by driving the association of nsp14 with other replicase components. The DNA Pol III holoenzyme contains at least 17 subunits, and the catalytic site is composed of a heterotrimeric polymerase core with polymerase (\u2423), exonuclease (\u03b5), and subunits (recently reviewed in reference 48). The subunit is a small 8-to-9-kDa protein that has no known enzymatic function but has been shown to enhance the proofreading activity of \u03b5 by 2-fold to 4-fold (49, 50) and to stabilize \u03b5 under thermal inactivation conditions (51, 52) . However, \u03b5 is not dependent upon the presence of the subunit (49, 51, 53, 54) . Both the N7-MT and ExoN activities of nsp14 were first reported independently of nsp10 (24, 55) , demonstrating that nsp10 is not a requirement for nsp14 enzymatic activity. This is in contrast to the SARS-CoV nsp10-nsp16 interaction, in which binding of nsp10 to nsp16 is required for nsp16 -2=-OMT activity (37, 38, 56) . The affinity of nsp14 for RNA has not been reported; however, the presence of two zinc finger (ZnF) domains within nsp10, coupled with the capacity of nsp10 to bind RNA, suggests that nsp10 could recruit nsp14 to RNA (57). nsp10 has not been reported to enhance nsp14 -N7-MT activity (44) ; however, the interaction of nsp10 with nsp14 could conceivably dictate whether or not nsp14 functions primarily in viral RNA capping, fidelity, or other uncharacterized functions.",

Because nsp10 is required for CoV replication, it is unlikely that the phenotype observed at 40\u00b0C is due to temperature-dependent misfolding of nsp10. This interpretation is supported by the lack of temperature sensitivity of R80A/E82A-ExoN(\u03e9) compared to WT-ExoN(\u03e9) at 40\u00b0C (Fig. 7A) . Elevated temperature could be further disrupting nsp14 association with nsp10, thus either exerting a direct effect on nsp14-ExoN activity or affecting the rate at which nsp14 is associating with the replicase complex. Additionally, this phenotype could be due to destabilization of nsp14 in the absence of nsp10. The development of reagents to examine and detect nsp14 expression in tissue culture will be critical in resolving these important issues.",
