            "text": "Concern from the public is growing regarding early cow-calf separation, yet proponents of this practice maintain that artificial rearing is critical for cow and calf health. Early separation is assumed to reduce the risk of transfer of pathogens from dam to neonatal calf, but a wide range of health benefits associated with extended cow-calf contact has also been documented. The aim of this systematic review was to report and synthesize conclusions from the literature on dairy cow and calf health in conventional rearing versus cow-calf contact systems. Peer-reviewed, published manuscripts, written in English, directly comparing dairy cow or calf health in artificial versus suckling systems, were eligible for inclusion. We conducted 7 targeted searches using Web of Science to identify key literature on important health conditions. The resulting manuscripts underwent a 4-step appraisal process, and further manuscripts were sourced from reference lists. This process resulted in a final sample of 70 articles that addressed cow and calf health. Sufficient literature was available to assess mastitis in cows, and scours, cryptosporidiosis, Johne's disease, pneumonia, immunity, and mortality in calves. The results for cryptosporidiosis, pneumonia, immunity, and mortality were mixed, with some differences between studies likely attributable to flawed comparisons between cohorts. Overall, the articles addressing calf scours and mastitis pointed to beneficial or no effects of suckling. The studies addressing Johne's disease did not find cow-calf contact to be a significant risk factor. In conclusion, the scientific peer-reviewed literature on cow and calf health provides no consistent evidence in support of early separation.",

            "text": "One oft-cited rationale for immediate cow-calf separation is the health benefit ostensibly afforded by artificial calf rearing. For example, Faubert and Litvinsky (2000) claim that this practice reduces the risk of Cryptosporidium parvum infections. Muskens et al. (2003) make a similar claim for Johne's disease, and Daugschies and Najdrowski (2005) for eimeriosis. However, such literature does not always cite evidence to corroborate these assertions. The concern over disease transmission stems from the agammaglobulinemic state of the neonatal calf and its heightened susceptibility to disease during this time. Artificial feeding of calves is thought to allow better control of colostral quality and quantity and thus improve transfer of maternal immunoglobulins to the calf. Moreover, the dam's fecal coliform count increases by up to 10 7 cfu during the periparturient period (Pelan-Mattocks et al., 2000) , leading to a concern that calves permitted to remain in the calving area are at an increased risk of exposure to pathogens (McGuirk, 2008) .",

Conversely, 2 studies (Svensson et al., 2003; Roth et al., 2009 ) reported a greater risk of scours in dam-reared animals. Roth et al. (2009) hypothesized that the higher incidence in nurs-ing calves could be explained by the increased quantity of milk consumed by these animals, rather than by infectious causes. Indeed, Wagenaar and Langhout (2007) reported that the type of scouring sometimes observed Figure 1 . Flowchart depicting the manuscript screening and appraisal process. Note that summing the studies included in the qualitative synthesis in each subsection yields 87 studies, rather than 70. This discrepancy results from the inclusion of 9 studies in 2 specific sections and 4 studies in 3 specific sections. A deletion of the duplicates results in 70 unique studies. Listed for each study are country, breed of cattle, type of cow-calf contact, duration of this contact, how milk or colostrum (or both) was fed to calves in the control condition (i.e., in which calves were not allowed to suckle), the amount of milk provided in this condition, the total number of calves followed, the number of herds (and groups within a herd where relevant), and the authors' conclusion and direction of effect (with + signifying a beneficial effect of suckling or cow-calf contact, \u2212 signifying a negative effect, and = representing no difference. Studies are ordered chronologically within effect direction in suckling calves was characteristically distinct from that of bucket-fed counterparts, primarily because it did not lead to the animals dirtying their backsides. Boonbrahm et al. (2004a) found that mortality from scours and other conditions was higher in bucket-fed calves (15%) compared with dam-reared calves (0%), again suggesting a different etiology. It is now well known that high volumes of milk may contribute to looser manure in calves (see Khan et al., 2011) , which need not reflect any infection. Methods of evaluating scours in calves should therefore take into account differences in fecal consistency associated with level of milk intake. Although the balance of the research seems to point to either neutral or positive effects of dam rearing on calf scours, results are mixed with respect to Cryptosporidium (see Table 2 ). Two of the 9 included studies reported a protective effect of the dam's presence (Kvac et al., 2006; Duranti et al., 2009) , 4 reported no difference (Maldonado Camargo et al., 1998; Mohammed et al., 1999; Delafosse et al., 2015; Garro et al., 2016) , and the remaining 3 (Quigley et al., 1994; Trotz-Williams et al., 2007 , 2008a indicated that dam-calf contact increases the risk of infection. This lack of consensus may stem from variation in study design and outcome measurements (e.g., herd versus sample-level prevalence), in breed (dairy versus mixed dairy-beef), or in the diagnostic methods chosen. Despite the conflicting results, the collective burden of available odds ratios and risk ratios is skewed toward a protective effect of suckling.",

However, none of the included articles were able to identify increased MAP prevalence among herds permitting cow-calf contact, even in preliminary univariable analyses (with the exception of Pillars et al., 2011) . Official Johne's disease control programs frequently describe the risks associated with allowing the calf to suckle and remain within the maternity area, or directly recommend immediate separation of cow and calf following parturition; such programs include the Three Step Calf Rearing Plan of Australia (Animal Health Australia, 2016), the Voluntary Bovine Johne's Disease Control Program of the United States (USDA, 2010), and several regionspecific Canadian programs [such as the Atlantic Veterinary College (2015) Johne's Disease Initiative, which deems calf nursing to be a risky practice, even within test-negative herds]. Given the lack of quantitative evidence on the value of immediate cow-calf separation, the persistence and regularity of this recommendation is surprising. A common theme that emerged in our systematic search of this topic was the presence of unsubstantiated claims regarding MAP prevalence and cow-calf separation. An example of the dissemination of such claims within the literature is shown in Figure 2 .",

            "text": "The hypothesis regarding biological relevance is not unfounded because calves under 6 mo of age are most susceptible to MAP infection. Mycobacterium avium ssp. paratuberculosis may be transmitted from an infected dam to calf in utero or through direct bacterial shedding into colostrum or milk; however, MAP infection occurs predominantly by means of a contaminated environment, via the fecal-oral route (Lombard, 2011) . We may thus imagine that prompt calf removal could mitigate transmission. Several mathematical models (e.g., Collins and Morgan, 1991; Marc\u00e9 et al., 2011) have demonstrated that removing the calf from the calving area, or minimizing the effective number of cow-calf contacts, reduces MAP prevalence, but such models are often parameterized based upon an assumption that transmission increases for calves contacting adult animals. Yet, in some herds, cow-calf separation has supplanted control strategies for which concrete evidence exists to tie the respec-tive strategy to a reduction in MAP prevalence. For example, Wells and Wagner (2000) noted that herds in which cows and calves were separated at 1 h (compared with >24 h) were more than 3 times as likely to have had a previous Johne's disease diagnosis. The authors posit that herd managers altered their management practices following the positive herd status report. In contrast, the practice of sourcing >25% of animals from outside dairies was associated with a current Johne's disease diagnosis in the herd, yet no evidence was provided to suggest that this practice underwent a similar modification (Wells and Wagner, 2000) . Johnson-Ifearulundu and Kaneene (1998) reported that the process of cleaning maternity pens was linked to a 3-fold reduction in the odds of a positive herd-level MAP status. However, many commercial herds allow multiple animals in the calving area (e.g., 59% in the United States; USDA, 2016) or permit sick cows to be housed in these areas (25%). Of those herds that did use dedicated individual maternity pens, only 20 to 34% (depending on herd size) cleaned the area after each calving (USDA, 2016). There is evidence for a synergism of infection risk in the calving area, based upon the level of environmental cleanliness, udder hygiene, and presence of other lactating animals (Beaver et al., 2016) . The evidence we have reviewed indicates that prompt calf removal should not be viewed as a substitute for proper hygiene and management in the maternity area.",

The majority (n = 6) were single-herd trials, and 3 were multi-herd studies (Table 5) . The cited studies present conflicting conclusions. For example, Stott et al. (1979) and Quigley et al. (1995) described a positive association between suckling and immunoglobulin absorption in neonatal calves, and Selman et al. (1971) found that the presence of the dam led to improved passive transfer. In contrast, several articles concluded that suckling results in higher levels of FPT (Nocek et al., 1984; Besser et al., 1991; Trotz-Williams et al., 2008b; Beam et al., 2009 ). This discrepancy may, in part, be traced back to the source and quantity of colostrum offered to control groups. It is now well established that quantity, quality, and promptness of colostrum administration is pivotal in facilitating immunoglobulin absorption and thus lowering the rate of FPT (see Godden, 2008) . The current recommendation stipulates that calves obtain 10 to 12% of their BW in colostrum at first feeding, and additional benefits have been shown in calves receiving further doses of colostrum at 12 h postpartum (Godden, 2008) . In several of the older studies (Stott et al., 1979; Quigley et al., 1995) , the volume of colostrum fed to control groups would be considered insufficient by today's standards, and is likely not comparable to the amount a suckling calf would obtain from the dam. Moreover, in Stott et al. (1979) the colostrum provided to control calves was pooled; pooling has been reported to increase the bacterial burden, leading to inhibition of immunoglobulin absorption (Stewart et al., 2005) . Thus, differences in FPT between dam-reared and artificially raised calves may be attributable to colostrum allowance.",

Because these herds likely differed in a variety of other dimensions, and successful immunoglobulin absorption is affected by numerous external factors (Godden, 2008) , it is difficult to isolate the effect of suckling. Besser et al. (1991) made some effort to measure colostrum quality in all groups, but large volumes were fed to the control animals, and the authors acknowledge that these would far exceed the expected intake of a suckling calf. In Nocek et al. (1984) and Beam et al.

Thus, the same concerns regarding insufficient colostrum allowance (Stott et al., 1979; Quigley et al., 1995) are replicated, but in this case, are transferred to the suckling group.",

For example, McAloon et al. (2016) found that increased time spent in the calving pen was associated with diminished immunoglobulin absorption, likely because many calves did not suckle in the first few hours after birth. Arguably, these conclusions are attributable to latency until farmer intervention rather than time spent with the dam, per se. Producers aim to provide prompt administration of high quality colostrum to separated calves and could provide similar interventions for the suckling calf. (Goodger et al., 1996) represents an aggregate of the following management practices: (1) whether colostrum was harvested from a clean udder (free of manure), (2) whether the bottles used to store colostrum were clean, (3) whether colostrum was pooled, and (4) whether calves were permitted extended contact with the dam. MAP = Mycobacterium avium ssp. paratuberculosis. Listed for each study are country, breed of cattle, type of cow-calf contact, duration of this contact, how colostrum was fed to calves in the control condition (i.e., in which calves were not allowed to suckle), the amount of colostrum provided in this condition, the total number of calves followed, the number of herds (and groups within a herd), and the authors' conclusion and direction of effect (with + signifying a beneficial effect of suckling or cow-calf contact, \u2212 signifying a negative effect, and = representing no difference.

Calves may exhibit a higher latency to suckle if they have low vigor or if the dam has experienced a difficult calving (Rajala and Castr\u00e9n, 1995) . Thus, the farmer cannot rely upon nature alone but rather should supervise and intervene if necessary to promote adequate passive immune transfer to the calf. Calves born to dams with low-hanging udders (Ventorp and Michanek, 1992) may also have more difficulty obtaining colostrum by suckling, suggesting that these calves in particular could benefit from active assistance with nursing or administration of colostrum by bottle. Together these observations indicate that various types of farmer intervention, including careful observation and supplementary feeding, may be beneficial regardless of whether the calf is separated from the cow.",

One study (Stewart et al., 2005) found that the process of harvesting colostrum into a bucket resulted in dramatically higher bacterial counts than in directly stripped colostrum. Additionally, bacteria in colostrum can multiply precipitously when kept at ambient room temperature and may even reach concentrations exceeding 1,000,000 cfu/mL after 48 h of refrigeration (Stewart et al., 2005) . Bacterial growth in colostrum may add variation to how calves perform when fed by bucket or teat; artificial colostrum feeding is therefore likely to work best on farms able to mitigate this risk (e.g., through decontamination of storage containers).",

            "text": "There appears to be little consensus regarding mortality in dam-reared versus conventionally raised calves. The reasons for this variation are likely similar to those previously described for the FPT outcomes. That is, conventionally reared calves may be at risk when study methodology results in inadequate colostrum uptake (as in Quigley et al., 1995) . Insufficient colostrum quantity has been definitively linked to FPT, which, in turn, has strong associations with mortality (see Godden, 2008) . Similarly, dam-reared calves may experience increased mortality rates when colostrum intake is unmonitored, unaided, or not quality-controlled. The confounding of dam rearing with low-input management may account for the conclusions from large-scale, multi-herd studies such as Jenny et al. (1981) and Wells et al. (1996) . Indeed, Jenny et al. (1981) stated that farmers leaving calves with the dam may wrongly assume these calves have obtained sufficient colostrum via suckling. In contrast, farmers separating the calf and dam must undertake the \"mothering role\" themselves and provide individualized attention. Waltner-Toews et al. (1986) noted an interesting phenomenon in calves provided assistance at suckling. In this study, calves that suckled colostrum naturally were less likely to require treatment for disease than were calves fed colostrum by bucket; however, calves requiring assistance to suckle also had higher odds of being treated for disease compared with calves suckling naturally. These findings could indicate that farmers were more concerned about the assisted suckling group and therefore were more likely to provide treatment, or that these animals were \"weak calves to begin with\" (p. 154) and thus required more treatment. In any case, these findings do not imply that suckling assistance itself leads to increased disease rates.",

(2016) , the studies reviewed here demonstrate a beneficial effect of suckling systems in reducing the risk of mastitis in dairy cows. In addition to the advantages of suckling to remove residual milk from the udder, reduced mastitis rates in suckled cows could be attributed to lysozymes for bacterial inhibition present in calf saliva (Mdegela et al., 2004) . No study in our systematic review demonstrated an increased risk of IMI in suckled cows; however, one study did report higher rates of teat damage (Thomas et al., 1981) . This damage was most pronounced in cows suckling 4 calves twice daily for 8 wk compared with machine milking. These authors recommend nursing for shorter durations to prevent the temporary teat damage associated with continuous, long-term suckling. Walsh (1974) found that the greatest benefits in mastitis prevention afforded to nursing cows were in early and mid-lactation. Together, these results suggest that producers interested in reducing the risk of mastitis should consider the use of suckling, particularly in early lactation (see also K\u00e4lber and Barth, 2014) .",

In sum, the evidence presented in this review does not support the recommendation of immediate separation to promote calf health. Specifically, we found no consistent evidence of increased risk of pneumonia in calves reared with the cow; however, the available literature on this subject was limited and often did not address the subject of respiratory health as a primary research objective. With respect to enteric health, the majority of studies demonstrated that rearing the calf with the dam had no effect on scours, or was associated with a reduced risk. Future research should aim to identify differences in etiology (e.g., infectious versus nutritional causes) between scours in dam-reared compared with artificially reared calves. The leading cause of mortality in dairy calves is diarrhea, for which a wide variety of enteric pathogens are responsible (Cho and Yoon, 2014) . With the exception of C. parvum (for which the evidence was mixed), common pathogenic causes of scours in the dairy calf have not been evaluated in detail in artificial compared with suckling systems (apart from the work of Klein et al., 2013, and Quigley et al., 1994) .",

Studies demonstrating benefits associated with suckling typically did not provide sufficient colostrum or milk to the artificially reared calves. Similarly, articles detailing the risks of leaving the calf with the dam did not systematically monitor colostrum intake, quality, and suckling latency. Interestingly, our systematic review uncovered only a single study addressing immunity and one addressing mortality authored within the last decade (Beam et al., 2009, and Gulliksen et al., 2009b, respectively) . In Nocek et al. (1984) , several experimental groups were completely deprived of colostrum. Given our current knowledge of the importance of colostrum quality, quantity, and timeliness of provision, further studies should assess the feasibility of keeping the calf with the dam and providing supplemental high-quality colostrum as soon as possible after parturition.",

All of the studies included in this review demonstrated a reduced risk of mastitis in nursing dairy cattle or reported no difference. Mastitis is one of the most prevalent disorders in dairy systems worldwide, and some evidence suggests that incidence is on the rise in North American herds (see USDA, 2007 , versus USDA, 2018 . As mastitis is also, arguably, the most economically significant challenge facing dairy producers (see Seegers et al., 2003; Jamali et al., 2018) , the favorable conclusions with regard to dam-calf suckling should not be taken lightly. Our conclusions on mastitis are in agreement with other reviews on this topic (e.g., Kamboj and Kumar, 2013; K\u00e4lber and Barth, 2014; Johnsen et al., 2016) ; the consensus among these authors is that some type of Listed for each study are country, breed of cattle, type of cow-calf contact allowed, duration of this contact, how colostrum was fed to calves in the control condition (i.e., in which calves were not allowed to suckle), the amount of colostrum provided in this condition, the age range of calves under study, the total number of calves followed, the number of herds (and groups within a herd), and the authors' conclusion and direction of effect (with + signifying a beneficial effect of suckling or cow-calf contact, \u2212 signifying a negative effect, and = representing no difference. Studies are ordered chronologically within effect direction restricted suckling system has the potential to reduce mastitis on dairy farms. Future research is necessary to determine the exact mechanisms responsible for reducing this risk (e.g., removal of residual milk by the calf, lysozymes present in calf saliva, and so on). Surprisingly, there was an absence of literature addressing other common postpartum diseases and conditions such as metritis, ketosis, and retention of the fetal membrane. In their review, Flower and Weary (2003) address retained fetal membranes and cite the Danish work of Krohn et al. (1990) , which highlights a beneficial effect of suckling on lowering the risk of placental retention. Flower and Weary (2003) suggest that this evidence could partially explain the lower incidence of retained fetal membranes in beef compared with dairy cows (Noakes, 1997) . Another study demonstrated no effects of immediate calf separation on latency of placental expulsion or placentophagia (Lidfors, 1996) . Given the importance of postpartum diseases on the longevity and productivity of dairy cattle (Mulligan and Doherty, 2008) , this area of research requires further exploration.",

(1978) , calves were reunited with the dam once per day (for an unspecified amount of time) for approximately 1 mo. Further, in several studies (e.g., Fallon and Harte, 1980; Nocek et al., 1984) , dam-calf suckling is referenced, but the duration of contact between cows and calves in the control group is not described.",

Instead, only the direction of association was highlighted, and our discussion is mainly based upon on the number of positive and negative associations. A weakness of this approach is that it weighs equally all studies, regardless of sample size, effect size, and any weaknesses in design and interpretation.",
