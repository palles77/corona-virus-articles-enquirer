Although rodent models of ZEBOV infection are useful for screening prospective countermeasures, they are frequently not useful for prediction of effi cacy in the more stringent non-human primate models. We therefore assessed the effi cacy of modifi ed non-immunostimulatory siRNAs in a uniformly lethal non-human primate model of ZEBOV haemorrhagic fever.",

            "text": "For more than 30 years, Ebola virus (EBOV) has been associated with periodic episodes of haemorrhagic fever in Central Africa that produce severe disease in infected patients. Mortality rates during outbreaks have ranged from 50% with the Sudan species of EBOV (SEBOV) to up to 90% with the Zaire species (ZEBOV). 1 An outbreak towards the end of 2007, caused by an apparently new species of EBOV in Uganda, seemed to be less pathogenic than SEBOV or ZEBOV with a case fatality rate of about 25%. 2 EBOV particles contain a non-infectious RNA genome of roughly 19 kilobases that encodes seven structural proteins and one non-structural protein. The gene order is 3\u00b4 leader, nucleoprotein, virion protein (VP) 35 (VP35), VP40, glycoprotein, VP30, VP24, polymerase L protein, and 5\u00b4 trailer. 3 Four of these proteins-nucleoprotein, VP30, VP35, and the polymerase L protein-are associated with the viral genomic RNA in the ribonucleoprotein complex. The L protein and VP35 make up the polymerase complex, which transcribes and replicates the EBOV genome. The L protein provides the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity of the complex. This protein is an ideal target for antiviral interventions not only because its suppression should lead to a nearly complete loss of all RNA synthesis, but also because of the absence of similar proteins in mammalian cells. VP24 and VP35 are also promising targets for antiviral interventions since both have been shown to have inhibitory eff ects on the host type 1 interferon response. Specifi cally, VP35 functions as a type 1 interferon antagonist by blocking the activation of interferon regulatory factor 3 and possibly preventing transcription of interferon \u03b2. 4 Consistent with these fi ndings, mutations of ZEBOV VP35 rendered an adapted virus avirulent in guineapigs. 5 VP24 expression interferes with type 1 interferon signalling, 6 and mutations in VP24 have been linked to adaptation by ZEBOV to produce a lethal infection in mice 7 and guineapigs. 8 Although there are no vaccines or postexposure treatments for prevention or management of EBOV infections, progress has been made over the past few years in the development of candidate preventive vaccines that can protect non-human primates against infection with EBOV. 1 Progress in the development of antiviral drugs and For the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool see http://jura.wi. mit.edu/bioc/siRNAext/ other postexposure interventions has been much slower. RNA interference represents a promising intervention for the treatment of diseases, including those caused by viruses. Indeed, RNA interference has been used in cell culture systems and rodents to inhibit the replication of several pathogens that cause disease in human beings. However, its usefulness as an eff ective treatment in nonhuman primate models of human infectious diseases has been assessed in only two studies. 9, 10 Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) inhibited the replication of hepatitis GB virus B in a non-lethal marmoset surrogate model of human hepatitis C. 9 siRNAs against severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus inhibited the virus replication in a non-lethal rhesus monkey model. 10 However, unmodifi ed immune stimulatory siRNAs were used in both of these studies, potentially confounding the interpretation of the results. Until now, the usefulness of RNA interference as a postexposure treatment has not been assessed in a lethal model of a human infectious disease in non-human primates.",

EK-1 was previously described. 11 siRNAs for targeting the VP24 and VP35 genes were identifi ed by screening in vitro for reduction in expression of the ZEBOV VP24 or ZEBOV VP35 viral transgene inserted in the psiCHECK2 dual-luciferase plasmid system (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) under the control of the SV40 promoter in HepG2 cells. 10 \u03bcL of Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) complexes containing 0\u00b775 \u03bcg of plasmid and 10 \u03bcL of siRNA (VP24-775, VP24-978, VP24-1160, or a non-specifi c negative control siRNA at 1\u00b73 nmol/L, 2\u00b75 nmol/L, 5\u00b70 nmol/L, 10\u00b70 nmol/L, 20\u00b70 nmol/L, and 40\u00b70 nmol/L; or VP35-219, VP35-349, VP35-687, VP35-855, or a non-specifi c negative control siRNA at 0\u00b78 nmol/L, 4\u00b70 nmol/L, and 20\u00b70 nmol/L) were added to a 96-well plate before addition of 80 \u03bcL of HepG2 cells (15 000 cells per well). Cells were lysed 48 h after transfection. The dual-luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) and a Berthold luminometer (Berthold Detection Systems, Pforzheim, Germany) were used to measure Renilla luciferase (fused to ZEBOV VP24 or ZEBOV VP35 transgene) and fi refl y luciferase signals. The Renilla luciferase signal was normalised to the fi refl y luciferase signal and expressed as percentage gene expression relative to a plasmid-only control assigned a value of 100%. Table 1 shows the sequences of siRNAs that were used.",

Since non-selective chemical modifi cation might attenuate the potency of the siRNA, we selectively modifi ed lead siRNAs by substituting 2\u00b4-O-methyl guanosine or uridines in both strands to eliminate the immune stimulatory capacity of the siRNA duplex, [13] [14] [15] and confi rmed the gene silencing activity of the modifi ed versions using the in-vitro plasmid-based ZEBOV gene expression system (data not shown). SNALPs containing modifi ed ZEBOV siRNAs did not induce interferon \u03b1 or interleukin 6 in the plasma of mice, whereas SNALPs containing chemically unmodifi ed Luc siRNA induced high concentrations of both plasma cytokines (fi gure 2A and B). Analysis of liver IFIT1 mRNA showed no diff erences between SNALPs containing PBS (negative control) and those containing the 2-O-methyl-modifi ed Luc or ZEBOV siRNA cocktail, whereas the SNALPs containing unmodifi ed Luc induced high levels of IFIT1 mRNA (1169-fold greater than the PBS control; fi gure 2). No diff erences were noted in clinical signs and organ weights of mice treated with SNALPs containing siRNAs or PBS. Native (chemically unmodifi ed) versions of Luc, EK-1, VP24-1160, and VP35-855 siRNAs also induced high levels of interferon \u03b1 in cultures of human PBMCs, whereas the 2\u00b4-O-methylmodifi ed versions of siRNAs at up to 400 nmol/L did not induce any interferon \u03b1 (fi gure 2). Figure 3A shows that SNALPs containing ZEBOV siRNAs substantially reduced ZEBOV produced in supernatants of Vero E6 cells 48 h after infection. Figure 3B shows that SNALPs containing EK-1-mod, VP35-855-mod, or VP24-1160-mod induced specifi c mRNA cleavage only of their target mRNA in the cells, whereas all three PCR products of the correct predicted size were present in cells treated with SNALPs containing the ZEBOV cocktail of siRNAs (fi gure 3B).

            "text": "The development of treatments for EBOV-induced haemorrhagic fever has been slow and no previous candidate treatment has shown complete protection against ZEBOV haemorrhagic fever in non-human primates. Some success has been achieved with interventions that mitigate the coagulation disorders that characterise EBOV infection. 19, 21 We protected 50% of non-human primates against ZEBOV by administering a live-attenuated recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus vaccine vector that expressed the ZEBOV glycoprotein shortly after a lethal ZEBOV challenge. 22 Several new postexposure treatments based on siRNA 11 and antisense oligomers 23, 24 have shown promising results in rodent models, but there have been no reports of the assessment of either treatment strategy after EBOV challenge in non-human primates, which more faithfully reproduce human EBOV infections than do other animal models. 1, 18 This model was rapid and uniformly lethal (death in all 21 naive rhesus macaques challenged with the same ZEBOV seed stock by the same dose and route as in the present study; Geisbert TW, unpublished) in which animals typically succumbed 6-10 days after challenge with the virus (mean time to death 8\u00b73 days). The ZEBOV target in the siRNA postexposure treatment study in guineapigs was the L polymerase gene, and treatment initiated 1 h after ZEBOV challenge completely Fever was defi ned as a temperature that was 2\u00b75\u00b0F greater than baseline temperature or at least 1\u00b75\u00b0F greater than baseline temperature, and at least 103\u00b75\u00b0F. Mild rash was defi ned as focal petechiae covering less than 10% of skin. Moderate rash was defi ned as petechiae covering between 10% and 40% of skin. Severe rash was defi ned as petechiae or ecchymoses covering more than 40% of skin. Lymphopenia was defi ned as at least a 35% reduction in numbers of lymphocytes; and thrombocytopenia was defi ned as at least a 35% reduction in numbers of platelets. AST=aspartate aminotransferase. ALP=alkaline phosphatase. ALT=alanine aminotransferase. GGT=\u03b3 glutamyltransferase. BUN=blood urea nitrogen. *Not given any siRNAs. \u2020Given seven treatments with non-specifi c siRNAs. protected all animals. 11 Targeting only VP35 completely protected mice against ZEBOV challenge when the antisense oligomers were administered 24 h after ZEBOV exposure. 23 Targeting a combination of the L polymerase, VP24, and VP35 genes also completely protected mice and incompletely protected guineapigs when given 24 h after ZEBOV challenge. 24 Although RNA-interference-mediated treatment strategies show potential for combating EBOV infections, systemic administration of synthetically manufactured siRNA duplexes can activate the innate immune response, inducing high levels of infl ammatory cytokines such as tumour necrosis factor \u03b1, interleukin 6, and interferons, particularly interferon \u03b1 which might contribute to antiviral activity in vivo. [25] [26] [27] Off -target eff ects can be toxic to the host and also confound interpretation of preclinical data. siRNAs must therefore be modifi ed to prevent detrimental immune activation in vivo, particularly because immuno stimulation in human beings is much more toxic than in rodents. 14, 25 We therefore tested immune stimulatory activity of SNALPs containing anti-ZEBOV siRNAs in mice and in human PBMC cultures. The ZEBOV cocktail was not immune stimulatory at the limit of sensitivity of the assays used. These data and the 5\u0154ACE PCR data suggest that the antiviral eff ects in non-human primates are the result of specifi c RNA interference in reticuloendothelial cells and not due to immune stimulation or other off -target eff ects. Additionally, the death of the macaque given control Luc mod on day 10, which was within the normal range of expected time to death for historical untreated controls, also suggests that the ZEBOV-mediated protection was specifi c to the siRNAs and not related to off -target eff ects. When the immune toxicities associated with the siRNA component of SNALPs were abrogated through the use of selective chemical modifi cation, the major remaining toxicity in mouse and non-human primate models was hepatotoxicity associated with the SNALP lipid components (MacLachlan I, unpublished). Preliminary tolerability studies in mice showed that seven daily doses of up to 4\u00b73 mg/kg (30\u00b70 mg/kg cumulative) of SNALPs containing ZEBOV siRNAs were well tolerated, corroborating the lack of hepatotoxicity (measured as increases in liver enzymes such as alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase) in the treated macaques that survived infection.",

The rhesus macaque model that we used represents a worse-case scenario such as an accidental needle stick exposure of a laboratory worker or fi rst responder to a high infectious dose of ZEBOV, which has occurred several times during the past 5 years. [28] [29] [30] ZEBOV infection in human beings normally progresses slower than in macaques with case fatality rates in man ranging from 70-90%, 1 suggesting that the therapeutic window could be larger than in experimentally infected macaques. Nonetheless, the focus in future studies will need to be on investigation of whether anti-ZEBOV siRNAs will be benefi cial if administered at the onset of symptoms. Here, we show a substantial progress in the treatment of ZEBOV infections in non-human primates compared with previously described postexposure methods that aff orded only partial protection of non-human primates against ZEBOV. 19, 21, 22 To progress to license, studies will be done in guineapig and non-human primate models of ZEBOV infection in accordance with the US Food and Drug Administration's guidelines for the assessment of treatments for Centers for Disease Control and Prevention category A threats (number 21CFR314.610). Additionally, studies will need to be done to obtain data about pharmacology, dosing, and toxicology in uninfected non-human primates. Contributors TWG, ACHL, MR, AJ, LEH, and IM conceived and designed the experiments. TWG wrote the research programme plan and the animal protocol for the studies. LEH wrote modifi cations for the animal protocol. TWG and LEH selected the ZEBOV L polymerase as a target. TWG, ACHL, VS, MR, AJ, LEH, and IM selected ZEBOV VP24 and VP35 as targets. TWG co-designed the L polymerase siRNA, and ACHL and VS co-designed the VP24 and VP35 siRNAs. ACHL, VS, and AJ designed the modifi cations to the siRNAs. VS and ANH did the in vitro siRNA assays. JBG and JCJ did the Ebola challenge experiments in nonhuman primates and the clinical pathology assays. JBG did the Ebola virus infectivity assays. SDJ did the immunology and uptake assays.
