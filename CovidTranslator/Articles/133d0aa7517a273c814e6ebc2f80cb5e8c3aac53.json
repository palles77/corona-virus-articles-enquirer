Two types of bacteria (Serratia marcescens, Staphylococcus epidermidis) were aerosolized and released into a 9-m ventilation duct system. Inactivation efficiencies were calculated for inlet velocities from 2 to 6.5 m/s and for various ion intensities. The efficiencies for S. marcescens and S. epidermidis were 31.53% (SD, 11.4%) and 12.17% (SD, 0.43%), respectively, with susceptibility constants of 8.67 \u00d7 10 \u221211 Colony-Forming Units (CFU)/ions and 2.72 \u00d7 10 \u221211 CFU/ions, respectively. The modeling results matched those of the experiments well. The pressure penalty at the maximum velocity (6.5 m/s) was only 9 Pa. The results show that the use of negative ions has great potential to enhance indoor air quality by reducing airborne microorganisms in ventilation systems.",

[6] demonstrated the feasibility of the air ion disinfection approach for the reduction of aerosol particles in HVAC systems and found that this approach can be used to control IAQ. They showed that it is feasible to remove bioaerosols with a low-efficiency HVAC filter enhanced by continuous emission of unipolar air ions. Lee et al.

Mayya [16] developed a detailed mathematical model of air ions by considering the electric field, particle charging, ion transport, and wall loss. However, none of these studies modeled the disinfection of bacteria. In Ref. [17] , a semiempirical formula based on experiment results was applied to simulate the distribution of the bacteria Escherichia coli. However, the susceptibility constant was not measured; it was only determined by a trialand-error approach. To model airborne bacteria, an additional \"phase\" must be considered in which the bacteria can be treated as particles and modeled by either the Eulerian or Lagrangian approach [18] . Eulerian approach has been applied previously by the present authors and the others for modeling disinfection of bacteria [19, 20] , thus in this paper Eulerian approach was adopted.",

The plastic box was equipped with a HEPA filter to prevent contaminated air from entering the ducting from the laboratory. The fan speed was adjusted between 1.5 and 6.5 m/s with a switch. The bacteria were pushed throughout the 9-m-long ductwork. A negative ionizer (VI-2500, Wein Products Inc. Los Angeles) was used as the air ion source. An ion counter with a measuring range up to 1.99 \u00d7 10 8 ions/cc (Air Ion Counter, AlphaLab, Utah) was used to measure the emission concentration. The ion counter was placed inside the duct, and the ion intensity was output as voltage and recorded. Two single-stage viable Andersen cascade impactors (N6, Thermo Scientific) were used to sample the bacteria concentration upstream and downstream of the ionizer. The sampling points for collecting the bacteria were located 0.3 m before and 0.9 m after the ionizer (see Fig. 1 ).",

Even though the disinfection tests were conducted at varied inlet speeds, only the air velocity at 3 m/s was simulated in this study. The potential and the negative ion and bacteria concentrations were implemented into FLUENT and treated as user-defined scalars, UDS0, UDS1, and UDS2, respectively. The negative ionizer was modeled as a velocity inlet and it \"emitted\" negative ions into the duct system at a constant speed of 0.5 m/s. The ionizer generation rate was determined by the equation: I/ e, where I is the total ion current (A) [16] . The emission strength was obtained by experiment. The initial concentration of bacteria from the inlet was set to 1.0 (dimensionless). The airflow field was solved first, followed by the electrical field. The negative ion and bacteria transportation equations were converged when the residuals reached 10 \u22125 . The transient simulation was conducted with a time step of 0.1 s. The mesh type was hexa-structured and grid-independent tests were performed with: 1,043,260, 1,522,460 and 1,985,420 grid cells, by comparison the distribution of negative ions in the leeward of the ionizer (x = 0.1 m, y = 0.6-4.5 m, z = 0.07 m), the discrepancy for these three types of cell numbers was no more than 5%, thus we selected 1,043,260 grid cells for further calculation to save computational time and resources. The maximum y+ is 54.9, which is sufficient the requirement of y + for standard wall function. Fig. 3 shows the profile of negative ions with measured data along the central line of the ionizer when the inlet velocity was 3.0 m/s. The measured maximum ion concentration was 2.24 \u00d7 10 11 ions/m 3 . It was expected that the ion level would decrease dramatically with increasing downstream distance because of the high ion mobility, which would lead to significant loss to the duct wall. The negative ion distribution predicted by the present model agrees well with the experimental results. The discrepancy between the modeling and experiment can be attributed to the limitation of the negative ion counter and misalignment of the ion counter directly facing the negative ionizer. Fig. 4 shows the disinfection efficiency of S. epidermidis and S. marcescens at different inlet velocities. The inactivation of negative ions on bacteria performed better at lower inlet velocities. The highest effectiveness for bacteria removal was 16% for S. epidermidis and 30% for S. marcescens when the inlet velocity was 3.0 m/s. The disinfection efficiency decreased when the inlet velocity increased. For S. epidermidis, the disinfection efficiency gradually decreased to 9.5% and 7.7% when the inlet velocity was 5.0 m/s and 6.0 m/s, respectively. For S. marcescens, the disinfection effectiveness decreased to 17.1% at 4.0 m/s and 6.5 m/s. As the velocity increased, the dose (ion level multiplied by exposure time) received by the bacteria decreased, which reduced the disinfection efficiency. Fig. 5 shows the disinfection efficacy of S. marcescens and S. epidermidis for voltages of 12 V and 6 V. The negative ion intensity at the sampling point for the two voltages was 4.54 \u00d7 10 10 ions/m 3 for 12 V and 3.16 \u00d7 10 10 ions/m 3 for 6 V. In the case of S. marcescens, the disinfection efficacy decreased from 31.5% to 20.7% with a standard deviation of \u00b1 11%. For S. epidermidis, the disinfection efficacy decreased from 11.9% ( \u00b1 0.3%) to 5.8% ( \u00b1 3.5%). These results were used to determine the susceptibility constant for each microorganism.",

(9)), as shown in Fig. 7 . Compared to removal by disinfection, the effect of gravitational settling and wall deposition was only 0.02%, and thus these two effects could be ignored because the selected bacteria were only 1 \u03bcm in size. The measured disinfection efficiency depends on the constant susceptibility Z and the number of negative ions. The disinfection efficiency against S. marcescens was higher than that of S. epidermidis. The bacteria concentration was nearly zero downstream very close to the ionizer for two reasons: first, the bacteria distribution at the back of the ionizer was relatively low due to the effect of fluid flow around the cylindrical tube; and second, the largest number of negative ions occurred here, resulting in a distribution of bacteria near zero because the disinfection efficacy was assumed to increase linearly with negative ion concentration (when the velocity is the same). The disinfection efficiency decreased at distances far away from the ionizer because the number of negative ions decreased. The predicted concentration of bacteria (facet average at the sampling cut-plane) was 32.8% and 12.7% for S. epidermidis and S. marcescens, respectively, as compared to the experimental results, as shown in Table 2 .",

The fibrous filtration approach has been used since air conditioning systems were first introduced. It is of great interest to develop a non-filter-based solution for microorganisms. Inactivation of bacteria leads to harmless substances that pose no threat to humans. Air ions could be a potential approach, but such a method has not been studied systematically, even though the effect of negative ions on microorganisms has long been controversially disputed in many research areas [9, 30] . In this study, the distribution of negative ions and their effects on bacteria were numerically and experimentally investigated in ventilation ductwork. Gram-positive S. epidermidis (ATCC 12228) and Gramnegative S. marcescens (ATCC 6911) microorganisms were selected to conduct the disinfection experiment. The disinfection efficiency at different inlet velocities was studied, and it was found to range from 8% to 16% and from 17% to 31% for S. epidermidis and S. marcescens, respectively. The pressure drop \u0394P ranged from 1.84 Pa to 8.23 Pa, the ionizer inside the duct had a much lower pressure drop compared with HEPA filters.",

The Z value of a bacteria is a major factor in a particular microorganism's vulnerability to disinfection. This parameter must be determined experimentally.
