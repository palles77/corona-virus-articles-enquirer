            "text": "Anthrax is caused by the gram-positive bacillus, Bacillus anthracis. It is a ubiquitous spore-forming gram-positive bacterium that is found naturally in the soil worldwide. It is a disease of herbivores. Humans can contract 1 of 4 forms of the infection: cutaneous, inhalational, injectional, and gastrointestinal. 1,2 Of these forms, cutaneous is by far the most common and represents a majority of cases. 3 An intentional release of anthrax is expected to result in primarily inhalational cases. 1 Anthrax is not contagious from person to person and no special precautions are required. 4 Adalja Cutaneous anthrax is characterized by a painless black ulceration ( Fig. 1 ) that occurs on the site of exposure. Infection is more common in those exposed to animal products contaminated with spores, such as meat, drum skins, or wool. After an incubation period of approximately 7 days, the lesion characteristically begins as a papule and progresses to a black eschar. Diagnosis is often clinical, although culture, biopsy, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and serology confirm the diagnosis. Mortality is low if the disease is recognized and treated with appropriate antimicrobials. Treatment regimens include oral ciprofloxacin or doxycycline (although penicillin may be used if susceptibility is known) for 7 days. If exposure was through a biological attack, treatment duration is extended to 60 days to cover incubating spores that may have been inhaled. Injectional anthrax has been exclusively linked to use of contaminated illicit drugs whereas gastrointestinal anthrax is due to ingestion of contaminated food. 3, 4 Inhalational anthrax is the deadliest form of anthrax and occurs on inhalation of as little as 1 spore. Anthrax was historically known as wool sorter's disease because of its linkage with the occupation of wool sorting, in which spores on sheep's wool became aerosolized. The disease is characterized not by pneumonia but by mediastinal widening (Fig. 2 ) that can progress rapidly to shock. Toxin-laden pleural effusions may be present. The disease begins after a week-long incubation period and is typically biphasic with flulike symptoms (with the notable exception of rhinorrhea) occurring before a terminal phase. When anthrax of any form progresses, the grave complication of hemorrhagic meningitis can occur. 3 The treatment of systemic anthrax syndromes (inhalational, gastrointestinal, and injectional) involves first ruling out the presence or absence of meningitis via a lumbar puncture. If meningitis is confirmed or cannot be ruled out, the treatment regimen should include 3 central nervous system penetrating drugs, 1 of which should be a protein synthesis inhibitor (eg, linezolid) and 1 of which should be bactericidal (eg, meropenem). The third drug could be ciprofloxacin. If meningitis has been ruled out, ciprofloxacin and clindamycin or linezolid could be used for treatment (with deescalation of ciprofloxacin to penicillin once drug susceptibility is known). Treatment is for 2 weeks to 3 weeks. 5 Adjunctive antibody therapies, available from the CDC, such as anthrax immune globulin, raxibacumab, and obiltoxaximab, also should be given. 5 Additionally, if present, pleural effusions, pericardial effusions, and ascites should be drained, a factor that has likely improved survival rates from inhalational anthrax in the modern era. 6 Postexposure prophylaxis, for those exposed to anthrax spores, includes both an abbreviated 3-dose regimen of the vaccine coupled with 60 days of oral ciprofloxacin or doxycycline (antibody therapies can be used in this manner when no other prophylaxis method can be used). 3 In a mass event the post-exposure prophylaxis regimen for adults can be shortened to 42 days after the first vaccine dose or 2 weeks after the last vaccine dose, which ever comes later.",

            "text": "Plague is caused by the gram-negative bacillus Yesinia pestis and is endemic in many parts of the world, including the Western United States. This zoonotic infection is naturally spread from rodents, such as prairie dogs, to humans via the bite of a flea. There are 3 forms of plague: bubonic (the most common), pneumonic, and septicemic. If used as a bioweapon, plague is expected to present in its pneumonic form. 7 Bubonic plague is characterized by marked painful lymphadenopathy (Fig. 3 ) that develops after a 2-day to 6-day incubation period whereas pneumonic plague (Fig. 4 ) may be indistinguishable from ordinary community-acquired pneumonia but has a mortality rate that can reach 50%. Pneumonic plague has a 1-day to 3-day incubation period. Pneumonic plague is transmissible from person to person through respiratory droplets and requires patients be placed in droplet isolation. 3, 7 Diagnosis of pneumonic plague in an intentional attack requires a high index of suspicion and can be made through PCR, serology, and/or culture. 3, 7 The treatment of plague is with aminoglycoside antibiotics, such as gentamicin or streptomycin, for 7 days to 10 days, whereas postexposure prophylaxis of those exposed to an aerosol in a bioweapon attack consists of oral ciprofloxacin or doxycycline. 3, 7 Tularemia Tularemia is caused by the gram-negative bacillus Francisella tularenesis and is naturally a zoonotic infection that is common in many parts of the United States. Naturally, tularemia may occur through tick, fly, and mosquito bites or through contact with reservoir animals (eg, rabbits). Contaminated uncooked food or water can also be a vehicle for spread. The most common presentation of tularemia is the ulceroglandular cutaneous form whereas a biologic attack likely results in pneumonic tularemia. Tularemia is not contagious between humans. 8 Tularemia is notable for its low infectious dose in which inhalation of just a small number of bacilli can result in disease. Because of this, it is important to notify laboratory personnel about the possibility of tularemia, so they are able to don appropriate personal protective equipment when working with clinical specimens. 3 Pneumonic tularemia occurs after a 3-day to 5-day incubation period and is essentially indistinguishable from community-acquired pneumonia. Even physicians who live in endemic areas often miss the diagnosis of tularemia in its various form, highlighting the need for tularemia to be in the differential diagnosis of compatible syndromes in endemic areas. 9 Temperature-pulse disassociation may be present and can serve as a clue to diagnosis. 8 The treatment of tularemia is aminoglycoside antibiotics, such as gentamicin or streptomycin, for 7 days to 10 days. Postexposure prophylaxis, to those exposed to an aerosol in a biological weapons attack, is with oral doxycycline or ciprofloxacin. 3, 8 Botulism Botulism is caused by the acetylcholine release-blocking neurotoxin released by Clostridium botulinum, a ubiquitous spore-forming gram-positive rod. There are several forms of naturally occurring botulism: infant, wound, and gastrointestinal. These forms result from exposure to spores of the bacteria, which then germinate and elaborate toxin. In a biological attack, inhalational botulism is expected, and it manifests similar to gastrointestinal botulism. Botulism is not contagious. 3, 10 After 12 hours to 36 hours postexposure to spores, clinical botulism occurs. It is characterized by a symmetric, flaccid, descending paralysis without sensory symptoms. Patients are afebrile and not tachycardic. Cranial neuropathies are common. Paralysis progresses to involve respiratory muscles and can be prolonged, requiring long durations of mechanical ventilation. Diagnosis is largely clinical. Confirmatory mouse bioassay testing is used to determine which of the several botulinum toxinotypes is responsible. 3, 10 Heptavalent antitoxin, which neutralizes toxinotypes A to G, is obtainable from the CDC and can neutralize toxin. Antibiotics and BabyBIG (California Department of Public Health, a bivalent botulinum antitoxin used in infant botulism) are not indicated. 3, 10 There was controversy over the existence of an eighth toxinotype (H) but it has been shown to be a hybrid toxin and is neutralized by A-type antitoxin. 11 More recently, a toxinotype X has been described and is unable to be neutralized by any available antitoxin. 12 ",

Fomites are also known to spread the virus. 3, 13 The clinical presentation of smallpox begins with flulike symptoms after a 14-day incubation period which is followed by the characteristic rash. The rash begins in a papular form and then progresses to umbilicated lesions and finally to pustules that crust and scab. A person with smallpox is contagious only from the appearance of the rash until the rash is scabbed, a key factor that led to its control. 3, 13 The rash of smallpox (Fig. 5 ) must be distinguished from similar rashes that can be seen with varicella. Several points of distinction are important. The rash of smallpox is centrifugal with more lesions on the face and extremities while the varicella rash is centripetal. The lesions of the smallpox rash are all at identical stages with identical appearances whereas the rash of varicella may have lesions of different stages. The case fatality rate of smallpox was historically 25%. 3, 13 A diagnosis of smallpox would be a national security emergency of the highest order because even 1 case represents either a laboratory accident or a biological attack. Because smallpox vaccination is no longer routine, there is a sizable amount of the world population that lacks immunity. Any suspicion of smallpox should prompt infectious disease consultation, airborne isolation procedures, and notification of local, state, and national public health authorities.

Disease can rapidly progress to shock and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome with disseminated intravascular coagulation and hemorrhagic manifestations. 18 Diagnosis can be made using molecular tests, but a high index of suspicion is needed to differentiate these infections from ordinary septic shock. In the ED patient, travel to endemic areas, exotic animal exposure, or laboratory work with VHFs might be the only clue to the etiology. In a biological attack, a cluster of patients with similar symptoms may present to several EDs in a given region. Any suspicion of a VHF should prompt immediate consultation with an infectious disease physician and state and local health authorities. 18 Although these viruses are spread via blood and body fluid exposure and do not spread between humans via the airborne route, the experience of the United States during the 2014 West Africa Ebola outbreak has influenced infection control recommendations. The 2 nosocomial infections at a hospital in Texas have led to recommendations for strict airborne and body fluid isolation for patients suspected of having a VHF, with transfer to definitive care at specialized units for confirmed cases. 19 Treatment is generally supportive and has proved life-saving in the case of Ebola. The recent experience with Ebola highlighted the fact that simple supportive care with fluids and electrolytes brought fatality rates down from 90% to less than 40%. 20 There are several experimental treatments and vaccines (which can be used for postexposure prophylaxis) that are available for filovirus infections and arenavirus infections that would likely be used in any domestic VHF cases caused by these groups of viruses. 21 For Ebola exposures, the experimental vaccine would be indicated for postexposure prophylaxis whereas a combination of experimental antiviral agents (eg, favipiravir) and antibody-based therapies, such as ZMapp, might be indicated after consultation with CDC. Lassa fever can be treated with intravenous ribavirin, which is available via CDC.",

Additionally, local transmission of dengue fever has occurred in Florida, Texas, Hawaii, and New York. 25, 26 Chikungunya, dengue fever, and Zika are all spread by the Aedes species of mosquitoes, which have habitats both within and outside the United States and cause clinically indistinguishable syndromes. These syndromes all involve fevers, rash, myalgias, and arthralgias. Conjunctivitis has been noted with Zika. Prolonged debilitating arthralgias can occur with chikungunya whereas severe illness, including shock and hemorrhagic manifestations, can occur with dengue fever (especially with repeat infection with disparate strains). 27, 28 Zika has been linked to Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome and requires special counseling regarding sexual transmission and pregnancy given its ability to cause a devastating congenital syndrome. 29, 30 Travel history and residence in an endemic area (eg, Key West, Hawaii, and Texas) are important elements of the history. Diagnostic testing is commercially available for each infection.",
