            "text": "Since the discovery of HIV-1 proteinase in the mid-1980s, this enzyme probably has become the bestcharacterized peptidase, with several hundreds of crystal structures of inhibitor complexes determined to date. However, the main proteinase of SARS coronavirus (M pro , also called 3CL pro ) has a good chance to catch up. When the first three-dimensional structure of a coronavirus M pro was published in 2002, that of the enzyme from transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) [2] , interest in the coronaviridae was only moderate, since these viruses were considered relatively harmless to human health. This assessment changed dramatically in late March, 2003, when it was found that the ongoing global outbreak of the highly infectious severe acute respiratory syndrome was caused by a new coronavirus, subsequently named SARS-CoV. Since then, efforts to discover anti-SARS drugs have been numerous, in order to be prepared should the virus raise its ugly head again.",

            "text": "Coronavirus genomes code for two large polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab, that are processed by viral proteinases to yield the individual components of the large replicase complex. Most coronaviruses have three cysteine proteinases that are responsible for this processing: two papain-like proteinases and the main proteinase, M pro . Interestingly, one of the two papain-like proteinases is absent in the SARS coronavirus, and the other one has been shown to have the additional function of a deubiquitinating enzyme [3, 4] . While the papain-like proteinases together are only responsible for three cleavage reactions near the N terminus of the polyproteins, the M pro cleaves these huge substrates (molecular masses of 450-750 kDa) at no less than 11 sites. Since this reaction is essential for viral replication, the main proteinase is obviously a prime target for interference by inhibitors [5] .",

            "text": "The new contribution from the same group, presented in this issue [1] , originated from an attempt to improve the inhibitory properties of lopinavir. The authors assembled a library of lopinavir-like compounds by coupling an amine or a 1,4-diamine with various acids in microtiter plates, followed by screening in situ. O-(Benzotriazol-1yl)-N,N,N',N'-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate (HBTU) was used as a coupling reagent. Several lopinavir derivatives showed somewhat improved binding affinities, but it came as a big surprise that some of the intermediate benzotriazole esters resulting from the activation of the acid components by HBTU were nanomolar inhibitors of the M pro ! Thus, we have the remarkable case here of a reaction intermediate being a highly active inhibitor of a target enzyme. Next, the authors synthesized a series of benzotriazole esters ( Figure 1F ) by condensation of HBTU with various aromatic carboxylic acids and found that compounds carrying electron-donating substituents were strong irreversible inhibitors of the M pro , with a K i of 21.0 nM for the best derivative. Using mass spectrometry, Wu et al. showed that the compounds acted by acylating the catalytic cysteine residue of the M pro . Further, they also demonstrated that the benzotriazole derivatives were non-toxic to Vero E6 cells, the standard cells used in anti-SARS-CoV assays, at a concentration of 100 mM [1] .",

In their paper, Wu et al. [1] also describe benzotriazole ester surrogates that have the ester oxygen replaced by a methylene group and are thus not susceptible to nucleophilic attack by the active site cysteine. Some of these compounds (such as 14, 17, and 18; see Scheme 3 of Wu et al. [1] ) are competitive inhibitors with K i values in the lower micromolar range and are thus among the most potent noncovalent inhibitors of the SARS-CoV M pro described to date. The discovery of compounds binding noncovalently to the M pro may, in the end, constitute a more important milestone on the way to clinically useful inhibitors of the coronavirus main proteinase than identification of the acylating agents.
