            "text": "Masks and respirators are commonly used in healthcare settings to protect hospital healthcare workers (HCW) from respiratory infections (Siegel et al., 2007; World Health Organization (WHO), 2014a) . Masks are used to prevent HCWs acquiring infections from splashes of blood and body fluid and to reduce the transfer of potentially infectious body fluids in the sterile area. They are also used by coughing patients to try and prevent the spread of infections (Siegel et al., 2007;  Institute of Medicine (IOM) National Academy of Sciences, 2010). However, masks were not designed to provide respiratory protection, as they have consistently lower filtration efficiency than respirators (Balazy et al., 2006; Lawrence et al., 2006) . In comparison, a respirator is a fitted device that protects the wearer against the inhalation of small and large airborne particles, that is, it protects the wearer from others who are or might be infected (Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). U.S. Department of Labor, 2009) . Respirators are generally considered to be superior to surgical or cloth masks (MacIntyre et al., , 2013 van der Sande et al., 2008) , but there is some evidence that both surgical masks and respirators are effective against respiratory infections (Seto et al., 2003; Loeb et al., 2009) . The efficacy of both is still being debated in the literature. Although, previous observational and experimental studies have reported that masks and respirators may protect HCWs from respiratory infections (Gamage et al., 2005; Gralton and McLaws, 2010; MacIntyre et al., 2011 MacIntyre et al., , 2013 , there is very little high quality clinical evidence to determine their efficacy (Cowling et al., 2010; Bin-Reza et al., 2012) .",

Newly emerging infections have increased in recent years, resulting in morbidity, mortality and an increase in associated costs. SARS was selected as an example of an emerging infectious disease.

In an ideal setting, the selection of an appropriate type of respiratory protection should depend on the mode of disease transmission. Droplet and contact is considered the primary mode of transmission for influenza (Brankston et al., 2007; CDC, 2014a) and SARS (CDC, 2004) , and therefore surgical masks may be sufficient to protect HCWs during routine care. However studies have shown that the risk from infections increases during 'high-risk situations', for example, when undertaking tracheal intubation, bronchoscopy, non-invasive ventilation and other aerosol generating procedures (Tran et al., 2012; Thompson et al., 2013; Macintyre et al., 2014) . The risk is primarily due to increased production of respiratory aerosols during these procedures, which might contain more viruses (Milton et al., 2013) . In addition some diseases, like TB, exclusively transmit through respiratory aerosols (Riley et al.; 1995 , Siegel et al., 2007 . Respirators should be preferred when there is a risk of aerosol transmission as they are designed for respiratory protection and are more effective than surgical and cloth masks (van der Sande et al., 2008; MacIntyre et al., 2011 MacIntyre et al., , 2013 .",

This probably explains some of the differences identified in this present study. However it does not explain all of the choices being made. For example, paper and cloth masks are not recommended by the WHO and the CDC but were listed in the policies from all three countries. Although the efficacy of cloth masks is not proven yet and their role in prevention of infections is uncertain (Institute of Medicine (IOM) National Academy of Sciences, 2006), cloth masks may be the only option available to HCWs in some situations due to resource and financial limitations. For example, cloth masks were commonly used in China and Vietnam (Le et al., 2004) during the SARS outbreak in 2002-03. There is a clear gap in the cloth masks research and very few studies have been conducted to test the efficacy of cloth masks since the development of surgical masks in the middle of the 20th century (Chughtai et al., 2013b) . There is a need to conduct further research on cloth masks, given that some countries will continue to depend on them, which focuses on improving the design and material.",

Regulations over the use of respirators exist in most high income countries. For example, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) regulates the testing and certification of respiratory protection equipment in the US. The NIOSH tests filters for the effects of loading, particle burden, temperature, and relative humidity and requires a minimum filtration efficiency of 95%, 99% or 100% (Institute of Medicine (IOM) National Academy of Sciences, 2010). In Europe, the European Norm (EN) standards are followed for testing respirators. The respirators are required to be marked with 'Conformit\u00e9 Europ\u00e9en' (CE), which means that the respirator meets the criteria of the EN certification. In Australia, the AS/ NZS 1716 standard regulates the respirator use (Standards Australia Limited/Standards New Zealand, 2012) .

Decontamination of masks and filtering piece respirators is usually not feasible because the materials of these masks are likely to degrade with standard means of disinfection, for example boiling, chemicals, heat and radiation (IOM National Academy of Sciences, 2006) .

During the SARS outbreaks, Health Canada advised hospital staff to use their masks and respirators for an extended period if their patient was SARS negative (Health Canada, 2003) . WHO advises HCWs to use respirators for extended period for TB protection, if they are properly stored (WHO, 1999) .The CDC recommends that extended use and reuse should be balanced against the risk of infections and extended use is preferred over reuse if required (CDC, 2014b) . Further studies should be conducted to examine the effectiveness of masks being used for an extended period and to test the effectiveness of various decontamination methods. The number of virus particles isolated, the length of virus survival, effect on mask material and HCWs' compliance are important factors to consider while recommending mask reuse (IOM National Academy of Sciences, 2006; CDC, 2014b) .",

In addition, there was a chance of recall bias due to the time of guideline development. A few of the guidelines were developed before 2003 and participants may not be able to recall some of the recommendations.

The guidelines are not up to date and reuse is not discussed in most of the guidelines. There is a need to examine available evidence and develop a comprehensive policy on the use of masks and respirators in various respiratory infections. The policy should address critical areas, like regulation, training and fit testing. A mechanism should be developed to monitor the process of guideline implementation.",
