The regression analysis indicated that among the macroeconomic variables (i.e., money supply, the growth rate of industrial production, expected inflation, the change of unemployment rate, and the yield spread), only money supply and the unemployment rate significantly explained the movement of hotel stock returns. On the other hand, all nonmacroeconomic forces selected (i.e., presidential elections, the 921 earthquake, the 2003 Iraqi war, the outbreak of SARS, sports mega-events, the Asian financial crisis, and the 911 terrorist attacks) had significant influences on the hotel stock returns. The empirical results of this study may be used as valuable information for local and global stock investors who seek an investment opportunity in the hospitality industry. r",

            "text": "Numerous studies have been conducted to identify the determinants of stock price movements. According to the study of Chen et al. (1986) , three macroeconomic variables, interest rates, inflation, and industrial production, should be systematic predictors of stock market returns. Wasserfallen (1989) investigated the effects of macroeconomic variables on stock price indices for the UK, Germany, and Switzerland. Evidence was found that stock returns were positively related to real activity. A higher economic activity increases the expected profits of firms, thereby boosting stock price movements positively. Gross national product, industrial production, real consumption, real investment, the unemployment rate, and real wages are widely used to measure economic activity. On the other hand, inflation was inversely related to stock returns. Consumer price index and nominal wage index are generally used to measure inflation. The negative effect of interest rates on stock returns was expected and his regression result confirmed the inverse relationship. Although he found the significant effects of inflation and interest rates on stock returns, the overall explanatory power of these macroeconomic variables in the model was small. Asprem (1989) also examined the relationship between macroeconomic variables and stock prices in European countries. Real economic activity (industrial production and exports), money, and the US yield curve were positively correlated to stock prices, whereas employment, imports, inflation, and interest rates had a negative relationship with changes in stock prices. The relationships between stock returns and real activity, inflation, and the money supply are well documented by Fama (1981) . He asserted that a negative association between stock returns and inflation and a positive association between stocks and real activity are natural consequences of an inverse relationship between inflation and real economic activity. He added that an increase in real activity, which drives stock returns, stimulates the demand for money through the simple quantity theory model; this creates a positive relationship between money supply and stock returns. Bulmash and Trivoli (1991) developed a business cycle model to explain the linkage between key economic variables and stock prices. They identified the aggregate variables that were related to stock prices: gross national product, inflation (consumer price index), money supply (M1 and M2), interest rates (T-bill and T-bond rates), and the unemployment rate. They found that interest rates influenced stock prices negatively because higher interest rates attracted another investment option, causing stock prices to decrease. When interest rates fall, investors tend to switch from long-term bonds to stocks. Thus, decreases in interest rates cause increases in stock prices from the perspective of asset portfolio allocation (Abdullah and Hayworth, 1993) . Abdullah and Hayworth (1993) are another team of scholars that examined the influence of macroeconomic variables on stock price fluctuations. The variables selected were money growth, inflation rate, short-term and long-term interest rates, budget deficits, trade deficits, and industrial production growth. They found that stock returns have positive relationships with money growth and inflation rate, and negative relationships with budget deficits, trade deficits, and both long-term and short-term interest rates. Booth and Booth (1997) investigated the influence of monetary policy on security returns. The authors expected monetary policy to influence economic activity and security returns because a number of previous studies suggested a positive relationship between monetary policy and stock returns (Rozeff, 1984; Campbell, 1987; Kaul, 1987) . They confirmed the theory that an expansionary monetary policy increases returns of stocks and bonds.",

Five macroeconomic variables were hypothesized to have relationships with stock returns: expected inflation rate, money supply, domestic consumption, term structure of the interest rate, and industrial production. Three of the five variables were significant: inflation, money supply, and domestic consumption.

The only state legislation event that negatively affected the stock value of the large gaming firms was the November 8, 1994 voting event where Florida residents overwhelmingly refused to legalize casino gaming.

The monthly IP is often utilized as a proxy for income. Rapidly growing IP indicates an expanding economy with ample opportunity for a firm to increase sales. Second, in a similar manner, the growth rate of money supply (DM2) was calculated in terms of the difference in natural log using M2. DM2 represents the monetary policy. Expansionary monetary policy or increases in M2 stimulates the economy. Third, the growth of CPI is the rate at which the general level of prices is rising. High inflation rates are frequently associated with overheated economies (i.e., where the demand for goods and services is surpassing productive capacity) and consequently lead to an upward pressure on price. Following Barrows and Naka (1994) , we estimated the expected inflation (EINF) based on the moving averages as in Chen et al. (1986) and Chen (1991) . Fourth, the change in the unemployment rate (DUEP) was derived as the difference of UEP. The unemployment rate measures the extent to which the economy is operating at full capacity and provides an insight into the strength of the economy.",

Of all five macroeconomic variables, DIP and DM2 affected hotel returns positively while EINF, D and SPD impacted hotel returns negatively. Among variables, only DM2 (po0:01) and D (po0:1) significantly explained the hotel returns. This is consistent with the results of the correlation matrix, which showed relatively higher correlations between the hotel stock return and the two variables (see Table 2 ). The overall explanatory power (adjusted R 2 value) of macroeconomic forces on the hotel return was 8%. This result is very similar to the study of Barrows and Naka (1994) , who reported that the explanatory power of macroeconomic variables on restaurant and lodging returns was 12% and 8%, respectively. Note that the estimator b is efficient only under normality assumption. The diagnostic checks on regression residuals were performed. The Jarque and Bera (1980) normality test indicated that residuals are normally distributed (see Fig. 2 ). The Ljung-Box Q-statistics for residuals showed no significant sample autocorrelations (see Fig. 2 ), which was also evidenced by the Durbin-Watson (DW) statistics in Table 4 .

Returns were most seriously hurt by the SARS outbreak followed by the earthquake and the 911 terrorist attacks.

Our speculation is Taiwan was not one of the major Asian countries that initiated and seriously experienced the financial crisis. Goldstein (1998) pointed out that the overall economy and the stock market in Taiwan were least hit by the financial crisis among five Asian countries, including Hong Kong, Korea, Malaysia, Thailand, and Taiwan. Secondly, although the economic downturn discourages public travel in general, business travelers would still travel around within a limited budget and some of the leisure travelers could take it as an opportunity to travel domestically or internationally at a lower price. The above grounds may explain the reason why the negative effect of the Asian financial crisis was relatively weaker than other factors.",

The impacts of natural disasters and the terrorist attacks on the tourism industry have been well documented (Barton, 1994; Durocher, 1994; Sonmez et al. 1999; Stafford et al. 2002) . This study evidenced the powerful relationship between stock returns and non-macroeconomic forces, which, in particular, threaten traveler's safety. Investors who are interested in hospitality stocks should be alert to these forces prior to making any purchase decisions.",

Oddly enough, the tourism industry portfolio was not one of the beneficiaries. During the actual game period, tourism stocks did not gain any positive returns either (Chen, 2002) . Hospitality finance researchers should utilize upcoming international sports events such as the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympics and the 2010 Vancouver Winter Olympics to answer the following possible research questions: (1) the host country's hospitality stock reactions to the games, (2) the effects on the neighboring country's hospitality stocks, and (3) comparison studies on hospitality stock reactions based on the economic development of host countries-For example, it may be hypothesized that China's hospitality stocks will react more significantly than Canada's hospitality stocks.",
