            "text": "Wasting\" or \"fading\" syndromes are common causes of death in both puppies and kittens. These poorly defined syndromes are generally characterized by anorexia, lethargy, and emaciation during the first few weeks of life and often lead to death with no apparent cause. The terms \"wasting\" and \"fading\" describe this general syndrome and will be used interchangeably throughout this article. The fading syndrome can cause major problems in breeding colonies, especially if inbreeding has occurred. 11 Many possible causes have been suggested, including viral infections, bacterial septicemias, nutritional inadequacies, toxins, and environmental factors. 6 \u2022 7 \u2022 11 \u2022 27 \u2022 28 \u2022 31 \u00b733. 4 0-4 2 \u2022 44 Several of these factors are probably capable of causing neonatal wasting and death and should be considered in a differential diagnosis. Infectious canine hepatitis virus and beta-hemolyt!c streptococcus infection in puppies 7 \u2022 28 \u2022 44 and feline infectious peritonitis infection in kittens 6 \u2022 27 \u00b7 31 \u2022 33 \u2022 40 \u00b7 41 have been strongly implicated as causes of fading and death iii some cases. However, several authors have reported that infectious agents could not be isolated from a large proportion of puppies and kittens that fade and die, and that lesions severe enough to cause death could not be.found. 6 \u2022 7 \u2022 11 \u2022 20 \u2022 33 \u2022 42 Therefore, the cause of the fading syndrome remains a mystery in most cases. The status of the thymus gland has not received adequate attention in diagnosis and therapy of wasting syndromes of puppies and kittens. In some species, neonatal thymectomy results in a fatal wasting syndrome 17 \u2022 29 that can be prevented by soluble factors from the thymus. 25 \u2022 32 This article will focus on the role of the thymus gland in maintaining the health of young animals and on how thymus dysfunction may contribute to some cases of wasting and death.

The authors of the report indicated that most breeders commonly complained of fading kittens. In some cases, the kittens born emaciated and weak died within 1 or 2 days. In other cases, the kittens appeared healthy for a few days or weeks, then became depressed and anorectic and gradually faded. Specific clinical signs or lesions were usually absent, except for evidence of emaciation and malnutrition. Several of the catteries reported kitten losses that were diagnosed clinically or histologically as feline infectious peritonitis (FIP).",

Reports of the effects of thymectomy in the kitten were not found ; however, a number of investigators have reported the effects of thymectomy in the puppy. Dennis and coworkers reported that dogs thymectomized as 48-day-old fetuses had defective humoral and cell-mediated immune responses but normal lymphoid tissue development and did not show signs of a wasting disease. 8 Other authors reported that neonatally thymectomized dogs had a normal humoral response, no imp~irment of allograft rejection, and no signs of wasting disease.10\u00b749 In contrast, Than and colleagues 46 observed prolonged survival of sk~n grafts in dogs thymectomized at 1 month of age (an indication of defective immune function). Tilney and colleagues demonstrated that all 18 puppies thymectomized at 3 to 6 weeks of age died of a typical wasting syndrome, whereas only 1 of 9 puppies thymectomized between 10 to 12 weeks of age died of a wastipg syndrome. 47 Shl).m-thymectorqb:ed littermates of these puppies did not develop a wasting syndrome. It is diffi~ult to draw firm conclusions from these reports regarding the importance of the thymus in the prevention of wasting syndromes because in puppies there were differences in surgical procedures, age of animal at thymectomy, breed of dog, indigenous infectious agents, and other factors. If one assumes that the thymectomies were complete in all cases, the most obvious difference would be in the age of the dog at thymectomy. Puppies thymectomized in utero, as neonates, or at 10 to 12 weeks of age did not develop the wasting syndrome, whereas puppies thymectomized at 3 to 6 weeks of age uniformly died of a wasting disease. It seems illogical that removal of the thymus at 3 to 6 weeks of age would result in wasting when re.moval at birth or at 10 to 12 weeks of age did not. Nevertheless, this possibility should not be dismissed.",

Mice that are thymectomized at birth are immunodeficient and die of a wasting syndrome. 17 \u2022 29 Shortly after this discovery, it was observed that implantation of thymus tissue inside of a cell-impermeable chamber into a thymectomi:z;ed mouse would improve immune function and prevent death due to wasting. 25 \u2022 32 It was concluded that the thymus was functioning~~ an endocrine gland, releasing a hormone (or hormones) that diffused out ()f the chamber, enhancing immune function, and preventing wasting. These resuits stimulated the search for thymus hormones. A number of thymus hormones have now been isolated and identified, and more will probably be found. The nature, function , and potential clinical applications of these hormones have recently been reviewed. 12 \u00b7 16 \u2022 21 \u2022 26 Thymosins One of the first thymus hormones to be described was isolated from a calf thymus and was termed \"thymosin. \" 14 \u2022 26 A semipurified form of this hormone has been termed thymosin fraction 5 and has been shown to contain more than 30 peptides. Several of these peptides have biologic activity. Thymosin alpha 1 was the first peptide isolated from thymosin fraction 5. It consists of28 amino acid residues and has a molecular weight of3108 daltons. Thymosin alpha 1 is 10 to 1000 times more active than thymosin fraction 5 in several in vivo and in vitro bioassays. It is also a potent inducer of h~lper T lymphocytes. Thymosin alpha 7 is a partially purified extract of thymosin fraction 5 that induces the development of suppressor T lymphocytes. Over 100 children have received thymosin fraction 5 for a variety of primary immunodeficiency diseases. These patients were treated with injections of up to 400 mg per m 2 of thymosin fraction 5, usually daily for 2 to 4 weeks, then once per week for an indefinite period (some patients were maintained for over 6 years). No evidence of serious toxicity due to thymosin was reported for these patients. Some forms of primary immunodeficiency had a positive clinical response to the thymosin fraction 5 therapy. At least six human patients with autoimmune conditions (five with systemic lupus and one with rheumatoid arthritis) have been treated with thymosin fraction 5 in phase-I protocols. Based on the lack of toxicity and positive immunologic responses, phase-11 randomized trials in systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis have been initiated. 26 More than 200 patients with cancer have been treated according to phase-1 and phase-11 protocols. No major side effects of thymosin therapy were observed in the majority of these patients. A significantly prolonged survival was noted for patients with nonresectable small cell carcinoma of the lungs when given thymosin fraction 5 in conjunction with intensive chemotherapy. 26 Thymopoietin Although thymopoietin is a protein hormone that was also isolated from the bovine thymus, it is different than thymosin fraction 5. 15 It contains 49 amino acids and exists in 2 forms that differ by 2 amino acids. A sequence of five amino acids within the thymopoietin molecule has the same biologic activity as the whole molecule and is termed \"thymopoietin pentapeptide\" or \"thymopentin.\" Thymopentin has been used in over 386 people for several conditions, including herpesvirus infection, acute burns, leprosy, rheumatoid arthritis, pyoderma, selective lgA deficiency, and trichophyton infections. 45 Positive clinical responses were observed in some of these conditions. Acute, subacute, and chronic toxicity studies with thymopentin have been performed in various species (including dogs). The drug was found to be safe and devoid of major side effects. 12 The dosage and route of administration are quite important for obtaining a positive response with thymopentin.",

The active form of the hormone containing zinc is called thymulin. A deficiency of zinc in the diet results in a deficiency of thymulin activity in the serum. 22 Thymulin has been used to treat a limited number of patients in the course of a phase-I clinical trial. No signs of toxicity were observed, confirming earlier results of animal trials. Normalization of deficient T-cell numbers or functions was observed in a number of cases (immunodeficiency syndromes, viral infections). Thymulin treatment induced the appearance of lgA in the serum of children presenting with lgA deficiency with T-cell deficiencies. 2 ",

In early experiments examining this possibility, Pierpaoli and Sorkin 34 were able to show that a single inoculation (intraperitoneally) of rabbit antimouse hypophysis serum into a normal mouse produced inhibition of growth, involution of the thymus gland, and a wasting syndrome similar to that observed after neonatal thymectomy. The effect of the antihypophysis serum was age-dependent. The serum most effectively induced a wasting syndrome at the age when the same strain of mice, if they had been thymectomized as neonates, would have developed the disease. Pierpaoli and Sorkin obtained similar results by injecting several doses of a rabbit antibovine growth hormone. Body growth was inhibited and a wasting syndrome was observed. The depletion of thymocytes in the cortex reduced the size of the thymus. The thymus-dependent areas of the spleen also were reduced or absent.",

Before growth hormone treatment, the glands of the 13-to 14-week-old dogs were characterized by severe cortical depletion of lymphocytes; the cortex was recognizable in some areas only as a thin rim oflymphocytes at the periphery of the lobule (see Fig. 2 ). Interlobular septae were increased in width and were infiltrated with a moderate amount of adipose tissue. The number of thymic corpuscles was about three to five per lobule, which was considered low for dogs of this age. After growth hormone treatment, the most obvious change was the normalized cortex to medullary ratio of approximately 1: 1 (Fig. 3) . The interlobular septae were now mostly of the normal, narrow configuration, although a minimal amount of adipose tissue remained in the septae. The number of thymic corpuscles remained below the norm for dogs of 11 to 20 weeks, averaging only four to six per lobule.",

            "text": "\"Wasting\" or \"fading\" syndromes are common causes of puppy and kitten mortality. Numerous infectious and toxic, metabolic, or nutritional factors could potentially be responsible for wasting and death in young animals. Evidence has . been presented that infectious canine hepatitis virus infection, beta-hemolytic streptOCOCCUS infection, and feline infectiOl!S peritonitis virus infection are responsible for a significant number of deaths due to wasting syndrome. However, many cases of wasting syndrome cannot be attributed to infectious agents or other specific etiologies. The thymus gland warrants special attention when one is evaluating an animal with a wasting syndrome because it is known that, in some species, neonatal thymectomy results in wastin~ and death. Unfortunately, most reports describing fading syndromes in puppies and kittens do not mention the gross or histologic appearaqce of the thymus gland at postmortem examination. When examining the thymus gland, one must keep irt mind that the thymus may be hypoplastic owing to a congenital or genetic defect in its structure and function or it may be atrophic secondary to whatever is causing the fading syndrome. If a thorough history, clinical examination, and/or postmortem examination do not reveal a cause for the fading syndrome, then defective thymus function should be considered as a possible causative or contributing factor to the fading syndrome. In these cases, therapy designed to replace or improve the defective thymus function should be considered. At least one form of wasting syndrome ih puppies (immunodeficient dwarfism) has been found to respond to short-term therapy with a thymus hormone (thymosin fraction 5) or with bovine growth hormone (which is thymotrophic) in limited clinical trials. It is possible that other forms of wasting or fading syndromes would also respond to th,~rapy with thymus hormone or growth hormone. Certain thymus hormones (thymopoietin pentapeptide, thymosin alpha 1, factt:ur thymique serique, and rabbit thymus acetone powder*) and bovine growth hormonet are commercially available. Before initiating therapy, one should consider that if the cau~~ of the wasting syndrome is genetic, then successful treatment may perpetuate a genetic defect. More research (both basic and clinical) is needed to determine the role of thymus gland dysfunction in fading syndromes of puppies and kittens and if therapy with one or several of the thymus hormones or with growth hormone coQld reverse the symptoms of wasting.",
