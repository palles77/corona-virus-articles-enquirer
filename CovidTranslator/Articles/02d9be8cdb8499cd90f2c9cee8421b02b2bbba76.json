Month will be included in the model as the rate of exposure to influenza varies significantly over the season. Approximately two-thirds of all individuals who will receive the vaccine in a particular season do so within the first 2 weeks of the public immunization campaign. Other than in pandemic seasons where there is significant public fear around the time of the peak (such as the 2009/10 influenza season), the rate of immunization drops off rapidly after the first two weeks. Given that the start time for the analysis is one month after the start of the public campaign when the vast majority of vaccinations will be complete, and adjusting for both month and time since vaccination would cause over adjustment in the model, we have chosen to adjust only for month.",

There are no free text fields in either system. If a patient is admitted to a hospital, emergency room or outpatient clinic there are specialized abstractors that code all of the diagnoses given to a patient and include it in the MACAR system, therefore the diabetic patient with ARI you referenced in your question would get both codes. GPs are required to provide at least one diagnostic code for each patient encounter, but are not required to provide more than one.

One of the strengths of the method is that it can be implemented quickly whenever required. So at times when there is high concern (such as at the start of the influenza season or in a pandemic) it can be implemented weekly or biweekly, while at times of low concern it may be implemented once or twice a month. A likely schedule for the upcoming season (assuming it is a typical influenza season) would be biweekly until the peak of the influenza season and monthly thereafter.
