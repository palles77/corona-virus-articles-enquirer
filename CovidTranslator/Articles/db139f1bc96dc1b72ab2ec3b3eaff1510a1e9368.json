In addition, the synbiotic products market is also expanding due to the synergistic effects between pre-and probiotics that provide additional benefits to consumers. Pre-and probiotics are being evaluated for their effectiveness to treat and prevent infectious diseases in other parts of the human body where microbial communities exist. This review examines the scientific data related to the effects of pre-and probiotics on the treatment of diseases occurring in the skin, female urogenital tract, and respiratory tract. The evidence suggests that probiotics consumption can decrease the presence of eczema in children when their mothers have consumed probiotics during pregnancy and lactation. In women, probiotics consumption can effectively prevent recurrent urinary tract infections. The consumption of synbiotic products can reduce respiratory tract infections and their duration and severity. However, the outcomes of the meta-analyses are still limited and not sufficiently conclusive to support the use of probiotics to treat infectious diseases. This is largely a result of the limited number of studies, lack of standardization of the studies, and inconsistencies between the reported results. Therefore, it is advisable that future studies consider these shortcomings and include the evaluation of the combined use of pre-and probiotics.",

The global prebiotics and probiotics market is constantly growing partly attributed to consumer awareness of the health benefits of their consumption and, therefore, demand nutritional and therapeutic value of food products. The activity of the beneficial microbial community has enormous impact on human well-being, including host metabolism, physiology, nutrition, and immune function. Thus, the consumption of probiotics is purported to maintain the balance of the gut flora and to inhibit the growth of pathogenic bacteria. The consumption of nutrients exerting selective and positive effects on the beneficial gut bacterial flora (i.e., prebiotics) is another usually adopted strategy.",

In this context, most studies relate to the treatment/prevention of gastrointestinal diseases, widely discussed in other works reported in the current literature (Folch 2018; Whyand and Caplin 2014) . However, probiotics can also confer some benefits in the treatment of halitosis, allergies related to the respiratory system, immune system, prevention of systemic infections, among others. In this context, Braga et al. (2017) evaluated the preventive effects of probiotics in clinical practice. This analysis included 16 Cochrane systematic reviews that used probiotics as preventive interventions compared with placebo, or with any pharmacological or non-pharmacological interventions, or without comparison. These clinical interventions were classified into numbers of systematic reviews addressing the following: prevention of respiratory diseases (2), prevention of gastroenterological diseases (9), gynecological and obstetric diseases (3), urological diseases (1), and immunological/allergic diseases (1). The analysis concluded that there is little scientific evidence to support the use of probiotics. In addition, the quality of evidence provided was low or very low.",

Non-bacterial microorganisms have also been isolated, such as Malassezia spp. (fungal species, prevalent in sebaceous areas) and Demodex mites (microscopic arthropods) (Grice and Segre 2011) . Studies with 16S rRNA have determined that Staphylococcus epidermidis and Propionibacterium acnes represent fewer than 6% of the captured microbiota (Krutmann 2009 ). S. epidermidis and P. acnes are considered normal skin commensals that help fight pathogens and regulate the microbiome homeostasis. The skin topography is another factor that influences its microbiome. For instance, partially occluded areas, such as toes or behind the ears with elevated temperature and humidity, allow the growth of Staphylococcus spp. and Corynebacterium spp., both residents on healthy human skin (Grice 2014) . Furthermore, areas with a high density of sebaceous glands, such as the face, chest, or back, encourage the growth of lipophilic microorganisms, such as Propionibacterium spp., fungal Malassezia spp. (Grice 2014) , and Corynebacterium spp. (Scharschmidt and Fischbach 2013) . In addition, two commensal viral groups, anelloviruses and GBV-C, have been identified alerting to the possibility of a larger human virome (Delwart 2007) .",

This condition improved by lactoferrin (an anti-inflammatory milk protein) addition, i.e., lactoferrin-enriched fermented milk decreased acne vulgaris with reduced triacylglycerols in skin surface lipids. Additionally, neither of the probiotic-fermented milks produced alterations in skin hydratation or pH. Jung et al. (2013) evaluated whether probiotics could work synergistically with antibiotics to treat inflammatory acne while reducing side effects of antibiotic administration. This open-label study considered forty-five females (aged 18-35 years) with mild to moderate acne vulgaris. Patients were randomly assigned to one of the following three groups: The probiotic group was advised to take one capsule in the morning and once in the evening. The minocycline group was advised to take the antibiotic once after dinner. Those patients with combined treatment, probiotic plus antibiotic were instructed to take the probiotic at least 2 h after their antibiotics dosage. In addition, all patients received a standard topical acne medication and a facial cleaner applied twice daily. Probiotic capsule included L. acidophilus and L. delbrueckii sp. bulgaricus each 5-billion CFU/capsule and Bifidobacterium bifidum 20 billon CFU/capsule. Clinical evaluation was performed at baseline and during follow-up visits 2, 4, 8, and 12 weeks after treatment initiation. After the first 4 weeks, all patients demonstrated a significant (P < 0.001) improvement in total lesion count. After 8 and 12 weeks, total lesion count of the group with combined treatment decreased significantly compared to the other two groups. Jung et al. (2013) showed that probiotics reduced potential side effects to antibiotic use while also augmenting antibiotic therapy.",

Several studies evaluated the effect of probiotics combined with prebiotics; however, the results are still inconclusive and may depend on the severity of the disease and probiotics applied. Wu et al. (2012) studied the effect of Lactobacillus salivarius and FOS on infants with AD. Sixty children (aged 2-14 years) received two capsules containing either L. salivarius plus FOS (treatment) or FOS only (control) daily for 8 weeks. The AD intensity decreased significantly (P \u2264 0.013) in children administered the synbiotic treatment compared to the control group. A study evaluated the effect of probiotics on the treatment of children with AD. Forty pediatric patients (aged 1-13 years) were assigned to test or placebo group. Both groups consumed two bags a day for a total of eight weeks. The test bags contained 2 \u00d7 10 9 CFU of four types of probiotic bacteria (B. bifidum, L. acidophilus, L. casei, and L. salivarius), while the placebo bags contained skim milk powder and dextrose. The combination of probiotic strains was effective in reducing the SCORAD in the treatment of AD in pediatric patients (Ye\u015filova et al. 2012) .",

The probiotic function was evaluated by its ability to decrease the SCORAD and levels of serum immunoglobulin. In this study, twenty-two AD patients (aged 0-14 years), included in the test group (7 girls, 5 boys), received microencapsulated probiotic L. plantarum IS-10506 at 10 10 CFU/day, and the placebo group (3 girls, 7 boys) received skim milk, twice daily for 12 weeks. The SCORAD reduction in the test group was significantly (P = 0.0001) higher than that in the placebo group at the end of the study. Levels of IL-4 (P = 0.0001), IFN-\u03b3 (P = 0.006), and IL-17 (P = 0.0001) were significantly lower in the probiotic group than those in the placebo group, while the IgE levels were not significantly changed. Thus, L. plantarum IS-10506 was able to reduce clinical symptoms in children diagnosed with AD and therefore with potential to treat this disease (Prakoeswa et al. 2017) . Cabana et al. (2017) evaluated the effectiveness of daily L. rhamnosus GG supplementation for the first 6 months of life to decrease eczema incidence, a potential early marker of asthma. The intervention infants received a daily dose of L. rhamnosus GG (1 \u00d7 10 9 CFU) and inulin (225 mg), and the control infants received inulin (325 mg) alone. The results showed that the early probiotic supplementation for the first 6 months of life did not prevent the development of either eczema or asthma at 2 years of age in infants with high risk of allergic diseases.",

            "text": "Evidence suggests that restoration of the vaginal microbiota and/or modulation of the local mucosal immune response can be achieved via supplementation with probiotics, which can be administered orally as a probiotic food supplement, intra-vaginally as vaginal suppositories, or applied topically as a gel (Gille et al. 2016; Stapleton et al. 2011; Zeng et al. 2010) . Bertuccini et al. (2017) evaluated the effects of L. rhamnosus HN001 and L. acidophilus GLA-14 on bacterial vaginal pathogens (G. vaginalis and A. vaginae) and aerobic vaginitis (AV) (S. aureus and E. coli). In vitro assays demonstrated that probiotic bacteria possess inhibitory activity toward BV and AV pathogenic bacteria, with L. acidophilus GLA-14 generally exerting the highest antagonistic effect against anaerobic strains. Zeng et al. (2010) compared the efficacy of a non-antibiotic sucrose gel with an antibiotic metronidazole gel for the treatment of BV. The study considered 560 subjects with clinically diagnosed BV. Patients applied the gel twice daily for five consecutive days. After the treatment, the therapeutic cure rates of the sucrose, metronidazole, and placebo gel groups were 83.1, 71.3, and 0.9% after 7-10 days, respectively. A second evaluation after 21-35 days of treatment showed 61.0, 66.7, and 7.3% cure rates for the sucrose, metronidazole, and placebo gel groups, respectively. According to these results, the researchers suggest that sucrose gel can restore the normal vaginal flora and used as a novel treatment for BV. Moreover, sucrose gel carries less risk of inducing pathogenic bacteria-resistant variants than the currently used antibiotics, including metronidazole. The authors argue that sucrose gel and metronidazole gel have different mechanisms of action in treating BV. The treatment with sucrose gel mediates a shift of vaginal bacterial flora, thereby promoting the growth of lactobacilli, which in turn generate lactic acid that reduce the vaginal pH and secrete antibacterial substances, inhibiting the adhesion and replication of the pathogenic anaerobic bacteria. In contrast, metronidazole gel appears to inhibit the growth of both the pathogenic bacteria and the beneficial lactobacilli. However, researchers believe that lactobacillus will recover faster than the pathogenic bacteria once the metronidazole gel treatment is complete because lactobacillus is more resistant to metronidazole than anaerobic bacteria. Hemmerling et al. (2010) evaluated the colonization efficiency, safety, tolerability, and acceptability of L. crispatus CTV-05 (Lactin-V) administered by a vaginal applicator. The phase 2a Lactin-V was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in premenopausal women diagnosed with BV. Twenty-four women (aged 18-50 years) were randomized to test or control group. The test group (18 women) received Lactin-V (2 \u00d7 10 9 CFU/dose of L. crispatus CTV-05), while the control group (6 women) received a placebo for 5 initial consecutive days, followed by a weekly application over two weeks. Women returned for evaluation on days 10 and 28. The results showed that L. crispatus CTV-05 colonized eleven women of the test group at day 10 or day 28. The preexisting endogenous Lactobacillus flora at baseline line did not influence colonization with L. crispatus CTV-05. In addition, women who followed the protocol (7 doses at the recommended time) had better colonization than those who used a lower dose of Lactin-V. Finally, the product was well tolerated and accepted. Coste et al. (2012) evaluated the efficacy and safety of an intravaginal prebiotic gel in the balance recovery of the vaginal flora in women previously treated for BV. The doubleblind, parallel placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial included 42 premenopausal, nonpregnant women aged 18-50 years. Patients confirmed with BV received oral antibiotic treatment with metronidazole during 7 days. Then, the test group (20 patients) were randomized to receive the APP-14 gel inside a small tube containing 7 mL of product with the glucooligosaccharides-alpha prebiotic (6%, equivalent to a minimum of 300 mg of oligosaccharide) and the Trifolium pratense extract (2%). Meanwhile, the control group (22 patients) received placebo gel without the active ingredients. The intravaginal-gel was self-administered once a day for 16 consecutive days. The results showed that after the antibiotic treatment there was no significant (P = 0.296) difference between the groups and the normal vaginal flora was not completely restored. After 8 days of treatment, all women who received prebiotic treatment had normal vaginal flora, while 33% of women in the control group did not completely restore normal vaginal flora. After 16 days treatment, all women treated with the prebiotic gel maintained normal vaginal flora, whereas in the placebo group 24% had not completely restored vaginal flora.",

The test group (395 women) and placebo group (149 women) received either two probiotic capsules (each containing >10 9 CFU of each Lactobacillus strain) or two placebo capsules per day for 6 weeks.

Besides, the administration of S. cerevisiae was evaluated for its influence on the number and functions of a landmark sign of inflammation in the host. In general, the study determined that daily intravaginal administration of S. cerevisiae CNCM I-3856 leads to the suppression of several fungal components that play critical roles in fungal virulence of C. albicans at the vaginal level. S. cerevisiae modulated the expression of aspartyl proteinases as well as hyphal growth-associated genes, Hwp1 and Ece1, in the vaginal cavity. The probiotic effects on the host and the probiotic suppression of neutrophils influx caused by the fungus into the vaginas of the mice are likely related to lower interleukin-8 (cytokine associated with inflammatory responses) production and inhibition of aspartyl proteinase expression. Besides, there was no evidence of any cytotoxic effect either by the probiotic, when used in vivo, on vaginal epithelial cell and organ architecture, or in in vitro in human vaginal epithelium (Gabrielli et al. 2018) . Handalishy et al. (2014) compared the efficacy of vaginally administered probiotic vaginal tampons with oral metronidazole for the treatment of BV. This single blinded, randomized clinical trial included healthy women diagnosed with BV. The patients, aged 20-40 years, were randomly assigned to two groups (antibiotic and probiotic groups). The antibiotic group (16 patients) received oral metronidazole (500 mg twice daily for 7 days), while the probiotic group (15 patients) used lactobacilli-impregnated vaginal tampons for 5 days during menstruation. The probiotic group had significantly lower incidence of discharge than metronidazole group (P = 0.024) and higher cure rate than metronidazole group, but this difference was not significant (P = 0.269). Verdenelli et al. (2016) evaluated the effect of probiotic suppositories, SYNBIO\u00ae gin, on vaginal health. The study included 35 apparently healthy women (aged 18-48 years), who were instructed to receive daily for 7 days the probiotic suppositories SYNBIO\u00ae gin, containing at least 10 9 CFU of viable lactobacilli, a combination of L. rhamnosus IMC 501\u00ae and L. paracasei IMC 502\u00ae. Women were examined three times during the study. The results revealed the presence of the two strain originating from SYNBIO\u00ae gin in 100% of women at visit 2 and 34% at visit 3. In addition, the probiotic suppositories were well-tolerated and had no adverse effects, and no significant changes were registered for pH between visits.",

Furthermore, the URT contains mycobiota that include Aspergillus, Penicillium, Candida, and Alternaria species (Eidi et al. 2016) .",

The study period (12 months) was completed by 68 (44 males, 24 females) of the 94 babies, who participated in the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. The study included infants with a mean gestational age of 35 weeks (range, 32 to 36 + 6 weeks) and a mean birth weight of 2393 g (range, 1550-3965 g). Preterm infants received oral prebiotics (GOS:polydextrose in a 1:1 ratio at 1 \u00d7 600 mg/day for 1 to 30 days and 2 \u00d7 600 mg/day for 31 to 60 days) or a probiotic (L. rhamnosus GG, ATCC 53103; at 1 \u00d7 10 9 CFU/ day for 1 to 30 days and 2 \u00d7 10 9 CFU/day for 31 to 60 days). The placebo group received microcrystalline cellulose and dextrose anhydrate between 3 and 60 days. Incidence of RTIs was significantly lower in infants receiving prebiotics (P < 0.001) or L. rhamnosus GG (P = 0.022) compared with those receiving placebo. Furthermore, the incidence of rhinovirus-induced episodes was significantly lower in the prebiotic (P = 0.003) and probiotic (P = 0.051) groups than the placebo group. Lau et al. (2018) studied the effects of Bifidobacterium longum BB536 on diarrhea and/or upper respiratory illnesses.

The children received a sachet (1 g) containing either B. longum (5 \u00d7 10 9 CFU) or placebo daily. After 10 months, the probiotic strain did not exert significant effect against diarrhea in children. However, the duration of sore throat decreased (46%), with marginal reduction for fever duration (27%), runny nose (15%), and cough (16%), compared to the placebo.

Additionally, cell line assays for adhesion competition and immunomodulation were used to substantiate the inhibitory effect of twelve Lactobacillus strains against M. catarrhalis.

Strains, such as L. rhamnosus GG, L. casei Shirota, L. casei DN-114001, L. plantarum LMG1284, and L. plantarum WCFS1, presented clear inhibition zones in the range of the positive control. Screening of the activity of the spent culture supernatants after different treatments demonstrated that lactic acid exerted strong antimicrobial activity against this pathogen. In in vitro test, minimal inhibitory concentration values for D-and L-lactic acid ranged from 0.5 to 27 g/L depending on pH. L. rhamnosus GG also reduced M. catarrhalis adhesion (> 50%) to human airway epithelial cells and the expression of mucin MUC5AC, pro-inflammatory cytokines, interleukin, and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 at least 1.2 fold.",

The evidence suggests that probiotics consumption can decrease the presence of eczema in children when their mothers have consumed probiotics during pregnancy and lactation. In women, probiotics consumption can be effective in preventing recurrent urinary tract infections. The consumption of synbiotic products can reduce respiratory tract infections and their duration and severity. However, the in vitro, in vivo, and clinical studies present certain shortcomings, such as the wide variety of probiotics considered in studies, which makes it difficult to identify the individual effect of each probiotic strain. On the other hand, the studies lack standardization, the number of patients or volunteers required in the trials is small, and the cost-effectiveness of probiotics is another factor to analyze. These issues mean that the information reported in the current literature is limited and the -The bacterial strains of Ecologic\u00ae Allergycare have been selected to influence the immune system. -Ecologic\u00ae Allergycare reduces the SCORAD in children between 1-13 years of age suffering from atopic dermatitis.",
