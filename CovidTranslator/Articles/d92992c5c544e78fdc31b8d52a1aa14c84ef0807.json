An early start of proper anti-viral management can reduce unnecessary overuse of antibacterial agents. In addition, some respiratory viruses, including IFV, EnV, and AdV, may now benefit from specific antivi-ral treatment. 6 most commonly used method for identifying respiratory viruses. 9 An enzyme immunoassay may be quicker but it is less sensitive. These conventional methods may be affected by specimen quality, virus type, and technical skill. [10] [11] [12] The virus culture is still considered the gold standard for respiratory virus detection, but it has limitations in turnaround time, specimen transport, and storage conditions in maintaining the infectivity of the virus. 11, 13 To compare the test methods, Choi, et al. 14 reported that the positive rate of the direct antigen test, viral culture method, and multiplex PCR for detecting AdV, IFV, PIFV, and RSV was 28.4%, 36.2%, and 44.8%, respectively. Recently, virus identification by immunostaing after shell vial culture is the most widely accepted laboratory standard method of virus testing. But, this method is still not easy for routine testing in clinical laboratories. The nucleic acid amplification method including multiplex PCR is a powerful alternative, but it has some limitations of false positivity and false negativity. The nucleic acid amplification test is faster than the culture method and has been reported to be more sensitive 9,15-17 and can be automated these days. In addition, there are advantages in detecting some viruses which grow poorly in cell cultures such as HMPV. 18 A Korean national survey 19 of respiratory virus testing was performed and thirty-one clinical laboratories responded that they provided respiratory virus testing for clinical diagnosis in Korea. Among the responders, PCR and/or culture were most widely adopted, in 42% of the institutes, rapid immunochromatographic method 29%, immunofluorescent antigen assay 23%, and enzyme immunoassay 7%.",

Our results of the two multiplex PCR showed an equivalent or higher positive rate than in other studies. 9, 10, 14 Two kinds of multiplex PCR reagents showed different positivity according to the virus type. The positive rate of the Seeplex TM RV detection kit was higher than the Labopass TM RV kit for IFV and RhV. However, the Identification of Pediatric Respiratory Virus Labopass TM RV kit detected more HMPV than the Seeplex TM RV kit. Discrepant results between these two types of multiplex PCR and R-Mix culture comprised 51.5% (53/103) of the total. Weinberg, et al. 17 reported that the PCR method could detect viruses two times more, compared with virus culture. Our study showed that the concordance rate of Seeplex PCR to the virus culture was 83% (90/103), and that of Labopass PCR, 80.6% (83/103). These results were similar to previous reports, of 83.2% (556/668) 17 and 80% (40/50). 20 The discrepancy might be caused from multiplex PCR limitations. One of the major limitations of PCR detection is false-negative results as a consequence of PCR inhibitors present in clinical samples that are not removed by the extraction process. 9 Another limitation is the principle of PCRs, which could produce false results if a primer region has nucleotide variation and is unable to detect new types or strains of a virus. This is the reason that direct antigen tests or virus cultures cannot be completely substituted by solitary multiplex PCR tests until now. 21 We noticed a 6.8% (15/220) coinfection rate (more than 2 virus types identified) by the Seeplex TM RV kit and 5.9% (13/220) by the Labopass TM RV kit. Previous studies have suggested that double-virus infections are associated with greater severity of respiratory tract infection. 22 In our study, we could not find out any remarkable parameters or difference of clinical severity in cases of coinfection.",
