            "text": "Community-acquired respiratory tract infections occur with varied frequency throughout the year. These infections are among the most common reasons for healthcare visits and can be caused by both viral and bacterial pathogens [1] . Symptoms caused by viruses are non-specific and include sore throat, runny nose, watery eyes, cough, wheezing, shortness of breath, sputum production and nasal congestion. Additionally, these symptoms are indistinguishable from those caused by bacterial pathogens [2] . Mixed infections with two or more respiratory pathogens are not uncommon and might be underreported due to the limited sensitivity of methods currently used for diagnosis [3] [4] [5] . The identity of the pathogen causing symptoms is critical for rapid institution of adequate antiviral or antibiotic therapy as well as proper isolation of infected patients to prevent health-care associated infection, which can have devastating effects in an immunocompromised population [6, 7] . Empirical, broad-spectrum therapy is often administered due to limitations of conventional diagnostic methods to provide timely results to guide clinician's decision. A great illustration of the importance of specific diagnosis came with the emergence of the novel H1N1 influenza virus in 2009. Unlike the seasonal H1N1 influenza virus, the novel virus was sensitive to the antiviral drug oseltamivir (Tamiflu \u00d2 ), but resistant to amantadine and rimantadine (Symadine \u00d2 and Flumadine \u00d2 ). Since respiratory symptoms of these two influenza viruses are similar, accurate and timely identification of the correct virus was critical for the administration of appropriate therapy [8] .",

In the last two decades, respiratory viruses have become increasingly recognized as a serious cause of morbidity and mortality in hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) and solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] . As part of their treatment, patients undergoing HSCT and SOT become severely immunosuppressed, rendering them highly susceptible to infectious pathogens. Serious complications, which can be fatal, include viral pneumonia, lateral airflow obstruction syndrome, graft rejection and superinfection with bacterial and fungal pathogens [9, 12] . Similarly, respiratory viruses can have a significant impact in young children and elderly patients resulting in frequent hospitalization and significant health costs [14, 15] .",

Influenza viruses type A are further sub-typed based on the sequence of two glycoproteins: hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N) [20] . Influenza viruses cause annual, seasonal epidemic characterized by an increase in the frequency of upper respiratory symptoms seen in the community between December and May in the northern hemisphere [21] . Although the infection usually remains limited to the upper respiratory tract in most patients, complications due to influenza viruses have been reported in HSCT and SOT patients, especially lung transplant recipients [18, 22, 23] . In one study, the frequency of pneumonia caused by influenza viruses was 30% with a fatality rate of 15% in HSCT recipients [12] . However, reports on frequency of complications has varied (7-44%) with fatality ranging from 15 to 28% in HSCT recipients [18] .

There are four predominant PIV serotypes including: PIV-1, PIV-2, PIV-3 and PIV-4 [27] . Until recently, PIV-4 was rarely isolated since most diagnostic assays available did not include reagents for the detection of PIV-4 and so less information is available on this PIV subtype. In the northern hemisphere, PIV occurs year-round with PIV-1 occurring most frequently in the fall, PIV-2 occurring in the fall to early winter and PIV-3 occuring in the spring and summer months [24, 27] . Infections caused by PIV are usually mild, ranging from asymptomatic shedding to the common cold, croup and bronchiolitis. Similar to RSV, PIV infection occurs frequently in children, with most children exposed to PIV-3 by the age of two and PIV-1 by the age of 5 [24] . The reported incidence of PIV in HSTC populations ranges from 0.2 to 18% with 13 to 43% progressing to lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) and 12 to 50% of these LRTI resulting in death with most infections caused by PIV-3 [18, 28] . In lung transplant recipients, PIV LRTI have been associated with high rate of allograft rejection [29] . hMPV hMPV is another member of the Paraxmyxoviridae family and is structurally related to RSV and PIV. It is a relatively newly described virus and has become increasingly recognized as a cause of significant respiratory illness in young children, older adults and immunocompromised patients [30, 31] . The incidence of hMPV in HSCT patients ranges from 3 to 7% with complications and fatality rate similar to those of RSV [18, 32] . Similar to other Paramyxoviridae viruses, hMPV can result in graft dysfunction and/or rejection in lung transplant recipients [33, 34] .",

The FilmArray RP has been evaluated against other FDA cleared molecular assays [59, [65] [66] [67] . Most of the published reports evaluated the premarket version of the FilmArray RP on samples from pediatric patients where the prevalence of respiratory viruses is expected to be higher. Overall, the FilmArray RP has a sensitivity and specificity >80%. However, the reported sensitivity of the first version of FilmArray RP for adenovirus is around 50%. As noted above, the manufacturer has released a new version of the FilmArray RP with improved adenovirus detection. Rand et al. compared the performance of the FilmArray RP and xTAG RVP on 200 specimens from both adult and pediatric patients, previously tested by viral culture and antigen testing [67] . The complete agreement between the two tests was excellent at 91.5% with more viruses detected by the FilmArray RP (160 viruses by FilmArray RP versus 149 viruses by xTAG RVP). Notably, the FilmArray RP had greater sensitivity for RSV than the xTAG RVP (100 vs 82.2%). Loeffelholz and colleagues compared the FilmArray RP to the series of FDA cleared Prodesse (GenProbe) Real-time PCR assays including the ProFlu+, Pro-FAST+, ProParaflu+, ProhMPV+ and ProAdeno+ [66] . The Fil-mArray RP and Prodesse assays showed good overall agreement (94.3%) when tested on 192 specimens from pediatric patients, with the FilmArray RP being more sensitive for PIV-1 and -3, detecting an additional two PIV-1 and three PIV-3 not detected by the ProParaflu + assay. The ProAdeno+ was more sensitive for adenoviruses than the FilmArray RP, detecting a total of 11 adenoviruses compared to five adenovirus detected by the FilmArray RP. Additionally, the authors compared the FilmArray RP to LDT for targets not included in the Prodesse assays with the sensitivity ranging from 50 to 100% although the number of positive specimens tested was small (n = 1 to 8), except for rhinovirus/enterovirus (n = 118) targets. We compared the performance of the FilmArray RP to the pre-market version of the xTAG RVP FAST on 358 respiratory specimens from pediatric patients [65] . In our report, the FilmArray RP was overall more sensitive than the xTAG RVP FAST for most viruses common to both assays, especially for RSV (100 vs 60%) and FluB (100 vs 50%). However, the xTAG RVP FAST was more sensitive than the FilmArray RP for PIV-4 (100 vs 33.3%) and rhinoviruses (97.6 vs 91.6%). In a recent study, the FilmArray RP was evaluated along other multiplexed FDA-cleared molecular assays including the xTAG RVP, the xTAG RVP FAST and the GenMark eSensor [59] . The FilmArray RP had an overall sensitivity of 84.5% with sensitivity varying from 92-100% for influenza virus A/H3, MPV, PIV-1, PIV-2, PIV-3 and RSV B and sensitivity varying from 73-83% for influenza virus A H1/2009, influenza virus, RSV A and rhinoviruses/enteroviruses. Of note, the sensitivity of the FilmArray RP and the xTAG RVP for RSV was similar [59] . The sensitivity of the FilmArray RP for adenoviruses was especially low at 57% as reported in other studies [66, 68] .",

In April 2013, a new version of the FilmArray RP assay (version 1.7) was released. The FilmArray RP v1.7 was designed to enhance the detection of adenoviruses by adding a second adenovirus assay to the panel. No peer-reviewed published reports are yet available on the performance of the improved assay for adenovirus. Abstracts presented at the 29th clinical virology symposium showed increased sensitivity of the FilmArray RP v1.7 when compared to FilmArray RP v1.6 (81.6 vs 23.8%) but still missed adenoviruses detected by the xTAG RVP or Prodesse ProAdeno+ Assay and LDT adenovirus singleplex [71, 72] .",

Five-year view Five years ago, the FDA cleared the xTAG RVP as the first broadly multiplexed molecular assay for the detection of respiratory viruses in nasopharyngeal swabs. Today there are four FDA-cleared broadly multiplexed assays, the xTAG RVP and the xTAG RVP FAST (Luminex Corp.), the eSensor RVP (GenMark inc.) and the FilmArray respiratory panel (RP) (BioFire Diagnostics).

As such, the FilmArray RP has raised the expectations of both the clinical laboratories and clinicians as to what is possible for the rapid and sensitive diagnosis of infectious diseases in general.

The xTAG RVP includes five steps: nucleic acid extraction, multiplex RT-PCR, multiplex target-specific primer extension, hybridization; and detection of the amplified target on a Luminex 100/ 200 platform [60]. A second version of the assay, the xTAG \u00d2 Respiratory Viral Panel Fast (RVP FAST), was approved in 2011 and detects RSV, influenza virus A (H1 subtype, H3 subtype and untypeable), influenza virus B, MPV, adenovirus and rhinovirus. The assay was simplified to reduce hands on time, workflow and turn-around-time from approximately 8 to 6 h. A study The FilmArray \u00d2 RP Diagnostic Profile www.expert-reviews.comcomparing the xTAG RVP to a pre-market, RUO version of the xTAG RVP FAST reported a reduced sensitivity of the xTAG RVP FAST (88.6 and 77.5%), especially for influenza B virus, parainfluenza virus Type 2 and HCoV 229E, with the last two targets not included in the FDA cleared version of the assay[61].",
