Several species of nontuberculous mycobacteria may also contaminate water treatment systems, including Mycobacterium chelonae, M. abscessus, M. fortuitum, M. gordonae, M. mucogenicum, M. scrofulaceum, M. kansasii, M. avium, and M. intracellulare; these microorganisms do not contain bacterial endotoxin but are comparatively resistant to chemical germicides. [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] Gram-negative water bacteria can multiply even in water containing relatively small amounts of organic matter, such as water treated by distillation, softening, deionization, or reverse osmosis, reaching levels of 10 5 to 10 7 microorganisms/mL 6 ; these levels are not associated with visible turbidity. When treated water is mixed with dialysis concentrate, the resulting dialysis fluid is a balanced salt solution and growth medium almost as rich in nutrients as conventional nutrient broth. 6, 27 Gram-negative water bacteria growing in dialysis fluids can reach levels of 10 8 to 10 9 microorganisms/mL, producing visible turbidity.",

A variety of filters are marketed to control bacterial contamination of water and dialysis fluids. Most are inadequate, especially if they are not routinely disinfected or frequently changed. Particulate filters, commonly called prefilters, operate by depth filtration and do not remove bacteria or endotoxin. These filters can become colonized with gram-negative water bacteria, resulting in higher levels of bacteria and endotoxin in the filter effluent. Absolute filters, including membrane types, temporarily remove bacteria from passing water. However, some of these filters tend to clog, and gram-negative water bacteria can \"grow through\" the filter matrix and colonize downstream surfaces of the filters within a few days. Further, absolute filters do not reduce levels of endotoxin in the effluent water. These filters should be changed regularly in accordance with the manufacturer's directions and disinfected in the same manner and at the same time as the rest of the water distribution system. Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) is sometimes used to reduce microbial contamination in water, but the use of UVGI has some special considerations. The lamp should be appropriately sized for the flow rate of water passing through the device, and the energy output should be monitored to ensure effectiveness of the lamp. Manufacturers of the lamp may require routine replacement schedule. Some bacterial populations may develop resistance to UVGI. In recirculating dialysis distribution systems, repeated exposure to UVGI are used to ensure adequate disinfection; however, this approach allows for progressive removal of sensitive microorganisms and selection of UVGI-resistant organisms. In addition, bacterial endotoxins are not affected.",

Outlets to dialysis machines should have a relatively short path with the least amount of fittings and the use of valves with minimal dead space.

Single-pass machines tend to respond to adequate cleaning and disinfection procedures and, in general, have lower levels of bacterial contamination than do recirculating machines. Levels of contamination in single-pass machines depend primarily on the microbiological quality of the incoming water and the method of machine disinfection. 6, 38 Earlier dialysis machines had a port (waste-handling option) that allowed disposal of the extracorporeal circuit priming fluids. If one-way check valves in the waste-handling option are not maintained, checked for competency, or disinfected as recommended, it allows back flow from the effluent dialysate path into and contamination of the port and the attached bloodline.

This decline coincides with decisions made by several large dialysis organizations to discontinue the practice of reuse and to only use single-use dialyzers. Although dialyzer reuse is still common in developing countries, it has become less popular in developed countries and some have plans to phase out this practice. 50, 51 After a series of outbreaks of bacterial infections associated with reuse and reprocessing of dialyzers, CDC recommended that single use of dialyzers be the preferred practice and stated that it should be used whenever possible. 52 In 1986, AAMI standards for reprocessing hemodialyzers 53 were adopted by the United States Public Health Service and was incorporated into regulation by CMS. In the United States, dialyzer reuse has not been associated with the transmission of bloodborne pathogens such as hepatitis B (HBV), hepatitis C (HCV), or human immunodeficiency 54, 55 However, the reprocessing of dialyzers has been associated with pyrogenic reactions and bacterial infections. 54 These adverse events may be the result of the use of incorrect concentrations of chemical germicides, the failure to maintain appropriate water quality, breaks in reprocessing procedures, or practical challenges to achieving complete disinfection of reused dialyzers. Manual reprocessing of dialyzers, which is allowed in the United States, does not include testing for membrane integrity, such as a pressure-leak test, may fail to detect membrane defects, and relies on disinfection processes that are particularly difficult to standardize. 54, 55 Dialyzer reprocessing can be performed in myriad ways with few quality control checks. 52 Procedures used to reprocess hemodialyzers generally constitute high-level disinfection rather than sterilization. 20, 56 Several liquid chemical germicides have been used for high-level disinfection of dialyzers. There are commercially available chemical germicides specifically formulated for this purpose (e.g., peroxyacetic acid, chlorine-based, and glutaraldehyde-based products that are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration",

In most instances the water used to rinse dialyzers or to prepare the dialyzer disinfectants exceeded the allowable AAMI microbial or endotoxin standards, because the water distribution system was not disinfected frequently, the disinfectant was improperly prepared, or routine microbial assays were improperly performed. Several outbreaks associated with dialyzer reuse have been reported. Breaches in disinfection of dialyzer components (such as an O-ring) and contamination caused by poor infection control practices during reprocessing steps have been identified as major contributors to those outbreaks. 52, [57] [58] [59] In at least one outbreak, no major breaches in reprocessing were identified. Rather, it was determined that dialyzers are difficult to reprocess safely and completely under typical conditions. This is due to poorly trained staff (often in low-paying jobs), variability in procedures, and few quality control standards. 52 As described in the most recent investigation of a reuse associated outbreak that resulted in 17 cases, \"In practice, reuse and reprocessing of dialyzers poses an increased risk for infection to patients. \" 52 In this investigation, each additional use of a dialyzer was associated with higher odds of bloodstream infection. In the era of affordable single-use dialyzers, dialysis providers have discontinued reuse in the interest of patient safety. 52 For facilities or regions where reuse and reprocessing continues to be performed, improved standardization of processes and rigorous quality assurance programs are needed.",

Also, the test for residual available chlorine to confirm adequate rinsing is simple and sensitive.

The rinse water invariably contains organisms that can multiply to significant levels if the system is permitted to stand overnight. 27 Therefore disinfection with chlorine-based disinfectants are best used before the start of the first patient treatment session rather than at the end of the day.

There is increasing evidence that the microbial quality of hemodialysis fluids plays a role in the chronic inflammatory response syndrome, affects anemia management, accelerates loss of residual renal function, and affects serum albumin levels in dialysis patients. [68] [69] [70] [71] [72] [73] [74] [75] [76] [77] [78] [79] [80] [81] [82] Increasing data suggest that use of ultrapure water and dialysate would benefit maintenance hemodialysis patients and potentially save costs. 83, 84 A large cohort study from Japan found a lower all-cause mortality in facilities using ultrapure water. 85 However, there have been no randomized controlled studies to evaluate and confirm these studies, so regulatory agencies have not yet mandated these higher water standards. 83 Water samples for routine testing should be collected from a source as close as possible to where water enters the dialysate proportioning unit. In most cases this is the tap (not from that hose connecting the tap to the dialysis machine) at the dialysis station (Fig. 25.1 ). Water samples should be collected at least monthly from several locations within the dialysis unit, including samples at different dialysis stations. Samples should also be collected using a similar approach after any modifications or maintenance have been made to the water treatment system water distribution system. Dialysate samples should be collected during or at the end of the dialysis treatment from a source close to where the dialysis fluid either enters or leaves the dialyzer (Fig. 25. 2). Dialysate samples should be collected at least monthly from a representative number of dialysis machines. Samples of water and dialysate should also be collected when a pyrogenic reaction is suspected. If centers reprocess hemodialyzers for reuse, water used to prepare disinfectant and rinse dialyzers should also be assayed monthly. 30, 66 The maximum contaminant levels for water are 100 CFU/mL and 0.25 EU/mL (see Table 25 .2). 30, 31, 33 Methods for microbiological and endotoxin testing are available elsewhere. 86 In an outbreak investigation, the assay methods may need to be both qualitative and quantitative; also detection of nontuberculous mycobacteria and in some cases fungi in water or dialysate may be desirable. In such instances, plates should be incubated for 5 to 14 days at both 36\u00b0C and 28\u00b0 to 30\u00b0C. Laboratories should be notified of special testing requests outside of routine water testing, such as if the facilities would like to look for specific pathogens.",

Pyrogenic reactions can occur without bacteria; because presenting signs and symptoms cannot differentiate bacteremia from pyrogenic reactions, blood cultures are necessary. During 1990-2002 an annual average of 20% to 24% of the hemodialysis centers in the United States reported at least one pyrogenic reaction in the absence of septicemia in their patients undergoing maintenance hemodialysis. 48, 49, [89] [90] [91] [92] [93] [94] [95] [96] [97] Pyrogenic reactions can result from passage of bacterial endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide) or other substances in the dialysate across the dialyzer membrane [98] [99] [100] [101] [102] or from the transmembrane stimulation of cytokine production in the patient's blood by endotoxin in the dialysate. 99, [103] [104] [105] In other instances, endotoxin can enter directly into the bloodstream with fluids that are contaminated with gram-negative bacteria. 106 The signs and symptoms of pyrogenic reactions without bacteremia generally abate within a few hours after the dialysis has been stopped. If gram-negative sepsis is associated, fever and chills may persist and hypotension is more refractory to therapy. 4, 106 When a patient develops a pyrogenic reaction (i.e., onset of fever or chills) while being dialyzed, the following steps are recommended: (1) careful physical examination of the patient to identify signs and symptoms and evaluate other possible causes of chills and fever (e.g., pneumonia, vascular access site infection); (2) blood cultures, other diagnostic tests (e.g., chest radiograph), and other cultures as clinically indicated; (3) collection of dialysate from the dialyzer (i.e., postdialyzer effluent sample) for quantitative and qualitative microbiological culture; and (4) recording of the incident in a log or other permanent record. In addition, empiric antibiotic treatment should be administered to the patient. Determining the cause of such episodes is important because they may be the first indication of a remediable problem that can affect a potentially large number of patients.",

            "text": "The higher the level of bacteria and endotoxin in dialysis fluid, the higher the probability that the bacteria or their products will pass through the dialyzer membrane to produce bacteremia or stimulate cytokine production. In an outbreak of febrile reactions among patients undergoing hemodialysis, the attack rates were directly proportional to the level of microbial contamination in the dialysis fluid. 6 Prospective studies also reported a lower pyrogenic reaction rate among patients when they underwent dialysis with dialysis fluid from which most bacteria had been removed by filtration, compared with patients who underwent dialysis fluid that was highly contaminated (mean 19,000 CFU/mL). 5 high potential for blood contamination makes the hemodialysis setting unique. In addition, the need for routine aseptic access of the patient's vascular system makes the hemodialysis unit more akin to a surgical suite than to a standard hospital room. Medical items are categorized as critical (e.g., needles and catheters), which are introduced directly into the bloodstream or normally sterile areas of the body; semicritical (e.g., fiberoptic endoscopes), which come in contact with intact mucous membranes; and noncritical (e.g., blood pressure cuffs), which touch only intact skin. 109, 110 Cleaning and housekeeping in the dialysis center have two goals: to remove soil and waste on a regular basis, thereby preventing the accumulation of potentially infectious material, and to maintain an environment that is conducive to good patient care. 110 Crowding of patients and patient stations, as well as overtaxing of staff members, may increase the likelihood of microbial transmission. Adequate cleaning may be difficult if there are multiple wires, tubes, and hoses in a small area. There should be enough space to move completely around each patient's dialysis station without interfering with the neighboring stations. According to the Facility Guidelines Institute, each dialysis station should be at least 80 square feet and allow at least 4 feet distance between stations to avoid contamination. 111 However, most of dialysis facilities do not have space to meet that guideline. To avoid contamination, cleaning should only start when patients have left the station and staff should not allow new patients into chairs until cleaning and disinfection is complete. Creating unit-wide patient-free intervals between treatment shifts is likely to improve the adequacy of station cleaning and disinfection between patients.",

            "text": "The annual adjusted mortality rate among hemodialysis patients is 169 per thousand patient-years at risk. Infection is the second leading cause of mortality in this patient population, accounting for 8% of all deaths. 1 In a number of published studies that have evaluated bacterial infections in outpatient hemodialysis, bacteremia occurred in 0.6% to 1.7% of patients per month and vascular access infections (VAIs; with or without bacteremia) in 1.3% to 7.2% of patients per month. [113] [114] [115] [116] [117] [118] [119] [120] [121] [122] [123] A review of four studies published during 2002 estimated that 1.8% of hemodialysis patients have vascular access associated bacteremia each month, amounting to 50,000 episodes nationally per year. 124 In a study of 27 French hemodialysis centers, 28% of 230 infections in hemodialysis patients involved the vascular access, whereas 25% involved the lung, 23% the urinary tract, 9% the skin and soft tissues, and 15% other or unknown sites. 119 Because of the importance of bacterial infections in hemodialysis patients, the CDC initiated a voluntary ongoing surveillance system in the United States called the Dialysis Surveillance Network (DSN) in 1999. 122 At the time, only bacterial infections associated with hospital admission or intravenous antimicrobial receipt were counted; as a result, this system likely only detected more severe infections. During 1999-2001, 109 dialysis centers reported data. Rates per 100 patient-months were 3.2 for all VAIs (including access infections both with and without bacteremia), 1.8 for vascular access associated bacteremia, 1.3 for wound infection not related to the vascular access, 0.8 for pneumonia, and 0.3 for urinary tract infection. Among patients with fistulas or grafts, wounds were the most common site for infection. Among patients with hemodialysis catheters, infections of the vascular access site were the most common site for infection. 122 The surveillance project expanded and evolved into National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN), of which Dialysis Event Surveillance is a component (https://www.cdc.gov/nhsn/dialysis/index.html). The NHSN is an Internet-based surveillance system that enables facilities to report healthcare-associated infection data to the CDC. VAIs in dialysis patients and related events are reported to NHSN's Dialysis Event Surveillance. Outpatient hemodialysis facilities in the United States eligible to participate in the surveillance are instructed to follow a standard protocol, 125 by which all outpatients who receive hemodialysis at the facility are monitored for three NHSN-defined dialysis events. The three types of dialysis events (positive blood culture; intravenous antimicrobial start; and pus, redness, or increased swelling at the vascular access site) are reported using a standard data collection form.

[137] [138] [139] [140] [141] To minimize infectious complications, patients should be referred early for creation of an arteriovenous access, thereby decreasing the time dialyzed through a temporary catheter. During the period between 1995 and 2002, the percentage of patients dialyzed through fistulas increased from 22% to 33%, with most of the increase occurring after 1999. 49 Data from Dialysis Outcomes and Practice Patterns Study indicated that from August 2010 to August 2013, AV fistula use increased from 63% to 68%, whereas catheter use declined from 19% to 15%. 142 However, the majority of incident patients still initiated dialysis with a catheter.

            "text": "Exogenous pathogens have caused numerous outbreaks, most of which resulted from inadequate dialyzer reprocessing procedures (e.g., contaminated water or inadequate disinfectant concentration) or inadequate disinfection and maintenance of the water treatment and distribution system. During 1995-2006, five outbreaks were traced to contamination of the waste handling option on one type of dialysis machine. [41] [42] [43] [143] [144] [145] Recommendations to prevent such outbreaks have been published elsewhere. 146 Contaminated medication vials are also a source of bacterial infection for patients. In 1999, an outbreak of Serratia liquefaciens bloodstream infections and pyrogenic reactions among hemodialysis patients was traced to contamination of vials of erythropoietin. These vials, which were intended for single use, were contaminated by repeated puncture to obtain additional doses and by pooling of residual medication into a common vial. 147 Recommendations for preventing VAIs have been developed by the CDC 148 and the Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee 149 and the National Kidney Foundation. [137] [138] [139] [140] [141] The CDC has developed a recommended \"Approach to BSI Prevention in Dialysis Facilities\" that includes core interventions to prevent BSI among hemodialysis patients (Table 25 .4). Facilities that implemented this set of interventions were able to reduce their access-related BSI rates and sustained these lowered rates for at least 4 years. 150 The core interventions include (1) BSI surveillance using NHSN and feedback to clinical staff; (2) hand hygiene observations with feedback to staff; (3) catheter/vascular access care observations to ensure clinical staff adherence to aseptic technique and good infection control practices (with staff feedback); (4) development of staff infection prevention skills, demonstrated through competency assessments; (5) patient education and engagement in infection control processes; (6) decrease catheter prevalence; (7) catheter hub disinfection; and (8) bacitracin zinc/polymyxin B sulfate (Polysporin) triple ointment or povidone-iodine ointment applied to catheter exit sites. The CDC has also developed tools, protocol, and guidance to assist in the implementation of the interventions (https://www.cdc.gov/dialysis/prevention-tools/index.html).",

Use of a behavioral change strategy (\"Positive Deviance\"), in which positive BSI prevention practices by certain staff were encouraged among all staff, was found to contribute to the reduction of BSI in one dialysis facility. 151 Additional recommendations for preventing hemodialysis-catheter-associated infections include (1) using sterile technique and maximal sterile barrier precautions (cap, mask, sterile gown, large sterile drapes, and gloves) during catheter insertion; (2) limiting use of noncuffed catheters to 3 to 4 weeks; (3) restricting catheter manipulation and dressing changes to trained personnel; (4) replacing catheter site dressing if damp, loosened, or soiled. 148, 152 A number of studies have looked at the use of various antimicrobial locks to prevent catheter-related BSI among hemo dialysis patients. Two meta-analyses of these studies concluded that (1) antimicrobial catheter lock solutions reduce catheter-related bloodstream infections and the (2) use of these lock solutions should be considered in routine clinical practice in conjunction with other prevention modalities. 153, 154 However, the long-term consequence of using antibiotics routinely in catheter locking solutions is unknown. CDC and the Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee guidelines recommend lock solutions in patients with multiple BSIs despite optimal adherence to aseptic technique. 149 Routine prophylactic use of antimicrobial lock solutions for hemodialysis catheterrelated BSI is not recommended at this time. 148, 155 In hemodialysis patients, the Infectious Diseases Society of America has recommended treatment with nasal mupirocin in documented S. aureus carriers who have catheter-related BSI with S. aureus and continue to need a hemodialysis catheter. 156, 157 Otherwise the routine use of nasal mupirocin in patients with hemodialysis catheters is not recommended by either the CDC or the National Kidney Foundation. 137, 138, 148 The CDC also updated the Guidelines for the Prevention of Intravascular Catheter-Related Infections and included the recommendation of using chlorhexidine-impregnated dressings to protect the insertion site of short-term, nontunneled central venous catheters in patients aged 18 years and older (https://www.cdc. gov/infectioncontrol/guidelines/bsi/c-i-dressings/recommendations.html). However, no recommendations were made for patients with long-term, tunneled catheters, and the effect of chlorhexidine-impregnated dressings on reducing catheterrelated bloodstream infections among hemodialysis patients remains unclear. 158, 159 A recently developed chlorhexidine-impregnated catheter cap (ClearGuard \u00ae ) has been reported in a cluster randomized trial to reduce catheter-related BSIs and hospital admissions for BSI. 160 A needle-free connector (TEGO \u00ae needle-free hemo dialysis connector [ICU Medical, Inc., San Clemente, Calif.]) was found to be significantly associated with less intravenous antibiotic use among hemodialysis patients; however, the risk for catheter-related BSI among patients who used the connector was not statistically significantly decreased. 161 Poor injection safety practices have led to BSI among dialysis patients, and thus improving injection practices should be considered as a strategy to reduce the spread of both bloodborne viruses (e.g., hepatitis B and C) and BSIs. 147 To reduce the risk for infection, the CDC recommends (a) preparing medications in a clean room or, if a clean room is not available, in an area separated from the patient treatment area and designated for medications; (b) performing hand hygiene and using aseptic technique when preparing medication; (c) disinfecting the rubber septum of vials with alcohol and using a new needle and a new syringe to withdraw medication; (d) discarding single-dose vials and storing multidose vials appropriately; (e) not handling or storing used supplies, equipment, blood samples, or biohazard containers in or adjacent to areas where medications and clean (i.e., unused) equipment and supplies are handled; (f) delivering medications separately to each patient and not using common carts within the patient treatment area to prepare or distribute medications; and (g) performing hand hygiene, putting on new, clean gloves, scrubbing the injection port with antiseptic, and using aseptic technique when administering medications. 162 Intravenous medication vials labeled for single use, including erythropoietin, should not be punctured more than once. Multidose medication vials should be assigned to a single patient whenever possible. 163 ",

Hospital admissions for pneumonia are also 102% higher among hemodialysis patients compared with the general population. 164 In one study of a group of 433 dialysis patients over a 9-year period, pneumonia was the third most common cause of infection (after vascular access and infections below the knee) and accounted for 13% of all infections. 165 One-and five-year survival probabilities are 0.55 and 0.17, respectively.

Influenza vaccination is associated with lower risk for hospitalization and death in ESRD patients. 170 Although transmission of influenza, even during pandemics, in US dialysis clinics is not evident through the published literature, anecdotal reports of transmission exist. Because of their higher risk for complications, it is important to maintain influenza vaccination coverage among hemodialysis patients. In addition to influenza vaccination for patients, vaccination for dialysis providers (clinicians, nurses, technicians) is also important. Vaccination for healthcare personnel has been found to decrease absenteeism and healthcarefacility acquired influenza. [171] [172] [173] However, coverage among dialysis healthcare personnel was still suboptimal: data indicated that only 73% of healthcare personnel in dialysis clinics received influenza vaccination in the 2011-2012 season. 174 Annual vaccination is therefore recommended for both dialysis patients and healthcare personnel. 169 ESRD patients with latent tuberculosis (TB) infection are at higher risk for developing TB disease. For this reason, the CDC recommends that all dialysis patients be tested at least once on admission for latent TB infection or TB disease using a tuberculin skin test or TB blood test. 175 Patients who test positive should be evaluated for treatment and for the presence of TB disease. TB transmission in US dialysis facilities has been very rare. The most recently reported instance occurred in 2003 when an infected healthcare worker transmitted the bacteria to patients and other healthcare workers at a dialysis facility. 176 Another episode in 1998 involved a patient with smear-positive pulmonary TB, but no transmission to other patients at the dialysis facility was identified. 177 Suspected or confirmed TB exposure occurring within a dialysis facility should be reported to the appropriate state or local public health authority.",

The rate of invasive MRSA infections among hemodialysis patients appears to be decreasing. 198 In 2015, invasive MRSA incidence had decreased to 14.8 cases per 1000 population, still much higher than the incidence among general population. 199 A study in the United Kingdom of VAIs found that MRSA was responsible for 30% of S. aureus catheter-related infections in hemodialysis patients. 200 In the United States, 30.6% of BSIs in hemodialysis patients were caused by S. aureus and 39.5% of the S. aureus BSI isolates were methicillin-resistant strains. 127 Patients with chronic kidney disease, including end-stage renal disease, are at high risk for Clostridium difficile infection (CDI). 201 Limited data are available on CDI among dialysis patients in the United States. In a review of USRDS (Medicare claims) data between 2005 and 2008, 4.25% of dialysis patients were diagnosed with first episode of CDI. 202 In a cohort of dialysis patients followed from 1999 to 2007, 14.3% of hemodialysis patients developed CDI (a rate of 8.3 cases per 100 patient-years). 203 The UK Renal Registry reported an incidence of 1.09 CDI per 100 patient-years among hemodialysis patients in 2013-2014. 204 An outbreak of CDI in a hemodialysis facility has been reported. The outbreak investigation revealed several challenges in prevention and control of CDI among dialysis patients (e.g., shared patient environment and equipment, lack of physical barriers between patient treatment stations, and adequacy of typical cleaning and disinfection procedures). 205 CDI control strategies that were employed during this outbreak included designation of select dialysis stations as CDI contact isolation stations, use of dedicated, disposable gown and gloves by staff while caring for a patient in contact isolation, handwashing with soap and water after caring for CDI patients, use of 1:10 dilution of bleach to disinfect environmental surfaces in stations after treatment of CDI patients, and heightened diligence to ensure adequate wet contact time of bleach on surfaces.",

For certain patients, including those infected with MRSA or VRE, contact precautions are used in the hospital setting. 162 The CDC has not recommended routine use of contact precautions in hemodialysis centers for patients infected or colonized with multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs). Transmission of pathogenic bacteria is well documented in hospitals. At least one study has suggested that the majority of transmission and acquisition of resistant pathogens among dialysis patients occurs when these patients are admitted to the acute care setting. 186 However, studies have demonstrated MDRO spread in dialysis centers. 205, 206 The CDC recommends additional precautions be used during treatment of patients who might be at higher risk for transmitting pathogenic bacteria (i.e., those with an infected skin wound with drainage that is not contained by dressings or fecal incontinence or uncontrolled diarrhea). These interventions include the following: (1) Staff members treating the patient should wear a separate gown over their usual clothing and remove the gown when finished caring for the patient; (2) patients should be dialyzed at a station away from the main flow of traffic and with as few adjacent stations as possible (e.g., at the end or corner of the unit). 162 However, preventing transmission of resistant pathogens depends primarily on adherence to basic infection control practices and these additional practices. More work is needed to understand the transmission of targeted MDROs in dialysis settings and the effectiveness of interventions to reduce transmission.",

            "text": "In 2002, 63% of dialysis centers tested patients for antibodies against HCV (anti-HCV). In the facilities that performed screening, the incidence rate in 2002 was 0.34%, and among these centers, the prevalence of anti-HCV among patients was 7.8%, a decrease of 25.7% since 1995. 49 Only 11.5% of dialysis facilities reported newly acquired HCV infection among their patients. Higher incidence rates have been reported from cohort studies of dialysis patients in the United States (<1% to 3%), Japan (<2%), and Europe (3% to 15%). [217] [218] [219] [220] [221] [222] [223] [224] Higher prevalence rates (10% to >85%) also have been reported in individual facilities and in other countries. 220, [224] [225] [226] [227] [228] [229] HCV is moderately stable in the environment and can survive drying and environmental exposure to room temperature for at least 16 hours. 230 Longer survival, up to several weeks, has been reported. 231 HCV is most efficiently transmitted by direct percutaneous exposure to blood, and like HBV, the chronically infected patient is central to the epidemiology of HCV transmission. Risk factors associated with HCV infection among hemodialysis patients include blood transfusions from unscreened donors, injection drug use, low staff-topatient ratios, dialysis in a facility with high HCV prevalence, and number of years on dialysis. 217, 223, [232] [233] [234] [235] [236] The number of years on dialysis is a risk factor that is independently associated with higher rates of HCV infection. Multiple studies found that as the time patients spent on dialysis increased, their prevalence of HCV infection increased. 217, [236] [237] [238] These studies, as well as investigations of dialysis-associated outbreaks of hepatitis C infection, indicate that HCV transmission most likely occurs because of inadequate infection control practices. 239 The practices that have been found to be associated with higher prevalence of HCV in dialysis facilities include handling blood specimens near medication preparation area or other clean areas, use of a mobile cart to distribute medications, poor disinfection of priming buckets, and inconsistent cleaning of dialysis machines. 240 The CDC tracks HCV outbreaks in dialysis settings (https://www. cdc.gov/hepatitis/outbreaks/healthcarehepoutbreaktable.htm); during 1998-2008, the CDC helped investigate five outbreaks of HCV infection among patients in hemodialysis centers. 241, 242 From 2008 to 2015, 18 outbreaks involving at least 98 newly infected patients were reported to the CDC. 243 In those outbreaks a common finding was that seroconversions were associated with receiving dialysis immediately after or at a machine adjacent to a chronically infected patient. 46, 244 Multiple opportunities for cross-contamination were observed in the involved facilities, including (a) equipment and supplies that were not disinfected between patient use; (b) use of common medication carts to prepare and distribute medications at patient stations; (c) sharing of multiple dose vials, which were used at patients' stations (e.g., observed to be placed on the top of the hemodialysis machine); (d) contaminated priming buckets that were not routinely changed or cleaned and disinfected between patients; (e) machine surfaces that were not routinely cleaned and disinfected between patients; and (f) blood spills that were not cleaned up promptly. Investigation of an outbreak involving four different clusters found multiple lapses in infection control and blood contamination of environmental surfaces as a result of poor cleaning and disinfection practice. 46 In these outbreaks, a single common exposure event is rarely identified, and many outbreaks involve separate chains of transmission occurring over time. Moreover, it has been noted that station turnover procedures are rushed and disinfection of machine surfaces is initiated before the patient has left the treatment station. These common practices are challenges to proper cleaning and disinfection and prevention of cross-transmission of bloodborne pathogens such as HCV.",

Furthermore, HBV at titers of 10 2 to 10 3 virions/mL can be present on environmental surfaces in the absence of any visible blood and still cause infection. 257, [259] [260] [261] HBV is relatively stable in the environment and has been found to remain viable for at least 7 days on environmental surfaces at room temperature. 257, 259, 261 HBsAg has been detected in dialysis facilities on hemostats, scissors, dialysis machine control panels, and door knobs. 261 Thus blood-contaminated surfaces that are not routinely cleaned and disinfected represent a reservoir for HBV transmission. Dialysis staff members can transfer virus to susceptible patients through contamination in the environment. 257, 259, 261 Most HBV outbreaks among hemodialysis patients (see Table 25 .3) were caused by cross-contamination to patients via (1) environmental surfaces, supplies (e.g., hemostats, clamps, etc.), or equipment that were not routinely clean and disinfected after each use; (2) multiple-dose vials or intravenous solutions that were not used exclusively for one patient;",

            "text": "Several well-defined antigen-antibody systems are associated with HBV infection, including HBsAg and antibody to HBsAg (anti-HBs); hepatitis B core antigen (HBcAg) and antibody to HBcAg (anti-HBc); and HBeAg and antibody to HBeAg (anti-HBe). Serological assays are commercially available for all of these except for HBcAg because no free HBcAg circulates in the blood. One or more of these serological markers are present during different phases of HBV infection (Table 25 .5). 275 HBV infection can also be detected using qualitative or quantitative tests for HBV DNA. 276, 277 These tests are most commonly used for HBV-infected patients being managed with antiviral therapy. [278] [279] [280] [281] [282] In some individuals the only HBV serological marker detected is total anti-HBc (i.e., isolated anti-HBc). Among most asymptomatic persons in the United States tested for HBV infection, an average of 2% (range: <0.1% to 6%) test positive for anti-HBc 283 ; among injecting drug users, however, the rate is 24% to 28%. 284, 285 This pattern can occur after HBV infection among individuals who have recovered but whose anti-HBs have waned or among individuals who have low-level chronic HBV infection and failed to develop anti-HBs. It may also represent a false positive total anti-HBc result or someone in the window of infection. HBV DNA has been detected in <10% of individuals with isolated anti-HBc, and these individuals are unlikely to be infectious to others except under unusual circumstances involving direct percutaneous exposures to large quantities of blood (e.g., transfusion). [286] [287] [288] In most persons with isolated anti-HBc, the result appears to be false positive. Data from several studies have indicated that a primary anti-HBs response develops in most of these individuals after a three-dose series of hepatitis B vaccinations. 289, 290 No data exist on response to vaccination among hemodialysis patients with this serological pattern. Testing and follow-up recommendations for hemodialysis patients with isolated anti-HBc are available. 162",

HIV is transmitted by blood and other body fluids that contain blood. No patient-to-patient transmission of HIV has been reported in a US hemodialysis center. However, there have been reports of transmission of HIV among patients in other countries. All these outbreaks have been attributed to several breaks in infection control: (a) reuse of access needles and inadequately disinfected equipment, (b) sharing of syringes among patients, and (c) and sharing of dialyzers among different patients. [293] [294] [295] [296] [297] The most recent reported outbreak involved three new HIV infections and was associated with sharing of multidose heparin vials, inadequately disinfected hemodialysis equipment, and dialysis staff who used blood-contaminated gloves to manipulate vascular access for multiple patients. 298 Adherence to recommended infection control practices is adequate to prevent HIV transmission in dialysis facilities. 162",
