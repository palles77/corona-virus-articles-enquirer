For 152 instance, there are 122 mutations to 35 positions in the library that have log2 enrichment 153 ratios >1.5 in the nCoV-S-High sort. At least a dozen ACE2 mutations at the structurally 154 characterized interface enhance RBD binding, and may be useful for engineering highly 155 specific and tight binders of SARS-CoV-2 S, especially for point-of-care diagnostics. The 156 molecular basis for how some of these mutations enhance RBD binding can be rationalized 157 from the RBD-bound cryo-EM structure (Fig. 4C): hydrophobic substitutions of ACE2-T27 158increase hydrophobic packing with aromatic residues of S, ACE2-D30E extends an acidic 159 side chain to reach S-K417, and aromatic substitutions of ACE2-K31 contribute to an 160 interfacial cluster of aromatics. However, engineered ACE2 receptors with mutations at 161 the interface may present binding epitopes that are sufficiently different from native ACE2 162 that virus escape mutants can emerge, or they may be strain specific and lack breadth. 163 Instead, attention was drawn to mutations in the second shell and farther from the 164 interface that do not directly contact S but instead have putative structural roles. For 165 example, proline substitutions were enriched at five library positions (S19, L91, T92, T324 166and Q325) where they might entropically stabilize the first turns of helices. Proline was 167 also enriched at H34, where it may enforce the central bulge in \u03b11. Multiple mutations 168",
