The feasibility of blocking with peptides has been solidly established in other systems within the last year. A more remote possibility would be the use of anti-sense DNA or RNA to eliminate synthesis of one or more of the key peptides involved in recognition.",

Many such therapies are currently under investigation, as are attempts to correct (or compensate for) the conduction deficit which results from fluid pressure, demyelination, and the action of the products of inflammation. New therapeutic concepts are needed to correct the immunoregulatory abnormality identified in MS or the striking abnormalities of hypothalamic pituitary-adrenal function.",

Understanding at the cellular and molecular level must inevitably provide the tools which will prevent MS, stop it once it has begun or correct the physiopathologic abnormalities resulting from the disease process. The cause of MS is still unknown. One of the oldest hypotheses is that viruses may be responsible for the demyelinating lesions which characterize this disease. Over the years several viruses have been isolated from MS patients, viral antibodies have been detected in their cerebrospinal fluid or serum and viral nucleic acids have been demonstrated in CNS samples. However, no single pathogen has been reproducibly linked to the disease. In spite of this, the viral h;~othesis remains persuasive for two reasons. First, its epidemiology seems to link MS to an environmental agent, possibly a virus. Second, some animal viruses cause demyelinating diseases resembling MS. In many ii~stances, these animal models are caused by persistent infections in which the virus is present at very low levels and therefore is difficult to detect.",

In the United State~:, however, high incidence areas also coincide with the distribution of populations of Scandinavian origin and therefore could reflect the existence of susceptibility genes in these individuals. The risk of developing MS has been studied in populations who migrated from high to low incidence areas and vice versa [5, 21] .

The disease could be a rare consequence of common viral infections of childhood in genetically predisposed individuals, in which case there is no <~ MS virus >> as such. Instead, a variety of well known agents --myxoviruses, paramyxoviruses, picornaviruses, etc. --could be responsible, under special circumstances, for a unique neurological condition with clinical onset in early adulthood. The observation that a variety of animal viruses cause primary demyelination supports this idea [25] . There is also a correlation between MS and a late occurrence of childhood viral infections, suggesting that common viruses could play a role in the disease [11. On the other hand, MS could be due to a single, specific human virus which is widespread in high incidence areas, causes inapparent or minor viral illness in the majority of the population, but causes MS in a small number of genetically susceptible individuals. An example of this type of pathogenesis is the infection of mice by Thei!er's virus, an endemic murine picornavirus. In most cases, Theiler's virus causes an inapparent enteric infection, but in a small fraction of outbred animals it reaches the central nervous system where it persists for life [31] and causes an inflammatory primary demyelinating disease [4] . The genetic background of the host plays a major role in the disease, since inbred strains of mice can be either susceptible or resistant [23] .",

More interestingly, a clear association between HTLV-I infection and a chronic human neurological disease was established in 1985 [8] . Tropical spastic paraparesis (TSP), also called HTLV-I-associated myelopathy (HAM) in Japan, is a rare consequence of infection by HTLV-I. Although different from MS, the two diseases present some similarities. Both are chronic, and histopathological examination of the few cases of TSP which have been autopsied showed inflammatory demyelinating lesions in the white matter of the spinal cord [28] . Not only did seroepidemiology link TSP-HAM to HTLV-I infection, but the virus was also isolated from T lymphocytes present in the CSF of TSP patients [13, 16] .",

These activated astrocytes can present antigens [6] . These events could lead to some autoimmunizat;.m= [:4 ].

If the disease is a rare consequence of childhood viral infections m genetically susceptible individuals, it will be important to determine which of these viruses may persist, in the form of nucleic acids, in CNS or possibly in cells of the immune system. Unfortunately, a systematic search for human viral nucleic acids in a large number of MS and control cases is an extremely burdensome task which has not yet been undertaken. HOpefully, new methods such as polymerase chain reactions may facilitate these studies.",

In the past years, molecular biologists described techniques which may offer a powerful alternative to the conventional approaches to virus isolation. Subtractive cDNA hybridization has been used successful\u00b0 ly to isolate tissue-specific mRNA. F~,r example, the cloning of the T-cell receptor made use of the difference between the mRNA populations of T and B lymphocytes [12] . Because viral infections result in the expression of foreign genes in target tissues, it should be possible to isolate mRNA from unknown viruses by subtracting control4issue mRNA sequences from a cDNA library prepared with the mRNA extracted from the in. fected tissue. This approach has been tested successfully with Theiler's virus infection (:LF. Bureau and M. Brahic, in preparation).",

Nevertheless, in contrast to the situation ;n experimental models of the disease, where there has emerged a gradually increasing wealth of information about the nature of antigens involved, we still are virtually ignorant about antigens in MS. We are not even sure whether such entities as MS antigens do exist. On the other hand, the ever more detailed analysis of antigens in experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) has helped immensely not only to identify possible candidates for MS antigens, but, perhaps more importantly, to elucidate the pathogenic mechanisms of autoimmunity.The identification of antigens in EAE followed a more-or-less straightforward logical path from crude brain and spinal cord homogenate to myelin, and from there to the purified myelin proteins, proteolipid protein (PLP) and myehn basic protein (MBP). PLP is the major structural protein of brain white matter accounting for more than 50 \u00b070 of the central myelin membrane protein.",
