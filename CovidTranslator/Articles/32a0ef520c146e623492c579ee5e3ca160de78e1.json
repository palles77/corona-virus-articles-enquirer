These enzymes are capable of removing cellular receptors from the surface of target cells. Hence they are also known as \"receptor destroying\" enzymes. We have cloned and expressed several recombinant viral O-acetylesterases. These enzymes were secreted from Sf9 insect cells as chimeric proteins fused to eGFP. A purification scheme to isolate the recombinant Oacetylesterase of influenza C virus was developed. The recombinant enzymes derived from influenza C viruses specifically hydrolyze 9-O-acetylated sialic acids, while that of sialodacryoadenitis virus, a rat coronavirus related to mouse hepatitis virus, is specific for 4-O-acetylated sialic acid. The recombinant esterases were shown to specifically de-O-acetylate sialic acids on glycoconjugates. We have also expressed esterase knockout proteins of the influenza C virus hemagglutininesterase. The recombinant viral proteins can be used to unambiguously identify O-acetylated acids in a variety of assays.",

One type of modification of sialic acids is O-acetylation which occurs at the glycerol side chain carbons 7, 8, and 9. In addition, O-acetylation of the ring carbon 4 is found regularly in glycoconjugates of horses and guinea pigs. The biochemical reaction pathways of the biosynthesis of O-acetylated sialic acids are not yet fully understood. Oacetylation of glycoconjugates may involve the formation of O-acetylated CMP-Neu5Ac and subsequent conjugation by sialyltransferases [1] , or alternatively occur on the glycoconjugate itself [2] .",

            "text": "Glycoconjugates also represent receptors for the attachment of viruses. Several enveloped viruses utilize O-acetylated sialic acids for binding to target cells, the first step of viral infections. Viruses belonging to the families of the Orthomyxoviridae and Coronaviridae do not only bind to such sialic acids. In addition, they possess acetylesterase activities capable of de-O-acetylating cellular receptors. Due to this activity, the viral esterases have also been termed \"receptordestroying enzymes\". Since several of these viral proteins also mediate agglutination of erythrocytes, they are now known as hemagglutinin-esterase (HE) proteins. Among the first viruses, which were shown to initiate infections via O-acetylated sialic acids were the influenza C viruses [14] [15] [16] as well as human and bovine coronaviruses [17] . All viruses mentioned so far specifically use 9-O-acetylated sialic acids (Neu5,9Ac 2 ) as receptor determinant. Another coronavirus, hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus of swine, exhibits a similar preference towards Neu5,9Ac 2 [18] . Other coronaviruses, like mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) strains S and JHM, and puffinosis coronavirus were recently found to hydrolyze O-acetylated sialic acids. In contrast to the above mentioned viruses, they specifically hydrolyze 4-O-acetylated sialic acids (Neu4,5Ac 2 ) [19] . In this report, the enzymatic properties of the HE protein of sialodacryoadenitis virus (SDAV), a rat coronavirus, will be described. Infectious salmon anemia virus (ISAV), a putative new member of the Orthomyxoviridae, was also shown to exhibit an acetylesterase activity [20, 21] . In collaboration with Dr. Falk (Veterinary Institute, Oslo) a sialate-4-O-acetylesterase activity was identified recently [22, 23] . Most recently we found, in collaboration with Dr. de Groot and Dr. Kamerling (University of Utrecht), that torovirus HE proteins, which also exhibit an acetylesterase activity [24] , hydrolyze O-acetylated sialic acids (Smits et al., in preparation). The viruses and their Oacetylesterases are summarized in Table 1 .",

Recombinant VV-HE was isolated by selection for a thymidine kinase (\u2212) phenotype. Truncated forms lacking the cod- ing regions for the cytoplasmic domain, the transmembrane anchor, or the entire HE2 domain were constructed by restriction digests utilizing the PstI site, the HhaI site, or the ClaI site of pATAHE, respectively. The restriction sites were bluntended and religated into the SmaI site of pATAgpt3Stop, resulting in pATAHE CD, pATAHE TM, and pATAHE HE2 (Figure 1b) .",

For these experiments, we used recombinant vaccinia viruses (VV). The influenza C/Cal/78 HE gene was inserted into the thymidine kinase gene by targeted recombination as described in Materials and Methods.

HeLa cells were infected with VV-HE virus and fractionated by standard methods. Subcellular fractions were then tested for acetylesterase activity with the pNPA assay (Table 2 ). In VV-HE infected cells, esterase activity in the plasma membrane fraction was five-to six-fold higher than in the soluble cytoplasmic fraction, indicating insertion of the recombinant HE protein into the membrane. Since pNPA is also hydrolyzed by cellular esterases, some background activity was detected in VV-wt infected cells. The influenza C virus esterase is characterized as a serine esterase highly susceptible to inhibition by di-isopropyl fluorophosphate (DFP) and low reactivity with phenylmethyl- sulfonyl fluorophosphate (PMSF) [31, 32] . To confirm that enzymatic activity found in the plasma membrane fraction of VV-HE-infected cells was derived from expression of the influenza C virus esterase, we determined activities in the presence of these inhibitors. DFP treatment of membranes reduced esterase activity to background level, while PMSF treatment resulted in no significant reduction of activity in membranes of VV-HEinfected cells (Table 2 ). In addition, we also determined the correct substrate specificity of the recombinant esterase using BSM as substrate. HeLa cells (2 \u00d7 10 6 cells/dish) infected with recombinant VV were washed with PBS and incubated in the presence of 500 \u00b5l BSM (25 mg/ml) for 2 h at 37 \u2022 C. In the supernatant of VV-HE-infected cells approximately 12.8 \u00b5g free acetate was detected, while concentrations in control assays with VV-wt were below detection limits (Table 3) . Thus, the recombinant influenza C/Cal/78 HE protein is expressed at the cell surface at high levels. We therefore concluded that expression of the influenza C/Cal/78 virus HE by recombinant VV yields a biologically active glycoprotein, which is in agreement with earlier expression studies [16] . Compared to the influenza C virus HE protein, those of corona-and toroviruses are smaller in size. The latter ones resemble the HE-1 subunit and the hydrophobic N-terminus of the HE-2 subunit of the influenza C virus esterase. This prompted us to test whether expression of truncated forms of the influenza C virus HE protein results in recombinant proteins with acetylesterase activity. Constructs were prepared to test the requirement of different regions of the HE protein (Figure 1b) . We deleted the cytoplasmic domain (HE-CD), the transmembrane anchor (HE-TM), and the entire HE2 subunit except for the five amino-acid residues of the putative fusion peptide (HE-HE2). Recombinant VVs were prepared, and protein expression was determined in a pulse-chase experiment. As shown in Figure 3 , the truncated proteins were precipitated from lysates of infected HeLa cells by polyclonal antiserum. Similar to the authentic HE, additional faster migrating bands were detected in the modified proteins. During a 3 h chase these additional bands gradually disappeared. In presence of monensin which blocks the intracellular transport and glycosylation [33] , only the faster migrating forms were detected (data not shown), indicating that these bands represent unglycosylated precursors.",

In the laboratory of Dr. Varki it had been shown that expression of a chimeric influenza C virus HE fused to an immunoglobulin resulted in the constitutive expression of a secreted protein from a stable cell line [5] . In order to obtain large amounts of the recombinant esterase, we decided to use a viral vector. Due to biosafety considerations, we decided to switch to a baculovirus expression system considered biosafety level 1 while the expression by VV requires biosafety level 2 facilities. In order to further facilitate monitoring of expression, we selected a strategy yielding a chimeric protein consisting of the viral esterase and the green fluorescent protein (Figure 2 ). Recombinant baculoviruses were designed, which directed the expression of two soluble chimeric esterases (HE1/2-GFP and HE1-GFP). It had been shown earlier that inhibition of of the esterase activity of recombinant HE-Fc\u03b3 by DFP resulted in a protein which specifically binds to Neu5,9Ac 2 [5] . To avoid handling of the highly toxic DFP, we were aiming to express a recombinant protein devoid of the esterase activity. To express such a protein, we changed the codon of the active site serine residue [30, 32] to a threonine codon. By these means we constructed recombinant baculoviruses expressing HE1/2-GFP(S \u2192 T) and HE1-GFP(S \u2192 T) (Figure 2 ).",

We had hypothesized that other MHV-related coronavirus esterases are also specific for Neu4,5Ac 2 [19] . To test this hypothesis, we cloned the HE gene of rat coronavirus SDAV. The amino acid sequence of this esterase is closely related to those of different MHV strains [34] . When we expressed the chimeric SDAV HE-GFP protein in Sf9 cells, we found the recombinant enzyme was retained intracellularly and only partially secreted into the culture supernatant (data not shown). Since in several instances insect cells are unable to proteolytically cleave mammalian signal peptides [35] , we replaced the SDAV signal peptide with that of honeybee prepromelittin [26] . Expression of this construct resulted in an efficiently secreted protein, which could easily be detected by its esterase activity in a nonreducing SDS-PAGE. Interestingly, we detected several bands of the recombinant protein, indicating oligomerization ( Figure 6 ). The esterase-positive bands were observed mainly in the culture supernatant.",

From the original clone a recombinant soluble chimeric influenza C virus esterase was expressed in this laboratory and used to detect widespread but selective expression of 9-O-acetylated sialic acids in specific cell types of rat tissues [5] . In addition, 9-O-acetylation was shown to affect tissue homing of murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cells in the liver and spleen, and to block binding of complement factor H to those cells [7] . Cell surface expression of Neu5,9Ac 2 was shown to depend on the cell cycle stage of MEL cells: Entry into the G0/G1 stage causes downregulation while arrest at G2/M showed increased expression of cell surface 9-O-acetylated sialomucins but not of 9-O-acetylated gangliosides [36] . Moreover, this laboratory used the recombinant viral esterase to reveal that 9-O-acetylation of sialic acids on cell surface mucins is a novel marker on CD4 T cells that appears during maturation and is modulated downwards upon activation [8] .",

By transfecting the viral esterase into hamster melanoma cells, the same laboratory could show a substantial decrease of CD60b expression and detected major effects on proliferation, differentiation, and melanogenesis [38] . Most recently, a direct link between the formation of CD60b and the inhibition of apoptosis was established by transfecting the HE gene into a cell line overexpressing the O-acetylated ganglioside [39] .",

In contrast, when we expressed a chimeric HE1 fused to GFP, the protein was secreted into the cell culture supernatant, and it exhibited an enzymatic activity indistinguishable from that of the authentic membrane-bound viral protein. The chimeric SDAV HE protein fused to the GFP domain was also secreted into the culture supernatant of insect cells, provided that the authentic signal peptide was replaced by the homologous insect signal peptide derived from honeybee melittin. The recombinant chimeric SDAV esterase containing the melittin signal sequence was secreted into the culture supernatant, and it exhibited a specificity for glycosidically bound Neu4,5Ac 2 . Earlier, we had proposed that the group 2 coronaviruses be subdivided into group 2a and 2b according to the genomic organization and their substrate specificities for Neu4,5Ac 2 and Neu5,9Ac 2 , respectively [19] . At first glance, our finding appears to further strengthen the hypothesis that all esterases related to the proposed group 2a coronaviruses are specific for Neu4,5Ac 2 . It should be mentioned that we have in the meantime analyzed additional coronavirus esterases and found that coronaviruses regularly exchange their HE genes during evolution (Smits et al., in preparation).",

            "text": "The recombinant esterases described in this report are capable of de-O-acetylating sialic acids. Techniques involving fluorescent RP-HPLC cannot unambiguously discriminate between Neu5,9Ac 2 and Neu4,5Ac 2 due to their similar Rf values [9] . Currently, the only method to distinguish these sialic acid derivatives are restricted to the use of mass spectrometry in the impact mode. Due to the required expensive equipment, these techniques are not commonly available. Application of the described recombinant enzymes offers an alternative to identify unambiguously Neu5,9Ac 2 and Neu4,5Ac 2 in many different applications, including HPLC techniques, histochemical de-Oacetylation and subsequent staining with probes specific for the de-O-acetylated derivatives of sialic acids, de-O-acetylation of gangliosides on HPTLC plates, etc. Such applications may in the future facilitate experiments aiming to increase knowledge of the functions of viral esterases during virus replication, and of the biological functions of O-acetylation in the control of the cell cycle in the progression of malignant and metastasizing cancer (e.g. melanoma), and during the development of the central nervous system. In the past, the influenza C virus HE1-GFP protein has already been successfully applied to the identification of Neu5,9Ac 2 at the surface of Leishmania promastigotes [40] . With the expression of a recombinant esterase specific for Neu4,5Ac 2 , we now provide a tool to identify another sialic acid derivative. Data on the function of Neu4,5Ac 2 are still limited. It is found in high amounts in horses and guinea pigs [41] . The finding that Neu4,5Ac 2 is the substrate for group 2a coronaviruses [19] suggested that it must be detectable in mice. Indeed, we recently found Neu4,5Ac 2 by GC-MS analysis in virtually all mouse organs susceptible for MHV (Rinninger et al., in preparation). We now present data that a recombinant rat coronavirus esterase also hydrolyzes Neu4,5Ac 2 indicating that rats may also express substantial amounts of this sialic acid. By using a combination of HPLC and ESI-MS, Morimoto et al. recently reported its presence in the sublingual and submaxillary glands of rats and in the intestine of mice [42] . Moreover, it presumably also exists in teleosts [22, 23] . In a recent investigation, Neu4,5Ac 2 was also found in human erythrocytes [43] .",
