We present a streamlined protocol in which lengthy mRNA purification steps are replaced with faster precipitation and ultrafiltration alternatives; additionally, other purification steps are entirely eliminated by using a reconstituted translation system and by performing reverse transcription after selection, which also protects input polypeptides from thermal denaturation. We tested this procedure by performing affinity selection against Her2 using binary libraries containing a nonspecific designed ankyrin repeat protein (DARPin) doped with a Her2-binding DARPin (dopant fraction ranging from 1:10 to 1:10,000). The Her2-binding DARPin was recovered in all cases, with an enrichment factor of up to two orders of magnitude per selection round. The time required for one round is reduced from 4-7 days to 2 days with our protocol, thus simplifying and accelerating mRNA display experiments.",

            "text": "1a). The 5' untranslated region (5' UTR), taken from the modified ribosome display vector pRDV2, 11 contains a T7 promoter and a Shine-Dalgarno ribosome binding site (RBS). This 5' UTR drives strong transcription by T7 RNA polymerase as well as efficient translation by E. coli ribosomes, and has been shown to work in both crude extract 1 and a cell-free reconstituted system 12 . Since the minimal translation system used in this work (discussed below) contains reconstituted components from the E. coli translational machinery, it is necessary to replace the tobacco mosaic virus translational enhancer commonly used with the eukaryotic rabbit reticulocyte lysate in mRNA display with the Shine-Dalgarno RBS to allow efficient translation with the prokaryotic E. coli components. 13, 14 After in vitro transcription, mRNA is traditionally purified using denaturing PAGE ( Figure   1b ). 2, 4 While effective at separating full-length RNA transcripts from truncated RNA and PCR primers, this method requires lengthy steps and manual excision from the gel. Instead, we use lithium chloride (LiCl) precipitation to isolate transcribed mRNA, a technique that has been used to purify mRNA prior to in vitro translation. 3 LiCl selectively precipitates RNA from unwanted DNA, 15 smaller RNA, unincorporated NTPs, and proteins, 16 thus enabling rapid purification while minimizing the number of processing steps during which detrimental nucleases and proteases could be introduced.",

Instead, we utilize the repertoire of commercially available ultrafiltration devices to quickly purify the mRNA-DNA-puromycin molecules from the DNA splint and unligated DNA-puromycin linkers, which can interfere with the subsequent translation reaction if not removed. 4 Although ultrafiltration cannot separate mRNA-DNApuromycin molecules from unligated mRNA molecules, this limitation is also encountered in PAGE purification with templates longer than 500 nucleotides. 4 Furthermore, any mRNA molecules lacking puromycin will not be able to covalently attach to their corresponding polypeptide sequences and therefore will not be erroneously enriched during the selection step. We have successfully purified the desired product using Amicon Ultra-0.5 mL (Millipore) or Vivaspin 500 (Sartorius) ultrafiltration columns, which are available in a range of molecular weight cutoffs (30-300 kDa) that enable their use across a broad range of construct sizes. In the current proof-of-principle studies, a 100 kDa ultrafiltation device can effectively remove the splint and unligated linkers (9.5 kDa) while retaining the mRNA-DNA-puromycin molecules (170-210 kDa) with a yield of 85-90%.",

However, cell lysates are not ideal for reproducibly achieving high-complexity libraries because they contain endogenous RNases and proteases and time-intensive optimization procedures must be applied to correct for the inherent batch-to-batch variability. These limitations can be overcome by using a minimal E.coli-based translation system reconstituted from purified components (PURExpress\u2122, New England Biolabs) (Figure 1d ). The fully defined PURExpress system offers better reproducibility, lack of nucleases and proteases, and a high concentration of ribosomes. These characteristics maximize the number of intact selection particles, increasing the likelihood of a successful selection. The resulting mRNA display particles can be used directly in selection experiments without additional purification steps (Figure 1e ).",

We delay RT until after selection because the displayed proteins may be adversely affected by the elevated temperatures required during the RT process, including initial thermal denaturation of the RNA template and high-temperature incubation with the reverse transcriptase ( Figure 1f ). Postponing RT also eliminates an additional purification step, as RT products can be used directly in subsequent PCR amplification but require a gel filtration step if RT is done prior to selection, further streamlining the procedure. However, since it is possible that delaying the RT step may allow for enrichment of RNA aptamers in addition to polypeptide binders in some affinity selections, an additional selection round can be performed with RT prior to selection to specifically isolate the polypeptide binders. Since the polypeptide binders should be substantially enriched at this point, the adverse effects of RT can be better tolerated than in initial rounds in which binders are scarce. Alternatively, DNA primers that are complementary to conserved regions of the mRNA can be added prior to selection to destabilize any RNA aptamers in the pool.",

These binary libraries were subjected to selection against immobilized Her2. After two to three rounds of our streamlined mRNA display protocol, the Her2binding DARPin was selectively enriched, as evidenced by agarose gel electrophoresis visualization of the RT-PCR products ( Figure 2 ). Since RT-PCR of the original 1:100 mRNA mixture shows no discernible signal for H10-2-G3 but the original 1:10 mixture shows a faint yet clear lower band, we infer that the enrichment factor in these selection experiments is as high as two orders of magnitude.

In addition to a number of simplifications in purification steps, the procedure postpones the RT step until after selection, which has the additional benefit of protecting displayed polypeptides from thermal denaturation. Wherever possible, complex or poorly regulated steps in the procedure have been replaced with simple, robust alternatives. Importantly, in applying these procedural simplifications, we have not compromised the achievable library size (~10 14 ) or the enrichment capability of mRNA display. Furthermore, any of our streamlined steps can be readily reverted to the older procedures if there are additional constraints specific to a given experiment. Whether the entire protocol or only selected individual steps are adopted, this new protocol should enable faster and easier in vitro directed evolution experiments.",
