The idea is simple: in the absence of a vaccination for a novel infectious disease one tries to flatten the incidence curve to such an extent that the daily number of cases that require medical assistance is kept below the capacity of the health care system. The long term goals are to obtain a sufficiently large fraction of the population that has become infected and to reach herd immunity which would lead to a less severe or even subcritical second outbreak wave. On the other hand, an extinction strategy would aim at introducing sufficient contact reductions to keep the epidemic subcritical and not lifting these restrictions until the disease becomes extinct.",

The case fatality rate seems to depend heavily on the quality of treatment and is currently (at the time of writing) estimated to be between 1.4 and 5 percent 5 .

            "text": "In this article, we study the likelihood of success of such strategies, based on a semi-realistic microsimulation model for the spread of COVID-19. Simulations with census based household compositions and age distribution were carried out for Germany and Poland and for two representative major cities, Berlin and Wroc law. Microsimulations are considered an appropriate tool to describe complex structures of infection paths and disease progression and have been performed in the past for influenza 7 and recently also for Covid-19 8 . Our model summarises the net effect of all secondary infections caused by an infected individual outside its own household into an out-reproduction number R* which is the only free parameter in our model. We assume that the interactions within the household are hardly affected by social distancing strategies. Thus, the R* parameter best reflects the strength of nonpharmaceutical interventions. The stronger the interventions, the lower the R*. The mitigation strategy, however, needs to allow R* to be high enough to enable the population to reach herd immunity. We show that that the margin of R* for which successful mitigation into an overcritical but not ICU capacity-threatening epidemic can be achieved is extremely narrow, implying that this strategy is likely to fail. Moreover, we quantify the average extent to which social contacts have to be reduced in the population to achieve reasonable times for disease extinction. We present estimates in the case of subcritical epidemics for time till extinction as a function of R* and the initial number of infected individuals. The time till extinction has direct economic implications and depends strongly on R*, showing the critical importance of introducing strong social distancing measures. For Germany, at least an 80% reduction of social contacts outside households is required for the epidemic to become subcritical, and with this reduction, the time to disease extinction amounts to more than a year. An extinction time shorter than a year is only possible with a reduction of social contacts by more than 95 %. For the city of Wroc law we additionally discuss the combined effect of testing coverage and social contact reduction. High testing rates -defined here as the rate of uncovering mild cases -and household quarantine of positive cases allow for less stringent contact reduction but are on their own not sufficient to guarantee a subcritical progression of the epidemic. Finally, we estimate R* for the present situation in both countries under the assumption that no further spread-preventing actions are taken. Comparing the ratio of the present R* value with the value at which the epidemic becomes subcritical is a good indicator for the strengths of non-pharmaceutical interventions for a suc-cessful extinction strategy. For end-prevalence in the overcritical parameter domain we were able to derive theoretical predictions which match very well with the simulation results. The theoretical results show the strong impact which differences in the household size distribution have on the prevalence and demonstrate complementary to the numerical results how sensitive the prevalence depends on R* (see Appendix C).",

            "text": "We use an individual based SIR model to describe the spread of COVID-19. Compared to classical ODE models of epidemic spread, microsimulations have the advantage of a better representation of epidemiologically relevant heterogeneity in the population. In addition, the description of the individual disease progression can be used to study the impact of complex countermeasures such as extensive backtracking, testing and quarantine. The model is a non-Markov stochastic process in continuous time based on the infection probability of susceptibles in contact with infected individuals. The contact structure outside of households is represented as an inhomogeneous directed random graph where each node corresponds to an infected individual and the degree of that node corresponds to the number of secondary infections created by that individual. The degree itself depends on how long the individual stays infectious (infectivity time). Population structure: Our sample population is based on the census data on the census data (2011) as well as more recent official statistics (2019) from Poland 17-19 and a synthetic reproduction of the microcensus in Germany (2014) 9 (see Appendix A) and involves age and household composition. For the relative frequencies of the household sizes see Supplement A. Sample populations were used to represent two major cities with typical urban household structures: Wroc law and Berlin. Since we focus on a conceptual question, more detailed structures like spatial assignment, gender, profession or comorbidity relevant health status are omitted. Disease progression within patients: The Covid-19 progression within patients is modelled according to the present medical knowledge. The incubation time is assumed to follow a lognormal distribution with median 3.92 and variance 5.516 [lognormal parameters: shape=0.497, loc=0.0, scale=3.923]. The age dependence of the probability to be hospitalised or to have severe progression or to have critical progression with requirement for ICU treatment is given in Table 1 . Table 1 : Age dependence of the probability to develop a certain level of symptoms. The probability for death was assumed to be 49% within the critical patients.",

The maximal duration of the infectious period is assumed to be 14 days 12 . Contact structure and infection transport: Within the households we assume a clique contact structure. Empirical studies have shown that a large fraction of secondary infections are taking place within households 13 . We hence assumed that the probability of a household member to become infected by an already infected household member, who is infectious within a time interval of length T , scales as 1 \u2212 exp(\u2212T /L) and L + 1 is the household size. Here, the time T is measured in days. Outside of the households we assume that infected individuals create on average c \u00b7 T secondary infections, given that all contacts of these individuals are susceptible, where c is an intrinsic parameter. Note the time T being infectious is different for contacts inside and outside the household. The out-reproduction number R* is defined as the expectation of c \u00b7 T , which is equal to 2.34c under our assumptions of disease progression within patients. The actual number of secondary infections of an individual outside the household is assumed to be Poisson distributed with mean (c \u00b7 T ). The total reproduction number R 0 is given by the sum of R* and the number of secondary infections generated inside the household. The duration of the infectivity time T implicitly depends on age. This is due to the fact that infectivity time is reduced for individuals with severe disease progression, as those patients become hospitalized. Se-5 .

The outside household contact structure was intentionally chosen to be simple in order to have only one relevant and easily interpretable parameter in the model. We do not consider super-spreading events that could enhance the progression of the epidemic. Such events might have a strong impact at the beginning of an epidemic outbreak but, as the number of cases increases, the mean number of secondary infections R will dominate the evolution. Testing and quarantine: For Wroc law we included additional model features to study the effect of testing followed by household quarantine in case the testing was positive. We assume that individuals with severe symptoms will always be detected and individuals with mild symptoms will be detected with probability q two days after the onset of symptoms. A detection is followed up by quarantine of the corresponding household with the effect that all out-household contacts by members of those households are stopped. The parameter q can be interpreted as the likelihood that a person with characteristic mild symptoms will be tested for COVID-19. We did not consider the effect of backtracking in this article since it is a prevention strategy mainly applied during the early and final phases of the epidemic.

This value is transferred into an average per day growth rate of prevalence, as it is reported by most health offices in their daily situation reports. An average per day growth rate was calculated from the first 50 days of the epidemic. We defined R max as the smallest R* value for which 10 sample paths surpassed the ICU threshold within D days. For cities D was chosen to be 200 days and for countries 700 days. The critical value R min was defined as the largest R * < R max for which the daily incidence at day 200 was below 50% of the initial number N o of infected (N o = 100 for Wroc law, N o = 1000 for Berlin, N o = 1000 for Poland and N o = 15000 for Germany).

Social distancing measures imposed by state authorities can hardly be fine-tuned enough to hit this critical interval precisely. Furthermore, herd immunity within these intervals is at best 15% percent of the population and would hence not provide sufficient protection for a second epidemic wave. The main reason for the narrowness of the mitigation interval as well as for the low critical value R min is the household structure. Infections within the households for patients with mild progression can hardly be avoided and therefore a small number of infection links between the households can already make the epidemic overcritical. In the subcritical domain we observe a strong dependence of time till extinction on the outreproduction number R*. Reasonable extinction times are only achievable for very low values below 1/3 secondary infections outside of households. We conclude that instead, an extinction strategy implemented by quick, effective 11 .

If social distancing countermeasures are too weak there is a high risk of collapse of the public health system within a very short period of time. If contact reduction is not kept in force until disease extinction a second epidemic outbreak may result 8 . Therefore, in order to control the epidemics it is nessesary to wait until it gets extinct. The application of an epidemic management plan based on a flawed strategy of herd immunity may easily lead to an uncontrollable epidemic. We also strongly advise combining social distancing and contact related countermeasures with an extensive testing strategy including individuals with characteristic symptoms but unknown contact history.",

To find the R* under the present model that fits the observed evolution of cases in Germany and Poland and also for Wroc law and Berlin the following procedure was followed. First a very sparse grid of possible R* was chosen to see the evolution of the stochastic microsimulation over time. As the observed data from 5th March till 20th March were available, the increase from a starting number of infected persons to the final number, as of 20th March, should have occurred within these 16 days. To show the narrowness of the possible parameters an example for this procedure will be made for the federal state of Berlin. In Figure  A .6 the box-plots of the duration are plotted for obtaining an increase of 13 (5th March, Berlin) to 848 (20th March , Berlin) in 16 days. Values above the horizontal line at 16 indicate that R* is too low, as it takes too long to take the evolution, and values below 16 state that R* is too high, as it evolves faster than the observed values. However, as we are dealing with a stochastic microsimulation it is clear that the outcome after a given time is not deterministic, but may vary quite a lot. Therefore, the dots indicate the average duration to perform the above said evolution. From this Figure A.6 13 .

To validate this, we then look at the different runs and compare it with the observed values in a semilog plot as is usual for exponential growth functions. This plot is given for Berlin in Figure A.7 . Each blue line represents one simulation run. The simulation started with 5 infected persons. As can be seen, as usual in stochastic microsimulations, it takes some time till the dynamic of the simulation stabilizes, which is definitely already the case when 13 infected persons are reached in the average of runs. This point is indicated as the 5th March where this number of infected individuals was observed in Berlin. As can be seen from the graph, the red line indicating the observed values lies in the center of the simulation path. So we are confident that this R*=3.883 is a good approximation to the actual R* in Berlin. Similarly, the R* are gathered for Poland R*=3.159 (5th of March until 21th of March) and Germany R*=3,041. Note that the epidemic in Wroc law is still in such an early stage that the case numbers do not yet allow a reliable estimation.
