Within the laboratory there is restricted access to human immunodeficiency virus test results to guarantee patient confidentiality. Retention of a hard-copy of specimen request cards ensures the availability of the original clinical information. The data base is copied on a second file server to facilitate searches, and daily streaming onto magnetic tape provides system protection in the event of hard disc failure. Matching of old and new patient records is done by surname, date of birth, and sex, and therefore duplicate records accumulate when patient names are misspelt on specimen request forms. The system requires further development to speed searches of the data base and to achieve automatic generation of laboratory worksheets. Future goals are the replacement of hard-copy records of clinical information and hard-copy reporting with on-line access to hospital data bases and on-line requesting by and reporting to the clinician.",

The lirst two alternatives pose difficulties with restriction of access to confidential data, and all three options are expensive and require the de novo generation of a complex software package. We describe a low-cost self-contained data base developed for a large diagnostic virology laboratory using a network of personal computers.

These office day books are also used to record by hand the issuing of reports (as a parallel to the results record on the computer) and to detail the subsequent destination of the request card (files or further tests). Second, three other hard copies of the entries for that day are produced in laboratory number order, again one for each specimen category (Fig. 2b) .

En retrospect other matching criteria could perhaps have been included as patients whose date of birth is not supplied and misspelt names are not matched. At present duplicate records for the same patient may easily be created, but many are later paired when new and old request cards are matched or when the computer data base is compared with the stored request cards.

The generation of hard copy reports represents a major labour-saving achievement in a laboratory performing a large number of different tests. Prior to computerisation, our laboratory reports were either hand-or type-written. A photocopy was then sent to the clinician and the original retained in the laboratory files. Now duplicate reports are generated automatically. The availability of a large number of different report styles allows the reporting and printing of virus isolation, serology, and chlamydia detection results using a single report format. Memoranda can be added at the time of report printing, though this facility is currently little used because each memorandum must be typed individually.",

If inappropriate tests are done or patient records are not paired because of misinterpretation of information on the request card, the oversight is more easily corrected if a hard copy is available. Also the laboratory staff can continue to educate clinicians on the need for accurate, legible information on request cards and the same staff can also learn from their own mistakes.

If all health care units maintain long-term patient records, we may no longer need our own long-term data storage facilities. On-line access to reliable clinical information enterred by the referring clinician onto a hospital data base linked to our computer network will allow senior staff in the laboratory to validate results on a visual display unit and add interpretative comments before on-line reporting of the results. Automated linking of a report with a particular memorandum or interpretative comment, and use of codes to speed the entry of memoranda and comments, will also be possible. The need for confidentiality will nonetheless remain. On-line test and results requesting must only be available to appropriate health care staff via a set of personalised passwords.
