Indeed, it is misleading to use the term 'system' when in fact there are many health-care systems, sometimes operating simultaneously, within the same country. For this reason, intergovernmental cooperation among the federal, provincial, and territorial governments -along with significant nongovernmental health-care stakeholders -is so prominent in the financing, administration, and delivery of public health care in Canada. This article describes the political and administrative organization of health care in Canada, including its intergovernmental dimensions for conventional as well as alternative medicine and public health, and the relationship of each with conventional illness care. Since Canadians have played a major role in the development of the determinants of health approach to health policy internationally, this history is briefly recounted.",

Under the constitution of Canada, the provinces have the primary jurisdiction over health care.

To enforce and uphold the Canada Health Act, the federal government makes cash transfers to the provinces, portions of which it can deduct from the transfers to provinces if they permit or encourage facilities or physicians to charge user fees for medically necessary and/or required services or breach the five broad principles of public administration, comprehensiveness, universality, portability, and accessibility as defined in the Canada Health Act (Figure 2 ).",

Most physicians, for example, are responsible for their own private practices and clinics, and receive their remuneration through a fee schedule negotiated between these governments and the provincial medical associations. Most of the health professions are self-regulated under provincial government laws that set out a general framework under which the professions operate. Many health facilities, including nursing homes and other long-term care institutions, home care and community care organizations, medical laboratories, and diagnostic clinics are privately owned and administered. The majority are community-based not-for-profit organizations but some are private for-profit enterprises conducted on a commercial basis.

            "text": "Until recently, almost all hospitals in Canada were owned and administered at the local level by municipalities or private not-for-profit corporations, including religious-based organizations. However, some (but not all) of these hospitals have recently been subsumed by new public arm's-length organizations known as regional health authorities (RHAs), which were established by the provinces beginning in the late 1980s. This change, commonly referred to as regionalization in Canada, involved the provincial governments carving up their respective territories into geographic regions and then creating RHAs to administer the delivery of a continuum of health services, from hospitals and nursing homes to home care and public health. As arm's-length public organizations established under provincial law, RHAs have a mandate to meet the health needs of the populations within their boundaries as both purchasers and providers of services. The type and extent of services purchased from independent facilities or professionals vary considerably among RHAs and among provinces. As can be seen in Table 1 , the population size of RHAs varies considerably from province to province. Although the provincial governments are responsible for administering most public health care in Canada, the federal government nonetheless plays a critical role in health care beyond upholding the broad principles and conditions under the Canada Health Act. These other activities include: funding health research; collecting health data through Statistics Canada; financing and administering health services for First Nations people and Inuit, inmates of federal penitentiaries, war veterans, and active members of the Canadian armed forces and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police; as well as regulating the pharmaceutical and natural health products industries.",

The further west one travels in Canada, the more popular are nonbiomedical therapies. In addition, the intensity of their use is correlated with individuals with higher income and higher education, and with women more than men (McFarland et al., 2002) . In 2004, the federal government, through the Natural Health Products Directorate in Health Canada, began regulating and approving traditional herb products, vitamins and mineral supplements, and homeopathic preparations. consequence, Canadian governments at the federal and provincial levels have been highly reliant on intergovernmental collaboration to administer, deliver, and reconfigure public health care. At the apex of this collaboration is the Conference of Federal-Provincial-Territorial Ministers of Health as well as a mirror committee of deputy ministers of health (O'Reilly, 2001) . In addition to this committee structure, intergovernmental organizations with specific health-care mandates and varying degrees of independence from their sponsoring governments have been established in recent years. The federal government regulates the safety of food and pharmaceutical products through Health Canada and the Food and Drugs Act, and the prices of patented pharmaceutical products through the Patented Medicine Prices Review Board. Since the provincial governments operate their own prescription drug programs, most of which are categorical programs targeting seniors and the poor, they in turn attempt to control cost by limiting the number and type of pharmaceuticals placed on provincial formularies. A minority of provinces have instituted reference-based pricing policies, in which only the lowercost therapeutic alternative is subsidized in full by the provincial drug plan. To manage the jurisdictional and policy overlaps in pharmaceutical regulation, the federal and provincial governments work through an intergovernmental body known as the Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health (CADTH). Conducting clinicaland cost-effectiveness studies under a Common Drug Review, CADTH makes formulary listing recommendations to all provincial governments with the exception of Quebec. Through the Canadian Optimal Medication Prescribing and Utilization Service, CADTH promotes evidence-based best practices in pharmaceutical prescribing and use. Finally, CADTH conducts a major health technology assessment program for a broad range of prescription drugs, medical devices, and other similar health technologies to assist all jurisdictions in decisions concerning the purchase of new health technologies on the basis of both clinical and cost-effectiveness.",

Established in 2001, Canada Health Infoway emerged out of the desire of federal, provincial, and territorial ministers of health to accelerate the development of electronic health records in all jurisdictions. In 2003, the Health Council of Canada was created to provide both an assessment of progress in priority areas of health reform, as identified by the prime minister and the premiers of the provinces and territories, as well as make recommendations for future health reform on a national basis. Beginning its work in 2005, the Canadian Patient Safety Institute was established to provide systematic evidence on medical errors and initiate change to improve patient safety throughout Canada.",

Of the C$142 billion spent on health in 2005, approximately $99 billion was public health care financed and administered by the provincial and federal governments. Of this sum, roughly $56 million was spent on medically necessary or required hospital and physician services. As insured services under the Canada Health Act, they are made universally available to all Canadians without user fees on the same terms and conditions. Total health-care expenditures have now reached 10% of Canada's gross domestic product. As can be seen in Table 2 , much of this growth can be attributed to mixed and private (i.e., non-Canada Health Act) goods and services including prescription drugs, home care services, long-term institutional services including nursing homes for seniors, dental services, vision care, as well as nonmedical goods and services. Whereas the first three categories of services may be subsidized by provincial governments for some of their residents, the other categories of health services and products are largely provided through the market and paid for through a combination of private insurance and out-of-pocket payments by consumers.",

At the same time, a new Health Promotion Directorate within the federal Department funded and supervised cost-shared projects with citizen groups to pilot the new approach to health determinants. Although the projects at the local, regional, and national level initially focused on encouraging lifestyle changes, they eventually targeted larger societal and structural changes. This work had a profound impact on Health and Welfare Canada's Framework for Health Promotion as well as the major contributions of Canada to the World Health Organization's first international conference on health promotion and the release of the Ottawa Charter for Health Promotion, both of which appeared in 1986 (Epp, 1986; Boyce, 2002) .

As a consequence, it did not fare well when faced with its first major crisis of the twenty-first century.",

By August of that year, there were 400 probable and suspect SARS cases in Canada, as well as 44 deaths in the greater Toronto area. Health-care workers were among the most vulnerable and three of the 100 SARS-infected health-care workers ultimately died. As the hardest-hit country outside of the Asian continent, Canada became the focus of international attention, with the World Health Organization recommending against nonessential travel to Toronto for almost a month during the worst part of the crisis. As a consequence of the problems of coordination and communication associated with the public health response by the city of Toronto and the governments of Ontario and Canada, Health Canada established a National Advisory Committee on SARS and Public Health chaired by Dr. David Naylor of the University of Toronto. The mandate of the Naylor Committee went beyond recommendations on how to organize responses to infectious diseases crises in the future to providing directional recommendations on the future of public health in Canada. Influenced by the coordinating function of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States, the Naylor Committee recommended the establishment of a national public health agency in Canada (Health Canada, 2003) . The federal government established the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) in 2004. Although created as a government department separate from Health Canada, PHAC reports directly to the federal Minister of Health and is headed up by a Chief Public Health Officer. Although cities, provincial governments, and RHAs have long had chief public health officers, this was the first national officer for the country as a whole.",

When compared to the United States, in particular, both factors -socioeconomic status as measured by income, education, and occupation, and access based on medical rather than income -combine to produce better health outcomes (Lasser et al., 2006) . However, the poor health status associated with the majority of Canada's Aboriginal peoples, many of whom are economically, geographically, and socially marginalized, has nonetheless resulted in an enormous health disparity within the Canadian population (Adelson, 2005) . In terms of health-care organization, Canada is in the mid-range of OECD countries in terms of the extent to which its system is publicly financed and administered. During the early to mid-1990s, access to, and the quality of, some health services were impaired as a result of government budget cutbacks. As a consequence, public confidence in the system was eroded although most Canadians remained committed to the solidarity principles underlying Medicare (Romanow, 2002) . Since the late 1990s, both federal and provincial governments have been reinvesting in public health care in an effort to improve quality and reduce waiting time. As a consequence, as can be seen in Table 5 , patient satisfaction has improved, albeit gradually.",

In reality, most of the cost drivers appear to be in the mixed and private categories of health services rather than Medicare services. In particular, the growth of private and public prescription drug plans has been in excess of double the rate in growth of hospital and physician expenditures. Despite this, most media and think tank commentators continue to focus on Medicare, occasionally suggesting alternatives to the current single-payer model of administration. These arguments were given considerable political support in a recent Supreme Court of Canada judgment. In the now famous Chaoulli case, the court concluded that the Quebec government's prohibition on private insurance for Medicare services violated the province's Charter of Rights in a situation in which a patient waits an unreasonable amount of time for elective surgery. While the decision is not likely to lead to private, multipayer insurance for Medicare services, it has fueled the ongoing debate concerning the appropriate divide between the public and the private sector in financing, administration, and delivery of health care in Canada.",

            "text": "The adult human body consists of approximately 60 trillion cells. The rate of proliferation and growth of this vast number of cells are under strict regulation and are highly coordinated. However, in rare cases, a few cells in a particular organ escape this tight regulation of growth, start uncoordinated proliferation, acquire invasive and metastatic properties, and become cancerous. The incidence of cancer rises exponentially with age in humans (Ries et al., 2006) . As shown in Fi gu re 1 , until age 35, the incidence of cancer is 0.2% in the general population. This incidence rises to about 1.5% at ages 50-60. The maximum incidence of cancer, which is close to 5%, occurs between ages 70 and 80. Therefore, cancer tends to develop after 50 years of age, which is halfway from the 100th year, the maximum lifespan of humans. In addition, women tend to have twice the incidence of cancer at age 30-50 than men, although this trend reverses after age 50. After age 85, there tends to be a slight decline in the incidence of cancer.The genetic basis of this increased incidence of cancer with age is unclear. Recent progress in aging and cancer research suggests that errors accumulated in DNA during each round of replication, together with several other genetic and epigenetic factors, are involved in the increased risk of cancer with advanced age. In addition to genetic factors such as the accumulation of mutations in DNA, epigenetic factors, such as methylation of DNA and acetylation or deacetylation of histones, which do not affect DNA sequence per se, but change the expression of genes, also contribute to various diseases, including cancer (reviewed in Jones and Laird, 1999) . Other factor s that may contribute to the age-dependent increase in cancer incidence are DNA",
