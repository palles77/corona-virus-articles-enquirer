            "text": "Viral envelope glycoproteins are oligomeric and the quaternary structure is critical for their membrane fusion activity. Typically the transmembrane glycoproteins of class I fusion proteins contain the oligomerization domains and the surface glycoproteins (SU) are monomeric. However, it has been previously demonstrated [J. Biol. Chem. 277 (2002) 19727] that the SU of a murine hepatitis coronavirus (MHV) forms dimers, the dimerization domain overlaps the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and that this dimeric state is important for binding to receptor molecules that initiates entry into cells. We have previously expressed various soluble fragments of the SARS-CoV SU and identified stably folded fragments (residues 272-537) that contain the RBD [Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 312 (2003) 1159]. Here, we further characterize these and other fragments in an attempt to identify possible dimerization domains and their role for membrane fusion. We demonstrate that the SU and a shorter 260-amino acid N-terminal fragment (residues 17-276), which folds independently, form dimers. In contrast to the previously characterized MHV SU dimerization, this fragment is upstream and distinct from the RBD. Its deletion abolished S-mediated cell membrane fusion but retained the SUreceptor-binding function indicating the possibility for a role in post-receptor binding steps of the virus entry mechanism. Interestingly, the whole soluble S ectodomain (Se) that contains the dimerization domain but not the transmembrane domain and the cytoplasmic tail forms trimers suggesting the existence of a trimerization domain in the TM subunit in its prefusion state that may lead to a conformation unfavorable for formation of higher-order multimeric structures. These results demonstrate the existence of SU dimers and Se trimers, and indicate the possibility for an unknown mechanism of their role in entry. They also further characterize the S-mediated membrane fusion and could be important for understanding the mechanisms of virus entry, and in the development of therapeutics and vaccines.",

However, a dimeric state of S1 with a trimeric S2 could theoretically lead to higher order oligomers in dependence on the availability of the dimerization binding site in the context of the native S glycoprotein. To test such a possibility we measured approximately the size of the soluble S ectodomains (Se) where the transmembrane domain and the cytoplasmic tail were deleted [5] by gel filtration. The data shown in Fig. 5 demonstrate the existence of a trimeric state of Se (Mw 512 kDa) and lack of higher order oligomers. These results not only suggest that the Se and perhaps the full-length membrane-associated S are trimers in their native unbound state but also indicate that the dimerization site in S1 is not readily available for inter-trimer interactions.",

It has been previously reported that some attachment SU subunits of class I fusion proteins that bind receptor molecules can form dimers including gp120 of the retrovirus HIV-1 [17] and S1 of the coronavirus MHV [16] . What is the role of S1 dimerization for mediation of membrane fusion however remains unclear. It is now generally accepted that soluble ectodomains (gp140) of the HIV-1 and SIV envelope glycoproteins (Env) form trimers [18] although dimers and tetramers can be observed [19] . Similarly, it appears that at least a possible fusion intermediate quaternary structure of coronaviruses including the SARS-CoV of S2 is trimeric [12, 13] . However, remarkably it was reported that the MHV S2 protein is monomeric after dissociation from S1 [16] . Dimer-to-trimer transitions play a critical role in the mechanism of fusion mediated by class II fusion proteins. Thus, it has been proposed that changes in the quaternary structure of some coronaviruses may play a role in the fusion mechanism [16] . One should note that both the HIV-1 Env and the MHV S glycoprotein are cleaved and the SU can dissociate from the TM subunit although such dissociation may not be important for fusion. In contrast, the SARS-CoV S is not cleaved when expressed in membrane associated or soluble form and cleavage may not be required for fusion. Thus, al-though the SARS-CoV S glycoprotein is a class I fusion protein, the lack of cleavage is an exception from the rule that the Envs of class I fusion proteins are cleaved presumably to confer a metastable high-energy state that could drive the fusion reaction.",

Even if in the trimer two of the monomers form a dimer, then the third one could be free to interact with a ''free'' monomer from another trimer and form a dimer of trimers. In another possible scenario the orientation of each of the monomers in the trimer may not allow formation of dimers in the trimer but leave ''free'' binding sites for dimerization with monomers from other trimers. In this case one might expect the formation of a network of trimers. Finally, the three-dimensional structure of the trimer may not allow any interactions of the monomer dimerization sites with other monomers in the same or different trimer. We have not observed higher order oligomers under our gel filtration conditions indicating that under those conditions either intratrimer dimerization occurs but the third monomer conformation does not allow interactions with monomers from other trimers or such interactions are too weak to be detected, or the trimer three-dimensional structure is such that it does not allow dimerization interactions.",

Dimeric S1 binds much more efficiently the receptor ACE2 than monovalent fragments containing the RBD. (A) Measurement of the level of expression of different S fragments by ELISA in 200 ll of culture supernatants of cells transfected with various constructs. Anti-His and anti-c-Myc epitope antibodies were used in a sandwich ELISA to detect the levels of secreted tagged S proteins. (B) Binding of S fragments to ACE2 measured by ELISA. The tagged ACE2 was associated to the plate by an anti-C9 antibody coated on the plates. The supernatants from cell cultures where the cells were transfected with various S proteins and that with ACE 2 were mixed and incubated in ELISA plates either with (solid black bars) or without (hatched bars) anti-c-Myc antibody. The highest level of expression or binding is assumed to be 100%. interactions. In addition, under native conditions where the surface concentration of the S glycoprotein can be very high, as seen in electron micrographs, it is possible that dimerization interactions play a role in stabilizing a ''network'' of interacting molecules perhaps somewhat similar to networks of proteins that mediate entry of class II fusion proteins. Such networks, if any, could increase the avidity of interaction with receptor molecules and perhaps facilitate the formation of the fusion pore structure by providing a preassembled network of Env molecules or even provide energy to drive the fusion reaction in the absence of S cleavage that generates a highenergy metastable state. Further experiments are needed to test the validity of such a hypothesis, which in the absence of data directly supporting it remains highly speculative.",
