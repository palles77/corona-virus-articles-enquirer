The gaps between the sequence contigs were determined using PCR and Sanger sequencing. A cDNA amplification kit for 5' and 3' rapid amplification of cDNA ends (TaKaRa, Japan) was used to determine the full terminal sequences in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Sequences were validated by mapping the original high-throughput sequencing data with genome sequences in this study as references using CLC Genomic Workbench v.9.0. The verified high-throughput sequencing depth and coverage of each sequence were shown in supplementary material Table S1 .",

Four enterovirus strains had high degrees of genome nucleotide similarity (92.05%-97.83%) and polyprotein amino acid identity (96.17%-99.4%) with each other. Their VP1 sequences exhibited 91.06%-99.07% nucleotide similarity and 94.08%-99.65% amino acid identity. They were tentatively named CHN/BJ/2018-1J, CHN/BJ/2018-8J, CHN/BJ/2018-9J and CHN/BJ/2018-10J, abbreviated as 1J, 8J, 9J, 10J in this article, respectively. Online BLASTp analysis of their polyproteins showed that they had the highest identity (72.58%-73.09%) with strain 1631 of species Enterovius J. The enterovirus strain CHN/BJ/2018-2J (abbreviated as 2J) also displayed the greatest similarity to strain 1631, with 72.10% polyprotein amino acid identity. Its genome shared 85.37%-86.41% nucleotide similarity and 92.43%-93.4% amino acid identity with that of strains 1J, 8J, 9J and 10J. VP1 sequence of 2J exhibited relatively low nucleotide similarity (73.17%-74.45%) and amino acid identity (79.79%-81.18%) with those of strains 1J, 8J, 9J and 10J.The pairwise similarity of strains 1J, 8J, 9J, 10J and 2J with stains of species Enterovius J was calculated using Clustal Omega as presented inTable 2. VP1 regions of strains 1J, 8J, 9J, 10J and 2J had significantly lower identities with stains of species Enterovius J than observed for other regions.The other enterovirus was tentatively named strain CHN/BJ/2018-1A (abbreviated as 1A).Nucleotide BLASTn analysis of the whole genomic sequence indicated that 1A exhibited the highest sequence similarity of 82.8% (99% coverage) with human enterovirus 92 strain RJG7.BLASTp analysis of the polyprotein amino acid sequence revealed that strains 1A and RJG7 shared 94.7% identity (100% coverage).
