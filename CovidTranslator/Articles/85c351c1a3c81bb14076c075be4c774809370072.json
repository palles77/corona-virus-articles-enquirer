The vector might also need to be engineered to infect target cells that it does not infect naturally. If target cells are easily isolated from the patient (for example, from the blood or bone marrow) and re-transferred, ex vivo gene transfer might be ideal, and broadening of the vector tropism might be advantageous. Alternatively, a local application might be sufficient (for example, for a locally restricted tumour or a small organ such as the eye) and, depending on the possible side effects of gene transfer to local non-target cells, broadening or narrowing the tropism might be required. Finally, systemic treatment might be necessary, for example, to reach disseminated metastases or a large number of somatic cells to correct a genetic defect. In this situation, the tropism must be narrowed down to the target cells only.",

Pseudotyping has been used most extensively to modulate the host-cell tropisms of retroviral (including lentiviral) vectors because they are highly permissive for incorporation of heterologous attachment glycoproteins 9, 10 . The most widely used retroviral vector pseudotypes are those that incorporate the attachment glycoprotein of the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV-G) 11 , which both allows the production of high-titre vector stocks and confers a broad host range. The list of other foreign envelope glycoproteins that have been incorporated into lentiviral vectors is long, including representatives from several virus families. These pseudotypes show large differences in their relative transduction efficiencies for different tissues. Notable in vivo findings include the high efficiencies of neural tissue transduction by lyssavirus pseudotypes (the rabies and Mokola viruses) 9 and efficient transduction of airway epithelium by filovirus (Ebola Zaire) 9 or paramyxovirus (Sendai) pseudotypes 12 . If lentiviral gene transfer gains broader acceptance as a clinically viable vector system, these vectors could be used to explore gene therapies for Parkinson disease and cystic fibrosis, respectively. . Ad serotype 5 binds to its receptor CAR (coxsackie and adenovirus receptor) through its fibre knob. Subsequently, integrins interact with the RGD peptide motif in the penton base (the capsid protein at the base of the fibre) and facilitate cell entry by endocytosis 138 . b | Adeno-associated virus (AAV). Several basic residues of the AAV2 (adeno-associated virus serotype 2) capsid protein VP3 (especially positions R585 and R588) are involved in heparin binding. AAV2 first binds to heparansulphate proteoglycan (HSPG) 139 and then to the co-receptor, which can be either an integrin (shown here), human fibroblast growth factor receptor or hepatocyte growth factor receptor. The virus is internalized by endocytosis. Other AAV serotypes either resemble AAV2 in its heparin binding (such as AAV3 and AAV6), or use different primary receptors (for example, sialic acid for AAV4 and AAV5) 140 . c | Retrovirus (lentivirus): Membrane fusion is the main mechanism whereby enveloped viruses deliver their genomes into target cells 141 . After initial nonspecific adhesion of the virus to the cell surface 142 , viral attachment glycoproteins bind specifically to their cognate receptors, whereupon binding becomes irreversible. The host range of retroviral vectors is determined by the interaction of the viral envelope protein (Env) and the cellular receptor 143 . Subsequent steps in the viral entry process vary between different viruses but always result in fusion between the lipid membranes of the virus and the host cell, following which the viral nucleocapsid is released into the cytoplasm 144 . In some cases, receptor binding triggers conformational changes in the viral proteins that mediate membrane fusion. In others, the cell-bound virus is transported by its receptor into an endosomal compartment where a reduction in pH triggers a conformational rearrangement of the viral fusion machinery.

An important challenge here is that the viral attachment protein must be incorporated into a protein capsid instead of a lipid bilayer. This has mainly been achieved by substituting coat proteins with homologous proteins of other related serotypes, giving rise to a new tropism without changing the rest of the genome and thus enabling the use of established cloning systems that have been developed for the previous serotype. It is also possible to incorporate the coat proteins of unrelated viruses, although structural incompatibility can preclude this. For example, on the basis of the structural similarities of the trimeric Ad fibre and the trimeric reovirus attachment protein \u03c31, a chimeric fibre-\u03c31 protein was introduced into the Ad capsid by modifying the Ad genome, enabling efficient infection of primary dendritic cells and intestinal epithelial cells 18 .

Adaptors are molecules with dual specificities: one end binds the viral attachment protein and the other binds the receptor on the target cell. The advantages of this approach are its great flexibility, as different adaptors can readily be coupled to the same vector, and the fact that it does not require changes in vector structure that could be detrimental to vector production or gene transfer.

The thiol groups were then coupled to transferrin, which mediated the successful targeting of the vector to cells expressing the receptor for this protein. Because the thiol groups are at the tip of the fibre, and thus distant from the surface amino groups that are used for PEGylation, both systems can be used simultaneously. This novel thiol-group coupling system allows not only the convenient introduction of full-length proteins such as transferrin, but also receptor ligands that cannot be introduced by genetic methods, such as sugars, fatty acids and small molecules. This approach has the potential to be extended to other vector systems, possibly with the exception of enveloped vectors: these vectors lack the necessary capsid sites for modification and, in addition, coupling to the Env protein (retroviral or lentiviral viral envelope protein) might be deleterious to its function and the chemical steps involved might disrupt the viral envelope.",

The BAP is biotinylated during vector production in mammalian cells and can therefore be coupled to a biotinylated targeting ligand via tetrameric avidin (FIG. 2Bb) . Compared with coating the vector with biotinylated antibody, this strategy makes use of a more robust covalent attachment of biotin to the vector. This approach has been used to screen for potential targeting ligands 21 , to purify adenoviral vectors 36 and to evaluate Ad capsid proteins for targeting 37 . In terms of potential clinical applications, the avidin-biotin system has been used to target Ad vectors to dendritic cells in vitro using monoclonal antibodies or high-affinity binding peptides as ligands for the targeted cell receptor 38 . The high-affinity binding of avidin to biotin (10 -15 ) qualifies this system for in vivo applications, including therapeutic ones. Possible toxicity from high levels of avidin -which can complex biotin in the circulation -could be a concern; however, we consider this risk to be low, because only vector-bound avidin is expected to be introduced into the patient.

In part Ca, a single-chain antibody (single-chain variable fragment (scFv) against human carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA)) and a matrix metalloprotease (MMP) cleavage site are coupled to the viral envelope protein (Env). This allows binding to tumour cells that express CEA, followed by cleavage of the MMP cleavage site by tumour-secreted MMP 48 . The vector can also be targeted to tumour cells by incorporating a tumour-specific scFv directly into Env.

A lentiviral vector that was pseudotyped with the envelope protein (Env) of the Sindbis virus was successfully retargeted to metastatic melanoma in vivo 13 . To achieve this, the Sindbis Env was mutated to ablate liver or spleen tropism, and the ZZ domain (Ig-binding domain) of protein A was genetically fused to this protein. This allowed coupling to a monoclonal antibody that targeted P-glycoprotein-expressing melanoma cells (see part a in the figure) . Biodistribution was monitored through imaging, which was facilitated by vector-mediated luciferase expression. Part b in the figure shows ablation of the native tropism of the vector. SCID (severe combined immunodeficiency) mice were injected systemically with a lentivirus that was pseudotyped with a Sindbis Env protein that contained an antibody-binding domain. The upper panel shows strong liver and spleen tropism owing to domains within the Sindbis Env protein that target the vector to these tissues. Mutating these domains largely ablated this natural tropism (shown in the lower panel). Light emission is measured in photons (p) s -1 cm -2 steridian (sr) -1 . In part c, mice were injected first with tumour cells that form lung metastases, and 12 days later with the vector. Use of a nonspecific control antibody did not lead to tumourcell transduction (shown in the upper panel), whereas use of a tumour-cellspecific antibody leads to transduction of tumour cells in the lung (lower panel). This study shows how combining several targeting techniques (pseudotyping, ablation of native tropism and adaptor coupling) can lead to truly targeted gene transfer after systemic application, and how imaging is essential for the analysis.",

R\u00e4ty et al. used MRI-based imaging of an avidincoated baculovirus that was conjugated with biotinylated superparamagnetic iron oxide particles 137 . This technique should be easily applicable to other capsid-coated viruses. The spatial resolution of MRI is in the millimetre (typical for medical MRI) to micrometre (typical for research MRI) range, which is much greater than for the other imaging methods (which generally have a resolution of several millimetres) and which will allow assignment of vector location to individual cells. However, MRI is considerably less sensitive than radioactive or light-based imaging systems. vector type that allows incorporation of a BAP, or that can be chemically biotinylated -techniques that should be universally applicable -and is expected to be utilized in many more applications in the future. 41, 42 , and many researchers are working on ways to capitalize on the diversity and wide availability of these reagents. Vectors have been genetically modified to allow coupling of monoclonal antibodies; for example, a region of a bacterial immunoglobulin (Ig)-binding protein (usually the Z-domain of the staphylococcus protein A) can be inserted into the viral attachment proteins of various vector systems 14, [43] [44] [45] . In this way, the unmodified antibody can work like an adaptor, bridging the Ig-binding domain that is incorporated in the vector to the target receptor through its antibody specificity (FIG. 2Bc) . This approach has been successfully used in vitro and in SCID (severe combined immunodeficiency) mice 13 . However, a significant limitation of this approach is that polyclonal Igs in the bloodstream might compete to displace the monoclonal antibody from the virally displayed Ig-binding protein before it reaches its target site. The approach has not yet been advanced to clinical testing and might be better suited to ex vivo gene therapy applications that require transduction of specific target cells in a mixed cell population (for example, stem cells in bone marrow).",

In addition, incorporation of such large proteins into the Ad fibre can impede proper folding (trimerization) of the fibre and hence viral rescue. The use of cytosolically stabilized scFvs (intrabodies) and the generation of an artificial fibre allowed genetic coupling of the fibre and scFv in the Ad system 19 . The artificial fibre has the added advantage of ablating the native tropism of Ad. One challenge in using this system relates to identifying scFvs that will fold correctly in the cytosol, requiring expertise in scFv technology and complex fibre Amphotropic Describes a pathogen such as a virus or a bacteria that has a wide host range and can infect more than one species or cell-culture line.",

In the case of retroviral envelope glycoproteins, displayed targeting ligands usually impede infectivity because the normal functions of the viral attachment protein are altered. This can lead to direction of the virus into a non-functional entry pathway, steric blocking of its natural receptor interactions or prevention of conformational changes that are required for effective fusion triggering 51 . These problems led to the concept of inverse targeting, whereby the viral envelope glycoprotein is modified to selectively destroy its infectivity for cells expressing a targeted receptor 59 . Thus, amphotropic retroviral vectors that display epidermal growth factor (EGF), stem-cell factor (SCF) or insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) are selectively non-infectious for cells that express the cognate receptors (EGFR, KIT or IGFR), but remain fully infectious for other (receptor-negative) human cells [59] [60] [61] . This inverse targeting provides a useful way to detarget the liver (EGFR positive) or marrow stem cells (KIT positive), and can be used to ameliorate specific vector toxicities against these targets, although the number of potential applications is limited.",

Another approach is cleavage of an engineered junctional sequence between the SU and transmembrane (TM) components of a retroviral envelope glycoprotein, or between the F1 and F2 components of a measles attachment glycoprotein 62 . In this way, the vector is targeted to cells that are bathed in the appropriate protease.

            "text": "In one example, the H and I sheets of the Ad fibre knob were inserted into the pIII protein of a bacteriophage. A random peptide library was introduced between the Ad knob sheets and selected against the target cells. This resulted in identification of a peptide that improved Ad transduction of mouse muscle cells 14-fold compared with unmodified Ad 81 . A different approach was used for library screening with AAV 79 . First, the AAV capsid protein CAP was subjected to PCR-based mutagenesis and recombination, followed by insertion into an AAV packaging plasmid and creation of an AAV library. This library was then screened for desired properties, for example, using heparin affinity chromatography to select for low or high heparin affinity, or incubation with neutralizing serum to select for mutants that evaded antibody responses. Library selection for changes in retroviral vector tropism has also been carried out. For example, in one study 82 , feline leukemia virus (FeLV) envelope glycoproteins were randomized in the cell-targeting region by oligonucleotide insertions 83, 84 and subjected to transduction-based selection strategies in cancer cells. The resulting FeLV vector was able to transduce prostate cancer cell lines, but required the presence of a murine retrovirus (4070A) helper envelope glycoprotein to facilitate virus entry. Although this example demonstrates the feasibility of selecting vectors with new tropisms from retroviral libraries, the selection strategy cannot be focused on a specific known receptor; it can only be focused on a particular cell type. However, in cases in which no targeting ligands are known, such library-selection approaches can provide one way forward, and proof of principle for this approach has been established for targeting all the major vector classes 79, 81, 85, 86 .",

Other therapeutic interventions will require further research to achieve the desired targeting specificity, which should be facilitated by several recent developments. For example, singlecomponent systems (such as Ad with an artificial fibre that is genetically fused to a scFv) are easy to prepare in high titres and are not expected to face problems for clinical approval. By contrast, a lentiviral vector coupled to an adaptor might face more problems during large-scale preparation and in regard to the general safety issues of lentiviral vectors.

Whereas transcytosis for a lentivirus, HIV, has been described 89 , this area is only just beginning to be explored for viruses that form the basis of the other types of gene therapy vectors. In the context of AAV, three serotypes out of five that were tested showed transcytosis; this ability was both serotype and cell-type specific 90 . Serotype switching, which can be achieved by transfection of plasmids with different capsid backbones, can therefore be a valuable tool when transcytosis of AAV is required. Coupling the Ad vector with an adaptor that targets the transferrin-receptor pathway has enabled transcytosis, albeit at low efficiency 91 . Exploitation of other transcytosis pathways 92 and elucidation of the natural transcytosis pathways of some viruses might allow for rational design of transcytosing vectors. Furthermore, the generation of vectors that are mosaic for their viral attachment protein (having two genetically distinct versions) 93 could prove valuable (FIG. 2Cd) . One attachment protein could carry a ligand for transcytosis, whereas the other could carry the ligand for transduction of the target cell. Alternatively, the transcytosis ligand could be placed onto other capsid proteins (for example, pIX in the case of Ad), while having the transduction ligand on all viral attachment proteins.",

In contrast to retroviruses, because the attachment and fusion functions of the measles virus are encoded on separate proteins, it is easier to manipulate binding specificity without negatively impacting the efficiency of cell entry. Several large polypeptide ligands have been displayed on the surface of the measles virus as extensions of the viral attachment glycoprotein 94 . In most cases, the ligand-displaying measles viruses have been able to enter cells efficiently via the targeted receptor 95, 96 . Mutations that are known to ablate the natural measles tropisms for CD46 and SLAM (signalling lymphocytic activation molecule) were subsequently incorporated into the chimeric viral attachment proteins, thereby generating fully retargeted measles viruses with entirely new receptor specificities 49 . Several fully retargeted measles viruses have been shown to mediate targeted in vivo destruction of receptor-positive tumours 97, 98 . In this way, new genetransfer vehicles can be created, combining established targeting principles (such as ablation of native tropism and targeting through single-chain antibodies) with the natural abilities of different vectors, thus continuously expanding the gene therapist's toolbox.",
