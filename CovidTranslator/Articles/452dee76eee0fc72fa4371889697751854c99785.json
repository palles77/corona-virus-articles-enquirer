            "text": "For antiviral screenings purposes, infection of cell cultures with the virus under study, should ideally result in the induction, within just a few days, of (nearly) complete CPE and allow the calculation of acceptable Z' factors (>0.5). The human Corona virus NL63 (HCoV-NL63) causes only limited CPE on different cell lines (Schildgen et al., 2006) . Following infection of Vero118 cells, virus-induced CPE was too low to allow readout based on classical colorimetric methods (such as the MTS assay), even following prolonged incubation times (>7 days). To develop an antiviral screenings-assay against HCoV-NL63, we explored whether a dead-cell protease substrate could be used instead. The substrate used is a quenched peptide (bis-AAF-R110) that releases a fluorophore upon proteolytic-cleavage by proteases; the latter released from dead cells. Following different rounds of optimization a screening protocol was developed: Vero118 cells in 96-well plate format were infected with HCoV-NL63 (MOI = 0.01; 200 L cell culture; 2.10 4 cells/mL, IMDM 5% FBS medium). Cultures were subsequently incubated for 5 days at 35 \u2022 C after which 20 L of the peptide solution was added. Fluorescence was quantitated 2 hr after incubation at 37 \u2022 C. A roughly 3-fold increase in fluorescence intensity in the infected cultures was observed as compared to the uninfected cultures with a low well-to-well variability. Z' factors calculated from different experiments were in the range of 0.6-0.8, indicating excellent assay quality. An anti-ACE2 polyclonal antiserum (that prevents coronavirus infection in cell cultures) was used as a positive control and allowed to validate the assay for antiviral screening purposes. In conclusion, in conditions where a viability staining is inadequate to quantitate virus-induced CPE, a novel simple and convenient method that detects cell-death and that is suitable for high-throughput screening purposes can be employed.",

While it is difficult to estimate the total number of disease causing viral infections, the mortality caused by some specific viral pathogens is well described.

As in other disease areas the contribution of phenotypic screening to the discovery of first-in-class small-molecule drugs exceeds that of target-based approaches (Swinney and Anthony, 2011) . The main phenotype used in antiviral assays is the development of a virus induced cythopathic effect (CPE). If a virus infection renders sufficient CPE in cell culture then standard viability assays (ex. MTS reduction) are feasible to detect viral and antiviral activity. However if the CPE is limited than more complicated and expensive tools are needed (ex ATP quantitation).",

This method uses a \"dead-cell protease substrate\", which contains a fluorophore (R110) quenched by the covalent linkage of two Ala-Ala-Phe peptides (bis-AAF-R110). The method can be used to detect cell death since proteolytic-cleavage by proteases, released from dead cells, restores the fluorophore (Niles et al., 2007) (Fig. 1) . This method was developed further for the quantitation of limited CPE. The read-out is homogeneous and rather inexpensive and therefore amendable to medium-or high-throughput screening campaigns. In this paper the method is described as a solution to screen for inhibitors of human coronavirus. The human Coronavirus NL63 is used as a model system since it uses the same cellular receptor as the SARS-virus (ACE2). HCoV-NL63 causes only limited CPE on different cell lines (Schildgen et al., 2006) making CPE quantitation troublesome with classical viability staining (ex MTS reduction).",

            "text": "In a first experiment a virus titration of two different virusstocks of HCoV-NL63 was carried out and on day 6 p.i. read-out was performed by (i) microscopic scoring of the CPE and (ii) by using the CytoTox-Fluor TM Cytotoxicity Assay (Promega, Leiden, the Netherlands -cat no G9260). This CytoTox-Fluor TM assay has been developed to quantitate cell-death based on the cleavage of the bis-AAF-R110 peptide by proteases released from dead cells (Niles et al., 2007) . In this experiment the assay was used according to the manufacturers' instructions. Results are presented in Fig. 2 . For both virusstocks a very good correlation between the observed levels of CPE and the increased levels of fluorescence are observed. This indicates that the release of proteases by cultures that develop CPE and the subsequent cleavage of the bis-AAF-R110 peptide to its fluorescent substrate can be used to quantitate CPE. When a similar experiment was carried out using other methods to detect cell viability such as the MTS reduction method (Fig. 3) or the quantitation of LDH release (data not shown), no significant difference between infected and non-infected cell cultures could be observed. Next experiments were designed to optimize the assay for screening purposes. The optimal condition obtained was: 20,000 cells/well of Vero-118 cells infected with HCoV-NL63 (MOI = 0.01 CCID 50 /cell) in IMDM medium supplemented with 5% FBS medium. Upon infection cultures are maintained for 5 days at 35 \u2022 C after which 20 L of the peptide solution (16 M final concentration) is added. Fluorescence is measured after 2 hr incubation at 37 \u2022 C using parameters for rhodamine fluorescence read-out. The amount of peptide used under these conditions is 3x lower than proposed by the manufacturer of the Cytotox-Fluor TM assay. Using lower levels of peptide results in a decreased signal but the signalto-noise ratio remains sufficient high to be used under screening conditions (see below). The main reason to lower the amount of peptide is to make a screening campaign affordable.",

This antibody inhibits SARS virus replication by binding ACE2 and preventing the virus to enter the cell (Li et al., 2003; Ivens et al., 2005) . The experiment was set-up as a standard antiviral experiment in which the antibody was diluted in medium at different concentrations in duplicate after which virus and cells were added. In the same way a polyclonal goat IgG was used as a control. Untreated infected (virus controls), and treated uninfected (cell controls) cultures were included on each plate (6 wells each). On day 5 p.i. one plate was analyzed using the CytoTox-Fluor TM kit according to manufacturers' protocol (except that the peptide was used at a 3\u00d7 lower concentration). In brief the peptide solution was diluted 1/600 in assay buffer (as supplied with the kit) and 20 L/well was added to the 96-well plate. The other plate was analyzed in parallel using the custom made peptide. To this end a 100 mM DMSO stock of the peptide was diluted 1/600 in assay medium and 20 L/well was added (final peptide concentration 16 M). Plates were incubated at 37 \u2022 C for 90 and following thorough shaking the plates were read. Results are presented in Fig. 4 . The performance of the custom prepared peptide batch was comparable to that of the CytoTox-Fluor TM kit. A Z' factor of 0.73 and 0.70 was calculated in this experiment for the custom prepared and commercial peptide respectively. A Z' > 0.5 indicates sufficient quality for screening (Zhang et al., 1999) . In addition the results show that the Anti-ACE2 IgG inhibits in vitro HCoV-NL63 replication with an EC 50 \u223c 0.3 g/mL. The polyclonal goat IgG, used as a negative control, showed an EC 50 > 10 g/mL (Fig. 4) . It has been reported previously that the anti-ACE2 IgG is not toxic at concentrations up to 125 g/mL (Li et al., 2003; Ivens et al., 2005) . Also in the experiment above no effect of the anti-ACE2 IgG on cellular morphology could be observed microscopically (data not shown). The antiviral activity found is \u223c3\u00d7 more pronounced than the activity against the SARS coronavirus (Li et al., 2003; Ivens et al., 2005) . This is not unexpected since both viruses are known to bind the ACE2 receptor differently and have evolved independently in their ability to use it for cellular entry (Wu et al., 2011) . Finally two independent antiviral assays were carried out using the custom prepared peptide. In each assay four 96-well plates were used with 6-infected and 6-uninfected wells in each plate. Fluorescence was quantified on day 5 p.i. and resulted in a Z'-factor of 0.63 (Fig. 5) .",

            "text": "We demonstrate that a method, previously validated for quantitation of cell toxicity (Niles et al., 2007) , can also be used to quantitate virus induced CPE and antiviral activity under conditions suitable for screening. The assay principle relies on the detection of proteases released from dead cells by using the bis-AAF-R110 peptide, which upon cleavage, turns fluorescent. The main advantage of this method, in comparison to cell viability measurements such as the MTS reduction or LDH release methods, is the sensitive detection of limited virus induced CPE. This allows its use in antiviral screening campaigns with viruses that cause only limited levels of CPE. In addition the assay is highly homogenous (no washing steps) and affordable. In our hands the cost of substrate is \u223cD 0.03/well. Another advantage is the non-destructive nature of the method, allowing microscopic inspection and simultaneous or sequential use of other assay methods in the same well (for example to evaluate toxic or anti-proliferative effects of the compounds). Because the method is non-destructive the samples remain infectious. In general this is not a limitation as fluorescence can be measured in most plate readers with the plate lid covering the plate.",
