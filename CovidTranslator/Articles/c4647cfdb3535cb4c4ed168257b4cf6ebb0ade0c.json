While the overall mortality for trauma patients decreased over the study period, the mortality rates in the subgroup of septic trauma patients did not significantly decrease (4).

Preventative interventions and quality control programs in hospital care, such as the Surviving Sepsis Campaign and CDC monitoring efforts, have done much over the last ten years to increase awareness about sepsis. These efforts target early identification of at risk patients, since early aggressive treatment of sepsis increases the chance of survival (6) . Through these efforts, mortality rates from sepsis have declined, yet the risk of sepsis remains high, particularly for trauma patients with severe injuries (3, 4, 6) . Identifying predictive factors that are associated with post-traumatic sepsis may be the next step for improving care for trauma patients. production upon LPS challenge in vitro, 2) increased production of anti-inflammatory cytokines, and 3) markedly reduced HLA-DR expression resulting in a loss of antigenpresenting capacity. Monocytes with reduced HLA-DR expression have been described in trauma patients, and failure to return to normal levels of HLA-DR expression has been correlated with higher mortality in severely injured trauma patients (8, 9) , but the mechanisms surrounding monocyte deactivation and its reversal are not fully recognized (10) .",

This polymorphism is known to affect receptor affinity and specificity. Interestingly, the R 131 variant shows strong binding to CRP and weak binding to IgG, whereas the H 131 variant shows weak binding to CRP and strong binding to IgG (16, 17) . This polymorphism has clinical implications and may represent a risk factor for certain diseases, either at the level of disease susceptibility or at the level of disease severity (20) . Patients with the R allele were found to have a more severe case of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome infection and were more likely to be susceptible to encapsulated organism infection, which was attributed to poor IgG2 binding to the R variant of Fc\u03b3RIIa (11, 20) . The Fc\u03b3RIIa polymorphism has been described as a heritable risk factor for autoimmune and infectious diseases (11, 20) . We hypothesized this common genetic variation in the receptor for CRP might contribute to individual differences in monocyte responses and susceptibility to infectious complications after severe trauma.",

Blood samples were collected from 66 eligible patients at enrollment (day 1) and again at approximately 24 hours (day 2) and 48 hours (day 3) who provided informed consent or had consent from a legally authorized representative. Whole blood was collected each day in heparinized tubes for determination of plasma cytokine levels and in EDTA tubes on day 2 for determination of monocyte markers by flow cytometry and for DNA extraction. Septic events were recorded for enrolled patients up until day 14 of hospitalization and were defined as presence of 2 or more SIRS criteria with confirmed positive culture, combined with the appropriate clinical findings (ie. documented course of antibiotic treatment for clinically presumed infection). Only positive cultures were considered in the sepsis group. The EMR was evaluated to determine if the appropriate clinical criteria were present, ie-tachycardia, fever, leukocytosis and/or tachypnea to determine presence of SIRS criteria as well as documentation from the treating physician of clinical infection. Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) was defined as organ failure for at least two organ systems. Organ failure was defined by the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment criteria (SOFA score > or = 3 points) during the ICU stay (23) . A subset of this study's patient population was previously characterized (10, 21, 22) . We have previously described the association of heme-oxygenase with monocyte deactivation and showed that HO-1 did not correlate with monocyte deactivation in a subset of this cohort (10) . We identified the expansion of a subpopulation of monocytes in a portion of this cohort (21) , and finally, we described a correlation between lower apolipoproteins B and AII levels and nosocomial infections in a portion of this cohort (22) . Plasma Cytokine Analysis-Heparinized blood samples from each day were centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 10 minutes and plasma was collected and stored at -80\u00b0C for later determination of cytokine concentrations and factor levels. Plasma cytokine concentrations were determined with Milliplex Human Cytokine Immunoassay according to the manufacturer's instructions (Millipore, Billerica, MA). The cytokines measured by this technique included TNF-alpha, IL-1RA, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and MCP-1. CRP, TGF-\u03b2, M-CSF and soluble CD163 concentrations were determined separately by ELISA according to the manufacturer's instructions (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN for CRP, M-CSF and soluble CD163; BD Bioscience, San Jose, CA for TGF-\u03b2).",

Unadjusted and adjusted Cox model regression analyses were used to assess the association between biomarkers and time until sepsis. Adjusted models included ISS scores and transfusion in addition to biomarkers.

With this transformation the hazard ratio for a one unit increase in log2(biomarker) corresponds to the effect size for a doubling of the biomarker concentration. Longitudinal changes in biomarker concentration were assessed by mixed model regression analyses with terms for days from initial blood draw, ISS and whether the patient developed sepsis within 14 days.

We did not include hypotension in the adjustment since the transfusion model predicted sepsis as well as hypotension in our model. The anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 was associated with an increased risk of developing sepsis. Similarly, the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-8 and IL-6 and the chemokine MCP-1 as well as the acute phase protein CRP were associated with increased risk of developing sepsis in the unadjusted analysis.

This finding was recently confirmed and further investigated by Torrance, et al (30) . They found that transfusion of blood products was independently associated with altered patterns of gene expression. Their conclusion was that the immunosuppressive response to trauma may be exacerbated by blood transfusions, and this was associated with an increased susceptibility to nosocomial infections. They demonstrated no difference in the overall injury severity score between patients receiving transfusions and those that did not. However, there were significantly higher numbers of traumatic brain injury patients in the non-transfused group, which may account for the equivalent ISS between the two groups, since head trauma is not usually associated with a high transfusion requirement (30) . When clinical variables were used to predict sepsis in a multivariable model, we found that ISS (HR = 1.65 per 10 unit increase, 95% CI 1.21 -2.28) and transfusion (HR = 2.57 95% CI 1.12 -6.96) were jointly associated with sepsis.
