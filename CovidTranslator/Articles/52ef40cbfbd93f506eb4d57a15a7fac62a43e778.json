            "text": "Chronic cigarette smoking induces pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) by largely unknown mechanisms. Renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is known to function in the development of PAH. Losartan, a specific angiotensin II receptor antagonist, is a well-known antihypertensive drug with a potential role in regulating angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2), a recently found regulator of RAS. To determine the effect of losartan on smoke-induced PAH and its possible mechanism, rats were daily exposed to cigarette smoke for 6 months in the absence and in the presence of losartan. Elevated right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP), thickened wall of pulmonary arteries with apparent medial hypertrophy along with increased angiotensin II (Ang II) and decreased ACE2 levels were observed in smoke-exposed-only rats. Losartan administration ameliorated pulmonary vascular remodeling, inhibited the smoke-induced RVSP and Ang II elevation and partially reversed the ACE2 decrease in rat lungs. In cultured primary pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMCs) from 3-and 6-month smoke-exposed rats, ACE2 levels were significantly lower than in those from the control rats. Moreover, PASMCs from 6-month exposed rats proliferated more rapidly than those from 3month exposed or control rats, and cells grew even more rapidly in the presence of DX600, an ACE2 inhibitor. Consistent with the in vivo study, in vitro losartan pretreatment also inhibited cigarette smoke extract (CSE)-induced cell proliferation and ACE2 reduction in rat PASMCs. The results suggest that losartan may be therapeutically useful in the chronic smoking-induced pulmonary vascular remodeling and PAH and ACE2 may be involved as part of its mechanism. Our study might provide insight into the development of new therapeutic interventions for PAH smokers.",

It has been generally accepted and acknowledged that alterations in the pulmonary vasculature, commonly marked by vascular proliferation/fibrosis, remodeling, and vessel occlusion, leads to most, if not all, forms of pulmonary arterial hypertension (Humbert et al., 2004) . As a key factor blamed for the alterations in the pulmonary vasculature, cigarette smoking has been reported to result in muscularization of pulmonary vessels in the presence or absence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (Wright et al., 2003 (Wright et al., , 2004 Churg et al., 2006; Santos et al., 2002) . Moreover, increased expression of vasoactive mediators (e.g., endothelin-1 and vascular endothelial growth factor) have been detected in the guinea pig lungs after chronic smoke exposure and those mediators are reported to be associated with vascular remodeling and elevated pulmonary arterial pressure . However, the precise mechanisms by which chronic cigarette smoke exposure produces PAH are still poorly understood.",

            "text": "The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of pulmonary vascular remodeling and PAH in a number of studies. For instance, increased expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) in pulmonary arteries has been reported in PAH patients (Orte et al., 2000) . Increases in angiotensin II (Ang II) and Ang II type 1 (AT1) receptors were both demonstrated in hypoxic and monocrotaline-treated pulmonary hypertensive rats (Chassagne et al., 2000; Ferreira et al., 2009 ). In the RAS, ACE plays a central role in generating Ang II from angiotensin I (Ang I) (Turner & Hooper, 2002) , and Ang II exerts a prominent role in the development of pulmonary vascular remodeling and PAH (Jeffery & Wanstall, 2001) , particularly in promoting the growth of pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMCs) via AT1 receptors (Morrell et al., 1999) . Moreover, medication with either ACE inhibitor or AT1 receptor antagonist can attenuate pulmonary arterial remodeling and PAH in Toxicology and Applied Pharmacology 245 (2010) [100] [101] [102] [103] [104] [105] [106] [107] chronic hypoxia or monocrotaline-treated rats (Nong et al., 1996; Kishi et al., 2006) . Additionally, nicotine, an important component of cigarette smoke, and its metabolites can increase both the activity and the expression of ACE in cultured human endothelial cells (Saijonmaa et al., 2005; Ljungberg & Persson, 2008) . Furthermore, inhibition of ACE may improve endothelial function in chronic cigarette smokers (Butler et al., 2001) . Based on these previous findings, we hypothesized that activated RAS might also contribute to the development of chronic smoking-induced PAH.",

            "text": "Losartan, a specific AT1 receptor blocker, exerts its influence on the RAS via inhibiting the stimulation of the AT1 receptor by Ang II. It has been reported that losartan treatment may attenuate pulmonary vascular remodeling and PAH in hypoxic rats and in piglets with left-to-right shunts (Chassagne et al., 2000; Rondelet et al., 2005) . However, it has not been determined whether losartan has a therapeutic effect on chronic cigarette smoking-induced PAH. In addition, losartan has shown a modulatory effect on the expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) in hypertensive and cardiovascular diseases (Ishiyama et al., 2004; Koka et al., 2008) . ACE2, with a main role in cleaving Ang II into angiotensin (1-7) [Ang (1-7)] (Ferrario et al., 2005b) , is a recently found regulator of the RAS and has been implicated in multiple lung diseases, e.g., severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) infection, acute lung injury, pulmonary fibrosis and monocrotalineinduced PAH Kuba et al., 2005; Li et al., 2008; Ferreira et al., 2009 ). However, it has not been elucidated whether ACE2 has a role in chronic smoking-induced PAH. A recent study shows that the antihypertensive action of AT1 antagonists may be partially due to increased Ang II metabolism by ACE2 (Ferrario et al., 2005a) . Thus, in the present study, we sought to investigate whether losartan is therapeutically useful in smoke-induced pulmonary arterial remodeling and PAH and the possible participation of ACE2 in the mechanism.",

Cigarette smoke extract (CSE) was prepared as previously described (Oltmanns et al., 2005 ) with a few modifications. Briefly, cigarette smoke derived from one cigarette was drawn slowly into a 50-ml syringe and bubbled through 5 ml of DMEM. And one cigarette yielded 5 draws of 50 ml of the syringe, with each individual draw taking approximately 10 seconds to complete. The resulting solution, which represented \"100%\" strength, was then adjusted to pH 7.4 with concentrated NaOH and filtered before being diluted in DMEM to the required strength for application to PASMCs cultures.",

Consistent with our in vivo study results, in PASMCs from smoke-exposed rats, ACE2 levels were significantly lower than in those from the control rats in an exposure time-dependent manner. Moreover, PASMCs from 6-month exposed rats proliferated more rapidly than those from 3-month exposed or control rats, and cells grew even more rapidly by the ACE2 inhibition with DX600. In cultured PASMCs from control rats, in vitro CSE challenge could also stimulate cell proliferation and reduce ACE2 levels, which could be significantly inhibited by losartan pretreatment.

Our study showed that losartan treatment effectively suppressed pulmonary artery medial wall thickening and RVSP elevation in smoke-exposed rats as well as the CSE-induced cell proliferation in rat PASMCs. The inhibitory effect of losartan may be due to its property of directly blocking the AT1 receptor, which, as we speculate, might result in the accumulation of Ang II via an undetermined mechanism. But interestingly, in the rats treated with smoke exposure plus losartan administration, we observed a significant decrease in Ang II levels in the lung as compared to the rats exposed to smoke alone, implying the existence of additional potential mechanisms for losartan-attenuated PAH in the smokeinduced rat model. In other words, losartan can not only inhibit the effect of Ang II but may also decrease Ang II levels in cigarette smoking-induced PAH.",

In the present study, we found a significant decrease in ACE2 levels in the cigarette smoke-induced PAH rats and in the cultured CSE-challenged rat PASMCs, which could be partially restored by losartan treatment. On the contrary, losartan had no effect on the smoke-induced ACE elevation. In a previous study, Ferrario et al. (2005a) also found that losartan treatment (10 mg/kg) showed no effect on plasma ACE activity in normotensive Lewis rats. Similarly, in another study in Wistar rats with experimental congestive heart failure (CHF), ACE activity in the myocardial homogenate did not differ between the treatment with and without eprosartan (another AT1 receptor antagonist) administration (Karram et al., 2005) . Indeed, several studies have demonstrated that losartan can efficiently increase both the expression and activity of ACE2 in rat heart or human kidney (Koka et al., 2008; Xia et al., 2009) . Increased ACE2 may augment the conversion of Ang II into Ang (1-7), leading to the decrease in Ang II concentration. Thus, these findings suggest that losartan treatment may have more influence on ACE2 than on ACE, and the reduction of Ang II in the attenuation of losartan-treated PAH is probably due to the losartan-induced elevation in ACE2 levels. As a result, the stimulation of the AT1 receptor in response to Ang II is reduced, which may also contribute to the attenuation of smokeinduced PAH by losartan treatment.",

            "text": "There is now growing evidence to suggest that ACE2 may play an important part in PAH. It has been found that ACE2 plays a protective role but its expression is decreased in human and experimental pulmonary fibrosis (Li et al., 2008) . In a very recent study, chronic treatment with XNT, a synthetic activator of ACE2, prevented the elevation of RVSP, right ventricular hypertrophy, and thickness of pulmonary vessel wall in monocrotaline-induced PAH rat model (Ferreira et al., 2009 ). In our present study, we found that ACE2 protein expression was significantly decreased in the lung along with apparent pulmonary arterial remodeling and PAH in the 6-month smoke-exposed rats. Moreover, in our in vitro study, Western blotting results also showed that ACE2 was markedly decreased in the PASMCs from the smoke-exposed rats compared with those from the control rats. In addition, ACE2 inhibition with DX600 significantly increased PASMC proliferation rate above the level induced by smoke exposure alone, indicating a possible involvement of ACE2 in the smokeinduced growth of PASMCs. There is recent evidence that Ang II downregulates ACE2 via AT1 receptor-mediated ERK/p38 MAP kinase signaling pathway (Koka et al., 2008) , therefore the decrease in ACE2 protein expression induced by chronic cigarette smoke exposure may be mediated by a mechanism dependent on Ang II and its receptors. The detailed mechanism itself warrants further study.",

            "text": "In summary, chronic cigarette smoke exposure significantly induced pulmonary artery wall thickening, RVSP elevation, as well as Ang II accumulation and ACE2 decrease in rat lungs. Losartan administration effectively attenuated the smoke-induced pulmonary arterial remodeling and PAH, reduced Ang II elevation, and reversed ACE2 reduction. ACE2 inhibition with specific inhibitor in vitro further increased rat PASMC proliferation induced by smoke exposure. Similarly, losartan treatment significantly suppressed CSE-induced cell proliferation and ACE2 decrease in cultured rat primary PASMCs. These results suggest that losartan may attenuate the chronic smoking-induced pulmonary vascular remodeling and PAH in which ACE2 may serve as part of the mechanism. This study might provide insight into the development of new therapeutic interventions for PAH smokers.",
