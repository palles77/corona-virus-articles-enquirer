The challenge is how to take this academic virology knowledge into a drug discovery and development domain. One approach is the use of consortia and public-private partnerships -this article highlights ongoing efforts in the USA. Public funds, such as those from government sources, can support research efforts that do not to appear to have commercial value.

Although all prior outbreaks of Ebola Zaire had occurred in remote areas of Central Africa, this epidemic began in 2013 in the West African nation of Guinea [1] . It is believed that the epidemic started with a single introduction of the virus into the human population in December 2013 by a 2-year-old boy who died after presenting with fever, vomiting and black stools [2] . The outbreak subsequently spread by human-to-human transmission into highly populated areas in Liberia, Sierra Leone, Nigeria, Senegal and Mali. As of October 2015, approximately 28,000 probable, suspected and laboratory confirmed cases of Ebola had been reported, with 11,000 deaths [3]. These cases included 881 healthcare workers who were infected and of whom an estimated 60% died. The outbreak carried over into the USA and Europe via residents and healthcare workers who were exposed to the virus in West Africa (six cases). Two imported cases, including one that ended in death, and two acquired cases in healthcare workers occurred in the USA [4] . This outbreak clearly illustrates the limited ability of our current public health and medical research and development systems to respond to the rapid emergence of a rare, highly virulent infectious disease, particularly in densely populated urban centers. Although attempts were made to utilize vaccines and therapeutic agents in development (many with a primary indication for a different virus), no comprehensive report on how effective these interventions may have been has appeared to date.",

The majority of the cases occurred in Southeast Asia and Canada [5] . More recently, in 2012 a novel coronavirus was identified in the Middle East, causing a respiratory illness, dubbed the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). This virus is genetically and phenotypically distinct from the coronavirus that caused the SARS epidemic in 2003. However, like people infected with the SARS virus, people infected with MERS-CoV quickly developed severe respiratory illness. Approximately four out of every ten patients diagnosed with MERS died [6] . No existing therapies for patients with SARS or MERS, including ribavirin, corticosteroids and interferon were effective.

            "text": "The USA continues to experience multiple emerging infections. For example, introduction of WNV has caused clinical infections ranging in severity from totally asymptomatic and uncomplicated WNV fever, to fatal meningoencephalitis. As of December 2011, over 31,000 cases have been reported to the CDC in USA with 1263 deaths (~4.0%) [14] . In 2012, there was a resurgence of WNV disease with over 5300 cases and 243 deaths reported to the CDC. While there have been fluctuations in the number of reported cases, documented disease occurs annually in USA. No therapy, including the administration of high titer WNV immune globulin (Whitley et al., personal experience) has proven efficacious. Furthermore, no small molecule drugs have been developed. Second, monkeypox, a member of the orthopox virus family, was inadvertently imported into USA in shipments of giant Gambian rats for the exotic pet trade. During quarantine, these animals transmitted the virus to pet prairie dogs, which are highly susceptible to infection. In May of 2003, monkeypox spread to approximately 70 individuals who had contact with these animals resulting in 11 clinical cases of disease, one of which was life threatening [15] . There were not and still are not any US FDA-approved drugs for the treatment of poxvirus infections. Third, the USA experienced pandemic 2009 H1N1 influenza that caused morbidity and mortality in select populations, particularly young adults and pregnant women. While the mortality was not as great as that associated with other pandemics, the need for improved antiviral therapies became apparent, especially against drug-resistant strains that circulate globally. Fourth, a decade ago, chikungunya was rarely detected in the USA, even in global travelers returning from areas where the disease was endemic. However, cases began to be identified in 2006, first in travelers returning from Asia, Africa or areas near the Indian Ocean, and subsequently, starting in 2013, in travelers returning from the Caribbean. Local transmission in Florida, Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands began to be identified in 2014, and starting this year the disease is a nationally notifiable condition, reporting to the CDC [16]. Fifth, dengue has been reported not only in Puerto Rico but also the continental USA [17, 18] . Lastly, although not prevalent in the USA (yet), the most recent outbreak of the emerging infection with Zika virus in Brazil, resulting in microcephaly of babies born to infected mothers, is cause for concern and monitoring [19] .",

This can be attributed to multiple factors including: the occurrence of these diseases is mostly in poor, developing countries, the incidence of disease is low and sporadic making it difficult to conduct clinical trials that meet US FDA standards, and the market size for these drugs is uncertain making it difficult to recoup direct development costs. Therefore, industry has focused its efforts on drugs for chronic diseases that are used regularly and consequently have substantially greater commercial potential. More generally, by out-sourcing basic discovery, pharma has the opportunity to save the initial research costs and be more confident in pursuing classic development as opposed to research. Nonetheless, an advantage for pharma in the development of drugs for emerging infections is the ability to apply for and secure from the US FDA a voucher that can then be applied to expedited review of more traditional medications. However, for smaller biotechnology companies, it is still difficult to obtain early stage financing if the focus is on discovering and developing drugs for emerging/ reemerging infections with marginal commercial potential.",

This is perhaps due to the desire to meet unmet medical need, and the need to differentiate the academic efforts from commercial ones and thus not be in direct competition with entities with significantly greater financial resources. As will be discussed in more depth below, academic drug discovery efforts benefit from a depth of knowledge in biology and medicine, but often lack the infrastructure and expertise beyond target identification, hit identification and initial hit to lead efforts. By contrast, the strength of commercial enterprises resides in target validation, applied medicinal chemistry, preclinical toxicology, clinical trial design and execution, as well as the project management infrastructure necessary to navigate a novel chemical series from concept to investigational new drug (IND) and ultimately to a new drug application (NDA).",

For example, the formation of the National Center for the Advancement of Translational Science, and its associated Centers for Translational Science Awards, is directed toward these efforts. Many of these academic drug discovery centers incorporate experts from the pharmaceutical industry into leadership positions.

ADDC facilitates matching interests from companies in specific targets and/or diseases with appropriate academic partners. Their website [24] lists centers and their programs, events, job postings and partnership opportunities, all contributed by its active members.",

A survey by Frye et al. showed that as many as 60% of the projects are early stage, namely hit to lead identification, with only 2% of projects in clinical development under an IND [20, 23] . The reasons may include practical ones, such as the lower cost and resources needed at earlier stages of discovery. However, it may be strategic as well, such that academic drug discovery has the flexibility of focusing on long-term, high-risk projects, since an immediate shareholder payout is not expected as would be the case for publicly traded pharmaceutical firms [20, 25] .",

            "text": "However, with few exceptions, academic enterprises typically lack the infrastructure and expertise for later stage efforts to move from lead to clinical candidate. In Frye's overview of academic drug discovery in the USA, it was noted that only approximately half of the centers performed in vivo proof-of-concept testing or even basic distribution, metabolism and pharmacokinetic evaluations (DMPK) [20] . For centers that do have the capabilities of later stage projects, public funding from the NIH can be complemented by resources in kind, and/or milestone-based and licensing income from industry partners, if there is appropriate intellectual property (IP) protection for 'new composition of matter.' Many academic institutions address IP matters inappropriately and focus on patenting targets and assays, which are invariably more difficult to protect and of less value. In addition, in some cases patents are filed too early, as the inventions have not been fully vetted. Another misconception is that once a patent is filed, an investigator is free to disclose the invention and it will be protected. Careful consideration must be given as to when an application will be published versus when the work is actually published in a peer reviewed journal or disclosed in a public forum. In some cases this would require delaying a publication. However, one of the main problems if one is working in a university environment is the academic promotion and tenure system, which rewards faculty for publications and extramural grants. This philosophy tends to be incompatible with the timelines associated with drug discovery and development [27] . In order to obtain protection for a chemical series, publications should be delayed until the patent is actually published, which typically is 18 months after the filing. Several academic groups have circumvented the publish versus patent issues on chemical matter by delaying publication of the lead series and publishing on compounds or series of less interest. Of course, the question remains as to whether a university's research and teaching missions are compatible with delaying publications to establish an acceptable IP position [25] .",

This is standard practice in commercial screening operations, but is often overlooked in academic efforts [23] .

Finally, more effort should be put into validation of targets, as only 18% of academic drug targets had any clinical evidence of validity in Frye's survey [20] .

Already important in day-to-day operations of these institutions, it takes on an even more prominent role in consortia, where it needs to be completely clear about the responsibilities of each partner party, including the timelines for execution of these responsibilities. Project plans ensure that communications happen between the right individuals at the right time and that decisions are made with all the information that is available. One example highlighted as best practice is Gilead's collaboration with Yale in the oncology space, in which there is a continuous communication and decision making loop in operation, in contrast to the more traditional 'quarterly updates' [30] . Ideally, there would be a project manager at each party, or at a minimum a point of contact who is included in all communications and has the charge and authority to follow-up on action items and decisions made.",

This includes a deep knowledge of biology and drug discovery, as well as what will be required for later-stage drug development activities. Typically, the former will be residing with the academic partner, who will provide the innovative energy to the project, where the latter resides with the commercial partner, who brings timeline and critical path management to the table. However, having consortia partners who understand both activities make the eventual transition and early decisions more productive. Toward the latter, it is highly advisable to generate a compound progression pathway, which delineates the parameters a compound needs to meet before moving on to the next phase in the drug discovery and development pipeline. This should include parameters associated with antiviral efficacy and safety, as well as drug-like properties. Importantly, this document needs to clarify the critical path, decision-making parameters versus 'nice to know' studies or data that are not absolutely critical for moving the compound forward as a potential therapeutic. For example, the exact mechanism of action at a molecular level needs to be determined as quickly as possible and is important to know for the academic virologist who wants to truly understand the biology of the target. However, arguably, it is not critical in the initial phases of identifying a chemical lead series. It would, therefore, not be in the critical path, but rather on a parallel path, the results of which would inform the project much later in the development stage.",

Although a contract should be in place that specifies the exact contributions of the partners, potential gains, decision-making authorities and conflict resolution, it cannot substitute for the trust needed between individuals involved in the partnership to make the consortium a success. Furthermore, drug development almost never proceeds as initially planned. Consequently, the consortium must be able to accommodate change throughout its lifetime.",

In fact, with the downsizing of in-house research and development departments in commercial operations, the use of consortia will likely expand into other therapeutic areas, well beyond infectious diseases. Lessons learned from the recently established consortia will need to be carefully recorded and applied to future collaborative infrastructures. This will help address the dichotomies between academic and commercial research cultures, and address issues, such as metrics of success, timing of publications and patent applications, collaborative decision making and project management. As parties get educated about the processes and values at partner institutions, information will start to flow more quickly between individuals on project teams, thus streamlining the drug discovery and development process. Individuals who can manage this information appropriately and have the respect and trust of all parties involved will prove to be pivotal team members of these consortia, crucial for the ultimate success.",

The goal in the initial 5 years of funding allocated to AD3C is to identify clinical development candidates for one or more indications. AD3C is coordinated out of the University of Alabama at Birmingham ([UAB]; PI: Richard Whitley), and includes the following institutions in addition to UAB: Academic partners \u2022 Oregon Health and Science University (PIs: Jay A Nelson and Daniel N Streblow) \u2022 Washington University (PI: Michael S Diamond) \u2022 Vanderbilt University (PI: Mark R Denison) \u2022 The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (PIs: Ralph Baric and Mark Heise) \u2022 The University of Colorado, Denver (PI: Thomas Morrison) Not-for-profit partner \u2022 Southern Research (Core Director HTS: J Robert Bostwick; Core Director Medicinal Chemistry: Ashish K Pathak) on developing new therapeutics for four virus families: influenza, flaviruses, coronaviruses and alphaviruses -all projects focus on inhibition of viral replication as the mechanism of action. The academic partners provide the virology knowledge and a deep understanding of the molecular biology of the various viruses under investigation.",
