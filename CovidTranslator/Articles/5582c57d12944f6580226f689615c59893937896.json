            "text": "Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) is the causative agent of porcine transmissible gastroenteritis, and sensitive detection methods are required for preventing the disease. In this article, reverse transcription-loopmediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) was developed to detect TGEV. Three pairs of primers targeting the nucleocapsid (N) gene of TGEV were synthesized and used in the RT-LAMP. The optimization, sensitivity, and specificity of the RT-LAMP were evaluated. Our results showed that the RT-LAMP amplified the N gene with high specificity, efficiency, and rapidity at isothermal condition. The optimal reaction condition was achieved at 60\u00b0C for 30 min. The RT-LAMP assay was more sensitive than gelbased RT-PCR and PCR. It had a higher sensitivity than enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using the equal virus templates. In addition, the established RT-LAMP differentiated TGEV from porcine epidemic diarrhea virus, porcine rotavirus, porcine pseudorabies virus, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus, and avian infectious bronchitis virus. The approach is suitable for detecting TGEV for field diagnostics or in less-equipped laboratories due to its convenience and simplicity.",

            "text": "Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) is the causative agent of transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) of swine. The disease is a highly contagious disease characterized by vomiting, diarrhea, and dehydration, and its mortality rate in seronegative suckling piglets may reach 100% [4, 16] . Prevalence of TGE often results in considerable economic loss to large swine-breeding units. TGEV belongs to the family Coronaviridae and is an enveloped virus with a positive-stranded RNA genome [32] . TGEV consists of four structural proteins: the spike (S) protein, the integral membrane (M) glycoprotein, the minor envelope (E) protein, and the nucleocapsid (N) protein [16, 23, 32] . The S protein plays a crucial role in the induction of neutralizing antibodies [15, 34] , binding to the cellular receptor porcine aminopeptidase N [9, 18, 24] , and mediating viral attachment to target cells [1, 10, 22, 31] . The M protein is a transmembrane protein [35] and is involved in the assembly process of viral nucleocapsid and membrane [29] . The N protein of coronaviruses is phosphorylated protein, interacting with viral genomic RNA forming a helical ribonucleoprotein [19] . The N protein plays crucial roles in viral genome transcription, core formation, and RNA packaging [38] . In addition, the N protein is highly conserved and can be used as a diagnostic target for detecting viral infection.",

            "text": "Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) is a novel DNA amplification method. LAMP uses four to six primers that respectively recognize six to eight regions of target DNA, in conjunction with the enzyme Bst polymerase, which has strand-displacement activity. The synchronization DNA synthesis by these primers guarantees the specificity of the method. Meanwhile, the amplification step performed at isothermal conditions leads to the synthesis of a large amount of DNA. LAMP starts when the forward inner primer (FIP) anneals to the complementary region in the target DNA, resulting in the first-strand synthesis. Then, the outer forward primer (F3) hybridizes and displaces the first strand, forming a loop structure at one end. The resulting single-stranded DNA is the template for backward inner primer (BIP)-initiated DNA synthesis and subsequent outer backward (B3)-primed strand-displacement DNA synthesis. The resulting dumbbell-shaped DNA stem-loop structure is the template for subsequent hybridization between one inner primer and the loop and initiates the displacement DNA synthesis. Consequently, the LAMP assay may form the original stem-loop and a new stemloop that is twice as long and the final products are stemloop DNAs with several inverted repeats of the target DNA and cauliflower-like structures containing multiple loops [20] .",

As a result, TGE prevalence causes enormous economic losses within the pig industry; particularly many related evidences have been reported in China [11] [12] [13] 42 ]. The first case of a TGE outbreak in China was reported in 1956 in Guangdong province [7] . Nowadays, TGE epidemics occur in other parts of mainland China and Taiwan [2, 3, 37, 41] , although inactivated or live vaccines against TGEV are used in some regions in China. Establishment of rapid, sensitive, and cost-effective diagnostic assays for detecting TGEV is highly desirable. In addition to conventional virus isolation, there are other diagnostic methods available for TGEV, for example, Multiplex PCR and multiplex RT-PCR, real-time RT-PCR, restriction fragment length polymorphism, microarray hybridization assay, and blocking ELISA [8, 21, 28, 36, 40] . Although these methods are effective, they may require either high-precision instruments or complicated procedures. Therefore, development of simple, sensitive, and cost-effective assays is required for detecting TGEV infection in fields and in less wellequipped laboratories.",

Therefore, we optimized the reaction conditions of the RT-LAMP by performing the test at different temperature and time to have the highest efficiency. Based on the optimal reaction condition, the sensitivity of the RT-LAMP was compared with that of PCR and RT-PCR. Our data indicated that the sensitivity of the RT-LAMP specific for TGEV was more than 10000 folds than the other methods.

The structural similarity between the N proteins of IBV and PRRSV implies that members of the Coronaviridae and Arteriviridae families share a mechanism of filamentous nucleocapsid formation, with suitable alterations necessary to interact specifically with their respective genomes [14, 26] . Although PrV and PRV are members of the families Herpesviridae and Reoviridae, respectively; they may cause co-infection in pig with TGEV, PEDV, or PRRSV. Therefore, we selected these related animal viruses as control templates to evaluate the utility of the RT-LAMP for TGEV.
