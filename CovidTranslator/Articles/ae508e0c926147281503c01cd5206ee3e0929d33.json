Liposomal form of immunodominant CTL epitope peptides derived from lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus exhibited highly efficient antiviral CTL responses in immunized mice. In this study, we coupled 15 highly conserved immunodominant CTL epitope peptides derived from hepatitis C virus (HCV) to the surface of liposomes. We also emulsified the peptides in incomplete Freund's adjuvant, and compared the immune responses of the two methods of presenting the peptides by cytotoxicity induction and interferon-gamma (IFN-c) production by CD8 + T cells of the immunized mice. We noticed significant variations of the immunogenicity of each peptide between the two antigen delivery systems. In addition, the immunogenicity profiles of the peptides were also different from those observed in the mice infected with recombinant adenoviruses expressing HCV proteins as previously reported. Induction of anti-viral immunity by liposomal peptides was tested by the challenge experiments using recombinant vaccinia viruses expressing corresponding HCV epitopes. One D b -restricted and three HLA-A \u00c3 0201restricted HCV CTL epitope peptides on the surface of liposomes were found to confer complete protection to immunized mice with establishment of long-term memory. Interestingly, their protective efficacy seemed to correlate with the induction of IFN-c producing cells rather than the cytotoxicity induction suggesting that the immunized mice were protected through non-cytolytic mechanisms. Thus, these liposomal peptides might be useful as HCV vaccines not only for prevention but also for therapeutic use.",

Pegylated interferon and ribavirin therapy, although beneficial in about half of treated patients, are expensive and associated with significant side effects [2] . In this clinical context there is an urgent need for the development of a therapeutic and/or prophylactic HCV vaccine [3] . It is well documented that major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I-restricted, CD8 + cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) play a major role in the immune control of various virus infections. In the case of HCV infection, spontaneous resolution of acute HCV infection was associated with vigorous HCV-specific CTL responses in chimpanzees [4] and humans [5, 6] . Hence, HCV-specific CTLs are likely to be crucial to eradicate HCV.",

Single immunization of as low as 280 ng of liposomal peptide along with CpG conferred complete protection to the immunized mice which was also effective against a highly virulent mutant strain, clone 13. In addition, a long-term memory induction was achieved in the absence of CD4 + T cell help.

On the basis of those results, 24 peptides tested were classified into six groups. In this study, we chose 14 out of the 24 peptides from the five groups and coupled them as well as one murine MHC-restricted HCV CTL epitope peptide on the surfaces of liposomes.

Target cells were pulsed with or without 10 lM of each peptide for 2 h, and then labeled with Na 51 2 CrO 4 for 1 h. The labeled target cells were plated with effector cells at an effector to target (E/T) ratio of 100. After a 4-h incubation, the radioactivity of the supernatant was counted. Percent lysis was calculated as [(cpm sample \u00c0cpm spontaneous )/(cpm maximum \u00c0cpm spontaneous )] \u00c2 100. Maximum 51 Cr release was determined from supernatants of cells that were lysed by addition of 2% Nonidet P-40.

P-603 induced lower responses in 51 Cr-release (Fig. 1A) and ELISPOT assays (Fig. 1B) compared to Lip-603, and did not show significant protection in the challenge experiments (Fig. 1C) . HLA-A \u00c3 0201-restricted HCV epitope peptides also showed considerable differences in immunogenicity between the liposomal and emulsion forms ( Fig. 2A and B) . A2-5 peptide in IFA induced both cytolytic and IFN-c responses whereas the same peptide on the surface of liposomes predominantly induced cytolytic activity. On the other hand, A2-11 and A2-12 showed opposite results: P-A2-11 and P-A2-12 mainly induced cytolytic responses, and L-A2-11 and L-A2-12 induced strong IFN-c responses rather than cytolytic responses. A2-8 on liposomes showed strong responses in both assays whereas that in IFA induced only cytolytic responses. A2-7 was found to be a strong inducer of cytolytic activity when emulsified in IFA, but on the surface of liposomes, induced neither cytolytic nor IFN-c responses.",

Interestingly, these three liposomal peptides were the strongest inducer of IFN-c responses (Fig. 2B) . In contrast, Lip-A2-5 was found to induce only non-reproducible protection with a titer reduction of less than two logs although it was a strong inducer of cytolytic activity. These lines of evidence suggest that the anti-viral activity induced by liposomal peptides is mediated by non-cytolytic mechanisms related to IFN-c responses. Similar observations were obtained in our previous study [8] . LCMV-derived D b -restricted epitope peptide NP396, on the liposomes, induced strong IFN-c responses but no cytolytic responses, and the mice were highly protected against LCMV challenge. Both LCMV and HCV have been reported to be susceptible to non-cytolytic anti-viral mechanisms [19] [20] [21] . Taken together, the peptides on the surface of liposomes may have an advantage in application for therapeutic use in that virus-infected cells may be eliminated without tissue damages. Further studies are needed to clarify this issue.",

            "text": "We speculate that the mechanisms underlying the induction of different immunogenicities of the peptides by coupling to the sur-face of liposomes are associated with the differences in the antigen presentation mechanisms. Peptides emulsified in IFA are thought to fit into the pockets of MHC class I molecules on APCs replacing the original endogenously synthesized peptides and presented to CD8 + T cells [22] . On the other hand, we have shown that antigens chemically coupled to the surface of liposomes consisting of unsaturated fatty acids (oleoyl liposomes) are cross-presented by APCs [7] . Our further study has shown that oleoyl liposomes might be taken up by APCs via at least two pathways: fusion with and penetration of plasma membranes, and pinocytosis [23] . These unique antigen presentation mechanisms may be responsible for the unique immunogenicity and anti-viral potency of the peptide antigens. The 14 HLA-A \u00c3 0201-restricted epitope peptides have been characterized for their immunogenicity in our previous study by analyzing the immune responses of mice immunized with recombinant adenoviruses that expressed HCV proteins [11] . The immunogenicity profiles in response to the adenovirus-vectored c-producing cells responding to a relevant peptide were detected by ELISPOT assays. The group number (I-V) in which each epitope was classified in our previous study [11] ( Table 1) immunization were quite different from any of those obtained from the two types of peptide vaccinations ( Fig. 2A and B) . In adenovirus vaccination, the peptides were endogenously synthesized and presented by MHC class I molecules on virus-infected cells. Therefore, the immunogenicity profile induced by this third antigen presentation mechanism may also support our hypothesis that these different immunization systems result in different antigen presentations and therefore different immune responses.",

The mouse received the second immunization at day 11. Spleen cells were prepared seven days after the last immunization for 51Cr release assays (A) and ELISPOT assays (B). (A) 51Cr release assays were performed at E/T ratio of 100 using EL-4 cells pulsed with 603 peptide as targets. Spontaneous release was 11%-16%. (B) IFN-c-producing cells responding to 603 peptide were detected by ELISPOT assays as described in Section 2. (C) The immunized and na\u00efve mice were challenged at one week after the last immunization with 2 \u00c2 106 PFU of VV-NS3 (i.p.) and the virus titers in the ovaries were quantitated by plaque assays on BS-C-1 cells at day 5 postchallenge. Virus titers are indicated for each animal in the study. A dotted line represents the lower limit of detection(2 \u00c2 102 PFU/Ovary). (D) Challenge experiments were performed at one and 12 weeks for C57BL/6 mice (closed circles) and CD4 KO mice (open circles) immunized with Lip-603. (E) Dose-response experiments. Serial fivefold dilutions of Lip-603 starting at 50 ll (<35 lg of peptide) were prepared in 50 ll of PBS containing 5 lg of CpG and injected s.c. to each C57BL/6 mouse. Seven days later, ELISPOT (IFN-c) assays were performed for spleen cells from immunized mice. Data are representative of two independent and reproducible experiments.

At one week after the second immunization, spleen cells were taken and their cytotoxicity and production of IFN-c in response to the corresponding peptide were determined by 51Cr-release assays (A) and ELISPOT assays (B).
