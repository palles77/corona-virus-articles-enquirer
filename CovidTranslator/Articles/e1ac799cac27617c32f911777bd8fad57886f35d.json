We established acute encephalomyelitis in mice by the intravenous (i.v.) inoculation of Theiler's virus GD VII strain. Replication of Theiler's virus injected i.v. could be observed in both the brain and spinal cord of mice, and interferon (IFN)-y could be detected in the extracts of brain and spinal cord in parallel with viral replication. Furthermore, by the injection of anti-IFN-y monoclonal antibody (mAb) on Day 1 post-infection (p.i.), mortality and virus titres in the spinal cord increased compared with the control mice treated with normal rat globulin. The histological exacerbation of inflammation was observed in spinal cord of anti-IFN-~/ mAb-treated mice. These results indicate that endogenous IFN-y, produced locally in the brain and spinal cord of mice through both antiviral action and anti-inflammatory action of IFN-~/ in central nervous system, plays an important role in Theiler's virus infection. * Correspondmg author.

            "text": "There are many strains of Theiler's virus isolated from mice. They are divided into two subgroups on the basis of differences in biological behavior (Lipton, 1975; Lorch et al., 1981) , antigenicity (Nitayaphan et al., 1985) , and RNase T oligonucleotide two-dimensional maps (Lorch et al., 1981) . Strains belonging to the subgroup GD VII (GD VII and FA strains) produce an acute neural infection in mice with neither demyelina-tion nor virus persistence (Lipton, 1980) . Strains in subgroup TO (TO and DA strains), produce a biphasic disease consisting of poliomyelitis occurring within a few days post-infection (p.i.), followed by persistent infection with chronic paralysis and demyelination manifestation after a latency of several weeks (Friedman and Lorch, 1985) . The acute phase of infection caused by both subgroups is characterized by the replication of the virus in CNS gray matter, causing disease resembling poliomyelitis (Lipton, 1980) . In the acute neural infection by Theiler's virus, cellular immune mechanisms might be involved in the protection of mice. Administration of cyclophosphamide, anti-L3T4 serum, and other inhibitors of immune function (e.g. silica quartz dust, protease inhibitors) to Theiler's virus TO strain-infected mice resulted in severe acute encephalomyelitis and high mortality (Lipton and Dal Canto, 1977; Rodriguez and Quddus, 1986; Welsh et al., 1987; Rodriguez and Sriram, 1988; Paya et al., 1989) . Gamma interferon (IFN-y) has been postulated to be an important cytokine which modulates immune effector cells during CNS inflammation. For example, endogenous IFN-y was detected in the cerebrospinal fluid of experimental viral inflammation (Frei et al., 1988) , and acute aseptic meningitis (Abbott et al., 1987) . Therefore, it is possible that IFN-T might play an important role in the protection against Theiler's virus infection.",

There are only a few reports on the kinetics of endogenous IFN-7 production during infections. In listerial infection, endogenous IFN-y production coincided with bacterial growth (Nakane et al., 1990) . Our present data also indicate that endogenous IFN-y production coincides with the viral replication (Fig. 1) . We speculate that endogenous IFN-y is produced by cells which are stimulated with the virus. Therefore, it is reasonable that the peak of viral replication coincides with that of endogenous IFN-T production. IFN-T in infectious diseases has been reported to induce activated macrophages (Buchmeier and Schreiber, 1985; Suzuki et al., 1988) and other immune effector cells (Biron et al., 1983; Habu et al., 1984; Spintalny and Havell, 1984; Issekutz et al., 1988) . In viral infections, IFN-7 may be effective in both the activation of immune effector cells and the induction of antiviral states. In our present study, the enhancement of viral replication was observed after histological changes in the spinal cord (Figs. 4A and 5). If endogenous IFN-7 acted on only on the induction of the antiviral state in the host, an increase of viral replication by treatment with anti-IFN-7 mAb might precede the histological changes. Alternatively, the inhibition or the elimination of the virus by immune effector cells through anti-IFN-y mAb might cause an histological exacerbation. Nevertheless, in the brain, enhancement of viral replication and histological exacerbation were not observed. In Theiler's virus infection, inflammatory cell infiltration consisted mainly of macrophages in the spinal cord until 7-10 days p.i.; and T cells and macrophages were present in the brain from 4-5 days p.i. Treatment with anti-T cell receptor-a/3 augmented viral replication in brain, but not in spinal cord (unpublished data). Therefore, we speculate that endogenous IFN-T produced in Theiler's virus infection might act as a macrophage activating factor and activated macrophages might be important in protecting the spinal cord. On the other hand, the protective mechanism in brain might be dependent on T cells.",

(1992) showed that anti-lFN-7 mAb treatment exacerbated experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE). They speculated that a feed back regulatory loop existed between transforming growth factor (TGF)-/3 and IFN-T, and neutralization of IFN-T by the mAb may prevent TGF-/3 release (Twardzik et al., 1990) . TGF-/3 has been shown to abrogate the transfer of EAE by encephalitogenic T cell lines (Kuruvilla et al., 1991) . It is possible that an anti-inflammatory effect of endogenous IFN-7 might act as a protector against the destruction of CNS tissue by Theiler's infection.",
