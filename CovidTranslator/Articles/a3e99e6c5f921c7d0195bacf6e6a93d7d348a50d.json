The disease, which caught health officials in the region off guard, was soon identified as the Ebola virus disease (EVD), a disease with a case fatality rate of 90% (Heymann, 2015) . The Ebola epidemic wreaking havoc in West Africa has led to a global ripple effect that has affected the United States and other Western countries. In the absence of a vaccine or treatment for Ebola, the disease has alarmed the global public health community and caused panic among some segments of the population. The fear associated with Ebola, a deadly disease that respects no borders or socioeconomic status, has captured the attention of the global health community (Baden et al., 2014) . Although Ebola has been around since 1976 (Piot, 2012) , with past outbreaks contained in Uganda and Congo, many people do not have the knowledge of how the disease is contracted and spread, and, thus, fears and myths continue unabated. At the time of this writing, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), worldwide a total of 17,145 cases of EVD have been reported in five affected countries (Guinea, Liberia, Mali, Sierra Leone, and the United States) and three previously affected countries (Nigeria, Senegal, and Spain) up to November 30, 2014 . Globally, there have been 6,070 reported deaths (WHO, 2014a) . Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea remain the epicenter of the disease. As of November 30, 2014, WHO reports 2,164 cumulative cases and 1,327 deaths in Guinea; 7,635 cumulative cases and 3,145 deaths in Liberia; and 7,312 cumulative cases and 1,583 cumulative deaths in Sierra Leone. Among the three countries at the epicenter of the disease, 17,111 cumulative cases and 6,055 cumulative deaths have been reported (WHO, 2014a) . Although the number of new cases is reported to be stabilizing, the situation in these countries remains uncertain, with no treatment in sight. A map of countries at the epicenter of the Ebola epidemic in West Africa is displayed in Figure 1 .",

Because Ebola is an unprecedented disease that threatens the global community, international health agencies and the private sector are in a race with time to develop appropriate medications and potential vaccines to treat and prevent the disease. Although the advancement of such solutions is paramount, it is important to look beyond the current epidemic by examining factors that have led to such inefficiencies in the affected countries' health care systems.",

Because the dire necessity in West Africa is so immense, opportunities to make a difference are many for American health care professionals, including nurses, individually and collectively. A critical factor lacking in the fight to address the current Ebola outbreak in West Africa is the absence of better delineation of contextual factors that serve as challenges to mitigating the spread of the disease. What are the individual, structural, and community factors that impede efforts to address Ebola in the West African countries at the epicenter of the epidemic? Also, despite the devastating effect of the disease on populations, the Ebola epidemic should be viewed as an opportunity for reorienting health care delivery systems and building countries' capacities at a level such that they are capable of addressing new and future outbreaks of Ebola-like infectious diseases in sub-Saharan Africa.",

Although many view the disease primarily from a problem-based perspective, we contend that there are multiple opportunities for the prevention and control of Ebola and future infectious disease outbreaks in the West African setting. We maintain that, as with most controversial health and social issues, embracing a community-based, participatory approach in which key members of the public participate in decision making on how to mitigate the impact of Ebola on their communities would be a viable approach. Such approaches should also focus on the assets and resiliency of local health care workers and the affected populations.",

Therefore, a combination of centralized \"top-down\" and decentralized \"bottom-up\" approaches is proposed, as is the need to include trust-building capacities in order to work effectively (Chowdhury, 2012) . In the case of the Ebola epidemic in West Africa, the use of the bottomup approach (i.e., an empowerment model that creates opportunities for public health frontline workers to engage leaders and members of local communities to discuss factors surrounding the disease) is essential. Within the context of the bottom-up approach, community leaders are regarded as important stakeholders and knowledge reservoirs in contributing positively to programs that embrace and represent the values of their community members. The bottom-up approach has been used in several developing countries in designing effective primary health care programs (Chowdhury, 2012; Magnussen, Ehiri, & Jolly, 2004) . Thus, combining an array of individual-, structural-, and community-level factors directed at curtailing the Ebola epidemic in West Africa is essential.",

First, Ebola is being presented as a fatal disease that spans global boundaries and has now spread to several Western countries, including the United States. Second, public health officials cannot afford to be complacent about the emerging and re-emerging infections. During the last 2 decades, the public health community has witnessed a series of emerging and reemerging infections (e.g., subacute respiratory tract infection, avian flu, H1N1, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, and now Ebola in West Africa), all of which have put the global public health community on high alert. A third perspective is that when infectious disease outbreaks occur in developing countries, these countries are unlikely to have adequately resourced and staffed health care facilities capable of addressing the spread of the disease and managing those who are already infected. International agencies should review existing pandemic plans in an effort to increase their efforts to control outbreaks in the future. Could the Ebola outbreak in West Africa be a prelude to bigger outbreaks to come, potentially a different type of virus, maybe a more lethal virus and one spread via the airborne route?",

In many ways, the advent of the Ebola epidemic in West Africa has intensified and broadened the challenges faced by health care professionals, including nurses, working on the frontlines in developing countries. The situation in West Africa is compounded by the lack of health care workers skilled in the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases. Despite the bravery and resilience of the nurses and the efforts of other health care workers in the affected countries, Ebola has threatened the productivity of nurses and led to increased attrition and lower morale. If these structural factors are not addressed, the quality of care for Ebola patients and patients suffering from other conditions could be even further threatened.",

Although the exact numbers of health care workers who have contracted Ebola and who have died from the disease is unknown and inaccurate, Ebola has taken the lives of prominent doctors and nurses in Sierra Leone, Liberia, and Guinea, depriving these countries not only of experienced and dedicated medical care but also of inspirational national heroes (WHO, 2014b) .

First, scientists' quests to increase our understanding of the epidemiology and pathogenesis of the Ebola virus will help us prevent and manage the disease. Along with such epidemiological research, policy makers should also conduct research aimed at understanding the barriers to addressing Ebola. Whether the current efforts being mounted to address the Ebola outbreak in West African are successful will depend heavily on engagement and collaboration with the people in the affected communities. As far as we know, there are no reports about local populations' beliefs and attitudes about Ebola and what they think about the response efforts from their national governments and international organizations relative to the Ebola outbreak. This is an opportunity to assess the perceptions of those who have the disease as well as those at risk of contracting it, including family members. This is especially important in the rush to develop effective treatment and a vaccine. In one of the few studies exploring the cultural contexts of a past Ebola outbreak in Northern Uganda, investigators found that indigenous epidemic control measures and some cultural practices (e.g., burial practices) amplified the outbreak (Hewlett & Amola, 2003) . Hewlett and Amola conclude that consideration must be given to the narratives of local populations relative to the Ebola outbreak.

An integrative approach will also have greater potential for preventing the spread of Ebola to other sub-Saharan African countries. If policy makers become complacent and ignore the interconnected challenges and opportunities outlined and described in this article, they run the risk of seeing current efforts aimed at addressing the spread of the disease reversed.
