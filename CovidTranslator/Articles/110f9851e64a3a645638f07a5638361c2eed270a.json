[1] investigated the possible role of viruses in 107 episodes of acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD). They used modern diagnostic tests, including immunofluorescence assay and polymerase chain reaction, on nasopharyngeal aspirates. They identified infections in 64% of cases, with viruses as probable responsible pathogens in 43%: influenza type A (13%) and rhinovirus (8%) were the most common organisms. Bacteria were found in 23% of cases, with Haemophilus influenzae as the most common pathogen (11%). The authors failed to find significant differences in clinical characteristics and outcome between virusinfected and noninfected patients. In his related editorial, Luyt [2] comments more generally on virus in intensive care unit (ICU) patients, emphasizing (1) the questionable relationship between viral diseases and outcome, (2) the doubtful reliability of modern diagnostic tests with a risk of false-positive results and (3) as a consequence, the relevance of viral detection in respiratory tract secretions: detection of a virus does not mean infection.",

After thoracentesis, they found that 45% of these patients complicated parapneumonic effusions or empyemas. The presumptive causes of such complicated infected pleural effusions were hospital-acquired pneumonia (47%), community-acquired pneumonia (46%) or primary empyema (5%). Cultures were positive in 75% of cases and isolated anaerobes or Candida species were found in less than 10% of cases. Among the 55 patients with positive cultures and nontuberculous effusions, 20 received initial inadequate antibiotic treatment, with a mortality rate of 75% vs 46% in the 35 patients whose treatment had been adequate. These data confirm that complicated parapneumonic effusions and empyemas are severe disease in medical ICU patients, and that inadequate initial antimicrobial therapy is an important prognostic factor.",

Three of the five cases occurred early in the outbreak (within 10 days of admission of the first patient with SARS), suggesting that infection control procedures must be applied rigorously from the start of an epidemic.

To avoid the transportation of patients outside the ICU, transnasal puncture based on sinus echography merits valuation. To this end, Vargas et al. [7] conducted a prospective study in 60 patients with a clinical suspicion of maxillary sinusitis (120 sinuses were examined). The definition of positive echography was the visualization of the hyperechogenic posterior wall of the sinus associated or not with extension to the internal and external walls of the sinus. When sinus ultrasound was positive, a transnasal puncture was performed and considered as positive if fluid was obtained from sinus aspiration. The study was designed to evaluate the value of echography to obtain positive transnasal puncture. Sinus ultrasound was positive in 84 cases, and 78 of these 84 transnasal punctures were positive. On the other hand, when sinus ultrasound was negative, no sinusitis was observed on CT. This study suggests that transnasal puncture could be performed directly on the results of a sinus echography. However, as other echographic examination, sinus ultrasound can be operator-dependent. Thus, before generalization, precise description and standardization of this procedure in the specific population of mechanically ventilated patients must be specified.",

Measures to prevent VAP extend into all aspects of daily intensive care practice, including oral care and the suction of respiratory secretions. Mori et al. [8] studied whether oral care contributes to preventing VAP by comparing 1,252 patients who received oral care with 414 historical controls. The oral care nursing plan included the following protocol three times daily: (1) suction of oropharyngeal secretions after increasing cuff pressure; (2) position the patient's head to the side and assess the conditions of soft and hand tissues in the oral cavity, cleanse the oral cavity using a swab soaked in 20-fold diluted povidone-iodine gargle; (3) cleanse the oral cavity using a tooth brush and rinse with 30 ml weakly acidic water; (4) repeat cleansing with the povidone-iodine-soaked swab; (5) suction of the oral cavity and the portion of the trachea above the cuff followed by restoration of the cuff pressure. With such a protocol, the incidence of VAP decreased from 10.4% in the control group to 3.9% in the oral care group; in particular, in the case of early-onset VAP (VAP occurring within 48-96 h after the start of MV), it was one-tenth that observed in the non-oral care group. No differences were observed in the outcome variables. Unfortunately, this study evaluating nonpharmacological simple measures was conducted over an 8-year period with introduction of new methods for preventing VAP (semi-recumbent positioning, subglottic secretion drainage, closed tracheal suction devices, non-use of H2-blockers) which introduce confounding effects over such a long study period. The results of this study confirm the important impact of oral care on the occurrence of VAP, suggesting that this variable has to be controlled in each study evaluating pharmacological and nonpharmacological prophylactic measures, particularly in the case of multicentre trials.",

Overall, 1,913 patients (26% of admissions) received SDD (colistin, tobramycin, amphotericin B). Resistance rates remained low during the 5-year period, whether for MRSA (2.76 and 2.58 isolates/1000 patientdays), or for aminoglycoside resistance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa (0.24/1000 patient-days), both well below the SARI average (4.26/1000 and 0.52/1,000 patient-days, respectively). However, the relative frequency of enterococci and coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) was higher than in SARI (23.2% vs 17.3% and 25.0% vs 20.6%, respectively).

Since physically dissolved oxygen reflected by partial venous oxygen pressure can be neglected and haemoglobin might remain constant over the period of time of measurement, SvO 2 could be used as a parameter able to describe peripheral oxygenation. SvO 2 measurement necessitates the insertion of a pulmonary artery catheter, which is now considered a costly and invasive procedure. Alternatively, the measurement of ScvO 2 with commercially available fibreoptic catheters has been suggested. In healthy subjects the oxygen saturation in the inferior vena cava is higher than in the superior vena cava, and thus SvO 2 is su-perior to ScvO 2 . By contrast, in critically ill patients ScvO 2 is superior to SvO 2 , since inferior vena cava saturation is lower than ScvO 2 during cardio-circulatory shock and/or anaesthesia. This latter procedure reduces cerebral oxygen extraction, increases cerebral blood flow and thus increases ScvO 2 .",

In 16 septic shock patients receiving norepinephrine, these authors demonstrated that the mean SvO 2 was always below the mean ScvO 2 . The bias of difference (ScvO 2 -SvO 2 ) was 4.2%, and 95% limits of agreement ranged from -8.1% to 16.5%.

To confirm that the MV-induced pulse-pressure variation could be the consequence of MV-induced SV variation, there was a need for technologies allowing acquisition of beat-by-beat SV values. Two modalities were developed and validated for this purpose, i. e. oesophageal Doppler and pulse contour cardiac output (PCCO). Although both techniques report beat-to-beat changes in SV neither has been shown to accurately measure beat-to-beat changes in SV rather than steady-state cardiac output averaged over time. Gunn et al., in an experimental study including a very small population of five purpose-bred research hounds, tested the ability of these two techniques to predict absolute changes in SV determined by one of two gold standards: aortic root flow probe or conductance catheter, which gave estimates of left ventricle SV as the difference between measured maximal and minimal left ventricle volume [28] . These authors demonstrated that for any given haemodynamic state in their study (baseline, norepinephrine, nitroprusside and dobutamine), both the oesophageal Doppler monitoring-derived stroke distance and PCCO derived SV accurately, following the directional changes in aortic flow probe-derived SV. However, these two techniques did not estimate consistently absolute SV values or track the proportional changes in SV compared with aortic flow probe determination.",

For the PCCO device, the three-element Windkessel model used to determine SV could be erroneous when arterial tone or myocardial contractility varies. This paper suffered from many methodological limitations, which suggests further studies with a more appropriate and well-validated design to confirm or refute these potential limitations [29] . However, this experimental study did not preclude the use of these two techniques to assess fluid responsiveness in critically ill patients, [30] since volume expansion has no significant influence on arterial tone, cardiac contractility and blood flow redistribution able to induce measurement error in the determination of absolute values of SV.

To reach the same objective, a significant larger infusion of saline (1,800 ml) than colloid (1,600 ml) was required and was associated with a significant decrease in the colloid osmotic pressure in the saline group and a significant increase in the plasma volume in the colloid group (3% vs 19%). Colloid infusion induced a larger and significant increase in cardiac index and stroke work index than saline infusion without a difference between the colloid groups. Verheij et al. [35] suggested that the difference in fluid response between crystalloid and colloid fluids referred only to differences in cardiac filling rather than in cardiac function. In their study the lack of change in the slope of the relationship of filling pressure to global end-diastolic volume index suggested no difference in myocardial compliance among the groups even though colloid osmotic pressure was higher in the colloid groups. Lastly, it might be emphasized that whatever the group, the increase in mean arterial pressure was similar.

Due to some methodological problems met during the study and to the very desperate prognosis of this cohort of patients selected as nonresponders to initial defibrillation, this trial must be seen primarily as an effectiveness study, since it suffered from a lack of power. Bertrand et al. reported no significant difference in outcome regarding return to spontaneous ventilation (CFIO 21% vs 20% with MV), hospital admission (17% vs 16 %) and ICU discharge (2.4% vs 2.3%). The main finding of their study concerned the improved detection of SpO 2 in patients ventilated with CFIO. The exact mechanism of this observation needs clarification, even if its relationship with a significant increase in survival was not demonstrated. However this observation suggests that peripheral circulation and oxygenation was more improved with CFIO than with conventional MV. Lastly, a lower incidence of rib cage fracture was observed in the CFIO group. By increasing pulmonary volume and intrathoracic pressure CFIO could have attenuated chest wall injury secondary to chest massage. CFIO appears to be a safe method to provide ventilation during cardio-pulmonary resuscitation and could be used instead of conventional MV if a MV device is not available.",

Lung protein permeability or pulmonary leak index was assessed by 67 Ga-labeled transferrin and 99m Tc-labeled red blood cells. Extravascular lung water (EVLW) and intrathoracic or pulmonary blood volume (ITBV/PBV) were also measured by thermal-dye dilution as an index of permeability.

The algorithm employed adapts the level of PS to continuously monitored patient data, pursuing the goal of keeping the patient in a zone defined as a respiratory rate < 30 bpm, tidal volume above a minimum threshold set by the operator according to the patient's body weight, and end-tidal expiratory CO 2 < 55 mmHg. In this physiological study this automatic system was applied for 45 min after initial start-up in conventional PS. During this brief period the closed-loop mode was well tolerated, minute ventilation was kept constant and respiratory rate significantly dropped from its pre-NIV value, so that also PaCO 2 was significantly decreased in the subgroup of hypercapnic patients.

Various types of asynchrony were defined (i. e. double triggering, ineffective triggering, autotriggering, short and prolonged cycles). Asynchrony detection was based on flow and airway pressure signals analyzed by two blinded investigators and was defined as the number of asynchrony events divided by the total respiratory rate computed as the sum of the number of ventilator cycles and of wasted efforts. 15/62 (24%) had a significant asynchrony (i. e. > 10% of the respiratory efforts), with double triggering being more common during ACV, while no difference with PS was found for ineffective triggering. This latter was associated with less sensitive inspiratory trigger, higher level of PS, higher tidal volume and pH. A high incidence of asynchrony was also associated with a longer duration of MV.

Although with both modes minute ventilation was preserved after load application, during PAV+ the patients were able to maintain constant minute ventilation with statistically significant less inspiratory effort than during PS. In addition, with PAV+ the index of neuroventilatory coupling remained relatively independent of load and the magnitude of load induced tidal volume reduction and breathing frequency increase was significantly smaller than with PS.

The combination of the two indices, i. e. f /V T and P I /MIP, was able to accurately predict weaning outcome, providing prognostic information not offered by either index alone. In particular, the prospective validation showed that the chosen cut-off point had 89% sensitivity, 67% specificity and 85% correct classifications. The combination was also superior to any index alone.",

            "text": "The pathophysiology underlying weaning failure is complex, and the relative weight of the different factors involved is not completely understood. In particular, most of the indices proposed are related to assess the function of the respiratory pump and/or gas exchange, while little emphasis has been placed so far on the cardiac function and, in particular, volume status. Mekontso-Dessap et al. [69] investigated the role of B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), a powerful marker of cardiac dysfunction, in the weaning process. One hundred and two patients were prospectively recruited when considered ready to undergo a 1-h weaning trial, where BNP was measured just before and at the end. Logistic regression analysis identified high BNP level before the trial and the product of airway pressure and breathing frequency as independent risk factors for weaning failure. Interestingly, the subset of patients in whom the weaning process failed, but then succeeded on a later occasion after diuretic therapy, decreased their BNP levels from those recorded at the time of the first attempt. Given that BNP is a predictor of left ventricular dysfunction and its plasma level correlated to left ventricular filling pressure, the authors concluded that this hormone could be useful to guide therapy when managing acute left ventricular failure or fluid overload during weaning.",

            "text": "Among the weaning indices, f /V T has been most frequently used in clinical practice in the past few years, based on a study published in the year 1991. The usefulness of this index has been recently challenged by the ACCP Task Force, which concluded in its meta-analysis that f /V T is not reliable in predicting weaning outcome. Tobin and Jubran [70] extracted data from all the studies using this index as a weaning predictor in an attempt to determine whether variation in the reliability of f /VT was explained by spectrum and test-referral bias, as reflected by variation in pre-test probability of success. As a matter of fact a meta-analysis is statistically valid when it is free of significant heterogeneity. The authors found a marked heterogeneity in pre-test probability of success outcome among studies in the meta-analysis. They also entered the data from the ACCP Task Force into a bayesian model using the pre-probability test (prevalence of success) as the operating point, and they found that post-test probabilities of success were closely correlated with the values predicted by the original 1991 study (r = 0.86 for positive predicted value and r = 0.82 for negative predictive value). Average sensitivity, considered the most precise measure of screening-test reliability, was 0.87, and average specificity was 0.52. Thus, contrary to the conclusion reached by the ACCP Task Force, it was demonstrated that f /V T index is a reliable screening test for successful weaning. This paper was accompanied by an editorial by Connors [71] . The complex mathematical procedure of the paper might have obscured to the average reader what was the main point of the study. It is true that Tobin and Jubran reevaluated the value of f /V T , but according to the editorial, the paper also asks us to change the way we think about the process of weaning. The f /V T index can be thought of as a screening test with high sensitivity but relatively low specificity, and should therefore be employed very early in the course of MV to identify patients, as soon as possible, who can breathe on their own. Applying a confirmatory test thereafter increases the specificity of the combined tests and reduces the number of false positives. This model may prove very useful for minimizing time on the ventilator and reducing the discomfort and risk of continued intubation in a patient who is ready to wean.",
