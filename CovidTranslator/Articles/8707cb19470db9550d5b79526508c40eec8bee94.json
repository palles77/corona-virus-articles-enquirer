The model was based on the particularly bad 2008 dengue virus (a virus related to Zika and also transmitted by the Aedes aegypti mosquito) season in Rio, when new infections peaked at more than 25 000 per week. Some of the same authors have since published an updated estimate of Zika virus infection in August in Rio of about one to three per 100 000. 4 Thus, up to 15 of the 500 000 visitors to the Olympic Games might contract Zika virus, of whom some might carry the virus back to their home countries. As Attaran points out, it takes just one infected traveller to start an outbreak in a country with suitable conditions. Grills and colleagues 5 have assessed the question of which countries are susceptible to ongoing Zika virus transmission resulting from introduction by a single traveller to the games. 5 Four countries-Chad, Djibouti, Eritrea, and Yemenwere estimated to be uniquely at risk because \"they do not have a substantial number of travelers to any country with local Zika virus transmission, except for anticipated travel to the Games\". 5 To answer the issue of additional global health risk posed by the games, Grills and colleagues state: \"With the exception of four countries, attendance at the Games does not pose a unique or",

However, the 92% fi gure cited in the Editorial related to the proportion of confi rmed cases of Zika virus-associated microcephaly found in the Northeast Region. Latest fi gures show that 86% of such cases are in the Northeast Region, whereas only 6\u00b76% are in the Southeast Region, of which Rio is part. 2 This disparity between numbers of cases of Zika virus infection and of microcephaly suggests variations in case detection or notification, or, perhaps, that unknown cofactors contribute to manifestation of microcephaly.

Thus, for the four countries, the games represent a relative increased risk compared with routine travel, but, based on the estimate given above, 4 the absolute risk of any traveller from these countries being infected with Zika virus during the games is miniscule: Grills and colleagues project a total delegation, including athletes, from the four countries of just 79 people. 5 The debate over whether the Olympic and Paralympic Games will spur global dissemination of Zika virus (and other infectious diseases from similar mass gatherings) can perhaps be distilled into two points of view. First, through rapid, global travel, the opportunities for spread are already so great that additional games-related travel make no meaningful difference, a view supported by the risk assessments described above. An alternative argument is that however small the risk, the potential harm outweighs the benefits of holding the games and the risk should not be taken. But the ultimate conclusion of the latter viewpoint is to ban all travel to and from Zika-aff ected countries.",
