Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation resulted in decreased mortality (RR 0.41; 95% CI 0.26 to 0.64), fewer intubations (RR 0.42; 95% CI 0.31 to 0.59), and fewer treatment failures (RR 0.51; 95% CI 0.39 to 0.67). Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation also resulted in improvements in acidosis within the first hour (weighted mean difference increased pH 0.03; 95% CI 0.02 to 0.04), PaCO 2 (weighted mean difference -0.40 kPa; 95% CI -0.78 to -0.03 kPa), and respiratory rate (weighted mean difference -3.08 beats/ min; 95% CI -4.26 to -1.89 beats/min). Finally, common complications associated with treatment (RR 0.32; 95% CI apy. Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation is a treatment approach available to many emergency physicians; however, until now, evidence was conflicting with respect to its benefit. This systematic review examined the highest-quality evidence from 8 randomized controlled trials examining noninvasive positive pressure ventilation use in acute chronic obstructive pulmonary disease associated with respiratory failure that met the authors' inclusion criteria. The pooled evidence demonstrates statistically significant and clinically meaningful reductions in mortality, intubations, lengths of stay, and deterioration in status. Moreover, complications associated with treatment and length of hospital stay were also reduced in the group receiving noninvasive positive pressure ventilation.",

Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation uses a full facial or nasal mask that administers ventilatory support from a flow generator. It enhances ventilation by unloading fatigued respiratory muscles and keeps collapsed alveoli open to improve ventilation-perfusion matching. Despite some variation, trials reported use for at least 6 hours per day. The expiratory pressure setting was kept constant and ranged from 2 to 6 cm H 2 O, and the inspiratory pressure ranged from 9 to 30 cm H 2 O. It is worth noting that all patients in these studies were treated in hospital settings and received aggressive medical management for their condition. In addition, the recent worldwide severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak and its apparent spread after nebulization, noninvasive positive pressure ventilation, and mechanical ventilation has discouraged noninvasive positive pressure ventilation use in some centers. 7",

A trial of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation should be considered early in the course of respiratory failure, and before severe acidosis ensues, as a means of avoiding endotracheal intubation, reducing mortality, and avoiding treatment failure. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is one of the few major chronic disease in which mortality has been increasing over the past decade. 1 Patients with this disease commonly present to the emergency department (ED) with exacerbations, and disease severity is often high. For example, in a recent North American study of patients presenting to the ED with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease symptoms, the proportion of patients admitted was greater than 59%, ED length of stay was nearly 6 hours, and mechanical ventilation was higher than in other acute respiratory presentations such as asthma. 2 Despite advances in treatments 3 (eg, corticosteroids, antibiotics) and the creation of guidelines, 4-6 the acute management of these patients is complicated and results in a rather \"shotgun\" ED approach.",

This is usually achieved with diagnostic workup and concomitant treatment with bronchodilators, corticosteroids, antibiotics, and low-dose oxygen ther-strive to implement this treatment option in patients with respiratory failure associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Blinding. Because of the nature of the intervention (applying a mask to the patient), double-blinding of treatment assignment was not possible for the noninvasive positive pressure ventilation studies. Double-blinding is considered an important methodological marker of quality in randomized controlled trials, and empirical research suggests that unblinded studies overestimate the treatment effect. 8 Some quality assessment scoring systems evaluate clinical trials by assessing the presence or absence of blinding. The trials in this review were scored using one of these scoring systems 9 and received somewhat lower scores because of their lack of blinding. Many researchers have difficulty defining the term blinding, and agreement on the meaning of \"double-blinding\" has been shown to be poor. 10 Consequently, many authors now report on the levels of blinding used in a trial. For example, double-blinding typically refers to the patient and treating physician being unaware of the assigned intervention. Other levels of blinding in a trial can be applied to outcome assessment, data entry, data analysis, and even interpretation of results; efforts can be made so that researchers will not be influenced by the knowledge of assignment. The importance of issues such as blinding, randomization, and concealment of allocation is that they reduce the bias associated with evidence generated from clinical trials; trials that pay close attention to these methodological issues provide a more valid estimate of treatment effect.",
