The OA-induced activation of nuclear factor (NF) kB p65 was also reduced by alprostadil. Furthermore, we found that Alprostadil had an inhibitory effect on the phosphorylation of JNK, ERK1/2, and p38 MAPKs. Alprostadil inhibited Bax but increased Bcl-2, indicating a suppressive role in apoptosis. Remarkably increased expression of ACE in the OA model group was observed, which was decreased by alprostadil.",

It is a severe, life-threatening medical condition characterized by acute and widespread inflammation in the lungs [1] , which leads to protein-rich nonhydrostatic pulmonary edema and refractory hypoxemia [2] . It increases lung \"stiffness\" and impairs the ability of the lung to remove carbon dioxide [3] . Many pathogenic conditions can trigger ARDS, such as sepsis and pneumonia [4] . Although the outcome of ARDS has improved with advances in ventilator strategies, mortality is still high. The LUNG SAFE study reports a 40% hospital mortality rate, with a significant increase across the ARDS severity categories, in line with the Berlin definition (34.9% in mild ARDS, 40.3% in moderate ARDS, and 46.1% in severe ARDS) [5] . No specific and effective pharmacological intervention for ARDS is currently available [3] ; therefore, it is critical to develop new clinical drugs for the treatment of ARDS.",

The phosphorylation levels of p38 MAPK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), and Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) are all significantly increased in LPS-induced lung injury [12] . Consequently, inhibition of these proteins efficiently attenuates LPS-induced pulmonary inflammatory response [13, 14] . Additionally, the possible mechanism by which oleic acid (OA) induces acute lung injury (ALI)/ARDS in rats is that OA activates the NF-kB signaling pathway to increase the expressions of many pro-inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-a and IL-1b [15] . Therefore, we hypothesized that alprostadil can protect against OA-induced ARDS by inhibiting the MAPKs and NF-kB pathways.",

For many years, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) has been known as the key enzyme in the regulation of RAS [17] . The pulmonary circulation is an important target for the renin-angiotensin system in the lungs. ACE activity triggers vasoconstriction by generating angiotensin II from angiotensin [18] . Previous reports indicate that the RAS plays a critical role in ARDS [19] . For instance, angiotensin II (Ang II) and AT1 receptor (AT1R) induces pulmonary vasoconstriction, suggesting vital roles of Ang II and AT1R in elevating pulmonary vascular tone and causing pulmonary edema [20] . In addition, accumulating data suggest that Ang II also increases vascular permeability via AT1R [21] . Several mediators have been implicated in Ang II-regulated vascular permeability changes, including the eicosanoids leukotriene C4, prostaglandin E2 and prostaglandin I2, and vascular permeability factor [22] . Therefore, ACE functions as a lung-injury-promoting factor in ALI, which needs to be controlled during the treatment and prevention of ARDS.",

The Bcl-2 family, including an anti-apoptotic gene (Bcl-2) and a pro-apoptotic gene (Bax), is also closely associated with apoptosis [25] . The sensitivity to apoptotic signals mainly depends on the process of competitive dimerization of Bcl-2/Bax in cells. When Bcl-2 is expressed at a high level, Bcl-2/Bcl-2 homodimer and Bcl-2/Bax heterodimer are created and the DNA cleavage activity of endonuclease is inhibited to suppress apoptosis. When Bax is overexpressed, Bax/Bax homodimer is formed to accelerate apoptosis. Finally, it has been demonstrated that the ratio of Bcl-2 to Bax is a crucial index in the process of apoptosis, indicating the severity of apoptosis [26] .

The structure of the alveoli was complete and there was no obvious pathological change in the control group (Figure 2A ). OA challenge caused significant pathological changes, including infiltration of inflammatory cells, aggregation of neutrophils in the alveolus and alveolar fluid, thickening of the alveolar wall, and pulmonary congestion (Figure 2A ). Alprostadil treatment ameliorated the tissue damage in a dose-dependent manner. Importantly, in the OA + Alprostadil (10 \u03bcg/kg) group, the damaged structure of the alveoli was obviously restored compared with that in the OA model group. Moreover, the lung injury scores ( Figure 2B ) of the OA model group were significantly increased as compared with the control group. In contrast, compared with the OA model group, alprostadil significantly decreased the lung injury score. Similar results were obtained by Masson trichrome staining. As shown in Figure 3 , more collagen deposition and higher fibrosis scores were observed in OA model group compared with the control group. Alprostadil treatment reduced collagen deposition and fibrosis scoring in a dose-dependent manner. These data suggest that Alprostadil protects rat from OA-induced lung tissue damage.",

Importantly, alprostadil treatment significantly attenuated OA-induced ARDS symptoms, as well as suppressing the elevation of these ARDS-related proteins and activation of the MAPKs and NF-kB pathways.

The W/D ratio is considered as an indicator of lung edema [44] , and OA has been reported to be able to augment edema formation and cytokine productions in the bronchoalveolar fluids of Swiss Webster mice [45] . TNF-a is known as a pro-inflammatory cytokine and can stimulate the production of other cytokines [46, 47] . Its production has been reported to be significantly increased in ALI/ARDS patients [48, 49] . Masson trichrome staining was performed to observe the collagen formation in bronchial airways. Our results showed typical pathological changes in the lungs of OA-administrated rats, such as marked alveolar fluid, thickening of the alveolar wall and lungs, alveolar wall disruption and leukocyte infiltration, and collagen deposition in the lungs. The expression of TNF-a and IL-1b in the lung tissues were significantly increased, and the W/D ratio was increased in ARDS rats. The OA + Alprostadil group showed clearly reduced lung damage, the W/D ratio of rat lung tissues, and the production of TNF-a and IL-1b, as well as collagen formation, as compared with the OA model group. These data indicate the protective role of alprostadil in ARDS. NF-kB is implicated in the regulation of inflammatory and immune responses, which play an important role in the development of ARDS. MAPKs also have critical roles in the regulation of cell growth, differentiation, and control of cellular responses to cytokines and stress [50] . NF-kB and MAPKs signaling pathways can be activated by OA to regulate the release of proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-a and IL-1b [51]. More recent studies have suggested that alprostadil reduced LPSinduced ALI through down-regulating NF-kB activity and inhibiting expression of harmful inflammatory cytokines [52] . Our results showed that OA administration markedly increased the phosphorylation of NF-kB p65 and MAPKs, including p38 MAPK, ERK1/2, and JNK. However, alprostadil can completely reverse the increased activation of MAPKs and NF-kB signaling pathways induced by OA. Thus, we demonstrated that Alprostadil can protect against OA-induced ARDS through inhibiting the MAPKs and NF-kB signaling pathways.",

            "text": "In addition, recent studies have shown that apoptosis is a crucial mechanism for the development of ARDS [53, 54] . The balance between pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic factors in the lungs may play an important role in determining the fate of the epithelium. The Bcl-2 family, including an anti-apoptotic gene (Bcl-2) and a pro-apoptotic gene (Bax), is also closely associated with apoptosis [25] . The sensitivity to apoptotic signals mainly depends on the process of competitive dimerization of Bcl-2/Bax in cells. When Bcl-2 is expressed at a high level, Bcl-2/Bcl-2 homodimer and Bcl-2/Bax heterodimer are created and the DNA cleavage activity of endonuclease is inhibited to suppress apoptosis. When Bax is overexpressed, Bax/Bax homodimer is formed to accelerate apoptosis. Finally, it has been demonstrated that the ratio of Bcl-2 to Bax is a crucial index in the process of apoptosis, indicating the severity of apoptosis [26] . The effects of alprostadil on the regulation of Bcl-2 and Bax have previously been reported [55] [56] [57] . To confirm these findings, Western blot analysis was used to detect the protein expression levels of Bax and Bcl-2. In our study, significant apoptosis was seen in the OA model group lung tissue, while alprostadil downregulated the protein expression levels of Bax and upregulated the expression levels of Bcl-2 in lung tissue, which caused a decreased rate of lung tissue apoptosis in the OA+Alprostadil group. This supports that alprostadil protects against lung injury in OA-induced ARDS.",

            "text": "In recent decades, RAS has been thought to be essential in maintaining blood pressure homeostasis, as well as fluid and salt balance [16] . The latest evidence suggested that activation of the pulmonary RAS can influence the pathogenesis of ARDS via such mechanisms as inflammation, vascular permeability, vascular tone, and fibroblast activity [58] . ACE is a key member of the classical renin-angiotensin system. The lungs are major organs that express ACE in humans and rats. The importance of RAS in ARDS has been widely emphasized. Idell et al. [58] found that ARDS patients had elevated ACE levels in bronchoalveolar lavage. Orfanos [59] also reported that pulmonary capillary endothelium-bound ACE activity was correlated with the severity of lung injury in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome. In the present study, we used Western blot and immunohistochemistry to examine the expression of ACE, a lung-injury-promoting factor in ALI, in lung tissues to assess the degree of lung injury. We found that OA administration caused a significant increase in the expression of ACE in the lung tissues when compared with the control group, suggesting that ACE and ARDS have a significant correlation. It could be speculated that injection of OA aggravates lung injury, and the unceasingly increased ACE in the lungs would increase the RAS activity in the lungs. ACE may cause pulmonary vasoconstriction and pulmonary arterial pressure upgrading, as well as increasing pneumoangiogram permeability via increased RAS activity. In addition, ACE may promote the infiltration of monocytes/macrophages and promote inflammatory factor secretion, leading to more severe lung injury and the formation of pulmonary hypertension and fibrosis [60] . However, the upregulated ACE expression was significantly reversed by alprostadil treatment. These results suggest that the lung RAS participates in this injury process.",

To determine whether alprostadil affects OA-induced lung tissue apoptosis, we investigated Bcl-2 and Bax expression by Western blot. OA stimulation resulted in an obvious increase of Bax (Figure 6A, 6B) but decrease of Bcl-2 (Figure 6A, 6C) expression in lung tissues. However, 10 \u03bcg/kg alprostadil treatment significantly prevented the increase of Bax expression and the decrease of Bcl-2 expression in lung tissues. Therefore, alprostadil can inhibit apoptosis in lung tissues induced by OA.Alprostadil inhibits the production of ACE in the lung tissue of OA-induced ARDS ratsClinical and experimental studies have shown that lung injury induced by ARDS is associated with abnormal activation of the RAS[38]. Activity of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) is most prominent in pulmonary circulation under physiological (A, B) Effects of alprostadil on collagen production in lung tissues of OA-induced ARDS rats.
