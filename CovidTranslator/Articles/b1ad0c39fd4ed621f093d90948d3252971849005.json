Despite this disease burden, the etiologic causes of ILI are poorly described for many geographical regions. Methods: Beginning in April 2010, we conducted an observational cohort study at five hospitals in Mexico City, enrolling subjects who met the criteria for ILI. Evaluations were conducted at enrollment and on day 28, with the collection of clinical data and a nasopharyngeal swab (or nasal aspirate in children). Swabs were tested by multiplex PCR for 15 viral pathogens and real-time PCR for influenza. Results: During the first year, 1065 subjects were enrolled in this study, 55% of whom were hospitalized; 24% of all subjects were children. One or more pathogens were detected by PCR in 64% of subjects, most commonly rhinovirus (25% of all isolates) and influenza (24% of isolates). Six percent of subjects died, and of those, 54% had no pathogen identified. Rhinovirus was the most common pathogen among those who died, although it did not have the highest case fatality rate. Conclusions: Multiple respiratory viruses beyond influenza are associated with significant morbidity and mortality among adults and children in Mexico City. Detection of these agents could be useful for the adjustment of antibiotic treatment in severe cases. \u00df",

Shlomai et al. compared outcomes of those hospitalized with an ILI, and found mortality of 4.6% in influenza patients vs. 7% in influenza-negative ILI patients. 18 As further demonstration of the burden that non-influenza etiological agents contribute to ILIs, Widmer et al. reported that RSV hospitalization rates exceeded those of influenza (15.01 and 11.81 per 10 000, respectively). 22 It is important to know the characteristics and seasonal behavior of the different types of virus causing ILI. Although current clinical diagnostic tests of all viruses are high in cost, improved diagnosis would allow a more judicious use of empirical wide-spectrum antibiotic treatment, which in many cases could be suspended, and thus reduce the cost of hospitalization.",

Recent studies have reported coronavirus to be the third to fifth most common pathogen. 10, 13 Among children in this study, the most common pathogen was influenza, followed by RSV and rhinovirus. Similar significant contributions of RSV and influenza have been noted in prior studies. [29] [30] [31] Rhinovirus, however, was rarely tested in previous studies. In one other prospective cohort study of children with lower respiratory tract infections, rhinovirus was reported as second only to RSV in causing hospitalizations. 32 The frequency at which it was isolated in our hospitalized children (14%, 17/121) suggests that rhinovirus is a previously under-appreciated pathogen for this age group.",

It is unclear if these subjects had bacterial infections, pathogens not tested for in our assay, or noninfectious etiologies of their ILI. Unfortunately the lack of paired sputum limited our ability to determine etiology. In a cohort in New Caledonia, paired sputum samples were required to determine the etiologic agent in 23% of subjects with lower respiratory tract infections. 32 In a population of hospitalized children in Mexico with lower respiratory tract infections, viral etiologies were determined in only 47%. 34 This study found a virologic agent in 80% of children. This improved detection is likely in part due to the extended panel of viruses that were tested with the multiplex PCR.",

It is not possible to determine the contribution of each virus to the clinical syndrome, nor is it possible to determine if some viruses that were detected were not causing disease. While PCR significantly improves the sensitivity of detecting respiratory viruses, the detection of viral nucleic acids may not always represent causation. In prior case-control studies, virus nucleic acids could be isolated from 20-27% of asymptomatic subjects. 35, 36 This might be supported by the data showing that among those with mixed infections, the outcomes were not significantly worse than those for subjects with single infections. While all subjects enrolled were symptomatic, and this would increase the likelihood that isolated pathogens were causative, cohort studies such as ours are not able to directly determine causation. With 62 unique combinations in 125 different subjects, the assessment of outcomes lacks statistical power to determine differences between the various combinations of mixed infections. The determination of non-influenza respiratory viruses in ILI has several implications. First, increasing knowledge that acute respiratory illness and its associated morbidity are often caused by respiratory viruses may stimulate the development of more affordable rapid diagnostic tests as well as therapeutics for these viruses. With the consideration of increasing antibiotic resistance, the diagnosis of respiratory viruses could decrease the quantities of empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics used.",
