The clinical features are essentially the same as for any respiratory viral infections or pneumonitis. Towards the end of the 2003 epidemics, SARScornoavirus was identified to be the culprit. Subsequently, it was realised that the clinical features of many patients with laboratory SARS were neither 'severe' nor 'respiratory' in nature. Nevertheless, imprecise definition carries serious public health implications that patients may be erroneously quarantined and cities stigmatised.",

The Health Protection Agency (HPA) has confirmed the presence of a novel coronavirus (human betacoronavirus 2C). WHO coined the interim case definition of \"severe respiratory disease associated with novel coronavirus\" on September 25, which was revised on September 29 to Severe Acute Respiratory Infections associated with novel coronavirus infection (SARI associated with nCoV). It is interesting to note that the definition of SARS for surveillance is not used despite that symptoms and viral aetiology all fulfilled the SARS definition. The Department of Health in Hong Kong now includes \"Severe Respiratory Disease associated with Novel Coronavirus\" as a statutorily notifiable disease. The virus was termed the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus. (MERS-CoV) by some investigators. From September 2012 to date, WHO has been informed of a global total of 41 laboratoryconfirmed cases of infection with the nCoV, including 20 deaths. Several countries in the Middle East have been affected, including Jordan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Cases have also been reported in France, Germany, and the United Kingdom. All of the European cases have had a direct or indirect connection to the Middle East, including two cases with recent travel history from the UAE. In France and the United Kingdom, there has been limited local transmission among close contacts who had not been to the Middle East but had been in contact with a traveller who recently returned from the Middle East (http://www.who.int/csr/don/2013_05_18_ncov/en/index. html). In recent months, WHO appears to move away from coining confusing new \"syndromes\" and encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for Severe Acute Respiratory Infections (SARI) related to the novel coronavirus. In addition, WHO recommends any clusters of SARI or SARI in health care workers should be thoroughly investigated regardless of where in the world they occur. The term SARS is now only reserved for the 2013 SARS coronavirus associated disease.",

Should there be another outbreak of a presumed viral pneumonitis in future, health organisations might run out of terminology to describe the same respiratory syndrome by another pathogen. It is high time we finalise a time-proof definition for epidemic viral pneumonitis [3, 6] . Based on our 2003 definitions [3] , we now propose the term epidemic pneumonia (EP) and the following surveillance classification to replace all these existing and prospective confusing respiratory terminology in an ever changing world of epidemics of novel In 2013, an 11-year-old girl presented to a Hong Kong PICU with sars, ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome), right-sided pneumonia and pleural effusion. Streptococcus pneumoniae was not isolated in this girl with \"typical\" pneumonia by symptomatology and chest radiography, but nasopharyngeal aspirate yielded mycoplasma pneumoniae instead. A few months later, a 2-year-old girl was taken to the same PICU following extensive investigations in Xiamen, China for extreme failure-to-thrive and pneumonia but no definitive diagnosis arrived. She was confirmed with HIV infection the next day in Hong Kong. Nasopharyngeal aspirate also yielded CMV by PCR. There was no outbreak of any novel respiratory infection during this period in Hong Kong or Xiamen despite SARI-nCoV in middle east and avian influenza in Mainland China. The patient with mycoplasma pneumonia can be classified as EP [C-, mycoplasma pneumoniae\u00fe] and the child with HIV as EP [C-, HIV and CMV and presumed PCP]. In fact, EP can be excluded based on no travel or contact history and CoV isolation.",
