Records of attempts to control zoonoses are almost as old. The early focus on food-borne illness evolved into veterinary medicine's support of public health efforts. Key historical events, disease outbreaks, and individuals responsible for their control are reviewed and serve as a foundation for understanding the current and future efforts in veterinary public health. Animal medicine and veterinary public health have been intertwined since humans first began ministrations to their families and animals. In the United States, the veterinary medical profession has effectively eliminated those major problems of animal health that had serious public health ramifications. These lessons and experiences can serve as a model for other countries. Our past must also be a reminder that the battle for human and animal health is ongoing. New agents emerge to threaten human and animal populations. With knowledge of the past, coupled with new technologies and techniques, we must be vigilant and carry on. #",

In the next century, De Soto, the Spanish explorer of Florida and the Southeast, brought cattle, horses, and swine, as well as dogs that thrived. Farther north, the Virginia colonists brought animals to Roanoke Island, but none survived, neither humans nor animals. Later the Jamestown colonists imported domestic animals that survived and became valuable foundation stock, but no zoonotic diseases are recorded in any of these earliest settlements. Not until 1753 was rabies the first zoonosis recorded in the US colonies, and later as an epizootic in both the colonies and the Federation of States in the late 18th century (Smithcors, 1975a,b) .",

Yellow fever epidemics were frightening as they spread up the Mississippi River from New Orleans. The possibility that yellow fever involved animals brought Professor John Gamgee, a famous veterinarian, from England to investigate the epidemic. He recognized the seasonal occurrencethat cold weather stopped the epidemic -and even suggested river traffic be limited to the colder months. However, he failed to associate the effect of cold weather with the decline of the numbers of mosquito populations, the vector of yellow fever (Furman, 1973) .",

As director of the Pennsylvania Livestock Sanitary Board Laboratory, he published on glanders, anthrax, anaplasmosis, sporotrichosis, paratuberculosis, septicemia, and many other diseases of animals. In 1914 he left the University of Pennsylvania to accept a position at the University of California's newly established Tropical Medical Center. The following year, he accepted an appointment to the George Williams Hooper Foundation for Medical Research at the University of California Medical Center. He remained there the rest of his life and become a legend. His lectures introduced medical students to the biologically active world, including the zoonoses, plant life, the atmosphere and all that is called the environment today. At The Hooper Foundation, Meyer researched a wide spectrum of animal diseases of public health importance. After being active in the investigation of human influenza in 1918-1920, he went to the field to define the epidemiology of malaria, dysentery, and even dental diseases. His study of the bacterial causes of abortion in animals resulted in bringing together Brucella abortus, Brucella melitensis, and Brucella suis in a new genus honoring David Bruce. Another important event was his report on Clostridium botulinum in nature. Botulism became a national concern in the 1920s when California canned fruit and vegetables were found to contain botulinum toxin. The industry asked Meyer to resolve the problems and underwrote a laboratory to maintain surveillance.",

The 1930s were memorable for public health growth and scientific advances. The viral etiology of influenza was uncovered by Richard Shope and Thomas Francis at the Rockefeller Institute. The use of egg embryos was a new method of growing viruses that would lead to the chick-embryo rabies vaccine and other viral vaccines. The development of the Strain 19 Brucella vaccine and the Stern anthrax vaccine in South Africa were important to the control of brucellosis and anthrax worldwide. Earlier investigation of toxoids by Gaston Ramon, a French military veterinarian, led to the discovery of tetanus toxoid for both horses and humans.

In 1938 Michigan State College experienced an epidemic among veterinary students and others in the bacteriology building (Holland, 1940) . Up to then the disease was thought to be caused by direct exposure or ingestion of milk borne Brucella, and airborne Brucella was not given much consideration. The episode at Michigan State College would change that oversight. As a student in the brucellosis testing laboratory, I heard discussion of the means of spread being water borne and back siphonage. Professor I.F. Huddleson, whose research laboratory was the focus of this investigation, disagreed with the state investigators, who were public health scientists and engineers focusing on the water borne theory. These investigators suggested contaminated glassware was not being autoclaved properly, and in turn, viable Brucella was getting into the water system (Newitt et al., 1939) .",

Vaccinia were grown on the belly of a calf that had been shaved, scrubbed and disinfected. After harvesting the scabs, the vaccinia would be tested for contaminants. It was a lengthy procedure.

The incidence of human rabies was the highest ever recorded, and unfortunately, human vaccine therapy was not always effective. Canine rabies vaccine protection was short, with the vaccines being given every 6 months. Therefore, rabies became the lead program of the Veterinary Public Health Division. To head the activity, Dr. Ernest Tierkel, a University of Pennsylvania graduate who had completed his MPH at Columbia School of Public Health in 1947, was recruited. He, Dr. Robert Kissling and Martha Eidson along with a staff of animal handlers became the nucleus of the national rabies program at the Rockefeller Rabies Investigation Center in Montgomery Alabama (Steele and Tierkel, 1949) . The center was transferred to the CDC for $1.00. They successfully demonstrated the effectiveness of a new chicken embryo rabies vaccine in the laboratory (Tierkel et al., 1953) and in epidemic situations in Memphis, Tennessee (Tierkel et al., 1950) .",

They went so far as to say that as the sanitariums lost tuberculosis patients, brucellosis patients would take their place. The Indiana Health Department was to be a brucellosis project site under Dr. Sam Damen, the Director of Laboratories. The goal was to determine what action the health agencies should take. The Federal Bovine Brucellosis Control Program was active in all states, so it became apparent that if the health authorities gave their support, the Federal State Brucella Control Program could eliminate the animal source of the human disease. Late we brought the problem to the attention of Dr. Herman Bunderson, Chicago's dynamic health officer who remembered the struggle to eradicate bovine tuberculosis in the Chicago milk shed, which included dairy herds in six midwestern states. In 1928, he had required all milk coming into Chicago to be from TB-free herds regardless of whether the milk was to be pasteurized. He recognized the Brucella problem and shortly thereafter instituted the same standards for the elimination of bovine brucellosis in the 1950s.",

As a result of these efforts, human brucellosis declined rapidly in the midwest from a high of thousands of human infections to hundreds in less than a decade.

The Zimmerman Human Tissue survey 1966-1970 revealed the lowest rate of Trichinosis ever (Zimmerman et al., 1973) . Modern pig raising, the prohibition of garbage feeding of swine, and consumer education are all contributing factors in the decline of the disease in pigs and humans (Steele, 1982) .

After the war, investigators demonstrated it was widely disseminated. Dr. Phil Edwards led the way at the University of Kentucky and later at the CDC. Mildred Galton, Chief of the Veterinary Public Health Laboratory contributed with her unusual ability to find evidence that others had overlooked. She demonstrated Salmonella in many animals. Her studies of transported pigs revealed how stress caused latently infected pigs to become shedders. The same reaction was found in other species. Her work on raw eggs and meats led to the pasteurization of egg slurry used in baked or cooked products. She was among the first to find Salmonella in raw milk 50 years ago, and her work on the frequent presence of Salmonella in poultry led to the Federal Poultry Inspection Program in the late 1950s (Steele and Galton, 1967) . Thirty years before Weil described leptospirosis in humans in 1880, animal leptospirosis was identified as its own problem. A record of an 1898 canine epidemic in Stuttgart, Germany, exists, but the etiologic agents were not determined. 30 years after the canine epidemic, it was discovered that microorganisms morphologically identical caused the disease in both dogs and humans. Leptospirosis proved confusing to all health professionals partly because ''isolated serovars were given names denoting the clinical signs observed in the patients from whom they were isolated'' (Torten, 1979) . Therefore, it was thought that serovar grippotyphosa would cause signs similar to catarrhal fever, and serovar icterohemorrhagia would cause hemorrhagic jaundice. It was not recognized that both serotypes are capable of causing both signs (Torten, 1979) . In the US, there were numerous outbreaks among animal handlers, veterinarians and swimmers as well as people whose occupation exposed them to contaminated waste water in the 1950-1970 period. Leptospirosis is now recognized as a problem associated with disasters such as flooding and earthquakes. There is wide agreement that vaccination of cattle and dogs has reduced environmental contamination (Stoenner et al., 1956) . Galton (1966) edited the ''Leptospiral serotype distribution list '' through 1966, and Sulzer (1975) carried it up to 1973. They were truly dedicated in keeping these records.",

Oscar Sussman went to Arizona, and later the New Jersey Health Department recruited him, where he built an outstanding program. Martin Baum served Colorado for many years after leaving the CDC. John Mason served in New Mexico. Art Wolff did excellent service in Michigan before returning to Washington, where he became a leader at the USPHS in environmental health as a radiation authority and Assistant Surgeon General. Herbert Stoenner went to Utah and Raymond Fagan to Indiana as described earlier. Monroe Holmes followed Stoenner to Utah, and John Scrugs went to Indiana when Fagan went to the Harvard School of Public Health. John Winn, Francis Abimanti, Don Mason, and Lauri Luoto were among the early investigators of Q fever in California. Stoenner, in addition to his investigation of brucellosis and leptospirosis, was also a leader in Q Fever studies. Don Mason, John Richardson, and Paul Arnstein worked on the control of psittacosis in K.F. Meyer's laboratory at UCSF. Dick Parke, Joe Held and Robert Huffaker kept the CDC office responsive to many inquires and provided service to the states. James Glosser closed his career at the CDC in 1971. His work coordinating the Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis epizootic and epidemic with the U.S. Department of Agriculture Veterinary Services earned him the United States Department of Agriculture's outstanding service award.

These problems affect society in the United States, but it is apparent that we have an obligation to share our knowledge with our neighbors of the Americas as well as Africa and Asia. All of these countries face the same problems the United States, solved in the past century. Now as we move into the 21st century, the technology for controlling these diseases is available. These proven effective procedures in the United States can be used worldwide. Some challenges exist, however, for methods that control bovine tuberculosis. There is a continuous demand for vaccines to prevent tuberculosis in animals, but there is little evidence there is any value in routine vaccination. These procedures are quite costly, and the best examples are in Europe in the past 50 years. After World War II, tuberculosis was a major problem in central Europe especially in Germany, eastern Europe, what is now Russia, and western Europe. There has been an uncalled-for degree of confidence in the tuberculosis vaccine, BCG, but with constant pressure from the World Health Organization, the World Animal Health Organization (OIE), the Food and Agricultural Organization and United States agencies and consultants, the use of vaccines has been put aside. The old test and removal strategies have proven to be the most successful. To introduce that method into Mexico, Central America, South America and Asia is difficult at this time because they are hopeful that a good vaccine will be developed. Unfortunately we have lived with that hope for 100 years. The major problem that remains is to compensate farmers for diseased animals that are removed. The neighboring countries of Mexico, Central America and South America have the opportunity to further their own disease control by employing the proven techniques used in the United States, Canada and Europe.",

            "text": "The number of emerging diseases increased in the latter part of the 20th century. Infectious disease scientists have found that Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) is a disease that makes people more susceptible to zoonotic diseases, including bovine tuberculosis and related mycobacterial infections, toxoplasmosis, cryptosporidiosis, food borne Salmonella and enteric infections including Campylobacter, Listeria and Yersinia. It is possible that other zoonotic diseases that are dormant or infrequent may emerge in individuals with AIDS, Human Immunodeficiency Virus infection, or other immune-compromised conditions. Related latent or nonpathogenic viral diseases have been described in tropical cats of Africa including lions as well as domesticated cats. In Australia and Malaysia new diseases which also affect humans have been reported in horses and swine. These diseases are caused by the morbilliviruses, a measles-like virus that causes canine distemper and rinderpest. Another virus that killed the wild felids in the Cairo Zoo has not been identified. Could this be another form of distemper? Some of the emerging viral diseases that have a rodent or unknown animal host have caused fatal, devastating diseases in humans in Africa and South America, namely Lassa Fever and South American Hemorrhagic diseases in Argentina and Bolivia. In Africa, Ebola Virus hemorrhagic fever and Marburg hemorrhagic fever virus infection, linked to monkey disease, caused disease in medical personnel, handlers and people who had only casual exposure. An incident that surprised us many years ago was the deaths of workers in Middle East abattoirs caused by Crimean Hemorrhagic Fever carried by ectoparasites. One example of developing, emerging, or relatively unknown diseases is Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), a disease that erupted a few years ago in China and was carried to many parts of the world. Recently information has suggested that bats are a natural reservoir of a SARS like coronavirus. Even though SARS may have been an occasional emerging disease that disappeared as rapidly as it appeared, there may have been other infections from bats that have been around the world for millenia.",

Apparently, birds are the reservoir based on the information we have gathered showing that wild birds transmitted the virus to avian domestic flocks. All this new information is challenging. The emerging diseases of the world are reasonably covered in the table of the last chapter of Merck Veterinary Manual's ninth edition Zoonosis Section, 2005.",

Transmissible diseases are not the same as infectious diseases which are characterized by replication of DNA or RNA. This is certainly a bewildering situation especially when we read that saliva may be a means of transfer. Immediately veterinarians think of rabies which is transmitted by saliva. Is it possible the prion of the diseased brain can be secreted through nerve fibers that innervate the salivary gland? The prions are of great and continuing concern as a cause of concern as new types of diseases. Our associates in chemistry, physics, and physiology may offer clues to other neurological diseases.",

We are aware of the collapse of earlier civilizations that have overpopulated their given area or were destroyed by natural events such as starvation. So I say all veterinarians, especially those in public health, have a responsibility in developing humane regulations for animal population control and public guidance.",

It is important that veterinarians have a broad, basic knowledge of public health issues and are alert for new public health issues that can be resolved with tender loving care, new antibiotics, and new procedures. The 76,000 or more veterinarians in the AVMA in the United States are key to the control of zoonotic diseases by public health agencies. The health of our animal population is tied to the emotional and mental well being of those humans who are close to animals in their lives. Animals are vital companions to those homebound, and animal health becomes a family concern.",

At the AVMA meeting in July 2000, the speaker US Senator Hatch of Utah spoke highly of the public health activities of veterinary medicine. He went on to say that there may be a NIH Veterinary Institute in the future. It behooves us all that the agricultural interest in public health be recognized as an important issue to the American public. I think highly of the importance of animal health in providing good public health. Public health should not be guided by economic interest but by the welfare of all society. I go back to my earlier statement that animal health and public health are of great importance to all, and we must have good animal health to have good public health. Good public health provides a means for good animal health.",
