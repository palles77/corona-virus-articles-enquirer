The new teicoplanin pseudoaglycon-derived lipoglycopeptides were prepared by coupling one or two side chains to the N-terminus of the glycopeptide core, using various conjugation methods. Three series of derivatives bearing two lipophilic groups were synthesized by attaching bis-alkylthio maleimides directly or through linkers of different lengths to the glycopeptide. Access to the fourth and fifth series of compounds was achieved by click chemistry, introducing single alkyl/aryl chains directly or through a tetraethylene glycol linker to the same position. A sixth group of semisynthetic derivatives was obtained by sulfonylation of the N-terminus. Of the 42 lipophilic teicoplanin pseudoaglycon derivatives tested, about half showed broad activity against influenza A and B viruses, with some of them having reasonable or no cytotoxicity. Minor differences in the side chain length as well as lipophilicity appeared to have significant impact on antiviral activity and cytotoxicity. Several lipoglycopeptides were also found to be active against human coronavirus.",

The viral envelope contains two glycoproteins with a crucial role in virus replication. The hemagglutinin (HA) is responsible for initial attachment of the virus to sialylated cell surface glycans, and fusion of the viral and endosomal membranes after endocytosis of the virus particle [2] . The influenza virus neuraminidase (NA) catalyzes release of newly formed virions at the end of the viral life cycle. Currently available influenza virus blockers are the NA inhibitors oseltamivir and zanamivir, and the M2 ion channel blockers amantadine and rimantadine [3] . The latter two are rarely used nowadays because of global viral resistance against them [4] . The increasing awareness of potential oseltamivir resistance [5, 6] advocates the need for new antiinfluenza medications. Clinical trials are ongoing for a few HAtargeting approaches, i.e. the fusion inhibitor arbidol and diverse broadly neutralizing anti-HA antibodies [3] . In addition, the possibility to target a host factor involved in HA functioning is tested with the HA maturation inhibitor nitazoxanide and a receptordestroying sialidase enzyme, besides various concepts in the preclinical stage [7] . Antiviral drugs are also required for pandemic preparedness against zoonotic and highly virulent influenza viruses [8] . In this context, antiviral glycopeptide analogues seem particularly Abbreviations: DCM, dichloromethane; DMF, dimethylformamide; CPE, cytopathic effect; Et 3 N, triethylamine; Galp, galactopyranose; HA, hemagglutinin; HIV, human immunodeficiency virus; logP, logarithm of the partition coefficient; MCC, minimum cytotoxic concentration; MDCK, Madin\u00c0Darby Canine Kidney; M2, Matrix-2;",

Derivatives of teicoplanin or related antibiotics were reported to inhibit, among others, influenza virus [9] ; coronaviruses [10] including SARS-CoV (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus) [11] ; Ebola pseudovirus [12] ; HIV [13] ; or hepatitis C virus [14] . Our focus of the last years was to investigate the structure-activity relationship and mechanism of action for influenza virus. We reported lipophilic derivatives of ristocetin aglycon modified on the N-terminal part of the molecule, which proved to be strong inhibitors of influenza virus replication in cell culture [15] . Mechanistic studies with the lead compound demonstrated that it interferes with influenza virus endocytosis [16] . Its favorable selectivity index encouraged us to prepare a series of analogues to gain further insight into structure activity relationships [17, 18] . The outstanding antiviral properties were lost in analogues containing teicoplanin aglycon or pseudoaglycon, meaning that minor structural differences between the aglycon of teicoplanin and that of ristocetin, have major impact on antiviral activity [19] .",

Although compounds 2a and 2d possessing single, relatively long alkyl chains were highly active against influenza virus, they also displayed considerable cytotoxicity [21] . (For the sake of clarity, these compounds are listed as a separate series, i.e. Series 4 in Table 1 . The structures can be found in Fig. 1.) We speculated that this high cytotoxicity might be related to a combination of two factors, the first being high lipophilicity of the side chains in contrast to the hydrophilic pseudoaglycon part, which may cause a membrane-disrupting effect. This might be enhanced by the simple structure of the alkyl chains, which could facilitate insertion of these molecules into biological membranes. In our previous work [21] we attached two very bulky substituents (a perbenzylated disaccharide and a calix [4] arene carrying tert-butylsubstituents) to the same pseudoaglycon (2i and 2j). Calculated logP values for these compounds indicated higher lipophilicity than e.g. the n-hexadecyl or n-octyl derivatives 2a and 2d. These derivatives did not produce profound cytotoxic effect, supporting our hypothesis that cytotoxicity is determined by the combination of the lipophilicity and bulkiness of the substituents. It needs to be mentioned here, that in the A2 components of teicoplanin the \u00df-Dglucosamine on the D-ring is N-acylated by similarly simple acyl chains, yet these compounds seem to be harmless to mammalian cells. Therefore, the overall lipophilicity of the molecules may also influence cytotoxicity.",
