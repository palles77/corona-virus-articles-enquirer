Cough begins with stimulation of cough receptors, located in the upper and lower airways, and in many other sites such as the ear canal, tympanic membrane, sinuses, nose, pericardium, pleura, and diaphragm. Receptors send messages via vagal, phrenic, glossopharyngeal, or trigeminal nerves to the \"cough center,\" which is in the medulla. Because cough is not only an involuntary reflex activity but also one that can be initiated or suppressed voluntarily, \"higher centers\" must also be involved in the afferent limb of the responsible pathway. The neural impulses go from the medulla to the appropriate efferent pathways to the larynx, tracheobronchial tree, and expiratory muscles.",

These pressures may be transmitted to vascular, cerebrospinal, and intraocular spaces. Finally, the glottis opens, allowing for explosive expiratory airflow (300 m/sec) and expulsion of mucus, particularly from the larger, central airways. The inability to seal the upper airway (tracheostomy) impairs, but does not abolish, the effectiveness of cough. Weak ventilatory muscles (muscular dystrophy) impair both the inspiratory and the compressive phase.",

Fluid in larger airways causes crackles early in inspiration (congestive heart failure). Crackles that tend to be a bit lower in pitch (\"coarse\" crackles) than the early, higher-pitched (\"fine\") crackles are associated with fluid in small airways (pneumonia). Although crackles usually signal the presence of excess airway fluid (pneumonia, pulmonary edema), they may also be produced by the popping open of noninfected fibrotic or atelectatic airways. Fine crackles are not audible at the mouth, whereas coarse crackles may be. Crackles is the preferred term, rather than the previously popular \"rales.\" \u2022 Rhonchi, or \"large airway sounds,\" are continuous gurgling or bubbling sounds typically heard during both inhalation and exhalation.

The mechanism by which URIs cause cough in children is undetermined. In adults, it is generally thought that \"postnasal drip\"-that is, nasal or sinus secretions draining into the posterior nasopharynx-causes cough and, in fact, may be one of the most frequent causes of cough. Indeed, sinus CT in older patients with URIs often reveals unexpected involvement of the sinus mucosa. Other authorities believe that cough in a child with a URI indicates involvement (inflammation or bronchospasm) of the lower respiratory tract. Over-the-counter cough and cold medications are commonly used. Evidence of efficacy of these medications for children with URI is lacking. Because of the known risk for unintentional overdose from these medications, their use is not recommended in children under age 4 years. 35,000 with 85% lymphocytes strongly suggests pertussis, but not every child with pertussis presents such a clear hematologic picture.

A positive culture provides definitive diagnosis, but a negative culture specimen is not helpful. Throat cultures are seldom helpful (except in CF) in identifying lower respiratory tract bacterial organisms.

Apnea is a common complication of RSV bronchiolitis in neonates and may necessitate close monitoring. In severe cases, often those in which there is underlying chronic heart, lung, or immunodeficiency disease, RSV can be life-threatening. In severe cases, hospital care with supplemental oxygen and intravenous fluids is indicated. Suctioning of secretions is an essential part of the treatment. Many other treatment modalities have been tried for hospitalized infants with bronchiolitis. Aerosolized bronchodilators and systemic glucocorticoids do not seem to alter clinical outcome and are not recommended in most patients. Nebulized saline may reduce the length of hospitalization.

Mycoplasma pneumoniae is a common cause of pneumonia among school-aged children. The disease often occurs in community outbreaks in the fall. The illness typically begins with extrapulmonary symptoms (i.e., sore throat, myalgias, headache, fever), which then progress to include cough, which can be paroxysmal at times. Patients do not often appear acutely ill, but cough may persist for weeks. There may be no specific abnormalities on the chest examination, although a few crackles may be heard, and about one third of younger patients wheeze.

The sweat test, if not performed correctly in a laboratory with extensive experience with the technique (as, for example, in an accredited CF center), yields many false-positive and false-negative results. The proper technique is to use quantitative analysis of the concentration of chloride in the sweat produced after pilocarpine iontophoretic stimulation. Chloride concentrations higher than 60 mmol/L are considered positive, and those lower than 40 mmol/L are negative (normal). Healthy adults have slightly higher sweat chloride concentrations than do children, but the same guidelines hold for positive tests in adults. The non-CF conditions yielding elevated sweat chloride concentrations are listed in Table 2 .18. False-negative results of sweat tests can be seen in CF children presenting with edema or hypoproteinemia and in samples from children with an inadequate sweat rate. Sweat testing can be performed at any age. Newborns within the first few weeks of life may not produce a large enough volume of sweat to analyze (75 mg minimum), but in those who do (the majority), the results are accurate. Indications for sweat testing are noted in Table 2 .19. In patients for whom sweat testing is difficult (e.g., because of distance from an experienced laboratory, small infants who have not produced enough sweat, patients with extreme dermatitis, or patients with intermediate-range sweat chloride concentrations), DNA mutation testing can be useful. Demonstration of two known CF mutations confirms the diagnosis. Finding one or no known mutation makes the diagnosis less likely but is not exclusive, inasmuch as there are patients All 50 states are using a neonatal screen for CF. The CF screen assays include measuring serum immunoreactive trypsinogen (IRT) levels, which are elevated in most infants with CF for the first several weeks of life, and DNA analysis for CFTR mutations. The main drawback of the IRT assay is that it has relatively poor specificity; as many as 90% of the positive results on the initial screen are false-positive results. If an infant's IRT screen is positive, the test should be repeated, or DNA analysis for the 23 most common CFTR mutations should be performed. At 2-3 weeks of age, which is when the IRT is repeated, the false-positive rate has fallen dramatically but is still quite high (25%). Definitive testing with the sweat chloride test needs to be carried out on infants with positive screening results.",

Clues to the diagnosis of pulmonary embolus include a positive family history, severe dyspnea, chest pain, hypoxia, a normal chest radiograph, an accentuated second Bronchiectasis. Bronchiectasis is defined as an abnormal dilation of the subsegmental bronchi and is usually associated with chronic cough and purulent sputum production. It occasionally occurs after severe pneumonias (bacterial or viral); it eventually develops in nearly all patients with CF. Diagnosis may, on occasion, be made with plainchest radiographs, but high-resolution CT scanning is the diagnostic procedure of choice. Treatment of bronchiectasis consists of airway clearance with chest physiotherapy with postural drainage or highfrequency chest wall oscillation, occasionally bronchodilators and mucolytic agents, and antibiotic therapy during exacerbations. Surgical resection may be indicated in cases that are progressive and localized when medical therapy has failed. The prognosis of bronchiectasis depends on the underlying cause. CF-associated bronchiectasis is a major cause of CF-related morbidity and mortality; whereas, non-CF bronchiectasis may remain stable or even regress with therapy.",

Because hemoptysis is seldom fatal in children, reassurance is usually warranted. Furthermore, hemoptysis most often resolves, and treatment of the bleeding itself is not often needed. What is required is treatment of the underlying cause of the hemoptysis, such as therapy for infection, removal of a foreign body, or control of collagen vascular disease. When death occurs from hemoptysis, it is more likely to be from suffocation than from exsanguination. In cases of massive bleeding, the rigid open-tube bronchoscope may help suction large amounts of blood while ventilating and keeping unaffected portions of lung clear of blood. Interventional radiologists treat as well as localize a bleeding site by injecting the offending vessel with occlusive substances (embolization). In extremely rare instances, emergency lobectomy may be indicated. heart sound, an abnormal compression ultrasonographic study of the leg veins, a positive Homans sign, a positive helical CT scan, and a high-probability lung ventilation-perfusion scan. The diagnosis of several causes of hemoptysis is straightforward. For example, hemoptysis that occurs immediately after a surgical or invasive diagnostic procedure in the chest should suggest an iatrogenic problem. The chest radiograph can help suggest lung abscess, pulmonary sequestration, bronchogenic cyst, or tumor. Chest CT can help with cases of arteriovenous malformations, and additional laboratory values can support the diagnosis of collagen vascular disease. cough that may produce significant complications (see Table 2 .9). For most diseases, suppressing the cough offers no advantage. Disadvantages include narcotic addiction and loss of the protective cough reflex with subsequent mucous retention and possible superinfection.
