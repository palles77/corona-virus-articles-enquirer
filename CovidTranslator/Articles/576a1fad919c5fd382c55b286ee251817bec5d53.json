Telemedicine has emerged as a critical technology to bring medical care to patients while attempting to reduce the transmission of COVID-19 among patients, families, and clinicians. It is also increasingly necessary to preserve scarce resources like personal protective equipment. In this article, we share just-in-time tips to support palliative care clinicians and program leaders in providing the best care possible by telemedicine. These quick, practical tips cover telemedicine set-up, patient considerations, and clinician considerations. Next steps include ensuring equitable access to affordable telemedicine technology for vulnerable populations through creative solutions and financing, and dedicated attention to telemedicine evaluation and quality improvement.",

For example, the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) has mandated telemedicine be used to care for palliative care and non-palliative care patients whenever possible in ambulatory settings. Similarly, many hospice agencies are currently offering most, if not all, social work and chaplaincy support by telemedicine. For hospitals, strict limitations on visitors has meant that some inpatient palliative care consult programs are performing family meetings and consults virtually. To support these changes, many telemedicine regulatory measures are being relaxed. As of this month in the United States, patients can receive telemedicine across state lines, Medicare will reimburse for telemedicine visits, and the Drug Enforcement Administration will allow prescription of controlled substances by telemedicine without a prior in-person evaluation (2).",

Ensure the \"technological liaison\" is available during the scheduled visit to troubleshoot technological glitches in real-time. \u2022 For programs that have a patient portal as part of the electronic medical record, a \"dot phrase\" that includes instructions for patients/families on how to download the telemedicine platform and prepare for the visit can be helpful.

Have a contingency plan if the meeting does not start at the scheduled time. Consider instructing the patient to call the palliative care program if a clinician is more than 15 minutes late for a telemedicine visit. This information can be included on the introductory patient portal message and reinforced by appointment schedulers. \u2022 Despite best efforts, some patients may not be able to join by telemedicine due to lack of access to technology/internet, insufficient social support, or connectivity problems on the day of the visit. In these circumstances, telephone may be an alternative, with some insurance plans reimbursing for telephone visits. \u2022 Consider reasons a patient needs to be seen in-person rather than by video. Examples include: a patient's change in condition, need to complete a cardiac or lung exam, or the inability to offer an interpreter over video.",

While this can increase efficiency, creating space for patients and families to share their thoughts and feelings is arguably even more important than it was before the COVID-19 pandemic.

How are your spirits?\" can be effective. \u2022 A recent satisfaction survey we conducted at UCSF of 35 palliative care patients and 15",

Previously, many commercial insurance plans were already reimbursing for telemedicine. Billing clinicians should document telemedicine visits as they would an in-person encounter, remembering to include only the physical exam that is possible by telemedicine. Bill using the same clinic (or inpatient) CPT codes used for an in-person visit and select Place of Service \"02\" to specify the service has been provided by telemedicine (4). \u2022 Finally, it is important to be patient.

Care of people with serious illness and their families now requires impeccable social distancing for their protection and for all healthcare professionals so critically needed in response to COVID-19. Preparation, patience, and practice will help ensure effective implementation of telemedicine. The quick tips offered above are an excellent starting point, but additional support and innovation can help eliminate barriers and stimulate rapid mastery. First, we must find creative ways to ensure that all patients have equitable access to this valuable resource. We must reach individuals with poor social networks, poor technological literacy, and who lack access to technology. Soliciting the help of volunteers, philanthropy, and tech companies who can create plug-and-play telemedicine devices at low-cost can help shore up potential gaps in access. Second, reimbursement for telephone visits, particularly to those in whom video visits are not possible, will incentivize the use of this important modality when it is needed. Third, we must capitalize on this unprecedented time in which telemedicine will become a critical part of healthcare delivery to study processes and outcomes through programmatic evaluation and research to guide best practices in the future.",
