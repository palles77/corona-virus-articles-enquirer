These differences can result in under or over-dosing of the aminoglycosides (kanamycin/ KM) and polypeptides (capreomycin/CM), which may affect efficacy, or result in toxicity. To achieve this ideal concentration, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of KM/CM could be considered in reducing toxic effects, (ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity) and improving treatment outcomes. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of KM/ CM in patients with DR-TB and the relationship with hearing.",
