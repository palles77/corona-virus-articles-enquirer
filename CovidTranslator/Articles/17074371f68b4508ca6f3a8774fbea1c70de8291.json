Lei Pan et al 10 demonstrated that 48.5% of the patients presented with GI symptoms, including anorexia (83.8%), diarrhea (29.3%), and vomiting (0.8%), with the severity increasing as the disease progressed. With the detection of the virus in the feces, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has suggested the use of separate bathrooms in cases of suspected COVID- 19. 11 In line with these recommendations, extensive precautions need to be adopted to avoid potential oral-fecal transmission.",
