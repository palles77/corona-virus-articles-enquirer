The occurrence of SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) in 2003 provides a rare opportunity to understand the social functioning of a community during the outbreak of an epidemic. To evaluate the extensive social impact of such an outbreak, we focus on the effects of perceived collective efficacy. Specifically, we focus on how the collective efficacy of a community, measured by trust and reciprocal relations, is related to collective action in places where SARS occurred and those where SARS did not occur. The study is based on a unique data set, the 2003 Taiwan Social Image Survey, collected during the outbreak of SARS in Taiwan. Our findings show that community collective efficacy, measured by trust and reciprocity, is not associated with community collective action when an outbreak of an epidemic occurs.",

There have been world famous epidemics, such as the bubonic plague, usually known as the Black Death, which killed 1.5 of 4 million people in Europe in the Middle Ages. Similarly, the Great Influenza Pandemic, commonly called the Spanish Flu, occurred at the end of World War I and cost 20-40 million lives. Although we know that these epidemics disrupted social life during the outbreak and aftermath, we are not able to study the effects systematically as there are limited data still available.",

A community with higher collective efficacy brings people in the community together, and reflects the core and classic argument about community, that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.

We develop a few hypotheses and test them against survey data collected during the 2003 SARS outbreak in Taiwan. The discussion is supplemented by qualitative information to provide a contextual understanding of the situation. In the final section, we discuss the implications of the findings for the social impact of the outbreak, and the ways in which collective efficacy, measured by trust and a sense of reciprocity, is related to the perception of collective community action. In this study, the proxy for community is the city or town where respondents reside. Through the discussion and findings, we demonstrate the importance of disentangling the relationship of perceived collective efficacy, measured by trust and reciprocity, during the epidemic outbreak.",

Trust has been a major topic among social scientists, all of whom give the concept different emphases. In this study, we interpret trust as ''rational expectations of the behavior of the trusted'' [16] . Research has further suggested that there should be differentiation between personalized trust and generalized trust [15, 50] . In our discussion, we focus on generalized trust, as personalized trust usually refers to a relationship based on prior or subsequent relationships with another person, group, or organization [15] . Personalized trust usually relies on prior information about the actors, and there is an expectation of certain consequences. However, generalized trust goes beyond the social exchange between individual actors and is about trusting others in random situations or institutions without attachment to or knowledge of particular others [25] . Thus, generalized trust usually incorporates people not known personally. As Stolle [37] suggested, the boundaries of generalized trust include relationships beyond kinship, friendship, and acquaintance.",

More specifically, trust facilitates an environment in which members of the community can learn about and become socialized to attitudes, behaviors, and expectations held by the community [21] . This dynamic helps in developing social capital, which in turn strengthens the sense of collectivity. Collective action, such as community engagement and participation are likely to follow.

In his classic essay, ''Community Organization and Juvenile Delinquency,'' Park [27] argued that the ''habits'' of a community will collapse as the community experiences stress and undergoes change. To further develop this idea, Shaw and McKay [36] argued that when a community is under stress, there is more likely to be a breakdown in the social relations and organizational structures upon which the community relies. Although later studies have focused on how economic deprivation or rapid mobility affects crime rates in a community, the original argument of the social disorganization theory has strong implications for understanding how social relations and social lives in general are affected when a community is under stress. As Park [27] stated, a change or stress in the community ''that brings any measurable alteration in the routine of social life tends to break up habits; and in breaking up the habits upon which the existing social organization rests, destroys that organization itself.'' (p.107) Although the argument offers insights to understanding a community under stress, it is unclear how the ''social habits'' break up.",

In the context of our discussion, his argument implies that when a community is under stress, the informal control of social relations, such as trust and reciprocity, will be weakened. In turn, these elements of social relations will be decoupled when there is an outbreak of an epidemic in a community. In addition, later studies on issues related to ''free riders'' in groups showed that while institutions play an important role in reducing non-cooperative relationships by imposing heavy penalties on free riders, this control mechanism collapses when institutional arrangements weaken in a situation of vulnerability [28] . Although individuals may maintain trust and reciprocal relationships with selected others, they do not necessarily contribute to the community when they see the increase in free riders, because individuals are less likely to contribute to a group when they do not expect returns.",

Similarly, Erickson (1976) found that individuals' trust in community institutions is related to whether their community experienced disaster. Thus there was an effect on their contribution to the collective good. The differences between a natural disaster and an epidemic in relation to trust and reciprocity lie in the contagious nature of epidemics.

Thousands of people (close to 2,700) were infected and 446 died (including Taiwan, China, Hong Kong, and Canada only). 3 Taiwan is in close proximity to Hong Kong and China's Guangdong Province, which were considered the centres of SARS cases reported during the period of the outbreak. The SARS outbreak in Taiwan began with a businessman who travelled to Guangdong Province and returned to Taipei through Hong Kong on February 21, 2003 [5] . He was hospitalized on March 8. His wife and son also developed SARS-like symptoms. All cases were confirmed as SARS after various medical tests, including RT-PCR, on March 14. From March 14 to April 19, about 51 individuals were identified as probable cases. 4 SARS spread rapidly at the end of April. 78 cases were reported in April and the number jumped to 676 in May [11] . From the date of the first case reported to July 30 (30 days after Taiwan was removed from the list of affected areas by WHO), 151,270 individuals were quarantined, 3,032 cases were reported as suspecting to have contracted SARS, 667 cases were classified as probable cases, and 72 people had died [5] .

Arrangements were made for individuals with suspected symptoms to reside in isolated rooms with HEPA filtered air [5] . At the same time, local public health officials were responsible for ensuring adequate quarantine of all individuals with whom the patients had had recent contact. These contacts were quarantined because the virus seemed to be most active approximately 10 days after the onset of symptoms. Quarantine was first required for 14 days.

Despite the implementation of precautionary measures, the high number of SARS cases reported in this period was largely the result of severe infection within hospitals. Because an infected laundry worker continued to work in one of the hospitals for 6 days before being diagnosed with SARS, about 10,000 patients and visitors were exposed to the disease according to one estimate [5] . On April 24, all patients, staff, and visitors in the hospital were quarantined. Some SARS patients were transferred to other hospitals. Later, SARS spread to other hospitals and other cities. Most of the probable SARS cases and deaths were concentrated in Taipei City during the first peak period. During the worst period, in late April, the epidemic was so severe in two hospitals in Taipei that they had to shut down. The second peak occurred as the epidemic spread from Northern to Southern Taiwan by an infected female who was returning to her home in the South due to fever. Cases were found in a major teaching hospital in the South.",

In particular, close to 50% of respondents 3 According to a report from the World Health Organization, SARS is a disease caused by SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV). It has an incubation period of about 5-10 days. In the first week, patients develop influenza-like symptoms, such as fever and headache, although these symptoms are sometimes absent. Coughing, dyspnoea and diarrhoea usually develop in the second week. The severity of these symptoms progressed rapidly. About 20% of patients required intensive care by the second week. The clinical records indicate that transmission of the disease usually occurred in the second week. Drawing from the data gathered around the world, the fatality rate (number of deaths divided by total number of infected cases) ranged from 0% to 50% depending on the age of the patient. In Taiwan, the fatality rate rose from 3.8% in April to 45% in mid-May [11] . 4 According to WHO Guidelines [48] . ''WHO Guidelines for the Global Surveillance of Severe Respiratory Syndrome (SARS): Updated Recommendations October 2004.''), probable cases of SARS are ''an individual with clinical evidence of SARS epidemiologically linked to 'preliminary positive' or 'confirmed' cases of SARS or 'unverificable' cases of SARS if epidemiologically linked to 'preliminary positive' or 'confirmed' cases'' [48] Clinical evidence includes the symptoms of a history of fever of at least 38C and ''one or more symptoms of lower respiratory tract illness'' (such as coughing or shortness of breath) and ''radiographic evidence of lung infiltrates consistent with pneumonia or ARDS, or autopsy findings consistent with the pathology of pneumonia or ARDS without an identifiable cause,'' and ''no alternative diagnosis can fully explain the illness'' [48] . reduced the frequency of participating in gatherings with friends [22] . Some daily routines, such as going to school or work, were seriously affected. Classes at the universities were cancelled because suspected cases were identified among students or university personnel [41] .It is not surprising that many businesses suffered because of this reduction in social contacts. According to the same survey, about 40% of respondents reduced their visits to restaurants, and 30% reduced their visits to department stores.",

Two telephone surveys conducted during this period consistently showed that over fifty percent of the respondents did not trust other individuals or health institutions [4] . A substantial proportion also showed a lack of trust in government officials, medical experts, and healthcare workers [4] . This response indicated that the lack of knowledge about SARS at the beginning of the outbreak created an environment of mistrust in the community.

Hospital administrators had to be discreet about the admission of individuals with fever for fear that other patients would leave the institution once they learnt of the admission. Since hospital administrators no longer expected their healthcare workers to provide professional services based on reciprocal support, various precautionary measures were developed that greatly affected the provision of care to other patients. For example, large numbers of officials from the public health department were assigned to ensure that thousands of quarantined individuals stayed home [44] . Individuals with related symptoms went through additional testing procedures. These required procedures increased the already enormous workload of laboratories and X-ray departments in hospitals, and related personnel were under tremendous stress [45] .

In Table 1 , we divide our sample into those who resided in cities where SARS occurred and those in cities without cases of SARS. Cities where SARS occurred included the two largest cities in Taiwan, Taipei and Kaohsiung. We presented statistics to compare whether there were different patterns for respondents in Taipei and Kaohsiung and for respondents in other cities. A T test was used when means were presented, and a chi square test was used for categorical variables. By and large, as shown in Table 1 , a considerable proportion of residents in all cities reported that most people carried out the collective preventive preparation according to suggested guidelines (62%), but a far less proportion of residents reported that the community took good care of SARS patients and individuals who were quarantined (34%). Nonetheless, different response patterns were noted. About 66% of respondents in cities where SARS occurred suggested that all or most people carried out the collective preventive preparation according to suggested guidelines, and 29% considered that the community took adequate care of SARS patients and individuals who were quarantined. In cities where SARS did not occur, the responses were 61% and 35%, respectively.",

Respondents in cities where SARS occurred had a more favorable view of the collective preventive preparation. Only 15% of respondents from SARS cities answered, ''not familiar the guidelines'' to the question regarding compliance with guidelines compared to 22% in non-SARS cities.

Table 1 also reports the socioeconomic characteristics of respondents, which largely reflect the general sociodemographic characteristics of the Taiwan population. Close to 74% of the respondents were married or cohabiting, and over 20% were single. About 68% of the sample had completed senior high school. About 39% had a monthly income of less than NT$50,000. 6 The sociodemographic characteristics of respondents residing in two major cities where SARS cases were reported, Taipei and Kaohsiung, were quite different from those in other cities. The differences reflect the fact that these two cities are the major financial and industrial centers of northern and southern Taiwan, attracting a younger population with higher levels of education and income, which are reflected in a higher living standard. The higher socioeconomic status of the residents in Taipei and Kaohsiung may explain the finding that there was a relatively high level of perceived community action in the two cities.

The dependent variable of the first set of analysis is the respondent's perception of whether or not most people carried out the collective preventive preparation according to suggested guidelines. Since the variable is an ordinal variable, ordered logit regression was performed. We tested for over-dispersion as well as conducting likelihood ratio tests, and found the data to be over-dispersed for almost all models. The first model includes only independent variables that capture the level of trust. The second model includes independent variables to measure the sense of reciprocal relations among respondents. The third model taps the trust level and the reciprocity level. Finally, the last model controls for the socioeconomic background of respondents. Cases in which any of the variables under study were missing were excluded from the analyses. Consequently, the total sample for analysis is 1,189. 7 The first model shows that all levels of trust are positively associated with higher perceived preventive preparation. The association is stronger for higher levels of trust. The results clearly suggest that a higher trust level is related to a higher level of perceived community preventive preparation. The second model includes only the level of reciprocity. Results show a positive and significant relationship between level of reciprocity and perception of collective preventive measures. The results remain the same when both variables are included in Model 3. 8 The final model controls for the socioeconomic background of respondents. The results show that there is still a consistently positive relationship between the levels of trust and reciprocity and the level of perceived community collective preventive preparation. Most of the socioeconomic characteristics of respondents are not related to the level of perceived community preventive preparation. In other words, the perception of community preventive preparation is not affected by socioeconomic background, but it is affected by the collective efficacy, measured by levels of trust and reciprocity. 7 We also ran models with different contrasts of the variables.

Despite statistically significant differences in responses, closer look of the data shows that a considerable proportion of residents perceived that the community maintained a high level of community action, both in cities that experienced the outbreak of SARS and in cities that did not. One possible reason is that the widespread news coverage of SARS on the island.

In cities where there was no SARS outbreak, trust and sense of reciprocity are positively related to perceived community action taken, as suggested by Hypotheses 1. However, as suggested in Hypothesis 3, the relationships are not significant in cities that experienced the outbreak. A possible explanation of the high level of community action in cities that experienced outbreaks and those that did not is that, while trust and reciprocity do not relate to perceived collective action in cities with SARS, different elements of social relations, such as avoidance or self-protection, rather than trust and reciprocity, contributed to the community action in cities that experienced SARS. Since trust can be seen as ''rational expectation,'' then avoidance or selfprotection is another form of social relations based on rationality [14] . As Coleman [7] succinctly argued, social relations are no longer based on trust and reciprocity when individuals feel fear and anxiety. Given their sense of uncertainty, they consider it too risky to cultivate relationships based on trust and reciprocity that would lead to long-term stable relations. Therefore, our findings show that perceived community action taken is possible in an uncertain and stressful environment, but not through trust and reciprocity. It is possible that individuals develop defensive strategies in such circumstances and are still take community action. One possible defensive strategy is to reduce the interaction between the community at large and the family, a smaller social unit, while family members take care of one another. The aggregate effect is community action still possible. In short, the study has several directions for our future study of the impact of the outbreak of an epidemic on social functioning. First, modern media can vividly portray events associated with the outbreak, and broadcast widely beyond any geographical limitations. Subsequently, though statistically significant differences in responses, analysis of the data shows that a considerable proportion of residents perceived that the community maintained a high level of community action, both in cities that experienced the outbreak of SARS and in cities that did not. Future studies of the outbreak of epidemics should explore these effects of spatial diffusion on collective efficacy and community action in nearby communities. Second, the study has demonstrated that how community action operates can be strongly related to the outbreak of an epidemic. The impact is far-reaching and fundamental to the core of social relations: trust and reciprocity. However, at the same time, the findings suggest that the maintenance of community action in communities where SARS occurred could be retained by other elements of social relations. In other words, community action is not necessarily related to trust and reciprocity. Further studies should identify the alternative elements that are related to community action and how these elements relate to trust and reciprocity in contributing to community collective efficacy. Finally, though our study can show the relationship of how collective efficacy level is related to community action, future study should determine whether collective efficacy affects community action or vice versa.",
