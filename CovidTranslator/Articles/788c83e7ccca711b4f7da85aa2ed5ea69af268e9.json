The infection has predominantly respiratory transmission and is transmitted through large droplets or aerosols, and less commonly by contact with infected surfaces or fomites. The alarming spread of the infection and the severe clinical disease that it may cause, have led to the widespread institution of social distancing measures. Due to repeated exposure to potentially infectious patients and specimens, healthcare and laboratory personnel are particularly susceptible to contract COVID-19. This review paper provides an assessment of the current state of knowledge about the disease and its pathology, and the potential presence of the virus in cytology specimens. It also discusses the measures that cytology laboratories can take to function during the pandemic, and minimize the risk to their personnel, trainees and pathologists. In addition, it explores potential means to continue to educate trainees during the COVID-19 pandemic.",

These \"social distancing\" measures vary somewhat by state and city but are generally wide-ranging. They include cancelling sports, music, cultural and even political events, and the closing of gyms, schools and colleges, recommendations to work from home, to avoid discretionary travel, to avoid eating or drinking in bars, restaurants and food courts, and avoid social gatherings in groups of more than 10 people. This situation is not unprecedented, although the 100-year-old precedent is mostly forgotten. During the 1918-19 H1N1 \"Spanish\" influenza pandemic, which infected a fifth to a third of the world population, and during which 50 million people have died worldwide 1, 2 , including an estimated 675,000 Americans, the United States has adopted a range of nonpharmaceutical (public health) interventions. These measures, which were similar to those currently adopted, included closure of schools and churches, banning of mass gatherings, mandated mask wearing, case isolation, and disinfection/hygiene measures 3 . However, these measures were not implemented at the same time or for the same duration in different cities, nor were they uniformly followed. A recent analysis concluded that in some cities (San Francisco, St. Louis, Milwaukee, and Kansas City), where the measures were implemented early, they reduced transmission rates by up to 30-50% 3 . Cities that implemented such measures earlier had greater delays in reaching peak",

We do not know how long this pandemic will last, and what its toll on communities will be in terms of fatalities, psychological, physical and economic well-being. Mathematical models using available data predict widely different outcomes, but worst-case scenarios, which have to be taken into account, predict the potential for millions of infected patients with an unacceptably high number of fatalities. The problem with such modelling is not only that different models make different projections, but that the basic assumptions about the virus, based on which these models were developed are far from certain. This is especially true for the two most basic values that predict the spread and impact of a virus: its basic reproductive number (R0) and its case fatality rate (CFR). The basic reproductive number (R0) is the number of secondary cases that one case would produce in a susceptible community. The value of R0 usually decreases during an outbreak of infection, as the susceptible population decreases, and measures to prevent the transmission are established.",

The other important number is the CFR, which is calculated by dividing the number of deaths caused by the disease by the number of patients affected with that disease. For COVID-19, this number also varies greatly and is impacted by under-testing, the under-reporting of mild and asymptomatic cases, and the focus on more severe cases. This may be, at least in part, the reason why the CFR is much higher in studies from the Wuhan province, where it was 2.3%, than in studies from elsewhere in China that show a CFR around 1% 5 . The case fatality rate is usually quoted to be around 2% and is similar in China 6 , Iran 7 and Italy 8 . However, it varies between 0.25% and 3%, and lower estimates may be closer to the true value 9, 10 . The estimated infection fatality risk (IFR), i.e. the risk of death among all infected individuals (including those with no apparent disease) is 0.3% to 0.6%, which is comparable to the Asian influenza pandemic of 1957-1958 11 . However, other influenza pandemics had very different mortality rates and ranged from 0.001-0.007% for the 2009 H1N1 influenza to estimates ranging from 0.5 to 3% 12, 13 for the 1918 influenza pandemic. The high mortality rate of the 1918 influenza pandemic was related only in part to the pathogenicity of the virus itself, and the cytokine storm that it produced. Important contributors were the context in which the 1918 pandemic occurred, at the end of World War I, with overcrowded barracks, poverty, poor nutrition, poor hygiene, household/community-level crowding, lack of preparation of the population and decision-makers due to cognitive inertia 14 , and poor medical and insufficient nursing care.",

After exposure to an infected individual, or less likely a contaminated surface or fomite, the mean incubation period of COVID-19 is about 5 days, but can be much longer, up to 24 days. Nonetheless, 95% of patients who develop clinical disease do so within 12.5 days. The initial presentation is with fever (90-96% of cases 15 ) and mild to severe respiratory symptoms including cough in 70%, dyspnea in 45%, and muscle soreness or fatigue in 40% 15 . 10% of patients or less have sore throat, headaches or diarrhea 25 . Imaging findings are usually those of pneumonia, with bilateral pulmonary infiltrates in 97% of cases 15 Compared to other pneumonias, COVID-19 pneumonia more frequently is more likely to have a peripheral distribution, ground-glass or fine reticular opacities, and is less likely to have a central involvement, pleural effusion or lymphadenopathy 26 . Laboratory findings are nonspecific but usually include leukocytosis with lymphopenia, mildly increased liver enzymes, muscle enzymes, myoglobin, and LDH and increase in acute phase reactants. Increased procalcitonin, severe lymphopenia and elevated D-dimers were features that correlated with more severe disease. In severe cases, the disease may progress to respiratory, circulatory and renal failure, and ultimately death due to multiorgan failure.",

Since the receptor for SARS-CoV-2, ACE2, is also expressed on cardiac myocytes and vascular endothelial cells, the virus could, at least theoretically, directly involve the heart and vascular endothelium. This would explain the fulminant myocarditis that some patients clinically 29, 30 , or show myocardial interstitial mononuclear inflammatory infiltrates.

Psychologic stress may be experienced differently by different people, and may be modulated by personal factors like age, sex, health status, baseline anxiety level and risk perception. More severe psychologic distress may be followed by increased levels of posttraumatic stress symptomatology 59 . Psychological distress may be related to increased work load due to coworker absenteeism, lack of socialization with friends and colleagues, lack of recreational activities due to the closure of gyms, restaurants, movie theaters and other recreational avenues, and increased family stress and parenting issues due to children being at home as a result of school closings. It may also relate to having a friend or family member affected by the disease. All healthcare workers may also feel anxious and stressed due to the fear of contracting the disease, fear of transmitting the disease to members of the family, or financial fears related to the changes implemented during this period. During this period, laboratory directors and other pathologists should be prepared to provide up to date information regarding the most recent developments in our knowledge about the disease and candid information regarding all aspects of the personnel's job. Although such information may also be available from a variety of sources, including the CDC and the health care center's website, in order to alleviate the fear and anxiety, it is important to have clear channels of communication, transmit the information in person, and respond to any questions that may arise. Providing emotional support and an opportunity to discuss any personal and family concerns is crucial during these times.

These measures are meant mostly as a mitigation strategy, to limit transmission, and to prevent the fast spread of the virus and \"level the infection curve\" to prevent overwhelming of the health care system.At the level of hospitals and other health care institutions, decisions are made to prioritize the essential health care work and reduce elective outpatient visits and inpatient admissions for elective interventions or operations.

Clearly, any person having respiratory symptoms that could be caused by COVID-19 should not come to work and should instead consult their physician or health care professional. Emergency plans and contingency plans should be made for the possibility that a large proportion of the laboratory personnel has either fallen ill or is under quarantine. Communicating any changes or delays in service to the clinical service providers and departments is particularly important, to avoid overwhelming the laboratory with inquiries about test results. The role of the cytology laboratory in a patient with known COVID-19 is limited. In analogy to the role of the cytology laboratory in SARS, it is mainly to rule out superimposed pulmonary infections in sputum and other respiratory specimens. The cytologic features seen in sputa are nonspecific and reflect the underlying acute pulmonary injury pattern. They consist of the presence of increased number of macrophages, forming loose macrophage aggregates. The macrophages may also show cytoplasmic changes, including the presence of foamy cytoplasm or larger cytoplasmic vacuoles or nuclear changes, including multinucleation and ground glass appearance of nuclei 42 . Since bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid is sometimes obtained for viral identification 43-45 and is occasionally positive when nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab samples are negative 46 , an aliquot may also be sent to the cytology laboratory. However, the cytologic findings of BAL samples of patients with COVID-19 were not yet reported. In patients with MERS, cytological examination of BAL fluid reportedly showed high numbers of neutrophils and macrophages 47 . Based on the histopathology of SARS, MERS and COVID-19, BAL specimens may also show squamous metaplasia, and features of repair, which together with the presence multinucleated cells and highly atypical alveolar type 2 pneumocytes showing cellular and nuclear enlargement, prominent nucleoli and chromatin clearing. 34 These cytomorphologic features may represent a potential diagnostic pitfall.",

Splash shields, sealed centrifuge rotors or sample cups are recommended for centrifugation; rotors and cups should be loaded and unloaded in a BSC51 .    3. The virus is inactivated by formalin and gamma irradiation. Therefore, according to the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines 51 , cytology laboratory activities, such as the pathologic examination and processing of formalin-fixed or otherwise inactivated tissues (cell block preparations), and the routine staining and microscopic analysis of fixed smears are assigned biosafety level 2 (BSL-2). This is the typical biosafety level of all pathology laboratories and is assigned when working with agents associated with human diseases that pose a moderate health hazard or when working with any human-derived sample, including blood, body fluids, or tissue, in which the presence of an infectious agent is unknown. Most cytology specimens are fixed in either formalin or alcohol solutions with over 70% alcohol, which are considered effective to destroy this virus. It is not known if fixatives using much weaker alcohol solutions, such as PreservCyt\u00ae and CytoLyt\u00ae (Hologic, Inc. Marlborough, MA) and SurePath\u00ae (Becton, Dickinson and Company, Franklin Lakes, NJ) are adequately inactivating the virus. Therefore additional precautions, like the use of gloves may be indicated while handling and interpreting cytologic preparations processed with these fixatives. Some pathologists may prefer using gloves for all their slides, since glass slides are touched by multiple hands until they reach the pathologist's desk, and cannot be easily decontaminated. Although dipping the slides in 95% alcohol (or similar) for a couple of minutes would inactivate the virus, it would also erase the marks (\"dots\") on the slides.Other surface disinfectants, especially ones with short contact times, as mentioned below, can be tried to determine the practicality of their use on cytology slides.4. General safe laboratory practices, especially procedures that are basic to good microbiological practices and procedures should be followed as recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO)53 and the CDC 51, 54 . This includes training all personnel in the use of the protective equipment, limiting access to the laboratory, frequent handwashing, and wearing personal protective equipment (PPE). Handwashing should be performed thoroughly with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Alternatively, an alcohol-based hand sanitizer containing at least 62% alcohol can be used, if soap and water are not available. The use of PPE includes wearing gloves for all procedures, wearing a buttoned lab coat or gown, eye protection and, when needed, wearing a mask. Touching mucosal membranes of the eyes, nose and mouth should be avoided. In addition, because the virus can remain viable on surfaces (especially plastic and stainless steel surfaces) for up to 72 hours 55 , it is recommended to decontaminate all work surfaces multiple times per day, using EPA approved disinfectant solutions, wipes, towelettes or sprays. In addition to benches, this includes decontamination of computer keyboards, phones, and frequently touched areas of microscopes. The chemical substances involved include, among others, ethanol (minimum concentration of 62%-71%), 0.5% hydrogen peroxide, quaternary ammonium, sodium hypochlorite (0.1%), and a variety of acid solutions in various concentrations. These substances should be used with the manufacturer-recommended disinfection directions and preparations for Human Coronavirus and the recommended contact time (i.e. the time the surface remains wet) which may range from 30 seconds to 10 minutes 56 .",
