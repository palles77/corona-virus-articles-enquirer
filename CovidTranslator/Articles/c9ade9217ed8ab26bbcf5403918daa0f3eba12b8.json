The human respiratory tract spans from the nostrils to the lung alveoli and is inhabited by niche-specific communities of bacteria. The microbiota of the respiratory tract probably acts as a gatekeeper that provides resistance to colonization by respiratory pathogens. The respiratory microbiota might also be involved in the maturation and maintenance of homeostasis of respiratory physiology and immunity. The ecological and environmental factors that direct the development of microbial communities in the respiratory tract and how these communities affect respiratory health are the focus of current research. Concurrently, the functions of the microbiome of the upper and lower respiratory tract in the physiology of the human host are being studied in detail. In this Review, we will discuss the epidemiological, biological and functional evidence that support the physiological role of the respiratory microbiota in the maintenance of human health.

Specific sites in the respiratory tract contain specialized bacterial communities that are thought to have a major role in the maintenance of human health. In the past decade, next-generation sequencing has led to major advances in our understanding of the possible functions of the resident microbiota. So far, research has largely focused on the gut microbiota and gut microbiota-derived metabolites, and their influence on host metabolism and immunity. However, recent studies on microbial ecosystems at other body sites, including the respiratory tract, reveal an even broader role for the microbiota in human health 1 .",

            "text": "The respiratory tract is a complex organ system that is divided into the upper respiratory tract (URT) and the lower respiratory tract (LRT). The URT includes the anterior nares, nasal passages, paranasal sinuses, the nasopharynx and oropharynx, and the portion of the larynx above the vocal cords, whereas the LRT includes the portion of the larynx below the vocal cords, the trachea, smaller airways (that is, bronchi and bronchioli) and alveoli. The primary function of the respiratory tract in human physiology is the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide. For this purpose, the adult human airways have a surface area of approximately 70 m 2 , which is 40 times larger than the surface area of the skin 2 . This entire surface is inhabited by niche-specific bacterial communities, with the highest bacterial densities observed in the URT (FIG. 1) . Over the years, evidence for the roles that bacterial communities in the URT have in preventing respiratory pathogens from establishing an infection on the mucosal surface and spreading to the LRT has accumulated. For most respiratory bacterial pathogens, colonization of the URT is a necessary first step before causing an upper, lower or disseminated respiratory infection 3 . Inhibition of this first step of pathogenesis for respiratory infections by the resident microbiota, a process that is also called 'colonization resistance' , might be of paramount importance to respiratory health. Furthermore, if a pathogen has colonized the mucosal surface, it might be beneficial to both the microbial community and the host that these pathogens are kept at bay, preventing their overgrowth, inflammation and subsequent local or systemic spread 4 . In addition to this symbiotic relationship, the respiratory microbiota probably has a role in the structural maturation of the respiratory tract 5 and in shaping local immunity 6,7 .",

Indeed, the formation of alveoli begins in a late fetal stage and their development continues throughout the first three years of life 11 .

            "text": "Similar to the anatomical development of the respiratory tract, the initial acquisition of microorganisms marks the establishment of the respiratory microbiota in early life. The establishment of the respiratory microbiota is thought to have an effect on the morphogenesis of the respiratory tract. Indeed, germ-free rodents tend to have smaller lungs 12 and a decreased number of mature alveoli 5 . The latter finding was supported by experiments in which the nasal cavities of germ-free mouse pups were colonized with Lactobacillus spp., after which the number of mature alveoli normalized 5 . Intriguingly, the nasopharyngeal-associated lymphoid tissue (NALT) also develops mostly after birth, which suggests that its development requires environmental cuesfor example, from the local microbiota 13 . Physiological and microbial gradients exist along the nasal cavity, nasopharynx, oropharynx, trachea and the lungs. The pH gradually increases along the respiratory tract [177] [178] [179] [180] , whereas most of the increases in relative humidity (RH) and temperature occur in the nasal cavity [181] [182] [183] . Furthermore, the partial pressures of oxygen (pO 2 ) and carbon dioxide (pCO 2 ) have opposing gradients 180 that are determined by environmental air conditions and gas exchange at the surface of the lungs 181, 184, 185 . Inhalation results in the deposition of particles from the environment into the respiratory tract; inhaled particles that are more than 10 \u03bcm in diameter are deposited in the upper respiratory tract (URT), whereas particles less than 1 \u03bcm in diameter can reach the lungs. These particles include bacteria-containing and virus-containing particles, which are typically larger than 0.4 \u03bcm in diameter 186 . These physiological parameters determine the niche-specific selective growth conditions that ultimately shape the microbial communities along the respiratory tract. The unit by which bacterial density is measured varies per niche; the density in the environment is depicted as bacteria per cm 3 (indoor) air 187 , density measures in the nasal cavity and nasopharynx are shown as an estimated number of bacteria per nasal swab 74 , and the densities in the oropharynx and the lungs represent the estimated number of bacteria per ml of oral wash 57, 74 or bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) 57 Microbiota towards a presumed health-promoting microbiota profile more often and more swiftly 20,23 . These findings were corroborated by epidemiological findings that showed breastfeeding-mediated protection against infections 24 , which is presumably a consequence of the transfer of maternal antibodies 18 and beneficial microorganisms in breast milk, such as Bifidobacterium spp. and Lactobacillus spp. 25, 26 . Conversely, the development of the respiratory microbiota can be disturbed, for example, through the use of antibiotics, which are commonly used in young children to treat infections 27 . Antibiotic perturbations were characterized by a decreased abundance of presumed beneficial commensal bacteria, such as Dolosigranulum spp. and Corynebacterium spp. in the URT of healthy children 22, 28, 29 . This, in turn, might increase the risk of respiratory tract infections following antibiotic treatment 30 . In addition, season, vaccination, presence of siblings, day-care attendance, exposure to smoke and prior infections can also affect the infant microbiota 22,31-35 , which indicates that the microbiota during early life is dynamic and affected by numerous host and environmental factors (FIG. 2) . Host genetics seems to have a minor effect on the URT microbiota in healthy individuals, only influencing nasal bacterial density and not the composition of the microbiota 36 . By contrast, the composition of the sputum microbiota seems to be influenced equally by host genetics and environmental factors 37 .",

For various macroscale ecosystems, such as forests and coral reefs, it is well established that greater biodiversity increases the efficiency by which ecological communities are capable of using essential resources 59 . Similarly, the diversity of specific microscale ecosystems in the human host, such as the gut microbiota, has been associated with health outcomes. For example, increased diversity of intestinal bacteria has been linked to the absence of inflammatory bowel disease, obesity 60 and resistance against acute infections by enteropathogens 61 . Conversely, at other body sites, such as the vagina, low bacterial diversity is considered 'healthy' as it is associated with decreased incidences of bacterial vaginosis 62,63 and premature birth 64 , which highlights the niche-specific effect of biodiversity on human health. In the respiratory tract, evidence indicates that acute URT infections, such as acute otitis media (AOM) 29, 65 , and mucosal inflammation in chronic rhinosinusitis 66 are associated with a decrease in the diversity of local bacterial communities. However, other studies report a less clear association between diversity and respiratory health, which suggests that the composition of bacterial communities, in a nichespecific ecological context, also affects respiratory health 52 . Moreover, certain members of the microbiota, known as 'keystone species' , may have exceptionally large beneficial effects on ecosystem balance, function and health 67 . Potential keystone species in the URT microbiota are Dolosigranulum spp. and Corynebacterium spp., as they have been strongly associated with respiratory health and the exclusion of potential pathogens, most notably Streptococcus pneumoniae, in several epidemiological and mechanistic studies 21,29,68,69 .",

The principal mechanism that underlies colonization resistance is that members of a diverse local microbiome probably use all of the nutrients that are available, thereby preventing pathogens from finding the necessary resources for colonization. Although cross-sectional surveys have demonstrated associations between decreased diversity and pathogen colonization, no direct evidence exists that demonstrates that increased microbial diversity in the respiratory tract can protect against the acquisition of pathogens. However, specific members of the microbiota have been identified that can actively exclude pathogens from the nasopharyngeal niche. For example, Staphylococcus epidermidis was shown to exclude Staphylococcus aureus and destroy pre-existing biofilms through the secretion of serine proteases 71 . Furthermore, colonization resistance may be enhanced by interactions with the host immune system. For example, neutrophils seemed more able to kill S. pneumoniae following priming with Haemophilus influenzae 72 .",

Another potential source of bacteria in the LRT is the direct inhalation of ambient air, albeit, to date, its direct influence on the lung microbiome is unknown.

Such low quantities of DNA preclude whole-genome sequencing, which results in hindered taxonomic resolution and functional interpretation of microbiome data. Furthermore, sampling of the lower respiratory tract (LRT) is cumbersome and is typically based on BAL or the collection of expectorated sputum. Both sampling methods carry a high risk of cross-contamination of the LRT samples with resident bacterial communities in the upper respiratory tract (URT). Distinguishing between authentic LRT communities and URT contamination is further complicated because of the anatomical link between both niches. Once bacterial DNA has been extracted, the quantity can be so low that contamination from environmental DNA invalidates the results 154, 155 . The development of standard operating procedures, including the careful use of appropriate negative controls at different stages of the sampling and laboratory workflow, can help to identify and exclude sequences from contaminating sources 20,156 .",

Furthermore, interactions between species in the Staphylococcus genus might help to prevent S. aureus from overgrowing as well; for example, its colonization is hindered by serine protease activity in S. epidermidis 71 and by the production of lugdunin by Staphylococcus lugdunensis, which is a natural antibiotic that is also active against other potential pathogens 98 .",

A second example of these mechanisms is the frequent co-occurrence of Corynebacterium spp. and Dolosigranulum spp. in the nasopharynx 20,22,69 , in which Dolosigranulum spp. might be responsible for the acidification of the local environment, which, in turn, may facilitate the expansion of Corynebacterium spp.; however, a direct interaction between these species cannot be ruled out.

For example, nasopharyngeal-associated lymphoid tissue (NALT) organogenesis is only initiated in the first week of life and is stimulated by cholera toxin, which suggests that NALT organogenesis may require microbiota-derived signals 13 . Similarly, the exposure of neonatal mice to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) led to the formation of bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue (BALT), which was not observed when mice were only exposed later in life 170 . Furthermore, it was demonstrated that neonatal, but not adult, bacterial colonization attracts activated regulatory T cells (T reg cells) to the skin and is necessary for the induction of immune tolerance to skin commensals 171 . Similarly, the lung microbiota promotes the transient expression of programmed death ligand 1 (PDL1) in dendritic cells during the first two weeks of life, which is necessary for the T reg cell-mediated attenuation of allergic airway responses 7 . Furthermore, hypermethylation of the CXC-motif chemokine ligand 16 (Cxcl16) gene in the lungs of germ-free mice increases the expression of CXCL16 and the accumulation of invariant natural killer T cells (NKT cells), which are known for their role in inflammation and asthma 6 . Transplantation of the microbiotas from normal mice at neonatal, but not adult age, prevented the accumulation of NKT cells, which abrogated disease in these mice (FIG. 3) .",

In serum, there is an estimated daily turnover of more than 10 9 anellovirus particles, which is thought to induce continuous immune surveillance and influence inhabitation by other microorganisms 172 . Similarly, chronic infection with herpesviruses, which have co-evolved with mammals for millions of years 173 and can be detected in more than 90% of humans 172 , protects against bacterial infections by increasing the basal expression of interferon-\u03b3 (IFN\u03b3) and facilitating the activation of macrophages 174 . Likewise, acute infection with common respiratory viruses activates innate immune pathways that remain active after the virus has been cleared. For example, infection with Sendai virus in mice is associated with the interleukin-13 (IL-13)-dependent activation of natural killer T cells (NKT cells) and lung macrophages and subsequent airway hyper-reactivity 175 . Similarly, early infection with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) leads to impaired regulatory T cell (T reg cell) function in mice, which increases the risk of allergic airway disease 169 . These findings are further supported by data from a human infant cohort study, in which persisting immune dysregulation was still detected one month after acute RSV infection 176 .

A multidisciplinary approach to extract patterns and associations from these studies could culminate in individualized risk assessment and preventive personalized medicine, as illustrated by a study in which dietary interventions that were made based on the gut microbiota led to the improved control of post-meal glucose levels 151 . Microbiota-based interventions are likely to be most beneficial in young children, as a window of opportunity within which the local microbiota primes specific features of the immune system seems to exist. Interventions during this impressionable period could redirect an aberrant developmental route, potentially influencing long-term respiratory health.",

            "text": "Host-microbiota interactions in the respiratory tract occur mostly at the mucosal surface. Resident microorganisms prime immune cells either locally or systemically; these include epithelial cells, neutrophils and dendritic cells, which all contribute to the clearance of pathogens. Moreover, microbial signalling is necessary for the recruitment and activation of regulatory cells, such as anti-inflammatory alveolar macrophages (AMs) and regulatory T cells (T reg cells). Locally, the host will respond to microbial colonization through the release of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) and secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA). Sensing of the microbiota involves microfold (M) cells that activate tolerogenic dendritic cells. In addition, alveolar dendritic cells can directly sample luminal microorganisms. Together, these pathways lead to the regulation of inflammation and the induction of tolerance, which, in turn, shape resident bacterial communities. It is also plausible that early bacterial colonization is key to long-term immune regulation, which is illustrated by the microbiota-induced decrease in hypermethylation of the CXC-motif chemokine ligand 16 (Cxcl16) gene, which prevents the accumulation of inducible natural killer T cells (iNKT cells), and by the programmed death ligand 1 (PDL1)-mediated induction of tolerogenic dendritic cells",
