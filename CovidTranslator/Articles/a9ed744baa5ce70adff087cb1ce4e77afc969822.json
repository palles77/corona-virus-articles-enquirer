This study is the first to examine the role of LRF in CNS pathology. We first examined LRF expression in a murine viral model of spinal cord demyelination with clinically relevant lesion characteristics. LRF was rarely expressed in oligodendrocyte progenitors (OP) yet, was detected in nuclei of the majority of oligodendrocytes in healthy adult CNS and during remyelination. Plp/CreER T :Zbtb7a fl/fl mice were then used with cuprizone demyelination to determine the effect of LRF knockdown on oligodendrocyte repopulation and remyelination. Cuprizone was given for 6 weeks to demyelinate the corpus callosum. Tamoxifen was administered at 4, 5, or 6 weeks after the start of cuprizone. Tamoxifen-induced knockdown of LRF impaired remyelination during 3 or 6-week recovery periods after cuprizone. LRF knockdown earlier within the oligodendrocyte lineage using NG2CreER T :Zbtb7a fl/fl mice reduced myelination after 6 weeks of cuprizone.",

In vitro promoter assays demonstrated the potential for LRF to regulate transcription of myelin-related genes and the notch target Hes5, which has been implicated in control of myelin formation and repair. In summary, in the oligodendrocyte lineage, LRF is expressed mainly in oligodendrocytes but is not required for oligodendrocyte repopulation of demyelinated lesions. Furthermore, LRF can modulate the extent of remyelination, potentially by contributing to interactions regulating transcription.",

            "text": "LRF warrants particular interest as a potential point of intersection between HDAC1 promoter regulation and notch signaling. LRF has been referred to as the \"most exciting yet enigmatic\" member of the POK/ZBTB family of transcription factors, which generally act as transcriptional repressors (Lunardi, Guarnerio, Wang, Maeda, & Pandolfi, 2013) . The 43 known members of this protein family contain a POK/ BTB domain at the N terminus, which mediates protein-protein interac-tions, while the C terminus contains multiple Kruppel-type zinc fingers that bind DNA. The gene zinc finger and BTB domain-containing protein 7A (Zbtb7a) encodes the protein referred to as LRF (mouse), OCZF (rat), or FBI-1 (human) and will be referred to as LRF here. LRF binds corepressors and recruits HDAC1 to gene targets with consensus LRF binding sites (Liu et al., 2004; Lunardi, Guarnerio, Wang, Maeda, & Pandolfi, 2013) . LRF plays a critical role in promoting differentiation of B cells by suppressing Notch1 signals that instruct differentiation along the T cell lineage (Lee et al., 2013; Maeda et al., 2007) . In multiple cell lines, LRF also interacts with sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) to synergistically activate transcription of fatty acid synthase (FASN) , which is essential for phospholipids in myelin and cell membranes . In OP cells, SREBPs are important regulators of oligodendrocyte maturation and FASN levels (Monnerie et al., 2017) . However, LRF activity can be stage-specific as shown for transcriptional regulation in the osteoclast lineage and also for fetal to adult type globin gene expression in erythroid cells (Masuda et al., 2016; Tsuji-Takechi et al., 2012) . Indeed, among hematopoietic lineages, LRF regulates differentiation by complexing with different key factors in a tissue-and context-dependent manner (Lunardi et al., 2013) .",

We previously showed that leukemia/lymphoma-related factor (LRF) promotes OP differentiation during postnatal myelination. We now examine LRF during CNS remyelination. We show that LRF is rarely detected in OP cells yet is present in nuclei of the majority of oligodendrocytes in healthy and remyelinating CNS. In vitro, LRF regulates transcription of myelin-related genes and notch target genes. In vivo, LRF is not required for oligodendroglial repopulation of demyelinated lesions yet modulates remyelination. regulate transcription of myelin genes and notch target genes during OP differentiation.

Tissue sections were immunostained for LRF using two different antibodies, which have been characterized in our previous developmental study (Dobson et al., 2012) . LRF immunolabeling was further tested to ensure specificity in lesion areas of MHV spinal cord sections. LRF immunostaining produced a similar pattern of nuclear immunofluorescence with the two different primary antibodies, and was eliminated with either omission of the primary antibody or incubation of the primary antibody with a 100 3 excess of competitive blocking peptide (Bethyl Laboratories; Supplemental Figure S1 ). Oligodendrocyte lineage cells were identified by expression of Olig2. OP cells were immunolabeled with an antibody to the external domain of NG2 (Goretzki, Burg, Grako, & Stallcup, 1999; Jones, Yamaguchi, Stallcup, & Tuszynski, 2002) . Oligodendrocytes were identified by antibodies against glutathione S-transferase pi (GSTpi) or adenomatous polyposis coli. Myelin was immunostained for 2',3'-cyclicnucleotide 3'-phosphodiesterase (CNP) or myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG; Breithaupt et al., 2003; Linnington, Webb, & Woodhams, 1984) . Organization of the node of Ranvier was detected by immunolabeling Nav1.6 sodium channels in the node along with contact in associated protein (Caspr) in the flanking paranodal regions. The LRF primary antibodies were detected with goat anti-hamster IgG F(ab')2 fragment conjugated with Cy3, or donkey anti-rabbit IgG F(ab')2 fragment conjugated with Cy3 (both from Jackson Immunoresearch). Donkey anti mouse IgG F(ab')2 fragment conjugated with Cy3 (Jackson Immunoresearch) was used to detect MOG. Olig2, NG2, GSTpi, CNP, and Hes5 were detected by goat anti-rabbit or donkey anti-rabbit IgG F (ab')2 fragment conjugated with Alexa Fluor 488 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, DAVIDSON ET AL. | 2393 CA). Donkey anti-rabbit IgG F(ab)2 fragment conjugated to Alexa Fluor 594 was used to detect Nav1.6 while Caspr was detected by donkey anti-mouse IgG F(ab')2 fragment conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 (both from Jackson Immunoresearch). Protocols were optimized to ensure that no signal was observed when primary antibody was not applied. All sections were incubated with DAPI (Sigma-Aldrich) to stain nuclei prior to mounting with Vectashield (Vector Labs).",

MHV infection results in oligodendrocyte loss over 2-3 wpi that causes focal demyelination throughout the spinal cord followed by OP amplification by 4 wpi, which then advances to oligodendrogenesis and remyelination by 8 wpi (Redwine & Armstrong, 1998; Vana et al., 2007b) . Immunohistochemistry for LRF, along with CNP to detect myelin, demonstrates the pattern of LRF Many cells immunolabeled for CNP (arrows in C') or Olig2 (arrows in F') exhibit nuclear LRF at 8 wpi. Olig2 cell populations recover by 8 wpi and the distribution of Olig2 cells is almost evenly split among those with or without LRF (G). Olig2 nuclear immunoreactivity was used to identify oligodendrocytes, as was clearly visible even at lower magnifications (D-F). A low intensity of Olig2 immunoreactivity in processes was detectable in lesion areas at higher magnifications (E', F'), which was considered non-specific signal due to changes in the lesion tissue. One way ANOVA using n 5 3 mice for each condition; Longitudinal analysis of behavior was included in the study design to assess the behavioral effect of LRF knockdown during the subsequent remyelination period ( Figure S4 ). Running activity on wheels with a complex pattern of rungs was used to detect impaired maximal running velocity, which is associated with myelination status of the corpus callosum in longitudinal studies of mice fed cuprizone (Hibbits, Pannu, Wu, & Armstrong, 2009; Mierzwa, Zhou, Hibbits, Vana, & Armstrong, 2013 ). In the current study, mice had wheels continuously available for running and every third week the wheel was changed from a training wheel (all rungs in place) to a complex wheel (non-uniform pattern of missing rungs). The same Plp/CreER T :Zbtb7a fl/fl mice that are shown for tissue analysis in Figures 3, 4 had running wheel data collected. These mice exhibited impaired maximal running velocity during cuprizone feeding, consistent with demyelination ( Figure S4a ).",

This result is consistent with LRF expression in only a minority of OP cells so that LRF deletion should have little effect at the OP stage.",

Demyelination of the corpus callosum was induced in Plp/CreERT:Zbtb7a fl/fl mice by feeding 0.3% cuprizone for 6 weeks. A higher dose of cuprizone was used to maximize demyelination and oligodendrocyte loss while allowing continuous access to either the training or complex wheel configuration. Mice were administered tamoxifen (Tam), or vehicle (Oil) after week 5 of cuprizone feeding and then perfused at the end of week 6 on cuprizone (no recovery; A, D) or after a 3 week period on a normal chow diet to allow for spontaneous remyelination (3 wks recovery; B, E). The mice analyzed for the 6 week recovery time point (6 wks recovery; C, F) are from the wheel assessments shown in Figure S3 and so were given tamoxifen at the end of the 6 week period of cuprizone demyelination. Quantification of MOG immunoreactivity was used to estimate the myelinated area of the corpus callosum (A-C). In mice administered tamoxifen to knockdown LRF, the extent of remyelination is significantly reduced at both the 3 and 6 week time points of the recovery period (3 weeks, p < 0.0364, Cohen's d effect size 5 1.35, n 5 6 oil, n 5 7 tamoxifen; 6 weeks, p < 0.0296, Cohen's d effect size 5 1.67, n 5 5 oil, n 5 5 tamoxifen).

This analysis included the promoters for MBP and CNP, which are repressed by Hes5 (Liu et al., 2006) , since LRF has been associated with the notch-signaling pathway (Lee et al., 2013; Maeda et al., 2007) . Transcriptional activity from the full length MBP promoter was highest in OP cells grown in defined medium (i.e., without mitogens), which indicates appropriate transcriptional regulation during OP differentiation ( Figure   7a ). LRF significantly repressed transcription from the full length MBP promoter (Figure 7a) . LRF regulation of a truncated MBP promoter was then used to examine dependence on Sp1 transcription factor binding sites. LRF can interact with Sp1 promoter elements and Sp1 phosphorylation initiates upregulation of MBP Guo, Eviatar-Ribak, & Miskimins, 2010) . In conditions that promoted differentiation, LRF repression of the truncated MBP required an intact Sp1 site (Figure 7b,c) . The second myelin-specific gene, CNP, is expressed from an early stage in the oligodendrocyte lineage (Zhang et al., 2009) ; accordingly, the CNP promoter response was expressed similarly with and without mitogens present. CNP transcription was strongly repressed by LRF in both growth conditions (Figure 7d ).",

LRF was examined in the context of demyelination, followed by oligodendrocyte regeneration and remyelination. This work shows nuclear LRF immunoreactivity in the majority of oligodendrocytes, but only rarely in OP stage cells. Therefore, LRF function was further examined in vivo with conditionally induced knockdown of LRF in FIG URE 7 LRF transcriptional regulation of myelin genes. Transcriptional activity was measured from transient transfections of OP cultures with expression plasmids either with (Tom-LRF) or without (Tom) the Zbtb7a insert encoding LRF, along with firefly luciferase plasmids containing myelin promoter elements, and Renilla luciferase as an internal control. Transcription from the full-length promoter for myelin basic protein (1323MBP) is significantly higher in defined medium (**p 5 0.0017), indicating appropriate upregulation as expected during OP differentiation in vitro (A). Co-transfection with the Tom-LRF plasmid significantly represses transcription from 1323MBP in defined medium (****p < 0.0001; A). Further, in defined medium, LRF repression of a truncated 105 bp MBP promoter requires the intact wild type Sp1 site (*p 5 0.0326; B) and is not observed with the mutation to prevent Sp1 binding (C). In the presence of mitogens, LRF does not alter transcription from the full-length 1323MBP promoter (A) yet gains repressive activity using the truncated construct with the wild type sequence (**p 5 0.0032; B) and with the Sp1 site mutated (****p < 0.0001; C). LRF expression significantly represses transcription from the 2',3'-cyclic-nucleotide 3'-phoshodiesterase (CNP) promoter in both growth conditions (****p < 0.0001; D). In the presence of LRF, transcription of fatty acid synthase from FASN is significantly increased by the addition of mitogens (**p 5 0.0037; E).

MBP and CNP have been shown to be repressed by Hes5 (Liu et al., 2006) . Therefore, LRF overexpression could be expected to release or de-repress MBP and CNP from Hes5 repression. Importantly, in vitro LRF co-transfection reduced MBP and CNP promoter activity (Figure 7) , which is not consistent with our in vivo results of reduced myelin levels with LRF knockdown during remyelination (Figures 4-6) . A potential explanation for this in vitro result is that LRF is overexpressed after transfection of the LRF plasmid. A further explanation may be that transfection at the OP cell stage is ectopic since LRF is not expressed in the majority OP cells in vivo. Furthermore, the binding sites of transfected MBP and CNP promoter constructs may not undergo the epigenetic modifications in myelin genes that occur with lineage progression. This artificial approach thus reveals a potent LRF repression of these myelin gene promoters, especially CNP, early in the lineage that must undergo as yet unknown modifications to prevent this potent repression of myelin genes in mature oligodendrocytes. Since high levels of membrane biogenesis are required for both cell proliferation and myelin formation, FASN may not be as restricted to such cell stage specific promoter modifications. Along these lines, we note that the adult brain and spinal cord exhibits strong LRF expression in neurons, which also have a high level of membrane biogenesis to maintain extensive processes and continuously synthesize vesicles for axonal transport.",

Somewhat surprisingly, LRF knockdown also did not alter the proportion of mature oligodendrocytes versus OP cells, with NG2 1 OP cells comprising 3% of the Olig2 population in mice administered tamoxifen (Figure 4 ). This finding is in contrast to our study of postnatal myelination during spinal cord development in which LRF knockdown inhibited differentiation to increase OP cells at the expense of oligodendrocytes (Dobson et al., 2012) .",

The deficit of remyelination was not sufficient to impair running on complex wheels ( Figure S4 ). Impairment on the complex wheel assessment has corresponded well with MOG detection of myelination status in the corpus callosum in our prior cuprizone studies (Hibbits et al., 2009; Mierzwa et al., 2013) . Additional assessments may be needed to detect more subtle effects from reduced remyelination, including changing the conditions of the complex wheel assessment to test motor skill learning (McKenzie et al., 2014) .",

Normal myelination is observed in PBS-injected control mice (Figure 1a) with LRF expressed in the nuclei of smaller cells throughout the white matter as well as in relatively large gray matter neurons (Figure 1a). The majority of oligodendrocyte lineage cells, detected by Olig2, exhibit nuclear LRF in normal white matter (PBS controls; Figure 1a,d,g). At 4 wpi, focal demyelination is evident based on the loss of immunoreactivity for myelin proteins, MOG (data not shown), or CNP (Figure 1b), as well as by loss of Olig2 cells (Figure 1e,g). Specifically, the population of Olig2 cells that express LRF is significantly reduced (Figure 1g). LRF cells without Olig2, i.e. non-oligodendrocyte lineage cells, are abundant in demyelinated lesions and co-label for markers of lymphocytes, microglia, and astrocytes (SupplementalFigure S2). At 8 wpi, demyelination is no longer detected using CNP immunostaining(Figure 1c) and lesion areas are repopulated by Olig2 cells(Figure 1f,g).

LRF expression in specific stages of oligodendrocyte lineage cells was distinguished by immunolabeling for NG2 to detect OP cells (Figure 2a-d) and for GSTpi to detect mature oligodendrocytes (Figure expressing LRF in demyelinated lesions (Figure 2e,g). During remyelination, GSTpi cells recover to control levels (Figure 2e,h). However, in MHV mice at 8 wpi the population of cells that expressed Olig2 without LRF is approximately 400 cells/mm 2 (Figure 1g), which is larger than the approximately 200 cells/mm 2 from the combination of NG2 and GSTpi cells without LRF (Figure 2d,e). Therefore, the LRF negative population includes a stage of cells detected by Olig2 and not accounted for by NG2 or GSTpi. Overall, LRF expression corresponds strongly with mature oligodendrocytes and changes along with the oligodendrocyte population throughout the progression from demyelination to remyelination. 3.2 | Conditional inducible knockdown of LRF during remyelination in Plp/CreER T :Zbtb7a fl/fl mice Our results show that oligodendrocytes are the main lineage stage expressing LRF in normal adult white matter and after MHV infection. Therefore, we used Plp/CreER T :Zbtb7a fl/fl mice for tamoxifen-induced genetic inactivation of LRF in vivo to test the effect of LRF loss in oligodendrocytes during remyelination. The corpus callosum was demyelinated by feeding mice 0.2% cuprizone for 6 weeks. Tamoxifen, or oil as the vehicle control, was administered at the end of cuprizone ingestion to knockdown the LRF expression and examine the effect on spontaneous remyelination during the subsequent 6-week period on normal chow. Effective LRF knockdown was demonstrated in Plp/CreER T : Zbtb7a fl/fl by double labeling nuclei for LRF and Olig2, a marker of oligodendrocyte lineage cells (Figure 3a-b). Tamoxifen administration significantly reduced expression of LRF among Olig2 immunolabeled cells (Figure 3c-f). This effective LRF knockdown did not change the overall density of Olig2 cells(Figure 3g). Since the mice used to demonstrate LRF knockdown had a 6 week recovery period to allow for remyelina-tion, effective demyelination at 6 weeks of cuprizone in Plp/CreER T : Zbtb7a fl/fl mice could not be confirmed in those same mice. Therefore, additional mice fed 0.2% cuprizone along with the LRF knockdown cohort were perfused at the end of the 6-week period of cuprizone feeding to confirm corpus callosum demyelination (Figure S3).The cohort of mice with demonstrated LRF knockdown was then analyzed to determine the extent of remyelination after the 6-week recovery period. MOG immunostaining showed remyelination had progressed in mice administered either oil(Figure 4a) or tamoxifen (Figure 4b) while quantification showed a significant reduction in the tamoxifen condition(Figure 4c). The MOG area reduction is modest but the tamoxifen area values are below the 97 th percentile of the oil area values, based on a large Cohen's d effect size. However, the density of oligodendrocytes identified by PLP expression was not different between mice administered tamoxifen versus oil(Figure 4d-f). Furthermore, LRF knockdown did not alter the populations within the oligodendrocyte lineage identified as OP cells by NG2 expression(Figure 4g-i) or as mature oligodendrocytes by CC1 immunoreactivity(Figure 4j-l).",

Spinal cord transverse sections immunostained for LRF (red) in combination with NG2 (green) to identify oligodendrocyte progenitor cells(A-D)  or GSTpi (green) to identify oligodendrocytes (E-H'). A-D: In the control white matter (A-A\"; PBS-injected match to 4 wpi MHV), LRF is typically absent from NG2 cells (examples shown with green arrows) but was found in the nucleus of some NG2 cells, particularly NG2 cells with rounded nuclei (example at white arrow). In response to demyelination, there is a significant increase in the density of NG2 cells without LRF in white matter of MHV infected mice (4 wpi; B, with quantification in D). As remyelination progresses, NG2 cell density normalizes (8 wpi; C, D). NG2 cells with thickened processes indicative of a reactive phenotype remain in lesion areas at 8 wpi (C\").

A subsequent cohort of Plp/CreER T :Zbtb7a fl/fl mice was treated with 0.3% cuprizone (Figure S4b). The higher cuprizone dose was used to maximize demyelination and oligodendrocyte loss while maintaining continuous availability of wheels to maintain the same paradigm used for the 0.2% cuprizone cohort. The results with 0.3% cuprizone again showed there was no difference between mice administered tamoxifen versus oil during the recovery period.Tamoxifen was next administered at earlier time points after cuprizone in Plp/CreER T :Zbtb7a fl/fl mice to further test the effect of LRF knockdown at an earlier stage of oligodendrocyte regeneration and remyelination. Tamoxifen was administered after week 5, and cuprizone ingestion was again used at the 0.3% dose to maximize demyelination and for tissue analysis along with the 0.3% cuprizone cohort that was tested on the wheel assay. At 6 weeks of cuprizone, mice were either perfused or given a 3-week recovery period on normal chow for analysis of early remyelination. Mice examined at the end of the 6 weeks of 0.3% cuprizone showed effective demyelination(Figure 5a). During the subsequent 3-week recovery period, remyelination was significantly reduced in mice administered tamoxifen(Figure 5b). While the MOG area reduction is modest, the tamoxifen area values are below the 90 th percentile of the oil area values, based on a large Cohen's d effect size. Using the mice from the complex wheel behavioral assessment, oligodendrogenesis and remyelination were also examined with tamoxifen administered at 6 weeks of 0.3% cuprizone, followed by 6 weeks for recovery on normal chow. Again, mice administered tamoxifen exhibited significantly less remyelination after the 6week recovery period(Figure 5c). The MOG area reduction is modest yet the tamoxifen area values are below the 95 th percentile of the oil area values, based on a large Cohen's d effect size calculation. In addition, the node of Ranvier organization is disrupted during cuprizone demyelination and continues to be markedly disorganized at 3 weeks after ending cuprizone (data not shown). With the progression of remyelination at 6 weeks after cuprizone, immunolabeling for Caspr and Nav1.6 shows relatively normal nodal structure in mice administered oil while examples of disrupted broader nodes continued to be found in mice administered tamoxifen(Figure 5c). Tamoxifen administration did not alter the density of oligodendrocytes at any of the time points(Figure 5d-f). These results with 0.3% cuprizone show that LRF knockdown reduces the extent of remyelination but does not alter oligodendrocyte repopulation of the corpus callosum. Therefore, LRF knockdown produced a relatively modest but significant reduction in remyelination in 3 independent cohorts of mice after either 0.2%(Figure 4c) or 0.3% cuprizone(Figure 5b,c).COLOR IN ONLINE AND PRINTFIG URE 3 Knockdown of LRF in oligodendrocytes during remyelination. Demyelination of the corpus callosum was induced in Plp/CreERT: Zbtb7a fl/fl mice by feeding 0.2% cuprizone for 6 weeks. Mice were then administered tamoxifen (Tam), or vehicle (Oil), followed by 6 weeks on a normal chow diet to allow for spontaneous remyelination. A-B: Coronal brain sections immunolabeled for Olig2 (green) to identify oligodendrocyte lineage cells and quantify expression of LRF (red) in mice administered vehicle (A) or tamoxifen (B). LRF is present in cells of the white matter including the corpus callosum (cc) and overlying cingulum (cg) and is strongly expressed in neurons, such as those of the adjacent cortex. C-G: Quantification of LRF and Olig2 labeling in the corpus callosum. LRF is significantly reduced in mice administered tamoxifen (C). Confirming appropriate conditional expression from the Plp/CreERT line, this LRF reduction is restricted to the oligodendrocyte lineage since cells that are not labeled for Olig2 do not show reduced LRF (D). Among cells expressing Olig2, those double labeled for LRF are significantly reduced in mice administered tamoxifen (E). Mice administered oil have few Olig2 cells that are not labeled with LRF (F). The total population of Olig2 cells is unchanged by tamoxifen administration and reduction of LRF expression (G). Scale bar 5 250 um. Student t-test using n 5 4 mice in each condition. inducible knockdown of LRF during early remyelination inNG2CreER T :Zbtb7a fl/fl mice To move the analysis of LRF further forward in the lineage, we performed cuprizone (0.3%) studies in NG2CreER T :Zbtb7a fl/fl mice (Figure 6). Mice were administered tamoxifen at 4 weeks of cuprizone and then analyzed at the end of the 6 weeks of cuprizone demyelination (Figure 6a-i). Mice administered tamoxifen had significantly lower levels of corpus callosum myelin, as estimated by MOG immunoreactivity (Figure 6a-c). In mice with tamoxifen administration, the MOG area is markedly reduced (approximately 44%) and the area values are below the 97 th percentile of the oil area values, based on a large Cohen's d effect size. After a 3-week recovery period on normal chow, myelination in mice given tamoxifen or vehicle recovered to similar levels (Figure S5). These findings indicate that LRF knockdown in NG2CreER T : Zbtb7a fl/fl mice impaired the early remyelination that occurs as FIG URE 4 LRF knockdown impairs remyelination, but not oligodendrocyte repopulation, after demyelination from 0.2% cuprizone ingestion.",

Similar studies have shown that protein kinase C phosphorylates Sp1 to increase MBP transcription in differentiated oligodendrocytes, but not in proliferating OP cells (Guo et al., 2010). LRF may repress MBP transcription in differentiating oligodendrocytes through interaction with phosphorylated Sp1 binding, which is abolished by mutation of the Sp1 site (Figure 7a-c).
