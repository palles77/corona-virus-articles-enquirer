The virus could be propagated in 3T3 cell culture where it produced multinucleated giant ceils and formed clear plaques. I t was identified as a member of the coronavirus group from the following results: RNA content was suggested by the lack of the effect of cytosine arabinoside, the infectivity was sensitive to lipid solvents and inactivated at 56\u00b0C for 5 minutes, the viral particle showed typical coronavirus morphology which was approximately 100 nm in diameter. Serologically, although CARS and sialodacryoadenitis virus (SDAV) actually belonged to the rat-coronavirus group, some antigenic variations existed between these two agents in the results of both neutralization and complement-fixation tests using monovalent antisera. When inoculated intranasally into susceptible rats, CARS caused clinically and histologically overt sialoadenitis as observed in the natural outbreak, and retained its virulence for rats in several passages of mouse brain and even when ceil culture was used, while rats which were inoculated with SDAV were asymptomatie.",

For instance, mice infected with mouse hepatitis virus develop hepatitis, encephalitis, chronic immunological mediated diseases (15, 21) and diarrhoea (12) , and in rats, rhinitis and tracheitis (5) , pneumonitis (5, 16) , sialodacryoadenitis (13, 23) and disorder of oesterous cycle (20) were caused by coronaviruses. Two different kinds of coronavirus have been isolated from rats. One is Parker's rat coronavirus (RCV) which causes lethal interstitial pneumonia in newborn rats (16) , and the other is SDAV isolated from submaxillary glands of naturallyinfected rats showing siulodacryoadenitis (3) . An antigenic relationship between these two viruses has been also reported (3) .",

The cultures were observed for periods of 20 to 30 days, with changes of the medium at intervals of 2 to 3 days. In 3 T 3 cell culture only, small loci of multinucleated giant cells were observed on the 14th to 15th days following inoculation. This cytopathie effect (CPE) extended gradually in number and size, followed by degeneration of the affected cells in the center of the lesions, and covered approximately 20 per cent of the area in monolayers at 28 days post-infection. The cultures were harvested on the 30th day after inoculation, and subsequent passages were carried out with the culture fluids after one cycle of freezing and thawing. The virus suspensions were stored at -70 \u00b0 C and used in these experiments as CARS, unless otherwise mentioned. No CPE was observed in airy of the other celt cultures. Additional studies were made to determined whether SDAV produces CPE on the celt cultures as described above; however, there was no noticeable change in the cell cultures tested during 30 days observation.",
