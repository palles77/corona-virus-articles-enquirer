Extensive search for modified nucleosides has led to the discovery of many potent drugs for treatment of various viral infections 1 and diverse types of neoplasms ( Fig. 1 ). 2 The adverse effects of the available therapies, low selectivity and the observed drug resistance have become a driving force in a search for new analogues with improved pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties. Numerous modifications of naturally occurring nucleosides have provided analogues with altered sugar and/or nucleobase subunits. Heterocycles containing one or more heteroatoms and carbocycles of various sizes as well as straight or branched chains also with heteroatoms have been applied as an alternative to the furanose ring. 3, 4 So far less attention has been paid to the synthesis of analogues having modified nucleobase residues in comparison to sugar-modified analogues due to ensuring base pairing, but recently it has been proven that other aromatic rings are able to base-pair as well. 5 A long list of nucleoside analogues continues to expand by incorporation of several linkers such as a 1,2,3-triazole group, 6-9 a carbamoyl [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] or an ureidyl function 18 among others.",

Most of substituted acrylamides 9 used in this paper have already been described in the literature. However, compounds 9ab, 9ad, 9an, 9az and 9ba were prepared according to the standard procedure from commercially available substituted anilines and acryloyl chloride in the presence of triethylamine. 29 Cycloadditions of nitrone 8 with acrylamides 9aa-9ba were carried out in toluene at 70\u00b0C and afforded mixtures of diastereoisomeric (3-diethoxyphosphoryl)isoxazolidines trans-10aa-10ba and cis-11aa-11ba (Scheme 2, Table 1 ). In all cases moderate to good trans/cis diastereoselectivities (de 50-80%) were observed. The crude mixtures of the respective cycloadducts were subjected to column chromatography and in almost all cases (except for 10ae, 10ah and 10aq) pure major trans-isomers 10 were separated in moderate to good yields (Table 1). Isolation of pure minor cis-isomers 11, which are very cru- cial for biological evaluation, was not a trivial task. However, several purifications of the enriched diastereoisomeric mixtures of the respective isoxazolidines 10/11 on silica gel columns proved fruitful for isoxazolidines 11aa, 11ab, 11ac, 11ai, 11aj, 11al, 11am, 11an, 11ap, 11aq, 11ar, 11as, 11at, 11av, 11aw and 11ba (Table 1) making minute quantities of cis-11 available. Stereochemistry of the cycloaddition of N-substituted C-phosphorylated nitrones to various alkenes has already been described and the relative configurations of trans-and cis-isoxazolidine cycloadducts were established based on detailed conformational analyses. [23] [24] [25] 27, 28 Indeed, the assignment of relative configurations in isoxazolidines has often been difficult due to conformational flexibility of substituted five-membered ring, but in the case of isoxazolidines containing the diethoxyphosphoryl group at C3 stereochemically valuable data are extended over PCCH 30, 31 and PCCC 31-34 vicinal couplings, which appeared to be extremely useful in establishing the stereochemistries of phosphorus-labelled heterocycles. 35, 36 For the major isomers of all obtained isoxazolidines 10aa-10ba trans-configuration was assigned taking advantage of our previous observations regarding stereochemistry of cycloaddition of N-methyl-C-phosphorylated nitrone 8 with terminal alkenes. 27, 28 In this series a similar approach to configurational assignment was applied. Thus, based on the values of vicinal coupling constants [J CCCP = 8.6-9.5 Hz, J H3-H4a = 7.7-8. 3 Hz, J H3-H4b = 8.5-9.2 Hz, J H4a-P = 8.0-9. 8 Hz, J H4b-P = 15.4-16.1 Hz, J H4a-H5 = 5.0-5.7 Hz and J H4b-H5 = 8.5-9.2 Hz] extracted from the 1 H and 13 C NMR spectra of compounds 10al-10ao, 10aq, 10at and 10aw-10ba preferred 3 E conformation of the isoxazolidine ring ( Fig. 3 ) was established. In this conformation the diethoxyphosphoryl group resides in the equatorial position of the isoxazolidine ring while carbamoyl substituents are located pseudoequatorially. Furthermore, a similar spectral pattern was previously observed for structurally related methyl trans-3-(diethoxyphosphoryl)-2methylisoxazolidin-5-yl-5-carboxylate. 27, 28 To provide an additional piece of evidence for the already established relative configuration at C3 and C5 in isoxazolidines trans-10 and cis-11 2D NOE experiments were performed for trans-10ay and cis-11ay (Fig. 4) . The occurrence of NOE signal between HC5 and HC3 was noticed for cis-11ay, while the spectrum of trans-10ay lacks such correlation. Urtica dioica agglutinin (UDA) were used as the reference compounds. The antiviral activity was expressed as the EC 50 : the compound concentration required to reduce virus plaque formation (VZV) by 50% or to reduce virus-induced cytopathogenicity by 50% (other viruses). Unfortunately, no inhibitory activity against any virus was detected for the evaluated compounds at 250 lM.",
