Upon enrolment, nasopharyngeal swabs were collected for the real-time PCR detection of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) types A and B, influenza virus types A and B, adenovirus, parainfluenza viruses types 1, 2, 3 and 4, rhinovirus, human metapneumovirus, human coronavirus types 229E, OC43, NL63, and HKU1, bocavirus, enterovirus, and paraechovirus; nasopharyngeal aspirates were also obtained to detect atypical bacteria. At least one infectious agent was identified in 76 children (89.4%). RSV was the most frequently detected pathogen and its prevalence was significantly higher than that of the other pathogens in both age groups, and significantly higher in the children aged 3-12 months than in those aged <3 months. Only the children with RSV infection experienced recurrent wheezing. Viral load was significantly higher in children with than in those without recurrent wheezing. This study shows that RSV is the main reason for hospitalization during the first wheezing episode in infants, and that it appears to be the only pathogen associated with a high frequency of recurrences. A high viral load seems to be strictly related to the likelihood of recurrence.",

These findings suggest that all of the respiratory pathogens can cause wheezing, and that all of them lead to a similar clinical presentation in hospitalized infants.

The finding that RSV remains the most important pathogen associated with the first episode of wheezing during the first year of life, and that only subjects infected with this virus are at risk of developing long-term airway hyperresponsiveness, confirm the data suggesting that RSV induces age-related changes in lung function [5, [25] [26] [27] . Mouse studies have shown that the probability of a chronic alteration in lung function is greater the earlier the first RSV infection occurs, as is the probability that a subsequent infection will be followed by severe wheezing [25, 47] . Earlier infection seems to induce a polarized Th2 response which, in the case of re-infection, causes exacerbated disease, as indicated by enhanced pulmonary resistance, mucus hyperproduction, eosinophilia, and high Th2 cytokine levels [48] [49] [50] . Our data suggest that, in humans, the period during which RSV infection can lead to a greater risk of further wheezing episodes extends at least until the end of the first year of life. The proportion of children in the current study infected by RSV who experienced a new episode of wheezing in the 6 months following the first episode was virtually the same in both age groups, whereas none of the children whose first wheezing episode was associated with an infectious agent other than RSV experienced a further episode. This study also demonstrates for the first time that RSV viral load predicts the tendency to recur, but not disease severity, in children hospitalized because of a first wheezing episode. On the contrary, the type of RSV does not seem to be related to the clinical presentation, outcome or recurrence. Recent studies have assessed the role of host and viral factors in influencing RSV illness, but their results are controversial. A relationship between RSV genotypes and clinical data has not been completely established [51] [52] [53] , and RSV viral load appears to correlate with disease severity in some studies [54, 55] but not in others [51] .",
