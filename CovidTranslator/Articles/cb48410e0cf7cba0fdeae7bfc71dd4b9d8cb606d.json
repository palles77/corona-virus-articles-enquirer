According to the World Health Organization (WHO), suicide is the 13th leading cause of death worldwide. It leads among violent causes of death (e.g., suicide, homicide, traffic deaths). Among those aged between 15 and 44 years, suicide is the fourth leading cause of death, and violence against the self is the sixth leading cause of disability. Suicidal behavior ranges in degree from merely thinking about ending one's life, through developing a plan to commit suicide and obtaining the means to do so, attempting to kill oneself, to finally carrying out the act of ''completed suicide''. The term ''suicide'' is based on the Latin words sui (of oneself) and caedere (to kill). The Encyclopaedia Britannica defines suicide as: ''the human act of self-inflicting one's own life cessation.'' However, it is often difficult to reconstruct the thoughts of people who commit suicide unless they have made clear statements before their death since all suicidal deaths are not clearly planned. In many legal systems, a death is certified as suicide if murder, accidental death, and natural causes can all be ruled out and if the circumstances are consistent with suicide.",
