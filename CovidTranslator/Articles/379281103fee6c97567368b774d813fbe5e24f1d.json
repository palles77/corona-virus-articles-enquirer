            "text": "During serial undiluted passage of rubella virus (RUB) in Vero cells, two species of defective-interfering (DI) RNAs of approximately 7000 and 800 nucleotides (nts) in length were generated (Frey, T. K., and Hemphill, M. L, Virology 164, 22-29, 1988). In this study, these DI RNAs were characterized by molecular cloning, hybridization with probes of defined sequence, and primer extension. The 7000-nt DI RNA species were found to be authentic DI RNAs which contain a single 2500-to 2700-nt deletion in the structural protein open reading frame (ORF) region of the genome. The 800-nt RNAs were found to be subgenomic DI RNAs synthesized from the large DI RNA templates. Analysis of the extent of the deletions using a reverse-transcription-PCR protocol revealed that the 3' end of the deletions did not extend beyond the 3' terminal 244 nts of the genome. The 5' end of the deletions did not extend into the nonstructural protein ORF; however, DI RNAs in which the subgenomic start site was deleted were present. Following serial undiluted passage of seven independent stocks of RUB, this was the only pattern of DI RNAs generated. DI RNAs of 2000 to 3000 nt in length were the majority DI RNA species in a persistently infected line of Vero cells, showing that other types of RUB DI RNAs can be generated and selected. However, when supernatant from the persistently infected cells was passaged, the only DI RNAs present after two passages were 7000 nts in length, indicating that this species has a selective advantage over other types of DI RNAs during serial passage.",

            "text": "Rubella virus (RUB) is a member of the Togavirus family and is the sole member of the Rubivirus genus (Francki et aL, 1991) . The RUB genome is a singlestranded, positive-polarity RNA molecule of 9757 nucleotides (nts)in length (reviewed by Frey, 1994) . The genome RNA contains two long open reading frames (ORFs). The 5' proximal ORF encodes the nonstructural proteins (NSP-ORF) and the 3' proximal ORF encodes the structural proteins (SP-ORF) in the order NH2-C-E2-E1-COOH. Both nonstructural and structural proteins are proteolytically processed from a polyprotein precursor into the individual proteins. Replication of the virus RNA is carried out through a negative-polarity, genome-length intermediate RNA species= initiation at the 3' end of the negative-polarity template leads to production of the genomic RNA while initiation at an internal site on the negative-polarity RNA template leads to production of a subgenomic RNA (SG RNA). The SG RNA is translated to produce the structural proteins. The genome organization and replication strategy of RUB is similar to that of the alphaviruses, the other Togavirus genus whose members have been well-characterized (reviewed in Strauss and Strauss, 1986) .",

            "text": "RUB generates defective-interfering (DI) RNAs during both serial undiluted passage and persistent infection in cell culture (Norval, 1979; Bohn and van AIstyne, 1981; Terry etaL, 1985; Frey and Hemphill, 1988; Abernathy et al., 1990) . In a previous report from this lab (Frey and Hemphill, 1988) , DI RNAs were detected after four serial passages in Vero cells. Two DI RNA species were generated and maintained through 20 passages, a large species of approximately 7000 nts in length and a smaller species ranging from 700 to 1000 nts in length. Concomitant with the appearance of DI RNAs, a decrease in the amount of standard genome RNA and a drop in virus titer were observed (Frey and Hemphill, 1988) , indicating that these DI RNAs interfered with the replication of standard virus. In persistently infected Vero cells, up to seven DI RNAs were detected and the number of these species varied as the persistently infected culture was propagated (Abernathy et aL, 1990) . The majority of the DI RNAs in persistently infected cells is less than 3000 nts in length (Norval, 1979; Frey and Hemphill, 1988; Abernathy et al., 1990) . This paper describes the molecular characterization of DI RNAs generated during serial passage of RUB in Vero cells.",

Intracellular RNA was extracted between 48 and 72 hr p0stinfection (at the time that cytopathic effects were initially observable) bythe method of Sawicki eta/. (1981) . Northern gel analysis of intracellular RNA was as previously described (Hemphill eta/., 1988) with the exception that nylon membranes (Micron Separations, Inc.) were used instead of nitrocellulose. Synthesis of and hybridization with 32P-labeled positive-and negative-polarity RNA probes containing the 3' 587 nts of the RUB genome were as described previously (Hemphill eta/., 1988) . Northern transfers to be hybridized with radiolabeled oligonucieotide probes were prehybridized in 5x 8S0, 1% SDS, 1 mM EDTA, containing 200 #g/ml of denatured salmon sperm DNA for 2 hr or Rapid Hybridization Buffer (Amersham) for 30 min at 42 \u00b0 followed by addition 0fthe probe. Oligonucleotide probes, synthesized using an ABI Model 381A Synthesizer, were 5' end-labeled with [32P]ATP using polynucleotide kinase as described previously (Frey et al., 1989) . Hybridizations in Rapid Hybridization Buffer were done at 42 \u00b0 . For hybridizations in 5X SSC, the hybridization temperature for oligonucleotide probes was calculated using the following formula= TH(in\u00b0)= 2 X(A+T) +4 X (G + C)-5, whereA, T, 0, and G correspond to the number of times each nucleotide occurs in the oligonucleotide probe. After hybridization, membranes were washed at the hybridization temperature twice in 2\u00d7 SSC, 0.1% SDS for 15 min and once inlX SSC, 1% SDS for 15 min. Washed membranes were wrapped in plastic wrap and exposed to Kodak X-Omat AR film at -80 \u00b0 between two Cronex Lightning Plus intensifying screens (DuPont).",

One gradient fraction which contained an abundance of the small DI RNA species and a small amount of the large DI RNA species was used as a template for cDNA synthesis using oligo-dT as a primer. A cDNA library was constructed using a plasmid vector (pGEM-3z) and from the total of approximately 3000 recombinant colonies that were recovered, 3 colonies containing RUB-specific sequences were identified. The sequences of the RUB-specific inserts present in each of these 3 clones were determined (Fig. 2 , bottom). All three clones contained a poly-A tail and the exact 3' terminus 0fthe genome, including several hundred nts into the E1 coding region, All three clones contained a single large deletion in the SP-ORF extending from the E1 protein coding region to the capsid protein coding region, with the E2 protein coding region completely deleted.

The large deletion in the SP-ORF would account for the reduction in the size of the large DI RNA species as compared to the genome. Thus, the large DI RNA species could be capable of self-replication and the small DI RNA could be a SG RNA synthesized from the large DI RNA template (accounting for the lack of a negative~polarity equivalent).

To confirm that these DI RNAs contained the authentic 5' end of the genome, primer extension was performed on intraceilular RNA from standard RUB-infected cells and P12 RNA. Approximately 1 #g of each RNA was used as a template. Figure 4 shows the results of primer extension using radiolabeled oligonucleotide primer 36 which is complementary to sequences located 100 nts from the 5' end of the genome. Two primer extension products were produced from both RUB-infected cell RNA and P12 RNA. The lower of these is caused by termination at a stable secondary structure formed by 5' terminal sequences while the upper product is due to termination at the 5' end of the genome (Dominguez eta/., 1990) . Even though P12 RNA contained some genomic RNA, which can serve as a template for primer extension, the 7000-nt DI RNA was clearly the most abundant template (refer to Fig. 1) . Theoretically, DI RNAs which served as a template for primer extension (the majority of 7000 nt DI RNAs hybridized to primer 36, Fig. 3B ) and contained 5' termini that differed from the rubella virus genome would produce a primer extension product which migrated differently from that produced from the genome RNA. Only one primer extension product representing the 5' termini of the RNA template was produced from both RUB-infected cell RNA and P12 RNA, indicating that the majority of the large DI RNAs contain a 5' terminus similar to the standard genome.",

With exception of one of the short DI RNA species these species were present following one serial passage, although the relative amount of the 2000-to 3000rot DI RNA species was greatly reduced. By the second passage, only the large and short DI RNA species were present.",

The strategy is diagrammed in the top of Fig. 7 . Amplification products were cloned into pGEM-3z and 18 clones were isolated and sequenced. The extent of the deletion in each clone is given in Table 1 . The deletions were heterogeneous, ranging in size from 2504 to 3047 nts. All of the deletions were different although some deletions shared one breakpoint. Unexpectedly, 17 of the 18 RT-PCR clones had deletions which included the SG start site [the only P12 RT-PCR clone (120) which retained the SG start site was the result of a mispriming event during PCR amplification in which the 5' primer annealed downstream from the SG start site and thus selected for an amplification product that retained sequences downstream from the SG start site]. This RT-PCR technique was used to obtain information about the deletions present in DI RNAs from two other passages, P20 and piV(P5).

To confirm that this was not due to selective cloning of RT-PCR products lacking the SG start site into the plasmid vector used (i,e., that sequences around the SG start site are not stable in this vector), the original P12 and P20 RT-PCR reactions were ligated into the X bacteriophage vector, XGEM2, and recombinant plaques were screened by plaque hybridization to determine the proportion of P12 and P20 recombinants which retained the SG start site. Plaques were transferred to nylon membranes in duplicate and hybridized against two oligonucleotide probes, 86 which is complementary to sequences near the 3' end of the RUB genome and 10 which is complementary to sequences immediately downstream from the SG start site. All plaques containing RUB-specific inserts will hybridize to oligo 86 while only those containing the SG start site will hybridize to oligo 10. Ninety-seven of 100 (97%) of the P12 plaques with RUB-specific inserts and 12 of 47 (25%) of the P20 plaques contained inserts ~s upstream from the SG start site. This sequence is the end of a 20-nt region which shares homology with the alphavirus SG promoter (Frey, 1994) . Of the 10 clones which retained the SG start site, all retained at least 200 nts downstream from the start site, and 9 retained over 360 nts downstream. The 3' breakpoints of the deletions were distributed over a 300nt region and all of the clones retained at least 244 nts from the 3' terminus of the genome. Two regions of clustering of 3' breakpoints were observed. The first cluster occurred between nts 9228 and 9234 (UUCAAGA) and contained the breakpoints of 6 clones. The second cluster occurred between nts 9443 and 9455 (CCAAGUCAG-CUGC) and contained the breakpoints of 11 clones. Of the 10 RT-PCR clones which retained the SG start site and extended into the SP-\u00a9RF, 6 maintained the reading frame of the S P -O R F across the deletion. No consensus sequence or sequence homology was identified on either side of any single deletion which could account for its generation. Analysis of computer-generated secondary structures of both sides of the deletion did not reveal any significant secondary structures which could be responsible for generation of the deletions (data not shown).",

A predicted stem-loop structure shown to bind host cell proteins is indicated near the end of the E1 coding region. authentic DI RNA that contained a single deletion in the SP-ORF and the smaller species was a SG RNA synthesized from the large DI RNA. Evidence supportive of the conclusion that the smaller species was a SG RNA was as follows. First, no negative-polarity complement of the small DI RNA was detected, indicating that it was not replicated directly through an intermediate negative-polarity species. A negative-polarity complement of the small DI RNA species was detected previously by Frey and Hemphill (1988) but was most likely a result of the method of intracellular RNA extraction that was used, which also resulted in the detection of a negative-polarity complement for the SG RNA. These results were most likely due to nonspecific RNase digestion of single-stranded regions of double-stranded full-length replicative intermediates which contain both positive-and negative-polarity RNAs. Second, cloning of DI RNAs from P12 intracellular RNA resulted in recovery of one clone, 181, that contained the majority of the NSP-ORF and SG start site. The DI RNA from which this clone was derived was thus theoretically capable of synthesizing (or serving as a template for the synthesis of) a SG RNA. Third, both the large and small DI RNA species hybridized to a probe complementary to the 5' end of the SG RNA. However, only the large DI RNA species hybridized to a probe complementary to sequences immediately upstream, indicating that the small DI RNA species does not contain sequences upstream from the SG stag site. Finally, the Frey and Hemphill (1988) that the large DI RNAs, but not the small DI RNA, were encapsidated. Several pieces of evidence suggested that the large DI RNAs conserve the entire NSP-ORF and contain a single deletion in the structural ORF. The largest clone recovered from P12 RNA, clone 181, extended from the poly-A tail to nt 740 of the genome and contained a faithful copy of the nonstructural ORF from nt 740 to the end of the ORF. Although the 5' end of the genome and NSP-ORF was not present in any of the cDNA clones generated, Northern hybridization with probes complementary to sequences upstream from nt 740 demonstrated that the large DI RNAs contained the 5' end of the genome and the 5' end of the NSP-ORF. A primer extension experiment indicated that the large DI RNA contained the authentic 5' end of the genome RNA. The only deletion observed in clone 181 was located within the SP-ORF and the shorter clones recovered from P12 RNA (182 and 183) also contained a large deletion of the same region of the SP-ORF that was deleted in clone 181. Northern hybridization with a probe within the deleted region showed that both the large and small Di RNA population uniformly contained this deletion. The sizes of DI RNAs that contained the complete NSP-ORF and deletions of the structural ORF present in clones 181, 182, and 183 would be 7099, 7147, and 7185 nts, respectively, consistent with the size of the large DI RNAs. An'alysis of the extent of the SP-ORF deletion by RT-PCR revealed that the 5' most deletion site preserved the termination codon of the NSP-ORF and no deletions were detected that extended into the NSP-ORF.",

Additionally, oligonucleotide probes complementary to sequences immediately upstream and downstream from the SG start site hybridized to the large DI RNA in P12 RNA. This result was also in contrast with the clones generated by cDNA synthesis, in all 3 of which the 5' breakpoint of the deletion was downstream from the SG start. This result was not due to the inability of template containing the SG start site to be amplified by PCR since the majority of the P20 RT-PCR clones contained the SG start site. Itwas also not due to instability of sequences in the vicinity of the SG start site in the plasmid vector pG EM-3z since when P12 RT-PCR products were cloned into a bacteriophage X vector, 97% of the RUB-specific recombinant plaques contained deletions of the SG start site.

Thus, DI RNAs that both retain and delete the SG start site were maintained in the DI RNA population during serial passaging and the relative abundance of each varied. This is in distinct contrast to alphavirus DI RNAs which have been characterized to date, all of which delete the SG promoter and start site (Schlesinger, 1988) . It is thought that deletion of the SG promoter provides a selective advantage for replication of the DI RNA over standard genomes because alphavirus DI RNA negativepolarity templates are uniformly available for replication and not used for SG RNA synthesis. It is not clear why RUB DI RNAs that retain the SG start site and produce a SG message are not only retained in the DI RNA population but are also the majority species at certain passages. In addition to maintenance of the SG start site, the overall structure of RUB DI RNAs also contrasts with the structure of alphavirus DI RNAs, which usually contain a complex array of multiple internal deletions, duplications, rearrangements, and occasionally cell-derived sequences (Schlesinger, 1988) . Unlike RUB DI RNAs, alphavirus DI RNAs have usually deleted most of the genomic sequences and are thus relatively small [often a fraction (i.e. one-fourth) of the total genome size].",

Supporting evidence that MHV DI RNA fusion ORFs are translated was provided by de Groot et al. (1992) who constructed a DI cDNA clone derived from a MHV DI RNAwhich contained a fusion ORF and then generated nonsense and frameshift mutants that did not preserve the fusion ORF. It was found that translation of the ORF was required for efficient amplification of the MHV DI RNA transcripts. Of the 10 P12 and P20 clones which retain the SG start site, only 6 maintained the reading frame of the SP-ORF.

In two other reports on RUB DI RNA generation during serial passage, the species detected were also 7000 to 9000 nts in length (Bohn and van Alstyne, 1981; Terry et al., 1985) . As observed in analysis of DI RNAs present in persistent infection, other types of RUB DI RNAs can be generated. The 2000-3000 nt DI RNAthat was the major-ity intracellular species contained both 5' and 3' terminal sequences. Thus, the prevalence of the large DI RNA species during serial passage is probably due to its having a selective advantage over other DI RNA species. One possibility is efficiency of encapsidation, a feature more critical for maintenance during serial passage than persistent infection. Both the long DI RNA and the 2000to 3000-nt species from persistent infection were encapsidated as evidenced by their ability to be passaged, but the long DI RNA outcompeted the 2000-to 3000-nt species within two serial passages. However, the RUB encapsidation sequences have not been defined and the disappearance of the 2000-to 3000-nt species within two passages could have been due to factors other than encapsidation. Another possible selective advantage of the large DI RNA is that DI RNAs which contain the entire NSP-ORF can theoretically synthesize their own nonstructural proteins and thus self-replicate. Considering that the m.o.i, of standard virus in serially passaged stock is 0.1 to 0.01 PFU/cell (Frey and Hemphill, 1988) and that the eclipse phase during RUB infection approaches 12 hr , a DI RNA which can self-replicate in a cell while waiting for infection of the cell by a standard helpervirus would have a selective advantage over DI RNAs which do not contain the NSP-ORF and thus cannot self-replicate.",
