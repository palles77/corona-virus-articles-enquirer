We have previously demonstrated efficacy of a new class of antimicrobial antibody fusions in a neonatal mouse model for C. parvum infection. Here, we extend efficacy testing of these products to experimental infection in calves, the principal target species. Neonatal calves were challenged with C. parvum oocysts and concomitantly treated with antibody-biocide fusion 4H9-G1-LL37 over the course of four days. This resulted in reduced severity of the disease when compared to control animals. Overall clinical health parameters showed significant improvement in treated animals. Oocyst shedding was reduced in treated when compared to control animals. Control of oocyst shedding is a prerequisite for breaking the cycle of re-infection on dairy farms. Antibody-biocide fusion products thus have the potential to reduce the impact of the infection in both individual animals and in the herd.",

The most prevalent species producing disease in cattle, Cryptosporidium parvum, can cause extensive economic loss in young calves, although some cases remain subclinical (Wyatt et al., 2010) . C. parvum is a primary contributor to the neonatal diarrhea complex, along with rotavirus, coronavirus, and Escherichia coli, and is one of the most important zoonotic agents of diarrhea in calves aged below one month (Naciri et al., 1999) . Severely affected animals may die, but more often, a self-limiting diarrhea results in morbidity and increased labor and veterinary costs (deGraaf et al., 1999) . Infected animals usually shed large numbers of infective oocysts in their feces (Nydam et al., 2001) . In dairy calves, the prevalence of shedding has been reported to be the highest among animals 7-21 days of age, with a prepatent period of 3-6 days (Fayer, 2008a) .",

The selection of MAbs was based on the work of Schaefer et al. who described significant sporozoite neutralization in vitro and reduction of infection in neonatal mice with a panel of MAbs produced against surface-exposed antigens of C. parvum sporozoites. Among others, MAb 4H9, which was produced against the GP25-200 antigen complex of C. parvum, was chosen for the development of an antibody-biocide fusion (Schaefer et al., 2000) . This was done by genetically linking the coding sequence of MAb 4H9 heavy chain with the coding sequence of LL37, a human cathelicidin-derived antimicrobial peptide. The resulting constructs were expressed in a highly efficient retrovector-based mammalian cell culture system. Testing of these novel immunotherapeutics in a neonatal ICR mouse infection (asymptomatic) model revealed that 4H9-G1-LL37 achieved sporozoite neutralization at a 50 fold lower dose than C. parvum-specific neutralizing MAb 3E2, the most potent of the neutralizing antibodies identified to date (Imboden et al., 2010) . A dose response mouse trial demonstrated efficacy at a dosage as low as 1.5 mg/kg/d given for 5 days (Imboden et al., 2010) . This study allowed establishment of an effective dose for orally administered antibody-biocide fusions in rodents.",

The IgG1 heavy chain constant region was previously engineered (Imboden et al., 2010) to contain the human LL37 sequence attached to the C-terminal end. Fully assembled heavy chain-linker-LL37 and light chain constructs were transduced into CHO (Chinese hamster ovary) cells using a pantropic Moloney murine leukemia virus-based retroviral expression vector system (Clontech, Mountain View, CA). Due to the high efficiency transduction, cell pools secreting the 4H9-G1-LL37 antibody-biocide fusion were subjected to standard limiting dilution cloning to isolate clonal cell lines for pilot scale production in 20 L benchtop fermentors (Wave Bioreactor TM Systems, GE, Piscataway, NJ).",

            "text": "A total of sixteen newborn Holstein bull calves were obtained from the same closed herd production unit of approximately 10,000 dairy cows, in 4 cohorts of 4 calves each. To assemble an age-matched cohort of 4 calves, cows calving within a maximum 12 h period were selected. Calving was manually assisted and the calves were delivered onto plastic sheeting to prevent contamination with enteropathogens that might otherwise confound interpretation of the results, and then placed in individual disinfected transport crates containing autoclaved straw. Upon arrival at the University of Arizona Central Animal Facility BSL2 unit, each calf was randomly assigned to groups using the Microsoft Excel Random Number Generation Tool, weighed and then placed into an elevated calf stall (Wenke Manufacturing, Pender, NE) equipped with urine and fecal collection pans. Calf weights were between 37.5 and 48.6 kg. A single ear tag was applied which served as the calf's identifying number in the study. Commercial colostrum replacer (Bovine IgG Colostrum Replacement, Land O'Lakes, Shoreview, MN) from a single production lot for all calves in the study was administered within 2 h of birth per label instructions. Adequacy of passive transfer of colostral IgG was determined using a commercially available sodium sulfite precipitation test, serum from each calf was collected at 24-36 h of age (Bova-S Bovine FPT Test Kit, VMRD Inc., Pullman, WA). All the calves reached serum levels of immunoglobulin between 800 and 1600 mg/ml which is defined as adequate transfer. Bo-Se \u00ae vitamin E/Se supplement (3 ml/45 kg) (Merck, Whitehouse Station, NJ) was injected subcutaneously to each calf within 12 h of birth. Beginning at 12 h of age, all calves were maintained on reconstituted milk replacer (Nutrena \u00ae Snowflakes \u00ae Calf Milk II-Utiliz Milk Replacer Medicated, Cargill Animal Nutrition, Minneapolis, MN) twice daily (10% body weight at arrival for days 1-5 and thereafter 50% more) until termination of the experiment at day 10 post infection (DPI). At the end of the acclimation period of 36 h, an overall clinical examination was performed to determine health status prior to admitting each animal to the study. Calves were observed for fever (>39.4 \u2022 C), diarrhea, respiratory distress, inability to rise on own, and inappetence. No exclusions were needed based on these health parameters. An individual fecal sample was collected from each calf to determine the presence of other known viral and bacterial enteropathogenic agents (rotavirus, coronavirus, E. Coli K99 and/or F41, and Salmonella) 2 h post oocyst challenge and on DPI 10. Negative-staining electron microscopy was used for direct examination of feces to identify rotavirus and coronavirus particles. Aerobic cultures were performed on feces to detect the presence of aerobic bacterial pathogens. Sheep blood agar and Tergitol-7 agar (Hardy Diagnostics, Santa Maria, CA) were used for routine aerobic culture, whereas Tetrathionate broth and XLT-4 agar (Hardy) were used for Salmonella culture. Enteric bacteria were identified by routine biochemical tests (Anon, 2007) . The presence of K99 antigen in E. coli isolates was evaluated by the E. coli antigen latex agglutination test kit (K-99 Pilitest. VWRD, Inc. Pullman, WA). All samples were found to be negative for these pathogens. The calves were examined once daily by a veterinarian. Each cohort consisted of two groups of two animals, with one group receiving 4H9-G1-LL37 and the other group receiving the control substance. Personnel involved in the calf handling were unaware of the treatment identity (single-blind study). During this 8-month trial, a total of 4 cohorts of 4 animals were recruited. There were two treatment groups: (i). 4H9-G1-LL37 test substancetreated, (ii) control substance-treated animals. All animals belonging to the same treatment group were statistically analyzed as one group, i.e. all data from the same treatment group were averaged across cohorts. The 4H9-G1-LL37 test substance-treated and control substance-treated animals were housed in separate BSL2 rooms. Prior to oocyst challenge at 36 h age, individual fecal samples were collected and examined for C. parvum oocysts by acid-fast staining and confirmed to be negative (Smith, 2008) .",

Average scores for health parameters were calculated by averaging the scores among all animals of the same treatment and the same day. The best possible score for a healthy animal is 1, accordingly the worst score for a sick animal is 4. Statistical analysis was carried out using the modeling platform of JMP version 9 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). A full factorial regression model was used with the following effects and interactions in the model: Cohort, Treatment, Cohort \u00d7 Treatment, Cohort \u00d7 Day, Treatment \u00d7 Day, Cohort \u00d7 Treatment \u00d7 Day. In the regression analysis time (Day) was treated as a continuous fixed effect variable. Day is modeled as a fixed effect using a knotted spline as described by Stone and Koo (1986) . A regression model with time as a fixed effect was chosen rather than a repeated measures analysis because of the nature of the biological responses which are all non-random time-dependent responses each dependent on the timing of their measurement relative to the parasite challenge. In that regard the study is more akin to a pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic study where spline functions are used in the models. Use of the knotted splines makes possible direct area under the curve measures fitting of the biological patterns. Use of knotted splines is similar to the use of polynomial terms in the model but can more closely fit the experimental data. Details of an example output of the modeling platform for the oocyst shedding data can be found in Supplemental Fig. S1 .",

The mean daily oocyst output in the 4H9-G1-LL37treated animals was significantly lower over the period of 10 days post infection than the mean daily oocyst output in control-treated animals (P < 0.0001), with the reduction being greatest during the peak period of shedding days 4-6 PI ( Fig. 2A) .

The 4H9-G1-LL37 fusion derives its specificity from the variable region of a monoclonal antibody directed against the GP25-500 complex on the C. parvum sporozoite surface (Schaefer et al., 2000) and its parasiticidal function from the human cathelicidin derived peptide LL37, an antimicrobial peptide found to have a neutralizing effect on sporozoites in vitro (manuscript submitted).",

Treatment efficacy was demonstrated by improved health parameters and reduced oocyst shedding in Cryptosporidium-infected calves, a reduction of fecal output in treated animals (data not shown) was not detected. From an epidemiologic perspective, reduction of Table 1 Clinical observations were scored and analyzed by a full factorial regression model according to the experimental model described in methods. 'Treatment' compares all 4H9-G1-LL37-treated animals (cohort 1-4) to all control-treated animals (cohort 1-4) with regard to each health parameter. 'Cohort' compares differences between each cohort (containing both 4H9-G1-LL37-and control-treated animals) with regard to each health parameter. 'Control \u00d7 Treatment' compares cohorts to each other with regard to treatment and each health parameter. 'Day & Knotted' indicates that a knotted spline transformation was used to accommodate the time-variant responses with regard to treatment, day and each of the health parameters. Data was collected from day 1 to day 10 (conclusion of the experiment). DF = degrees of freedom. oocyst shedding is an important factor in helping reduce the parasite pool in the environment. We are aware of the fact that a 50% overall reduction in oocyst shedding might not suffice to control the spread of the disease but it might make a significant contribution to a comprehensive Cryptosporidium control program of any given farm. A reduction of the parasite pool would result in reduced dairy herd infection as well as reduced likelihood of human exposure through direct contact at the farm or via drinking and recreational water supply contamination. The study conducted here was designed to demonstrate efficacy of a novel biotherapeutic in a large animal model for cryptosporidiosis using the least possible number of animals and the highest technically feasible oral treatment dose. Despite the fact that two control animals were lost prematurely due to unrelated complications, the study design was strong enough to demonstrate significance in oocyst shedding and overall health parameters.",

            "text": "This study provides proof of concept for a novel biotherapeutic in a clinical model for cryptosporidiosis. The treatment regimen and dose that were chosen are largely based on previous efficacy data in the neonatal mouse model (Imboden et al., 2010) and based on the assumption that an initial elevated dose during the first 4 h after challenge is important to achieve a therapeutic effect. Whether the subsequent regimen consisting of 12-h interval dosing had a positive or negative impact on the natural, asynchronous life cycle of Cryptosporidium and exposure of extracellular stages during the infection is not known. However, this successful proof of concept study serves as the starting point for further development of antibody-biocide fusion efficacy trials. In an effort to test treatment regimens that are more adaptable to field applications on a dairy farm, we will focus on testing less frequent treatment schedules, and lower treatment doses. To generate more field-like conditions, future trials will also include more animals and lower but multiple challenge doses. Lower challenge doses than that used in the present study have been shown by others to induce diarrhea in large numbers of calves with 100% infection rates and lower oocyst numbers shed (Moore et al., 2003; Perryman et al., 1999) . As we see a dose-dependent efficacy of our product in mice (Imboden et al., 2010) it is likely that a lower oocyst challenge number which results in a lower number of shed oocysts would allow a lower treatment dose of our antibody fusion product to achieve efficacy.",
