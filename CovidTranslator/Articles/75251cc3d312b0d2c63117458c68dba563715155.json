Results The number of bed closure days due to outbreak per overall bed days dropped from 2.8% to 0.5% during the intervention season and sustained at 0.6% during the postintervention season (p<0.001). There were fewer delays in initiation of droplet and contact precautions (28.8% to 15.5%, p=0.005) and collection of RV testing (42.9% to 20.3%, p<0.001), better reporting to OHS (9 vs 28.8 reports per 100 employees; p<0.001) and fewer isolation days (7.8% vs 7.3%; p=0.02) without a significant increase in missed work hours per 100 hours worked (4.0 vs 3.9; p=0.12).

Patients with respiratory symptoms were prospectively identified through active surveillance based on unit reporting and tracking of laboratory specimens. Mid-turbinate (MT) swabs were collected from all patients with new or worsening onset of one or more respiratory symptom (rhinorrhoea, cough, sore throat, wheeze or dyspnoea). A case was considered nosocomial if symptoms developed >72 hours after admission. A RV outbreak was defined as two nosocomial cases (non-roommates) in a designated unit with symptom onset within 48 hours and a lab-confirmed respiratory virus detected in a least one case. In the absence of laboratory confirmation of a respiratory virus, three nosocomial cases (non-roommates) within 48 hours in one unit was considered a RV outbreak. 7 RV outbreaks were declared over on day 8 following the onset of the last nosocomial RV case, in accordance with local public health guidelines. 7 Any unit where a RV outbreak was declared was immediately closed to new admissions. Accordingly, the census on the unit decreased throughout each outbreak as patients were discharged without new patient admissions. Reducing the number of bed-closure days due to outbreak was thus chosen as the primary aim of this study because it reflected the impact of these outbreaks on our facility's ability to fulfil its mission of providing inpatient rehabilitation.",

First, a comprehensive retrospective review of the line listed cases and epidemiological curves were conducted to adjudicate primary precipitant of the 12 prior RV outbreaks. This review identified that outbreaks resulted from a delay in initiation of droplet and contact precautions (6/12, 50%), staff working while ill (2/12, 17%), shared accommodations (2/12, 17%) and no definite cause identified but sick visitor suspected (2/12, 17%).",

Table 1 summarises the four new processes developed and their relationship to the problems identified. First, clarity was achieved regarding the criteria for initiation of droplet and contact precautions to include any patient with any of the following symptoms: new or worsening cough, runny nose, congestion or sore throat (September 2017). Second, communication to visitors to please not visit if they have any of those symptoms was included in two forms: an automated telephone message heard on calling the rehabilitation centre and signs placed in the lobby entrance (November 2017). Third, communication to staff regarding exemption for illness due to infectious causes was communicated to all healthcare providers in an attempt to address the perceived barrier of not coming to work ill (October 2017). To mitigate the risk of abuse of this exemption policy, improved reporting to OHS was required, which in turn necessitated a more efficient process for reporting to OHS. The fourth intervention was the development of an electronic programme allowing staff to report illness to OHS and simultaneously receive guidance about whether they are excluded from work due to infectious illness (December 2017). This programme incorporated questions about specific symptoms and symptom-onset and provided a personalised recommendation about whether the healthcare provider should work or remain home, based on whether or not they were considered infectious (see online supplementary material). In the event that the system identified a staff person as being infectious, the recommendation could be forwarded to the manager of the unit in order to exempt the employee from the attendance management system.",

A shift in practice was noted following training with significant reductions in delays in both initiation of droplet and contact precautions (15.5% vs 28.8%; p=0.005) and viral testing (20.3% vs 42.9%; p<0.001) in the intervention respiratory season and onward. Table 2 summarises the family of measures during the intervention and postintervention seasons compared with the baseline season. The number of bed closure days due to outreak adjusted for overall bed days dropped from 2.8% to 0.5% during the intervention season and was sustained at 0.6% during the postintervention season (p<0.001). Staff reporting to OHS increased from 9 to 28.8 per 100 employees (p<0.001). In terms of unintended consequences, earlier initiation of droplet and contact precautions did not lead to increased isolation days. In fact, the proportion of isolation days per patient days decreased during the intervention season as compared with baseline (7.3% vs 7.8%; p=0.02). With regard to potential for increased absenteeism, there was no significant change in the number of missed work hours for employees (4.0 missed hours/100 worked hours at baseline vs 3.9 missed hours /100 worked hours during intervention; p=0.12).",

            "text": "Our rehabilitation centre reduced the number of bed closure days due to RV outbreaks to less than a third for two consecutive seasons through process changes that supported earlier initiation of transmission-based precautions for symptomatic patients, discouraged visitation by people with potentially infectious symptoms and made it easier for healthcare workers to stay home when potentially infectious. Despite evidence supporting IPAC practices to prevent nosocomial transmission of RV infection each RV season, the adoption of these practices following education alone is often suboptimal leading to preventable nosocomial outbreaks. There is a paucity of literature around using QI strategies to address these gaps and to our knowledge, none have been undertaken to prevent RV outbreaks in rehabilitation settings. In the paediatric population, nosocomial transmission has been shown to be prevented through screening of patients and cohorting nurses with positive children along with the use of transmission-based precautions. 5 In a population of stem cell transplant patients, universal use of surgical masks by healthcare providers was associated with a greater than 50% reduction in nosocomial RV infection. 8 Rehabilitation settings are environments conducive to nosocomial RV transmission due to the nature of the patient population, which is being mobilised daily in common spaces. Our approach was to better understand the barriers to adherence to IPAC practices within the rehabilitation context. We used epidemiological data to identify important triggers of outbreaks and then drilled down to understand the main drivers. For example, delays in testing and initiation of droplet and contact precautions were occurring due to lack of clarity around syndromic criteria which was addressed through systematic training. Lack of private rooms was an additional barrier noted by our staff, but our experience showed that earlier initiation of transmission-based precautions actually led to the same number of isolation-days presumably due to reduced nosocomial transmission. Finally, we uncovered a number of system problems that made it easier for staff to work while sick rather than staying home. These included the perceived pressure from human resources attendance management and the challenge in accessing OHS. Once these were addressed through Open access redevelopment of an OHS electronic software reporting programme, better reporting of illness was seen. These examples underscore the impact of process changes that are linked to the specific barriers to best practice rather than relying on education alone. 9 A striking finding in our study is that despite making it easier for staff to report to OHS, we observed no significant increase in the average number of missed work hours. One explanation for this finding is that the additional absences for staff staying home when potentially infectious was offset by a reduction in staff becoming infected while at work due to fewer encounters with infectious colleagues and fewer unprotected encounters with nosocomial RV cases. These data argue against the perception that staff staying home when symptomatic could increase staff shortages and should empower organisations to create similar models of care that make staying home when sick the easier thing to do. 10 Despite improvement in IPAC practices, we continued to observe sporadic nosocomial transmission of RVs at our facility. One potential explanation is that increased viral testing resulted in ascertainment of more nosocomial cases even though there was reduced transmission through earlier use of droplet and contact precautions. Another possibility is that our intervention could not fully prevent nosocomial transmission as visitors continued to enter with infectious symptoms since we could not monitor this practice accurately. Finally, even though we reduced symptomatic visitation, either healthcare providers or visitors could have continued to transmit RV through asymptomatic viral carriage. 11 Some studies found limiting visits by children under the age of 12 during the winter months, may reduce nosocomial transmission of viral respiratory infection. 12 However, this approach may be a challenging and costly to operationalise as active screeners have to be strategically posted throughout the season.",
