In these mice, the virus did not require concomitant infection with Eperythrozoon coccoides to produce disease. Tests for antibodies against a variety of viruses were performed on serum from control colony mice and mice that recovered from experimental infection as well as on serum pooled fl'om vaccinated and non-vaccinated mice challenged with the recovered agent. Antibodies to the MHV complement fixing (CF) antigen(s) were demonstrated in only the last mentioned serum. Mice harbouring a hepatitis virus may thus be tolerant to their CF antigen(s) in a situation analogous to oneornavirus infection of their natural hosts. The liver pathology was that of a confluent focal-type necrosis resembling that produced by certain other MHV strains. We have labelled this newly isolated virus MHV (Swiss-Cape Town), abbreviated to MHV (S-CT).",

The disease was readily transmissible in non-ALS treated mice by means of serum or organ suspensions from in~ected animals and to date has been passaged serially 10 times. We believe that the causative agent is a virus. It passed through a 0.45 ~ millipore filter and was resistant to several antibodies, including tetracycline. Murine hepatitis virus CF antibodies were detected in serum pooled from non-vaccinated and vaccinated mice that were challenged with the isolated agent. The pattern of confluent zonal necrosis associated with a round cell infiltration of the liver resembled that produced by other MHV strains (16) , and was quite unlike the pyogenic lesions which would be expected in a bacterial infection. Cultures of diseased livers for bacteria including mycoplasmas were negative on several occasions. The detection of MHV CF antibodies as well as the localization of the disease to the liver would suggest the virus is a MHV strain. The other 3 viruses to which antibodies were demonstrated are not known to cause murine hepatitis. We designated this strain of MHV as MHV (Swiss-Cape Town), abbreviated to MHV (S-CT).",

Alternatively, viral activation may have resulted specifically from depression of immunity by ALS. Even if mice latently infected with MHV are tolerant to its CF antigen(s), it seems likely that mechanisms such as formation of neutralizing antibodies against the virus, cell mediated immunity, phagocytosis and interferon production exist that maintain the host-parasite equilibrium and prevent the development of overt disease, l~ecovery of latently infected mice following moderate \"superinfection\" may result from enhancement of the abovementioned mechanisms.",

A similar complicated interplay of factors is probably also responsible for the sporadic occurrence and unpredictability of the course of hepatitis in other lower animals and man. It also raises the possibility of development of virus hepatitis in man receiving ALS or antilymphocyte globulin (ALG). In 1968 EvAns etal. reported liver damage in 5 patients following immunosuppressive therapy (4). In 2 of the patients the treatment included the administration of ALG. He considered hepatotoxic drugs, virus hepatitis and cytomegalovirus as possible causative factors. More recently, cases have been documented associating immunosuppressive therapy with hepatitis, and the presence of hepatitis B antigen in human patients (5, 6, 10, 11) .",

Nelson of Rockefeller University who has conducted some studies with this MttV (S-CT). He has confirmed hepatotoxieity of the agent on intraperitoneal injection in Swiss mice Mthough it appeared to be less virulent than several other MHV strains. The activity of the virus was enhanced in the presence of E. coccoides and to a lesser extent with Nelson ascites tumor cells (15) . The greater severity of the hepatitis in our mice in the absence of E. coccoides probably reflects genetic differences between mouse colonies. We also thank Prof. A. Kipps and Dr. W. du T. :Naud4 for their suggestions regarding the manuscript and the animal caretakers, in particular Mr. C. Makana, for valuable services Iendered throughout this investigation.",
