Cytoplasmic fluorescence was fast observed at 12 hr postinfection (h.p.i) in infected HRT-18 cultures. This fluorescence coincided with the appearance of cell surface antigen reacting with colloidal gold-labeled antibodies to BCV antigens. At 24 h.p.i the amount of viral antigens at the surface of HRT-18 had increased, although cytoplasmic fluorescence remained constant. Infected BFS cells but not HRT-18 cells formed polykaryons when incubated in the presence of trypsin. One viral antigen in the plasma membrane of BFS cells was thus identified as the S glycoprotein with a fusion domain. In contrast to HRT-18 cells, the overall amount of BCV antigens at the surface of BFS cells remained constant after the onset of fusion. Analysis of the labeling characteristics established that the goldmarked-sites represented de novo expression of BCV antigen in the plasma membrane of infected cells. o 1990 Academic press, 1~.",

The major envelope-associated glycoprotein S has a molecular mass of 185 kDa which is cleaved into Sl and S2 (100-l 10 kDa) while HE has 62 kDa in the reduced and 140 kDa in the nonreduced form. S carries the structural sites responsible for virus attachment and fusion of host cells (Collins et al., 1982; Deregt et al., 1987) . Hemagglutination of rodent red blood cells and acetylesterase activity is associated with HE of BCV (King et al., 1985; Vlasak et al., 1988; Cavanagh et al., 1990) .

            "text": "The initial adaptation of wild-type strains of BCV to different cultured cells is difficult but most successful in the human rectal tumor (HRT-18) cell line which was derived from an adenocarcinoma (Tompkins et al., 1974; Laporte et al., 1979; . Monolayers of these polarized epithelioid cells resemble enterocytes, the type of cells targeted by BCV in natural infections (Doughri and Storz, 1977) . Cultures of different bovine fetal cells support noncytocidal multiplication of the cell-adapted strain of BCV (Mebus et al., 1978) . Bovine fetal spleen (BFS) cells are highly susceptible to BCV-induced cell fusion if trypsin is added to the medium of infected cultures. Cell fusion depends on trypsin cleavage of the 185-kDa precursor to the lOO-to IlO-kDa Sl and S2 Storz et af., 1981; .Cavanagh et al., 1990) . This phenomenon implies that virally encoded macromolecules are expressed in the plasma membrane (White et al., 1983) . Viral proteins in the host plasma membrane are not necessary for BCV maturation because coronaviral particles are enveloped by budding into intracellular compartments (Sturman and Holmes, 1982) . Viral components at the cell surface contribute to intracellular spread of the infection by fusion with uninfected cells, and they serve as targets for immune surveillance. Immunoelectron and immunofluorescence microscopy were used in this investigation to analyze the expression of virus-specific antigen in the plasmalemma of cells infected with BCV.",

Infected BFS cells failed to accumulate surface viral antigen after the onset of cell fusion, but BCV-infected HRT-18 cells accumulated increasing amounts of viral antigen on the cell surface yet these cells failed to fuse. The differences among infected BFS and HRT-18 cells in the surface expression of viral antigen and fusion might result from the kinetics and mechanisms of protein expression and the differences in the composition of the two plasma membranes.",

The appearance of virus-specific surface components during eclipse, for example, renders the infected cell susceptible to specific antibody-dependent or cell-mediated host defense mechanisms. Cell fusion induced by BCV may be an important mechanism for cell-to-cell spread of the infection (Mebus et al., 1978) . Here, we have shown that the appearance of viral antigen on the surface of BCV-infected cells precedes the onset of fusion. This fusion activity involves the S glycoprotein, which promotes fusion after trypsin cleavage of the 185kDa precursor to the IOO-to 1 lo-kDa Sl and S2 Payne and Storz, 1988; Cavanagh et al., 1990) . This BCV glycoprotein was thus identified by its function as a plasmalemma antigen of infected cells. The BCV hyperimmune serum used in our studies did not permit differentiation of the BCV glycoproteins. Monoclonal antibodies were not available when we initiated these investigations, which were designed to clarify whether BCV antigens are detectable at all in the plasmalemma of infected cells.",
