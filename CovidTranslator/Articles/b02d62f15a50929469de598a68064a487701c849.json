Many seminal works have demonstrated the impact of information propagation on the epidemic spreading, assuming that individuals are static and no mobility is involved. Inspired by the recent observation of diverse mobility patterns, we incorporate the information propagation into a metapopulation model based on the mobility patterns and contagion process, which significantly alters the epidemic threshold. In more details, we find that both the information efficiency and the mobility patterns have essential impacts on the epidemic spread. We obtain different scenarios leading to the mitigation of the outbreak by appropriately integrating the mobility patterns and the information efficiency as well. The inclusion of the impacts of the information propagation into the epidemiological model is expected to provide an support to public health implications for the suppression of epidemics.",

            "text": "Infectious diseases are transmitted through social contacts between individuals. The modeling of epidemic spreading among human beings has been extensively studied in mathematical epidemiology and network science. The developments of transportation system have enabled people to travel more globally. Consequently, epidemics starting from a local patch can spread to the entire network in a very short time. Recently, the metapopulation modeling approach has been broadly applied to study infectious disease spreading among the spatial structure of populations with well-defined social units (Colizza et al., 2007; Colizza and Vespignani, 2007; Balcan et al., 2010) . Then the metapopulation network model has been greatly developed by considering a number of factors such as the network structure (Watts et al., 2005; Wang et al., 2014) , human mobility patterns (Belik et al., 2011a (Belik et al., , 2011b , human behavior (Meloni et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2012) , and human contact patterns Yang et al., 2011; Iribarren, 2009) . It has been shown that the substrate network structure (Watts et al., 2005; Wang et al., 2014) plays an essential role in the spatial spread of epidemics. In real-world networks, human mobility patterns vary in a very complicated way, e.g., recurrent visits of patches (Belik et al., 2011a (Belik et al., , 2011b , diverse staying period in patches , etc. Human behavioral responses to the epidemics have also been found to be able to delay the epidemic spread (Meloni et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2012) . With regard to human contact patterns, location-specific contact patterns have been investigated . Recently, since human contact patterns are temporal, the nature of burstiness and heterogeneity in human activities has been found in empirical studies, and it has striking effects on the speed of spreading (Yang et al., 2011; Iribarren, 2009; Masuda and Holme, 2013) . For instance, heterogeneity of human activity is responsible for the slow dynamics of information propagation (Iribarren, 2009) .",

Following the seminal work in Ref. (Funk et al., 2009 ), the source of information (e.g., local or global awareness) and the pattern of information dissemination have been widely studied (Funk et al., 2010; Wu et al., 2012; Granell et al., 2013; Sahneh et al., 2013; Yuan et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2014) . Depending on the path of information propagation, there are several types of information. For instance, people obtain information from broadcasting and the Internet, which could be taken as a kind of global information. People can also exchange information by face-to-face contacts, which is a kind of contact-based information (Funk et al., 2009) . So far, the study of the impacts of information propagation on the epidemic spread has been restricted to individual-based networks, where one node corresponds to one individual (Zhang et al., 2014) .",

With a mean-field approximation of the metapopulation model, we find that both the information efficiency and the mobility patterns jointly affect the epidemic spread in terms of both the outbreak size and the epidemic threshold. When the information efficiency is low, mobility to the patch with more healthy individuals facilitates the epidemic spread with an increased outbreak size and an decreased epidemic threshold, even though more individuals get informed; on the contrary, when the information efficiency is high enough to cause people's attention, mobility to the patch with more healthy individuals, suppresses the epidemic outbreak by informing more individuals. In order to highlight the role of mobility, we apply a simplistic model of information dynamics to that of the disease dynamics; the incorporation of passing messages among mobile individuals in the metapopulation model gives us a new perspective on the countermeasure of epidemics, which is different from the previous studies on the contact-based networks. It suggests a possible way to suppress the epidemic spread by guiding individual mobility patterns in accordance with the evaluation of the risk perception and the information efficiency as well.",

To demonstrate the role of information propagation in the epidemic dynamics, we couple a mathematical model similar to the susceptible-infectioussusceptible (SIS) model for the epidemic dynamics with a model for the information propagation. Due to the information propagation, susceptible individuals are further classified into two types: Uninformed susceptible (S) and informed susceptible (A) individuals. Uninformed susceptible individuals are those who have not yet received the information on the epidemic and may get infected by contacting with infectious individuals at transmission rate \u03b2, while informed susceptible individuals (A) may get infected with a reduced transmission rate \u03b2 A with \u03b2 \u03b2 < A . This is supported by the fact that people may reduce the number of contacts as a defensive response (Poletti et al., 2009) and they also may get infected with a reduced infection transmission rate by self-awareness, such as wearing face-masks or washing hands frequently (Can et al., 2015; Zhang et al., , 2016 .

We assume that information is passed by contact instead of selfawareness, and for simplicity, we also assume that infectious individuals are ignorant to the information.

In this case, mobility patterns play a role different from that at a lower \u03b1 (Fig. 2 (a) ). Since informed individuals get full immunity to the infection, the more individuals get informed, the less individuals get infected. Hence, moving to the patch that contains more susceptible individuals will inform more and make them immune to the infectious disease. As a result, mobility patterns with \u03b3 \u03b3 = = 0.5 > 0 S A inform individuals most (the blue dotted curve) and yield the lowest prevalence of infection (the red dotted curve). The final prevalence of infection and that of the informed individuals for different choices of \u03b1 can be further observed in Fig. 3 . The final prevalence depends on the combined role of the information efficiency and mobility patterns. For instance, when \u03b1 = 0, the in-formed individuals get the same infection rate as the uninformed individuals do. We firstly observe that moving to the less safe patch can cause a higher epidemic threshold and a lower prevalence irrespective of the information efficiency \u03b1 (Fig. 3 (a1) , the black squares). Conversely, moving to the safer patches causes a smaller epidemic threshold and a higher prevalence (Fig. 3 (a1) , the red triangles).

This is irrelevant to the mobility patterns of the informed individuals and is independent of whether they approach the safer patches or not (\u03b3 > 0 A or \u03b3 < 0 A ). With an extremely high efficiency (\u03b1 = 1, Fig. 6 (b) ), we find two opposite results. The highest contact probability between information carriers and uninformed susceptible individuals yields the lowest prevalence (\"\u03b3 > 0 A and \u03b3 > 0 S \" or \"\u03b3 < 0 A and \u03b3 < 0 S \"), while the separation of them promotes the epidemic spread (\u03b3 > 0 S and \u03b3 < 0 A ). From the above results, we conclude that information propagation is vital to the epidemic spread. The role of information propagation has to be evaluated by taking the information efficiency \u03b1 into account. On the one hand, information may help mitigate the epidemic spread as long as it is highly efficient enough to reduce the risk of infection (a high value of \u03b1). Under this circumstance, mobility to safer patches may strengthen the role of information by informing more individuals. On the other hand, when the information on the disease cannot cause people's attention to reduce the risk of infection (a medium or lower value of \u03b1), informing more individuals by moving to the safer patches can only promote the epidemic spread by gathering more susceptible individuals in one patch.",

The mobility pattern is mainly driven by the risk perception expressed by the safety level at the destination patch. The more healthy individuals a patch contains, the safer it is.

We find that appropriately incorporating the knowledge of the information efficiency with the guidance of human mobility may effectively mitigate the epidemic outbreak by decreasing the outbreak size and increasing the epidemic threshold. Changing mobility patterns in accordance with the evaluation of the information efficiency could strengthen the role of information propagation in preventing the outbreak. Information carriers play a role of double sides of swords. Our results suggest that mobility to the patches that contain more healthy individuals can mitigate the epidemic outbreak only if the information can efficiently appeal people's attention to reduce the risk of infection; otherwise, informing more individuals can promote the epidemic spread with a larger outbreak size. Thus, in addition to the usual intervention measurements (e.g., vaccinations), guiding mobility patterns or controlling the traffic flow between patches based on the proper evaluation of the information efficiency may be useful in preventing an epidemic.",
